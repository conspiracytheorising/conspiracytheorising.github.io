</p>
<p>OPENING ADDRESS OF GEORGE BLISS.
</p>
<p>MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT, AND YOU, GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY :
</p>
<p>It has been assigned to me to state to you the grounds upon which the
</p>
<p>Government will ask that you pass your judgment upon the action of
</p>
<p>the defendants in this case, and to call your attention in some detail
</p>
<p>to the evidence which we shall present to you to sustain the charge
</p>
<p>which we make against them. That charge, gentlemen, is. what is
</p>
<p>.known as conspiracy, and it is founded upon a statute of the United
</p>
<p>States which is substantially this : There was an amendment of the
</p>
<p>statute in 1879. A portion of this charge relates to a period prior to
</p>
<p>1879, and a portion to a period after 1879 ; so far as the operative portion
</p>
<p>of the statute is concerned it remains unchanged. It was the same in
</p>
<p>both periods. The statute is this :
</p>
<p>If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United
</p>
<p>States, or to dffrand the United States in any manner, or for any purpose, and one or
</p>
<p>more of such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, all of the
</p>
<p>parties to such conspiracy shall be liable
</p>
<p>to a penalty specified. That is the amendment to section 5440 of the
</p>
<p>Revised Statutes of the United States, passed on the 17th of May, 1879.
</p>
<p>It provides, you will see, gentlemen, that if any two or more persons
</p>
<p>conspire to defraud the United States in any manner whatever or for
</p>
<p>any purpose whatever, and if any one of them does any acf, all of them
</p>
<p>are guilty under the statute. We expect to show you that these par-
</p>
<p>ties did conspire to defraud the United States out of large sums of money
</p>
<p>in connection with the postal service of the United States, and that one
</p>
<p>or more of them did various acts in pursuance of the conspiracy, arid
</p>
<p>that they are all guilty under the statute. And we shall with consider-
</p>
<p>able confidence ask a verdict of guilty at your hands after the evidence
</p>
<p>on both sides shall have been closed.
</p>
<p>These defendants, gentlemen, are persons who have some of them
</p>
<p>heretofore occupied prominence in the community. One of them is an
</p>
<p>ex-United States Senator from the State of Arkansas. Another one of
</p>
<p>them was the Second Assistant Postmaster General, who, by virtue of his
</p>
<p>office, had charge of the whole business of making the contracts for the
</p>
<p>mail service and regulating the rate of pay which could be allowed for

</p>
<p>carrying the mails. Another one of them is the brother of the ex-United
</p>
<p>States Senator of whom I have spoken. Another is the brother, in law.
</p>
<p>The brother-in-law is not before you practically, because he is dead,
</p>
<p>though I think there is no formal evidence upon that point. Another one
</p>
<p>is the friend and, to some extent, the business associate of the ex-United
</p>
<p>States Senator. The last one was his clerk and confidential employe.
</p>
<p>That is the relation which those gentlemen bear to this case ; and I may
</p>
<p>say here at the outset that the theory of the Government is that the
</p>
<p>conspiracy to defraud the United States, the method of defrauding the
</p>
<p>United States, and the original idea had its birth in the mind of the ex-
</p>
<p>Senator, Stephen W. Dorsey, and that the first steps towards itsexecu-
</p>
<p>370840
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>tion were taken fry him; that it was impossible to carry out the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy unless he got orders for the payment of money from the Treas-
</p>
<p>ury of the United States, which orders had to be for an extravagant
</p>
<p>and improper amount in order to make the conspiracy profitable, and
</p>
<p>that he obtained those orders from the Second Assistant Postmaster-
</p>
<p>General, and by corrupt means. The other parties were the pawns in
</p>
<p>the game. It was necessary to have bidders to get the contracts in
</p>
<p>form. .As Stephen W. Dorsey was then a Senator, he was forbidden by
</p>
<p>the statute of the United States to take a contract in his own name.
</p>
<p>It was necessary, therefore, to bring here to Washington the brother,
</p>
<p>who was a humble mechanic in Vermont; and the friend, who was en-
</p>
<p>gaged in some business in Ohio. It was necessary to use the name of
</p>
<p>the brother-in-law, who was lying sick with a disease which brought
</p>
<p>him to his grave, who was utterly unfit to attend to business, and who
</p>
<p>rarely, if ever, attended to anything in this matter except to sign his
</p>
<p>name to papers, many of them in blank, and all of them papers in the
</p>
<p>preparation of which we believe he took no active part. The conspir-
</p>
<p>acy, therefore, included the Senator, his representatives and dum-.
</p>
<p>mies, and it included the Second Assistant Postmaster-General, whose
</p>
<p>co-operation was necessary to enable the conspiracy to become success-
</p>
<p>ful financially. I said that the Senator was forbidden to take any con-
</p>
<p>tracts in his own name. The statute upon that subject is, I think, sec-
</p>
<p>tion 3739, and is as follows :
</p>
<p>Xo member of, or Delegate in Congress, shall directly or indirectly, himself or by
</p>
<p>any other person in trust for him, or for his use or benefit, or on his account, under-
</p>
<p>take, execute, hold, or enjoy, in whole or in part, any contract or agreement made or
</p>
<p>entered into in behalf of the United States by any officer or person authorized to make
</p>
<p>contracts 011 behalf of the United States.
</p>
<p>The belief of the Government is that we shall satisfy you that the
</p>
<p>Senator in form obeyed this statute, and that lie took no contracts in
</p>
<p>his own name, but took them in the names of his brother, his friend,
</p>
<p>and his brother-in-law. We shall show you that lie was interested in
</p>
<p>the contracts all the time. The contracts commenced on the 1st of
</p>
<p>July, 1878. On the 4th of March, 1879, he ceased to be a Senator and

</p>
<p>became ex-Senator, and within a brief ten or fifteen days after that time
</p>
<p>he became avowedly and admittedly interested in these contracts, which
</p>
<p>we say were obtained for his benefit long prior to that time and in vio-
</p>
<p>lation of the statute. We say that the conspiracy started at the very
</p>
<p>outset with a direct violation of another statute than the conspiracy
</p>
<p>statute I have read to you, to wit, the statute which forbade a Senator
</p>
<p>of the United States to have any interest in any contract, or to have
</p>
<p>any person hold an interest in his behalf or for him. This Senator, as
</p>
<p>we say, having conceived a scheme, and having brought his friends into
</p>
<p>it, went on and aided it in every way in his power, concealing his interest.
</p>
<p>He vised his position as United States Senator to write letters on official
</p>
<p>paper recommending the things necessary for the perfection of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy and its successful carrying out. He did all that until he ceased
</p>
<p>to be Senator, and then he became more openly participant in it.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, this indictment is confined to some nineteen
</p>
<p>contracts upon nineteen separate mail routes which were awarded at
</p>
<p>what is known as the letting of February, 1878, to take effect on the 1st
</p>
<p>of July, 1878, and to be for four years. Those contracts were let after
</p>
<p>public advertisement, and were subject to competition with other bidders.
</p>
<p>They aggregated in amount $41,135 a year. The contractors were to
</p>
<p>perform the mail service called for under those contracts for that sum.
</p>
<p>Under the fostering orders of the Second Assistant Postmaster-General,
</p>
<p>Thomas J. Brady, the contracts within about two years after they were
</p>
<p>obtained were so transformed that they required that there should be
</p>
<p>paid by the Government of the United States for the performance of the
</p>
<p>service under them $-448,670.90. Contracts starting at $41,135 were ill
</p>
<p>two years run up to $448,670. You will bear in mind that these were an-
</p>
<p>nual sums, and the contracts had an average of about three years to run
</p>
<p>at these increased rates. So the result of the whole thing was, bringing it
</p>
<p>down to very close figures, that the orders Mr. Brady made in behalf of
</p>
<p>these gentlemen on these nineteen routes alone were to cost the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment during the period the contracts ran between nine hundred thousand
</p>
<p>and a million dollars in excess of the original sum. That shows you, in
</p>
<p>this case, gentlemen, confining ourselves, for the moment, simply to the
</p>
<p>routes named in this indictment, that there was paid from the Treasury,
</p>
<p>under the improvident and corrupt orders of Mr. Brady unnecessarily
</p>
<p>and improperly made, close on to a million of dollars. When I say that
</p>
<p>I speak only of the nineteen contracts in this indictment. This combina-
</p>
<p>tion had a hundred and thirty four contracts in all, and upon them there
</p>
<p>were other large sums of money taken from the Treasury of the United
</p>
<p>States. The order of Mr. Brady that a contract should be increased
</p>
<p>was an absolute open sesame to the Treasury of the United States, and
</p>
<p>took from the Treasury the money that he said should be taken from
</p>
<p>it without the pow r er in any officer of the Government to say nay. If
</p>
<p>there was Mr. Brady's order that it should be paid out, that order was
</p>
<p>sufficient and it was paid.
</p>
<p>I have said these gentlemen were concerned in a hundred and thirty-
</p>
<p>four routes. There were other allowances made about the same time.
</p>
<p>There was a carnival of corruption in the Second Assistant Postmaster-
</p>
<p>General's office, as the result of which the Government are prepared to
</p>
<p>show you that the United States was defrauded of close on to $5,000,000.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that is a general outline of this case, and will give you
</p>
<p>some idea of its importance and the reason why those of us who are,
</p>
<p>concerned in it, whose duty it is to present to you the Government's
</p>
<p>views and the Government's evidence, feel at once the weight of the
</p>
<p>reponsibility under which we are laboring, and feel also the importance
</p>
<p>of your giving to this case your most careful attention. And you

</p>
<p>should bring to the decision of the case not only your careful attention,
</p>
<p>but your honest, unbiased judgment.
</p>
<p>The provisions of law applicable to this subject I will call to your
</p>
<p>attention. By section 388 of the Kevised Statutes of the United States,
</p>
<p>which relates to the organization of the Post-Office Department, it is pro-
</p>
<p>vided that
</p>
<p>There shall be at the seat of Government an Executive Department to be kno\yn
</p>
<p>as the Post-Office Department, and a Postmaster-General, who shall be the head thereof,
</p>
<p>and who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of.
</p>
<p>the Senate.
</p>
<p>By the next section it is provided that
</p>
<p>There shall be in the Post-Office Department three assistant postmasters-general,
</p>
<p>who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the
</p>
<p>Senate, and who may be removed in the same manner.
</p>
<p>Then there is the general provision of the Eevised Statutes, section
</p>
<p>161, which relates to all the executive departments of the Government :
</p>
<p>The head of each department is authorized to prescribe regulations, not inconsistent
</p>
<p>with law, for the" government of his department, the conduct of its officers and clerks,
</p>
<p>the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use, and preserva-
</p>
<p>tion of the records, papers, and property appertaining to it.
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>Under that authority to the Postmaster-General there have been,
</p>
<p>from time to time, various regulations made and various assignments
</p>
<p>and distributions of duty, the language of the statute being
</p>
<p>The distribution and performance of its business.
</p>
<p>Among other things there were assigned to the Second Assistant
</p>
<p>Postmaster -General the duties which 1 will read to you that you may see
</p>
<p>the breadth and scope of them. The copy of the regulations from which
</p>
<p>I read is the edition of July, 1879, but they were substantially the
</p>
<p>same regulations which prevailed before that time. These contracts
</p>
<p>were bid for in the fall of 1877, and were awarded in the winter of 1878,
</p>
<p>and commenced the 1st of July, 1878. Of course the regulations prior
</p>
<p>to 1879, as well as those of 1879, may come into play, but I think it will
</p>
<p>be found that in no point where they differ do they affect this case.
</p>
<p>Thomas J. Brady became Second Assistant Postmaster General on the
</p>
<p>23d of July. 1870, and lie continued as such down to about the 1st of
</p>
<p>April, 188lJ not long after the incoming of General Garfield's adminis-
</p>
<p>tration.
</p>
<p>The regulations of the Postmaster-General as to the distribution of
</p>
<p>duties to the Second Assistant Postmaster-General contain the follow-
</p>
<p>ing :
</p>
<p>THE OFFICE OF THE SECOND ASSISTANT POSTMASTER-GENERAL.
</p>
<p>To this office is assigned the business of arranging the mail service of the United
</p>
<p>States, and placing the same under contract, embracing all correspondence and pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings respecting the frequency of trips, mode of conveyance, and times of depart-
</p>
<p>ures and arrivals on all the routes, the course; of the mails between the different sec-
</p>
<p>tions of the country, the points of mail distribution, and the regulations for the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment of the domestic mail service of the United States. It prepares the advertise-
</p>
<p>ments for mail proposals, receives the bids, and has charge of the annual and miscel-
</p>
<p>laneous mail-lettiugs, and the adjustment and execution of all the contracts. All appli-
</p>
<p>cations for mail service or change of mail arrangements and for mail messengers
</p>
<p>should be sent to this office. All claims .should be submitted to it for transportation
</p>
<p>s'ervice. From this office all postmasters at the end of the routes receive the state-
</p>
<p>ment' of mail arrangements prescribed for the respective routes. It reports weekly to
</p>
<p>the auditor all contracts executed and all orders affect ing the accounts for mail trans-

</p>
<p>portation; prepares the Statistical exhibits of the mail service, and the reports to
</p>
<p>Congress of the mail-lettings, giving a statement of each bid; also of the contracts
</p>
<p>made, the new service originated, the curtailments ordered, and the additional allow-
</p>
<p>ances granted during the year. The rates of pay for the transportation of the mails
</p>
<p>on railroad routes, accordiugto the amount and character of the service', are adjusted
</p>
<p>by this office. It also directs the weighing of the mails on the same, and authori/es
</p>
<p>new service on railroad routes. The issuing of mail- locks and keys, mail-pouches and
</p>
<p>sacks, and the supervision of the construction of mail-bag catchers is also in charge
</p>
<p>of this office. To it is attached the division of inspection, to which is assigned the
</p>
<p>duty of receiving and inspecting the monthly registers of arrivals and departures, re-
</p>
<p>porting the performance of mail service; also special reports of failures or delinquen-
</p>
<p>cies on the part of mail contractors or their agents, and of noting such failures and
</p>
<p>delinquencies, and preparing cases of lines or deduct ions by reason thereof; of con-
</p>
<p>ducting the correspondence growing out of reports of failures or delinquencies in the
</p>
<p>transportation of the mails: of reporting to the Auditor of the Treasury for tin; Post-
</p>
<p>Office Department, at the closeof each quarter, by certificate of inspection, the fact of
</p>
<p>performance or non -performance of contract or recognized mail service, noting therein
</p>
<p>such lines or deductions as may have been ordered; of authorizing the payment of all
</p>
<p>employ6s of the railway mail service ; also the payment of such acting employes as
</p>
<p>may be employed by this office through t;he superintendent of railway mail service in
</p>
<p>cases of emergency, and of authorizing the auditor to credit postmasters with sums
</p>
<p>paid by them for such temporary service ; and such other duties as may be necessary
</p>
<p>to secure a faithful performance of the mail service. All complaiutsagainst mail con-
</p>
<p>tractors or their agents, relating to failures or other irregularities in the transporta-
</p>
<p>tion of the mails, whether made by postmasters or others, should be promptly for-
</p>
<p>warded to the Second Assistant Postmaster-General marked " Division of Inspection."
</p>
<p>You will therefore see, gentlemen, that to the Second Assistant Post-
</p>
<p>master-General is assigned the whole power over the transportation of
</p>
<p>the mails, the making of the contracts for them, the decision of the
</p>
<p>question whether the contractors perform their service properly or not,
</p>
<p>and the imposition of fines upon them if they have not performed them
</p>
<p>properly. You will also see as I go along, that by general language the
</p>
<p>Second Assistant Postmaster-General is given the right to make extra
</p>
<p>allowances in various forms, which extra allowances are practically the
</p>
<p>source of the fraud upon the Government of which we complain in this
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, bearing in mind these provisions that I have read
</p>
<p>to you, the condition of things under the statute, as we regard it, is
</p>
<p>this : It is the duty of the Postmaster- General to provide for the carry-
</p>
<p>ing of the mail. That duty is imposed in general terms upon the Post-
</p>
<p>master-General, and then, under the special power given by the statute
</p>
<p>which I have read to you, it is assigned by him to the Second Assistant
</p>
<p>Postmaster-General, and his power is plenary. The statute provides,
</p>
<p>however, some limitations and considerations which must prevail in
</p>
<p>connection with the question of carrying the mail, and amongst others
</p>
<p>is this. I read from section 3965 of the Revised Statutes:
</p>
<p>The Postmaster-General shall provide for carrying the mail on all post-routes es-
</p>
<p>tablished by law, as often as he, having due regard to productiveness, and other cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, may think proper.
</p>
<p>The discretionary power given to the Postmaster- General was trans-
</p>
<p>ferred to the Second Assistant Postmaster-General, but he is required
</p>
<p>to have u regard to productiveness and other circumstances." Pro-
</p>
<p>ductiveness is the only circumstance specified in the statute.
</p>
<p>The Second Assistant Postmaster- General having, we will suppose,
</p>
<p>decided that the mails are to be carried on a certain route and at
</p>
<p>a certain rate of speed, and a certain number of times a week, what
</p>
<p>is his duty and what is the scheme of the law as to how that plan shall
</p>
<p>be carried out? It is in general terms this: That the opportunity for
</p>
<p>carrying the mail shall be thrown open to the whole world ; that there
</p>
<p>shall be public advertisements inviting everybody to bid, and that when
</p>
<p>they do bid the contracts shall be awarded to the lowest bidder. The
</p>
<p>whole scheme and scope of the law is that as to all post-office contracts
</p>
<p>the service shall be thrown open to public competition, and contracts

</p>
<p>shall be awarded to the lowest bidder. There are also in the laws cer-
</p>
<p>tain provisions, which I shall read directly, which are intended to pro-
</p>
<p>vide for unforeseen contingencies which cannot be covered by the or-
</p>
<p>dinary advertisements. It was by a perversion of these that Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>and Mr. Dorsey and his associates succeeded in defrauding the United
</p>
<p>States. Section 3941 of the Revised Statutes, as it then stood, pro-
</p>
<p>vided :
</p>
<p>The Postmaster-General shall cause advertisements of all general mail lettings of
</p>
<p>each State and Territory to be conspicuously posted in each post-office in the State
</p>
<p>or Territory embraced in said advertisement for at least sixty days before the time of
</p>
<p>such general letting, and ;io other advertisement of such letting shall be required ;
</p>
<p>but this provision shall not apply to any other than geueral mail Jottings.
</p>
<p>Then, to meet the contingency, there comes section 3957, which pro-
</p>
<p>vides :
</p>
<p>Whenever, by reason of any error, omission, or other cause, any route which should
</p>
<p>properly be advertised for the regular letting is omitted, it shall be the duty of the
</p>
<p>Postmaster-General to advertise the same as soon as the error or omission shall be
</p>
<p>discovered, and the proposals for such route shall be opened as soon as possible after
</p>
<p>the other proposals in the same contract section ; and the contract made under such
</p>
<p>supplementary advertisement shall run, as nearly as possible, from the beginning to
</p>
<p>the end of the regular contract term, and during the time necessarily lost by reason
</p>
<p>of such error, omission, or other cause, the Postmaster-General shall provide for the
</p>
<p>carrying of the mail on such route at as low rate as possible without advertising.
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>You will see that this section, keeping up the spirit of the statute,
</p>
<p>provided that where anything has been accidentally omitted from the
</p>
<p>advertisement there shall be a supplemental advertisement throwing
</p>
<p>it open to public bidding, and that the Postmaster-General is author-
</p>
<p>ized to provide for the carrying of the mail on that omitted route only
</p>
<p>during the period when the new advertisement is running. Referring
</p>
<p>to a phrase which appears in that statute, it is proper for me to say to
</p>
<p>you. gentlemen, that under the practice of the Post-Office Department
</p>
<p>the whole country is divided into contract sections, and that what is
</p>
<p>known as the Pacific section, which covers substantially all the terri-
</p>
<p>tory west of the Mississippi River, is the section within which the routes
</p>
<p>were contained in connection with which the frauds alleged against
</p>
<p>these defendants were perpetrated. In these contract sections it is the
</p>
<p>practice for the convenience of the department to let the contracts at
</p>
<p>different times. All contracts run for four years, but they let the con-
</p>
<p>tracts last year for the Pacific section, perhaps next year for the New
</p>
<p>England section, and so on. The contracts in the Pacific section, to
</p>
<p>which these frauds relate, were let to take effect on the 1st of July,
</p>
<p>1878, and those contracts expired on the 30th of June, 1882, when new
</p>
<p>contracts were made for the Pacific section. By section 3958 it is pro-
</p>
<p>vided :
</p>
<p>Whenever it becomes necessary to change the terms of an existing contract for car-
</p>
<p>rying the mail otherwise than as provided
</p>
<p>in two other sections to which I will call your attention directly
</p>
<p>notice thereof shall be given and proceedings had thereon the same as at the letting
</p>
<p>of the original contract.
</p>
<p>Then by section 3944 of the Revised Statutes it is provided :
</p>
<p>Proposals for carrying the mail shall be delivered, sealed, and so kept until the
</p>
<p>bidding is closed, and shall then be opened and marked in the presence of the Post-
</p>
<p>master-General and one of the assistant postmasters-general or two of the assistant
</p>
<p>postmasters-general, or of any other two officers of the department, to be designated
</p>
<p>by the Postmaster-General.
</p>
<p>By section 3948 of the Revised Statutes it is provided that
</p>
<p>The Postmaster-General shall have recorded in a book to be kept for that purpose

</p>
<p>a true and faithful abstract of all proposals made to him for carrying the mail, giving
</p>
<p>the name of the party .offering, the terms of the offer, the sum to be paid, and the
</p>
<p>time the contract is to continue; and he .shall put on tile and preserve, the originals
</p>
<p>of all such proposals.
</p>
<p>Then section 3950 provides that-
</p>
<p>No contract for carrying the mail shall be made with any person who has entered,
</p>
<p>or proposes to enter, into any combination to prevent the making of any bid for car-
</p>
<p>rying the mail, or who has made any agreement, or given or performed', or promised
</p>
<p>to give or perform, any consideration whatever to induce any other person not to bid
</p>
<p>for any such contract; and if any person so offending is a contractor for carrying the
</p>
<p>mail his contract may be annulled.
</p>
<p>You will see running through all the same provision for public ad-
</p>
<p>vertisement, free, open bidding, and the imposition of penalties for any-
</p>
<p>thing which prevents free and public bidding. Then comes section
</p>
<p>3951 of the Revised Statutes. This section makes provision for a case
</p>
<p>where, after the award of the contract, the con tractor .does not take the
</p>
<p>service up. It provides for temporary service and new* advertisement :
</p>
<p>Whenever an accepted bidder shay fail to enter into contract, or a contractor on a
</p>
<p>mail route shall fail or refuse to perform the service on said route according to his
</p>
<p>contract, or when a new route shall be established, or new service required, or when
</p>
<p>from any other cause there shall not be a contractor legally bound or required to per-
</p>
<p>form such service, the Postmaster-General may make a temporary contract for carry-
</p>
<p>ing the mail on such route, without advertising, for such period as may be necessary,
</p>
<p>not exceeding six mouths.
</p>
<p>Therefore, if new service is required because of the refusal of the con-
</p>
<p>tractor after he has been awarded the contract to enter into it, or if he
</p>
<p>fails to perform the contract after he has entered into it, there is the
</p>
<p>right of the Postmaster- Gen era! to see that the mails are carried by
</p>
<p>temporary contract, which, however, can continue only six months. It
</p>
<p>is worth while perhaps, gentlemen, to show you how thoroughly the
</p>
<p>idea of public advertisement and open public bidding runs through all
</p>
<p>the postal laws, and to call your attention to the fact that when you
</p>
<p>come to a class of service where from the nature of the case there can-
</p>
<p>not be competition, such service is exceptedby special statute, leaving
</p>
<p>the remainder as it was before, and thus emphasizing the scheme. We
</p>
<p>all know that in railroad service there is ordinarily no opportunity for
</p>
<p>competition, because there is ordinarily only one railroad between given
</p>
<p>points. Therefore it is that special powers are given to the Postmaster ^
</p>
<p>General by sections 3942, 3956, and 3970, with reference to the railway
</p>
<p>mail service and steamboat service :
</p>
<p>The Postmaster-Genera] may enter into contracts for carrying the mail with rail-
</p>
<p>road companies without advertising for bids therefor.
</p>
<p>When from any cause it may become necessary to make a new contract for carry-
</p>
<p>ing the mails upon any water-route between ports of the United States upon which
</p>
<p>mail service has been previously performed, the Postmaster-General may contract
</p>
<p>with the owner or master of any steamer for carrying the said mail upon said route
</p>
<p>without advertising.
</p>
<p>Those are the provisions which, in connection with another provision
</p>
<p>as to steamboat routes, are, I think, the only provisions which give the
</p>
<p>Postmaster-General power to make contracts for carrying the mail with-
</p>
<p>out advertising and open public competition. You will excuse me if I
</p>
<p>emphasize the fact that you may plainly see the scheme to be one of ad-
</p>
<p>vertisement, an opportunity for free and open public bidding, and a pro-
</p>
<p>vision for the different contingencies in case of a contractor failing to
</p>
<p>enter into contract, or to carry it out, for temporary service extending
</p>
<p>simply over six months, and in this way making provision that the mail
</p>
<p>shall be carried, come what may. Now, these provisions, your own judg-
</p>
<p>ment will tell you, mean precisely what the Supreme Court has said in
</p>
<p>the case of Garfielde against The United States, in 3 Otto :

</p>
<p>The object of the statute was to secure notice of the intended post routes, of the
</p>
<p>service required, and the manner of its performance, that bidders might compete,
</p>
<p>that favoritism should be prevented, and that efficiency and economy in the service
</p>
<p>should be obtained.
</p>
<p>We think you will be satisfied before we get through how wise the
</p>
<p>statute was, because we shall show you overwhelmingly that when fa-
</p>
<p>voritism is allowed to come in efficiency and economy cease to exist in
</p>
<p>the service.
</p>
<p>This being the scope of the law. gentlemen, what were the duties of
</p>
<p>the Second Assistant Postmaster-General with reference to the arrange-
</p>
<p>ment to carry the mail "? Very obviously, first, to ascertain the proba-
</p>
<p>ble necessities of the service during the four years for which he was
</p>
<p>about to advertise. He had abundant means of ascertaining chose ne-
</p>
<p>cessities. He knew, in the first place, what the existing service was
</p>
<p>which was about to expire. He had postmasters at every town, each
</p>
<p>one of whom would certainly not err in understanding the amount of
</p>
<p>service required. Each man in his locality would certainly see that the
</p>
<p>claim of the locality to the requisite amount of service was brought to
</p>
<p>the notice of the Second Assistant Postmaster-General. Beside that
</p>
<p>the Second Assistant Post master- General is provided with a corps,
</p>
<p>known as post-office inspectors, whose business it is to go to the regions
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>in question and see precisely what the condition of the locality is, what
</p>
<p>service is required, how it is performed, and everything of that sort.
</p>
<p>They are his eyes. I want here to say that in view of the practice,
</p>
<p>which seems to prevail in these days, of assuming- that every branch of
</p>
<p>the public service is incompetent and corrupt, that I do not believe
</p>
<p>there is any private corporation or any private citizen who lias so effi-
</p>
<p>cient a corps of men under him as the corps of post office inspectors
</p>
<p>in the Post-Office Department of the United States, taking them as
</p>
<p>they have been certainly within the last two years. The Second
</p>
<p>Assistant Postmaster-General has these means of finding out how
</p>
<p>much service should be advertised for. Having ascertained that,
</p>
<p>it is his obvious duty, as an honest public officer, to advertise for
</p>
<p>all the service required, so as to submit it to public bidding. If he
</p>
<p>could advertise for only a portion of the service and then, under some
</p>
<p>of those laws which I have read to you, or under others to which I will
</p>
<p>directly call your attention, could, by private proceeding behind the
</p>
<p>door, arrange for contracts with other parties without competition, of
</p>
<p>course he could nullify the practical objects of the law. He must,
</p>
<p>therefore, advertise for all the service required. He must advertise for
</p>
<p>the number of trips per week which, according to the best information
</p>
<p>he can get, is likely to be required. He must advertise for the rate of
</p>
<p>speed which, according to the best information he can get, is proper for
</p>
<p>the locality. We all understand that in certain unfrequented regions
</p>
<p>and in certain mountainous countries it is very absurd to ask that the
</p>
<p>mail shall be carried without the aid of railroads, six, eight, or nine
</p>
<p>miles an hour. In certain regions it may be proper not to carry the
</p>
<p>mail at a higher rate of speed than three miles an hour. Perhaps I
</p>
<p>ought to say here in passing, that when it comes to speaking of service
</p>
<p>at a certain number of miles an hour, you must bear in mind that under
</p>
<p>the rules of the Post-Office Department when a .man is required to
</p>
<p>transport the mail at the rate of four miles an hour that includes all stop-
</p>
<p>pages, and that every postmaster at whose office he stops to leave and
</p>
<p>obtain mail is authorized to detain him not to exceed seven minutes; so
</p>
<p>that if there is a single post-office the hour would be reduced by seven

</p>
<p>minutes, and so on. Xo\v, if the Second Assistant Postmaster-General
</p>
<p>believes that four miles an hour is a proper rate of speed he has no
</p>
<p>right to advertise for three miles and then expect under some provis-
</p>
<p>ion of the law to increase it. He is bound also under the law which I
</p>
<p>read to you in fixing the proper amount of service to have regard to
</p>
<p>"productiveness and other circumstances," productiveness being the
</p>
<p>only circumstance specified. He must make up his mind upon that
</p>
<p>subject, and then, having made up his mind and having advertised and
</p>
<p>having received bids, he must award the contract to the lowest bidder.
</p>
<p>It is provided in section 3949 of the Kevised Statutes :
</p>
<p>All contracts for carrying mailsshnllbe in the name of the United States, and shall
</p>
<p>be awarded to the lowest bidder tendering sufficient guarantees for faithful perform-
</p>
<p>ance without other reference to the mode of transportation than may be necessary to
</p>
<p>provide for the due celerity, certainty, and securiry thereof.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in those three words, celerity, certainty, and security, we
</p>
<p>find the origin of the phrase " star route." Prior to 1845, I think, the
</p>
<p>Postmaster-General, in awarding contracts, was authorized to take into
</p>
<p>consideration other matters $ among other things, if I remember right, the
</p>
<p>conveniences that the contractor had for transporting passengers. This
</p>
<p>led to great abuses, and in that year there was passed a statute in which
</p>
<p>the words celerity, certainty, and security appear. And when contracts
</p>
<p>were awarded under that law and came to be carried on to the Post-Office
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>records, instead of putting in those three words, celerity, certainty, and
</p>
<p>security, they carried them on the books under three stars, hence came
</p>
<p>the phrase about which you will hear so much in this trial. 1 fear some
</p>
<p>of you may think you will hear too much about it.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. Your honor, this is the hour for-recess.
</p>
<p>The COURT. This seems to be a convenient time and we will take a re-
</p>
<p>cess for half an hour.
</p>
<p>Accordingly at this point (1 o'clock and 8 minutes p. m.) the court
</p>
<p>took its usual recess.
</p>
<p>AFTER REOESS.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bliss resumed his address as follows:
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen of the jury, notwithstanding all these provisions for
</p>
<p>advertising and for supplementary advertising and for temporary con-
</p>
<p>tracts the law looks to the possibility that there may still be some
</p>
<p>accident unprovided for by which the mails may fail to be carried, and
</p>
<p>it considers it necessary, therefore, to make further provision. It may
</p>
<p>be that the circumstances under which a contract is awarded the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances in the country through which the route runs may have
</p>
<p>changed, rendering it advisable to increase the number of trips per
</p>
<p>week, or to decrease the trips, or to increase the rate of speed, or de-
</p>
<p>crease the rate of speed. The condition of the country may change by
</p>
<p>a railroad penetrating the country which takes up the ordinary railway
</p>
<p>mail service, and necessarily dispenses with the star-route service which
</p>
<p>previously supplied the locality ; or it may be that' some mining region
</p>
<p>has been proved to be productive, and a population has rushed in there
</p>
<p>with the rapidity with which we know it has done in many of the Western
</p>
<p>States, and it may be necessary there to make additional mail service ;
</p>
<p>or a mine may ' play out," and it may be proper to reduce the service.
</p>
<p>There may be a dozen contingencies which may arise and which ex-
</p>
<p>perience shows do arise which may render it desirable in the eye of the
</p>
<p>law-maker, and wisely render it desirable, to make other provisions so
</p>
<p>that by no possibility should the real needs of any locality in mail service
</p>
<p>fail to be supplied. It may be also that after advertising, as I have al-
</p>
<p>ready called to your attention, a contractor fails to perform the service,
</p>

</p>
<p>or fails to enter into a contract, and there is a right given to make a.
</p>
<p>temporary contract; but there is another provision of law to meet that
</p>
<p>case, and that is section 3951 of the Revised Statutes, which provides
</p>
<p>that-
</p>
<p>Iii all cases of regular contracts hereafter made the contract may, in the discre-
</p>
<p>tion of the Postmaster-General, be continued in force beyond its express terms lor
</p>
<p>a' period not exceeding six months, until a new contract with the same or other
</p>
<p>contractors shall be made by the Postmaster-General.
</p>
<p>In other words, the Postmaster-General, under a contract about to
</p>
<p>expire on the 30th of June, 1878, could, under that provision of law, as
</p>
<p>of right, require it to be extended for six months at the same rate of
</p>
<p>pay, to give him time to make any arrangements for carrying the mail
</p>
<p>over the same route after the six months expired, if for any reason, by
</p>
<p>failure of advertising, or failure of the contractor to enter upon the
</p>
<p>service, or anything .else, the service is not performed under the ad-
</p>
<p>vertisement.
</p>
<p>Then we come, gentlemen, to other provisions, which are those which
</p>
<p>come chiefly in question in this case. There are two provisions taking
</p>
<p>their origin from one provision o f law, originally passed, I think, in 1825,
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>and subsequently separated and put into two, to which pro visions I now
</p>
<p>desire to call your attention. One of the provisions looks to providing
</p>
<p>for an increase of the number of trips per week. If a contract has been
</p>
<p>made, say, for three trips per week, one of the provisions looks to an in-
</p>
<p>crease of those trips possibly to seven trips a week, or to such number as
</p>
<p>may be decided by the Second Assistant Postmaster-General. The other
</p>
<p>provision looks to tne idea of increasing speed. Where a contract has
</p>
<p>been let at an average rate, say, of three miles an hour, it provides for
</p>
<p>increasing the s\>eed to, say, four miles an hour, and for the adjustment
</p>
<p>of the compensation. One of the increases is usually spoken of as an
</p>
<p>increase of trips or of service, while on the other hand the provision
</p>
<p>looking to' an increase of speed has come to be spoken of familiarly
</p>
<p>and you will constantly hear it in this case spoken of in that way
</p>
<p>as expedition ; increase of speed or expedition simply relates to the
</p>
<p>same number of trips as are provided for in the contract, but the
</p>
<p>making of them in less time than is provided for in the contract, while
</p>
<p>on the other hand the question of the increase of trips does not
</p>
<p>relate to speed, but only to the number of trips per week. You not
</p>
<p>infrequently "will find in the orders of the assistant postmaster gen-
</p>
<p>eral, to which I shall call your attention, that there is first an increase
</p>
<p>of speed and then an increase of expedition. Section 3M5() of the Re-
</p>
<p>vise d Statutes provides and let me say before I read this that you
</p>
<p>will notice as to both these provisions of law that they do not them-
</p>
<p>selves confer any power whatever. They simply limit a power which
</p>
<p>is recognized as existing, and jet it is a power which so far as I have
</p>
<p>been able to find has never been expressly conferred by statute, but
</p>
<p>has been by various statutes recognized as existing, and therefore is an
</p>
<p>undoubted power. Yet the statutory pro visions on the subject, it
</p>
<p>should be noted, are not provisions conferring the power. They are
</p>
<p>provisions recognizing it as an existing power and limiting its exercise.
</p>
<p>Section 31)00 provides that
</p>
<p>Extra compensation for additional service in carrying the mail shall not be in excess
</p>
<p>of the exact proportion which 1 he original compensation bears to the original service ;
</p>
<p>and when any such additional service, is ordered, the sum to be, allowed ther. -for shall

</p>
<p>be expressed in the order, and entered upon the books of the department; and no
</p>
<p>compensation shall be, paid lor any additional regular service, rendered before the
</p>
<p>issuing of such order.
</p>
<p>Now, you will perceive, gentlemen, that this provision simply limits
</p>
<p>the compensation.
</p>
<p>Compensation for additional service in carrying the mail shall not be in excess of
</p>
<p>the exact proportion which the original compensation bears to the original service.
</p>
<p>Under that the practice has grown up, and probably a correct prac-
</p>
<p>tice, that if there was a payment, for instance, of a thousand dollars a
</p>
<p>year for one trip a week, and the trips were then increased to two trips
</p>
<p>a week, this law is recognized as saying that the amount to be allowed
</p>
<p>when there are two trips shall not exceed two thousand dollars, two
</p>
<p>trips being twice as much as one trip, and two thousand dollars being
</p>
<p>twice one thousand dollars. The law provides that that limit, shall not
</p>
<p>be exceeded. It is not a provision, you will perceive, that they shall
</p>
<p>allow twice as much for double service, but only that they shall not
</p>
<p>exceed it. This provision gave rise to a phrase which you will con-
</p>
<p>stantly hear in the course of this trial, and that is pro rata. When it
</p>
<p>is said that so much increase is allowed, "being pro rata," it is intended
</p>
<p>to assert that where the service has been doubled the compensation is
</p>
<p>doubled, and where it has been trebled the compensation is trebled,
</p>
<p>and this allowance is pro rata.
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>That section relates, you will see, to an increase of trips. Section 3961 ,
</p>
<p>which I am about to read, relates to increase of speed. It introduces a
</p>
<p>little more complication into the statement and carries us back, to our
</p>
<p>school days when in arithmetic the rule of three was the stumbling
</p>
<p>block to a good many of us :
</p>
<p>No extra allowance shall be made for any increase of expedition in carrying the
</p>
<p>mail unless thereby the employment of additional stock and carriers is made neces-
</p>
<p>sary, and in such case the additional compensation shall bear no greater proportion
</p>
<p>to the additional stock and carriers necessarily employed than the compensation in
</p>
<p>the original contract bears to the stock and carriers necessarily employed in its execu-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>You will see, gentlemen of the jury, in the first place that there is no
</p>
<p>right to pay a cent of extra compensation unless the increase of speed
</p>
<p>necessarily involves the employment of additional stock and carriers. If
</p>
<p>it does involve the employment of additional stock and carriers, then you
</p>
<p>may not allow any more additional compensation than the compensation
</p>
<p>in the original contract bears to the stock and carriers necessarily em-
</p>
<p>ployed in its execution. As to the effect of that I shall have occasion to
</p>
<p>call your attention to it in a moment. But I now pause to remind you
</p>
<p>of the fact that these provisions of law complete the scheme of the Post-
</p>
<p>Office law r s so far as they relate to carrying the mails. First, ascertain
</p>
<p>what service is likely to be needed during the four years of the contract
</p>
<p>term. Then advertise for it. Advertise fully ; cover all the service there
</p>
<p>is reason to believe will be required. Award the contract to the lowest
</p>
<p>bidder. If an emergency arises, give a temporary contract under the
</p>
<p>provision allowing it to be done for six months, until an advertisement
</p>
<p>can be made, so as to open it to the lowest bidder, or meet the emer-
</p>
<p>gency if it occurs within six months after the commencement of the new
</p>
<p>contract term by extending the former contract at the same rate for six
</p>
<p>months ; or when these fail, meet it under these two last exceptional
</p>
<p>provisions to which I have referred relating to an increase of trips and
</p>
<p>to an increase of speed.
</p>
<p>You will see that under these there is a limitation that you shall not
</p>
<p>allow beyond a certain amount. It is not said who is to do it or any-

</p>
<p>thing about who is to decide whether there is to be an increase of serv-
</p>
<p>ice, who is to decide whether there is to be an increase of speed, nor
</p>
<p>who is to decide how much is to be allowed for compensation, either
</p>
<p>for increasing the service or increasing the speed. All that is covered
</p>
<p>by the general provision which I read to you which vests in the Second
</p>
<p>Assistant Postmaster-General the entire charge of everything con-
</p>
<p>nected with the transportation of the mails and the amount to be al-
</p>
<p>lowed therefor.
</p>
<p>These provisions Avhich I have read to you, called provisions for in-
</p>
<p>crease of service and increase of speed, we claim were intended to be
</p>
<p>exceptional provisions only to be resorted to in exceptional cases. I
</p>
<p>said on the last trial, and I can fairly repeat it here, that they were in-
</p>
<p>tended to be the medicine of the postal service, and that Brady made
</p>
<p>them his daily bread. He resorted to them constantly, habitually, un-
</p>
<p>necessarily, and corruptly. He based his action upon pretended evi-
</p>
<p>dence, showing the necessity of increased service, which evidence was
</p>
<p>not only false, but which he knew to be false, and which bore on its
</p>
<p>face the evidence of its own falsity. He based his action as to the
</p>
<p>allowances to be made for increased speed upon papers which were not
</p>
<p>only false, and which he must have known to be false, but which no
</p>
<p>man with sufficient capacity to read them would ever accept as genuine
</p>
<p>and proper documents to base action upon. He based his action upon
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>documents which were sworn to in blank. He based his action upon docu-
</p>
<p>ments full of erasures and changes, all of those erasures and changes
</p>
<p>being made in the precise spots and in the precise manner where they
</p>
<p>would take the greatest amount of money from the Treasury if they
</p>
<p>were accepted as genuine. He went to the extreme limit of the law.
</p>
<p>Where the law said you shall not allow more than a certain amount for
</p>
<p>increase of service he habitually, yes, uniformly, almost without excep-
</p>
<p>tion, went to the ^extreme limit of the law, when it is perfectly obvious
</p>
<p>that there was no justification even if the service was to be increased,
</p>
<p>in paying so much for it. Accepting the statements which were made
</p>
<p>to him as to the number of stock and carriers necessary to make in-
</p>
<p>creased speed, accepting those, alte red as they were, cheating, as they
</p>
<p>were obviously intended to be, as true, he went to the extreme limit of
</p>
<p>the amount that the law allowed to be given for increased speed.
</p>
<p>Moreover the law expressly says, and I read it to you again:
</p>
<p>No compensation shall be paid for aiiy additional service rendered before the issu-
</p>
<p>ing of the order.
</p>
<p>Yet he made orders which expressly and on their face provided for
</p>
<p>the allowance of compensation for weeks previous to the ia date of the
</p>
<p>order. Probably we shall confine our evidence on that subject to 'two
</p>
<p>or three instances ; it may be to one. The one I have in my mind will
</p>
<p>show conclusively that there was an order by which compensation was
</p>
<p>directed to be allowed at a large amount for some six or eight weeks
</p>
<p>prior to its date, directly in the face of this statute. Though there is for
</p>
<p>a portion of that service and a portion of that time some reason to claim
</p>
<p>that a .telegraphic dispatch might be treated as a prior order, yet ac-
</p>
<p>cepting the dispatch as all that can be claimed, Mr. Brady still, in that
</p>
<p>case, made the order expressly allowing a large amount of compensa-
</p>
<p>tion from a period prior to the date of any order that was issued, and in
</p>
<p>direct and express violation of the statute. We say, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, that Mr. Brady made these orders unnecessarily, improvidently,
</p>
<p>corruptly ; that he directly benefited by them, and that he made them
</p>
<p>at the instigation of and divided the profits of the transaction with some
</p>
<p>or all of the other defendants. He so acted, as I said at the outset,

</p>
<p>and that action was entirely under these two provisions, the provision
</p>
<p>for increase of service and the pro vision for increase of speed. He so
</p>
<p>acted under those provisions of law that the original contracts, having
</p>
<p>been made with these parties by which they were to receive $41,155 a
</p>
<p>year for performing the service on these nineteen mail routes, they were
</p>
<p>run up, without advertising and by virtue of the secret arrangement with
</p>
<p>Brady, so that he allowed to them $448,670 90 a year. He multiplied
</p>
<p>them considerably more than ten times over, and he did that, as we
</p>
<p>say, by availing himself of these exceptional provisions of law and in-
</p>
<p>troducing a practice into the Post-Office Department which had never
</p>
<p>prevailed there before, to wit, the practice of using these provisions con-
</p>
<p>stantly, and as I said, as the daily bread of the postal service instead of
</p>
<p>its occasional food or medicine. We shall show you, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, that under John L. Routt, who was Second AssiNtant Postmaster-
</p>
<p>General from the 1st of January, 1872, to the 30th of June, 1875, being
</p>
<p>three years and a half, there were in those three years and a half but
</p>
<p>fifteen cases in which resort to this provision as to increase of speed
</p>
<p>was had ; that under James N. Tyuer, who was Mr. Brady's immediate
</p>
<p>predecessor, and who was in office for a year
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. [Interposing.] Mr. Bliss
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Continuing] there were but five cases of expedition.
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. Your honor, I ask that Mr. Bliss may stop. He pays
</p>
<p>no attention to me.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I did not hear the counsel.
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. I tried to make myself heard. I understood that on
</p>
<p>the former trial of this case an offer to compare the administration of
</p>
<p>the Post-Office Department and its business with former and subse-
</p>
<p>quent administrations was not permitted by your honor as a rule of
</p>
<p>determining whether this business was properly or corrupt!}' conducted ;
</p>
<p>and inasmuch as the gentleman is pursuing that same theory now and
</p>
<p>undertaking to compare what was done under the administration of
</p>
<p>General Brady with an administration which preceded him, we say it
</p>
<p>is not a subject of proof, and it is not a subject of statement before the
</p>
<p>jury, and we object to it.
</p>
<p>The COURT. It may or may not be competent. The proper time has
</p>
<p>not come to make that point.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I simply say that it is proper evidence, and we shall claim
</p>
<p>it to be proper evidence, as showing that Mr. Brady introduced a new
</p>
<p>practice, and shall ask the jury to infer from that, in connection with
</p>
<p>other evidence, that it was done improperly.
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. If your honor please, it cannot be any evidence of a
</p>
<p>crime that one administration
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Interposing.] The point has been ruled upon, and I ob-
</p>
<p>ject to further interruption.
</p>
<p>The COURT. I cannot undertake to pass upon Mr. Chandler's ques-
</p>
<p>tion now.
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. I only raise the point because your honor ruled it out
</p>
<p>before. ^
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. He has ruled it in now.
</p>
<p>The COURT. This ca'se is being tried de novo, and I must decline to
</p>
<p>restrict counsel.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Gentlemen of the jury, I told you that Mr. Koutt in three
</p>
<p>years and a half had only fifteen cases of expedition, and that Mr. Tyner
</p>
<p>in a year had only five cases of expedition. Mr. Brady came into office
</p>
<p>on the 23d day of July, 1876. Prior to the 30th of June, 1877, being

</p>
<p>less than one year, he had had fourteen cases of expedition, or one less
</p>
<p>than Mr. Eoutt had in three years and a half. M r. Brady, in the year from
</p>
<p>June 30, 1878, to June 30, 1879, had seventy cases of expedition ; and
</p>
<p>in the period from the 23d of July, 1876, to the 30th of April, 1881,
</p>
<p>being four years and nine months, Mr. Brady resorted to this statute
</p>
<p>as to expedition in one hundred and twenty distinct and separate cases,
</p>
<p>while Mr. Eoutt and Mr. Tyner together, in four years and six months
</p>
<p>just about the same time resorted to it only in twenty cases. We
</p>
<p>shall ask you, gentlemen, in connection with other evidence upon that
</p>
<p>subject, to say that Mr. Brady coming into office in the way he did,
</p>
<p>and finding this exceptional instrumentality, which had previously been
</p>
<p>resorted to only in exceptional cases, used it improperly and wrongfully.
</p>
<p>He went to work and availed himself of it to the extreme and great
</p>
<p>extent that I have mentioned, and we shall ask you to infer from that,
</p>
<p>in connection with other evidence, that Mr. Brady's course was dictated
</p>
<p>by improper motives.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, let me call your attention to one single effect
</p>
<p>that the resort to that practice had upon the Government. When an
</p>
<p>advertisement is made for a postal contract it is provided that the con-
</p>
<p>tractor shall enter into a bond. That bond is made to bear a certain
</p>
<p>fair proportion to the amount paid for service upon that same route
</p>
<p>during the previous con tract term. If the payment for service upon the
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>route, for instance, be $2,500 a year the bond will be $1,500, or something
</p>
<p>of that kind. The bond is necessary to the Government for this reason:
</p>
<p>If a contractor gets a contract at the lowest rate he may be several hun-
</p>
<p>dred dollars below the next bidder. He enters into service and com-
</p>
<p>mences it, and then fails to perform it. He is declared a failing con-
</p>
<p>tractor. The Post-Office Department then has to make an arrangement
</p>
<p>with some other man, and uniformly is compelled to pay an increased price
</p>
<p>for the service. They have then to look to the bond of the original con-
</p>
<p>tractor lor the amount that they have lost thereby ; but they can only
</p>
<p>resort to that bond for the amount specified in it. We shall show you
</p>
<p>routes in this indictment where the original contract sum was less than
</p>
<p>$2,500, I think I am right in saying that, where the bond required was
</p>
<p>about $1,500, and where, under the orders of Mr. Brady, the amount al-
</p>
<p>lowed for service was run up within a year to about $50,000, and yet all
</p>
<p>that the Government had after the increase w.as a paltry bond of $1,500,
</p>
<p>adequate to the original bid, but not at all adequate to the increased com-
</p>
<p>pensation. 1 call your attention to that merely as showing that under
</p>
<p>the provisions of the law, by applying this exceptional power as to expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, Mr. Brady put the Government in a position to suffer great loss
</p>
<p>without the possibility of resorting to that protection which the law in-
</p>
<p>tended the Government should have for the enforcement of the con-
</p>
<p>tracts for mail service.
</p>
<p>You will see as to this provision for increase of trips that the statute
</p>
<p>says the Postmaster-General shall not pay in excess of the exact pro-
</p>
<p>portion which the original compensation bears to the original cost. If
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady, or any Second Assistant Postmaster-General, habitually vio-
</p>
<p>lates the law in this respect, if he does it without due inquiry, if he
</p>
<p>does it in cases where increase of service is obviously unnecessary, if
</p>
<p>he allows for it excessive sums, all that is necessarily and positively
</p>
<p>proof of misconduct of some nature on his part. All you gentlemen, as
</p>
<p>business men, must know that an increase of trips does not neces-
</p>
<p>sarily nor ordinarily involve a proportionate increase of the price ;
</p>
<p>that if a man has undertaken to carry the mail once a week
</p>
<p>and is called upon to carry it twice a week, it does not cost him

</p>
<p>twice as much money to do it. Take a short route, for illustration, that
</p>
<p>is gone over in a day. You have to have your horses and your wagons,
</p>
<p>and it will not cost you twice as much to go over that route twice a
</p>
<p>week as it will to go over it once. Suppose it is a route that you are
</p>
<p>required to run over once a week each way, which will take your horses
</p>
<p>two days in a week, and all the rest of the time they are standing and
</p>
<p>" eating their heads off," to use a common expression. If you are called
</p>
<p>upon to go over that route four times a week instead of twice, you will
</p>
<p>see plainly that doubling the trips does not double the price. But if
</p>
<p>the contractor is lucky enough to have some convenient Brady make a
</p>
<p>secret order about it he can get his pay doubled when his service is
</p>
<p>doubled. We all understand that on the longer routes there are other
</p>
<p>expenses the expense of supervision, the expense of rent, of stables,
</p>
<p>the expense of hostlers, and many other expenses which are not doubled
</p>
<p>in such a case. All of you, as business men, know that it will not cost
</p>
<p>you twice as much to keep two horses in your stable as to keep one.
</p>
<p>There is not any question about that. Yet we shall show you by evi-
</p>
<p>dence in connection with the very cases in this indictment, that
</p>
<p>although Mr. Brady and these defendants knew these facts, they
</p>
<p>habitually and constantly, for their own benefit, acted in viola-
</p>
<p>tion of that knowledge; and that Mr. Brady allowed sums which
</p>
<p>he knew to be in excess of the fair cost for the increase of serv-
</p>
<p>ice. We shall show you that these defendants themselves recognized
</p>
<p>it, recognized it by documents formally executed, and which they
</p>
<p>placed upon the Hies of the department. There is a provision of the law
</p>
<p>to which I shall have occasion to call your attention by and by, known
</p>
<p>as the subcontract law, under which, when a mail contractor not carry-
</p>
<p>ing the mail for himself, arranges with somebody in the locality to carry
</p>
<p>it, and makes a suocontract with him, that subcontract can by the sub-
</p>
<p>contractor be placed on tile in the department. These subcontracts
</p>
<p>to which I am going to call your attention were on file in Mr. Brady's
</p>
<p>office, and showed Mr. Brady that these defendants themselves recog-
</p>
<p>nized the fact that an increase of trips did not necessarily or ordinarily
</p>
<p>involve a proportionate increase of expense. For instance, we shall
</p>
<p>show you one case where the subcontract made by these defendants
</p>
<p>with a subcontractor in the locality, provided that the subcontractor
</p>
<p>should be allowed $1,400 a year lor one trip, if there were two trips
</p>
<p>that he should be allowed $2,000 a year, and if there were three trips
</p>
<p>that he should he allowed $3,700. If there were six trips he was
</p>
<p>to be allowed $7,000, and if there were seven trips $7,500. I give
</p>
<p>you that particular instance, and I can readily refer you to others
</p>
<p>showing you that they are not exceptional. On another route we
</p>
<p>find by their subcontract that they allowed $700 for one trip, $1,300
</p>
<p>for two trips, $1,800 for three trips, and $3,300 for six trips. On an-
</p>
<p>other route they allowed for one trip $2,500 ; for two trips, $4,000, and
</p>
<p>for three trips, $5,100. On another route they allowed for one trip,
</p>
<p>$1,500; for two trips, $2,850; for three trips, $4,055, and for six trip*,
</p>
<p>$8,017. On another route they allowed for two trips, $5,500 ; for three,
</p>
<p>$7,500 ; for six, $ 15,001), and for seven, $17,000. The subcontracts made
</p>
<p>by these defendants for service upon these routes show that they recog-
</p>
<p>nized the fact that the increase of service did noc necessarily involve
</p>
<p>a corresponding increase of expense. Many of those subcontracts were on
</p>
<p>file in Mr. Brady's office convey ing that same information to him. Wesub-
</p>
<p>mitthat if he knew what he was bound to know if fit for his place, and what
</p>
<p>he was bound to know if he had any knowledge of the simplest business
</p>
<p>matters, that he should have used this knowledge for the benefit of the
</p>
<p>Government. Moreover, Congress has expressly recognized this principle

<p>in making appropriations years ago before we had any Pacific Railroad for
</p>
<p>transporting the mails overland to California. They put in the law a clause
</p>
<p>by which they provided $300,000 a year for semi-monthly service, $450,000
</p>
<p>a year for weekly service, and $(>00,000 a year for semi- weekly service.
</p>
<p>It is so obvious, so well known, that that must be the result, that I
</p>
<p>think we may almost say the court would take judicial notice of the
</p>
<p>fact. This being the condition of things, Mr. Brady habitually and
</p>
<p>uniformly, when he was making an order for increase of service, went to
</p>
<p>the extreme limit allowed by the law. We shall show you on the routes
</p>
<p>in this indictment, as far as increase of service is concerned, twenty-
</p>
<p>nine separate orders made under Mr. Brady. In twenty-six of them he
</p>
<p>deliberately and on their face provided that there should be allowed
</p>
<p>the extreme amount authorized under the law. When he increased one
</p>
<p>trip to three he multiplied the compensation by three. When he in-
</p>
<p>creased two tiips to six he multiplied it by three. For illustration, if
</p>
<p>the original compensation for one trip was $1,000 and he ordered seven
</p>
<p>trips, he allowed $7,000. That was almost his uniform practice, and
</p>
<p>that happened in twenty -six of the twenty-nine orders he made. The
</p>
<p>remaining three orders were cases in which he mixed up the sum he
</p>
<p>allowed for increase of speed and increase of trips so that it is
</p>
<p>d fficult to say how much was allowed for one and how much
</p>
<p>2GB
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>was allowed for the other. I think I shall be able to satisfy you
</p>
<p>that in two of those three cases he allowed for the increase of service
</p>
<p>the extreme amount which could by any possibility come in under the
</p>
<p>law. In twenty-eight of the twenty-nine orders made on the routes
</p>
<p>specified in this indictment Mr. Brady went to the extreme limit au-
</p>
<p>thorized by the law. You will bear in mind, gentlemen, that I am as-
</p>
<p>suming for the moment that the increases of service which Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>authorized were properly authorized, but 1 am calling yourattention to
</p>
<p>the fact that when Mr. Brady came to decide how much should be
</p>
<p>paid and the decision rested entirely with him he went uniformly to
</p>
<p>the extreme limit, and that is a thing which no honest, provident, and
</p>
<p>faithful officer could do under the circumstances.
</p>
<p>As to expedition or increase of speed you will bear in mind that,
</p>
<p>in the first place, no allowance of extra compensation is under the
</p>
<p>statute lawful unless by such increase of speed additional stock and
</p>
<p>carriers are necessary. If additional stock and carriers do not be-
</p>
<p>come necessary there can be no allowance whatever for the extra speed.
</p>
<p>We shall show you, gentlemen, cases where Brady did make large allow-
</p>
<p>ances for increase of speed, and yet we shall put upon the stand before
</p>
<p>you drivers who were carrying the mail over that route both before and
</p>
<p>after the extra allowances made by Mr. Brady; canying it on the
</p>
<p>original rate of speed, and on the increased rate of speed, and who will
</p>
<p>tell you that they did not use any additional stock or carriers, but that
</p>
<p>the identical horses and men went over that route day after day at the
</p>
<p>increased speed that went over it with the original speed j and yet
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady paid large sums for the i-xpeditiou. We wtall show you
</p>
<p>cases, gentlemen of the jury, where the unfortunate subcontractor went
</p>
<p>on doing this business, and though he had a provision in his subcon-
</p>
<p>tract by which, if the speed was to be increased, he was to get a certain
</p>
<p>percentage of the increased compensation allowed, these defendants
</p>
<p>went on drawing from the Post-Office Department the increase of com-
</p>
<p>pensation and paying him only his original compensation. The first
</p>
<p>knowledge some of these contractors had that the Government had ever
</p>
<p>allowed any additional amount was from the inspectors whom we sent

</p>
<p>out there to investigate in connection with this indictment. They in-
</p>
<p>formed the contractors that Messrs. Dorsey and others had, under the or-
</p>
<p>ders of Mr. Brady, been for years drawing thousands of dollars a year for
</p>
<p>additional compensation for service which the subcontractor had rendered
</p>
<p>at the original price and with the same horses and the same men. And
</p>
<p>here let me say, gentlemen of the jury, that you will find in this case
</p>
<p>that there was a great distinction between these defendants and many
</p>
<p>other people engaged in the mail service. That with a single exception
</p>
<p>they were not mail carriers ; that they did not go into this business
</p>
<p>with the idea of carrying the mail ; that they went into the business
</p>
<p>with the idea of getting contracts here at a low price, in many cases
</p>
<p>bidding lower than it was possible for the service to be rendered,
</p>
<p>lower than any honest bidder could bid, with the intention in the
</p>
<p>first place of arranging with some subcontractor in the locality to
</p>
<p>carry the mail. In carrying out that intention they arranged with
</p>
<p>these subcontractors not infrequently to pay them more than they
</p>
<p>themselves were getting from the Government. In such an event they
</p>
<p>took care immediately to obtain from Mr. Brady orders for expedition by
</p>
<p>which what were originally losing contracts to a small extent became at
</p>
<p>once most enormously profitable contracts. Of this additional amount
</p>
<p>which they got they gave to the subcontractor, who really performed
</p>
<p>the service, only an insignificant proportion. They kept all the rest
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>for themselves simply for their expenses in carrying on business in
</p>
<p>Washington ! We shall show to you in that connection some rather
</p>
<p>extraordinary things. As I said, the Second Assistant Postmaster-Gen-
</p>
<p>eral had 110 right to pay any increased compensation unless increased
</p>
<p>stock and carriers were required. Mr. Brady made allowances where
</p>
<p>no increased stock and carriers were allowed. Moreover, Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>made allowances even where increased stock and carriers were required
</p>
<p>greatly in excess of the proper amount. He constantly and habitually
</p>
<p>allowed sums in excess of the stock and carriers needed, and he allowed
</p>
<p>sums in excess of the stock and carriers which even were stated to be
</p>
<p>needed on the evidence before him. This provision as to stock and car-
</p>
<p>riers originated I think in the statutes in 1825. It was there a provis-
</p>
<p>ion both as to increase of service and increase of speed. It reads in
</p>
<p>this way:
</p>
<p>That no additional allowance shall be made by the Postmaster-General to the con-
</p>
<p>tractor or carrier of any mail, on any route, over and beyond the amount stipulated
</p>
<p>in the contract entered into for the transportation of the mail on such route, unless
</p>
<p>additional service shall be required; and then no additional compensation shall be
</p>
<p>allowed to exceed the exact proportion of the original amount to the additional duties
</p>
<p>required.
</p>
<p>After this statute had been in force some ten or twelve years there came
</p>
<p>up a post-office scandal, and the question was raised as to whether the
</p>
<p>statute of 18.J5 applied not only to increase of service but also to in-
</p>
<p>crease of speed. There was an investigation in Congress on that sub-
</p>
<p>ject, and it seems to me to have been unlike an investigation to which
</p>
<p>I shall have occasion to call your attention a thorough one and there-
</p>
<p>upon there came reports irom Congress and reports from the Post-
</p>
<p>master General.
</p>
<p>The Postmaster-General at that time said :
</p>
<p>For expediting the mail in point of time there can be no rule for determining the
</p>
<p>pro rata. The actual increase of expense, agreeable to an ancient provision made
</p>
<p>in contracts, is the rule which governs. It is frequently done at a less rate, but when
</p>
<p>that full rate is demanded some evidence of the increased expense is required before
</p>
<p>the allowance is made.

</p>
<p>Congress said:
</p>
<p>All that is necessary is to ascertain the expense of the original service and what
</p>
<p>will be the expense of the additional service. The rule would then be: As the
</p>
<p>amount of the expense of the original service is to the compensation therefor, so is
</p>
<p>the amount of the expanse of the additional service to the pro rata additional allow-
</p>
<p>ances.
</p>
<p>That was the view which was taken in Congress and by the then Post-
</p>
<p>master-General as to the provisions then applicable to the subject.
</p>
<p>In this case we shall show you that upon the routes in this indict-
</p>
<p>ment Mr. Brady made fifteen orders for expedition. There are nineteen
</p>
<p>routes in the indictment and he made fifteen orders. Twelve of the or-
</p>
<p>ders on their face purport to make allowances up to the full limit, gauging
</p>
<p>that limit by the alleged evidence he had before him. That is to say,
</p>
<p>if he had a statement before him that a certain number of stock
</p>
<p>and carriers was then actually required and that a certain number
</p>
<p>would be required, he applied the rule of three laid down in the
</p>
<p>statute to it and gave the extreme limit. I shall have occasion to
</p>
<p>call your attention presently to the absurdity of that evidence that he
</p>
<p>had before him on the three remaining orders. In one case he allowed
</p>
<p>less than the limit. Taking all the time the evidence on which he
</p>
<p>claimed to base his action the amount less than the limit in one case
</p>
<p>was merely nominal. In another case it was only $1,300. In a third
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>case it was very large; but it was large because of the monumental
</p>
<p>swearing of one of the defendants in this case, John K. Miner, who
</p>
<p>swore that an increase of trips would require an addition of one hun-
</p>
<p>dred and fifty men and one hundred and fifty horses, when his counsel
</p>
<p>will not dare to pretend before you that there were any additional men
</p>
<p>more than forty necessary. Yet Mr. Brady makes his order in that
</p>
<p>case as being less than the limit, or less than pro rat a, as he chooses
</p>
<p>to put it, because he accepts Mr. Miner's monumental perjury of one
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty men as true. Gauged by that, it is less than pro
</p>
<p>rata. Gauged by what was necessary, it is greatly in excess of pro
</p>
<p>rata. I shall have occasion to call your attention to some other things
</p>
<p>in connection with that affidavit.
</p>
<p>I have said that this evidence upon which Brady chose to act in
</p>
<p>making his allowances for increase of speed was false. Much of it
</p>
<p>was absurdly, transparently false. Assuming that an application was
</p>
<p>made to the Second Assistant Postmaster-General for an increase of
</p>
<p>speed on a given route, what would he as an honest, faithful officer do?
</p>
<p>Would he not ascertain how much stock and how many carriers were then
</p>
<p>actually employed in the first place, and could he not readily ascertain
</p>
<p>that by sending to the postmasters upon the route ; by getting state-
</p>
<p>ments from the men who were carrying the mail over the route, and if
</p>
<p>need be by sending one of his inspectors to find it out? Having ascer-
</p>
<p>tained that as a fact he has one of the elements necessarily entering
</p>
<p>into the question as to how much should be allowed. There was no
</p>
<p>difficulty in finding that out, gentlemen. It involved no trouble to Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady. It involved no expense to the Government, and is it not the
</p>
<p>obvious, the natural thing to do to find it out, and to find it out on the
</p>
<p>spot, from the people who were carrying the mails, how many men and
</p>
<p>horses they were using in so doing ? Would it occur to anybody to
</p>
<p>make that inquiry of the men who were here in Washington, who never
</p>
<p>were on the route, who knew nothing about it, to find out from them
</p>
<p>what they said was the number of stock and carriers then employed,
</p>
<p>and to accept their statement as final and conclusive? Would any or-
</p>
<p>dinary business man think of doing a thing of that sort? And let me

</p>
<p>show you here, gentlemen, just the importance of this condition of
</p>
<p>things. The statute says :
</p>
<p>The additional compensation shall bear no greater proportion to the additional
</p>
<p>stock and carriers necessarily employed than the compensation in the original
</p>
<p>contract hears to the stock and carriers necessarily employed in its execution.
</p>
<p>You have to find out how many are employed at the moment under
</p>
<p>the original contract, and then how many will probably be employed
</p>
<p>under the increased speed. One is a question of fact, the other a mat-
</p>
<p>ter of opinion. Now, suppose a contract provides that they shall carry
</p>
<p>the mail three miles an hour at $5,000 a year, and it is proposed to make
</p>
<p>an increase of that rate to four miles an hour. The question of course
</p>
<p>is how much additional stock and carriers are necessary. If in fact on
</p>
<p>the existing rate of speed it requires ten men and carriers, while it will
</p>
<p>take on the increased rate of speed twenty men and carriers, then by the
</p>
<p>rule of three laid down in the statute, $5,000 being the sum allowed for
</p>
<p>the original service, $10,000 would be the sum allowed for the increased
</p>
<p>service, because it takes twice as many horses and carriers on the in-
</p>
<p>creased speed as upon the original speed.
</p>
<p>But accepting that as the true state of the fact, suppose that in
</p>
<p>making up the calculation instead of taking those items, and instead of
</p>
<p>saying that it now takes ten men and horses to carry the mail on that
</p>
<p>route, Mr. Brady says it now takes five men and horses to carry the
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>mail on that route, and it will take twenty men and horses on the in-
</p>
<p>creased service. In that way he has understated the number of men
</p>
<p>and horses by five, just half, and he is taking the increased number of
</p>
<p>men and horses as the same in each case. What is the result! The"
</p>
<p>result is that instead of allowing $10,OUO for the increased speed where
</p>
<p>$5,000 was the original allowance, Mr. Brady allows $20,000 when he
</p>
<p>should have allowed $10,000. He has doubled the amount taken from
</p>
<p>the Treasury by the simple expedient of understating by one-half the
</p>
<p>number of men and horses whicli were then actually used.
</p>
<p>You see, gentlemen, the importance of getting at that fact, and get-
</p>
<p>ting at it accurately: " How many men and horses are now used when
</p>
<p>I am about to make this order for increase of speed is the question,
</p>
<p>because if I understate the number of men and horses, then 1 allow
</p>
<p>from the Treasury a sum in excess of the legal amount." But the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment could be, and was, defrauded in the other way; that is,
</p>
<p>stating the number of men and horses that were used at the moment cor-
</p>
<p>rectly, say, when ten were then actually in use. In fact it would have
</p>
<p>taken twenty to perform the increased speed, but Mr. Brady estimated
</p>
<p>upon thirty, and in that way you tind, following out my comparison of
</p>
<p>$5,000, if Mr. Brady takes and states correctly the number of horses
</p>
<p>actually employed, but increases the number that will be employed to
</p>
<p>thirty instead of twenty, the result is that instead of allowing $10,000
</p>
<p>from the Treasury he allows $15,000, and on the face of the thing it is
</p>
<p>all pro rata. The rule of three works very well if his elements going to
</p>
<p>make it up are correct. It was in that way that Mr. Brady's most mag-
</p>
<p>nificent exploits were performed. He understated the number of men
</p>
<p>and horses actually employed then, and overstated the number of men
</p>
<p>and horses that would be employed. You will find that in place of
</p>
<p>$10,000 which could have been legitimately taken from the Treasury,
</p>
<p>$30,000 was the allowance, and yet on the face of the thing it was all
</p>
<p>straight; he had applied it all right and he had only gone to the limit;
</p>
<p>he said ft ve men and horses are now employed, when, in fact, ten were
</p>
<p>employed, and he said thirty would be employed, when in point of fact
</p>
<p>twenty were all that were needed for the increased speed. So that you

</p>
<p>will see, gentlemen, that these two little elements and this little arith-
</p>
<p>metical rule put into the statute gives the means by which by a slight
</p>
<p>change in figures the Government can be very largely defrauded. Put
</p>
<p>the original figare too small or the future figure too large as tothe num-
</p>
<p>ber of men and carriers arid you cheat the Government. Either put one
</p>
<p>too small or put the other too large and you cheat the Government. Put
</p>
<p>one too small and the other too large and you treble the cheat substan-
</p>
<p>tially.
</p>
<p>Now, what did Mr. Brady do in ascertaining these most important
</p>
<p>numbers? Did he do as any honest man would do, as any fair official
</p>
<p>would do ? Did he make any effort to find out what those numbers
</p>
<p>were? Did he send tothe locality and find out how many men and
</p>
<p>horses were then actually being used $ Did he inquire of people ex-
</p>
<p>perienced in the business', and not interested in the sums to be allowed,
</p>
<p>as to how many would be used on the increased service f No, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, he did this, and only this, and I want you to bear it in mind, for
</p>
<p>it is literally true: He went to the man who was to be benefited by
</p>
<p>the allowance, who was to get the money from the Treasury, and he
</p>
<p>received from him a brief affidavit not larger than that [exhibiting a
</p>
<p>folded paper], in which the man said that the number of stock and
</p>
<p>carriers now employed on a given route are so many, and the number
</p>
<p>that will be employed on an increase of speed will be so many. He
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>took the statement of that interested man as the sole evidence upon
</p>
<p>which he acted, and upon such affidavits he made orders under which
</p>
<p>he took thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars from the
</p>
<p>Treasury of the United States, and put them into the pockets of the
</p>
<p>men who made those affidavits, barring and excepting the toll that he
</p>
<p>took for his own pocket as he went along.
</p>
<p>I say, gentlemen, that that is literally true. We have searched in
</p>
<p>vain to find a case where Mr. Brady prior to making an order for in-
</p>
<p>crease of speed inquired of any human being how many men and
</p>
<p>horses were then being used on the route, or how many men and horses
</p>
<p>would be .used on the route, other than of the man who was to be di-
</p>
<p>rectly benefited by the order he was to make and who was therefore
</p>
<p>interested to misstate in both respects.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, if there were nothing else in this case than Mr. Brady's
</p>
<p>action in that way upon those papers we should ask you to say that
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady had so acted as to deserve from you a verdict of guilty,
</p>
<p>But there is. gentlemen, much more than this. There appears in the
</p>
<p>Regulations of the Post Office Department, published in the year 1879,
</p>
<p>a provision which was obviously enforced by Mr. Brady prior to that
</p>
<p>date, and yet we are unable to say when it was first applied. It does
</p>
<p>not appear in the Regulations of the Post-Office Department published
</p>
<p>in 1873. It does appear in those published in 1879. It was applied by
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady, or availed of by Mr. Brady, in every expedition that he
</p>
<p>made after he came into office in July, 1876. While I do not think it
</p>
<p>was used before that time I am not prepared to assert that it was not.
</p>
<p>It may possibly have been in existence before that time, but it was not
</p>
<p>ordinarily used. That provision is this :
</p>
<p>When it becomes necessary to increase the speed on any route the contractor will
</p>
<p>l>e required to state under oath the number of horses and men required to perform the
</p>
<p>service according to contract schedule and the number required to perform it with the
</p>
<p>proposed increase of speed.
</p>
<p>That provision is of course a very proper provision to be made in
</p>
<p>such a case that the contractor who is to be benefited should be re-
</p>
<p>quired to give his own statement, and to give it under oath, of the

</p>
<p>number of men and horses he is then using and the number that he
</p>
<p>believes he will use. But I ought to call your attention to one fact. This
</p>
<p>regulation speaks of the number of men and horses that will be used.
</p>
<p>The statute speaks of the number of stock and carriers, and in the prog-
</p>
<p>ress of this case you will see that it will be claimed that this regula-
</p>
<p>tion is broader than the statute, because while the statute says you can
</p>
<p>only take the number of stock and carriers engaged in carrying the
</p>
<p>mail, in your estimate under this provision, which it is claimed is broader
</p>
<p>than the statute, you can take men who were employed as hostlers
</p>
<p>and everybody else who was directly or indirectly engaged in the mail
</p>
<p>carrying, even to the extent of reckoning in the men who were employed
</p>
<p>in driving the wagons that hauled the oats on which the horses were
</p>
<p>fed, though they never saw or touched a mail. That regulation, if
</p>
<p>it is thus broader than the law, was habitually resorted to by Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady, and, if thus broader than the law, is very clearly an illegal regu-
</p>
<p>lation. Yet it was a very proper regulation in some form to get from the
</p>
<p>contractor his statement, as the party-interested, of what he claimed it
</p>
<p>would be. Of course we all know that human nature is weak, and that
</p>
<p>if we were to be benefited by an increase of compensation we should
</p>
<p>be apt to be pretty liberal. We probably would try to state correctly
</p>
<p>the number of men and horses we are now using, but I think our judg-
</p>
<p>ment would be a good deal biased in getting at the number we should
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>be likely to use; and tliat ought always to be borne in mind in refer-
</p>
<p>ence to this matter. But Mr. Brady, under that regulation, took from
</p>
<p>the contractor, or claimed to take from the contractor, his affidavit of
</p>
<p>the number actually used, and the number that would be used, and he
</p>
<p>took nothing else. He took that affidavit of the contractor. He sought
</p>
<p>no evidence anywhere else, and upon the basis of that affidavit he
</p>
<p>made his orders allowing to the contractor the extreme limit which
</p>
<p>that affidavit showed him entitled to. And he said that was a fair and
</p>
<p>provident administration of the Post-Office Department of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>But not only that, you will bear in mind that this affidavit says that
</p>
<p>the contractor will be required to state under oath the number of
</p>
<p>horses and men required. But when it suited Mr. Brady's conven-
</p>
<p>ience, when these defendants wanted their order for expedition, so that
</p>
<p>their increased pay might commence promptly, and the contractor was
</p>
<p>probably not available to 'make the affidavit, they quietly had some-
</p>
<p>body else make the affidavit and Mr. Brady accepted it. If that some-
</p>
<p>body else had been somebody who had been on the route, who knew
</p>
<p>anything about it, there might have been some justification for it.
</p>
<p>But the order was made upon the affidavit of somebody who had
</p>
<p>no connection with the route, who had never been near the route, and
</p>
<p>knew nothing about it. I do not wish to make a general statement of
</p>
<p>that kind without referring to specified items. I am referring only to
</p>
<p>routes in this indictment
</p>
<p>On the route from Pueblo to Eosita, No. 38134, the contract was the
</p>
<p>contract of John II. Miner, one of these defendants. So far as the
</p>
<p>Post-Office Department knew, outside of the illegitimate knowledge
</p>
<p>which Thomas J. Brady had, John E. Miner was the only person con-
</p>
<p>nected with that contract for carrying the mails. Yet, when they wanted
</p>
<p>to increase the compensation, Mr. John W. Dorsey, another of these
</p>
<p>defendants, unknown to the Post-Office Department so far as this route
</p>
<p>was concerned, made the affidavit called for by that regulation. Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady accepted it as conclusive, and upon that affidavit made the or-
</p>
<p>der for an allowance of a large amount of extra compensation.

</p>
<p>On route 38140, from Trinidad to Madison, John E. Miner was in like
</p>
<p>manner the contractor. Did he make the affidavit! And let me say,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, you will find in the progress of this case that it was not
</p>
<p>from inability to swear that Mr. Miner did not make the affidavit in this
</p>
<p>case. Instead of his making the affidavit in the case Mr. John W. Dor-
</p>
<p>sey again came to the front and made the affidavit which Brady took
</p>
<p>as a sufficient voucher for taking from the Treasury a large amount of
</p>
<p>money.
</p>
<p>On the route from Vermillion to Sioux City, No. 35015, the contractor
</p>
<p>was the same John E. Miner, I think. I do not remember who the
</p>
<p>contractor was there. Whoever the contractor was, Mr. Harvey M.
</p>
<p>Vaile, another of these defendants, who was the subcontractor, made
</p>
<p>the affidavit upon a sheet of note paper with the heading of the National
</p>
<p>Hotel upon it. He made it in this city, and made it when he never had
</p>
<p>been upon the route and never knew anything about it, except that he
</p>
<p>was going to make by that affidavit a good, round, handsome profit. He
</p>
<p>made that affidavit as subcontractor, though it was not in accordance
</p>
<p>with the regulation at all, and Mr. Brady accepted it and took it as his
</p>
<p>sole basis for his order taking money from the Treasury.
</p>
<p>On route 38113, from Eawlius to White Eiver, in like manner Mr.
</p>
<p>Perkins, the subcontractor, made the affidavit ; but Mr. Perkins had
</p>
<p>this advantage over anybody else in this case who made an affidavit
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>upon which Brady acted : Mr. Perkins had been on the route. No other
</p>
<p>human being who made one of these affidavits upon which Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>acted had at the time he made the affidavit ever been upon the route to
</p>
<p>which it related or had any knowledge as to the number of men and
</p>
<p>horses actually employed, and, other than Mr. Vaile, none of them had
</p>
<p>by experience a right to say how many would be needed, for none of
</p>
<p>them other than Mr. Yaile had ever been a mail contractor. They were
</p>
<p>nothing, gentlemen, but a set of speculators in mail contracts, and never
</p>
<p>expected to carry the mails, but expected to get the contracts at a
</p>
<p>low price, get them expedited, and get the service performed by sub-
</p>
<p>contractors, to whom they would pay an insignificant proportion from
</p>
<p>the amount that they drew from the Treasury of the United States.
</p>
<p>What is the result of allowing such affidavits, so made by these par-
</p>
<p>ties, to be accepted ? Why, the result was, and we shall place before
</p>
<p>you the witnesses who will show it, that the statements were almost
</p>
<p>uniformly false of the number of men and horses then actually in use,
</p>
<p>they being almost uniformly understated, and the number of men and
</p>
<p>horses to be required on the increased service almost uniformly over-
</p>
<p>stated. We are not going to ask you to come to that conclusion on any
</p>
<p>question of opinion. We are going to put before you the men who
</p>
<p>drove the horses before and after the increase. And we are going to
</p>
<p>have them tell you in their frank and honest way precisely what were
</p>
<p>the facts.
</p>
<p>These affidavits, made by contractors or subcontractors who had
</p>
<p>never seen the route, and which Mr. Brady chose to accept I am not
</p>
<p>permitted in my opening to show you the papers, gentlemen, for they
</p>
<p>are not yet identified we shall have occasion to show you, and I think,
</p>
<p>from the mere inspection of them, you will he able to see that not only
</p>
<p>no honest man. but no man who was not going on in a career of fraud
</p>
<p>and corruption, under the impression that he would never be investi-
</p>
<p>gated, would have made orders upon such papers. They are altered.
</p>
<p>They are erased. They are changed. They bear all the insignia of fraud
</p>
<p>upon their faces.
</p>
<p>But that is not all, gentlemen. We find this extraordinary condition

<p>of things. On route 38134, from Pueblo to Kosita, which, 1 think, is the
</p>
<p>same route upon which the obliging Mr. John W. Dorsey, as I have just
</p>
<p>stated to you, was allowed to make the affidavit i?istead of Mr. Miner,
</p>
<p>we iind that there were actually on file in Mr. Brady's office when he
</p>
<p>made the order for expedition, two oaths, both made by John W. Dorsey,
</p>
<p>both sworn to before the same man on the same day the 21st day of
</p>
<p>April, 1879 and in one of them he says, "The number necessary to
</p>
<p>carry the mail on that route on the existing schedule is two men and
</p>
<p>six animals;" and in the other affidavit he says, " The number neces-
</p>
<p>sary to carry the mail is three men and twelve animals." Those two
</p>
<p>affidavits were before Mr. Brady, made by John W. Dorsey on the
</p>
<p>same day, and yet Mr. Brady chose to pick out one or the other of
</p>
<p>them and say, "I believe that as the absolutely conclusive statement
</p>
<p>of the number of men and animals that are now in use upon that
</p>
<p>route, and upon that affidavit I will make my order taking from the
</p>
<p>Treasury thousands of dollars of money." You will see that the first
</p>
<p>affidavit made the number two men and six animals, making eight
</p>
<p>as the number of stock and carriers then in use ; but the other one
</p>
<p>called for three men and twelve animals, making fifteen as the number
</p>
<p>then in use, and therefore, according as he accepted one or the other,
</p>
<p>by the rule of three, to which I called your attention just now, there
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>would be twice tlie amount of money allowed from the Treasury under
</p>
<p>the one affidavit that there would be under the other.
</p>
<p>But the point to which I am calling your attention now is, that Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady chose to accept one of the affidavits as true when he had before
</p>
<p>him the two affidavits, and one or the other must have been square per-
</p>
<p>jury. Yet, as I say, he accepted the affidavit of a man not connected
</p>
<p>with the route, when he had the evidence before him that that man had
</p>
<p>committed square perjury in swearing.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Which of those affidavits did he use ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Well, sir, for the moment, I cannot say. My own im-
</p>
<p>pressions about it are. and I think, on reflection, we shall be able to
</p>
<p>show it to you, that it was concluded that the one stating- the small sum
</p>
<p>was a little too bad, and that that would not do, and that the other
</p>
<p>was put on file. I do not remember at this moment how that was.
</p>
<p>These routes get a little mixed in my memory.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. You do not recollect which he acted on ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I do not, sir.
</p>
<p>Mr. INGERSOLL. The affidavit requiring the least money was the one
</p>
<p>acted on.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I undertake to say, as a matter of fact, that that was
</p>
<p>not so.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. Very well.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLTSS. The only doubt in my mind is precisely this : Whether
</p>
<p>the result of the application of the rule of three to the two affidavits
</p>
<p>did not make the amount required under each of them substantially
</p>
<p>the same by understating one and the other. They did not balance-
</p>
<p>But I do say that I am very clear that he did not act upon the affidavit
</p>
<p>which gave a less amount than the other affidavit would have given.
</p>
<p>It may be that both the affidavits would have given the same sum.
</p>
<p>I do not know whether that is true or not. The only doubt in my
</p>
<p>mind is as to that. But, gentlemen, the point to which I am directing
</p>
<p>your attention now is not how r much money was taken from the
</p>
<p>Treasury upon these affidavits, but I am directing your attention
</p>
<p>to This: That a man who could, on the same day, swear to two

</p>
<p>affidavits which are so inconsistent as these, and who had therefore
</p>
<p>as to one of them committed a perjury, was the only witness whom
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady accepted as satisfactory to him as to how much money
</p>
<p>should be taken from the Treasury of the United States. I do not care
</p>
<p>whether they took the smallest or the largest sum. They took it upon
</p>
<p>the evidence of a man whose perjury stared Brady in "the face, and
</p>
<p>Brady chose to say that was sufficient. Now, as to the other affidavit.
</p>
<p>In one of them he swore that on the increased rate of speed there
</p>
<p>would be required six men and eighteen animals. In the other affidavit
</p>
<p>he swore that on the increased rate of speed there would be required
</p>
<p>seven men and thirty-eight animals. The total, you will see, is in one
</p>
<p>case twenty-four, and in the other case forty-five. Having sworn to
</p>
<p>two affidavits, both of which could not be true, and one of which must
</p>
<p>be a lie, it was. natural that he should go on and swear that in his
</p>
<p>opinion, and in his experience, there would be required in the one case
</p>
<p>twenty four men and animals, and in the other case forty-five men and
</p>
<p>animals There was falsity necessarily in one or the other of those
</p>
<p>affidavits, and in both branches of one or the other of the affidavits.
</p>
<p>It may be that the rule of three, as worked out between them, would
</p>
<p>result in taking from the Treasury only the same amount of money.
</p>
<p>That I do not care about on the present occasion. The point I ain
</p>
<p>making is that the affidavits showed Mr. Brady that that man was not
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>a safe man to take as bis guide. He was not the contractor and he was
</p>
<p>not the subcontractor. He had no relation to the routes, and yet Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady picked him out because he happened to be conveniently available
</p>
<p>to set in motion the machinery by which, at the earliest possible moment,
</p>
<p>money was to be taken out of the Treasury of the United States. One
</p>
<p>of those affidavits was filed on the 6th of May, 1879. Another of them
</p>
<p>was filed on the 8th of May, 1879. The order was made after the latter
</p>
<p>date when both affidavits were on file.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey, it is true, having put the first oath on file, on the 6th of
</p>
<p>May wrote a letter in which he asked permission to withdraw the first
</p>
<p>affidavit. He was apparently afraid that Mr. Brady would not have
</p>
<p>his attention called to the fact that he was a perjurer. So he asked
</p>
<p>permission to withdraw the affidavit to correct an error therein. The
</p>
<p>next day he corrected the error by putting on file the second affidavit,
</p>
<p>and so far as the correction of the error was concerned you will see
</p>
<p>that there is not a single figure in the two affidavits which is identical;
</p>
<p>not a single figure. The number of men and horses actually used is
</p>
<p>given in each and the figures do not agree, and the number of men and
</p>
<p>horses which would be required is given in each and the figures do not
</p>
<p>agree there. That is what he calls correcting an error. But the same
</p>
<p>Mr. John W. Dorsey made another error. On the llth of March he
</p>
<p>swore to an affidavit on route 38145, from a place down iu New Mexico
</p>
<p>called Ojo Calieute to Parrott City, that the number then necessary to
</p>
<p>carry the mail was three men and seven animals. He took that oath
</p>
<p>up in the pure air of Vermont, gentlemen, and six weeks later he got
</p>
<p>into the contaminating atmosphere of Washington and then he found
</p>
<p>out that instead of three men and seven animals, it would take five
</p>
<p>men and fifteen animals. In the one case the aggregate was ten which
</p>
<p>was to be used as the factor in estimating the amount to be taken
</p>
<p>from the Treasury, and in the other case the aggregate was twenty
</p>
<p>which was the factor to be used. You will see those figures agree pre-
</p>
<p>cisely with the supposititious case which 1 took up when 1 was trying
</p>
<p>to illustrate to you the effect of this rule of three in the statute as to
</p>
<p>expedition.

</p>
<p>The COURT. According to that the lower the figure the more the
</p>
<p>money ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. The lower the figure as to those actually in use the more
</p>
<p>the money. The higher the figure as to those to be used the more the
</p>
<p>money.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. As I understand it the point contended for is that they
</p>
<p>lowered the past and increased the future.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Yes.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. They lowered the present.
</p>
<p>The COURT. For example, take one as the original figure. If six is
</p>
<p>the second figure, it would be multiplied by one. If the original figure
</p>
<p>is two and the next figure six, that would be three times more than two.
</p>
<p>So that it was to the interest of the contractor to reduce the first num-
</p>
<p>ber and increase the second number.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. He has already stated that several times, your honor.
</p>
<p>The COURT. I know.
</p>
<p>Mr. INGERSOLL. There is no doubt about that.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. It is a mathematical calculation.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. There is obviously an excuse for the two affidavits being
</p>
<p>on the record on this route, because the first affidavit, made iu Vermont,
</p>
<p>was made when Mr. Dorsey and his associates were looking to an idea
</p>
<p>of getting the speed so increased that the time would be reduced from
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>one hundred and twenty hours, I think it was, to eighty hours. The
</p>
<p>second affidavit was made when they had become more enterprising,
</p>
<p>and had concluded, six weeks later in Washington, that they would get
</p>
<p>the time reduced, not to eighty hours, but to fifty hours. You will see
</p>
<p>that no matter to what time they proposed to reduce the time, no mat-
</p>
<p>ter what the rate of increase of speed was proposed to be, yet in both
</p>
<p>cases in the affidavit which stated the number of men and horses then
</p>
<p>actually in use they should have stated the same number. There was
</p>
<p>no change there. But there would undoubtedly be more horses required
</p>
<p>in the future to reduce the schedule to fifty hours than were required
</p>
<p>to reduce the schedule to eighty hours. Therefore there was a reason
</p>
<p>for Mr. John W. Dorsey's getting two affidavits on the files of the Post-
</p>
<p>Office Department, and it was not an error that he had to correct. The
</p>
<p>only error was that he forgot when he made the second affidavit what
</p>
<p>he had stated in the first affidavit as to the number of men and horses
</p>
<p>actually in use. Those two affidavits were both on file, both staring
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady in the face, and both in the very envelope on which Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady indorsed his order allowing increase of pay. He based his or-
</p>
<p>der upon the papers which he recited were inside of the envelope. They
</p>
<p>could not both be true. Mr. Brady chose to accept the man who made
</p>
<p>those two affidavits, both of which could not be true, as his sole author-
</p>
<p>ity for taking money by thousands from the Treasury of the United
</p>
<p>States. There is no escape from that, gentlemen.
</p>
<p>There is another case. On route 38113 John W. Dorsey was the
</p>
<p>contractor. A letter was written by Montfort C. Kerdell, one of the
</p>
<p>defendants, a clerk of Stephen W. Dorsey, then still a Senator. That
</p>
<p>letter was written on paper of the Senate of the United States. It was
</p>
<p>written to Perkins, the subcontractor at Rawlins, Wyo., sending him
</p>
<p>an affidavit to be sworn to in blank by him as subcontractor. He
</p>
<p>directed him to swear to it just as it was, leaving the blanks unfilled.
</p>
<p>Perkins swore to it just as it was, and he sent it back here with the
</p>
<p>blanks unfilled. Immediately afterwards the blanks were filled in and
</p>
<p>the affidavit was filed in the department. It is in Mr. Brady's order
</p>
<p>recited as the affidavit upon which he based his order for expedition

</p>
<p>and allowance in that case. We shall place before you the notary
</p>
<p>public who took the affidavit. We shall place before you Mr. Kerdell's
</p>
<p>letter directing it to be taken just as it was, without change. We s*hall
</p>
<p>place before you the man who swore to it. They will all tell you that
</p>
<p>that affidavit was sworn to in blank, was sent here to these defendants,
</p>
<p>was by one of them filed in the department, and was made by Brady
</p>
<p>the basis of the order upon which he directed tens of thousands of dol-
</p>
<p>lars I think it was to be taken from the Treasury of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen of the jury, we shall show to you a still more ex-
</p>
<p>traordinary condition of things. We shall show you that the ability to
</p>
<p>make two affidavits which were inconsistent was not confined to John
</p>
<p>W. Dorsey. On route 35051, from Bismarck to Fort Keogh, you will
</p>
<p>find a good many queer things, but I will now only ask you to remem-
</p>
<p>ber one : John E. Miner, by an oath filed on the 4th of October, swore
</p>
<p>that to carry the mail over that route in eighty-four hours, which was
</p>
<p>the original time, took twelve men and thirteen animals, making twen-
</p>
<p>ty-five in all, and that to carry it in sixty-five hours, which was about
</p>
<p>twenty hours' reduction, would take one hundred and fifty men and one
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty animals. Now, in that affidavit he did not expressly
</p>
<p>say that he was referring to an eighty-four hour schedule, but he was
</p>
<p>making an affidavit for the purpose of getting the time reduced to sixty-
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>five hours, and he did so tinder a regulation compelling him to state
</p>
<p>the number which would be required. That is the route on which I
</p>
<p>told you that Brady, acting upon the evidence of this monumental
</p>
<p>swearer, said that this allowance was less than pro rata. By mak-
</p>
<p>ing the allowance less than pro rata he still carried the original
</p>
<p>compensation of, I think, $2,250 up to $27,950. He said, allowing
</p>
<p>him $27,950, and assuming that it would take three hundred men and
</p>
<p>horses to carry the mail on the increased rate, that that was less than
</p>
<p>pro rata. Well, it was less thaii pro rata upon that basis. But what
</p>
<p>do we find? We find this condition of things: In the Post Office De-
</p>
<p>partment, as in other public offices, the papers relating to a given route
</p>
<p>are tiled away in what is practically a long envelope cut open at the
</p>
<p>ends, and is known as a jacket. When Mr. Brady made an order it
</p>
<p>was made on the back of the jacket, and referred to the papers which
</p>
<p>were inside. The order recites that upon such and such papers it ap-
</p>
<p>pears so and so, and therefore it is ordered so and so. Mr. Brady's
</p>
<p>practice was to look over these papers, and then to indorse ordinarily
</p>
<p>in pencil on the back of the jacket "Do this Brady." That indorse-
</p>
<p>ment was the voucher on which some clerk went to work and wrote out
</p>
<p>a formal order, which was indorsed on the back of the jacket, reciting
</p>
<p>the papers; and that was the authority under which money was taken
</p>
<p>from the Treasury of the United States by hundreds of thousands and
</p>
<p>millions. Kow, in the very jacket on which Mr. Brady indorsed the
</p>
<p>allowance of $27,950, and felicitated himself that it was less than pro
</p>
<p>rata, accepting Mr. Miner's statement that it would take three hundred
</p>
<p>men and horses, we find this condition of things : We find inside of the
</p>
<p>jacket another jacket which contains an indorsement reciting precisely
</p>
<p>the same petition of the same officers and the same papers in every
</p>
<p>respect all the way down, agreeing almost absolutely, and yet when we
</p>
<p>come to see on what it is based we find this : The contractor, that is,
</p>
<p>Miner
</p>
<p>Furnishes sworn statement that for service three times a week on the present
</p>
<p>schedule eleven men and twelve animals are required.
</p>
<p>That was not much different from the affidavit which was finally used,

</p>
<p>which is twelve men and thirteen animals, making twenty-five in the ag-
</p>
<p>gregate instead of twenty-three. But he also furnished a sworn state-
</p>
<p>ment that thirty seven men and seventy-three animals would be required
</p>
<p>on a sixty-five-hour schedule. He swore that a hundred and fifty men
</p>
<p>and a hundred and fifty animals would be required on the eighty-four-
</p>
<p>hour schedule, and Mr. Brady accepted that and made an order upon
</p>
<p>it, felicitating himself that it was less than pro rata, and that he had
</p>
<p>saved a few hundred or a thousand dollars ; but he had before him at
</p>
<p>that time the affidavit of the same John R. Miner that to make a speed of
</p>
<p>sixty-five hours it would require only thirty -seven men and seventy-three
</p>
<p>animals, making a hundred and ten as the factor to be used in calcu-
</p>
<p>lating the amount, and not three hundred, as it was made under the
</p>
<p>affidavit which Mr. Brady chose to accept. The existence of that affi-
</p>
<p>davit is recited upon the paper in the very jacket on which Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>made his order. That affidavit has unfortunately disappeared, how or
</p>
<p>when we cannot say; but we shall place before you the man who in-
</p>
<p>dorsed that jacket to which I referred as on the inside and he will
</p>
<p>tell you that that affidavit was there, that he made that indorsement
</p>
<p>upon the inside jacket, and that the inside jacket so indorsed was in
</p>
<p>Brady's possession at the time he made the order. When he was making
</p>
<p>an order upon John K. Miner's affidavit he had the statement before him
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>that it would require a hundred and fifty men and a hundred and fifty ani-
</p>
<p>mals to carry the mail at a certain rate, and yet John E. Miner had also
</p>
<p>filed an affidavit stating that it would take but thirty-seven men and
</p>
<p>seventy three animals to do the same service. Brady chose, with that
</p>
<p>evidence staring him in the face, to accept Mr. John E. Miner's affidavit
</p>
<p>as sufficient to justify the making of an order carrying up an allowance
</p>
<p>of $2,250 to $27,950. Gentlemen of the jury, we shall ask you from that
</p>
<p>evidence, from evidence such as that, and from evidence other than that,
</p>
<p>to draw the inference that Mr. Brady's action in this matter was not
</p>
<p>that of an honest, incorrupt official.
</p>
<p>On the nineteen routes in this case there were on file eighteen affi-
</p>
<p>davits used for expedition. On one of the nineteen routes in this indict-
</p>
<p>ment there never was any expedition. The fraud upon the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment there consisted in paying twice over for the same service. One
</p>
<p>of the eighteen affidavits was made by Vaile. I have already told you
</p>
<p>that it was made on National Hotel paper and made in this city, and
</p>
<p>was made and filed although Vaile did not pretend ever to have been
</p>
<p>on the route or to have known of his own knowledge anything that he
</p>
<p>swore to. He did have the advantage over the other defendants of be-
</p>
<p>ing a mail contractor, and therefore had some experience upon which
</p>
<p>to judge on a statement of facts by others, as to what would probably
</p>
<p>be required. But he had no knowledgeas to what number was actually
</p>
<p>required. That affidavit of Vaile's is an unaltered affidavit. It will
</p>
<p>come before you with no evidences of alteration upon it. There is an-
</p>
<p>other affidavit made by Miner which will come before you without any

<p>used as the basis for making orders to take money from the Treasury
</p>
<p>of the United States will come before you bearing upon their face evi-

</p>
<p>which were the elements which determined how much should be taken
</p>
<p>out of the Treasury of the United States. We think we shall be able
</p>
<p>to satisfy you that these affidavits present evidence of the growing greed
</p>
<p>of these parties, that they were made at a time when they were content
</p>
<p>to take from the Treasury one amount of money illegitimately, but as their
</p>
<p>immunity went on and their greed increased, they thought they would
</p>
<p>have more money from the Treasury. It may be, that their expenses
</p>
<p>were greater. It may be tbat they, had to make larger u divvies.' 7 At
</p>
<p>any rate their greed increased, and then they altered the affidavits by
</p>
<p>putting in, larger figures. However that may be the affidavits were all
</p>
<p>made except that of Perkins, which was sworn loin blank by men who
</p>
<p>were never on the routes. Sixteen of the eighteen were altered on their
</p>
<p>face, and those affidavits were the only evidence which Brady had be-
</p>
<p>fore him, on which the allowances to these defendants were run up from
</p>
<p>$41,000 a year to $448,000 a year. We shall ask you on that evidence
</p>
<p>of course, in connection with other evidence to say that the acts of
</p>
<p>Brady and these other defendants were the acts of men engaged in a
</p>
<p>corrupt conspiracy to defraud the United States. Brady violated not
</p>
<p>only the spirit of the law, but he violated its direct letter. He acted
</p>
<p>upon insufficient affidavits. He acted upon altered affidavits. He left
</p>
<p>it to the person benefited to be the sole judge of how much he should
</p>
<p>have from the Treasury. He accepted evidence which could not have
</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>been accepted by any honest man if he was not blind. He made allow-
</p>
<p>ances on that evidence in excess of what the evidence called for. He
</p>
<p>made allowances in violation of the statute by antedating the effect of
</p>
<p>the orders. All this we shall show you by the records of the depart-
</p>
<p>ment, which there will be no attempt to impeach.
</p>
<p>I said that he ran up the amount from $41,000 to $448,000 qn such orders
</p>
<p>and based upon such affidavits. I was not entirely correct in that state-
</p>
<p>ment. That amount is the aggregate amount of increases not only
</p>
<p>for expedition which had affidavits as its basis, but it also included in-
</p>
<p>crease of trips for which no affidavit was required. Trips were in-
</p>
<p>creased at Brady's own sweet will, because the law only said that the
</p>
<p>pay should not exceed the proportionate amount of increase. As to expe-
</p>
<p>dition, the l;iw said there must be this arithmetical calculation. Hence
</p>
<p>the device of these deceptive affidavits to comply seemingly with the
</p>
<p>law. ' In point ot fact Brady made, I think, thirteen orders for expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, carryiiiii' up service already incurred to $159,299.95 to $317,718.54,
</p>
<p>or just about double. At the same time, and without affidavits, he
</p>
<p>made the increase of trips carrying it up to $448,000. 1 may have got
</p>
<p>confused on these figures to some small extent.
</p>
<p>Some of these orders were not his in form, but were so in fact. But,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, these affidavits told their own tale in another direction, the
</p>
<p>taleot their absurdity, the tale of the impropriety of Brady's undertak-
</p>
<p>ing to base anything upon them. Take route 35051, from Bismarck to
</p>
<p>Fort Keogh, upon which Miner made these two affidavits. On the
</p>
<p>original schedule the speed was three and sixty one-hundredths miles an
</p>
<p>hour. On the expedited schedule it was four and sixty oue-hundredths
</p>
<p>miles an hour. Practically an increase of one mile an hour. On theorig-
</p>
<p>nal schedule, judging in each case by Miner's oath, each horse had to
</p>
<p>travel twenty three miles a day not an excessive distance. But on the
</p>
<p>expedited schedule, assuming that as many horses were needed as Mr.
</p>
<p>Miner swore to, each horse would have to travel only two miles a day.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady accepted the statement that it was necessary on that route
</p>
<p>to have such a number of horses that no horse should travel more than
</p>
<p>two miles a day. If they had used double teams they would have had

</p>
<p>to have gone four miles a day. I am obliged to use an illustration not
</p>
<p>arithmetically correct, because if you reduce anything a hundred per
</p>
<p>cent, you wipe it out; but it will probably carry to your minds the idea
</p>
<p>I want to express when I say that they made an increase of speed of a
</p>
<p>mile an hour and thereby reduced the capacity of each horse four hun-
</p>
<p>dred and fifty per cent., and upon that route, gentlemen, this was
</p>
<p>done ; the route being started at $2,350 a year, by the addition of in-
</p>
<p>creased trips $14,100 was added ; then by the addition of the increased
</p>
<p>speed of one mile an hour $55,000 more was added, and the result was
</p>
<p>that that route, let to Miner after public bidding, which originally
</p>
<p>started at $2,350 a year, before he and Brady got through with it, was
</p>
<p>run up to something over $70,000 a year, and run up, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, as to all except $14,000 of that amount upon the affidavit of John
</p>
<p>II. Miner, which the papers on file in Mr. Brady's office showed him
</p>
<p>could not be true, because there were two inconsistent affidavits there,
</p>
<p>and a mere analysis of the affidavits showed it could not be true, be-
</p>
<p>cau.se it proceeded upon the basis that each horse would have to travel
</p>
<p>only two miles a day.
</p>
<p>Now take another route. On the route from Pueblo to Eosita, by the
</p>
<p>original schedule, the speed was three and twenty-six one-hundredths
</p>
<p>miles an hour, and on the expedited schedule it was four and nine one-
</p>
<p>hundredths miles, therefore increasing it somewhere about three-quar-
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>ters of a mile an hour. On the original schedule every horse would
</p>
<p>have to travel sixteen and one-third miles a day. To make three quar-
</p>
<p>ters of a mile more in an hour over that short route, it was necessary
</p>
<p>to reduce the daily travel of each horse from sixteen and one-third
</p>
<p>miles to five and four-ninth miles a day. The horses that that affi-
</p>
<p>davit said would be necessary for the increased speed would have to
</p>
<p>travel to make it only five and four ninths miles a day. Does anything
</p>
<p>need to be said, gentlemen, to show you that it is not necessary for
</p>
<p>hors s in carrying the mails at a rate of about four miles an hour that
</p>
<p>they shall travel only five miles and a half in a day 1?
</p>
<p>On the route from Silverton to Parrott City, on the original schedule,
</p>
<p>evei*y horse would have to travel thirteen miles a day only thirteen
</p>
<p>miles a day, mind you. I am taking the statement of the men and
</p>
<p>horses in actual use. And on the expedited schedule every horse would
</p>
<p>have to travel four and one-third miles a day.
</p>
<p>On the route from Mineral Park to Pioche, on the original schedules,
</p>
<p>every horse would have to travel six and sixty-four one-hundreths
</p>
<p>miles a day. On the expedited schedule the horse would have to travel
</p>
<p>six and twenty one-hundredths miles a day. Does anybody need any
</p>
<p>argument to show that either on the original or on the expedited sched-
</p>
<p>ule it is absurd to suppose that a horse could g > onl} T six arid one third
</p>
<p>miles a day f On that route it is right to say that the fraud did not
</p>
<p>chiefly come in in that connection. They had some queer inconsistencies
</p>
<p>in these affidavits. They might have sometimes benefited themselves
</p>
<p>by being more consistent.
</p>
<p>On the route from Toquerville to Adairville every horse on the orig-
</p>
<p>inal schedule would have to travel twenty-four miles a day, but on the
</p>
<p>expedited schedule he would have to travel only thirteen and one-
</p>
<p>third miles a day. On the original schedule the rate was two miles an
</p>
<p>hour. You will see how they understood it there. Accepting the state-
</p>
<p>ment of horses actually in use, every horse that they stated was in use,
</p>
<p>to have got over the route in the schedule time of two miles an hour
</p>
<p>would have to travel twenty-four miles every day. Every horse
</p>
<p>would have to travel all the time every day, week in and week out, if

</p>
<p>t ley only had that number of horses alleged. And yet Mr. Brady ac-
</p>
<p>c ipted that as conclusive. And if on t..at route there had been put on
</p>
<p>soven trips a week which the affidavit was seeking to get, and that affi-
</p>
<p>davit was made upon the basis thatt here would be seven trips a week,
</p>
<p>every carrier would have to travel eighty miles in a day, and what is
</p>
<p>the climax of absurdity, he would have had to travel forty hours in
</p>
<p>every twenty-four. That is the affidavit, gentlemen, that Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>accepted. That is the sole affidavit and the sole evidence that he had
</p>
<p>and on which he took thousands of dollars from the Treasury.
</p>
<p>On the route from Eugene City to Bridge Creek, on the original
</p>
<p>schedule, according to the affidavit, each horse would have to travel
</p>
<p>nineteen and seven one-hundredths miles a day, and on the expedited
</p>
<p>schedule he would have to travel only five and nine one-huudreths miles
</p>
<p>a day.
</p>
<p>On the Canyon City and Camp McDermitt route, on the original
</p>
<p>schedule, accepting the affidavit always, each horse would have had to
</p>
<p>travel eight and sixty eight one-hundreths miles a day. On the expe-
</p>
<p>dited schedule he would, according to the affidavit, have had to travel
</p>
<p>only three and fifteen one-hundreths miles a day; and on that route,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, to carry the speed from one and eighty-seven one-hundredths
</p>
<p>miles an hour, which is a little less than two miles an hour, up to two
</p>
<p>and one-half miles an hour, Mr. Brady, upon such aii affidavit as I have
</p>
<p>32
</p>
<p>just described to you, ordered paid to these defendants $29,950. To
</p>
<p>carry the speed up on that route in Oregon through an unfrequented
</p>
<p>region one-half a mile an hour he paid $29,1)50, and, to be accurate, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, 06 cents.
</p>
<p>On the route from Julian to Colton, if we take the oath as correct, on
</p>
<p>the original schedule each horse had to travel twenty and six one-hun-
</p>
<p>dredths miles a day. On the expedited schedule, if we take the oath as
</p>
<p>correct, he only had to travel five and seventy-two one-huudredths miles
</p>
<p>a day.
</p>
<p>On the route from Bedding to Alturas on rhe original schedule a horse
</p>
<p>had to travel twelve and eight one-huudredths. On the expedited sched-
</p>
<p>ule, taking the affidavit as correct, he had to travel only tive and seven
</p>
<p>one-hundred the a day.
</p>
<p>On the route from Saint Charles to Greenhorn, on the original sched-
</p>
<p>ule, a horse had to travel twenty-seven and forty-three one hundred ths
</p>
<p>miles a day, and when it came to the expedited schedule that horse had
</p>
<p>to travel only six and eighty-five one-hundredths miles a day. And yet,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, we shall show you that it was the same horse all the time,
</p>
<p>and that he went over that route in the same way ; that there was no
</p>
<p>increase of horses and no increase of men, and we think the affidavit
</p>
<p>was in fact a lie, just as all these affidavits showed to Mr. Brady, or to
</p>
<p>any officer, or to any man who chose to examine them, that on their
</p>
<p>very face they were lies. Yet those affidavits were the sole evidence
</p>
<p>upon which Mr. Brady took enormous sums from the Treasury of the
</p>
<p>United States. I could go on and give you additional details of those
</p>
<p>affidavits. You must believe, gentlemen, for the present certainly, that
</p>
<p>they are all of that same general nature. They are all cases where the
</p>
<p>affidavit showed upon its face that it was not and could not be true.
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen of the jury, Mr. Brady had before him at the time
</p>
<p>he made these orders other evidence showing that he was doing what
</p>
<p>no honest officer could do.
</p>
<p>I have already referred to the law as to placing the subcontract on file.
</p>
<p>I think there is but one of the nineteen routes which was run by any of
</p>
<p>these parties. Upon all the others they had subcontracts, as I recollect,
</p>

</p>
<p>though in some cases the subcontracts were not put on file, and I shall
</p>
<p>presently have occasion to show you why they were not put on file. The
</p>
<p>subcontracts that they made were on a form that they had prepared and
</p>
<p>had printed themselves and contained provisions that the subcontractor
</p>
<p>agreed to carry the mail on the existing schedule and at the existing rate
</p>
<p>of speed, the same number of trips, and the same amount of speed, for so
</p>
<p>much money. Then they contained the provision that, supposing the
</p>
<p>original schedule is one trip and two trips shall be ordered, they will carry
</p>
<p>it for a given sum, which is less than double the amount. If three
</p>
<p>trips shall be ordered that they will carry it for a given sum, which is
</p>
<p>less than three times the amount. And then, also, most of them con-
</p>
<p>tained the provision that in case the speed should be increased, they will
</p>
<p>carry the mail at the increased speed for a certain percentage of the
</p>
<p>amount allowed by the Government. I think in no case is it stated
</p>
<p>at over (>5 per cent, of the amount to be allowed. You will bear in
</p>
<p>mind, gentlemen, that the law said that Mr. Brady could not allow
</p>
<p>any sum in excess of a given amount. His duty, as an honest officer,
</p>
<p>was to get it as much below that sum as he could get it and have the
</p>
<p>service fairly and properly performed by someone who would feel that he
</p>
<p>was adequately compensated for the service rendered. And yet you will
</p>
<p>find this condition of things : that when Mr. Brady had before him on
</p>
<p>the files of his department subcontracts which said that a certain man
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>was actually carrying the mail at three miles an hour, that he agreed
</p>
<p>to carry it at four miles an hour for 65 per cent, of the additional
</p>
<p>allowance from the Government, Mr. Brady would make an order say-
</p>
<p>ing that there shall be allowed for carrying the mail on the increased
</p>
<p>service $10.000, and of that $10,000 $4,500 shall ,go to the man who has
</p>
<p>actually to carry the mail, and $6,500 shall go to the man who is to sit
</p>
<p>here iii Washington, and make the arrangements to get this expedi-
</p>
<p>tion ordered. Mr. Brady having those subcontracts on tile in his de-
</p>
<p>partment, where he saw that people agreed to do the expedited service
</p>
<p>at 65 per cent, or a given percentage (I think in some cases they agreed
</p>
<p>to do the expedited service for a round sum, but I am not sure about
</p>
<p>that), made orders for those large sums and actually put into his order
</p>
<p>that only a fragment of that amount should go to the man who was to
</p>
<p>carry the mail, and the remainder was to go to the man who was to sit
</p>
<p>here in Washington and not carry the mail, and did that under that
</p>
<p>law which I have read to you, and I suppose claims that that was an
</p>
<p>honest exercise of his powers. You will bear in mind that he did not
</p>
<p>voluntarily do that. When a subcontract got on file, under the sub-
</p>
<p>contract law, the money that the subcontract called for had to be paid
</p>
<p>to the subcontractor, and therefore when Mr. Brady made an order for
</p>
<p>expedition in a case where a subcontract was on file he had to pro-
</p>
<p>vide in his order how the money should be distributed. But, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, these parties took pretty good care not to have very many of these
</p>
<p>subcontracts on file. They made it, as we shall show you, a condition
</p>
<p>in a large number of cases where there were subcontractors, that they
</p>
<p>should not put their subcontracts on file, and for fear that the subcon-
</p>
<p>tractors might become acquainted with the character of the parties with
</p>
<p>whom they were dealing and violate their agreements and put their sub-
</p>
<p>contracts on file, these defendants resorted to this little device: On
</p>
<p>a given route the post-office contract was with John E. Miner, on an-
</p>
<p>other route with John M. Peck, and on another route it was with
</p>
<p>John W. Dorsey. Well, what was done with these? John E. Miner
</p>
<p>on his route would make a subcontract with John W. Dorsey as a sub-
</p>
<p>contractor, and would put that on file, and as the law did not allow but

</p>
<p>one subcontract on each route, if the subcontractor out in the locality
</p>
<p>sent his contract here, as some of them did, to have it filed they would
</p>
<p>be answered, " We cannot file it ; there is another one on file." John
</p>
<p>W. Dorsey in turn on his route would make John E. Miner the sub-
</p>
<p>contractor, and then John M. Peck on his route would make John W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey the subcontractor. Occasionally they would vary the matter
</p>
<p>by making their clerk, Montfort C. Eerdell, the subcontractor and file
</p>
<p>his subcontract. Arid after Stephen W. Dorsey got out of the Senate
</p>
<p>and he thought it was safe for him to throw off the cloak, then Stephen
</p>
<p>W. Dorsey would come in occasionally as subcontractor. Every one
</p>
<p>of these men were interested in some of these contracts and in this
</p>
<p>conspiracy ; but no one of them was a mail contractor; no one of them
</p>
<p>ever carried the mail a mile. No one of them ever expected to be a sub-
</p>
<p>contractor in fact, and as to many of these routes these bogus subcon-
</p>
<p>tracts were placed on file instead of the existing subcontracts with the men
</p>
<p>who were carrying the mails. When Dorsey became the subcontrator
</p>
<p>for Miner, or Miner for Peck, or John W. Dorsey for brother Stephen,
</p>
<p>they always made a subcontract by which they were to have the full
</p>
<p>amount awarded under the contract, including all that was to be given
</p>
<p>for expedition or increase of service. They were to have the whole
</p>
<p>thing. So that it was not necessary in these cases, when Brady came
</p>
<p>to make his order, to put in any specification how much of the amount
</p>
<p>3GB
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>that lie awarded for expedition was to go to the man who was to run
</p>
<p>the mail ami how much to the man who sat here in Washington doing
</p>
<p>nothing, because Mr. Brady made his order that the whole amount
</p>
<p>should go to the subcontractor who was sitting here in Washington
</p>
<p>doing nothing, except making little arrangements, applying a little
</p>
<p>" greaf-e," and doing what was necessary to get these things through
</p>
<p>the Post-Office Department. In that way the subcontract law was, in
</p>
<p>the ordinary language, "beat," and Mr. Brady was prevented from the
</p>
<p>necessity of making any undue exposure of his own corruption in his
</p>
<p>orders for expedition, because he had not to say in* those cases that any
</p>
<p>money should go to the man who was not in form at least carrying the
</p>
<p>mail.
</p>
<p>"With reference to that let. me call your attention to one of two in-
</p>
<p>stances. On the route from Julian to Colton Mr. Brady made the order
</p>
<p>for expedition, directing that $17,964 should be allowed for the expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, and that only $10,500 of that should go to the man whom he knew
</p>
<p>was actually performing the service, and he directed that the remain-
</p>
<p>ing $7,404 should go to the man whom he knew was not performing
</p>
<p>the service.
</p>
<p>So, on the route from Eawlins to White Biver, the contractor got
</p>
<p>$13,706.25, and the unfortunate subcontractor got $5,100. , There was
</p>
<p>a later stage in that case at which the contractor got $31,000, giving
</p>
<p>$23,000 to the subcontractor and kept $8,000 to himself.
</p>
<p>There are a series of those cases which I have here t<j which I shall
</p>
<p>have occasion to call your attention where Mr. Brady put it squarely
</p>
<p>into the order that they should get only those amounts, and in this con-
</p>
<p>nection it is well for me, perhaps without reference to his orders, to call
</p>
<p>your attention in connection, with this subcontract law to another point
</p>
<p>of view.
</p>
<p>On the route from Kearney to Kent the contractor received before
</p>
<p>expedition the. contractor, I think, was John W. Dorsey $888. He
</p>
<p>agreed to pay $700 to the man who carried the mail the subcontractor.
</p>
<p>He got ifc expedited so that he received $4,302.65. He paid out to the
</p>
<p>man who was carry ing the mail, $1,587. 40, and kept for himself $2,715.25.

</p>
<p>The man who was doing the service got $1,587, and the man who was
</p>
<p>sitting here in Washington got $2,715, and that under Brady's orders
</p>
<p>for increase of service and expedition.
</p>
<p>On the route from Pueblo to Kosita the contractor under Brady's
</p>
<p>orders got $8,148. By a subcontract on file from the outset of the con-
</p>
<p>tract the service was performed for $3,100. So that there was a case
</p>
<p>in which $5,048 went into the contractor's pocket as appeared by the
</p>
<p>papers on tile in Mr. Brady's office at the time he made his order, and
</p>
<p>this subcontractor who was getting $3,100 had such a good thing of it
</p>
<p>at that price that he got somebody else to perform the service at $2,600
</p>
<p>and put $500 in his own pocket. Thus the man who did the service was
</p>
<p>paid $2,600, and the Government was paying for it under Brady's or-
</p>
<p>ders $8,148.
</p>
<p>On the route from Toqnerville to Adairville the contractor got
</p>
<p>$20,894.22. The subcontractor who did the service got $8,444. The
</p>
<p>man who sat here in Washington therefore got for himself and his ex-
</p>
<p>penses $12,450 without any cdst. Gentlemen, right here let me call
</p>
<p>your attention to this fact : Under all the subcontracts that they made,
</p>
<p>if there was any deduction for not performing the service ; if there was
</p>
<p>any fine for not arriving on time ; if there was anything taken off by
</p>
<p>the Post-Office and no man can run the mail service without exposing
</p>
<p>himself to some deductions every dollar of fines and every dollar of
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>deductions was taken off from the pay of the subcontractor, while the
</p>
<p>contractors, Dorsey and company, sitting here in Washington, got their
</p>
<p>sum net. These conspirators, I ought to say, sitting here in YVashing-
</p>
<p>ton, got their sum net, for we do not believe you will think on the evi-
</p>
<p>dence we shall show you that Mr. Brady was foolish enough to let the
</p>
<p>contractors have all the money.
</p>
<p>On the route from Ojo Caliente to Parrott City the contractor got eventu-
</p>
<p>ally $31,343.76, and the subcontractor got at one time $(5,200 ; at another
</p>
<p>time, $7,300; and when the subcontractor wrote to Mr. Stephen W. Dor-
</p>
<p>sey that to do the service for which he (Dorsey) was getting $14,333,
</p>
<p>though the subcontractor did not know it, it would cost $12, 000, and there-
</p>
<p>fore said, U I am not getting enough when you give me only $6,200."
</p>
<p>Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey wrote him back in almost substantially this lan-
</p>
<p>guage : " You are a fool ; don't talk so. It would not cost any such sum
</p>
<p>to carry the mail on that route." And yet the sum that this man said
</p>
<p>it would cost to carry the mail on that route which Dorsey said was
</p>
<p>nonsense was only $12,000, and Mr. Brady was ordering paid from the
</p>
<p>Treasury to Mr. Dorsey at that very time $14,300 for carrying that mail.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey either lied to his subcontractor or Mr. Brady was an un-
</p>
<p>faithful officer.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Adjourn the court.
</p>
<p>At this point (4 o'clock p. m.) the court was adjourned until to-mor-
</p>
<p>row morning at 11 o'clock.
</p>
<p>FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1882.
</p>

</p>
<p>The court met at 11 o'clock.
</p>
<p>Present, counsel for the Government and for the defendants.
</p>
<p>Hon. GEORGE BLISS resumed his address to the jury, as follows:
</p>
<p>At the adjournment yesterday, gentlemen, I had called your atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the scheme of* the laws as to advertising, to the provision for
</p>
<p>public competition and the letting to the lowest bidder, to the provis-
</p>
<p>ion made for cohering omissions and contingencies under the statute,
</p>
<p>to the fact that Brady had resorted to the exceptional power and provis-
</p>
<p>ions as to expedition and increase of service greatly in excess of any-

</p>
<p>thing that had ever been done before in the history of the department,
</p>
<p>but I failed in that connection, gentlemen, to state to you a most sig-
</p>
<p>nificant fact which I ought to have stated: that from the time Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady went out of office as Second Assistant Postmaster-General down
</p>
<p>to the present time, there has been no instance of a resort to expedition
</p>
<p>in the history of the Post Office Department, and that the mails have
</p>
<p>been successfully carried, and without complaint, through the entire
</p>
<p>country at a saving, and that, therefore, Mr. Brady's large use of that
</p>
<p>power could not have arisen from any change of the circumstances, but
</p>
<p>that the condition of things was practically not changed from that
</p>
<p>which prevailed before he became Second Assistant Postmaster-General,
</p>
<p>when it was necessary to resort to these provisions only very rarely
</p>
<p>twenty times in five years and that while within the last year and a
</p>
<p>half it has been not necessary to resort to them once, yet Brady, in about
</p>
<p>four years and a half found it necessary, or claimed to find it necessary,
</p>
<p>to resort to them one hundred and twenty times. I called your attention
</p>
<p>also to the fact that Mr. Brady when he did make increases made them
</p>
<p>up to the extreme limit allowed, and how he made them on improper evi-
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>dence; bow lie accepted affidavits erased and altered; how he founded
</p>
<p>them on the statements of affiants, which contradicted themselves by
</p>
<p>other affidavits also before him at the same time, and how he sought no
</p>
<p>other affidavit; how the affidavits on the face of them showed that they
</p>
<p>were absurd, and that when they stated that so many horses and men
</p>
<p>were necessary they made a statement which showed that they assumed
</p>
<p>that each horse was to travel only from two to four miles a day; how he
</p>
<p>allowed increases greatly in excess of the proper amounts, and how it
</p>
<p>was shown by his own orders that this was so because he directed in
</p>
<p>his orders that only a portion of the sum should be paid to the men who
</p>
<p>were carrying the mails, and a very large portion, very frequently the
</p>
<p>largest proportion, to the men who sat here in Washington and did
</p>
<p>nothing towards carrying the mails.
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, I must follow this thing along further. We say that
</p>
<p>he paid for expedition where there were very great misstatemeuts in
</p>
<p>the affidavits as to the number of men and horses either then required
</p>
<p>or which would be required. For instance, upon the route from
</p>
<p>Eugene City to Mitchell, No. 44140, up in Oregon, the oath is that
</p>
<p>for three trips on the then existing schedule it required four men
</p>
<p>and nine animals, and that on a fifty-hour schedule it would requiie
</p>
<p>ten men and thirty animals. In point of fact that affidavit did not
</p>
<p>greatly misstate the number of men and animals then actually em-
</p>
<p>ployed. We shall show you, by the man who carried the mail after the
</p>
<p>increase, that instead of giving it correctly when they gave it, as re-
</p>
<p>quiring forty, in point of fact it icquired only twenty six, and that
</p>
<p>therefore the increase originally was from four men and nine animals,
</p>
<p>a total of thirteen, to a total of twenty-six, when they made the state-
</p>
<p>ment that it would require forty, nearly double, the result of that being
</p>
<p>that by the application of the rule of three in that matter there was
</p>
<p>allowed under that order in that case for expedition nearly twice as
</p>
<p>much as should have been allowed had the affidavit truthfully stated
</p>
<p>the fact as to the number of men and horses which would be required;
</p>
<p>even taking twenty-six as the number which were actually used, it only
</p>
<p>required each horse to travel fourteen miles a day.

</p>
<p>On the route from Pueblo to Greenhorn, 38135, the oath was that to
</p>
<p>make three trips a week required one man and one animal; that to
</p>
<p>make three trips on a less schedule, or seven hours, would require two
</p>
<p>men and four animals. In other words, it required two at that time,
</p>
<p>and it would require six to increase the schedule. That was the oath,
</p>
<p>and yet we shall show you that from the commencement of that service
</p>
<p>down to the present time, when it was on the long schedule and when
</p>
<p>it was on the short schedule, it has always been run by the same num-
</p>
<p>ber of men, the same number of horses, and by identically the same
</p>
<p>horses, the only change being that sometimes one man became a carrier
</p>
<p>and sometimes another. We shall put before you those men who were
</p>
<p>successively the carriers upon that route, and they will tell you that
</p>
<p>fact, and you will see, gentlemen, that this was the result. Not only
</p>
<p>was Mr. Brady's allowance, based upon this affidavit from the interested
</p>
<p>contractor, an excessive allowance, but, under the statute, it was an
</p>
<p>allowance he had no right to make at all, because there was no right to
</p>
<p>make any allowance unless the result of an increase of speed was the
</p>
<p>necessity ol using additional stock and carriers; and there were no
</p>
<p>additional stock and carriers rendered necessary in carrying it at the
</p>
<p>increased speed.
</p>
<p>On the route from Yermillion to Sioux Falls Mr. Vaile swore that it
</p>
<p>would require three men and twelve horses to make three trips upon
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>the then existing schedule, which was a schedule of fifteen hours, I
</p>
<p>think ; that to make the trips in ten hours would require five men and
</p>
<p>ten horses. In point of fact it required three men and twelve horses;
</p>
<p>and you will bear in mind, gentlemen, in that connection, that here, as
</p>
<p>everywhere, we propose to give you the men who 'actually did the work,
</p>
<p>not the evidence of somebody who has heard, never having been on the
</p>
<p>route, that such and such things occurred, but the men who did the
</p>
<p>work.
</p>
<p>On the route from Pueblo to Bosita, Dorsey swore that on the then
</p>
<p>present schedule it would take three men and twelve horses in one of the
</p>
<p>oaths pr sented. In the other oath he presented he swore it would take
</p>
<p>two men and six horses. In point of fact to carry the mail alone we
</p>
<p>shall show you that it took only one man and three horses. When they
</p>
<p>came to increase to seven trips, Dorsey swore that on a ten hours 7 sched-
</p>
<p>ule it would take seven men and thirty-eight animals Then he changed
</p>
<p>that to six men and eighteen animals. In point of fact we shall show
</p>
<p>you that it took two men and fourteen horses, making in all sixteen,
</p>
<p>while Dorsey said in one oath forty-five, and in the other twenty-four.
</p>
<p>On the route from Silverton to Parrott City, No. 38156, Mr. Dorsey
</p>
<p>swore thaton the then schedule of seven trips it would take three men and -
</p>
<p>ten horses, and that was substantially correct as to the number of men
</p>
<p>and horses then in use. But he said to reduce it to a fifteen-hour sched-
</p>
<p>ule it would take six men and thirty horses, when in point of fact it took
</p>
<p>only four men and twelve horses, making sixteen against Mr. Dorsey's
</p>
<p>statement of thirty-six more than double, and resulting therefore in a
</p>
<p>cost to the Government of nearly three times as much as it ought to
</p>
<p>have cost. There never were used beyond the four men and twelve
</p>
<p>horses in point of fact, and at times there were used only three men and
</p>
<p>nine horses. Four men and twelve horses was the outside limit with
</p>
<p>bad roads and everything of the kind.
</p>
<p>Mr. Miner's oath on the Bismarck and Fort Keogh line, in which he
</p>
<p>swore that 150 men and 150 horses would be required, I have already
</p>
<p>had occasion to comment upon. It is sufficient to say that it cannot be
</p>
<p>established by any evidence, the most liberal allowance that can be

</p>
<p>made, that there were ever needed upon that route for carrying the
</p>
<p>mail over 75 horses, and that there were never needed for carrying
</p>
<p>the mail over thirty-five men instead of 150. I might go on, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, and give you other instances of the same thing, but it is unneces-
</p>
<p>sary at present to worry you with them, and I pass on therefore to
</p>
<p>another feature of this case.
</p>
<p>You will bear in mind, gentlemen, that I called your attention to the
</p>
<p>fact that the statute, in providing for the transportation of the mail, says
</p>
<p>that it is the duty of the Second Assistant Postmaster-General to have,
</p>
<p>regard to productiveness, that being the only consideration actually
</p>
<p>specified. Now, what was the regard that was had for productiveness
</p>
<p>by Mr. Bradyf
</p>
<p>, n the mail route from Garland to Parrott City, 38145, the amount
</p>
<p>paid for carrying the mail was brought up by Brady to $31,343.76
</p>
<p>a year, and yet the average receipts of all the offices upon that route
</p>
<p>for the three years during which this order of Brady's continued were
</p>
<p>about $1,200 a year, and excluding offices otherwise supplied $194.96.
</p>
<p>Under Mr. Brady's order he made the Government pay $31,343 for
</p>
<p>carrying a mail, while the post-offices supplied by that route pro-
</p>
<p>duced but $194.96. And here let me say, gentlemen, that of course
</p>
<p>we do not claim that each mail-route is to pay its way. We only claim
</p>
<p>this: that in the language of the statute "due regard" shall be "had
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>to productiveness." We understand perfectly well that the pioneer in
</p>
<p>tlie West, the miner, is entitled to his mail facilities, entitled to means of
</p>
<p>communicating with his friends at home and with the business w^orld
</p>
<p>of the East, and we understand perfectly well that it is true economy
</p>
<p>on the part of the Government to give him those mail facilities. But we
</p>
<p>say in these allowances that Mr. Brady made upon mere local routes, in
</p>
<p>the way that I shall show you he utterly disregarded every consider-
</p>
<p>ation of productiveness, and that the only consideration of productive-
</p>
<p>ness that entered into his mind was how much the routes could be made to
</p>
<p>produce to the contractors and to himself. The productiveness of a given
</p>
<p>post-office, let me say, gentlemen, is ascertained in this way: It is the
</p>
<p>amount of stamps canceled on mail matter sent from that office, the theory
</p>
<p>being that the offices sending to a given office are to be credited with
</p>
<p>what they send. The office is to be credited with what it sends out, and
</p>
<p>that is treated fairly as the productiveness of the office. It is of course
</p>
<p>possible that in sending from an office there may be less mail matter
</p>
<p>going from it than to it; but in the long run the things must be just
</p>
<p>about equal, and that is the only way in which productiveness is ar-
</p>
<p>^rived at.
</p>
<p>On the route from Tres Alamos to Clifton the original pay was $1,568.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady carried up the amount to $27,913.59. The net revenues on
</p>
<p>that route, including every office located on the route, were in the first
</p>
<p>year $403.42, in the second year $513.41, and finally $789.12, so that on
</p>
<p>that route, originally contracted for at $1,568, the average of the re-
</p>
<p>ceipts did not exceed between $500 and $600, and Mr. Brady by
</p>
<p>his order made the Government pay for carrying the mail over it
</p>
<p>$27,913.69.
</p>
<p>On the route from Mineral Park to Pioche the original contract price
</p>
<p>was $2,982. Mr. Brady carried it up by his orders at one time to
</p>
<p>$52,033.38. The average revenue on that route was $670.68 a year. All
</p>
<p>the offices on that route were supplied by other mail routes, and yet I
</p>
<p>have credited, in making up the $070 to this route, every dollar of the
</p>
<p>revenues of all the offices upon the route. The service cost $52,000. The
</p>
<p>Government received $ ;70. The year after Mr. Brady made his order

</p>
<p>carrying it up, the revenues of the office, instead of increasing, ran from
</p>
<p>$761 down to $597, so that increase of speed reduced the revenue of the
</p>
<p>Government ; and that was an order of Mr. Brady's, made under a statu te
</p>
<p>which required him to have due regard to productiveness.
</p>
<p>On the route from Silverlon to Parrott City the original contract
</p>
<p>price was $1,488. Under Mr. Brady's order it was run to $15,796, and
</p>
<p>the revenue there did get to something in four figures. The average
</p>
<p>revenue ot that route was $2,979.49, but it cost the Government to get
</p>
<p>that revenue about $15,800.
</p>
<p>On the route from Trinidad to Madison, 38140, the original price was
</p>
<p>$338. Mr. Brady carried it up by his order to $4,290, and the average
</p>
<p>revenue for the three years of the dependent offices was $141.90.
</p>
<p>On route 38135, from Saint Charles to Greenhorn, which was originally
</p>
<p>let at $548 ; under Mr. Brady's order it was carried up to $3,945.60 a
</p>
<p>year. The average income of all the offices on that route during the
</p>
<p>three years was $102.72 a year.
</p>
<p>On route 44140, from Eugene City to Bridge Creek, in Oregon, the
</p>
<p>original contract was $2,468. Mr. Brady carried it up to $21,460.89,
</p>
<p>and the average yearly income of the route was $198.88.
</p>
<p>On route 41119, from Toquerville to Adairville, in Utah, the original
</p>
<p>contract price was $1,168 a year. Mr. Brady carried it up to $20,894.22.
</p>
<p>The annual income was $1,241, including all offices.
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>I think I have given yon, gentlemen, a sufficient number of specimens
</p>
<p>showing- how entirely, how absolutely, Mr. Brady disregarded product-
</p>
<p>iveness^ but perhaps I ought to call your attention a little in detail to
</p>
<p>one or two of these routes. They will at least present some amusing
</p>
<p>feat tires which will while away the tediousuess of your service.
</p>
<p>On the route from Mineral Park to Pioche, less than six months after
</p>
<p>the service commenced, an order was made adding two trips to the
</p>
<p>service and reducing the time from 84 hours to 60 hours, and he added
</p>
<p>to the original compensation of $2,982 the sum of $19,318. On the 23d
</p>
<p>of July, 1879, six mouths later, four more trips were added, and the
</p>
<p>original compensation of $2,982 was carried up by $29,733.39 more.
</p>
<p>That route, gentlemen, is a route in Wyoming, between the Central
</p>
<p>Pacific and the Southern Pacific Railroads, and running north and south
</p>
<p>between them, or was so. It was urged that there ought to be an in-
</p>
<p>crease upon that route of mail service because it formed a connection
</p>
<p>between the two lines, and yet we shall put before you the postmaster
</p>
<p>at Mineral Park, who opened every mail-bag that passed over that
</p>
<p>route either way, and he will show to you that that mail constantly
</p>
<p>arrived there without a single thing in the bag. There was nothing in
</p>
<p>the bag absolutely no mail matter; no postal^cards, no letters, no
</p>
<p>newspapers; nothing carried over that route, day in and day out, which
</p>
<p>was run up by Mr. Brady in this way from $2,982 to $52,000. The
</p>
<p>Post-Office Department introduced a system of what was known as
</p>
<p>mail bills, which were intended to show this. They were intended to
</p>
<p>show how many mail pouches started from a given place, the terminus
</p>
<p>of the route, and then show what time they got to the end of the route;
</p>
<p>otherwise it was possible for the post-office to be deceived in that a
</p>
<p>mail-bag delivered one day might have been the bag that ought to have
</p>
<p>been delivered on a previous day. For the purpose of timing the de-
</p>
<p>liveries they introduced this system of what was called mail bills. The
</p>
<p>mail hills were a printed form sent to the postmaster, and they were
</p>
<p>intended to show simply the number of pouches, but not intended to
</p>
<p>show the number of letters. To be faithful to their duty, these post-
</p>
<p>masters went to work and put on those mail bills a detailed statement,

<p>each day, of the number of letters, postal cards, and newspapers in the
</p>
<p>mail, and w r e have those mail bills, and shall produce them to you, for
</p>
<p>some 30 days, between the 19th of November and 24th of December,
</p>
<p>1879. YoiTwill bear in mind that that was after Mr. Brady's expedition
</p>
<p>had all been. made. In 18 of the 39 days the mail started from Mineral
</p>
<p>Park to go to Pioche without a letter or a postal card in it. It arrived
</p>
<p>at the other end without a letter or a paper or a postal card. In 18 of
</p>
<p>the 39 days therefore the mail went over that entire route, starting with,
</p>
<p>nothing, picking up nothing on the way, and arriving with nothing,
</p>
<p>and that was a route run up to $52,000, with due regard to productive-
</p>
<p>ness. In 21 of those 39 days there were carried over some portion of
</p>
<p>the route, going north, 9 postal cards and 29 letters, every one of those
</p>
<p>letters stopping at a way station and no one of them going through;
</p>
<p>the alleged inducement for making the increase being that it was ft-
</p>
<p>through route, connecting two railroads. There arrived at the other
</p>
<p>end, Pioche, during those 39 days, 133 letters, papers, and postal cards,
</p>
<p>and every one of those started from way stations, Io one of them
</p>
<p>came from the terminus of the route.
</p>
<p>On the route from Kearney to Kent, which was a route running north
</p>
<p>and south between two railroads which went east and west, the fact was
</p>
<p>that the mail going from Kearney towards Kent was always larger than
</p>
<p>the mail going the other way. it never was over 100 pounds in weight,
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>and of that 100 pounds all but 10 pounds were delivered before it got
</p>
<p>30 miles away from Kearney, and the remaining mail going over that
</p>
<p>route did not exceed on an average 10 pounds. For the service upon
</p>
<p>that route, commencing originally with one trip at $808 a year, Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady added first two trips and $1, 122.41, and then having given the
</p>
<p>three trips, he increased the speed 13 hours and added $2,200 for that.
</p>
<p>And yet, excluding Kearney and Kent, both of which were on railroads,
</p>
<p>and both of which received their revenues and their mail from the east
</p>
<p>and west communication, and not to any extent from the north and
</p>
<p>south communication, the entire revenues averaged from $227 to $513.
</p>
<p>On the Toquerville to Adairville route, in Utah, the mail started with
</p>
<p>100 pounds. Leaving Toquerville, it dwindled down to 10 pounds, tiieu
</p>
<p>sometimes, at a way station, went up as high as 25 pounds, though after
</p>
<p>it got 30 miles away from its original starting point it rarely exceeded
</p>
<p>an average of between 5 and 10 pounds. And yet upon that route
</p>
<p>$12,718.22 was paid to reduce the time from 60 to 33 hours, and $7,000
</p>
<p>was paid to add 5 trips to the original one, which cost $1,108 ; so that
</p>
<p>that route which originally started with $1,168 was run up to $19,311,
</p>
<p>and the revenues, deducting the offices which were on other routes,
</p>
<p>averaged from $386 50 in one year to $767 in another year, and uniformly
</p>
<p>decreasing as expedition and the sums paid by the Government increased.
</p>
<p>1 -On the route from Dalles to Baker City, in Oregon, the largest mail ever
</p>
<p>carried, which was composed chiefly of public documents, was five or six
</p>
<p>hundred pounds. That was carried, starting from Dalles and going east
</p>
<p>towards Canyon City. At the outside, between Baker City and Canyon
</p>
<p>City, the other half of the route, the largest amount was 200 pounds,
</p>
<p>the smallest 30 to 40 pounds, and the average certainly not over 50
</p>
<p>pounds. One witness will state the average, 1 think, as not being over
</p>
<p>20 pounds. And yet on that route from Dalles to Baker City, which
</p>
<p>started at a compensation of $8,288, it was run up to $72,520, and it
</p>
<p>was not only not a through route, but it was so slow a route that mat-
</p>
<p>ter starting from the east end of the route and intended to go to the
</p>
<p>west end of the route was never sent over the route, but was sent by a

</p>
<p>longer and quicker route ; and in the same way, matter starting from
</p>
<p>the west end of the line, and intended to go to the east end, was never
</p>
<p>sent over it, but sent around this way [illustrating]. And not only that,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, but the two stations east and west from the terminal sta-
</p>
<p>tions that is to say, the station which was about 12 or 15 miles west of
</p>
<p>the eastern end, and the station which was about 10 or 12 miles east of
</p>
<p>the western end sent their mail matter east and west, roundabout,
</p>
<p>around by the other way in preference to going over this route, be-
</p>
<p>cause it went more rapidly. And yet that route, so thoroughly local
</p>
<p>and so thoroughly without any necessity for any such rate of speed
</p>
<p>or compensation, was carried up by Brady to $72,520.
</p>
<p>On the route fiom Pueblo to Kosita, which was down in Colorado, the
</p>
<p>contract price starting originally at $338 was run up to $8,148. The
</p>
<p>mail matter that went from Pueblo, about half way, weighed from 40
</p>
<p>to 60 pounds, and, in the language of the witness in reply to a question,
</p>
<p>"beyond that the mail was light." He seemed to think that a mail that
</p>
<p>weighed from 40 to 60 pounds was a heavy one. The through mail did
</p>
<p>not consist usually of more than three or four letters, because theteiini-
</p>
<p>nal points were getting their mails by other routes more satisfactorily,
</p>
<p>and the only considerable intermediate place had another communica-
</p>
<p>tion also, by which it got a considerable portion of its mail matter.
</p>
<p>The entire revenues of offices dependent on that route were $2,179; but
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>after Mr. Brady had put on these large increases the revenues ran down
</p>
<p>to $1,57^
</p>
<p>On the route from Trinidad to Madison the original pay was $338.
</p>
<p>It was run up to $4,290.30, and in the letter of John W. Dorsey asking
</p>
<p>for expedition, he states to Mr. Brady, and Mr. Brady accepted it as
</p>
<p>true, though his own record showed him it was not true, that the
</p>
<p>mails were heavy, and that heavy mail was an average of 20 pounds,
</p>
<p>and that 20 pounds was sufficient to take in the way of expedition,
</p>
<p>through Brady's kindness, $2,758 a year out of the Treasury.
</p>
<p>On the route from Rawlins to White Eiver, out in Wyoming, almost
</p>
<p>precisely the same condition of tilings existed. I will not go over those
</p>
<p>in detail. The same is true of other routes, Vermillion to Sioux Falls,
</p>
<p>Canyon City to Fort McDermitt, and others which I 'have here on my
</p>
<p>memorandum, but I forbear to trouble you with them.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, there was another condition of things. Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>made orders for expedition and paid large sums for expedition where
</p>
<p>he got nothing for it and where his own record should have shown him
</p>
<p>that he got nothing for it. On a route in California, from Redding to
</p>
<p>Alturas, the original contract price was $5,988; Brady ran it up to
</p>
<p>$41,916.66. Let me say in passing here that I sometimes say Brady ran
</p>
<p>a thing up. You will find occasionally that the formal order is
</p>
<p>actually signed by Brady's chief clerk; but I hold Brady responsible
</p>
<p>for all of these increases, and I think that I shall be able to show you
</p>
<p>that I properly do so. Now, he ran that up to $41,916.66. He did it in this
</p>
<p>way: Within five months after the contract went into effect he added
</p>
<p>two trips and reduced the schedule time from 108 hours to 72 hours,
</p>
<p>and added to the existing pay of $8,982 the sum of $29,940.60, making a
</p>
<p>total of $38,922, of which sum $17,964 was paid for the alleged increase
</p>
<p>of speed. The nominal result of the order in that case, looking at it on
</p>
<p>the paper, was to increase the speed from 1.65 to 2.58 miles an hour.
</p>
<p>And yet, gentlemen, it is an indisputable fact that that mail, when Brady
</p>
<p>made his order to pay $17,964 for reducing the time to 72 hours, was in
</p>
<p>point of fact being carried over that route in somewhere about 40 hours.
</p>
<p>The Government was paying $8,000 and the mail was being carried in

</p>
<p>from 41 to 44 hours in summer and 65 hours in winter. The Government
</p>
<p>was paying $8,000 for getting its mail carried in that way. The nom-
</p>
<p>inal time was 120 hours. But Mr. Brady stepped in, and with the
</p>
<p>liberality that he exercised with other people's money, he paid $17,964
</p>
<p>under the pretense that it was for getting the mails carried in 80
</p>
<p>houis, when, in fact, they vere already being carried in from 40 to
</p>
<p>44 hours in sum mer and 65 hours in winter. The parties themselves were
</p>
<p>not carrying the mall at that time, and they had a sub-contract with
</p>
<p>people owning a line of stages, and those people, from their interest in
</p>
<p>carrying passengers and carrying express matter, were required to go
</p>
<p>over that route in from 41 to 44 hours, and they had to take the mail
</p>
<p>at that rate. But Mr. Brady stepped in and with great liberality paid
</p>
<p>seventeen thousand and odd hundred dollars, when they were entirely
</p>
<p>satisfied with their $8,000 for that. I am speaking of the sub contract-
</p>
<p>ors. I shall have occasion to call your attention to the fact that of
</p>
<p>this seventeen thousand and odd hundred dollars which Mr. Brady was
</p>
<p>paying for getting the mails in thirty-odd hours longer than that they
</p>
<p>wi-Te being carried in, the larger portion went into the pockets of the
</p>
<p>parties here in Washington who got the expedition, and only an incon-
</p>
<p>siderable portion into the hands of the men who were actually carrying
</p>
<p>the mail. Brady at a later day added $5,988 more.
</p>
<p>There were other cases where the mail was expedited, and large
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>sums paid for it, only to have it arrive at its terminus where it was to
</p>
<p>connect with another route, just too late to go out, and where all the
</p>
<p>time of expedition was lost by lying over Avaiting for another and con-
</p>
<p>necting route, where really, in point of fact, nothing was gained save
</p>
<p>what might have been gained at the little local post-offices along the
</p>
<p>route. Nothing was gained in any manner practically. There are a
</p>
<p>series of those cases. I will not stop to call your attention to them in
</p>
<p>detail now. You will be presented with the evidence as to them as it
</p>
<p>comes along.
</p>
<p>There are other cases, gentlemen, where Mr. Brady made orders re-
</p>
<p>quiring the mail to be carried in an impossible time a time that the
</p>
<p>postmasters, the contractors, and everybody on the route represented
</p>
<p>to him it was impossible to carry it in and Mr. Brady, in spite of remon-
</p>
<p>strances, insisted upon that being the schedule time. He sent to the post-
</p>
<p>masters directions to make a schedule of departures and arrivals which
</p>
<p>should come within the time he fixed, and they kept sending them back,
</p>
<p>putting the schedule days longer than he fixed, and telling him it was
</p>
<p>impossible to do it in the time he said. He repeated right over that it
</p>
<p>must be done in that time; and, finally, one witness said he got so dis-
</p>
<p>gusted with Mr. Brady's sending him schedules to fix it within impossible
</p>
<p>time, that when he used to get these schedules, postmaster as he was,
</p>
<p>and disrespectful as the conduct was, " I took the thing and threw it
</p>
<p>into the waste-paper basket, and paid no attention to it." The result was
</p>
<p>that the mail could not be carried in time. It then became necessary
</p>
<p>to impose fines for not carrying the mail in time, and to a considerable
</p>
<p>extent fines were imposed ; but the result was that the unfortunate
</p>
<p>sub -con tract or who had made a sub-contract with Mr. Dorsey to carry the
</p>
<p>mail had to pay all the fines and Mr. Dorsey sat here in Washington
</p>
<p>and received his money net, the result being that in' one or two quarters
</p>
<p>the unfortunate contractor had to pay the United States practically
</p>
<p>something for the pleasure of carrying the mail, while Mr. Dorsey sat
</p>
<p>here in Washington and got several thousand dollars put into his
</p>
<p>pocket. I have mentioned one route, that is, a route in New Mexico.
</p>
<p>There is a route in Oregon where substantially the same thing was done ;

</p>
<p>and as to that route Mr. Brady did wake up to the fact that it was impossi-
</p>
<p>ble to carry the mail on the time he fixed, certainly in winter, and therefore
</p>
<p>he made a movable schedule, which he said was the same. In the first
</p>
<p>place, he paid a large sum for reducing the time for carrying the mail
</p>
<p>from sixty hours to forty hours. In the winter it was utterly impossible to
</p>
<p>carry it on that time. In the summer it might possibly have been carried.
</p>
<p>So he made an amendment of his order, and provided that in winter
</p>
<p>it should be fifty hours and in summer it should be thirty hours. He
</p>
<p>said that made an average of forty hours, and therefore he would pay
</p>
<p>the same amount as he paid before, and he assumed that it was the
</p>
<p>same thing to the people out there if they got their mail matter in
</p>
<p>the summer in thirty hours instead of forty, und in the winter in fifty
</p>
<p>hours instead of forty.
</p>
<p>There is a single instance, possibly two instances, of another class of
</p>
<p>frauds upon the Government under Mr. Brady's action. There were
</p>
<p>two routes in Colorado as originally established, one coming from here
</p>
<p>[indicating on map] and running up to- Lake City and then crossing-
</p>
<p>over to Ouray. There was another which started from Lake City, went
</p>
<p>up to Barnum, and out to Los Pjnos [indicating on map]. The
</p>
<p>route across the mountain was altered by an order so as to go around
</p>
<p>the mountain instead of across it. It probably was a wise order to
</p>
<p>make j but you will see that Mr. Brady was paying for carrying the
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>mail over that route before. That route was a six-times-a-week route.
</p>
<p>He transferred the other route over precisely the same track, the mail
</p>
<p>matter on both being carried by the same man, in the same wagon, or
</p>
<p>on the same horses. The postmasters along the route assumed that
</p>
<p>there was but one route there, and that, of course, the other had been
</p>
<p>discontinued, and therefore they only made returns on one route. Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady sent to them with some indignation to know why they did not
</p>
<p>make returns upon the other route. One of them sat down and wrote
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady a long and detailed statement, showing that the mails on
</p>
<p>the alleged two routes, which were identical in every way, were carried
</p>
<p>by the same man, upon the same horses, or with the same wagon, as the
</p>
<p>case might be, and that he could not believe it was possible that the
</p>
<p>department was going to do so absurd a thing as to pay a man twice
</p>
<p>over for doing one service. Those letters remained on the files, no at-
</p>
<p>tention being paid to them for months and years; the double payment
</p>
<p>continuing, until finally the scandal became so great that it was neces-
</p>
<p>sary to revoke the order and make only the single payment.
</p>
<p>There were a large number of other orders, petty in their character,
</p>
<p>and yet significant as showing the spirit which prevailed in the Post-
</p>
<p>Office Department during the time that Mr. Brady was Second Assistant
</p>
<p>Postmaster General. For instance, we find this condition of things:
</p>
<p>On the route from Verm illion to Sioux Falls, after there had been the con-
</p>
<p>tract made and everything of that sort, there came an order to add
</p>
<p>Brighton to the route and to give the contractor an additional sum for
</p>
<p>supplying it. It was a small sum originally, but applying the geomet-
</p>
<p>rical proportion resulting from expedition, it became at one time a con-
</p>
<p>siderable sum. But no matter about the size of the sum; the point is
</p>
<p>that the mail always went directly through Brighton, and it was no
</p>
<p>addition to the route to supply Brighton ; yet they considered it an ad-
</p>
<p>dition, and Brady directed that payment should be made for it. A little
</p>
<p>further on the post-office of Kidder was moved. The moving of that
</p>
<p>post-office reduced the route three miles. There never was any reduc-
</p>
<p>tion for the saving thus made. If there was an alleged increase of two
</p>
<p>miles in the one case it was paid for; if there was an actual decrease

</p>
<p>of three miles in the other case it was not deducted.
</p>
<p>On the route from Trinidad to Madison we find this condition of
</p>
<p>things : The route, as originally established, started from Madison and
</p>
<p>went here [indicating on the map], and then over to Trinidad, which is
</p>
<p>here [indicating]. Certain parties living up at Eaton petitioned to have
</p>
<p>mail service given them from that route [indicating], a distance of about
</p>
<p>seven miles. Instead of making the order, Mr. Brady made an order
</p>
<p>that this route should be wrenched around and Eaton supplied from it,
</p>
<p>making the additional distance about twenty- three miles, and he paid
</p>
<p>for twenty three miles of service instead of paying for seven miles. He
</p>
<p>supplied the people less directly and less to their satisfaction, and by
</p>
<p>twisting the route around in that way he made it so long that at the
</p>
<p>existing rate of speed the mail did not get through in a day. So he
</p>
<p>had a good excuse for issuing an order for expedition and increasing the
</p>
<p>speed, and the result was that there was an allowance of two or three
</p>
<p>thousand dollars, and perhaps more, simply to get the mail through in
</p>
<p>the day time, when, if he had complied with the request of the peti-
</p>
<p>tioners and supplied that post-office from the other route, it would have
</p>
<p>gone through in the day time and the money would have been saved
</p>
<p>and the people better satisfied. In point of tact, when Mr. Brady went
</p>
<p>out, that service at Eaton, which cost under him something over three
</p>
<p>44
</p>
<p>thousand dollars, was contracted for from the other route at something
</p>
<p>like two hundred and eighty dollars a year.
</p>
<p>There was another case, in which a post-office called " Agate " was
</p>
<p>added to a route by a spur on it. They could not get the mail carried
</p>
<p>for the amount which the law authorized to be paid for carrying that
</p>
<p>distance, and there never was a single mail carried over that route.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady's attention was called to the fact that there never was any
</p>
<p>mail carried over the route, th%t they could not get it there by any pos-
</p>
<p>sibility; and yet, under a perversion of a provision in the law which
</p>
<p>requires that when you discontinue service you shall allow the con-
</p>
<p>tractor a month's pay for the discontinue service on the ground that
</p>
<p>you have thereby inflicted some injury upon him, Mr. Brady first or-
</p>
<p>dered the service on, and left it on a couple of months, paying for the
</p>
<p>service, though there was none, and though the contractor never went
</p>
<p>over the route one trip. He then ordered it discontinued on the repre-
</p>
<p>sentations of the postmaster that there was no mail, and paid the con-
</p>
<p>tractor the month's extra pay for the injury that had been inflicted
</p>
<p>upon him by discontinuing a service which he never had performed.
</p>
<p>There is another case on the route from JSilverton to Parrott City.
</p>
<p>Animas City was alleged to be added to the route, and to extend the
</p>
<p>route some ten or twelve miles, and for that a very considerable sum
</p>
<p>was allowed to the contractor. It was a considerable sum originally,
</p>
<p>and was increased by expedition considerably more. Yet, in point of
</p>
<p>fact, the mail was all the time carried through Animas City, and the
</p>
<p>postmasters had notified Mr. Brady constantly that the mail came
</p>
<p>through Animas City. The official records of the department show that
</p>
<p>the mail passed from point to point naming them and one of those
</p>
<p>points was Atrimas City. Yet Mr. Brady, under some pretense, claimed
</p>
<p>that to include Animas City added ten or twelve miles, and on that ac-
</p>
<p>count allowed a very considerable sum out of the Treasury.
</p>
<p>There is another case on the route from Toquerville to Adairville,
</p>
<p>in Utah, where we have this extraordinary condition of things: The
</p>
<p>terminal post-office at Adairville was discontinued by the Post-Office
</p>
<p>Department, say, in August, and Mr. Brady was notified of that fact.

</p>
<p>That took off ten miles at one end of the route, and the mail after that
</p>
<p>time stopped at Pahreah. Now, what did Mr. Brady do ? He wanted
</p>
<p>to expedite the speed upon that route, and to allow the contractor a
</p>
<p>very considerable sum for doing it. Therefore, he made an order expe-
</p>
<p>diting the service over the entire route, including the ten miles which
</p>
<p>was practically discontinued because the post-office was abolished, and
</p>
<p>of which he had notice. He directed that the order expediting the serv-
</p>
<p>ice take effect over the entire route, and paid for the expedited service.
</p>
<p>This order was, say, of the 1st of September. Then, four days after-
</p>
<p>ward, he made an order cutting off the service from Pahreah to Adair-
</p>
<p>ville, which had, in point of fact, been cut off weeks before, as the
</p>
<p>records of his own department showed him. Then he allowed the con-
</p>
<p>tractor a month's extra pay, but reckoned it upon the increased allow-
</p>
<p>ance caused by the expedition, and not upon the original pay. If he
</p>
<p>had cut off that end of the route and allowed the month's extra pay
</p>
<p>before he made the expedition, he would have paid the contractor for
</p>
<p>the month's extra pay but one or two hundred dollars. He waited until
</p>
<p>he had made the expedition, though he had the evidence in his office
</p>
<p>that the route was to be shortened, and then allowed the month's
</p>
<p>extra pay, and the result was to carry the amount which was allowed
</p>
<p>the contractor as a bonus up to a thousand dollars, as I recollect it.
</p>
<p>There was in all these things, gentlemen, an utter disregard of the
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>interests of the Government. There never was a time, so far as I can.
</p>
<p>see, and I think we shall satisfy you, when the interests of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment were considered under Mr. Brady when they came in conflict with
</p>
<p>the interest of these contractors. In that case every construction was
</p>
<p>given against the Government and every opportunity embraced to take
</p>
<p>money out of the Treasury for the benefit of these defendants.
</p>
<p>There is another class of cases: The contractors, as I have said to
</p>
<p>you, bid very low; on many routes they bid so low that they could not
</p>
<p>afford to perform the service. So low, as I shall have occasion to show
</p>
<p>you, that they had to make contracts with others to carry the mail,
</p>
<p>and to pay more than they were getting from the government. Hav-
</p>
<p>ing made those contracts, they were bound to commence service on
</p>
<p>the 1st of July, 1878. If they did not commence service on a route
</p>
<p>they were liable to be declared failing contractors. A man who becomes
</p>
<p>a failing contractor upon one route is, under the law and practice of the
</p>
<p>department, a failing contractor upon all routes, and all the money due
</p>
<p>him upon any route or that may become due him on any route is taken
</p>
<p>to supply the deficiency, and he is debarred from any service under the
</p>
<p>department. Now, several of the routes upon which they bid so low
</p>
<p>they did not start on the 1st of July, nor for a long time afterward.
</p>
<p>There were all sorts of excuses. There were, to keep the records
</p>
<p>straight, threats from Brady that he would declare them failing con-
</p>
<p>tractors if they did not $tart it. In point of fact, we shall show to you,
</p>
<p>to your satisfaction, that Mr. Brady stood by and let these contractors
</p>
<p>fail to perform the service, while they were getting up petitions and all
</p>
<p>the paraphernalia needed to apparently justify Mr. Brady in making
</p>
<p>orders for expedition by which he could run up and transform a losing
</p>
<p>contract into a contract largely profitable; and yet in the mean time
</p>
<p>they did not perform the service, because it would have been a losing
</p>
<p>service. In those cases you will bear in mind also, when it comes to the
</p>
<p>affidavits for expedition, that inasmuch as the contractor had not done
</p>
<p>a minute's service on the route, his affidavit in which he swears to the
</p>
<p>number of men and horses then being used, is necessarily a false affi-
</p>
<p>davit, because there was no number then being used, and Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>used.

<p>knew from the records of the department that there were none being
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen of the jury, I will pass all this class of frauds, and
</p>
<p>direct your attention to some other kinds of misconduct which prevailed
</p>
<p>in connection with this mail service. I wish to avoid repetition as
</p>
<p>much as possible, but I must do a good deal of it. To seemingly jus-
</p>
<p>tify Mr. Brady in doing this sort of thing there had to be some-
</p>
<p>thing as a pretense and as an excuse for it. What was the excuse, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen? Petitions! petitions from alleged people living along the
</p>
<p>routes; petitions gotten up by the contractors; petitions known by
</p>
<p>Brady to be so gotten up ; petitions transmitted in some cases by Dor-
</p>
<p>sey, the United States Senator. He was not interested on the record
</p>
<p>in the matter, but sent a man out himself, with his own letters, to get
</p>
<p>up petitions and everything of that kind. The work was done, the pe-
</p>
<p>titions were obtained, and they were sent to Stephen W. Dorsey, the
</p>
<p>United States Senator, and Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey, this disinterested
</p>
<p>man, forwarded them to the Second Assistant Postmaster General, with
</p>
<p>a letter on United States Senate paper, as a disinterested man looking
</p>
<p>after the interests of some people who were not even his constituents,
</p>
<p>and saying that these were petitions which had come into his hands
</p>
<p>and which seemed to make a strong case for expedition, and he hoped
</p>
<p>it would be granted. Now, as to these petitions, of course we recog-
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>nize two things : the first is that everybody has a right to petition, and
</p>
<p>the next is that almost everybody will sign any petition that is thrust
</p>
<p>in their face. Certainly everybody along any mail route will sign any
</p>
<p>petition which looks to the idea of an increase of mail service, provided
</p>
<p>it is not to be done at their expense, but at the expense of somebody
</p>
<p>else. We would all of us like mail service if we happened not to live
</p>
<p>in a city. We would like to have the mail come by our door at least
</p>
<p>two or three times a day, and would deem ourselves perfectly justified
</p>
<p>in honestly signing a petition urging the Second Assistant Postmaster-
</p>
<p>General to make arrangements of that kind. We understand perfectly
</p>
<p>well that the Second Assistant Postmaster-General, when one of those
</p>
<p>petitions comes to him, if he is an honest and efficient officer, will say:
</p>
<p>"This seems to me to represent the wishes of the people along the
</p>
<p>route. They state what they want entirely without regard to the claims
</p>
<p>of other localities upon the money which Congress has appropriated.
</p>
<p>Their statement is made without regard to the question as to who is to pay
</p>
<p>the expense. They are frequently, almost always, without any knowledge
</p>
<p>of what the increased expense will be. Now I, as an honest Second As-
</p>
<p>sistant Postmaster-General, will look the field over. I have these peti-
</p>
<p>tions, which I assume tobe genuine" Lshall show you directly that hehad
</p>
<p>no business to assume that "and to represent the wishes of the people.
</p>
<p>Now ought they to be granted? What is the productiveness of this
</p>
<p>route? What is its character? Through what part of the country
</p>
<p>does it run ? What is the population there? 'What justification have
</p>
<p>I for taxing the people of the East to give daily mail service at a high
</p>
<p>rate of speed along a route in a Western Territory where twenty-one days
</p>
<p>out of thirty-nine there does not pass a letter over the route ?" I shall
</p>
<p>show you snch a case as this, gentlemen, and yet there were petitions
</p>
<p>in favor of expedition on that route. His duty, we submit to you, as an
</p>
<p>honest Second Assistant Postmaster-General, in view of these petitions,
</p>
<p>was to look the field over and to decide what ought fairly and properly
</p>
<p>to be done. He ought to have said with regard to the case I last men-
</p>
<p>tioned, "This I cannot do; it is absurd to pay $20,000 or $30,000 for
</p>
<p>increase of either trips or speed when there is no mail matter going

<p>over the route ; I cannot do it, it makes no difference who comes to me
</p>
<p>urging it." It will be contended, and it is undoubtedly a fact, that
</p>
<p>members of Congress and Senators signed papers urging an increase.
</p>
<p>They w r ere representing their locality. They were representing the
</p>
<p>interests of their constituents. But we shall show to you that at least
</p>
<p>one United States Senator urging such increase was the paid agent of
</p>
<p>these defendants.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. Who was that?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I will show you if you dare to put him on the stand.
</p>
<p>[Mr. Chandler made a remark in an undertone which was inaudible
</p>
<p>to the reporter.]
</p>
<p>. Mr. BLISS. [To Mr. Chandler.] What do you say ?
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. He says you should give his name.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I have not given the names of any witnesses so far, and
</p>
<p>I do not propose to pick him out and give his name. He will get noto-
</p>
<p>riety enough when he comes, if he comes. I simply say we propose to
</p>
<p>show it. But I will further say that I do not believe he will come.
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. Was he here before ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I will not specify him. Senators would come and Mem-
</p>
<p>bers would come, or they would sign petitions or do something of that
</p>
<p>sort, and Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. [Interposing.] If your honor please, I wish to ask
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>whether it is proper for Mr. Bliss to go on and argue the case now.
</p>
<p>We have listened here for at least twenty minutes to an argument pure
</p>
<p>and' simple as distinct from a statement of the facts which he proposes
</p>
<p>to prove.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Not at all.
</p>
<p>The COURT. 1 understand this to bean anticipatory statement of the
</p>
<p>facts.
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. No, your honor; it is an argument as to what is the
</p>
<p>duty of the Second Assistant Postmaster-General. It is not a state-
</p>
<p>ment of what Mr. Bliss is going to prove, but it is a statement of what
</p>
<p>he would do and how he would manage were he himself in this high
</p>
<p>office it it should ever be his fortune to reach it.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Misfortune.
</p>
<p>Mr. CHAKDLI R. I do not think it is proper for him so to proceed.
</p>
<p>He is not upon facts.
</p>
<p>The COURT. He is applying the facts which he expects to prove.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Resuming.] Then again on the other side, gentlemen, as
</p>
<p>to petitions, we shall claim to you that while these defendants had a
</p>
<p>perfect right to get up petitions they had not a right to resort to decep-
</p>
<p>tion of Government officers in getting them up. They had not a right
</p>
<p>to direct petitions to be gotten up by one man but not to be in the same
</p>
<p>form, because that tact might show that it was a mere bogus piece of
</p>
<p>business. They had not the right to do that. They had a perfect right
</p>
<p>to represent the case to the Postmaster General and to seek to get
</p>
<p>from him increase or expedition, iopking out for their own interests as
</p>
<p>we all do. But they had not the right, unless they wanted to get them-
</p>
<p>selves into trouble, to go into a system of deception in .connection with
</p>
<p>these petitions. They had not the right to alter petitions or to present
</p>
<p>petitions with forged or altered names. Now let me tell you, as to the
</p>
<p>petitions, that we shall present to you a witness who will tell you of Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady's declaration that they were a mere sham and pretense, intended
</p>
<p>to cover and protect him, and 'that was all there was in them. Take
</p>
<p>for instance the route from Kearney to Kent. On that route we have
</p>
<p>this remarkable condition of affairs: The people desired an increase of

</p>
<p>trips. They did not care for an increase of speed. A petition was sent
</p>
<p>from here by one of these defendants, Miner, I think, for circulation
</p>
<p>to parties on the route, asking for an increase of trips. The petition
</p>
<p>was circulated a little, and then by a careless accident an inkstand was
</p>
<p>upset njjon it which blotted it so badly that the party to whom it was
</p>
<p>sent would not return it. So he himself wrote, or got a friend to write,
</p>
<p>another petition, which was a precise copy of the first. That petition
</p>
<p>contained no word about an increase of speed. It contained only a
</p>
<p>request for an increase of trips. It was generally signed and sent here
</p>
<p>and there was obtained upon it the indorsement of a United States
</p>
<p>Senator. The petition was tiled in the Post Office Department, but be-
</p>
<p>fore it was filed there was inserted in it in an entirely different handwrit-
</p>
<p>ing, at the end of a paragraph where there was a blank space on the line,
</p>
<p>the words, "Ami thirteen hours," so as to make it a petition not only for
</p>
<p>an increase of trips, but for an increase of speed; yet that alteration
</p>
<p>would almost stare a blind man in the face, and was obvious to every-
</p>
<p>body. There was not another paper on iile in the department which
</p>
<p>said anything about increase of speed except the affidavit of one of
</p>
<p>these defendants in favor of it and stating the, number of men and
</p>
<p>horses. There was not a paper of any kind with reference to increase
</p>
<p>of speed in the department except the affidavit and this altered petition
</p>
<p>taken by Mr. Brady as his sole authority for ordering an increase of
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>speed, which took from the Treasury a large number of thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>We shall place before you the man to whom that petition was sent, the
</p>
<p>man who wrote the petition to take the place of the blotted paper, the
</p>
<p>man who returned it here. We will place before you some of the people
</p>
<p>who signed it. All will say to you that there never was on that peti-
</p>
<p>tion, up to the time it was sent here to one of these defendants, a sug-
</p>
<p>gestion of any increase of speed that the words were added here by one
</p>
<p>of these defendants. I think we shall be able to show you who added
</p>
<p>them. We shall be uncharitable enough, gentlemen, in that connection
</p>
<p>to ask you to believe that if the petition originally sent West had not
</p>
<p>been so destroyed by being blotted, but had come back here, the words
</p>
<p>"And thirteen hours," if added, would have been added in the hand-
</p>
<p>writing of the petition and the ear-marks of the fraud would not be so
</p>
<p>obvious.
</p>
<p>There are other routes upon which the same sort of business was
</p>
<p>done. There are petitions where the words u faster time" are inter-
</p>
<p>lined and various things of that sort more or less obvious upon them,
</p>
<p>all either over erasures or in different and easily distinguishable hand-
</p>
<p>writing. In one case we shall show you this: There were two routes,
</p>
<p>one from Mineral Park to Pioche, the route over which there. were no
</p>
<p>letters passing, as I have already told you, and the other from Min-
</p>
<p>eral Park to Ehrenberg. Both routes terminated at Mineral Park.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady ordered expedition on both of those routes, and lie ordered
</p>
<p>it upon petitions which bear on their face the evidence that they were
</p>
<p>not prepared for use as applicable to those routes. The terminus of
</p>
<p>the route and the territory in which it is situated are altered on each of
</p>
<p>those petitions and the signatures to the petitions are the same. The
</p>
<p>petitioners state that they get mail matter along that route. The names
</p>
<p>are identical. And yet the fifty or sixty names I believe you will be
</p>
<p>satisfied from inspection were all written by not exceeding six or seven
</p>
<p>persons. The same names are on both petitions, both petitions are
</p>
<p>altered, and both petitions are so altered that the most casual examina-
</p>
<p>tion will indicate that they could not have been intended to apply to
</p>
<p>the route to which they are made to apply. Mr. Brady used both of

</p>
<p>those petitions as his basis for making orders which took from the
</p>
<p>Treasury large sums of money for expedition. And that, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>ought to dispose of the subject of petitions. Why, there is not "cover"
</p>
<p>enough in them to protect Brady in an indictment for indecent exposure.
</p>
<p>As to these petitions, there are some other things that I desire to call
</p>
<p>to your attention. The route from Bismarck to Tongue Kiver runs
</p>
<p>through the region where General Ouster was killed. It was 301
</p>
<p>miles long, and over the whole length there was not a person living;
</p>
<p>there was not a cabin. The Indians roamed over it so freely that
</p>
<p>after Mr. Miner had entered into a contract to run the route for $2,350
</p>
<p>a year, which was very much less than the work could be done for,
</p>
<p>he came in and filed all sorts of petitions to show that it was impos-
</p>
<p>sible to run the mail over the route without a company of soldiers to
</p>
<p>protect the mail carrier from Indians ; that there was no mail matter
</p>
<p>and no necessity for the route anyway; yet, within sixty days after-
</p>
<p>wards, this same Mr. Miner w r as coming in with affidavits alleging that
</p>
<p>the country was so full of people, that they were so intelligent, and that
</p>
<p>they wanted mail facilities so much that there was great need for expe-
</p>
<p>dition and increase; and I think before he got through he ran the orig-
</p>
<p>inal sum of $2,350 a year up to $70,000 a year. When they commenced
</p>
<p>on that route they had to send a party out to build their stations. They
</p>
<p>employed a man whom we shall place before you, a sturdy, respectable,
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>and well-to-do contractor of considerable means and large experience^
</p>
<p>to go over the route with a party of twelve or fifteen men and build a
</p>
<p>station every seventeen miles. They sent there to superintend the
</p>
<p>business at different times John W. Dorsey and Mr. Eerdell. Mr. Eer-
</p>
<p>dell, as the representative of these parties, went to the contractor, Mr.
</p>
<p>Peunell, and said to him, "I want you to take your gang of men and
</p>
<p>have them sign a petition stating that they are residents of a town or
</p>
<p>settlement which is some forty or fifty miles north of our line, and that
</p>
<p>they want mail service from their residence down to our line, and rec-
</p>
<p>ommend that one of your gang be made the postmaster at this suppo-
</p>
<p>sititious place, and we will get an order to have the service put on and
</p>
<p>will get pay for it." The contractor was too honest a man to do any-
</p>
<p>thing of that kind, but the proposition shows what these parties were
</p>
<p>doing and how they were getting up petitions.
</p>
<p>We shall show to you, gentlemen, on one route a petition for an in-
</p>
<p>crease of service in Oregon, which petition occupies half a sheet of fools-
</p>
<p>cap paper, coming down to within three or four lines of the end of the
</p>
<p>paper. There are then some three or four names, and then there are
</p>
<p>pasted on to it several sheets of signatures of people. We shall show
</p>
<p>to you that every one of those signers lived in Utah, more than a thou-
</p>
<p>sand miles from this route, and had no connection with it in any way,
</p>
<p>but that the names pasted on to that petition were signed for an entirely
</p>
<p>different purpose, and being in the petition mill of these contractors
</p>
<p>they were undoubtedly taken from the heading where they were origi-
</p>
<p>nally placed, attached to this piece of paper, and made to do service as
</p>
<p>a petition of citizens living along the Oregon route, recommending ex-
</p>
<p>pedition and increase of service, when in point of fact none of the men
</p>
<p>lived within a thousand miles of the route. I doubt whether any of the
</p>
<p>signers ever heard of either terminus or of any post-office on the route.
</p>
<p>We shall show you another case where the petition that came here
</p>
<p>was a petition asking for a reduction to thirty-six hours as the sched-
</p>
<p>ule time, and yet that the affidavit of the contractor is an affidavit,
</p>
<p>looking to a reduction to twenty-six hours; and we shall show you that
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady promptly made the order reducing the time to twenty-six
</p>

</p>
<p>hours, and providing for the paying of a large sum of money into the
</p>
<p>contractor's pocket by the reduction. When the order got out into the
</p>
<p>locality the postmasters, contractors, and everybody said "this cannot
</p>
<p>be intended; we do not want a tweiity-six-hour schedule; it is an ab-
</p>
<p>surdity ; we have not asked for it ; it does not improve our connections
</p>
<p>or benefit us at all ; there must have been some mistake of a copyist or
</p>
<p>something of that sort." So they performed the service in thirty-six
</p>
<p>hours for weeks, thinking they were doing everything they ought to do,
</p>
<p>but they finally found out that Mr. Brady, in the beneficence of his
</p>
<p>generosity, had chosen to reduce the service over the route ten hours
</p>
<p>less than any petition had asked for, and that the only man who ever
</p>
<p>mentioned the time of twenty-six hours as desired upon that route was
</p>
<p>the contractor here in Washington, who made affidavits as to the num-
</p>
<p>ber of men and horses that would be needed to carry the mail in twenty-
</p>
<p>six hours, and yet who had no knowledge on the subject. I may say in
</p>
<p>passing that the affidavit was a gross misstaternent.
</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Brady did not do these things ignorantly. He did them
</p>
<p>after remonstrance in many cases. For instance, on the route from
</p>
<p>Pueblo to Eosita Mr. Brady was informed by a Mr. Magrue on the 30th
</p>
<p>of August, 1878, that a petition was being circulated for three trips;
</p>
<p>that the mail did not go over that Eosita route, and that it went by
</p>
<p>railroad. On the following 17th of March the postmaster at Green-
</p>
<p>4GB
</p>
<p>50
</p>
<p>wood, the only intermediate station, advised the discontinuance of the
</p>
<p>service on the route, on the ground that the mail could be carried
</p>
<p>quicker and better in another way. Yet, on the 8th of July, 1879,
</p>
<p>three months after the remonstrance of the postmaster, Mr. Brady,
</p>
<p>in disregard of this notice, and disregarding the suggestion that
</p>
<p>Ihe route be abandoned entirely, increased the trips from one to six
</p>
<p>times a week, and reduced the time from fifteen hours to ten hours,
</p>
<p>increasing the pay, which was originally $388, to $8,148. That is the
</p>
<p>route on which I told you that the subcontractor, by his contract on file,
</p>
<p>was to perform the service for $3,100, for which Mr. Brady, in spite of
</p>
<p>the remonstrance of the postmaster, had agreed to pay $8,148, and the
</p>
<p>isubcontractor had so good a thing of it that he let it out to somebody
</p>
<p>else for $2,600. Mr. Brady insisted on paying the contractors on tfyis
</p>
<p>Toute about $6,000 for doing nothing.
</p>
<p>On the 8th of May, 1880, the postmaster at Greenwood, by this time
</p>
<p>another man there had been a change in the office advised the dis-
</p>
<p>continuance of the service on that route, and stated that in so advising
</p>
<p>he had the concurrence of the postmasters at Eosita and at Pueblo,
</p>
<p>which offices were all the offices upon the line, and that the route be
</p>
<p>supplied in a different way. Mr. Brady not only paid no attention to
</p>
<p>that advice, but I think he went on and made a further increase upon
</p>
<p>the route.
</p>
<p>On route 38135, from Saint Charles to Greenhorn, the postmaster at
</p>
<p>Pueblo called attention to the fact that the route as advertised ended
</p>
<p>at a pump ; that there was no town and no reason for its ending where it
</p>
<p>did ; and that the proper terminus of the route should be Pueblo. Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady's attention was called to that fact before the contract was let ; was
</p>
<p>called to it by one of his own post-office inspectors. He went on and let
</p>
<p>the contract to Saint Charles, and then there was a temporary arrange-
</p>
<p>ment made by which they got the mail from Pueblo to Saint Charles.
</p>
<p>Then Mr. Brady extended the service to Pueblo ; but after he had extend-
</p>
<p>ed it the route w^s just as long as it was advertised at. He had not
</p>
<p>lengthened it a particle. The mistake had been made in the advertise-
</p>
<p>ment. By some mistake or other they had inserted Saint Charles when
</p>

</p>
<p>they should have inserted Pueblo, though they gave the correct distance
</p>
<p>to Pueblo. Yet Mr. Brady added twelve miles, I think it was an
</p>
<p>alleged twelve miles, a fictitious twelve miles to that route from Saint
</p>
<p>Charles to Pueblo, gave the contractor for carrying the mail an increased
</p>
<p>allowance on that twelve miles, made that increased allowance largely
</p>
<p>more than his own records showed the mail was being carried for over
</p>
<p>those twelve miles under a temporary service. And then having done
</p>
<p>that, and having got his route well extended to Pueblo and got it in
</p>
<p>good shape for expedition, he made an order for expedition and gave to
</p>
<p>the contractor a large sum of money for making expedition, and then
</p>
<p>arranged a schedule by which the mails arrived at Pueblo (Pueblo being
</p>
<p>a large railroad station) just after the trains left, and they laid over
</p>
<p>there a good many more hours than he had saved time by his pretended
</p>
<p>expedition.
</p>
<p>On the route from Ojo Galiente to Parrott City I have already called
</p>
<p>your attention to the fact that Mr. Brady insisted upon having a sched-
</p>
<p>ule of impossible time when his postmasters told him it could not be
</p>
<p>done in that time. He insisted upon having it done.
</p>
<p>On the route from Eawlins to White River, in Wyoming, the post-
</p>
<p>master at White Eiver, on the 22d of January, 1879, wrote to him saying
</p>
<p>that the time of five days ought to be made 66 hours in winter and 56
</p>
<p>hours in summer. Yet on the 1st of May, 1879, four or five months after-
</p>
<p>51
</p>
<p>-wards, Mr. Brady, in the face of the recommendation of the postmaster
</p>
<p>-at the principal office, reduced the time to 45 hours, less than two days,
</p>
<p>though the postmaster had written him that the existing time ought to
</p>
<p>foe lengthened to six days in winter and five days, in summer.
</p>
<p>On the route from Verinillion to Sioux Falls this thing occurred.
</p>
<p>The route had been let as fifty miles long when, in fact, it was seventy-
</p>
<p>five miles long. That was a mistake. The original schedule was four-
</p>
<p>teen hours. Mr. Brady reduced it to ten hours and allowed $3,680 in
</p>
<p>-consequence of the reduction. That made ten hours in which to go
</p>
<p>seventy-five miles, and there being ten post-offices on the route, and
</p>
<p>each postmaster being entitled to detain the carrier seven minutes, the
</p>
<p>result was that they were obliged to make seventy-five miles in less
</p>
<p>than nine hours, which is pretty good time as we should all think. On
</p>
<p>the 15th of December, 1879, every postmaster on the route advised
</p>
<p>that the time should be extended to sixteen hours. They sent that pe-
</p>
<p>tition to Judge Bennett, the representative of the Territory in Congress,
</p>
<p>the man who stood in the position which it will be urged to you was all-
</p>
<p>powerful with Brady a Congressman or a Senator 5 and it will be
</p>
<p>claimed that their recommendation was conclusive. Judge Bennett
</p>
<p>sent that remonstrance of the postmasters, requesting that it be made
</p>
<p>sixteen hours, to the Post-Office Department, and Mr. Brady indorsed
</p>
<p>upon it in his own handwriting
</p>
<p>" WRITE JUDGE B. IT CANNOT BE DONE."
</p>
<p>That was the sole answer he gave to the representations of the people
</p>
<p>out there
</p>
<p>" WRITE JUDGE B. IT CANNOT BE DONE."
</p>
<p>Except that he added
</p>
<p>"It would be unjust to the other bidders."
</p>
<p>What that injustice might be I cannot understand. That it would
</p>
<p>be unjust to anybody I cannot see, unless there might have been a little
</p>
<p>injustice in taking from the contractors an increased sum which they
</p>
<p>were receiving for expedition when they had already expended a large
</p>
<p>portion of that sum in paying the necessary expenses in the Post-Office
</p>
<p>Department for getting the expedition. There might have been in a

</p>
<p>certain sense a little injustice there, but it was not an injustice which
</p>
<p>concerned the public.
</p>
<p>On the route from Toquerville to Adairville, in Utah, the original
</p>
<p>schedule of sixty hours was, by an order made the 8th of July, reduced
</p>
<p>to thirty-three hours. All the petitions asked for forty-eight hours.
</p>
<p>No one of them asked for thirty-three hours. There is no evidence of
</p>
<p>thirty-three hours being desired by anybody, except in the affidavit of
</p>
<p>the contractor. There is not a syllable in any petition asking for thirty-
</p>
<p>three hours. The postmaster at one of the chief towns on the route, on
</p>
<p>the 21st of December, 1879, advised a return to sixty hours, and in the
</p>
<p>following March all the postmasters on the route advised a return to
</p>
<p>sixty hours, and Mr. Brady paid no attention whatever to it, but con-
</p>
<p>tinued on with this service not desired by the people in the locality.
</p>
<p>That, gentlemen, by the way, was the route on which, as I told you, he
</p>
<p>insisted upon making his order for expedition just before he made his
</p>
<p>order cutting off ten miles from the end of the route in order to give the
</p>
<p>contractor the extra sum.
</p>
<p>There are other cases. I think I have already referred to a case
</p>
<p>where in spite of the law, which says that no order for increased serv-
</p>
<p>ice shall be antedated so as to take effect before it is made, Mr. Brady,
</p>
<p>in direct opposition to that, made an order which was antedated and
</p>
<p>took large sums of money from the Treasury. Moreover, the petitions
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>asked for an increase of service or expedition only upon a portion of
</p>
<p>that route, and they denned that portion. The petitions asked for an
</p>
<p>increase on a portion of the route, and they gave good reasons why
</p>
<p>they wanted it only on a portion. In the progress of time a railroad
</p>
<p>had been built, so that if they could have an increase over the portion
</p>
<p>of the route simply between the station of the railroad and a promi-
</p>
<p>nent place beyond they would save time and gain a good deal in the
</p>
<p>reception of their mail matter. The petitions asked only an increase
</p>
<p>on that portion of the route. Mr. Brady used those petitions as his
</p>
<p>alleged authority for ordering an increase on the whole route. He-
</p>
<p>ordered an increase on the whole route, I think, nearly two hundred
</p>
<p>miles long, when the petitions asked for an increase only upon about
</p>
<p>sixty or seventy miles.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen of the jury, all this class of frauds which I have
</p>
<p>stated to you we expect to prove, and prove by witnesses who will not
</p>
<p>and cannot be contradicted. We also propose to call your attention,
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the jury, to some facts in connection with those things-
</p>
<p>which will show to you that this business was a prearranged matter;
</p>
<p>that it was not an accidental thing. We shall show to you on route
</p>
<p>after route that when these parties went out onto the route at the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the service, they stated to parties with whom they were
</p>
<p>arranging for subcontracts, and so forth, that the trips would be in-
</p>
<p>creased, that the speed would be increased. They specified precisely
</p>
<p>what would be done. They told how many trips would be added.
</p>
<p>They told how much the speed would be increased, and they told within
</p>
<p>what time it would be increased, and the result showed that they told
</p>
<p>correctly. We shall show to you this : That affidavits for increase were
</p>
<p>made which referred to the precise time which was subsequently
</p>
<p>allowed by Mr. Brady's order, and those affida dts upon their face were
</p>
<p>sworn to months before there was ever a petition started or ever any
</p>
<p>suggestion made of an increase upon the route, when the idea of an in-
</p>
<p>crease rested only in the minds of these parties. They armed them-
</p>
<p>selves with affidavits, and in those affidavits they were able to fix the
</p>
<p>preciee time which, when petitions came to Brady subsequently, upon

</p>
<p>the alleged faith of which he acted, he ordered to be put into practice.
</p>
<p>Even when the petitions asked for thirty-six hours, the affidavit made
</p>
<p>beforehand, dated beforehand, asked for twenty-six hours, they were
</p>
<p>able then, way back before this thing had been stirred, in some way or
</p>
<p>other to say, that Mr. Brady would like to know how many men and
</p>
<p>horses would be necessary to carry the mail in twenty-six hours, and
</p>
<p>they made their affidavits stating how many would be necessary to make
</p>
<p>that time. We shall ask you, gentlemen, from that condition of things
</p>
<p>and some others of that sort to draw the inference, from which there
</p>
<p>does not seem to be any escape, that this whole matter was prearranged.
</p>
<p>We shall show to you, gentlemen of the jury, that on many of these
</p>
<p>routes they paid at the outset more than they got from the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and we do not suppose it will be claimed that these defendants
</p>
<p>were such patriotic citizens, that the humble mechanic from Ver-
</p>
<p>mont came down here and went into the mail service for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of paying out to some subcontractor more money than he got
</p>
<p>from the Government, and that he did it for the purpose of relieving
</p>
<p>the Government from the burdens under which it was laboring. W T e
</p>
<p>shall show to you, for instance, that on the route from Pueblo to
</p>
<p>Eosita they got only $388. They originally made a contract with the
</p>
<p>subcontractor by which they were compelled to pay him $700 for car-
</p>
<p>rying the mail, and yet they were rewarded for their bread cast upon
</p>
<p>53
</p>
<p>the waters. For Mr. Brady promptly came to their assistance and car'
</p>
<p>:ried the original sum of $388 up to $8,148, and thus transformed a
</p>
<p>losing contract into one which was largely profitable. On the route
</p>
<p>from Silverton to Parrott City we shall show to you that Mr. John W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey received from the United States for carrying the mail $1,488;
</p>
<p>that he made a contract by which he agreed to pay $2,280 to somebody
</p>
<p>-else for doing that thing for him, and that he was therefore losing
</p>
<p>money at a pretty fair rate for a man not a very heavy capitalist ; but
</p>
<p>he got himself even very soon, for Mr. Brady proceeded to run up his
</p>
<p>$1,488 to $14,870.01. And you will bear in mind that in no case does it
</p>
<p>appear, I think, that a subcontractor performing the service ever got
</p>
<p>more than about 65 per cent, of the increased sum allowed for expedi-
</p>
<p>tion. So that this increase which Mr. Brady made, carrying it up from
</p>
<p>$1,488 to $14,870.01, redounded largely to the benefit of the contractor,
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey. There is the route from Eugene City to Bridge Creek, in
</p>
<p>Oregon. Mr. Peck, Mr. Dorsey *s brother-in-law, was the contractor
</p>
<p>there. He was not quite so liberal. He got from the Government
</p>
<p>$2,468, and he agreed to pay $2,700 for carrying the mail, and was
</p>
<p>therefore at a loss of about $250. But Mr. Brady promptly came to
</p>
<p>his assistance and carried up the sum which the Government paid to
</p>
<p>Peck from $2,468 to $21,460.89. The route from Mineral Park to Pioche
</p>
<p>was let at $2,982. John W. Dorsey went out there and made an
</p>
<p>arrangement by which he agreed to pay $4,700 for doing what the
</p>
<p>Government paid him only $2,982 for doing. But he made at the same
</p>
<p>time a contract with the subcontractor by which, on an increase,
</p>
<p>the subcontractor who was to do all the service was to get $12,600,
</p>
<p>but Mr. Dorsey was to get on the increase $9,700 net. The subcon-
</p>
<p>tractor was to pay all the flues and deductions, and Mr. Dorsey was to
</p>
<p>get $9,700 net, and after he got away from Wyoming, I think it was, he
</p>
<p>wrote a letter to his subcontractor in which, in goiug over the terms,
</p>
<p>he told him what a good thing he would have on an increase, and said
</p>
<p>to him that it was " the most liberal trade that he had made with any
</p>
<p>subcontractor since he left home." A trade by which he got $9,700 net for
</p>
<p>doing nothing, where the contractor was to get $12,600 for carrying

</p>
<p>the mails, and a trade on a route where at the time the contractor was
</p>
<p>being paid $4,700 and Mr. Dorsey was getting from the Government
</p>
<p>only $2,900. On the route from Kawlius to White River the contractor
</p>
<p>fot from the Government $ 1,700. He arranged to pay the subcontractor
</p>
<p>2,500 a net loss of $800, but he promptly covered himself, for he got
</p>
<p>from Mr. Brady orders for expedition and increase under which he, the
</p>
<p>contractor, got $8,600 for doing nothing, and the subcontractor $5,100
</p>
<p>for doing the service; and by and by there came a further increase, so
</p>
<p>that the Government was paying for a service which started at $1,700 a
</p>
<p>year no less than $31,981.25 a year. I shall ask you to infer, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>that these contractors did not go into this business of carry ing these mails
</p>
<p>with the intention of being at a loss, and that they had some under-
</p>
<p>standing or arrangement by which they knew that after they got the
</p>
<p>contracts well made, in some cases before the service was commenced,
</p>
<p>they could get an expedition or an increase of service which would run
</p>
<p>up the sums coming to them largely, and it would convert what was
</p>
<p>a small, losing contract into a large, profitable one.
</p>
<p>On the route from Bismarck to Fort Keogh, as showing the absolute
</p>
<p>ecessity of belief that they had some prearraugement, we shall show
</p>
<p>ou this condition of things: Mr. Miner's contract gave him from the
</p>
<p>Government for the aggregate of the four years during which the con-
</p>
<p>tract was to continue, $9,500. To perform the service on the original
</p>
<p>54
</p>
<p>schedule time there had to be stations built for changing horses and
</p>
<p>stabling horses once in thirty-five miles. The route was 301 miles long.
</p>
<p>They set to work and at the very outset made a contract with a man,
</p>
<p>whom we shall place before you, under which they arranged to have
</p>
<p>stations for changing horses every seventeen miles. They built their
</p>
<p>stations there, and when asked why they did it, said that when they
</p>
<p>came to increase the service they should have to change horses every
</p>
<p>seventeen miles, and that they were going to have an increase of service
</p>
<p>and wanted to arrange for it ; and they built those stations at every^
</p>
<p>seventeen miles. When the service first commenced they used only
</p>
<p>every other station. In building stations, and for things other than the
</p>
<p>horses used on the route, they spent $6,000, though the aggregate
</p>
<p>amount that they were to receive under the contract in the whole four-
</p>
<p>years was only $9,500, and this was a trackless prairie. They spent
</p>
<p>$6,000 for building their stations, but their faith was rewarded, for their
</p>
<p>$2,350 was shortly carried up by Brady to $70,000. That route, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, is the route upon which they proposed to the contractor, Mr. Pen-
</p>
<p>nell, to get up this bogus petition to be signed by his party of people..
</p>
<p>I have a memorandum here of something else in connection with that
</p>
<p>route, to which I desire to call your attention.
</p>
<p>On that route John W. Dorsey, the same man who made those incon-
</p>
<p>sistent oaths sworn to on the same day, to which I have already called
</p>
<p>your attention, went out there and got the route in operation when the
</p>
<p>pay was only $2,350. John E. Miner was the contractor. John W_
</p>
<p>Dorsey went out there to set the route in operation. M. C. Rerdell, an-
</p>
<p>other of the defendants, went with him or joined him there. He wanted
</p>
<p>Mr. Pennell, the contractor, whom we shall place before you, to become
</p>
<p>a partner on that route and to take a half interest in it. Early in
</p>
<p>July, 1878, he made him that proposition, and he told Mr. Pennell
</p>
<p>that there would be an increase of not less than $25,000; that
</p>
<p>he had a brother in Washington who would help it through; that
</p>
<p>there would surely be two increases inside of a year; that the
</p>
<p>second increase would be to six or seven trips a week, and that the
</p>
<p>time would be reduced to sixty-five hours. That conversation, gentle-

</p>
<p>men, occurred early in July, 1878, and on the 4th of October, 1878, there-
</p>
<p>was an increase of trips, and the time was reduced to precisely the time
</p>
<p>that John W. Dorsey said it would be sixty-five hours and there
</p>
<p>was allowed for that $27,950. He told Pennell that there would be an
</p>
<p>increase of at least $25,000. Brady saw it, and went him $3,000 better.
</p>
<p>He wanted Pennell to go into partnership with him, furnish the money r
</p>
<p>and run the route, and he mentioned as the reason why he should da
</p>
<p>so that there would be this increase, and that what would be obviously
</p>
<p>a losing route would become a paying route. Mr. Pennell did not be-
</p>
<p>lieve this condition of things, or if he did believe it he did not want to*
</p>
<p>have anything to do with a matter which on its face seemed of such
</p>
<p>doubtful propriety, and he did not go into it. He was told there would
</p>
<p>be two orders in the year and $25,000 increase. One of the orders was
</p>
<p>made on the 24th of October, 1878, within three months after, making
</p>
<p>the increase to two trips, and reducing it to the precise time to which
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey said it would be reduced. But Mr. Dorsey did not quite
</p>
<p>come to time on his second order. He was going to have his two orders
</p>
<p>within a year. The conversation occurred early in July, 1878, and it
</p>
<p>was not until the 2d of August, 1879, that Mr. Dorsey came round with
</p>
<p>his second order. But he got these two orders ; he got just the increase
</p>
<p>that he said he was going to get, and he got them from Mr. Brady.
</p>
<p>That conversation occurred in July, 1878, at the very time when John
</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>W. Dorsey and M. C. Rerdell were out there making arrangements for
</p>
<p>putting on the service. Mr. Miner was, by his agents here, putting into
</p>
<p>the Post-Office Department affidavits to show that there was no ground
</p>
<p>for any mail service at all upon that route; that there were no post-
</p>
<p>offices, no inhabitants except the Indians, and that no mail could be
</p>
<p>run over that route unless every carrier was accompanied by a company
</p>
<p>of soldiers. That conversation occurred out there with John W. Dorsey
</p>
<p>at about the same time that Miner at this end of the route was making
</p>
<p>that kind of a statement. The fact is shown that they had taken that
</p>
<p>route at greatly less than it could be run. They had got to get rid of
</p>
<p>a loss in one way or the other. They could not get rid of it by get-
</p>
<p>ting it discontinued. They could then get Pennell or some man out
</p>
<p>there to be fool enough to go into it with them, or they could go in and
</p>
<p>get expedition ; and when they had to run the route, owing to the in-
</p>
<p>sistence and urgency of the Delegate from Dakota, there was no remedy
</p>
<p>for them to save themselves and to make their profits except by getting
</p>
<p>these two increases that Dorsey said they would get, and getting this
</p>
<p>reduction that Dorsey said he would have.
</p>
<p>At this point (1 o'clock p. m.) the court took a recess for half an hour
</p>
<p>AFTER RECESS.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Resuming.] I was calling your attention, gentlemen, at
</p>
<p>the adjournment, to some of the evidence which we should present to
</p>
<p>you, showing pre-arraugement in this matter, and I had called your at-
</p>
<p>tention to the circumstances connected with the route from Bismarck
</p>
<p>to Fort Keogh. I now pass for the moment to the route from Kearney
</p>
<p>to Kent. That is the route upon which the petition, altered to thirteen
</p>
<p>hours, was presented. But it is to another phase of it that I desire now
</p>
<p>to direct your attention. The earliest papers on that route that reached
</p>
<p>the department, looking either to increase of trips or increase of speed,
</p>
<p>reached there on the 30th of April, 1879. All the other papers in the
</p>
<p>case got there in May. As early as the first day of February, 1879,
</p>
<p>Mr. Peck, the contractor, out in New Mexico, had somehow or other
</p>
<p>found out that thirteen hours was to be the precise time to which the
</p>
<p>schedule was to be reduced, and he had made his affidavit of the num-

</p>
<p>ber of men and horses that would be required on a time of thirteen
</p>
<p>hours. In other words he knew, before any paper came to the depart-
</p>
<p>ment, and there never was any paper in the department relating to
</p>
<p>thirteen hours, except that altered petition, and that altered petition
</p>
<p>was not sent here until the 13th of April, 1879 and yet on the first
</p>
<p>day of February, 1879, in New Mexico, Mr. Peck knew that thirteen
</p>
<p>hours was the time that Mr. Brady was going to order.
</p>
<p>On route 44140 from Eugene City to Bridge Creek, the same Peck, on
</p>
<p>the 22d of January, 1879, made his oath referring to a schedule of fifty
</p>
<p>hours three times a week. He transmitted it in a proposal which re-
</p>
<p>ferred to a schedule of sixty hours. That paper did not get on file till
</p>
<p>into April, and in April for the first time did any paper looking to expe-
</p>
<p>dition appear on file. Those were papers asking for 100 hours ; no one of
</p>
<p>them referred to fifty or sixty hours ; and though Mr. Peck's oath, made
</p>
<p>on the 22d of January, speaks of fifty hours, and though fifty hours was
</p>
<p>the time fixed by Brady in his order dated the 22d of June, 1879, there
</p>
<p>was not a paper on file in the department, either before or after Mr.
</p>
<p>56
</p>
<p>Peck made his oath way back in January, which looked to any such
</p>
<p>period of time. But Mr. Brady made his order that fitted Peck's affidavit
</p>
<p>made in the preceding January.
</p>
<p>On the route from Toquerville to Adairville, Peck made his oath on
</p>
<p>the 22d of January, 1879, asking for seven trips and thirty-three hours.
</p>
<p>The petitions asking for expedition were not received until the 25th of
</p>
<p>June. The order was made on the 8th of July. The petitions asked
</p>
<p>for forty-eight hours, There is not a paper that asks for anything
</p>
<p>smaller than forty-eight hours. Mr. Peck's oath, made the 22d of Jan-
</p>
<p>uary, looked to thirty-three hours, and Mr. Brady's order, made on the
</p>
<p>8th of July, is an order for thirty-three hours.
</p>
<p>On route 38156, from Silverton to Parrott City, Mr. John W. Dorsey
</p>
<p>made his oath on the 21st of April, 1879. He transmitted it on the
</p>
<p>5th of May, 1879. It refers to a schedule of fifteen hours and seven
</p>
<p>trips. Of the papers on file, a letter dated April 24, three days after
</p>
<p>the date of Dorsey's oath, says, u a daily service and fast time." One
</p>
<p>of the 5th of May says, u daily service and faster time." One on the
</p>
<p>25th of April says, "three trips and faster time." One on the 26th of
</p>
<p>April says, " daily and faster time ; " there being, as you will perceive,
</p>
<p>in these papers no reference to any particular time. Three trips is men-
</p>
<p>tioned, but usually only " faster time" or "fast time." Dorsey, on the
</p>
<p>5th of May, 1879, made his affidavit for fifteen hours and seven trips.
</p>
<p>Dorsey having made his affidavit on the 5th of May, 1879, for fifteen
</p>
<p>hours, on the 12th of June, 1879, Brady makes his order for a fifteen-
</p>
<p>hour schedule, when there is not a paper on file that specifies fifteen
</p>
<p>hours in any manner. How did Dorsey happen to hit upon the figure
</p>
<p>of fifteen hours ? The then existing schedule was thirty-three hours.
</p>
<p>Brady reduced the thirty-seven hours to fifteen hours on the 12th of
</p>
<p>June, 1879, and that was the precise figure that John W. Dorsey had
</p>
<p>selected from the whole schedule of thirty -seven hours down, on the
</p>
<p>21st of April, 1879, as that to which the reduction was to be made.
</p>
<p>On route 44155, from Dalles to Baker City, Peck made the oath on
</p>
<p>the 15th of December, 1878, and specified seventy-two hours. The
</p>
<p>schedule then was 120 hours. The order was made on the 29th of

</p>
<p>October following, and was for seventy-two hours. The petitions
</p>
<p>naming that time are dated at the end of September. They did not
</p>
<p>reach the department until the 20th or 23d of October. On the 23d of
</p>
<p>October the order was made, and yet those petitions and the orders
</p>
<p>specified the precise time, seventy-two hours, which Mr. Peck had in
</p>
<p>his affidavit fixed way back in December, 1878, nearly ten months pre-
</p>
<p>viously.
</p>
<p>On route 38113, from Kawlins to White Kiver, Mr. M. C, Rerdell, one
</p>
<p>of these defendants, wrote on the 8th of February, 1881 :
</p>
<p>I can get the increase to six or seven trips if you will send me petitions so as to
</p>
<p>liave them here before the 4th of March.
</p>
<p>You will bear in mind that General Garfield was to come into office
</p>
<p>on the 4th of March, and Mr. Brady's tenure of office as Second Assist-
</p>
<p>ant Postmaster-General was not likely to be very permanent after that
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>I can get the increase to six or seven trips if you will send petitions so as to have
</p>
<p>them here before the 4th of Marcb.
</p>
<p>They did not get here quite on time. I shall show you how they were
</p>
<p>got up. They got here on the 5th of March, and on the 8th of March,
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady being still Second Assistant Postmaster-General, but Thomas
</p>
<p>L. James having become Postmaster-General, Mr. Brady made an
</p>
<p>57
</p>
<p>order for an increase to seven trips, precisely what Mr. Kerdell said
</p>
<p>he could get if he got the petitions. They were filed on the 5th, and,
</p>
<p>as I say, on the 8th Brady made the order. That order was entered
</p>
<p>upon the journal of the department as all proceedings of the depart-
</p>
<p>ment are. At the end of the day the journal is brought to the Post-
</p>
<p>master-General for signature. The last order of the day put on there
</p>
<p>was this order that Mr. Brady had made, that the trips should be in-
</p>
<p>creased to seven and a large allowance made for it. Mr. James saw it.
</p>
<p>He directed that that order should be revoked. The clerk to whom he
</p>
<p>gave the direction conveyed that information to Mr. Brady. Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>came to Mr. James and wanted 1o know if that was to be the policy of
</p>
<p>his administration of the Post-Office Department. Mr. James told him
</p>
<p>it was. Mr. Brady left. Mr. James supposed that that order had been
</p>
<p>revoked, and it was not until way down in August, afte'r Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>had been compelled to leave the Post-Office Department, that it was by
</p>
<p>accident discovered that Mr. Brady had left that order uurevoked, and
</p>
<p>that there had been drawn from the Treasury thousands of dollars on
</p>
<p>the basis of that order which Mr. Brady had thus made upon petitions
</p>
<p>which Mr. Eerdell said he must have here before Mr. James could be-
</p>
<p>come Postmaster-General, and which Mr. Brady had made, and which
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady had taken care not to revoke.
</p>
<p>On the route from Ojo Caliente in New Mexico to Animas City, just
</p>
<p>prior to the 30th of April, 1879, an order was made increasing the serv-
</p>
<p>ice to three trips. Mr. S. W. Dorsey on that day wrote to the contractor
</p>
<p>saying that he expected to get it made daily as early as July, giving a
</p>
<p>further increase of trips. He did not succeed quite in his anticipations,
</p>
<p>but in the following February he succeeded in getting it made daily;
</p>
<p>and in that same connection the firm of Miner, Peck & Co., composed
</p>
<p>of Mr. Miner, Mr. Peck, and more or less of these other parties who
</p>
<p>were interested in the contract, wrote a letter, which we shall show to
</p>
<p>you, in which in a somewhat significant way they say they do not make
</p>
<p>any boast of "being solid" with anybody, but they can get what is
</p>
<p>reasonable. Mr. John W. Dorsey told one of the subcontractors out in
</p>
<p>Utah that he had influence in Washington by which they could get done

</p>
<p>what they wanted, and he specified various people, including some of
</p>
<p>these defendants.
</p>
<p>On route 38140, from Trinidad to Madison, the only paper on file,
</p>
<p>when Mr. Brady made his order for expedition, which asked anything,
</p>
<p>was a paper written by a gentleman in New York who had formerly
</p>
<p>been prominent in Colorado. It asked only for faster time and three
</p>
<p>times a week; but yet there was there the same foreknowledge of the
</p>
<p>contractor, because long before that time and before Brady made his
</p>
<p>order the contractor made an affidavit for precisely the same time that
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady subsequently ordered.
</p>
<p>Another class of evidence showing the understanding that must have
</p>
<p>existed we will show to you in the form of subcontract which they had
</p>
<p>printed. These defendants had printed a form of subcontract which
</p>
<p>was the first of that form that people concerned in the post office busi-
</p>
<p>ness and of large experience in post-office business had ever seen. They
</p>
<p>put into it an express provision providing for cases of expedition and
</p>
<p>increase of service that might subsequently be made. They arranged
</p>
<p>with the subcontractor to carry the mail tor so much. They put into
</p>
<p>their contracts a provision as to how much he was to have for increased
</p>
<p>service and how much he was to have for increased speed. So far, I
</p>
<p>think, as relates to increased service that clause in the subcontract was
</p>
<p>not unusual. So far as it relates to a provision for expedition that
</p>
<p>58
</p>
<p>clause was unusual, never having been known by any of the people con-
</p>
<p>cerned in the post-office business. And you will see that that must Ijave
</p>
<p>been the case when I remind you that during nearly five years of the
</p>
<p>postal service preceding Mr. Brady's entrance upon the business there
</p>
<p>never had been, all told, over twenty cases of expedition, and therefore
</p>
<p>it was not likely that there should be put into any printed form of sub-
</p>
<p>contract any provision upon the subject. But when, on the 1st of July r
</p>
<p>1878, these parties took these contracts and set about carrying out
</p>
<p>their scheme the first thing they did was to prepare and print a sub-
</p>
<p>contract which contains this provision as to future expedition.
</p>
<p>Now, as to another feature of this thing. These parties bid expressly
</p>
<p>as we say, with reference to routes which could be expedited. They
</p>
<p>bid upon routes which were advertised at a low rate of speed, so that
</p>
<p>there was room for expedition. They bid upon routes with only a small
</p>
<p>number of trips a week, so that there was room for an increase of trips ^
</p>
<p>and then having got contracts on such bids as those, they went in and
</p>
<p>got the expedition and the increase of trips. Leaving out, for the mo-
</p>
<p>ment, the matter of their bids, and taking only the contracts which
</p>
<p>they got, of 134 routes upon which they got contracts, 98 were route*
</p>
<p>upon which the service advertised for was only one trip a week; 24
</p>
<p>were routes upon which contracts were advertised for at two trips, and
</p>
<p>12 were contracts at three trips per week. They obtained 134 con-
</p>
<p>tracts, and on these 134 contracts their trips were increased, or speed
</p>
<p>was increased, in 68 different cases. Upon 29 of the routes it is true
</p>
<p>that at some period of time there were slight reductions made by cutting
</p>
<p>off some portion of the route; but while the aggregate increase on the
</p>
<p>68 routes amounted to $750,000 on a bidding of $41,000, the aggregate
</p>
<p>decrease amounted only to $2,452. That took place upon 29 routes, and
</p>
<p>upon those 29 routes, while there was a decrease in that amount of
</p>
<p>$2,452, there was either preceding it or succeeding it an increase of a
</p>
<p>good deal more than the decrease. The result is that on 20 of their
</p>
<p>contracts which remained diminished in a sum amounting in the aggre-
</p>
<p>gate to less than $20,000, it was a diminution simply by cutting off some
</p>
<p>portion of the route usually, because railroads had come in and put an

</p>
<p>end to star service. But they gained on 69 routes $750,000. I have
</p>
<p>stated, now, what the condition of things was as to the routes which
</p>
<p>were awarded to them. In their bidding they bid on 281 routes where
</p>
<p>the service was once a week; on 159 routes where the service was twice
</p>
<p>a week; on 121 routes on which the service was three times a week; on
</p>
<p>22 on which it was six times a week, and 1 on which it was seven times
</p>
<p>a week. They did not get any of the service upon the routes where the
</p>
<p>trips were frequent, undoubtedly, because upon those routes where
</p>
<p>there was no room for increase of trips or expedition they bid higher
</p>
<p>than other bidders. On the routes which they did get they got them
</p>
<p>because they were the lowest bidders, and they bid lowest, as we shall
</p>
<p>ask you to believe from the evidence, because they had a prearrange-
</p>
<p>ment, an understanding, by which their low bids were to be run up to a
</p>
<p>profitable sum.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady made, or there were made and I think in this statement
</p>
<p>all of them were made by Mr. Brady, but it is possible that in that
</p>
<p>respect some of them were made by his chief clerk as applicable to
</p>
<p>their 134 contracts during the year 1878 alone (the contracts did not
</p>
<p>take effect until the 1st of July, 1878), 66 separate orders increasing the
</p>
<p>pay of these defendants. In the year 1879 there were made 72 more
</p>
<p>orders increasing the pay of these defendants. Those are the two first
</p>
<p>years, or the first year and a half, of their contracts.
</p>
<p>59
</p>
<p>There are, gentlemen, one or two other things to which I may as well
</p>
<p>call your attention before I pass from this branch of the case, as indi-
</p>
<p>cating acts of these defendants showing that they were engaged in
</p>
<p>some disreputable proceedings in connection with the department.
</p>
<p>On route 44160, from Canyon City to Fort McDermott : On the 15th
</p>
<p>of April, 1881, John E. Miner, one of these defendants, wrote a letter,
</p>
<p>which letter was upon the paper of u The Northern Overland Mail
</p>
<p>Company," or something of that sort, which described another of these
</p>
<p>defendants, Mr. Vaile, as the^president, and Mr. Miner as its secretary f
</p>
<p>which letter, in substance, says that "he finds out by accident that one
</p>
<p>S. H. Abbott, " who was postmaster at a little place on that route called
</p>
<p>Alvord," has written to the department that you do not pay your bills,
</p>
<p>and that there is no use of having a weekly mail." Now that was on,
</p>
<p>the route where they ran it up from one trip a week at $2,888, and it
</p>
<p>went to six trips a week at $50,166, and here was this postmaster writ-
</p>
<p>ing that there was no necessity for anything more than a mail once a
</p>
<p>week. That letter, Miner says, was sent by the postmaster at Alvord to
</p>
<p>the department. Miner knew of that letter. That letter has disappeared
</p>
<p>from the files of the department. There is no evidence in the depart-
</p>
<p>ment that the letter ever was there. Our only knowledge of it is from,
</p>
<p>the letter of Miner, which we shall put before you. What does Mr.
</p>
<p>Miner say f " I want to have you see this man and pay him. Give him
</p>
<p>what is necessary to shut his mouth. We do not want him to write any
</p>
<p>more such letters to the department. We have got $50,000 on a route
</p>
<p>which we bid for at $2,800, and we don't want any postmaster oat there
</p>
<p>writing that it is not necessary. It is an inconvenient document to
</p>
<p>have on the files of the department. Somebody may find it." This is
</p>
<p>the substance of the letter. I cannot read the letter at this stage.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. Do you pretend to say that is the substance of the
</p>
<p>letter?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I pretend to say that is the purport of the letter. I will
</p>
<p>read the letter if you have no objection to my reading it.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. I have no objection to that.

</p>
<p>I wish you would see this man at once, and satisfy him. Pay him whatever is rea-
</p>
<p>sonable, and report to R. C. Williamson at The Dalles.
</p>
<p>E. C. Williamson was the superintendent of Vaile, Miner & Company.
</p>
<p>I suppose that is what he is after. He knows nothing of the through mail
</p>
<p>Of course he did rot know anything about that. The evidence was
</p>
<p>that only ten or twelve pounds went over that route, and there was no
</p>
<p>through mail.
</p>
<p>and probably a weekly is all he needs; but more likely he wants some money. He
</p>
<p>complained once before to the department that he had to make a special trip to Camp
</p>
<p>McDermott to make his returns.
</p>
<p>They did not perform the service, and in order to make his quarterly
</p>
<p>returns to the department, which he ought to have been able to put in
</p>
<p>the mail at his own office and send to the department, he had to make
</p>
<p>a journey to Fort McDermott to get his own ofiicial letter in the mail.
</p>
<p>He complained once before to the department that he had to make a special trip
</p>
<p>to Camp McDermott to make his returns, and I sent him $30, and it was all right.
</p>
<p>Now I suppose he wants a little more money.
</p>
<p>Here was this postmaster writing that a weekly mail was all that was
</p>
<p>needed. What harm was he doing to them? Why was it necessary to
</p>
<p>do anything with him to make it "all right," if it was not the desire to
</p>
<p>60
</p>
<p>shut up his mouth f That was all there was to it and all there could
</p>
<p>be to it.
</p>
<p>But that transaction does not stand alone, gentlemen. There was a
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson, who was a subcontractor out in Utah. We shall place
</p>
<p>him before you, and you will believe every word that he says. He car-
</p>
<p>ries honesty and truth upon his face. There had been a change made
</p>
<p>on a route, running the speed up beyond what the people in the locality
</p>
<p>and Mr. Johnson, the subcontractor, thou^dat was necessary. He wrote
</p>
<p>to the department complaining, and thereirpon one of these defendants
</p>
<p>wrote him that they had concluded voluntarily to increase his pay some-
</p>
<p>thing like $2,000 a year, but that they wanted him to stop writing to
</p>
<p>the department; that he had been complaining to the department about
</p>
<p>the matter, and that they wanted him to stop, and wanted him also to
</p>
<p>write to his Delegate in Congress and beg the Delegate to withdraw cer-
</p>
<p>tain papers he had placed on file. They wrote two letters to Mr. John-
</p>
<p>son to that effect. Mr. Johnson got his $2,000, and somehow or other
</p>
<p>those papers, which it appears of record the Delegate had placed upon
</p>
<p>the files of the department, have disappeared from those files.
</p>
<p>This being the condition of things, what do we find in another point
</p>
<p>of view! I desire now to refer to a subject which I have already
</p>
<p>touched upon to some extent. It may be supposed, or it may be
</p>
<p>claimed, perhaps, that although Brady made these excessive allow-
</p>
<p>ances to which I have called your attention, yet the money was appro-
</p>
<p>priated to carry the mail, and that it was paid for carrying the mail,
</p>
<p>and so there ought not to be any particular objection to it. We
</p>
<p>shall show you upon the Kearney and Kent route that while the con-
</p>
<p>tractor got $2,715.08 for sitting in Washington and doing nothing, the
</p>
<p>subcontractor, who did the service, got only $1,587.40; that on the
</p>
<p>Pueblo and Eosita route the contractor who sat still in Washington got
</p>
<p>$5,048, the subcontractor got $3,100, and he had so good a thing of it
</p>
<p>that he got somebody else to carry the mail at $2,000. You will bear
</p>
<p>in mind in all cases that the contractor here in Washington got his
</p>
<p>money net and clear, and that it was the subcontractor who had to pay
</p>
<p>all fines and deductions, and that the sole interest of these contractors

</p>
<p>here in Washington, so far as the question of fines and deductions is
</p>
<p>concerned, was that the fines and deductions should not be so great as
</p>
<p>to more than exhaust the money that went to the subcontractor. We
</p>
<p>shall show you in one case a feeling remonstrance from Mr. S. W. Dor
</p>
<p>sey to a subcontractor that if he did not look out he would subject him-
</p>
<p>self to so many fines that he would not only lose all his money, but
</p>
<p>actually affect the money coming to the contractors here in Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, and that would be an outrage that ought not to be endured for a
</p>
<p>moment!
</p>
<p>On the route from Saint Charles to Greenhorn, Mr. John K. Miner, as
</p>
<p>contractor here in Washington, got $3,945.60. He made a contract
</p>
<p>with a Mr. Farrish to carry the mail for $840. When Mr. Farrish gave
</p>
<p>it up he made another contract with Mr. McDaniel to carry it for $900,
</p>
<p>and he performed all the service for $900, and Miner got $3,045 net.
</p>
<p>On the Toquerville and Adairville route which, by the way, is the
</p>
<p>route as to which Mr. John W. Dorsey writing to the subcontractor
</p>
<p>with reference to the arrangement he had made with him, told him
</p>
<p>that that was nearer pro rata than any trade he had made since he
</p>
<p>left Washington the contractor got $12,450.22 for doing nothing, and
</p>
<p>the subcontractor who did the work got only $8,444. On route 38140,
</p>
<p>from Trinidad to Madison, the contractor got $2,402.25 for doing noth-
</p>
<p>ing, and the subcontractor got $1,550 for carrying the mail not out of
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>the $2,400. You will bear in mind that the sums received by the con-
</p>
<p>tractors are over and above what they paid to the subcontractors.
</p>
<p>On route 38156, from Silverton to Parrott City, the subcontractor who
</p>
<p>did the work got $9,400, and the contractor here in 'Washington got
</p>
<p>$7,112.20. On route 38145, from Garland to Parrott City, at one time
</p>
<p>the contractor got $5,438.08, and the subcontractor who did the work got
</p>
<p>$8,000. At another time the subcontractor got only $6,200. Subse-
</p>
<p>quently the contractor got $7,244.08 net, and was kind enough to allow
</p>
<p>the subcontractor $10,666.f 4. In that case the whole record is set out in
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady's order. It is there recited that the United States Govern-
</p>
<p>ment ought to pay a certain additional amount for carrying the mail, and
</p>
<p>then he followed it up, as he had to follow it up for the subcontract
</p>
<p>was on file by saying he would pay only about one-half of the amount to
</p>
<p>the man who actually carried the mail. The balance, he said, was nec-
</p>
<p>essary for payment to a man who sat here in Washington and did not
</p>
<p>do anything for this was the effect of his declaration.
</p>
<p>On the route from Eawlings to White Elver, No. 38113, the con-
</p>
<p>tractor at one time got $13,706.25 net, and the subcontractor, who did
</p>
<p>the work, got only $5,100. The contractor got an excess of $8,606.25
</p>
<p>for doing nothing. At a later stage the subcontractor got $10,000 out
</p>
<p>of $13,706.25, and he will tell you that that $10,000 paid him handsomely
</p>
<p>for carrying the mail. At a later stage, on the same route, $31,981.25
</p>
<p>was paid by the Government, of which the subcontractor got $22,333.37,
</p>
<p>and the contractor, who did nothing, $8,647.92. Mr. Eerdell, in commu-
</p>
<p>nicating to that subcontractor the fact that he was to be allowed
</p>
<p>$23,333, while the defendants kept $8,600 additional, wound up his letter
</p>
<p>by a suggestion that the subcontractor had got a good thing, and he
</p>
<p>wanted him to understand that he, Eerdell, had obtained it for him, and
</p>
<p>insinuated that if anybody was to be compensated, he wanted the sub-
</p>
<p>contractor to remember that the credit was due to him. Mr. Eerdell
</p>
<p>carefully avoided saying anything about the fact that he and the other
</p>
<p>people whom he represented here in Washington were making out of
</p>
<p>the contract $8,647.92. On the route from The Dalles to Baker City
</p>
<p>the contractor at one time got $21,460, and the subcontractor- got $7,400,

</p>
<p>leaving the contractor an excess of $14,060. On route 44160 the sub-
</p>
<p>contractors got $10,000, and the contractor got $40,166.66. The subcon-
</p>
<p>tractors got $10,000, to be divided between two, or $5,000 apiece. Yaile,
</p>
<p>who was the contractor, got $50,166.66, giving them $10,000. Where
</p>
<p>did the odd $40,000 go? On the route from Eeddiug to Alturas, the
</p>
<p>contractor got $17,964, and the subcontractor $10,500 of that. I think
</p>
<p>that was clone-under an order not signed by Mr. Brady, but signed by
</p>
<p>his chief clerk.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, what was the result to the Government and to these
</p>
<p>defendants of all this series of orders made by Brady for their benefit ?
</p>
<p>There were, at the end of 1880, 9,225 star routes in the country. They
</p>
<p>had an aggregate length of 215,480 miles. They cost $6,401,000.84 to
</p>
<p>the Government annually. This was the service upon which Brady
</p>
<p>operated with his orders for increase of trips and increase of speed.
</p>
<p>From January 1st, 1872, to June 30, 1875, under Eoutt, as Second As-
</p>
<p>sistant Postmaster-General, three years and six mouths, I have already
</p>
<p>called your attention to the fact that there were only fifteen orders for
</p>
<p>expedition. The amount allowed under those fifteen orders was
</p>
<p>$144,729.83. Under Tyner, in a year from June 30, 1875, to June
</p>
<p>30, 1876 there were five orders for expedition, and an aggregate
</p>
<p>allowance of $12,620.60. Brady came into office on the 23d of July,
</p>
<p>1876, and down to the year ending June 30, 1877, twenty-three days
</p>
<p>62
</p>
<p>less than a year, he made thirteen orders for expedition, covering
</p>
<p>$158,418.59, being nearly $15,000 more than Routt had ordered in his
</p>
<p>entire three years and a half. For the year ending June 30, 1878,
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady's second year, he ordered expedition to the extent of only
</p>
<p>$27,923. For the year ending June 30, 1879, Mr. Brady had seventy
</p>
<p>cases of expedition, and made orders which took from the Treasury an-
</p>
<p>nually $905,912.91, and those orders were made with reference to routes
</p>
<p>as to which the existing pay before he commenced to operate upon them
</p>
<p>was only $588,150.13. In other words, to $588,000 he added over
</p>
<p>$900,000. For the year ending June 30, 1880, Mr. Brady made twenty-
</p>
<p>five orders for expedition, and by those orders he added to the money
</p>
<p>taken from the Treasury of the United States $307,426.84 a year, and
</p>
<p>added it upon routes upon which the existing pay was only $107,974.22
</p>
<p>to April 30, 1881. The balance of the year before he went out, being
</p>
<p>two months less than a year, he made nine orders for expedition, which
</p>
<p>cover only $13,749.46. You will perceive, gentlemen, that by that time
</p>
<p>the material upon which orders for expedition could fairly operate was
</p>
<p>pretty well worked out. The contracts in the Pacific section and it is
</p>
<p>in that section I ought to say that all the orders for expedition were
</p>
<p>made, except a single one on a route in North Carolina had been ex-
</p>
<p>hausted by the prior orders for expedition. The routes were let in July,
</p>
<p>1878, and the contracts were to expire in June, 1882, and there was very
</p>
<p>little room for further expedition. So we find that when Mr. Brady's
</p>
<p>career was cut off on the 30th of April, 1881, he had only been able in
</p>
<p>the last ten months to make nine cases of expedition, and those for the
</p>
<p>trivial sum, according to his idea, of $13,749.46. Brady, in four years
</p>
<p>nine months and seven days, made one hundred and twenty orders of
</p>
<p>expedition, by which he added to contracts made after public bidding,
</p>
<p>which called for $907,780.45, the sum of $2,321,211.25. By public bid-
</p>
<p>ding, bidders said they would carry the mail over those routes for
</p>
<p>$907,780.45, and Mr. Brady, by secret arrangements made in his office,
</p>
<p>gave to those bidders $2,321,211.25 in one year.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. May it please your honor, I desire to inquire whether
</p>
<p>it is proper, in the opening statement of this case to the jury, to make

</p>
<p>statements with reference to matters that are in no way whatever con-
</p>
<p>nected with this indictment, not mentioned in the indictment, and not
</p>
<p>competent as evidence on the trial of this case. I make the inquiry at
</p>
<p>this stage of the case in order that there may be no misapprehension as
</p>
<p>to the character of the opening that may be made on behalf of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants. I do not want to have it transpire in this case, as it did in
</p>
<p>the other trial, that when the defense come to state the facts, and come
</p>
<p>to point out to the jury the misrepresentation of the facts, that we shall
</p>
<p>be interrupted by anybody by saying, in the way of objection, that we
</p>
<p>are stating matters not pertinent to the case. I make the point right
</p>
<p>here, if your honor please, because the counsel for the Government is
</p>
<p>now stating to this jury matters that are absolutely disconnected with
</p>
<p>this case, matters which have not the slightest relation to this case, and
</p>
<p>as to every one of which, if they were before the court, we would have
</p>
<p>an opportunity to make answer. Mr. Bliss is going wholly outside of
</p>
<p>this indictment, and stating that which I say, on my own responsibility,
</p>
<p>is a misrepresentation of the truth of this matter. I want now not to
</p>
<p>stop him, but I do not want the court to stop us when our time comes
</p>
<p>to tell this jury the truth about this case. Now the court, thus having
</p>
<p>had its attention called to the matter-
</p>
<p>The COURT. [Interposing.] What particular part of the opening of
</p>
<p>Mr. Bliss do you object to?
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Your honor will bear in mind that Mr. Wilson did this
</p>
<p>precise thing on the previous trial in almost the same language at this
</p>
<p>point in my opening.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. I have the floor for the present. Mr. Bliss is stating as
</p>
<p>to expeditions and increases of service that were made during the
</p>
<p>administration of the office of Second Assistant Postmaster-General,
</p>
<p>by General Brady, with reference to routes that are in no way con-
</p>
<p>nected with this transaction. Now if they are in issue in this case let
</p>
<p>Mm go on ; but do not stop us when we come to reply to them. And if
</p>
<p>your honor please, if it comes to that, we shall claim the right in the
</p>
<p>progress of this case to take up every one of these routes that was ex-
</p>
<p>pedited or increased during the time that General Brady was in office,
</p>
<p>and we shall claim the right to show to this court and to this jury that
</p>
<p>in not a single one of them did he ever make an increase or an expedi-
</p>
<p>tion that was not clamored for by the best men in this country. Now, if
</p>
<p>it is proper to state this to the jury, it is proper to answer it. If it is
</p>
<p>proper to state it to the jury, it is proper for them to prove it. If it is
</p>
<p>proper for them to prove it, it is proper for us to meet it with counter-
</p>
<p>proof. If it has no relation to the case, so be it. I am not asking to have
</p>
<p>it stopped, but I do want to notify the court that if he goes into this
</p>
<p>thing we shall claim the right to meet it if it takes until the 1st of Jan-
</p>
<p>uary a year hence.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Then I do not understand you to object.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. I am simply giving the court notice that he is going be-
</p>
<p>yond the case and has been doing so, as my associate says, for some
</p>
<p>time. I have not been here. I happened to come in just now and heard
</p>
<p>him stating these things to the jury, which are as foreign to this case as
</p>
<p>the south to the north pole.
</p>
<p>The COURT. I accept your notice.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. Very well ; that is enough.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Your honor, I presume it is necessary that this trial should *
</p>
<p>proceed in the same way that the other did.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. No, sir.
</p>
<p>The COURT. I do not mean to adopt that rule.

</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I simply want to say that at just about this stage in my
</p>
<p>opening before, Mr. Wilson gave, nominally for the benefit of the court,
</p>
<p>but really for the benefit of .the jury, precisely the same notice. We
</p>
<p>will accept it and I will proceed.
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. If your honor please, I do formally object to any state-
</p>
<p>ment of expedition on any route not mentioned in this indictment. Mr.
</p>
<p>Bliss is going over what he calls a hundred and twenty expeditions and
</p>
<p>increases of service. There are only nineteen mentioned in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, and I now formally object to his saying anything
</p>
<p>The COURT. [Interrupting.] I do not understand him to be going over
</p>
<p>them seriatim.
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. But he is charging official perfidy and corruption
</p>
<p>concerning the whole hundred and twenty. They are brought in here
</p>
<p>for some purpose. They arc either to be investigated, or they are
</p>
<p>brought here to prejudice the minds of the jury touching the nineteen
</p>
<p>at issue. Is that the proper way ! Has he a right to undertake to bring
</p>
<p>matters in for this purpose if he does not expect to offer any proof about
</p>
<p>them?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I do expect to offer proof about them.
</p>
<p>Mr. CHANDLER. About routes not mentioned in the indictment?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. If you will allow me, I will state that I expect to offer
</p>
<p>proof to this extent : It may be claimed that Mr. Brady, in making these
</p>
<p>64
</p>
<p>orders for expedition, simply followed the current practice of the de-
</p>
<p>partment and went on in that way. I propose to ask the court to let
</p>
<p>me show this jury that Mr. Brady was not following the practice of the
</p>
<p>department, but was introducing a new and exceptional system.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. If your honor please, I want to say a word in reply to
</p>
<p>that. Mr. Bliss has been talking to this jury about all these expeditions.
</p>
<p>If the court permits this to go on, I shall claim the right, in behalf of
</p>
<p>the defendants, not only to talk of it to the jury but to prove the fact.
</p>
<p>I shall claim the right to prove that one of these very routes that he is
</p>
<p>talking about here; the largest, not only in this country, but in the
</p>
<p>world ; a route fifteen hundred miles long, was expedited by the Post-
</p>
<p>master-General himself, over the opposition of General Brady. I shall
</p>
<p>claim the right not only to state to the jury, but to prove, that what
</p>
<p>General Brady did was done after consultation with the Postmaster-
</p>
<p>General
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Interposing.] I submit, your honor, that that is not proper.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. I beg your pardon. I have the floor.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I have a right to object.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Yes.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I submit that it is not proper for Mr. Wilson, in making
</p>
<p>an objection, to interject a speech of this kind.
</p>
<p>The COURT. [To Mr. Wilson.] I think you and Colonel Bliss are about
</p>
<p>square now. You have given notice.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. That is what I think.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. But, your honor
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Interposing.] Your honor, Mr. Wilson wants to make an
</p>
<p>argument in my place.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. I do not want to do so.
</p>
<p>The COURT. In making an objection you have no right to make an
</p>
<p>argument against his opening. You may object to any particular part
</p>
<p>of his opening, and the court will rule upon the objection. Unless there
</p>
<p>is a specific objection, however, the court will take no notice of it. I
</p>
<p>understood you as merely giving notice that you would claim the same
</p>
<p>extent of privilege that he has claimed.

</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. Yes, but
</p>
<p>The COURT. [Interposing.] And that you waive all objection to the
</p>
<p>character of the opening now being made.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. But if your honor will pardon me
</p>
<p>The COURT. [Interposing.] I cannot permit an argument here.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. I will not make one, your honor.
</p>
<p>The COURT. You may make a specific objection if you choose to do
</p>
<p>so.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. 1 will simply say this : that after I had given this notice
</p>
<p>Colonel Bliss stated to the court, as I understood it, that he would offer
</p>
<p>to prove these things in a general way.
</p>
<p>The COURT. If you make that formal objection to his opening I shall
</p>
<p>sustain it. But there is a class of evidence in regard to crime that par-
</p>
<p>takes of a fraudulent character which, although not particularly pointed
</p>
<p>to in the indictment, is yet admissible to show the corrupt purposes of
</p>
<p>the defendant. And this evidence may relate to other acts of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants than those specified in the indictment. There is a class of
</p>
<p>evidence of that kind, and I understood the opening of Mr. Bliss so far
</p>
<p>to refer to cases of that kind. Now, whether the court will admit evi-
</p>
<p>dence of that kind when it comes to be offered, the court does not wish
</p>
<p>to prejudge and will not prejudge. But counsel have their own theory
</p>
<p>65
</p>
<p>in regard to their case, and they have a right to present it to the jury
</p>
<p>and state the evidence upon which they expect to sustain it.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. I quite agree with the court
</p>
<p>The COURT. [Interposing.] The court cannot permit the discussion of
</p>
<p>the admissibility of evidence to take place on an interruption of an
</p>
<p>opening.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. I agree with your honor entirely that this is not *he
</p>
<p>time to settle what is competent or what is incompetent evidence. But
</p>
<p>there is another class of evidence that is likewise admissible, if your
</p>
<p>honor please, and that is evidence to show the motive of the party who
</p>
<p>is accused, as in this case. That evidence would be such evidence as
</p>
<p>would show tbat the head of the department was
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Interposing.] I object, your honor, to the introduction
</p>
<p>here of an argument in that direction.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Very well. You can go on, Mr. Bliss, in your own way.
</p>
<p>I cannot pass upon the question of the admissibility of the evidence at
</p>
<p>this point.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. So that he can go on without restriction and the same
</p>
<p>privilege is accorded to us.
</p>
<p>The COURT. I do not say without restriction at all.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. I simply wish to ask the court's ruling. I object to
</p>
<p>anything in the opening as to any route not mentioned in the indictment.
</p>
<p>The COURT. I shall overrule that objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. I understood your honor to say at the former inter-
</p>
<p>ruption of my colleague, that the theory entertained by the counsel may
</p>
<p>be presented without reference to any rulings made by the court at the
</p>
<p>former trial.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Why, certainty ; and if the court should be convinced
</p>
<p>in the course of this trial that there were any errors committed on the
</p>
<p>former trial one way or the other it is not going to be bound by the rules
</p>
<p>laid down in the other case from any sense of pride.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. Then, in our theory of the case we may be permitted to
</p>
<p>state outside without regard to any ruling of the court in the former
</p>
<p>trial.

</p>
<p>The COURT. I have repeatedly said that. I do not wish to be restricted
</p>
<p>at all to the rulings made on the former trial.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. With reference to these constant references to the former
</p>
<p>trial I respectfully submit that they are all improper and that there are
</p>
<p>cases where what has been done on a former trial being referred to was
</p>
<p>held to vitiate what is done at the next one ; we have refrained carefully
</p>
<p>from stating anything as to the former trial. A reference. to that has
</p>
<p>not passed my lips, I think, in this case.
</p>
<p>The COURT. 1 understand the reference to the rulings made on the
</p>
<p>former trial to be made merely to the rulings of the court, and for the
</p>
<p>purpose of ascertaining the ruling of the court upon the rulings in point;
</p>
<p>and in answer to that I am prepared to follow the lights I may have in
</p>
<p>this case. The court cannot forget the rulings in the former case; but
</p>
<p>it will not follow those rulings, simply because they are rulings, or have
</p>
<p>been rulings, but will follow them if they are deemed in this case to be
</p>
<p>proper, and will not follow them if it thinks they ought not to be fol-
</p>
<p>lowed.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Eesuming.] Taking, gentlemen, the star service west of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi River, Mr. Brady came into office on the 23d of July,
</p>
<p>1876. On the 1st of July, 1878, after he had been nearly two years in
</p>
<p>office and I start from that period simply because it happens to be a
</p>
<p>little more convenient for me in getting the figures, and the defendants
</p>
<p>5GB
</p>
<p>66
</p>
<p>then began these contracts after he had during those two years prior
</p>
<p>to July, 1878, added about $800,000 to the expense of the* star-route
</p>
<p>service west of the Mississippi, either by increase of trips or by expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, the aggregate cost of that star-route service west of the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>on the 1st of July, 1878, was about $2,000,000. On tbe 1st of July, 1879,
</p>
<p>under Mr. Brady, that cost had been increased to $3,706,977. To an
</p>
<p>aggregate cost of two millions he had in the brief period of a year added
</p>
<p>$1,700,000 ; and the preceding Congress having appropriated every dol-
</p>
<p>lar that was asked for in the estimates of the Post-Office Department,
</p>
<p>which estimates were made by Mr. Brady, having however cut down
</p>
<p>all other appropriations, but made all the appropriations that Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>asked for, for the star service, Mr. Brady was compelled to go to Con-
</p>
<p>gress and ask Congress to make an additional appropriation of $2,000,000
</p>
<p>to meet the deficiency over and above his own estimates, which he had
</p>
<p>created by his career of extravagance and corruption during that brief
</p>
<p>year. He got from Congress $1,250,000, and it may in the course of
</p>
<p>this trial incidentally come in play to show 3^011 some features of the
</p>
<p>manner in which he got it.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAViDGrE. Well, now, I do not like to interrupt the opening of
</p>
<p>counsel, but is there any human being on earth who will pretend that
</p>
<p>a statement of that sort is pertinent ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. What do you mean ; about Congress ?
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGKE. I mean the remark that you may have occasion to
</p>
<p>point out some of the means whereby he obtained an appropriation of
</p>
<p>Congress. Now, is not that a plain, patent abuse ?
</p>
<p>The COURT. I do not know. I cannot tell what he is going to say.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Let me remind your honor that on the last trial a wit-
</p>
<p>ness on the stand
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. [Interposing.] I thought you had not referred to that
</p>
<p>trial.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I have not previously ; I said I had not. There was a
</p>
<p>witness who referred to a conversation with Mr. Brady, which your
</p>
<p>honor directly ruled in as applicable to this case. That was what I
</p>
<p>meant might come in play.

</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGKE. I want to say a very words, your honor, and I think
</p>
<p>you will concur with rne. I know that astute and adroit men can do a
</p>
<p>great many things under the guise of opening a case which ought not
</p>
<p>to be done. I know that the subject is one of extreme delicacy on the
</p>
<p>part of the court, as you have intimated to-day. It is not for you to
</p>
<p>say what theory may be entertained in respect of any trial over which
</p>
<p>you may preside, and hence a very wide range must in the nature of
</p>
<p>things be allowed to counsel. Now, personally, I have no particular ob-
</p>
<p>jection to the ruling, if it may be so called, that fell from your honor a
</p>
<p>little while ago. All that we ask is that you will pay especial attention
</p>
<p>to the range of the opening on the part of the Government, and to the
</p>
<p>fact that repeatedly, a score of times, this opening has been devoted
</p>
<p>not to the statement of what the Government expects to prove at all,
</p>
<p>but to an argument upon what it is anticipated will be proved on that
</p>
<p>side and any defense that is anticipated on the other side. In other
</p>
<p>words, it is obnoxious and objectionable, both as to its range and as to
</p>
<p>its being argumentative. All that I have to say therefore is that I ask
</p>
<p>that your honor's attention be directed to the wide range in respect of
</p>
<p>what the Government undertakes to prove and in respect of the argu-
</p>
<p>ment, and that you will allow the same liberality to the counsel for the
</p>
<p>defense, as 1 feel sure you will do and must do.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Oh, well, the court cannot make any promises.
</p>
<p>67
</p>
<p>Mr. DAViDGrE. I do not want any promise except the promise that is
</p>
<p>implied from the fact that your honor is listening to the character of the
</p>
<p>opening on the part of the Government.
</p>
<p>The COURT. I am listening. ' ,
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGKE. It very often happens, as your honor is aware, that
</p>
<p>the opening is left exclusively to the counsel, and the judge afterwards
</p>
<p>says that if his attention had been drawn to it he would have stopped
</p>
<p>the counsel. We at least ask the attention of your honor to the point
</p>
<p>and to appreciate its character.
</p>
<p>The COURT. I am listening.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. One of their difficulties in this case is that other people
</p>
<p>than counsel are listening.
</p>
<p>[Resuming.] On the 1st of January, 1880, the aggregate cost of the
</p>
<p>star service of the country was $7,264,832. Mr. Brady ceased to be Sec-
</p>
<p>ond Assistant Postmaster-General on the 30th of April, 1881. On the
</p>
<p>30th of June, 1882, the cost of that service had been reduced to
</p>
<p>$5,553,849. On the 1st of July there came the new letting of that
</p>
<p>service which had expired on the 30th of June, 1882, being the Pacific
</p>
<p>section upon which it had chiefly operated, and then the service was
</p>
<p>still further reduced to $4.486,755, a service which under Brady had
</p>
<p>cost $7,104,832 was reduced on the 1st of July to $4,486,75 ~>. One mill-
</p>
<p>ion seven hundred and seventy- eight thousand dollars was saved
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. One moment. I want to interrupt you. I wish now
</p>
<p>to understand whether or not it is proper in this case to institute a
</p>
<p>comparison between one contract term and another contract term.
</p>
<p>That is to say, I wish to know whether it is proper for counsel to be
</p>
<p>stating to the jury a matter of that sort when the star routes are con-
</p>
<p>tinually changing, when hundreds and hundreds of miles of service are
</p>
<p>taken out of the star service and become railroad service ? Therefore,
</p>
<p>as between one contract term and another contract term, there can be
</p>
<p>no possible similarity. I wish to know whether that is a proper mat-
</p>
<p>ter to be stated to the jury. If the court thinks it is, all right. And I
</p>
<p>wish to know, in addition to that, whether or not it is proper to com-
</p>
<p>pare the expenses of routes, because if it is, then we want to have the

</p>
<p>privilege of stating to the jury the exact facts in regard to these cases.
</p>
<p>Now, if it is proper to go into this wide range and to cover the whole
</p>
<p>country we want to know it. If the court says that I may go on
</p>
<p>The COURT. [Interposing.] Do you make an objection ?
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. I renew the objection made by Mr. Chandler that the
</p>
<p>counsel is not confining himself to the case that is made by this indict-
</p>
<p>ment. I make the objection because he is making a statement that
</p>
<p>can have no other effect or purpose than to mislead this jury. 1 make
</p>
<p>that objection now, if your honor please, so that when we < ome to re-
</p>
<p>ply to that there may be no objection to the reply. And I make it, if
</p>
<p>your honor please, for this reason : That while I was following right in.
</p>
<p>the track of this same gentleman at the last term of the court I was re-
</p>
<p>peatedly interrupted because I was not keeping myself within the limits
</p>
<p>of the case. Now, I do not propose hereafter that that kind of objec-
</p>
<p>tion shall be urged against my associate who will open this case, so far
</p>
<p>as General Brady is concerned, without having laid the necessary founda-
</p>
<p>tion for overturning that objection when it is made.
</p>
<p>The COURT. The court ovei rules your objection, but at the same time
</p>
<p>does not declare its opinion in regard to the competency of the evidence,
</p>
<p>for the simple reason that that is a question which the court \\ill de-
</p>
<p>termine in its proper place. The Government thinks that that kind of
</p>
<p>evidence to which counsel is engaged in referring is competent to sus-
</p>
<p>68
</p>
<p>tain the issue on its behalf, the court an an objection to that kind of
</p>
<p>evidence made in the opening will not rule on the question of evidence
</p>
<p>at all, but will allow the counsel to open in his own way.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. That ruling is for both sides'?
</p>
<p>The COURT. I would have no objection to answering that question
</p>
<p>anywhere but here, but here I reserve the decision of all questions un-
</p>
<p>til the proper time comes.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. Now, I entirely agree with the court, but
</p>
<p>The COURT. [Interposing.] If you agree with the court let us have
</p>
<p>no argument about it.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. Just one word, I beg your honor : If this were a case
</p>
<p>of larceny and the defendants were accused of stealing a horse and the
</p>
<p>prosecuting attorney should get up here and talk about stealing a
</p>
<p>steamship or committing piracy upon the high seas, you would not
</p>
<p>hesitate for a moment to stop him ?
</p>
<p>The COURT. I cannot answer that. I am not going to answer ques-
</p>
<p>tions, except when they arise.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. I know your honor will give us just as wide range as
</p>
<p>you give them.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Your honor, if I considered it consistent with my own
</p>
<p>self-respect to make personal charges of misrepresentation as broadly
</p>
<p>as the counsel does, I should claim to refer your honor to the record of
</p>
<p>the last trial as showing that the gentleman misstates what occurred
</p>
<p>when he was opening.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. Well, I should refer to the record to show that I have
</p>
<p>not misstated it.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I have been reading it, sir. I have read it at recess, and
</p>
<p>I have read it since I sat here.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Go on in your own way, and unless you commit some
</p>
<p>very great
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Interposing.] I will do so. I certainty shall do nothing
</p>
<p>that I do not think proper. I am going to meet squarely the objection
</p>
<p>of Mr. Wilson about the railway service. He argued it on the last
</p>
<p>trial. I propose to show the condition of things.

</p>
<p>Now, I stated that the expense of the star service had been reduced
</p>
<p>from $7,260,832 to $4,486,755. One million seven hundred and seventy-
</p>
<p>eight thousand dollars of that saving was made by revoking the extrav-
</p>
<p>agant orders of Thomas J. Brady and his chief clerk. The cost per mile
</p>
<p>of the star service on the 1st of January, 1881, under Thomas J. Brady
</p>
<p>was $ i 6.99. The cost on the 1st of July, 1882, after Brady went out of
</p>
<p>office, was $8.62 per mile. The star-route service west of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>River cost on the 1st of January, 1881, $2,844.165. On the 1st of Jan-
</p>
<p>uary, 1882, it cost only $1,125,419. Between June 30, 1881, and July
</p>
<p>1, 1882, there was a reduction of $2,001,189 of the cost, being 79J per
</p>
<p>cent. The cost per mile was reduced until to-day it is but $7.82 per
</p>
<p>mile against $16.99 under Mr. Brady.
</p>
<p>On the 1st of July, 1882, new contracts went into operation in all the
</p>
<p>Pacific section. Under those contracts, gentlemen of the jury, the en-
</p>
<p>tire Territory of Dakota, with all its increased service, is supplied with
</p>
<p>the mails for $9,500 only in excess of the amount which Brady gave to
</p>
<p>a single route in that Territory. The entire Territory of Wyoming is
</p>
<p>supplied with mails at one-half the amount of money which Brady
</p>
<p>wasted upon a single route in that Territory.
</p>
<p>It is claimed here you have just heard it claimed that a saving in
</p>
<p>the star-route service was made because the railroads had come in and
</p>
<p>taken up the star-route service and rendered that service unnecessary.
</p>
<p>69
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, ill the Pacific section, west of the Mississippi, and ex-
</p>
<p>cluding the States of Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, and Minnesota there
</p>
<p>has been saved on the star routes $1,991,000. There has been added to
</p>
<p>the railway service in that region, even including the four omitted
</p>
<p>States, only $294,513, and yet you are asked to believe that the
</p>
<p>reduction of the star-route service since Mr. Brady went out of office
</p>
<p>has been accomplished not by legitimate economy, but by transferring
</p>
<p>the expense from the star-route service to the railroad service. There
</p>
<p>has been $1,990,000 saved in the Pacific section. There has been an
</p>
<p>addition to the railway mail- service of only $294,513 in the Pacific
</p>
<p>section.
</p>
<p>Under the new contracts, which took effect Julyl, 1882, I propose to
</p>
<p>give you a few figures, confining them to cases where the number of
</p>
<p>trips per week is the same, where the distance is the same, and where
</p>
<p>the number of hours is the same, and let us see what Mr. Brady paid,
</p>
<p>and what is paid under open competition.
</p>
<p>On one route he paid $28,600. They now pay $11,700. On another
</p>
<p>route he paid $34,200. They now pay $8,900. On another route he
</p>
<p>paid $5,707. They now pay $2,283. On another route he paid $5,824.
</p>
<p>They now pay $1,790. On another route he paid $16,770.16. They
</p>
<p>now pay $5,620. On another route he paid $17,569.89. They now pay
</p>
<p>$8,900. On another route he paid $11,752.85. They now pay $4,630.
</p>
<p>On another route Brady paid $5,280. They now pay $2,620. On an-
</p>
<p>other route, the J ulian to Colton route referred to in this indictment,
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady carried the amount up to $8,910. That is the route, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, on which, if I recollect aright, he made the increase for twenty-
</p>
<p>six hours when they only asked for thirty-six. I think that is the route.
</p>
<p>At any rate he paid $8,910. The route is now run in the same time,,
</p>
<p>the same number of trips, and in every way the same for $3,488. I am
</p>
<p>wrong. On that route the time is a little longer. The time under Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady was twenty-six hours. The time now is thirty hours. On all the
</p>
<p>other routes that I have read to you, the time, the number of trips and
</p>
<p>everything is the same, differing only in the amount taken from the
</p>
<p>Treasury. On another route Mr. Brady paid $19,359.99. Public com-

</p>
<p>petition gets it done for the Government for $8,700. On another route
</p>
<p>Brady paid $36,284.33. Public competition gets it done for $21,000.
</p>
<p>On the route from Eawlius to Meeker, under the old contract as in-
</p>
<p>creased by Brady, the amount was $31,981.25. On that route, as the
</p>
<p>amount was reduced after Mr. Brady went out of office by his suc-
</p>
<p>cessor, the sum allowed was $5,100. On public competition the con-
</p>
<p>tract was awarded at $7,320, being $2,400 less than Mr. Brady paid,
</p>
<p>but $2,100 more than was allowed b}~ his successor. On the route from
</p>
<p>Pueblo to Greenhorn Mr. Brady paid $3,945. His successor cut it down
</p>
<p>to $1,315.20. There is now paid, after public competition, $960. In
</p>
<p>these cases, gentlemen, there has been acliarfge in time or trips, or both.
</p>
<p>On the route from Trinidad to Madison Mr. Brady paid $4,290. It was
</p>
<p>reduced by his successor to $1,014, and on public competition it was let
</p>
<p>at $960. On the route from Saguache to Barnum Mr. Brady paid
</p>
<p>$7,166.40. It was reduced by his successor to $1,454.55. Public competi-
</p>
<p>tion got it done for $920. On the route from Gardner to Kosita Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady paid $3,926.67. His successor reduced it to $1,916.33, and public
</p>
<p>competition got it at $1,468.
</p>
<p>I could go on and give you more of those routes; but the general re-
</p>
<p>sult is this, gentlemen, and, I think, we shall show it to you beyond all
</p>
<p>question, that the extravagant amounts that Mr. Brady allowed having
</p>
<p>been reduced by his successor to the point which he thought was fair
</p>
<p>70
</p>
<p>and reasonable,- when they came afterwards to be submitted to public
</p>
<p>bidding, the routes were let at somewhere near about 18 per cent, less
</p>
<p>than the amount to which Mr. Brady's successor reduced it, and they
</p>
<p>were let at not over one-sixth of the amount Brady paid.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. Were they new contracts'?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. They were new contracts made alter public advertisement,
</p>
<p>to take effect after the 1st of July, 1882.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. I did not hear you state that. ,
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I did state it.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. Do you mean to say they were for the same service?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I stated expressly that as to these routes I last mentioned
</p>
<p>there was a difference in time and in trips. But I was about to go on
</p>
<p>to say as an additional fact that while there had been the reduction of
</p>
<p>time and trips on various of these routes you will search the Post-Office
</p>
<p>records in vain to find half a dozen complaints coming from the localities
</p>
<p>affected. The present service is entirely adequate.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. Who is at the head of the present service "I
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Richard A. Elmer, who was put there by Thomas L. James,
</p>
<p>and was there during all these reductions after Mr. Brady was requested
</p>
<p>to resign.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. Well, you have made a very good defense for him.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Precisely.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. Has anybody ever charged him with anything ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I do not know whether they have or not. With the ability
</p>
<p>which counsel have to throw out insinuations against everybody 1 do
</p>
<p>not know but what they have done it against him.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDG?E. You need not defend him until w r e attack him.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I have not defended him. You are mistaken if you sup-
</p>
<p>pose it to be a defense of him. It is a showing up of your client,
</p>
<p>Thomas J. Brady.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. By contracts made four years afterwards.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. If you choose to say so.
</p>
<p>Now, thirteen of these routes in the indictment, which, under Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady, had been carried up to $219,886.46 a year were reduced under

</p>
<p>the administration of Mr. James and Mr. Elmer to $32,603.88, and at
</p>
<p>the recent letting they were let at $31,012, being about $1,500 less than
</p>
<p>the amount to which Mr. James and Mr. Elmer reduced them, and be-
</p>
<p>ing about $180,000 less than the amount that Mr. Brady paid. He paid
</p>
<p>$218,000 for what at the public bidding was let at $31,'000.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. Was that the same service ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I have said distinctly it was not the same service. The
</p>
<p>routes were let for the number of trips and the rate of speed which the
</p>
<p>service called for, and that is all that ever should be done.
</p>
<p>On route No. 38156, from Silverton to Parrott City, the time, trips,
</p>
<p>and distance are identical. Mr. Brady paid $14,870.01, and at the
</p>
<p>recent letting it was let for $4,240. On ten routes, where, so far as I
</p>
<p>can ascertain, the service is substantially identical, Mr. Brady paid
</p>
<p>$174,369.31, and that service has recently been let at $73,880.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen of the jury, I think I have given you a sufficient
</p>
<p>dose of figures for the present. I desire to pause for a moment and
</p>
<p>survey the ground we have gone over. If we presented to you no other
</p>
<p>evidence than that to which I have now referred we should have shown
</p>
<p>to you that the practice of expedition was resorted to by Mr. Brady in
</p>
<p>excessive and unnecessary instances ; that he made allowances for ex-
</p>
<p>pedition and increase of pay to the very limit nominally allowed by the
</p>
<p>law when it was utterly unnecessary and unfair to do so ; that he al-
</p>
<p>71
</p>
<p>lowed expeditions solely on the statements of the parties to be affected
</p>
<p>by them, and that those parties were allowed practically to say how
</p>
<p>much they would take from the Treasury of the United States ; that he
</p>
<p>allowed expeditions upon affidavits where the records show there were
</p>
<p>contradicting affidavits by the same parties on file before him ; that he
</p>
<p>allowed them on affidavits which showed such absurd results as that
</p>
<p>they assume that one horse could only travel two miles a day ; that he
</p>
<p>allowed excessive sums even if he took the affidavits of the persons who
</p>
<p>made them; that he acted upon affidavits which were false; that he
</p>
<p>disregarded the law as to productiveness ; that he paid large sums of
</p>
<p>money for expedition where nothing was gained ; that he paid large sums
</p>
<p>for expedition and increase of trips where neither expedition nor in-
</p>
<p>crease of trips were needed ; that he ordered impossible expedition ; that
</p>
<p>he paid twice for the same service ; that he made petty orders, adding
</p>
<p>to the money to be taken from the treasury whenthefacts upon which they
</p>
<p>were alleged to be based were untrue, alleging that there was an addition
</p>
<p>of distance Avhen there was nothing of the kind, and similar cases ; that
</p>
<p>he neglected to declare these parties failing contractors, and granted
</p>
<p>them the liberty to continue, leaving the service to be provided lor by
</p>
<p>the Government in other ways until they got ready with their petitions
</p>
<p>and names for expedition, so as to make their losing contracts winning
</p>
<p>contracts ; that he acted upon false petitions, petitions which upon
</p>
<p>their face were false, and petitions which did not even answer his al-
</p>
<p>leged purpose of being a cover or protection for himself. We shall un-
</p>
<p>dertake, however, gentlemen, to show to you much more than this.
</p>
<p>We shall place before you a gentleman not a willing witness for the
</p>
<p>Government, but a witness whose testimony will have to be drawn from
</p>
<p>him, who will testify, we think, to substantially this condition of things :
</p>
<p>that he having made advances to parties concerned in the postal serv-
</p>
<p>ice, and those parties having failed to carry out their contracts, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of protecting himself and saving the advances which he had
</p>
<p>already made, became a contractor upon a route under an order made
</p>
<p>by Mr. Brady ; that that relation brought him into connection with Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady, and that thereupon Mr. Brady, at various times, received from hirn

</p>
<p>loans of money under such circumstances that his evidence in that respect
</p>
<p>can be entirely corroborated; that after a time this gentleman being sub-
</p>
<p>stantially broken up by his experience with the mail service, he called
</p>
<p>upon Mr. Brady for a settlement and a repayment of the money advanced,
</p>
<p>and that Mr. Brady refused to pay it, saying to him that that money was
</p>
<p>simply bribes which he had paid to him for favors which he alleged he
</p>
<p>had given him in connection with his mail service, and telling him also
</p>
<p>that he haddoneno more than all other con tractors did; that they all had
</p>
<p>to pay him ; that he did not suppose that the witness believed that he,
</p>
<p>Brady, made these orders for the fun of the thing; that he made them
</p>
<p>for the solid reason of getting an interest and percentage for making
</p>
<p>them, and that when this witness referred to his supposition that he
</p>
<p>made them on the basis of petitions which were filed, Mr. Brady scat-
</p>
<p>tered the idea to the winds, and told him he ought to know better than
</p>
<p>that. Said he, " You understand there were petitions filed in your be-
</p>
<p>half, but I did not pay any attention to them. They had no effect upon
</p>
<p>me. They were simply a cover giving me something to protect me in
</p>
<p>doing this thing." I have stated briefly the evidence of a witness who
</p>
<p>I feel confident will satisfy you that he 'is telling the truth. He can be
</p>
<p>supported in the statements by various corroborative evidence. He is
</p>
<p>not a swift witness in the service of the Government, but a man whom
</p>
<p>we can bring here under subp<ena, and who will tell the truth upon the
</p>
<p>72
</p>
<p>stand because it is his duty to tell the truth. And if his character is
</p>
<p>attacked, we shall be prepared to show that it is beyond successful at-
</p>
<p>tack.
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, we shall go further. We shall show" you that one
</p>
<p>of these defendants, Montfort C. Eerdell, in the spring of the year 1881,
</p>
<p>after Mr. Brady went out of office, and when this investigation in con-
</p>
<p>nection with the star-route service was first commenced, having been
</p>
<p>simply the clerk, the scribe, apparently with no direct pecuniary in-
</p>
<p>terest I think he had an interest as to some of the routes but at any
</p>
<p>rate being the humble servant and employe of these conspirators,
</p>
<p>found this investigation was getting near home, and said, " 1 propose
</p>
<p>to save myself, and I propose to save that one of the defendants,
</p>
<p>Stephen W. Dorsey, to whom I peisonally owe the most allegiance and
</p>
<p>for whom I have the most affection. He is the man w T ho brought me
</p>
<p>from Arkansas here and who jmtineinto one of the departments of the
</p>
<p>Government and who took me as his clerk to the Senate, who kept me
</p>
<p>in the position and who has paid me my salary. Now, I propose to
</p>
<p>make a clean breast of it and endeavor to save him and myself." In
</p>
<p>following out that theory he met, on the street, Ex-Gov. Powell Clay-
</p>
<p>ton, of Arkansas. I presume he sought him from the fact that he knew
</p>
<p>that Governor Clayton had access to the then officials of the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration, and he possibly might have been influenced by the fact that he
</p>
<p>knew Ex-Governor Clayton had in the past not been friendly to Mr.
</p>
<p>Dorsey. He told him he wanted to be brought into communication with
</p>
<p>the Postmaster-General. Clayton told him he would arrange for the
</p>
<p>meeting. He went to the Postmaster-General, and an arrangement was
</p>
<p>made by which there was a meeting at the rooms of the Postmaster-Gen-
</p>
<p>eral at the Arlington Hotel. Mr. Eerdell came there, and Mr. Eerdell
</p>
<p>then made a detailed statement of the facts which he stated existed within
</p>
<p>his own experience. Mr. James stated to him that he desired to have
</p>
<p>him see the Attorney-General. An, appointment was made for a fur-
</p>
<p>ther interview, and at that interview Mr. Eerdell renewed the state-
</p>
<p>ments that he had originally made. The first interview was held in
</p>
<p>the presence of Mr. James, Governor Clayton, and Mr. Woodward, an

</p>
<p>inspector of the Post-Office Department. It took place early in June of
</p>
<p>last year. Mr. Eerdell stated that he had been Stephen W. Dorsey's
</p>
<p>confidential clerk ; that he had attended to the business of all these
</p>
<p>contractors ; that it was perfectly well understood that they were di-
</p>
<p>viding their profits with Mr. Brady; that there was a regular schedule
</p>
<p>on which the division was made; that for increase of speed, which was
</p>
<p>the large allowance, there was paid to Mr. Brady by the contractors a
</p>
<p>percentage of either 33 or 40 per cent, of the amount; that in case Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady remitted fines imposed upon contractors for failure to perform
</p>
<p>service, he was to have 50 per cent, of the amount ; that at the time
</p>
<p>when Congress, in 1880, was investigating this business Congress went
</p>
<p>into an investigation when Mr. Brady made the request for the large
</p>
<p>extra appropriation it was believed that the books of Dorsey and
</p>
<p>Company would be called for, and that Mr. Eerdell would be the
</p>
<p>witness required to produce them ; that he therefore shammed sick-
</p>
<p>ness while time was given to prepare a bogus set of books ; that he did
</p>
<p>not prepare hose books, but he gave instructions as to how they should
</p>
<p>be prepared, marking the entries in the original books Avhich should
</p>
<p>be changed; that in the original books Mr. Brady appeared as Smith;
</p>
<p>and that a clerk in one of the departments appeared as Jones ; that
</p>
<p>when the new set of books were made those items that went in in that
</p>
<p>way were transferred to other accounts, mostly, I think, "to profit and
</p>
<p>73
</p>
<p>loss;" that be, Eerdell, had on one occasion gone with Mr. Stephen W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey to the bank, and that $7,000 had been drawn; that he had gone
</p>
<p>with Mr. Dorsey to the door, either of the Post-Office or of Mr. Brady's
</p>
<p>room at the Post-Office I will not undertake to say which Mr. Dorsey
</p>
<p>stating to him that he intended to pay that money to Mr. Brady, and
</p>
<p>that he, Dorsey, went in. Eerdell did not claim to have gone in and
</p>
<p>seen the money paid. He produced certain abstracts, which he said
</p>
<p>were abstracts from the books or the results of the accounts. He
</p>
<p>said that he went before the committee finally, but that they did not
</p>
<p>send for the books, and that therefore that labor was labor wasted;
</p>
<p>that he had been remonstrated with by the defendants after his exami
</p>
<p>nation by the committee, on the ground that he had told too much, and
</p>
<p>that he replied that he had told nothing he could help telling, and that
</p>
<p>his testimony was as guarded as it could be without incurring the dan-
</p>
<p>ger of instant exposure if they went to the records and discovered its
</p>
<p>error. There was a good deal more of the same nature. Mr. Eerdell then,
</p>
<p>desired to see Mr. MacVeagh, and an arrangement was made.to have him
</p>
<p>see Mr. MacVeagh on a subsequent evening. It was arranged that he
</p>
<p>should communicate with Mr. Woodward, the Post-Office inspector,
</p>
<p>under an assumed name. Mr. Woodward having ascertained as he be-
</p>
<p>lieved that Mr. MacVeagh would not be in town on the night fixed for
</p>
<p>Mr. Eerdell to go to his house sent Eerdell, through the post-office, a
</p>
<p>notice to that effect; but in order to make sure, Mr. Woodward went
</p>
<p>to the Attorney -General's house, and as he got to the steps he found
</p>
<p>Eerdell in front of him, having just rung the bell, and having with him
</p>
<p>certain books. On going in it appeared'Mr. MacVeagh had returned.
</p>
<p>Mr. Eerdell repeated substantially the statement which I have made to
</p>
<p>you. He said that these books which he produced were the letter-
</p>
<p>books of the concern, and contained some letters written by him and
</p>
<p>some written by Stephen W. Dorsey, and he showed to the gentlemen
</p>
<p>certain press copies of letters which were identical with letters which
</p>
<p>had been shortly beiore that discovered to have been sent to Oregon
</p>
<p>by S. W. Dorsey, and the originals of which were at that time accessi-
</p>
<p>ble. There were one or two other interviews upon that subject, and

</p>
<p>Mr. Eerdell said that the tell-tale books were in New York, and he
</p>
<p>would go there and get them, and would bring them, with other papers
</p>
<p>which he could find as confirmatory of his statement, and leave them
</p>
<p>with the Attorney-General. A few days afterwards Mr. James was on
</p>
<p>the cars going to New York, and he found Mr. Eerdell upon the same
</p>
<p>train. Mr. Eerdell told him he was going over to carry out his arrange-
</p>
<p>ment as to the production of the books. They arrived in New York early
</p>
<p>in the morning. That afternoon at 3.30 Mr. James left to come back,
</p>
<p>and to his surprise found Mr. Eerdell upon the train. Mr. Eerdell
</p>
<p>told him he did not want to have much conversation with him there,
</p>
<p>because there was upon the train somebody interested in the star-
</p>
<p>-route. business; but pointing to a bundle which he had, told him
</p>
<p>he had those books with him. When they got to either Trenton or
</p>
<p>Philadelphia the conductor came into the parlor car and called out the
</p>
<p>name of Mr. Eerdell, saying that he had two dispatches for him. Eer-
</p>
<p>dell took the dispatches and read them, and subsequently as Mr. James
</p>
<p>was passing showed him those dispatches, which were dispatches signed
</p>
<p>with the name of Stephen W. Dorsey. One of them expressed regret
</p>
<p>that they had parted in anger and begged him to come back, and the
</p>
<p>other beseeched him to pause in the course upon which he had entered
</p>
<p>as it would result in the ruin of Dorsey 's family. Mr. Eerdell came back
</p>
<p>to the city with the dispatches in his possession, stating that he was
</p>
<p>74
</p>
<p>determined to carry out his agreement with the Attorney -General.
</p>
<p>When he got here he fell into the hands of somebody, and from that
</p>
<p>time on he lost all desire to protect himself and to clear his conscience,
</p>
<p>but passed altogether under the influence of these defendants. Their
</p>
<p>ranks were closed up and he stands before you now as one of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants, whose testimony against himself will be accepted by the court
</p>
<p>and by you as absolutely conclusive, and whose testimony will throw a
</p>
<p>lurid light upon this conspiracy and the relations of the different parties
</p>
<p>to it.
</p>
<p>Your honor, I am about to begin upon new matter. Perhaps this is
</p>
<p>a good time to adjourn. I hoped to get through to-day, and should,
</p>
<p>I think, have been able to do so if it had not been for the interruptions.
</p>
<p>The COURT. Adjourn the court.
</p>
<p>At this point (3 o'clock and 55 minutes p. in.) the court adjourned
</p>
<p>until Monday morning next at 11 o'clock.
</p>
<p>MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 188-2.
</p>
<p>The court met at 11 o'clock.
</p>
<p>Present, counsel for the Government and for the defendants.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS resumed as follows :
</p>
<p>May it please the court and you, gentlemen of the jury, on looking
</p>
<p>over my memorandum I perceive that I stated somewhat inadequately
</p>
<p>the evidence which we propose to offer as to the conversation of the
</p>
<p>contractor Walsh with Mr. Brady, and it is perhaps right that I should
</p>
<p>amplify that a little. I stated that the contractor after having loaned
</p>
<p>&s he claimed money to Mr. Brady, and having come into a position
</p>
<p>where he desired his money returned, called upon Mr. Brady to re-
</p>
<p>turn it to him and made an appointment to meet him at a given place.
</p>
<p>They there met. That he called upon Mr. Brady to return him the
</p>
<p>money and gave him the amounts; that a discussion was opened as to
</p>
<p>the amount of interest that was to be paid, the question as to interest
</p>
<p>having been left unsettled, and that he was then inet by the statement
</p>
<p>of Mr. Brady that he, Brady, owed him nothing; that in fact the con-
</p>
<p>tractor, Walsh, rather owed him ; that Brady alleged that he had ben-
</p>
<p>efited him very largely ; that he had given him a remunerative con-

</p>
<p>tract, and that he did not think that he, Brady, was under any obliga-
</p>
<p>tion to Walsh, and that when asked for an explanation, Brady said he
</p>
<p>did not think any explanation was needed, that he thought Walsh knew
</p>
<p>enough, had seen enough to understand what the usual arrangements
</p>
<p>were. Walsh, professing ignorance, called for an explanation. Brady
</p>
<p>then recited that Walsh's route had been expedited, the service in-
</p>
<p>creased, and he must not suppose that he, Brady, did these things just
</p>
<p>for amusement. Whereupon Walsh replied that he thought or supposed
</p>
<p>he did it because of the petitions from people in the locality, &c., as to
</p>
<p>the needs of the service, to which Brady replied that petitions had noth-
</p>
<p>ng to do with it; that there was no use in arguing the matter, and
</p>
<p>that if he, Walsh, professed ignorance of what the real arrangements
</p>
<p>were that was mere affectation, and he then told him that as a rule 20
</p>
<p>per cent, per annum was paid to him, Brady, on the amount of all ex-
</p>
<p>peditious that he ordered ; and he then went into figures as to what
</p>
<p>would result to Walsh on the application of that to the contract which
</p>
<p>he had had. There was also a statement of some other sums, credits
</p>
<p>that Mr. Brady claimed he was entitled to ; and that brings me to a
</p>
<p>$ 75
</p>
<p>matter which I have not referred to heretofore, and that is the ques-
</p>
<p>tion of remissions of fines and penalties. It .is in the power of
</p>
<p>the Second Assistant Postmaster-General when any contractor has
</p>
<p>been fined for not performing the service at all, or not perform-
</p>
<p>ing it in the requisite time, for losing one trip or twenty trips,
</p>
<p>or being behind time on one trip or twenty trips, it is in the power and
</p>
<p>it is the duty of the Postmaster General to impose fines upon the party,
</p>
<p>that he shall not receive money for service which he has not performed.
</p>
<p>Those fines it is in the power of the Second Assistant Postmaster-
</p>
<p>General to remit, and to remit substantially at his own will, it being
</p>
<p>assumed under the law and the regulations of course that the Second
</p>
<p>Assistant Postmaster-General will be a man of honesty and discretion.
</p>
<p>In this discussion between Walsh and Brady there came up the ques-
</p>
<p>tion of remissions of fines and penalties, or fines and forfeitures as
</p>
<p>spoken of sometimes, which really are penalties, and Mr. Brady told
</p>
<p>Walsh that he, Brady, was entitled to and he always got 50 per cent, of
</p>
<p>all fines and penalties which he remitted. Mr. Brady told Mr. Walsh
</p>
<p>that these arrangements were the general arrangements made with all
</p>
<p>contractors for whom he made orders benefiting them by expedition of
</p>
<p>service, or increase of service, or the remission of their fines, and in-
</p>
<p>sisted that he, Walsh, must recognize that system which prevailed. Mr.
</p>
<p>Walsh declined to recognize that system which prevailed, and claimed
</p>
<p>that he was in entire ignorance of it.
</p>
<p>The money was undoubtedly paid by Walsh to Brady. There can be
</p>
<p>no question of that. We shall prove to you, beyond all question, by
</p>
<p>the account of the banker in New York to whom the payment was made,
</p>
<p>the payment made by Walsh to Brady on the precise day when Walsh
</p>
<p>says it was made, and that money that Brady had of Walsh Mr. Walsh
</p>
<p>says was money that he lent to him. Mr. Brady claims to retain it un-
</p>
<p>der some undefined condition other than that. I mean he claims it in
</p>
<p>court, but claims to Mr. Walsh, as Mr. Walsh states, that he had a
</p>
<p>right to retain it because it was the usual percentage which he received
</p>
<p>from everybody for whom he expedited or increased the service, and
</p>
<p>that on the figures made in detail Mr. Walsh still owed him some money

</p>
<p>instead of Mr. Brady owing Walsh for money loaned.
</p>
<p>I have spoken, gentJemen of the jury, thus far almost solely of Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady among these defendants. 1 have done that designedly, and,
</p>
<p>in a great measure, from the necessities of the case. Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>was the Second Assistant Postmaster-General. Dorsey might con-
</p>
<p>ceive the scheme. He might bring into it his brother, his brother-
</p>
<p>in-law, his business associate ; he might do all these things, and,
</p>
<p>unless there was some arrangement by which orders were to be got
</p>
<p>from Mr. Brady which would put money into the pocket of the con-
</p>
<p>tractors represented by Dorsey and his associates, money in excess of
</p>
<p>the fair needs of the service, money in excess of any return which they
</p>
<p>made to the Government therefor, the conspiracy would be a useless
</p>
<p>and futile thing, and therefore I have spoken of Mr. Brady so far, be-
</p>
<p>cause it was his acts which became necessary to carry out the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, to give it any effect whatever in defrauding the United States.
</p>
<p>There might be a conspiracy to defraud the United States and do
</p>
<p>some act in pursuance of it which would bring the parties within
</p>
<p>the statute which I read to you at the opening of my remarks, but at
</p>
<p>the same time it would be an act which would not result in any actual
</p>
<p>loss to the Government, unless Mr. Brady made the orders sought at
</p>
<p>his hands. In this connection, I may perhaps as well call your atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the fact that a conspiracy is a thing to be proved from the very
</p>
<p>76
</p>
<p>nature of the case from an aggregation of apparently isolated facts.
</p>
<p>People when going ftito a conspiracy to defraud the Government or to
</p>
<p>defraud individuals do not sit down and enter into a contract under
</p>
<p>seal and put it on record somewhere or distribute it around among
</p>
<p>those that they think will go to work and do this thing to defraud
</p>
<p>A, B, C, or the Government, but they make an informal verbal agree-
</p>
<p>ment which is necessarily secret, made among themselves, arid which
</p>
<p>is intended to be kept secret, and the knowledge of which can only be
</p>
<p>acquired by the parties injured either by its results, and the draw-
</p>
<p>ing of the inferences which you will be asked to draw from a large
</p>
<p>number of facts which will be presented to you, or, in some cases,
</p>
<p>from the confession of some of the parties concerned. For such a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, as the court will tell you, to come within the law there must
</p>
<p>be two persons. Two must conspire, and if either one of them does any
</p>
<p>act in pursuance of the conspiracy then both are guilty. If there are
</p>
<p>more than two it is not necessary that all should have come into the
</p>
<p>conspiracy at the same time. It is not necessary that all should have
</p>
<p>continued with the conspiracy through its whole continuance. Two
</p>
<p>people may have formed a conspiracy, and finding that they needed
</p>
<p>somebody else to come into it may bring in the third. They may bring
</p>
<p>in a fourth or any indefinite number. In the same way parties who
</p>
<p>have entered into a conspiracy may go along for a certain time and cer-
</p>
<p>tain portions of them withdraw from it, and in those cases I assume
</p>
<p>that the parties who withdraw from the conspiracy are not to be charge-
</p>
<p>able with any act done after they withdraw, but still remain liable for
</p>
<p>the acts done while they were in it. On the other hand, parties who come
</p>
<p>into a conspiracy after it has commenced, and come into it in pursuance
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy are chargeable, as I understand, for all the acts done,
</p>
<p>even before they come in. That view is, so far as this case is concerned,
</p>
<p>a theoretical question which will not trouble you, gentlemen. I have
</p>
<p>spoken as I said of Brady chiefly, because of his necessity to the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to make it effectual in defrauding the Government. I have
</p>
<p>spoken of him moreover, gentlemen, as the foremost, because, if guilty,
</p>
<p>we regard him as the most guilty person of these defendants before

</p>
<p>you, from the fact that he was, while making these orders, an officer of
</p>
<p>the United States, and was faithless to the trust which was imposed
</p>
<p>upon him.
</p>
<p>As to the other defendants, who were they ? There was Stephen W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey, a Senator of the United States from the State of Arkansas
</p>
<p>down to the 4th of March, 1879. These contracts took effect on the 1st
</p>
<p>of July, 1878. The bids were awarded, I think, in February, 1878. By
</p>
<p>a statute of the United States, Mr. Dorsey, while a Senator, could not
</p>
<p>be interested in any contract with the Govern ment, directly or indirectly.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey, while Senator, was, I think, chairman of the Committee on
</p>
<p>Post Offices, and chairman of the subcommittee in charge of all the ap-
</p>
<p>propriations. That brought him of course directly into connection with
</p>
<p>i the Post-Office Department and its officials, and gave him, as we all
</p>
<p>understand necessarily from the nature of the case, the possession of
</p>
<p>some exceptional power over officials of the department greater power
</p>
<p>than a Senator would have when occupying some other position. Mr.
</p>
<p>John W. Dorsey was the brother of Stephen W. Dorsey, and was the
</p>
<p>resident of a little town in Vermont Middlebury, I think it was and he
</p>
<p>there carried on the trade of a tinsmith. Mr. John M. Peck was the
</p>
<p>brother-in-law of*Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey, residing at or near a ranch of Mr.
</p>
<p>Dorsey's in New Mexico, in so bad health/that, so far as we know, he took
</p>
<p>little active participation in the conspiracy I mean active in the sense
</p>
<p>77
</p>
<p>of moving about, though he signed an abundance of papers, and author-
</p>
<p>ized others to sign an abundance of papers in connection with the mat-
</p>
<p>ter. Mr. John E. Miner had been for years a resident of Sandusky,
</p>
<p>Ohio. He had been there the business associate and friend of Senator
</p>
<p>Dorsey. Mr. Rerdell was from Arkansas, brought here by Senator
</p>
<p>Dorsey, and placed by Senator Dorsey in a position under the District
</p>
<p>government, transferred from that, or performing in connection with
</p>
<p>that, I think, the duties of a secretary to Senator Dorsey, and after
</p>
<p>Senator Dorsey ceased to be Senator Mr. Rerdell at some time passed
</p>
<p>into the position of clerk to him and manager, so to speak, of the mail
</p>
<p>service which was obtained manager on the Washington end, of the
</p>
<p>business of these several defendants in connection with these contracts
</p>
<p>to which I have referred.
</p>
<p>Mr. Yaile's relations to this conspiracy were different from those
</p>
<p>of the others. All of these parties whom I have already mentioned to
</p>
<p>you, you will notice, had no relation to the mail business. They ap-
</p>
<p>parently knew nothing about it. In fact we shall show you that
</p>
<p>they knew nothing about it. Mr. Vaile, however, was a large mail
</p>
<p>contractor engaged in the business, not a speculator in mail con-
</p>
<p>tracts like these other parties. He lived in Missouri. He came
</p>
<p>into the conspiracy, as we claim, at some time after the contracts
</p>
<p>were obtained, certainly before all the routes were put in operation,
</p>
<p>and as we think before the time came for any to be put into operation,
</p>
<p>and he took active charge, became the subcontractor, taking charge of
</p>
<p>the routes I think of ail of the routes in the State of Oregon which were
</p>
<p>awarded to these parties, and perhaps some others.
</p>
<p>We think, gentlemen, that we shall be able to show you that as to this
</p>
<p>conspiracy it had its origin in the brain of Stephen W. Dorsey ; that
</p>
<p>from his position as United States Senator and a member of the Com-
</p>
<p>mittee on Post-Offices he acquired knowledge which led him to think
</p>
<p>that there was a chance tp make money. Then at a very early stage in
</p>
<p>the case he brought into the service of the conspirators I do not say
</p>
<p>into the conspiracy one Albert E. Boone, who had been a clerk in one
</p>
<p>of the departments, and who going out of that had become a contractor

<p>for carrying the mails, and who undoubtedly possessed both brain and
</p>
<p>knowledge, and both of those were useful to Mr. Dorsey so far as related
</p>
<p>to the mail service. Mr. Boone, so far as we know, commenced the busi-
</p>
<p>ness by having been approached by Mr. Dorsey, and invited to come to
</p>
<p>his house, and when he got there to take charge of the business of pre-
</p>
<p>paring the bids for the contracts which Dorsey was seeking to ob-
</p>
<p>tain. They put in a thousand or more bids. A part of those bids
</p>
<p>were put in in the name of John M. Peck, part in the name of
</p>
<p>John W. Dorsey, part in the name of John R. Miner none of
</p>
<p>them, of course, in Stephen W, Dorsey's name, not many certainly
</p>
<p>in the name of Rerdell, and I think none. The bids were prepared in
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey's house in a third -story room. They were prepared there
</p>
<p>tinder the supervision of Mr. Boone, Mr. Miner, I think, having a good
</p>
<p>deal to do with it, Mr. John W. Dorsey little, or comparatively little,
</p>
<p>Mr. John M. Peck having very little to do with it except that his name
</p>
<p>appears to a large number of the bids. We think we shall be able to
</p>
<p>show you who placed that name there. Prior to any putting in of the
</p>
<p>bids and the preparation of them, Mr. Boone had attracted the attention
</p>
<p>of the post-office inspectors so much that they had made a detailed ex-
</p>
<p>amination of the facts and had made a report though not knowing to
</p>
<p>what the preparations which were going on were intended to lead up.
</p>
<p>They found that Mr. Booue was sending out circulars to postmasters all
</p>
<p>78
</p>
<p>over the country asking them for information as to the nature of the
</p>
<p>mail service, the nature of the route, the expenses for horse feed, and
</p>
<p>all the details of that kind, and he was directing the information to be
</p>
<p>returned to the firm to a particular box, which was box No. 714 in the
</p>
<p>post-office, and that lock-box 714 you will find will play an important
</p>
<p>part in connection with this conspiracy. That a large number of the
</p>
<p>. papers which we shall have occasion to present to you came to box 714
</p>
<p>' after this conspiracy got well under way. The answers of the postmas-
</p>
<p>ters were to be sent to James H. Keitner & Company at lock-box 714.
</p>
<p>James H. Keitner was the step-sou of Boone, a boy about 15 or 16 years
</p>
<p>of age. The inducement which Mr. Boone furnished to the postmasters
</p>
<p>to take the trouble to give him this information was his promise that he
</p>
<p>would do for them any business that they had with the department, and
</p>
<p>every postmaster does have business with the department in the settle-
</p>
<p>ment of his accounts and various things as to which it is desirable to
</p>
<p>have a Washington agent. In all that Boone did in that way there
</p>
<p>was nothing that could fairly be styled objectionable. At the same
</p>
<p>time it was a gathering of information which was intended to be used
</p>
<p>by these speculators in mail contracts and which attracted the attention
</p>
<p>of Government officers.
</p>
<p>The next step that appeared in that thing was this: The Post-Office
</p>
<p>Department furnishes blank forms of proposals to bidders for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of having the law complied with, and having everything in form and
</p>
<p>proper, instead of leaving every man to prepare his own proposal, which
</p>
<p>is found in experience to result in great trouble arising from the question
</p>
<p>whether a proposal is in accordance with the law or riot, which lead to com-
</p>
<p>petition between conflicting claims of bidders. The Post Office prepare
</p>
<p>and furnish to contractors or parties intending to become contractors
</p>
<p>blank forms of bids. There is no obligation upon the parties to take them.
</p>
<p>There isno obligation upon them to use them, but that is the practice. Itis
</p>
<p>done in that way. For the purpose of being sfcre that they are properly
</p>
<p>filled up, the Post-Office Department places upon those contracts or
</p>
<p>those bids certain directions, among others, directions that proposals
</p>
<p>alteied by erasure or interlineations will not be considered, directions

</p>
<p>as to before whom the oath of officers should be taken. Then there
</p>
<p>comes in the important question in connection with the sureties. By
</p>
<p>the law, no man can bid for a post-office contract for carrying the mail
</p>
<p>unless he accompanies his bid with a bond of sureties, which sureties
</p>
<p>have to swear before a postmaster that they are worth a given sum,
</p>
<p>adequate to the amount named in the bid, and on each route the Post-
</p>
<p>Office Department in its advertisement fixes the security to be given.
</p>
<p>Any bid to be given must have sureties, and those sureties are required
</p>
<p>to become resp;>nsible, first, that the bidder will enter into the formal
</p>
<p>contract with the Government, and second, that the bidder having
</p>
<p>entered into the formal contract with the Government, will carry it out
</p>
<p>faithfully during the four years of its term. It is a bid which,
</p>
<p>therefore, imposes heavy responsibility upon the sureties, or may
</p>
<p>impose heavy responsibility upon the sureties, and which, when
</p>
<p>parties are going into the business of putting in bids for, say a thou-
</p>
<p>sand routes, imposes a very heavy liability upon the sureties, and if they
</p>
<p>are furnished in good faith and in accordance with the spirit of the law,
</p>
<p>certainly makes it a very difficult thing for parties situated in that way
</p>
<p>to get adequate bonds, because the amount becomes enormous. It is
</p>
<p>a provision, I may say in passing, which seems to me a foolish and
</p>
<p>unnecessary provision in so far as it extends the liability of a surety on
</p>
<p>a bid beyond the time when the formal contract has been entered into.
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>But it is the law. ^N"ow, the Post-Office Department, anxious to get
</p>
<p>the bids all right, places upon the forms of proposals which it issues a
</p>
<p>provision of this kind :
</p>
<p>Sureties are liable during the whole of the contract ter,m. Postmasters will ob-
</p>
<p>serve that tlie improper approval of the bond or the certificate of the sufficiency of
</p>
<p>the sureties thereon exposes them not only to dismissal, but to fine and imprisonment.
</p>
<p>Certificates must not l>e signed until the proposal is complete and a bond signed.
</p>
<p>Postmasters must not divulge the amount of any proposal certified by them under
</p>
<p>penalty of removal.
</p>
<p>Mr. Boone went to the firm of Darby & Duval, in this city, early in
</p>
<p>December, 1877, after he had been employed by Dorsey, and he ordered
</p>
<p>a large quantity of these proposals printed, and he directed to be left
</p>
<p>off of these proposals the clause I have read to you, the directions of
</p>
<p>the Post Office Department placed upon them as to the way in which
</p>
<p>the bonds were to be executed and the cautions to the postmas-
</p>
<p>ters that they must not certify to any bond until executed by the
</p>
<p>parties. And, gentlemen of tlie jury, you will see very clearly the
</p>
<p>importance of that, because if a surety is to become responsible for
</p>
<p>somebody, if he acknowledges it in a blank bond, the moment the
</p>
<p>name is inserted after that it is an altered bond and he gets a defense. If
</p>
<p>the name or amount is not there on the bond he becomes responsible
</p>
<p>for something he knows nothing of ; he has become responsible for a
</p>
<p>contract on a route he knows nothing of, and at any rate the changing
</p>
<p>of it makes an alteration in the bond and discharges the surety. ^Now,
</p>
<p>in that condition of things, having got these bids and bonds printed,
</p>
<p>various postmasters in the State of Arkansas received early in Decem-
</p>
<p>ber, 1877, and in January, 1878, large packages of these bonds and bids
</p>
<p>sent to them in blank with directions or with the request to obtain
</p>
<p>sureties upon the bonds and to have them signed. Those bids and
</p>
<p>bonds thus in blank were sent to several of these postmasters by Ste-
</p>
<p>phen W. Dorsey with letters desiring that they should be executed.
</p>
<p>They were postmasters whom Mr. Dorsey had been influential in secur-
</p>
<p>ing the appointment of to office. They were sent with letters request-
</p>
<p>ing to have sureties secured and to fill up the bonds and return to him, and

</p>
<p>emphasizing the statement of the letter that they must, under no cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, let anybody know that these papers came from him ; that
</p>
<p>his connection with the case must be kept entirely secret. Such bonds
</p>
<p>as that were sent to various postmasters, whom he obviously thought
</p>
<p>he could rely upon. But human nature was better than he thought,
</p>
<p>and various of these postmasters either disregarded his requests and
</p>
<p>passed them by in silence or remonstrated with him. Among others
</p>
<p>was a postmaster at Fort Smith, Mr. Cleudenning, who wrote Mr. Dor-
</p>
<p>sey, calling his attention to the fact that it could not be that he remem-
</p>
<p>bered the provisions of law and that he desired him to go on and do
</p>
<p>this thing which he had requested in view of the law, and in requesting
</p>
<p>it, let me say, he had sent in his own handwriting little pieces of paper
</p>
<p>giving directions in detail how the whole thing was to be done ; what
</p>
<p>was to be written in by the sureties and everything of that sort, and
</p>
<p>all these bids that he sent there were absolute blanks. He requested
</p>
<p>them to be filled up by the sureties in direct violation of law, and
</p>
<p>in that connection it is significant that this direction from the Post-
</p>
<p>Office Department to the postmasters that they must not fill up a bond
</p>
<p>unless the bid attached to it was completed was omitted on the form of
</p>
<p>blanks which Dorsey sent out. The postmaster at Fort Smith, among
</p>
<p>others, remonstrated and declined to comply with Mr. Dorsey's request,
</p>
<p>and it led to a rather animated correspondence. We shall put that cor-
</p>
<p>80
</p>
<p>respondence before you, gentlemen. We shall put before you the orig-
</p>
<p>inal paper sent by Mr. Dorsey. We shall put the postmaster before
</p>
<p>you, and he will show you the whole condition of that matter.
</p>
<p>As to all this, gentlemen, bear in mind the statute which forbade a
</p>
<p>Senator to be interested in any contract. Mr. Dorsey was careful to
</p>
<p>say that he was acting for a friend ; that he was doing a friend a kind-
</p>
<p>ness, and had no interest in it ; but he was very particular that nobody
</p>
<p>should even know he was doing that friend a kindness. He was not
</p>
<p>going to let his right hand know what his left hand was doing. These
</p>
<p>bids having been prepared in Dorsey's house, we find this condition of
</p>
<p>things. Save in the single State of Kansas, Mr. Peck, John W. Dorsey, and
</p>
<p>Miner never in bidding, 1 think there may be exceptional instances
</p>
<p>came in conflict with each other. They put in in the aggregate a thou-
</p>
<p>sand or more bids. Any two of them never bid upon the' same route.
</p>
<p>There may be, and I think there are, one or two exceptional cases where
</p>
<p>there apparently is a reason for it; but that is the rule. So that they
</p>
<p>did not come into conflict with each other, and there is no question upon
</p>
<p>that. They got under those bids one hundred and thirty-four contracts.
</p>
<p>The contracts took effect on the 1st of July, 1878. Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey
</p>
<p>will be shown to you as constantly interested, constantly intervening on
</p>
<p>behalf of these parties, and of course the claim, I presume, will be made
</p>
<p>that he was doing a brotherly act merely, but as soon as Mr. Dorsey went
</p>
<p>out of the Senate, on the 4th of March, 1879, within, I think, less than
</p>
<p>thirty days after that time, Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey appears publicly
</p>
<p>as interested in all or a certain portion of these contracts which had
</p>
<p>been obtained. I called your attention to the fact, gentlemen, that in
</p>
<p>bidding for these contracts they bid only on the routes, as a general
</p>
<p>thing, which were of slow time, \\here expedition could be obtained,
</p>
<p>or where the service was infrequent one, two, or three trips a
</p>
<p>W eek where an increase of trips could be obtained. In passing
</p>
<p>let me say that Mr. Vaile, whenever he did come into the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>probably as early as July, 1878, seems to have protected himself in a
</p>
<p>measure by taking a large number of subcontracts, and so far as the
</p>
<p>files of the department show, he appears as being as early as that the

</p>
<p>subcontractor on some fifty or sixty of the one hundred and thirty-four
</p>
<p>routes which these parties obtained, beinc: the subcontractor of record,
</p>
<p>but not necessarily or generally the subcontractor who was performing
</p>
<p>the service, but his subcontract was filed with the effect certainly ot
</p>
<p>protecting the subcontractor who was performing the service from hav-
</p>
<p>ing any recognition from the Government, or the terms of a real sub-
</p>
<p>contract from ever becoming known to the Government.
</p>
<p>I have said that these contracts were obtained, and that Stephen W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey became openly interested in them as early as April, 1879. At
</p>
<p>some time after that there seems to have been in form or in fact some-
</p>
<p>thing in the nature of a division. They seem to have cut up their
</p>
<p>routes in a measure. Miner seems to have taken certain routes, Stephen
</p>
<p>W. Dorsey seems to have taken certain routes, and Peck seems to have
</p>
<p>taken certain routes, but they also seem to have at once u pooled
</p>
<p>their issues " in a measure. Miner and Vaile certainly acted from that
</p>
<p>time together in all matters, and the parties continued apparently to
</p>
<p>take an active interest even in the routes which had been in form
</p>
<p>assigned to one of the others, and Mr. Brady recognized their authority
</p>
<p>so to do. For instance, on the route from Pueblo to Kosita, Mr. John
</p>
<p>W. Dorsey nominally stating himself to be the subcontractor, made the
</p>
<p>affidavit upon which the expedition was obtained. He was not subcon-
</p>
<p>tractor, he was not contractor. He was not in any manner connected
</p>
<p>81
</p>
<p>with the route except as a fellow member of the conspiracy, a coconspir-
</p>
<p>atpr ; knowledge of that was not a knowledge of course of record at the
</p>
<p>Post-Office, but was a knowledge which was obtained of an illegitimate
</p>
<p>relation, and yet the position was recognized by Brady as sufficient to
</p>
<p>enable him to make the affidavit which the regulation, which is a law,
</p>
<p>required to be made by the contractor, and he recognized John W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey's authority to make it upon that route. On the route from
</p>
<p>Trinidad to Madison, Mr. John W. Dorsey did precisely the same
</p>
<p>thing, and yet had no relation to it. Miner was the contractor, and
</p>
<p>Stephen W. Dorsey was the subcontractor by a contract not then filed,
</p>
<p>but John W. Dorsey was the man who was recognized by Mr. Brady as
</p>
<p>being sufficient to make the affidavit on which the expedition was based.
</p>
<p>On route 38145, from Ojo Caliente to Parrott City, John it. Miner
</p>
<p>writes a letter, which he says he does at the request of Stephen W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey, then in the Senate. He makes the request in consequence of the
</p>
<p>absence of John W. Dorsey, who was out in the Territories in connec-
</p>
<p>tion with some of these other routes. Miner wrote at the request of
</p>
<p>Stephen W. Dorsey, and on behalf of John W. Dorsey, to a personal
</p>
<p>friend and acquaintance of Stephen's to take the subcontract, and carry
</p>
<p>the mail upon that route.
</p>
<p>Ou the route from Yermillion to Sioux Falls Mr. Harvey M. Yaile
</p>
<p>makes the affidavit, though he was not the contractor. He was the nomi-
</p>
<p>nal subcontractor, so far as the records of the department show, while
</p>
<p>in point of fact the service was being performed by an entire I y different
</p>
<p>person, whom we shall place before you.
</p>
<p>On the route from Eugene City to Bridge Creek John M. Peck was
</p>
<p>the contractor, and yet Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey appears in connection
</p>
<p>with that route in a somewhat manifold capacity, which I will not stop
</p>
<p>here to detail to you.
</p>
<p>On the route from Mineral Park to Pioche Mr. John W. Dorsey was
</p>
<p>the contractor. Mr. John M. Peck, in a letter written by John R. Miner,
</p>
<p>requests the Post-Office Department to authorize him to sublet that
</p>
<p>contract. Under the law no contract can be sublet without the con-
</p>
<p>sent of the Post-Office Department. John W. Dorsey being the con-

</p>
<p>tractor, John M. Peck, a man who, on the record, certainly had no con-
</p>
<p>nection with the route, writes to Brady asking permission to sublet
</p>
<p>that contract. Mr. Brady authorizes him to sublet the contract and
</p>
<p>recognizes the contract which was made in pursuance of that provision.
</p>
<p>And yet Peck, in whose name the letter was written, and Miner, who
</p>
<p>wrote it, were equally strangers, so far as the Post-Office Department
</p>
<p>knew, to the contract, and had no relation to it. They had a series of
</p>
<p>firms and they were as miscellaneous as possible. There was Miner,
</p>
<p>Peck & Co. ; there was Miner, Vaile & Co. ; there was Miner, Dorsey &
</p>
<p>Co. ; there was J. W. Dorsey & Co., and the u babies were interchanged"
</p>
<p>generally. There was no danger of their getting lost, however, because
</p>
<p>the parties were all mutually interested. Subsequent to that time, and at
</p>
<p>various periods as we go along, you will find Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey en-
</p>
<p>gaged in getting up petitions, writing to his old triends, and calling
</p>
<p>upon them to help him in getting up petitions and in writing letters to
</p>
<p>aid in advancing these contracts and the interests of these contractors.
</p>
<p>He did so at first with an entire concealment of his own interest
</p>
<p>in the matter. But after he ceased to be United States Senator, and
</p>
<p>the statute upon that subject ceased to apply to him, he threw off
</p>
<p>the mask, and did the business more openly if not more generally. We
</p>
<p>think we shall be able to show you, gentlemen, from tLeseaml other
</p>
<p>facts which I will not stop to repeat, that all t'nese parties were inter-
</p>
<p>6GB
</p>
<p>82
</p>
<p>ested in those routes, and that they continued interested in the routes
</p>
<p>after the nominal division; but whether they did or did not continue
</p>
<p>their actual interest is a matter of very little importance, if they entered
</p>
<p>into the conspiracy and got from the Government certain contracts
</p>
<p>which were their capital in business, which they were going to use in
</p>
<p>defrauding the Government. It made very little difference whether
</p>
<p>they took their profits by taking a portion of the joint profits of all of
</p>
<p>the routes or whether they divided, so to speak, their capital, and each
</p>
<p>one took all the profits on a particular block of the route. The loss to
</p>
<p>the Government was the same, the fraud and injury was the same.
</p>
<p>This being the relation of these parties to the conspiracy we then find
</p>
<p>the actors all placed ready to perform their parts, and the question is
</p>
<p>now what in detail did they do so far as concerns the different routes?
</p>
<p>Therefore, gentlemen, 1 propose very briefly to take up the evidence
</p>
<p>which we shall submit to you in connection with each one of the routes
</p>
<p>named in this indictment.
</p>
<p>On route 34149, from Kearney to Kent, the contract was let basing it
</p>
<p>on the advertisement as a hundred and twenty-five miles, for service
</p>
<p>once a week. John M. Peck became the contractor at $808 a year.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of September, 1878, there, was made one of those little ad-
</p>
<p>ditions of a town called Fitzalon, which was alleged to add fifteen miles,
</p>
<p>more or less, to the route. That matter is a little complicated, arising
</p>
<p>from a change of the route. We claim that the order was entirely un-
</p>
<p>authorized. Primarily a small sum of a hundred and odd dollars re-
</p>
<p>sulted as an emolument to the contractor, but after it was counted in
</p>
<p>the problem in connection with expedition the amount was added to
</p>
<p>very greatly. On the 10th of July, 1879, a year after the contract was
</p>
<p>let, two trips were added over a portion of the route, that from Kearney
</p>
<p>to Loup City. In consequence of the addition of those two trips there
</p>
<p>was added to the original pay of $868, $1,122.41. At the same time
</p>
<p>that the three trips were added the time was reduced to thirteen hours,
</p>
<p>and there was added in consequence of that $2,200 to the contractor's
</p>
<p>pay. That carried the whole amount up to $4,302.05. The post-offices
</p>
<p>on that route produced an average of $o94 to the Government. The ter-

</p>
<p>minal post-offices were situated upon railroads running east and west,
</p>
<p>and the receipts of Kearney are not counted in this statement, as they
</p>
<p>came from mail carried on the railroad. 1 have already called your
</p>
<p>attention to the fact that the mail-matter, after it got out a few miles
</p>
<p>on the route, amounted only to twenty or thirty pounds. Now, on that
</p>
<p>route where they got originally $808, one French became the subcon-
</p>
<p>tractor at $700. So that at the outset Peck, who was the nominal
</p>
<p>contractor, had a profit of $108. When the contract was increased in
</p>
<p>July, 1879, to three trips French received $1,587.40 in all, and did all
</p>
<p>the service, and Peck received $2,715.08, and did no service. Mr.
</p>
<p>French will be on the stand before you, and will testify as to the proper
</p>
<p>amount to be allowed for the service and the condition of things there.
</p>
<p>Mr. French made a contract, and we shall produce to you the letters pass-
</p>
<p>ing between him and John W. Dorsey in connection with that contract
</p>
<p>in which there was a stipulation that he was to have 05 per cent, of the
</p>
<p>amount allowed for expedition. When expedition came for which $2.200
</p>
<p>was allowed Mr. French received no portion of that sum, though he
</p>
<p>knew that the schedule had been changed. It had been changed so little
</p>
<p>that it made little, if any, difference in the time which he took in going
</p>
<p>over the route. He was already going over the route in about the expe-
</p>
<p>dited time. They corresponded with him and Miner, Peck & Co. re-
</p>
<p>mitted him his quarterly pay? and left him in entire ignorance that
</p>
<p>83
</p>
<p>there had been any payment by the department for expedition, although
</p>
<p>he was entitled to 65 per cent, of the $2,200. Mr. French jogged over
</p>
<p>that route with his horses day in and day out, and performed all the
</p>
<p>service that was ever performed ; earned all the money that was ever
</p>
<p>eamed and never learned that the department was paying $2,200 for
</p>
<p>expedited time which he, if anybody, was making, but which, in point of
</p>
<p>fact, did not change the time made to any serious extent, until after this
</p>
<p>investigation was set on foot, when a post-office inspector going out on
</p>
<p>his route conveyed, by accident, to Mr. French the first knowledge that
</p>
<p>he had that there had ever been any expedition, and that he was enti-
</p>
<p>tled to the 65 per cent, of $2,200 under his contract. Now that was simply
</p>
<p>a private fraud upon Mr. French of which you cannot take any cogni-
</p>
<p>zance. I only mention it in connection with this route as showing
</p>
<p>the conduct of these parties, and showing how unnecessary it was to
</p>
<p>pay money for expedition when the man who rendered the service was
</p>
<p>to get none of it. That, gentlemen of the jury, is the same route on
</p>
<p>which the other branch of fraud took place, to which I referred, Mr.
</p>
<p>Peck having as early as February, and away out in Xew Mexico, found
</p>
<p>out by some intuition that Mr. Brady was going to want to know just
</p>
<p>how many horses would be required to make that service in thirteen
</p>
<p>hours. So he made his affidavit in February to that effect, and there
</p>
<p>was never any petition or paper of any kind on file asking for thirteen
</p>
<p>hours, excepting the altered petition into which thirteen hours was boldly
</p>
<p>inserted in a different handwriting after it was received hereby John K.
</p>
<p>Miner. I think we shall be able to show by whom it was inserted.
</p>
<p>That was the route on which the forged petition was. That forged pe-
</p>
<p>tition was the only paper, and it was used as the basis of an order for
</p>
<p>expedition which took $2,200 a year out of the Treasury to pay not to
</p>
<p>the man who rendered the service, but to the men who sat here in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington and did nothing.
</p>
<p>Route 38135, from Saint Charles to Greenhorn, was originally let as
</p>
<p>thirty-five miles long, at a schedule time of twelve and a half hours. In.
</p>
<p>point of fact the distance from Saint Charles to Greenhorn was only twenty-
</p>
<p>three miles. It ought originally to have been advertised as from Pueblo to

</p>
<p>Greenhorn, because Saint Charles was merely a water-tank. There was
</p>
<p>no village there at all. The tank was three or four miles from the
</p>
<p>traveled road and on the railroad. At that water-tank the trains did
</p>
<p>not generally stop. The advertisement was persisted in by Brady r
</p>
<p>though his attention was called to it before the contract was let and
</p>
<p>though a post-office inspector reported upon the subject to him. The dis-
</p>
<p>tance, as I said, to Saint Charles was only twenty-three miles. By and by
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady proceeded to increase the route by extending it from Saint
</p>
<p>Charles to Pueblo. This added twelve miles, and made it, in point of fact,
</p>
<p>thirty-five miles, which was just as advertised, but Mr. Brady treated it
</p>
<p>as a lengthening of the route and allowed for that twelve miles an addi-
</p>
<p>tional compensation of $328.80. My friend has drawn here substantially
</p>
<p>a sketch of the route. [Exhibiting sketch to jury.| The contract was let
</p>
<p>on that route at $548 a year. When Brady extended it from Saint
</p>
<p>Charles to Pueblo he added $328.80 to it so as to make the con-
</p>
<p>tract price $808, or a little over that. At the very time that he
</p>
<p>ordered the additional pay there was on file in the department a tem-
</p>
<p>porary contract made by the postmaster out there for carrying the mail
</p>
<p>over the whole route for $612. So that Mr. Brady paid $868 while there
</p>
<p>was on file the contract of the subcontractor showing that he was willing
</p>
<p>to perform the service over the whole route for $612, and also showing
</p>
<p>that the amount which Mr. Brady allowed for the added twelve miles
</p>
<p>84
</p>
<p>$320 was greatly in excess of the amount which the subcontractor was
</p>
<p>actually getting for it, and that by a temporary contract made by his
</p>
<p>own postmaster. You will bear in mind that when anybody enters into
</p>
<p>such a temporary contract with the Post-Office Department they must
</p>
<p>necessaril}' expect to be paid more than a man does who enters into a
</p>
<p>contract to carry the mail for four years, because the temporary contract
</p>
<p>can be terminated at any time, subjecting the contractor to a loss. Now.
</p>
<p>the service having been carried by Brady up to $868 a year, of which
</p>
<p>the subcontractor got $612, it was increased by Brady on the 14th of
</p>
<p>July, 1870, one year after the contract went into effect, to $3, 945. CO. The
</p>
<p>supposititious twelve miles between Saint Charles and Pueblo, which
</p>
<p>did not extend the advertised length of the route, and for which $320
</p>
<p>was paid, was made, when it came to expedition, to take from the
</p>
<p>Treasury $1,479.00 a year, being nearly three times the amount of the
</p>
<p>original contract for the whole route. That contract continued in force
</p>
<p>in those terms, except that the route was at one time run up to $4,314.50,
</p>
<p>during the entire time that Thomas J. Brady was Second Assistant
</p>
<p>Postmaster-General. If he had spent the money in giving to that route
</p>
<p>a daily service instead of this pretended expedited time he could have
</p>
<p>given daily service to all the people upon the route, although they did
</p>
<p>not need it much more than they needed the expedited time, for a con-
</p>
<p>siderable less amount of money than he chose to waste upon these con-
</p>
<p>tractors for performing the service three times a week upon that alleged
</p>
<p>expedited time. That expedition was obtained on the affidavit of John
</p>
<p>E. Miner, who swore on the 7th of April, 1879, that on the then exist-
</p>
<p>ing schedule it took one man and two horses to perform the service and
</p>
<p>that when it was reduced to the time to which Mr. Brady reduced it, it
</p>
<p>would take four men and seven horses. In point of fact it took only
</p>
<p>one man and two horses to perform the original schedule, and in point
</p>
<p>of fact it took only one man and two horses to perform the increased
</p>
<p>service for which Mr. Brady paid two or three thousand dollars a year,
</p>
<p>and it took the same man and the same horses all the time. There
</p>
<p>was no change whatever. There was 110 authority under the law to pay
</p>
<p>a dollar out of the Treasury unless there was an increase of men and

</p>
<p>horses, yet we shall place before you the man who was performing that
</p>
<p>service and driving the horses, and he will testify that there was no ad-
</p>
<p>dition to the stock or carriers in consequence of the expedition. There-
</p>
<p>fore the order of Mr. Brady for the benefit of these defendants was
</p>
<p>clearly illegal. There was a little steal on that route to which I may
</p>
<p>just as well call your attention in passing. I think I said something
</p>
<p>about it before. They added the town of Agate, which was on a little
</p>
<p>spur, and they allowed $369.90 a year for it. Not one pound of mail
</p>
<p>ever went to Agate. The carrier never wei<t to Agate. There never
</p>
<p>was a day's service performed or an hour's service. The postmaster so
</p>
<p>reported, and after a time Mr. Brady countermanded the order for serv-
</p>
<p>ice, after two or three months. He allowed for the service which had
</p>
<p>not been performed and which the postmaster told him had not been
</p>
<p>performed, and he also came in and allowed the mouth's extra pay which
</p>
<p>is allowed upon the discontinuance of service that is being performed.
</p>
<p>He allowed a month's extra pay there on service that was not being per-
</p>
<p>formed as the record of his own department shows, because he was re-
</p>
<p>scinding the order for the service upon the express ground that it had
</p>
<p>not been performed. Here 1 ought to say that I told you that Mr. Rerdell's
</p>
<p>lock-box 714 would appear in various places in this case ; it was to that
</p>
<p>box or to box 706 that by notice filed in the Post Office Department
</p>
<p>all communications were to be sent. This expedition, for which Brady
</p>
<p>85
</p>
<p>paid two or three thousand dollars, was granted on a petition
</p>
<p>which stated the necessity for communication with the outer world,
</p>
<p>with the East, where lived the friends and correspondents of the
</p>
<p>people of that section. It was not for the benefit of the population
</p>
<p>along the route, communicating between themselves, but was for corre-
</p>
<p>spondence passingbeyond. Yet Mr. Brady having made this expedition at
</p>
<p>this expense, immediately proceeded to put in force a schedule so ar-
</p>
<p>ranged that the mail arrived at Pueblo just after the mail east and west
</p>
<p>had both left, and therefore there was no possibility of communication
</p>
<p>either way. All the excuse, all the pretense for the order of expedition
</p>
<p>was simply that the mails might reach the East quickly, and yet this
</p>
<p>result was not reached because they laid over at Pueblo so many hours,
</p>
<p>Pueblo being an important railroad station. On that route there were
</p>
<p>but two intermediate offices, Greenhorn and Muddy Creek. Saint
</p>
<p>Charles was no office. The revenue of the Muddy Creek post-office was
</p>
<p>819.80 $ the revenue of the Greenhorn post-office was $145 ; making
</p>
<p>an aggregate revenue on that route of $164.80, and yet Brady paid
</p>
<p>83,945.60 for carrying the mail over it. Moreover the expedition was
</p>
<p>made upon that route upon petitions looking to " quicker time," not
</p>
<p>specifying any time in particular, upon petitions which are worded
</p>
<p>identically and are in the same handwriting*, and were transmitted to
</p>
<p>the department by Miner, the contractor to be benefited, and his
</p>
<p>affidavit was, I think, taken and allowed to fix the amount which should
</p>
<p>be paid to himself. That affidavit was grossly incorrect. Several of
</p>
<p>the petitions upon that route were also interlined obviously after they
</p>
<p>were prepared, and they are interlined in the handwriting of Moutfort
</p>
<p>C. Eerdell, one of these defendants.
</p>
<p>Route 41119, from Toquerville to Adairville, was let as one hundred
</p>
<p>and thirty-two miles long. The schedule of time was sixty hours, the
</p>
<p>number of trips per week one, and John M. Peck, the contractor, was to
</p>
<p>receive from the Government $1,168 a year. Before the service com-
</p>
<p>menced notice was given that the address was to be lock-box 714, care
</p>
<p>of M. C. Rerdell. On the 8th of March, 1879, Harvey M. Yaile became
</p>
<p>subcontractor by a contract dated the 1st of April, 1878. It was after

</p>
<p>the contracts had been awarded, therefore, and before the contract term
</p>
<p>commenced by two months, and that shows Mr. Yaile's connection at
</p>
<p>least with that route as early as April, 1878, or else the subcontract is
</p>
<p>a lie. That subcontract was signed by John R. Miner, as attorney for
</p>
<p>John M. Peck. It was withdrawn on the 8th of May, 1879, after it
</p>
<p>had been on file two mouths, and a subcontract was put on file with M.
</p>
<p>C. Rerdell. That subcontract, like Yaile's subcontract, was also dated
</p>
<p>the 1st of April, 1878. There were successively placed on file two
</p>
<p>subcontracts in favor of two separate defendants, both of those subcon-
</p>
<p>tracts bearing date, and claiming to have been executed, on the 1st
</p>
<p>day of April, 1878, and each one being entitled to the whole amount
</p>
<p>of pay on the route. Rerdell's contract pretends to be dated on the
</p>
<p>1st of April, 1878, and specifies that the pay of the route is $3,504.
</p>
<p>Xow, gentlemen, we have this extraordinary condition of things : The
</p>
<p>Amount of pay on that route did not become $3,504 until the 10th d*y
</p>
<p>of Xovember,'l878, and yet this contract dated on the 1st of April, 1878,
</p>
<p>states the pay at that amount. Was the subcontract a fraud in its
</p>
<p>date, or did Miner, Rerdell & Co. then know that they had perfecUMl
</p>
<p>an arrangement with Thomas J. Brady, by which the amount to bo
</p>
<p>paid to the Government was to be run up to $3,504.98 ? We are going
</p>
<p>to ask yon to draw the latter inference from the facts. On the 8th of
</p>
<p>May, Rerdell having put his subcontract on file, and forgotten, appar-
</p>
<p>86
</p>
<p>ently, that he had already directed how he should be addressed, wrote
</p>
<p>to the Post-Office Department to be sure and address everything- to
</p>
<p>him. On the 12th of April, 1679, before the original contract had been
</p>
<p>placed on file, and but a year after its date, Eerdell wrote as agent for the
</p>
<p>original contractor assuming, apparently, that Peck had still some
</p>
<p>interest to one Kephi Johnson, a subcontractor on the route, to get
</p>
<p>up petitions, have them numerously signed, giving the precise form in
</p>
<p>which the petitions were to be prepared. He said, " This is the gen-
</p>
<p>eral form. Do not use the precise language. Give as many reasons as
</p>
<p>you can for increasing the service and expediting the time. Get letters
</p>
<p>to the Postmaster-General. Get your Delegate stirred up, and gen-
</p>
<p>erally do everything you can to manufacture public opinion." On
</p>
<p>the l()th of July, 1870, Mr. John W. Dorsey turns up as having some
</p>
<p>kind of an interest in that route, and he writes to Johnson to the same
</p>
<p>effect and incloses a petition which he wants to have Johnson sign and
</p>
<p>then send it to Mr. Cannon, the Delegate from the Territory. On the
</p>
<p>5th of May, 1879, after Rerdell had written his letter asking that the
</p>
<p>petition should be gotten up, and before the letter of John W. Dorsey,
</p>
<p>Mr. Stephen W. Dorse\, who had recently gone out of the Senate of
</p>
<p>the United States and could therefore openly appear, wrote to Johnson,
</p>
<p>urging him to keep on and guaranteeing him that he, Stephen W. Dor-
</p>
<p>sey, would be responsible to him for the pay for the mail service, and
</p>
<p>everything of that kind. A little later Mr. John W. Dorsey went out
</p>
<p>there and had an interview with Mr. Johnson. He told Johnson that
</p>
<p>certain parties in Washington were members of the combination and
</p>
<p>that they had a great deal of influence in Washington. About the same
</p>
<p>period or a little earlier for the dates and the different actors in this
</p>
<p>matter are somewhat mixed on the 5th of May, 1879, Stephen W. Dor-
</p>
<p>sey wrote to Johnson, inclosing a new contract, which was to be signed.
</p>
<p>He gave as an excuse for wanting a new contract signed, there having
</p>
<p>been one subcontract Avith him, that there had been a dissolution of the
</p>
<p>firm. He did not tell what the firm was, but it was some firm of which
</p>
<p>Stephen W. Dorsey had been a member, and which he had managed to
</p>
<p>become a member of certainly a considerable time prior to the 5th of
</p>

</p>
<p>May, 1879, for on that day it was dissolved. Mr. Dorsey was a member
</p>
<p>of it when it was dissolved, and he had not gone out of the Senate until
</p>
<p>the 4th of March, 1879. At any rate, he had got into the firm on the
</p>
<p>record and dissolved it, and then he sent out to have a new subcon-
</p>
<p>tract executed with Johnson, and that new subcontract contains some
</p>
<p>printed clauses which were nicely calculated to entrap Mr. Johnson, and
</p>
<p>which we shall have occasion to show to you.
</p>
<p>On the 8th of July, 1879, a little later on, five trips were added to
</p>
<p>the route. Then there was an expedition, and as the result $2,336 were
</p>
<p>first added to the compensation, and after that $4,072 were added.
</p>
<p>The time was expedited from sixty hours to thirty-three hours, and
</p>
<p>they added $12,718.22, the result being that the original contract of
</p>
<p>$1,108 got up in a little over twelve months to $20,890.22, and of
</p>
<p>that sum the subcontractor who did the work got $7,444, and Stephen
</p>
<p>W. Dorsey and his associates got $12,450. The increase of trips and
</p>
<p>expedition on this route commenced on the 1st of August, but on the
</p>
<p>June previous the terminal post-office had been discontinued and notice
</p>
<p>given to Brady. Therefore there was no mail to go over ten miles of the
</p>
<p>route, and no post-office to carry it to. Brady, on the 8th of July, made
</p>
<p>the order giving expedition and adding for it 812,722. At that time he
</p>
<p>had had notice that over ten miles of the route there was and could be
</p>
<p>no service, and yet he made the order for expedition over the whole
</p>
<p>87
</p>
<p>route. Having' made that order on the 8th of July, on the 14th of July,
</p>
<p>six days later, he made his order cutting oft ten miles of service, and
</p>
<p>said the contractor should have a month's extra pay. That order, in
</p>
<p>effect, said, " By virtue of the order made on the 8th of July, long after
</p>
<p>I knew there was no service on that part of the route, I will yet pay for
</p>
<p>the ten miles a month's extra pay, and I will reckon the amount not on
</p>
<p>the compensation of $1,168, but on the compensation of $20.890.22."
</p>
<p>You do not need to be much of arithmeticians to see how nicely the
</p>
<p>Government was cheated by that little transaction; nor can you tell for
</p>
<p>whose benefit it was other than that of the contractors, unless it was for
</p>
<p>the benefit of Thomas J. Brady. By going a little more into detail on
</p>
<p>that route you will see that the expedition was obtained by an order
</p>
<p>made in June or July, on the affidavit of Peck, dated in the January pre-
</p>
<p>vious. Peck then knew just what schedule would be required. He
</p>
<p>knew in January that Mr. Brady would want to know away down in
</p>
<p>July how many men and horses it would take to carry that mail in thirty-
</p>
<p>three hours. It might as well have been reduced to forty-eight hours,
</p>
<p>or to twenty hours, or any other number; but somehow or other in the
</p>
<p>previous January Mr. Peck knew that Mr. Brady would want to cut it
</p>
<p>down to thirty-three hours, and he swore that to perform the service in
</p>
<p>sixty hours would take three men and six horses, and in thirty-three
</p>
<p>hours five men and eight horses. In point of fact, on a sixty-hour
</p>
<p>schedule, it took about the number of men and horses he stated; it
</p>
<p>took four men and ten horses. But with the thirty-three-hour schedule
</p>
<p>it took seven men and fifteen horses. That expedition was ordered by
</p>
<p>Brady, as I have stated, in July, 1879. After it had been done, a post-
</p>
<p>master on the route reported to Brady that the expedited time of thir-
</p>
<p>ty-three hours could not be made by any possibility; that the people
</p>
<p>along the route did not care for it, and he added, in the innocence of
</p>
<p>his heart, " it it costs the Government anything, I think you had better
</p>
<p>discontinue it."
</p>
<p>It cost the Government the difference between $1,100 and $12,000.
</p>
<p>There had been a previous letter in which the same postmaster had
</p>
<p>given the same information. This is the route, gentlemen, upon which

<p>John W. Dorsey having been out there arranged that the subcontractor
</p>
<p>should get $7,400, and that he and his associate should get $12,450.
</p>
<p>Mr. John W. Dorsey wrote him that that " brought it nearer pro rata
</p>
<p>than any trade he had made since he left home." From that you can
</p>
<p>understand precisely what these defendants' ideas of pro rata were.
</p>
<p>The idea is that the man who does the service shall get $7,500, and the
</p>
<p>man in Washington who arranges for getting the orders, $12,400. That
</p>
<p>petition which I said was sent to Johnson by these defendants was
</p>
<p>duly signed, and it caine back just before the order was made. It is
</p>
<p>on file in the department. We shall produce it to you, and we shall
</p>
<p>show you just how many persons whose names purport to be upon it
</p>
<p>lived along the route. And we shall show you, moreover, this extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary condition of things: That the people out there asked for a re-
</p>
<p>duction to only forty-eight hours, and Brady made the order to re-
</p>
<p>duce it to thirty-three hours. Peck, in the previous January, six
</p>
<p>months before, knew that Brady was going to make an order for thirty -
</p>
<p>three hours, and Brady made it, basing it upon a petition which in ponit
</p>
<p>of fact asked for forty-eight hours, and that only, ^sow, a little fur-
</p>
<p>ther on, in April, 1880, Mr. Johnson having previously sent to the Post-
</p>
<p>Office Department through Delegate Cannon a remonstrance signed by
</p>
<p>all the postmasters on the route, stating that thirty-three hours' time
</p>
<p>was unnecessary if not impracticable, and recommending a restoration
</p>
<p>88
</p>
<p>to sixty hours, Mr. Camion apparently did his duty and apparently put
</p>
<p>that paper on tile, for we find that on the 3d of April, 1880, Mr. Ker-
</p>
<p>dell writes to Mr. Johnson, " We have increased your pay $1,500," a
</p>
<p>voluntary increase of pay. Did they wish him to suppose they were
</p>
<p>going* into the general benevolence business?* Then he goes on to say y
</p>
<p>u We make this allowance in order to have the service remain as it now
</p>
<p>exists. We understand you have been sending letters to your Delegate,
</p>
<p>asking to have the time restored according to the old schedule. We
</p>
<p>want you to write to him to withdraw the letters, as we shall lose
</p>
<p>money if the service is changed back to the old schedule. As it is we
</p>
<p>niakb a small profit," which means we get $12,450 and you get $8,400.
</p>
<p>" We make a small profit."
</p>
<p>Eerdell wrote again on the 9th of May to Johnson, in which letter he
</p>
<p>wants Delegate Cannon to withdraw that remonstrance ; and, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, when we came to search the files of the department a year ago,,
</p>
<p>after Mr. Brady had gone out of office, that petition had disappeared
</p>
<p>from the files of the department, though there was no way in which it
</p>
<p>could legally or honestly, having been once filed there, disappear. But
</p>
<p>it has gone, and the request of Miner that Johnson should write ta
</p>
<p>Cannon and withdraw the remonstrance was carried out, and Johnson
</p>
<p>did write to Cannon, because of this fifteen hundred and odd dollars a
</p>
<p>year which they gave him, to have just that thing done. We shall ask
</p>
<p>you to consider when you come to make up your verdict whether they
</p>
<p>were not right in withdrawing that kind of remonstrance coming from
</p>
<p>every postmaster along the route against their pay when Brady was pay-
</p>
<p>ing them $12,400 for doing nothing. There had got to be some pretense
</p>
<p>of keeping up appearances. That, gentlemen of the jury, ends all I
</p>
<p>have to say upon that route, and I suppose this is as good a time for
</p>
<p>relieving the jury for a brief period as any that will come.
</p>
<p>At this point (1 o'clock and 45 minutes p. in.) the court took its usual
</p>
<p>recess.
</p>
<p>AFTER RECESS.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Eesuming,] On the last route, gentlemen, I ought to have
</p>
<p>called your attention to the fact that John W. Dorsey, when he was

</p>
<p>out in Utah upon that route, told Mr. Johnson that Peck, Miner & Co.
</p>
<p>were interested with him ; that they had some two hundred contracts;
</p>
<p>that they had a great deal of influence in Washington; that Brady
</p>
<p>was a very fine man. And in his letter which he wrote him, sending
</p>
<p>him petitions to be circulated, he told them they must all work together
</p>
<p>or none of them would get along.
</p>
<p>On the route from Garland to Parrott City, which was originally let
</p>
<p>at 288 miles, the time to be seven days, and to be one trip in the week,.
</p>
<p>John W. Dorsey was the contractor, at $2,745 a year. There, as else-
</p>
<p>where, lock box 714 was the place of address for letters. There were
</p>
<p>lock box 700 and lock box 714, which were used by these different par-
</p>
<p>ties, Rerdell, perhaps, using lock box 706 the most after his original
</p>
<p>experience with James H. Keitner & Co.
</p>
<p>On the 1st of October, 1878, on this route, one J. H. Watts filed a
</p>
<p>subcontract by which he was to get fifty per cent, of all expedition,
</p>
<p>making a contract with the parties, therefore, as early as that looking
</p>
<p>to expedition. On the 1st of January, 1879, a subcontract was made
</p>
<p>with one Anthony Joseph, a gentleman whom we shall place before
</p>
<p>you, a senator of the Territorial legislature of New Mexico. I think that
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>contract was not filed, though made. His subcontract continued until
</p>
<p>about the 27th of September, 1879, when the contract of a man named
</p>
<p>Jaramillo was filed. That gentleman we shall also place before you.
</p>
<p>On the 30th of January, 1880, the subcontract of one Sanderson was
</p>
<p>filed. That is the history, of the subcontracts
</p>
<p>On that route as early as the 10th of June, 1878, twenty days be-
</p>
<p>fore the contract term commenced, Stephen W. Dorsey, being then
</p>
<p>still in the Senate, wrote asking that the service be made daily, it
</p>
<p>having been let at once a week. He asked that it be made three
</p>
<p>times a week and that it be given a fast schedule, and claimed that
</p>
<p>there was a mistake in the length of the route as advertised. On the
</p>
<p>22d of December, 1878, to which I have called your attention in another
</p>
<p>connection, Mr. John E. Miner, at the request of Stephen W. Dorsey,
</p>
<p>who indicates his interest in this route, writes to Mr. Joseph that John
</p>
<p>W. Dorsey was the contractor and wants Joseph to stock and run the
</p>
<p>route. Senator Dorsey and Joseph were acquaintances, if not friends.
</p>
<p>Joseph went on and stocked and commenced running the route without
</p>
<p>any formal contract. Early in January, 1879, Mr. Eerdell went out to
</p>
<p>^ew Mexico and saw Joseph and made a formal contract with him. In
</p>
<p>the following April Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey sent petitions to Joseph to
</p>
<p>be circulated to get expedition and get increase of pay, and giving him
</p>
<p>forms of them, and telling him that he had written to various people,
</p>
<p>and everything of that sort, and saying to Joseph that he guaranteed
</p>
<p>his pay for the service that he was performing prior to that time. Four
</p>
<p>days before the service commenced at all the route had been reduced,
</p>
<p>been cut off by the deduction of 116 miles at the east end of the route,
</p>
<p>and no service having been commenced whatever, the month's extra
</p>
<p>pay was allowed. That, I am bound to say, seems to have been in
</p>
<p>accordance with the practice of the department, though working some-
</p>
<p>what inequitably to the Government. Eighteen miles were taken off
</p>
<p>at the other end, and Dorsey's pay was reduced to $1,467.78. By
</p>
<p>the 23d of January, 1879, the route had been reduced to that point,
</p>
<p>the service was one trip a week, and the time, which was originally
</p>
<p>seven days, was reduced, as I recollect it, to between four and five. On

</p>
<p>the 24th of April, 1879, twenty miles were added, and the amount of pay
</p>
<p>was carried up correspondingly so as to become $1,658. That was the
</p>
<p>condition in which the route was by the 1st of May, 1879. Then two
</p>
<p>trips were added over the whole route at an expense of $3,316, and the
</p>
<p>time was reduced to fifty hours. Having been reduced to ninety hours
</p>
<p>by the cutting off of the route, it was further reduced to fifty hours,
</p>
<p>and by the expedition $8,457.84 was added. It remained in that con-
</p>
<p>dition until January 1, 1881, when the trips having been, as I said
</p>
<p>before, carried up to three, were carried up to seven, and $17,910.72
</p>
<p>were added, making the total pay from the Government on that route
</p>
<p>$31,343.76, where the original amount was only $2,745, and where, by
</p>
<p>deducting pro rata for the portions of the route which were taken oft',
</p>
<p>the amount would have been only $1,467.78. There had been taken off
</p>
<p>by these reductions 134 miles of its length, leaving it 134 miles long.
</p>
<p>The record of productiveness was this : The average receipts of all the
</p>
<p>post-offices upon that route in that year were $194.96. Of the amount
</p>
<p>which was allowed for expedition at a time when there were only three
</p>
<p>trips the subcontractor received $6.200 and the contractor and his asso-
</p>
<p>ciates got $7,200, the subcontractor bearing all the fines and deductions
</p>
<p>and the contractor getting his $7,200 net. Alter the route was carried
</p>
<p>up to 831, 000 the result was I speak with a little caution here; I am
</p>
<p>liable to make some slight errors, for though I am confident I am almost
</p>
<p>90
</p>
<p>absolutely correct on dates and figures, there is in connection with this
</p>
<p>route a peculiar slidiug-scale arrangement at one point, and, therefore,
</p>
<p>I am more likely to err here than elsewhere after it was so carried up
</p>
<p>the subcontractor at one time got $10,666 and the contractor got in
</p>
<p>round numbers $20,000. Mr. Joseph, the subcontractor, found he was
</p>
<p>running behindhand and that he could not perform his service for the
</p>
<p>money he was getting; so he wrote to the department protesting that he
</p>
<p>could not do the service for the price he was receiving, and suggesting that
</p>
<p>there ought to be some change in that respect. Thereupon Mr. Stephen W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey, in June, 1879, writes him a letter telling him not to write to the
</p>
<p>department, but to deal only with him (Dorsey). Joseph went on carry-
</p>
<p>ing the mail and was subjected to fines which substantially ate up his
</p>
<p>entire pay, so that he made nothing for doing the service. Then he was
</p>
<p>obliged to throw up the service,and these defendants, who had heen getting
</p>
<p>$20,000 net made a contract with one Jaramillo. Jaramillo went on
</p>
<p>for a considerable time performing the contract, and by and by he was
</p>
<p>so eaten up by fines and penalties in the endeavor to carry the mail in
</p>
<p>an impossible time that he was glad to get nothing for carrying the
</p>
<p>mail and to pay $500 to the defendants for being let off from the con-
</p>
<p>tract. This was the route on which I called your attentionto the fact
</p>
<p>that the postmasters repeatedly and constantly notified Mr. Brady that
</p>
<p>it was impossible to carry the. mail on the time required by him. When
</p>
<p>ho sent them schedules in blank on which they were to fix a time of
</p>
<p>departure and arrival from each end of the route and not to exceed the
</p>
<p>time named, they continually returned them with a schedule that was
</p>
<p>more than twice as long as he specified, and stating in express terms
</p>
<p>that they could not fix a shorter schedule, and that it was impossible to
</p>
<p>carry the mail in the time he named. Mr. Brady sent back schedule
</p>
<p>after schedule, insisting upon it that it should be made to correspond
</p>
<p>with his wishes, until finally one of the leading postmasters says
</p>
<p>that when he got those papers he used to throw them in the waste-
</p>
<p>basket. This is the route on which the contractor got $20,000, and
</p>
<p>Joseph, the subcontractor, $10,000, and when Joseph *wrote to Mr.
</p>
<p>Dorsey, saying there ought to be $12,000 allowed for carrying the

</p>
<p>mail, Mr. Dorsey wrote him back that he thought it nonsense; that
</p>
<p>it was perfectly absurd ; that it was not worth any such sum.
</p>
<p>In that connection, Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey, as I recollect, wrote
</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph that he must be particularly careful or he would be
</p>
<p>fined; while it made very little difference if Mr. Joseph was to get so
</p>
<p>far behind that the fines would eat up all his compensation, yet he
</p>
<p>must look out and not go to the point where it would be necessary to
</p>
<p>fall back upon the contractor's profit and apply the fines upon that.
</p>
<p>That was a thing that could not be endured under any circumstances.
</p>
<p>On that route the affidavit was made by John W. Dorsey, stating the
</p>
<p>necessity for an increase of men and animals, and saying that there
</p>
<p>would be 170 per cent, more men and animals needed. The petition,
</p>
<p>however, on which it was alleged to have been based was a petition for
</p>
<p>seven trips over only a small portion of the route, a little less than
</p>
<p>half; but the order was made for an increase on the whole route.
</p>
<p>Moreover, one of the orders made on that route was on a petition
</p>
<p>which represented that a railroad had been built down here [indicating
</p>
<p>on map], and that if they could have a mail put on across here [indi-
</p>
<p>cating], and then have that portion of the route expedited, that they
</p>
<p>would gain a great deal of time. Mr. Brady not only ordered
</p>
<p>that, with expedition over the whole route, but he expressly pro-
</p>
<p>vided that the order should take effect some six weeks before
</p>
<p>91
</p>
<p>it bore date, and, therefore, that the contractor should be allowed
</p>
<p>pay for six weeks before it bore date, though the law expressly
</p>
<p>sni'd that no order should be made which gave pay prior to the day
</p>
<p>of its making. They attempt to meet that by saying that there was a
</p>
<p>telegraphic order which preceded the final order about three weeks.
</p>
<p>But allowing the telegraphic order as the correct order of date for the
</p>
<p>expedition, they are still, nevertheless, three or four weeks away from
</p>
<p>the time. It is even then an antedated order, in absolute disregard
</p>
<p>of the statute. Then, again, the order was an order extending over the
</p>
<p>whole route, though the petition was for expedition on less than half of
</p>
<p>the route, and the telegraphic order applied to only half of the route.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAVIDGE. What route are you speaking of?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Eoute 38145, from Ojo Caliente to Parrott City. It was
</p>
<p>originally from Garland to Parrott City, and was cut down at each end
</p>
<p>so that it became from Ojo Caliente to Aniinas City. I mentioned the
</p>
<p>fact that one of these contractors, Jarainillo, paid $500 for being let off
</p>
<p>from his contract, besides having been fined all of his pay substantially.
</p>
<p>Of those fines which were imposed upon him, a considerable amount
</p>
<p>was remitted by Mr. Brady after Mr. Jaramillo had paid his $500 to be
</p>
<p>released, and that amount so remitted, these contractors placed in their
</p>
<p>pockets, and left Mr. Jaramillo entirely without any interest in it.
</p>
<p>The route from Saguache to Lake City is in the indictment, but I
</p>
<p>shall pass over it very briefly, because it need not be concealed from
</p>
<p>you, gentlemen, that a large portion, if not all of the money, that was
</p>
<p>derived from that route, passed into the pocket of a person not a defend-
</p>
<p>ant in this case. Therefore, so far as the actual fraud upon the United
</p>
<p>States is concerned, of which there was an abundance upon that route,
</p>
<p>and in the inception of which these defendants were engaged, inasmuch
</p>
<p>as the money did not go into their pockets, and inasmuch as there are
</p>
<p>so much stronger cases, I do not care to take your time, either now, or
</p>
<p>by the evidence to any great extent upon this route. It was ninety-five
</p>
<p>miles long, was let for thirty-six hours' time, and three times a week;
</p>
<p>Miner being the contractor at $3,426. There was, as I have stated, a
</p>
<p>very considerable fraud upon that route, but it is not such that I care

</p>
<p>to take any great amount of time with it. There is one feature in con-
</p>
<p>nection with it, and another route to which I will call your attention.
</p>
<p>It is route 38150. This route started from Saguache, and ran through
</p>
<p>Barnum to Lake City. There was another route starting from Garland
</p>
<p>and coming up to Lake City, and at that point going on to Barnum, and
</p>
<p>overlapping from Barnum to Lake City, some twenty-odd miles of this
</p>
<p>other route. At Barnum it turned west and went out to Los Pinos, a dis-
</p>
<p>tance of about fifty miles. For this distance over the route the service
</p>
<p>was identical. It was performed by the same .parties, and for a consid-
</p>
<p>erable period Mr. Brady paid the same parties twice for doing the single
</p>
<p>service. That money was not got back until after Mr. Brady had gone
</p>
<p>out of office, and the administration that succeeded him came into office.
</p>
<p>Then they compelled the subcontractor who had received that double
</p>
<p>pay to refund. [Illustrating on map.] This other route came up to Lake
</p>
<p>City and went on originally across the mountain to Onray. It was a
</p>
<p>very difficult route across the mountains, and certain portions of the
</p>
<p>year was undoubtedly practically impassable. It was almost across the
</p>
<p>back-bone of the continent, the mountains being some twelve or thir-
</p>
<p>teen thousand feet high. Therefore, af i er a time, that route which went
</p>
<p>across the mountain was changed so that it went over the other route,
</p>
<p>up to Barnum, making practically three routes for that distance; Lake
</p>
<p>City to Barnum, and then up to Los Pinos, making two routes for that
</p>
<p>92
</p>
<p>distance; ami then down to Ouray, going on three sides of a square,
</p>
<p>as shorter in time and better than the one side, because the one side was
</p>
<p>directly across the mountain. On that change we make no criticism ;
</p>
<p>but what I desire to call .your attention to is this : that not only was
</p>
<p>there the double service along that portion of the route from Barnum
</p>
<p>to Lake City and the double payment, but there was also the double
</p>
<p>payment from Barnum to Los Pinos, while there was only a single
</p>
<p>service, the mail being carried by the same man on the same wagon and
</p>
<p>with the same horses. When this change was made the postmasters
</p>
<p>assumed, of course, that there was no intention to have double pay, and
</p>
<p>they ceased to report one of these routes on their quarterly reports as
</p>
<p>existing. They were called to account after a time by the Second
</p>
<p>Assistant Postmaster-GeneraPs Office to know why they did not report
</p>
<p>both, and thereupon one of the postmasters, a very intelligent gentle-
</p>
<p>man, Dr. MacDouald, sat down and wrote Mr. Brady a long account of
</p>
<p>the whole thing, showing how the service was identical, how he con-
</p>
<p>sidered it was not possible that there could be any necessity for report-
</p>
<p>ing both routes, and how there could not be any propriety in paying
</p>
<p>for both. He was substantially told to mind his own business. The
</p>
<p>service went on, the Government paying for both of those routes for
</p>
<p>nearly two years after the remonstrance of Dr. MacDonald. and then, for
</p>
<p>some reason, as to which there is apparently no evidence, an order was
</p>
<p>made cutting off one of the routes, so that the contractor should get
</p>
<p>pay only upon one. All we can say as to the origin of that order is, as
</p>
<p>I recollect, that it was made about the time that public attention began
</p>
<p>to be directed to star-route matters, and not very far from the time
</p>
<p>when Mr. Brady had asked for an increase of appropriation, and there
</p>
<p>had been a Congressional investigation. It was, I think, somewhat
</p>
<p>later than that. It was not cut off until the summer of 1880, and the
</p>
<p>investigation took place in the preceding winter.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. The money was all received by Sanderson and re-
</p>
<p>couped.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. As to who received the money, and whether the success-
</p>
<p>ors of Mr. Brady recouped it, is entirely unimportant in connection

</p>
<p>with this case. However, the facts show the amount of service that
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady put on and persisted in, in spite of the remonstrance of those
</p>
<p>whom he ought to have relied upon, and continued for months and
</p>
<p>years of time.
</p>
<p>The route from Silverton to Parrott City, No. 38155, was let as sixty-
</p>
<p>nine miles long, and for service twice a week. The time was thirty-six
</p>
<p>hours and the amount paid $1,488. There was originally a subcontract
</p>
<p>placed on file in October, 1878, by which John W. Dorsey, who was the
</p>
<p>contractor, and received $1,488 from the Government, was to pay to
</p>
<p>the subcontractor $2,280, about $800 more than he got. That subcon-
</p>
<p>tract was made upon a printed blank, with the heading of Miner, Peck
</p>
<p>& Co. It was made by the firm of Miner, Peck & Co., or J. W. Dorsey
</p>
<p>& Co., I have forgotten which. On the 1st of October, 1879, Mr.
</p>
<p>Stephen W. Dorsey became the subcontractor on that route at the full
</p>
<p>amount. I have already mentioned to you that when any of these
</p>
<p>parties to the conspiracy became subcontractors they were always sub-
</p>
<p>contractors at the full amount, so as to leave the contractors with no
</p>
<p>interest on the record. On the 21st of January, 1880, Mr. Dorsey's
</p>
<p>subcontract was withdrawn, and a subcontract of a Mr. Steineger
</p>
<p>was put on record for $9,400. Before Mr. Steineger became a
</p>
<p>contractor the amount which the Government was to pay had been
</p>
<p>run up from $1,458 a year to $16,512.28 a year. There was upon
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>this route also a transaction of this kind, which took place as early as
</p>
<p>February, 1879. Ten miles were added to the route, which started from
</p>
<p>Silverton' and passed down to Parrott City. At about this poiut
</p>
<p>[indicating on map], there was a trail that ran across over here [indi-
</p>
<p>cating], cutting off an angle. It was an old trail not ordinarily trav-
</p>
<p>eled, and in point of fact the mail was always carried by way of Ani-
</p>
<p>mas City, which was a city of considerable size, and has now become
</p>
<p>one of the largest towns in Southern Colorado Durango. Animas
</p>
<p>City is on one side of the river and Durango is on the other. Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady had sent circular after circular, calling upon the postmasters to
</p>
<p>give him the distances between the post-offices. Those circulars had
</p>
<p>been returned to him, each one of them specifying that Animas City
</p>
<p>was on the route, and giving the distance. The mail had always gone
</p>
<p>that way. There had always been a postmaster at Animas City, and
</p>
<p>he had always opened the mail and taken out letters to Animas City.
</p>
<p>Yet, on the 16th of February, 1879, ten miles were added for going to
</p>
<p>Auimas City under the pretense that it added that distance because
</p>
<p>there was a possible trail over which not only had there never been any
</p>
<p>mail carried, but which Mr. Brady's own distance circular, sent him by
</p>
<p>his own postmasters, showed him was never traveled. Mr. Brady began
</p>
<p>by adding for this ten miles $215.65, and when it came to be multi-
</p>
<p>plied by the expedition which subsequently came, the result was,
</p>
<p>that the fictitious addition added $2,090 to the amount which Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady directed to be taken from the Treasury. On the 1st of July, 1879,
</p>
<p>five trips were added, and the time was reduced from thirty-seven hours
</p>
<p>to fifteen hours. The allowances for this addition of trips and reduc-
</p>
<p>tion of speed were fourteen thousand eight hundred and odd dollars,
</p>
<p>carrying the total up to $16,512.28. There were changes on that route
</p>
<p>at different times by which the Government finally paid out the reduced
</p>
<p>sum of $14,870. At the time when the Government was paying $16,500
</p>
<p>on this route the contractor got for doing nothing $11,500, and the sub-
</p>
<p>contractor got for carrying the mail $5,400 and paid all the fines and
</p>
<p>deductions. When the amount was reduced a little the subcontractor
</p>
<p>did better. He then got $9,400 and the contractor got only $7,100. As

</p>
<p>for the expedition for which this large sum of $10,500 was paid so far
</p>
<p>as getting the mail to a point to go beyond the terminal station at
</p>
<p>either end is concerned, it gained no time. The expedition from thirty-
</p>
<p>five hours to fifteen hours did gain time for the little way stations ; but
</p>
<p>as to the forwarding of the mail from Auimas City, which was on the
</p>
<p>railroad this way, or Silverton, at the other end, nothing was gained
</p>
<p>because the mail laid over night at both places. The result was,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, that while the original time was thirty-six hours and the
</p>
<p>expedited time was fifteen hours, after the expedition took place, a
</p>
<p>letter required thirty hours to go over the entire route. The ex-
</p>
<p>pedited time was lost by the stoppage and failure at Duraugo
</p>
<p>and Silverton. On the llth of November, 1880, all the postmasters
</p>
<p>united in recommending that the time be made at least twenty-four
</p>
<p>hours and in this all the citizens of Silverton joined. Silvertou was
</p>
<p>the chief place upon the route and one of the liveliest towns in Colo-
</p>
<p>rado, as I am informed. That petition was transmitted by one of the
</p>
<p>Senators from Colorado, with a strong letter recommending that it be
</p>
<p>granted. Though you will hear, in the history of this case, that a Sena-
</p>
<p>tor was apparently all-powerful whenever there was an increase to be
</p>
<p>made and money to be taken from the Treasury, and though you will
</p>
<p>find at least one order, if not two, taking an amount of money out of
</p>
<p>the Treasury, made avowedly in part because it was requested by this
</p>
<p>94
</p>
<p>very Senator, yet when that Senator, acting upon the petition of all the
</p>
<p>leading people in the chief place upon this route, recommended that the
</p>
<p>increased speed be dispensed with, his recommendation amounted to
</p>
<p>nothing, and Mr. Brady went out of office leaving this increased speed
</p>
<p>and this increased compensation for the benefit, not of the people of the
</p>
<p>locality, but for the benefit of these contractors.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. Will you be kind enough to tell the jury what case that
</p>
<p>was? s
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. That is Silverton to Parrott City.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. In this matter which you have just spoken about, be
</p>
<p>kind enough to tell the jury what case you refer to.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. It is on the Silverton and Parrott City route, as I under-
</p>
<p>stand it. That is my recollection of it. If I am incorrect about that, I
</p>
<p>will be glad to be corrected. That route is No. 38156. The Senator is
</p>
<p>Senator Hill, of Colorado. I do not think I am wrong as to the route,
</p>
<p>but at any rate, if I am wrong as to the route, I simply say that as to
</p>
<p>one of the routes in Colorado that transaction occurred. I do not think
</p>
<p>I am wrong as to the route.
</p>
<p>I may say to you, perhaps this may be a convenient occasion to say,
</p>
<p>that the post-office routes are all numbered by a given thousand. For
</p>
<p>instance, you will find all routes beginning with 38000 were in the State
</p>
<p>of Colorado, each State having a thousand appropriated to it in that
</p>
<p>way, Oregon's being, I think, 44000, and California's 46000.
</p>
<p>Now, on the route 38140, which is from Trinidad to Madison, in South-
</p>
<p>ern Colorado, Trinidad is here [illustrating on map]. The route as
</p>
<p>originally run was from Trinidad over here to Barela, from Barela to a
</p>
<p>place called Grinnell, and then down to Madison, which is on a river in
</p>
<p>New Mexico the Cimarron . That route was let as forty-five miles long ;
</p>
<p>one trip was to be made a week; John E. Miner was the contractor, at
</p>
<p>thirteen hours. Before the service was commenced, instead of being
</p>
<p>allowed to run across from there to there [indicating on map], the route
</p>
<p>was bent around so as to go out here to Eaton, and then come around
</p>
<p>there. The result was that, in consequence of that addition, the
</p>
<p>original thirteen hours of time was extended to nineteen and three-

</p>
<p>quarter hours, I think. Now, Eaton was put on there under these
</p>
<p>circumstances. Here is a river valley going down there [indicating
</p>
<p>on map]. There was mail service out here to a place called Pulaski,
</p>
<p>and I think also to Greenwood. At any rate Eaton was situated in
</p>
<p>that same valley, and was within eight or ten miles of mail service.
</p>
<p>The people petitioned to have mail service from this direction [indi-
</p>
<p>cating on map], coming down to Eaton as meeting all their convenience,
</p>
<p>and that also, if I remember, was recommended by a United States
</p>
<p>Senator. Instead of getting that service, which could have been put
</p>
<p>on at the rate of two or three hundred dollars a year, this route here
</p>
<p>was bent around. There was added to it some 23 miles of distance 5 the
</p>
<p>time was extended 6 hours, so as to carry it up from 13 hours to 19 J
</p>
<p>hours. Instead of two or three hundred dollars, which could have been
</p>
<p>paid for that, you will see directly how the Government was made to
</p>
<p>sutler by this twisting around, not in accordance with the petition pre-
</p>
<p>sented and not in accordance with the convenience of the people.
</p>
<p>Before I follow up the money matter, going a little into the history of
</p>
<p>the route, we find this condition of things: Mr. Miner was the original
</p>
<p>contractor; he wants all letters sent to lock-box 706; the original address
</p>
<p>was lock-box 714; when sent to lock-box 714 they were to be addressed
</p>
<p>to the care of M. C. Eerdell. On the 7th of December, 1880, a subcon-
</p>
<p>tract of S. W. Dorsey's, which had been tiled on the llth of November,
</p>
<p>95
</p>
<p>1879, and was dated on the 1st of April, 1879, was withdrawn. That
</p>
<p>was on the 7th of December, 1880, though on the preceding 3d of April
</p>
<p>Rerdell had directed that all communications should be sent to him.
</p>
<p>On the 4th of June, 1881, Mr. Rerdell writes to one of the subcon-
</p>
<p>tractors out there referring 1 to the delays and difficulties "we are
</p>
<p>under in consequence of a change in the administration," and over-
</p>
<p>hauling the post-office officials. Mr. Brady had gone out of office a
</p>
<p>month previously. However, Mr. Rerdell had good trust. He
</p>
<p>assured him that u this investigation now being made by the Post-
</p>
<p>Office Department will come to nothing; it is simply a repetition
</p>
<p>of that which was made by Congress a year ago." I think, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, I shall not be drawing too largely upon you when 1 ask you to
</p>
<p>draw the inference at least that Mr. Rerdell has since changed his
</p>
<p>mind about this investigation. He thinks it a little different from the
</p>
<p>investigation that Congress was making "a year ago." Mr. Rerdell r
</p>
<p>however, at that time felt so confident that when by and by the new
</p>
<p>administration cut off some portion of the expedition he notified the
</p>
<p>subcontractor that he must continue to carry the mail on the old rate of
</p>
<p>speed, for "we are going to contest in the courts the legality of their
</p>
<p>expedition." They did not voluntarily go to work to make that contest
</p>
<p>of legality, but we are in a certain form giving them that opportunity.
</p>
<p>This distance that was added for Raton that I have spoken of was put
</p>
<p>in as if 28 miles had been added. We shall show you in detail
</p>
<p>that in fact it added only 23 miles; that the evidence was in the
</p>
<p>department distinctly to show that it added only 23. But they re-
</p>
<p>cited that it added 28 miles and paid on the basis of an addition of
</p>
<p>28 miles; and moreover they paid for carrying that mail by Raton
</p>
<p>from the 1st of July, 1878, though in point of fact no mail was ever
</p>
<p>carried over that route until the- 17th of January, 1879. Six months
</p>
<p>and seventeen days did they pay for carrying the mail over that
</p>
<p>route, so wrenched around as to add 28 miles to the distance, before
</p>
<p>any mail was carried there. But finally they had got it to suit them-
</p>
<p>selves, and on the 1st of May, 1879, there were added two trips, and
</p>
<p>then Mr. Brady put the thing back to where it was before he wrenched

</p>
<p>it around and added on Raton. The original schedule time having been
</p>
<p>thirteen hoars, which, by the addition of Raton, he extended to nine-
</p>
<p>teen hours, he now, on the first of May, 1879, reduced the speed to
</p>
<p>twelve hours, so that over that route the mail matter was carried in
</p>
<p>twelve hours instead of thirteen hours that the original schedule re-
</p>
<p>quired. But under the original schedule the Government was to pay
</p>
<p>$338. Under the schedule with the decreased time the Government
</p>
<p>was made by Mr. Brady to pay $4,290.30 for carrying the mail over
</p>
<p>the same route. He could have supplied Raton at not exceeding $300.
</p>
<p>He chose to supply it in this way, and the result was to get that route
</p>
<p>to the same time before he put Raton on with the introduction of the two
</p>
<p>extra trips, and he carried the expense to the Government up from $338
</p>
<p>to $4,290.30. Of that amount of $4,290.30 the contractor who was car-
</p>
<p>rying the mail received $1,550, and Dorsey & Company, for not doing
</p>
<p>anything, received $2,402.30. The expedition- was obtained upon the
</p>
<p>affidavit of John W. Dorsey, sworn to on the 26th of April, 1879. The
</p>
<p>order was made five days later, on the 1st of May. Dorsey swore
</p>
<p>that to carry the mail in nineteen and three fourth hours three times a
</p>
<p>week took one man and four animals, and to carry it in twelve hours
</p>
<p>would take three men and eleven animals. In point of fact the man
</p>
<p>who carried the mail says that it took, to carry it in twelve hoars, three
</p>
<p>trips a week on the expedited schedule, two men and six horses, and three
</p>
<p>96
</p>
<p>of those were horses that he kept in reserve in case those in actual use
</p>
<p>broke down. So, two men and six horses were actually used, making a
</p>
<p>factor of eight, while John W. Dorsey swore that three men and eleven
</p>
<p>horses were needed, making a factor of fourteen, and I need not remind
</p>
<p>you how large a difference that would make in the amount taken from
</p>
<p>the Treasury under the rule of expedition applied to it.
</p>
<p>The route from Pueblo to Eosita, No. 38134, was advertised as forty-
</p>
<p>nine miles long. It was let to John E. Miner at $388. The time was fifteen
</p>
<p>hours, and there was to be one trip a week. The subcontractor was first
</p>
<p>to pay $700, while getting from the Government only $388 I think. In
</p>
<p>July, 1879, five trips were added, and for that $2,328 was added. Then the
</p>
<p>time was reduced to ten hours from fifteen, and $5,432 was added. So
</p>
<p>that a route commencing at $388 was carried up to $8,148. The annual
</p>
<p>income of all the offices on that route was $1,464. On the 22d of October,
</p>
<p>1879, there was filed the subcontract of one Hanson, by which he got $3,100.
</p>
<p>Mind you, that was on file, and that left to the contractor net $o,048
</p>
<p>for doing nothing. But the subcontractor Hanson had so good a thing
</p>
<p>of it in carrying the mail at $3,100 and paying all fines and deductions
</p>
<p>that he turned around and found a responsible contractor who carried
</p>
<p>the mail for him for $2,600. So that while the Government was paying
</p>
<p>$8,148, under Brady's orders for carrying the mail, the man who was
</p>
<p>actually doing it was getting only $2,600.
</p>
<p>Now that route from Pueblo to Eosita starts from Pueblo here
</p>
<p>[indicating on map] and comes down here to Eosita ; the only inter-
</p>
<p>mediate post-office was at Greenwood here [indicating]. Here was a
</p>
<p>railroad running out here [indicating]. Greenwood gets its principal
</p>
<p>mail quicker by getting it from another mail route here, that being-
</p>
<p>rail and this a stage route [indicating on map]. The result was that
</p>
<p>practically that route was only intended to supply Eosita and places
</p>
<p>beyond it. And yet the mail came to Eosita by coming out here down
</p>
<p>this way, that being all rail, quicker than it could from Pueblo. So
</p>
<p>that, in point of fact, there was really no ground for the existence of this
</p>
<p>route at all [indicating]. The intermediate station got its mail quite
</p>
<p>as well from Florence, running out by the railroad quicker than down

</p>
<p>there, and substantially no mail ever came to Eosita over that route.
</p>
<p>All the mail matter that came from east of Eosita was put into the mail
</p>
<p>bags on the cars and passed out here and came down here [indicating
</p>
<p>on map]. It was not transferred at Pueblo at all. The only mail that
</p>
<p>came from Pueblo to Eosita was practically such local matter as got
</p>
<p>into the mail at a time after the mail going this way [indicating] had
</p>
<p>closed and before another mail going the same way was about to start.
</p>
<p>There were a few hours in the day when mail matter going to Eosita
</p>
<p>was put into the bag to go over this route. That was all there was on
</p>
<p>that route which was run up to $8,148. There was a certain time when
</p>
<p>for a little while there was a post-office called Wetmore on the route, but
</p>
<p>it was a trivial thing, and, as I recollect, it was discontinued. The pro-
</p>
<p>ductiveness on that route, leaving out Pueblo, was something less than
</p>
<p>a hundred dollars a year.
</p>
<p>As to that route, Mr. Brady had been notified as early as the 30th of
</p>
<p>August, 1878, long before he made any of his orders, by one of the post-
</p>
<p>masters, that tri- weekly service was not needed. In the face of that
</p>
<p>he went on and ordered six times a week's service. Again, on the 8th
</p>
<p>of May, 1880, he was notified by the postmasters that the service was
</p>
<p>not needed. That notice was given after he had made his order in-
</p>
<p>creasing it, but he did not pay any attention to the notice of the post-
</p>
<p>masters. He left that service, which the postmasters certified to him
</p>
<p>97
</p>
<p>was not needed, in force until his successors came into office, when one
</p>
<p>of their first acts was to cut it off.
</p>
<p>The affidavit for increase on that route was made by John W. Dorsey,
</p>
<p>who had no honest connection with the route no connection other than
</p>
<p>being a co-conspirator with the others. John E. Miner was the con-
</p>
<p>tractor. Eli Hanson was the subcontractor by a contract on file. Yet
</p>
<p>Brady took the affidavit of John W. Dorsey, swearing that he was the
</p>
<p>subcontractor. Dorsey swore that to carry the mail 7 times a week on
</p>
<p>a 15-hour schedule took 2 men and 6 animals, making 8, and on a 10-
</p>
<p>hour schedule 6 men and 18 animals, making 24. The man who car-
</p>
<p>ried the mails says he never ran 7 times a week on 15 hours. His esti-
</p>
<p>mate is that for 7 times a week and 15 hours it would take 7 men and
</p>
<p>12 animals, though Dorsey, when his object was to make it as little as
</p>
<p>possible, swore that it would take only 2 men and 6 animals, making
</p>
<p>an aggregate of 8 against what the contractor says would have been 19.
</p>
<p>Then the carrier says the amount as likely to be needed for the increased
</p>
<p>speed was probably about correctly stated by Mr. Dorsey. It is a little
</p>
<p>difficult on that route to get at those figures precisely, owing to the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstance that at one time it became an important passenger route.
</p>
<p>The mail was carried upon four-horse coaches, and it is impossible,
</p>
<p>therefore, to say with any accuracy how many men and horses were
</p>
<p>needed to carry the mail when they were also carrying a large number
</p>
<p>of passengers and a large quantity of express matter. Therefore, as to
</p>
<p>the discrepancy between the affidavit and the fact, it is a little less cer-
</p>
<p>tain, perhaps, than as to some of the others as to which I called your
</p>
<p>attention, or shall call your attention.
</p>
<p>Route 40113, from Tres Alamos by way of Clifton, in Arizona,
</p>
<p>was let to John W. Dorsey as 197 miles long, the trips to be made
</p>
<p>once a week. Eighty-four hours were allowed for doing it, being a
</p>
<p>little over two miles an hour. The contract price was $1,568. You
</p>
<p>will find that as we go along through large portions of this correspond-
</p>
<p>ence in connection with these routes, KerdelPs hand and Kerdell's brain
</p>
<p>were being used, and being used in a subordinate capacity, while he
</p>
<p>was representing the other men, Dorsey and others, who were putting

</p>
<p>in their pockets the profits of the transaction and giving to Berdell a
</p>
<p>portion of them which we are unable to define. On the 10th of May,
</p>
<p>1879, Kerdell, writing in the name of John W. Dorsey, transmitted pe-
</p>
<p>titions to the West to have them circulated for increase of trips and
</p>
<p>speed, and in less than a month after, on the 2d of June, 1879, two trips
</p>
<p>were added and $3,136 was allowed for them, and the time was reduced
</p>
<p>from eighty- four hours to forty hours, and an allowance made for that
</p>
<p>of $9,408, thereby carrying up the original pay of $1,568 to $14,112.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey's subcontract was filed on that route in Oc-
</p>
<p>tober, 1879, and withdrawn in January, 1881. On the 2d of February,
</p>
<p>1881, by one of the last orders, which fortunately for The Government
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady was able to make, in about the last month of his official
</p>
<p>time, he added four trips and allowed therefor $15,950.62. So that the
</p>
<p>aggregate expense of that route which originally cost $1,568 was car-
</p>
<p>ried up to $27,913.59, and that too after owing to a striking off of a
</p>
<p>portion of the route there had been a deduction of $2,149. What cost
</p>
<p>originally $1,568, as awarded by public, open bidding was, by Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady's orders, under the pretense of expedition and increase out in
</p>
<p>that desert region in Arizona, the character of which we shall show
</p>
<p>you by witnesses from the spot, carried up to nearly $28,000 a year.
</p>
<p>Turning for the moment to Oregon, let us take route 44140, which is
</p>
<p>the. route from Eugene City to Bridge Creek. That was let as 207
</p>
<p>98
</p>
<p>miles long on a schedule of 130 hours once a week. John M. Peck was
</p>
<p>the contractor at $2,468. He first made a subcontract with a man
</p>
<p>named Wycoif, by which he was to pay him $2,700 for that service for
</p>
<p>which he, Peck, was getting from The Government only $2,468. But
</p>
<p>that subcontract looked to the idea of an increase first of three trips r
</p>
<p>and then to six or seven trips, and provided for all the contingencies as
</p>
<p>to how much should be allowed with reference to each possible increase.
</p>
<p>Kerdell and box 706 turned up as the proper address for the papers
</p>
<p>connected with that contract ; and in that route we shall be able to
</p>
<p>show you, I think, that Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey took great interest; that
</p>
<p>he sent petitions there to be prepared; that he sent agents there to
</p>
<p>work up public opinion; and that he was generally engaged in the be-
</p>
<p>nevolent business of taking money out of the Treasury.
</p>
<p>As early as the 26th of June, 1879, less than a year after the contract
</p>
<p>term commenced, and a good deal less than a year after service was
</p>
<p>commenced, as I recollect it, two trips were added, and the time was
</p>
<p>reduced from 121 hours to 50 hours, the result of which was, that a
</p>
<p>route which was let at $2,468 was run up to $21,460.89. But while,
</p>
<p>under the original contracts, Mr. Peck was paying $232 more than he
</p>
<p>got, he was now getting, under the expedited contract, $14,060.89 more
</p>
<p>than he paid out himself, receiving that sum net, and giving to the
</p>
<p>subcontractor $7,400 for performing the service, and the subcontractor
</p>
<p>bearing the fines and penalties. After that came a series of petitions
</p>
<p>from that route, and, as to those petitions, there is this fact, to which I
</p>
<p>desire to call your attention. I mentioned to you that when Kerdell
</p>
<p>came to Mr. MacYeagh and to Mr. James, and, under the effect of fear
</p>
<p>or a quickened conscience, undertook to tell the whole story, so far as
</p>
<p>he was concerned, and endeavored to procure protection for himself and
</p>
<p>his patron, Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey, he produced a letter-book containing
</p>
<p>the press copies of letters, some of which were written by him, and
</p>
<p>some of which purported to be written by, and were stated by him
</p>
<p>to be written by, Stephen W. Dorsey. Those letters, gentlemen, re-
</p>
<p>lated to this route. They were letters written to an old acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance in Arkansas, who had moved to Oregon, and were letters em-

<p>ploying' him at a salary to go to work to get up petitions, and the
</p>
<p>forms of petitions were inclosed to him, and directions given to him as
</p>
<p>to everything that he was to do in the way of working up public opinion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey *s relations to this gentleman were such that he addressed
</p>
<p>him as "My Dear Frank," and he went on and did his work faithfully
</p>
<p>He is directed to get up letters. He is directed to see that there are a
</p>
<p>proper number of Democrats : " Write to the Democratic Senators " ; and
</p>
<p>he is to see to getting articles in the newspapers, and, generally, he is
</p>
<p>to work this thing up ingeniously and pervasively; and he did it.
</p>
<p>I think Dorsey all this time was in the United States Senate ; that it
</p>
<p>was not after Dorsey went out of the Senate. Wilcox transmitted
</p>
<p>these letters, so far as he got them, to Mr. Dorsey, and Mr. Dorsey
</p>
<p>sent them to the Postmaster-General, never pretending in any man-
</p>
<p>ner that he had any possible relations to anybody connected with these
</p>
<p>routes ; but he, as a public official in the United States Senate, had
</p>
<p>received these letters from people out there, who, under the stress
</p>
<p>of their own needs and the necessity of having more mail service, had,
</p>
<p>among others, written to him, perhaps, as chairman of the Committee
</p>
<p>on Post-Offices, and he transmitted them to the Second Assistant Post-
</p>
<p>master-General, and the Second Assistant Postmaster-General continued
</p>
<p>the benevolence by promptly proceeding to make orders upon them.
</p>
<p>The total revenue of the route, the expense of which was carried up to
</p>
<p>99
</p>
<p>$21,460.89, was $639.82. That route is in Oregon and runs east and
</p>
<p>west through an unsettled country for forty miles. It is literally true
</p>
<p>that there is not and never has been a soul residing there. For seventy
</p>
<p>miles it is literally true there was not even a road. One village through
</p>
<p>which it passes has six houses, another two, another fourteen, and an-
</p>
<p>other four. It so happens that on one day we can show you the amount
</p>
<p>of mail matter that passed over that route. It consisted of one letter,
</p>
<p>one postal card, and one mail bill, which was a government record show-
</p>
<p>ing what was in the bag. That route was not a through route. It was
</p>
<p>a local route, and that was the way in which Mr. Brady treated it and
</p>
<p>the way in which he had "due regard to productiveness."
</p>
<p>Koute 44160, also in Oregon, from Canyon City to Fort McDermott,
</p>
<p>runs north and south. I am not sure whether it connects with the Union
</p>
<p>Pacific Railroad or not, but I think so. That was let as 243 miles long.
</p>
<p>The time allowed was 130 hours. Peck was the contractor at $2,888.
</p>
<p>The service was to have commenced on that route on the 1st of July,
</p>
<p>1878. In point of fact it did not commence until long after that time.
</p>
<p>The postmaster at the only intermediate post-office, Camp Harney,
</p>
<p>reported that the mail commenced first on the 9th of December,
</p>
<p>1878. The postmaster at Fort McDermott reports that it began on the
</p>
<p>4th of January. On the 23d of December, twelve days before the serv-
</p>
<p>ice had actually begun bearing in mind the distance of Oregon from
</p>
<p>here before any knowledge of that service on any portion of the route
</p>
<p>could have been received here, Mr. Brady made an order for the addi-
</p>
<p>tion of two trips, and reduced the time from 130 hours to 96 hours,
</p>
<p>when there never had been a mail over the route, and allowed on that
</p>
<p>route, where the original pay was $2,888, from, the Treasury of the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment $21,500. He did this before a pound of mail had been carried
</p>
<p>by these contractors over that route. Of the sum which he so allowed
</p>
<p>$10,000 went to the contractors who were carrying the mail, and $11,500
</p>
<p>went into the pockets of the parties here, or some of the parties here.
</p>
<p>On the 1st of August, 1880, four more trips were added, and the
</p>
<p>result was that a route which had cost originally on the public bid-
</p>
<p>ding $2,888 was run up to $50,166.66, of which the subcontractor got

</p>
<p>only $20,000 or $21,000. Where the other $30,000 went other than
</p>
<p>the pocket of Yaile. he being the contractor of record, and some of
</p>
<p>his associates, we cannot say, unless you count Thomas J. Brady in as
</p>
<p>one of those associates. The net revenue of that entire route was
</p>
<p>$114.50. Not a pound of through mail went over the route. There
</p>
<p>was but one way post-office on the route. The letters and papers,
</p>
<p>all told, would not average three pounds a day. Sometimes they did
</p>
<p>not exceed half a pound, and save at Fort Harney, the single station
</p>
<p>I pointed out to you, there was not over all the balance of the 243
</p>
<p>miles a hut or a cabin. As late as September or October, 1878, the
</p>
<p>officers at Fort Harney wrote Mr. Brady saying that they could not
</p>
<p>get any mail matter; that passengers arrived there, that packages
</p>
<p>came there, but they could not get their mail. You will see, I think,
</p>
<p>in the course of time, that there will be some attempt to say that In-
</p>
<p>dians were interfering with it. These officers say that passengers could
</p>
<p>come easily and mails could come easily, and that they sent their mes-
</p>
<p>sengers regularly to Canyon City. They said, ''Won't 3^011 make some
</p>
<p>arrangement by which we can send up there and get our mail ourselves,
</p>
<p>or do something of that kind, if you will not have the contractor bring
</p>
<p>us our mail?" That letter got on to the files of the Post-Office Depart-
</p>
<p>ment and was put into the jacket which I described to you as one of
</p>
<p>these envelopes on the back of which Mr. Brady makes orders for expe-
</p>
<p>100
</p>
<p>iiition and increase of trips. That letter was used as one of the vouchers
</p>
<p>upon which Mr. Brady made an increase of trips and speed. The coin-
</p>
<p>plaint of these officers, that they could not get the existing mail though
</p>
<p>passengers and baggage could come there, is made one of the vouchers
</p>
<p>on which Brady proceeds to order more mail and more trips and to pay
</p>
<p>more money. He expedites and increases the number of trips on a route
</p>
<p>which, so far as the people at Fort Harney were concerned, never ran
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Upon that route the petition business was used, and in connection with
</p>
<p>it is rather a peculiar development I think I mentioned it to you. In one
</p>
<p>of these petitions the written matter comes down to within four lines of the
</p>
<p>bottom of a sheet of foolscap; then there are, I think, four names signed
</p>
<p>there. The petition it self is, as we think, in a disguised handwriting, which
</p>
<p>we think we shall satisfy you is that of John E. Miner. The first name
</p>
<p>purporting to be signed to that petition is that of a postmaster at Canon
</p>
<p>City, who will tell you that his name there is a forgery ; that he never
</p>
<p>saw it, and never would have put it there if he had seen it. The ques-
</p>
<p>tion who put his name there is a matter that we are going to take some
</p>
<p>trouble to prove to you. I believe we shall show that it was put there
</p>
<p>by John K. Miner. There are three other names on that piece of paper.
</p>
<p>There is in that region a man named M. D. Elfresh, or some such name
</p>
<p>as that. There is signed to the paper the name of D. M. Elfresh. No
</p>
<p>such man is known in that region, or along that route. The other two
</p>
<p>names are, as I understand it, equally unknown along the route. Now,
</p>
<p>having reached the bottom of the paper, you find pasted on to it three
</p>
<p>or four sheets full of names. There are fifty or sixty names, apparently
</p>
<p>signed by different people, and all having the ajjpearance of genuine-
</p>
<p>ness; and yet we shall show to you that those names on that paper,
</p>
<p>pasted on, are not the names of persons who live in or who ever saw
</p>
<p>Oregon, but they are all the names of people I will not speak as to
</p>
<p>all, but they are scattered through in such a way as to indicate that
</p>
<p>they are all the names of people who live away down in Southern Utah,
</p>
<p>hundreds of miles further east and more than a thousand miles further
</p>
<p>south than the starting-point of this route. They are people who never

</p>
<p>saw the route, never had anything to do with it, and who did not sign
</p>
<p>any such petition. They are people who signed some other petition
</p>
<p>for increase of some route in Utah, or something of that sort, and the
</p>
<p>names have been detached, as we shall ask you to believe from the
</p>
<p>evidence, from the proper petition and pasted on to this one with these
</p>
<p>three or four forged names upon it. This petition has been used by Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady as one of the pretended vouchers under which he ran up this
</p>
<p>route from about $2,880 a year to $50,166 a year.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. Will you say that that petition does not state that the
</p>
<p>signers are citizens living along the route?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I will give you the benefit of that. The petition does not
</p>
<p>state they are citizens of Oregon. It does not state that they live on
</p>
<p>that route, and, unlike some of the other lying petitions that were used,
</p>
<p>it does not state that they get their mail matter over the route. But
</p>
<p>what business had Mr. Brady to use as a voucher for taking $49,000 a
</p>
<p>year, or any sum, out of the Treasury of the United States, a petition
</p>
<p>signed by persons who did not live within thousands of miles of a route
</p>
<p>which produced only about $150 a year? And what business had your
</p>
<p>client, John li. Miner, to forge that petition, as forge it he did, when he
</p>
<p>transferred that sheet of names from the place where the signers put
</p>
<p>them, to the other heading.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. Now, will you Dot be frank ^ndugii:co;teU-tojfckq jury that
</p>
<p>that petition '/ ^ ;,,;;' '. > / % J /.;^
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. [Interposing.] ,1 will give you gentlemen a chance to tell
</p>
<p>the jury anything you want to. I say that was one of the vouchers on
</p>
<p>which Mr. Brady acted. I do not say it was the only voucher on which
</p>
<p>he acted.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. It was put on file after he made the order.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLB. You want to tell the whole truth, do you not ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I think I shall state it truly. -It was not on file when
</p>
<p>some of the orders were made. It was on tile before others of them
</p>
<p>were made, if I am not incorrect in my recollection. The evidence will
</p>
<p>show. I think it was on file, but even if it was not it does not help
</p>
<p>Judge Henkle's client any. If he put an unnecessary forgery on the
</p>
<p>files of "the Post-Office Department did he do it because he was in the
</p>
<p>daily habit of so doing, or why? He put it there for some reason. It
</p>
<p>may have been intended as an ex post facto voucher. I do not care what
</p>
<p>it was. It was a square, bold, bare-faced forgery either to get money
</p>
<p>out of the Treasury or to back up the act of Thomas J. ISrady in having
</p>
<p>already ordered money to be taken out of the Treasury. Twenty-eight
</p>
<p>thousand six hundred and sixty-six dollars of that $50,000 was ordered
</p>
<p>to be paid out after the petition was filed. That is the route, gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the jury, in which we have the transaction with the postmaster at
</p>
<p>Alvord. Mr. Miner wrote to his agent out there, Mr. Williamson, "I
</p>
<p>find that Mr. S. H. Abbott, postmaster at Alvord, is writing here,
</p>
<p>saying you do not need any weekly mail. Go and buy him up. Shut
</p>
<p>him up. Get rid of him. We cannot afford this sort of thing." That
</p>
<p>is the meaning of the letter, as we shall ask you to infer. John E. Miner
</p>
<p>knew that Mr. Abbott was writing to the department. John R. Miner
</p>
<p>had so written to Mr. Williamson. That letter, when we came to make
</p>
<p>an investigation after Mr. Brady had gone out of office, had disappeared
</p>
<p>from the files of the department, and there is no evidence on file there
</p>
<p>that it ever existed. We have only the word of John R. Miner that it
</p>
<p>ever did exist there. But this is one of the rare cases when we shall
</p>
<p>ask you to take the word of Mr. Miner. Mr. Williamson was told to go
</p>
<p>and shut the mouth of that man by paying him, and Mr. Williamson

</p>
<p>performed that duty, paid the money, and took a voucher for his pay-
</p>
<p>ment. We shall have the pleasure of showing to you something about
</p>
<p>that.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. That will be explained.
</p>
<p>Mr. MERRICK. You cannot explain it.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. You cannot explain it. You bought the man off once for
</p>
<p>complaining of you because you had not run the mail, and he had at
</p>
<p>least to have a mail in which to put his quarterly report. He had to
</p>
<p>travel way up to Canon City to get his quarterly report in the mail, and
</p>
<p>he complained to the department that it was pretty bad to have no
</p>
<p>mail but still worse to have to travel twenty-five or thirty miles at his
</p>
<p>own expense to put his quarterly report in the mail, and so they paid
</p>
<p>him for his expenses in doing that thing. It was that transaction that
</p>
<p>encouraged them to think they could go to work on the other one. They
</p>
<p>did it and carried it out faithfully. That was one of the cases where
</p>
<p>they paid right up.
</p>
<p>Route 44155, from The Dalles to Baker City, was let as 275 miles on
</p>
<p>a schedule of 120 hours, or five days, and two trips a week. John M.
</p>
<p>Peck was the contractor, and he was to get from the Government $8,288.
</p>
<p>Lock-box 714 was to be used as in the other cases. Service was not
</p>
<p>begun until the 2d of September, 1878, though the contract required
</p>
<p>102
</p>
<p>them to eoi>;i'U4}C'3 or- the 1st of July, 1878. Indian difficulties 011 a
</p>
<p>portion of Hie vcute it is claimed existed. The service having been com-
</p>
<p>menced on the 2d of September, 1878, on v the 1st of October Mr. Vaile
</p>
<p>put his subcontract on file, and before the month of October had run
</p>
<p>out petitions began to come in, and in less than two months after the
</p>
<p>service was commenced it was increased by adding one trip and the time
</p>
<p>was reduced from 120 hours, or five days, to seventy-two hours, or three
</p>
<p>days. The result was that the pay was run up from $8,288 to $31,080.
</p>
<p>On that route there was a little liberality in the sense that Brady's
</p>
<p>allowance was less than pro rata. If you believe the oath of the con-
</p>
<p>tractor, then Mr. Brady allowed less than pro rata, and instead of car-
</p>
<p>rying up the route $31,080, as he did, adding the expedited pay to the
</p>
<p>original pay, he could, under the oath, have carried it up to some sixty
</p>
<p>odd thousand dollars, I think. That, however, was a little oversight,
</p>
<p>and it was, as I recollect, corrected, for at a later period in the progress
</p>
<p>of the contract it was carried up> if I am right, to $72,520. Later than
</p>
<p>that there came off $10,360 for the reduction of a single trip. The fact
</p>
<p>is, that in the spring of 1880 Mr. Brady directed one trip to be taken
</p>
<p>off from all the star routes in the country which were over one trip
</p>
<p>a week, and these contractors sent out a circular calling attention
</p>
<p>to it and saying that Congress having failed to make the extra ap-
</p>
<p>propriation asked, Mr. Brady, for the purpose of bringing the expend-
</p>
<p>itures for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June within the amount of the
</p>
<p>appropriation, was compelled to cut off one trip all around. "We give
</p>
<p>you this notice, and we advise you to write to your member of Congress
</p>
<p>and others." Brady estimated for $2,000,000 for the expense of the star-
</p>
<p>route service for that year. Congress gave him every dollar he esti-
</p>
<p>mated for, and yet he found himself obliged to go to Congress in the
</p>
<p>December following the summer of his estimate and ask for $2,000,000
</p>
<p>more, and when Congress hesitated to do it, and set on foot an investi-
</p>
<p>gation which seems to me to have gone just up to the verge of discover-
</p>
<p>ing these frauds and then to have stopped, Mr. Brady ordered one trip
</p>
<p>a week cut off from all the star-route service of the country. These
</p>
<p>contractors accompanied that notice with the intimation to everybody

</p>
<p>concerned in transporting the mail that they should bring pressure to
</p>
<p>bear upon their Congressmen to make the appropriation and restore the
</p>
<p>service. Mr. Brady, when he cut off one trip a week from all the star-
</p>
<p>route service of the country, which reduction was rendered necessary
</p>
<p>by his fraudulent extravagance, put into his order not only a direction
</p>
<p>that every contractor was to have a month's extra pay on all that service
</p>
<p>just dispensed with, but they received this thirty days' pay for service
</p>
<p>which they did not perform, and which Brady told them they could
</p>
<p>not perform, because having estimated for $2,000,000 he had spent
</p>
<p>$4,000,000.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. Was not that the law ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. It was the law to give the month's extra pay. I grant
</p>
<p>you that. It was not the law for Mr. Brady to estimate for"$2,000,000,
</p>
<p>run it up to $4,000,000 by these fraudulent orders such as I have called
</p>
<p>to your attention, and then intimate to the contractors to bring pressure
</p>
<p>upon Congress to get his extravagant appropriations and thus enable
</p>
<p>you gentlemen to come in here and undertake to say that Congress has
</p>
<p>condoned your offense. Now on that route the extra pay to the con-
</p>
<p>tractor for the month amounted to several thousand dollars, as I rec-
</p>
<p>ollect it. Having been cut off in April, this trip was on the 16th
</p>
<p>of July restored. Brady had got in the mean time from Congress
</p>
<p>$1,250,000, and he had also, which was of more importance, got into
</p>
<p>103
</p>
<p>>
</p>
<p>a new fiscal year with a new star- route appropriation to operate
</p>
<p>upon for the whole country. Therefore he restored this trip, and
</p>
<p>the result was that the contractors were at .most without the one
</p>
<p>trip for two months and they got pay for it for one of those months.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rerdell, I think it is, for he was a voluminous correspondent,
</p>
<p>suggests to the contractors, in one of the letters we shall produce
</p>
<p>to you, that it will probably be a beneficial thing for them to
</p>
<p>have the trip taken off for a month because they can fatten up
</p>
<p>their stock arid get them in better condition.
</p>
<p>On the Ifcth of September, 1879, going back a little, Peck swore it
</p>
<p>would take on the existing schedule eight men and ten horses to perform
</p>
<p>the service on that route. It was 270 miles long and they had to go over
</p>
<p>it each way twice in a week. They had therefore to travel 540 miles in
</p>
<p>a week. Mr. Brady accepted Mr. Peck's oath that to do that would take
</p>
<p>only ten horses. I will not say that ten horses could not have done it,
</p>
<p>but I do say that those ten horses would have to travel a good many
</p>
<p>times as many miles in a day as Mr. Brady said in his orders for expe-
</p>
<p>dition was a proper number of miles for a horse to travel. He said on
</p>
<p>one of the routes that two miles a day was all a horse ought to travel,
</p>
<p>or four miles in double team, and from two to six miles a day ; that was
</p>
<p>about all he allowed. But he accepts this statement of Mr. Peck of the
</p>
<p>number of miles these horses ought to travel. Mr. Peck also swore
</p>
<p>that to reduce the speed from 120 hours to seventy-two hours would
</p>
<p>carry up the men from eight to twenty, and the horses from ten to sixty-
</p>
<p>six. To go over that route in five days, twice each way, you need but
</p>
<p>ten horses. To go over that route twice each way, in three days, you need
</p>
<p>sixty-six horses. That is the statement of the oath. As to that route
</p>
<p>we have this peculiarity : There is Baker City [indicating on the map]
</p>
<p>and here is The Dalles [indicating] ; there was from Baker City another
</p>
<p>route passing up by Pendleton and down to The Dalles. Every pound
</p>
<p>of mail matter which came from the east bound to The Dalles, which is
</p>
<p>a large place in Oregon, went over this latter route even though it arrived
</p>
<p>at Baker City. It went from Baker City up around that way because it

<p>was quicker'and more certain than to go by the other route. Every

<p>pound of mail matter that went from The Dalles to Baker City or farther
</p>
<p>east went around. Although longer, the route could be traveled quicker
</p>
<p>and more certainly. The first station out of this route this side of Baker
</p>
<p>City is Auburn, and a letter at Auburn which was intended to goto The
</p>
<p>Dalles did not go over this route [indicating], but went the other way
</p>
<p>east, and then around, and came west to The Dalles. A letter from
</p>
<p>Auburn intended to go to the first station the other way from this end
</p>
<p>of the route went first east, then north, then west, and then south.
</p>
<p>Not only did not the matter from the terminal stations pass over the route
</p>
<p>north ; matter coming from beyond the terminal stations, but the matter
</p>
<p>which originated upon a portion of the route went around about out of
</p>
<p>its way to strike another route so as to get to its destination quicker
</p>
<p>and more certainly. That is the route which the facts show so clearly
</p>
<p>was not a through route. It was a route that produced $2,300 a year,
</p>
<p>and Brady ran it up to $72,520 a year. There were only three settle-
</p>
<p>ments on the entire 270 miles. Those settlements were all in one val-
</p>
<p>ley, within a compass of fifteen miles. They were all right in there [in-
</p>
<p>dicating on the map], in the valley known as John Day Valley, \\ 7 hich
</p>
<p>was a valley to which an alleged discovery of gold had brought a cer-
</p>
<p>tain number of people. In point of fact, gentlemen, though expedition
</p>
<p>was ordered in November, 1878, within two months after the service
</p>
<p>actually commenced, there was no expedition performed on that route
</p>
<p>104
</p>
<p>until November or December, 1879, and yet expedition was paid for all
</p>
<p>that time at the rate of $72,000 a year. If it had got up to $72,000
</p>
<p>as early as that, it is possible that some of the increases did not begin
</p>
<p>so early. At any rate, expedition was paid for upon that route. I
</p>
<p>think we shall be able to show you that there ^ere some curious devices
</p>
<p>to get the evidence of a terminal postmaster that the mail had been
</p>
<p>carried when it had not been carried at all. A petition upon which
</p>
<p>that expedition was granted was interlined in a way to indicate that
</p>
<p>there has been applied to it some of the peculiar abilities which are
</p>
<p>shown to have existed in connection with other petitions on other
</p>
<p>routes.
</p>
<p>The route from Bismarck to Fort Keogh, 35051, was let at 250 miles
</p>
<p>long, on a schedule of eighty-four hours of time once a week. John E.
</p>
<p>Miner was the contractor. On the 2d of April, 1878, before the con-
</p>
<p>tract term commenced, when John E. Miner was the contractor, Stephen
</p>
<p>W. Dorsey, who was a Senator, writes to an engineer officer of the
</p>
<p>Northern Pacific Eailroad I think it was with reference to the length
</p>
<p>of the route and he gets a reply, which he places on file, showing that
</p>
<p>in point of fact the route was 303 miles, instead of 250 miles, long. On
</p>
<p>the 23d of December, 1878, three trips were added, and $4,700 allowed
</p>
<p>for those, being pro rata. Then the service was reduced from eighty-
</p>
<p>four hours to sixty-five hours, and $27,050 was allowed for that, making
</p>
<p>a total of $35,000 ; and on the 2d of August, 1879, three trips more
</p>
<p>were added, making $70,000 on a route where the original contract
</p>
<p>price was $2,350. Miner swore that three trips would take twelve men
</p>
<p>and thirteen animals on the then schedule ; that to reduce it to sixty-
</p>
<p>five hours from eighty-four twenty hours would require one hun-
</p>
<p>dred and fifty men and one hundred and fifty animals. Is not John
</p>
<p>E. Miner the champion swearer of the universe, gentlemen ? There is
</p>
<p>no pretense, there will not be any pretense, that that affidavit was cor-
</p>
<p>rect. It was sworn to by a man who never saw the route. In that
</p>
<p>respect, however, he is just like all the rest of these defendants. There
</p>
<p>is not an affidavit on file from any one of these defendants who, at the
</p>
<p>time he made the affidavit, ever had seen the route, as I am informed.

<p>Miner swore that it would take three hundred men and animals to per-
</p>
<p>form the service in sixty -five hours on a route in fact 303 miles long. It
</p>
<p>would, he said, take a man and an animal to every mile to perform that
</p>
<p>service. Now that statement was more than Brady could swallow. I am
</p>
<p>stating ik pretty strong, gentlemen, I know, When I say that. But it was
</p>
<p>more than he could swallow, and therefore in that case he did not make
</p>
<p>expedition up to the limit. He made expedition considerably below the
</p>
<p>limit. But you will remember, gentlemen, that in another portion of my
</p>
<p>opening I called your attention to the fact that there appeared on file
</p>
<p>proof of another affidavit of the same John E. Miner, in which he made
</p>
<p>a statement entirely different as to the number of men and animals
</p>
<p>which would be required, only about a third of what is stated in that
</p>
<p>affidavit, and though Mr. Brady could not swallow this second affidavit
</p>
<p>of Miner's and make the allowance up to the limit called for by it, he
</p>
<p>compromised things by making an allowance somewhat in excess of the
</p>
<p>first affidavit of Mr. Miner.
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. How much ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Somewhat in excess ; about $2,000 if I remember right ;
</p>
<p>and when anybody gets within $2,000 of Miner's figures he gets sur-
</p>
<p>prisingly near them.
</p>
<p>Now that affidavit of Miner's, gentlemen, was made within two months
</p>
<p>after he had been putting petitions into the Post-Office Department de-
</p>
<p>105
</p>
<p>Glaring that that route ran through trackless prairie, with 110 inhabitants,
</p>
<p>which was true 5 with no call for the mail, which was true, except that
</p>
<p>it was, as I ain going to show you presently, a route of growing impor-
</p>
<p>tance between two terminal stations, and where it had been claimed that
</p>
<p>he must have a company of soldiers to accompany every carrier over
</p>
<p>the route in order to carry the mail safely, and if his 150 men had
</p>
<p>actually been needed as mail carriers, he would have taken something
</p>
<p>like half the Army of the United States to accompany his mail-carriers
</p>
<p>over that route, if his affidavit had been true.
</p>
<p>That route, gentlemen, was the route on which Eerdell made the
</p>
<p>proposition to Pennell, the contractor, that when he got oat a hundred
</p>
<p>miles or so he should pretend that there was, thirty or forty or fifty
</p>
<p>miles north of it, a settlement, and that he should get up a petition and
</p>
<p>have it signed by his gang of workmen, and that in that way they should
</p>
<p>ask for mail service to connect with this route ; and that they should
</p>
<p>ask for the appointment of one of their number as postmaster at this
</p>
<p>supposititious place, on this supposititious route, and then they would
</p>
<p>get their arrangement made in Washington to carry their mail over
</p>
<p>this supposititious route they were going to make, and get an allowance
</p>
<p>for fifty or sixty or seventy miles. Mr. Pennell was too honest for them.
</p>
<p>He would not do it. He will come here and tell you the whole trans-
</p>
<p>action, and you will believe every word he says when you see him.
</p>
<p>That is the route, gentlemen, where they commenced by building a
</p>
<p>station every seventeen miles, and when asked by the contractor why
</p>
<p>they wanted stations every seventeen miles, they said that they were
</p>
<p>going to have an increase, and when they got an increase of trips and
</p>
<p>speed they would have to have stations every seventeen miles, which
</p>
<p>was true. But they were so certain that they were going to have it
</p>
<p>that they built those stations every seventeen miles, when, until they
</p>
<p>got the expedition, they used only every other station. They spent in
</p>
<p>building their stations, and for things other than the horses that were
</p>
<p>to run the route, $6,600, before there had been an order for expedition;
</p>
<p>before there had been any sign in the department that there was any
</p>
<p>call for expedition, when the Indians were going over that trackless

</p>
<p>prairie, according to their papers on file here ; and they spent $6,600
</p>
<p>for these permanent improvements, while at their existing rate of pay-
</p>
<p>ment they were getting only $9,500 in the whole four years of their
</p>
<p>contract. That is the route, gentlemen, upon which John W. Dorsey
</p>
<p>proposed to Pennell to go into partnership with him, and told him that it
</p>
<p>was to be expedited, and told him that there would be two increases with-
</p>
<p>in a year; that one of them would be an increase up to $25,000, and it
</p>
<p>is the route, gentlemen, on which they got one increase within a year
</p>
<p>which was up to $33,000 instead of $25,000, and on which they got a
</p>
<p>second increase in thirteen months instead of within the year, which
</p>
<p>carried it up to $52,000.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, that route, as I have said, was a route of consider-
</p>
<p>able and growing importance. The reason why their efforts to have it
</p>
<p>discontinued, on the ground that it belonged to the Indians and not to
</p>
<p>them, did not succeed, was that the inhabitants of Dakota, represented
</p>
<p>by their Delegate here, insisted upon it that there should be a mail route
</p>
<p>from Bismarck to Fort Keogh, which was a military post within the Ter-
</p>
<p>ritory of Dakota. There was, in that point of view, a justification of
</p>
<p>the existence of the route. There may have been, possibly, a justifica-
</p>
<p>tion of the increase of the number of trips to some extent. There never
</p>
<p>was any justification of the increase of speed and expedition. The very
</p>
<p>orders which Brady made refer to applications for increase corning from
</p>
<p>106
</p>
<p>officers of the Army, which officers did not ask for any increase of ex-
</p>
<p>pedition. They asked for increase of trips on the ground that they
</p>
<p>wanted constant communication with what we may call the outer world.
</p>
<p>They did not ask for increase of speed at all. Brady chose to take
</p>
<p>those petitions as a means of ordering increase of speed. That route
</p>
<p>was let at $2,350 for one trip. If he had made it seven trips a week
</p>
<p>he could have run it up to but $16,000. That was too paltry a thing for
</p>
<p>these gentlemen. They had to have orders for expedition and increase
</p>
<p>of speed that could give him any justification, even if he did not believe
</p>
<p>Miner's affidavit, in carrying the amount up to $50,000, and, therefore,
</p>
<p>he chose to pervert the letters of the officers of the Army asking for
</p>
<p>increase of trips into applications for increase of speed, and he will
</p>
<p>tell you, probably, that one of the noblest officers of the Army, Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Miles, whom it is one of the proudest recollections of my life that
</p>
<p>I have something to do with enabling him to get into that position in
</p>
<p>the lower grade of the military where he exhibited those capacities
</p>
<p>which made him a brigadier-general in the Eegular Army, passing from
</p>
<p>a simple clerk at the outbreak of the war in New England advised it.
</p>
<p>General Miles made an application for an increase of service. They trans-
</p>
<p>formed that into an application for increase of speed ; and a few others like
</p>
<p>that were used for authority for this expedition. Do not understand
</p>
<p>that there are not other papers there. There are other papers on file
</p>
<p>asking expedition. There is no question about that. You all know,
</p>
<p>and the court will take judicial notice of it, that you can get petitions
</p>
<p>anywhere for anything. Of course you can get petitions anywhere in
</p>
<p>the western territory from men who honestly and fairly, and from their
</p>
<p>point of view property, sign petitions asking that they should have a
</p>
<p>mail service every day in the week, twice a day if you choose, and that
</p>
<p>it should run ten miles an hour if you choose, for the simple reason that
</p>
<p>it is a convenience to them. It is not paid for by them. It is paid for
</p>
<p>by the general public, which means the public of the East; and they
</p>
<p>signed those petitions and sent them here because they believed, until
</p>
<p>the developments of this cause, that they had a Second Assistant Post-
</p>
<p>master-General who would look at the petitions and say, "This is the

<p>representation of one interested side urging its wishes and its views ; I am
</p>
<p>to judge of that judicially, with a view to the interests and demands of
</p>
<p>the entire country, and with a view to the amount which Congress has
</p>
<p>chosen to place at my disposal."
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. Won't you tell the jury what General Sherman said
</p>
<p>about it ?
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. General Sherman never said a word in favor of expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, and, if I may refer to it, you heard and I heard General Sherman
</p>
<p>say that expedition was not necessary.
</p>
<p>Mr. MERRICK. [To Mr. Henkle.] Why do you not keep quiet !
</p>
<p>Mr. HENKLE. I want you to tell the truth.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I am telling the truth right straight along. You are in
</p>
<p>the position of the sailor who said that what led him to prefer a par-
</p>
<p>ticular kind of religious service was because he had a chance to jaw
</p>
<p>back. Your time will come.
</p>
<p>The route from Vermillion to Sioux Falls, 35015, was let as fifty miles
</p>
<p>long and at fourteen hours time, trips once a week. It was really seventy-
</p>
<p>five miles. Mr. John W. Dorsey was the contractor, and $398 was the
</p>
<p>amount for which he undertook to perform the service. On the 1st of Au-
</p>
<p>gust, 1878, he made a contract with a Mr. Leach to perform that service for
</p>
<p>him, and he agreed to pay him $500 for it while he was only going to get
</p>
<p>$398. But then lie agreed that if it was put up to two trips, foreseeing
</p>
<p>107
</p>
<p>Brady's action, then lie would pay him $900 for it. On the 1st of Au-
</p>
<p>gust, 1879, a new contract with Leach was filed, which provided for six
</p>
<p>trips, and Leach was to get $2,150 in case of six trips. Lock -box 714
</p>
<p>appeared there, and the address was to be the care of John K. Miner,
</p>
<p>though John W. Dorsey was the contractor. There was an addition of
</p>
<p>a couple of miles on account of some change in the post-office. Then
</p>
<p>came the six trips provided for in Leach's subcontract. Then came the
</p>
<p>expedition to ten hours, and by that time the $388 originally to be paid
</p>
<p>by the Government was carried up by Brady's orders to something over
</p>
<p>$6,000. On that route Mr. Vaile, who was nothing relative to it offi-
</p>
<p>cially, was the man who made the affidavit for expedition. There were
</p>
<p>various changes upon the route, to which I will not stop to call your
</p>
<p>attention ; but in December, 1879, all the postmasters on the route con-
</p>
<p>curred in asking an increase of the time to sixteen hours, representing
</p>
<p>that the mail could not be carried in the then time. There was no other
</p>
<p>mail over the route. The petitions in that case were sent out from some-
</p>
<p>where, apparently from here, with blanks left in them. They were
</p>
<p>signed with the blanks left in them for the hours as I recollect it may
</p>
<p>have been trips ; for something and the petitions got back here and
</p>
<p>part of them got on file and never had the blanks filled, up, and there they
</p>
<p>are to-day with the blanks unfilled. But when these postmasters wrote,
</p>
<p>asking that the time should be reduced on the ground that it was too low,
</p>
<p>what was the result ? The postmasters sent the application through Judge
</p>
<p>Bennett, the Delegate from the Territory; and a member of Congress, or
</p>
<p>one occupying that position, is entitled to the consideration of an an-
</p>
<p>swer. When I comnmeced my opening I supposed that that answer was
</p>
<p>entirely lost. I knew that the original was lost. I supposed that there
</p>
<p>was no evidence of its existence. But there has been found the answer
</p>
<p>of Mr. Brady, and that answer of Mr. Brady, as appears to be indorsed
</p>
<p>on the papers that we found, is : u Wirte Judge B. that it cannot be done."
</p>
<p>He does not say why it cannot be done, except the obvious rule that
</p>
<p>when a Delegate or Member of Congress or Senator asks an increase of
</p>
<p>the amount of money taken from the Treasury, it can be done promptly,
</p>
<p>provided the money is to go into the hands of contractors who have

</p>
<p>made proper arrangements. If the Delegate, Member of Congress, or
</p>
<p>Senator asks that the amount of money taken from the Treasury be
</p>
<p>decreased, if it is to come out of the pockets of these same gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the answer is: "Write Judge B. that it cannot be done;" and they
</p>
<p>wrote Judge B. it could not be done, and then they went on arid added
</p>
<p>this other remarkable reason : " It would be an injustice to other
</p>
<p>bidders at the letting of the route."
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey, or Mr. Miner, or whoever it was, having got this contract
</p>
<p>as the lowest bidder, having then got the route expedited and got it
</p>
<p>run up from $398 to six thousand and odd dollars, the postmasters
</p>
<p>asked that that increase be taken off, and Mr. Brady says it cannot be
</p>
<p>done, because it would be an injustice to the other bidders on the route.
</p>
<p>What have the other bidders to do with that thing? John W. Dorsey
</p>
<p>was the bidder. It the postmasters' request had been granted the
</p>
<p>amount going into the hands of Dorsey and company would have been
</p>
<p>diminished. Dorsey would have been still responsible to carry the
</p>
<p>mail; still bound to carry the mail under his original contract; but Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady says it cannot be put back in that position, though the post-
</p>
<p>masters on the route, and there are ten or twelve of them, all say it
</p>
<p>ought to go there. Mr. Brady says it cannot go there because it would
</p>
<p>be injustice to other bidders on the route. Mr. Brady in giving that
</p>
<p>108
</p>
<p>reason did not do justice to bis own abilities. He ought to have found
</p>
<p>some better reason than that.
</p>
<p>The fact is, gentlemen, that that petition, and that application to Ben-
</p>
<p>nett to attend to it, was but the end of a long series of applications pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding from the route, representing that the rate of speed required was
</p>
<p>greater than the wants of the locality demanded, greater than could be
</p>
<p>carried out, and that there had been irregularities consequent upon not
</p>
<p>complying with the schedule. There had been that series of moves
</p>
<p>right along from the locality, and finally Judge Bennett was written to
</p>
<p>go and attend to it, and he went with that result to which I have called
</p>
<p>your attention.
</p>
<p>On the route from Eedding to Alturas, No. 46247. there were two trips
</p>
<p>a week. The route was 179 miles long, and the time was 108 hours.
</p>
<p>The agreement was to pay $5,988. Eerdell sent out the inevitable peti-
</p>
<p>tions on that route, and lock-box 714 comes in. The first petitions for
</p>
<p>increase bear date the 12th of April, 1878, three months before service
</p>
<p>was to commence. On the 5th of October, 1878, when Major filed his
</p>
<p>subcontract, he was to be paid $2,200 more than the Government was
</p>
<p>paying to Peck, the contractor. But it contained a provision looking
</p>
<p>to six trips. The provision was this, and it shows how unjust was Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady's idea of allowing pro rata on trips: He was to do the six trips
</p>
<p>for twice the amount of money for which he was to do two trips, and
</p>
<p>he was to do seven trips for $17,000, when, if there had been pro rata,
</p>
<p>he would have been entitled to have been paid $24,000. One trip was
</p>
<p>added before the service began at all. It was added in June, 1878, and
</p>
<p>an allowance of $2,994 was made for that. In December, 1878, the time
</p>
<p>was reduced from 108 hours to 72 hours, and $26,946 was allowed for
</p>
<p>that. So that a route starting at $5,988 was within less than six months
</p>
<p>carried up to $35,925, of which sum the subcontractor got $21,000, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the order which Brady himself made, and $14,925 according
</p>
<p>to the same order went to the nominal contractors here. By subse-
</p>
<p>quent changes the contractor got $41,916, and the subcontractor, who
</p>
<p>did the work, got of that only $23,000. And yet, gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>while all that money was being paid for a reduction from 108 to 72

</p>
<p>hours, in point of fact the mail was being carried all the time before the
</p>
<p>payment was ordered by Brady in 41 to 43 hours in summer and 60
</p>
<p>hours in winter. Brady paid that large sum under the pretense that
</p>
<p>thereby he was getting the time of carrying the mail reduced from 122
</p>
<p>hours to 70 hours, when, in point of fact, the mail was being carried
</p>
<p>in between 60 and 41 hours all the time. There was no pretense of ne-
</p>
<p>cessity for paying that money money, mind you, that was paid without
</p>
<p>getting anything for it; money, the great bulk of which went to parties
</p>
<p>here in Washington with whom Brady was dealing, and did not go to
</p>
<p>the contractor who was carrying the mail. They were doing a large
</p>
<p>passenger and express business with four-horse coaches. They were
</p>
<p>glad to take the mail, which was not large, along with their passengers
</p>
<p>and express matter for the original sum which the contractor was con-
</p>
<p>tent to give them and which he agreed to give them, reserving to him-
</p>
<p>self a very handsome sum. Yet, in fact, the contractors claimed, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady, obedient to their call, gave large increases, being liberal with
</p>
<p>the money of the tax-payers of the country.
</p>
<p>The route from Julian to Colton, 46132, was let as 120 miles long, on
</p>
<p>a 54-hours schedule. John M. Peck was the contractor, and he agreed
</p>
<p>to carry themail one trip a week for $1,188. Mr. Hayes was the first sub-
</p>
<p>contractor, and was to have $ 1,069.20. That contract contained a provision
</p>
<p>for a future increase to two, three, and six trips; that was withdrawn;
</p>
<p>109
</p>
<p>then Mr. Vaile's subcontract went on file. Down in June, 1879, and less
</p>
<p>than a year after tbe service commenced, two trips were added and the
</p>
<p>time was reduced from fifty-four hours to twenty-six hours. I want
</p>
<p>you to remember those figures, gentlemen. And $5,340 was added for
</p>
<p>doing it. The mail is stated to have weighed about thirty pounds and
</p>
<p>to be chiefly printed matter. It supplied, in all, about 140 families. To
</p>
<p>the terminal station the mail went quicker by another route. The pe-
</p>
<p>titions on this route asked for thirty-six hours. There was not a peti-
</p>
<p>tion anywhere that asked for less than thirty-six hours. They asked
</p>
<p>for it in different forms, but they all wound up with thirty-six hours;
</p>
<p>and yet the affidavit which was made by the contractor had the fore-
</p>
<p>knowledge that Mr. Brady was going to disregard the petitions and
</p>
<p>give a schedule of twenty-six hours. He gave the schedule of twenty-
</p>
<p>six hours. It so astonished the simple people out in the locality that
</p>
<p>they did not believe it possible that he could mean it. They thought
</p>
<p>he w r as doing what he told Walsh he was not doing making orders for
</p>
<p>fun ; that he was u funning," as the boys say, and they went on for a
</p>
<p>considerable time treating it as if it w r as intended to be an order for
</p>
<p>thirty-six hours, because they gained nothing in twenty-six hours, and
</p>
<p>all they cared for was thirty-six hours. They got twenty-six hours,
</p>
<p>and yet, gentlemen, in that very order, we shall show it to you, the
</p>
<p>twenty-six hours was undoubtedly originally written thirty-six, and,
</p>
<p>for some reason or other it was altered into twenty-six ; so that the
</p>
<p>putting it to twenty-six hours w r as not a mere careless error. There
</p>
<p>has been a change in the order, which looks as if it was a change by
</p>
<p>substituting tw r enty-six for thirty-six. But there is no dispute, for-
</p>
<p>tunately, from other parts of the order, but that the one to which
</p>
<p>Brady affixed his signature, and which he approved, was a twenty -six
</p>
<p>hour schedule.
</p>
<p>The COURT. I think we w r ill hear your peroration to-morrow.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. Your honor seems to insist upon it that my opening shall
</p>
<p>have the regular ornaments.
</p>
<p>At this point (4 o'clock p. m.) the court adjourned until to-morrow
</p>
<p>morning at 11 o'clock.

<p>TUESDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1882.
</p>
<p>The court met at 11 o'clock.
</p>
<p>Present, counsel for the Government and for the defendants.
</p>
<p>Hon. GEORGE BLISS resumed his opening address to the jury as fol-
</p>
<p>lows:
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, if I had not already occupied time so greatly
</p>
<p>in excess of anything I expected, I should state with considerable con-
</p>
<p>fidence that I should be able to relieve you from listening to ine within
</p>
<p>a very short time. I think I shall be able to confine my remarks to an
</p>
<p>hour this morning.
</p>
<p>As to the routes of which I have not spoken I take up next the route
</p>
<p>from Eawlins to White Eiver, which is route 30113. It is in the Terri-
</p>
<p>tory of Wyoming, one hundred and eighty miles long. It was let on a
</p>
<p>schedule of one hundred and eight hours, one trip a week. Mr. J. W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey was the contractor, at $1,700, to be paid by the Government,
</p>
<p>Nearly -at the outset a Mr. Perkins became the subcontractor at $2,500,
</p>
<p>$800 more than the Government paid. On the 15th of April, 1879, and
</p>
<p>again on tbe 9th of May, 1879, directions were given that all communi-
</p>
<p>110
</p>
<p>cations on that route should be sent to the care of M. C. Eerdell. As early
</p>
<p>as October 1, 1878, three months after the contract went into operation r
</p>
<p>there was filed a subcontract with a man named Wright, by which he was to
</p>
<p>be paid for two trips $2,850 ; for three trips, $4,065 ; for six trips, $8,317,
</p>
<p>I think, and 25 per cent, of all expedition. That was the Wright contract.
</p>
<p>I am wrong in saying it was filed. I think that contract was not filed.
</p>
<p>On the 28th of December, 1878, in the same year, there was a subcontract
</p>
<p>filed by Mr. Eerdell. There were also upon that route at different times
</p>
<p>other subcontracts. On the llth of November, 1879, Mr. Stephen W.
</p>
<p>Dorsey appeared as the subcontractor. As early as the 2d of May. 1879,
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey telegraphed to Perkins, who was then performing the serv-
</p>
<p>ice, that there had been an order for three trips a week, the trips to be
</p>
<p>performed in fifty hours each ; the original schedule having been once a
</p>
<p>week at one hundred and eight hours. Mr. Dorsey telegraphed that
</p>
<p>there had been an order to that effect. There never was, in fact, any
</p>
<p>such order made by the Post-Office Department, or made by Mr. Brady.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey, though, obviously, was at that early stage interested ID the
</p>
<p>route. About the time that Mr. Dorsey telegraphed as to a change to
</p>
<p>fifty hours there was in lact a change to forty-five hours. On the 7th
</p>
<p>of February, 1879, Perkins's subcontract went on file with one of those
</p>
<p>sliding scales paying him for increase of trips. On the llth of Novem-
</p>
<p>ber in that year, as I have already said, Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey ap-
</p>
<p>peared as the subcontractor. In December, 1879, Messrs. Foote
</p>
<p>& Dalton appeared as the subcontractors, and some time in 1880 a Mr.
</p>
<p>Taylor appears and then disappears and then appears again. All
</p>
<p>this shifting about having taken place, it was on the 12th of May, 1879,
</p>
<p>that two trips were added ; the time was reduced from one hundred and
</p>
<p>eight hours to forty-five hours, and that was done at the cost to the
</p>
<p>Government of about $12,000. On the 1st of April, 1881, seven trips
</p>
<p>were added at a further cost of $18,275, carrying the total up to
</p>
<p>$31,981.20 on a route which originally cost the Government only $1,700.
</p>
<p>The contractor originally paid $800 to the subcontractor more than
</p>
<p>he got from the Government, and there was a time in. the history of
</p>
<p>those subcontracts where the route was transformed in such manner

</p>
<p>that the contractor having originally paid out $800 more than he got
</p>
<p>from the Government was receiving about $12,000 a year more than he
</p>
<p>paid out. He always received between $8,000 and $9,000 a year more
</p>
<p>than he paid after the arrangements for increase and expedition had
</p>
<p>taken place. Upon that route, gentlemen, a Wank affidavit was sent
</p>
<p>to Mr. Perkins, the subcontractor, in a letter from M. C. Eerdell. I
</p>
<p>told you yesterday that Eerdell was the omnipresent correspondent on
</p>
<p>behalf of these parties, writing in his own name, writing in the names
</p>
<p>of Miner and of Dorsey and of everybody else, and writing as to their
</p>
<p>contracts in turn. A blank affidavit for expedition was sent to Perkins
</p>
<p>with a direction to Perkins that he was to swear to it just as it was,
</p>
<p>the language being specific :
</p>
<p>Swear to it just as it is.
</p>
<p>The number of men and horses that were in use and the number
</p>
<p>of men and horses that would be in use were equally left blank. Mr.
</p>
<p>Perkins thought it an extraordinary thing, but he went before a notary
</p>
<p>and swore to it. He sent that affidavit back here and at some time
</p>
<p>that affidavit was filled up with the number of the men and horses,
</p>
<p>both those then required and those that would be required, and it was
</p>
<p>filed in the department, and in the order in which Mr. Brady makes
</p>
<p>his order for expedition, he refers to the affidavit of the subcontractor
</p>
<p>Ill
</p>
<p>as the basis of his authority for so acting. There was at that time
</p>
<p>also another affidavit there as to men and horses, but it was not
</p>
<p>referred to, as I recollect it, in the statement made in making the order
</p>
<p>for expedition. But though referred to, gentlemen of the jury, as the
</p>
<p>basis of the order which Brady made reducing the service to forty-five
</p>
<p>hours, in point of fact Mr. Perkins's affidavit was for eighty -four hours
</p>
<p>and not for forty-five hours at all. Brady pretended to base his order
</p>
<p>upon that affidavit, but when he came to make his reduction and his
</p>
<p>allowance he reduced it to forty-five hours, and forty-five hours was
</p>
<p>the time covered by a subsequent affidavit put on file by Mr. Dorsey,
</p>
<p>indicating, as we think, gentlemen, that when they sent that affidavit
</p>
<p>to Wyoming to be sworn to, and when they started in originally they
</p>
<p>started in looking to a reduction only of eighty-four hours, but when
</p>
<p>they came to carry out their plan, either because their greed increased
</p>
<p>and they wanted more money, or possibly because Mr. Brady saw that to
</p>
<p>make an expedition to eighty-four hours and to allow the requisite sum
</p>
<p>of money for it did not present such a gain in time as to anybody who
</p>
<p>examined the case would justify any change whatever, for the one reason
</p>
<p>or the other they reduced their time that they sought for to forty-five
</p>
<p>hours, and Mr. Dorsey made the affidavit looking to forty-five hours.
</p>
<p>But the indorsement on the papers had apparently been drawn with
</p>
<p>the idea that it would be eighty-four hours, and therefore the reference
</p>
<p>was made to Mr. Perkins's affidavit, but, in point of fact, when they
</p>
<p>came to actually execute it they found it forty-five hours, and the only
</p>
<p>authority for that was the affidavit of Mr. Dorsey. But they still left
</p>
<p>the reference on the back, as made on the basis of Mr. Perkins's affida-
</p>
<p>vit, which was for eighty-four hours.
</p>
<p>That is the route, gentlemen, on which you may remember that early
</p>
<p>in February, 1881, Mr. Eerdell wrote to Perkins or to Taylor, I have
</p>
<p>forgotten which it was, in Wyoming, that if he could get the petitions
</p>
<p>here before the 4th of March he had arranged to have the two trips or
</p>
<p>three trips a week carried up to seven trips a week. The letter got to
</p>
<p>Wyoming somewhere about the middle of February. The parties went
</p>
<p>at once to work. At Eawlins they started out on the same day,

</p>
<p>getting a petition written by some one there, and got signatures
</p>
<p>through the bar-rooms and similar places there and started the pe-
</p>
<p>tition back. The route was maintained, gentlemen, from Eawlins
</p>
<p>down to White Eiver, because at White Eiver there was an im-
</p>
<p>portant Government military station. It was the region where there
</p>
<p>had been at one time, long prior to these orders, what we are all fa-
</p>
<p>miliar with, the Ute outbreak, where there was a terrible massacre by
</p>
<p>the Indians. The route was maintained solely for the purpose of com-
</p>
<p>munication with the military post. There was little, almost no mail
</p>
<p>matter passing over the route save for them. When they went to get
</p>
<p>the petitions at the military post in obedience to the request of Mr.
</p>
<p>Eerdell they tried the commanding officer of the post, but he refused
</p>
<p>to sign. They could not get anybody to sign except there does appear
</p>
<p>hereapetition signed by a lieutenant and somebody else. Buttheman who
</p>
<p>was employed to get the petitions signed, after going to the commanding of-
</p>
<p>ficer and others, and trying to get them to sign, found that they would not,
</p>
<p>gave up the business, destroyed the form of petition which he had and did
</p>
<p>not send it. Those petitions did not get back here by the 4th of March. They
</p>
<p>got back here on the 5th of March, I think it was. On the 8th of March
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas, L. James, having become Postmaster- General on the 6th
</p>
<p>entered upon his duties, I think, upon the 6th Mr. Thomas J. Brady
</p>
<p>being still Second Assistant Postmaster-General, made the order allow-
</p>
<p>112
</p>
<p>ing the carrying of the service up to seven trips the seven trips
</p>
<p>which Mr. Eerdell in the preceding February said he had arranged to
</p>
<p>have made, provided the petitions were here before the 4th of March.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady did not go back upon him. Mr. Brady made that order,
</p>
<p>and when the order was, as everything that is done in the Post-
</p>
<p>Office is, entered on a large blank book which is known as the daily
</p>
<p>journal, and that journal was taken to the Postmaster-General by the
</p>
<p>clerk in charge to have his signature as indicating his approval of
</p>
<p>it, Mr. James saw that the order had been made. He signed the jour-
</p>
<p>nal, and directed the clerk to see that that order, which was the last
</p>
<p>order, as I recollect it, on the journal of the day, was revoked. That
</p>
<p>that clerk communicated that information to Mr. Brady was shown by
</p>
<p>the fact that soon after Mr. Brady came into see Mr. James to talk
</p>
<p>about that order, and he wanted to know whether that directon to re-
</p>
<p>voke that order indicated the policy of Mr. James as Postmaster-Geir
</p>
<p>eral. He was informed that it did, and he left. Mr. James assumes
</p>
<p>that he had obeyed the order that he had given him to have the ordei
</p>
<p>revoked, and it was not until the last week in August, as I recollect it,
</p>
<p>that it was discovered after Mr. Brady had gone out of office that
</p>
<p>he had failed to revoke that order, and that it had continued in
</p>
<p>operation all the time down to that time with its consequent result
</p>
<p>of drawing from the Government money at the rate of $18,725 a year.
</p>
<p>That order was made in that way, and then having been made by the
</p>
<p>way, gentlemen, this letter of Mr. EerdelPs which I have referred to was
</p>
<p>a letter we had great difficulty in getting at. We could hear of it
</p>
<p>everywhere. We could not find it. The recipient had passed it to
</p>
<p>somebody else, somebody else had passed it to another party, that
</p>
<p>other party had mislaid it, or it was in his baggage at a distant place,
</p>
<p>and everything of that kind ; but we finally succeeded in finding all of
</p>
<p>the witnesses, and when we got them here, after their statement of the
</p>
<p>contents of the letter, we did succeed in getting from the other side
</p>
<p>the press copy of the letter. It is the only paper that they have ever
</p>
<p>been willing to give to us as showing any of their actions in connection
</p>
<p>with these contracts. We make no complaint whatever of it, gentle-

</p>
<p>men. We simply call your attention to the fact that they have their
</p>
<p>papers in their possession, and that we have not got them. Upon that
</p>
<p>route, gentlemen, I call your attention to the fact that it may be claimed
</p>
<p>to have been kept up in connection with the Ute outbreak. Now,
</p>
<p>the Ute outbreak occurred in the fall of 1879. The orders that were
</p>
<p>made upon this case of increase were made entirely without refer-
</p>
<p>ence to that outbreak, because the first order adding two trips and
</p>
<p>$3,400 was made on the 1st of May, 1870, long before the outbreak.
</p>
<p>The order for expedition reducing it to forty-five hours was made on the
</p>
<p>1st of May, 1879, and long before the outbreak. The order for seven
</p>
<p>trips was made on the 8th of March, 1881, and long after the outbreak
</p>
<p>had been quelled, and after the number of the military stationed at the
</p>
<p>post had been greatly reduced. I state this because there is in the pa-
</p>
<p>pers an attempt to show that these orders and the expedition upon that
</p>
<p>route was made in view of the emergency or the circumstances created
</p>
<p>by the Ute outbreak. The Ute outbreak was on the 27th of September,
</p>
<p>1879. Orders were either made on the 1st of May, 1879, or on the 8th of
</p>
<p>March, 1881. The order of March, 1881, undoubtedly had the approval
</p>
<p>of the military authorities, or some of the military authorities here.
</p>
<p>All the offices upon that route from Eawlins to White Eiveu, including
</p>
<p>the two terminal offices, produced a net revenue which varied from
</p>
<p>$1,245 to $1,724 in different years. Excluding Eawlins, which is on
</p>
<p>113
</p>
<p>the railroad, and receivc'd its mail matter east and west entirely inde-
</p>
<p>pendently of this route, and we find this, that the offices upon that route
</p>
<p>in 1870 produced a revenue of $79.84, and in 1880, after the hiilitary
</p>
<p>had been increased they produced $325.89, and in 1881, $301.51. And
</p>
<p>yet the Government was made to pay upon that route, which admittedly
</p>
<p>was a local route, sums as high as $31,981.25, and leaving a profit to the
</p>
<p>contractor, who did no work, which varied at different times, but gen-
</p>
<p>erally was about $12,000. On that route, also, let me remind you, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, that after Mr. Kerdell had got his order increasing it to seven trips
</p>
<p>in April, 1881, he writes back to the subcontractor out there calling his
</p>
<p>attention to the fact in substance of what a good thing he had done for
</p>
<p>him ; how much he, the subcontractor, was going to make by being al-
</p>
<p>lowed to perform the service at $20,000, when the contractor was get-
</p>
<p>ting $31,900, and confident that he would feel very grateful and anxious
</p>
<p>to do something for somebody, for getting him so good a thing. Mr.
</p>
<p>llerdell, at some little length, impressed upon him that he, lierdell,
</p>
<p>got that arrangement made, and that the subcontractor out there must
</p>
<p>not suppose that any attorney or anybody else had anything to do with
</p>
<p>it; that he, Kerdell, did it all; that he, Eerdell, did so good a thing for
</p>
<p>the subcontractor in arranging to give him $20,000 for performing the
</p>
<p>service, while the contractor got $31,900; that he, lierdell that is the
</p>
<p>substantial inference from tne letter wants to be paid for what he did.
</p>
<p>The route from Mineral Park to Pioch^, gentlemen, is the last route
</p>
<p>included in this indictment which I shall take up. It is route 40104.
</p>
<p>It was let as being two hundred and thirty-two miles long. The time
</p>
<p>was eighty-four hours, and it was one trip a week. John W. Dorscy
</p>
<p>was the contractor, and the amount to be paid by the Government was
</p>
<p>$2,982. On this Peck, with no relations to the route, in a letter written
</p>
<p>by Miner, who had equally no relations to the route, asked leave to sub-
</p>
<p>let the contract, and Brady allows it, John W. Dorsey being the con-
</p>
<p>tractor.
</p>
<p>There was a subcontract on file in IlerdelPs name here at one time.
</p>
<p>There was another subcontract on tile in the name of McKibben, some-
</p>
<p>times known as "Joe" McKibben, a well-known resident of Washington

</p>
<p>Then there was a subcontract on tile in the name of Salisbury, a regu-
</p>
<p>lar mail contractor. There had been originally made a subcontract with
</p>
<p>one Jennings, and he had sent it here to the Delegate of the Territory,
</p>
<p>Mr. Dagget, to be tiled under the subcontract law. That subcontract
</p>
<p>was left at the ISecond Assistant Postmaster-General's office to be filed.
</p>
<p>The clerk received it, with nointimationthatit could not be filed. Inpoint
</p>
<p>of fact there was then on file a subcontract of Mr. Kerdell's, and under
</p>
<p>the law there could not be two on file. Therefore that contract never
</p>
<p>was filed. Mr. Jennings went on per forming or pretending to perform
</p>
<p>tor I think he was singularly deiicient in his performing his subcon-
</p>
<p>tract and assuming that he was to get his pay from the Government, and
</p>
<p>when, after a time, he got no pay he came on here, two years afterwards,
</p>
<p>I think it was, and for the first time then found that his subcontract
</p>
<p>had not been filed. That resulted in a good deal of stir here, and a
</p>
<p>good deal of what I suppose I may fairly call a row, and as the result
</p>
<p>of it Mr. Brady undertook to make an order that Jennings's subcontract
</p>
<p>should be placed on file, and should be placed on file as of the date
</p>
<p>when it was originally brought here, thus cutting off' everything that
</p>
<p>had been done since, and creating the greatest confusion, owing to the
</p>
<p>fact that payment had been made after that time to the other subcon-
</p>
<p>tractors who had their contracts on file, and presenting the question as
</p>
<p>8GB
</p>
<p>114
</p>
<p>to what Mr. Jeunings's relations were to the department under such
</p>
<p>circumstances as that.
</p>
<p>On the liith of January, 1879, six months after the contract went into
</p>
<p>effect, two trips were added, and the time was reduced from eighty-lour
</p>
<p>hours to sixty hours. On the 23d of July, 1879, such ;m addition was
</p>
<p>made as to make the route from Mineral Park to Pioche a daily route,
</p>
<p>and the result, therefore, was that from that time on a contract which
</p>
<p>had been let by public bidding for $2,982, was run up to $52,033.37.
</p>
<p>As to that route there are a series of remarkable facts to which
</p>
<p>I desire to call your attention. In the first place, there is a petition
</p>
<p>on file which was made the basis of one of Brady's orders, which
</p>
<p>purported to be a petition of citizens furnished by the mail on that
</p>
<p>route from Pioche, Nevada, to Mineral Park, Arizona, asking for more
</p>
<p>frequent malls and a reduction from eighty-four hours to sixty hours
</p>
<p>They describe- theni selves as citizens furnished mail by the United
</p>
<p>States mail on that route. Of the signers of that petition, no one that
</p>
<p>can be identified lives or ever did live on that route. No one of them
</p>
<p>lived nearer than a place called Signal, a hundred miles south of the
</p>
<p>southerly end of that route, and the postmaster at the southern terminus
</p>
<p>of the route, Mineral Park, who opened every mail bag that went over
</p>
<p>that route and examined every letter that went over that route and I
</p>
<p>shall show you pretty soon that he had not any great labor to do it
</p>
<p>that postmaster will say to you that he never knew of a letter passing
</p>
<p>over that route going to or from Signal; that the inhabitants down at
</p>
<p>Signal did not get their matter on that route at all. Thej' got it in an-
</p>
<p>other way. They were not citizens " furnished by the mail "on that
</p>
<p>route, and yet, gentlemen, some of those people honestly and squarely
</p>
<p>and properly I believe signed a petition, but that petition is a forged
</p>
<p>and altered petition. When you see it it will be obvious to everyone of
</p>
<p>you that it is forged and altered ; that the route being 40104 there was
</p>
<p>taken a petition from some other route which w ? as 40100 and something,
</p>
<p>the numbers being in numerals, the figure at the end was altered from
</p>
<p>the route for which that petition was signed so as to make it fit this
</p>
<p>route with the termini of the route Pioche, Nevada, and Mineral Park,

<p>Arizona, so altered, written over erasures, as anybody can see, and
</p>
<p>written over erasures under such circumstances that anybody can see
</p>
<p>that it related to a route not in Nevada and Arizona as there de-
</p>
<p>scribed $ and moreover, that petition bearing some forty or fifty names,
</p>
<p>you will all agree with me when you see it that the signatures on it
</p>
<p>were made by not exceeding five, six, or seven different people. There
</p>
<p>are not more than five, six, or seven different handwritings to all those
</p>
<p>names, and it is a petition, as I said, of people claiming to be furnished
</p>
<p>with mail matter on the route. All of the signers who can be identi-
</p>
<p>fied lived elsewhere, and the petition is thus altered, as I have said.
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, the extraordinary things in connection with this busi-
</p>
<p>ness did not stop there. There was another route, from Mineral Park
</p>
<p>to Ehrenberg, Mineral Park being the terminus of both of those routes.
</p>
<p>On the same day in which Mr. Brady made the order increasing the
</p>
<p>service or expedition from Mineral Park to Pioche he made a similar
</p>
<p>order upon the route from Mineral Park to Ehrenberg, and that peti-
</p>
<p>tion is a precise duplicate of the petition on the Mineral Park and
</p>
<p>Pioche route. The signatures are the same. Its language, as being
</p>
<p>parties receiving mail matter on the route, is identical. The names are
</p>
<p>obviously written by the same parties, and, gentlemen, it is altered
</p>
<p>and erased and forged in precisely the same way. It never was made
</p>
<p>for the Mineral Park and Ehrenberg route. Those two bogus petitions
</p>
<p>115
</p>
<p>were on one and the same clay, when on their face any man who sees
</p>
<p>them could tell that they were fraudulent, accepted by Mr. Brady as
</p>
<p>his authority for directing I don't remember whether that is an increase
</p>
<p>of trips or an increase ot speed ; at any rate, one or the other, which
</p>
<p>took from the Treasury a large amount of money. The petitions are
</p>
<p>altered not only in the route and the number of the route, but they are
</p>
<p>altered iu the time and everything of that kind, so that they are com-
</p>
<p>pletely diVerted from the use for which they are prepared ; but not only
</p>
<p>that, gentlemen ; that increase up to $52,000 was made on the 29th of
</p>
<p>Jamiary, 1879. The first increase was from $2,982 by the adding of
</p>
<p>$19,318 for expedition and two trips, and then $29,733.33 was added for
</p>
<p>four trips more. That expedition was made on the Mineral Park and
</p>
<p>Pioche route one of the orders. The order for the addition of $29,000 was
</p>
<p>made upon a single letter. The other order was made nominally upon the
</p>
<p>petition to which I called your attention. The single letter was written
</p>
<p>by Sidney Dillon, the president of the Union Pacific Railroad Company,
</p>
<p>and it was a letter which asked for communication by the Mineral Park
</p>
<p>and Pioche route, which was a portion of the route leading down to the
</p>
<p>Southern Pacific Kailroad, a rival route of the Union Pacific. It was
</p>
<p>requested on the ground that it would be of very great value in develop-
</p>
<p>ing the Territories, and giving intercommunication between the people
</p>
<p>along the line. Twenty-nine thousand dollars were taken out of the
</p>
<p>Treasury on thi j single recommendation of the president of a railroad com-
</p>
<p>pany representing the necessities and importance of a complete daily con-
</p>
<p>nection on that route. And yet, gentlemen, upon the route we find this
</p>
<p>condition of things: From the 10th October, 1879, to the 31st of Decem-
</p>
<p>ber, in the same year, we are enabled, on thirty-nine days, to fix the num-
</p>
<p>ber of letters and the amount of postal matter which went over that route.
</p>
<p>We can fix it absolutely. The postmasters, misunderstanding their in-
</p>
<p>structions, instead of counting the number of bags, counted the number
</p>
<p>of letters. As there was only one bag, and they did not suppose any-
</p>
<p>body ever thought there would be more than one, it never occurred to
</p>
<p>them that what was required was the record of the number of bags;
</p>
<p>so we find that in the whole thirty-nine days there went over that route

</p>
<p>one way thirty-one letters. On twenty of the thirty-nine days no single
</p>
<p>letter went over the route that way, but the mail-carrier, with the mail-
</p>
<p>bags, passed over the route from end to end. The only effect of that trans-
</p>
<p>action on his part was to aid these parties here iu drawing $52,000 a
</p>
<p>year from the Treasury of the United States. On thirteen of those
</p>
<p>thirty-nine days one letter went over the route in that direction ; on
</p>
<p>three days two letters ; on one day four letters ; and on one day it got up
</p>
<p>to the magnificent number of five letters. But, gentlemen, every one of
</p>
<p>those letters during the thirty-nine days were way letters. In the other
</p>
<p>direction the total was a little larger. There never was a letter during
</p>
<p>the whole time that went over the en tire length, of the route that started
</p>
<p>from Pioche at the north and reached Mineral Park at the south. The
</p>
<p>letters were chiefly taken upat a little intermediate town, Saint Thomas.
</p>
<p>That being the condition of things, and one of the increases having been
</p>
<p>made upon the letter of Mr. Sidney Dillon representing the importance
</p>
<p>of this intercommunication from road to road for through mails, what
</p>
<p>do we find ? On the 22d of January, 1880, the increase having baen
</p>
<p>made on the 23d of July, 1879, Mr. Brady makes an order, in which he
</p>
<p>recites that these mail bills, showing that " there was little mail
</p>
<p>matter passing over the route and that the service was irregularly
</p>
<p>performed" (which latter fact the mail bills did not show at all),
</p>
<p>therefore that the route should be reduced from the 1st of Febmary^
</p>
<p>116
</p>
<p>'this order having been made on the 22d of January back to its original
</p>
<p>price, $2,982 ; that all the increase which he, Brady, had made by
</p>
<p>which the sum of $2,082 had been run up to $52,000 a year should be
</p>
<p>cut off, because the mail bills showed that there was little mail matter
</p>
<p>passing over the route, and, as he said, that the service was irregu-
</p>
<p>larly performed. He was so indignant that he would not even give
</p>
<p>their and it is the only case I think where he failed to do it the
</p>
<p>month's extra pay on the service cut off, though the contractor claimed,
</p>
<p>and probably correctly, that under the law and the contract, if the serv-
</p>
<p>ice was cut off he had a right to his mouth's extra pay upon it.
</p>
<p>But here was Mr. Brady's honest heart so full of indignation because
</p>
<p>he had been induced to put up the cost to $52,000, when there were
</p>
<p>in thirty-nine days only twenty-one letters passing over the route-
</p>
<p>that fact obviously having been brought to his attention that he cut
</p>
<p>it all off with one fell swoop. And yet Mr. Brady's honesty did not
</p>
<p>last him longer than the 28th of the same month, for on that day he
</p>
<p>made another order reciting his order cutting it all down and then re-
</p>
<p>citing that in view of the fact that the route formed a part of the direct
</p>
<p>line of communication between the Central and Southern Pacific Kail-
</p>
<p>roads it was deemed advisable to maintain a portion of the service.
</p>
<p>The mail bills, which he had himself seen, showed him thatthe route did
</p>
<p>not form any portion of a route for intercommunication between those
</p>
<p>two roads, because it showed him that no solitary letter had ever left
</p>
<p>the line of the Union Pacific Kailroad Company on the north and reached
</p>
<p>the southern terminus of that mail route on the south. He recited,
</p>
<p>however, that because that was so he would not cut the service all oft'
</p>
<p>and reduce the payment down to the original sum of $2.980, but he would
</p>
<p>reduce it to three trips a week and he would only deduct $29,733.33,
</p>
<p>leaving the contractor with his twenty-odd thousand dollars clear. And
</p>
<p>then his indignation was so far modified also that he gave the contractor
</p>
<p>his month's extra pay on the service cut oft'. Having reduced the pay to
</p>
<p>$2,982 six days previously on the ground that there was no mail matter
</p>
<p>as appeared by the mail bills, he put it back six days later to twenty-
</p>
<p>odd thousand dollars on the pretense that it was part of a through

</p>
<p>route, when those very mail bills showed it was not any portion of
</p>
<p>that route. Gentlemen of the jury, we shall show you some facts that
</p>
<p>will perhaps give a reason for this action of Mr. Brady's consistent
</p>
<p>with the belief that the original cutting-down order was not the result
</p>
<p>of a spasm of conscience. The original cutting-down order was dated
</p>
<p>on the 21st or 22d of January. On the 12th day of January, eight
</p>
<p>days preceding, Mr. Brady had been called before an investigating
</p>
<p>committee of the House of Eepresentatives and had been examined
</p>
<p>somewhat in detail, but only partially, and he had been called upon to
</p>
<p>account for his estimate of $2,000,000 as all that was necessary for the
</p>
<p>star-route service made but a few months previously, while he was then
</p>
<p>asking Congress to give him $2,000,000 more to cover a deficiency which
</p>
<p>he had created, or which would exist under the orders which he had made,
</p>
<p>if those orders continued in force to the end of the fiscal year. He
</p>
<p>was called upon to give his reasons, and to give facts in connection
</p>
<p>with them. He was allowed to go oft' the stand, but he was directed
</p>
<p>to prepare and furnish certain tabular statements, and to give certain
</p>
<p>detailed information which was subsequently to be furnished to the com-
</p>
<p>mittee. He left the committee-room and went back to his office, and
</p>
<p>soou afterwards we find him cutting oft this whole service and redue-
</p>
<p>in" 1 it from $52,000 to $2,900. Undoubtedly in the momentary throw-
</p>
<p>in* off of balance which would come over a man under such circum-
</p>
<p>117
</p>
<p>stances when he found that an investigation was upon him and was ap-
</p>
<p>parently beiug pressed by a committee whokuewsomethiug and meant to
</p>
<p>know more, he made this order of red notion. But six days later there
</p>
<p>came a little calm reflection, as we think you will infer from the
</p>
<p>facts, and he came to the conclusion that if he 'allowed the record to
</p>
<p>stand in that way the question would be, u How did you ever come
</p>
<p>to put the price up to where it was! What justification had you for
</p>
<p>that, if you say there is no mail matter on the route F So he put
</p>
<p>the service back to the extent of three trips, and took from the
</p>
<p>Treasury some twenty-three or twenty-four thousand dollars a year for
</p>
<p>so doing. Upon that route, gentlemen, the net revenue in the year
</p>
<p>1879 was $701.39. For the year 1880, after Brady's fostering ex-
</p>
<p>pedition orders had been made, the income ran down to $597. In the
</p>
<p>year 1881 it recovered to $653.67. If you take off the post-offices
</p>
<p>which were not on other mail routes, Mineral Park, which was on three
</p>
<p>other routes, and Pioche, which was on four other routes, and also on a
</p>
<p>railroad, and take only the post-offices which were dependent upon this,
</p>
<p>route for their mail matter, the entire revenues of all the post-offices of
</p>
<p>this character were less than $50 a year, and for the supply of them Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady directed the Treasury of the United States to pay, and it did pay,
</p>
<p>at the rate of over $52,000 a year.
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, I will show to you that the order was persisted in
</p>
<p>after the mail bills brought to Mr. Brady's notice the fact that there was
</p>
<p>no justification for it. We shall present to you other evidence which
</p>
<p>will show you that in point of fact Mr. Brady knew, or was bound to
</p>
<p>know before any order was made, that there was no necessity for and
</p>
<p>no propriety in any such order of increase or expedition. On the 26th.
</p>
<p>of August, 1879, Mr. Bean, living not on the route but north of the
</p>
<p>route, a lawyer well known in Nevada, wrote that the mail was an aver-
</p>
<p>age of six letters a day, and that the population along the route was
</p>
<p>from twenty to thirty at different stations ; and he says truly, because
</p>
<p>he was in the same condition as a great many other people before this
</p>
<p>investigation started, that he did not know the causes that led to the es-
</p>
<p>tablishment of the route. He said it was not done in consequence of

</p>
<p>any petition from the Pioche end of the route, which was the north end
</p>
<p>of the route. I have shown you it was not, nor was it done in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of petitions from the south end of the route. It was done under
</p>
<p>the pretense of petitions from a point a hundred miles south of the south
</p>
<p>end of the route. Mr. Bean says he is sure the orders could not have
</p>
<p>been made by any one who knew the facts. He was wrong there, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen. However, he added " and advised without personal interest."
</p>
<p>No man who advised without personal interest could have done the
</p>
<p>thing that was done on that route. There are some other details upon
</p>
<p>that route, but I will not stop to go over them.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, I have gone through this case somewhat in detail,
</p>
<p>and yet omitting much that will come out in the evidence concerning
</p>
<p>these nineteen routes in this indictment. I have spoken to you, you wil I
</p>
<p>undoubtedly think, at great length, and probably unnecessary length,
</p>
<p>but I have spoken only in outline, as it will appear from the evidence,,
</p>
<p>as to the facts applicable to this case, and the facts upon which we shall
</p>
<p>ask you with great confidence, when the evidence closes, to render a
</p>
<p>verdict of guilty against these defendants. I have stated nothing to
</p>
<p>you, gentlemen, which I do not believe we shall be able to prove. I
</p>
<p>have stated nothing which I do not believe the court should allow us ti>
</p>
<p>prove. Yet, of course, you have already seen the indication that there
</p>
<p>will be an attempt on the other side to exclude some portion of the
</p>
<p>proof. I have stated nothing, as I have said, so far which we do not
</p>
<p>regard as entirely at our command; evidence which we are in a posi-
</p>
<p>tion to place before you at any time. I now desire to call your atten-
</p>
<p>tion to one single other piece of evidence wiiich we hope to place before
</p>
<p>you, but as to which I am bound to say I cannot speak with entire cer-
</p>
<p>tainty.
</p>
<p>There is an ex- Senator of the United States, like Mr. Dorsey, a car-
</p>
<p>pet-bagger from one of the Southern States. When the gentlemen
</p>
<p>concerned in the present management of this prosecution came into the
</p>
<p>case and took up the papers they found there had been left on the
</p>
<p>record a detailed statement that this witness could testify to various
</p>
<p>facts showing, among other things, the payment of money to Mr. Brady
</p>
<p>by Mr. Stephen W. Dorsey. I do not desire to go into details further
</p>
<p>as to what the witness would testify to, because it is possible that we
</p>
<p>may not have him here, and for this reason, gentlemen, he is a ingi-
</p>
<p>tive, with an order of this court for his arrest, and we are seeking to
</p>
<p>serve him
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. [Interposing.] Your honor, I want to know if this is a
</p>
<p>proper statement to make.
</p>
<p>The COURT. He is stating what he expects to be able to prove.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. No ; he is not.
</p>
<p>Mr. DAvrt>GE. He says he does not expect to have him here.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I do not say so. I say we expect to have him.
</p>
<p>Mr. WILSON. All right. Go on.
</p>
<p>Mr. BLISS. I say, however, that he has been in concealment. I say
</p>
<p>he has been concealed in Nevada, and we have spent a great deal of
</p>
<p>money in trying to find him, and the first time that we heard of him after
</p>
<p>emerging from concealment was when we were notified that he came east
</p>
<p>on a train from Chicago. I do not know that he was in company with
</p>
<p>him, but he was on the same train with a gentleman employed by the
</p>
<p>defendants in this case. We heard that he Appeared in New York ; that
</p>
<p>he went to Northern New Y^ork, with our agents in sharp pursuit, and
</p>
<p>jumped over the line to Kingston, in Canada. There he was at the last
</p>
<p>account protesting all the while that he could not testify to anything
</p>
<p>that would do us any good, but at the same time running out of the

<p>country to prevent being put upon the stand to see whether the state-
</p>
<p>ments in the papers on file made by such reputable persons as Thomas
</p>
<p>L. James and others of what he had told to them were true. He was
</p>
<p>seeking to escape in that way. I believe, gentlemen, that before this
</p>
<p>trial is over he will come to the conclusion that it is best to come here
</p>
<p>and tell the truth and subject himself to any discipline that the court
</p>
<p>may impose upon him rather than to subject himself to what must be
</p>
<p>practic illy perpetual exile. The order of this court goes anywhere in
</p>
<p>this country, and when found, places him liable to an immediate ar-
</p>
<p>rest. I believe we shall have him here ; but I am bound to say that I
</p>
<p>base my belief solely upon my knowledge of human nature and the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances of the case, and not upon any authority from him. If he is
</p>
<p>here we shall place him before you upon the stand, and when we have
</p>
<p>done so we shall ask you to remember that he is not a willing witness;
</p>
<p>that he is not a witness who has, of late at least, assisted the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment in any manner, but that he is a witness who has made certain
</p>
<p>statements which he said he could swear to and which we believe were
</p>
<p>true. That is the only evidence that I have referred to in my lengthy
</p>
<p>opening statement which is not, as we believe, entirely at our control;
</p>
<p>and I deem it but proper Avhile referring to it to call your attention to
</p>
<p>119
</p>
<p>the facts which may result so that if we fail to present the testimony,
</p>
<p>yon will understand it is from no fault of ours.
</p>
<p>And, now, gentlemen, let me briefly recapitulate what I think we
</p>
<p>shall be able to show to you. I think we shall be able to show you that
</p>
<p>Mr. Brady resorted to expedition as the regular practice of the depart-
</p>
<p>ment in contradistinction from all his predecessors who resorted to it
</p>
<p>only in exceptional cases, and in contradistinction from his successor who
</p>
<p>has never resorted to it. I think we shall be able to show you that he
</p>
<p>resorted to it when it was wholly unnecessary, that he paid large sums
</p>
<p>for expedition where none was needed, because after the expedition
</p>
<p>the mail was not carried in any less time than it was before, for the
</p>
<p>simple reason that it was previously being carried in less time than
</p>
<p>that for which Mr. Brady paid large sums under the pretense of ex
</p>
<p>peditiou ; that he paid large sums for expedition and for increase of
</p>
<p>service where there was no mail and where the evidence that there
</p>
<p>was no mail practically except the bag, was in Mr. Brady's own pos-
</p>
<p>session and shown by the facts to have met Mr. Brady's own eyes.
</p>
<p>We shall show how in every little thing the addition of a post-
</p>
<p>office on a route, the taking off of a post-office from a route the con-
</p>
<p>struction by Brady was against the Government; how, when service
</p>
<p>was reduced, in a large number of cases no deduction was made,
</p>
<p>but when a post-office with a mile or two of distance was added there
</p>
<p>was always an increased allowance made. We shall show you allow-
</p>
<p>ances for supposititious additions, when in point of fact those additions
</p>
<p>were entirely false; when the mail went over the same road all the
</p>
<p>time, and yet when Mr. Brady claimed that there was an additional
</p>
<p>distance made by taking in some post-office or other, though his own
</p>
<p>record showed him that the alleged addition was not made ; we shall
</p>
<p>show you that Mr. Brady utterly and entirely disregarded the produc-
</p>
<p>tiveness of a given route ; that there never was anywhere upon any of
</p>
<p>these routes any evidence that he took into consideration productive-
</p>
<p>ness but once, and that was when he took it into consideration in the
</p>
<p>order of the 22nd of January, 1879, and cut down the Mineral Park
</p>
<p>and Pioche route, reciting that there was no mail matter, and he changed

</p>
<p>that all in six days afterwards by putting up the service again. We
</p>
<p>shall show you cases, like that of Raton, where he wrenched a
</p>
<p>route around to the inconvenience of the citizens and to the great
</p>
<p>loss of the Government, and rendered it necessary thereby to have the
</p>
<p>route expedited so that the mail might arrive at the end of the route
</p>
<p>in the day time, and for that expedition large sums were taken out of
</p>
<p>the Treasury, when, if he had left the route unchanged, he would have
</p>
<p>needed no expedition, the mail would have gone over the route in the
</p>
<p>time that the citizens desired, and if he had left Raton in its proper
</p>
<p>connection it would have derived its mail matter by a mail route in
</p>
<p>the way in which the people in the locality desired it. We shall show,
</p>
<p>I think, that when he had occasion on such a route as that from Toquer-
</p>
<p>ville to Adairville to cut off ten miles from the end of the route because
</p>
<p>the First Assistant Postmaster-General had notified him that the post-
</p>
<p>office was discontinued and there was no place to take the mail, that
</p>
<p>he proceeded first to make an order for expedition, involving some
</p>
<p>$12,000 a year to the Government, and then he proceeded within four
</p>
<p>days afterwards, by an order, to cut off these ten miles and give a
</p>
<p>month's extra pay, reckoning it on the increased pay instead of reckon-
</p>
<p>ing it on the original pay. We shall show you, gentlemen, that he
</p>
<p>habitually, I may say wjthout exception, because the only exceptions
</p>
<p>are those whei\j we sliow you the circumstances so connected with the
</p>
<p>120
</p>
<p>Iraiul that they cease to become exceptions, paid up to the limit of the
</p>
<p>law, both for increase of service and increase of speed ; that the evi-
</p>
<p>dence is clear and must be clear, in his own knowledge and yours, clear
</p>
<p>from the records of his own department, clear from the subcontracts
</p>
<p>on file there, that there was no necessity for paying up to the limit,
</p>
<p>for the simple reason that the men who were performing the service
</p>
<p>were willing to perform the service for a good deal less than they re-
</p>
<p>ceived. We shall show you that in at least one case, in direct violation of
</p>
<p>the law, he antedated an order and paid large sums from the Treasury
</p>
<p>for service alleged to have been rendered before the order was made,
</p>
<p>though the statute expressly provides that he shall not do so.
</p>
<p>We shall show you, gentlemen of the jury, that he made his expe-
</p>
<p>dition entirely upon the oaths of the men who were to be benefited by
</p>
<p>it these contractors here in Washington, none of whom, at the time of
</p>
<p>the making of the oath, had ever seen the route, and none of whom at
</p>
<p>that time knew, of his own knowledge, how many men and horses were
</p>
<p>then being employed, and none of whom, other than Vaile, was by ex-
</p>
<p>perience calculated to say how many would be used for performing an
</p>
<p>increased rate of speed. We shall show you that he acted upon the
</p>
<p>oaths of the parties, though the only oaths before him were two incon-
</p>
<p>sistent oaths of the same man, sometimes sworn to on the same day,
</p>
<p>and at other times sworn to at a little different time, when one or the
</p>
<p>other of those oaths must have been false, and the mere fact of the ex-
</p>
<p>istence of those two oaths showed him that the man was not worthy of
</p>
<p>belief for a'moment. We shall show you that he made an order on the
</p>
<p>Bismarck and Fort Keogh route, which he plumed himself upon as be-
</p>
<p>ing less than pro rata, but based it on Miner's absurd oath that it would
</p>
<p>take one hundred and fifty men and one hundred and fifty animals to do
</p>
<p>the service, when, in point of fact, there had been an affidavit of Miner,
</p>
<p>in his office, showing that it would take thirty seven men and some
</p>
<p>eighty animals, I think $ and when the order had been originally pre-
</p>
<p>pared as based upon that affidavit and not upon the larger affidavit of
</p>
<p>Miner; but if he had made the order allowing the amount he did allow,
</p>
<p>instead of being less than pro rata it would have been over pro rata.

</p>
<p>He however took that absurd oath, and upon it based an order to have
</p>
<p>the exceptional pleasure of stating in his order that it was less
</p>
<p>than pro rata. We shall show you that the oaths were lies upon their
</p>
<p>face; that they stated that there were then in use a certain number of
</p>
<p>men and horses ; that from the very nature of the case the statement
</p>
<p>was false, because if the service was being performed it required more
</p>
<p>men and horses to perform it. We shall show to you that the statemen ts
</p>
<p>as to the number of men and horses that would be required to perform
</p>
<p>the service were absurdly false, because they led to such results as
</p>
<p>saying that a horse should travel only two miles in a day in carrying
</p>
<p>the mail, and yet on the existing schedule the horses were shown to be
</p>
<p>traveling anywhere from fifteen to twenty-eight miles a day. You will
</p>
<p>bear in mind, gentlemen, that the Government was to be defrauded,
</p>
<p>either by understating the existing number of men and horses which
</p>
<p>were being employed, or by overstating the number of men and horses
</p>
<p>which would be needed on the increased schedule ; that one being under-
</p>
<p>stated or the other being overstated the Government would be defrauded ;
</p>
<p>and if both occurred in the same case, one understating and the other
</p>
<p>overstating, the Government would be defrauded in very large amounts.
</p>
<p>We shall show you that he made orders on such affidavits as those made,
</p>
<p>as I have said, by affiants who never were on the route ; made, as I
</p>
<p>have said, by affiants who had no experience in the service, except
</p>
<p>121
</p>
<p>Yaile. We shall show you that in direct violation of the regulations
</p>
<p>which required the contractor to make his own statement of the number
</p>
<p>of men and horses, not to be accepted as conclusive at all, but as his view
</p>
<p>of the case, and that regulation made under a law which practically
</p>
<p>made the regulation law, Brady utterly disregarded it when it suited
</p>
<p>him and claimed to accept the affidavits of a subcontractor, that sub-
</p>
<p>contractor being a man who was not in point of fact performing the
</p>
<p>service and who had not at that time ever been upon the route. We
</p>
<p>shall show you more than that, that he accepted the affidavits of men
</p>
<p>pretending to be subcontractors who never were subcontractors, and
</p>
<p>whom the record showed had no relation to the route whatever. We
</p>
<p>shall show you, gentlemen, that he accepted affidavits which, on their
</p>
<p>face, were altered, erased, and fraudulent ; that there were of all the
</p>
<p>affidavits on the routes which he accepted but two which were not
</p>
<p>erased on their face and obviously unreliable, to say the least, and of
</p>
<p>those one was made by Miner and the other was the oath of Yaile, ac-
</p>
<p>cepted by Brady in violacion of law. We shall show to you, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, that he made orders for an increase of allowance which were il-
</p>
<p>legal, because the statute expressly provided that he should make no
</p>
<p>allowance for increase of speed unless the necessity for using
</p>
<p>more men and horses was thereby caused. We shall show you by
</p>
<p>the men who drove the horses all the time before and after Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady's order that no increased number of men or horses was required,
</p>
<p>but identically the same number of men and the same number of horses
</p>
<p>continued jogging over the route from one week's end to another. We
</p>
<p>shall show to you, gentlemen, the petitions which pretend to be the
</p>
<p>excuse for making the orders in some cases, and that the petitions
</p>
<p>were not only false in fact ; that they were not only gotten up by these
</p>
<p>other defendants who directed that their interest in them should be
</p>
<p>concealed and that the mode in which they were gotten up should be
</p>
<p>concealed, but that the petitions bore on their face evidences of alter-
</p>
<p>ation, evidences of change such as ought to have led Mr. Brady ?
</p>
<p>and would have led any honest Assistant Postmaster-General, or any
</p>
<p>man whoever expected that there would be any examination of his

</p>
<p>acts, who did not suppose that these things would go along without
</p>
<p>examination and without investigation, to hesitate greatly. We shall
</p>
<p>show you, gentlemen of the jury, bristling all over this case evidence
</p>
<p>of prearrangement with Brady and of understanding between Brady
</p>
<p>and these other defendants or some of them. We shall show you the
</p>
<p>statements of these defendants made in various places and to various
</p>
<p>persons that the allowances paid by the Government would be increased.
</p>
<p>We shall show you that these increases did actually take place in the
</p>
<p>manner and at the time that they said they would take place. We shall,
</p>
<p>show you a conversation with at least one man in which amounts of
</p>
<p>future increases and all were specified and where the result proved
</p>
<p>that tbe amount only was incorrect in being somewhat understated.
</p>
<p>We shall show you affidavits made six, eight, and ten months in advance
</p>
<p>of any applications for expedition, which affidavits stated the precise
</p>
<p>number of hours which Mr. Brady subsequently recited to be the hours
</p>
<p>tor which he would order service, and as to which he wished information
</p>
<p>as to how many men and horses would be required to perform it in that
</p>
<p>time; and those hours were picked out, gentlemen, entirely apart from
</p>
<p>any designation of hours in the petitions, because the petitions which
</p>
<p>pretended to be the excuse for the orders were not in existence
</p>
<p>when the oaths were taken; and called for hoars entirely different. We
</p>
<p>shall show yon that the defendants spent over $6,000 in building sta-
</p>
<p>122
</p>
<p>tious on a single route where, if tlieir contract had remained unchanged,
</p>
<p>they would, during* the entire four years, have received only about
</p>
<p>$9,500 ; and yet they built twice as many stations as they should
</p>
<p>want, avowedly, because they said they were going to have an increase,
</p>
<p>and when they got the increase they should want the additional stations,
</p>
<p>and they would not use the additional stations until they got the in-
</p>
<p>crease ; and they did get the increase, and then they used them. We
</p>
<p>shall show to you the payment by them of large sums, or considerable
</p>
<p>sums, for performing the service in excess of the amount which they re-
</p>
<p>ceived from the Government, and we shall show you in every one of
</p>
<p>those cases, gentlemen, that the loss was promptly, and after a very
</p>
<p>little time had elapsed, transformed by Brady's orders into contracts
</p>
<p>which gave them great gains. We shall show to you that by their form
</p>
<p>of subcontract, unknown in that respect until these men went into the
</p>
<p>business of speculating in mail contracts, which form they had printed at
</p>
<p>the outset of their career, they assumed that they were to have expedition
</p>
<p>upon their routes, and they got expedition upon their routes, and they used
</p>
<p>their form of contract under which the men who performed the service
</p>
<p>were to get somewhere from twenty-five to sixty-five per cent, of the sum
</p>
<p>allowed for expedition while these defendants were to pocket the differ-
</p>
<p>ence of seventy -five to thirty-five per cent. In Brady's orders he was
</p>
<p>compelled by the subcontract law to state the fact that he was allow-
</p>
<p>ing thirty-five to seventy-five per cent, more for carrying the mail than
</p>
<p>was necessary to be allowed for carrying it, because he was allowing
</p>
<p>from thirty-five to seventy-five per cent, to the parties who, his own
</p>
<p>contract showed, were not driving a horse or carrying any mail. He
</p>
<p>was allowing only a small percentage to the men who actually were
</p>
<p>performing the service. We shall show to you, gentlemen, as evidence
</p>
<p>of prearrangement, the way in which the bids were arranged so as
</p>
<p>to be upon routes where the trips were infrequent and the speed
</p>
<p>was low, because those were the only routes which afforded an op-
</p>
<p>portunity for their peculiar proceedings, which alone made their
</p>
<p>business profitable in view of the low sums they bid, securing from Mr.
</p>
<p>Brady increase of trips and increase of speed. We shall show you,

</p>
<p>gentlemen, that they were allowed not to commence the service when
</p>
<p>the law required them to commence it ; that they were not declared
</p>
<p>failing contractors, as Mr. Brady's duty required him to declare them
</p>
<p>so, until they could have time to get up petitions and get ready the ma-
</p>
<p>chinery which was to be, in some sense, a justification, an excuse and
</p>
<p>apology for Mr. Brady's orders for expedition, and that in some cases
</p>
<p>the commencement of the service and the orders for increase of trips
</p>
<p>and expedition coincide so nearly that it is impossible to tell which was
</p>
<p>first. We shall show you, gentlemen, orders for expedition and increase
</p>
<p>made by Mr. Brady in spite of the remonstrance of the people along the
</p>
<p>line of the route and in spite of the remonstrance of his own officers.
</p>
<p>We shall show you orders for expedition and increase of service perse-
</p>
<p>vered in by Mr. Brady in spite of these remonstrances. We shall show
</p>
<p>you that when it suited his convenience he found it very desirable to
</p>
<p>appeal to United States Senators and Members of Congress as backing
</p>
<p>him up and giving authority for doing what he did. I am not aware
</p>
<p>that there is anything in the law or the Constitution that says that a
</p>
<p>Member of Congress or a Senator who is sent here to legislate in yon-
</p>
<p>der building has any right to possess more influence with reference to
</p>
<p>mail service than you or I or anybody else. He has the right of the
</p>
<p>citizen living in the locality and no more. We shall show to you that
</p>
<p>while there was claimed to be given to those men undue weight when
</p>
<p>123
</p>
<p>they requested increase of service and increase of speed, because they
</p>
<p>took from the Treasury increased amounts of money, thnt when those
</p>
<p>persons became satisfied that injustice had been done and there ought
</p>
<p>to be a revocation of the order, then they could not procure its revoca-
</p>
<p>tion ; that Senators and Members were told it could not be done, and
</p>
<p>that absurd excuses were given, such as the excuse on the Vermillion
</p>
<p>and Sioux Falls route, that it would be unjust to the other bidders. We
</p>
<p>-shall show you double service paid for on the same route. We shall
</p>
<p>show you expedition ordered and paid for when expedition was not made
</p>
<p>and when there was no change of time. We shall show you trips or-
</p>
<p>dered to be made in a time which all the postmasters on the route de-
</p>
<p>clared to be impossible, which turned out to be impossible, and which
</p>
<p>necessarily led to fines and penalties under the law, which fines and
</p>
<p>penalties fell upon the subcontractors and not upon-the favored friends
</p>
<p>of Mr. Brady, these defendants. We shall show to you that those fines
</p>
<p>and penalties were remitted in some cases, and so remitted that the
</p>
<p>contractors put them into their pockets and kept the money which had
</p>
<p>been originally taken from the subcontractors. We shall ask you, in
</p>
<p>that connection, to remember the statement of Mr. Rerdell to Mr.
</p>
<p>James and Mr. MacVeagh, and the statement of Mr. Brady himself to
</p>
<p>Mr. Walsh, that he was paid 50 per cent, of all the remissions that he
</p>
<p>ordered. We shall show to you, gentlemen, cases where, as upon the
</p>
<p>Mineral Park and Pioche route, Mr. Brady sawed the service up and sawed
</p>
<p>it down, so far as the allowances were concerned, at his own sweet will,
</p>
<p>upon excuses which the papers before him, to which he referred, showed
</p>
<p>to be untrue, upon excuses which jnust have been untrue, and under
</p>
<p>circumstances which showed beyontt-all question that he was acting in
</p>
<p>utter disregard of the interests of the Government. We shall show you
</p>
<p>the buying of the silence of postmasters and contractors who complained
</p>
<p>and recommended a discontinuance of the service, where these con-
</p>
<p>tractors were, beyond all dispute, making very large sums, because the
</p>
<p>record shows that they were getting a very large amount more than
</p>
<p>they paid to the subcontractors for performing the service. We shall
</p>
<p>show to you, gentlemen, all these things and more. We shall show
