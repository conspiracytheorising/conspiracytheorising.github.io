</p>
<p>Writing of the results of the Chicago Convention of
</p>
<p>1863, John O'Mahonyhas this passage:  "The promulga-
</p>
<p>tion of the resolutions gave great offence to James Stephens
</p>
<p>and his admirers in Ireland, and, upon after consideration,
</p>
<p>to the partisans of immediate action here. Both conspired
</p>
<p>and finally effected the overthrow of the system of which
</p>
<p>the said resolutions were the exponents. James Stephens
</p>
<p>and the * Men of Action ' triumphed over my principles
</p>
<p>for a short time, though they split up into two jarring
</p>
<p>factions soon after. Both of them adopted immediate
</p>
<p>war, or dissolution, as their banner-cry ; both have
</p>
<p>since had their full swing in as far as their mutual
</p>
<p>riv;dry would let tlicni,  one in Ireland, the other in
</p>
<p>Canada. To-day, having had bitter experience of the
</p>
<p>folly and impracticability of their several schemes, the

</p>
<p>2 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>since to substitute one single idea or programme of their
</p>
<p>own that was not either frantically rash or totally impossible.
</p>
<p>The first convention of the Brotherhood had scarcely
</p>
<p>adjourned when the * Men of Action,' repenting of their
</p>
<p>participation therein, set about undoing its work. Steps
</p>
<p>were taken by them for holding a Fenian fair in Chicago,
</p>
<p>where their faction was strongest ; and, without con-
</p>
<p>sulting the Central Council or myself, they despatched
</p>
<p>the late H. O'C. McCarthy to Ireland, ostensibly for the
</p>
<p>purpose of purchasing and collecting goods, but really to
</p>
<p>invite James Stephens to America, in order to aid them in
</p>
<p>precipitating a fight in Ireland. The latter gentleman
</p>
<p>arrived here, in M'Carthy's company, in '64, attended the
</p>
<p>fair in question, and made a long tour through the States,
</p>
<p>visiting the circles of the organisation. He everywhere
</p>
<p>proclaimed that the revolutionists in Ireland would either
</p>
<p>fight or dissolve their organisation within the coming year.
</p>
<p>'War, or dissolution in '65,* became his watchword.
</p>
<p>This cry was taken up eagerly by the sanguine and unre-
</p>
<p>flecting masses of our countrymen ; it was fostered by the
</p>
<p>knavish antl designing. I believed the proposition imprac-
</p>
<p>ticable as matters stood, and discouraged it as far as I
</p>
<p>could without coming to an open rupture with its origi-
</p>
<p>nator."
</p>
<p>The " Men of Action "  otherwise qualified as the
</p>
<p>"knavish and designing"  published their own account of
</p>
<p>the matters alluded to in the foregoing extract, which it is
</p>
<p>but fair to cite:  "With laudable modesty this person
</p>
<p>(O'Mahony), though condemning quick work, took to him-

<p>self (when, despite of his opposition, good had been ac-
</p>
<p>Stephens^ Visit to Aine7'ica, 1864. 3
</p>
<p>compHshcd) credit for everything, or almost everything,
</p>
<p>done by the patriotic Irishmen of America. He was
</p>
<p>content to drag along the organisation on the slow coach
</p>
<p>wheels of ten cents, a week " dues " and such other ineffec-
</p>
<p>tive means towards the accomplishment of a noble and
</p>
<p>magnificent object. We of the West looked upon a plod-
</p>
<p>ding, aimless, half inanimate organisation as worse than
</p>
<p>none, and determined, so far as we were concerned, the
</p>
<p>I'YMiian Hrotliorhood should be a living fact. Ikit this did
</p>
<p>not seem to be the idea at " head quarters." Mr O'Mahony,
</p>
<p>whose claims to respect and consideration are based upon
</p>
<p>his connection with the unfortunate ^^^j-^r^? of 1848, deemed
</p>
<p>himself, if others did not, infallible. To sustain his pre-
</p>
<p>tensions to superior sagacity, the "Head Centre" was in
</p>
<p>the habit of referring to his deeds in that affair. The
</p>
<p>summary of these deeds may be briefly told. Like many
</p>
<p>others actuated by the impulse of the moment, O'Mahony
</p>
<p>entered upon the struggle unprepared. He headed a
</p>
<p>miniature "rising," accomplished nothing, fled to France,
</p>
<p>and finally came to this country, where, through chance, or
</p>
<p>prestige, or both combined, he became the apparent leader
</p>
<p>and propagandist of the Fenian movement.
</p>
<p>His capacity not having been tested, Mr O'Mahony
</p>
<p>answered well enough in the infancy of the Brotherhood ;
</p>
<p>but, as it approached maturity, it became evident to all dis-
</p>
<p>interested observers that he was not equal to his position.
</p>
<p>He was principally brought into notoriety by being assailed
</p>
<p>as the leader of the F. B., which was at the outset, and long
</p>
<p>after, bitterly attacked from many quarters, principally

</p>
<p>by some of the Catholic prelates. His name began
</p>
<p>4 The Fenian Co7ispiracy,
</p>
<p>to grow popular ; people mistook the question, looked to
</p>
<p>an individual instead of to a principle, and without reflec-
</p>
<p>tion gave to one man the credit due, for the most part, to
</p>
<p>the patriotic Irish people. Mr O'Mahony, placed by
</p>
<p>accident in the van, reflected the light of the organisation,
</p>
<p>and appeared to be the master spirit of the movement, until
</p>
<p>the dazzled beholders imagined that a demigod reigned,
</p>
<p>where, after all, but a very commonplace mortal existed.
</p>
<p>Any one man placed in the same position might be thus
</p>
<p>unintentionally and undeservedly elevated to a place far
</p>
<p>above his merits.
</p>
<p>"An easy, jogtrot kind of policy seemed to be the
</p>
<p>Head Centre's idea of how Ireland might be freed. He
</p>
<p>pursued his fair and easy course with a vengeance. 'Blow-
</p>
<p>ing' seemed to be the order of the hour, and, at St
</p>
<p>Patrick's Day festivals and celebration, great things were
</p>
<p>promised by him and others, which caused many to believe
</p>
<p>that a great power existed, when, in reality, a skeleton
</p>
<p>organisation held its place. Up to the time of the first
</p>
<p>Fenian Congress, held in this city (Chicago) in November
</p>
<p>1863, and called, too, against the wishes of John O'Mahony
</p>
<p> the F. B.  was neither more nor less than a myth.
</p>
<p>After that congress the Fenian Brotherhood rapidly grew
</p>
<p>to power and influence. But it required a proper leader
</p>
<p>to turn this strength to advantage. Such a leader
</p>
<p>O'Mahony was not. To outsiders and recruits he ap-
</p>
<p>peared perfection; old members however  of course,
</p>
<p>excepting the Head Centre's personal and interested
</p>
<p>friends  looked upon him quite differently  they saw

</p>
<p>that he was suspicious, despotic, and vacillating ; that he
</p>
<p>Stephens Visit to America, 1864. 5
</p>
<p>looked with distrust upon everything that did not origi-
</p>
<p>nate with himself; he feared the quick policy of the
</p>
<p>Western organisation, and treated every advance of its
</p>
<p>leaders as dictation.
</p>
<p>Conscious that the scattered elements of a grand
</p>
<p>organisation were in the land, and that by drawing
</p>
<p>these elements together good work could be done, it
</p>
<p>was sugru\sted to Mr O'Mahony, by Michael Scanlan
</p>
<p>and oth( rs, that a convention of Fenian Centres and
</p>
<p>Delegates should meet in some city of the Union,
</p>
<p>and devise measures for the further extension of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood. For some unexplained reason, Mr O'Ma-
</p>
<p>hony opposed the plan ; but, finally he was overruled, or
</p>
<p>at least he was persuaded to call it. The Convention
</p>
<p>met in this city in November 1863 ; its action is now
</p>
<p>historical. From it sprang the giant organisation which
</p>
<p>has, latterly, fixed the attention of half the world.
</p>
<p>Soon the idea of a great Irish National Fair was conceived
</p>
<p>by us, and we set hopefully to work to make it successful.
</p>
<p>Mr O'M.'iIiony was written to by us on the subject of the
</p>
<p>fair ; thr( e letters were despatched without receiving a
</p>
<p>reply ; finally, Michael Scanlan went to New, York to sec
</p>
<p>to it ; and, in the course of his efforts, Mr O'Mahony in-
</p>
<p>formed him that, if to beg a dollar were to save Ireland,
</p>
<p>he (John O'Mahony) would not humiliate himself by so
</p>
<p>doing. Nothing daunted we set to work, appointed
</p>
<p>M'Carthy agent to Ireland, for soliciting goods of national
</p>
<p>and historical interest for our fair ; and well he accom-
</p>
<p>plished his mission.

<p>In the circumstance we are about- to mention lies
</p>
<p>6 The Fenian Co7ispiracy.
</p>
<p>the chief reason of O'Mahony's dishke to the men or
</p>
<p>Chicago. Conceiving that in the presence of the C. IC.
</p>
<p>of the I. R. in this country we would gain much, we
</p>
<p>resolved to bring him here that he might stir us up the
</p>
<p>more speedily. While in this city a dispute arose be-
</p>
<p>tween him and O'Mahony as to the disposal of the funds
</p>
<p>raised by means of the National Fair. Stephens being
</p>
<p>asked by one of our leading men, how much he had re-
</p>
<p>ceived during the five years between 1858 and 1863 (the
</p>
<p>interval between his two visits to America), replied that
</p>
<p>he had got only ^^150 in that time. Whereupon
</p>
<p>O'Mahony was asked if Chicago alone had not sent on
</p>
<p>more than that to 'Head Quarters.?' lie said 'Yes.'
</p>
<p>What, then, has the rest of America been doing } He
</p>
<p>could not tell ; but admitted the facts  that the expenses
</p>
<p>of Head Quarters had swallowed up more than had been
</p>
<p>sent to Ireland in five years.* Is it a wonder then that
</p>
<p>men were indignant at such conduct as this on the part of
</p>
<p>the Head Centre } We resolved from this moment that
</p>
<p>Mr Stephens should be properly supported. From that
</p>
<p>time Mr O'Mahony has looked with suspicion on the West;
</p>
<p>he saw that we were no * clansmen,' that our motto was 
</p>
<p>we worshipped the idea, not the man.
</p>
<p>" It may be well now to take a cursory view of the
</p>
<p>financial history of the F. B. It is a well-known fact that
</p>
<p>the main object of establishing the Brotherhood in this
</p>
<p>country, was to furnish the means to propagate the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of the I.R.B. in Ireland, to supply the munitions of
</p>
<p>* Here the deliberate falsehood of Stephens  that he had received

</p>
<p>war, and to send as many disciplined men into the field
</p>
<p>as volunteered their services. The Society was under the
</p>
<p>exclusive controul of John O'Mahony, from the time of its
</p>
<p>being introduced into this country up to the time of the
</p>
<p>Chicago Convention, held in the fall of '6^. The marked
</p>
<p>ability, and masterly executive power of this * Mighty
</p>
<p>Chief did not accomplish much in a financial point of
</p>
<p>view, during the five years of his arbitrary reign. Dis-
</p>
<p>daining to have any knowledge of the common-place art
</p>
<p>of book-keeping, and thinking such knowledge beneath a
</p>
<p>yeoman's son; and priding himself on a total want of
</p>
<p>business tact, the returns at 6 Centre Street were so
</p>
<p>meagre that, when the expenses of the II. C. and clerks
</p>
<p>were taken out, the entire amount of money remitted to
</p>
<p>Ireland, from '58 to ^G'S, would not arm and ecjuip one
</p>
<p>hundred men. The men of this city thought the time was
</p>
<p>come when a more enlarged policy should be adopted, and
</p>
<p>a plan of action laid down. Letters were written to
</p>
<p>O'Mahony from this city entreating him to call a general
</p>
<p>convention of the Brotherhood. As a compliment to
</p>
<p>Chicago, it being, as Mr O'Mahony stated in one of his
</p>
<p>letters to Mr Scanlan  the main support of the Society, 
</p>
<p>orders were issued from head-quarters to the various circles
</p>
<p>in the country, to meet in convention in this city. The
</p>
<p>plan of action, as suggested by the leading Fenians of this
</p>
<p>city, was adopted ; and, as the result of this policy, the
</p>
<p>ramifications of the Brotherhood soon extended over
</p>
<p>the entire north-west, and in proportion as the Society
</p>
<p>increased in numbers, in the same ratio did the finance of

<p>the F. B. multiply.
</p>
<p>8 TJie Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>" In the spring of '64 we conceived the plan of getting
</p>
<p>up the Irish National Fair. As Mr O'Mahony's letters
</p>
<p>prove, which we hold now in our possession, he strongly
</p>
<p>opposed this means to raise funds for the I. R. B. in Ireland.
</p>
<p>But when he saw that this enterprise was approved by the
</p>
<p>C. E. in Ireland, and his patriotic supporters, he reluctantly
</p>
<p>consented, provided the money realised should pass through
</p>
<p>his own hands, so that he could dole it out in small sums
</p>
<p>to the C. E. in Ireland. This trifling with the man at home
</p>
<p>was strongly condemned by us ; and we, together with our
</p>
<p>patriotic brothers in America, boldly set to work."
</p>
<p>So far as they go, both the extracts we have given are
</p>
<p>substantially correct. There is much, however, that they
</p>
<p>do not give. They show the factions that already were
</p>
<p>active within the conspiracy. They show O'Mahony and
</p>
<p>Stephens in antagonism ; and they show that the latter
</p>
<p>had a large following already in America, as we have re-
</p>
<p>marked, that O'Mahony had also a following in Ireland
</p>
<p>and England,  a following which was much larger without
</p>

</p>
<p>phens, and he, in his turn, as we have seen, was as actively,
</p>
<p>and far more astutely employed in working against
</p>
<p>O'Mahony. O'Mahony had made much way with several
</p>
<p>of Stephens's most active lieutenants ; but Stephens, more
</p>
<p>adroit than he, had contrived to gain all the more important
</p>
<p>Centres of the Western States.
</p>
<p>By 1863 the leading politicians of the United States

<p>had seen that Fenianism, in America at least, might be

<p>of recruiting their armies. They had resolved to play
</p>
<p>Stephens Visit to America^ 1864. 9
</p>
<p>it off against England, and were intriguing to obtain
</p>
<p>its direction. It suited their purpose, as well as the
</p>
<p>puri)ose of the C. O. I. R., to depose O'Mahony, or, at
</p>
<p>least, to reduce him to the condition of a mere puppet,
</p>
<p>in the hands of a council which should -control hiin*
</p>
<p>in all things. The Convention of Chicago was mani-
</p>
<p>pulated by men very much in the service of Stephens, but
</p>
<p>far more in the service of the United States, though, per-
</p>
<p>haps, the majority did not know that they were so far and
</p>
<p>so exclusively serving the politicians of America as was
</p>
<p>really the fact. Whomsoever they served, however, their
</p>
<p>labours tended to the same end.
</p>
<p>The extracts just given represent this second transatlantic
</p>
<p>trip of Stephens as the result of an invitation. That was so,
</p>
<p>but the invitation was suggested in the first instance by
</p>
<p>Stephens himself. The model conspirator, as usual, had a
</p>
<p>double motive in making the voyage,  more correctly, a
</p>
<p>triple one. I le wanted to draw as much money as possible
</p>
<p>out of the Fenians of the States, as well as to secure the
</p>
<p>overthrow of O'Mahony; and he wanted also to provide for
</p>
<p>the collapse of the conspiracy for the time at least,  on the
</p>
<p>western shores of the Atlantic as in Great Britain and Ire-
</p>
<p>land. We have no direct evidence to prove that he had at
</p>
<p>this time come to an understanding with the authorities in
</p>
<p>Dublin Castle ; but his conduct points strongly to such an
</p>
<p>understanding; in fact, so do all the events in Ireland
</p>
<p>from his return to that country after this visit up to his final
</p>
<p>departure from the island.

<p>McCarthy, James Stephens drew up the following docu-
</p>
<p>TO The Fenia7i Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>mcnt By it he provided for tlie government of the I. R. B.
</p>
<p>during his absence  and for something more. The docu-
</p>
<p>ment, which shows the despotic powers which he arrogated,
</p>
<p>was the most formidable piece of evidence produced
</p>
<p>against those named therein. Therein the style in which
</p>
<p>the commissions of the I. R. B. were usually drawn was
</p>
<p>not adhered to ; the slang of the conspirators was aban-
</p>
<p>doned ; everything was clear and precise, although here,
</p>
<p>if anywhere, one would have thought obscurity indis-
</p>
<p>pensable. It ran thus :
</p>
<p>" Executive. I hereby appoint Thomas Clark Liiby, John
</p>
<p>O'Leary, and Charles J. Kickham, a Committee of Organisation or
</p>
<p>Executive, with the same supreme control over the home organisa-
</p>
<p>tion of Ireland, England, and Scotland, I have exercised myself. I
</p>
<p>further empower them to appoint a Committee of military inspection,
</p>
<p>and a committee of appeal and judgment, the functions of which will
</p>
<p>be made known to each member by the Executive. And trusting to
</p>
<p>the patriotism and ability of the Executive, I fully endorse their action
</p>
<p>beforehand, and call upon every man in our ranks to support and be
</p>
<p>guided by them in all that concerns our Brotherhood.

</p>
<p>This document was very welcome to the three mentioned
</p>
<p>therein. Next to Stephens himself, they were the most
</p>
<p>pretentious members of the I. R. \\. In some respects
</p>
<p>they were more pretentious. He was not an able writer ;
</p>
<p>they were all able writers. Two of them, O'Leary and
</p>
<p>Luby, were much his superiors in education and social
</p>
<p>standing ; and the third, Kickham, was more than his
</p>
<p>equal in both respects. All three had considered them-
</p>
<p>selves aggrieved by his arbitrariness. They were jealous,

<p>too, of the preference he manifested towards such men as
</p>
<p>Step hens Visit to Amei'ica, 1864. 11
</p>
<p>Duffy and Rossa. But here they were entrusted with a
</p>
<p>power of which, once exercised, they could not well be
</p>
<p>altoi^ether deprived thereafter. More pleasing still, it was
</p>
<p>conferred on themselves alone. The vulgar Rossa, and
</p>
<p>Duffy, the stripling linendraper's apprentice, were not
</p>
<p>united with them. As Stephens could not but foresee, the
</p>
<p>document was carefully preserved, and effected its pur-
</p>
<p>pose most completely.
</p>
<p>"Stephens and M'Carthy," writes O'Mahony to a friend,
</p>
<p>under the date of March 25th, 1864, "arrived here (at New
</p>
<p>York) the night before last. They start for Chicago
</p>
<p>to-night. Your suggestion about the funds of the Fair is
</p>
<p>all right. I think that Stephens should make a regular
</p>
<p>requisition for whatever monies he may demand of us, and
</p>
<p>that the consent of the Central Committee should be given
</p>
<p>for its allocation to him. Without this, I will not be a
</p>
<p>consenting party to the granting of any very large sum. I
</p>
<p>have reason to think that he (Stephens) means to take off
</p>
<p>the proceeds with him  a thing which would leave us in
</p>
<p>the same struggling condition in which we have been
</p>
<p>hitherto. If this be done I shall instantly resign. I wish
</p>
<p>you would try and come on to Chicago towards the end of
</p>
<p>the Fair. It is a more important crisis for us than the
</p>
<p>Convention. The design of his (Stephens's) coming is
</p>
<p>obviously to usurp the credit of all done here during the
</p>
<p>last six months. His minions will go round in Ireland and
</p>
<p>say that, but for his coming, nothing would have been done.
</p>
<p>He will take all the eclat of the increased supplies .

<p>done and to be done. It should be given to me for approval,

</p>
<p>and be by me recommunicated to the Central Council.
</p>
<p>In your letter to Scanlan confine yourself to it, and insist
</p>
<p>on having the Constitution carried out to the letter. A
</p>
<p>man cannot come out here from Ireland to override it.

</p>
<p>accepts our acts of congress. / impressed upon liiui the
</p>
<p>ruinous effect of allowing any appearance of misunder-
</p>
<p>standing between us to be manifested in the organisation.
</p>
<p>He seems fully alive to this ; still I feel he would supersede
</p>
<p>me, if possible. He wants a money-feeder for the I. R. B.
</p>
<p>here, not a directing mind ; a drudge to do the work and
</p>
<p>never think. He makes light, or would make light of our
</p>
<p>Fenian organisation here  except in so far as it may seem
</p>
<p>a draw farm for the I. R. B. at home. To its doing so I
</p>
<p>will no more consent ."
</p>
<p>That O'Mahony was not wrong in his estimate of
</p>
<p>Stephens is but fair to prove. The proof is contained in
</p>
<p>a letter penned by Stephens shortly before this American
</p>
<p>visit. It is a letter which is valuable in other respects :
</p>
<p>" He (O'Mahony) is our standing drag-chain and stum-
</p>
<p>bling-block. The worst of it is that for some time at least,
</p>
<p>there is no remedy. Well, then, we are absolutely thrown
</p>
<p>upon our own- resources at last. The great organizer,
</p>
<p>statesman, patriot, martyr, sage, seer, or oracle has spoken,
</p>
<p>and bids us hope no more from him. And he announces
</p>
<p>this in a tone of levity to make a stoic shiver, actually
</p>
<p>launches what he deems a wit-shaft at us laughingly  * be
</p>
<p>wise and build no more castles in the air.' Even for his
</p>
<p>own sake one would wish to spare him the exposure of

</p>
<p>such lunatic fatuity. Doubtless he is building time-daring
</p>
<p>Stephens^ Visit to America^ 1864. 13
</p>
<p>castles on adamantine rocks. Lunatic fatuity is what that
</p>
<p>is, surely, for the stron<j foundations of our houses arc
</p>
<p>liere  and if these foundations should be moved to any
</p>
<p>purpose, then topples down the edifice he complaisantly
</p>
<p>claims as his, and too fondly gazing at while his eyes grow
</p>
<p>dim, and his brain is addled. I am sick, almost to death,
</p>
<p>of the man and his ways. While saying this, however,
</p>
<p>and that he has cast us on our own resources, I do not
</p>
<p>wish it to be understood that we have broken or mean to
</p>
<p>break with him, still less with the force he directs. This,
</p>
<p>though worthy of the insane fatuity we wot of, would be
</p>
<p>quite unworthy of us. What I wish to impress, unmis-
</p>
<p>takeably impress, on our friends is that, till God knows
</p>
<p>when, we have nothing to expect from the business
</p>
<p>yonder. I also wish it to be clearly understood that I
</p>
<p>attribute this to John's incapability, or, if you wish it,
</p>
<p>to that policy, that involves on the one hand, the assump-
</p>
<p>tion that we require but little, that it would be unwise to
</p>
<p>entrust us with much ; and on the other, that whatever
</p>
<p>our requirements, he is not bound, could not be expected,
</p>
<p>to try and furnish them. On this policy he prides him-
</p>
<p>selfi deeming it, if not God inspired, at least the golden
</p>
<p>fruit of human wisdom, ripened by magic dews and the
</p>
<p>stellar influences. To us it has been the barrenest of
</p>
<p>toadstools, one made loathsome by the dung of Puck.
</p>
<p>Lord, how sick I am of the man and his ways."
</p>
<p>Here Stephens gives a false account of the result of a
</p>
<p>demand for money. It was a demand which O'Mahony
</p>
<p>did not refuse. He merely required to know the uses to

</p>
<p>which it was to be put, and to receive guarantees that it
</p>
<p>14 TJie Fenia7i Co7ispiracy\
</p>
<p>should be used as stipulated. Stephens, for reasons of his
</p>
<p>own, never would give either such specification or pledge.
</p>
<p>In another letter to a correspondent, O'Mahony speaks
</p>
<p>thus of Stephens on the occasion of his visit. " Mr
</p>
<p>Stephens is never excited, and he can talk and reason
</p>
<p>as long as he can stand. He must be met by coolness
</p>
<p>equal to his own. It is possible he may inHuence Scanlan
</p>
<p>and Sherlock to come into his measures. He may also
</p>
<p>have a successor for me already in his eye. I feel that
</p>
<p>the gentleman in question docs not care into what straits
</p>
<p>he may fix us, if he can only bring a large pull of money
</p>
<p>with him on his return."
</p>
<p>A third letter, penned by O'Mahony at this period,"
</p>
<p>discusses the character and pretensions of Stephens at
</p>
<p>greater length  "Why did I give my personal influence to
</p>
<p>James Stephens, and set him at the head of my followers
</p>
<p>in Ireland .? * Was he a man of influence himself.'* No ;
</p>
<p>all his influence was derived from his being the authorised
</p>
<p>representative of the Irish Revolutionists in America ;
</p>
<p>outside this, and without being able to point to some
</p>
<p>known man or known organisation in foreign parts, I do
</p>
<p>not believe that with all his talents, perseverance, and so
</p>
<p>forth,. he could have organised one company of Revolu-
</p>
<p>tionists even in his native city, were it not that he had an
</p>
<p>Irish American organisation, and certain well-known Irish
</p>
<p>American leaders at his back.
</p>

<p>way of organisation, owes its origin to the Fenian

</p>
<p>Brotherhood here. Nay more, my firm belief is that
</p>
<p>if the Fenian Brotherhood were to break up, the Irish
</p>
<p>organisation would go to smash m a short time, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding its numbers. The hY^iian l^rotherliood is
</p>
<p>then necessary to IreLand's regeneration. Hence arose
</p>
<p>the question  am I, John O'Mahony, necessary to the
</p>
<p>F. V), ? To this, either my judgment or my vanity caused
</p>
<p>nie to answer  yes ; it would split up into factions here,
</p>
<p>without me. A large proportion of the men at home,
</p>
<p>who know only me, would fall off without me. The
</p>
<p>walk-easy nationalists, any one of whom has more personal
</p>
<p>weight with the general community than the C. E.
</p>
<p>(Stephens) would hail my withdrawal as the harbinger
</p>
<p>of the dissolution of the I. R. B. This is a sad fix to be
</p>
<p>in with a Central Council that would make me a sign post
</p>
<p>of a policy that the majority of its members do not under-
</p>
<p>stand. Ought I to remain in it ?
</p>
<p>"Again the Central Council expects me to approach
</p>
<p>O'Gorman, Judge Daly, and other prominent and educated
</p>
<p>Irishmen, with a view of getthig their co-operation. What
</p>
<p>can I say to these men ? Am I to ask them to allow
</p>
<p>themselves to be dragged tacitly after the car of the C. E.

<p>(Stephens again), whether they know it or not .? What does
</p>
<p>the Central Council know of the way things are carried on
</p>
<p>in Ireland.'^ What will it do when it does know  \( it
</p>
<p>ever does ? Is it not a fact, that no body of intelligent
</p>

</p>
<p>themselves to be hoodwinked, as the conduct of

<p>months seems to promise ? Are O'Gorman, Daly, O'Conor,
</p>
<p>1 6 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>&c., likely to submit patiently to a system of this kind ?
</p>
<p>Could I have the barefaced hardihood to ask them ? In
</p>
<p>popular esteem and position they are infinitely superior
</p>
<p>to the C. E. (Stephens still). In education and mental
</p>
<p>qualities they may claim to be his equals, for all the
</p>
<p>public knows to the contrary. Will they submit to bow-
</p>
<p>down blindly to the godhead of some great unknown,
</p>
<p>whom, however, some of them know very well .-* It would
</p>
<p>be perfectly ridiculous to ask these men's co-operation
</p>
<p>while our present status continues.
</p>
<p>"Again, I asked myself, are Kenyon, Martin, Smyth, the
</p>
<p>O'Donoghue, to be blamed for not joining a man (Stephens
</p>
<p>again) who would convert them into such blind tools of his
</p>
<p>will, as he (Stephens) seems to wish to convert the Central
</p>
<p>Council and the F. B. 1 At least, that such is his wish, his
</p>
<p>protracted silence respecting its address is strong evidence.
</p>
<p>The O'Donoghue, as soon as he places himself at the head
</p>
<p>of the Irish revolutionists, can sweep a third of Ireland

<p>after him, in spite of the C. E. Smyth, Martyn, Ken-
</p>
<p>yon, can influence the patriotic middle class. MacHale
</p>
<p>can lead the patriotic portion of the priesthood as he will.
</p>
<p>Are these men, with such great and latent powers around
</p>
<p>them, ready to spring to action at their call, to place it all

</p>
<p>ignores ? Who is John O'Mahony, and who was Michael
</p>
<p>Doheny, that the leaders of the Irish people should blindly
</p>
<p>follow their mysterious nominee ?
</p>
<p>" This is the thing in a nutshell, however it may be
</p>
<p>Scanlanised and Dunnised when the Council meets. It
</p>
<p>were easily met, did not the fact stare us in the face that
</p>
<p>this great organisation, which is our country's only hope,
</p>
<p>depends on there being no split in the F. B. How to avoid
</p>
<p>that, and save my honour and conscience, I do not clearly
</p>
<p>see. Dunn and Scanlan, and perhaps Bannon and Griffin,
</p>
<p>may think the thing would hold together without me. I
</p>
<p>have seen enough, even since Congress, to know that it could
</p>
<p>not under the present system. Not one of these gentlemen
</p>
<p>can give a reason for the faith that is in them (their belief
</p>
<p>in Stephens), if they discard my testimony and my in-
</p>
<p>fluence at home and here. These men (Messrs Dunn,
</p>
<p>Bannon, Scanlan, and Griffin) are at foolish work in
</p>
<p>getting me run down through the country. A word from
</p>
<p>me would blow them sky-high ; but, unfortunately, it
</p>
<p>would blow the organisation up with them.
</p>
<p>" I have been also asking myself, Is there another body of
</p>
<p>intelligent men of character and position in society that
</p>
<p>would submit to be treated as the Central Council has been
</p>
<p>treated by Stephens since its last session.? How silly
</p>
<p>it would look to the O'Gormans, &c., had they a glimpse
</p>
<p>of us behind the scenes ! I mean, we would look silly if
</p>
<p>we got no satisfaction from beyond the water ; for if we
</p>
<p>do  but I scarcely hope it  all will be well. Then, if
</p>
<p>you want these men, will you tell them lies } 'Tis not

<p>remedy this is the rub. By striving to make the F. B. an
</p>
<p>independent body what I have striven to make it since I
</p>
<p>first found out where its weakness kiy, and what it has
</p>
<p>really been made upon paper at my suggestion, but what
</p>
<p>the trick-o*-the loops * would fain ignore to practise  in-
</p>
<p>dependent action once established according to the
</p>
<p>Chicago resolutions, our charter, and according to our
</p>
<p>bye-laws, we can then approach any party whatever with
</p>
<p>clean hands and clean consciences. Will this independ-
</p>
<p>ence be vindicated by the Council ? Will we, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing our resolutions and our bye-laws, be still the
</p>
<p>cat's-paw of a man (Stephens for the fifth time) who has
</p>
<p>derived his power solely from me ?
</p>
<p>" But I have given you enough of my reveries. This
</p>
<p>morning's post has just come in, and I must attend to
</p>
<p>it. Pardon me for troubling you with these incoherent
</p>
<p>ramblings of my thoughts. There are few I (are to
</p>
<p>communicate with as freely, or to show how foolish I
</p>
<p>think myself. The thimble-riggers are striving to make
</p>
<p>me out a man of no ability and less account. The
</p>
<p>enemies of the F. B. will have it that I am a madman.
</p>
<p>Others will have it that I am a knave. If any of these
</p>
<p>are true, the F. B. is in a pretty fix. Time will tell."
</p>
<p>Stephens was at work immediately on his arrival in the
</p>
<p>United States, openly, that is, so far as the conspirators
</p>
<p>were concerned, in promoting the purpose of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ; in secret, in perfecting his intrigues for the over-
</p>

</p>
<p>the following passages of a letter written at St Louis, May
</p>
<p>the 3d, 1864:  " Monday night I attended a meeting of the
</p>
<p>F. B., and a very extraordinary meeting it was. No less
</p>
<p>a personage than the great originator and founder, under
</p>
<p>the assumed name of Captain Daly, was present ; and the
</p>
<p>full quota of members attended. After the minutes were
</p>
<p>disposed of, the secretary read a letter of credentials from
</p>
<p>John O'Mahony, stating who our distinguished visitor was,
</p>
<p>and the nature of his visit. Captain Daly, otherwise
</p>
<p>Stephens, was then introduced to the meeting, amidst loud
</p>
<p>and prolonged applause. The Captain is about my height,
</p>
<p>with a full whisker all round his face, and a head of very
</p>
<p>fine proportions. His face is handsome, but his eyes
</p>
<p>looked sore, probably from intense study and many a
</p>
<p>sleepless night. His voice has a very mild tone, and his
</p>
<p>accent is somewhat provincial. He speaks with rare
</p>
<p>fluency and clearness, and his generalisation of facts struck
</p>
<p>me as being remarkably forcible. I would say he is a man
</p>
<p>of great nerve, clear comprehension, irrepressible persever-
</p>
<p>ance, and undoubted honesty. His forehead is very like
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's.
</p>
<p>" He commenced his speech by saying that six years
</p>
<p>ago, when the organisation was first started, it was
</p>
<p>universally proclaimed that the spirit of Irish nation-
</p>
<p>ality was extinct, and the corpse laid on the dissecting
</p>
<p>table. Many mourned over the event,  many rejoiced,
</p>
<p>and many predicted that, after fifty or a hundred years,
</p>
<p>Ireland might at last get her freedom. She might come
</p>
<p>to something in the long run, and there was no use mak-

<p>ing any noise about her. The great majority of the people
</p>
<p>20 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>had sunk into a kind of apathy ; nationahty was sneered
</p>
<p>at by all, and a striking indifference to their fate seemed
</p>
<p>manifest in the people. For twelve months before the
</p>
<p>I. R. B. was started, he (Stephens) had travelled on foot,
</p>
<p>through Ireland, 3700 miles ; he mingled with all classes
</p>
<p>of people ; slept in the most wretched of mud cabins at
</p>
<p>times, and occasionally dined at the tables of the wealthy
</p>
<p>and influential."
</p>
<p>The writer of the foregoing letter gives rather a flatter-
</p>
<p>ing description of the C. E. ; but then he was an enthus-
</p>
<p>iastic admirer. Other people less prejudiced are not quite
</p>
<p>so favourable. The reporter of The Freeman sketches the
</p>
<p>C. M thus, as he appeared before the police magistrate in
</p>
<p>1865:  Stephens looks about forty-five years of age ; he
</p>
<p>is bald on the top of the head ; has long fair curly hair,
</p>
<p>and a long fair beard. His height is about five feet seven
</p>
<p>and a half inches ; he is broad shouldered, stoutly built,
</p>
<p>and muscular looking. His eyes are small, and are slightly
</p>
<p>sore, the expression is sharp and observing. Occasionally
</p>
<p>he indulges in a furtive glance. His general aspect
</p>
<p>indicates a man of some ability, with much resolution and
</p>
<p>coolness." TJie Express, of the same date, is a little more
</p>
<p>diffuse. " Stephens is rather below the ordinary stature,
</p>
<p>and stout and thickset, evidently possessing great vigour
</p>
<p>and powers of endurance. He appears about forty-five
</p>
<p>years of age, with a face that is at once pleasing, if not
</p>
<p>handsome, and a head indicating intellectual powers of no
</p>
<p>common order. It is for the greater part bald, the light
</p>
<p>almost auburn hair remaining thickly curled, and falling

</p>
<p>behind his ears, which, with his pointed beard, gives him
</p>
<p>Stephens Visit to Ameriea, 1864. 2r
</p>
<p>a peculiarly Yankee cast of feature. His eyes are small
</p>
<p>and restless, either from natural weakness, or the temporary
</p>
<p>excitement arising from the position in which he found
</p>
<p>himself placed. While apparently preserving the manner
</p>
<p>of a person of superior rank, there could still be discerned
</p>
<p>a determination and resoluteness of character in his face
</p>
<p>that quite accords with his antecedents." TJie Irish Times
</p>
<p>of the same period was as terse as The Freeman. ** Stephens
</p>
<p>is a man, fairhaired, clear complexion, bald on the head,
</p>
<p>with a large beard and moustaches, and his os frontis
</p>
<p>altogether betokening a man of good intellect and super-
</p>
<p>iority of character. His eyes, however, are small and
</p>
<p>weak, and from the furtive glance he threw about him, he
</p>
<p>did not at all seem to be in any easy position."
</p>
<p>This furtive glance was habitual to Stephens, as we find
</p>
<p>from the descri[)tion given of him by General Cluseret.
</p>
<p>" Little, furtive, blinking eyes, the expression of which
</p>
<p>continually escaped one," writes the General, "were the
</p>
<p>dominant features of Stephens's physiognomy, giving him
</p>
<p>a feline and altogether unsympathetic aspect." Again,
</p>
<p>Cluseret says,  " He was very clear and very explicit in his
</p>
<p>statements. He was an organiser to the finger ends, and in
</p>
<p>this respect he was undoubtedly a man of superior merit ;
</p>
<p>but he was vain, despotic, and overbearing beyond any
</p>
<p>man I ever saw." " Stephens was no more an orator than
</p>
<p>he was a writer ; he was, \{ possible, less of one. But in
</p>
<p>those vast human oceans, the waves of which have been
</p>
<p>lashed into tumult by passion, spoken words signify little;
</p>
<p>what the people want is a spectacle, and the sight of the

</p>
<p>idol of the day is always the thing that delights them,
</p>
<p>22 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>even if the idol be dumb or idiotic. Stephens, however,
</p>
<p>was far from being either the one or the other." So far
</p>
<p>Cluserc t. Add to these various descriptions, that tlie I lead
</p>
<p>Centre for Ireland has a large strong nose and a powerful
</p>
<p>jaw, and that his eyes are dark blue, that his hands
</p>
<p>and feet are remarkably small and well shaped, and that
</p>
<p>his voice is shrill and unmusical, and we shall have his
</p>
<p>portrait complete.
</p>
<p>As to certain statements in the St Louis letter, we have
</p>
<p>already proved that the Irish portion of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>began long previous to '58. Concerning the walk of 3700
</p>
<p>miles that is said to have preceded it, ourselves were in-
</p>
<p>clined to accept, and indeed did accept it, when beginning
</p>
<p>to write this book, as an event that really occurred. Since,
</p>
<p>however, we have seen reason to doubt it. We have no-
</p>
<p>where met with any confirmation of the story ; nobody,
</p>
<p>far as our enquiries have extended, has been able to men-
</p>
<p>tion to us a single individual who saw Stephens during
</p>
<p>that year of peregrination. The thing may be true, but
</p>
<p>Stephens was not a man who cared for truth. Two years
</p>
<p>later he repeated the statement, in the words here given, at
</p>
<p>Jones's Wood. It is just as likely as not that the story
</p>
<p>was invented for the sake of effect. Had it been true, we
</p>
<p>should have expected to find some variation between the
</p>
<p>versions.
</p>
<p>Mention is made, in the St Louis letter, of the creden-
</p>
<p>tials supplied to Stephens by O'Mahony. One of these
</p>
<p>letters, addressed to Daniel Keane, State Centre, Ottawa,
</p>
<p>Illinois, runs thus:  "Brothers, I introduce to you, by

<p>these presents, a friend and representative of the Irish
</p>
<p>Stephens Visit to A^nerica, 1864. 23
</p>
<p>Republic, who comes to us accredited by our fellow-
</p>
<p>workers in Ireland, and armed with ample authority to act
</p>
<p>and speak on their behalf to the friends of Irish freedom
</p>
<p>in the United States of America, Mr Daly's services in
</p>
<p>the cause of Ireland have been prominent ; his attention,
</p>
<p>talent, and indomitable perseverance, claim for him a
</p>
<p>foremost place among Irish patriots. You will listen to
</p>
<p>his counsel, receive him with the highest honour and
</p>
<p>respect ; consider him the truest representative of the
</p>
<p>I lead Centre in all its relations. Ireland can badly spare
</p>
<p>him at present, even for his short sojourn in America
</p>
<p>John O'Mahony, H. C. F. B."
</p>
<p>A copy of the foregoing letter got immediately into the
</p>
<p>hands of the British Government ; so also did many other
</p>
<p>documents. O'Mahony staled, in 1865, that he believed
</p>
<p>his treasurer, Killian, to have been in the pay of T. D.
</p>
<p>Magee ; and Mr Hefferman, his chief secretary, testified
</p>
<p>before the investigating committee, in the same year, to
</p>
<p>one damnatory act on the part of a very prominent member
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood. " I once found fault with Mr Rodgers
</p>
<p>interfering and whispering to my clerk on several occasions
</p>
<p>during business hours. I suspected that he had an ulterior
</p>
<p>object in view,  that Mr Rodgers desired to effect some
</p>
<p>object with which the H. C. was not conversant. Mr
</p>
<p>Kodgers took up the address book containing the Post
</p>
<p>Office addresses of all the circles in the United States. I
</p>
<p>was jealous that anyone should have the address book, be-
</p>
<p>cause I had, on a former occasion, unsuspectingly per-
</p>
<p>mitted this book to go out of my hands, and it had been

<p>used to the injury of the cause by the enemies of our
</p>
<p>24 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>organisation. I also found on one occasion one of tlie
</p>
<p>clerks copying the address book. He was copying it, he
</p>
<p>stated, by the authority of J. J. Rodgcrs." We shall have
</p>
<p>the occasion to give other instances of the ease with which
</p>
<p>the secrets of the F. B. could be got at by any one who
</p>
<p>had an interest in getting at them.
</p>
<p>During his stay in America, Stephens visited various
</p>
<p>military circles in the Northern and Southern armies.
</p>
<p>To enable him to do this he was supplied with passes
</p>
<p>by officers in high command. Thus wrote General
</p>
<p>Vi, F. Mullen of the Southern army  a member of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood  to Major-General Rousseau, commanding
</p>
<p>in Nashville, under date of May nth, 1864:  "I take
</p>
<p>great pleasure in commending to your kind atten-
</p>
<p>tion Mr J. Daly, a gentleman connected with the present
</p>
<p>movement to restore Irish nationality. I have assured
</p>
<p>Daly, as long ago I assured myself, that your sympathies
</p>
<p>are with poor old Ireland in her present state of national
</p>
<p>degradation and oppression. My friend will explain the
</p>
<p>object of his visit. Presuming on old kindness, I venture
</p>
<p>to ask for Mr Daly your kind courtesies. Any favours
</p>
<p>shown to him will be gratefully appreciated by your
</p>
<p>friend." A similar letter was addressed by Mullen to
</p>
<p>Major J. P. Duffisy, Centre of the Wolf Tone Circle, and
</p>
<p>commanding the 35th Indiana Volunteers ; and a third
</p>
<p>was sent by the same hand, and to the same effect, to
</p>
<p>Major-General Stanley, commanding the army of the
</p>
<p>Cumberland. At Memphis Stephens received the follow-
</p>
<p>ing pass : " Pass the bearer, Daly, for two days.  George

<p>E. Williams, District Marshal. This pass is not trans-
</p>

</p>
<p>fcr.'iblc." Another pass, dated the 19th of May, ran thus :
</p>
<p>*' Pass the bearer, J. Daly, through our lines to Cairo, by
</p>
<p>river. By order of Brigadier-General Granger. Good for
</p>
<p>five days." The last pass was given to enable Stephens
</p>
<p>to visit Fenian circles in the Southern armies, where,
</p>
<p>however, his stay was very short, and his presence un-
</p>
<p>suspected by the chiefs.
</p>
<p>Strange things have been done at various times by
</p>
<p>modern Governments in accordance with what they ca 1
</p>
<p>national purposes, but it may be questioned if through
</p>
<p>the whole course of the nineteenth century, even under
</p>
<p>the unscrupulous rule of the first Napoleon, there was
</p>
<p>anything so glaringly perfidious as the conduct of the
</p>
<p>Government of the Northern States with respect to the
</p>
<p>I^^cnian conspiracy and the friendly Government of Kng-
</p>
<p>land.
</p>
<p>How successfully Stephens intrigued against O'Mahony
</p>
<p>may be gathered from the following letter. It was ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to the C. O. I. R. by James Gibbons, State Centre
</p>
<p>for Pennsylvania, the very man to whom O'Mahony penned
</p>
<p>the confidential letters already cited, one of the very few
</p>
<p>with whom, as he stated in one of these confidential letters,
</p>
<p>he cared to " communicate freely."
</p>
<p>" I trust you will be able to get off on Saturday. I sent
</p>
<p>off a letter to Mr O'Rourke, calling his attention to the
</p>
<p>articles of the constitution regarding the appointment of
</p>
<p>the Council. I think there will be satisfactory men in the
</p>
<p>Centres of New York. The men to be State Centres should
</p>
<p>be of some standing. Therefore there would be less risk

</p>
<p>to any cause. There are some State Centres that might
</p>
<p>26 The Feiiian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>be dangerous. We have a Centre in this State that can
</p>
<p>hardly write his name. In the country places, our poor
</p>
<p>countrymen are hardly fitted for any but the hardest
</p>
<p>work ; men having communication with Ireland should be
</p>
<p>reliable and intelligent. We had a Centre in this State
</p>
<p>who stopped working when the bishop denounced us. If
</p>
<p>this man had communication with Ireland, where would
</p>
<p>be our safety ? With regard to Mr O'Mahony going to
</p>
<p>Washington, it is too late, and it is bad to have men led
</p>
<p>by the nose. I respect no man that becomes a rccruiting-
</p>
<p>serjeant for Abraham Lincoln. The Irish cripples in New
</p>
<p>York, and all over the world, will do good for Ireland. I
</p>
<p>am opposed to Kings and Queens except that of England.
</p>
<p>If I can serve Ireland, that is all I desire. I love my
</p>
<p>country and all her chidren, and I have no taste to see
</p>
<p>our strength wasted in a cause not our own. I hope Al-
</p>
<p>mighty God will send you safe to our people," &c.
</p>
<p>Concerning this visit to America, Stephens himself made
</p>
<p>a statement, in a speech delivered at Jones's Wood, May
</p>
<p>the 15th, 1866. That statement we cite. Generally, Ste-
</p>
<p>phens is little to be trusted. But here, speaking in the
</p>
<p>face of men well acquainted with facts, he was compelled
</p>
<p>to be truthful. *^ The Chicago Fair was announced, and
</p>
<p>shortly after an Irishman, who did good service in the
</p>
<p>cause of Ireland, was deputed to go from Chicago to Ireland
</p>
<p>to represent the state of affairs to us. Ostensibly, he went
</p>
<p>to buy goods for the fair and receive what we contributed ;
</p>
<p>but in reality he came and represented that nothing could
</p>
<p>save the organisation from ruin but my presence in America,

</p>
<p>and the committee in Chicago were anxious I should come
</p>
<p>Stephens Visit to America, 1864. 27
</p>
<p>else the organisation would fall to the ground. ... I
</p>
<p>came to the States. The gentleman alluded to is Mr Henry
</p>
<p>Clarence McCarthy. I asked him, among other things, if the
</p>
<p>whole proceeds of the fair would be placed in my hands for
</p>
<p>service in the cause of Ireland, and on his representations
</p>
<p>and piomiscs T came a second time to the States.
</p>
<p>" I promised my friends in Ireland, on my arrival in New
</p>
<p>York, to send them i^ioo, on my arrival in Chicago another
</p>
<p>;^ioo, and a week after my arrival in Chicago ^1000.
</p>
<p>The ;^ioo was sent from New York, according to promise,
</p>
<p>then another ^100 and ;^iooo from Chicago. For a con-
</p>
<p>siderable time I could receive no more money.
</p>
<p>" There was a State Convention held in Chicago at that
</p>
<p>time, and Mr O'Mahony attended it, as well as the Centres
</p>
<p>of the Western States. Mr O'Mahony, on being called on
</p>
<p>to say what was the strength of the Fenian Brotherhood at
</p>
<p>that time in America, stated that he could not claim more
</p>
<p>than ten thousand in it.* As my object in coming to the
</p>
<p>States was to collect money and receive arms, in order to
</p>
<p>bring the movement to a close, as soon as possible, I felt
</p>
<p>that, with so small a basis, I could not effect my purpose.
</p>
<p>I felt that in Chicago that night, and I continued to feel
</p>
<p>it for eight or ten days as I went through the States 
</p>
<p>through the towns of Illinois  and it was only when I got
</p>
<p>to St Louis, that I began to see my way, and felt that, if
</p>
<p>put in proper working order, the organization would realise
</p>
<p>all my expectations in a short time.
</p>
<p>"And here I may say that we never required much.

<p>2 8 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Those people who told you that I came over for two
</p>
<p>hundred thousand, or fifty thousand, or twenty thousand
</p>
<p>men, or half that number, knew very little about me, and
</p>
<p>still less about Ireland. At that time we would have been
</p>
<p>perfectly satisfied with a few men. All we then wanted was
</p>
<p>war material.
</p>
<p>"On my return to New York, I had certain changes
</p>
<p>to propose which were in my opinion essential to
</p>
<p>success. First, I deemed it necessary that Mr O'Mahony
</p>
<p>should have a Deputy Head Centre, an able business
</p>
<p>man, who could make good certain defects in Mr
</p>
<p>O'Mahony, for Mr O'Mahony was always opposed to
</p>
<p>making direct appeals for money, and it was absolutely
</p>
<p>necessary that these appeals should be made. He was,
</p>
<p>also, not disposed to go to strange parts of this continent
</p>
<p>when invitations were not forthcoming. The invitations
</p>
<p>did not come. Certain other changes I deemed necessary;
</p>
<p>and these changes effected an extraordinary improve-
</p>
<p>ment which very soon became visible in the organisation.
</p>
<p>" That which had real effect on the people of this con-
</p>
<p>tinent was, I believe, the statement I made to them in 1864.
</p>
<p>That statement was to the effect that the organised force
</p>
<p>at that time in Ireland was sixty thousand men  ^just six
</p>
<p>times the force of your legal open organisation in America;
</p>
<p>and I made the engagement that  if England ivent to ivar

</p>
<p>ivJicn the time for action would come. To the statement
</p>
<p>tlicn made, much of the progress since made is to be
</p>
<p>attributed."
</p>
<p>The Chicago fair realized some 50,000 dollars, at least
</p>
<p>so it was announced. Of this sum Stephens admitted
</p>
<p>that he received ^3000. From time to time he wrote to
</p>
<p>his lieutenants in Ireland, to the effect that all differences
</p>
<p>between himself and O'Mahony were nearly at an end ;
</p>
<p>this was merely to deceive them. Had the American
</p>
<p>Head Centre been a shrewd man, he could not but have
</p>
<p>foreseen the issue of the conspiracy. During this visit,
</p>
<p>Stephens actually told him  what he afterwards repeated
</p>
<p>in writing  that he intended to have himself arrested by
</p>
<p>the Irish police, if it were only to show how easily he
</p>
<p>could get out of prison. He meant it to be understood,
</p>
<p>that so many of the Irish prison officials were members of
</p>
<p>the I. R. IV, that not one of the gaols in the island would
</p>
<p>continue to seclude such a prisoner as himself beyond a
</p>
<p>very few days.
</p>
<p>During this visit to America, Stephens formed two ac-
</p>
<p>quaintances who afterwards attained much note. Against
</p>
<p>both he was strongly warned ; but, in spite of all warnings,
</p>
<p>he would persist in taking them into his confidence.
</p>
<p>These men were  John Joseph Corydon and Godfrey
</p>
<p>Massey. At the same time he renewed his acquaintance
</p>
<p>with another celebrity who was then a refugee, Pierce
</p>
<p>Nagle. These three were the leading informers of after
</p>
<p>days. Corydon, for a time, displayed great trustworthi-
</p>
<p>ness as a messenger between Ireland and the States.

<p>EVENTS IN 1864.
</p>
<p>During the absence of Stephens in America, matters
</p>
<p>went on in Ireland much as usual in many respects.
</p>
<p>O'Donovan Rossa continued to obstruct all meetings held
</p>
<p>by Irish nationalists who did not belong to the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood. This led to a good deal of rioting within and
</p>
<p>without the places of meeting. Often the platforms
</p>
<p>were cleared and the meetings dissolved ; and as often
</p>
<p>the redoubtable Rossa and his band wcfe expelled after
</p>
<p>stubborn fighting. Tht Irish People continued its in-
</p>
<p>flammatory style of writing with nuich effect. And the
</p>
<p>I. R. B. became singularly daringv Little or no attempt
</p>
<p>at concealment was made by them during drill. More
</p>
<p>than once large bands of them assailed and swept over
</p>
<p>passengers who refused to make way for them, when
</p>
<p>marching in military order and in broad day-light. This
</p>
<p>daring conduct had its effect on the more hot-headed. A
</p>
<p>good many concluded that the I. R. B. would never
</p>
<p>venture to act thus without very good reason ; that it
</p>
<p>was insolent indeed, because conscious that it was over-
</p>
<p>whelmingly powerful ; hundreds and thousands, therefore,
</p>
<p>hastened to join it, on the principle of adhering to the

<p>stronger side.
</p>
<p>32 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Early in the year, the O'Leary, known as the " Pagan/*
</p>
<p>was arrested in Mullingar. His first trial was resultless,
</p>
<p>owing to the disagreement of the jury. He was again
</p>
<p>brought to trial in July; and while the trial was in
</p>
<p>progress, a blatant orator of the Ih-othcrhood, speaking
</p>
<p>in America, actually proclaimed the real name of the
</p>
<p>prisoner who had been arraigned as "John Murphy."
</p>
<p>No apparent notice was taken of the folly by the British
</p>
<p>government. The Pagan was tried as "John Murphy,"
</p>
<p>and the jury agreeing this time to find him guilty, he was
</p>
<p>sentenced to seven years transportation. This was a
</p>
<p>heavy blow to the Brotherhood in Ireland, for with all his
</p>
<p>faults and eccentricities, Pagan O'Leary was about the
</p>
<p>best man that could be found for seducing the soldiery.
</p>
<p>His successor, Roantree  a gentleman of very similar
</p>
<p>spirit  one who delighted to have himself photographed
</p>
<p>in "rowdy" costume, with a bowie knife in one hand, and
</p>
<p>a revolver in the other  lamented the Pagan's fate in this
</p>
<p>elegant strain. " Well, the high-minded, spirited, Milesian
</p>
<p>Pagan is riffed at last in a rigg that should be made for a
</p>
<p>cowardly, sneaking, slavish, beggarly, convict, Papist cur-
</p>
<p>dog. I look upon the brave Pagans as lions and tigers ;
</p>
<p>and I look upon the Papists as mere cur-dogs." Roantree
</p>
<p>was a fair specimen of the Yankee Irish adventurers, who
</p>
<p>ultimately took such large share in the doings of the
</p>
<p>I. R. B.
</p>
<p>Stephens reached Cork in August 1864. That part of
</p>
<p>Ireland was then in fierce excitement. Various collisions
</p>
<p>had occurred between ultra-Catholics and ultra-Protes-

</p>
<p>tants, in which life had been lost on both sides ; and there
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 33
</p>
<p>was a wldc-sprcad feeling of alarm that these riots were
</p>
<p>but the prelude to an insurrection on the part of the
</p>
<p>ultra-Catholics. The affrays, indeed, were known already
</p>
<p>as the " Fenian Riots." The apprehension was not with-
</p>
<p>out good grounds. There is reason to believe that these
</p>
<p>riots were promoted by members of the acting Executive
</p>
<p>of the I. R. B., notably by Rossa. There was no doubt
</p>
<p>that the Celtic bands were headed by the leading mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the I. R. B. in Cork and its neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>Those riots wore proofs of the impatience with which the
</p>
<p>mass of the 1. R. J), saw action deferred. They were doing
</p>
<p>their best in this way to precipitate the crisis they desired.
</p>
<p>It is probable that, had Stephens delayed a fortnight
</p>
<p>longer in America, a rebellion, powerful in numbers at
</p>
<p>least, would have burst forth. As it was  he experi-
</p>
<p>enced the greatest difficulty in restraining his followers.
</p>
<p>It was only by hastening on to Dublin, assuming there
</p>
<p>his old despotic sway, and taking a number of strong
</p>
<p>measures that he succeeded. The whole thing displeased
</p>
<p>him much ; but there was another thing that displeased
</p>
<p>him more  there was not a single penny in the Irish
</p>
<p>treasury. The money he had sent from America, and
</p>
<p>the sums collected at home during his absence, had dis-
</p>
<p>appeared.
</p>
<p>There were dissensions, too, between the members of
</p>
<p>the executive. Luby was in London, lodging somewhere
</p>
<p>near Red Lion Square, under the name of Thomas Clark.
</p>
<p>For the time he had ceased to write for The Irish People,
</p>
<p>a circumstance which, and most unfortunately for that per-
</p>
<p>son himself, caused the engagement of O'Keefe. The

<p>II. C
</p>
<p>34 T^he Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>latter, as already stated, was not a member of the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood, though none of them wrote so ferociously as he. So
</p>
<p>fierce, indeed, were his papers, that iQ.\M of them could be
</p>
<p>inserted without a good deal of " cutting down," and many
</p>
<p>were far too atrocious to be published at all.
</p>
<p>Still Stephens pushed the extension of the organisation
</p>
<p>with all his old energy  visiting all parts of the country,
</p>
<p>and being attended on at every turn by a government agent.
</p>
<p>A specimen of the way in Avhich this was done, Detective
</p>
<p>SmoUen gave as a part of his evidence in the trials at
</p>
<p>Cork, towards the end of December '65. " We had a
</p>
<p>watch on him (Stephens) from the 23d of August 1864.
</p>
<p>That was when he returned from America. We reported
</p>
<p>every second day about his movements. We watched
</p>
<p>The Irish People office and reported them. We also
</p>
<p>watched and reported the drilling. Was doing so from the
</p>
<p>23d of August 1864. On the 13th of March last I followed
</p>
<p>Stephens from Dublin to Cork. I traced him to Myrtle
</p>
<p>Hill Terrace. I pointed him out to Constable Maher
</p>
<p>(of the Cork police). I knew him to be James Stephens."
</p>
<p>Mr Smollen was not alone during this trip, lie had
</p>
<p>an able coadjutor in Detective Launcelot Dawson. The
</p>
<p>latter, alluding to the same event, gave the following
</p>
<p>evidence :  " Remember having traced Stephens from
</p>
<p>Dublin to Cork. He lived on the Rathmines Road
</p>
<p>and left that on the morning of the 29th of March, at
</p>
<p>eight o'clock, in company with his wife. Got into a cab
</p>
<p>and went to the railway." Here Dawson made some
</p>
<p>discovery which induced him to apply again for the

</p>
<p>assistance of Smollen, who had by this time returned to
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. .35
</p>
<p>the metropolis. Smollcn accordingly returned to Cork on
</p>
<p>the 30th of March, expressly to watch Stephens.
</p>
<p>The Cork coadjutor of the Dublin pair gave the following
</p>
<p>evidence :  " Remembers going to a place called Myrtle
</p>
<p>Terrace in the month of April last, to the house of Mrs
</p>
<p>Thompson. James Stephens, the head centre, was
</p>
<p>pointed out to me by Acting Inspector Smollen, standing
</p>
<p>in Mrs Thompson's window. Saw the same man there
</p>
<p>several times. . Afterwards identified Stephens in Rich-
</p>
<p>mond prison as the same person. Saw a number of persons,
</p>
<p>like country farmers and Americans, going to the house.
</p>
<p>Saw Stephens at Mrs Thompson's from the 31st of March
</p>
<p>to the 4th of April. I saw him three times ; I saw him
</p>
<p>twice in the drawing-room without his hat, and I saw
</p>
<p>him returning in a car from town. During the time he
</p>
<p>stayed in Cork, I was watching him and watching the
</p>
<p>house." Dawson added  " Made Stephens' acquaintance
</p>
<p>on the 23d of August 1864. Paid him more attention
</p>
<p>than another did. It was my special duty to watch him."
</p>
<p>Thus, wherever he went  whether to the west of Ire-
</p>
<p>land (as with Duffy in the winter of '64), or to London,
</p>
<p>Liverpool, Glasgow, etc.,  he was still under the supervi-
</p>
<p>sion of the police. He was very well aware of the fact
</p>
<p>also. Nevertheless, though perfectly acquainted with
</p>
<p>their futility, he persisted in maintaining more ostenta-
</p>
<p>tiously than ever in the eyes of his lieutenants, all his
</p>
<p>elaborate precautions against detection. Never did he
</p>
<p>use so many disguises, or so many aliases, as between
</p>
<p>his return from America and his temporary arrest in

<p>36 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>But In maintaining tlicir cspionaf^c tlic detectives were
</p>
<p>not always allowed impunity. Smollen himself received a
</p>
<p>beating while watching Kickham and one or two others
</p>
<p>at a race-course. These attacks on the police, however,
</p>
<p>were trifles compared with those that took place after the
</p>
<p>fmal escape of Stephens.
</p>
<p>Shortly after the return of the C. O. I. R. to Ireland,
</p>
<p>O'Mahony expressed an intention of following him, which
</p>
<p>Stephens opposed with success.
</p>
<p>This year Stephens wrote from England as follows : 
</p>
<p>** There is an immense and plastic material here. Had I
</p>
<p>been able to give it proper attention, it might have proved
</p>
<p>quite as important as the Transatlantic branch. They
</p>
<p>must work very well as it is to be able to keep ahead of
</p>
<p>our English House."
</p>
<p>The C. O. I. R. was again in London early in April
</p>
<p>1865. On this occasion he left directions with Hayes, the
</p>
<p>London Centre, to give the names of his (Hayes') subor-
</p>
<p>dinates to nobody but Stephens himself.
</p>
<p>So he continued visiting all quarters, and exceedingly
</p>
<p>active everywhere. Shunning attention, however, beyond
</p>
<p>the circle of the conspiracy, and leaving small trace of
</p>
<p>his footsteps behind him ; above all, never penning ex-
</p>
<p>planations or narratives of his doings, as was always
</p>
<p>being done by his American colleagues. But by this time
</p>
<p>the I. R. B. wanted something more than his activity to
</p>
<p>prove to them that he meant seriously. Pike-making,
</p>
<p>therefore, was set on foot vigorously. As to other weapons,
</p>
<p>it does not appear the Stephens ever made a serious effort

</p>
<p>to procure them. All this he left to the various district
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 37
</p>
<p>centres, or, if applied to personally, referred his inquirers to
</p>
<p>such men as Brophy. His principal pike-maker was a
</p>
<p>young man named Michael Moor, by professsion a black-
</p>
<p>smith, really a very skilful artificer in iron. He was in all
</p>
<p>respects, except his connection with the I. \\..\\.^ an estimable
</p>
<p>person. He had been sent over from America in 1 863 by
</p>
<p>John O'Mahony. With some assistance he produced some
</p>
<p>three or four hundred pikes a month. There was a similar
</p>
<p>armourer cn)ployed at Cork  one who afterwards turned
</p>
<p>informer. There were others occasionally employed else-
</p>
<p>where. JUit the results of their united labours were of little
</p>
<p>value in the way of armament. In fact, the pikes which
</p>
<p>Stephens was sending away every day in small lots, to all
</p>
<p>parts of the country, were just devices to blind the I. R. B.
</p>
<p>He did not arm the I.R.B. ; he never meant to do it after
</p>
<p>the meeting of the Congress of Chicago ; and in this,
</p>
<p>perhaps, lies his only apology. He prepared the elements
</p>
<p>of mischief, and at the same time took full precautions that
</p>
<p>these elements should remain in a great measure harmless
</p>
<p>to the rule of England at least.
</p>
<p>In the speech already (juoted Stephens dismisses the
</p>
<p>remaining events of 1864 in a very few words :  "On my
</p>
<p>return to Ireland I found the work in a very good state,
</p>
<p>and the report that I brought back from America set the
</p>
<p>people at work still harder. But, still, the war did not take
</p>
<p>place, luigland fought shy, as she has often done since the
</p>
<p>establishment of our organisation. She did not go to war
</p>
<p>on the Danish question, and we had then one year more
</p>
<p>to wait."

<p>importance, especially that part of it which we repeat : 
</p>
<p>*^ England fojigJit sJiy, as sJie has often done shice the
</p>
<p>establishment of our organisation^ Stephens was perfectly
</p>
<p>right in thinking that the conspiracy he headed exercised
</p>
<p>much influence over the conduct of the statesmen, then
</p>
<p>directing the policy of England. It was not, however, of
</p>
<p>the kind suggested in his speech. His conspiracy caused
</p>
<p>little apprehension with regard to its success. But it was
</p>
<p>exceedingly useful to the economical personages then in
</p>
<p>power. No better argument for inducing a Cabinet to
</p>
<p>disregard treaties, and abstain from war in defence of these
</p>
<p>treaties, could have been desired than the existence of this
</p>
<p>wide-spread Irish conspiracy. It enabled our ministers to
</p>
<p>disregard continental complications from one eventful
</p>
<p>period to another, down to the close of the Franco-German
</p>
<p>war. It strengthened them in their policy with respect to
</p>
<p>American affairs, and it provided them with resistless
</p>
<p>arguments for such bold acts as the disestablishment of
</p>
<p>the Irish Church. Mr Stephens may have been aware of
</p>
<p>this ; his more intelligent followers saw it clearly  after
</p>
<p>the event. He, however, does not allude to it. But there
</p>
<p>is one thing in the phrase given in italics, which he hardly
</p>
<p>intended to say. He admits that England was sufficiently
</p>
<p>well acquainted with his organisation and its extent, to
</p>
<p>allow it to influence its policy very materially.
</p>
<p>If Stephens was reticent concerning events after the
</p>
<p>Chicago Fair, John O'Mahony was not so. Thus the
</p>
<p>latter continues his narrative of the conspiracy :  " Soon
</p>
<p>after the departure of Stephens for home I sent thither

</p>
<p>patriot, as my delegate, and postponed the convention,
</p>
<p>from November till the following January, in order to give
</p>
<p>him ample time to collect full and correct information as
</p>
<p>to the state of revolutionary preparedness there, for the
</p>
<p>use of the Fenian representatives, to whose judgment I
</p>
<p>proposed to leave the decision of the question at issue.*
</p>
<p>" I should have stated that, previous to the departure
</p>
<p>of Stephens for home, I had, at his request, appointed II.
</p>
<p>O'C. McCarthy as Deputy Head Centre. I did this in
</p>
<p>order to satisfy the * Men of Action ' here, on the one
</p>
<p>hand, and on the other, to show to Stephens that I meant
</p>
<p>to act squarely with him, in all things, by my readiness in
</p>
<p>taking a partisan of his own into my office. I hoped to
</p>
<p>find McCarthy a means of warding off the mischief that
</p>
<p>was then impending over the organisation from the con-
</p>
<p>flicting opinion of the leaders. I felt the less difficulty in
</p>
<p>appointing him as in conversations he professed to coin-
</p>
<p>cide in my views, and to deplore the unjust and hasty
</p>
<p>action which Stephens was pursuing in my regard.
</p>
<p>" Almost immediately after the promulgation of the
</p>
<p>summons for the General Congress to be held in January
</p>
<p>1865, the first open attempt at disorganisation was made
</p>
<p>by Michael Scanlan, of Chicago, who issued, in the name
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood, without any authorisation from either
</p>
<p>tlic Head Centre or the Central Council, a certain printed
</p>
<p>circular, which he designated ' A Final Call,' demanding
</p>
<p>of the Circles to make a final effort to collect money and
</p>
<p>send it to the approaching Congress by their several
</p>
<p>delegates. A copy of this document having been brought

<p>under my notice, I denounced it at once in another

<p>40 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>circular, which I forwarded to all the officers of the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood without delay. My denunciation had the desired
</p>
<p>effect in most instances, but I have had reason to believe
</p>
<p>that large sums of money were realised, notwithstanding,
</p>
<p>by Scanlan and his accomplices from some of the Western
</p>
<p>Circles. These sums were never sent to the Central
</p>
<p>Treasury. They were retained in Chicago, where they were
</p>
<p>afterwards employed with telling effect, in sowing the
</p>
<p>seeds of disruption.
</p>
<p>"By the middle of December ('64), Captain Philip
</p>
<p>Coyne, our envoy, returned from Ireland and reported to
</p>
<p>me. His representation of the home organisation was far
</p>
<p>more favourable than I expected ; but yet it did not, in
</p>
<p>my judgment, justify Stephens in having declared that
</p>
<p>* he would either fight or dissolve the Ihotherhood, in
</p>
<p>1865.'
</p>
<p>" Its effect upon me was to confirm me in an intention
</p>
<p>which I had secretly been resolving for some time. Hav-
</p>
<p>ing felt that open discord was inevitable between Stephens
</p>
<p>and myself, convinced that our only chance of success
</p>
<p>lay in United Counsels, and that any one programme,
</p>
<p>however desperate, if honestly worked out, was better than
</p>
<p>two conflicting ones ; I had resolved to resign, and thus
</p>
<p>allow Stephens and the Men of Action, who were now to
</p>
<p>bring with them the impatient and unreasonable rank and
</p>
<p>file in any case, a clear field for their operations.

<p>"While thus disposed, I received a letter from F. P.

<p>tion of a conspiracy for my overthrow and ruin, which had
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 41
</p>
<p>been devised by him while sojourning in the above named
</p>
<p>city, in conjunction with my deputy, H. O'C. M'Carthy,
</p>
<p>Micliacl Scanlan, P. N. Dunne, and others. Having read
</p>
<p>his letter, I went straight to M'Carthy and showed it to
</p>
<p>him. I said to him, " I know that the greater part of this
</p>
<p>letter is true. It is only the first few sentences which re-
</p>
<p>late to the private life and habits of Stephens that I believe
</p>
<p>to be false, and even these arc not the invention of Sher-
</p>
<p>lock, lie but believes what he has been told of him by
</p>
<p>others. Wherever he states facts of his own knowledge
</p>
<p>he is strictly truthful.* The Deputy Head Centre could
</p>
<p>not gainsay me. ' Now,' I continued, ' this man can smash
</p>
<p>you, Stephens, Scanlan, and the rest of you. If I listen
</p>
<p>to this friendly warning the Brotherhood will be broken
</p>
<p>up, for you have not another man amongst you, here or
</p>
<p>at home, that can meet and repel this attack. I meant to
</p>
<p>resign at the coming Congress. I will not do it in the face
</p>
<p>of this dangerous onslaught on our organisation. This
</p>
<p>man is my friend.' Thus P. T. Sherlock's letter had upon
</p>
<p>me an effect quite the opposite of what he intended. It
</p>
<p>consigned me for another year to the tender mercies of the
</p>
<p>Men of Action."

<p>I Icre we interrupt O'Mahony's more carefully considered
</p>
<p>narrative to fill in various blanks from various sources. In a
</p>
<p>retrospective speech, delivered in January 1866, O'Mahony
</p>
<p>speaks thus of the year 1864:  " In 1864 the activity and
</p>
<p>energy of the Fenian Brotherhood were redoubled. The

</p>
<p>three hundred, and with a correspondinfj increase in its
</p>
<p>financial resources. This enabled our friends in Ireland
</p>
<p>to spread the organisation of the I. Iv. V>. over a larger
</p>
<p>area. The C. E. visited us in person during this year, and
</p>
<p>inspired confidence and earnestness into every true Irish
</p>
<p>heart that came within the range of his influence.
</p>
<p>"Early in the following month (June), the late Central
</p>
<p>Council of the Brotherhood was convened by me, in the
</p>
<p>city of New York, for the purpose of taking immediate
</p>
<p>steps for carrying out the policy proposed at the Con-
</p>
<p>gress, and that of effectively complying with the require-
</p>
<p>ments of the C. E. I. R. towards securing a successful
</p>
<p>uprising of the Irish people within the year then current.
</p>
<p>However, when assembled, the great object of the Council
</p>
<p>seemed to be the passing of a series of rules to regulate
</p>
<p>the details of business, even to the most minute points.
</p>
<p>They appeared desirous of usurping and infringing upon
</p>
<p>all the prerogatives of your executive department.
</p>
<p>This was the first manifestation of the result of a secret
</p>
<p>conspiracy which I have since learnt to my cost had been
</p>
<p>for some time covertly corroding the heart of the organisa-
</p>
<p>tion. It had its origin in Chicago, and was founded by a
</p>
<p>man (H. O'C. McCarthy) now no more, though the evil he
</p>
<p>did has lived after him. Mr Scanlan was one of its most
</p>
<p>active members, and soon rose to be the guiding spirit of
</p>
<p>it. As such he has risen to the unenviable notoriety of
</p>
<p>the evil genius of the Fenian Brotherhood. The method
</p>
<p>of attack upon me by the members of this was dastardly
</p>
<p>and mean in the extreme. They began by corrupting the

<p>paid organisms of the Brotherhood, and converting them
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 43
</p>
<p>into itinerant calumniators of their superior officer." . . .
</p>
<p>"At this session was also passed a resolution in reference
</p>
<p>to sendini^ military envoys to Ireland. At it also was
</p>
<p>adopted an address to the C. E. I. R. Both gave offence
</p>
<p>to him, and both aggravated a misunderstanding that had
</p>
<p>been growing up between myself and Mr Stephens, a mis-
</p>
<p>understanding that had been increased by the mischievous
</p>
<p>intermeddling of malicious talebearers, who could not
</p>
<p>comprehend either of us, and who perhaps envied and
</p>
<p>hated us.* The originals of these documents are in the
</p>
<p>handwriting, and I believe are the composition of Mr H.
</p>
<p>O'C. M'Carthy, late President of the Central Council.
</p>
<p>Much stress is laid uj^on the difference of opinion be-
</p>
<p>tween Mr Stephens and myself, at this time." . . .
</p>
<p>'* I do not believe that any bad result has come of
</p>
<p>it, inasmuch as it has never prevented me from sending
</p>
<p>to my colleague all the funds I could raise in the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood."
</p>
<p>If O'Mahony really believed, as he stated, that no evil
</p>
<p>came of his misunderstanding with Stephens, it is clear
</p>
<p>that he was not the man for the position he filled. As to
</p>
<p>his co-operation, in the way of despatching funds to
</p>
<p>Ireland during 1864, the account given by other people 
</p>
<p>an account which is evidently to be trusted  does not

<p>speak very favourably of the Mead Centre's doings. The

<p>44 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>sation  published in January 1866. "The financial report
</p>
<p>of the F. B. was made before the Cincinnati Convention.
</p>
<p>From the report it appeared that the aggregate fund col-
</p>
<p>lected, from the time of the Chicago Convention to that
</p>
<p>assembled in Cincinnati, was 16,000 dollars. Of this sum
</p>
<p>only 6000 dollars were sent to Ireland, the balance was
</p>
<p>expended in this country in salaries, &c.' You can now
</p>
<p>plainly see what little practical aid was rendered by this
</p>
<p>supposed powerful society to * the men in the gap ; ' you
</p>
<p>can account for the chagrin and dissatisfaction that was
</p>
<p>felt by the C. E. in Ireland against the head quarters in
</p>
<p>America."
</p>
<p>This short extract hits off the situation exactly to a
</p>
<p>certain extent. Money, money, " dollars, and plenty of
</p>
<p>them," as Mitchell truly wrote, was the incessant de-
</p>
<p>mand of the C. E. He measured the value of the various
</p>
<p>circles at home and abroad by the amount of their con-
</p>
<p>tributions.
</p>
<p>In quoting the official report, the Chicago men were
</p>
<p>accurate, but still unfair. They admitted that the sum
</p>
<p>raised at the Chicago Fair was very large, that the
</p>
<p>greater portion was handed over to Stephens on the
</p>
<p>spot, and that the remainder was soon after remitted ; but
</p>
<p>they did not take this sum into account when mentioning,
</p>
<p>as a signal instance of O'Mahony's incompetence, that
</p>
<p>he sent but 6000 dollars to Ireland in '64. Counting the
</p>
<p>Chicago Fair takings  not less than 55,000 dollars 
</p>
<p>Stephens received over 60,000 dollars from America
</p>
<p>during that year. What did he do with it .'* The manu-

<p>receiving the price (2s. 6d.) of the article.
</p>
<p>We shall now return to O'Mahony's narrative. "The
</p>
<p>Convention assembled in due time at Cincinnati. Captain
</p>
<p>Coyne was on hand with his report. It was full, and far
</p>
<p>more satisfactory than 1 expected ; but yet it was not
</p>
<p>deemed to be altogether such as would justify the assem-
</p>
<p>bly in making a fmal call upon the Brotherhood so soon.
</p>
<p>A tax was imposed upon the organisation at large for the
</p>
<p>purpose of meeting the immediate exigencies of * the men
</p>
<p>in the gap,' as they were called, and ample power was
</p>
<p>given, by an unanimous vote, to the incoming Head
</p>
<p>Centre and Central Council to make a * final call,' and to
</p>
<p>issue bonds of 'the Irish Republic' as soon as they should
</p>
<p>feel convinced that the time for action had come.
</p>
<p>"It is important here to state that William Sullivan, ?.
</p>
<p>Bannon, James Gibbons, P. W. Dunne, and Michael
</p>
<p>Scanlan, all of whom became leaders of the subsequent
</p>
<p>secession, were among those that were nominated and
</p>
<p>became members of the Central Council on this occasion.
</p>
<p>From their position, and from the nature of the trust con-
</p>
<p>fided to them, they became as fully cognisant of all the
</p>
<p>facts relative to the state of Fenian affairs at home, as I
</p>
<p>was myself, they were virtually participant in all my offi-
</p>
<p>cial acts." Thenceforward up to the time when they
</p>
<p>seceded from and denounced me. Hence I could not
</p>
<p>deceive them.

<p>onslaught on the Fenian Constitution and myself on this
</p>
<p>46 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>occasion. P. S. Sherlock had got his above-mentioned
</p>
<p>letter printed, and had forwarded a copy thereof to nearly
</p>
<p>everyone of the four hundred and odd delegates.* As
</p>
<p>Stephens, M'Carthy, and the leaders of the Men of Action
</p>
<p>were the parties at whom the document was specially
</p>
<p>levelled, this threw the whole clique into consternation.
</p>
<p>The Central Council was completely nonplussed also.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for two days, the independent delegates, who
</p>
<p>knew nothing of our internal disputes, were canvassing the
</p>
<p>document and holding caucuses on all sides. A fearful
</p>
<p>storm was evidently brewing.
</p>
<p>To put an end to this state of things I brought
</p>
<p>the matter privately before the Central Council. It was
</p>
<p>there resolved that one of the Councillors should lay
</p>
<p>the whole letter before the delegates assembled, and
</p>
<p>propose an investigation into the truth of its several
</p>
<p>allegations. This course was adopted. The document
</p>
<p>was introduced formally, and it was agreed " that it be
</p>
<p>disposed of by paragraph," and witnesses examined upon
</p>
<p>the truth of each of its charges in succession. As I was
</p>
<p>the only person that knew anything about the truth, or
</p>
<p>falsehood of the opening paragraph, which related to the
</p>
<p>private life of Stephens in Paris, I was the first witness
</p>
<p>that was called. I was able to contradict them flatly, as
</p>
<p>I knew their origin, and was perfectly cognisant of the
</p>
<p>source from whence they had emanated several years
</p>
<p>before. Hereupon there was a general cry of indignation
</p>
<p>throughout the assemblage, and it was unanimously voted
</p>
<p>* This could only have hecn done by the direct aid, or the connivance of

</p>
<p>that the production should be "cast under the table," as
</p>
<p>unworthy of further consideration. This was lucky for
</p>
<p>Scanlan, McCarthy, and the rest of the Stephens men ; for
</p>
<p>had the following paragraph been read, where Sherlock
</p>
<p>spoke of matters that had occurred within his own know-
</p>
<p>lodge, 1 would have been forced to declare that 1 believed
</p>
<p>his statements to have been true in every particular."
</p>
<p>On the incident thus cautiously related, we have to
</p>
<p>remark that Sherlock's letter, and all the proceedings with
</p>
<p>respect thereto, were dictated by O'Mahony. He meant
</p>
<p>it not only to destroy some of his opponents, but also to
</p>
<p>win himself a repute for magnanimity. The first para-
</p>
<p>graph was inserted in the letter with the latter object.
</p>
<p>How O'Mahony could excuse himself for contradicting 
</p>
<p>for it was true and he knew it  we cannot understand. Of
</p>
<p>all the men connected with the conspiracy O'Mahony bore
</p>
<p>and continued to bear, among honourable men, perhaps
</p>
<p>the highest character. Ikit whoever joined this conspiracy
</p>
<p>was more or less demoralised by it, and more rather than
</p>
<p>less. O'Mahony did not escape the curse. His device
</p>
<p>was worse than useless ; that fatal first paragraph and his
</p>
<p>denial thereof saved the conspirators in America, exalted
</p>
<p>the character of Stephens, and destroyed that of O'Ma-
</p>
<p>honys tool for ever in Fenian opinion. The thing did
</p>
<p>more ; it still further exasperated Scanlan, Dunne, and the
</p>
<p>rest against their chief.
</p>
<p>So much for the most curious circumstance attending
</p>
<p>the Cincinnati Convention. For other information respect-
</p>
<p>ing the doings thereat we must refer to its published pro-

</p>
<p>three days, and was opened by O'Mahony in an address,
</p>
<p>in which the delegates were reminded that they were sur-
</p>
<p>rounded with liritish spies, and therefore bound to be
</p>
<p>cautious, and, as much as possible, secret. They were
</p>
<p>reminded also "that tlie Brotherhood was virtually at war
</p>
<p>with the British Oligarchy, and that while as yet there was
</p>
<p>no Fenian army openly in the field  such an army, never-
</p>
<p>theless, existed, preparing and disciplining itself for Free-
</p>
<p>dom's battles, ambushed in the midst of its enemies,
</p>
<p>watching steadily its opportunity, and biding its time."
</p>
<p>The last sentence being published in full, with a good
</p>
<p>deal more to the same effect, shows how admirably well
</p>
<p>O'Mahony was qualified to lead a conspiracy  secretly and
</p>
<p>cautiously.
</p>
<p>This exordium was followed by a vaunting sketch
</p>
<p>of the prosperity of the Brotherhood, and of its vast
</p>
<p>progress since the former convention. Previous to that
</p>
<p>assemblage the Brotherhood had lost largely in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of the numbers who joined the American armies,
</p>
<p>and were destroyed on the field. 'In consequence no less
</p>
<p>than fifty branches became extinct or dormant.' 'At the
</p>
<p>Chicago Congress sixty-three circles were represented,
</p>
<p>with a constituency of fifteen thousand men, one half of
</p>
<p>whom at least were in the armies of the Union.'
</p>
<p>" I see around me to-day," said O'Mahony in his
</p>
<p>opening address, " the centres, delegates, and proxies of
</p>
<p>somewhere about three hundred, making an increase of
</p>
<p>about two hundred and thirty-seven circles. The increase
</p>
<p>of our financial receipts has been in proportion to our

</p>
<p>increased extension. I can safely say that it has exceeded
</p>
<p>Events ifi 1 864, 49
</p>
<p>the sum of our receipts during the seven years that have
</p>
<p>elapsed since the Fenian Brotherhood was first estabHshed."
</p>
<p>O'Mahony went on to wish for a few blockade runners to
</p>
<p>prey on Enghsh commerce, &c. ; he did not, however, want
</p>
<p>the United States to declare war against England, consider-
</p>
<p>ing that the Brotherhood was quite equal to the task before
</p>
<p>it, and that a victory, aided by the United States, would be
</p>
<p>too cheaply won. Still, such a war he considered certain,
</p>
<p>and no less certain the s[)eedy and utter ruin of England.
</p>
<p>Then he spoke of the ease wherewith an army of veterans
</p>
<p>could be raised in America for service in Ireland ; but
</p>
<p>put it strongly that Fenianism was destined to be merely
</p>
<p>auxiliary to the I. R. B., in providing it with money and
</p>
<p>material.
</p>
<p>Then comes a paragraph referring to other revolutionists
</p>
<p>in Ireland, apart from the I. R. B., whom O'Mahony derides
</p>
<p>and denounces. " These gentlemen ignore Fenianism
</p>
<p>and I^^cnianism ignores them," declares the Head Centre,
</p>
<p>adding, however, " for my part, I would be glad to unite
</p>
<p>with them in working out Ireland's freedom, if they would
</p>
<p>give up public agitation and commence to organise an
</p>
<p>Irish army of deliverance in Ireland, after a business-
</p>
<p>like revolutionary fashion," After this address, really
</p>
<p>meant for Messrs O'Donoghue and John Martin, whom
</p>
<p>he takes care to name, O'Mahony goes on to recommend
</p>
<p>the forms which the Congress should observe to secure
</p>
<p>secrecy in its deliberations.
</p>
<p>" We must avoid saying more than is absolutely necessary
</p>
<p>of our allies in Ireland. Their names should never be
</p>
<p>mentioned except in select committees, where they cannot

<p>appointment of these preliminary Committees. A Com-

</p>
<p>Committee is exceedingly grave. It will have to examine
</p>
<p>accurately the credentials of every applicant for admission,
</p>
<p>so as to prevent British spies from coming in here, during
</p>
<p>our session, and not only British, but the spies of any other
</p>
<p>country. We had British spies and secret agents in
</p>
<p>Chicago, at our first Congress, though then weak com-
</p>
<p>pared . with our present strength. We are now a real
</p>
<p>power in the community, consequently there will be a host
</p>
<p>of spies after and around us."
</p>
<p>He then enlarged on the necessity of organisation and
</p>
<p>discipline. He dwelt once more on the recent extension
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood, stating, however, that many of the
</p>
<p>new circles were far from self-supporting, and consequently
</p>
<p>a drain on the general treasury, but that they gave a great
</p>
<p>acquisition of moral force to the F. B.
</p>
<p>The proceedings of the Congress, after the considera-
</p>
<p>tion of Sherlock's letter, included the approval of the
</p>
<p>report of the " Central Envoy to Ireland," V. Coyne ; the
</p>
<p>adoption of the Report of the Committee on Fol-eign

<p>They declared their most implicit confidence in the

<p>be held in our NATIVE LAND." Finally, addresses " to
</p>
<p>the Irishmen in America" and to the " Irishmen in Ire-
</p>
<p>land," were ad<)i)tcd. In these the organisation of Stephens
</p>
<p>and O'Mahony, under its various names, were recom-
</p>
<p>mended as the only hope of Ireland, and all other forms
</p>
<p>of association were denounced. " Treat all such move-
</p>
<p>ments with contempt," ran the address, " and by every
</p>
<p>proper means discourage and suppress them." We know
</p>
<p>that this was done, and how. We shall now return to
</p>
<p>O'Mahony's narrative.
</p>
<p>" Immediately after the Cincinnati Convention, the New
</p>
<p>Central Council adjourned to New York, where its first
</p>
<p>regular meeting was held. There P. J. Meehan, of The Iiish
</p>
<p>American, was admitted to the Central Council, and elected
</p>
<p>one of its members, and sworn in a i'\:nian, by the influence
</p>
<p>of H. O'C. M'Carthy.* William R. Roberts was elected and
</p>
<p>sworn in on the same occasion. Meehan, the first of the
</p>
<p>new recruits for the Brotherhood, had been one of the
</p>
<p>most envenomed opponents of the Fenian movement since
</p>
<p>1859, nor had any journalist on either side of the ocean
</p>
<p>done more than he to vilify its leaders and obstruct its
</p>
<p>progress, with the exception of his friend and confrere
</p>
<p>Alexander M. Sullivan, of TJic Dnbli}i Natioji. lie had
</p>
<p>more especially shown himself to be on all occasions, pub-
</p>
<p>lic and private, a malignant personal enemy of mine. I,
</p>
<p>nevertheless, most unluckily consented to his admission
</p>
<p>among us, at the unanimous request of the Central Council,
</p>
<p>* This was equivalent to saying that Median was really the nominee of
</p>
<p>Stephens. We shall place Meehan's version of the matter before the reader

<p>1 did so for the sake of reconcih'ation ; for, in the actual state
</p>
<p>of the organisation, we needed the aid and goodwill of all
</p>
<p>sections of the Irish National Party. Roberts I only knew
</p>
<p>as a rather successful dealer in dry goods, who had already
</p>
<p>made himself some name in New York as a rather fluent
</p>
<p>deckumer. Of his antecedents I knew nothing."
</p>
<p>Here it is right to place Mr Median's account of this
</p>
<p>matter. We have aheady given his relation of the
</p>
<p>reconciliation between himself and O'Mahony at the
</p>
<p>M'Manus funeral. "About the end of January, 1865, I
</p>
<p>was waited on by the members of the Central Council
</p>
<p>in a bod}^, who desired to know why I, whom they
</p>
<p>regarded as a Nationalist, like themselves, had so long
</p>
<p>stood aloof from tlie ]^>nian Brotlierhood, while agreeing
</p>
<p>in principle witli its members. I told the council of the
</p>
<p>existence of Mr O'Mahony's decree,* which, while it
</p>
<p>remained unretracted, was of itself a sufficient barrier
</p>
<p>against my joining the organisation. The information
</p>
<p>surprised them, and they declared their intention to in-
</p>
<p>vestigate the matter and see that. justice was done.
</p>
<p>" In reply I told them I had lived down the calumnies
</p>
<p>uttered against me, as their presence that day showed, and
</p>
<p>that I did not desire the humiliation of Mr O'Mahony,
</p>
<p>wliich must ensue if he were compelled to place on record
</p>
<p>the condemnation of his own act. More than that, I stated
</p>
<p>that I would not join the organisation if my admission
</p>
<p>had to be procured by such an humbling of Mr O'Mahony,

</p>
<p>as I thought the accession of any one to the ranks would
</p>
<p>be dearly purchased by an act which might, with good
</p>
<p>cause, shake the confidence of the members in the sound
</p>
<p>judgment and sense of justice of the man they had placed
</p>
<p>at their head. The President of the Council again re-
</p>
<p>peated that justice should be done, let the blame fall
</p>
<p>where it might ; tJiat the BrotJierJiood was noiv a representa-
</p>

<p>had reta7'ded its action and driven good 7nen from its ranks

</p>
<p>The following day I received a message requesting me to
</p>
<p>meet the council at 22 Duane St.* I went thither and found
</p>
<p>eight of the members in session. John O'Mahony was
</p>
<p>there also. Mr McCarthy, the president, stated to me that
</p>
<p>the council had investigated the circumstances of my
</p>
<p>alleged expulsion from the Brotherhood, had heard Mr
</p>
<p>O'Mahony's explanation of the case, and now begged to
</p>
<p>present me with the declaration of their unanimous

<p>decision in the shape of a resolution signed by all the

<p>members of the council. The resolution stated that in

</p>
<p>and injustice had been done aj^ainst a true and sterling
</p>
<p>Irishman, whose whole career proved his loyalty to the
</p>
<p>national cause, and merited for him the confidence of the
</p>
<p>Fenian Brotherhood. This resolution was officially signed
</p>
<p>and attested by John O'Mahony as Head Centre. It may
</p>
<p>be that the venom with which he now assails me owes
</p>
<p>some of its bitterness to his recollection of the censure
</p>
<p>with which he thus stamped his own deliberate act. If
</p>
<p>such be the case, he had the tact to conceal it under an
</p>
<p>appearance of candour, to which his late reiteration of a
</p>
<p>charge acknowledged by himself to be false gives a
</p>
<p>strong colouring of hypocrisy.
</p>
<p>" The council also presented me with a second resolu-
</p>
<p>tion stating that, as the calumnies uttered against me had
</p>
<p>been circulated through the PJicenix and other newspapers,
</p>
<p>I should be allowed tlie choice of any medium I might
</p>
<p>name for making public the act of reparation and justifica-
</p>
<p>tion they had just passed. I told them I was more
</p>
<p>than satisfied, and that all I should ask was that the
</p>
<p>matter should go no farther than that room and those then
</p>
<p>assembled in it. And there it should have rested had not
</p>
<p>the man from whom I thus averted the public exposure
</p>
<p>his act merited shown, by his present course, how un-
</p>
<p>worthy he was of the forbearance I evinced in his regard,
</p>
<p>and how incapable he is of appreciating the generous for-
</p>
<p>giveness of injuries, which is the noblest characteristic of
</p>
<p>manhood, as it is the test of true Christianity."
</p>
<p>We shall make but few remarks on this circumstance.

<p>It is clear from it that the Central Council hated and con-

<p>temned the Jlead Centre, and as clear that the Head
</p>
<p>56 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Centre deserved the contempt at least. Apart from the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, O'Mahony was, we bcHeve, an honourable
</p>
<p>man ; within it, we believe, his main object was the welfare
</p>
<p>of Ireland, as he understood it ; but he was at once weak,
</p>
<p>haughty, intemperate, and injudicious. He could not
</p>
<p>bend ; he could not resist ; he could not even restrain his
</p>
<p>tongue. His greatest weakness  fondness for power  led
</p>
<p>him into positive error,  made him, to a certain extent,
</p>
<p>hypocritical, cunning, and untrustworthy. lUit if we
</p>
<p>despise O'Mahony, what shall we think of the Central
</p>
<p>Council .? That they were not yet prepared to accept his
</p>
<p>resignation we shall shortly see. Why, then, did they
</p>
<p>gratuitously consult him, and to such an extent 1 If they
</p>
<p>did it of their own accord, they were mean ; if, as we may
</p>
<p>conclude, their action in this case was dictated by
</p>
<p>.Stephens, they were still meaner. What could come of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, however formidable in other respects, directed
</p>
<p>by such men 1
</p>
<p>We return to O'Mahony's narrative :  "At this meeting
</p>
<p>an address to James Stephens was drawn up, in which
</p>
<p>were set forth the particular points on which we required
</p>
<p>to be satisfied, previous to taking final action. It was
</p>
<p>sent to him in charge of a brave and devoted man, who
</p>
<p>faithfully executed his mission. It was resolved to send
</p>
<p>one military officer to Ireland with as little delay as pos-
</p>
<p>sible as our special representative, as soon as a competent
</p>
<p>one should be found. Colonel Thomas J. Kelly, on being
</p>
<p>recommended by me, was summoned from Washington,
</p>
<p>where he held a lucrative Government situation, and, on

<p>presenting himself, was examined by the council and

</p>
<p>instructed to settle his personal affairs in this country, and
</p>
<p>to put himself in readiness for his mission by the middle
</p>
<p>of March.
</p>
<p>" It was also voted that other military officers should be
</p>
<p>sent home after him, to aid in preparing for the Organisa-
</p>
<p>tion of an Irish army. The selection of those was left to
</p>
<p>me, subject to the approval of a standing committee,
</p>
<p>composed of H. O'C. McCarthy, President of the Council,
</p>
<p>William R. Roberts, and \\ J. Meehan, which three were
</p>
<p>then residents of New York.
</p>
<p>" It was further voted that a circumstantial report
</p>
<p>should be furnished each week to every member of the
</p>
<p>Council, specifying all monies received and expended at
</p>
<p>the central office, and all important matters occurring
</p>
<p>within the intervening time.
</p>
<p>"Again, William R. Roberts and P. J. Meehan were
</p>
<p>appointed a supervision committee for the weekly inspec-
</p>
<p>tion of my financial accounts.
</p>
<p>" All my subordinate officers, wath one exception, were
</p>
<p>chosen by the same council. Thus, it was utterly beyond
</p>
<p>the range of possibilty that either Mr Roberts, Meehan, or
</p>
<p>any other member of that body, could have been thence-
</p>
<p>forward deceived by me in any respect whatever.

<p>was first constitutionally established as one of the regular

<p>James Stephens. A batch of their officers was appointed
</p>
<p>58 The Feniafi Co7ispiracy.
</p>
<p>at this session, and their salaries were then and there
</p>
<p>determined by a vote of the Central Council.
</p>
<p>" The roll of the Central Council stood as follows : 
</p>
<p>Henry O'C. M'Carthy, late of Chicago, president ; Wil-
</p>
<p>liam Sullivan Tiffin, O. ; P. W. Dunne, Peorea, Ills. ; Wil-
</p>
<p>liam Griffin, Madison, Ind. ; P. Doodey, Holyoke, Mass. ;
</p>
<p>Michael Scanlan, Cliicago, Tils.; P. Pannon, Louisville,
</p>
<p>Ky. ; P. J. Mcchan, N.Y. ; J. (Hh])()ns, IMiiladclphia,
</p>
<p>Penn.
</p>
<p>"Of these M'Carthy, Dunne, and Scanlan belonged to
</p>
<p>the party of 'War or Dissolution in '65,' and professed a
</p>
<p>blind and uncompromising worship of James Stephens in
</p>
<p>all things. Gibbons pretended to hold the same opinions
</p>
<p>that I did, and subsequently gained no small share of my
</p>
<p>confidence, which he afterwards betrayed. Bannon was an
</p>
<p>ardent admirer of H. O'C. M'Carthy, whose lead he fol-
</p>
<p>lowed. Roberts and Meehan were untried men. The
</p>
<p>rest were seemingly in favour of caution and circumspec-
</p>
<p>tion. William Sullivan was the only man that I esteemed
</p>
<p>as a personal friend. With the exception of M'Carthy,
</p>
<p>Griffin, and Doodey, all of them subsequently got them-
</p>
<p>selves dubbed senators at the ill-omcncd Congress of
</p>
<p>Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>" Colonel Kelly was ready for his voyage to Ireland by
</p>
<p>the middle of March. I impressed upon him the serious
</p>
<p>nature of his duties to his country and the Organisation,
</p>
<p>and gave him written instructions to inspect professionally
</p>
<p>with his own eyes the state of military preparedness of
</p>
<p>the men in Ireland, and to report the same fully to me,

</p>
<p>that country.* Messrs Median and Roberts also had a long
</p>
<p>conversation with him. His first report came to us in due
</p>
<p>time. It represented matters in a most satisfactory
</p>
<p>li-ht."
</p>
<p>In other words, Kelly obeyed other instructions than
</p>
<p>those given by O'Mahony. From the time of his first
</p>
<p>arrival in Ireland until Stephens quitted the country
</p>
<p>Kelly was the humble and devoted servant of the latter.
</p>
<p>His report was virtually the report of Stephens. Thus
</p>
<p>Kelly accepted an employment dishonourable in its
</p>
<p>nature, from O'Mahony, however qualified in terms it was
</p>
<p>neither more nor less than that of spy ; and while pre-
</p>
<p>tending to discharge that office, he betrayed the man he
</p>
<p>affected to serv^e. A little later we shall find him similarly
</p>
<p>betraying Stephens, to take the place of the C. E. But
</p>
<p>when the antecedents of the man are known, not much else
</p>
<p>could be expected from him.
</p>
<p>He was born in Galway in 1833, being the son of a small
</p>
<p>farmer, who meant to make a priest of him. The thing
</p>
<p>was not difficult to effect in those days; we have ourselves
</p>
<p>seen a mendicant by profession, whose boast it was that
</p>
<p>he was " rearing his son for the Church ! " Such boasts
</p>
<p>were not unusual forty years ago  provided the subject
</p>
<p>were a suitable one. Such, however, was not the case
</p>
<p>with Thomas John Kelly. But thanks to his father's pur-
</p>
<p>pose, he, though found eventually to have " no vocation "
</p>
<p>for the priesthood, received a better education than other-
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>* This means that O'Mahony intended Kelly to play the part of spy, and
</p>
<p>would lead us to infer that Kelly accepted the office. The thing enables us

</p>
<p>distinguished himself by ability in his craft. We have
</p>
<p>heard that he distinguished himself even more in another
</p>
<p>craft, that of illicit distiller, and showed marked ability in
</p>
<p>evading and baffling the officers of the revenue. This
</p>
<p>part of his career, we need hardly say is not one on
</p>
<p>which John Savage, the panegyrist of such worthies, en-
</p>
<p>larges in his " Fenian Heroes and Martyrs."* At the out-
</p>
<p>break of the war of Secession Kelly, who had emigrated a
</p>
<p>little earlier, joined Corcoran's Legion. He fought gal-
</p>
<p>lantly, and displayed much intelligence. lie was in con-
</p>
<p>sequence promoted rapidly. He became signal officer
</p>
<p>in the army of General Thomas, with the rank" of Cap-
</p>
<p>tain, the highest he attained in the armies of the north.
</p>
<p>Mustered out of the service towards the close of the war,
</p>
<p>he obtained an appointment in the arsenal of Washington,
</p>
<p>which he resigned to serve the I. R. B. But to resume

</p>
<p>Concerning Millen, O'Mahony gave the following account

<p>on a subsequent occasion :  " General Millen, who was then

</p>
<p>after became an enrolled member of that organisation, and
</p>
<p>proffered his military services thereto, whenever and
</p>
<p>wherever they should be required. He remained in
</p>
<p>rei^ular communication with me, and was rcc^ardcd by mc
</p>
<p>as a brother "in good standing," and ready for activx' duty
</p>
<p>up to his arrival in this city, in the spring of 1865, when
</p>
<p>the Irish revolutionary project, then in course of prcpara^
</p>
<p>tion, seemed to be approaching to its culmination. ' He
</p>
<p>was not many days in New York, when he reported to mc
</p>
<p>for active duty ; and by me he was soon after sent to
</p>
<p>Ireland, with the concurrence of the Central Council. His
</p>
<p>instructions were to place himself immediately under the
</p>
<p>orders of James Stephens, who then held the office of
</p>
<p>C. E. I. R. B.
</p>
<p>" He was not long in Ireland when he was appointed
</p>
<p>by Mr Stephens, I'residcnt of the Irish Military Council, a
</p>
<p>body composed of Irish-American officers, principally
</p>
<p>veterans of the late civil war. He acted as such to the
</p>
<p>satisfaction of his comrades, till near the close of the year,
</p>
<p>when he was sent back to this country, with orders to aid
</p>
<p>in the military organisation of the Fenian expedition to
</p>
<p>Ireland, which was then in the course of preparation here.
</p>
<p>The unfortunate discussions and treachery which rendered
</p>
<p>that undertaking abortive, caused the resignation of
</p>
<p>General Millen, and he returned to the Mexican army,
</p>
<p>where he resumed his former rank and position of
</p>
<p>brigadier-general of artillery."
</p>
<p>How Millen was treated by Stephens, is told by the
</p>

</p>
<p>writes Millen, "was in Dublin, in May 1865. Instead of
</p>
<p>being utilised, I was kept in complete ignorance for a long
</p>
<p>time of everything that was passing. Complaining of
</p>
<p>idleness to Sle[)hens, I got an order to draw up a plan of
</p>
<p>a corps d' armee of 50,000 men in order of battle, with
</p>
<p>ammunition and baggage, every man in his place. Any
</p>
<p>military man will see the absurdity of such an order.
</p>
<p>Eventually I was named president of the Military
</p>
<p>Council, which Stephens thought fit to name ; its only
</p>
<p>duty being to find lodgings for the American officers. But
</p>
<p>while depriving the Council of the power of being useful,
</p>
<p>he circulated the fact of its existence, and thus drew money
</p>
<p>from the people. Many officers were disgusted in conse-
</p>
<p>quence, and returned to America. I told Stephens there
</p>
<p>could be no successful rising, unless England were engaged
</p>
<p>in war. Stephens excluded from his confidence, and from
</p>
<p>all influence in the I. R. B., every Irishman of good sense
</p>
<p>and ability. When O'Mahony's commissioners asked him
</p>
<p>in 1865, how the money remitted was spent."* * Oh, in
</p>
<p>organising!' was his rei)ly. 'Was there nothing further
</p>
<p>done with it.**' 'No; I spent that and four times as
</p>
<p>much raised at home.* Stephens never would give any
</p>
<p>details. He actually wrote to O'Mahony that he would
</p>
<p>get himself arrested after a certain time, in order to show
</p>
<p>how easily he could escape from prison."
</p>
<p>There is much of the real history of the I. R. 11 in the
</p>
<p>above short citation.
</p>
<p>As to Millen, he is identical with the General JMiillcii,
</p>
<p>who was, for a time, O'Mahony's War Minister, and who

<p>did a number of dubious things in that post. Whether he
</p>
<p>Events m 1S64.. ^3
</p>
<p>belonged to the Mexican army or not, he certainly had
</p>
<p>served in the army of the Confederate States. It was he
</p>
<p>who SLippHcd Stephens, then traveUing as "Captain Daly,"
</p>
<p>with letters of introduction to various officers.
</p>
<p>The Central Council, under the presidency of Mr R.
</p>
<p>Roberts, held its second session in May '65. M'Carthy
</p>
<p>had left New York in ill health, and died shortly after-
</p>
<p>wards. He took with him important documents be-
</p>
<p>longing to the I. R. B., which were never recovered.
</p>
<p>Respecting them, we find the following passage in
</p>
<p>O'Mahony's message to the Congress of Philadelphia in
</p>
<p>1866 :  " Important documents, the original minutes of the
</p>
<p>Chicago Congress, are still nn'ssing from your archives.
</p>
<p>Rumour has it that these minutes are in the- possession of
</p>
<p>a certain Mr J. W. O'Brien, now a reporter on the Herald
</p>
<p>newspaper, lie is said to have found them among the
</p>
<p>papers of the late Mr H. O'C. M'Carthy. Means should
</p>
<p>be at once taken to recover them, whether in his possession,
</p>
<p>or in the possession of Mr M'Carthy's relatives. They are
</p>
<p>worth money at present." What secresy or success, we
</p>
<p>ask, could be expected from an association, whose minutes
</p>
<p>were hawked about and mislaid in this way .-*
</p>
<p>But the principal disadvantage consequent on the de-
</p>
<p>mise of Mr M'Carthy, "arose from the fact that he did not
</p>
<p>acquaint me," continues O'Mahony, "with a certain
</p>
<p>address in Paris, v/hich Stephens had left with him, to be
</p>
<p>used in the transnn'ssion of all sums of one thousand
</p>

</p>
<p>" At this session a series of dcspatclies were read from
</p>
<p>Stephens, IVJiller, and Kelly, of so urgent a nature, that it
</p>
<p>was determined to send over as many officers as we could,
</p>
<p>without further delay.
</p>
<p>" It was at this session that the stipends of all officers
</p>
<p>detailed for service in Ireland were fixed definitely,
</p>
<p>according to rank, by the Central Council, and it was there
</p>
<p>also, that it was voted to give each of them three months'
</p>
<p>pay in advance on entering on his duty. This was but
</p>
<p>just and reasonable. It was judicious, also, considering
</p>
<p>the nature of the service. It was the joint act of the Cen-
</p>
<p>tral Council and myself"
</p>
<p>Mere we interrupt O'Mahony, to let some of the Irish
</p>
<p>officers alluded to, speak for themselves, as to the treat-
</p>
<p>ment they received, their statement being dated at New
</p>
<p>York, January the 20th, 1866:  "Our hopes for active
</p>
<p>assistance from this country were founded upon the Cen-
</p>
<p>tral Council, and raised high encouragement from the
</p>
<p>increase of power given them, under the name of Senate
</p>
<p>at the Philadelphia Congress, looking upon it as the har-
</p>
<p>binger of success. To remain in Ireland we have the
</p>
<p>alternative of living, or rather of starving, upon the
</p>
<p>organisation, without being of any practical assistance to
</p>
<p>it, or of going into a slaughter of the Irish people in a fight
</p>
<p>with sticks and stones. O'Mahony's unpopularity among
</p>
<p>the Fenians in Ireland, was most positive and extensive.
</p>
<p>He was blamed and denounced for refusing the necessary
</p>
<p>assistance to the movement in Ireland, when applied to

<p>by O'Donovan Rossa in person, when that gentleman

<p>innncdiate action, some of whom are now in poverty and
</p>
<p>at the door of the poorhouse.
</p>
<p>"We also state that we were told by the Military
</p>
<p>Council in Dublin, that this General Millen, that is now
</p>
<p>in New York, purporting to be the General-in-Chief of the
</p>
<p>Irish Republican army, and to be sent here to command
</p>
<p>an expedition, was expelled from the organisation in Ire-
</p>
<p>land, and compelled to leave the country. We are aware
</p>
<p>that, upon the arrest of Mr Stephens, Millen, without
</p>
<p>authority, assumed the supreme government of the I.R.B.
</p>
<p>and issued an order to that effect, a copy of which was
</p>
<p>read to us by the Centre for Cork.
</p>
<p>" We feel that it is our duty to speak out and tell the
</p>
<p>truth. We have no hope in the practicability of the plans
</p>
<p>of General Sweeney, as supported by President Roberts,
</p>
<p>and the Senate, if properly sustained by the people. The
</p>
<p>connection of S. J. Meany in any capacity with the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, gives the greatest dissatisfaction to the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood at home, and has done it much damage ;
</p>
<p>Mr O'Mahony knew James M'Dermott' to be specially
</p>
<p>obnoxious to Mr Stephens. Mr Stephens complained to

<p>us that his objections to a man seemed to be the best re-

<p>commendation Mr O'Mahony required ; that Mr O'Ma-

</p>
<p>stumbHngblock, and curse."
</p>
<p>The foregoing statement is an excellent commentary
</p>
<p>on the relations between the branches of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The immigration of such a crowd of Irish American
</p>
<p>officers could not but give great encouragement to the
</p>
<p>I. R. B., had they come as Fenians and nothing more.
</p>
<p>They did not do this. In nearly every instance they
</p>
<p>announced themselves, and were accepted by their country-
</p>
<p>men at home, as merely lent for a time to the conspiracy
</p>
<p>by the rulers of the United States, who, it was declared,
</p>
<p>favoured that cons[)iracy in every Avay, and would ])e
</p>
<p>certain, not only to recognise its adherents as belligerents,
</p>
<p>but to afford them substantial aid when they should appear
</p>
<p>in arms. There was not so much misrepresentation here
</p>
<p>as might be supposed. The following, we have been
</p>
<p>assured, is the substance of a conversation which took
</p>
<p>place between Mr Secretary Stanton and one of these
</p>
<p>officers, when the latter was taking leave of the former
</p>
<p>previous to embarking for Ireland : 
</p>
<p>Fenian, Good-bye ; I may not see you again.

<p>Fenian army, and may sail at any moment.

</p>

</p>

<p>only persuade Uncle Gideon Wells to lend or sell us a

</p>
<p>few iron-cl.ids, just to keep a port open for landing arms
</p>
<p>and brini^ing in prizes ; that would be all wc want.
</p>
<p>5. Now, seriously, until you are belligerents, in the
</p>
<p>British sense of the word, we can do absolutely nothing
</p>
<p>for you here. The moment your people are belligerents,
</p>
<p>either come or send to me and I shall have much to
</p>
<p>suggest and offer. England has taught us a lesson
</p>
<p>concerning belligerent rights which we have learnt at
</p>
<p>bitter cost and mean to profit by. We shall be as strictly
</p>
<p>neutral in your fight as she was in ours, and perhaps a
</p>
<p>little more so. Therefore, don't forget to tell your friends,
</p>
<p>sir, that while wc, official people here, don't want them to
</p>
<p>become belligerents against Great Britain, we cannot give
</p>
<p>them any material help until they are.
</p>
<p>This and things like it were carefully reported among
</p>
<p>the I. R. B. to meet with implicit trust. The consequence
</p>
<p>was that  what between the confident demeanour of the
</p>
<p>Irish Yankee adventurers, the reports they carried with
</p>
<p>them of American goodwill, and the countenance given to
</p>
<p>the adventurers, and their boasts by the Irish heads of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy  never did the conspiracy appear so hopeful
</p>
<p>and so popular, and never did it gain so many recruits as
</p>
<p>when it had reached the verge of failure.
</p>
<p>O'Mahony continues his narrative thus : 
</p>
<p>" A report from our representative was received in time
</p>
<p>for a session held in June. It was as pressing as those of
</p>
<p>General MiUen and Colonel Kelly. Jeremiah O'Donovaii

</p>
<p>68 The Fenian Conspwacy.
</p>
<p>tral Council that the time had yet come for taking- a step
</p>
<p>so extreme and irrevocable ; neither did he fully convince
</p>
<p>me. It was here that we resolved to send two members
</p>
<p>of the Central Council home, as * Plenipotentiaries/ for
</p>
<p>the purpose of deciding the question finally. The nomi-
</p>
<p>nation of these resting with me, I selected P. W. Dunne,
</p>
<p>as the most rabidly impatient and violent of advocates for
</p>
<p>'immediate war or dissolution;' and P.J. Mcehan, the
</p>
<p>most obstinate of its opponents.
</p>
<p>" liy this time a large number of American officers
</p>
<p>had gone to Ireland, many of them at their own ex[)ense
</p>
<p>and unasked.
</p>
<p>" I call attention here to a most remarkable fact in
</p>
<p>reference to the cause which has been falsely assigned, by
</p>
<p>the ' Genuine Dublin Centre,' as the immediate motive
</p>
<p>Avhich brought about the secession of W. R. Roberts and
</p>
<p>his accomplices, namely, of the deception practised upon
</p>
<p>them by myself, James Stephens, and Col. Thomas
</p>
<p>Kelly, with respect to the state of armament and general
</p>
<p>preparedness of our associates in Ireland. Both P. J.
</p>
<p>Meehan and P. W. Dunne, the plenipotentiaries com-
</p>
<p>missioned by me, on this occasion, to decide finally the
</p>
<p>question of an immediate fight or the further postponement
</p>
<p>thereof, soon after became most conspicuous ringleaders of

<p>si)()nsibih*ty towards tlieir country and their race that was
</p>
<p>ever borne homeward across the seas by representative .
</p>
<p>Irislmien. To them was confided the decision of the

<p>whole question of ' War or dissolution in '65.' To them
</p>
<p>was entrusted the affamation or denial, after a strict and
</p>
<p>conscientious investigation of the series of official state-
</p>
<p>ments which had been presented to the Head Centre and
</p>
<p>to their colleagues of the Central Council from that of

<p>Captain rhilip Coyne, which had been read at the last
</p>
<p>General Convention in the preceding January, to those of

<p>O'Donovan Rossa, which had just been laid before them.
</p>
<p>The amount of arms and ammunition reported in the

<p>possession, or in any way within the reach of what were

<p>called the ' Men of the Gap,' was to be verified by them,
</p>
<p>as also the reported extent, numbers, discipline, and

<p>determination of the organized revolutionary masses in

<p>this city (New York). It came in the shape of a letter
</p>
<p>yo TJie Feiiian Coiispiracy,
</p>
<p>from P. J. Median, dated at Dublin, Ireland, and addressed
</p>
<p>to W. R. Roberts. It purported to have been written
</p>
<p>after due examination of the position of the Irish Revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary Brotherhood. The principal Dublin centres, or
</p>
<p>"As," and such Irish American officers as were then
</p>
<p>resident in Dublin and its vicinity, had, in the first place,
</p>
<p>received Meehan and his colleagues at a general meeting
</p>
<p>which had been specially called by James Stephens, for
</p>
<p>the express purpose of satisfying them, and which was
</p>
<p>held at the house of one of the oldest and truest
</p>
<p>members of the organisation, who resides at present
</p>
<p>at Saratoga, States of New York.* Your "genuine
</p>
<p>Dublin centre" might perhaps have been present there
</p>
<p>himself
</p>
<p>In the second place, James Stephens, the Central
</p>
<p>Executive, and the chief officer of the whole Irish branch
</p>
<p>of the organisation, had held an important consultation with
</p>
<p>the said plenipotentiaries, somewhere among the mountains
</p>
<p>of Wicklow. The patriot martyrs, John O'Leary, Thomas
</p>
<p>Clark Luby, Charles J. Kickham, D. D. Malcolm, and
</p>
<p>Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, were among those present of
</p>
<p>the leaders of the "men at home." General V. V. Millen.f
</p>
<p>Colonel Thomas J. Kelly, Colonel Kirwan, Captain Condon,
</p>
<p>with others, were there on the part of the resident Irish
</p>
<p>American officers. These names, however, were not in

</p>
<p>Tlie missive above mentioned, which conveyed their
</p>
<p>decision, justified in the fullest extent all the representa-
</p>
<p>tions that had been made to me and the Central Council,
</p>
<p>by James Stephens, during the preceding twelve months.
</p>
<p>It corroborated him and sustained him in the most extreme
</p>
<p>of his demands. It completely verified the consecutive
</p>
<p>and unanimous reports of Captain Coyne, Colonel Kelly,
</p>
<p>General Millen, and O'Donovan Rossa.
</p>
<p>" From the time when Central Executive Stephens had
</p>
<p>first promulgated his edict for 'war or dissolution in '65/
</p>
<p>I never made one single statement regarding the condition
</p>
<p>of the revolutionary movement in Ireland to my con-
</p>
<p>stituents in these States, that was not in strict and
</p>
<p>scrupulous accord with the facts officially reported to me
</p>
<p>by these gentlemen. If they were guilty of deception, I
</p>
<p>was myself the most basely deceived of them all, while

<p>President Roberts, the other the most truculent and
</p>
<p>destructive of the plotters of the P^enian Secession 
</p>
<p>capped the long climax of the * deceivers.'
</p>
<p>" The report of these men conveyed furthermore, most
</p>
<p>urgent demands for the sending of three hundred ex-
</p>
<p>perienced officers from here to Ireland, money to buy
</p>
<p>arms, etc.  the arms to be got elsewhere. This was said

<p>a miracle. He intends going north ; but I dread it for

<p>him, as he is not strong enough to go alone. However,
</p>
<p>he seems determined on it. I am very sorry for him, and
</p>
<p>he will be a very severe loss to the organisation ; for he,
</p>
<p>at least, had good sense, and could manage those Western

<p>men. His mediation would be also most useful with the

<p>that there are few Catholics connected with it. Kickham

<p>Catholic belief. The fact that many of its writers are

<p>Events in 1864. 75
</p>
<p>anti-Catliolic \w opinion  coupled with these denuncia-
</p>
<p>tions of priests  does not look well. Besides, we should
</p>
<p>consider whether the paper is yet a paying concern."
</p>
<p>Here we see O'Mahony as he was. In another extract,
</p>
<p>this time from Median, we shall show him, as he was
</p>
<p>also, thoui^h hardly as he wished to be seen.
</p>
<p>" My first official act in the Council was to aid Col. W.
</p>
<p>Roberts in averting- a rupture between that body and
</p>
<p>O'Mahony, who had insultingly flung his resignation in
</p>
<p>their faces, because they refused to vote his henchman
</p>
<p>into an office with a salary of 800 dollars a year."
</p>
<p>Thus there was unlimited distrust, intrigue, faction, and
</p>
<p>imbecility in the ]''enian Brotherhood ; nor were things
</p>
<p>much better on the other side of the water. There the
</p>
<p>dissensions which had marked the close of 1863 ^^^^^ been
</p>
<p>renewed. The Dublin leaders were dissatisfied with
</p>
<p>Stephens on many accounts. There was plenty of
</p>
<p>"organisation," they admitted; but there was nothing
</p>
<p>else. They had men in abundance ; men were joining by
</p>
<p>hundreds and thousands in England and Scotland, where,
</p>
<p>for some months past, the conspiracy had been pushed
</p>
<p>forward with great vigour ; men were joining in such
</p>
<p>numbers that Stephens was embarrassed, as he admitted,
</p>
<p>by the glut of recruits ; but there were no arms. Above
</p>
<p>all, there was no prospect of speedy action  the thing
</p>
<p>for which the masses sighed.
</p>
<p>Then suspicion was at work among them. It was
</p>
<p>plain to the clearer-sighted that the Government was
</p>
<p>not quite so ignorant of their proceedings, or so utterly

</p>
<p>fain have them believe. There was also that question
</p>
<p>of questions  the money question. Ireland had given
</p>
<p>its utmost ; ICnglantl was bci;inninL;- to [)ay lavishly ; the
</p>
<p>newspaper paid ; and vague report  and here the i)eople
</p>
<p>had nothing but the vaguest of reports  raised the re-
</p>
<p>mittances from America to an enormous sum in the
</p>
<p>aggregate.
</p>
<p>The habits of the chiefs, or of the greater part of
</p>
<p>them, were pretty well known. Duggan, one of the
</p>
<p>principal centres for Cork, was probably the most pro-
</p>
<p>fligate man in the county. O'Donovan Rossawas riotously
</p>
<p>intemperate ; Luby was intemperate ; the " Organisers "
</p>
<p>were mostly debauchees ; in fact a capacity to indulge
</p>
<p>in all sorts of sensuality was a prime recommendation
</p>
<p>for the place of such a one. Men were best won over
</p>
<p>to the cons[)iracy when the restraints of prudence and
</p>
<p>principle 4^vere flung aside. The more thoughtful saw
</p>
<p>these things, on the part of the native officials, and they
</p>
<p>saw things as bad, or worse, on the part of the Irish-
</p>
<p>American adventurers. The majority of the latter richly
</p>
<p>deserved the character given of them by " President
</p>
<p>Roberts" in 1867. He describes them as "fast living
</p>
<p>men, who dined in first-class hotels, and who kept fast
</p>
<p>horses and faster women."
</p>
<p>But profligacy and extravagance were not the sole
</p>
<p>things in the leaders that attracted attention. There
</p>
<p>was peculation. It was seen that there were men in
</p>
<p>Ireland who well merited such a retort as the Irish-Ameri-
</p>
<p>can officers flung back at President Roberts, and with good

</p>
<p>one of these gentlemen in reply to the censure cast on
</p>
<p>liimsclf and his companions in the President's message.
</p>
<p>" He was a proprietor of a dry goods store in the Bowery,
</p>
<p>with a presumed capital of 5000 dollars. What is Mr
</p>
<p>Roberts now t He is the head of his branch of the
</p>
<p>]5rothcrhood, and has three stores instead of one, with a
</p>
<p>declared capital of a cpiarter of a million of dollars ; one
</p>
<p>store in the Bowery, one in Broadway, and one in Eighth
</p>
<p>Avenue." There was something similar to l)e seen in
</p>
<p>Dublin. Men who had been nothing in years gone by,
</p>
<p>had prospered marvellously since joining the Brotherhood.
</p>
<p>How men had become master builders ; journeymen,
</p>
<p>merchant tailors; penniless "doctors" had purchased
</p>
<p>paying businesses ; barmen were transferred into tavern
</p>
<p>keepers, and so on. The discontented were numerous.
</p>
<p>They had long been murmuring in no measured tones ;
</p>
<p>they met, as in '61, in truculent numbers, to arrange for
</p>
<p>action against their leaders, and especially against the
</p>
<p>leader ; in short, they deliberated about deposing Stephens
</p>
<p>and his clique, and establishing the long projected directory
</p>
<p>in their stead.
</p>
<p>There were some desperate spirits who went much fur-
</p>
<p>ther. Foremost among these was a Cork man,  one of the
</p>
<p>" Doctors,"  who has borne an infinity o{ aliases in his time.
</p>
<p>He was emphatically a "ne'er-do-well," as the Scotch
</p>
<p>phrase it. Of good family, well educated, and with first-
</p>
<p>rate opportunities, he never could get on. By the time
</p>
<p>the conspiracy had attained its most threatening phase, in
</p>
<p>1865, he, an early member thereof, after occupying fifty

</p>
<p>different positions in his profession, had fallen so low as
</p>
<p>78 The Feiiian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>to be a chemist's assistant in an obscure London suburb.
</p>
<p>He held, liowever, large sway over the London members
</p>
<p>of the fraternity, by whom he was elected to represent
</p>
<p>them in the Central Council sitting in Dublin. Here this
</p>
<p>particular "Doctor" manifested himself one of the fiercest
</p>
<p>opponents of the chief organiser. While others merely
</p>
<p>spoke of deposing, he suggested that the C. O. should be
</p>
<p>put to death. Nor did he content himself with suggest-
</p>
<p>ing. He actually formed a conspiracy to effect that (\iZQ(\,
</p>
<p>and would have carried it out too, had Stephens given him
</p>
<p>an opportunity. The Head Centre for Ireland, however,
</p>
<p>penetrated the design. He took care to run no risk from
</p>
<p>the Doctor or his merry men during the remainder of his
</p>
<p>stay in Ireland. And when he (Stephens) was about to
</p>
<p>return to Europe, towards the close of 1866, somehow or
</p>
<p>other this particular Doctor was put out of the way of
</p>
<p>doing much personal injury to any one for a long period
</p>
<p>by confinement.
</p>
<p>As the summer of '65 went on, Stephens and his lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant were at their wits' end to pacify their men. All
</p>
<p>the blame of unpreparedness was thrown on the leaders in
</p>
<p>America,  on O'Mahony in particular. The latter was
</p>
<p>maligned and denounced without stint, while excuses, very
</p>
<p>plausible in appearance, were given for short comings at
</p>
<p>home. Finally, the cry of "war or dissolution in '65,"
</p>
<p>was raised again, and louder than ever.
</p>
<p>A day for the outbreak was fixed ; it was to take place
</p>
<p>on the anniversary of the execution of Robert Emmet, 
</p>
<p>that leading idol of the modern Celt,  the 20th September.

<p>How well prepared the conspirators were for an out-
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 79
</p>
<p>break at that date is shown in the following short report
</p>
<p>made then by the Centre of the Southern Circle. " I have
</p>
<p>seven ])s., fifty-four Cs., and about four hundred rank and
</p>
<p>file, witli (mark this) five revolvers, fourteen rifles, and three
</p>
<p>hundred pikes." In this circle there was one revolver, or
</p>
<p>rifle for every twenty-third man, while more than one hun-
</p>
<p>dred and forty men were totally unarmed. And yet this
</p>
<p>particular circle was one of the best armed in the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood !
</p>
<p>Nor was America prepared to make good the deficiency.
</p>
<p>In May 'GG we find Colonel Thomas J. Kelly reporting
</p>
<p>officially to the investigating committee, then sitting in
</p>
<p>New York, that he had on hand 2,200 stand of arms of all
</p>
<p>patterns, 1309 bayonets, 1624 cartridge boxes, 3784 knap-
</p>
<p>sacks, 1 107 sabres, 3 officers' sabres, 131 revolvers, 420
</p>
<p>cross and waist belts, with a totally inadequate supply of
</p>
<p>other essentials, not enough indeed to equip 500 men
</p>
<p>partially. To this account was to be added, for 1865, 750
</p>
<p>bayonets, muskets, and knapsacks, sent on the expedition
</p>
<p>to Eastport, and captured by the officers of the United
</p>
<p>States, and which had not been returned up to the date of
</p>
<p>the Colonel's report. With such an armament it was
</p>
<p>manifestly absurd to think seriously of insurrection. There
</p>
<p>were many plans, indeed, for obtaining arms from the
</p>
<p>]Miglish enemy, partly by surprise, and partly by treachery;
</p>
<p>but nobody knew better than James Stephens that none
</p>
<p>of these plans could be carried out with any effect. He
</p>
<p>saw that he had conspired, and organised, and drained his
</p>
<p>dupes to the utmost ; that in this direction it was impos-

<p>sible to advance another step ; that his task was now to
</p>
<p>8o The Fenian Co7isph^acy,
</p>
<p>break up the whole thing with as Httle injury, in person or
</p>
<p>character, to himself as possible, and with as much injury
</p>
<p>as possible to his personal enemies on both sides of the
</p>
<p>Atlantic. How he did this we shall now recount. Here
</p>
<p>we must return to O'Mahony's narrative.
</p>
<p>" Such was the reading of the Meehan-Dunne report.
</p>
<p>It felled the already tottering ' drag-chain ' policy to the
</p>
<p>earth, apparently to rise to life never more. With so
</p>
<p>great an accumulation of testimony against my individual
</p>
<p>opinion, I had no alternative left, save to promulgate the
</p>
<p>* final call' without further delay, and to throw my whole
</p>
<p>energies into the * immediate war policy ' of Mr Stephens.
</p>
<p>I felt that the Fenian organisation was about to barter a
</p>
<p>system of action which promised certain victory in the
</p>
<p>future, for what was almost a forlorn hope in the present.
</p>
<p>The odds were then fearfully against the success of an
</p>
<p>immediate uprising in Ireland. But my voice in opposi-
</p>
<p>tion to immediate action would no longer be listened to
</p>
<p>by my associates. Not one of them would look at the
</p>
<p>situation as I did.
</p>
<p>Ever since the spring of 1864, the secret and sworn con-
</p>
<p>spiracy founded by H. O'C. M'Carthy, and lately directed
</p>
<p>by Central Councillors Scanlan and Dunne, had been
</p>
<p>covertly poisoning the organisation against me, sometimes
</p>
<p>assailing me on the ground of incapacity, sometimes
</p>
<p>on the desertion of James Stephens and the men in the
</p>
<p>gap, their real motive being, because I would neither tell
</p>
<p>falsehoods, nor make rash promises for the purposes of

<p>Events in 1864. Zi
</p>
<p>some cliicancry got command of the secret fund in
</p>
<p>Chicago, whereby they were enabled to send out emis-
</p>
<p>saries on all sides to undermine and calumniate me.
</p>
<p>Their effect on the Brotherhood had been so to raise its
</p>
<p>liopes, by exaggerated representations of the talents of
</p>
<p>James Stephens, and the numbers, courage, and resources
</p>
<p>of the men in the gap, that its members would no longer
</p>
<p>listen to reason. Falsehoods had been scattered round
</p>
<p>wholesale, and indiscreet disclosures had been made by
</p>
<p>a good many of the ' paid organisers,' who had been
</p>
<p>appointed by the Central Council to praise up James
</p>
<p>Stephens and his work, and to belittle me and mine.
</p>
<p>Whenever I discovered them at their base tricks  for most
</p>
<p>of this was done underhand  and brought them to account
</p>
<p>therefor, my interference was represented through the
</p>
<p>secret machinery, manipulated by Scanlan and Dunne, as
</p>
<p>* pusillanimity,' 'incompetence,' 'treachery,' or 'deser-
</p>
<p>tion of Stephens and the men in the gap,' the use of
</p>
<p>whose names did effective service in the work of disin-
</p>
<p>tegration for a considerable time, and subsequently
</p>
<p>furnished their rallying cry to the * Senatorial Seceders.'
</p>
<p>Some of these stealthy poisoners of my reputation I dis-
</p>
<p>covered and dismissed ; but they were taken up by the
</p>
<p>Chicago conspirators, and maintained by them out of the
</p>
<p>above-mentioned 'secrcl fund,' which 'Senator' Michael
</p>
<p>Scanlan had irregularly and corruptly retained in that
</p>
<p>city, so that their career of mischief and demoralisation
</p>
<p>went (Ml, in spite of me, with scarce an interruption.

</p>
<p>Here we interrupt O'Mahony to remark, that all this
</p>
<p>apology for his own conduct amounts to nothing. For
</p>
<p>him to have remained the ostensible Head Centre, after all
</p>
<p>controlling power had departed from him, was criminal.
</p>
<p>It was the criminality of weakness, we admit; but, under
</p>
<p>such circumstances, a weak man is more mischievous than
</p>
<p>a vile one. Had O'Mahony abdicated, as he ought to have
</p>
<p>done, immediately after the Cincinnati Congress, and his
</p>
<p>discovery of his own helplessness, he would have prevented
</p>
<p>a multitude of evils. But, by remaining the nominal
</p>
<p>Head Centre, until he was expelled from the post under
</p>
<p>circumstances that involved him, the weak tool, in the
</p>
<p>same disgrace as the deliberately culpable, he enabled
</p>
<p>swindlers and desperadoes to fleece the Irish race, in
</p>
<p>America and in Europe, and to carry on the conspiracy to
</p>
<p>the very last gasp, until it sank into utter helplessness,
</p>
<p>making it a pretext for buccaneering and assassination,
</p>
<p>and rendering its name a term of odium. We have heard
</p>
<p>ardent Irishmen repudiate the name of " Fenian " as

<p>O'Mahony made the " final call " under circumstances
</p>
<p>eminently shameful to the "plenipotentiaries," and espe-
</p>
<p>cially to James Stephens and his lieutenants. A circum-
</p>
<p>stance had occurred in Ireland which must have rendered
</p>
<p>the conspiracy something like desperate even in their
</p>
<p>eyes. This circumstance was carefully suppressed ; nothing"
</p>
<p>but what was glowing was allowed to enter the reports 
</p>
<p>until the "call" had been made. Then the evil was dis-
</p>
<p>closed  to O'Mahony's consternation. What the circum-
</p>
<p>stance was, and how it happened, wc leave the principal
</p>
<p>actors to relate  beginning with O'Donovan Rossa.
</p>
<p>"On the 24th of June '65, I left the Cove of Cork for
</p>
<p>New York. I took with me despatches from James
</p>
<p>Stephens to John O'Mahony. When I arrived on the 5th
</p>
<p>of July, I learnt that Mr P. J. Meehan and Mr P. W. Dunne
</p>
<p>were going to Ireland on business connected with the
</p>
<p>organisation. They were to examine into things on the
</p>
<p>other side, and were to report faithfully. A meeting of
</p>
<p>the Council of the P^enian Brotherhood was held at the
</p>
<p>house of Mr W. R. Roberts, at which I attended, and
</p>
<p>heard read the despatches I had brought. This is not the
</p>
<p>place to tell what passed there.
</p>
<p>" Mr Meehan and Mr Dunn were to sail on the 12th, and
</p>
<p>as I had my business done, I determined to sail with them.
</p>
<p>John O'Mahony wanted to keep me in New York, as he
</p>
<p>said many inquiries were made about Ireland which he
</p>
<p>couKl not answer, and my being in the office would do much
</p>
<p>good. I told him I would not stay for any consideration,
</p>
<p>as I had no instructions on that head. lie asked me to

</p>
<p>Stephens and have a reply ; but this I would not do. I
</p>
<p>was strongly of opinion that there was to be a fight in
</p>
<p>Ireland. Now, I do not say that I was mad to be first in
</p>
<p>that fight ; perhaps in cool blood I might think myself
</p>
<p>safer out of it ; but I was anxious to stick up to my own
</p>
<p>expressions and to what people expected from me, and
</p>
<p>that was not to be safely out of the way when there was
</p>
<p>any danger around. I have not extraordinary fighting
</p>
<p>courage, nor would I feel warranted in rushing into dangers
</p>
<p>because my friends may think I would {sic) do so ; but
</p>
<p>when I commit myself to a thing I like to act up to it. I
</p>
<p>knew I had committed myself to be in the fight in Ireland,
</p>
<p>and I would not give it to any one to say that I was safe
</p>
<p>in America while it was going on.
</p>
<p>"John O'Mahony told me that, as I would not stay, he
</p>
<p>would give me a note that would send me- back as soon
</p>
<p>as I handed it to Stephens. But I told him that I would
</p>
<p>not be the bearer of any note complimentary to myself,
</p>
<p>and refused to take it.
</p>
<p>"'Then,' said he, 'I will send it by the others, and
</p>
<p>Patrick will take it down.*
</p>
<p>" I was on board the Cuba when Patrick J. Downey
</p>
<p>came alongside on the tender and handed me the note,
</p>
<p>which I handed to P. J. Median.*
</p>
<p>" Something has been said of John O'Mahony having
</p>
<p>refused to pay my passage back to Ireland, and that it was
</p>
<p>P. J. Mechan paid {sic) it, part of which is true and part false.

<p>enough to make Stephens suspect Kossa.
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 85
</p>
<p>John O'Mahony did not refuse to pay my passage, but it
</p>
<p>was stated to me by P. W. Dunne, in O'Mahony's presence,
</p>
<p>tliat the party going to Ireland liad engaged one passage
</p>
<p>more than they wanted, and that I would fit in there. And
</p>
<p>after I gave Colonel Downing's message to P. J. Meehan,
</p>
<p>he took me to the purser of the ship and paid for my
</p>
<p>passage. This money, of course, I looked upon as Fenian
</p>
<p>money, for I knew that Mr Median was the bearer of
</p>
<p>funds to Ireland.
</p>
<p>*' Going into the Cove of Cork, I told Mr Meehan that,
</p>
<p>as I left Ireland in a troublous state, not knowing but
</p>
<p>that there may (sic) be a rigorous search on landing, it
</p>
<p>would be well for him to give those papers he had to his
</p>
<p>sister, or to Mrs Dunne, who accompanied us. He told
</p>
<p>me that they were all right, that he had them sewed up
</p>
<p>between the .soles of one of his carpet-slippers. Next
</p>
<p>day he lost these papers in Kingstown, where he went to
</p>
<p>deliver them to James Stephens. Pursuant to the caution
</p>
<p>given him, and to his own promptings, he thought it
</p>
<p>better not to have those papers in any pocket of his, and
</p>
<p>he fastened them with a pin, as he told us, inside the
</p>
<p>waistband of his drawers. The pin slipped out, and the
</p>
<p>letters slipped away from him unknown to him. The
</p>
<p>charge has been made against him that he lost these
</p>
<p>documents intentionally, and much contention has, I
</p>
<p>understand, been in America about them. All I say is,
</p>
<p>that the malter was discussed at a Council meeting in
</p>
<p>Dublin, that he lost them honestly, and that I have no
</p>
<p>evidence since to warrant me in changing that opinion.

</p>
<p>matters; it is only right for mc to say so much of him
</p>
<p>on this."
</p>
<p>Now we sliall see wliat Steplicns lilmsclf says about
</p>
<p>this affair, and indeed of the whole of '65, so far.
</p>
<p>" You held your Cincinnati convention "  Stephens is
</p>
<p>speaking in America in '66  "and about that time I
</p>
<p>wrote, asking, for the months of January, February, and
</p>
<p>March, ;^iooo. I stated I would require for the month of
</p>
<p>April alone ;^ICX)0, and for the months of May, June,
</p>
<p>July, and August, about ;{^2 500 a month. The money for
</p>
<p>January, February, and March was sent to me  about
</p>
<p>^1000. Another ^1000 was sent to me in April; but I
</p>
<p>did not get the second instalment till the middle of May ;
</p>
<p>and of the money for May, June, July, and August, I got
</p>
<p>none. Instead of getting the money I asked for, and
</p>
<p>which would have enabled me to take the field last year,
</p>
<p>two gentlemen were appointed here to go to Ireland to
</p>
<p>investigate our work. They were perfectly satisfied with
</p>
<p>the state of affairs in Ireland. They sent over a very
</p>
<p>favourable report, and asked for money to be sent back to
</p>
<p>us. It was agreed on at that time, that the bonds of the
</p>
<p>Irish Republic should be issued on their return. It was
</p>
<p>calculated we should have all that was requisite by
</p>
<p>the close of the year.
</p>
<p>" It so happened that one of the delegates, while in
</p>
<p>Ireland, lost certain documents. This was Mr Meehan.
</p>
<p>Now, I don't wish to say one word disparagingly of
</p>
<p>him to-day ; neither do I wish that any friend of
</p>
<p>mine should do so ; but while desirous of not saying

<p>anything against him, it is necessary that the fact should
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. %"]
</p>
<p>be known, that the loss of these documents was the
</p>
<p>immediate occasion of the arrests in Ireland. I have
</p>
<p>myself written against him, and if I have wronged him I
</p>
<p>would be very happy to make him ample reparation  if
</p>
<p>he will only favour me with a visit. I have sent invita-
</p>
<p>tiojis to all those gentlemen  General Sweeney, Mr
</p>
<p>Roberts, and Mr JMeehan  to all those gentlemen to come
</p>
<p>and see me ; but very few of them have come, I am sorry
</p>
<p>to say. Well, the arrests were m.ade."
</p>
<p>After his speech Stephens submitted to be questioned ;
</p>
<p>and among the questions put and the answers given were
</p>
<p>these :  " Was it through your influence that V. J. Meelian
</p>
<p>escaped assassination from the Irishmen in Ireland?" " I
</p>
<p>have to say that, on three different occasions, he was saved
</p>
<p>from a traitor's death by my influence. There is not a man
</p>
<p>in Ireland who does not believe that Mr Meehan knew
</p>
<p>when and where he lost these documents. The documents,
</p>
<p>simple in themselves, were the immediate cause of the
</p>
<p>arrests." " Please to explain the nature of the documents
</p>
<p>lost by Meehan, and the people compromised } " " That
</p>
<p>is as easy as A, B, C. The nature was that I was
</p>
<p>addressed as the C. O. I. R. The British Government
</p>
<p>acknowledged that they could not have taken any step but
</p>
<p>for the discovery of those documents." In reply to
</p>
<p>another question, Stephens stated that he had received
</p>
<p>;^30,ooo from America in eight years.
</p>
<p>Next, let us see what Meehan has to say for himself
</p>
<p>concerning this matter :

</p>
<p>Mr Median then j^oes on to show how groundless was
</p>
<p>the cry got up by O'Mahony, and afterwards reiterated
</p>
<p>by Stephens  that he was the sole cause of the arrests 
</p>
<p>by demonstrating, as we have done already, that the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish Government was in no lack of evidence concerning
</p>
<p>the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The documents we have cited, together with the draft
</p>
<p>for ;^5oo, were found close together, in Kingstown, near the
</p>
<p>railway station, by a boy employed in the Telegraph
</p>
<p>Office. This boy's evidence, given on vSaturday, Septem-
</p>
<p>ber 30, 1865, runs to this effect: "Two months earlier
</p>
<p>(towards the end of July) when going one evening to the
</p>
<p>Telegraph Office about half past four o'clock, when just
</p>
<p>near the railway station, he found three papers  two
</p>
<p>* lying on the balcony and the third in the channel of the
</p>
<p>balcony '  two of the papers were shaped like letters, the
</p>
<p>third was a long, narrow slip of paper, partly written and
</p>
<p>partly printed, and bearing upon it the words 'New York,'
</p>
<p>in capital letters." Witness put the documents into his
</p>
<p>pocket, and gave them to Miss Charlotte Mitchell, a young
</p>
<p>lady employed in the Telegraph Office.
</p>
<p>We return to O'Mahony's narrative. " Certain things

<p>Meehan was meanwhile allowed to remain unmolested in

</p>
<p>Ireland, disporting himself within a * Circle of Fire,' as he
</p>
<p>afterwards styled it, up to the 8th of October, that is, three
</p>
<p>weeks after the arrests, and more than three months after
</p>
<p>the acquisition of his ' lost ' documents by the English
</p>
<p>Crown Officials. Then, and not till then, did he step on
</p>
<p>board a Cunard steamer which landed him in America,
</p>
<p>just in time to take part in the Convention of Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia."
</p>
<p>So much for the notorious 'lost' documents. In them-
</p>
<p>selves their loss would have done little harm. It was
</p>
<p>when taken in conjunction with a multitude of other
</p>
<p>things that they acquired value as evidence, in the hands
</p>
<p>of the English Crown officers, who had already sufficient
</p>
<p>information, and who were soon to acquire masses of fur-
</p>
<p>ther and very specific information. The " loss," how-
</p>
<p>ever, was of the greatest value to Stephens ; it came most
</p>
<p>opportunely for his purpose. The documents were found
</p>
<p>towards the middle of July, three or four weeks previous
</p>
<p>to the date fixed for the outbreak of the insurrection, and
</p>
<p>enabled him to take very effectual measures for preventing
</p>
<p>that outbreak, without compromising himself with his
</p>
<p>followers. From the day of the loss he taught his lieu-
</p>
<p>tenants to look upon their early arrest as certain. He
</p>
<p>taught them also to expect as certainly a speedy release.
</p>
<p>They trusted him and were ])repared for the arrest when
</p>
<p>it came. Therein and therein alune he had not deceived
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>On the night of the 15th of September the office of The

</p>
<p>the same time a posse of police surrounded the house of
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 91
</p>
<p>T. C. Luby. After waiting outside for a considerable time
</p>
<p> arresting two of his messengers the while  they entered
</p>
<p>and arrested Luby himself. In his house a large number
</p>
<p>of treasonable documents were found  a still larger num-
</p>
<p>ber having been seized in the office of TJie Irish People 
</p>
<p>though the latter were by no means so important as the
</p>
<p>former. For Luby, anticipating the raid on the newspaper
</p>
<p>office, had selected the principal documents deposited
</p>
<p>therein and carried them off, with the view of destroying
</p>
<p>such as could be spared, and of secreting the rest. It is clear
</p>
<p>from this one fact, that the police had received good
</p>
<p>information, better than any accessible to Nagle the osten-
</p>
<p>sible reformer  and that they had timed their visit well.
</p>
<p>Luby, by his selection, merely spared the Crown lawyers
</p>
<p>a good deal of trouble. The documents were already
</p>
<p>sorted to their hands  or nearly so, for he was surprised
</p>
<p>at the work.
</p>
<p>Rossa was arrested under different circumstances  he
</p>
<p>will tell us himself: "On the evening of the 15th of Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, as I was talking to some friends in 82 Dame
</p>
<p>Street, Dublin, Mr Patrick Kearney rushed in and said

<p>do.?' lie had fight in his eye, and I saw that the most
</p>
<p>welcome words to him would be instructions to resist the
</p>
<p>police. But, with very few arms, I knew we could not
</p>
<p>fight that night ; and I told Pat Kearney, who had a
</p>
<p>number of fighting men at his command, that we had
</p>
<p>nothing for it but to keep quiet, and that I would go up

<p>to the office. I was expecting that this swoop would be

<p>made, and, always taking precautions to keep on papers
</p>
<p>92 The Fenia7i Consph^acy.
</p>
<p>about me, I searched my pockets and gave a few business
</p>
<p>receipts and a small pistol to Mike Moynahan.
</p>
<p>I lived across the' street, and when I left my residence an
</p>
<p>hour before, I left my wife packing her trunks. I was
</p>
<p>under orders from Mr Stephens to go to America, and I
</p>
<p>was taking my wife to the South of Ireland next morning.
</p>
<p>I had always given her instructions to destroy any papers
</p>
<p>connected with the organisation that she might find about
</p>
<p>the house, but there was one document that I told her to
</p>
<p>preserve, and this she sewed into the leather lining of
</p>
<p>her pocket-book. The thought struck me that it was
</p>
<p>l)ctter to destroy that too. T told the ])oys about me,
</p>
<p>that I would run over to speak a word to my wife, and
</p>
<p>then go up to TJie Irish People office ; but, as I was
</p>
<p>going across the street, two detectives pounced upon
</p>
<p>me, and I was their prisoner. Each had clutched a
</p>
<p>shoulder of me, and they were so excited that their
</p>
<p>nervous tremour kept shaking me."
</p>
<p>So Rossa was captured, and similarly some twenty more,
</p>
<p>most of them of small account  Cieorge Hopper, brother-in-
</p>
<p>law of the C. O. I. R., being among the number. All these
</p>
<p>were secured by twelve o'clock. Next morning O'Leary and
</p>
<p>Luby were handed into the same receptacle. So far the
</p>
<p>raid was complete and successful. Admirably timed, too,
</p>
<p>for a few hours more would have seen an cw^ to the more
</p>
<p>damning documents, and placed Rossa out of reach.
</p>
<p>George I Topper being among the number of the prisoners,

<p>averted suspicion from Ste[)hens as being the author of

<p>the swoop. And that astute gentleman took a number of

</p>
<p>and some others. Nagle left the house somewhat earlier
</p>
<p>than the rest, and was proceeding to the Castle to inform
</p>
<p>the police of Stephens' whereabouts, when he was met by
</p>
<p>a detective, and himself arrested. In vain the informer

<p>warned the detective that there was a mistake, that he

<p>tion, and that he was in Government employ. But all
</p>
<p>protestations were in vain. The detective insinuated that
</p>
<p>his information would be just as valuable at anotlier time,
</p>
<p>and Nagle was taken into custody, while Stephens quietly
</p>
<p>walked home. The informer was astonished at the
</p>
<p>opacity of his captor ; but the latter knew what he was
</p>
<p>about. Stephens had a purpose to serve at large  simply
</p>
<p>to " set " the remainder of his most trusted lieutenants
</p>
<p>in a l)ody for the police.
</p>
<p>On the day following the seizure of The Irish People
</p>
<p>office Stephens limped down Dame Street, with one leg
</p>
<p>tied up, and otherwise apparently disabled. In this
</p>
<p>manner he tramped about Dublin for several days,
</p>
<p>passing the police at pleasure, and now and then
</p>
<p>begging a penny from a bystander. Thus he con-
</p>
<p>tinued to act until the time for making the ultimate cap-
</p>
<p>ture arrived. Before we relate that, we had better give a
</p>
<p>few sentences to another of his devices for throwing dust
</p>
<p>in the eyes of his dupes  his refuge, and the provisions
</p>
<p>and precautions taken thereanent.

<p>In the month of July preceding, much about the time

<p>94 The Feniait Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>of the " loss " of the documents by Mcehan, he had
</p>
<p>taken a house known as Fairfield House, near Sandy-
</p>
<p>mount, on the river Dodder, at a rent of 60 a year.
</p>
<p>Here he was known as " Mr Herbert," and was under-
</p>
<p>stood to be a retired merchant. " Retired " indeed he
</p>
<p>was, in one sense, for he refused to make acquaintance
</p>
<p>with his neighbours, seemingly occupying- himself ex-
</p>
<p>clusively with his garden. Iksides himself, the place
</p>
<p>was occupied by his wife, his sister-in-law, Kickham,
</p>
<p>Duffy, and Brophy. A large stock of provisions of all
</p>
<p>kinds had been laid in  enough to last the occupants for
</p>
<p>six months at least. A show, too, was made of sustaining
</p>
<p>a state of siege in other respects. JCach of tlie men
</p>
<p>kept his revolver always capped and loaded. The twenty-
</p>
<p>four hours of the day were divided into eight vigils of
</p>
<p>three hours each, during which Stephens, Kickham, Viw'iiy,
</p>
<p>and Brophy alternately kept guard. To aid the sentinels
</p>
<p>on their watch, there was a supply of binocular glasses,
</p>
<p>one in each window commanding the approaches.
</p>
<p>After all these elaborate precautions, the capture of the
</p>
<p>redoubted conspirator was one of the easiest things in
</p>
<p>the world. On the night of the lOth of November, the
</p>
<p>heroes got tipsy, or rather more than tipsy, so at least
</p>
<p>asserts one writing of the event as an "Eye-witness" of most
</p>
<p>of the things he related, and who therefore ought to know.
</p>
<p>He, be it observed, is the ardent worshipper of everything
</p>
<p>Fenian in general, and of James Ste[)hens in particular.
</p>
<p>Well, the usual strict watch was not observed towards the
</p>
<p>morning of the nth of November, and during the ward-

<p>It was partly opened before the dazed and bemuddled
</p>
<p>sentry, and his companions, in the like state, knew what
</p>
<p>they were about. The police, with their commander,
</p>
<p>(>)l<)nel Lake, were witliin the stronf^liold before a blow
</p>
<p>could be struck. roliceniau Hughes must tell the
</p>
<p>rest.
</p>
<p>" I went to the back-door about seven o'clock and
</p>
<p>knocked. At the third knock, a person inside cried out,
</p>
<p>* Who's there } ' I answered that I was a constable, had
</p>
<p>come to examine the house, had a magistrate's warrant,
</p>
<p>and they, the inmates, had better open the door. The
</p>
<p>person said, *I am naked.' I said to him, 'Have you a
</p>
<p>night-shirt on V He said, * Yes.' I told him he need
</p>
<p>not be ashamed, and that if he would not open the door, I
</p>
<p>would open it for him. The door was then opened, and I
</p>
<p>saw the prisoner James Stephens going up the stairs. I
</p>
<p>went after him. In the room there was a female, who he
</p>
<p>said was his wife. I asked him who was the landlord of
</p>
<p>the house } He said * Mr Herbert.' I said, ' What is your
</p>
<p>name."** He said, * James Herbert' I then sent for
</p>
<p>detective Dawson, who knew him, recognised him in-
</p>
<p>stantly, and called him by name. Dawson said, * How
</p>
<p>are you, Stephens } ' who replied, * Who the devil are
</p>
<p>you } ' Dawson said, * I am police-constable Dawson.'
</p>
<p>He replied, ' Dawson, be damned ! ' and became very ex-
</p>
<p>cited. I told him that I arrested him for high treason.
</p>
<p>He said, 'Yes, I will now be quiet.' "
</p>
<p>In this way Stephens kept the resolution so often an-
</p>
<p>nounced by him during the preceding two months, " to

<p>possible, just as they entered the garden, and then manage
</p>
<p>to escape during the consequent confusion."
</p>
<p>However, if Mr Stephens did not distinguish himself
</p>
<p>on the morning of his capture, by strong actions, he did
</p>
<p>distinguish himself, according to his worshippers, by strong
</p>
<p>words  things which they seemed to consider very nearly
</p>
<p>if not quite as heroic. " I learned from sources which I
</p>
<p>need not divulge," writes the Eye-witness, who there is
</p>
<p>reason to think penned his brocJmrc under the dictation of
</p>
<p>Stephens  the said hrocJiurc making its appearance in the
</p>
<p>States in '6G^ simultaneously with the C. O. I. R., and
</p>
<p>being couched in a style much resembling that of the
</p>
<p>C. O. I. R.  ** that the excitement of Stephens on being
</p>
<p>arrested was something fearful to contemplate. His face
</p>
<p>became livid with suppressed passion ; his eyes (those sore-
</p>
<p>looking, furtive, blinking eyes) fired, with a fierce unnatural
</p>
<p>brightness ; his voice became hoarse and tremulous as a
</p>
<p>winter wind ; and his whole body shook and shivered with
</p>
<p>volcanic emotion. It was as if a sudden sirocco had passed
</p>
<p>over his soul, withering with a poisonous tempest all his
</p>
<p>hopes for the rehabilitation of Ireland." In short, the
</p>
<p>C. O. I. R. sought to persuade his dupes that on this
</p>
<p>occasion at least his pose was all that they could have
</p>
<p>desired. Unfortunately, however, for his repute, the ex-
</p>
<p>pressions recorded of him, by those whom we can trust,
</p>
<p>do not agree with this magniloquent description. " Who
</p>
<p>the devil are you.'*" " Dawson, be damned!" and that
</p>
<p>admirable climax, " I will now be quiet," are not, the last
</p>
<p>especially, precisely the interjections of a hero.

<p>Seeing his hopes for the rehabilitation of Ireland
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 97
</p>
<p>baffled, Stephens, who was then hi his nightshirt, pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to dress himself. Himself and his three lieu-
</p>
<p>tenants were soon safe within four walls. So ended the
</p>
<p>I'^enian farce, so far as Ireland was concerned. It was
</p>
<p>soon to become wretchedly tragic therein. And what did
</p>
<p>^dl this mean t
</p>
<p>The first arrests in Dublin, followed as they were,
</p>
<p>by, or rather simultaneous with, other arrests in Cork
</p>
<p>and elsewhere, had rendered a rising on the 20th of
</p>
<p>September impossible. The thing had to be postponed
</p>
<p>until fresh arrangements could be made. All this might
</p>
<p>have been done before. Measures might have been taken,
</p>
<p>before the arrests of September, to secure a rising with some
</p>
<p>sort of eclat, a little earlier or a little later, had Mr Stephens
</p>
<p>really meant that there should have been a rising at all.
</p>
<p>We have stated these arrests were no surprise to him. We
</p>
<p>have shown that they were no surprise to Rossa. Indeed,
</p>
<p>they had been expected by those deepest in the secrets of
</p>
<p>tlie organisation for weeks. In a letter found at O'Lcary's
</p>
<p>lodgings  read at the trial of that person  it was stated
</p>
<p>that they (the chiefs) expected shortly to serve some time
</p>
<p>in Mountjoy prison, but that they were prepared for it.
</p>
<p>Prepared to be imprisoned they certainly were, though
</p>
<p>hardly for the results that followed. They expected to
</p>
<p>be released, either by the measures which Stephens
</p>
<p>had so often declared he had taken to secure escape
</p>
<p>in case of arrest, or by the success of the revolution.
</p>
<p>'I'he latter, the success of the revolution, was always, for
</p>
<p>the first two years, the confident hope of those members
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood who happened to be convicted. Not

<p>one of them heard his sentence without feeh'ng convinced
</p>
<p>that the penalty must soon be remitted ; and numbers,
</p>
<p>expressed tin's conviction before quittin^^ the dock.
</p>
<p>Stephens, however, took no measures whatever, for pro-
</p>
<p>curing the escape of any of the prisoners. On the contrary,.
</p>
<p>he sternly forbade the making of any such attempt. lie did
</p>
<p>not even satisfy themselves or their friends by his proceed-
</p>
<p>ings with respect to their defence. Much discontent,,
</p>
<p>indeed, was manifested at his conduct. Thus wrote Ste-
</p>
<p>phens on this point, a {c\\f days before his capture 
</p>
<p>" I learn that some of the prisoners are discontented and
</p>
<p>greatly annoyed at what they call my interference with Mi-
</p>
<p>Lawless. This has either arisen from a personal dislike to
</p>
<p>me, which I cannot credit, or from my having been mis-
</p>
<p>represented to them by Lawless.
</p>
<p>" I have already sent memoranda of the result of my
</p>
<p>interview with Lawless, so I need not repeat ; but I may
</p>
<p>add, Mr Leslie accompanied me on my first and last visit,,
</p>
<p>and can vouch for the correctness of my report. T under-
</p>
<p>stand the prisoners are fmding fault with me for two things-
</p>
<p>which I did not report; firstly, for saying that the ;^500 paid
</p>
<p>by the bank did not belong to Mr O'Leary. This I did say to
</p>
<p>Lawless, when he complained that Mr O'Leary had made
</p>
<p>a strange demand upon him to hand over the money, and
</p>
<p>I admit it was indiscreet, but if it was the truth, I cannot
</p>
<p>see why it is sought to magnify it into a crime. I am
</p>
<p>accused of recommending a Mr Nolan, a solicitor, to
</p>
<p>Messrs Luby, Rossa, and Ilaltigan, whom it now appears
</p>
<p>Mr Luby (the only one Nolan saw) did, or does not think

</p>
<p>trustworthy. Now, in explanation of this, I beg to say that
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 99
</p>
<p>on Tuesday, after the arrests, I did give Nolan a letter to the
</p>
<p>gentleman named, which was also signed by G. W. Cush-
</p>
<p>man,* and we did it, after mature consideration, and as the
</p>
<p>only hope of being able to be of service to Mr Luby or
</p>
<p>the others. We selected Nolan, because he promised us, if
</p>
<p>he was retained, to give us charge of the case, and that,
</p>
<p>after a fust interview between him and the i)risoner, cither
</p>
<p>he or both of us might rei>rcsent him in the prison. Both
</p>
<p>Cushman and myself acted in good faith, and used
</p>
<p>Nolan as the only means by which we could communicate
</p>
<p>with the prisoners, which he felt to be a duty under the
</p>
<p>circumstances ; and I think it is too bad that our well-
</p>
<p>meant efforts to serve the prisoners and be a medium be-
</p>
<p>tween them and their friends outside should be turned
</p>
<p>into a fault. It is very painful to me that I should be
</p>
<p>deemed by the prisoners and their friends as a mischievous
</p>
<p>meddler, or be the means of causing a misunderstanding
</p>
<p>between those who have hitherto been more than mere
</p>
<p>friends, much less to be a bone of contention. Therefore
</p>
<p>1 shall take it as a favour if I can be released from the
</p>
<p>duty assigned to me as to the defence ; not that I shrink
</p>
<p>from my duty, but I am fearful of doing a great deal of
</p>
<p>harm in pursuit of a little good."
</p>
<p>From this letter it is evident that any command which
</p>
<p>Stephens pretended to exercise over Irish prisons and prison
</p>
<p>officials did not exist so far as the parties arrested in
</p>
<p>September were concerned. Apart from his conduct, with
</p>
<p>respect to the defence of the prisoners, there were other

<p>things in Stephens during the period that elapsed up to

</p>
<p>his own arrest whicli gave deep dissatisfaction. He had
</p>
<p>been waited upon by a deputation from the deserters in
</p>
<p>Dubhn, which was accompanied by a deputation from the
</p>
<p>centres of the regiments in the garrison, and was en-
</p>
<p>treated to give the word for an outbreak. These men felt
</p>
<p>that every instant was diminishing their chances of success,
</p>
<p>and they represented the position very forcibly, but
</p>
<p>Stephens would not accede to their request. Others
</p>
<p>wanted him to allow men who were very willing to make
</p>
<p>the attempt, to force the Dublin prisons, but here he was
</p>
<p>more obstinate still in refusal. His position had become
</p>
<p>very embarrassing and was becoming dangerous ; the only
</p>
<p>way to escape from it was to become a prisoner himself,
</p>
<p>and he became a prisoner.
</p>
<p>Stephens and his companions, when arrested, were found
</p>
<p>very much better provided with money than any of the
</p>
<p>former cai)tives. Stephens c.irricd the sum of ^26 ; Kick-
</p>
<p>ham had ^"40 in coin, ^33 in notes, and a cheque for ^40;
</p>
<p>while Duffy was in possession of an order, dated New
</p>
<p>York, 22d Steptember 1865, for;"i525, 8s. 6d., payable to
</p>
<p>George Hopper. The house was well furnished, upwards
</p>
<p>of ^300 having been paid for its fitting to a Dublin
</p>
<p>upholsterer but a short time before. Everything was of
</p>
<p>the best kind. The revolvers, which had not been used,
</p>
<p>were beautiful weapons. There were books ; there was a
</p>
<p>wardrobe superbly fitted up ; and there were plenty of
</p>
<p>papers relating to the I. R. \\.
</p>
<p>Let us see, now, what Stephens said himself about these
</p>
<p>arrests and current events. " The arrests (September)

<p>were made and the Government said triumphantly that
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 10 r
</p>
<p>all was over in Ireland ; but so far from it, never was
</p>
<p>harder work and more work done in Ireland than immedi-
</p>
<p>ately after the arrests. I was free myself, and while free
</p>
<p>r am not used to be idle. Immediately afterwards the
</p>
<p>(Government saw the necessity of proclaiming every
</p>
<p>county in Ireland one after another, because they felt
</p>
<p>the work was going on stronger than ever, and that the
</p>
<p>only thing we wanted was arms and munitions of war, and
</p>
<p>these were coming into the country and they could not
</p>
<p>prevent their coming in. They saw that the men who
</p>
<p>were serving the cause of Ireland were able to baffle them,
</p>
<p>and that the men got in what they required.
</p>
<p>"What they were able to do then they are able to do now,
</p>
<p>(Stephens was speaking in New York, 1866.) Don't allow
</p>
<p>yourselves to be blinded upon that subject, nor let your-
</p>
<p>selves be persuaded by any one that we can't get the means
</p>
<p>into the country. It has been all a question of money.
</p>
<p>With the requisite funds we can get in whatever materials
</p>
<p>we wish, and men too, if we require them. My opinions on
</p>
<p>this subject ought to be more than the opinions of the
</p>
<p>people who have not seen Ireland since the greenness of
</p>
<p>their youth, and who know next to nothing of Ireland.
</p>
<p>**My friends were arrested, and you know how they con-
</p>
<p>ducted themselves. The bearing of those prisoners lias
</p>
<p>not been surpassed by the bearing of any men in history
</p>
<p>under similar circumstances, and they bore all this because
</p>
<p>they still had faith,  faith in the organisation which they
</p>
<p>knew to be so powerful at home, and also faith that the

</p>
<p>"When the counties had been proclaimed, the l^ritish
</p>
<p>press  how am I to designate that press ?  I beHeve it
</p>
<p>to be the vilest press in the world, unless it be that
</p>
<p>foul press of Ireland which may fairly be designated
</p>
<p>the journalistic excrements of England  that vile press,
</p>
<p>then, began openly to boast that the organisation was
</p>
<p>suppressed in Ireland. But, only a few weeks after-
</p>
<p>wards, the Lord Lieutenant wrote the precious letter which
</p>
<p>you must all of you have read calling on the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment to suppress the Habeas Corpus Act. You know the
</p>
<p>wholesale arrests that were made after the suspension of
</p>
<p>the Habeas Corpus Act. They thought to make the
</p>
<p>world believe that we were suppressed then at least, and
</p>
<p>that was their third attempt. But I can tell you
</p>
<p>that the organisation in Ireland is stronger than it ever
</p>
<p>has been, in numbers, discipline, and in all the require-
</p>
<p>ments of an army, save only war material. The organisa-
</p>
<p>tion in Ireland, towards the close of last year, numbered
</p>
<p>two hundred thousand men, and of that force fifty thou-
</p>
<p>.sand were thoroughly drilled, with a large proportion of
</p>
<p>men who had seen war and smelt powder on the battle-
</p>
<p>field, a large proportion of veterans, in short, fifty thousand
</p>
<p>were partly drilled men, and the other hundred thousand
</p>
<p>quite undrilled. But, if there be a man among you who
</p>
<p>thinks that fifty thousand Irishmen thoroughly drilled,
</p>
<p>with fifty thousand others partly drilled, would not make
</p>
<p>a force sufficient to meet anything that ]uigland could
</p>
<p>bring against us, then, indeed, he is wofuUy ignorant of
</p>
<p>the resources of England. ,

</p>

</p>
<p>present ? There are some twenty thousand English troops
</p>
<p>in Ireland at present, and it would take England from
</p>
<p>thirty to forty days to concentrate a force of thirty to
</p>
<p>forty thousand men in Ireland. It would take her
</p>
<p>three months at least to concentrate a force of seventy
</p>
<p>thousand, and it is not likely she would ever be able to
</p>
<p>concentrate a larger force. Of our forces we could con-
</p>
<p>centrate in Ireland, at four or five given points, one hun-
</p>
<p>ilred thousand men in twenty-four hours. All we wanted
</p>
<p>in Ireland, from the middle of September to the end of
</p>
<p>December, was arms to put into the hands of our men.
</p>
<p>The men were there and only wanted the arms.

<p>myself to believe this that I had made up my mind to get

<p>jnyself arrested, even if the English authorities had not

<p>tsucceeded in doing so (Stephens meant in arresting him) ;

<p>to accept a prison voluntarily, and that by going into

<p>prison you, on this side, would be driven to give us what

</p>
<p>1 04 ^>^^ Faiiaii Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>It is well to notice the number of condemning' admis-
</p>
<p>sions in this extraordinary extract There were plenty of
</p>
<p>men in the I. R. B., but they were virtually unarmed.
</p>
<p>They had neither weapons nor the means of procuring
</p>
<p>them. Then the first arrests were followed immediately
</p>
<p>by the proclaiming of every county in Ireland, and by the
</p>
<p>suspension of the Habeas Corpus, things showing that the
</p>
<p>government of a powerful country was fully alive to the
</p>
<p>extent and objects of the conspiracy, and determined to
</p>
<p>frustrate it. How any man in his senses could think of
</p>
<p>rebellion under such circumstances is astonishing. That
</p>
<p>Stephens thought seriously of anything of the kind we
</p>
<p>cannot believe. And yet, we know that he had pledged
</p>
<p>himself to "war or dissolution of the Brotherhood in '65,'*"
</p>
<p>and we know that he even fixed a day for the outbreak,,
</p>
<p>that day being precisely one by the arrival of which it was;
</p>
<p>utterly impossible to supply the deficiency of arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition under any circumstances. That he could ex-
</p>
<p>pect such a deficiency ever to be supplied to any formid-
</p>
<p>able extent, with the counties proclaimed,  the authorities^
</p>
<p>everywhere on the alert, and the English fleets watching
</p>
<p>the coast, is also impossible. And he could have had ncv
</p>
<p>real hope of success even if these difficulties had not lain
</p>
<p>in the way, of any considerable importation of wcapon.s
</p>
<p>from America. The quantity of arms and equipments
</p>
<p>collected there at this period we have already summarised.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most extraordinary of all his statements is^
</p>
<p>the one in which he declared his purpose of procuring his-
</p>
<p>own arrest. We know that a year before he had stated

</p>
<p>the same thing to O'Mahony. But that might have been
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 105
</p>
<p>looked upon as an idle boast, or more probably still, as
</p>
<p>a preparatory excuse for the thing, a device to divert sus-
</p>
<p>picion from himself when it should occur. The flimsiest of
</p>
<p>devices it looks to us. Nor does the reason he gives in
</p>
<p>his speech for taking such a course appear at all convinc-
</p>
<p>ing. Why should his arrest make the Fenians of America
</p>
<p>more willing to provide what he asked } One would have
</p>
<p>supposed such an occurrence about the most likely thing to
</p>
<p>damp and destroy all enthusiasm rather than excite it.
</p>
<p>Probably Stephens introduced this paragraph into his
</p>
<p>speech, because among his hearers, or among many of
</p>
<p>them, there would be an unpleasant remembrance of his
</p>
<p>singular boast.
</p>
<p>There is not, however, in this speech, or in any of his
</p>
<p>speeches, one single attempt to excuse one circumstance,
</p>
<p>the fact that not one word of the " loss " of the documents
</p>
<p>by Meehan was ever conveyed to O'Mahony, or to any
</p>
<p>of the leading Fenians in America, until the arrests
</p>
<p>of September had taken place. This suppression of an
</p>
<p>important fact enabled the British Government ta
</p>
<p>intercept over ;^6ooo remitted by O'Mahony. It was
</p>
<p>precisely the amount which Stephens himself particularised,
</p>
<p>in the speech so often quoted, as that which he required to
</p>
<p>commence the rebellion. The money was not eventually
</p>
<p>lost to the Brotherhood ; but it was locked up until the
</p>
<p>emergency had passed away. The " loss " of the Meehan
</p>
<p>documents did, indeed, prevent the outbreak projected for
</p>
<p>Sei)tember, but not in the way explained by Stephens
</p>
<p>and accepted by O'Mahony and so many others.

<p>We must now resume O'Mahony 's narrative :  " When
</p>
<p>io6 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the final call had been issued (August 5th, 1865) I felt
</p>
<p>disembarrassed of the more serious portion of my moral
</p>
<p>responsibility. My duty appeared to have become all at
</p>
<p>once exceedingly simple. It was, first, to forward to the
</p>
<p>Executive of the I. R. 11 the immediate financial product
</p>
<p>of the said "call," as fast as it came in, so that the arms
</p>
<p>and ammunition which could, according to all our ofiicial
</p>
<p>reports, be purchased in the United Kingdom, might be
</p>
<p>made available without delay ; and, next, to see to the
</p>
<p>fitting out of a military and naval expedition from
</p>
<p>America to Ireland. As soon as the latter could be ready
</p>
<p>for sea, I had made up my own mind to resign the Head
</p>
<p>Centreship, and join it as a volunteer. I rejoiced at the
</p>
<p>near prospect of being able to throw off the official mantle
</p>
<p>which had so long clung to me  burning into my soul and
</p>
<p>poisoning my existence. With respect to the general con-
</p>
<p>duct of the movement, no power of independent volition
</p>
<p>had been left to me. To have attempted to exercise any
</p>
<p>now would have been a betrayal of my trust. The whole
</p>
<p>programme having been laid down by James Stephens
</p>
<p>and his military and civil councils in Dublin, any diver-
</p>
<p>gence therefrom, however well conceived in itself, might
</p>
<p>obstruct and defeat the whole movement. I, therefore,
</p>
<p>ceased to reason or to plan from that time up to the
</p>
<p>"' Secession," devoting all my energies to the literal fulfil-
</p>
<p>ment of the requirements of the home organisation, with-
</p>
<p>out question or demur.

<p>Events in 1^6^. 107
</p>
<p>James Stephens, Informing me of the now notorious ' loss*
</p>
<p>of 'Plenipotentiary' Meehan's official documentary, and
</p>
<p>Avith them of ^500 sterling, the money of the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood. The despatch Informed me, also, that Meehan's
</p>
<p>life had been saved with difficulty by Stephens himself,
</p>
<p>from the indignant centres of Dublin, upon their learning
</p>
<p>of his criminality, and tliat Important arrests were expected
</p>
<p>hourly * in consequence thereof. Plenipotentiary Median
</p>
<p>had given no intimation whatever of this misfortune In his
</p>
<p>own report, at least not in the one that I saw ; but, as his
</p>
<p>official missive had come under cover to W. R. Roberts, it
</p>
<p>might, or might not, have been accompanied by another.
</p>
<p>** Meanwhile the ' Pinal Call ' was promptly and en-
</p>
<p>tliuslastlcally responded to by the Brotherhood. Within
</p>
<p>llie space of one fortnight from its Issue, I was enabled to
</p>
<p>forward several drafts to Ireland, amounting in all to
</p>
<p>^bout six thousand pounds sterling. The crisis admitting
</p>
<p>of no delay, I was forced to risk them through the British
</p>
<p>post, and to send them to addresses In Dublin, previously
</p>
<p>furnished to me by James Stephens. I learnt afterwards
</p>
<p>that Stephens had left another address for Paris, with his
</p>
<p>right-hand man, H. O'C. M'Carthy (who was now dead) ;
</p>
<p>but, as before stated, I did not know of the existence of
</p>
<p>any such arrangement.
</p>
<p>"About the 2 2d of September, ' Plenipotentiary ' P. W.
</p>
<p>Dunne returned to New York. He was big with the
</p>
<p>perfection of the home organisation, and expressed himself

</p>
<p>highly hidignant witli mc for not having sent home an/
</p>
<p>money to Stephens, during his (Dunne's) sojourn with
</p>
<p>him ; but he had to curb his indignation when he wa>t
</p>
<p>shown the dupHcatc draft for six thousand pounds sterhng,
</p>
<p>together with a long list of officers sent to Ireland during
</p>
<p>the interval. The fact was, that through Tlcnipotentiary
</p>
<p>Median's double treachery in losing his documents, and
</p>
<p>concealing the loss from me, the Ih-itish authorities were
</p>
<p>enabled to seize the drafts in the post-office, and conse-
</p>
<p>quently even the loss of the ^500 confided to himself was,,
</p>
<p>under the circumstances, a cause of serious embarrassment
</p>
<p>and injury to the movement.
</p>
<p>"On the 24th of September, the news of the seizure- of
</p>
<p>The Irish People, and the arrest of its editors and other
</p>
<p>important parties, reached me. It was followed by another
</p>
<p>despatch from Stephens, detailing the extent of our losses^
</p>
<p>including the " drafts," and requesting that an immediate
</p>
<p>supply be sent by hand, and that a trustworthy man be
</p>
<p>selected, without dehiy, and sent to Paris as our financial
</p>
<p>intermediary for the future. He attributed the immediate
</p>
<p>cause of the entire misfortune to the loss of his documents
</p>
<p>by Plenipotentiary P. J. Median. There can now be no-
</p>
<p>doubt that it was so."

<p>details from the public prints. To-day several other arrests have
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 109
</p>
<p>been made  of the Council among tliem. Immediately after the
</p>
<p>forcing of the door last night (they broke open the door, and carried
</p>
<p>off everything), we heard what had happened  and that much, I may
</p>
<p>say, extreme feeling had been stirred up among our friends. They
</p>
<p>sent a party in search of me to know what should be done. Had wc
</p>
<p>been prepared last night, we would have marked an epoch in our
</p>
<p>history. But we were not prepared, so I issued an order that all
</p>
<p>should go home. We have news by this day's mail that numerous
</p>
<p>arrests have been made in Cork. No further intelligence has yet
</p>
<p>reached us from the country. I would add the authorities took pos-
</p>
<p>session of the telegraph offices last night. This, of course, has made
</p>
<p>our communications slow. From what I have already written 
</p>
<p>detailed writing is out of the question, if I am to catch this post  and
</p>
<p>what you can learn from the public prints, you will see that the enemy
</p>
<p>is in a rage, and striking like a madman. Like a madman, for I can
</p>
<p>see he is much in the dark still he is furiously \\\ earnest, and every
</p>
<p>suspected person is certain of being })ickcd u[). Tell our friends that
</p>
<p>their scepticism, inquisition, hesitation, and not imprudence on our
</p>
<p>part, have brought us to this. Mr Meehan, especially, is uni-
</p>
<p>versally blamed  of course, I cannot say how much he may
</p>
<p>have injured us ; but I know his affirmed knowledge of men and
</p>
<p>things has been calculated to do us serious injury. It is much to be
</p>
<p>regretted that our friends at your side saw the necessity to examine
</p>
<p>into what we were doing, or to tell us what to do."
</p>
<p>It was this letter that suggested to O'Mahony the cry
</p>
<p>which he took up so eagerly against P. J. Meehan. It
</p>
<p>was a clever device of the C. O. I. R. lie knew the
</p>
<p>enmity of the 11. C. V. V>. towards Meehan ; he knew the
</p>
<p>character of the former  weak, passionate, and injudici-
</p>
<p>ous ; lie knew that the cry would be taken uj) on both
</p>
<p>.sides of the Atlantic ; he knew that few or none among
</p>
<p>his countrymen would pause to think the matter over
</p>
<p>carefully ; he knew that they would place the loss of the
</p>
<p>documents by Meehan side by side wilh the arrests, as
</p>
<p>cause and effect ; and he knew that suspicion would thus

<p>be diverted very effectually from himself.
</p>
<p>no The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>To us, who have no prejudice on cither side, it is very clear
</p>
<p>that the loss of those documents,  whether that loss was by
</p>
<p>design or the work of chance  and there is no reason to
</p>
<p>blame chance  was not the fundamental cause of the failure
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy. As Meehan pointed out, there was
</p>
<p>nothing in them calculated to reveal any particular
</p>
<p>secret.
</p>
<p>As to the money afterwards intercepted, how could the
</p>
<p>British Government guess that the I. R. W. and its chiefs
</p>
<p>would be so stupid as not to notify the loss to the Head
</p>
<p>Centre in New York } How could they know of the
</p>
<p>extraordinary conduct of the chiefs of the conspiracy in
</p>
<p>both hemispheres, between the end of June and the date
</p>
<p>of the descent on the office of TJic Irish People in Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, unless they had received some more special
</p>
<p>information than the documents supplied } That they
</p>
<p>possessed such special information is plain. And though
</p>
<p>Nagle had been already for some months in communica-
</p>
<p>tion with the Castle authorities, it is quite clear that he 
</p>
<p>a mere messenger and papcr-foldcr in the office of The
</p>
<p>Irish People  could not have obtained access to any of
</p>
<p>the more important documents and secrets of the I. R. 1).
</p>
<p>The Government officials in Dublin must have obtainctl
</p>
<p>precise information of what was going on. Ask the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances that we have related ; ask those circumstances
</p>
<p>we are about to relatej; they will tell who the informer
</p>
<p>was.
</p>
<p>We have said that the arrests made in Cork were
</p>
<p>hardly less important than those made in Dublin. ICvery

</p>
<p>escaped conviction for the time. This was Captain John
</p>
<p>M'Caffcrty. lie sailed for IrcLind \\\ September 1865, in
</p>
<p>the City of Limerick steamer. On the arrival of the
</p>
<p>vessel at Quecnstown, M'Caffcrty was arrested before he
</p>
<p>could step ashore. This act, coupled with the subsequent
</p>
<p>career of the prisoner, shows how accurate was the infor-
</p>
<p>mation in the possession of the British Government, and
</p>
<p>that it must have been supplied by no ordinary informer.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the authorities were perfectly aware of the name,
</p>
<p>rank, etc., of every American Irish officer that sailed for
</p>
<p>Ireland, from the beginning- of the crisis to the end ; they
</p>
<p>l<new the date of their sailing, and knew the ports at which
</p>
<p>they were to land ; consequently they were prepared to
</p>
<p>arrest them at once, or to establish a watch upon their
</p>
<p>movements.
</p>
<p>M'Caffcrty had served in the Confederate army during
</p>
<p>the war of secession. In his possession were found
</p>
<p>a number of military manuals. He was tried under
</p>
<p>the Special Commission at Cork, in December 1865.
</p>
<p>At his trial, a letter was read by his counsel which
</p>
<p>tlirows a good deal of light upon the way in which such
</p>
<p>men as M'Caffcrty tried to escape the punishment
</p>
<p>attached to their conduct. They were all bitterly inimical
</p>
<p>to England. They stopped at nothing that occurred to
</p>
<p>them as likely to promote their purpose. At the same
</p>
<p>time they really seemed to think that their naturalisation
</p>
<p>in the United States, ought to place them beyond the
</p>
<p>reach of English law. On his arrest M'Caffcrty claimed

<p>I find Jirsfy that you were born in Sandusky, State of Ohio ; second,
</p>
<p>that you dehberatcly entered the rebel army during the war ; third,
</p>
<p>that you took the amnesty oath in the month of May last ; fourth ,

<p>that you left New York in September to go to Paris, to get permis-
</p>
<p>sion for Southern men to go to Mexico ; fifth, that you were arrested
</p>
<p>at (2ueenstown with revolvers and trcason;ible documents,* involving
</p>
<p>you in suspicion of complicity with treasonable movements in Ire-
</p>
<p>land. Now, whether your statement is true that you were on your
</p>
<p>way to Paris to consult with men still disloyal to the United States ;
</p>
<p>or whether, as suspected, you arc an agent from America, combined
</p>
<p>with the P'enian organisation to raise a rebellion in Ireland  in either
</p>
<p>case you have entirely forfeited all claims to cither sympathy or sup-
</p>

<p>allegiance, and am, your obedient servant, " E. G. Eastman."
</p>
<p>This letter was carefully disseminated among the Brother-

<p>their brother conspirator .should be remembered for suit-

</p>
<p>Mr vStcphens acted his part of high-hearted patriot to
</p>
<p>admiralion. I lis wife, ncc Miss Hopper, the daughter of a
</p>
<p>tavern-keeper of Sandymount, on parting with him en-
</p>
<p>quired whether she might not visit him in prison. " No,"
</p>
<p>reph'ed the patriot; "you cannot visit me without asking
</p>
<p>permission of British officials, and I do not think it becom-
</p>
<p>ing in one so near to me as you are to ask favours of
</p>
<p>British dogs. You must not do it,  I forbid it ! "
</p>
<p>When he appeared for committal before the magistrate,
</p>
<p>liis bearing and Language were equally melo-dramatic. He
</p>
<p>was artistically attired, and took care to make full display of
</p>
<p>lu's well-shaped hands. "I have employed no lawyer," he
</p>
<p>observ^ed, " nor have I put in any plea in this case, neither
</p>
<p>do I intend to do so. By so doing I should be recognising
</p>
<p>l^ritisli law in Irehind, and I scorn and C[ii{y any punish-
</p>
<p>ment it can inflict on me. I have spoken !"
</p>
<p>Yes, he had spoken  for his dupes, and his words had
</p>
<p>the effect intended. For a while enthusiasm in his favour
</p>
<p>resumed its old strength. His last speech, too, had its effect
</p>
<p>also with others than his dupes. The NatioJi made a good
</p>
<p>deal of fun of them, and there was much smiling at them
</p>
<p>in all quarters where their full value was perfectly well
</p>
<p>understood. Mr Strong, the presiding magistrate, for ex-
</p>
<p>ample, managed to keep his countenance for the time, as
</p>
<p>did also the other crown officials present. Care was
</p>
<p>taken, indeed, by the prosecution to do nothing that
</p>
<p>might impair the effect of the dramatic attitude assumed
</p>

</p>
<p>as an " eye witness " of the whole matter comes into
</p>
<p>place : 
</p>
<p>"Precautions, unheard of since 1848 in Richmond
</p>
<p>prison, were taken to provide for Stephens' safe keeping.
</p>
<p>He was lodged in the top storey of the most central part
</p>
<p>of the building, the only other prisoners lodged in the
</p>
<p>same corridor being Kickham and Brophy, who were both
</p>
<p>arrested wilii him, and a latl named M'Leod, about whom
</p>
<p>I shall have something to say presently. The prison
</p>
<p>staff was reinforced by twenty-five of the metropolitan
</p>
<p>police. There might be Fenians in the force,  rumour
</p>
<p>positively said there were,  and in this case who could
</p>
<p>say what might become of Stephens t V\\\\ of this idea,
</p>
<p>and of a profound belief in their own wisdom, the governors
</p>
<p>of the prison excluded every one by night from the cor-
</p>
<p>ridor on which Stephens' cell was situated, confident
</p>
<p>that complicated locks and massive bars were better
</p>
<p>security than could be afforded by the presence of the
</p>
<p>police. But the prison authorities had yet another string
</p>
<p>to their bow,  another very deeply laid plan for prevent-
</p>
<p>ing Stephens' escape, which they conceived to be a very
</p>
<p>knowing dodge indeed. In the cell next to that occupied
</p>
<p>by Stephens they placed the boy M'Leod, who had been
</p>
<p>sent to jail on some petty larceny indictment, promising
</p>
<p>him his liberty and 20 on the ct)ndilion that he would
</p>
<p>pull a wire in his cell, which sounds a large gong placed
</p>
<p>at the end of the corridor, in case he heard any unusual
</p>
<p>noise in Stephens' cell during the night. M'Leod, who
</p>
<p>gladly consented to the arrangement, was allowed numerous

<p>l^irt of the (^wyy in order tli.it he mi^dit be the better
</p>
<p>qualified for the duty of watching and Hstening at niglit."
</p>
<p>Here we pause in our citation to remark that the prison
</p>
<p>.system of watch and ward was apparently too perfect to
</p>
<p>allow of an evasion, provided that it were fairly kept.
</p>
<p>This was how it was done. The watchman, on starting
</p>
<p>upon his rounds, had to perform an operation called
</p>
<p>" pegging the clock." This showed the time he entered
</p>
<p>on his duty. Several such clocks were placed at various
</p>
<p>points of the round, and each of these had to be similarly
</p>
<p>pegged, the round occupying an hour and a half. The
</p>
<p>watchman was required to try every lock, examine every
</p>
<p>door, and satisfy himself that every cell was occupied by
</p>
<p>the person assigned to it. On ordinary occasions a single
</p>
<p>watchman on duty at a time was considered sufficient; but
</p>
<p>now there were three or four enq)loyed together, and in-
</p>
<p><leed placed peri)etually in the corridor into which the cell of
</p>
<p>the C. IC. opened. These extraordinary precautions lasted
</p>
<p>for some time, and during that time the imprisoned con-
</p>
<p>.spirators were treated with severity in some respects. None
</p>
<p>but those enjoying the entireconfidence of the prison officials
</p>
<p>were allowed to converse with them, and they were locked
</p>
<p><'dtogether in their cells, with the exception of two hours
</p>
<p>a day allowed for exercise. In other respects, as they
</p>
<p>themselves admitted, they were treated with tolerable
</p>
<p>kindness and courtesy.
</p>
<p>*' While his jailors were thus devising means for keeping
</p>
<p>liim in custody (here we resume the narrative of the eye-
</p>
<p>witness), Stephens, on his part, was taking extraordinary

<p>aneasures to lull them into a sense of security. He

</p>
<p>refused from the day he entered to the morning- of hi.s
</p>
<p>escape to see anybody from the outside world, wife, friend,
</p>
<p>or lawyer. Mrs Stephens produced the necessary * pass,'
</p>
<p>and visited the prison a few days after the arrest to sec
</p>
<p>lier husband, but Stephens declined an interview, declaring
</p>
<p>that ' he would never see his wife within the walls of a
</p>
<p>prison.' Several old friends called, but he would see no
</p>
<p>one ; he wanted, he said, ' to l)e left alone with his cares.'
</p>
<p>In pursuing this course Stephens had an object in view ;
</p>
<p>lie knew that the apparent absence of all communication
</p>
<p>between him and the world without would render the sur-
</p>
<p>veillance to which he was exposed less strict. The correct-
</p>
<p>ness of the latter assumption was proved by the fact that
</p>
<p>the Board of Superintendence, believing that the twenty-
</p>
<p>five policemen were, under all the circumstances, an
</p>
<p>unnecessary addition to the prison staff, sent twenty-two
</p>
<p>of them back to their regular duties, retaining but three of
</p>
<p>them within the prison, to watch in the corridor, which a
</p>
<p>door always locked divided into two parts."
</p>
<p>The watchmen were also reduced to one at a time on
</p>
<p>duty. One of these watchmen was a man of the name of
</p>
<p>15yrnc, a member of the Ihotherhood. Seven years earlier
</p>
<p>he had formed one of the Dublin police force, which he
</p>
<p>left to join the Papal Ihigade. On his return to Ireland,
</p>
<p>after the defeat at Castelfedardo, he was elected warden
</p>
<p>of Richmond Bridewell. Twice over had he been sus-
</p>
<p>pended for inattention ; indeed, previous to the arrest of
</p>
<p>the C. O. I. R., he held his office by a very feeble tenure.
</p>
<p>He was a member of the I. R. B., and the fact was more than

</p>
<p>man, his character, and his proclivities, he was about tlic
</p>
<p>worst guardian that could have been placed in charge of
</p>
<p>such prisoners. Whether he was allowed to retain his
</p>
<p>position at this period through the negligence or design
</p>
<p>of the authorities our readers must say for themselves.
</p>
<p>" On Mondays, Wednesdays, and J^^ridays, l^yrne acted
</p>
<p>as warder, and on any of these days, therefore, he could
</p>
<p>communicate with Stephens undetected, by using ordinary
</p>
<p>caution, during the time the Head Centre was taking
</p>
<p>exercise. The alternate days being at his disposal, from
</p>
<p>two until eight o'clock P.M., he had of course ample time
</p>
<p>to communicate with the Fenians without. On Tuesdays
</p>
<p>and Thursdays he acted at niglit in the capacity of a
</p>
<p>sentinel, but was at no time allowed access to the prisoner's
</p>
<p>cells, though he could have gone there at the hours of
</p>
<p>exercise without detection, as the cell doors were then
</p>
<p>open."
</p>
<p>Without the prison, numerous plans were devised for
</p>
<p>the release of the great chief, and from various motives.
</p>
<p>The mass of the Brotherhood wanted him at large on
</p>
<p>account of his supposed indispensability to the conspirators.
</p>
<p>Others, who had begun to know him better, wanted him
</p>
<p>out of the way to prevent mischief. And some who, while
</p>
<p>suspecting him, wished at the same time to take his place
</p>
<p>added to the purpose of rendering him innocuous, the
</p>
<p>equally strong one of satisfying their personal ambition.
</p>
<p>Iwentually all plans were thrown aside for one contrived
</p>
<p>by Colonel Kelly, Captain M'Cafferty, John Flood, and
</p>
<p>John Kirwan, the last being a man who rendered himself

<p>notorious subsequently by an escape of his own from
</p>
<p>1 1 8 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>prison. Kirwan, like Byrne, had been in the Police and
</p>
<p>in the Papal Brigade. Like Byrne, too, he had been a
</p>
<p>Avarder in various Dublin prisons. At this time, being-
</p>
<p>well known as a centre, he was keeping out of the way.
</p>
<p>Flood was a Wexford man, about thirty, a fine-looking
</p>
<p>fellow, of large proportions, full of energy and daring. Tic
</p>
<p>had been a fisherman.
</p>
<p>" As Byrne possessed all the necessary keys except two,
</p>
<p>two only had to be manufactured viz., a pass-key, and a
</p>
<p>key to the cell door. Of these two moulds in wax were
</p>
<p>taken. The writer (the Eye-witness) has reasons for know-
</p>
<p>ing that these moulds were taken on the h>iday before the
</p>
<p>escape. Who took them need not here be stated."
</p>
<p>This praiseworthy reticence, however, is not imitated by
</p>
<p>the author of a Memoir of Stephens, published in New York
</p>
<p>in 1866, and described by the subject of the narrative a^>
</p>
<p>containing, indeed, a few erroneous statements, but in the
</p>
<p>main quite trustworthy. This writer says, " he who ren-
</p>
<p>dered the most important service was a British official
</p>
<p>high in office, who, for a stipulated sum of money, furnished
</p>
<p>to Colonel Kelly wax impressions of the various locks of
</p>
<p>of the prisons." This points to one person whom we shall
</p>
<p>not name. The Eye-witness, without mentioning the posi-
</p>
<p>tion of this person, gives a bit of description which, coupled
</p>
<p>with the account of the biographer, all but fixes the
</p>
<p>identity of the individual meant. " On Saturday, a gentle-
</p>
<p>man of tall military proportions might have been seen
</p>
<p>entering the precincts of a small, rather dilapidated-looking
</p>
<p>building where he met several confederates. The wax

</p>
<p>models were passed over into the necessary hands. These
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. .119
</p>
<p>impressions," says the biographer, " were taken to a skilful
</p>
<p>workman, still (1866) in Dublin, and from them he was
</p>
<p>ciiablecl to construct skeleton keys, so deftly made, that
</p>
<p>when the occasion came to use them, it was found that
</p>
<p>the prison bolts yielded as easily to them as they did to
</p>
<p>those in the hands of the officials. The keys, which I
</p>
<p>have seen," states the Eye-witness, "were of beautiful
</p>
<p>workmanship, and were evidently the handicraft of an
</p>
<p>expert in the business.
</p>
<p>" On Monday, by a system of signs in use among the
</p>
<p>Fenians, Stephens was apprised of the fact that move-
</p>
<p>ments were on foot for his liberation. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>on that evening he requested that he might have a
</p>
<p>second suit of clothes from his wardrobe, and was sup-
</p>
<p>plied with a suit of black, in which he was dressed
</p>
<p>when he left the prison. He was evidently aware that
</p>
<p>the clothes he had on (being the same which he had
</p>
<p>worn at the time of the arrest and during the examina-
</p>
<p>tion) would expose him to the danger of re-arrest.
</p>
<p>In this he showed remarkable shrewdness ; and in
</p>
<p>so supplying him, the officers in authority showed remark-
</p>
<p>able stupidity. On Wednesday, Stephens was notified by
</p>
<p>signs when the attempt would be made, and what the
</p>
<p>preparations were."
</p>
<p>The "signs" were tolerably loud ones according to
</p>
<p>O'Donovan Rossa. " The day before that of his
</p>
<p>(Stephens') escape," writes Rossa, "one of the prison
</p>
<p>officers, on passing my cell, whispered to me, * The
</p>
<p>little man will be out to-morrow night.* 'Arc you

</p>
<p>* Have you any message to send him ? ' to which I
</p>
<p>answered, 'No.' Next day our attorney, Mr Lawless,
</p>
<p>visited us, and as tlic time of trial was approaching, il
</p>
<p>was deemed necessary that Mr Stephens and Mr Duffy
</p>
<p>would meet Mr O'Leary, Mr Luby, and me. The solicitor
</p>
<p>made the application to the governor of the prison, and the
</p>
<p>governor allowed Mr Duffy to be brought to our con-
</p>
<p>sultation room, which was Mr Luby's cell ; but Mr
</p>
<p>Stephens Avould not be allowed to approach us. We
</p>
<p>remained in conversation for half-an-hour. Duffy whis-
</p>
<p>pered to me that Stephens was going out that night.
</p>
<p>I whispered it to John O'Leary, and as we were parting,
</p>
<p>Mr Lawless said he would renew his application for an
</p>
<p>interview between us and Stephens next morning. We
</p>
<p>said the meeting was absolutely necessary, as our trials
</p>
<p>were to come off on the following Monday. We shook
</p>
<p>hands and parted. In my cell I could not help dwelling
</p>
<p>on the meditated escape. I thought I could keep awake
</p>
<p>all night and keep my ears open for the least noise, but
</p>
<p>the powers of sleep stole a march upon me."
</p>
<p>SoRossa heard nothing of the escape until the morning.
</p>
<p>That escape was originally intended to include all the
</p>
<p>members of the L R. 15. in Richmond Bridewell as well as
</p>
<p>James Stephens. This wholesale release, however, the C. IC.
</p>
<p>opposed, and carried his point ; according to his showing,
</p>
<p>the attempt to rescue so many would prevent the rescue of
</p>
<p>any. He was afterwards openly charged with sacrificing his
</p>
<p>lieutenants in order to secure his own safety ; but to resume
</p>
<p>with the eyewitness.

<p>ties are slumbering in fancied security, not dreaming of

</p>
<p>morning ; and no one (save the three policemen who, with
</p>
<p>singular fatuity, have been placed where they should not
</p>
<p>be,* and Byrne, who is patrolling up and down), is stirring
</p>
<p>within the prison. These forms, which one by one glide

<p>stealthily through the gate, are Irish Americans. A
</p>
<p>loaded revolver is grasped by the hand of each ; and they
</p>
<p>arc prepared if necessary to overpower any police force

<p>Avhich can be aroused within the prison. A hurried con-

<p>dark man, with broad brow, and face indicativ^e of des-
</p>
<p>perate energy and courage, moves along the corridor in
</p>
<p>his stocking feet, shadowily and silently as a ghost. Holts
</p>
<p>and bars have yielded to him like magic thus far ; up the
</p>
<p>dark staircase he has come, making his way, as if by
</p>
<p>intuition, and now he stops before the door of Stephens'
</p>
<p>cell. Could the authorities have got a glimpse of his
</p>
<p>face, they would have seen one who had been in the
</p>
<p>* Bridewell before,' one whom, next to Stephens and
</p>
<p>O'Mahony, they would have delighted to lay hands upon.
</p>
<p>"The clock strikes one; the muffled form, with a

<p>revolver in hand, stands at the door ; the door is at the

<p>back of the corridor, near the head of the stairs ; inside
</p>
<p>stands Stephens, waiting breathlessly for the undoing of

<p>the bolts ; it is evident that he had not suffered his eyes
</p>
<p>to close during the night, thus far ; he is dressed in black,
</p>
<p>as if for a funeral ; and the tempest moans without, as if
</p>
<p>playing a dirge, and while now and then its shadowy
</p>
<p>wings beat wildly against the prison walls. Such is the
</p>
<p>inisc en scene. The storm howls more fearfully for an

<p>instant, and the form before the door proceeds to perform
</p>
<p>its work  the undoing of the bolts. The howling of the

<p>blast prevented the creaking of the bolts from saluting the

<p>The thing is sufficiently remarkable. He, a mere youth,
</p>
<p>known indeed to have bci-n in the confidence of Stephens,
</p>
<p>but of small importance otherwise, was under extra
</p>
<p>surveillance, while Stephens was left to the care of Byrne.
</p>
<p>We can understand why Stephens forgot for an instant
</p>
<p>his intense regard for his own safety, to think a little
</p>
<p>of his devoted instrument. The weakness, however, was
</p>
<p>but momentary ; the tread of the sentinel in the adjoining
</p>
<p>corridor recalled the Head Centre to himself, and he
</p>
<p>hastened to withdraw.
</p>
<p>M'Leod stated that he knew Stephens was escaping,
</p>
<p>but dreaded to sound the gong. He knew that the key
</p>
<p>which opened Stephens' door would open every door in
</p>
<p>the corridor; and he feared, if he gave the alarm, that the
</p>
<p>men would enter his cell and put him to death. " It is

</p>
<p>Stephens would also liave given freedom to Kickham and
</p>
<p>l^rophy, who slept on the same corridor, but no attempt
</p>
<p>was made to liberate them."
</p>
<p>At four o'clock in the morning  Stephens having
</p>
<p>escaped about half-past one  the governor was roused by
</p>
<p>the warder Byrne and apprised of the escape. The doors
</p>
<p>leading to the cell lately occupied by the C. O. I. R.  no
</p>
<p>less than six in number  were found open ; and a duplicate
</p>
<p>Icey was found in the lock of the cell itself  that door of
</p>
<p>course being open also. In one corner of the cell was the
</p>
<p>bed, which evidently had not been slept in that night. It
</p>
<p>was tossed and creased, however, and a railway rug lying
</p>
<p>near it, showed that Stephens had lain down for awhile in
</p>
<p>his clothes. In another corner was a pile of newspapers^
</p>
<p>which Stephens had asked for, as essential to the prepara-
</p>
<p>tion of his defence. The clothes worn on the day of his
</p>
<p>examination lay here and there on the floor; his portman-
</p>
<p>teau was open, and various articles therefrom scattered
</p>
<p>about.
</p>
<p>After all the doors found open had been passed, the
</p>
<p>prisoner would still have been within the bounds of
</p>
<p>the prison. The high outer wall, and the massive iron-
</p>
<p>studded, heavily-barred outer gates would still have been
</p>
<p>between him and liberty. Here the course of the escaped
</p>
<p>prisoner could no longer be traced by the prison officials.
</p>
<p>Two huge tables, taken from the lunatic department of
</p>
<p>the prison, were found one atop of the other, close against
</p>
<p>the wall. To have moved them into this position must

<p>liave been the work of several strong men. But there was
</p>
<p>126 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>no evidence that the tables liacl been used for the purpose
</p>
<p>of climbing the wall. There were no footmarks on the
</p>
<p>tables. The top of the boundary wall was examined. It
</p>
<p>was covered with old loose mortar/ which even a rope
</p>
<p>flung across it would bring down by its weight and friction;
</p>
<p>but there was no trace of a rope having been flung over,
</p>
<p>no trace of anything having crossed it ; it remained
</p>
<p>exactly as it had been for years before. There was no
</p>
<p>tokens of escape in this direction ; and there were no traces
</p>
<p>of footmarks towards any of the outer gates, nor any traces
</p>
<p>of any of these gates having been opened. This, however,

<p>could be accounted for. It was clear, and remains clcar^

</p>
<p>another ; my keeper's observations told me that something
</p>
<p>terrible had liappened, and I concluded tlie bird had
</p>
<p>flown. At eight o'clock next morning, Mr Lawless visited
</p>
<p>and informed us of the terrible news of Mr Stephens's
</p>
<p><jscape, at which I opened my eyes and mouth in amaze-
</p>
<p>ment."
</p>
<p>Rossa had to open eyes and mouth again, through the
</p>
<p>doings of his superior, and that very shortly, but on the
</p>
<p>latter occasion the amazement was perfectly real. It was
</p>
<p>when he received intelligence in prison that no attempt to
</p>
<p>rescue himself or any of his comrades should be attempted.
</p>
<p>I lope, indeed, was still held out to them that they must
</p>
<p>soon be released by the revolution ; how much of this
</p>
<p>they took to their hearts we do not know. But this kind
</p>
<p>of conduct on the part of the C. O. was no novelty to the
</p>
<p>prisoners. Stephens had already shown that he preferred,
</p>
<p>when his most efficient agents fell into the hands of the
</p>
<p>authorities, to leave them therein, rather than countenance
</p>
<p>any attempt to release them. See how he acted with regard
</p>
<p>to Pagan O'Leary.
</p>
<p>** The Pagan," writes Rossa, " did not cease his work
</p>
<p>in prison ; he made friends there too ; and some of
</p>
<p>them proposed to Edward Duffy and myself to effect

<p>the i)roi)osal to ' the Captain,' and he decided that * it
</p>
<p>would bring the strength of our organisation too much

<p>we were taking to relieve the national suffering." Thl.s
</p>
<p>lesson, however, went unheeded by the lieutenants of
</p>
<p>Stephens until their own bitter experience forced it upon
</p>
<p>them. Then, as we have already seen, they understood
</p>
<p>their chief at last, and did not hesitate to express this
</p>
<p>final conviction  " O'Leary, Kickham, Rossa, Luby, and
</p>
<p>the rest could have escaped with Stephens," declared
</p>
<p>Kinneally, one of the Cork chiefs long afterwards, but the
</p>
<p>Captain thought they might endanger his chances. That
</p>
<p>was a strong opinion quietly expressed.
</p>
<p>Denis Dowling Mulcahy says the same thing, but far
</p>
<p>more energetically. We have already given that portion
</p>
<p>of his letter addressed to the editor of TJic IrisJiman, and
</p>
<p>appearing in that journal i ith May 1872, wherein he states
</p>
<p>that Stephens was "a leader who was ever ready to sacrifice
</p>
<p>his best men, and did sacrifice them, to cover his own
</p>
<p>bungles and blunders, and afterwards left them in prison,
</p>
<p>whoi he could have released them, that he alone might have
</p>
<p>the sole honour of escaping, and the entire controul of the
</p>
<p>Organisation, and who was not ashamed to rob his com-
</p>
<p>patriots and fellow-workers of the reward due to their
</p>
<p>merits, their labours, and their devotion,  claiming for
</p>
<p>himself the whole merit of revolutionising Ireland, and,
</p>
<p>I may add, of running away from the ' rising,' or, at least,
</p>
<p>of not returning according to his abundant promises and
</p>
<p>pledges to ' raise the standard of revolt.' "
</p>
<p>We had better go on with Mr Mulcahy's remarks
</p>
<p>in this place ; they fit it well, and will form a suitable

<p>creating  "But prudence is a precious virtue even
</p>
<p>when penal servitude only stares one of Mr Stephens's
</p>
<p>stamp in the face. This gentleman was ignorant of
</p>
<p>nothing but liis own arrogance, ambition, and want
</p>
<p>of pluck. It was sickening to hear this man boast
</p>
<p>of what he would do, when the time came. His dis-
</p>
<p>criminative knowledge of character was so profound and
</p>
<p>thorough, that it led him to select for his private confi-
</p>
<p>dants the three most notorious informers tliat figured
</p>
<p>during the trials, viz., Nagle, Corydon, and Massey, each
</p>
<p>of whom he entrusted with important documents, and sent
</p>
<p>on secret missions of the most serious nature, to the exclu-
</p>
<p>sion of better and abler men whom he had known for years,
</p>
<p>and could liave trusted with his life. Had he from the
</p>
<p>first been left to himself in the selection of men to organise
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, we would have had a rare sprinkling of the
</p>
<p>Nagle, Massey, and Corydon class. That we had so few
</p>
<p>informers was not ^wa to the discrimination of Mr
</p>
<p>Stephens, but to the true and tried men he had
</p>
<p>been introduced to by Mr John O'Mahony and others.
</p>
<p>" He did not regret that his best and ablest colleagues
</p>
<p>were all swept from him in one night. He rather re-
</p>
<p>joiced that they were removed from his path, and
</p>
<p>wrote and spoke as if he, and he alone, could rouse the
</p>
<p>world by one word. He was not the chief to meet the hour

<p>and lead the masses onwards." . . .

<p>have earned to my men in Clonmcl,* and in this way

<p>followed. T was not blind to many of Mr Stephens's

<p>shortcomings ; I diil not recjuire })cnal servitude or

<p>failure to see them ; I believed, however, that the good
</p>
<p>he might accomplish would more than compensate for the
</p>
<p>evil he could do, and I was therefore silent, though I was
</p>
<p>aware how assiduously he laboured to damage my charac-
</p>
<p>ter, which was quite characteristic of the man, when any
</p>
<p>one differed with him. But his dissimulation, and other
</p>
<p>kindred qualities and virtues, have left him without either
</p>
<p>the support or sympathy of his ablest advisers and best
</p>
<p>friends. While I doubted his veracity, I had some little
</p>
<p>faith left in his courage and capability. I believed, when
</p>
<p>the time came, he would fight and die rather than not
</p>
<p>redeem his promise, but time and circumstances have
</p>
<p>fully convinced me that he is no braver than * Bob

</p>
<p>tator than a rebel ; for he lacks the courage, the daring,

<p>the decision, and the resolve of a revolutionary leader.

<p>ractcr of Stephens, Mr Mulcahy attributes to him another
</p>
<p>which we thinic he did not possess  cowardice. The tes-
</p>
<p>timony of Colonel Doheny, given at the outset of this
</p>
<p>hook, shows sufficiently that Stephens had no lack of
</p>
<p>])hysical courai^e. Mulcahys error, however, is one
</p>
<p>i,(Mieral amon<j the surviving members of the I. R. B,
</p>
<p>They will not perceive, what an impartial looker-on
</p>
<p>cannot help perceiving, what, indeed, every circumstance
</p>
<p>in the conduct of James Stephens, from the publication of
</p>
<p>the Chicago resolutions onwards  points to most unmis-
</p>
<p>takably  that, from the period mentioned, the C. O. I. R.
</p>
<p>was working patiently and skilfully for the destruction of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy. He would not have it die suddenly ;
</p>
<p>every measure was calculated to give the catastrophe the
</p>
<p>appearance of springing from events beyond the control
</p>
<p>of the Chief ICxecutive. He meant to destroy the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, for the time, and his enemies within the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy for all time, and simultaneously maintain In's charac-
</p>
<p>ter with the mass of the I. R. B. Did he ever speculate
</p>
<p>on the probabilily of reviving the thing under his own
</p>
<p>sole control at a future period } We may answer the
</p>
<p>question ere we close.
</p>
<p>Here we give another extract  this time from Kinneally,

<p>accepted what appeared to be the stroke of fate, and

<p>pretended to provide for the contingencies it threatened.

<p>doings of the section of the American Fenians, who were
</p>
<p>132 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>working in conjunction with Stephens for the deposition
</p>
<p>of O'Mahony. Speaking of the loss of the documents,
</p>
<p>of which so much was made, Kinneally says  "There
</p>
<p>was a private meeting held where the matter was
</p>
<p>discussed, and where it was proposed to do aivay 2vith
</p>
<p>Meehan, but Stephens would not allow it without
</p>
<p>full proof. Meehan's antecedents did not recommend
</p>
<p>him very highly to us, and we were of opinion that Mr
</p>
<p>O'Mahony might have made a better selection ; but he
</p>
<p>was the representative of the F. B., and as such should
</p>
<p>receive the consideration due to his official position.
</p>
<p>"The envoys made their arrangements and returned,
</p>
<p>Dunne going two days before the seizure of The Irish People
</p>
<p>and the arrests and Meehan shortly after. Before leaving,
</p>
<p>in Oueenstown Dunne told us that all was ready and that
</p>
<p>the F. B. would land thirty thousand men. I said that we
</p>
<p>never expected so many ; that if five thousand, with arms
</p>
<p>for forty or fifty thousand, could be landed, it would be
</p>
<p>all we required. 'Oh,' said he, 'wo can land thirty thou-
</p>
<p>sand.* I had been for a little while accustomed to
</p>
<p>American exaggeration, so I gave the matter no thought.
</p>
<p>Two nights after The Irish People was seized, Luby,
</p>
<p>O'Leary, Rossa, and others were arrested in Dublin, and
</p>
<p>the same night Brian Dillon, John Lynch, myself, and
</p>
<p>two or three others were arrested in Cork.
</p>
<p>" You may think we were taken by surprise, but it was not
</p>
<p>so, though it was thought it might not occur for two or three
</p>
<p>weeks more. A few days before the arrests I was in Dublin
</p>
<p>spending a week with the captain. It was agreed that we

</p>
<p>would soon have trouble, and it was considered advisable
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 133
</p>
<p>to appoint sub-centres, so as to meet any emergency.
</p>
<p>When I returned I gave the other centres the information,
</p>
<p>and each at once called a meeting of his Bs. and told them
</p>
<p>to elect one, in case of necessity, to take the place of the
</p>
<p>centre. Fearing that these might be arrested also, wc
</p>
<p>had three to fdl the places as the others were removed.
</p>
<p>This would avert confusion, and, as it happened a few
</p>
<p>days afterwards when the centres were arrested, other men
</p>
<p>were ready to step into their places, recognised, and fully
</p>
<p>obeyed by all. The night before the arrests J. J. Geary
</p>
<p>asked me not to sleep at home, as I would most certainly
</p>
<p>be arrested ; but, for several reasons, I would not change.
</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, my plan was to remain at my
</p>
<p>post and give- no other person an excuse to shirk duty. I
</p>
<p>was certain we would fight in a few months, and that,
</p>
<p>come what would, wc might remain as wc were. With the
</p>
<p>same prospects and under similar circumstances, though I
</p>
<p>have tasted something of British prisons, I would do the
</p>
<p>same again."
</p>
<p>Immediately after the escape of Stephens, Richmond
</p>
<p>Bridewell was regarrisoned by a body of policemen, and
</p>
<p>every possible precaution taken to prevent the escape of
</p>
<p>the remaining prisoners. There was an elaborate official
</p>
<p>investigation into the whole circumstance, whereby nothing
</p>
<p>was discovered. Byrne, the warder concerning whose
</p>
<p>complicity in the matter there could be no doubt, was
</p>
<p>committed for trial, and the governor of the prison was
</p>
<p>dismissed. The latter disregarded the animadversions
</p>
<p>liberally cast upon him, and made no defence, unless a

<p>very guarded letter to one of the journals, which made no
</p>

</p>
<p>particular statement, can be termed a defence. Byrne
</p>
<p>accepted his fate with evident gratification. Whatever
</p>
<p>came or went he was sure to be regarded thenceforward
</p>
<p>as a martyr, lie was eventually sentenced to seven years'
</p>
<p>penal servitude.
</p>
<p>Two or three days after the evasion of the Chief
</p>
<p>Organiser, a proclamation appeared in TJie Dublin Evening
</p>
<p>Mail offering a reward of one thousand pounds for such
</p>
<p>information as might lead to his arrest, and a further
</p>
<p>reward of three hundred pounds for* information that
</p>
<p>might lead to the arrest of any one harbouring or conceal-
</p>
<p>ing him, or aiding his escape in any way. Neither of
</p>
<p>these rewards was ever claimed. This has astonished
</p>
<p>very simple people, who, having noticed that the I. R. W.
</p>
<p>in Great Britain and Ireland and the Fenians in America
</p>
<p>were invariably forestalled and frustrated in every move-
</p>
<p>ment, and were deprived by arrest of their more formid-
</p>
<p>able leaders precisely at the proper time, cannot conceive
</p>
<p>how here, and here alone, the h^nglish Government was
</p>
<p>altogether at fault. The very fact that here, and here
</p>
<p>alone, the English Government ai)peared at fault ought to
</p>
<p>show that there was something behind, especially when
</p>
<p>this apparent failure is coui)led with the circumstances
</p>
<p>which we have designated. To these circumstances we
</p>
<p>may add the additional one that sufficient time was
</p>
<p>allowed Stephens to make his hiding place and his dis-
</p>
<p>guises secure before the final rewards were offered. In short
</p>
<p>it seems to us pretty clear that those who conducted the

<p>Many people have attributed the immunity of Stepliens
</p>
<p>sul)se(]uent to his walk out of prison to the extraordinary
</p>
<p>devotion of the brotherhood in the first place to their
</p>
<p>chief, and to the precautions taken against treachery by
</p>
<p>Kelly and others in the second place. Now the former
</p>
<p>did not exist to any extent amon^^ the Dublin leaders at
</p>
<p>this period.
</p>
<p>The chief precaution af^ainst treachery  one which had
</p>
<p>tenible effect in after days, but which in no instance re-
</p>
<p>strained a dani^crous traitor  in fact, the most dan[;"crous
</p>
<p>traitors a[)pcared after this precaution wa*s taken, and did
</p>
<p>their work in spite of it  the org-anisation of the "Assassi-
</p>
<p>nation Committee," known as the " Committee of Public
</p>
<p>Safety"  had not yet been perfected. Neither was it
</p>
<p>designed with any special regard to the safety of James
</p>
<p>Stephens. In fact, the " doctor " already mentioned would
</p>
<p>have found small difficulty in making it the means of
</p>
<p>destroying the C. O., had the latter come in his way.
</p>
<p>James Stephens, indeed, was much more troubled during
</p>
<p>the next three months in concealing himself from such
</p>
<p>people as the "doctor," than from the emissaries of the
</p>
<p>J^ritish Government. He opposed the establishment of
</p>
<p>this Conmiittee from the hrst, though not on principles of
</p>
<p>honour or humanity.
</p>
<p>It was merely because he considered it likely to lead to
</p>
<p>the awkward reprisal of the general proclamation of martial
</p>
<p>law. His opinion was disregard, and the Committee was
</p>
<p>formed. It was composed, officers and crew, of ruthless
</p>
<p>men, some of them iron enthusiasts, but the greater portion

<p>mere sanguinary ruffians. In addition to the usual oath of
</p>
<p>136 The Fe7i{an Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the I. R. B., these men took another running as follows : 
</p>
<p>" I^ , hereby solemnly swear and make oath, before
</p>
<p>the Most High God, before whom I expect to be judged,
</p>
<p>that 1 will seek out and leave no means untried utterly to
</p>
<p>exterminate as enemies of Irish liberty any person or
</p>
<p>persons who shall be guilty of perfidy, or of giving to our
</p>
<p>foes  the British authorities  any information which
</p>
<p>shall lead to the arrest or sentence of members of the
</p>
<p>I. R. B." Of this oath writes one of the I. R. B.
</p>
<p>"Nor can any decent objection be urged against the poetic
</p>
<p>justice of it  a species of justice decidedly in vogue with
</p>
<p>the Irish people, and one especially adapted to the fiery,
</p>
<p>ardent, impulsive spirit of the true-born Celt."
</p>
<p>Stephens remained in Ireland for three other months.
</p>
<p>The trials at length began. Against the prisoners there
</p>
<p>was a terrible amount of documentary evidence, but of
</p>
<p>personal evidence not much which, standing alone, would
</p>
<p>have exercised weight with honourable nu'iuKs. The earlier
</p>
<p>informers were of the meanest and most insignificant type.
</p>
<p>There was Timothy Ilegarty, a blacksmith of Cork, who
</p>
<p>became pike-maker to the l^rotherhood in that quarter,
</p>
<p>who fled to London when the first arrests were made, and
</p>
<p>who turned informer partly out of a desire to make money
</p>
<p>by the craft, and partly because the Brotherhood did
</p>
<p>little or nothing for him in his necessity.
</p>
<p>There was " Colonel " Warner, another Cork informer,
</p>
<p>who had changed his creed from time to time to please his
</p>
<p>employers, and who simultaneously joined the I. R. B. and
</p>
<p>the Roman Catholic Church out of disgust at a " heretical "

<p>master who had dismissed him  the excellent Warner  \\\
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 137
</p>
<p>spite of his puritanic bearing. This fellow for a time was
</p>
<p>very devoted to the cause of the revolution, but being
</p>
<p>reduced to take shelter in the workhouse because the
</p>
<p>]5rotherhood refused to maintain him, he became con-
</p>
<p>verted to the cause of law and order, and quite as devoted
</p>
<p>thereto as ever to revolution, as he showed by his informa-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>There was Herman Schofield, a German, who had
</p>
<p>figured in Great Ihitain and Ireland as a lecturer on the
</p>
<p>cause of freedom in general, and of Polish freedom in par-
</p>
<p>ticular, and who, during that particular period of his life,
</p>
<p>used to appear on the platform having at his side one or
</p>
<p>two victims of Russian tyranny, each cleverly got up for
</p>
<p>the occasion, and each with a doleful story of suffering to
</p>
<p>relate. Herman Schofield had found his way to the
</p>
<p>United States, and there, entering into the service of a
</p>
<p>British consul, managed to obtain admission to the Fenian
</p>
<p>head-quarters in Duane Street, New York, and to acquire
</p>
<p>such knowledge of the handwriting of O'Mahony and
</p>
<p>others as enabled him to identify these handwritings in a
</p>
<p>court of justice.
</p>
<p>There was Power, a low-lived scoundrel from Clonmel,
</p>
<p>who was entrusted with a " mission " to " the Captain,"
</p>
<p>and entrusted with a second mission by " the Captain,"
</p>
<p>receiving "money in hand the while." This gentleman
</p>
<p>got gloriously drunk with some part of said money, lost
</p>
<p>the rest, fell into the hands of the police, and, finding
</p>
<p>himself therein, thought the best way of escaping from
</p>
<p>the scrape was by turning informer.

</p>
<p>There was Petite, a pensioned soldier from Manchester,
</p>
<p>138 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>who, as he described it, accepted an enf^agcmcnt as drill-
</p>
<p>master with the I. R. B., and came to Dublin in that
</p>
<p>capacity, havinf^ previously come to an understanding with
</p>
<p>the British authorities. Petite would fain have had his con-
</p>
<p>duct regarded as purest matter of duty. Unfortunately
</p>
<p>for this pretence in the course of the trials, a witness de-
</p>
<p>posed how Petite proposed that they two should become
</p>
<p>informers against the Fenians ; how he  the witness
</p>
<p>against Petite  observed that the thing would be rather
</p>
<p>difficult, since neither of them was personally acquainted
</p>
<p>with P^enianism ; and how Petite overruled the objection
</p>
<p>with the remark, that, as anything they might say would be
</p>
<p>sure to be accepted, personal knowledge was unnecessary.
</p>
<p>Petite was a representative witness in his way.
</p>
<p>George Gilles was another representative witness. Like
</p>
<p>one or two others, he volunteered to give evidence in the
</p>
<p>terror that took possession of him on his arrest. JUit the
</p>
<p>greater terror of the vengeance of the L R. B. overcame
</p>
<p>the lesser terror of any punishment the Government could
</p>
<p>inflict, so he retracted when placed in the witness-box, was
</p>
<p>transferred to the dock, convicted, and sentenced to penal
</p>
<p>servitude, thanking the judge with unmistakeable grati-
</p>
<p>tude for his sentence.
</p>
<p>The most remarkable of the first batch of informers,
</p>
<p>however, was Pierce Nagle. He having been much
</p>
<p>trusted by Stephens, we shall say something about his
</p>
<p>antecedents, as showing the kind of people whom the
</p>
<p>Chief Organiser was most disposed to trust. His father
</p>
<p>was a farm-labourer near Clonmel, himself a pupil in the

</p>
<p>national school of Kilrush, whence, showing some ability,
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 139
</p>
<p>he was transferred to the model school at Clonmel, where
</p>
<p>he was trained as a teacher. When about nineteen he was
</p>
<p>appointed teacher of the national school at Coolmoyne,
</p>
<p>where he showed some enert^y and ability in his profession.
</p>
<p>Here he remained eii^ht years, strongly manifesting two
</p>
<p>characteristics,  vanity and love of money, so stron^^ly, as
</p>
<p>to become the laughing-stock of the neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>When about to quit Coolmoyne he kept the matter to him-
</p>
<p>self, and goiiig round among the i)arcnts of his puj)ils, suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded in obtaining a number of small sums from them,
</p>
<p>on account of future tuition, and also for books which,
</p>
<p>according to him, the pupils required. With these sums,
</p>
<p>and also with various portable articles belonging to the
</p>
<p>school, he disappeared.
</p>
<p>He returned some fourteen months afterwards in
</p>
<p>miserable plight, but managed once again to obtain
</p>
<p>an appointment as national school teacher, this time at
</p>
<p>Powerscourt. Here he was very successful, particularly
</p>
<p>as he added ostentatious patriotism to his other recom-
</p>
<p>mendations. He joined the Brotherhood of St Patrick,
</p>
<p>the most conspicuous of the " legal organisation " with
</p>
<p>which Ireland was then plagued, and the one by means of
</p>
<p>which, and under cover of which, the I. R. B. made such
</p>
<p>amazing progress. Naglc became one of the presidents of
</p>
<p>this order. Thence it was but a step to the I. R. ]5., a very
</p>
<p>easy stc p, one almost inevitable, and that step was taken
</p>
<p>by Nagle, who lent the association much of his time and
</p>
<p>the use of his schoolroom. In his evidence he told that
</p>
<p>various reports of the I. R. B. were written on his official

</p>
<p>still a use to which such pieces of furniture were frequently
</p>
<p>put, especially by "Jack" Ilyland, national schoolmaster
</p>
<p>of Balla^hadereen, and with Edward Duffy, joint Head
</p>
<p>Centre for Connaui^dit, and by Mr Duj^xjun, of Ballincollig,
</p>
<p>Cork.
</p>
<p>Nagle's connection with the I. R. B. led to his neglect
</p>
<p>of his more legitimate duties, his censure by the
</p>
<p>school inspector, and his consequent resignation of his
</p>
<p>appointment, at the desire of the parish priest. This
</p>
<p>was in 1863. He quitted the place when this occurred,
</p>
<p>leaving behind his wife,  a woman possessed in her own
</p>
<p>riMit of a few acres of land,  and a number of debts. He
</p>
<p>then became a book hawker for Messrs Virtue, publishers,
</p>
<p>residing the while at Cork. This appointment he aban-
</p>
<p>doned in December '6'}^, because, as he explained, the
</p>
<p>remuneration was insufficient for his maintenance. Ob-
</p>
<p>taining a letter of introduction to John O'Mahony from
</p>
<p>Denis Dowling Mulcahy * he went to America, where he
</p>
<p>did not long remain.
</p>
<p>He returned to Ireland in January 1864 along with a
</p>
<p>number of Irish-American officers, after O'Mahony had
</p>
<p>refused to pay his fare across and settled in Dublin,
</p>
<p>where he obtained an appointment as chapel keeper,
</p>
<p>and a second and more lucrative one, as folder in the
</p>
<p>office of Tlie Irish People. There are stories told of
</p>
<p>petty larcenies committed by him in the former office,
</p>
<p>of the disappearance of silver candlesticks, and the

</p>
<p>transformation of vestments into handkerchiefs, &c., but
</p>
<p>these have neither been proved nor disproved. From
</p>
<p>The Irish People he received 7s. 6d. a-week, only a retain-
</p>
<p>ing fee, as, having acquired the confidence of Stephens, he
</p>
<p>was often in motion, with messages to the various circles in
</p>
<p>the Soutli. This, as we have seen, excited the indignation
</p>
<p>of Mulcahy, and was denounced by " six pieds," the I. R.B.
</p>
<p>sobriquet of Mulcahy, as a most unwarrantable interference
</p>
<p>with his (Mulcahy's) rights. On these occasions Nagle
</p>
<p>was sup[)lied liberally with " travelling expenses," and his
</p>
<p>wife was paid ;^i a-wcek during his absence. Not content
</p>
<p>with these various emoluments, Mr Nagle found another
</p>
<p>source of gain. Shortly after his return from America, 
</p>
<p>early in 1864, he formed a connection with the Dublin
</p>
<p>police, from whom he received twelve shillings weekly, and
</p>
<p>various gratuities from time to time.
</p>
<p>At this period, be it understood, Mr Stephens had,
</p>
<p>according to his boast, oiganised a body of detectives of his
</p>
<p>own, which, as he likewise boasted, kept him well informed
</p>
<p>of the doings of the rival detective force. He boasted, too,
</p>
<p>that he had contrived a system of espionage over the
</p>
<p>authorities at the Castle themselves ; nor was this latter
</p>
<p>boast altogether groundless. This latter espionage, as we
</p>
<p>happen to know,  a lady admitted to the castle, Mrs P.,
</p>
<p>the daughter of an American naval officer of distinction,
</p>
<p>and the near relative of a certain "obstructive" Irish
</p>
<p>M.l\, being one of the spies,  did obtain him various
</p>
<p>curious [)ieces of information. Then a number of post-
</p>
<p>masters belonged to the 1. R. 15., and the latter acquired

</p>
<p>passing through the hands of the former. The same
</p>
<p>may be said of the telegraph clerks. With these aids, and
</p>
<p>having Nagle under his own eye, it is hard to conceive it
</p>
<p>possible that a man so jealous, so keen, so watchful, and
</p>
<p>so active as Stephens, could not have detected the treachery
</p>
<p>of the informer Nagle at an early date.
</p>
<p>The trials came on, we repeat ; they had been looked
</p>
<p>forward toby all classes, the I. R. B. and their antagonists,
</p>
<p>with intensest interest. All through the day preceding
</p>
<p>the 2d of December Dublin was filled with rumours of all
</p>
<p>kinds. It was confidently stated that the prisoners would
</p>
<p>be rescued on the way to the court ; that there were ten
</p>
<p>thousand men well armed collected for the purpose ; that
</p>
<p>Stephens himself was to lead the attack, and that its suc-
</p>
<p>cess was to be the signal for universal rebellion. As we
</p>
<p>have shown Stephens never contemplated anything of the
</p>
<p>kind.
</p>
<p>The American chiefs, now all powerful, did form a plan
</p>
<p>for releasing the prison.jrs, and something more. The
</p>
<p>government officials were perfectly aware of this ; they
</p>
<p>were aware also of the character of the people with whom
</p>
<p>they had to deal. They knew that the valiant fiery Irish
</p>
<p>masses would not pause to calculate chances, that any at-
</p>
<p>tack whatever would be sure to be joined in l)ytens of thou-
</p>
<p>sands. Certainties also were the failure of the onslaught,
</p>
<p>and the sanguinary defeat of the multitude. In mercy to
</p>
<p>the crowd, such a force was collected and such disposition
</p>
<p>made of it as showed to all but the utterly reckless that
</p>
<p>attack would be madness.

<p>On the morning of the first day the prisoners and
</p>
<p>Events ^;^ 1864. 143
</p>
<p>tlicir escort marched to Green Street uiKllstur1)e(l. Tlic
</p>
<p>c^re.it in.iss of the soldiery had been kept out of si<;ht.
</p>
<p>Jii consequence, when the procession took its way towards
</p>
<p>Richmond Bridewell in the cveninf^, the mob became dar-
</p>
<p>ing;, and stone-throwing began, which threatened for a
</p>
<p>time to grow into a formidable riot. Next morning the
</p>
<p>avenue between the prison and the court was lined with
</p>
<p>soldiers, while batteries of artillery were placed in position
</p>
<p>along it. It was wisely done ; but for this stern demon-
</p>
<p>stration the second day would have been one of bloodshed.
</p>
<p>The view of the powerful force, and the consciousness that
</p>
<p>the authorities meant to use it vigorously if provoked,
</p>
<p>coupled with the exertions of their leaders, kept the mul-
</p>
<p>titude within doors ; the streets along the route were
</p>
<p>comparatively deserted. At night, indeed, they were
</p>
<p>thronged once more ; but the mob confined itself to yells,
</p>
<p>hoots, and groans, all very passionate in their way, but all
</p>
<p>exceedingly powerless to aid the prisoners, or to intimi-
</p>
<p>date the authorities. Such was the scene which Dublin
</p>
<p>presented while these trials lasted.
</p>
<p>Certainly the most remarkable thing about these trials
</p>
<p>was the invariable conviction of the accused. The
</p>
<p>prisoners were Irish every man ; their cause was intensely
</p>
<p>Irish ; their crime one to commend them to all Irish
</p>
<p>hearts ; and their fate was committed to Irish juries. Still
</p>
<p>the verdict was given, " Guilty "  " Guilty on all the
</p>
<p>counts "  to the very last, with startling monotony. Hie
</p>
<p>thing was incomprehensible to the Irish masses ; and
</p>
<p>appalling, too, as were the sentences.

<p>' Luby and O'Leary were sentenced to twenty years'
</p>
<p>144 ^'^^ Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>penal servitude ; Kickham to fifteen ; others to shorter
</p>
<p>terms, varying- from ten to two years. Among the first
</p>
<p>batches  for the next two or three years the Special Com-
</p>
<p>mission was as regular in its sittings as a baker in steady
</p>
<p>business is with his bakings, trying its prisoners in batches
</p>
<p> were Byrne, the warder ; Moore, the pike-maker ; and
</p>
<p>the insolently daring Haltigan, drill superintendent and
</p>
<p>printer of TJie Irish People.
</p>
<p>But the only one of these trials which deserves particular
</p>
<p>notice is that of O'Donovan Rossa, and this rather for the
</p>
<p>bearing of the man therein, and for the picture it furnishes
</p>
<p>of the large section of the I. R. B., of which he was the
</p>
<p>representative, than for anything important,which it brought
</p>
<p>to light.
</p>
<p>The trial began on Saturday, December i6th, 1865.
</p>
<p>Through the whole of the day the wife of the pris(Mier
</p>
<p>was allowed to sit by his side, or close by him at the
</p>
<p>dock-bar. When, however, proceedings were resumed
</p>
<p>on Monday, this permission was withdrawn, because, as
</p>
<p>the judge stated, Mrs O'Donovan had taken advantage of
</p>
<p>the courtesy extended to her, to pass to her husband
</p>
<p>something forbidden by prison regulations. This matter
</p>
<p>disposed of, the prisoner had his say, or rather attempted
</p>
<p>in vain to say something, since the judge declined to hear
</p>
<p>him, save through the medium of his counsel. It soon
</p>
<p>appeared, however, that Rossa had some right to be heard
</p>
<p> what he had to communicate being, that he meant to
</p>
<p>dispense with counsel, and conduct his defence himself
</p>

<p>Tcrsisting In this purpose, his counsel, consisting of Messrs
</p>
<p>liiitt, Dowse, Sidney, ;incl O'Loghlen, rose .'ind quitted tlie
</p>
<p>court  Mr Lawless, the solicitor for the defence, taking his
</p>
<p>place by the prisoner's side.
</p>
<p>To those who knew Rossa this act caused no surprise.
</p>
<p>In dispensing with his counsel, he had two purposes in
</p>
<p>view  one being to insult Judge Keogh as often and as
</p>
<p>deeply as possible whenever he could snatch or make an
</p>
<p>opportunity ; and the other to spin out the time until the
</p>
<p>evening of the following Wednesday, when, as he knew, the
</p>
<p>court would be compelled to adjourn, in order to proceed
</p>
<p>to Cork. Allowing these objects to appear very clearly 
</p>
<p>chuckling openly, too, over the device which he thought
</p>
<p>could not fail to succeed  he read, in monotonous tones,
</p>
<p>for long hours at a time, every document that he could
</p>
<p>fmd any pretext for reading. There were pamphlets and
</p>
<p>newspaper articles  miles of the latter  every column of
</p>

<p>him. Everybody present saw that it was, from the first, a
</p>
<p>duel between the two, that the prisoner had set himself to
</p>
<p>smash Nagle; and that Nagle was just as determined to
</p>
<p>destroy the prisoner. The pair seemed well matched ; for
</p>
<p>Nagle was quite as well acquainted with Rossa, as Rossa
</p>
<p>was with Nagle. "Both of the men looked a hell of hate
</p>
<p>into each other's eyes," remarks a spectator. ICach put
</p>
<p>forth his best  the prisoner trying to entrap the informer ;
</p>
<p>the latter doing his best to foil the effort, or, better still, to
</p>
<p>turn it to the injury of the prisoner. When the advantage
</p>
<p>seemed with Rossa he would hiss to the (Uher that he
</p>
<p>would "give him more of it by-antl-by." 'i'o this Nagle
</p>
<p>would reply that he was " ready for him," and defy him to
</p>
<p>"come on." The cooler-headed informer, however, as the
</p>
<p>contest lengthened, began very evidently to attain the
</p>
<p>superiority. Then Rossa began to question at random,
</p>
<p>with the view of prolonging the cross-examination ; but
</p>
<p>here the judge interposed, and Nagle was removed from
</p>
<p>the table.
</p>
<p>Though Rossa showed some dexterity in cross-examin-
</p>
<p>ing Nagle and one or two others, it was only that kind of
</p>
<p>dexterity which consists in what is known in Ireland as
</p>
<p>'^ cross-haclduigy Otherwise, he did not display the
</p>
<p>smallest knowledge of the laws of evidence. More than
</p>
<p>once his random questions elicited answers very damaging
</p>
<p>to himself On this day (Mo!ulay) there was other
</p>
<p>amusement for the audience besides the combat between
</p>
<p>Rossa and Nagle, in the cross-examination of the detec-
</p>
<p>tives, but here Rossa unquestionably received by far

<p>the worst of it.
</p>
<p>Events in 1864. 147
</p>
<p>On Tuesday came the most singular exhibition of all
</p>
<p>this extraordinary trial ; there is nothing like it on record.
</p>
<p>The prisoner began reading from an enormous printed
</p>
<p>brief all the articles in the Dublin newspapers adverse to
</p>
<p>himself and other prisoners of the I. R. B. " There was a
</p>
<p>score of articles and letters from TJie Daily Expi'css','
</p>
<p>describes the reporter of The Nation, " a great many from
</p>
<p>Saunders, a great many from The Irish Times, several
</p>
<p>from TJic Freeman, the Pastoral of Dr Cullen, also articles
</p>
<p>from the London Times, The Telegraph, The Herald, etc.
</p>
<p>He hardly cared to pretend that he had any serious pur-
</p>
<p>pose in reading them beyond getting over two or three
</p>
<p>hours of time.
</p>
<p>"Then, to the horror of the judge and the despair
</p>
<p>of the jury, he began at the very title-page of 'The
</p>
<p>Chicago Pamphlet' (of eighty pages of closely printed
</p>
<p>matter), and with great fun in his face, observed that
</p>
<p>he meant to read it carefully from cover to cover! The
</p>
<p>jury groaned audibly, the audience tittered, the judges
</p>
<p>frowned. A juror calls on the judge to interpose, but the
</p>
<p>judge hrmly lays it down that the prisoner has a legal right
</p>
<p>to read the whole pamphlet, and he shall do so if he pleases.
</p>
<p>Then, for three mortal hours, the prisoner goes on mono-
</p>
<p>tonously reading away.
</p>
<p>"After three o'clock he fmishes the pamphlet, and
</p>
<p>the jury think their torture is over; but no; but the
</p>
<p>prisoner very pertinently remarks to the effect that
</p>
<p>they are going to shut him up for twenty years, and
</p>
<p>he will spend his few free moments as best he can.

</p>
<p>that he will leave some of the articles for reading on to-

</p>
<p>nation on the bench), he will read the paper from its first
</p>
<p>to its last number! Here, however, he has a check put
</p>
<p>upon him. The judges decide he may read the twenty
</p>
<p>articles noted in the indictment, and all others relating
</p>
<p>thereto and qualifying them, but none other than these.
</p>
<p>"Three hours more reading away, chiefly articles ripping
</p>
<p>up ' Keogh and Sadlier,' * Cawtholic Judges,* * Agitators
</p>
<p>and Perjurers,' and so forth ; the prisoner observing, on
</p>
<p>these occasions, that the judges on the bench are the cul-
</p>
<p>prits alluded to ! Six o'clock has come and gone, and the
</p>
<p>prisoner thinks he has succeeded in killing one day. ' We
</p>
<p>will now adjourn, I suppose, my Lords!' 'Proceed, sir,
</p>
<p>proceed,' is the stern response. Rossa expostulates, it is
</p>
<p>no use, he is foiled. The judges have decided to sit till
</p>
<p>morning rather than allow his plan to succeed, and he has
</p>
<p>not been prepared for this. Seeing the game up, he
</p>
<p>suddenly collapses, and announces that he will go no
</p>
<p>farther! Then, a work of supererogation, the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General sums up, and the Court adjourns at twenty nn'nutes
</p>
<p>past seven."

<p>Wednesday closes this extraordinary trial. The jury

<p>retire at half-past one, deliberate for an hour, and find the
</p>
<p>prisoner *' guilty on all the coiuitsy It is the usual verdict

<p>on these occasions, and therefore the most astonishing
</p>
<p>thing in connection with this conspiracy, which embraced
</p>
<p>nearly the whole of the race to which the jury no less

</p>
<p>Attorney-General stands up and calls attention to Rossa s
</p>
<p>conviction, on pleading guilty, to a similar charge in 1859.
</p>
<p>Rossa attempts  a very feeble attempt  to parry the
</p>
<p>stroke; he utters a passionate denunciation of judge, jury,
</p>
<p>and prosecutors ; the fust is a second Norbury, the second
</p>
<p>is [lacked, and the third has taken every means that is
</p>
<p>foulest to procure his condemnation. Then sentence is

</p>
<p>tence awarded to any of the non-combatant lieutenants of
</p>
<p>Stephens.
</p>
<p>Now that the principal trials were over, it was time for
</p>
<p>Stephens to quit the country. He had remained therein
</p>
<p>long enough to prevent any attempt at rescue, and quite
</p>
<p>long enough for his own safety. He had become obnoxious
</p>
<p>to most of the members of the Committee of Public Safety
</p>
<p>and specially obnoxious to one of its most desperate mem-
</p>
<p>bers, M'Cafferty  the man who had taken such conspicuous
</p>
<p>[)art in his escape from Richmond Bridewell only three
</p>
<p>months before. Ireland, Stephens felt, was getting far too
</p>
<p>hot to hold him. His dignity, however, demanded that
</p>
<p>he should remain until he could obtain a reasonable ex-
</p>
<p>cuse for quitting the country. Such an excuse came early
</p>
<p>in March 1866, in the shape of an invitation  very press-
</p>
<p>ing in its terms  to visit the States, in order, if possible, to
</p>
<p>arrest by his influence the disruption fast in progress n\ the
</p>
<p>Fenian organisation. He accepted this invitation, hurried
</p>
<p>his preparations, and quitted his native country, to which
</p>
<p>he has never since returned, in company with Colonel

</p>
<p>THE ARM FACTORIES OF THE I. R. 15. AND SOME DOINGS
</p>
<p>OF TIM': ASSASSINATION COMMITTEE.
</p>
<p>Kelly and M'Caffcrty, who assumed the lead In the I.R.I),
</p>
<p>after the capture of Stephens, took instant measures to
</p>
<p>make it, as far as possible, independent of aid from else-
</p>
<p>where. They had men in abundance; and England, so
</p>
<p>long neglected by Stephens, was beginning to take the
</p>
<p>place of America in the amount of its remittances. In a
</p>
<p>short time, thanks to the energy of the new chiefs, and
</p>
<p>especially to the promise which their conduct held out,
</p>
<p>the Irish in England entered at least as heartily into
</p>
<p>the conspiracy as their brethren at home and in America.
</p>
<p>How much they contributed will never be known. Some
</p>
<p>idea may be formed of the amount when we find it boasted
</p>
<p>by the I. R. B. themselves, in 1868, that 100,000 shillings
</p>
<p>or ^5000 sterling, were gathered weekly for the cause in
</p>
<p>the metropolis, where the number of paying members
</p>
<p>of the I. R. \\. was set down at 100,000. This was perhaps
</p>
<p>an exaggeration. Allowing, however, that one-half the
</p>
<p>amount was collected, and making a proportionate allow-
</p>
<p>ance for the sums raised in Glasgow, Liverpool, Manches-
</p>
<p>ter, and other large manufacturing towns, where not less

</p>
<p>than a third of the population is Irish, we shall certainly
</p>
<p>The Arm Factories of the I. R. B. 151
</p>
<p>be within the mark, if wc set clown the revenues of the
</p>
<p>I. R. V). under Kelly, at from twelve to fifteen thousand
</p>
<p>pounds sterling weekly.
</p>
<p>Much of this money was misused. Chiefs, organisers,
</p>
<p>agents, and adventurers, were with few exceptions, men
</p>
<p>who lived to enjoy as well as to conspire, and who
</p>
<p>flung away large sums daily on their pleasures. Still
</p>
<p>there was much left to be used for the purposes of
</p>
<p>the Conspiracy, and it was so employed with skill
</p>
<p>and judgment. Stephens, as we have stated, did little
</p>
<p>except organise. A few hundred pikes manufactured
</p>
<p>weekly during the last two or three years of his predomi-
</p>
<p>nance ; a few hundred rifles stolen from the volunteer
</p>
<p>magazines in England by men encouraged to join the
</p>
<p>iMiglish volunteer battalions with this very purpose ; and
</p>
<p>a miscellaneous collection of fire arms of all sorts  rusty
</p>
<p>old muskets, anticpiated pistols, with here and there a
</p>
<p>better weapon,  the whole number being perhaps less than
</p>
<p>5000  obtained by individuals according to their taste and
</p>
<p>means, made up the armaments of the 1. R. B. when Kelly
</p>
<p>acceded to the command. It would have been sheer
</p>
<p>folly to attempt to open a campaign under such circum-
</p>
<p>stances. How could men thus equipped encounter a force
</p>
<p>armed with good weapons of an uniform pattern ? How
</p>
<p>was ammunition to be provided for such an endless variety
</p>
<p>of firearms } The thing was absurd to think of And yet
</p>
<p>some of the I. R. 13. pushed absurdity to its utmost
</p>
<p>extreme in their provision of weapons. Some years after
</p>
<p>Kelly had disappeared from the scene, and all danger of

<p>insurrection in Ireland was at an end, there was dug up
</p>
<p>152 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>on a farm near Cork, once occupied by a Centre, a wooden
</p>
<p>canon, carefully bound round with iron hoops and evi-
</p>
<p>dently intended for service in the field.
</p>
<p>The new chiefs gave a principal portion of their atten-
</p>
<p>tion to arming their followers efficiently. Wherever in
</p>
<p>England firearms were to be procured, there agents were
</p>
<p>established. Decidedly the ablest of these agents was
</p>
<p>** Colonel " Ricard lUnkc  so well-known in connection
</p>
<p>with the ClerkenwcU explosion. A good deal of romance-
</p>
<p>has been written about this man by himself and others.
</p>
<p>He has been credited with high birth, great and varied
</p>
<p>acquirements, and stirring adventure in many lands. The
</p>
<p>simple facts of his story are these. He was the son of a
</p>
<p>small farmer of Macroom, County Cork. He enlisted in
</p>
<p>the South Cork Militia, wherein he attained the rank of
</p>
<p>sergeant, and from which he deserted in May i860. We
</p>
<p>next find him serving in the 15th New York Volunteers
</p>
<p>during the war of Secession, and winning his way to the
</p>
<p>rank of captain. Here he was a prominent member of the
</p>
<p>Fenian Circle, known as " the Brothers Shears Circle."
</p>
<p>Whether he had joined the I. R. B. while in the South Cork
</p>
<p>Militia, or not, we cannot say. But it is probable that he
</p>
<p>had, and that his desertion was the consequence. He was
</p>
<p>one of the numerous adventurers who left the United
</p>
<p>States for Ireland in 1865. Here he first rendered himself
</p>
<p>remarkable among the I. R. B. by his connection with "the
</p>
<p>Committee of Safety." Of this Committee Burke was, for
</p>
<p>a period, president.
</p>
<p>He left Dublin for Birmingham in December '65. In

<p>the latter place he took premises at 64 George Street
</p>

</p>
<p>Parade, which he used as warehouse and office. He
</p>
<p>represented himself as the agent of certain American
</p>
<p>Hrms for the purchase of arms and munitions of war,
</p>
<p>i^nVing his name as Winslow. This was a cleverly chosen
</p>
<p>alias, for there was a Winslow connected with the
</p>
<p>I. R. Vi. who resembled I^urke much in personal appear-
</p>
<p>ance, but whose duties, such as they were, confined him to
</p>
<p>the South of England.
</p>
<p>In Birmingham Ikuke was assisted by one Casey, who
</p>
<p>eventually was arrested in his company, and by Shaw, or
</p>
<p>Mullady, who was executed in Manchester, for his share in
</p>
<p>the slaughter of Sergeant Brett. Burke remained in Bir-
</p>
<p>mingham until the end of February, '65  little more than
</p>
<p>two months  during which he purchased guns," pistols, and
</p>
<p>other war material to the value of ^2000. These things he
</p>
<p>sent in parcels to Liverpool, where they were shipped as
</p>
<p>drapery goods in the name of Messrs Cook and Townsend,
</p>
<p>a firm of drapers in Liverpool, and consigned to Messrs
</p>
<p>Daly and Company, drapers, Cork.
</p>
<p>By the end of February '66 the informer Corydon was
</p>
<p>fully at work, and 15urke*s agency was among the things he
</p>
<p>disclosed. A descent was immediately made on the ware-
</p>
<p>house, but Burke had received an intimation of what was
</p>
<p>about to take place, and in consequence disappeared. The
</p>
<p>place, too, was cleared of everything. Not even a cat
</p>
<p>was found on the premises. How Burke received his in-
</p>
<p>formation is variously told by those who ought to know.
</p>
<p>I le was winning in person and manners, genial tempered,
</p>
<p>lively, fertile in fancy, overflowing with anecdote, which he

<p>could tell gracefully, had a good voice, and sang with
</p>
<p>154 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>taste. On the whole, there were few more pleasing com-
</p>
<p>panions than he. We have heard it asserted that Corydon
</p>
<p>liimself apprised him of what was coming. Again, we
</p>
<p>liave been informed that notice of the intended visit of the
</p>
<p>police was conveyed to him by a female connected with
</p>
<p>one of the policemen. The latter kind of thing was not
</p>
<p>unusual during the fiercer period of the Fenian conspiracy.
</p>
<p>** General " Bourkc, alias Beecker, used to tell how well he
</p>
<p>was served in this way by the wife of an Irish policeman,
</p>
<p>Avho, on one occasion, handed him a copy of the " Hue and
</p>
<p>Cry," containing his description, which had been sent to
</p>
<p>her husband. "Thaire Giniral, Jewell," said the female,
</p>
<p>** the paper will be of more use to you than to him."
</p>
<p>These rollicking adventurers, indeed, made great way
</p>
<p>Avith the softer sex. More than one romantic story is told
</p>
<p>of their love. " Colonel " O'Connor, while evading pursuit,
</p>
<p>was secreted for some days by the niece of a Protestant
</p>
<p>-clergyman. The lady accompanied the " Colonel " to
</p>
<p>America as his wife, and this furnished the late Charles
</p>
<p>Lever with matter for one of his novels, " Lord Kil-
</p>
<p>gobbin." Captain Mackay married shortly before his
</p>
<p>arrest, and thus drew a good deal of sympathy to
</p>
<p>what was otherwise a case of deep interest. Massey,
</p>
<p>one of the two leading informers, made a love match
</p>
<p>immediately prior to the outbreak projected for the 7th
</p>
<p>of March, '67. It was the opinion of Cluseret and
</p>
<p>others, and stated by himself, that attachment to his wife,
</p>
<p>and that alone, was the motive that induced him  who
</p>
<p>had really distinguished himself as a soldier  to play the

<p>M'Caffcrty, too, had his bonnes fortunes, and many of

<p>ferocious character, was the anxiety he displayed after his

<p>But the new chiefs of the L R B. did not rely on pur-

<p>chase for a suitable provision of war material. In Dublin
</p>
<p>they established a number of manufactories of arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition. Prominent among these were the places
</p>
<p>where the stuff known as " Greek hire " was compounded.
</p>
<p>Great reliance was placed on it ; in fact, the mass of the

<p>reverence. Supplied with it, they considered themselves

<p>invincible. They were always craving for it, and oc-

<p>casionally using it, sometimes involuntarily, and to their

<p>own consternation. The thing was stored in glass bottles,

</p>
<p>This gentleman, who had studied chemistry at one of
</p>
<p>the Queen's Colleges, and passed a good examination
</p>
<p>in the science, and who, therefore, was fully competent
</p>
<p>for his post, bore the imposing title of " Chief of the
</p>
<p>Scientific Department." Under him were several other
</p>
<p>" doctors," and a number of artificers who had been decoyed
</p>
<p>from the laboratories of the English Government. The
</p>
<p>place in Ballybough Road was his central office, as
</p>
<p>well as his central manufactory. He had the general
</p>
<p>superintendence of all the arm factories in Dublin, those of
</p>
<p>pikes excepted.
</p>
<p>One of these factories was established in ]51ackhall
</p>
<p>Row, off Patrick Street. The said row consists prin-
</p>
<p>cipally of butchers' stalls. Of one of these, which
</p>
<p>had long been vacant, the I. R. B. obtained posses-
</p>
<p>sion, still keeping it shut up. Here pikes were fitted
</p>
<p>with handles, bullets were cast, and percussion caps
</p>
<p>manufactured. Here also the manufactured articles were
</p>
<p>stored previous to distribution. The raw material, as
</p>
<p>copper, etc., was kept elsewhere, as, in most similar cases,

<p>in the house of the foreman, who was generally the
</p>
<p>The ylrin Factories of the I. R, B. 157
</p>
<p>nominal tenant of the workshop. There was a similar
</p>
<p>factory in Frances Street, another in North Anne Street,
</p>
<p>and numerous others in various parts of the city. Far more
</p>
<p>important than any of these, however, was the factory in
</p>
<p>South Earl Street. It was elaborately fitted up. There
</p>
<p>was a valuable lathe for turning metal; there were fur-
</p>
<p>naces, smelting pots, whitesmith's tools, a carpenter's
</p>
<p>bench and tools,  everything, in fact, requisite for manu-
</p>
<p>facturing pikes, rifles, pistols, and cartridges, including
</p>
<p>explosive bullets.
</p>
<p>One more remarkable still, especially for the circum-
</p>
<p>stances connected with it, which give us a view of the work-
</p>
<p>ing of the Committee of Safety, that is the Assassination
</p>
<p>Committee, as well as of the "Scientific Department of the
</p>
<p>1. R. P).," was situated \w Loftus Lane, at the back of the
</p>
<p>house number 20.I Great Ihitain Slreet. The building,
</p>
<p>which had been used as a stable, was two stories high,
</p>
<p>and there were extensive vaults beneath, entered from
</p>
<p>the outside. The place was shut up from observation ;
</p>
<p>it stood in a garden, was surrounded by high buildings,
</p>
<p>and could only be approached through a narrow passage,
</p>
<p>which was closed by a heavy iron door, keys of which
</p>
<p>were in the possession of two persons of trust.
</p>
<p>On the 3d of January '66, this place was taken by a per-
</p>
<p>son giving the name of Thomas Barry. He stated that he
</p>
<p>wanted it for a cabinetmaker's shop. He resided at 80
</p>
<p>Capel Street  where, as was customary in those cases, the
</p>
<p>raw material for use in the factory was stored. Having
</p>
<p>obtained possession of those " desirable premises," the

</p>
<p>158 TJic Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>thing was to block up the windows in the upper story and
</p>
<p>to open others in the roof ; thus all risk of being over-
</p>
<p>looked from the outside was averted. A bricklayer, a
</p>
<p>member of the l^rotherhood of course  one George Clark
</p>
<p> was then introduced, and he built a furnace for smelt-
</p>
<p>ing. The necessary carpenter's work was done by Tracy,,
</p>
<p>the foreman of the Blackball Road establishment. After-
</p>
<p>wards was smuggled in the plant, including a lathe
</p>
<p>imported from Birmingham, worth not less than ^^40.
</p>
<p>The place was at once in full blast. Hand grenades and.
</p>
<p>Orsini shells were manufactured by the score ; great
</p>
<p>quantities of fulminating bullets were turned from brass
</p>
<p>rods to fit rifles of American construction, .specimens of
</p>
<p>which were kept on the premises. Common bullets, too,
</p>
<p>were cast in heaps ; and military belts, with bra-ss clasps
</p>
<p>bearing the Irish harp, were manufactured. So were pike
</p>
<p>heads of a new and elegant pattern. So busy were the
</p>
<p>hands  some fifteen or twenty  that they slept and ate
</p>
<p>on the premises. By the 7th of February following the
</p>
<p>furnaces were burnt out and required reconstruction.
</p>
<p>Clark was named to do the woilc, and at once received
</p>
<p>his commission from the chief of the Scientific Department
</p>
<p>The latter was a plausible man of loose habits, in-
</p>
<p>sinuating manners, much fluency, plenty of humour, and
</p>
<p>a good deal of seeming generosity, which he never hesi-
</p>
<p>tated to gratify at the expense of other people when his
</p>
<p>own means failed. With his jauntincss, his show of
</p>
<p>hearty frankness, and his readiness to drink with every-
</p>
<p>body, he was exceedingly popular with the I. R. 35. Of

</p>
<p>much likeness to him in character, he was, with two
</p>
<p>exceptions, ''the Doctor." The exceptions were, "Dr"
</p>
<p>Power  the double of Stc[)hens  and Doctor K .
</p>
<p>This j.iinUy, pleasant ^i;cntlcinan, with his racy Cork
</p>
<p>brogue, and his winning salute  " Delighted to see ye, be
</p>
<p>gorra ! ! come and take a dlnink"  this thoroughly re-
</p>
<p>presentative man  that is within the conspiracy  was a
</p>
<p>thoroughly cool, calculating scoundrel, who cared for
</p>
<p>nothing but himself and his pleasures, which last were of
</p>
<p>the grossest kind. He was deep in the confidence of the
</p>
<p>chiefs of the I. R. B., and lavishly remunerated by them.
</p>
<p>He was also deep in the confidence of the police, ever
</p>
<p>since the arrest of Stephens, and remunerated by them also.
</p>
<p>In nothing did he display the special cunning with which
</p>
<p>he was gifted, more than in his dealings with the police.
</p>
<p>He took good care that no information given by him
</p>
<p>should betray the giver to his associates ; and he was
</p>
<p>careful never to tell the police too much. He gave them
</p>
<p>valuable hints from time, but never once said anything
</p>
<p>likely to be fatal to the I. R. ]^>. That would have de-
</p>
<p>stroyed his double profession of spy and " Chief of the
</p>
<p>scientific department."
</p>
<p>Well, after due deliberation, the "Doctor" made up
</p>
<p>his mind to sacrifice the establishment in Loftus Lane
</p>
<p>to the police. The workmen were cleared out, lc\avi ng
</p>
<p>the place just as it was, full of plant, manufactured
</p>
<p>articles, and raw material. Clark was expected in a few
</p>
<p>miiuites, when, the place being altogether tenantless, the
</p>
<p>police walked in. The seizure was a valuable one; property

<p>to the amount of over Zqo sterling fell into their hands.
</p>
<p>i6o The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>It was the heaviest blow that had befallen the cause since
</p>
<p>the raid on the office of TJie Irish People.
</p>
<p>The news spread fast over the city, filling- the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood with consternation and wrath. There was a general
</p>
<p>cry of treachery, and a demand for vengeance quite as
</p>
<p>general. " Now was the time for the Committee of Safety
</p>
<p>to show its value," was the exclamation of the masses ;
</p>
<p>and coupled with that exclamation were significant hints
</p>
<p>of what would happen in case the duty were neglected.
</p>
<p>A meeting of the chiefs was held that same evening in a
</p>
<p>brothel, Street. It was presided over by an Ameri-
</p>
<p>can, and was largely composed of brother adventurers.
</p>
<p>Courtesans and conspirators alternately sat round a large
</p>
<p>table covered with bottles, glasses, &c., while the matter
</p>
<p>was discussed in slang impenetrable to the frail sisters.
</p>
<p>Here " the Doctor" demonstrated that Clark, the brick-
</p>
<p>layer, Avas the traitor. For the other men employed he
</p>
<p>could answer. Not one of them had quitted the i)lace
</p>
<p>during the previous forty-eight hours ; none had held
</p>
<p>communication with the outside ; none anticipated the
</p>
<p>cessation of work at that particular time ; he had marched
</p>
<p>them from the stable to the tavern, where he kept them
</p>
<p>hard drinking and well in sight, until news of the police
</p>
<p>invasion reached him. The Doctor's anMunents were
</p>
<p>considered conclusive. It was unanimously voted that
</p>
<p>the " tool " was worse than useless, and must be " de-
</p>
<p>stroyed ; " that is to say, Clark was sentenced to death,
</p>
<p>and the " Doctor " was commissioned to superintend the
</p>
<p>execution.

</p>
<p>A few hours later an order, written on the curl-paper
</p>
<p>The Ar7n Factories of the I, R. B, i6t
</p>
<p>of a courtesan, was carried to the President of the
</p>
<p>Assassination Committee, directing him to select men
</p>
<p>for the deed. One of these men was to commit the
</p>
<p>nuirdcM' ; llie others were to shoot their comrade should he
</p>
<p>show any token of faltering-. The men were selected by-
</p>
<p>lot ; one o( them was shortly afterwards arrested as a con-
</p>
<p>spirator, and sentenced to a long term of penal servitude ;
</p>
<p>another was sent across to England, where in less than
</p>
<p>six months he met a terrible death by accident.
</p>
<p>But the execution could not take place at once ; there
</p>
<p>were reasons for such a course on which we need not dwell.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it was whispered that the traitor had been
</p>
<p>discovered, and would be duly dealt with. Half Dublin
</p>
<p>remained in terrible expectation for the next ten days.
</p>
<p>At length, on the evening of Friday, the 17th of
</p>
<p>February, the deed was done. Farly that evening
</p>
<p>Clark was met by the " Doctor," as if by chance, at the
</p>
<p>corner where Capcl Street joins Abbey Street. The
</p>
<p>]J)oclor, after a few words, and the usual drink, inquired
</p>
<p>whether Clark could assist two other men whom he named
</p>
<p>in removing a couple of boxes from the Circular Road
</p>
<p>into the city. Clark agreed to do so. The pair then
</p>
<p>walked forward to Bethesda Church, Dorset Street, where
</p>
<p>they met the other men. Thence the party went on by
</p>
<p>the Black Church, Dominic Street, over the drawbridge
</p>
<p>by the Broad Stone, thence along the Grand Canal to the
</p>
<p>next bridge, and so on until they reached the large mills
</p>
<p>called " Mallet's Folly." Here they found the way blocked
</p>
<p>up, so that further advance in that direction was impos-
</p>
<p>sible.

<p>II. L
</p>
<p>1 62 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>They paused a moment to deliberate as to what was
</p>
<p>to be done next. While they were talking, poor
</p>
<p>Clark heard the rapid but stealthy tread of two others
</p>
<p>coming up. It was then quite dark. By this time the
</p>
<p>Doctor and his companions had decided to go back, and,
</p>
<p>indeed, had turned to do so, when one of the new-comers
</p>
<p>rushed up to Clark and dealt him a heavy blow with a
</p>
<p>bludgeon on the back of the head which stupified him.
</p>
<p>He staggered against the wall, from which he rebounded,
</p>
<p>still wavering. Recovering a little, he exclaimed, " Good
</p>
<p>God! what have I done.? Murder! murder!" Hardly
</p>
<p>was the last word uttered when a shot was fired full in his
</p>
<p>face, taking effect in his neck, and striking him senseless
</p>
<p>to the ground. The others then ran. This was about
</p>
<p>ten o'clock at night.
</p>
<p>Close at hand is a row of houses called " Margaret's
</p>
<p>Place," on the south bank of the canal. One of those
</p>
<p>houses was in charge of a policeman, then off duty,
</p>
<p>who heard the report. Running out, he made in the
</p>
<p>direction from whence it came. As he approached,
</p>
<p>lie heard some whispering, but could see nobody. Imme-
</p>
<p>diately after a pistol was discharged so close, that, to use
</p>
<p>his own expression, " the smoke blinded him." Clearing
</p>
<p>his eyes he pursued the assassins, but had not gone many
</p>
<p>yards before a second shot was fired at him by another,
</p>
<p>who ran in the same direction as the first. The two were
</p>
<p>immediately joined by a third, who kept pace with them
</p>
<p>as they fled, the policeman still pursuing. The chase ter-
</p>
<p>minated at Prospect Terrace, where the fugitives crossed

<p>the garden wall of a lady named Waters, and disappeared.
</p>
<p>The Arm Fado^^ies of the I. R. B. 163
</p>
<p>Finding furtlier pursuit useless, the officer hastened
</p>
<p>to the nearest  the Glasnevin police station  and
</p>
<p>related what had happened. He was accompanied
</p>
<p>to Mallet's Folly by a sufficient force. At the mill
</p>
<p>they found Clark lying on his back, and apparently
</p>
<p>dying from loss of blood. They carried him to the Mater
</p>
<p>Misericord iie Hospital, where his case was at once pro-
</p>
<p>nounced hopeless. The bludgeon wound on the back of
</p>
<p>the head was an ugly one,  dangerous at least had it
</p>
<p>stood alone ; but the wound dealt by the pistol shot was
</p>
<p>mortal. Having been aimed from above downwards, it
</p>
<p>had struck the neck, cutting the jugular vein and inflicting
</p>
<p>a wound four inches long where it entered ; then it had
</p>
<p>passed through the body, injuring the spine, and making
</p>
<p>its exit at the back.
</p>
<p>When brought to the hospital Clark was very weak
</p>
<p>through loss of blood. He retained his consciousness
</p>
<p>until late on Saturday night. His depositions were
</p>
<p>taken ; he spoke with reluctance and would not say
</p>
<p>anything to fix the crime on anyone ; what he told was
</p>
<p>valueless as evidence. He mentioned no names, desig-
</p>
<p>nating his slayers as "the doctor" and "the men,"
</p>
<p>and making no allusion whatever to the surprise of
</p>
<p>the armoury in Loftus Lane. On Saturday night the
</p>
<p>spinal injury produced paralysis. The murdered man fell
</p>
<p>into a stupor which lasted till Sunday morning, when he
</p>
<p>died.
</p>
<p>A reward was offered for the apprehension of the
</p>
<p>murderers, and some search was made after them, but

<p>without result. No word was breathed in public concern-

</p>
<p>ing the cause of the deed, beyond a whisper of suspicion
</p>
<p>that " Fenianism was at the bottom of it." The members of
</p>
<p>the Brotherhood, however, knew very well that the surprise
</p>
<p>of the armoury was the crime laid to the charge of Clark,
</p>
<p>and that he had paid the penalty  dcatli. The body that
</p>
<p>gave the award was well known among the fraternity, and
</p>
<p>was thenceforward dreaded. The murder gave unlimited
</p>
<p>power over the I. R. B. to the new chiefs. It showed that
</p>
<p>they were fearfully in earnest. It was followed by many
</p>
<p>another, though it was in one respect the most appalling
</p>
<p>of any, for it is now acknowledged that the man was no
</p>
<p>traitor. We have been thus diffuse because the crime is
</p>
<p>in all respects a specimen of its class. For the same
</p>
<p>reason we shall give a little space to tracing the after
</p>
<p>career of **the doctor," as we have no wish to mention
</p>
<p>him again, and indeed shall have no occasion for doing
</p>
<p>so.
</p>
<p>He continued to play his double part until December
</p>
<p>^66 ; then, seeing that the game of Fenianism was near its
</p>
<p>end, and wishing to escape from its ranks, as a safe way
</p>
<p>he directed the police to the establishment in Ballybough
</p>
<p>Road, and procured his own arrest much about the same
</p>
<p>time, in the character of a very minor conspirator. In
</p>
<p>prison he remained for a considerable time, without trial,
</p>
<p>proving very useful to his employers as a spy on his fellow
</p>
<p>prisoners. Released at length, in a way not calculated to
</p>
<p>arouse the ire of the Brotherhood, he crossed to England,
</p>
<p>with a considerable sum in his possession. It was soon
</p>
<p>dissipated in licentious indulgence ; but the doctor was a

<p>man of resources. The leading chiefs, baffled and pursued,
</p>
<p>The Arm Factories of the I. R. D. 165
</p>
<p>were continually In motion, partly to secure their own
</p>
<p>safety and in part to get up some desperate enterprise or
</p>
<p>other, whose execution should still enable them to main-
</p>
<p>tain their sway over their followers. There was no end to
</p>
<p>their moving to and fro and to their disguises. It was an
</p>
<p>c)p[)ortunity which rogues of a certain class among the
</p>
<p>I. R. B. did not neglect to turn to their own advantage.
</p>
<p>A perfect swarm of Kellies, Daceys, M'Cafferties, and even
</p>
<p>of Stei)henses sprang up all over the empire and reaped a
</p>
<p>rich harvest from the dupes, who were eager in aiding them
</p>
<p>with money to baffle the English officials, and to promote
</p>
<p>"the good cause."
</p>
<p>The doctor took to personating the great Head
</p>
<p>Centre himself, to whom he bore some resemblance,
</p>
<p>among the brotherhood and sisterhood of Lancashire.
</p>
<p>From one enthusiastic lady he extracted ;^I5; other
</p>
<p>persons he mulcted in smaller sums ; and an earnest
</p>
<p>patriot, whom we shall not stigmatise as a fool,  because
</p>
<p>there was a something high and admirable in the self-
</p>
<p>sacrifice he displayed,  having nothing of his own to give,
</p>
<p>actually enlisted and handed over the bounty he received
</p>
<p>to the soi-disant Stephens.
</p>
<p>This kind of thing, however, could not last witliout
</p>
<p>bringing him who practised it into much peril. The
</p>
<p>doctor, therefore, made his way to London. Here
</p>
<p>he looked up the leading brethren, whom he laid under
</p>
<p>contribution. He was employed, too, though not so
</p>
<p>lucratively as when he was " Chief of the Scientific

<p>six months the doctor continued to denounce his brothers
</p>
<p>of the I. R. B. to such an extent that three-fourths of the
</p>
<p>arrests then made among them are set down to his credit.
</p>
<p>At length suspicion began to attach to him ; so the doctor
</p>
<p>made up his mind to abandon the trade of secret informer.
</p>
<p>This he did in characteristic fashion.
</p>
<p>He wrote a letter to his friend the inspector, asking
</p>
<p>an interview "at the clock pillar, near the Angel, Isling-
</p>
<p>ton." The inspector met him as appointed. Here
</p>
<p>the doctor informed him that the chiefs of the I. R. B.
</p>
<p>were about to meet in Council in Paris under the
</p>
<p>presidency of Roberts.* He added that he himself
</p>
<p>had been summoned to attend, but that he was desti-

<p>very plausibly told. The inspector advanced ^20, and

<p>Ireland sometime early in 1863. In reality it had always
</p>
<p>been in practice there. Stephens himself is supposed to
</p>
<p>have received ^1500 a-year for his services. When the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood became flourishing, that was his nominal salary.
</p>
<p>His lieutenants, all needy men, lived on the society, as
</p>
<p>Ivossa, Duffy, and others. And there were payments con-
</p>
<p>tinually being made, which, while assuming to be in the
</p>
<p>interests of the I. R. B., were really gratuities to those who
</p>
<p>received them.
</p>
<p>Paid organisers were first appointed in the United States
</p>
<p>after the Congress of Chicago. O'Mahony's own salary
</p>
<p>was fixed at 2000 dollars a-year. Doran Killian, the
</p>
<p>financial secretary ; W. Griffen, treasurer ; C. H. Chatter-
</p>
<p>ton, chief clerk ; P. J. Dowring, secretary for civil afifairs ;
</p>
<p>General B. E. Mullen, secretary for military affairs, received
</p>
<p>each 1 500 dollars yearly. There were an Inspector-General,
</p>
<p>an Adjutant-Cjcneral, a Chief of Artillery, and eight other
</p>
<p>officials, eleven in all, each having 1200 dollars yearly ;
</p>
<p>there were seven receiving 800 dollars, one 720 dollars,
</p>
<p>three 624 dollars, two 520 dollars, and one 400 dollars

<p>yearly. All these were connected with head quarters.
</p>
<p>1 68 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Then the members of tlie Central Council received each
</p>
<p>5 dollars a-day and expenses. One of the officers already-
</p>
<p>mentioned, General Mullen, received the additional pay of
</p>
<p>his rank in the American service, and two permanent
</p>
<p>officers, Colonels Kelly and Mulcahy, who had 1200 dollars
</p>
<p>a-year, the one as adjutant-general, the other as inspector-
</p>
<p>general, received the additional pay of 2 dollars a-day each.
</p>
<p>Then there were eighteen organisers, each receiving 70
</p>
<p>dollars a-month and expenses ; and one special organiser, of
</p>
<p>whom we shall have something to say, at the same salary.
</p>
<p>These too were permanent officers.
</p>
<p>But the sums we have specified, large as they were, by
</p>
<p>no means covered the total drawn by these officers. We
</p>
<p>find, by the official report for the first four months of 1866,
</p>
<p>the sum drawn by ordinary organisers to amount to 8885
</p>
<p>dollars, and that drawn by special organisers, most of
</p>
<p>whom were otherwise employed by the F. B., and only re-
</p>
<p>ceived these missions as special organisers, by way of
</p>
<p>relaxation and reward, at 5045" dollars. The whole account
</p>
<p>for organisation during these four months amounted to
</p>
<p>13,930 dollars.
</p>
<p>During the same period the postage and telegraph
</p>
<p>account came to 1242 dollars ; the printing and stationary
</p>
<p>account ran up to 5028 dollars ; the contingent account,
</p>
<p>or moneys disbursed for i)urchasing copies of friendly
</p>
<p>newsi)apers, and for occasional exi)enses, reached 6.128
</p>
<p>dollars. In the last account a certain W. V. Meehan
</p>
<p>is mentioned twelve times, and had a total attached to his
</p>
<p>name of 1270 dollars, as "petty cash disbursements."

<p>the miserable Campo Bella affair, reached 35,336 dollars.
</p>
<p>J n what was called "secret service," were spent 13,336
</p>
<p>tlolhirs. The sahiries of subordinates reached a total of
</p>
<p>12,948 dollars, this includes O'Mahony's stipend for other
</p>
<p>duties than those discharged by him as Head Centre, a
</p>
<p>thing in which he was imitated by many another. There
</p>
<p>was an expense account, monopolised by Doran Killian,
</p>
<p>and William Griffin, amounting to 439 dollars. The Con-
</p>
<p>gress and Central Council account came to 4752 dollars,
</p>
<p>and there was a bond account reaching 7018 dollars.
</p>
<p>The total disbursements of the F. B., from January to April
</p>
<p>the 23d 1866, was 104,401 dollars. To this must be added
</p>
<p>65,728 dollars despatched to Europe, 10,823 dollars dis-
</p>
<p>tributed among refugees, and 30,000 dollars paid for a
</p>
<p>privateer. There were besides large sums which were
</p>
<p>never accounted for, and in several instances clear cases of
</p>
<p>swindling were brought home to various members of the
</p>
<p>Ihotherhood. We give a specimen or two. JkTore the
</p>
<p>committee appointed to investigate expenditure, &c., in
</p>
<p>1866, the following little bit of evidence was given among
</p>
<p>much of the like sort. General Mullen, speaking of the
</p>
<p>purchase of the privateer, "Shibley, first asked 40,000 dollars
</p>
<p>for her, but was willing to take 37,500. Mr Killian told
</p>
<p>me to buy the vessel as cheap as I possibly could. I saw
</p>
<p>Mr Peercc Skeehan and asked him to take the ownership
</p>
<p>of the vessel. He wanted first to consult a lawyer, one in
</p>
<p>our interest. I ordered him to buy the vessel. Mr Skeehan
</p>
<p>desired to fee the lawyer ; 1 granted him (Mr Skeehan)

<p>character. The vessel was bought foi; 29,500 dollars ;
</p>
<p>1 70 The Fenia7i Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>I drew a draft for 30,000. Mr Skcchan claimed that he
</p>
<p>had saved 500 dollars for the Brotherhood, stating that he
</p>
<p>had purchased her for 29,000 dollars. Mr Skechan desired
</p>
<p>to give me, and then to Colonel O'Mahony, this 500 dollars
</p>
<p>balance, but we told him to tender it to the Secretary
</p>
<p>of the Treasury, the proper party to receive it. Here
</p>
<p>we find the following minute interplaced in the report
</p>
<p>of the books of the . B.,  "Show the price paid for
</p>
<p>the vessel as 30,000 dollars, whereas she actually cost but
</p>
<p>29,000,  the 1000 dollars difference not being paid back
</p>
<p>to the treasury."
</p>
<p>Another minute states that a certain Mr Wynne gave
</p>
<p>General Mullen 500 dollars as a gift to the cause on
</p>
<p>the representations of Mullen (which have since proved
</p>
<p>false) that he had several war vessels and twenty
</p>
<p>thousand stand of arms." Again, it was stated that
</p>
<p>" General Mullen borrowed 500 dollars from this Mr
</p>
<p>Wynne, which the F. B. paid back." Mullen also
</p>
<p>announced officially that he had various armed steamers
</p>
<p>stationed on the Pacific coast of America, prepared
</p>
<p>to move on "an objective point"  a statement which
</p>
<p>was totally false. On one occasion "a military con-
</p>
<p>vention," which sat four days, cost the F. 11 " about
</p>
<p>7000 dollars." (3'Mahony, an unwilling witness, admitted
</p>
<p>that " there were too many organisers on pay  some were
</p>
<p>a?i ifictibns ; they were very expensive." General Mullen

<p>travelled repeatedly with Stephen Joseph Meany, who,
</p>
<p>Organiser Sy etc. 171
</p>
<p>as an organiser, was a still more remarkable curiosity,
</p>
<p>and who is thus sketched by a writer in The Ulster
</p>
<p>Observer  " Who is this Stephen Joseph Meany ? He
</p>
<p>was a rebel in 1848. He was one of the fortunate few
</p>
<p>wlio enjoyed an easy and luxurious confinement, which
</p>
<p>gave them ever afterwards a sort of relish for arrests,
</p>
<p>and a longing for the inside of her Majesty's prisons.
</p>
<p>He made his terms with the Government, and was
</p>
<p>released, wearing all the honours of martyrdom a\ iLhout
</p>
<p>any of the traces of its sufferings. If we mistake not,
</p>
<p>Belfast was the scene of his first operations in his new
</p>
<p>character of ransomed rebel, and there is many a dole-
</p>
<p>ful creditor who tells to the present day how he was
</p>
<p>duped out of his money and goods by the plausible
</p>
<p>jiatriot, who recited the fiction of his miseries in
</p>
<p>]<.ichmond jail. He was employed as a reporter on
</p>
<p>The WJiig, and soon disqualified himself by his mis-
</p>
<p>conduct, for any position in that or any other respect-
</p>
<p>able establishment. His career after he left Belfast,
</p>
<p>was a continuation of the swindles he perpetrated
</p>
<p>here, and which are too notorious to need recapitula-
</p>
<p>tion. He tricked his creditors, deserted his wife, aban-
</p>
<p>doned his children, and fell to the lowest depths of degra-
</p>
<p>dation. He was in the poorhouse, came out of it, and at
</p>
<p>length had his course of villany (there is no other word for
</p>
<p>it) cut short by being arrested for frauds committed in the
</p>
<p>London exhibition. He was tried, found guilty, and sen-
</p>
<p>tenced to imprisonment with hard labour. On the expira-

<p>172 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Mr Meany has a whole chapter devoted to him in Mr John
</p>
<p>Savage's " Fenian Heroes and Martyrs." The said chapter
</p>
<p>covers twenty-three pages, while but a single chapter of
</p>
<p>thirty-one pages is allotted to John O'Mahony, Michael
</p>
<p>Doheny, and James Stephens, the three celebrities of
</p>
<p>l^'enianism. Savage says not a single word of Meany's
</p>
<p>escapades, or of the troubles in which they involved him.
</p>
<p>lliey were matters of which an intimate, who was also a
</p>
<p>professional journalist, could not have been ignorant, and
</p>
<p>yet Savage used to be known among the Ihethren as
</p>
<p>"honest John." How Mr Meany organised may be
</p>
<p>gathered from a few notices concerning him in the
</p>
<p>" Official Report of the Investigating Committee," printed
</p>
<p>in 1866, page 72.
</p>
<p>" F. B. to J. Kavanagh and S. J. Meany, D.R.
</p>
<p>" To expenses Special Organizing to Baltimore, 75 dollars.
</p>
<p>(Signed) "J. Kavanagh and S. J. Meany."
</p>
<p>" The voucher above shows that 75 dollars was drawn to pay-
</p>
<p>expenses of trip to Baltimore, but received while there 500 dollars
</p>
<p>bond money, to be handed to the Secretary of the Treasury on their
</p>
<p>return. They presented bills for expenses, incurred by public meet-
</p>
<p>ings, &c., of 320 dollars, leaving a cash balance for the Brotherhood
</p>
<p>of only 180 dollars. Admitting the expenses were legitimate, neither
</p>
<p>Mr Kavanagh or {sic) Meany Iiad authority to appropriate any por-
</p>
<p>tion of the 500 dollars bond money for any purpose whatever."
</p>
<p>On page 27 of the report we find Mr Meany mentioned
</p>
<p>thus :
</p>
<p>" Stephen J. Meany, District Cenlrc of Ohio and Orf^aniscr, received

<p>Article read to Committee from a Cincinnati paper, stating ' tliat Mr
</p>
<p>Mcany bad given, in payment for board, a cheque to the Bcnnet
</p>
<p>House on a Toledo Bank when he had no deposit.'"
</p>
<p>The borrowing of tlie money from Devine is mentioned
</p>
<p>attain on ]aj^c 29, with the following remark applyint^ to
</p>
<p>all the officials of the V. ]x, as well as to Meany :  "These
</p>
<p>men, in their official capacity, borrowed and used Fenian
</p>
<p>funds for their own private use."
</p>
<p>Meany was himself examined by the Investigatinc^ Com-
</p>
<p>mittee. It is only fair to cite his evidence:  "I have
</p>
<p>never received, directly or indirectly, any money from the
</p>
<p>F. B. but my expenses. The total amount I have received
</p>
<p>will probably reach about 400 dollars, or 500. In making
</p>
<p>out my vouchers for expenses in the West during January
</p>
<p>and February 1866, I accidentally made an error in the
</p>
<p>total amount of 100 dollars  an arithmetical error. The
</p>
<p>bill was presented with the error. It was signed by Mr
</p>
<p>Killian, and endorsed by the II. C. Mr Griffin made his
</p>
<p>warrant for the erroneous amount (all unknowingly). On
</p>
<p>presentation of warrant to Mr Meelian, assistant-treasurer.
</p>
<p>I called his attention to the fact as per original warrant.
</p>
<p>I refused Ihc additional lOO dollars, erroneously charged,
</p>
<p>and the extra money was returned. My action was en-
</p>
<p>dorsed by Mr Griffin, who remarked, in the presence of
</p>
<p>several parties  * If we had many such honest men as you
</p>
<p>in this organisation, our finances would be in a better con-
</p>
<p>dition.' I cast myself into the organisation at a sacrifice

<p>of business, and great inconvenience, and made the tour

<p>inaugurated by the Robcrts-Swccny party. With Mr
</p>
<p>Cronin, a paid organiser, I agitated the Brotherhood
</p>
<p>there; I had interviews with friends and foes; called two
</p>
<p>public meetings at an expense of hall hire, of ten dollars
</p>
<p>each night ; I paid printing and advertising, as per
</p>
<p>vouchers, on each occasion. The hall was packed by
</p>
<p>our opponents with an armed force who threatened
</p>
<p>assassination. Still Mr George Francis Train was listened
</p>
<p>to, and I succeeded in reading the report of the Conven-
</p>
<p>tion. During my tour for the Brotherhood in Chicago, I
</p>
<p>paid each and every expense called forth by public meet-
</p>
<p>ings, such as hall hire, printing, &c. ; and none of the
</p>
<p>money received or expended was for individual purposes.
</p>
<p>I also visited Milwaukee, where we had a public meeting,
</p>
<p>and after which the Circle there ordered all their funds to
</p>
<p>be sent to these headquarters, amounting to five hundred
</p>
<p>dollars, and an endorsement of Colonel O'Mahony. The
</p>
<p>sisterhood also sent their funds on. At Cine innati we
</p>
<p>had a crowded meeting highly enthusiastic and successful.
</p>
<p>I visited Drayton, Columbus, Steubenville, Lavittsburg,
</p>
<p>and thence to New York. I never charged to the organ-
</p>
<p>isation any money but absolute legitimate expenses for
</p>
<p>travelling, and such as were really necessary.

<p>"About January I2th, I received lOO dollars from the

<p>he had not so much at his disposal, but he gave mc 25
</p>
<p>dollars, for which he is credited in my vouchers. Our
</p>
<p>hotel bill (Mr Cronin and myself) was then 89 dollars 50
</p>
<p>cents, being for nearly three weeks. The proprietor of the
</p>
<p>Burnet House* took my acceptance as security for his
</p>
<p>bill on March ist, ten days hence. I never gave a draft
</p>
<p>on a bank in Toledo. I returned to New York, received
</p>
<p>money, and forwarded 1 00 dollars to Mr T. C. Bartlett, of
</p>
<p>the Toledo Commercial, to take up the note. Mr Bartlett
</p>
<p>was then, by some strange mischance, on a visit to this
</p>
<p>city, unknown to me, and in no way did I learn that the
</p>
<p>note had not been taken up, until March 19th, when on
</p>
<p>my way to Philadelphia, Mr Bartlett drove up and handed
</p>
<p>me back the money, it being mailed to this city to him
</p>
<p>from Toledo. I then promptly refunded the money, and
</p>
<p>have since sued the proprietors of the newspaper, charging
</p>
<p>me with fraud.

<p>(" An apology from the paper shown as follows) :

<p>proprietor of a hotel in this city, in the lurch, to the ex-
</p>
<p>tent of a board bill of 89 dollars. The bill has since been
</p>
<p>paid, and the public is informed that the reason of its
</p>
<p>non-payment was simply because of a slight misunder-

<p>standing.'

</p>
<p>In the foregoing testimony concerning himself given by
</p>
<p>Mr S. J. Meany, there are several things worthy of notice.
</p>
<p>It is an outline which applies to all the paid organisers as
</p>
<p>well as to himself. We see how they worked, sometimes
</p>
<p>in the face of stern opposition, for the American Fenians
</p>
<p>did not form a very happy family. That these organisers
</p>
<p>did not fare altogether as Spartans while at work, appears
</p>
<p>from the modest hotel bill **for nearly three weeks," amount-
</p>
<p>ing to very nearly 90 dollars. But by far the most curious
</p>
<p>bit in this evidence is that which concerns the bill containing
</p>
<p>the "arithmetical error" of 100 dollars  :s.\\ o^xxox against
</p>
<p>the Brotherhood, though Mr Meany omitted to say so.
</p>
<p>We find it passed by three different officials without
</p>
<p>detection, which is the more remarkable, since the bill
</p>
<p>itself was about as short as it could well be.
</p>
<p>Such oversights, however, were not uncommon with
</p>
<p>Fenian officials  quite as common, indeed, as such
</p>
<p>" arithmetical errors," which last were common enough.
</p>
<p>Here is a sample (given page 71, Report) :

<p>Tlicre arc other bills presented by the same gentleman
</p>
<p>cited in the Report, all being of the like kind. We need
</p>
<p>hardly say tliat those we have given are not exceptional.
</p>
<p>Mr Rodgers, it may be added, was a member of the
</p>
<p>Central Council, for which he drew five dollars a day, con-
</p>
<p>triving to add also a number of items,  as " paid for
</p>
<p>meals for members of the C. C," "apples," etc.,  which
</p>
<p>considerably more than doubled the amount.
</p>
<p>Nor were the members of the C. C, the paid organisers,
</p>
<p>and so forth, content with such liberal allowance for them-
</p>
<p>selves. A good many of them took care to (juarler needy
</p>
<p>relations on the treasurer. The " Official Report," page 43,
</p>
<p>makes the following statement:  "John Killian (cousin of
</p>
<p>13. D. Killian) told us (the members of the Investigating
</p>
<p>Committee) that B. D. K ordered his wages raised
</p>
<p>from ten dollars to twelve dollars weekly. He was placed
</p>
<p>not used <\o\\x\ stairs. His services were unnecessary." Mr
</p>
<p>Killian had a reason for doing this, which is worth quoting.
</p>
<p>* Mr B. D. Killian told me," testifies Mr M. J. Hefferman,
</p>
<p>" that the F. B. was not doing much any way, and that
</p>
<p>the best it could do was to help a poor man's family.
</p>
<p>John Killian was put on duty to assist a man, in place of
</p>
<p>one who was discharged by Mr B. D. K  a few days
</p>
<p>previous, because said man's services were useless.

<p>" I saw that business was being neglected," continues
</p>
<p>1 80 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Mr HefTcrman, " by men whom Mr Killian employed, 
</p>
<p>Mr Russcl for one. He was a decent man, but his ser-
</p>
<p>vices were unnecessary, and for this he was paid 100
</p>
<p>dollars a month. Mr John H. Rogers, brother of Mr
</p>
<p>J. J. Rogers, was unnecessary  salary 100 dollars per
</p>
<p>month. Mr Charles Timon's services were unnecessary
</p>
<p>and superfluous {sic)  8cK) dollars per year. James M'Nery,
</p>
<p>Bond Department, services unnecessary. I considered the
</p>
<p>Assistant Treasurer unnecessary; and the Treasurer (Mr
</p>
<p>Griffin) was a mere ornament. I think there was a good
</p>
<p>deal of superfluous help in the Civil Department under
</p>
<p>the charge of Colonel Downing. One good man and two
</p>
<p>boys would have done the work of that department."
</p>
<p>Then there were officers employed and paid by the F. B.,
</p>
<p>for whose employment there was not the shadow of a
</p>
<p>pretext. Turning to page 69 of the Official Report we
</p>
<p>find the following passage : 
</p>
<p>" Voucher 112. " New York, December 1 1///, 1865.
</p>
<p>" F. B. to four officers of I. R. Navy, Dr. allowed, . 20 dollars.
</p>
<p>" B. DoRAN Killian.
</p>
<p>Approved "John O'Mahony, II. C. F. B.
</p>
<p>" No Irish Navy in cxislencc at this time. No officers' names sub-
</p>
<p>mitted in voucher."
</p>
<p>]kit the Ileatl Centre and his lieutenants were not
</p>
<p>merely reckless, negligent, and given to employing useless
</p>
<p>officers ; they were something more. One can hardly
</p>
<p>understand how such a thing could liave occurred as is
</p>
<p>related (with a good deal of softening, it may be fairly
</p>
<p>presumed) by John O'Mahony to the Investigating Com-

<p>" Captain Gaynor and his company were the men wlio

<p>demanded from me the Eastpool money. They did not

<p>then I money!'
</p>
<p>We shall sh< >rtly have occasion to mention other extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary inst;tiices of misappropriation of Fenian funds.
</p>
<p>For the present, however, we have done enough to show
</p>
<p>what kind of men organised and managed this unique
</p>
<p>conspiracy. And in showing this much, we show also
</p>
<p>what sort of government would have been instituted in
</p>
<p>Ireland, had the conspiracy achieved success.
</p>
<p>The organisers of the I. R. B. were not a whit better
</p>
<p>than their fellows west of the Atlantic. They kept their
</p>
<p>secrets better, however, for the most part. It is only in-
</p>
<p>directly that we obtain a view of their conduct, save
</p>
<p>in rare instances  as in the case of " Doctor " Bell. What
</p>
<p>sort of man he was, it is easy to surmise from the data
</p>
<p>which we intend to lay before our readers. He is the
</p>
<p>author of the following letter : 
</p>
<p>" Thursday, loth April 1865.
</p>
<p>" Dear Doctor (Doctor Power, the double of Stephens) I sent
</p>
<p>you something yesterday, which was miserable enough in all con-
</p>
<p>science ; but if you were short of ' copy,' it might help to fill a
</p>
<p>vacuum which newspapers, like nature, are unable to endure. I am
</p>
<p>glad that you returned in time to be with your good lady during her
</p>
<p>illness. I earnestly hope that she is out of all danger. Your uncle
</p>
<p>held a ' prayer meeting' in Westminster last night, I was not pre-
</p>
<p>sent during the devotional exercise, nor have I seen him to-day to
</p>
<p>learn die result. I find a letter from Sheffield this morning, in which
</p>
<p>it is staled that the * knife-grinding' business is rapidly and steacHly
</p>
<p>increasing in and around that capital of cutlery. I shall be there on
</p>
<p>Monday next, and if you have any instructions to give mc, you can

<p>address me in care of Mr James M'Kay, 16 Dorking Street, Si)ittal
</p>
<p>1 82 The Feniaji Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Hall, Sheffield. I have read the forty-page despatch ; it is very
</p>
<p>miserable. I wish to God, or ' to the other buffer,' that somebody
</p>
<p>would * hang a calf-skin round the recreant limbs' of those peddling
</p>
<p>poltroons in New York. What in hell do they mean .? These meti
</p>
<p>ivill never do the necessary work. It is out on them, G d
</p>
<p>them. No ; in one form or another, yon must do it yourself. Ever
</p>
<p>your attached and sanctified friend, J. RoiUNSON, a relative of the
</p>
<p>world-renowned Jack."
</p>
<p>The author of the foregoing pretty letter was specially
</p>
<p>recommended by Stephens to the I. R. \\. of London, who
</p>
<p>wanted an editor for a paper started in the interests of the
</p>
<p>fraternity towards the end of 1864. Here Mr David Bell
</p>
<p>did not give satisfaction. Indeed, the London Head
</p>
<p>Centre, Thomas Hayes, who invested a considerable simi
</p>
<p>in TJie Irish Liberator, the journal referred to, and lost it,
</p>
<p>accused his editor of swindling himself and the other
</p>
<p>proprietors. Mr Bell therefore ceased to conduct The
</p>
<p>Irish Liberator, even before the paper ceased to exist, and
</p>
<p>subsided into his old trade of lecturer. When, however,
</p>
<p>Mr Stephens saw that the end was at hand, he dealt with
</p>
<p>Mr Bell as he dealt with a good many more, stopped the
</p>
<p>remittances. This drew from the gentleman in question
</p>
<p>a letter which we quote, for a good many reasons.
</p>
<p>^''Jlotel de I'' lores, 12 Rue Lacipede,
</p>
<p>Paris, Friday, ^ist October 1865.
</p>
<p>" Dear John Your letter of Saturday, the 14th of October, came
</p>
<p>here all right. In it you kindly stateil that, in a very short time,
</p>
<p>assistance would be sent to me. How far this promise has been
</p>
<p>kept, you know as well as 1 do. Perhaps you do not know, and 1 hope
</p>
<p>you never will, what it is to be without a friend or a franc in a strange
</p>
<p>land. The question is, Arc we to be helped, or to be left to perish.
</p>
<p>For the latter is the only alternative left myself, and to others whom

<p>longer persevered in. At great risk and sacrifice every way we have
</p>
<p>Organisers^ etc. i83
</p>
<p>induced one of our unfortunate number to represent the state of our
</p>
<p>affairs. He will return here immediately, if successful on his mission.
</p>
<p>If not, it matters little what becomes of any of us. Will you be good
</p>
<p>enough to inform our friend \\v.\\. a sum of about ;^34 is the pay due
</p>
<p>to me alone, and that if it, or any part of it, be at once forwarded, it

<p>will indeed be a welcome deliverance. Perhaps you <:ould get some
</p>
<p>trustworthy person to call on 'Mrs Ward, 4 Talbot Place/ Talbot.
</p>
<p>Street, near the Droglicda Railway terminus. There are two port-
</p>
<p>vuuilcnus of mine and a hat-casr. Affix cards on them with the
</p>
<p>enclosed address, put them on the railway, and send them here.  I
</p>
<p>am, dear John, your obliged and faithful servant, J. B. J. Harris."
</p>
<p>The foregoing- doleful letter contrasts curiously with
</p>
<p>the documents which we have given respecting the
</p>
<p>American organisers. The latter were always promptly
</p>
<p>and liberally paid ; nor was there ever any particular
</p>
<p>scrutiny of their bills, so that "arithmetical errors" fre-
</p>
<p>quently passed unnoticed. Messrs Rogers and Company
</p>
<p>had a pleasant time of it. Not so the organisers employed
</p>
<p>by James Stephens. He paid those who were devoted to
</p>
<p>himself tolerably well  so long as they were useful ; but
</p>
<p>when they ceased to be useful, then, devoted or not, they
</p>
<p>were abandoned to be dealt with as fate inclined. Ste-
</p>
<p>phens was not " penny wise and pound foolish" in any of
</p>
<p>his doings. Conduct like this just noticed procured him
</p>
<p>bitter enemies ; he knew well that such would be the
</p>
<p>result. That he, therefore, pursued it in every instance,
</p>
<p> for as Bell was treated, so were all his lieutenants
</p>
<p>treated, notably Edward Duffy  is strong proof that he
</p>
<p>considered the conspiracy at an end.
</p>
<p>But all the organisers were not of the stamp of Rogers,
</p>
<p>Meany, and Bell. Among them were men thoroughly

</p>
<p>talent too, overflowing with courage, and unquestionably
</p>
<p>and purely patriotic. To have taken part in such a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy  to have associated with such companions and
</p>
<p>to have served under such leaders as the conspiracy gave
</p>
<p>them  these were something more than indiscretions. An
</p>
<p>excuse, liowever, for the folly and the guilt of their course
</p>
<p>as I'enians, may be found in the circumstances under
</p>
<p>which their characters were formed. These circumstance s
</p>
<p>were such as to render hatred of English domination ;i
</p>
<p>leading sentiment in them ; and to make them look upon
</p>
<p>active hostility to England as the first of duties.
</p>
<p>Conspicuous among the nobler organisers was Thomas
</p>
<p>Francis Bourke. He was only twenty-five Avhen he accepted
</p>
<p>the post, early in '65. He had but just been mustered out
</p>
<p>of the Federal army, where he had served with distinction.
</p>
<p>Of humble origin  the son of an Irish emigrant, and him-
</p>
<p>self born on Irish soil  a working house-painter, clever at
</p>
<p>his craft, remarkable for industry and filial afi"ection, he
</p>
<p>had contrived to educate himself  or at least his senti-
</p>
<p>ments  to a remarkable extent. Not one word was ever
</p>
<p>whispered in America against his character. J lis employ-
</p>
<p>ment as an organiser in the States was lucrative, and gave
</p>
<p>him high influence among the l^rotherhood, but in spite of
</p>
<p>the entreaties of the Head Centre, he threw it up to take
</p>
<p>part in the fighting which, in common with so many
</p>
<p>others, he anticipated for 1866 in Ireland. Here he was
</p>
<p>appointed "paymaster" to the American officers, with
</p>
<p>the rank of " Colonel "  and discharged his duties to the
</p>
<p>satisfaction of his comrades, until his capture in arms a

<p>Organisers, etc, 185
</p>
<p>Even more distinguished than Bourke, was " Captain "
</p>
<p>Michael O'Rorkc. He was a year younger than the
</p>
<p>former, and was well-known, under the name of /^r^r/'r;-, as
</p>
<p>paymaster of the Fenian organisation in England. Born
</p>
<p>in Ireland, he emigrated at an early age to the United
</p>
<p>States. In 1859 he joined the Phoenix Brigade. In 1862
</p>
<p>this body offered its services to the Federal government ;
</p>
<p>by this O'Rorke had attained the rank of lieutenant.
</p>
<p>Later in the year he received his commission as captain.
</p>
<p>He fought through the war, and saw his father killed by
</p>
<p>his side at Spottsylvania in 1864. A few months later he
</p>
<p>was himself taken prisoner. Released by exchange in
</p>
<p>February 1865, he returned to his regiment, with which
</p>
<p>he remained till the close of the war. About the ist
</p>
<p>of July 1865, he returned to New York. He was at once
</p>
<p>informed that the F. B. required his services in Ireland,
</p>
<p>and within a fortnight he was on his way thither, reaching
</p>
<p>his destination July 27th. Here he spent three months in
</p>
<p>visiting various parts of the country, principally the west.
</p>
<p>After the seizure of The Irish People, and the numerous
</p>
<p>arrests that followed, O'Rorke was peculiarly busy ; he
</p>
<p>had to discharge the duties of many of those arrested in
</p>
<p>addition to his own. Some of these duties led him,
</p>
<p>almost daily for months, to visit houses most noted, and
</p>
<p>whose inmates were already under police supervision.
</p>
<p>But S(; cleverly did he evade the vigilance of the detectives,
</p>
<p>such an adept was he in adopting disguises, that the police
</p>
<p>never gained sufficient knowledge of his person to enable
</p>
<p>them to identify him.

<p>When the Habeas Corpus Act was suspended, it was the

</p>
<p>duty of Captain O'Rorke not only to see every officer not
</p>
<p>yet arrested almost daily, but to visit the lodgings of those
</p>
<p>who had been arrested, to look after their effects, and to
</p>
<p>settle any claims against them which might have been left
</p>
<p>unpaid. When Stephens left Dublin, in March 1866, he
</p>
<p>commissioned O'Rorke to send all the officers yet at large
</p>
<p>into England. This was done, and funds being placed in
</p>
<p>his hands for their support, he received the appellation of
</p>
<p>"paymaster." With these officers he crossed the channel,
</p>
<p>where he remained for some time ; the number under his
</p>

<p>later other and more important duties were added to those
</p>
<p>of paymaster. These compelled him to visit every district
</p>
<p>in England once a month. Once a month also had he to
</p>
<p>cross to Dublin to make his official report as Inspector-
</p>
<p>General of the English branch of the I. R. B. During these
</p>
<p>peregrinations he had many hair-breadth escapes. It was
</p>
<p>a matter of rivalry between him and Corydon, as to which
</p>
<p>of the two should vanquish the other  the one in escaping,
</p>
<p>the other in baffling attempts at escape. On one occasion
</p>
<p>the Liverpool police received very accurate information
</p>
<p>concerning the whereabouts of this formidable conspirator.
</p>
<p>They surrounded the house, arrested all its inmates, and
</p>
<p>seized every article in the place. Among these articles
</p>
<p>was a trunk belonging to O'Rorke ; as to the captain him-
</p>
<p>self, he had sailed the day before for Dublin. The cir-
</p>
<p>cumstance excited his suspicions, though he had not the
</p>
<p>remotest idea as to the person who had given the informa-
</p>
<p>tion. Thenceforward he took even more precautions ;

</p>
<p>IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ARRESTS IN '65.
</p>
<p>One of the most significant of the consequences of the
</p>
<p>seizure of TJie Irish People office  or rather of the events
</p>
<p>wliich led thereto  events which were very well known to
</p>
<p>the Roman Cathohc clergy  was the decided tone taken
</p>
<p>thenceforward with regard to the I. R. 1^. and the F. 1^. by
</p>
<p>the papacy. As we have shown, there was previously a
</p>
<p>good deal of uncertainty here. There were prelates who
</p>
<p>condemned the conspiracy without reserve, as did the
</p>
<p>great body of the Irish prelates ; and there were other
</p>
<p>prelates, especially in America, who encouraged the con-
</p>
<p>spirators with various degrees of approval. There were
</p>
<p>priests, too, who laboured to show that the Celtic con-
</p>
<p>spiracy against luigland was not included among the
</p>
<p>secret associations which the Church anathematised.
</p>
<p>From the middle of 1865, all this was altered. The
</p>
<p>Church condemned the I. R. 13. and the F. B. unequivo-
</p>
<p>cally. Thenceforward there was no coquetting with
</p>
<p>either by prelates in America or in England, and no
</p>
<p>attempts to apologise for the conspiracy by parish priests.
</p>
<p>On the 19th of August 1865 (Meehan's documents had

</p>
<p>graphs appeared in the l^altimorc Mirror: 
</p>
<p>" The Right Reverend Dr Wood, of Philadelphia, has
</p>
<p>sent us the following missive from Rome, in relation to
</p>
<p>the position of the Holy See towards the Fenians, in
</p>
<p>which it will be seen that the decision attributed to that
</p>
<p>august tribunal, by certain Fenian journals of this country,
</p>
<p>is pronounced to be utterly false : 
</p>
<p>Translation.
</p>
<p>"The Sacred Cong, Inq. has desired me to signify to your Lord-
</p>
<p>sln'p, that the assertion made in certain newspapers, to the effect that
</p>
<p>thee following decision had been given by the Holy See, to wit.
</p>
<p>Fenianos no7i esse ifiquietandos  TJic Feniajis are not to be disturbed
</p>
<p> is utterly false. I communicate this at the request of the aforesaid
</p>
<p>cont;regation, lest it should be sui)posed by any one that a!iy thing
</p>
<p>in favour of this society has emanated from the Holy See. In the

<p>"The Holy See is slow in its deliberations. Before
</p>
<p>sanctioning or condemning this Society, great care is taken
</p>
<p>by the duly authorised tribunal to inquire into its cha-

<p>racter, motives, the means it employs to accomplish its
</p>
<p>objects, and its strict conformity with the teachings and
</p>
<p>discipline of the Church. The hierarchy in those coun-
</p>
<p>tries where such society may have existence, are consulted
</p>
<p>and upon their opinions and counsel the judgment of the
</p>
<p>sacred Tribunal mainly rests. As the bishops of Ireland,
</p>
<p>with very few excei)tions, and several prelates on this
</p>
<p>continent have openly disapproved of the ]''enfan Society,
</p>
<p>it seems improbable that that organisation will obtain the

</p>
<p>tendencies which the Fenians have of late frequently and
</p>
<p>everywhere exhibited, cannot tend to enhance the estima-
</p>
<p>tion in which they are held at Rome."
</p>
<p>Much about the same time the Archbishop of St. Louis
</p>
<p>took occasion of the pompous funeral of a leading Fenian
</p>
<p>(that of IT. O'C. McCarthy), to denounce Fenianism in
</p>
<p>still stronger terms in a published address, which closes
</p>
<p>thus : 
</p>
<p>" I liave furthermore directed the superintendent of the Calvary
</p>
<p>Cemetery not to admit any procession of men or women, bearing the
</p>
<p>insignia of Fenians within the gate of the cemetery. I use this occasion
</p>
<p>to state pubhcly, what I haveuniformally stated in private conversation,
</p>
<p>that the members of the Fenian brotherhood, men or women, are not
</p>
<p>admissible to the Sacraments of the church as long as they are united
</p>
<p>with that association, which I have always regarded as immoral in
</p>
<p>its object  the exciting of rebellion  and unlawful and illegal (sic)
</p>
<p>in its means, a ciuasi-military organisation in this country while at

<p>peace with England, to be made effective in the event of war with
</p>
<p>that power.

</p>
<p>More significant still of the attitude now taken up by
</p>
<p>Rome towards the conspirators, is the following document
</p>
<p>which was circulated privately among the I. R. B. during
</p>
<p>the closing months of 1865. It was designed to excite
</p>
<p>the animosity of the people against the higher classes as
</p>
<p>their deadly enemies, the priests being included in a body
</p>
<p>among these enemies for the fnst time. 'JMie document is
</p>
<p>so full of the spirit of the conspiracy as it aniinated the

<p>they contemplated, and on the confidence they still
</p>
<p>reposed in their conspiracy and its chief organiser, that
</p>
<p>we give it at length : 
</p>
<p>" Against our cause a portion of the clerics of all dis-
</p>
<p>tinctions {sic) are arraigned, ikit let it be understood that
</p>
<p>these men are well paid by the English Government, they
</p>
<p>arc well fed and well housed. They can have the best
</p>
<p>things which the world can give them ; they live in luxury
</p>
<p>and ease ; they are the Father Mahers, and the Bishop
</p>
<p>Trenches, the Cullens and the Plunketts. And these men
</p>
<p>preach poverty to the people. But we fear them not ;
</p>
<p>their power is fast fading away. We then have what is
</p>
<p>called the * aristocracy,' which means * robbery.' These
</p>
<p>are the favoured few, and they crush our country down
</p>
<p>and trample upon our children. A few of these indivi-
</p>
<p>duals hold the entire of our country and claim it as theirs.
</p>
<p>They claim the right of doing what they please with the
</p>
<p>people who dwell upon their estates  to turn them out or
</p>
<p>let them remain. And they are styled 'lordship,' and
</p>
<p>' worship,' and * highness,' and * his honour.' And these
</p>
<p>men are profligates and devils, a scourge and a curse to
</p>
<p>Ireland. But their day is coming to a close. Ere long
</p>
<p>the lands of Ireland will be divided amongst her honest
</p>
<p>toiling sons. From their grand mansions, where the
</p>
<p>villains live in luxury and profligacy, they preach subser-
</p>
<p>viency to Irishmen. They tell them to be content  have
</p>
<p>they not got mud houses to live in, pigs' food to live on,

</p>
<p>192 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>aristocracy and those rulers will be hunted from the face
</p>
<p>of Ireland. It is by force they hold what they have
</p>
<p>robbed, and by force it must and shall be regained
</p>
<p>from them. There is no other hope for you, men
</p>
<p>of Ireland. Upon Revolution  that great harbinger of
</p>
<p>liberty and hope of the oppressed  your cause depends.
</p>
<p>The men who murder and starve, and aid in starving our
</p>
<p>people, will call you cut-throats and assassins for being
</p>
<p>revolutionists. They know the insecurity of their tenure
</p>
<p>in this country just now, and they try to ridicule the cause
</p>
<p>and the men of Ireland. They call you a set of wild
</p>
<p>enthusiasts, who have got no proper way of living. You
</p>
<p>are socialists and everything but what you ought to be 
</p>
<p>good, loyal, craw-thumping, willing serfs of the wicked
</p>
<p>men who by their enactments have withered and deso-

</p>
<p>these men and their Queen may be summed up in a very
</p>
<p>few words. They have entered your land and taken it
</p>
<p>by force and fraud ; therefore they are robbers. You want

<p>to regain your birthright ; but you must not fight for it.

<p>You are Republicans ; do not acknowledge subjection to

<p>any one. You are preparing to be citizens of a free land.

<p>Thousands of your countrymen on the other side of the

<p>cause ; and they shall not be short of either money or

<p>subserviency. They arc Republicans. If you wish to be

<p>like these men and to live in your native country, you
</p>
<p>must win your independence. We command you 'to pre-
</p>
<p>pare for any emerijency. Let us prepare ourselves for
</p>
<p>the great day which is near at hand, when we shall be

<p>called upon to aid in the liberation of our country. Those

<p>wJio ma)f oppose iis^ wJicihcr clerics or laymen, will pass
</p>
<p>azuay ; and, if they be remembered, it will be with detes-
</p>
<p>tation. Those who oppose independence know not what
</p>
<p>they do. They are opening a door for their ruin. Let
</p>
<p>all who love Ireland offer up this prayer in their places of
</p>
<p>worship, instead of invoking- blessings for their alien
</p>
<p>government and its rulers :  * Praise be to thee, O, Lord,
</p>
<p>for the escape of our noble countryman, James Stephens ;
</p>
<p>glory and honour to Thy name. Protect under thy
</p>
<p>Almighty shield our countryman, Stephens ; guard him
</p>
<p>from the snares of our enemies. Grant him a speedy
</p>
<p>return to his native land under happy auspices. Pour
</p>
<p>down blessings upon our dear country. Grant her a
</p>
<p>speedy relief from the bondage of the oppressor. May
</p>
<p>our exiled countrymen, O Almighty Lord, soon return to
</p>
<p>the land of their nativity, and may the blessing of inde-
</p>
<p>l)cndence be soon enjoyed by our people.' "
</p>
<p>The rank and file of the I. R. B., it is clear, entertained
</p>
<p>no thought of failure. Up to the last Stephens continued
</p>
<p>to preach to his dupes that his system was impenetrable.
</p>
<p>And at the last, even when he was about to leave the
</p>
<p>country, he asserted that it was never so formidable. He

<p>was trusted by all, save the more intelligent of the three

<p>II. N
</p>
<p>1 94 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>George Grey in the House of Commons, Feb. 1 6th 1866)
</p>
<p>at large in the country. As we have already stated, his
</p>
<p>lieutenants heard their sentences pronounced almost with
</p>
<p>levity, so firmly did they confide in the speedy outbreak
</p>
<p>and complete success of the " Rising." Kelly, M'Cafferty,
</p>
<p>Halpin, O'Rorke, Bourke and others were not so sanguine.
</p>
<p>But let us see what Stephens himself said on these points,
</p>
<p>when speaking in America in 'GG. " All we wanted in
</p>
<p>Ireland, from the middle of September to the end of
</p>
<p>December, was arms to put into the hands of our men.
</p>
<p>The men were there, and only wanted the arms. But in
</p>
<p>the very hour of our strengtli'^' there came to Ireland the
</p>
<p>melancholy news of your disruption here. Still we held
</p>
<p>on. We did not think it possible that any body of men
</p>
<p>on this continent could be found that would withhold from
</p>
<p>Ireland, in that supreme hour of her need, the succours
</p>
<p>which they had promised to give us ; and it was because
</p>
<p>I could not bring myself to believe this that I made up
</p>
<p>my mind to get myself arrested, even if the English
</p>
<p>authorities had not succeeded in doing so ; for I felt
</p>
<p>myself bound to action last year, and I thought you
</p>
<p>would feel bound to it here, if I devoted myself so far as
</p>
<p>to accept a prison voluntarily, and that by going into
</p>
<p>prison you, on this side, would be driven to give us what
</p>
<p>we wanted. However, before the time I had decided for
</p>
<p>putting it in execution, I heard nothing favourable from
</p>
<p>this side, and the government found out my residence and
</p>
<p>I was arrested.
</p>
<p>* That is, after the seizure of The Irish People and the multitudinous
</p>
<p>arrests, Stephens calls this "the very liour of our strength." Impudence

<p>could hardly go further.

</p>
<p>" I suppose you would all like to know how I got out
</p>
<p>of prison. Well, it did not require any extraordinary
</p>
<p>effort on my part, for with the force of true hearts that
</p>
<p>were around that prison in Dublin, it would not have been
</p>
<p>possible for the Government, though the walls had been of
</p>
<p>adamant, and though it liad regiments stationed within
</p>
<p>these walls, to keep me there.
</p>
<p>" That ivas the time of our greatest power in Ireland, and if,
</p>
<p>at any time between the 24th of November and the end of
</p>
<p>December, you had sent to Ireland a small force, or only
</p>
<p>a few superior officers, with the necessary war material,
</p>
<p>I do believe, as firmly as in my own existence, that Ire-
</p>
<p>land would be an independent country to-day. But you
</p>
<p>know what took place. However, my mind was made up not
</p>
<p>to leave Ireland, and so I remained for nearly four months
</p>
<p>in Dublin city after my escape from prison. At length
</p>
<p>I had an invitation from Mr O'Mahony and others to come
</p>
<p>to this country, for the organisation, it was said, required
</p>
<p>my presence here. The evening after the reception of this
</p>
<p>invitation, I called some of my most trusted friends around
</p>
<p>me to hold a council to see, before we determined on
</p>
<p>starting for America, if something might not be done at
</p>
<p>home, even without your assistance. It was determined
</p>
<p>on that night, even without asking for my voice, to defer
</p>
<p>action yet awhile. It was then, and then only, that I de-
</p>
<p>termined on coming to the States."
</p>
<p>In another part of this speech he alludes to his
</p>
<p>lieutenants, as follow :  " The bearing of these prisoners
</p>
<p>has not been surpassed by the bearing of any men in

<p>history under similar circumstances." In the very next

</p>
<p>sentence, however, Mr Stephens does his best to destroy
</p>
<p>the heroic look of the " bearing " by giving a reason
</p>
<p>for it. "And they bore all this because they still had
</p>
<p>faith  faith in the organisation which they knew to be
</p>
<p>so powerful at home, and also faith that the promises
</p>
<p>so often made to them, and so solemnly made upon this
</p>
<p>side, would be kept."
</p>
<p>Mr Stephens is not a man whose unsup[)orted assertions
</p>
<p>we would care to accept anywhere else. Here, however,
</p>
<p>we see no reason to doubt him. Luby, Kickham, and
</p>
<p>the others posed themselves then, a la Emmet, knowing
</p>
<p>very well that no gibbet was prepared for them ; on the
</p>
<p>contrary, trusting that their prison gates would soon be
</p>
<p>broken. And O'Donovan Rossa took every opportunity
</p>
<p>of insulting his judges, because he supposed the thing
</p>
<p>was to be done with comparative impunity. A few
</p>
<p>weeks or months of imprisonment at the most was all
</p>
<p>these gentlemen expected. That over, they anticipated
</p>
<p>to reign as " heroes and martyrs " over the hearts of their
</p>
<p>countrymen. How much, or rather, how very little credit
</p>
<p>they merit for this bearing, which "was not surpassed by
</p>
<p>the bearing of any men in history, under similar circum-
</p>
<p>stances," we thank Mr Stephens for showing us. The said
</p>
<p>" bearing," in short, was neither more nor less than rank
</p>
<p>imposture.
</p>
<p>In the passage wc have quoted Stephens attributed the
</p>
<p>failure of the conspiracy to the break-up among the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can Fenians, which took place late in 1865. He forgot to
</p>
<p>state, what was the fact, as we have shown elsewhere, that

</p>
<p>this rupture was altogether his own work. He had pre-
</p>
<p>Immediate Consequences of the Arrests in '65. 197
</p>
<p>pared for it very carefully and skilfully ever since the pub-
</p>
<p>lication of the Chicago proceedings, two years earlier.
</p>
<p>And the news of the events in Ireland, in September,
</p>
<p>merely precipitated it.
</p>
<p>The rupture, as one of the prime consequences of the
</p>
<p>seizure of llie Irish People, and the subsequent arrests,
</p>
<p>we shall now describe.
</p>
<p>Intelligence of what had happened in Ireland reached
</p>
<p>America by mail a fortnight afterwards. It caused intense
</p>
<p>excitement in all, consternation in some, and fierce anger
</p>
<p>in many. One set of l^Y*nian sympathisers, however, were
</p>
<p>not at all displeased. They were the American politicians,
</p>
<p>who had found Fenianism exceedingly useful so far, and
</p>
<p>who immediately saw how it might be made still more
</p>
<p>useful. These gentlemen got hold of their tools among
</p>
<p>the leaders of the conspiracy and gave them fitting instruc-
</p>
<p>tions. As these instructions coincided with the wishes of
</p>
<p>the tools, and with the wishes also of the great majority of
</p>
<p>the Brotherhood in America, it was easy to carry them
</p>
<p>out. The Head Centre, who looked exclusively to action
</p>
<p>in Ireland, and who would not listen to projects of assault
</p>
<p>on the l^ritish provinces in America, was to be deposed or
</p>
<p>intimidated into acquiescence with the policy which the
</p>
<p>rulers of the United States would dictate, and that policy
</p>
<p>was to be carried out while the passions excited by the
</p>
<p>civil war were yet fierce. Nobody of sense among the
</p>
<p>rulers of the States expected that the Fenians would
</p>
<p>achieve any success in America. But they would be
</p>
<p>menacing to England and very annoying, therefore a

<p>198 The Fenian Conspii'acy.
</p>
<p>A general Convention of the Brotherhood was summoned
</p>
<p>to assemble on the i6th of October 1865 in Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>It was numerously attended. The delegates to a man
</p>
<p>were as hot-headed as the coolest of poh'ticians could de-
</p>
<p>sire. Action was the desire of every heart, and the cry
</p>
<p>for "action " was on every lip. John O'Mahony opened
</p>
<p>the proceedings with the following speech : 
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen and Brothers, the third paragraph of the
</p>
<p>fifth section of the bye-laws of the Fenian Brotherhood, as
</p>
<p>amended at Cincinnati in January 1865 consists of the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing proviso :  * The Central Council shall have power
</p>
<p>to call a Convention of State Centres, or a General Con-
</p>
<p>gress, whenever they may deem it necessary, for the transac-
</p>
<p>tions of extraordinary business ; such Convention of State
</p>
<p>Centres, or such General Congress, shall have the power of
</p>
<p>'impeaching and removing any officer in the organisation.' In
</p>
<p>accordance with this clause the following resolution was pro-
</p>
<p>posed at a session of the Central Council, held in the city of
</p>
<p>New York', on the 3(1 day of the present month (October), on
</p>
<p>motion of Mr Bamiion, and seconded by Mr Doody : 
</p>
<p>* That this council call a convention, to meet at Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia, on Monday, October i6th, 1865, at nine o'clock, A.M.,
</p>
<p>delegates to be sent as laid down in the constitution, and
</p>
<p>the expenses of State Centres to be paid by the general
</p>
<p>organisation ; and all credentials to be endorsed and
</p>
<p>approved by the respective State Centres at Philadelphia.'
</p>
<p>Whereupon was based the call which I shall proceed to
</p>
<p>read to you, and which has been issued by the President
</p>
<p>of your Central Council, with my approval as your Head

</p>
<p>"It is true that I saw several objections to its issue at
</p>
<p>the present moment. I tliought it calculated to interrupt
</p>
<p>the more important business of the organisation, and
</p>
<p>cause a state of inactivity and suspense throughout our
</p>
<p>circles, at a time when all their energy ought to be
</p>
<p>directed to other objects. The notice also I considered
</p>
<p>too short for the attainment of a full representation of the
</p>
<p>Ikotherhood ; besides this, I held it to be bad strategy to
</p>
<p>show any ap[)carance of a desire to change our front in
</p>
<p>the face of the recent aggressive movement of our enemy.
</p>
<p>I assented to it for two reasons  for the sake of harmony
</p>
<p>in the Hrst place, choosing the lesser of two evils ; in the
</p>
<p>next, because I am resolved never to shrink from meeting
</p>
<p>my constituents, however summoned together, and render-
</p>
<p>ing to them an account of my stewardship of their affairs.
</p>
<p>An event that has occurred since the promulgation of the
</p>
<p>call, has reconciled me to it namely, the arrival of an
</p>
<p>accredited envoy from the Irish Republic, with an import-
</p>
<p>ant and cheering communication to myself and to you.
</p>
<p>This I shall read when you are regularly organised in
</p>
<p>session. The call reads thus  (a mere form not necessary
</p>
<p>to insert).
</p>
<p>" The objects of the Congress I can understand to be,
</p>
<p>in the first place, the creation of financial and military
</p>
<p>bureaus adequate to the increased development of the
</p>
<p>Fenian Brotherhood, and the political crisis wherein it is
</p>
<p>now placed ; and, in the second place, the granting of
</p>
<p>more unrestricted powers to your Central Council than
</p>
<p>what are vested in that body at present

</p>
<p>" The good which, in my opinion, may result from this
</p>
<p>200 The Fenian Co7ispiracy.
</p>
<p>Congress, consists in the increased ^<"/<7/ wliicli it will give to
</p>
<p>the issue of our bonds, specimens of which will be presented
</p>
<p>to you for your inspection, before you adjourn. The address
</p>
<p>from the Irish Republic, which has for some time been in
</p>
<p>my keeping awaiting completion, may also be more
</p>
<p>authoritatively endorsed and approved at a General
</p>
<p>Congress than it could be at a session of the Central
</p>
<p>Council. The General Congress reigns supreme over all
</p>
<p>branches and departments of the Fenian Brotherhood in
</p>
<p>America.
</p>
<p>"The chiefest and best result that can accrue from
</p>
<p>your meeting is the authoritative and unmistakable
</p>
<p>promulgation of the assurance that the most complete
</p>
<p>concord exists between your Head Centre and the
</p>
<p>C. O. I. R. You will learn from the envoy of the I. R.,
</p>
<p>that, through your Head Centre alone can any authentic
</p>
<p>communication reach you from your allies in Ireland,
</p>
<p>that no action taken by any party in the United States,
</p>
<p>without his sanction, will be recognised by the authorities
</p>
<p>of the Irish Republic  that he alone is entitled to speak
</p>
<p>as its representative here. You will learn that all parties
</p>
<p>who pretend to be in direct communication with the Cen-
</p>
<p>tral Executive, through channels independent of your
</p>
<p>Head Centre, are impostors and sowers of discord in your
</p>
<p>ranks. The spirit of the following paragraph of the six-
</p>
<p>teenth section of your bye-laws, is strictly adhered to by
</p>
<p>our friends on the other side of the Atlantic :

</p>
<p>business can be received in the United States, except
</p>
<p>through the Head Centre. Any member or officer dero-
</p>
<p>gating from this law shall be condemned as a traitor.'
</p>
<p>" This, gentlemen, will, I trust, be effectually disposed
</p>
<p>of at the present Congress, so that no man will henceforth
</p>
<p>have the opportunity to assert that he represents ' the
</p>
<p>men in Ireland,' without subjecting himself to the well-
</p>
<p>merited charge of being a false pretender. That delusion,
</p>
<p>if any have been led astray by it, must be disregarded
</p>
<p>henceforth and for ever. It has already been the mother
</p>
<p>of numerous evils to the Organisation, at home and
</p>
<p>abroad.
</p>
<p>" Though this is a special Congress, and though but
</p>
<p>little time was given to the officials at head quarters
</p>
<p>to i)rcpare documents, still 1 am in a position to inform
</p>
<p>you that full and minute reports will be laid before
</p>
<p>you of all that concerns the progress, the numerical in-
</p>
<p>crease or diminution, the financial receipts, and the ex-
</p>
<p>penditure in America since your last Congress, together
</p>
<p>with our remittances to our allies in another place. No
</p>
<p>items will be found unexplained, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>short and sudden notification given us. I call your special
</p>
<p>attention to the accurate and creditable reports which
</p>
<p>have been furnished by the Central Secretaries for your
</p>
<p>information and satisfaction. The most prejudiced minds
</p>
<p>must pronounce them unexceptionable, all circumstances
</p>
<p>considered.

<p>in which they have discharged their intricate and laborious

</p>
<p>duties. The Central Treasurer also will be found to have
</p>
<p>deserved the marked gratitude of the Congress, and of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood at large, for his zealous, honest, and diligent
</p>
<p>attention to the duties of his position.
</p>
<p>" Your Central Council has held four sessions since
</p>
<p>January last. As this body will present you with its own
</p>
<p>reports, and as the minutes of all its proceedings will be
</p>
<p>subjected to your examination, I shall confine myself here
</p>
<p>to returning its members my thanks for the diligence and
</p>
<p>promptitude wherewith they have at all times responded to
</p>
<p>the summons of the Head Centre, and for the scrutinising
</p>
<p>exactitude wherewith they have scanned and canvassed
</p>
<p>every act of your executive corps. Under the supervision
</p>
<p>of such watchful guardians, it was all but impossible that
</p>
<p>your financial affairs could be mismanaged or your money
</p>
<p>misused.
</p>
<p>"You will find by our reports that the Fenian circles
</p>
<p>in the United States have been multiplied more than
</p>
<p>once and a half during the last eight months ; that the
</p>
<p>number of individual members in good standing has
</p>
<p>increased fourfold ; and the weekly receipts at Head
</p>
<p>Quarters more than fiftyfold. The call for increased
</p>
<p>donations recently made upon our circles has been pretty
</p>
<p>generally and liberally responded to thus far.
</p>
<p>" In fine, the organisation is in a flourishing and growing
</p>
<p>condition ; its influence and its workings are at present
</p>
<p>making themselves felt over half the globe ; our enemies
</p>
<p>are beginning to acknowledge its power by the persecution

</p>
<p>Immediate Consequences of the Arr.sts in '65. 20
</p>
<p>.>
</p>
<p>"The effects of the late hostile movement of the British
</p>
<p>Government ai^^ainst Fenianism, or so-called Fenianism,
</p>
<p>in the dominions of Queen Victoria, have had excellent
</p>
<p>results in these States. It has convinced the doubters
</p>
<p>and the despondent that there is still some hope for
</p>
<p>Irishmen in Ireland, and that ours is no sham, but a
</p>
<p>real bona fide working and live organisation. Already
</p>
<p>it has gained as many adherents among those classes
</p>
<p>in Ireland also. The present persecution has so far
</p>
<p>tended to intensify the zeal of our allies and friends.
</p>
<p>The mission from the Central Executive, which I have re-
</p>
<p>ceived by the envoy here present, will convince you of
</p>
<p>this fact. It may be true that a few of our more advanced
</p>
<p>skirmishers have fallen into the enemies' hands, among other
</p>
<p>* suspects,' but it is also true that our line of battle still re-
</p>
<p>mains imbroken, and that its onward march is unchecked.
</p>
<p>"With respect to the arrests of our friends made by the
</p>
<p>myrmidons of ICnglish tyranny, I must say that a great
</p>
<p>portion of the blame thereof rests upon the shoulders
</p>
<p>of some of our American Fenians. In their zeal to gain
</p>
<p>adherents to our cause, many of our propagandists disclose
</p>
<p>facts that are calculated to put the British bloodhound
</p>
<p>upon the track of our patriot brothers at home. This
</p>
<p>thing must be put an end to henceforth and for ever.
</p>
<p>Any man found disclosing special facts or particulars re-
</p>
<p>specting the Home Organisation should be at once and
</p>
<p>ignominiously expelled from our body ; the man who is
</p>
<p>not convinced by this time that a great and extensive
</p>
<p>organisation exists within the British dominions is not

<p>worth taking further trouble with.
</p>
<p>204 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>"There is one consoling fact, however, connected with
</p>
<p>the disclosures made by certain parties in their blatant and
</p>
<p>bombastic harangues. There is so much which is unreal
</p>
<p>and unfounded,  so much of the nonsensical claptrap
</p>
<p>mixed up so closely with a few grains of truth in their
</p>
<p>discourses,  that it will tax all the ingenuity of the British
</p>
<p>lawyers to sift the corn from the chaff
</p>
<p>" Now with respect to the exaggerated and inflated
</p>
<p>assertions to which I allude, I must here state, for the
</p>
<p>hundredth time, that I never countenanced one of them.
</p>
<p>Neither in public nor in private have 1 ever to my know-
</p>
<p>ledge given sanction to one single false statement con-
</p>
<p>nected with our organisation. Whatever my other short-
</p>
<p>comings may be, no one can truthfully charge me with
</p>
<p>having deceived him byword or deed. From the remarks
</p>
<p>just made you will understand that our progress has been
</p>
<p>immense and unprecedented during the time that has
</p>
<p>passed since we last met in congress.
</p>
<p>"As happened during the period immediately preceding
</p>
<p>our session in January last, when we lost General Corcoran
</p>
<p>and so many other tried and trusted supports of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, so within the interval between January
</p>
<p>and now, we have lost Henry O'C. McCarthy, the President
</p>
<p>of our Central Council, one of the ablest and most
</p>
<p>energetic of our civilian brothers. Oin* military corps
</p>
<p>has been deprived of General Thomas A. Snu'th, our

<p>greatest loss since the fall of the gallant Corcoran and

</p>
<p>inferior to either in soundness of judgment and hiilitary

</p>
<p>chiefs fell nobly before Richmond in defence of the
</p>
<p>integrity of their adopted country. What a power these
</p>
<p>three men  Corcoran, Smith, and Murphy  would be to
</p>
<p>us now ! How sadly we miss them from our ranks !
</p>
<p>How proud would they be to witness our high position to-
</p>
<p>day, after the long and toilsome struggle during which
</p>
<p>they helped us to bring the Brotherhood through its early
</p>
<p>difficulties ! All miss them, but I deplore their fall with
</p>
<p>more than a brother's grief.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen and Brothers, before proceeding to the
</p>
<p>business of appointing committees or permanent officers
</p>
<p>for this Congress, and for examining the credentials of the
</p>
<p>delegates that are to compose it, allow me to impress
</p>
<p>upon you the awful responsibility you are about to incur.
</p>
<p>This will be a far more important Fenian assemblage
</p>
<p>than any you have yet attended. In your hands will rest
</p>
<p>the salvation or destruction of the Fenian ]5rotherhood,
</p>
<p>and with it the cause of Ireland's regeneration; for, out-
</p>
<p>side of the Fenian Brotherhood and its allies there is no
</p>
<p>hope of Ireland's future. Be courteous and urbane in your
</p>
<p>relations to one another. However warmly you may feel
</p>
<p>upon points in dispute between you, learn to deny your-
</p>
<p>selves, to curb the warmth of your passions, and to bear
</p>
<p>with even contumely for your country's sake. Beware
</p>
<p>of " finality" assertions. Name no hour nor place for a
</p>
<p>rising of your countrymen, but lose not a day in doing all
</p>
<p>in your power to ],)ut them in readiness for it. Remember
</p>
<p>always our Fenian maxim, as adopted at Chicago, in I<S63,

</p>
<p>O'Mahony having concluded his speech  one remark-
</p>
<p>ably suggestive in every respect the remainder of the
</p>
<p>sitting was devoted to settling points of order. Another
</p>
<p>day was given to the verification of credentials ; on the
</p>
<p>third the real business of the Congress began. The most
</p>
<p>important portion of this business was the adoption of a
</p>
<p>New Constitution for the Brotherhood. It was intended
</p>
<p>to withdraw all power from O'Mahony and his adherents
</p>
<p>and to bestow it on the Men of Action, who, for the present
</p>
<p>at least, were ardent admirers of James Stephens. Accord-
</p>
<p>ingly O'Mahony opposed its adoption with all his energy,
</p>
<p>but ineffectually ; it was carried by the vote of a large
</p>
<p>majority of the Congress. This constitution was formed
</p>
<p>of four articles. The first of these articles re-affumed
</p>
<p>matters respecting the general organisation already in
</p>
<p>practice. The second article made an important change
</p>
<p>in the government of the Brotherhood. We must, there-
</p>
<p>fore, quote it at length : 
</p>
<p>" Sec. I. All legislative powers herein granted shall be
</p>
<p>vested in a Congress of the Fenian Brotherhood of the
</p>
<p>United States and other portions of America, which shall
</p>
<p>consist of a Senate and a Representative body.
</p>
<p>" Sect. 2. The Representatives shall be delegates chosen
</p>
<p>every year by the Ih'otherhood in good standing of the
</p>
<p>several States and Districts which may be included within
</p>
<p>the Union and other portions of America, according to their
</p>
<p>respective number of circles, each circle being entitled to one
</p>
<p>delegate for every hundred members more or less, but not
</p>
<p>less than ten, and one additional delegate for a fractional

</p>
<p>Sees. 4-6 made arrangements for the election of
</p>
<p>officers and the conduct of business of no general interest.
</p>
<p>The remaining sections (7-13) conferred various powers
</p>
<p>on the Senate : J Is president was to be ex officio vice-presi-
</p>
<p>dent of the V. 11, and was to take the place of the president
</p>
<p>of the Jhotherhood, in case of his " death, impeachment,
</p>
<p>inabihty to act, or removal ; " it was to have the power of
</p>
<p>impeaching any officer whatever ; sentence was to be
</p>
<p>awarded by a vote of two-thirds of its number, and was to
</p>
<p>be ' final and at its discretion ; ' it was to sit in perpetual
</p>
<p>session ; it was to fix all salaries and originate all proposi-
</p>
<p>tions for raising money ; it had the power of carrying any
</p>
<p>measure against the president of the I. R. B. by a vote of
</p>
<p>tw^o-thirds ; none of its members w^as to be a salaried
</p>
<p>official ; and no appropriation of money was to be made
</p>
<p>save by its vote.
</p>
<p>The third article of the new constitution made an im-
</p>
<p>portant aUerati(Hi in the position and powers of the
</p>
<p>head of the Jhotherhood. His title, too, was altered from
</p>
<p>Head Centre to President. He was to be elected yearly
</p>
<p>by a general Congress of the Senate and House of Dele-
</p>
<p>gates ; his stipend was to be fixed at his election for his
</p>
<p>term of office ; and, on entering on his duties, he was to

<p>take the following oath :  " I do solemnly swear (or aflirni)

</p>
<p>case the president failed to nominate to any vacancy with-
</p>
<p>in a reasonable time, had the power of making- such nomi-

</p>
<p>making treaties and sending envoys, with the consent of
</p>
<p>the Senate. He might summon a Congress on extraordi-

<p>nary occasions ; he was to receive envoys ; and generally
</p>
<p>to administer the affairs of the F. B.

<p>in existence. Finally, the new constitution designated
</p>
<p>the mode of appointing, and defined the powers of the
</p>
<p>principal officers, besides the president. These officers
</p>
<p>were, the secretary of the treasury, the treasurer, the cor-
</p>
<p>responding secretary, the subscription agent, who looked
</p>
<p>after the bonds of the Irish Republic, and the agent of the
</p>
<p>Irish Republic who was to sign these bonds, and generally
</p>
<p>to manage finances in relation to Ireland.
</p>
<p>O'Mahony was still sufficiently influential to be elected
</p>
<p>president. His vice-president, however, was " Colonel "
</p>
<p>W. R. Roberts, the Boweiy store-keeper ; and his war
</p>
<p>secretary was a certain " General " Sweeny, who held the
</p>
<p>rank of major in the army of the United States. Both
</p>
<p>these men were strongly adverse to O'Mahony and his
</p>
<p>poHcy. So also were most of the senators, prominent
</p>
<p>among whom were Meany, Median, and Dunne.
</p>
<p>Having adopted their new Constitution, the Philadelphia
</p>
<p>Congress discussed the despatches from Ireland. These
</p>
<p>were glowing in* the extreme, painting all things coulciir du
</p>

</p>
<p>money. These despatches were greeted with vehement
</p>
<p>applause ; Ste[)hens's poHcy was unanimously accepted ;
</p>
<p>and all that he asked was i^ranted. Among his requests
</p>
<p>was one for the release of John Mitchell, who was then in
</p>
<p>prison for his share in the war of Secession. Stephens
</p>
<p>wanted a trustworthy financial agent in Europe ; and he
</p>
<p>fixed upon perhaps the only man in whom the F. B.
</p>
<p>and the I. R. 11 had implicit reliance. A deputation to
</p>
<p>the President of the United States soon procured the
</p>
<p>release of Mitchell ; it was one of the most significant cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances of the day, and filled the F. Ix with vast hopes
</p>
<p>of further and more substantial aid from the same quarter.
</p>
<p>Remembering how Mitchell dealt with Stephens in 1858,
</p>
<p>when the latter Avorthy attempted to persuade him
</p>
<p>(Mitchell) to join his conspiracy, our readers, no doubt,
</p>
<p>will be curious to learn how it was that this not very con-
</p>
<p>sistent patriot was eventually induced to take part
</p>
<p>therein. Such reasons for this course as Mitchell could
</p>
<p>give, he stated at length in a letter to John Martin, penned
</p>
<p>in 1868: "Just after the close of the successful war
</p>
<p>waged against the Confederate States, it was quite natural
</p>
<p>that in the flushed intoxication of triumph, and with many
</p>
<p>thousands of Irish soldiers and officers trained in camp,
</p>
<p>and eager to use their weapons and their skill against their
</p>
<p>hereditary foe  it was very natural, I say, that an immense
</p>
<p>iml:)etus should be given to the Fenian organisation, and
</p>
<p>that, under the exciting appeals of certain leaders, our
</p>
<p>highly impressionable people should be worked up to the
</p>
<p>point of resolving upon instant battle. There was also, at
</p>
<p>the same time, an apparently well-grounded expectation

<p>II. O
</p>
<p>2 1 o TJic ]'\nian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>lliat the United States having- subdued the Confederacy,
</p>
<p>^\'ould take an early opportunity of requiting to Engkmd
</p>
<p>the humiliating affair of Mason and Slidell, and the ravages
</p>
<p>committed on American commerce by cruisers built and
</p>
<p>fitted out in I^ritish ports, llie moment was exciting ;
</p>
<p>and many who up to that time held aloof from these
</p>
<p>organisations joined them. I, myself, was one of these ;
</p>
<p>but when the break-up occurred here, and when I could no
</p>
<p>longer tell to which 'Wing' I belonged, I quietly with-
</p>
<p>drew myself from both. Many excellent Irishmen in the
</p>
<p>United States acted as I did."
</p>
<p>Mitchell's reason for becoming a I'enian, it will be seen,
</p>
<p>was a purely Irish reason ; the high excitement of the
</p>
<p>l)eriod seized him, and lie could not resist the impulse it
</p>
<p>impressed. His better sense, however, (luickened by the
</p>
<p>" break-up," soon acquired the supremacy over his mind,
</p>
<p>and he quitted the V. 11 As he remarks, many others did
</p>
<p>precisely the same.
</p>
<p>Joining the Brotherhood, Mitchell consented to become
</p>
<p>its agent in Paris, for which city he departed at once, and
</p>
<p>for some months no man was busier in promoting the
</p>
<p>conspiracy than himself.
</p>
<p>The rhiladelphia Congress dissolved after a few days of
</p>
<p>session, and the Irish envoy returned to the Chief LLxecu-
</p>
<p>tive of the I. R. 11, delighted with what had j^assed. Within
</p>
<p>a month of his departure  that is, about the time of the
</p>
<p>arrest of Stephens  an event as yet unknown in America
</p>
<p> O'Mahony received another despatch from Ireland,
</p>
<p>apprising him that the Rising was fixed for the last week

<p>in December. O'Mahony at once summoned his cabinet,
</p>
<p>Iniincdiate Consequences of the Arrests in '65. 211
</p>
<p>showed tlicm liow cfrcimislaiiccs slood, and urged the issue
</p>
<p>of the bonds at once. The Senators refused to entertain
</p>
<p>the proposition, chiefly because they had embraced other
</p>
<p>])rojects than those advocated l>y O'Maliony. lie wanted
</p>
<p>fighting to be confuied to Ireland ; they intended to begin
</p>
<p>on tlieir own continent by an invasion of Canada, to which,
</p>
<p>as they asserted, they had obtained the approval of Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Johnson and Mr Secretary Seward. So time went
</p>
<p>on for a few weeks, nothing whatever being done in
</p>
<p>America. At length came the news of the capture of
</p>
<p>Stephens. And hard in its track came communication.s
</p>
<p>from Millen and Kelly, announcing that in spite of the
</p>
<p>arrest, the insurrection was still to take place. It was
</p>
<p>added that Kelly had apian foi'the rescue of the C. 0. 1. R.
</p>
<p>'i'hese despatches w^ere carried by Corydon, then one of
</p>
<p>the trustiest agents of the conspirators.
</p>
<p>O'Mahony now resolved to act without the concurrence
</p>
<p>of his Scnalois and issue his bonds. 'J'hese bonds were
</p>
<p>elaborately engraved, after the manner of bank notes,
</p>
<p>with various Irish devices, and bore the following inscrip-
</p>
<p>tion :  " It is hereby certified that the Irish Republic is
</p>
<p>indebted to , or bearer, in the sum of dollars,
</p>
<p>redeemable in six months after the acknowledgment of the
</p>
<p>independence of the Irish nation, with interest from the
</p>
<p>date hereof inclusive, at six per cent, per annum, payable
</p>
<p>on presentation of this bond at the Treasury of the Irish
</p>
<p>Ivepublic." These bonds were for various amounts. Some
</p>
<p>of them were as low as five dollars ; others w^ere for a
</p>
<p>lumdred or more.

</p>
<p>No sooner had O'Mahony acted thus decisively than
</p>
<p>2 12 TJic Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>Ills Senators assembled and vetoed the act, summonlnc^
</p>
<p>the President himself to appear before them, and justif)'
</p>
<p>his conduct if he could. O'Mahony met this high-handed
</p>
<p>proceeding with another quite as high-handed. He pro-
</p>
<p>claimed the Senators factious and corrupt, and excluded
</p>
<p>them from I lead-quarters. Then came the deed on the
</p>
<p>part of the Senators, which fixed the schism. They de-
</p>
<p>posed O'Mahony from the presidency, and elected VV. ]v.
</p>
<p>Roberts in his place.
</p>
<p>The very curious secret liistory of the rupture, which we
</p>
<p>have thus shortly summarisetl, we must borrow from
</p>
<p>The IrisJi-Amcrican, the journal conducted by Mr P. J.
</p>
<p>Median :  "At the Congress of the Fenian Jirotherhood,
</p>
<p>held at Cincinnati, in January, it was found that the
</p>
<p>organisation had so far outgrown its original proportions,
</p>
<p>that some sort of representative government was neces-
</p>
<p>sary for its direction, in place of the ' one man power,' under
</p>
<p>which its years of minority had been prolonged until
</p>
<p>they threatened to end only ^\ith the existence of the
</p>
<p>]5rotherliood, as an available agent in the work of Ire-
</p>
<p>land's liberation. Up to that lime the control of the
</p>
<p>affairs of the ]hotherhood had been in the hands of the
</p>
<p>Head Centre, Colonel John O'Mahony; but, as the
</p>
<p>progress of the body under his management did not
</p>
<p>appear to be equivalent to the efforts expended in its pro-
</p>
<p>pagation, it was determined to atld to its government a
</p>
<p>Council composed of representative men from different
</p>
<p>portions of the Union. This Council numbered ten
</p>
<p>members, and, as events proved, was well designed ; but,

</p>
<p>tlic test of tliosc collisions which arc inevitable in every
</p>
<p>body which undertakes to represent the interests and the
</p>
<p>wishes of large masses of men. At the very outset of its
</p>
<p>career it was found that the policy of Colonel O'Mahony
</p>
<p>and that of the Central Council were diametrically oppo-
</p>
<p>site on the very fnst (j[uestions which came before them for
</p>
<p>discussion  those questions, singularly enough, generally
</p>
<p>turning on the appointment to positions of trust and
</p>
<p>emolument of the personal friends and adherents of
</p>
<p>Colonel O'Mahony.* The moderation of I he members
</p>
<p>of the Council, however, prevented any ru[)turc in the
</p>
<p>earlier conferences ; but the issue though avoided was
</p>
<p>only postponed.
</p>
<p>The ideas of Colonel O'Mahony were soon found
</p>
<p>to be entirely behind those of the party with whom
</p>
<p>lie professed to labour for the accomplishment of the
</p>
<p>Irish Revolution ; his colleagues were too far in ad-
</p>
<p>vance of him ; and rather than be compelled to yield to
</p>
<p>the demands of the Council, he asserted the sui:)eriority
</p>
<p>which his nominal position gave him, declared that the
</p>
<p>Cincinnati Congress had only constituted the Council as
</p>
<p>an advisory commillce, whose suggestions he might
</p>
<p>accept oi" reject, as he saw fit; and referred the differences
</p>
<p>between himself and the Central Council to the decision

<p>of the Brotherhood at large. This issue was accepted by

<p>the Council.

</p>
<p>Avas held at Philadelphia, and, after nine days' close
</p>
<p>deliberation, decided emphatically in favour of the more
</p>
<p>advanced views of the Council. Recognisinc^ the evils
</p>
<p>that had flowed from the arbitrary exercise of the
</p>
<p>powers supposed to be vested in the Head Centre, the
</p>
<p>Congress adopted a constitution, placing that officer on
</p>
<p>nearly the same footing as the President of the United
</p>
<p>States, and creating a Senate, to whose ratification
</p>
<p>all appointments should be sul^mittcd, and with whom all
</p>
<p>appropriations of money for the purposes of the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood, should originate. This Senate, furthermore, was
</p>
<p>empowered to pass any ordinance, even over the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's veto, by a vote of two-thirds of its members ; and
</p>
<p>its decision, in all cases of appeal or impeachment, was
</p>
<p>declared final and binding on all members of the organi-
</p>
<p>sation. And, as if to stamp the approval of the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood on the conduct and policy of the Central Council,
</p>
<p>all the members of the Council, with three exceptions
</p>
<p>(one of these exceptions being the personal friend of the
</p>
<p>Head Centre), were elected members of the new Senate,
</p>
<p>which, to render it still more indei)endent, was declared
</p>
<p>by the constitution to be a perpetual session.
</p>
<p>" The very first session of the Senate developed the fact
</p>
<p>that the provisions of the new Constitution were not
</p>
<p>favourably regarded by Mr O'Mahony and his part}-,,
</p>
<p>which includes most of the men who, directly or indirectly,
</p>
<p>have been deriving pecuniary advantages from the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of the Brotherhood. The initiatory move of what
</p>
<p>we may call this administration party was an attempt to

<p>divide and distract the Senate. The first nominations
</p>
<p>Immediate Consequenees of the Arrests in '65. 215
</p>
<p>submitted by Mr O'Mahony for the position of heads of
</p>
<p>bureaux were those of the only three members of the
</p>
<p>Senate who were regarded as doubtful on the question of
</p>
<p>carryinc^ out the pohcy of the old Central Council, and
</p>
<p>pushiiii^ the proi^ramme of the Ih'otherhood to the trial of
</p>
<p>battle as ra[)idly as possible. The nominations were re-
</p>
<p>jected, ^lrstl}^ because the majority of the senators believed
</p>
<p>that it was contrary to the intent of their election that the
</p>
<p>represcntatix c character of their body should be destroyed,
</p>
<p>by the appointment of its members to the administrative
</p>
<p>offices ; and, secondly, because they saw through the
</p>
<p>attempt to sow discord among them by exciting the cupid-
</p>
<p>ity of individuals.
</p>
<p>Other nominations of a similar character followed,
</p>
<p>the nominees in most cases being men who had drawn
</p>
<p>largely on the funds of the Brotherhood, while returning
</p>
<p>little or no benefit thereto. In one instance Mr
</p>
<p>( )'Mahony went the length of nominating, for the head
</p>
<p>of one of the most important bureaux, a personal
</p>
<p>friend of his own, who not only was not a member of
</p>
<p>the I'VMn'an Ihotherhooil, but who a few days previously,
</p>
<p>in conversation with the eminent officer who holds the
</p>
<p>position of Secretary of War (Sweeny), had repudiated
</p>
<p>the idea that there was anything feasible in the plans or
</p>
<p>aspirations of the organisation.
</p>
<p>" Of course the Senate could not ratify such appoint-
</p>
<p>ments ; and after confirming two heads of departments  
</p>
<p>an agent for the Irish Republic, and a few minor officials
</p>
<p> the body was compelled to adjourn, most of the mem-

</p>
<p>to the afifairs of the Brotherhood at a considerable personal
</p>
<p>sacrifice ; while Mr O'Mahony, in the enjoyment of his
</p>
<p>salary of 2000 dollars a year, could well afford to play the
</p>
<p>waiting- game and tire out the unremunerated senators.
</p>
<p>" The regular meeting of the Senate was fixed for the
</p>
<p>1st of January 1 866, but by a special resolution passed
</p>
<p>(nine out of the fifteen senators being present), the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent of the Senate was authorised to call the body to-
</p>
<p>gether whenever, in his judgment, he might deem their
</p>
<p>reassembling necessary.
</p>
<p>"Scarcely had the Senate adjourned, than Mr O'Mahony
</p>
<p>placed his rejected adherents in the offices for which the
</p>
<p>members of that body had refused to confirm them. He
</p>
<p>liad already refused to place the moneys of the F. B.,
</p>
<p>received subsequent to the Philadelphia Congress, in the
</p>
<p>hands of the Treasurer of the Organisation, Mr O'Rourke,
</p>
<p>who only held that office until his successor should be
</p>
<p>appointed and confirmed. With those moneys the man-
</p>
<p>sion in Union Square, which has excited so much com-
</p>
<p>ment, was hired, as we understand, in the name of Mr
</p>
<p>]5ernard Doran Killian, Mr O'Mahony's nominee for Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the 'J'reasury. A sum of jS.ooo dollars was paid
</p>
<p>down in advance for eighteen months' rent of this brown
</p>
<p>stone palace, notwithstanding that no appropriation of
</p>
<p>such sum had been made by the Senate, with which body
</p>
<p>the Constitution declares all appropriations shall origi-
</p>
<p>nate. The sum of 5000 dollars more was deposited with
</p>
<p>a company in Wall Street  again in the name of Mr 15.

</p>
<p>several thousands was expended in furnishin^^ the house,
</p>
<p>tlie interior fittings of the business department oddly
</p>
<p>cnoui^h being- composed of a lot of second-hand desks,
</p>
<p>while the private apartments were sumptuously garnished
</p>
<p>with new bronz chandeliers, ricli Brussels carpets, hand-
</p>
<p>some sofas and easy chairs in walnut-wood and broca-
</p>
<p>tellc ; while tables and secretaires to suit filled up the
</p>
<p>elegant complement. Sleeping rooms on a scale of simi-
</p>
<p>lar magnificence were furnished for the * ruling powers;*
</p>
<p>iind tlie cost of the whole cannot have swallowed up much
</p>
<p>less than 30,000 dollars of the money subscribed by the
</p>
<p>hard-working members of the Brotherhood for a very
</p>
<p><.lifferent purpose.
</p>
<p>One item of the expense is worth noticing. The
</p>
<p>t;as-fittings of the house are of a costly description,
</p>
<p>and the job of putting them in (which in the language
</p>
<p>of the ring would be termed a fat one) was given to
</p>
<p>a prominent leader of the American Protestant Associa-
</p>
<p>tion  that natural heir and offspring of Irish Orange-
</p>
<p>men to which body this patriotic gas-fitter is also un-
</p>
<p>dersto(3d to be affiliated. Probably the fact that Mr
</p>
<p>O'Mahony's right hand man, who has been most profuse
</p>
<p>in abuse of the members of the Senate, is a resident in
</p>
<p>the family of this A. P. A. Orange gas-fitter, may account
</p>
<p>for the fdling into his dish of this rich morccau, as it may
</p>
<p>also account for the circumstance that Ogle Iv. Gowan,
</p>
<p>the Grand Master of the Canadian Orangemen, seems to
</p>
<p>be better posted in the doings in Union Square than most
</p>
<p>of the Centres in the United States.

<p>2 1 8 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>exciting news received almost daily, naturally made the
</p>
<p>members of the Senate desirous to convene for the purpose
</p>
<p>of enquirini^- into the manaf^cment of affairs, and accord-
</p>
<p>ini^ly a memorial from six of the Senate was served on the
</p>
<p>president of that body, asking him U) summon that bod}v
</p>
<p>pursuant to the adjournment of Nov. 7th, to meet in New
</p>
<p>York as quickly as the more remote senators could come
</p>
<p>on. The call was accordingly issued, and in obedience to
</p>
<p>it a majority of the members appeared in New York on
</p>
<p>the 4th instant. It proceeded at once to business in spite
</p>
<p>of the formal protest of one of its members, S. J. Mean)-.
</p>
<p>In explanation of his conduct it is stated by Meehan that
</p>
<p>Meany was devoted to O'Mahon}^ that he was then
</p>
<p>drawing "a handsome sum from head-quarters under the
</p>
<p>title of ex[)enses," and that he was smarting under the
</p>
<p>sense of recent disappointment, his nomination for the
</p>
<p>control of a bureau having been rejected by the Senate.
</p>
<p>The latter, we may add, soon afterwards repaid this act of
</p>
<p>Meany by " impeaching him for conduct derogatory to
</p>
<p>the Senatorial office."
</p>
<p>" The first act of the Senators thus assembled was to
</p>
<p>apprise the President of the V. V>. that they were in session
</p>
<p>and prepared to receive communications and transact
</p>
<p>business. The notice was handed to Mr O'Mahony by the
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Senate, who brought back a verbal reply to
</p>
<p>the effect that Mr O'Mahony declined to recognise or
</p>

</p>
<p>committee fared no better than the clerk, Mr O'Mahony
</p>
<p>again refusing to communicate with the Senate and turn-
</p>
<p>ing his back contemptuously on their representatives. The
</p>
<p>committee reported the result of their mission, and the
</p>
<p>matter was finally settled by Mr O'Mahony notifying
</p>
<p>Colonel W. R. Roberts, President of the Senate, by letter,.
</p>
<p>that he would not, in any wa}-, recognise or communicate
</p>
<p>with that body.
</p>
<p>" The standing Committee on Finance then proceeded to
</p>
<p>the palatial mansion in Union Square to examine into the
</p>
<p>condition of the financial system there pursued, and
</p>
<p>ascertain the actual state of the receipts and expendi-
</p>
<p>ture. To their surprise, howt^ver, Mr Killian refused to
</p>
<p>exhibit any vouchers, or to allow them to examine the
</p>
<p>books of account, and stated further that he regarded the
</p>
<p>application of \\\v. committee as originating in personal
</p>
<p>hostility to himself. The committee, having again formally
</p>
<p>demanded to be allowed to see the books and being still
</p>
<p>refused, withdrew and notified Mr O'Mahony in writing
</p>
<p>that his secretary had prevented their inspection of the
</p>
<p>accounts of the Finance Department. They also reported
</p>
<p>the same to the Senate.
</p>
<p>" A letter was subsequently received by the Senate front
</p>
<p>the President of the Continental Bank Note Company,
</p>
<p>informing that body that they had printed and delivered
</p>
<p>68,000 dollars worth of bonds of the Irish Republic, with the
</p>
<p>name of John O'Mahony engraved thereon as agent of the

<p>assumption of Mr O'Mahony to appoint himself to an office

<p>of such importance called for immediate action, and was

<p>met by the adoption of the annexed resolution :

<p>" This resolution was signed by all the Senators present
</p>
<p>(ten in number, being two-thirds of the whole body) and
</p>
<p>was transmitted to Mr O'Mahony on the 2d instant. Not-
</p>
<p>withstanding this, the Senate received definite information

<p>that the bonds liad been issued to the Circles of New

</p>
<p>culated in this city. The Senate at once adopted a notifi-

</p>
<p>This address, purportini^ to issue from the " Senate
</p>
<p>Chamber of the Fenian Brotherhood," and dated December
</p>
<p>7, 1865, exphiined the resolution as having been necessi-
</p>
<p>tated by the conduct of O'Mahony and his adherents who
</p>
<p>"disregarded the Constitution," and were impeding the
</p>
<p>action of better men, notably of the new War Secretary, b)'
</p>
<p>their "imbecility and dishonesty." The refusal of the
</p>
<p>president to allow his accounts to be examined  was dwelt
</p>
<p>upon ; and pointed allusion was made to the simiptuous-
</p>
<p>ness of head-quarters, and to its numerous useless and
</p>
<p>greedy "hangers on." It closed with these paragraphs : 
</p>
<p>" We ask of you to look at facts,  to listen to the truth.
</p>
<p>We ask you to support that man whose appointment to
</p>
<p>the direction of military affairs was hailed by all of you as
</p>
<p>a pledge that business was meant, that we were no longer to
</p>
<p>lemain inactive, while our brethren at home were lying in
</p>
<p>a J5ritish dungeon, awaiting their summons to the scaffold.
</p>
<p>"All remittances of money for the purposes of the
</p>
<p>Fenian Brotherhood should be made in drafts payable to
</p>
<p>the order of the Treasurer, Patrick O'Rourkc, and be
</p>
<p>directed to box 5,141, Post Office, New York. An account
</p>
<p>of the money forwarded by each Circle, since the date of
</p>
<p>the Philadelphia Congress, should be sent by the Treasurer
</p>
<p>of the Circle to the address of the Treasurer in New York
</p>
<p>as above. The names of those members who have paid
</p>
<p>the ' final call' should also be sent on, in order that these
</p>
<p>members may receive the bonds therefor, when properly

<p>signed and issued. We remain, Brothers, yours in fra-

<p>vening, not only justified the language in which in the
</p>
<p>above address the)' have characterised the proceedings of
</p>
<p>the Union Square rcginiC\ but would have left the members
</p>
<p>of the Senate in the position of accomplices of a heartless
</p>
<p>swindle had they held their peace for a single day, or
</p>
<p>neglected to put their countrymen upon their guard. Not
</p>
<p>alone was the money of the organisation being rapidly
</p>
<p>.squandered, in a manner and on persons never contem-
</p>
<p>plated by the honest and patriotic masses who subscribed
</p>
<p>the funds, but other sources of drain have been revealed,
</p>
<p>sufficient to shake the confidence of the most credulous in
</p>
<p>the professions of those who could countenance or screen
</p>
<p>them."
</p>
<p>J Icre follows a long account  rather si)iteful it must be
</p>
<p>admitted  of a little jobbery with resi)ect to a bill of
</p>
<p>exchange between Mr D, Killian and a friend who was at
</p>
<p>once the editor of a newspaper and the exchange agent of
</p>
<p>an lilnglish commercial house. It was intended of course
</p>
<p>that the incident should be accepted as one of daily occur-
</p>
<p>rence. The agent mentioned applied to the Senate, offer-
</p>
<p>ing to procure them any foreign bills of exchange they
</p>
<p>might need, and at the same time to allow his commission
</p>
<p>*' to be reserved for the advancement of the cause." The
</p>
<p>offer was declined chiefly because most of the Senators
</p>
<p>were business men, and could effect such transactions for
</p>
<p>themselves. Shortly afterwards, it being necessary to
</p>
<p>send sixty thousand dollars to Europe, this very agent was
</p>
<p>employed by Killian to effect the necessary exchange, and

</p>
<p>" ]')ut there remanis yet another little figure of the trans-
</p>
<p>action to be summed up. Previous to the adjournment of
</p>
<p>the Senate, that body had instructed the treasurer to con-
</p>
<p>vert 50,000 dollars of currency into gold, with a view to
</p>
<p>the purchase of exchange, as there Avere symptoms of a
</p>
<p>rise in the rates of specie. The gold was procured at a
</p>
<p>j)rcmium of 46?/^, and came to the sum of 34,275*192
</p>
<p>dollars. This gold was handed to Mr Secretary of
</p>
<p>the Treasury Killian, and was by him or his rhiladelphia
</p>
<p>agent sold on the 9th of November, the day on which the
</p>
<p>draft was purchased, for the hrm alluded to to testify
</p>
<p>again that the draft was paid for entirely in greenbacks.
</p>
<p>Now the premium on gold on that day was 46J/J to 465^,
</p>
<p>an advance in the value of the gold of from seven-eighths
</p>
<p>to one and an eighth i)er cent.,  about 400 dollars more.
</p>
<p>Will not some other Fenian brother, who has the entry of
</p>
<p>the ' Moffat Mansion,' kindly enquire whether the financial
</p>
<p>records of the 9th of November show this sum credited to
</p>

</p>
<p>with the refusal to allow the books to be examined, the
</p>
<p>Senate has no other course left, \\\ justice to the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood, but to speak out, and speak at once. They had
</p>
<p>been denied lists of the circles, and could only reach a
</p>
<p>large portion of them throu<;h the press.
</p>
<p>"The next proccedin<^ of the Senate was to receive articles
</p>
<p>of impeachment against JohnO'Mahonyand Bernard Doran
</p>
<p>Killian for * perfidy and malfeasance ' in office. These were
</p>
<p>handed in on the 7th instant, and copies served on the
</p>
<p>parties indicted next day, with notice to them to put in a
</p>
<p>proper pica in response within twenty-four hours, under
</p>
<p>penalty of having judgment by default recorded against
</p>
<p>them if they failed to appear. This was in accordance
</p>
<p>with the Constitutional provision which makes the Senate
</p>
<p>the sole tribunal to try impeachments and renders their
</p>
<p>decisions in such cases final.
</p>
<p>"The Senate, having gone into Judiciary Session, b}'

<p>the election of James Gibbons as temporary president and

<p>J. W. Fitzgerald as judge-advocate, proceeded to try the

<p>cases."
</p>
<p>The indictment against O'Mahony we shall not quote
</p>
<p>at length. In addition to the charges already mentioned
</p>
<p>of which he was accused were these,  of having read a

<p>certain communication from Ireland at open meetings,
</p>
<p>mentioning also at these meetings '* the proper name of

</p>
<p>and impeding the attainment of the objects for which it

<p>was formed."
</p>
<p>Tlie charges against Killian were mainly these,  of re-
</p>
<p>fusing to produce his books ; of refusing to pay over
</p>
<p>money to the treasurer; and of withholding certain sums
</p>
<p>from the Secretary at War.
</p>
<p>Two hours wei*e spent in investigating the charges, no
</p>
<p>inconsiderable portion of the time having been occupied
</p>
<p>in reading them. Both of the accused were found guilty
</p>
<p>on all the counts, and sentenced to be removed from their
</p>
<p>offices.
</p>
<p>"Judgment in both cases having been recorded and
</p>
<p>signed by the members present, the Senate resumed its
</p>
<p>session, and the several proceedings were ordered to be
</p>
<p>placed on the minutes, and notice of them to be issued to
</p>
<p>all whom it might concern.
</p>
<p>"It was then unanimously resolved that. In order that

<p>the organisation might not be left without a recognisetl
</p>
<p>head at such a crisis, the President of the Senate, Vice-

<p>President of the 1\ B., Colonel W. R. Roberts do qualify

<p>for the office of President of the F. B., now vacant, and

<p>the duties this imposed upon him, until the office of P. of

<p>elected James Gibbons of Tliiladelpliia as its permanent

<p>president, in room of President Roberts. To fill the
</p>
<p>vacancy created in the Senate by the elevation of Colonel
</p>
<p>Roberts, P. W. Dunne of Peorea, 111., was nominated and
</p>
<p>unanimously confirmed. J.J. Geary, late of Cork, whose
</p>
<p>value to the national cause the English Government has
</p>
<p>stamped by putting a price upon his head of ^200, was
</p>
<p>appointed assistant-treasurer. In view of the difficulty of
</p>
<p>providing a permanent treasurer (owing to the large
</p>
<p>security, 500,000 dollars, required by the Constitution),
</p>
<p>P. O'Rourke, the old general treasurer of the organisation,
</p>
<p>Avas appointed treasurer till further notice, and gave bonds
</p>
<p>in the sum of 40,000 dollars for the faithful performance of
</p>
<p>his duties. Three trustees, W. Sullivan, of Liffm, Ohio ;
</p>
<p>James Gibbons, of Philadelphia ; and Edward I>. Carey, of
</p>
<p>New York, were appointed trustees of the funds, and the
</p>
<p>signatures of at least two of these will be necessary should
</p>
<p>t4ie treasurer ever need to draw a larger sum than his
</p>
<p>securities will cover.
</p>
<p>" Diu'ing the day the Senate received many letters of

<p>encouragement and support from country districts ; and
</p>
<p>numerous delegations from the best working circles in the

<p>their determination to stand by it in its efforts to purify

</p>
<p>and explanations, counter to those of the Roberts party,
</p>
<p>were issued in numbers. ]5ut, perhaps, the most striking
</p>
<p>of these retorts was the placard posted up at " Moffat
</p>
<p>Mansion," of which we i^ivc a copy : 
</p>
<p>"It beini^ deemed advisable to keep dishonest persons
</p>

</p>
<p>Brotherhood, as well as the enemies of the Brotherhood
</p>
<p>from its immediate valuables, the following persons are
</p>
<p>excluded for perfidy until further notice. Per order,
</p>
<p>John O'Maiiony, President, F. B."
</p>
<p>I Then followed the names of the senators who had
</p>
<p>deposed him in the order in which they had signed his
</p>
<p>sentence of deposition.
</p>
<p>As his best stroke, however, O'Mahony lost no time in
</p>
<p>convening the " P'ourth National Convention of the i^'enian
</p>
<p>Brotherhood." It was to meet in New York on the 3d of
</p>
<p>January 1866. The great mass of the Organisation was
</p>
<p>taken completely by surprise by recent events. No man
</p>
<p>knew w hat opinion to form of them, or which side to take ;
</p>
<p>but all were anxious for explanation, and doubly anxious
</p>
<p>for the restoration of unity among their heads. This Con-
</p>
<p>gress therefore, proved the most numerous gathering of
</p>
<p>the kind that had yet taken place. P^rom the first it was
</p>
<p>evident that the O'Mahony partisans largely outnumbered
</p>
<p>those of the Senate. Nor was the deposed president con-
</p>
<p>tent with the unmistakeable manifestation of opinion in
</p>
<p>his favour. Pie took a measure which was unquestionably

<p>intended to overawe his adversaries, posting a com[)anyof

<p>the Congress assembled. TJie company was in full uni-
</p>
<p>form  a fair token of the estimation in which the F. B.
</p>
<p>was held by the rulers of the United States.
</p>
<p>Having done their utmost to prevent the meeting of the
</p>
<p>Congress, by the issue of proclamations couched in fit official
</p>
<p>style, and by the exercise of all their influence in the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, and having failed utterly, President Roberts
</p>
<p>and his senators absented themselves altogether from the
</p>
<p>assemblage. Only one prominent mcniber of their party,
</p>
<p>General Sweeny, made his appearance therein. He spoke
</p>
<p>boldly in favour of schemes projected by himself, including
</p>
<p>the " Conquest of Canada." The general, volunteering
</p>
<p>to give any explanations required, was asked one very
</p>
<p>awkward question  " Was he a Fenian .? " With this he
</p>
<p>fenced for a while, but was eventually compelled to admit
</p>
<p>that he had never been regularly enrolled in the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood. He said he attended a circle at St Louis, which
</p>
<p>had given him credentials. " But did you take the Fenian
</p>
<p>pledge, answer that t " continued his examiner with perti-
</p>
<p>nacity.
</p>
<p>General Sweeny (after a pause) " T sympathise with the
</p>
<p>movement, and I am ready, if necessary, to sacrifice my
</p>
<p>life for it."
</p>
<p>A voice  "Why don't you answer if you are a Fenian
</p>
<p> If you took the I'^enian pledge ? "
</p>
<p>General Sweeny  " I did not take the pledge ; but it
</p>
<p>is needless to state that 1 am in favour of the movement."
</p>
<p>(This remark called forth some disapprobation).

<p>A delegate here stood up, and gave it as his most de-

<p>cided opinion, that the General had no right to address

</p>
<p>the Convention, that he was merely there by courtesy ;
</p>
<p>according to his own showing, he was not a Fenian, and
</p>
<p>should not be heard. There were other objections raised ;
</p>
<p>eventually, General Sweeny, though with no very good
</p>
<p>will, took the pledge, which, however, did not improve
</p>
<p>his position. His pr()[)ositions were all rejected.
</p>
<p>A different reception awaited the two delegates from
</p>
<p>Ireland, one being General Millen, and the other the
</p>
<p>notorious Corydon. The latter had then an aspect in
</p>
<p>the eyes of the Brotherhood very different from that
</p>
<p>which he was soon to wear. He is described by one who

<p>saw him at the Congress as " a fine-looking military man,
</p>
<p>with the soldier indelibly printed on his handsome face."
</p>
<p>The delegates were enthusiastically cheered. " War in
</p>
<p>Ireland, and Ireland alone," was declared to be the policy
</p>
<p>of the 1". B. The senators were dei)osed from office, the
</p>
<p>recently-framed constitution was repudiated, and the
</p>
<p>Chicago Constitution re-adopted. O'Mahony was unani-
</p>
<p>mously accepted as " Head Centre," his old title, and a
</p>
<p>" Central Council " was given him, selected from among
</p>
<p>his most devoted adherents.
</p>
<p>The Roberts party was nothing daunted by these
</p>
<p>events. It had a following ; it held firmly to the position
</p>
<p>to which it had raised itself; and it set to work vigorously
</p>
<p>to realise its Canadian conquest plans. On the 1 6th of
</p>
<p>January it issued a " war circular," which bore the sig-
</p>
<p>nature of General Sweeny, directing the military members
</p>
<p>of the J''. B. to hold themselves \\\ readiness for immediate
</p>
<p>action ; appealing for necessary funds, and explaining that

<p>the Brotherhood needed " a spot on which to raise our flag
</p>
<p>230 The Fe7iian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and obtain a recognition of our riglits as belligerents. We
</p>
<p>cannot have it within the United States," continued this
</p>
<p>circular ; " we need a port from which our vessels can sail,
</p>
<p>and to which they can bring their prizes. Do not believe
</p>
<p>that we mean side issues. Ireland must and ever will be
</p>
<p>our grand objective point. Trust to the experience of men
</p>
<p>who, for long years, have studied war's secrets in anticipa-
</p>
<p>tion of a day when they could strike the foe of their race
</p>
<p>and country. Respond to my call as freely as your means
</p>
<p>will allow, and within three months we shall have fought
</p>
<p>our first battle, gained our first victory, and Ireland will
</p>
<p>liave made her first step towards the throne of Liberty."
</p>
<p>The recognition of the circular of which the above is an
</p>
<p>extract, was the principal work of a Congress which was
</p>
<p>called by President Roberts, and which met in considerable
</p>
<p>number at Pittsburg, on the 19th of February. It was in-
</p>
<p>tended as a reply to the New York Congress. It endorsed
</p>
<p>the action of the senators in every particular, recognised
</p>
<p>the new officers, and adopted their policy.
</p>
<p>Precisely three days after, "a military convention," sum-
</p>
<p>moned by O'Mahony, met in New York. The day, the
</p>
<p>2 2d of February, was the anniversary of the birth of
</p>
<p>Washington. Here a series of fiery resolutions were
</p>
<p>adopted, one of Ihem to the effect that all the energy of
</p>
<p>the association was to be concentrated on warfare in Ire-
</p>
<p>land. In another, full confidence in O'Mahony and
</p>
<p>Stephens was expressed.
</p>
<p>Seeing as we have done, how intensely hostile were
</p>
<p>these two, it may excite surprise that a meeting called

</p>
<p>by O'Mahony should thus glorify Stephens. But, In the
</p>
<p>Immediate Consequences of the Arrests in '65. 231
</p>
<p>view of the f^reat body of the American Fenians, Stephens
</p>
<p>was still a " liero and a martyr,"  a hero, on account of
</p>
<p>liis successful "organisation;" a martyr, because of his
</p>
<p>capture and imprisonment ; and again and doubly a
</p>
<p>hero on account of his mysterious escape from prison.
</p>
<p>O'Mahony felt the dangers of the crisis in America to
</p>
<p>liimself and to the conspiracy ; power was slipping fast
</p>
<p>from his hands ; effective strength was slipping as fast
</p>
<p>from the organisation. It was necessary to patch up
</p>
<p>peace with the C. E., and he tried to do so. Stephens
</p>
<p>appeared to fall in with him. With O'Mahony Stephens
</p>
<p>condemned the action of the Roberts faction as utterly
</p>
<p>useless to Ireland, and absolutely ruinous to the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. Letters in the highest degree complimentary
</p>
<p>were written by him to the Head Centre, and read by the
</p>
<p>latter at various meetings and " demonstrations." For at
</p>
<p>this period both sections of the F. W. were eternally meet-
</p>
<p>ing ami "demonstrating;" the latter, for the most part,
</p>
<p>being done in the fashion of absolute lunatics, and de-
</p>
<p>nouncing one another also as all that was infamous ; such
</p>
<p>choice epithets as "swindlers," "perjurers," "traitors,"
</p>
<p>" impostors," being exchanged daily between the rival
</p>
<p>chiefs, and, it must be admitted, fitting only too well in
</p>
<p>many instances. The Roberts party denounced these
</p>
<p>letters read by O'Mahony as forgeries, but there can be no
</p>
<p>question that they were genuine. And, to a large extent,
</p>
<p>they served their purpose. Thanks to them the following
</p>
<p>of O'Mahony continued greatly to outnumber the following
</p>
<p>of Roberts for a few months more.

</p>
<p>Of course the resolutions of the military convention
</p>
<p>232 The Fenia7t Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>condemned the secession in strong terms. An address to
</p>
<p>the Brotherhood was adopted. It was couched in earnest
</p>
<p>language, but did little more than rehearse the substance
</p>
<p>of the Resolutions.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile things were going badly with the I. R. B. in
</p>
<p>Ireland. Clever as were its organisers, the agents of the
</p>
<p>government managed to keep every one of them in sight,
</p>
<p>stepping forward and arresting them invariably at the
</p>
<p>right time. Still the conspiracy continued ah've and active ;
</p>
<p>there was no knowing in what machicss it might not cul-
</p>
<p>minate. At this period, it must have been sufficiently
</p>
<p>obvious to every person of sense, who had any fair know-
</p>
<p>ledge of its position, that it was utterly hopeless. Its
</p>
<p>plans were disclosed ; its leaders were arrested ; the foe
</p>
<p>was well prepared to meet it at every point ; it was un-
</p>
<p>prepared to meet the foe at any point. Leaders, wise and
</p>
<p>patriotic, would have dissolved the organisation at once,
</p>
<p>especially after the schism in America. But there was no .
</p>
<p>wisdom and but little patriotism among the leaders.
</p>
<p>What the latter cared for most was to retain their position
</p>
<p>in the conspiracy, and therefore to continue its activity as
</p>
<p>long as possible. To attempt something, however despe-
</p>
<p>rate, was felt to be absolutely necessary by them every-
</p>
<p>where.
</p>
<p>Giving evidence before the investigation committee,
</p>
<p>at this period, Mr Killian said (Report, page 15), "///
</p>
<p>viy opinion, the real reputation of the F. B. in A nierica can
</p>
<p>only be revived by strikiiig a bloiv and making a fight. I

<p>Brotherhood in America who can revive us unless there be

<p>Immediate Coiisequeiices of the Arrests in '65. 233
</p>
<p>a fight." So felt the Roberts party. Both factions knew
</p>
<p>that they could make no serious fight themselves. Their
</p>
<p>efforts then were directed, as many of them stated openly,
</p>
<p>towards doing something which should involve the United
</p>
<p>States in war with England. In these efforts they were
</p>
<p>countenanced by American statesmen of both parties.
</p>
<p>Vo\'y and this is a fact that deserves special notice, the rival
</p>
<p>factions of Fenianism, adhered to opposite political parties
</p>
<p>in the States. O'Mahony was a democrat ; the Roberts
</p>
<p>party were nearly all Republicans.
</p>
<p>In Ireland there was no plan and no preparation ; but
</p>
<p>there was an abundance of headlong conspirators  there
</p>
<p>was fierce enthusiasm ; and there was an ardent desire for
</p>
<p>battle. The great risk was tliat the thing would break
</p>
<p>forth any day in rebellion, after the style of '98 ; that is,
</p>
<p>in a number of unconnected risings, marked by a good
</p>
<p>deal of dash and valour on the part of the insurgents ;
</p>
<p>marked also by an infinity of outrages, leading to no suc-
</p>
<p>cess on their part, but closing in their slaughter by the
</p>
<p>thousand, with great loss to the country in particular and
</p>
<p>to the empire in general ; with the addition of newer,
</p>
<p>fresher memories of hate, to the immense mass of such
</p>
<p>memories already accumulated by the Irish, and the con-
</p>
<p>secjuent protraction of the old-progress-opposing spirit in
</p>
<p>the Irish for another century. To prevent any .such
</p>
<p>insane rising was now the principal object of the British
</p>
<p>Government. And, the more effectually to do so, the
</p>
<p>habeas corpus was declared suspended in Ireland from the
</p>
<p>17th of February 1866. The bill authorising this act was

</p>
<p>passed with unprecedented rapidity. This, however, was
</p>
<p>234 l'^^ Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>expected by the authorities in Ireland ; and in anticipa-
</p>
<p>tion thereof, some six score of the principal leaders were
</p>
<p>pounced upon simultaneously in Dublin. Every day
</p>
<p>added to the number of captives, until, by the 31st of the
</p>
<p>ensuing March, there had been no less than 670 arrested
</p>
<p>under this act.
</p>
<p>These decided measures had the effect intended. They
</p>
<p>did not kill off the conspiracy in Ireland ; but, in a great
</p>
<p>measure, paralysed it. It was impossible for any move-
</p>
<p>ment of the smallest consequence to take place ; impos-
</p>
<p>sible, indeed, for any important meeting of the leaders to
</p>
<p>be held. Many of the more timid abandoned the associa-
</p>
<p>tion ; many who aspired to lead therein threw away the
</p>
<p>insignia of rank with which, more through vanity than
</p>
<p>patriotism, they had provided themselves. For months
</p>
<p>after the proclamation of the act suspending the habeas
</p>
<p>corpus, bundles containing gaudy and expensive uniforms
</p>
<p> garments of green, heavily laced and ornamented with
</p>
<p>gold  were picked up in the fields and along the byways,
</p>
<p>where they had been thrown away. It was necessary for
</p>
<p>the leaders, or as many as could be spared, to quit Ire-
</p>
<p>land for a time. O'Rourke and Mackay, with some sixty
</p>
<p>or seventy other American Irish officers, betook them-
</p>
<p>selves to England ; while others of greater name, as
</p>
<p>Kelly and M'Cafferty, found plausible excuses for visiting
</p>
<p>America.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the strangest circumstance in connection with
</p>
<p>the conspiracy at this period, was the release of Edward
</p>
<p>Duffy on bail. He was known to be deep in the con-

<p>fidence of Stephens, the one, indeed, whom the latter
</p>
<p>Immediate Consequences of the Arrests in '65. 235
</p>
<p>trusted more than any or all of his lieutenants  the one
</p>
<p>whom, as it was also known, he had flattered with the
</p>
<p>prospect of succeeding himself (Stephens) should he be
</p>
<p>removed from the scene, in command of the I. R. B. One
</p>
<p>by one the colleagues of Duffy had been brought to trial
</p>
<p>and convicted  convicted  to the consternation no less
</p>
<p>than the astonishment of the mass of thel.R.B.  withhardly
</p>
<p>an exception ; convicted with such regularity and certainty,
</p>
<p>that more than one desperado, feeling his case hopeless,
</p>
<p>pleaded " guilty," in the view of obtaining a milder sen-
</p>
<p>tence. But Duffy  high-placed as he was in the I. R. B.,
</p>
<p>and trusted as he was of his leader  was admitted to bail.
</p>
<p>There was a pretext  he was then far advanced in con-
</p>
<p>sumption. But the pretext did not avail when it was
</p>
<p>found necessary to arrest him once more  this time to
</p>
<p>bring him to trial and conviction.
</p>
<p>No sooner was Duffy at large than he went on conspir-
</p>
<p>ing and nursing revolution, even more earnestly than
</p>
<p>before. He was allowed to do so for a year.
</p>
<p>Having seen his favourite pupil and subordinate at
</p>
<p>liberty, Stephens made up his mind to quit Ireland on the
</p>
<p>nth of March. Before doing so he issued an order, that
</p>
<p>no movement was to take place in Ireland until his arrival

<p>in America. This statement we make on the authority of

<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>MOVEMENTS OF STEPHENS AFTER IIIS ESCAPE.
</p>
<p>The following letter, written by Colonel T. J. Kelly,
</p>
<p>shows how he reached France : 
</p>
<p>" Paris, March list, 1866.
</p>
<p>" My Dear .  When I parted from you on Tuesday night,
</p>
<p>you hadn't much idea of the heavy task before me. Yet now that all
</p>
<p>is over, it appears to be only a dream. Although you thought Mr
</p>
<p>Stephens had left the country, he was in Dublin until that night,
</p>
<p>and, spite of all the vigilance of British spies, he left his lodgings on
</p>
<p>an outside car, got on board a vessel in the Liffcy, and sailed for an
</p>
<p>English port.
</p>
<p>" It was amusing to me to see him pass several policemen on the
</p>
<p>quays, and walk deliberately on board. We were three days in the
</p>
<p>Channel owing to bad winds. We ultimately reached a port in Scot-
</p>
<p>land, slept all night in Kilmarnock, rode in the mail train next day
</p>
<p>from there to London, slept in London (in the heart of the enemy's
</p>
<p>city), and in the morning, after sleeping all night in a hotel across
</p>
<p>the street from Buckingham Palace (the Palace Hotel), started by
</p>
<p>the morning train from the Victoria Station for Dover.
</p>
<p>" We got on board the French mail steamer there about eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock on Sunday, and started for Calais, which we reached in
</p>
<p>safety. Wasn't my mind happy when I touched French soil, and
</p>
<p>saw the Chief Organiser of the Irish Republic in a position to laugh
</p>
<p>at the blindly mad, childlike efforts of the British to capture him.
</p>
<p>"After all the searches of ships and steamers outside of the Irish
</p>
<p>coast, so well were we informed of their every movement, that the
</p>
<p>affair was comparatively easy. The next time th;it James Stephens
</p>
<p>touches the Irish soil, he will show the British that their barbarous
</p>
<p>treatment of Irish patriots but added fuel to the national flame

</p>
<p>they propose to do. Sir Hugh Rose will find, when he attempts to
</p>
<p>commit such devilish barbarities * as tliose of which he was Ruilty in
</p>
<p>India, (hat he has not sepoys to d< al with. Let him order his
</p>
<p>soldiers to butcher women and children and grey-haired old men (as
</p>
<p>he threatened to do), and blow our soldiers from the cannon's
</p>
<p>mouth  let him dare carry out his black-hearted intentions towards
</p>
<p>the women of Ireland, and there will be such a retribution, not alone
</p>
<p>in Ireland, but in the heart of the British Empire, as will not be
</p>
<p>paralleled in history. The enemy left no stone unturned to make us
</p>
<p>fight before we were ready; they played a desperate card and lost.
</p>
<p>Just wait and see the effect of the arrival of Mr Stephens in America,
</p>
<p>and you will See I speak correctly. All is well for Ireland yet. Next
</p>
<p>Christmas I have confidence I will dine with you as a free and inde-
</p>
<p>pendent citizen of the Irish Republic. THOMAS J. Kelly."
</p>
<p>"Paris, i\st.
</p>
<p>"Dear Miss .  I have been remiss in not writing to you
</p>
<p>before this. Mr Stephens and myself arrived here on Sunday last.
</p>
<p>We were enabled to make our trip with great ease. Just think how
</p>
<p>horribly stupid the enemy's agents are when we were enabled to
</p>
<p>travel in the open day through Scotland and England, and to em-
</p>
<p>bark at eleven in the day from the harbour of Dover.
</p>
<p>"After all the ship-searching, we started from the quays in the City
</p>
<p>of Dublin. Mr Stephens left his lodgings in an open car, and, on my
</p>
<p>honour, undisguised. We had no easy time in the Channel, as we
</p>
<p>were kept there for three days owing to adverse winds. We were
</p>
<p>driven to Carrickfergus Bay by stress of weather, and it was amusing
</p>
<p>to think how much the Mayor of Belfast would give to know what a
</p>
<p>distinguished guest he had. However, as the wind changed after
</p>
<p>being anchored all night, we did not make a call, or leave our cards.
</p>
<p>"T.J.Kelly."
</p>
<p>In these letters Colonel Kelly speaks very strongly of
</p>
<p>the " stupidity " of the English agents, in permitting such
</p>
<p>an audacious escape. We ourselves are struck by the
</p>
<p>seeming audacity ; but we do not, like the Colonel, attri-
</p>
<p>buted the success of the attempt to the "stupidity" of the

<p>* This from the man who organised the Assassination Commillcc, and
</p>
<p>who directed tlie murder of Clark to begin with, from a brothel ! These
</p>
<p>patriots had one moral code for themselves and another for their opponents.
</p>
<p>238 . The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>English agents. It is a fact that the pair, Stephens and
</p>
<p>Kelly, were recognised at Kilmarnock and at other places
</p>
<p>on their way to Dover. On the whole, we see in the escape
</p>
<p>from Dublin a remarkable resemblance to the escape from
</p>
<p>Richmond Bridewell. In both cases the police were care-
</p>
<p>fully absent from the precise quarters from which the
</p>
<p>escapes were effected ; and in both cases Mr Stephens
</p>
<p>took his departure exactly as other people  through the
</p>
<p>door of the Bridewell, and in the open day, and by the
</p>
<p>usual routes from Dublin in the first place, and from Eng-
</p>
<p>land in the second place.
</p>
<p>A passage of the first letters deserves special attention 
</p>
<p>"There will be such a retribution not alone in Ireland, but
</p>
<p>in the heart of the British Empire, as will not be paralleled
</p>
<p>in history." Here not merely London, but the great com-
</p>
<p>mercial and manufacturing centres are meant by "the
</p>
<p>heart of the British Empire," and here the gallant
</p>
<p>" Colonel " alludes to the plan, which he had already formed,
</p>
<p>and which a little later he attempted to carry out  that is,
</p>
<p>to give up the " Heart of the British Empire," as we have
</p>
<p>explained the phrase, and especially the metropolis, to sack
</p>
<p>and slaughter. The Chester affair, which so many of the
</p>
<p>I. R. B. assert to have been intended as a preliminary to
</p>
<p>Irish revolution, was really intended to arm the I. R. B. in
</p>
<p>England against the heart of the British Empire.
</p>
<p>At Paris Stephens found suitable occupation and
</p>
<p>amusement. " In Paris," writes General Cluseret: {Frasers
</p>
<p>Magazine, July 1872), "the Marquis de Boissy enter-
</p>
<p>tained him. Whilst in that city he entered into close

</p>
<p>relations with those scandalous Boulevard papers, from
</p>
<p>Movements of Stephens after his Escape, 239
</p>
<p>which a man who respects himself ought to accept
</p>
<p>nothing but abuse." The quotation is a short one, but
</p>
<p>it means much. Here is the C. E. hob-nobbing with
</p>
<p>de Boissy, who in his Hfe was only remarkable for his
</p>
<p>rabid hostility to everything English, with the very curi-
</p>
<p>ous exception of the mistress of an Englishman, which
</p>
<p>mistress he made his wife. Here he is too in close
</p>
<p>and confidential communication with Rochefort, Pyat, and
</p>
<p>people of that stamp.
</p>
<p>Cluseret, however, should not have spoken so con-
</p>
<p>temptuously of the journalists of the "Boulevards." It
</p>
<p>was in consequence of the relations which Stephens formed
</p>
<p>with these people on this occasion that he conceived a
</p>
<p>design respecting Cluseret, the execution of which enabled
</p>
<p>the General to write to the paper from which we have
</p>
<p>quoted.
</p>
<p>Immediately on his arrival in Paris, Stephens hurried
</p>
<p>Kelly forward to America with despatches full of the
</p>
<p>usual lavish promise. He himself continued to abide in
</p>
<p>the French capital for "some weeks longer. During this
</p>
<p>period it is asserted that he had at least one interview
</p>
<p>with the Emperor. Here also he indulged that taste for
</p>
<p>luxurious living which had grown upon him since his
</p>
<p>conspiracy had begun to pay, and which by this time had
</p>
<p>attained something of royal dimensions. Some of his ad-
</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.
</p>
<p> STEPHENS IN NEW YORK.
</p>
<p>The C. O. I. R. found the Head Centre and his party in
</p>
<p>difficulties. O'Mahony had engaged in rivalry with
</p>
<p>President Roberts, more eagerly and energetically, and
</p>
<p>passionately, we may add, than he had ever engaged in
</p>
<p>anything before. Immediately on receiving intelligence
</p>
<p>of the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, he
</p>
<p>issued a circular directing the Centres to summon their
</p>
<p>Circles, and display the situation, which he persisted in
</p>
<p>painting as hopeful in the extreme, and which his dupes
</p>
<p>would persist in thinking all he painted. Just the same
</p>
<p>course was pursued by Roberts. " Send us all the aid in
</p>
<p>your power," wrote O'Mahony, " and in God's name let us
</p>
<p>start for our destination," meaning Ireland. " Send us all
</p>
<p>the aid in your power," wrote Roberts, " and in God's
</p>
<p>name let us start for our destination," meaning Canada.
</p>
<p>And the Circles  whom the conduct of the British
</p>
<p>government pleased, though it exasperated, since it showed
</p>
<p>that something was being done at last  the Circles re-
</p>
<p>sponded liberally. Money came into both treasurers in
</p>
<p>heaps. O'Mahony's party convened a monster meeting
</p>
<p>at Jones' Wood, which was attended by myriads. Here
</p>
<p>a vast number of bonds of the I, R. were disposed of for
</p>
<p>cash. Other meetings followed nightly. In vain did the

</p>
<p>successor of Archbishop Hughes in the See of New York
</p>
<p>denounce the association. Misfortune and denunciation
</p>
<p>only seemed to render its members the more ardent. Both
</p>
<p>factions declared that the period of * words ' and mere
</p>
<p>* organisation ' had passed away, that the period of achieve-
</p>
<p>ment had come. It was a struggle between them which
</p>
<p>should be first in the field, and O'Mahony's party prevailed
</p>
<p>therein.
</p>
<p>The Head Centre was by this time, though so boasting
</p>
<p>and apparently self-asserting in public, a mere cypher in
</p>
<p>the hands of his own party. No one man among them
</p>
<p>could say that he alone manipulated the Head Centre.
</p>
<p>He vacillated from one opinion to another, and from one
</p>
<p>purpose to another, hourly ; always agreeing with the last
</p>
<p>who tried his persuasive, or rather bullying, powers upon
</p>
<p>him. At last Mr Dorran Killian won him over to assent
</p>
<p>to a scheme which was borrowed from the rival party.
</p>
<p>Killian, we should state, had obtained an interview with
</p>
<p>Mr Secretary Seward, on the occasion of the release of
</p>
<p>Mitchell, and he declared, and his declaration never having
</p>
<p>been authoritatively contradicted, is deserving of some
</p>
<p>weight, that Mr Seward was favourable to an attack on
</p>
<p>the British possessions in America by the Fenians. Kil-
</p>
<p>lian formed the idea of taking possession of the island of
</p>
<p>Campo Bello, province of New Brunswick, and hoisting
</p>
<p>the flag of the Irish Republic thereon. What the flag was
</p>
<p>would be hard to decide. Stephens had selected one pat-
</p>
<p>tern, O'Mahony another, Roberts a third ; indeed, there
</p>
<p>was hardly a leading member of the fraternity who had

</p>
<p>not a notion of his own concerning this flag.
</p>
<p>Stephens in New York. 243
</p>
<p>Killian thought it would be an easy thing to obtain
</p>
<p>possession of the island, and that once in possession of even
</p>
<p>this small spot, of no importance in itself, the government of
</p>
<p>Ihc United States would find no difficulty in recognising the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood as belligerents. Indeed, it was industriously
</p>
<p>reported among tlie J^rotherhood that the members of the
</p>
<p>United States government had pledged themselves to take
</p>
<p>this course whenever the F. B. should provide them with
</p>
<p>something like an excuse. M'Cafferty and Ilalpen were
</p>
<p>then in New York, the former had been despatched
</p>
<p>by the Irish Council after the escape of Stephens from
</p>
<p>prison, and the latter had commissioned himself as envoy,
</p>
<p>after the suspension of the Habeas Corptis Act, in order to
</p>
<p>avoid the consequences  both supported the views of
</p>
<p>Killian.
</p>
<p>On the 31st of March O'Mahony issued a circular
</p>
<p>calling for men and war material to be sent at once to
</p>
<p>head-quarters. Men and money were sent, and more
</p>
<p>were promised. Mr P. A. Sinnott, of the Central
</p>
<p>Council, promised that he would send 10,000 men from
</p>
<p>Massachusetts without costing the organisation a penny.
</p>
<p>Mr Sinnott did not even attempt to keep his word.
</p>
<p>Other people followed his example. Ultimately this great
</p>
<p>expedition, which was to raise the Brotherhood to the
</p>
<p>position of belligerents, dwindled down to a handful of
</p>
<p>men in a small steamer. And the equipment of the one
</p>
<p>and the purchase and outfit of the other, were marked by
</p>
<p>gross fraud and incapacity.

</p>
<p>of the party attempted to stop the folly. General
</p>
<p>244 ^^^ Fenian Co7ispiracy,
</p>
<p>Mullen, O'Mahony's war secretary, wrote a letter ta
</p>
<p>his principal, in which we find these passages :  " Mi^
</p>
<p>Centre, do you know the condition at present of the
</p>
<p>vessel ? A target for artillery practice could not be
</p>
<p>more successfully painted  black hull and straw-coloured
</p>
<p>wheel-house. Some buckets were furnished that have light
</p>
<p>brass or copper handles ; the first dash over, the bucket
</p>
<p>is lost, the rope remaining in the man's hands. Her
</p>
<p>rigging is in a miserable condition ; her sails in a worse
</p>
<p>Doubtless full of bilgewater. Her bilge should be pumped
</p>
<p>out, and white-washed. She had, when last heard from
</p>
<p>by me, no hammocks, no cooking utensils, in fact was a
</p>
<p>mere shell. Her machinery and steam-generating powers,
</p>
<p>untested ; coal-bunkers and magazines empty. Seriously,
</p>
<p>is it intended to put this shell upon the ocean as the
</p>
<p>representative of the Fenian Navy."
</p>
<p>The warning was disregarded. Mr Killian was allowed
</p>
<p>to carry out his plan, even though the Head Centre thought
</p>
<p>him in the pay of the Canadian Government. And
</p>
<p>M'Cafferty and others pressed the expedition forward,
</p>
<p>although they spoke, and loudly too, of manifold swindling
</p>
<p>connected with it. More, a captain, one Barbot, formerly
</p>
<p>of the Confederate navy, was appointed, whom O'Mahony
</p>
<p>characterised as "a real buccaneer." The expedition sailed
</p>
<p>early in April  not on the most suitable day however, the
</p>
<p>first, came in sight of Campo Bello, and surrendered to an
</p>
<p>American force in order to escape capture by the English.
</p>
<p>Not a single shot was fired. The only effect of the expe-
</p>
<p>dition was to empty the exchequer at " Head-quarters,'*

</p>
<p>lion, in sliort to ruin It, for it never recovered the blow,
</p>
<p>whicli indeed went far towards inflicting a fatal wound on
</p>
<p>the F. B.
</p>
<p>President Roberts and his party rejoiced in the fiasco 
</p>
<p>one of the most pitiable on record up to. that date  raised
</p>
<p>their own vaunts in still louder tones than before, and
</p>
<p>pressed forward their own preparations. A good many had
</p>
<p>fallen off from them as from O'Mahony. The exposure of
</p>
<p>the doings at Moffat Mansion, of its weakness, incompetence,
</p>
<p>prodigality, and corruption, made about this time by a Com-
</p>
<p>mittee of Investigation, which was called for in consequence
</p>
<p>of the Campo Bello failure, was accepted by all sensible
</p>
<p>men as applying to both parties. Thenceforward all
</p>
<p>sensible men saw that Fenianism was just what John
</p>
<p>Mitchell described it a little later, " an enormous sack of
</p>
<p>gas," and ceased to expect anything from it save deception.
</p>
<p>F.ven the American newspapers took courage for the first
</p>
<p>time to denounce the whole thing in precise terms.
</p>
<p>Still President Roberts and his party were unconnected
</p>
<p>with the Campo Bello affair, and, in the eyes of their fol-
</p>
<p>lowers, undamaged by it. The President and his Senate
</p>
<p>then came to the front among the Brotherhood, and the
</p>
<p>Head Centre and his Council were completely eclipsed,
</p>
<p>;dmost effaced.
</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that Stephens reached New
</p>
<p>York. A letter from John Mitchell, however, had
</p>
<p>reached that city before him. It ran thus:  ''My
</p>
<p>dear O'Mahony,  James Stephens is going to Ameriea;
</p>
<p>in God's name, under no condition, permit him to obtain

</p>
<p>control of, or ride the Fenian Organisation in America^
</p>
<p>246 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>That meant that John Mitchell quite understood the
</p>
<p>secret connected with the strange escape of Stephens
</p>
<p>from Richmond Bridewell, and with his impunity after-
</p>
<p>wards during his long stay in Dublin, and during his
</p>
<p>journey to France.
</p>
<p>The warning was published at once and widely.
</p>
<p>O'Mahony, though receiving the C. O. I. R. with open
</p>
<p>arms in public, neglected no opportunity of injuring him
</p>
<p>in private. Not only did he circulate Mitchell's letter
</p>
<p>himself, but contrived that it should fall into the hands of
</p>
<p>the Investigating Committee who included it in their
</p>
<p>report. It had its effect, but that was altogether the fault
</p>
<p>of Stephens.
</p>
<p>For a man of commanding qualities  a man of sincerity
</p>
<p>and earnestness  in the position of Stephens, there was
</p>
<p>now a splendid opportunity. The great mass of the con-
</p>
<p>spirators in both hemispheres still believed  more than
</p>
<p>believed  in him. With the rank and file recent events,
</p>
<p>as they saw them, had made him a hero. The chiefs knew
</p>
<p>him better, but their opposition would have been swept
</p>
<p>away by popular enthusiasm had he known how to take
</p>
<p>advantage of it. In America, however, the cool, dexterous,,
</p>
<p>and subtle moulder of conspiracy subsided at once into a
</p>
<p>commonplace demagogue. If he understood the situation
</p>
<p>he could not rise equal to it } Was he paralysed by the
</p>
<p>consciousness of treachery.? It looks like it. However
</p>
<p>that may be, his conduct at this period was miserable.
</p>
<p>Such attempts as he made to extinguish faction, reunite
</p>
<p>the Brotherhood, and restore its confidence, were about the

</p>
<p>weakest that can be conceived. New circumstances must
</p>
<p>Stephens in New Yo7'k. 247
</p>
<p>be met with new measures, but with him all was stale.
</p>
<p>As he had done in '58 and in '54, so he attempted to do in
</p>
<p>'66, and  nothing more.
</p>
<p>Obviously his first care should have been to win over
</p>
<p>the Roberts wing, which included the abler and more
</p>
<p>energetic members of the F. B. Nor does it seem that
</p>
<p>tiiincf would have been difficult. All that these men had
</p>
<p>done had been advised by Stephens ; and all their success
</p>
<p>in effecting changes in the constitution of the F. B., and
</p>
<p>eventually in deposing O'Mahony, had been achieved only
</p>
<p>because their adherents had been persuaded by them that
</p>
<p>the interests of the I. R. B. and of its Chief Organiser
</p>
<p>demanded these things. Stephens, indeed, was the creator
</p>
<p>of the Roberts wing ; and it would have given itself up to
</p>
<p>him unreservedly on his landing in America, had he taken
</p>
<p>a judicious course. But he gave full swing to his worst
</p>
<p>qualities. He was despotic and jealous ; he hated inde-
</p>
<p>pendent action, and he regarded everyone who ventured
</p>
<p>to act independently as his rival. The conduct of Roberts
</p>
<p>and his colleagues had been very decided and independent
</p>
<p>in many points. Stephens was duly jealous, and attempted
</p>
<p>to reduce them to submission, after the fashion he had
</p>
<p>been accustomed to practise in Ireland, by browbeating
</p>
<p>and overbearing. He could not or would not understand
</p>
<p>that a course which had served very well in a country
</p>
<p>where secrecy was essential to the success of his conspiracy
</p>
<p>would not serve at all in America. Instead of recognising
</p>
<p>the services rendered him by the Roberts wing, and con-
</p>
<p>ciliating its chief, he denounced them and their measures

</p>
<p>without reserve. In a short time the men of action were
</p>
<p>248 The Fenian Consph^acy.
</p>
<p>as openly and bitterly adverse to Stephens as they had
</p>
<p>ever been to O'Mahony.
</p>
<p>The opposite wing had given itself to the C. O. I. R. the
</p>
<p>moment he set foot in America. Its aims were identical
</p>
<p>with his own ; he had nothing to condemn therein but its
</p>
<p>chief and his errors, especially the glaring one culminating
</p>
<p>in the Campo Bello disaster. But. even over this section
</p>
<p>Stephens could retain no permanent sway. The opinion
</p>
<p>of him entertained by Mitchell and O'Mahony was common
</p>
<p>to its abler members. They were overborne, indeed, for a
</p>
<p>while, by popular clamour. But Stephens soon lost his
</p>
<p>hold of the mere mob of the wing, and as he did so all that
</p>
<p>was intellectual and honest therein arrayed itself against
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>One thing, however, Stephens did, and did it well 
</p>
<p>while his popularity lasted  he befooled the rabble to the
</p>
<p>top of its bent. There were meetings of all sorts, in halls
</p>
<p>and in the open air  especially at Jones's Wood. And
</p>
<p>wherever he opened his mouth, it was to describe the I.R.B.
</p>
<p>as flourishing, their plans as infallible, and their success
</p>
<p>certain, if the F, B. would only supply them with inojiey
</p>
<p>to purchase war material. Stephens was supplied with
</p>
<p>money, but he made no attempt to purchase war material.
</p>
<p>Neither did he send any remittances to Ireland, of
</p>
<p>which Duffy, among others, complained bitterly. He
</p>
<p>did not even attempt to repay a sum of ;^i87, which he
</p>
<p>had borrowed from Corydon previous to quitting Ireland.
</p>
<p>Nor does it appear that Corydon ever asked for repay-
</p>
<p>ment, even though he happened to meet the C. E. in

</p>
<p>Anierica about this period. Corydon found a means of
</p>
<p>Stephens in New York, 249
</p>
<p>repaying himself; how much of this was then known
</p>
<p>to James Stephens  how much of the treachery which
</p>
<p>Corydon was then meditating, we shall not pause to guess.
</p>
<p>Stephens, however, made a very manifest use of the
</p>
<p>]^\Miian funds. His habits became more luxurious than
</p>
<p>ever. His expenditure, indeed, was so lavish, as to be
</p>
<p>seriously felt by the F. B. For this he attempted to make
</p>
<p>amends by a promise  which he reiterated at every oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity for the remainder of the year  to take the field in
</p>
<p>Ireland before that year should reach its close. Nothing
</p>
<p>could be more solemn than the form in which he shaped
</p>
<p>those promises  "As surely as I address you to-day, we
</p>
<p>shall take the field in Ireland this very year," were the
</p>
<p>words he used on one of these occasions.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Ivoberts party prepared and precipitated
</p>
<p>\.\\dx fiasco also. They had announced that they would
</p>
<p>enter British territory with not less than ten thousand men.
</p>
<p>At least thrice that number of the F. B. volunteered for
</p>
<p>the service. On the night of the 31st of May, six hundred
</p>
<p>men crossed the Niagara river, not far from Buffalo.
</p>
<p>It was a wretched force in all respects wherewith to
</p>
<p>attempt the conquest of the Canadas. Its equipment
</p>
<p>was even more contemptible than its numbers. There
</p>
<p>was no provision of ammunition, no artillery, no commis-
</p>
<p>sariat, nothing that could be called a military chest, 
</p>
<p>indeed, the last was considered superfluous by all con-
</p>
<p>cerned, as they expected to supply the deficiency in
</p>
<p>Canada, how, we need not pause to speculate.
</p>
<p>The raiders had not even a leader. When the moment

<p>of serious action arrived, the General designated to the
</p>
<p>250 The Fetiian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>command was not to be found, and John O'Neil was
</p>
<p>appointed by his fellows on the spot to the command. He
</p>
<p>was a young man, then thirty-four years of age. An Irish
</p>
<p>immigrant of low grade, he joined the Federal army, fought
</p>
<p>through the war of Secession well and valiantly, and attained
</p>
<p>the rank of lieutenant. He was a soldier neither better nor
</p>
<p>worse than the average of Irish soldiers  a man whom acci-
</p>
<p>dent flung into the position to which he owes notoriety.
</p>
<p>"At 3.30," writes John Savage, "the men and arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition were put on board four canal boats at a point
</p>
<p>called Little Black Rock. They were towed across the
</p>
<p>Niagara river, and landed at Waterloo. At four o'clock
</p>
<p>in the morning the Irish flag was displayed on British
</p>
<p>soil by Colonel Starr, who commanded the two first
</p>
<p>boats. On landing, O'Neil ordered the telegraph wires to
</p>
<p>be cut down, and sent a party to destroy the railway
</p>
<p>bridge leading to Port Colborne. Starr, with the Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky and Indiana contingents, proceeded through the
</p>
<p>town of Erie to the old fort some three miles up the
</p>
<p>river, and occupied it. G Neil then demanded assistance of
</p>
<p>the citizens of Erie, assuring them that no depredations
</p>
<p>would be permitted, and his request zvas cJiccrfnlly complied
</p>
<p>with. At ten o'clock he moved into camp at Newbigging's
</p>
<p>Farm, on Frenchman's Creek, four miles from Fort Erie,
</p>
<p>down the river, and occupied it until ten r.M.
</p>
<p>"Some of his men on a foraging expedition on the
</p>
<p>Chipewa Road had come up with the enemy's scouts, and
</p>
<p>towards night O'Neil received intelligence that a large force
</p>
<p>(said to be 5,000) with artillery, was advancing in two

<p>Stephens in New York. 2 5 \
</p>
<p>Colbornc ; also that troops from the latter were to attack
</p>
<p>him on the Lake side. At this time, owing to straggling^
</p>
<p>and desertion, O'Neil's force was not more than five hundred
</p>
<p>men. The odds were terrible, but the commander was
</p>
<p>schooled to danger. At ten I\M. he broke camp, and
</p>
<p>marched towards Chippewa, and at midnight changed
</p>
<p>direction, and moved on the Lime Stone Ridge Road,,
</p>
<p>leading towards Ridgeway. His object was to meet the
</p>
<p>column crossing from Port Colborne  to get between
</p>
<p>the two columns, and defeat one before the other could
</p>

</p>
<p>"At about seven o'clock in the morning of the 2d of
</p>
<p>June, within three miles of Ridgeway, Colonel Starr, com-
</p>
<p>manding the advance, came up with the advance of the
</p>
<p>enemy mounted. lie drove them within sight of their
</p>
<p>skirmishing line, which extended half a mile on both sides
</p>
<p>of the road. O'Neil immediately advanced his skirmishers,,
</p>
<p>and formed a line of battle behind temporary breastworks
</p>
<p>made of rails, on a road leading to Fort Erie, and parallel
</p>
<p>with the enemy. The skirmishing was briskly kept up
</p>
<p>for half an hour. The enemy was attempting to flank
</p>
<p>O'Neil on both sides, and he failed to draw their centre,,
</p>
<p>which was partially protected by thick timber. In this
</p>
<p>exigency he fell back a few hundred yards, and formed a
</p>
<p>new line. The British, seeing how far the invading troops
</p>
<p>were off, became adventurous ; they supposed O'Neil had
</p>
<p>retreated and advanced to pursue. Now was O'Neil's
</p>
<p>chance, and he did not fail to take it. The British came
</p>
<p>on rapidly after the Irish, who ' retreat * not so rapidly.

<p>for CNeil's purpose. He gives his orders with decision ;
</p>
<p>a volley stops the career of the British ; it is their turn
</p>
<p>to retreat, but they retreat in earnest with the Irish after
</p>
<p>them, in earnest too ; driving them for three miles, and
</p>
<p>through the town of Ridgeway. In their retreat, the
</p>
<p>British threw away knapsacks, guns, and everything likely
</p>
<p>to retard their speed, and left some ten or twelve killed,
</p>
<p>nearly thirty wounded, with twelve prisoners in the hands
</p>
<p>of the Irish. O'Ncil gave up the pursuit one mile beyond
</p>
<p>Kidgeway.
</p>
<p>" Although victorious, O'Neil's position was very criti-
</p>
<p>cal. The reported strength of the enemy he had engaged
</p>
<p>was 1400, embracing the Queen's Own, the Hamilton
</p>
<p>Battalion, and other troops. A regiment from PoVt Col-
</p>
<p>borne was said to be on the road to reinforce them. The
</p>
<p>column from Chippewa would also hear of the fight, and
</p>
<p>move on his rear with all celerity. Thus situated, he
</p>
<p>decided to return to Fort Erie and learn if reinforcements
</p>
<p>for the invading army had been sent across at any other
</p>
<p>points. Seeing after the dead and wounded, he divided
</p>
<p>his command, and sent Starr with one half down the rail-
</p>
<p>road to destroy it and the bridges, and lead the rest on
</p>
<p>the pike road to Fort Erie. They united at the old fort
</p>
<p>at 4 P.M. O'Neil next had a skirmish with the Wellend
</p>
<p>Battery, which had arrived there from Port Colborne in
</p>
<p>the morning, and had picked up some stragglers and de-
</p>
<p>serters. The enemy fired from the houses. Three or
</p>
<p>four men were killed, and twice that number were
</p>
<p>wounded on both sides. Here the Irish captured forty-five

</p>
<p>" Taking precautions against surprisal, O'Neil put himself
</p>
<p>in communication with his friends in Buffalo, stating his
</p>
<p>desperate position. He was willing, if a movement was
</p>
<p>going on elsewhere, to hold out, and, if necessary, make
</p>
<p>the old fort a slauglitcr-pen sooner than surrender. Mis
</p>
<p>men were without food or supplies, and had marched
</p>
<p>forty miles, and had two conflicts. When, therefore, he
</p>
<p>learned that no crossing had been made in his aid, he
</p>
<p>promptly demanded transportation, which was furnished
</p>
<p>about midnight of the 2d of June. They were all on
</p>
<p>board by 2 A.M., and when on American waters, they were
</p>
<p>arrested by the American authorities. So ended the in-
</p>
<p>vasion of Canada."
</p>
<p>Here wc have given the most favourable account 
</p>
<p>the Fenian account  of this affair. We must qualify
</p>
<p>it. Savage would lead his readers to suppose that the
</p>
<p>troops encountered by O'Neil were regular troops of the
</p>
<p>Juiglish army, when in reality they were Canadian volun-
</p>
<p>teers. He overrates their numbers also enormously. In
</p>
<p>the two skirmishes they were fewer than their opponents.
</p>
<p>O'Neil and his men, we allow, behaved fairly ; but the
</p>
<p>whole thing, with its useless bloodshed, was something
</p>
<p>worse than a folly  it was criminal. No honest man
</p>
<p>would have directed such an enterprise  no true soldier
</p>
<p>would have dreamt for a moment of executing it. There
</p>
<p>was not the remotest possibility of even temporary suc-
</p>
<p>cess. These six hundred Fenians crossed the Niagara to
</p>
<p>destroy a little property  their scanty strength would not

<p>allow them to destroy more  and to slay and wound some

</p>
<p>their homes against a band of raiders whom they had
</p>
<p>done nothing whatever to provoke.
</p>
<p>We do not blameO'Neil for "retreating" to the American
</p>
<p>side after his second skirmish, and when he saw something
</p>
<p>more formidable than vohmteers coming up rapidly. The
</p>
<p>said volunteers had not been particularly well handled, but
</p>
<p>they had fought a stubborn fight against veterans ; nor
</p>
<p>liad they been so badly beaten in the first affair as to
</p>
<p>hesitate to assail again. Old soldiers as they were, how-
</p>
<p>ever, it is not to be presumed that the Fenians would have
</p>
<p>stood for an hour against an equal number of British
</p>
<p>soldiers. There everything would have told against them.
</p>
<p>Such soldiers possessed all that they lacked  officers
</p>
<p>whom they were accustomed to respect and obey, arma-
</p>
<p>ment, and all the superiority which moral force can
</p>
<p>confer.
</p>
<p>" O'Ncil was released on his own recognisances, to
</p>
<p>answer the charge of violating the Neutrality Laws," adds
</p>
<p>Savage, " and returned to Tennessee. He said to a
</p>
<p>friend lately that his services to the cause, thus briefly
</p>
<p>recounted, have damaged his fortunes to the amount of at
</p>
<p>least thirty thousand dollars." IIow this could have
</p>
<p>happened Mr Savage has not condescended to explain.
</p>
<p>General O'Neil, according to Mr Savage's showing,
</p>
<p>joined the Federal army as a private soldier  after
</p>
<p>failing as a stationer in a small way. On leaving the
</p>
<p>.army in 1865, "he opened an office" at Nashville  though
</p>
<p>what business was transacted in the office we are not in-
</p>
<p>formed. Mr Savage says, it was "very successful;"

</p>
<p>nevertheless the " General " abandoned it to become a

</p>
<p>Fenian organiser in the same year. He certainly did not
</p>
<p>possess more than a small fraction of those thirty thousand
</p>
<p>dollars on quitting the American service. He was too
</p>
<p>short a time in business to have made even as small a
</p>
<p>fraction thereof in addition. And mere Fenian organisers,
</p>
<p>however grasping, had none of them an opportunity of
</p>
<p>accumulating 30,000 dollars in a single year. General
</p>
<p>O'Neil, it seems to us, was about as truthful as the majo-
</p>
<p>rity of the Brethren, who have attracted public notice.
</p>
<p>While these things were going on, throwing disgrace
</p>
<p>and ridicule on the rival chiefs, and on the conspiracy
</p>
<p>also in the eyes of all but fanatics, Stephens was pursuing
</p>
<p>his own course in his own way. One of his first acts was
</p>
<p>to make arrangements with General Cluseret, to take the
</p>
<p>command of the Irish Revolutionary army, in accordance
</p>
<p>with an agreement which he had entered into at Paris
</p>
<p>with the revolutionary chiefs in that quarter.
</p>
<p>The son of an officer in the French army, Cluseret com-
</p>
<p>menced his career as a subaltern in the same service. He
</p>
<p>won the rank of captain in Africa, and commanded his com-
</p>
<p>pany in the Crimea. But he had two faults which unfitted
</p>
<p>liim for service in' the French army ; he was notoriously
</p>
<p>intemperate and intensely republican ; he was, in conse-
</p>
<p>quence, compelled to resign his commission. Wc next
</p>
<p>find him serving under Garibaldi m 1859-60. There was
</p>
<p>then an interval of peace, during which Cluseret did a
</p>

</p>
<p>which at a later period he denounced so strongly. Tiic

<p>an opportunity for gratifying his military tastes, which he
</p>
<p>256 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>did not neglect. Volunteering his services, he was placed
</p>
<p>on the staff of General Fremont. Here he distinguished
</p>
<p>himself, and was in consequenee raised to the rank of
</p>
<p>brigadier-general in a few months. As to character,
</p>
<p>Cluserct was a clever, clear-sighted man, and a thoroughly-
</p>
<p>trained soldier ; he had no lack of courage, firmness, or
</p>
<p>second-rate military ability ; but his principles were loose
</p>
<p>on most points, and altogether wanting on many. He
</p>
<p>was a mere soldier of fortune, of even a lower type than
</p>
<p>that drawn so admirably by Sir Walter Scott in " Dugald
</p>
<p>Dalgetty," much the same sort of personage, indeed, as
</p>
<p>those condotticri who desolated Italy in the 13th, 14th,.
</p>
<p>and 15th centuries.
</p>
<p>After a few preliminary meetings between Cluserct and
</p>
<p>Kelly  the latter acting as the agent of Stephens  the
</p>
<p>Frenchman and the C. O. I. R. met at last at the house of
</p>
<p>a friend of the former, one Pelletier  heretofore a repre-
</p>
<p>sentative of Lyons in the French Assembly (in 1848), but
</p>
<p>at that time a trader in New York. Pelletier, we need
</p>
<p>hardly remark, was a political refugee. Cluserct being a
</p>
<p>physiognomist, had made a careful study of the photo-
</p>
<p>graph of Stephens, of whom, therefore, he had formed no
</p>
<p>very favourable opinion. We shall let the General tell
</p>
<p>what passed : 
</p>
<p>" He was very clear and very explicit in his explana-
</p>
<p>tions. He was an organiser to the fingers* ends, and in
</p>
<p>this respect he was undoubtedly a man of superior merit ;
</p>
<p>but he was vain, despotic, and overbearing beyond any
</p>
<p>man I ever saw. As regarded action, he was worth

<p>nothing. I left the house much disturbed in my mind.
</p>
<p>Stephens in New York, 257
</p>
<p>Stephens had explained to me, at great length, and in
</p>
<p>much detail, the resources of the Fenian organisation.
</p>
<p>He had given nic a key to his organisation, which did not
</p>
<p>leave out a single man in all Ireland ; everything had
</p>
<p>been scrupulously and carefully visited and organised.
</p>
<p>As far as men were concerned, there no longer seemed
</p>
<p>need that any should be brought over. The whole of
</p>
<p>Ireland was enrolled in the organisation, either actually
</p>
<p>or standing well affected towards it ; and as this was his
</p>
<p>strong point, he was careful to furnish me with the most in-
</p>
<p>dubitable material proofs of the truth of the facts he stated.
</p>
<p>" I was present at the meeting of the various represen-
</p>
<p>tatives of the most important Irish Centres. The report
</p>
<p>Avas made for the whole of Ireland, as is done for a regi-
</p>
<p>ment, each sergeant-major reading the report of his com-
</p>
<p>pany to the colonel. I was really astonished.
</p>
<p>" But," remarked Cluseret, " men were not everything,"
</p>
<p>money and arms were also requisite. Of money they had
</p>
<p>some ; as to armament, the Frenchman confesses, what we
</p>
<p>have already pointed out, that they were miserably defi-
</p>
<p>cient therein. " They tried to dazzle me with representa-
</p>
<p>tions of their further resources," adds Cluseret, which was
</p>
<p>a characteristic proceeding on the part of Stephens and his
</p>
<p>subordinates. Cluseret, however, was not to be deceived ;
</p>
<p>he was determined to search the whole thing to the bot-
</p>
<p>tom, which he succeeded at last in reaching. Then he
</p>
<p>found "that the arms and ammunition existed only in
</p>
<p>imagination, or"  what was much the same  "in the
</p>
<p>arsenals "  of the enemy.

<p>O'Mahony's policy of "war in Ireland only"  and which,
</p>
<p>therefore, acknowledged Stephens as an authority 
</p>
<p>Cluseret found that, deducting the expenses in which
</p>
<p>the cost of the sojourn of Stephens at the Metropolitan
</p>
<p>Hotel, the lesser though still considerable amount spent
</p>
<p>on the maintenance of Headquarters, and the sums neces-

<p>sary to the transport of the numerous envoys between
</p>
<p>the two hemispheres, formed the principal items  the sum
</p>
<p>remaining was altogether insufficient to provide war
</p>
<p>material. As to the weapons and ammunition already
</p>
<p>procured, these had passed into the hands of Roberts and
</p>
<p>his senators, who insisted on making war in America, and'
</p>
<p>who, therefore, would have nothing to do with Stephens
</p>
<p>and his schemes.

<p> interviews at which wine enough to float the " Fenian

</p>
<p>after obtaining all the information he could concerning the
</p>
<p>resources of the I. R. B., and of the English government 
</p>
<p>after calculating all the chances  Cluseret, and with him
</p>
<p>Stephens, came to the conclusion that England could not,,
</p>
<p>"for ninety days," oppose to them more than thirty
</p>
<p>thousand men.

<p>Here we cannot help pausing to remark on the phrase,.

<p>of the Federal States. They were perpetually promising

</p>
<p>to put down the rebellion in that precise time. Every new
</p>
<p>Stephens in New York. 259
</p>
<p>army and every new leader sent into the field was to
</p>
<p>vanquish in "ninety days." And the Fenians had bor-
</p>
<p>rowed the language, as well as the airs, which Messrs
</p>
<p>Seward and Company had rendered ridiculous. " Presi-
</p>
<p>dent " Roberts, when despatching the Ridgeway expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, promised to achieve great things in " ninety days."
</p>
<p>And now, Cluseret and Stephens were adopting the same
</p>
<p>limit for their prospective deeds.
</p>
<p>During this period wherein it was estimated that
</p>
<p>England would not be able to concentrate more than thirty
</p>
<p>thousand men in Ireland, Stephens and Cluseret calculated
</p>
<p>that ten thousand men, resolute and acting on their own soil,
</p>
<p>" would be able to seize upon the most important points
</p>
<p>for embarkation and the principal roads of communica-
</p>
<p>tion." These two lines sum up the system of strategy
</p>
<p>which Cluseret, and after him Kelly, resolved to adopt.
</p>
<p>In addition to seizing the strategical points it was thought
</p>
<p>that these ten thousand men, moving rapidly, would draw
</p>
<p>after them the sympathising multitude, and, with the aid
</p>
<p>of the latter, crush the English army in the field, before
</p>
<p>aid could arrive. Having crushed the army, of course
</p>
<p>there was nothing more to be done. " So," said Cluseret,
</p>
<p>" raise me ten thousand men and I will command them."
</p>
<p>It was his ultimatum. When ten thousand men should be
</p>
<p>raised, he was prepared to lead them. Until then he
</p>
<p>refused to do more than draw up a plan of campaign,
</p>
<p>based on the data we have given. On no other terms
</p>
<p>than these would Cluseret take service with the I. R. B.,
</p>
<p>and on these terms Stephens consented to form an engage-

</p>
<p>ment with him.
</p>
<p>26o The Fenia7i Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>But if Cluseret would not take one single step without
</p>
<p>the following of ten thousand men, he was quite of
</p>
<p>another mind as to emolument. He insisted on re-
</p>
<p>ceiving a large sum to begin with, and to be paid his salary
</p>
<p>from that very day forward, as it should become due.
</p>
<p>With his terms the Chief Organiser complied. To obtain
</p>
<p>the money Stephens sold the Campo Bello steamer, which
</p>
<p>had been returned to the F. B. by the government of
</p>
<p>the United States. Cluseret at once engaged two brother
</p>
<p>adventurers, who, like himself, had served in the Federal
</p>
<p>armies. One of them, Fariola, an Italian officer of
</p>
<p>engineers, who had been educated at Brussels, he named
</p>
<p>his Adjutant-General. The other, Vifquain, a Frenchman,
</p>
<p>was to be his Lieutenant-General.
</p>
<p>As we wish to say as little more of Cluseret as we
</p>
<p>can, we shall here sum up, in a very few words, his after
</p>
<p>career as " Commander-in-Chief of the I. R. B." He
</p>
<p>obtained a commission from the state of New York, to
</p>
<p>visit England, with a view to reporting on the constitution
</p>
<p>of its arsenals, to his employers. With this commission in
</p>
<p>his pocket, Cluseret started for England. Why he took
</p>
<p>this course he has not explained. This, however, we
</p>
<p>can say, that had he played the same game with any
</p>
<p>European government save that of England, he would
</p>
<p>have been arrested and executed as a spy, and deservedly.
</p>
<p>He states that he never once attempted to discharge the
</p>
<p>duties he had undertaken, that he never saw the inside of
</p>
<p>a single English arsenal. How much truth there is in
</p>
<p>this we do not care to enquire ; neither is it necessary.

</p>
<p>Whether he visited the arsenals or not, Cluseret was in
</p>
<p>Stephens in New York, 261
</p>
<p>England under false pretences  about the falsest of pre-
</p>
<p>tences. As to his duties as Fenian Commander-ifi-Chicf,
</p>
<p>he discharged them thus far  he drew up a plan of cam-
</p>
<p>paign ; he accepted his pay, so long as it was forthcoming ;
</p>
<p>he attended various meetings of the chiefs in London ; he
</p>
<p>never once set foot in Ireland ; when urged to take the
</p>
<p>field his response was  " yes, when there are ten thousand
</p>
<p>men in the field for me to lead ; " finally, when the only
</p>
<p>serious attempt at insurrection made by the I. R. B. ended
</p>
<p>in d^ fiasco even more signal than those of Campo Bello and
</p>
<p>Ridgeway, General Cluserct quitted England and all con-
</p>
<p>nection with the I. R. B.
</p>
<p>Why Stephens engaged with Cluseret we have partly
</p>
<p>shown ; he had pledged himself to do so before quitting
</p>
<p>Paris. But, at least as a conspirator, Stephens never did
</p>
<p>anything with a single motive. The C. O. was tired of
</p>
<p>Kelly,  tired of all the American Irish officers ; he wished
</p>
<p>to get rid of them as he had rid himself of O'Donovan
</p>
<p>Rossa, etc. Of Cluseret and his associates, being foreigners,
</p>
<p>he had no jealousy. They were foreigners and could not
</p>
<p>hope to oust him from his place in the heart of the Irish
</p>
<p>nation. Having done the work for which he wanted them,
</p>
<p>he thought it would be easy to retain them in perfect
</p>
<p>subordination, or dismiss them as he might think fit. And
</p>
<p>here another consideration forces itself upon us. We have
</p>
<p>seen Stephens deliberately destroying the conspiracy on
</p>
<p>both sides of the Atlantic, in order to destroy his rivals
</p>
<p>with it. These rivals were destroyed, but the conspiracy
</p>
<p>breathed yet,  breathed strongly, too, under the feverish

<p>impulse which recent events had communicated. Was
</p>
<p>262 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>Stephens deceived by appearances ? Did he hope to re-
</p>
<p>store the conspiracy and carry it on to his own sole advan-
</p>
<p>tage ? It looks like it ; but, if he were thus deceived and
</p>
<p>thus dared to aspire, he was to be soon undeceived and
</p>
<p>bitterly disappointed.
</p>
<p>For the present, however, all went gloriously with
</p>
<p>Stephens. Feeling himself completely superseded in the
</p>
<p>confidence of that part of the Fenian Brotherhood which
</p>
<p>advocated the "war in Ireland" policy by the C. O. I. R.,
</p>
<p>the Head Centre brought himself, or was compelled by
</p>
<p>others, to resign in favour of the former. " My resigna-
</p>
<p>tion," wrote O'Mahony in a letter to the editor of The
</p>
<p>Irish People^ " was not altogether voluntary on my part,
</p>
<p>but I had resolved on that step for some months before it
</p>
<p>actually took place. My principal reasons were because,
</p>
<p>after the ist of January 1866, I could not understand Mr
</p>
<p>Stephens' perseverance in his war programme in Ireland,
</p>
<p>and because I felt that there was no prospect of an tmited
</p>
<p>Fenian Brotherhood in this country (the United States),
</p>
<p>which I believed to be an indispensable requisite to
</p>
<p>success whilst I held my office in it, surrounded and
</p>
<p>undermined as I had been for some time by treacherous
</p>
<p>and wily opponents and personal enemies of all kinds."
</p>
<p>There was a good deal of querulous complaint in this
</p>
<p>letter, which is a crowning proof that no man was less
</p>
<p>fitted than O'Mahony to direct a conspiracy. He was
</p>
<p>weak, irritable, and vacillating ; he allowed his lust of
</p>
<p>power in too many instances to impel him into question-
</p>
<p>able actions and contradictory assertions ; he saw that his

</p>
<p>part was played out ; and yet he persisted in forcing him-
</p>
<p>Stephens in New York, 263
</p>
<p>self into prominence on the stage, until he was absolutely
</p>
<p>kicked off.
</p>
<p>Stephens continued his usual career after his recognition
</p>
<p>by the "war in Ireland" section of the Fenians as Head
</p>
<p>Centre. He spoke at numerous meetings, always declar-
</p>
<p>ing that he would fight in Ireland within the year, and
</p>
<p>always demanding fresh supplies of money, which he still
</p>
<p>obtained, though not so abundantly as O'Mahony had
</p>
<p>obtained it during the latter part of 1864 and the opening
</p>
<p>months of 1865. So lavishly did the brethren then con-
</p>
<p>tribute, that the Head Centre boasted of having sent for
</p>
<p>these months an average of 1000 dollars a day to the agents
</p>
<p>of the I. R. B. How much was contributed by the Fenians
</p>
<p>in America will never be known, but the amount is far
</p>
<p>larger than is suspected. One thing is certain, an amount
</p>
<p>was sent to the agents of the I. R. B. far in excess of
</p>
<p>that acknowledged by these agents.
</p>
<p>By this, however, Roberts and his senators had regained
</p>
<p>some portion of the popularity they had lost by the
</p>
<p>Ridgeway failure. There was no prosecution of O'Neil
</p>
<p>and his men ; moreover the arms which had been taken
</p>
<p>from them by the official of the United States were
</p>
<p>returned. This was recognising the Roberts section
</p>
<p>as the Fenian Brotherhood ; nor were the steps we
</p>
<p>have named the only ones taken in the same direc-
</p>
<p>tion by the same parties. From that time forward,
</p>
<p>Roberts and his section became mere tools in the hands
</p>
<p>of American statesmen, who manipulated them very
</p>
<p>adroitly during the discussion to which the deeds of the

<p>Confederate cruisers gave rise, but only to throw them
</p>
<p>264 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>overboard altogether when they had no further use for
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Favoured as they were by the powers west of the
</p>
<p>Atlantic, Roberts and his followers flourished for a time,
</p>
<p>and diverted large sums from the clutches of Stephens and
</p>
<p>his gang. Of course the old vituperation was continued
</p>
<p>between the rival bands with more than the old bitterness,
</p>
<p>and with the application to individuals of all the old harsh
</p>
<p>epithets,  as " swindler," " pirate," etc., etc.
</p>
<p>On the 28th of October Stephens made his last appear-
</p>
<p>ance in public in New York before a monster meeting at
</p>
<p>Jones's Wood. Here he repeated his old promises and
</p>
<p>his usual exaggerations. " I speak to you now for the last
</p>
<p>time," said he, "before returning to my country. There
</p>
<p>are two thousand men in Ireland as brave as you are, who
</p>
<p>want to fight more than you do. My last words are that
</p>
<p>we shall be fighting on Irish soil before the ist of January,
</p>
<p>and that I shall be there in the midst of my countrymen."
</p>
<p>Great enthusiasm was displayed, the last declaration of
</p>
<p>Stephens being received with acclamation. Cluseret adds
</p>
<p>that there was an enormous amount of whisky-drinking
</p>
<p>also, and that internal rioting was just as abundant. "The
</p>
<p>amount of liquor drunk is inconceivable," is the French-
</p>
<p>man's statement. "What fortunes in liquor then dis-
</p>
<p>appeared down the throats of Irishmen ! "
</p>
<p>News of this being transmitted to Ireland had due
</p>
<p>effect therein. The dupes of the conspiracy became as
</p>
<p>enthusiastic and presumptuous as ever, and the govern-
</p>
<p>ment more than ever vigilant, llie arrests, which had

<p>almost ceased during the summer, were resumed with all
</p>
<p>Stephens in New Yo7'L 265
</p>
<p>the rapidity and to the same startHng extent as a year
</p>
<p>carhcr. In the month of December '66 no less than ninety-
</p>
<p>seven leaders were seized and imprisoned. This decided
</p>
<p>course produced a powerful effect. The great mass of the
</p>
<p>conspirators were awed ; weapons and uniforms were
</p>
<p>again cast away in heaps, or placed in positions where the
</p>
<p>police could not fail to find them ; and the leaders slunk
</p>
<p>out of sight. Up to February 1867 things subsided in
</p>
<p>peacefulness enough in Ireland.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the leaders in New York pushed their pre-
</p>
<p>parations for the outbreak. But as the time drew nigh for
</p>
<p>embarkation, Stephens  he who had been so boastful of
</p>
<p>the powers of his organisation and so lavish of promises to
</p>
<p>fight  began to manifest symptoms of shrinking. This
</p>
<p>was enough to produce his ruin. And here, as we always
</p>
<p>prefer to do when we can, we borrow a passage from one
</p>
<p>connected with the affair, our old acquaintance Cluseret :
</p>
<p> " Stephens, who, as it would seem, had by no means
</p>
<p>deceived himself about his material resources, began to
</p>
<p>blow cold as he had hitherto blown hot. So long as it
</p>
<p>was a matter of going onwards, the American-Irish had
</p>
<p>been tolerably obedient to the despotic requirements of
</p>
<p>their Head Centre ; but the moment they imagined they
</p>
<p>saw symptoms of coldness in him, and as month succeeded
</p>
<p>month, and the end of the year approached, and yet no
</p>
<p>announcement had been made of the campaign, they be-
</p>
<p>came indignant and enraged ; in short they deposed
</p>
<p>Stephens, and his life was even threatened. K(elly), through
</p>
<p>whom I had become acquainted with Stephens, and who

</p>
<p>had been the means of assisting him to make his escape
</p>
<p>266 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>from prison, H(alpen), B(ourke), M'(Cafiferty), C(ondon),
</p>
<p>and several others, were at the head of the movement."
</p>
<p>So far we transcribe Cluseret, who- gives only the initials
</p>
<p>(to which we have supplied the remainder of the names)
</p>
<p>of those who deposed Stephens. Concerning that deposi-
</p>
<p>tion we must be a little more diffuse.
</p>
<p>Stephens saw what was going on, nor could he help
</p>
<p>seeing it. There were few of his colleagues who did not
</p>
<p>treat him with coolness ; most of them went much further.
</p>
<p>He whose word used to be law so recently, was brow-
</p>
<p>beaten and overruled in council, often insulted and as
</p>
<p>often menaced. The last three months of 1866 were
</p>
<p>spent by him in constant apprehension. Early in Novem-
</p>
<p>ber he disappeared suddenly from the hotel where he had
</p>
<p>been living in ostentatious luxury, and betook himself to
</p>
<p>new quarters, 308 Thirteenth Street. His residence here
</p>
<p>was known only to his most intimate friends. So careful
</p>
<p>of his safety was he at this period that pickets were con-
</p>
<p>stantly posted in the streets leading to his hiding-place.
</p>
<p>Even now, however, he could not cast off the sensuality
</p>
<p>that had grown upon him. In Thirteenth Street, where
</p>
<p>he remained until his departure from America, his weekly
</p>
<p>bill for board and lodging was forty-five dollars.
</p>
<p>On the 20th of December '65 a meeting of officers was
</p>
<p>held at New York. The officers above mentioned were
</p>
<p>present with one or two more, among them being a man
</p>
<p>then known as Patrick Condon, but who was afterwards to
</p>
<p>be better known as Godfrey Massey. Formerly an officer
</p>
<p>in the Confederate service, he, while acting as commercial

</p>
<p>traveller to a New Orleans firm, joined the Brotherhood,
</p>
<p>Stephens in New York, 267
</p>
<p>and rapidly attained high place among them. Stephens
</p>
<p>presided at this meeting. High words arose between him
</p>
<p>and the more fiery gentlemen present ; more than one of
</p>
<p>them denounced him there and then as a traitor, and
</p>
<p>M'Cafferty, the fiercest character present, drawing a
</p>
<p>revolver, would have pistolled the Head Centre on the
</p>
<p>spot, had he not been restrained by his cooler friend Kelly.
</p>
<p>Here the last did not act out of love towards Stephens ;
</p>
<p>by this time he had lost all confidence in him ; nay, more,
</p>
<p>hated him as fiercely as M'Cafiferty himself. But he saw
</p>
<p>that Stephens's death would have been, in every sense, a
</p>
<p>catastrophe at the particular time and by that particular
</p>
<p>hand. At a later date, indeed, and under different circum-
</p>
<p>stances, the founder of the Assassination Committee did
</p>
<p>not conceal his opinion that it might become expedient to
</p>
<p>" do away with " (the euphuism for piurder) Stephens.
</p>
<p>The latter heard of the remark, and knew the temper of
</p>
<p>the men he had to deal with ; he took good care never to
</p>
<p>place himself within their reach. The meeting broke up
</p>
<p>in disorder.
</p>
<p>The next evening a second meeting was held by the
</p>
<p>same parties minus Stephens. Here the Head Centre was
</p>
<p>formally deposed as " a rogue, an impostor, and a traitor."

</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.
</p>
<p>EVENTS AFTER THE DErOSITION OF STEPHENS.
</p>
<p>From this time, the 21st of December forward, the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was evidently in desperate case. By far the most
</p>
<p>powerful portion of the American branch  that branch
</p>
<p>which was to have supplied the sinews of war  was devoted
</p>
<p>to purely American projects. As to the Irish branch, it
</p>
<p>had no war material, no military experience, and now no
</p>
<p>head in whom general confidence could be reposed.
</p>
<p>Worse still, the English government, already well ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with the conspiracy in all its ramifications, and
</p>
<p>always kept thoroughly well acquainted with its projects
</p>
<p>by the blatant failures in America, as well as by American
</p>
<p>traitors, had, in September '66, obtained the aid of an
</p>
<p>informer who has had few rivals in his peculiar calling,
</p>
<p>the now notorious Corydon.
</p>
<p>The man has been much abused by Fenian writers,
</p>
<p>according to whom himself and all his relatives were
</p>
<p>persons guilty of all that is infamous. Among those
</p>
<p>writers there is but one exception, John O'Mahony,
</p>
<p>and he gives very different testimony. According to
</p>
<p>him Corydon had done honourable service in the
</p>
<p>Fenian armies, and trusty service to the Fenian Brother-

</p>
<p>hood. For many months, indeed, he was the favourite
</p>
<p>Events after the Deposition of Stephens, 269
</p>
<p>messenger between the chiefs of the conspiracy, and dur-
</p>
<p>ing these months, it is admitted, that he did his work well
</p>
<p>and faithfully. His conduct as an informer shows that he
</p>
<p>was a man of courage, unwavering firmness, plenty of grasp
</p>
<p>of mind, and a good deal of skill and general ability. Wc
</p>
<p>do not mean to justify this person, but we cannot help
</p>
<p>thinking that there was some truth in the assertion which
</p>
<p>he frequently repeated at the state trials, to the effect that
</p>
<p>he turned informer and did his best to break up the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, because he looked upon it as neither more nor
</p>
<p>less than just "a swindle." He took the most effectual
</p>
<p>means, too, for effecting his purpose. Never would he
</p>
<p>denounce little conspirators ; " I wanted to catch the big
</p>
<p>ones," was his remark. Another object with him was to
</p>
<p>.shape his information at the outset so that it should not
</p>
<p>interfere with his future usefulness, by designating him as
</p>
<p>a traitor to the Ih-otherhood, until the conspiracy ceased to
</p>
<p>be formidable. Again, and this we consider a point in his
</p>
<p>favour, he never attempted to deny that he looked for
</p>
<p>large reward. He considered that his services deserved
</p>
<p>such reward ; and so do we. Spies and traitors are neces-
</p>
<p>sities begotten of conspiracy, especially when that con-
</p>
<p>spiracy is no less useless than formidable ; and they de-
</p>
<p>serve their reward. Corydon did great service in frustrat-
</p>
<p>ing the " Chester " project, which we shall have shortly to
</p>
<p>notice, service of such importance that it has not yet been
</p>
<p>appreciated, because it has not yet been understood. This
</p>
<p>man supplied the British government with exactly what it
</p>
<p>wanted. He knew every one of the more dangerous con-

</p>
<p>spirators ; he was deep in their confidence ; he was ac-
</p>
<p>270 The Fenia7t Co7isph^acy,
</p>
<p>quainted with all details ; he was the one thing required
</p>
<p>by the British government to render the final attempts of
</p>
<p>the conspirators' failures as miserable and complete as had
</p>
<p>been all their earlier attempts.
</p>
<p>Such being the state of the case  the fate of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy being predetermined beyond recall  it is unneces-
</p>
<p>sary to dwell upon its story with that fulness which we
</p>
<p>have given to its earlier stages.
</p>
<p>Having despatched Massey the day before with ;^25o 
</p>
<p>the utmost sum they could spare to Ireland  the three
</p>
<p>military chiefs, Kelly, Cluseret, and Vifquan, sailed on
</p>
<p>the nth of January for Paris. They arrived in Europe
</p>
<p>hardly in time. M'Caffcrty and others had preceded
</p>
<p>them; and these hot-headed men, finding the other
</p>
<p>American Irish officers who had not left Europe much
</p>
<p>discontented with recent management, set to work and
</p>
<p>formed a Directory which at once took command of the
</p>
<p>I. R. B. These men were eager for action, and indeed
</p>
<p>were then taking measures for an immediate outbreak,
</p>
<p>whose principal scene was to be in England. Kelly, Clu-
</p>
<p>seret, and Fariolo, were after some difficulty admitted
</p>
<p>members of the Directory. The existence of this Direc-
</p>
<p>tory was of course at once made known to the I. R. B. at
</p>
<p>large, but no more than its existence. Who its members
</p>
<p>were, was a secret confided to very few. Still the Direc-
</p>
<p>tory commanded unlimited obedience.
</p>
<p>Immediately after the arrival of, the three, a plan
</p>
<p>was determined upon. It is one which was known in
</p>
<p>its fulness only to its projectors, by whom it has been

<p>much misrepresented. It happened that at this time
</p>
<p>Events after the Deposition of Stephens, 271
</p>
<p> ^January '6^  there was a large quantity of arms
</p>
<p>stored in Chester Castle, which was very scantily garri-
</p>
<p>soned, and rather carelessly watched. The Directory pro-
</p>
<p>jected to seize these weapons by concentrating some
</p>
<p>thousands of Fenians from various northern counties in
</p>
<p>the city. Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, all the large
</p>
<p>manufacturing towns, were to supply contingents who
</p>
<p>were to travel by rail. Thus, while the numbers conveyed
</p>
<p>by any one line would be too small to attract observation
</p>
<p>and excite suspicion, the whole number, when united in
</p>
<p>Chester, would be formidable enough. These men were
</p>
<p>provided with revolvers and ammunition. A forlorn hope
</p>
<p>of thirty was to enter the castle as visitors and seize the
</p>
<p>gate, mastering, of course, the guard on duty, which it was
</p>
<p>anticipated would be an easy task. Then the masses
</p>
<p>behind were to be admitted, and, overpowering the re-
</p>
<p>mainder of the garrison, possess themselves of the arms.
</p>
<p>It was a clever plan, and, had the secret been kept,
</p>
<p>we think it would have succeeded. History abounds-
</p>
<p>with narratives of attempts at surprise as daring, and much
</p>
<p>more daring, the vast majority of which were entirely
</p>
<p>successful.
</p>
<p>Having won Chester Castle, the I. R. 13. were to " Carry
</p>
<p>off the arms," as say the leaders, "seize the first train to
</p>
<p>Holyhead  having first cut the telegraph wires and broken
</p>
<p>up the railways behind and, arriving at Holyhead, seize
</p>
<p>one or more stcamiers, cross to Dublin, commence the
</p>
<p>rising in Ireland."
</p>
<p>But the plan, as revealed by the leaders, was not the

</p>
<p>whole plan. There was something behind which was not
</p>
<p>272 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>revealed. Had success attended the Chester enterprise,
</p>
<p>Dublin was only one of the objects in view. A portion
</p>
<p>of the mass accumulated in Chester was to be sent off to
</p>
<p>London, other portions were to be despatched to other
</p>
<p>great towns in all parts of the country. Their arrival at
</p>
<p>each destination was to be the signal for an outbreak
</p>
<p>therein. Then these cities were to be given over to the
</p>
<p>tender mercies of the lowest of the mob. It was not ex-
</p>
<p>pected that they could be held for any length of time.
</p>
<p>But, in the first place, it would be an act of vengeance on
</p>
<p>England which would be grateful to the I. R. B ; and, in
</p>
<p>the second place, it would create consternation in England,
</p>
<p>and cause the concentration of her strength at home.-
</p>
<p>Thus Ireland would be denuded of soldiers, and the suc-
</p>
<p>cess of insurrection therein rendered certain. Such was
</p>
<p>the full plan ; a most formidable one it will be seen 
</p>
<p>very terrible as to Ireland, but infinitely more terrible
</p>
<p>with regard to England  for those who know the Irish
</p>
<p>mob of our great cities as we know them, cannot but feel
</p>
<p>that a sudden outbreak on their part, under such circum-
</p>
<p>stances as those of February '6jy would have been followed
</p>
<p>by appalling events. The threat in Kelly's letter will
</p>
<p>be remembered.
</p>
<p>So far as the directors were concerned, there was no
</p>
<p>failure. The contingents designated were duly sent from
</p>
<p>their respective localities, all duly provided. They reached
</p>
<p>Chester according to arrangement. The leaders, of whom
</p>
<p>M'Cafiferty and Halpen were the principal, were there to
</p>
<p>meet them. So far all had gone well for them ; but when

<p>they proceeded to effect the rest of their purpose, it was

<p>found that the Castle had been stripped of its weapons

<p>some days before, and that the garrison were on the alert.
</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to send back the men to
</p>
<p>their homes, which was done. Thus the great Chester
</p>
<p>plot, from which so much was anticipated, when it came
</p>
<p>to be realised, took the appearance of a hoax. It was
</p>
<p>more ridiculous than O'Neil's campaign at Ridgeway.
</p>
<p>The Chester plot failed, because Corydon had obtained
</p>
<p>information, not complete, but still sufficient for his
</p>
<p>purpose, and communicated that information to the
</p>
<p>British Government, which took the necessary precau-
</p>
<p>tions. Considering the good service he did England
</p>
<p>In this instance, who will assert that the informer over-
</p>
<p>rated his claim for reward t Had the Chester plot suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded, who can calculate the loss that would have
</p>
<p>followed to England .'*
</p>
<p>The Government might have captured the directors, or
</p>
<p>the greater portion of them, at this period, had it
</p>
<p>thought fit to do so. Their persons and their hiding places
</p>
<p> which were not hiding places, since they were situated
</p>
<p>in the centre of London  were all well known. But it
</p>
<p>would not have been good policy to do so. Experience
</p>
<p>had shown that the arrest of the chiefs would not now
</p>
<p>check the conspiracy ; it had grown too large for that.
</p>
<p>Obviously it would be better to leave them at large ; to
</p>
<p>let them proceed to action ; and then to crush them and
</p>
<p>the conspiracy at once and for ever. One of the direc-
</p>
<p>tors, however, was a man too dangerous to be dealt with
</p>
<p>in this way ; it was M'Cafferty. On the 23d of February,
</p>

</p>
<p>2 74 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>was arrested in Dublin just as he stepped out of a White-
</p>
<p>haven coHier. He was tried in the following May, found
</p>
<p>guilty on every count, by an Irish jury  almost the inva-
</p>
<p>riable fate of those ultra- Irish conspirators  and sen-
</p>
<p>tenced to death  a sentence which shows the estimation
</p>
<p>in which he was held by enemies, as well as friends. It
</p>
<p>is needless to say that the sentence was never intended to
</p>
<p>be executed. It was commuted to penal servitude for
</p>
<p>life  a commutation which was further commuted for re-
</p>
<p>lease in 1 87 1. For four years, then, this desperate man,,
</p>
<p>who had been trained in a desperate school  he had
</p>
<p>been one of Morgan's guerrillas  was to be a prisoner.
</p>
<p>The Chester attempt was frustrated, thanks to Corydon;
</p>
<p>whose part in the affair was yet unknown, but nothing
</p>
<p>else. The Government had given no indication of know-
</p>
<p>ledge of the projected rising in Ireland, and preparations
</p>
<p>for that rising went on as if nothing had happened. It was
</p>
<p>looked forward to with eager enthusiasm by the I. R. B.^
</p>
<p>and not the less so, since it was countenanced by Stephens.
</p>
<p>Here it is time to say a word of the deposed Head
</p>
<p>Centre  the last we shall have occasion to say of him for
</p>
<p>many a day. His deposition had been communicated to
</p>
<p>him immediately; but this he regarded as a thing of small
</p>
<p>consequence, a mere temporary affair which would soon
</p>
<p>be forgotten, and which could not affect his standing in
</p>
<p>Ireland. He was the more disposed to think so, since
</p>
<p>Kelly, the unquestionable leader of the Irish Americans,,
</p>
<p>still spoke him fair. Kelly even sent Stephens a ticket
</p>
<p>for passage by the same steamer as himself for Kelly

</p>
<p>Events after the Deposition of Stephens, 275
</p>
<p>ticket, by design on the part of the sender, reached
</p>
<p>Stephens too late ; others, with at least as much probabi-
</p>
<p>lity, assert that the Head Centre designedly neglected to
</p>
<p>avail himself of it. As it happened he did not sail with
</p>
<p>Kelly, but a few days later, for the same destination,
</p>
<p>France  with the purpose of fixing himself in Paris. Pre-
</p>
<p>vious to his own departure, he hurried a devoted member
</p>
<p>of the I. R. B. by steamer to Ireland, with the last
</p>
<p>despatch which he ever wrote to his dupes. It was
</p>
<p>couched in fiery language, abounded in hatred to Eng-
</p>
<p>land, and wound up by proclaiming immediate war 
</p>
<p>" war to the knife with the tyrants." " Should Kelly
</p>
<p>arrive before me," wrote Stephens, " and call on the men
</p>
<p>of Ireland to rise, let them as one man, and make war to
</p>
<p>the knife. I will be with them, for I will go by the
</p>
<p>next steamer." This despatch was directed to the
</p>
<p>Cork Centre  was duly received, and had much to
</p>
<p>do with what followed. The Chester failure had shaken
</p>
<p>the confidence of the Munster men in the Directory;
</p>
<p>and as those who fail are always in the wrong, their
</p>
<p>conduct to Stephens, which however was not known to
</p>
<p>the full extent, but some inkling of which had got out
</p>
<p>among the I. R. B., was much blamed. Blame in such a
</p>
<p>case was but the prelude to disobedience, which again
</p>
<p>would very certainly lead to assertion of independence.
</p>
<p>Such consequences, however, were prevented by this
</p>
<p>despatch. It seemed to show that the Directors were
</p>
<p>acting in unison with Stephens, and men were content
</p>
<p>to follow the Directors a little longer. As to Stephens,
</p>
<p>he never quitted Paris for years, and exercised no further

<p>CHAPTER IX.
</p>
<p>THE RISING OF THE 5TH OF MARCH.
</p>
<p>The rising had originally been fixed for the nth of
</p>
<p>February, but the Chester failure had changed all that.
</p>
<p>By some means or other, not necessary to investigate,
</p>
<p>the leaders had managed to transmit information of the
</p>
<p>change of date to the 5th of March, to most quarters. A
</p>
<p>few country districts, however, had not been warned,
</p>
<p>and here some paltry attempts at insurrection were made.
</p>
<p>Down in Kerry a coastguard station was surprised and a
</p>
<p>single policeman wounded. This unfortunate was rather
</p>
<p>strangely treated. Several shots were fired into his body
</p>
<p>after he had been brought down ; and then, by a singular
</p>
<p>revulsion of feeling, his assailants raised him carefully,
</p>
<p>with expressions of sorrow, bore him lo a neighbouring
</p>
<p>hovel, and left him with the promise to send him a priest
</p>
<p>and a doctor  a promise which was faithfully executed.
</p>
<p>This was the amount of mischief done and of success
</p>
<p>attained in Ireland on the nth of February 1867.
</p>
<p>For the rising itself there could have been but small
</p>
<p>hope of success in the breasts of even the most sanguine
</p>
<p>leaders. In anticipation thereof Massey, one of the fore-
</p>
<p>most leaders, had been despatched to Ireland by the

<p>Directors, then sitting in London ; the principal scene of
</p>
<p>The Rising of the ^th of March, 277
</p>
<p>meeting being the lodgings of Kelly in Clunes Street  to
</p>
<p>investigate the state of affairs. His report concern-
</p>
<p>ing the two principal centres of conspiracy  the two in
</p>
<p>which by far the most activity had been displayed and
</p>
<p>the greatest enthusiasm excited  Dublin and Cork  will
</p>
<p>show how exceedingly ill prepared were the I. R. B. for
</p>
<p>war. Massey stated that in Dublin there were 15,000
</p>
<p>effective men and in Cork 1 8,000. But to arm these
</p>
<p>bodies there were only 1500 pikes in Dublin, and about
</p>
<p>double the number in the capital of the south. As to
</p>
<p>rifles, bayonets, pistols, equipments, etc.  the amount was
</p>
<p>trifling, while there was absolutely no artillery  with the
</p>
<p>exception of a few wooden models, such as the one after-
</p>
<p>wards dug up in a field near Middlcton, county Cork.
</p>
<p>Massey accomplished his mission by the 24th of Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary, when he returned to London to report, and to
</p>
<p>receive fresh funds and final instructions from Kelly.
</p>
<p>Massey, we may observe, was the man whose duty it was
</p>
<p>to " mobilise " the army of the Irish Republic ; and he,
</p>
<p>the incipient informer, had actually been appointed com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-chief until Cluseret could be persuaded to take
</p>
<p>the post. As to the Frenchman he resolutely persisted in
</p>
<p>taking no step whatever until the ten thousand men he
</p>
<p>specified should be in the field. In vain Kelly  who con-
</p>
<p>fessed that he was not sanguine of success  pressed him
</p>
<p>to lower his standard, and move with five thousand men ;
</p>
<p>Cluseret was not to be persuaded. Cluseret's two com-
</p>
<p>panions were not quite of the same mind. One of them,
</p>
<p>Fariola, told him that he was determined to see the affair

</p>
<p>to the end. But he did not tell him what, however, Clu-
</p>
<p>278 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>scret soon learnt from other quarters,  that he (Fariola)
</p>
<p>was himself intriguing to oust Massey from his post.
</p>
<p>I quote here from Eraser's Magazine  which printed a
</p>
<p>remarkable paper on the subject by Cluseret in 1874, and
</p>
<p>which has never been controverted 
</p>
<p>" During all this time," writes Cluseret  the period
</p>
<p>between the 20th of January and the 24th of February  "I
</p>
<p>had both thought and enquired a great deal in London,
</p>
<p>especially from Mazzini, one of my most faithful friends,
</p>
<p>although we were not of the same mind on the social
</p>
<p>question, Ledru-Rollin, Bradlaugh, Karl Blind, and others.
</p>
<p>By Mazzini I was introduced to P., F. & C, and many
</p>
<p>other influential members of the Reform League.* I saw
</p>
<p>at once that I was upon the wrong tack, and that the
</p>
<p>Irish question could only be settled by English co-
</p>
<p>operation.
</p>
<p>" I met with sympathy as warm with Ireland and her
</p>
<p>federal enfranchisement amongst old Chartists to whom
</p>
<p>I had brought letters of introduction, as I did amongst
</p>
<p>the members of the Reform League. I had even a
</p>
<p>nocturnal interview with members of the Executive Com-
</p>
<p>mittee, in the course of which I was assured that, if the
</p>
<p>Irish desired to join hand in hand with them, they would
</p>
<p>certainly be welcome, and that they would make a plat-
</p>
<p>form which should be acceptable to both parties. I com-
</p>
<p>municated these proposals to the most influential members
</p>
<p>of the Provisional Fenian Government. The most intelli-
</p>
<p>gent amongst them were of opinion that it would be well to

<p>come to an understanding; others, the more narrow-
</p>
<p>minded, would listen to nothing except the " Irish Centres."
</p>
<p>I was cut short, and, taking with me these men, the most
</p>
<p>influential, as well as belonging to the highest class in the
</p>
<p>Fenian hierarchy, I repaired with them to the house of
</p>
<p>one of the most important members of the Committee of
</p>
<p>the Reform League, and there the basis of an agreement
</p>
<p>betwcci Fenian ism and the Reform League was agreed
</p>
<p>upon.
</p>
<p>" It vas at the close of these negotiations that the
</p>
<p>meeting in Trafalgar Square took place, and certainly, if
</p>
<p>the polic; and army had chosen to oppose it, I can assure
</p>
<p>them that on that day all the Fenians in London, who arc
</p>
<p>many, wculd have withstood them like one man, and a
</p>
<p>good maiy resolute Englishmen would have aided them.
</p>
<p>Governnrnt was well advised to let them alone and take

<p>tion."

<p>Massey \Aas apprised that the night of Shrove Tuesday
</p>
<p>had been determined upon for the momentous outbreak.
</p>
<p>According to the principles of Cluseret, the insurgents
</p>
<p>were to mister at the strategical points in order to prevent
</p>
<p>the conceitration of troops. Here they were to mass as
</p>
<p>strongly is possible, collect provisions, and throw up
</p>
<p>defences. Meanwhile other bodies  in no case to number
</p>
<p>more thai five hundred  were to scour the country, each,
</p>
<p>however, :onfining itself to its own district. The move-
</p>
<p>ments of these flying columns were to be based partly on

</p>
<p>partly on the strategical points. They were to hold to.
</p>
<p>the one for defensive purpose, to the other in order to give
</p>
<p>'iem' aid and also to receive supplies. Their warfare was
</p>
<p>to be in a great measure that of guerrillas. In all quarters
</p>
<p>their positions and districts were assigned so as to flank
</p>
<p>the great roads, and thus to render the movement of the
</p>
<p>English columns difficult and dangerous. The plan was a
</p>
<p>shrewd one. It shows that Cluseret understood his trade,,
</p>
<p>and had studied the physical geography of the cointry to
</p>
<p>some purpose. These detached mountain systims  in
</p>
<p>Antrim, Donegal, Connaught, Kerry, Cork, and Wcklow 
</p>
<p>with the great central depression and the lateral valleys
</p>
<p>branching out therefrom, as the fingers branch )ut from
</p>
<p>the palm when the hand is extended, have deternined the
</p>
<p>whole history of the country. In the earlier ^es they
</p>
<p>divided it as certainly into separate states, as if thtse states
</p>
<p>had been fixed in so many islands. The plutardiy found
</p>
<p>existing in Ireland at the period of the conquest was the
</p>
<p>natural result of its conformation. So also was the con-
</p>
<p>quest. A powerful invader seizing Dublin, the outlet of
</p>
<p>the central plain, and occupying that plain itelf, could
</p>
<p>not fail to split up the Irish race into fragments,and over-
</p>
<p>whelm it in detail. And while the invader held the
</p>
<p>central plain and its outlet, all rebellion must bedetached
</p>
<p>and futile. It was precisely what happened. Cluseret
</p>
<p>planned a war of posts. His only hope lay in polonging
</p>
<p>rebellion until some foreign power should ntervcne.
</p>
<p>England, powerful as she was, and holding tie central
</p>
<p>position, could keep the rebellion in check everywhere,

</p>
<p>in succession, and thus crush it out. How this plan was
</p>
<p>carried out we shall soon see.
</p>
<p>Before we speak of what occurred it will be as well to
</p>
<p>mention some of the leaders, with the districts to which,
</p>
<p>they were assigned. Massey was to mobilise the army
</p>
<p>along with Fariola ; " General " Halpen, alias " Thomas," *
</p>
<p>along with a deserter from an English cavalry regiment,,
</p>
<p>one Lennon, was to command in Dublin ; in Tipperary 
</p>
<p>the fighting county />ar excellence  one of the best of the
</p>
<p>American Irish officers was to command ; " Captain '*
</p>
<p>John Edward Kelly,  a printer, like his namesake, and 
</p>
<p>the man whose accidental death in London, in 1869, when
</p>
<p>he was known as " Farrel," caused so much excitement
</p>
<p>among the I. R. B. and so much speculation as to his
</p>
<p>identity with the public in general,  this Kelly was to
</p>
<p>lead " the forlorn hope " in Cork. With him were con-
</p>
<p>joined Captain M'Clure, another Irish American, and
</p>
<p>Peter Crowby. One Colonel Leonard was to lead in
</p>
<p>Drogheda; Colonel Ricard Burke was posted at Macroone ;
</p>
<p>Captain Mackay was to head the rising in that part of Cork
</p>
<p>which surrounds Bally Knockan, etc.
</p>
<p>"On the evening of the day on which M(assey) and
</p>
<p>F(ariola) ought to have commenced their campaign,"
</p>
<p>writes Cluseret, "I chanced to meet the former about
</p>
<p>eleven o'clock at night, completely drunk, and smoking-
</p>
<p>expensive cigars and making a display of his money." As
</p>
<p>Massey was on that critical night, so was many another
</p>
<p>" Fenian Hero " leader. Such were the men who were to
</p>
<p>revolutionise Ireland ! " I went immediately to" rouse up

</p>
<p>;all means to have M(assey) put into safe keeping, and to
</p>
<p>deprive him both of authority and money. Unfortunately
</p>
<p>I was too late; I could not find K(elly)." The last Head
</p>
<p>Centre for Ireland  such was now the position of Kelly 
</p>
<p>was absent for a very good reason,  he was himself pretly
</p>
<p>much in the condition of Massey.
</p>
<p>Such being the conduct of the chiefs on the eve of an
</p>
<p>insurrection, otherwise promising very little, Cluseret saw
</p>
<p>that it was quite time to break off all connection with it.
</p>
<p>He therefore started at once for France. Kelly remained
</p>
<p>in London.
</p>
<p>The leaders of the rising congregated at a public house
</p>
<p>near Beggars Bush Barrack, Dublin, on the 2d of March.
</p>
<p>The place was kept by a man named Brady. Corydon
</p>
<p>was one of those present. Here final arrangements were
</p>
<p>made, while the informer drank in every word and trea-
</p>
<p>sured them carefully in his memory, to repeat them before
</p>
<p>many hours were over to the authorities. Due precautions
</p>
<p>were taken by the latter. On the night of the fourth,
</p>
<p>Massey was arrested at Limerick junction when he was on
</p>
<p>the point of assuming command in probably the most
</p>
<p>important centre of rebellion. Vifquan, another leader,
</p>
<p>appointed to a command hardly inferior in importance,
</p>
<p>that of Connaught, did not appear at all. Several other
</p>
<p>prominent chiefs, among them Fariola, were arrested, like
</p>
<p>Massey, at the critical moment. In consequence, great
</p>
<p>numbers of the I. R. B., finding nobody to lead them,
</p>
<p>broke up without a blow; Connaught did not move at all ;
</p>
<p>in short, the whole plan was dislocated. The little fighting

<p>that took place was of no consequence and soon ceased.
</p>
<p>The Rising of the ^th of March. 283
</p>
<p>We arc shown how desperate were the circumstances
</p>
<p>under which this rcbelHon was undertaken, in a letter
</p>
<p>penned shortly afterwards by one of the Munster chiefs.
</p>
<p>He was writing in vindication of his character, for after the
</p>
<p>failure everybody distrusted his neighbour, and many were
</p>
<p>stigmatised as traitors without the smallest cause.
</p>
<p>" I. myself was expected to be in two places at the same
</p>
<p>time. While I was looked for in one quarter, I was actu-
</p>
<p>ally two miles off in another, committing a felony on a
</p>
<p>trade society that my very traducers might have means of
</p>
<p>subsistence, and therefore have no pretence for plundering
</p>
<p>during the anticipated march to Limerick Junction. I
</p>
<p>and my companions were on the road when we were met
</p>
<p>by an aide-de-camp from the chief, and ordered to fall back.
</p>
<p>He had received information of the arrest of Massey, and
</p>
<p>suspected treachery. I myself ran much greater risk from
</p>
<p>friends than foes. I was denounced as an informer.
</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards my wife overhearing a conversation
</p>
<p>respecting me, we took refuge in Liverpool Workhouse, as
</p>
<p>a precautionary measure."
</p>
<p>The outbreak was arrested in like manner in many other
</p>
<p>quarters. Like the writer of the foregoing letter, most of
</p>
<p>the local chiefs fled to England as the safest refuge.
</p>
<p>The insurgents were completely disappointed in their
</p>
<p>principal trust, the promised disaffection of the soldiery.
</p>
<p>Not a man quitted his colours. This was owing to the
</p>
<p>facts  that the majority of the disaffected had deserted
</p>
<p>already, and that the regimental centres had all been

<p>never came into serious collision. The constabulary did
</p>
<p>284 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>all the fighting, and for the most part did it well, although
</p>
<p>they fought in every case one against a hundred. The
</p>
<p>I. R. B. were not cowards ; they were simply unarmed, or
</p>
<p>nearly so, and reposed just as little confidence in their
</p>
<p>leaders as the latter deserved.
</p>
<p>In the Dublin districts three police barracks were
</p>
<p>attacked. None of them held a strong garrison. Two
</p>
<p>them were captured, one of them by a manoeuvre which
</p>
<p>deserves all reprobation. Having captured the first
</p>
<p>Step-aside Police Station after a short defence, the insur-
</p>
<p>gents marched on to Glencullcn. Here the police were
</p>
<p>more stubborn, manifested an intention of resisting to
</p>
<p>the last, inflicted some loss on the rebels, and were evi-
</p>
<p>dently prepared to inflict more, when they were apprised
</p>
<p>that the prisoners taken at Step-aside wjould be placed in
</p>
<p>front of the assault should they persist in making further
</p>
<p>fire.
</p>
<p>It is but justice to the commander, Lennox, to state
</p>
<p>that he opposed the proposal with all his authority. That
</p>
<p>however, was small. Halpen did the same, and very
</p>
<p>narrowly escaped slaughter for his temerity. The rank
</p>
<p>and file were determined to have their own way. This pro-
</p>
<p>duced the surrender of Glcncullen. At Tallaght, another
</p>
<p>police station, the results were simply disastrous to the
</p>
<p>insurgents. The police resisted stoutly, until another
</p>
<p>body of police coming up placed the rebels between two
</p>
<p>fires, whereupon the latter ran, to fall  or such of them as
</p>
<p>were worth capture  into the hands of the military, who
</p>
<p>had left Dublin some short time before for the scene of

<p>action. In fact, the soldiers in this quarter had nothing
</p>
<p>The Rising of the "^th of March, 285
</p>
<p>to do but make prisoners, of whom they secured two
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty.
</p>
<p>Everywhere else events were much the same. There were
</p>
<p>attacks on police patrols and police barracks, which led to
</p>
<p>nothing save the loss of life, and the defeat, immediate or
</p>
<p>nearly so, of the rebels.
</p>
<p>At Middlcton, in Cork, a body of the I. R. B. meeting
</p>
<p>a police patrol, slew one of the number. Its next pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding was to attack a police barrack, from whence it
</p>
<p>was soon driven with the loss of its leader. At Bally-
</p>
<p>knocken, five policemen were captured, but only when the
</p>
<p>roof was set on fire above them. At Ardagh, in Limerick,
</p>
<p>the assailants met with a valiant resistance and were
</p>
<p>thoroughly well beaten. The rebels met with the like
</p>
<p>fortune at Kilfeach, in Tipperary ; at Emly and Gurtover,
</p>
<p>in the same county ; and at Kilbalin in Kerry.
</p>
<p>The most remarkable of these affairs, between insurgents
</p>
<p>and policemen defending their barracks, took place at
</p>
<p>Kilmallock. There were fourteen men within and half as
</p>
<p>many hundreds without. It was a repetition of the affair
</p>
<p>at Tallaght, except as to its length ; here the fight went
</p>
<p>on for three hours. Then eleven other policemen coming
</p>
<p>up in relief, sent a volley into the mob, which, totally
</p>
<p>unprepared for such an attack, was thrown into confusion.
</p>
<p>Seeing this, the policemen within the barracks and those
</p>
<p>without lowered their- bayonets simultaneously, dashed
</p>
<p>at the mob, and drove the whole mass in headlong flight
</p>
<p>before them.
</p>
<p>In the open but one affair worth notice took place

<p>that at Kilcloney Wood. Here a number of men, including
</p>
<p>286 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>many of the fugitives from the assaults on Kihnallock^
</p>
<p>etc., had taken refuge. A flying column being directed
</p>
<p>upon them from Waterford, the wood was surrounded and
</p>
<p>penetrated. The rank and file of the rebels were allowed
</p>
<p>to filter through the cordon, the leaders only  M'Clure,
</p>
<p>Kelly, and Crowley  were wanted. The three were found
</p>
<p>cowering in the centre of a thicket. Dashing away in
</p>
<p>flight, M'Clure was pursued and captured by a, 'civilian,
</p>
<p>Mr Redmond, a local magistrate, who had some difficulty
</p>
<p>in saving his prisoner from the bayonets of the military.
</p>
<p>The latter were exasperated by the stigma which had
</p>
<p>been cast upon the service by the conduct of certain com-
</p>
<p>rades, and by the insolent vaunts made of their treasonable
</p>
<p>inclinations by the I. R. B. It was well for the latter that
</p>
<p>they had much more to do with the police than with the
</p>
<p>military. Kelly, who was discovered crouching in a ditch,
</p>
<p>surrendered on being summoned to do so. Crowley, out-
</p>
<p>pacing both his companions, had reached a stream, and
</p>
<p>was in the act of leaping across, with his back to the foe
</p>
<p>of course, when several bullets struck him and he fell,
</p>
<p>mortally wounded, into the river. He was drawn to the
</p>
<p>bank. All that could be done for him was done by his
</p>
<p>captors, during the short time he survived. Such was
</p>
<p>the affair of Kilcloney Wood, of which so much has
</p>
<p>been said and sung by the I. R. B.
</p>
<p>The Irish Rebellion of the 5th of March 1867 was even
</p>
<p>a greater Y QVAs^n fiasco than any that had preceded it.
</p>
<p>Its immediate results were a multitude of state trials,
</p>
<p>169 prisoners, selected from those made on and after the

</p>
<p>The Rising of the 5 ///- of March. 287
</p>
<p>52 were found guilty, only 7 were acquitted. It was the-
</p>
<p>usual end of such trials  the one striking feature of this
</p>
<p>conspiracy, which boasted of having all Ireland with it.
</p>
<p>Of the 169 about one half were punished with im-
</p>
<p>prisonment or penal servitude  punishment subsequently
</p>
<p>remitted in most cases.
</p>
<p>In America the Irish Rising was awaited with deep-
</p>
<p>interest and extravagant hope. The latter was converted
</p>
<p>into deepest depression when the news of the event arrived..
</p>
<p>Nevertheless this was the moment selected by the O'Ma-
</p>
<p>hony wing, now under the command of" General Gleeson'^
</p>
<p> the man whose conduct while in the Federal army had
</p>
<p>attracted the attention of the House of Commons  ta
</p>
<p>perpetrate its last fiasco. Gleeson's wing purchased a
</p>
<p>small vessel, variously known as the " Jacknel " and the
</p>
<p>" Erin's Hope," of only 115 tons burthen, placed on board
</p>
<p>a quantity of rifles and 115 adventurers, and sent it to sea
</p>
<p>on the 1 2th of April. After a good deal of ainlless cruising,
</p>
<p>which at one period led them so far south as the West
</p>
<p>Indies, the voyagers sighted Ireland on the 2 1st of May.
</p>
<p>They anchored in the Bay of Sligo two days later. The
</p>
<p>Directory, sitting in London, forewarned of the expedition,
</p>
<p>had deputed one of its members, Ricard Burke, to meet
</p>
<p>this vessel on the west coast of Ireland. Establishing his
</p>
<p>head-quarters in Sligo, Burke hired a fishing-boat, and
</p>
<p>spent many days in cruising in vain in search of the "Jack-
</p>
<p>nel." He was absent on one of these excursions when the
</p>
<p>brig arrived. Instead of awaiting his return, those in the
</p>
<p>" Jacknel" set off in search of him ; thus 'more time was.

<p>lost. It was not until the twenty-fifth that the boat and
</p>
<p>288 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>the brig met. Burke had a long interview with the adven-
</p>
<p>turers, two of. whom, "Colonels" Warren and Nagle, he
</p>
<p>took with him to Sligo. The " Jacknel" then shaped her
</p>
<p>course for Dungarvon, but there was nobody there to
</p>
<p>receive her. By this time the party on board were weary
</p>
<p>of their trip, which seemed to have neither aim nor end,
</p>
<p>and grew mutinous. Three of them insisted on landing,
</p>
<p>and were captured the very same day. The rest remained
</p>
<p>in the vessel, which returned with all speed to New York.
</p>
<p>Warren and Nagle met with the fate of their friends set
</p>
<p>ashore at Dungarvon within a week, being arrested on the
</p>
<p>1st of June. They were brought to trial, but released on
</p>
<p>condition of returning to America. There Nagle ended
</p>
<p>his life by throwing himself from a window, in September
</p>
<p>1869, as some say, or as others maintain by being stabbed
</p>
<p>in a drunken brawl. The Jacknel expedition compelled
</p>
<p>the resignation of Glceson, who was succeeded by John
</p>
<p>Savage, the literary man par excellence of the F. B., and
</p>
<p>the gentleman whom the courteous rulers of the States
</p>
<p>attempted to force upon England not long before as Consul
</p>
<p>for Leeds.
</p>
<p>By this time the I. R. B. was split up into a greater
</p>
<p>number of wings than the F. B. ; in fact, it was all wings
</p>
<p>and no body. It would be exceedingly difficult to give
</p>
<p>anything like an accurate picture of it in June 1867. The
</p>
<p>Chester failure and the issue of the rising of the 5th of
</p>
<p>March had disgusted the more Irish members of the home
</p>
<p>branch of the conspiracy with their Irish - American
</p>
<p>leaders. The Dublin, Cork, and Connaught circles, broke

</p>
<p>away bodily from them; but, at the same time, broke
</p>
<p>The Rising of the ^th of Alar ch. 289
</p>
<p>away from one another also. There was a directory
</p>
<p>established in DubHn, which exercised a good deal of
</p>
<p>authority in Leinster, and which was obeyed by detached
</p>
<p>circles in the other provinces, as well as by circles here and
</p>
<p>lliere in England. There was another directory in Cork,
</p>
<p>which controlled Minister, with a few isolated circles else-
</p>
<p>where. And there was the original directory in London,
</p>
<p>with Kelly as Head Centre, which was recognised in Eng-
</p>
<p>land, while it pretended to govern the whole of the I. R. B.
</p>
<p>This last was by far the most formidable of the fragments.
</p>
<p>Kelly was doing his best to carry out the ideas of Cluseret
</p>
<p>by amalgamating his branch of the I. R. B. with English
</p>
<p>Democracy.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Roberts Wing took a fit of common
</p>
<p>sense, and set itself to work to reunite the various frag-
</p>
<p>ments of the conspiracy on both sides of the Atlantic. It
</p>
<p>began with the I. R. B. After a good deal of preliminary
</p>
<p>negotiations, in which two persons  O'Donoghue and
</p>
<p>Cook, the latter a near relative to an O. I. R.  took much
</p>
<p>part, Daniel O'SuUivan, " Secretary for Civil Affairs " to
</p>
<p>the Roberts Wing was sent as a plenipotentiary to the
</p>
<p>I. R. B., sailing from New York on the lOth of May. He
</p>
<p>visited the principal centres, was well received in Ireland,
</p>
<p>and variously received in England, where he was firmly
</p>
<p>opposed by Kelly, a strong partisan of the Savage-Mahony
</p>
<p>wing. Still he managed to persuade a respectable number
</p>
<p>of circles to elect delegates who were to meet President
</p>
<p>Roberts in Paris and arrange matters. Roberts arrived in
</p>
<p>l\'iris about the middle of the July following, met the dele-
</p>
<p>gates of the I. R. B., or of that part of it which consented

</p>
<p>to send delegates, and came to an agreement with them.
</p>
<p>To that covenant  formally drawn and duly signed and
</p>
<p>sealed by the President of the Roberts Wing of the F. B-
</p>
<p>on the one side, and by those delegates representing a
</p>
<p>portion of the I. R. B. on the other side  was given the
</p>
<p>magniloquent title of "The Treaty of Paris." It stipu-
</p>
<p>lated that the Roberts Wing of the F. B. was to supply
</p>
<p>the I. R. B. with all they required to prepare rebellion ;
</p>
<p>and at the same time, to prepare themselves an invasion of
</p>
<p>Canada. On their part, the delegates agreed to recognise
</p>
<p>this wing as the only legitimate organisation of the F. B.
</p>
<p>and to act in harmony with it on all occasions. They
</p>
<p>agreed also to procure the election of a " Supreme Coun-
</p>
<p>cil," which was to control the I. R. B. and to ratify "the
</p>
<p>Treaty of Paris."
</p>
<p>Having effected this much, Roberts returned to America,
</p>
<p>leaving O'Sullivan behind him to labour at the construction
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Council. On his return to America Roberts
</p>
<p>found that a great change had taken place in the ranks of
</p>
<p>the F. B. There was a wide demand for union, for the
</p>
<p>abdication of the rival presidents, and for the election of
</p>
<p>John Mitchell as President of the whole Brotherhood..
</p>
<p>Roberts and Savage gave way to the general cry, agreed to-
</p>
<p>abdicate, and united in convoking a Congress of the F. B.
</p>
<p>at Cleveland, to discuss the whole matter. This Congress.
</p>
<p>met on the 3d of September 1867. Herein it was decided
</p>
<p>that the Constitution of Philadelphia should be re-adopted,,
</p>
<p>and that John Mitchell should be invited to take the pre-
</p>
<p>sidency under its provisions. A deputation accordingly

</p>
<p>The Rising of the %th of March. 29 1
</p>
<p>But before his reply could be received, events occurred in
</p>
<p>England which must now be noticed.
</p>
<p>While labouring at the scheme originated by Cluseret^
</p>
<p>and at the same time doing all he could to frustrate
</p>
<p>O'Sullivan in setting up a Supreme Council over the
</p>
<p>I.R. B.  tasks which kept him constantly in motion 
</p>
<p>Kelly was arrested at Manchester, on the nth of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, a week after the opening of the Congress of Cleveland.
</p>
<p>He was then in company with "Captain" Dacey, or
</p>
<p>Daisy, a desperado of the M'Caffcrty type, who was made
</p>
<p>prisoner likewise. This Dacey was said to have been
</p>
<p>originally a working tailor. His portrait shows about one
</p>
<p>of the most repulsive faces that one w^ould care to see.
</p>
<p>This event was immediately communicated to the directors
</p>
<p>in London, who, despairing of his release, immediately
</p>
<p>elected Ricard Burke to the post they considered vacant.
</p>
<p>Burke did not long enjoy his pre-eminence  "Captain"
</p>
<p>John ICdward Kelly, a printer, like the other Kelly, and a
</p>
<p>near relative  knowing well that it would go hard with
</p>
<p>the organiser of the Assassination Committee  that indeed
</p>
<p>nothing could save his neck should he remain in duresse^
</p>
<p>determined to rescue him, cost what it might. In a mar-
</p>
<p>vellously short space of time his plan was formed, and all
</p>
<p>the necessary arrangements made. Manchester abounded
</p>
<p>in members of the I. R. B. of the true resolute type. There
</p>
<p>were hundreds among them ready, at any moment, to peril
</p>
<p>life and more than life, in " the cause," and for the security
</p>
<p>of the leaders who represented the cause.
</p>
<p>The night after Kelly's arrest was a busy one in the great

<p>manufacturing city. The morning came, and Kelly and his
</p>
<p>2Q2 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>companion were brought before the magistrate. The plan
</p>
<p>of rescue was fourfold ; but owing to the precautions of the
</p>
<p>police the first part  an attempt within the court itself  had
</p>
<p>to be abandoned. So had the second  an attempt at the
</p>
<p>spot where the prisoners were transferred from the court
</p>
<p>to the carriage which was to convoy them to prison.
</p>
<p>Along the route to the prison, at suitable points, two other
</p>
<p>strong parties, every man of which was armed to the
</p>
<p>teeth, were ambushed. The first of these ambuscades
</p>
<p>was successful. The van was surrounded, the guards
</p>
<p>were overpowered, the door was blown open by a pistol
</p>
<p>shot which slew the police sergeant, Brett, who kept guard
</p>
<p>inside, and the prisoners were released amid demonstra-
</p>
<p>tions of wild delight from their deliverers. " Kelly, I'll die
</p>
<p>for you," exclaimed one youthful enthusiast, kissing his
</p>
<p>manacled hand ; and so he did. He was one of the three
</p>
<p>who paid for their share in this  the only real success that
</p>
<p>the I. R. B. ever achieved  with their lives.
</p>
<p>Two of these unfortunates were not principals ; they
</p>
<p>were merely actors, as forward as their fellows, where all
</p>
<p>were forward. The third, Mullady or Shaw, was the com-
</p>
<p>mander of the band, and the only one wlio should have
</p>
<p>suffered the extreme penalty. Whether that penalty would
</p>
<p>have been inflicted at all under other circumstances is more
</p>
<p>than doubtful. We can see no difference between the
</p>
<p>slaughter of a police officer in effecting the rescue of Colonel
</p>
<p>Kellyand Captain, and the slaughter of a police officer in the
</p>
<p>attempt of Captain Mackay to escape arrest. Of the two
</p>
<p>there was more to be said in favour of the slaughterers in

<p>the first than in favour of the slayer in the second ; for

</p>
<p>the death of Brett Vvas much of a misadventure. But the
</p>
<p>doings of the I. R. B. and of the F. B. abroad, their crimes
</p>
<p>and folHes, their assassinations and their fiascos^ their
</p>
<p>manifest wish to involve us in foreign warfare as well as
</p>
<p>civil commotion, their insolence on all occasions, and a
</p>
<p>dread not altogether ill-founded of certain incendiary in-
</p>
<p>tentions, had alarmed the whole English nation. The
</p>
<p>Manchester affair gave that alarm a tinge of ferocity.
</p>
<p>Another event was to raise the anger of England to a
</p>
<p>dangerous height. But before we treat of that circum-
</p>
<p>stance we must return to the Congress of Cleveland.
</p>
<p>The deputation empowered to offer John Mitchell the
</p>
<p>presidency of the Fenian Brotherhood met with a stern
</p>
<p>and uncompromising refusal. He would have nothing
</p>
<p>more to do with the F. B. A few months later he saw fit
</p>
<p>to give his reasons for this refusal in a letter addressed to
</p>
<p>his friend John Martin, but really intended for publication,
</p>
<p>and which was published accordingly. The resume which
</p>
<p>it contains of Fenianism is somewhat rhetorical, but still
</p>
<p>so admirable that wc give it : 
</p>
<p>" In the United States Fenianism is still in confusion
</p>
<p>and disarray, so that the force of the great Irish element
</p>
<p>here is completely neutralised, and for any Irish purpose
</p>
<p>utterly unavailable. This is not because of the disunion
</p>
<p>about which so much lament has been made, but because
</p>
<p>of the original vice of the organisation itself; it was
</p>
<p>established upon a wrong and false basis by that wretched
</p>
<p>Stephens, namely, upon the project of immediate insurrec-
</p>
<p>tion in Ireland, while England is at peace, that insurrec-

<p>land. Yet it would not be true to say that our country-
</p>
<p>men were deliberately cheating each other from the two
</p>
<p>opposite sides of the Atlantic. No ; one man cheated
</p>
<p>them both, and created a system, and trained a school of
</p>
<p>delusion, which is only now beginning to be completely
</p>
<p>blown.
</p>
<p>" Nine years ago, to my knowledge, young men settled
</p>
<p>in western cities, wound up their business, sold everything
</p>
<p>they had, and started for Ireland on the faith of assurances
</p>
<p>that the insurrection was to break out that year. And so
</p>
<p>it has been every year since ; Mr Stephens's Fenian army
</p>
<p>in Ireland was for ever on the point of fighting the British
</p>
<p>army, and as our bold young men here have naturally
</p>
<p>been desirous to be counted in for that promised fight, the
</p>
<p>stream of Irish-Americans still continued setting towards
</p>
<p>Ireland, until, after our great war, the stream almost
</p>
<p>became a torrent. All those people were deceived by
</p>
<p>systematic falsehoods about the ' Men at home.'

<p>. " And the men at home were carefully taught to believe
</p>
<p>The Rising of the ^ih of March, 295
</p>
<p>that here in America was a great powerful Irish nation,
</p>
<p>with unlimited resources and an army and navy, both
</p>
<p>wilh'ng and able to give them important material aid in
</p>
<p>troops and arms, with the connivance or even in spite of
</p>
<p>the United States government. So they prepared for im-
</p>
<p>mediate fight, and wondered that this American army was
</p>
<p>not yet landed. And in all this there was no empty
</p>
<p>bravado on the part of the deluded people at either side
</p>
<p>of the ocean. They were ready ; they are always ready
</p>
<p>and eager ; they crave, they thirst and hunger for but one
</p>
<p>chance of fighting that same British army. Thousands
</p>
<p>upon thousands of stalwart men now on this continent
</p>
<p>would give their last dollar freely if they could but make
</p>
<p>.sure of seeing themselves face to face with Queen Victoria's
</p>
<p>redcoats. Moreover, it is quite true that there is here in
</p>
<p>America (not counting the people in Ireland at all) the
</p>
<p>material of a force, a force of soldiery trained in the Con-
</p>
<p>federate and Federal armies, strong enough to free Ireland
</p>
<p> that is to destroy the British Empire, which means the
</p>
<p>.same thing." Here Mr Mitchell dwells, in the same strain,
</p>
<p>for several sentences on Irish military material in America.
</p>
<p>*' The force is great," he continues, " but it is at one side
</p>
<p>of the Atlantic, and its * objective point ' is another. And
</p>
<p>why not go, then, where its work lies all ready for it ?
</p>
<p>Simply because the government of the country we reside
</p>
<p>in will not suffer that, and is able to hinder and bound to
</p>
<p>hinder that. In any force which would be at all worth
</p>
<p>counting, an expedition to Ireland would be morally and
</p>
<p>physically impossible, and the original vice of Fenianism

<p>lay in telling credulous innocent people that they could not
</p>
<p>296 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>get the length of fighting at all while England is at peace,
</p>
<p>and in exhorting them to pour out their money under
</p>
<p>that false pretence.
</p>
<p>"To heighten and stimulate the delusion still more, the
</p>
<p>assumption was made that the Irish race on this continent
</p>
<p>is a nation, has a right to declare itself a republic, to con-
</p>
<p>stitute a government, with secretaries of state, army, and
</p>
<p>navy, government bonds, and so forth ; and these grand
</p>
<p>pretensions and fine phrases were not without their effect
</p>
<p>on an imaginative people like ours. But all this was
</p>
<p>excessively repugnant to the American people, or else
</p>
<p>ridiculous in their eyes. The Fenian Inipcriiint in ImpC7'io
</p>
<p>was an anomaly ; and though the Americans very well
</p>
<p>knew that it was powerless to effect its avowed object,,
</p>
<p>and though they were fully resolved not to allow it to
</p>
<p>complicate their relations with England, yet they felt it as
</p>
<p>an affront and laughed at it as a farce. The American
</p>
<p>Government has its hands firmly fixed on the whole
</p>
<p>movement, and has made use of it to hold up i)i tci'rorcvt
</p>
<p>before the eyes of England, by way of inducing her to be
</p>
<p>more compliant in the diplomatic discussions which are
</p>
<p>going on between London and Washington ; just as a man
</p>
<p>holds a bull-dog by the collar, sure that he can let him
</p>
<p>slip against his enemy, or else driv^e him back to his
</p>
<p>kennel. Neither has the Government by any means done
</p>
<p>with the Fenians in that capacity ; it expects more of the
</p>
<p>same kind of service ; and so deals very gently with
</p>
<p>them  (for in fact these Irish have votes, and your poli-
</p>
<p>tician must deal with them 'as though he loved them.*)

<p>Eut the Government most intimately knows all their pro-
</p>
<p>The Rising of the ^th of March, 297-
</p>
<p>ceedings; knows where it can lay its hands again upon
</p>
<p>the restored arms ; has arranged with the Canadian
</p>
<p>Government for a joint defence of that frontier ; and in
</p>
<p>every seaport keeps so vigilant a guard that not even a
</p>
<p>ship of considerable size, to say nothing of a fleet of trans-
</p>
<p>ports, can possibly go out, or get ready to go out. So,
</p>
<p>you see, the trouble with these poor Fenians is not dis-
</p>
<p>union  it is just utter impotence  impotence to do any-
</p>
<p>thing arising from the nature of the case and the funda-
</p>
<p>mental vice of the organisation.
</p>
<p>" But when, \\\ addition to the original error, there came
</p>
<p>on them the curse of factious disunion  when in 1865 their
</p>
<p>society split up into parts, and these immediately began
</p>
<p>to vilify one another, then it became more clear that the
</p>
<p>movement in that form was wholly useless for any good
</p>
<p>purpose. Our good people here cry out for Uftion,
</p>
<p>earnestly pray for union ; and seem to think that if the
</p>
<p>two factions would only unite, the problem would be
</p>
<p>solved ; Ireland would be liberated. Now it is certainly
</p>
<p>desirable that these factions should come to an end, and
</p>
<p>that the Irish element here should at least be harmonious ;
</p>
<p>because then they would cease to abuse one another
</p>
<p>through newspapers and resolutions of * circles ; ' but they
</p>
<p>would no longer afford to the Americans the amusement,,
</p>
<p>to the English the deep gratification, of seeing them ex-
</p>
<p>pending all their zeal and enthusiasm in tearing one
</p>
<p>another to pieces. But what would be all the good of
</p>
<p>'union.**' If these two wings were united to-morrow (as
</p>
<p>they will not be), they would then be able to do nothing ;

</p>
<p>their object. That union would be only an agreement
</p>
<p>of two 'wings' to help one another in doing nothing,
</p>
<p>instead of hindering one another to do nothing, as at
</p>
<p>present. They would then be more conspicuously doing
</p>
<p>nothing than even now. In short, the whole concern has
</p>
<p>run right up against a wall, and cannot take one step
</p>
<p>further.
</p>
<p>" This fatal impasse has been, I imagine, painfully
</p>
<p>apparent to the leaders of these two factions ; I mean Mr
</p>
<p>Roberts and Mr Savage. They found themselves at the
</p>
<p>head of two distinct organisations, each striving to outvie
</p>
<p>and outbid the other in bold promises and professions,
</p>
<p>and the respective adherents of each eagerly and angrily
</p>
<p>demanding some speedy action, while they were sadly
</p>
<p>conscious that they could do nothing whatsoever, and the
</p>
<p>people, worn out by delay and disappointment, and dis-
</p>
<p>heartened by the long continuance of mean and senseless
</p>
<p>attractions, were rapidly falling away from them both.
</p>
<p>Those two * Presidents ' felt themselves in the position of
</p>
<p>two men, each of them holding a wolf by the ears.
</p>
<p>" In this position of affairs, you are aware that negotia-
</p>
<p>tions for tmion were held with a very sincere desire, I
</p>
<p>believe, on the part of the * Presidents ' to effect their com-
</p>
<p>bination, and withdraw themselves from under the heavy
</p>
<p>responsibility that weighed upon them. A * basis of
</p>
<p>union ' was drawn up, and the two * Presidents ' pursuant

<p>to that preliminary arrangement, came and offered to me

<p>time. I was not responsible for any of their doings or
</p>
<p>misdoings. I had not approved of any one of their enter-
</p>
<p>prises, either on the side of Canada or on the side of
</p>
<p>Ireland. Whenever I had ventured to offer them any
</p>
<p>advice or give them any warning, it had been uniformly
</p>
<p>disregarded. I had, for example, warned them that the
</p>
<p>hints and intimations of underlings of this Government, to
</p>
<p>the effect tliat their invasion of Canada would be winked
</p>
<p>at and permitted, were intended to cheat them, and that
</p>
<p>the Government would be sure to turn upon them at the last
</p>
<p>moment and defeat any such invasion, as indeed it was
</p>
<p>bound to do ; but they tried, nevertheless, to invade
</p>
<p>Canada. I had warned them against any attempt at
</p>
<p>insurrection in Ireland while England was at peace ; but
</p>
<p>they persisted in making their wretched attempt at insur-
</p>
<p>rection in Ireland. I had begged of them not to place the
</p>
<p>government of their organisation in the hands of Stephens;
</p>
<p>but they did this very thing almost the moment he
</p>
<p>appeared. And now, when blunders, failure, and faction
</p>
<p>have brought their affairs to the lowest ebb, and the
</p>
<p>impatient and justly indignant people are insisting upon
</p>
<p>action, action, those leaders who are holding the wolf
</p>
<p>by the ears politely invite me to take charge of these two
</p>
<p>wolves, of these two packs of wolves ; request me, in the
</p>
<p>most complimentary manner, to take and knit up the two
</p>
<p>ragged fag ends of an organisation originally rotten, and
</p>
<p>now all tattered and torn, and to wear the patched up
</p>
<p>things as a robe of honour. Of course I respectfully
</p>
<p>decline.

<p>"You arc to recollect the presidency was tendered to me

<p>300 The Fenian Conspiracy ,
</p>
<p>specifically, under a written * constitution,' which was to
</p>
<p><^overn the organisation and govern me ; and with a set
</p>
<p>of * senators * or * councillors ' who were to have the
</p>
<p>power of controlling all my actions. Half of these
</p>
<p>councillors were to be furnished me from the fraction
</p>
<p>which believes the salvation of Ireland lies in Canada ;
</p>
<p>the other half from the party which is always professing
</p>
<p>to aid the ' men at home ' to complete the revolution
</p>
<p>which they pretend is already in progress of accom-
</p>
<p>plishment there. If I had accepted the office, and had
</p>
<p>thereupon undertaken (as I certainly should have under-
</p>
<p>taken), to explode both of those delusions, and to bring
</p>
<p>the association within the bounds of reason and of law 
</p>
<p>thcHi at once, would have arisen a conflict ; constitutional

<p>questions would have raged around me ; and a new

<p>division would have broken out immediately. Then, the

<p>instrument they call a 'constitution' is in itself ridiculous;

<p>ashamed of occupying a position in which I shoukl be

<p>expected to carry on the sham of a provisional govern-

</p>
<p>abandoning our brothers !  British gold in his pocket !
</p>
<p>"Now as for abandoning our brothers, those men in
</p>
<p>]''ngland and in Ireland, who get up absurd and mis-
</p>
<p>chievous 'scares,' may be very brave and patriotic, but
</p>
<p>they are extremely unwise, and have no right to expect
</p>
<p>that they are to be encouraged in their folly by loud
</p>
<p>promises of assistance from this side, which promises
</p>
<p>cannot be realised to any greater extent than might
</p>
<p>enable them for a while longer to frighten and exasperate
</p>
<p>the middle class of Englishmen, and of English-Irishmen ;
</p>
<p>for they arc not frightening the government at all. In
</p>
<p>truth, the Ih'itish Government is much indebted to those
</p>
<p>desperadoes who make the big scares and little riots; and
</p>
<p>ought to pay them in Hrilish gold. They form, it seems,
</p>
<p>one division of the Irish Republican army under Mr
</p>
<p>Savage's section.
</p>
<p>"The other wing itself is a shade more rational than
</p>
<p>this. It professes to make Canada its first object ; and
</p>
<p>certainly a blow struck in Canada would' seriously injure
</p>
<p>English prestige and English power, and would employ
</p>
<p>a large British force ; also, it must be said that it looks
</p>
<p>easier to carry an armed force across that frontier than

<p>across the Atlantic  it looks much easier; yet it is im-

<p>the trouble at either side is merely impotence. Having

<p>The refusal of the presidency by Mitchell flung the
</p>
<p>almost reunited F. B. into greater confusion than before.

<p>The Savage-Mahony wing became the one, headed by
</p>
<p>Savage, bitterly hostile to the Kelly party in luigland^
</p>
<p>and supporting the Supreme Council ; another supporting

<p>the Kelly party, and opposing the Supreme Council ; and

<p>a third calling for reconstruction. The other wing became

<p>claiming to maintain home interests and the Supreme

<p>present occupation. The Manchester affair removed a
</p>
<p>j^reat obstacle from their course ; for Colonel Thomas J.
</p>
<p>Kelly, seeing, as he phrased it, that " the game was get-
</p>
<p>ting far too risky," took ship on the first opportunity for
</p>
<p>America, where, much to his own satisfaction, he arrived
</p>
<p>safe and sound, ere the year of grace 1867 came to a
</p>
<p>close. Nor was " Secretary " O'Sullivan much annoyed
</p>
<p>by the antagonism of Kelly's successor, "Colonel" Ricard
</p>
<p>Burke. Before this worthy could gather up the reigns of
</p>
<p>such power as had been committed to him, he too fell
</p>
<p>into the hands of the police. He was arrested in London
</p>
<p>on the 28th of November, and committed to prison (the
</p>
<p>House of Detention, Clerkenwell), from which he, like his
</p>
<p>predecessor, was not so fortunate as to escape. It was no!
</p>
<p>that his followers lost heart and abandoned him to his fate.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, they tried as strenuously and even more
</p>
<p>desperately than \x\ the case of Kelly, to place him at large.
</p>
<p>Dacey  here known as " Captain Murphy," was the
</p>
<p>contriver of the plot  that is without the prison ; for
</p>
<p>Burke contrived to have a share in putting it together from
</p>
<p>within. It consisted in placing a barrel of gunpowder
</p>
<p>against the wall of the exercise ground of the prison and
</p>
<p>firing it, while the prisoners were at exercise, in the hope
</p>
<p>that  the wall being shattered to pieces  Burke would
</p>
<p>succeed in making his escape during the confusion. The
</p>
<p>plan was desperate in the extreme  a piece of veritable
</p>
<p>insanity. It is difficult to conceive how men who had
</p>
<p>seen service, like Burke and Dacey, could have thought of
</p>
<p>such a thing.

<p>The first attempt, made on the 12th of December, failed..
</p>
<p>304 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>The barrel was duly deposited, indeed, and the match fiiirly
</p>
<p>placed and lighted ; but the explosion would not come
</p>
<p>off. Thereupon the tub of powder was replaced on its
</p>
<p>truck and wheeled away  all this, be it remembered, taking
</p>
<p>place in broad daylight. Next day the attempt was repeated
</p>
<p>and with fearful effect. The wall was shattered to atoms.
</p>
<p>Burke, however, did not escape. The authorities had
</p>
<p>received a hint of what was intended ; and that day the
</p>
<p>prisoners were not exercised at the usual time. We have
</p>
<p>been informed that the failure of the explosion on the first
</p>
<p>occasion was intentional ; that the person to whom the
</p>
<p>failure was due was commanded  0)1 pain of death  not
</p>
<p>to fail a second time ; that, placed thus in a dilemma  if
</p>
<p>the term can be applied to the position in which he
</p>
<p>found himself  threatened with death on three sides -by
</p>
<p>the explosion itself ; by the law, should he escape the ex-
</p>
<p>plosion ; and by the I. R. B., should he fail in performing
</p>
<p>the task allotted to him  he tried to escape, not by
</p>
<p>turning absolute informer, but by giving such a hint as
</p>
<p>might cause the police to arrest him before the deed
</p>
<p>should be done.
</p>
<p>The precaution taken by the prison authorities saved
</p>
<p>many lives, perhaps that of Burke among the rest. Had
</p>
<p>the prisoners been in the yard when the wall was de-
</p>
<p>stroyed, hardly one would have escaped. Others, how-
</p>
<p>ever, suffered. On the other side of the street, of which
</p>
<p>the prison wall formed one side, was a row of humble

<p>tenements which was shattered by the explosion, and

<p>the name of " Michael Barrett," was executed. And here
</p>
<p>it would be unjust not to notice the extreme care taken by
</p>
<p>the Government, in the midst of intensest national excite-
</p>
<p>ment and indif^nation, to avoid punishing tlws man, unless
</p>
<p>on the clearest evidence. An alibi was pleaded for him
</p>
<p>and strongly sworn to. Nor was it until all the swearing
</p>
<p>in his favour had been laboriously sifted and clearly
</p>
<p>proved a mass of perjury that he was sent to the scaffold.
</p>
<p>The Clerkenwell explosion exasperated all England
</p>
<p>against the I. R. B. It required very little more provoca-
</p>
<p>tion to have produced a .general onslaught on the lower
</p>
<p>classes of the Irish in all the larger towns. Indeed, such
</p>
<p>a thing was attempted, and with difficulty restrained, in
</p>
<p>more places than one, and not without some damage done
</p>
<p>to houses and Roman Catholic places of worship.
</p>
<p>The Clerkenwell explosion blew to pieces the influence
</p>
<p>of the Irish-American directory over the I. R. B., or what
</p>
<p>remained of that influence. O'Sullivan would now have
</p>
<p>succeeded but for the treachery of his agent, Power, in
</p>
<p>conjunction with his own fears. Power,  instructed, we
</p>
<p>have been informed, by Stephens, played a double game,
</p>
<p>and played it well. Penetrating the character of his prin-
</p>
<p>cipal, he kept him in perpetual fear of the English police,
</p>
<p>even in Paris. As to England, O'Sullivan only ventured
</p>
<p>to visit it now and then, and with extreme precaution.
</p>
<p>At the same time Power took O'Sullivan's money. He used
</p>
<p>it, also, as O'Sullivan intended he should use it,  in procur-
</p>
<p>ing the election of the Supreme Council. The members
</p>
<p>were seven in number ; one for each of the Irish provinces,

<p>two for England, and one for Scotland. Most of these
</p>
<p>were the. merest nobodies ; two only  the members for
</p>
<p>England  deserve mention. One "Doctor" Keenan, as-
</p>
<p>sistant to a druggist in Whitechapel, afterwards dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished himself in America by pistolling Mr P. J.
</p>
<p>Meehan and inflicting a serious wound, for which he was
</p>
<p>sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. The other
</p>
<p>was an ex-priest, dissenting preacher, hack-writer, and a
</p>
<p>hundred other things beside.
</p>
<p>This Supreme Council met at length in February 1868.
</p>
<p>O'Sullivan paid their travelling charges to the place of
</p>
<p>meeting. When he himself applied for admission he was
</p>
<p>refused, under the pretence that he represented no con-
</p>
<p>stituency and had no right to sit with them. Power,
</p>
<p>however, was admitted, and in accordance with his
</p>
<p>advice, the Supreme Council came to the resolution
</p>
<p>to repudiate all American interference with the internal
</p>
<p>affairs of the I. R. B. O'Sullivan returned to America to
</p>
<p>relate his failure, and immediately after him appeared an
</p>
<p>agent commissioned by the Supreme Council of the I. R. 15.
</p>
<p>to demand help from all the wings of the F. B. The
</p>
<p>Savage wing paid some attention to him ; so did that
</p>
<p>headed by Scanlan ; the O'Neil-Roberts wing disdained
</p>
<p>to recognise him and denounced the unparalleled in-
</p>
<p>gratitude and impudence of his employers, whom from
</p>
<p>that moment it did its utmost to overthrow. By the
</p>
<p>last-mentioned body a number of proselytizers were sent
</p>
<p>to Ireland, well supplied with money to work against
</p>
<p>the Supreme Council, and met with a good deal of

</p>
<p>success so long as their money lasted. The rivalry
</p>
<p>The Rising of the ^th of March, 307
</p>
<p>seemed to give new life to the conspiracy, and while it
</p>
<p>continued much activity was manifested in holding meet-
</p>
<p>ings and distributing arms, with the inevitable result,  the
</p>
<p>suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act,  which again took
</p>
<p>place about the time of the first meeting of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Council in 1868.
</p>
<p>]5ut the rivalry between the O'Neil-Roberts wing of the
</p>
<p>F. B. and the Supreme Council of the I. R. B. soon came
</p>
<p>to an end. O'Ncil was too busy with his preparations for
</p>
<p>resuming the invasion of Canada to pay much attention
</p>
<p>to Ireland, and the result of that invasion gave a mortal
</p>
<p>wound, for the time, to the conspiracy on both sides of the
</p>
<p>Atlantic. One of O'Neil's preparations was the murder of
</p>
<p>Thomas D'Arcy M'Gee, which was deliberately planned
</p>
<p>and executed  after the manner of Kelly's Assassination
</p>
<p>Committee. As a political device, it was most unfortunate
</p>
<p>for the Fenians. Canada was exasperated by the deed,
</p>
<p>and all honest men alienated for ever from those at whose
</p>
<p>bidding it was done. Taken along with so many other
</p>
<p>similar deeds, it rendered the Brotherhood universally
</p>
<p>odious.
</p>
<p>^ in this one thing only  the use of assassination  did
</p>
<p>the leaders of the various sections of the conspiracy now
</p>
<p>agree. While M'Gee was slaughtered by order of the
</p>
<p>Fenian chiefs, the Supreme Council of Ireland directed
</p>
<p>the murder of the policeman, Talbot. He had won the
</p>
<p>hatred of the whole body by the daring and effect with
</p>
<p>which he had played spy in their midst for two years ; and
</p>
<p>he had confirmed their vindictive purpose by the contempt

</p>
<p>with which he treated their threats. Pensioned for his
</p>
<p>3o8 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>services, he would not quit Dublin. A giant in strength
</p>
<p>and utterly fearless, he went about in the very centre of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy as he had been accustomed to do, and for
</p>
<p>months with impunity. At length he met his doom. One
</p>
<p>of thq party of executioners was arrested and brought to
</p>
<p>trial. The line of defence adopted by his counsel was
</p>
<p>remarkable. The bullet struck him on the head, but did
</p>
<p>not penetrate the skull. It lodged in the muscles near
</p>
<p>the temple, and was only to be extracted by an operation
</p>
<p>so delicate and doubtful that the surgeons shrank from
</p>
<p>attempting it ; consequently it was left where it lay.
</p>
<p>Inflainmation of the brain supervened, and the man died.
</p>
<p>In cross-examination, the doctors admitted that there was
</p>
<p>a possibility  the very smallest of possibilities  that the
</p>
<p>man's life might have been preserved had the operation been
</p>
<p>performed. On this the counsel for the prisoner pleaded,
</p>
<p>and with complete effect, that death was really due to the
</p>
<p>hesitation of the surgeons, and not to the act of the
</p>
<p>assassin. Certain national journals went much further,
</p>
<p>denouncing the doctors as incompetent, and suggesting
</p>
<p>that it was they and not the assassin who ought to have
</p>
<p>been brought to trial. The latter was acquitted on the
</p>
<p>capital charge, but convicted immediately afterwards of a
</p>
<p>minor offence, and sentenced to penal servitude. The
</p>
<p>whole thing was Irish in the extreme.
</p>
<p>Nearly as notable as the murder of Talbot in Dublin
</p>
<p>was the murder of the guardsman in London, shortly
</p>
<p>afterwards. Like one or two others done by these people;
</p>
<p>it was altogether a mistake. The shot  intended for

</p>
<p>different parties of assassins stationed in the vicinity of as
</p>
<p>many of the supposed haunts of this most consummate of
</p>
<p>traitors.
</p>
<p>At this period the assassination committees did not
</p>
<p>confme their attention to dangerous antagonists, traitors,
</p>
<p>and spies. They resolved to establish a Reign of Terror,
</p>
<p>from which they expected great thing.^, by shooting down
</p>
<p>leading personages one after another. It was intended
</p>
<p>that these deeds should be committed in the most impres-
</p>
<p>sive manner. There was to be no dogging footsteps, no
</p>
<p>lying in ambush, no secrecy. All was to be done openly,
</p>
<p>and by men who could not hope to escape the penalty
</p>
<p>attached to their deeds. The excitement of the period 
</p>
<p>the " hero worship " lavished on the " martyrs " of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy  had not been without effect on Celtic enthu-
</p>
<p>.siasm. There were men among the I. R. B. fully prepared
</p>
<p>to emulate those who sacrificed themselves in. other days
</p>
<p>to slay William the Silent and Henri Quatre  under the
</p>
<p>influence of similar excitement. And there were those
</p>
<p>among the chiefs who did not scruple to use such
</p>
<p>enthusiasts.
</p>
<p>The first of these victims and the scene of his execution
</p>
<p>were carefully selected, to show that no rank, however
</p>
<p>exalted, and no distance, however vast, could interfere with
</p>
<p>the vengeance of the I. R. B.  that it could strike down a
</p>
<p>prince as easily in Australia as a policeman in Dublin.
</p>
<p>The Duke of Edinburgh, then at Melbourne, was severely

<p>iirst, of its kind. Not even the hardened adventurers who
</p>
<p>3 1 o The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>directed it, could withstand the reprobation which the
</p>
<p>crime called forth, and within the Brotherhood, as well as
</p>
<p>without it. Beyond the adventurers and their tools, the
</p>
<p>act found no favour with the I. R. B. ; they would have no
</p>
<p>more like it. In consequence the promoters did their
</p>
<p>utmost to disavow the assassin, asserting that his act was
</p>
<p>altogether his own, and himself insane.
</p>
<p>It was admitted that 100,000 dollars had been received
</p>
<p>by the O'Neil wing in 1868. Of this sum not 20,000
</p>
<p>dollars was spent in war material ; the rest was appro-
</p>
<p>priated by officials. Consequently, that year flew by with-
</p>
<p>out the promised invasion of Canada. The same thing
</p>
<p>happened in 1869. By this time O'Ncil had become as
</p>
<p>obnoxious to his Senate as O'Mahony had ever been to
</p>
<p>his ; its members thwarted him in every way. O'Neil
</p>
<p>was unable to do anything until the month of May 1870
</p>
<p>was well advanced. On the 25 th of that month he
</p>
<p>attempted his raid. He expected to march with 2000
</p>
<p>men at least ; his following numbered less than 200.
</p>
<p>Still he moved across the border. The Canadians, ready
</p>
<p>for him and admirably posted, received him with a sharp
</p>
<p>Inc. His men turned and ran like rank cowards, in spite
</p>
<p>of all he  who was not a coward, but a right good
</p>
<p>soldier, to give him his due  could do to stop them ; so
</p>
<p>ho was obliged to fly with them. Both " General " and
</p>
<p>* army " ran full butt into the arms of the United States
</p>
<p>Marshal and his men, who held them fast, though not to
</p>
<p>keep them long. Thus the last attempt of the conspirators
</p>
<p>ended in a failure more signal than any.

</p>
<p>From this time the conspiracy languished in both
</p>
<p>The Kising of the ^ih of March, 311
</p>
<p>hemispheres. Thcnccforvvird it was confined to dolts and
</p>
<p>swindlers. In 187 1 there seemed, for a while, some
</p>
<p>chance of its revival in America. In that year, the more
</p>
<p>formidable of the conspirators, hitherto detained in
</p>
<p>English prisons  O'Donovan Rossa, M'Cafferty, &c. 
</p>
<p>were released, and emigrated immediately  the majority
</p>
<p>to the United States. Their arrival roused the F. B. to a
</p>
<p>semblance of its ancient enthusiasm ; there were addresses,
</p>
<p>mass meetings, fervid speeches, and so on, after the old
</p>
<p>style. ILxprcssion was given to old aspirations for
</p>
<p>Ireland, and to more than ancient hatred of England.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately Stephens appeared in America simul-
</p>
<p>taneously with his former lieutenants. Somehow or other,
</p>
<p>Stephens always seemed to be playing into the hands of
</p>
<p>the English Government. He seemed to do so at every
</p>
<p>period of importance while he controlled the conspiracy ;
</p>
<p>he seemed to do so while directing Power how to foil'
</p>
<p>O'SuUivan ; and he seemed to do so now.

<p>The chief organiser had been leading an obscure life in

<p>Paris during the preceding five years. Mixing with the
</p>
<p>lowest French demagogues and the foulest French
</p>
<p>journalists, we see little of him previous to the Franco-
</p>
<p>German war. When the surrender of Sedan deposed the
</p>
<p>P2mperor, and made a republic of France, Stephens ac-
</p>
<p>quired some consideration. His republican friends found
</p>
<p>a post for him, and he was appointed inspector-general of
</p>
<p>the northern fortresses. The advance of the German army
</p>
<p>on Paris, however, deprived him of his occupation, and
</p>
<p>drove him to take refuge in Bordeaux. Here he subsided

<p>into a wine merchant, entering into partnership with a
</p>
<p>3 T 2 The Fenian Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>person named Carvalho. When the Fenian prisoners were
</p>
<p>released in 1S71, and were enthusiastically feted in
</p>
<p>America, Stephens, who noticed all with due cogitation,
</p>
<p>persuaded his partner that they ought to open a house in
</p>
<p>New York, with himself (Stephens) at its head. Carvalho
</p>
<p>acceded. Accordingly Stephens made his appearance in
</p>
<p>New York immediately after his ex-lieutenants as a wine-
</p>
<p>merchant. It was evident, however, that he cherished
</p>
<p>other thoughts besides those of trade. He attempted to
</p>
<p>resume his old position, but none of his former subordin-
</p>
<p>ates, not even Rossa, would have anything to do with
</p>
<p>him. He appeared ^t several meetings, to be fiercely
</p>
<p>denounced by Luby and others among the speakers,
</p>
<p>and to be. hooted and execrated by the audience. One
</p>
<p>or two of these occurrences was enough for him, and he
</p>
<p>soon disappeared from among the Fenians, but not from
</p>
<p>America.
</p>
<p>The refugees would join no party, but attempted to
</p>
<p>unite all the Fenians under their own lead. They were
</p>
<p>successful with other refugees in numerous bodies, but no
</p>
<p>further. They disgusted the Americans by putting up
</p>
<p>for state offices, and, in many instances, by their con-
</p>
<p>duct, as for instance that of " Doctor " Keenan, ex-mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the Supreme Council, who pistolled Mr J. P,
</p>
<p>Meehan at a public meeting, inflicting a dangerous but
</p>
<p>not a mortal wound, and who suffered the consequences
</p>
<p>of his deed. Similar occurrences sickened most people

<p>with Fenianism in general, and with the Fcnianism of the
</p>
<p>immigrants in particular. The thing loSt its princi-

<p>a very short space. It is now confined to the lower classes,
</p>
<p>and it is strongest in the Western States. O'Donavan Rossa
</p>
<p>is the present Head Centre of a few very narrow Circles,
</p>
<p>who still meditate American invasion, and treasure up a
</p>
<p>small quantity of rusty weapons with which the raid is to
</p>
<p>be accomplished.
</p>
<p>Such is the story of this remarkable conspiracy. It was
</p>
<p>formidable, in the number of its members, in their spirit,
</p>
<p>and in their devotion to the cause which they adopted ;
</p>
<p>the organisation  the system of circles and centres  was
</p>
<p>admirable. Its failure lay in these. things  its division
</p>
<p>into two branches which could, not but come Into collision
</p>
<p>with one another, sooner or later, and in the character and
</p>
<p>standing of its directors. It was true, as O'Mahony stated,
</p>
<p>that great numbers without the organisation sympathised
</p>
<p>with it. It was true also that many most influential per-
</p>
<p>sonages were perfectly acquainted with its growth and
</p>
<p>extent, and were ready to join, had it only been under
</p>
<p>respectable control. What the chiefs were we have
</p>
<p>shown. The third thing which went to defeat the
</p>
<p>conspiracy was its secresy. Now secret conspiracy,
</p>
<p>embracing or attempting to embrace a whole nation,
</p>
<p>never yet succeeded. The history of all successful con-
</p>
<p>spiracies is the history of the success of a few conspirators.
</p>
<p>When, however, we say that the plot was a failure, our
</p>
<p>meaning must be limited to the avowed object of the
</p>
<p>conspirators. That apart, it was anything but ineffectual.
</p>
<p>It was the main instrument in the hands of the ministry
</p>
<p>which really revolutionised Ireland, by enacting those
</p>
<p>measures which the existence and extent of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>dictated as absolutely necessary.

<p>II. X
</p>
<p>3 1 4 The Fenian Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>A recent event has shown that Fenianism has revived
</p>
<p>somewhat on both sides of the Atlantic. While this
</p>
<p>volume was going through the press, John O'Mahony died
</p>
<p>in New York. His remains were hardly cold when it was
</p>
<p>proposed to give them such a funeral as had been given to
</p>
<p>M'Manus. The proposal was accepted everywhere and at
</p>
<p>once. Within a month, and after imposing demonstrations
</p>
<p>in both hemispheres, the body was interred at Glasnevin.
</p>
<p>It was a repetition, indeed, and as such lacked the strength
</p>
<p>and impressiveness of the original. Still it should not be
</p>
<p>undervalued. There was grave meaning in the rapidity
</p>
<p>with which the plan was accepted and carried out, and in
</p>
<p>the masses which mustered in the various processions.
</p>
<p>Nearly every individual prominent therein figured in the
</p>
<p>State trials of 1865 and subsequent years.
</p>
<p>The conspiracy has been recast and renamed ; it is now
</p>
<p>secret everywhere. It is in close connection with the
</p>
<p>secret associations of the continent, and has come to an
</p>
<p>understanding with English democracy, urban and rural.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the upheaval noticeable of late among the English
</p>
<p>peasantry was suggested by the I. R. B.  we mean by the
</p>
<p>great though indirect success which it attained. The
</p>
<p>English peasant looks with envy on the position of the
</p>
<p>Irish peasant, which is in many respects superior to his
</p>
<p>own. The Irishman may be poorer, but he is not sub-
</p>
<p>jected to certain things which the English cottar feels very
</p>
<p>keenly. There are things done in England by petty shop-
</p>
<p>keepers, by employers among the farmers, and by certain
</p>
<p>magistrates  gentlemen who because they reside at home
</p>
<p>all the year, and do all the drudgery of the bench, are

</p>
<p>allowed to monopolise it and misuse their position thereon
</p>
<p>The Rising of the S^h of March. 3 1 5
</p>
<p> there arc things done by such people which Ireland
</p>
<p>would not tolerate for a moment.
</p>
<p>The views of the new conspiracy are much more
</p>
<p>advanced than when it was directed by Stephens ; its
</p>
<p>numbers are fewer, but they understand one another
</p>
<p>better. A recent election in Tipperary, wherein a Home
</p>
<p>Ruler defeated a Nationalist, gives a fair indication of their
</p>
<p>strength and standing. The Nationalist  a person well
</p>
<p>known in the days of the I. R. B. as " the Galtee Boy" 
</p>
<p>polled one-third of the number polled by the Home Ruler.
</p>
<p>But the latter, as he avowed, was the humble servant of
</p>
<p>the Roman Catholic clergy, who used all their influence in
</p>
<p>his favour. As the older form of the conspiracy grew up
</p>
<p>under the shadow of legal associations; so is the newer
</p>
<p>form growing up under the shadow of nationalism. All
</p>
<p>conspirators arc essentially nationalists ; but all national-
</p>
<p>ists are not conspirators.
</p>
<p>And Irishmen will continue to conspire thus until the
</p>
<p>term " Irishman," like the term " Lancashireman," be-
</p>
<p>comes a mere designation of birthplace, and ceases to
</p>
<p>signify, as it does now, a person whose aims and interests
</p>
