</p>
<p>CAUSES OF THE PRESENT CRISIS.
</p>
<p>So much has been said and written upon the slavery question,
</p>
<p>that to add any thing seems almost a work of supererogation.
</p>
<p>The intention of this pamphlet is not to discuss the right or
</p>
<p>wrong, the advantages or disadvantages, of this institution ; but
</p>
<p>there are considerations connected with this subject which have
</p>
<p>hitherto been to a great extent, overlooked, while their importance
</p>
<p>is such as to commend them to the attention of every American
</p>
<p>patriot. Our path is beset with snares and pitfalls, and the ene-
</p>
<p>mies of free institutions are plotting the destruction of our sys-
</p>
<p>tem of government, while few even of our Statesmen seem to be
</p>
<p>aware of the dangers which environ us. An effort is here made
</p>
<p>to point out and to prove that there are two formidable schemes
</p>
<p>in operation to destroy this Government.
</p>
<p>The two schemers, are the English Government and the Jesuits
</p>
<p>or the Austrian Government. Diverse and antagonistic as they
</p>
<p>are, still, in their scheming they sometimes act in concert.
</p>
<p>At the first whisper of Jesuitism, the hue and cry of religious
</p>
<p>intolerance, proscription and persecution will be raised. Accusa-
</p>
<p>tion will be made, that it is desired to array Protestants against
</p>
<p>Catholics. These, and various other pretexts, will be resorted to,
</p>
<p>in order to divert attention from the true issue.
</p>
<p>But when we find in our midst men who come purposely to per-
</p>
<p>vert our institutions and destroy our liberties, shall we sit still
</p>
<p>and let them do their work unmolested, simply because they make
</p>
<p>use of a church as a cloak for their evil deeds ?
</p>
<p>If we cannot, as a nation, do something to protect ourselves
</p>
<p>without the reproach of being intolerant, then let us take the re-
</p>
<p>proach.
</p>
<p>When our ancestors settled the British colonies of North Ameri-
</p>
<p>ca, they came here with a supreme regard to the enjoyment of
</p>
<p>their liberty and their religion. They left home and friends, and
</p>
<p>though they came here to find a new home, they ever looked to
</p>
<p>and spoke of England, as home.

</p>
<p>Enjoying the luxuries of peace and plenty, we can scarcely
</p>
<p>realize the almost insurmountable trials and difficulties they had
</p>
<p>to endure. And in all their troubles they had so little sympathy
</p>
<p>and aid from the home government, the wonder is not that they
</p>
<p>became independent at last, but that they did not revolt years
</p>
<p>before.
</p>
<p>The French, who had formed alliances with the Indians on the
</p>
<p>St. Lawrence nearly a hundred years before the pilgrims landed,
</p>
<p>were still on friendly terms with them, and as England and France
</p>
<p>were rivals, the French with the Indians as allies, were constantly
</p>
<p>encroaching upon the British colonies.
</p>
<p>With these enemies, the Colonists had to contend from the year
</p>
<p>1675, when the first general war, called "Philip's war" com-
</p>
<p>menced, to the year 1783. Within this period there were seven
</p>
<p>wars.
</p>
<p>The first was excited by Philip, and was confined to the savages
</p>
<p>against the English. The five following were stimulated by the
</p>
<p>French, who supplied them with all the means that ingenuity
</p>
<p>and wealth could command. These, added to Indian cunning,
</p>
<p>treachery and cruelty, were sufficiently formidable ; but when
</p>
<p>the expeditions were planned by European officers, who, in-
</p>
<p>stead of discountenancing the inhuman and barbarous modes of
</p>
<p>warfare practised by the Indians, actually encouraged them by
</p>
<p>offering a reward for scalps taken by their savage allies, the re-
</p>
<p>sults were too horrible to be thought of.
</p>
<p>This devastation and slaughter were sanctioned by the Jesuit
</p>
<p>priests, and these savages, while their hands were yet dropping
</p>
<p>blood, were caressed and cherished by men, regarded by them aa
</p>
<p>superior beings, and professing themselves to be followers of the
</p>
<p>Saviour.
</p>
<p>The last of the seven wars was instigated by <^reat Britain du-
</p>
<p>ring the Revolution.
</p>
<p>By the treaty of Paris in 1763, Canada was secured to Great
</p>
<p>Britain, and when the Revolutionary war commenced, Lord Suf-
</p>
<p>folk, in the House of -Peers, undertook to defend the employment
</p>
<p>of the Indians, in the war. His lordship contended, that besides
</p>
<p>its policy and necessity, the measure was also allowable on princi-
</p>
<p>ple, for that, " it was perfectly justifiable to use all the means

</p>
<p>that 0-od and nature put into our hands to subdue America."
</p>
<p>" I AM ASTONISHED! (exclaimed Lord Chatham, as he rose)
</p>
<p>shocked ! to hear such principles confessed, to hear them avowed
</p>
<p>in this house, or in this country principles equally uncon-
</p>
<p>stitutional, inhuman and unchristian. Spain armed herself
</p>
<p>with blood-hounds to extirpate the wretched natives of America ;
</p>
<p>and we improve on the inhuman example even of Spanish
</p>
<p>cruelty; we turn loose these savage hell-hounds against our
</p>
<p>brethren and countrymen in America, of the same language,
</p>
<p>laws, liberties and religion, and endeared to us by every tie that
</p>
<p>should sanctify humanity."
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this protest, the Indians continued to be em-
</p>
<p>ployed, and all the horrible consequences realized.
</p>
<p>But, with all the means which God and nature had put into her
</p>
<p>hands, after spending seven hundred and fifty millions of dol-
</p>
<p>lars and at the loss of hundreds of thousands of her best men,
</p>
<p>she lost her hold upon us as English colonies, and was obliged
</p>
<p>to acknowledge our independence to the world, but never for a
</p>
<p>moment giving up the idea, that she would, at some future time,
</p>
<p>regain her dominion over us ; or at least, over the New Eng-
</p>
<p>land States.
</p>
<p>To accomplish this, it was necessary that her whole policy should
</p>
<p>be changed, not only here but elsewhere.
</p>
<p>With a superabundant and starving population which she must
</p>
<p>keep employed in manufacturing and commercial pursuits, England
</p>
<p>felt no intersst in the colonists, except as customers for her mer-
</p>
<p>chandise.
</p>
<p>There were magnificent ideas about the extent of commercial ex-
</p>
<p>change as the population increased, and all the restrictions upon
</p>
<p>the commerce, navigation, and manufactures of the colonies, were
</p>
<p>imposed with the intention t)f confining the national industry to
</p>
<p>agriculture, or to make us the producers of food and of raw ma-
</p>
<p>terials to be manufactured in England.
</p>
<p>While we were British Colonies, every vessel launched and
</p>
<p>every sail flung to the winds was an addition to the maritime
</p>
<p>strength of England ; but when she lost her hold upon us our po-
</p>
<p>sition was entirely changed.
</p>
<p>She has been called mistress of the seas, and a choice saying of
</p>
<p>Englishmen has been " the sea is ours." To retain this position,
</p>
<p>every thing must be done to prevent the commerce of America
</p>
<p>from coming into competition with the commerce of England. To
</p>
<p>accomplish this it was essential that the East India trade should
</p>
<p>be extended; and as the most effectual mode of producing this
</p>
<p>desirable result, the slave trade must be broken up.
</p>
<p>By the Assiento of 1713, a company of English merchants un-
</p>
<p>dertook to supply the Spanish American Colonies with negro slaves

</p>
<p>for thirty years. It soon passed into the hands of the English
</p>
<p>government, and was vested in the South Sea Company.
</p>
<p>By the twelfth article of the treaty of Utrecht, this Assiento
</p>
<p>was confirmed, by which the Royal African Company gave to
</p>
<p>Spain 200,000 crowns, and to the King of Spain and Queen of
</p>
<p>England, each, one quarter share in the profits of their trade.
</p>
<p>Finding this trade exceedingly profitable it was extended to the
</p>
<p>British Colonies much against the will of the people, both North
</p>
<p>and South.
</p>
<p>About this time, Queen Anne directed the colonial government
</p>
<p>of New York "to take care that the Almighty should be devout-
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>ly and duly served according to the rites of tho Church of Eng-
</p>
<p>land, and also, that the Royal African Company should be encour-
</p>
<p>aged, and that the colony should have a constant and sufficient
</p>
<p>supply of merchantable negroes at moderate rates."
</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that English interest forced slavery upon
</p>
<p>us. A want of laborers combined with an enervating climate,
</p>
<p>made it a permanent institution at the South, where the slaves
</p>
<p>thrived, whereas at the North, a cool bracing climate enabled the
</p>
<p>white man to labor, while the slave, shivering with cold, was soon
</p>
<p>frozen out. Besides being unprofitable in the North, there was
</p>
<p>more or less aversion on the part of the New Englanders to hold-
</p>
<p>ing slaves. This too was the ease in the South until it was de-
</p>
<p>monstrated beyond question, that white laborers could not endure
</p>
<p>the heat of the climate.
</p>
<p>From the first dawn of maritime enterprise in Great Britian,
</p>
<p>the trade of India was contemplated as its grandest object. Into
</p>
<p>the sanguine conceptions formed on the subject much illusion en-
</p>
<p>tered ; yet there were circumstances which, even at that early stage
</p>
<p>of mercantile adventure, threw peculiar lustre on the trade of
</p>
<p>India, enhanced, no doubt, by the remembrance of the immense
</p>
<p>wealth brought by the ships of Solomon from Ophir, supposed to
</p>
<p>be India.
</p>
<p>All that had been done in the trade up to the year 1600, was by
</p>
<p>private enterprise. At this time a company was chartered and
</p>
<p>rechartered at various times until 1773, when the East India bill
</p>
<p>was passed, placing the affairs in the hands of the Government.
</p>
<p>England saw that if she could exchange her maaufactures for
</p>
<p>the tropical products of India, she could still command the sea and
</p>
<p>its commerce, because she would find a market in every sea-
</p>
<p>port.
</p>
<p>To accomplish this, she must be able to undersell all the world.
</p>
<p>Profitable as the slave trade had been and still was, it must be
</p>
<p>sacrificed to prevent the Spanish American colonies, Brazil and
</p>
<p>the United States, from underselling England in foreign markets.

</p>
<p>This could only be done by cutting off the the supply of laborers.
</p>
<p>Sir Robert Peel said, the East Indian could not successfully com-
</p>
<p>pete with the American slave.
</p>
<p>But England dare not avow her motives even at home, as too
</p>
<p>much capital was invested in the slave trade. To conceal her
</p>
<p>real intentions, the mask of religion and philanthropy was put on.
</p>
<p>The proposition to abolish the slave trade was brought up, discuss-
</p>
<p>ed, and voted down, time after time, in the British Parliament,
</p>
<p>until 1807, when it was finally abolished.
</p>
<p>When England found that breaking up the slave trade would
</p>
<p>not cripple our commerce as she hoped, she commenced a system
</p>
<p>of outrageous aggressions upon our shipping. Her spies were
</p>
<p>scattered over the country, gathering up all the information that
</p>
<p>could be made available, as well as sowing dissensions among the
</p>
<p>people. And in 1809, while peaceful negotiations were in pro-
</p>
<p>gress to settle the difficulties between the two nations, Sir James
</p>
<p>IL Craig, then Governor General of the British provinces in
</p>
<p>North America, employed Captain J. Henry as a secret agent or
</p>
<p>spy to go to Boston and enter into negotiations with those op-
</p>
<p>posed to the Government. In his letter of instruction he says :
</p>
<p>" It has been supposed that if the Federalists of the Eastern States
</p>
<p>should be successful in obtaining that decided influence which may
</p>
<p>enable them to direct the public opinion, it is not improbable that,
</p>
<p>rather than submit to a continuance of the difficulties and distress
</p>
<p>to which they are now subject, they will exert that influence to
</p>
<p>bring about a separation from the general union. The earliest
</p>
<p>information on this subject may be of great consequence to our
</p>
<p>government, as it may also be, that it should be informed how far,
</p>
<p>in such an event, they would look to England for assistance or be
</p>
<p>disposed to enter into a connection with us."
</p>
<p>Henry went to Burlington, Vermont, where he says : "I have
</p>
<p>remained two days in order fully to ascertain the progress of the
</p>
<p>arrangements heretofore made for organizing an efficient opposi-
</p>
<p>ion to the General Government." And the Governor makes no
</p>
<p>secret of his determination, as commander-in-chief of the militia,
</p>
<p>to refuse obedience to any command from the General Govern-
</p>
<p>ment which can tend to interrupt the good understanding that
</p>
<p>prevails between the citizens of Vermont and his majesty's sub-
</p>
<p>jects in Canada."
</p>
<p>In the eastern part of the state, secession was not so popular.
</p>
<p>Henry went to Boston and there found so many opposed to the
</p>
<p>general government and so communicative, that he obtained all
</p>
<p>the information necessary, without being obliged to produce his
</p>
<p>credentials.
</p>
<p>He says "it does not appear necessary that I should discover
</p>
<p>to any person the purpose of my visit to Boston. I nave suffi-
</p>
<p>cient means of information to enable me to judge of the proper

<p>period for offering the co-operation of Great Britain, and opening
</p>
<p>correspondence between the Governor General of British America
</p>
<p>and those individuals who, from the part they take in the oppo-
</p>
<p>sition to the National Government, or the influence they may pos-
</p>
<p>sess in any new order of things that may grow out of the present
</p>
<p>differences, should be qualified to act on behalf of the Northern
</p>
<p>States."
</p>
<p>A few extracts from this correspondence, which is quite lengthy,
</p>
<p>will be sufficient to show the design of the mission.
</p>
<p>" With regard to Great Britain, she can scarce mistake her
</p>
<p>true policy in relation to America. If peace be the first object,
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>every act which can irritate the maritime states ought to be avoi-
</p>
<p>ded ; because the prevailing disposition of these will generally be
</p>
<p>sufficient to keep the Government from hazarding any hostile
</p>
<p>measure. If a war between America and France be a grand de-
</p>
<p>sideratum, something more must be done, an indulgent conciliatory
</p>
<p>policy must be adopted, which will leave the democrats without a
</p>
<p>pretext for hostilities; and Bonaparte, whose passions are too
</p>
<p>hot for delay, will probably compel this government to decide
</p>
<p>which of the two great belligerents is to be its enemy.
</p>
<p>To bring about a separation of the States under distinct and
</p>
<p>independent governments, is an affair of more uncertainty ; and
</p>
<p>however desirable, cannot be effected but by a series of acts and long
</p>
<p>continued policy, tending to irritate the Southern and conciliate
</p>
<p>the Northern people. The former are agricultural, the latter a
</p>
<p>commercial people. The mode of cheering and depressing either
</p>
<p>is too obvious to require illustration. This, I am aware, is an
</p>
<p>object of much interest in Great Britain, as it would forever secure
</p>
<p>the integrity of his majesty's possessions on the continent, and
</p>
<p>make the two governments, or whatever number the present con-
</p>
<p>federacy might form into, as useful and as much subject to the
</p>
<p>influence of Great Britain as her colonies can be rendered. But
</p>
<p>it is an object only to be attained by slow and circumspect pro-
</p>
<p>gression, and requires for its consummation more attention to the
</p>
<p>affairs which agitate and excite parties in this country, than
</p>
<p>Great Britain has yet bestowed upon it."
</p>
<p>" It should, therefore, be the peculiar care of Great Britain, to
</p>
<p>foster division between the North and the South ; and by succeed-
</p>
<p>ing in this, she may carry into effect her own projects in Europe
</p>
<p>with a total disregard to the resentment of the democrats of this
</p>
<p>country/' "A war would produce an incurable alienation, of the
</p>
<p>Eastern States and bring the whole country in subordination to
</p>
<p>the interest of England, whose navy would prescribe and enforce
</p>
<p>the terms upon which the commercial states should carry, and the
</p>
<p>agricultural states export their surplus produce." Should war be

<p>declared, the legislature of Massachusetts will give the tone to
</p>
<p>the neighbouring states ; will declare itself permanent until a new
</p>
<p>election of members ; invite a congress, to be composed of dele-
</p>
<p>gates from the Federal states, and erect a separate government
</p>
<p>for their common defence and common interest."
</p>
<p>"This congress would probably begin, by abrogating the offen-
</p>
<p>sive laws and adopting a plan for the maintenance of the power
</p>
<p>and authority thus assumed. They would, by such an act, be in a
</p>
<p>condition to make or receive proposals from Great Britain, and I
</p>
<p>should seize the first moment to open a correspondence with your

<p>the House of Lords, Lord Holland asked for information j o'h a*
</p>
<p>topic of great importance, because it affected" 5 the honor, of the'
</p>
<p>country, and moved that the documents be produced to disprove
</p>
<p>any agency on the part of the government in'the transactions,-
</p>
<p>but it was opposed by Lord Liverpool, who excused the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment of Canada as only desiring information, &c. Earl Gray,
</p>
<p>after refering to these excuses said, he would 1 grant that all this'
</p>
<p>gave Sir J. Craig a right to assemble troops, to repair fortifica-
</p>
<p>tions, to establish depots, and ! collect provisions and what was

<p>necessary for a campaign; but it did not give him a right to en-'

<p>After considerable debate, the mbtion' was lostj the papers"

<p>To show what was thought of this affair in England, the fol-
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>lowing extract from the London Statesman of April 29th, 1812,
</p>
<p>is inserted :
</p>
<p>" It will be seen by the allusion made last night, in both houses of Parliament
</p>
<p>to the message of Mr. Madison, and the documents accompanying it, laid before
</p>
<p>tbe Congress of the United States, that the base attempt to subvert the govern-
</p>
<p>ment of that country, by exciting a rebellion amongst the American people^ was
</p>
<p>neither attempted to be denied or excused by ministers but, said Lord Liver-
</p>
<p>pool, I solemnly disclaim for myself and for his majesty's government, any in-
</p>
<p>tention whatever, of fomenting disturbances in these States. As to the employ-
</p>
<p>ment of any individual, it was entirely unauthorized by me and even without my
</p>
<p>knowledge. Government did no-t even know that Captain Henry was employed,
</p>
<p>until after his return to Quebec." Now supposing every word which Lord Liver-
</p>
<p>pool uttered to be true, we would ask why Sir James Craig, on whose shoulders
</p>
<p>ministers now wish to throw the blame of this perfidious transaction, has not
</p>
<p>only been permitted to go at large unimpeached, but has actually been promoted
</p>
<p>in our service? Does not this conduct show, on the part of our Government,
</p>
<p>that they highly approve of every step which that General took to overturn the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the American States? It is impossible to doubt it; and therefore,
</p>
<p>whatever solemn protestations ministers may now make to the contrary, they
</p>
<p>must be held as implicated in this abominable affair as those individuals only
</p>
<p>who are responsible to the nation which they have so grossly insulted, and on
</p>
<p>whose heads ought to fall that just retribution for the crime which they have
</p>
<p>committed. But if such are the conclusions we are entitled to draw from this
</p>
<p>relative state of the parties, what are the inhabitants of Great Britain to think ;
</p>
<p>nay, what is the continent, the whole universe, to say if we shall be able to prove
</p>
<p>by the most undeniable evidence that ministers not, only knew of the employ-
</p>
<p>ment of Captain Henry before he was engaged in the iniquitous mission, but that
</p>
<p>Lord Liverpool himself, afterwards actually and unreservedly approved of it ?
</p>
<p>That we are able to do this, we feel little difficulty, even with the few documents
</p>
<p>which are now before the public.
</p>
<p>It appears that Captain Henry was employed by Sir James Craig in 1808, to
</p>
<p>ascertain the state of parties and their political views in the United States.
</p>
<p>The correspondence which passed at this time between Sir James Craig and the

<p>Captain, was transmitted by the former to the British minister. This is proved
</p>
<p>by the following extract of a letter, dated 28th of June last, written by Mr.
</p>
<p>Peel, Lord Liverpool's secretary, to- Henry himself r who was then in London :
</p>
<p>" His lordship has directed me to acquaint you, that he has referred to the cor-
</p>
<p>respondence in this office of the year 1808, and finds two letters from Sir James
</p>
<p>Craig, dated 10th April and 5th May, transmitting the correspondence that has
</p>
<p>passed during your residence in the northern states of America, and expressing
</p>
<p>his confidence in your ability and judgment." Here then, is direct proof, that
</p>
<p>the attempts made in 1808, by Captain Henry, at the instigation of the Governor
</p>
<p>General of Canada, to excite commotions in the United States, were well known
</p>
<p>to ministers at that period. Circumstances having rendered it probale in the
</p>
<p>year 1809, that something further might be done to promote this very honorable
</p>
<p>cause, Sir James Craig appears to have had some further communication with
</p>
<p>the present ministers on the subject, and again to have recommended Captain
</p>
<p>Henry as a fit person to- carry their views into effect. The result of this was,
</p>
<p>that Sir James directed his secretary to write Captain Henry, on the 26th of
</p>
<p>January, 1809, as follows: "The information and political observations hereto-
</p>
<p>fore received from you, were transmitted by his excellency to the Secretary of
</p>
<p>State, who has expressed his particular approbation of them and there is no doubt
</p>
<p>that your able execution of such a mission as I have above suggested, would
</p>
<p>give you a claim not only on the governor-general, but on his majesty's ministers,
</p>
<p>which might eventually contribute to your advantage." Who can'doubt, after
</p>
<p>reading this, that all his majesty's ministers, and particularly Lord Liverpool
</p>
<p>then Secretary of State, were fully acquainted with the mission of Captain Henry,
</p>
<p>and that they actually instructed Sir James Craig to hold out to him a reward
</p>
<p>for his services ? But the matter does not rest here. After Captain Henry ar-
</p>
<p>rived in London-, and submitted his claims for remuneration to Lord Liverpool,
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>his lordship, in the abovo letter, which he directed his secretary, Mr. Peel, to
</p>
<p>write, expressly recognizes the services of the captain. He speaks of the abil-
</p>
<p>ity and success" with which he executed the mission, and states, that "he is
</p>
<p>convinced the public service will be benefitted" by his active employment in a
</p>
<p>public situation. In another letter in the handwriting of Lord Liverpool, ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to Sir George Prevost, now governor-general of Canada, on the 16th of
</p>
<p>September last, he says : " I now fulfil the assurance which I have given of
</p>
<p>stating to you my opinion of the ability and judgment which Mr. Henry has mani-
</p>
<p>fested on the occasions mentioned in the memorial, and of the benefit the public
</p>
<p>service might derive from his active employment in any public situation in which
</p>
<p>you should think proper to place him." Here Lord Liverpool's entire approba-
</p>
<p>tion of all that Captain Henry had done, is fixed beyond the possibility of a
</p>
<p>doubt."
</p>
<p>When the subject was under consideration in Congress, it was
</p>
<p>asserted, that Mr. Erskine, former British Minister, was engaged
</p>
<p>in the same business at the same time.
</p>
<p>The aggressions continued, and both countries were in the
</p>
<p>greatest distress ; meetings were held in Birmingham and other
</p>
<p>manufacturing towns, deprecating the action of the British min-
</p>
<p>istry ; and from Birmingham, a deputation was sent to Mr. Per-
</p>
<p>ceval, (Lord Liverpool,) for the purpose of representing to him
</p>
<p>the distressed condition of the district, and stating that, unless
</p>
<p>something was done, seventy thousand persons would be thrown
</p>
<p>out of employment, and of these, fifty thousand were employed in
</p>
<p>preparing goods for the American market. Mr. Perceval said
</p>
<p>he was fully aware of the distressed state of the manufacturers,
</p>
<p>but being as fully convinced of the benefits accruing to the coun-
</p>
<p>try at large from the orders in council, he could not from any con-
</p>
<p>sideration of partial distress alter his opinion. Another of the
</p>
<p>ministry said, after listening to their representations, " it does
</p>
<p>not signify, gentlemen, we are like two men with our heads in a
</p>
<p>bucket of water, and we must see which can stand drowning tho
</p>
<p>longest."

<p>One of the resolutions passed at the meeting at Birmingjiam,
</p>
<p>was this :
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the direct tendency of the orders in council, is
</p>
<p>to force America upon her own resources, and to oblige her to
</p>
<p>become a manufacturing nation much earlier than in the natural
</p>
<p>course of events, would be the case."
</p>
<p>While these things were going on, the Indians in Canada and on
</p>
<p>the frontier of the Western States, were supplied by English emis-
</p>
<p>saries with arms and ammunition and presents of various kinds, to
</p>
<p>induce them to take up arms against the Americans.
</p>
<p>At last, when forbearance ceased to be a virtue, war was de-
</p>
<p>clared.
</p>
<p>There are hundreds alive to-day in the west, who can tell how
</p>
<p>the English agents succeeded in employing the Indians, and how
</p>
<p>faithfully they obeyed. At Maiden, Canada, a bounty was paid
</p>
<p>for scalps, and every encouragement held out to make the Indiana
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>wore savage than they would have been. The conduct of Proctor,
</p>
<p>after the battle of the river Raisin, stamps him as an inhuman
</p>
<p>monster or the base hireling x?f a barbarous government.

</p>
<p>In the mean time, secession was gaining ground, and as speci-
</p>
<p>mens of the feeling that existed, the following extracts from
</p>
<p>newspapers of that date are sufficient :
</p>
<p>"SALEM, August Wth, 1812.
</p>
<p>" Great Britain has never don,e us any injury . We were fools in 1776, and are
</p>
<p>knaves in 1812, for quarrelling with her. She is fighting for the liberties and
</p>
<p>fhe religion of the world."
</p>
<p>" HARTFORD, July 30* A.
</p>
<p>"It is pnly by the forbearance of Great Britain, that a single herring is per-
</p>
<p>njitted tp enter Chesapeake Bay."
</p>
<p>Secession in the New England States, culminated on the 15th
</p>
<p>pf December, 1814, when the delegates from the several state
</p>
<p>Legislatures met at Hartford, to consider the grievances of the
</p>
<p>people Qcpasionecf by a state of war, and to devise speedy meas-
</p>
<p>ures for its, (termination. 5?he sessions of the convention were se-
</p>
<p>cret, and wjjatjeyier plaps may jiave b.een formed for secession or
</p>
<p>disunion, they ^ere rendered abortive by the declaration of peace,
</p>
<p>soon after its adjournment.
</p>
<p>Whenever an opportunity occurred during the war, the Eng-
</p>

</p>
<p>West Indies, and spld them.
</p>
<p>Emissaries were sent to the south among the Seminole and
</p>
<p>C/reek Indians, to iucite tfyem to hostilities, and among the slaves,
</p>
<p>to induce them to rebel.
</p>
<p>This policy was kept up for several years, and it finally brought

</p>
<p>This feeing a wor]f pf timp, required greater caution as well as
</p>
<p>cunning. To get up a question that would irritate the South and
</p>
<p>conciliate tfee nprth, was easily done, as there had already been
</p>
<p>considerable agitation with regard to the slave trade. This was
</p>
<p>pasily accomplished by using the British Association for the abc-
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>iition of the slave $rade, which held its meetings in the Old Jewry,,
</p>
<p>and afterwards in Exeter Hall, London. This was the grand
</p>
<p>fountain head, and still continues to be. Millions of money and
</p>
<p>scores of agents have been sent from jfcfris society to the Uni-
</p>
<p>ted States, where they found people who, Arnold-like, were wil-
</p>
<p>ling for gold, to aid in sowing the seeds of discord.
</p>
<p>Mr. Seward tells us, that Johij .Q, Adams originated the politi-
</p>
<p>cal anti-slavery movement in this country.
</p>
<p>A living witness., General Buff Green, confirms this statement
</p>
<p>and furnishes the following valuable link in the chain of evidence.
</p>
<p>" John Quincy Adams was one of the commissioners at Ghent,
</p>
<p>(in Belgium,) and as such, signed the treaty of peace between the
</p>
<p>United States and Great Britain, the eleventh article of which,
</p>
<p>pledged the United States to unite with England in abolishing
</p>
<p>u the traffic in slaves ;" he was afterwards our minister in London,
</p>
<p>where he was intimate with Clarkson and Wilberforce, In 1816,
</p>
<p>Daniel Pope Cook of Illinois, was appointed bearer of despatches
</p>
<p>to notify him of his appointment as Secretary of State, and told
</p>
<p>me, that upon his return he intended to remove to the South. In
</p>
<p>October of 1817, I saw him in this city, and he then told me that
</p>
<p>he had relinquished his purpose of going South, because Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams had satisfied him that the migration to the Territories
</p>
<p>north of the Ohio would be so great, as soon to ^nable the
</p>
<p>free States to control the political destiny of this country, and
</p>
<p>that instead of going South he was, under the advice of Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams, going back to Illinois, with a view to coming to Con-
</p>
<p>gress for the purpose of agitating the slavery question. He
</p>
<p>said that he had already commenced the agitation by a series
</p>
<p>of letters published in Mead's Register, and handed me $
</p>
<p>pamphlet containing them. These letters, written at the sugr
</p>
<p>gestion of Mr. Adams, give the basis of the anti-slavery agita*
</p>
<p>tion from that datp until now. I thus trace this treasonable
</p>
<p>movement to Mr. Adams, for Mr. Cook did go to Illinois, and was

</p>
<p>elected to Congress, and, although it does not so appear on the
</p>
<p>record, was in truth, the person through whom Mr. Adams made
</p>
<p>the movement in opposition to the admission of Missouri, which
</p>
<p>resulted in the Missouri compromise."
</p>
<p>Here a degenerate son of a patriot father, for political^prefer*-
</p>
<p>ment, listens to the pounsels of the bitterest enemies of his counr
</p>
<p>try, and 'allows himsejf to fee used as the instrument for hia
</p>
<p>country's destruction?
</p>
<p>The people thought the Missouri Compromise had settled tne
</p>
<p>question, and it was supposed by the South that she had achieved
</p>
<p>a victory ; a line had been drawn over which the North could not
</p>
<p>come to molest her. With this adjustment of the question she
</p>
<p>was content ; and the people of the North, with the exception of
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>n few ultra abolitionists, were willing to abide by this compromise.
</p>
<p>This, however, was not what the British Government desired.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sumner in his speech of June 4, 1860, in the Senate says :
</p>
<p>u At a period when the ardors of the Missouri question had given
</p>
<p>~way to indifference throughout the North, William Lloyd Garri-
</p>
<p>son stepped forward to denounce it. After wrrds, January 1,
</p>
<p>1881, he published the first number of the Liberator, in which he
</p>
<p>4 declared, in the face of surrounding apathy, "I am in earnest."
</p>
<p>Here, even in Boston, a state of indifference and apathy exis-
</p>
<p>ted. ; Soon after this the country was flooded with circulars,
</p>
<p>handbills, and pamphlets, but the people paid little attention to
</p>
<p>them* Spices and various other articles of family use, put up
</p>
<p>and surrounded with incendiary wrappings, were scattered through
</p>
<p>the South, and every means resorted to that the subject should
</p>
<p>be kept before the people. Does any one suppose that all this
</p>
<p>was done by the handful of abolitionists at the North ? By no
</p>
<p>means ; the case was becoming desperate. Instead of disunion,
</p>
<p>the Union was growing stronger; money was poured into the
</p>
<p>country, and converts were made to abolitionism, but the mass of
</p>
<p>the people remained indifferent.
</p>
<p>Prosperity and abundance were so apparently the growth of
</p>
<p>free institutions, that Canada began to look to the time when she
</p>
<p>too would throw off the yoke.
</p>
<p>In 1833 an act was passed by the British Parliament abolish-
</p>
<p>ing slavery in^he British Colonies and appropriating 20,000,000
</p>
<p>pounds sterling, (or $100^000,000) for the purchase of the slaves,
</p>
<p>and to encourage them to take care of themselves.*
</p>
<p>By this act, Canada was made the grand asylum in which pious
</p>
<p>abolitionists established their depot for the under ground rail-
</p>
<p>road. What a burlesque upon morality, for men to rob their
</p>
<p>neighbors, and pretend that it is all for the glory of God.
</p>
<p>A few months ago the London times said ; "for all the good
</p>
<p>that appropriation had done the money had better been thrown

</p>
<p>price, the price of English taxation and English toil. He has
</p>
<p>been redeemed from bondage by the sweat and travail of some
</p>
<p>millions of hard working Englishmen. One hundred millions of
</p>
<p>dollars have been distilled from the brains and muscles of the free
</p>
<p>English laborer, of every degree, to fashioa the West Indian ne-
</p>

<p>Mr. Sidney E. Morse, a gentleman of intelligence and integrity,

</p>
<p>in the following communication to the editor of Harper's Weekly,
</p>
<p>gives a clear explanation of the objects of the British Government
</p>
<p>in the West India Emancipation ;
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1853 the writer met in Paris the late Mr. AARON LEGGKTT, for-
</p>
<p>merly a wealthy merchant in this city, and a member of the Society of Frienda.
</p>
<p>We conversed frequently on the political prospects of our country as affected by
</p>
<p>the agitation of the Slavery question. Mr. L. said, that when he was a young
</p>
<p>man, he was an active and zealous member of a Manumission Society, and'
</p>
<p>that he continued to cherish in after life a very compassionate' feeling for the poor
</p>
<p>negroes. At the time of the general emancipation of the slave* in the British
</p>
<p>West Indies Mr. Leggett r s business called him to the citj of Mexico, and while
</p>
<p>residing there he met Deputy Commissary-General WILSON, of the British Army,
</p>
<p>an agent appointed by the British Government to make the financial arrangements
</p>
<p>connected with the payment to the West India slaveholders of their portion of the
</p>
<p>20,000,0000 voted by the British Parliament as a compensation fcr the forced
</p>
<p>sacrifice of their property.
</p>
<p>_ Mr. LEGGETT said that, when he learned Mr. WILSON'S errand', Ee took occa-
</p>
<p>sion, while he was sitting with him one day after dinner,, to express hi : s admira-
</p>
<p>tion of the British Government and the British people, for that noble act, the
</p>

</p>
<p>full utterance to his feelings, and almost exhausted the vocabulary of eulogy to
</p>
<p>rhen
</p>
<p>... that
</p>
<p>this emancipation of the negroes will prove to be a WISE measure?'
</p>
<p>" Certainly I replied," said Mr. L. * How can it be otherwise ?"
</p>
<p>" The cool heads in England," said Mr. Wilson, " do not think that it will be
</p>
<p>beneficial in its effects on the interests of the people either in the colonies or in
</p>
<p>the mother country. Nor do I think so. We thinTc that the freed negroes ivill do
</p>
<p>very little work ; and that the West India colonies; as to their commercial value to the
</p>
<p>mother country, will be ruined f

<p>Mr. Leggett had been carried away with the representations of the enthusiatic

<p>friends of emancipation that free labor was more productive than slave labor;'

<p>that when the negroes were free they would receive wages, and that this would

</p>
<p>wo-uld 1 feel the benefit of the new impulse to agriculture ; that land's would rise in
</p>
<p>value ; that the income of the planters would be increased, etc. ; and his ardor
</p>
<p>was at first cooled by Mr. Wilson's gloemy view of the case.
</p>
<p>" After a little reflection, however," said Mr. L., " I continued' my eulogy of
</p>
<p>the British Government and the British people ; and I now went further than be-
</p>
<p>fore in the expressions of my admiration, but I went on a new tack. I said that
</p>
<p>the enemies of Englishmen, and of their government, were accustomed to represent
</p>
<p>them as always governed by mercenary considerations, and too willing to sac-
</p>
<p>rifice justice, humanity, and all the virtues, to the lust- of gain ; but here was a;
</p>
<p>case in which the cool heads that directed the action of the Government delibe-
</p>
<p>rately burdened their country with an inmensedebt, not to open new fields of wealth,
</p>
<p>but in full' prospect of destroying the commercial value of their West India 1 colo-
</p>
<p>nies, and of impoverishing the people there, and the proprietors in England and)
</p>
<p>all from a humane feeling, and a high sense of justice a high sense of what is
</p>
<p>due to poor; helples, down-trodden negro slaves. It was the noblest act recorded,
</p>
<p>in history ! I knew of no parallel to it anywhere."
</p>
<p>' When I had finished," added Mr. L., "Mr. W. again turned tome, and said,
</p>
<p>* Mr. Leggett, do you really believe that the men w'ho control the action of the British
</p>
<p>government were led by such motives as you ascribe to them, to sacrifice the commercial
</p>
<p>interests of their country ?' "
</p>
<p>" I repliid," said Mr. L., " that if th men who controlled the action of the
</p>
<p>British government really believed that the abolition of slavery in the British
</p>
<p>West Indies would end in the commercial ruin of the islands, I could not conceive
</p>
<p>of any other motive for their conduct than the noble one which I had assigned. ""
</p>
<p>" Well Mr. Leggett,' said Mr. W., you may believe thU, but I do not. /
</p>
<p>i6
</p>
<p>btlieve thai the action of the British government is in'dde to prom'ote,- as far as possible,
</p>
<p>tht INTERESTS of the English Aristocracy."
</p>
<p>Mr. L. then asked, What interest of the English Aristocracy Will be' promo-
</p>
<p>ted by the ruin of the British West India Islands ?"
</p>
<p>jfihr. Wilson said that the ab' blit'ibri' of slavery in the British colonies would
</p>
<p>naturally create ati enthusiastic qiiti-slavery sentiriient in England ari'd America,
</p>
<p>a'nd that in America this would & prbc8"ST of time, excite si hostility between the
</p>
<p>fr*ee States and the sla^e States, Whicli wbUld end' ift a; dissdltftiorf of the American
</p>
<p>tlnibh,- and the c"ons v equent' failure" of tWgr'atiti eipferiment' oi* democratic 'govern-
</p>
<p>ment ; and that tn'e ruin of DembtJrae'y in 1 ^mterica Would be the perpetuation of
</p>
<p>Aristocracy in .England. I db'nbt undertake to give the language of Mr! Leggett,-
</p>
<p>but the" following paraphrase (JonVeys,- in my own language, th'e inVpfessiqri made"
</p>
<p>upon my mind 1 bf the course of reasbninjg' by which Mr. W. came to nlief con-
</p>
<p>clusion.
</p>
<p>" The English 1 Aristocracy have ruled England for ages . Their pbsftibii'is more
</p>
<p>enviable than that of any .similar claSs in' any other country on the globe'. They
</p>
<p>rule the wealthiest empire in the world. Their land' estates" embrace a' large
</p>
<p>portion of all the lands' in the 1 kingdom ; : a'nd these estate* are entailed in their
</p>
<p>families. The House of Lords is' composed exclusively of the Aristocracy ; and
</p>
<p>they have such influence in the elections that the members of the Etouse of Com-
</p>
<p>mons are to a great extent the' near relatives of the Lords. Offices of honor
</p>
<p>arid power, and sinecure offices with large incomes', in the Church, the Army, the
</p>
<p>Navy, the Colonies, at Foreign courts, andin'allthe departments of Home govern-
</p>
<p>ment, are in 1 their gift, and can be bestowed at their pleasure, upon their relatives
</p>
<p>and friends. They have inherited these privileges from their ancestors, and their
</p>
<p>great aim, their' ruling desire, is to retain them in their 1 families, arid to transmit
</p>
<p>them to theft posterity. Their control of the public press, and of all the fountains
</p>
<p>bf popular opinion and sentiment ia England, has enabled them to impress the
</p>
<p>minds of the great oody bf the middle classes there with the belief that the English
</p>
<p>Aristocracy, with its powers" arid privileges, is essential to the prosperity and glory
</p>
<p>bf the English nation.
</p>
<p>"Recently, h'bwever, this"belief'has been seriously shaken by the success of demo-
</p>
<p>cratic institutiobtf in America. Englishmen are now getting to be well aquainted

<p>with America:' arid they see there a people of the same race with themselves, speak-
</p>
<p>ing the same language, reading the same bboks, holding' the same religious opinions,
</p>
<p>loving the same pursuits ; in shott, like theinselves in 1 every respect except that
</p>
<p>they have no aristocracy ; and yet, under their democratic institutions, Americans
</p>
<p>are advancing eVen more rapidly than Englishmen; iri cbminerce and the arts, in
</p>
<p>the diffusibn of knowledge ambrig the people, in population, wealth, and all the
</p>
<p>elements of national greatness; and intelligent men of the middle classes in En.
</p>
<p>gland are beginriing to think that Aristocracy, with its heavy taxation for the sup-
</p>
<p>port of sinecure offibes, may not be so essential as they have heretofore supposed
</p>
<p>to the prosperity of England;' arid that the English people would perhaps make more
</p>
<p>rapid progress if they dhquld'throw off this burden, by republicanizing or Ameri-
</p>
<p>danizihg 1 theii* institutions . The great danger to the English Aristocracy lies in
</p>
<p>this idea in the minds of the English people ; for, if it should take root and spread,
</p>
<p>it might end in a revolution in which they would lose all their privileges.. Hence
</p>
<p>they study every thing in America and in England with the deepest interest in its
</p>
<p>Bearings on this matter.
</p>
<p>" The English Aristocracy know that the English people are a liberty-loving, a
</p>
<p>liberty- vaunting people. They saw with what ease numerously-signed petitions
</p>
<p>for the Abolition of Slavery could be obtained in districts, and among classes,
</p>
<p>Where there was no interest to cheek the current of the popular feeling. They knew
</p>
<p>that they could have found no difficulty in disposing of such petitions in Parliament
</p>
<p>without granting them, forthey' could have continued to receive them respectfully, and
</p>
<p>postpone action upon them endlessly , if their interest had required it. But after a
</p>
<p>time they, doubtless, reasoned with themselves, thus :
</p>
<p>1 * What will be the effect of encouraging and finally granting these petitions ?
</p>
<p>If Slavery shall be abolished in the Britisk'colonies, by compensating slaveholders
</p>
<p>for their losses, nobody in England will then have any interest in opposing the
</p>
<p>wildest and most enthusiastic expressions of anti-Slavery sentiment . Englishmen
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>will love to refer with pride and boasting to the large sum sacrificed by their
</p>
<p>government, with their concurrence, on the altar of liberty, juatice, and human-
</p>
<p>ity. They will then look to America, and they will see Slavery still there, for
</p>
<p>Southern slaveholders in America, of course, will never ruin themselves and their
</p>
<p>country by imitating Britain in abolishing it. Englishmen can then be easily ex-
</p>
<p>cited, on account of American Slavery, to look down with scorn upon Americans
</p>
<p>and American institutions; and if any popular orator, or writer, in Endand shall
</p>
<p>propose to deprive the Aristocracy of their powers and privileges, and, to fortify
</p>
<p>his argument, shall refer to the prosperity of America under democratic institu-
</p>
<p>tions, he will be met with this scorn, and defeated in his purpose.'
</p>
<p>" This will be the effect in England of the abolition of Slavery in the British
</p>
<p>colonies ; but the most important effect will be the effect in America. America
</p>
<p>is divided almost equally between free States and Slave States; between States
</p>
<p>in which the negroes are so few that no harm results from their emancipation,
</p>
<p>and States in which Slavery is so deeply rooied that it can not be safely abolished
</p>
<p>without ruin to all classes of the population. In the free State*, a fierce anti-
</p>
<p>slavery sentiment, a bitter hatred of Slavery and Slaveholders, can be excited al-
</p>
<p>most as easily as in England, and, in process of time, by constantly fanning i uo
</p>
<p>flame, puch a hos'iiity can be kindled between the people of the two great sections
</p>
<p>that it will lead to the destruction of the American Union, and the failure of tht>
</p>
<p>grand experiment of democratic government by men of the Anglo-Saxon race.
</p>
<p>And 'his failure of Democracy in America, will be a new leasCj and a long lease,
</p>
<p>to the English Aristocracy of their powers and privileges. In short, Mr. Leggett,
</p>
<p>4 1 believe that the English Aristocracy lent thnr influence to the Abolition of Slavery
</p>
<p>tn the British colonies that they may use it as a wedge for the division of the American
</p>
<p>Union. They did it to promote their own interest, to perpetuate their own privileges;
</p>
<p>l)y the destruction of the Union and prosper ty of democratic Am-rtca, and to secure
</p>
<p>their object, they care no more for a debt of 20.000,01)0 sterling and the commercial
</p>
<p>ruin of the British West India, islands than for the ashes on that cigar you are smo-
</p>
<p>king.' "
</p>
<p>In the above sketch, I repeat, I do not profess to give the language of Mr. L.,
</p>
<p>but have endeavored, in my own language, to convey the impression made upon
</p>
<p>my mind of the course of reasoning by which Mr. W. came to his conclusion.

</p>
<p>The words in italics, however, are very nearly the words used by Mr. Leggett.
</p>
<p>Whit struck me as particularly notewhorty iu Mr. Leggett's narrative was,
</p>
<p>that bejore the experiment of negro emancipation in the British West Indies had been
</p>
<p>fully tried, and while the friends and supporters of the measure professed to believe
</p>
<p>that its effect would be happy upon those immediately connected with it, both in the
</p>
<p>inlands and in England, an agent of the British government, who must have had un-
</p>
<p>common opportunities for forming a sound judgment inthecase, expressed his belief that
</p>
<p>they ivho contrott d the action of the government knew, when they gave their sanction
</p>
<p>to the measure, that there wa every reason to expect that it would be calamitous to
</p>
<p>the negroes, to the planters, and to the British people, and knew too that they could
</p>
<p>easily have prevented it, but that they still supplied and encouraged it, because it
</p>
<p>would promote the interests of the English Aristocracy, by enabling them tv excite, in
</p>
<p>the free States af America, such an a nti- slavery feeling, as would lead to a division of
</p>
<p>the American Union, and the des'ruction of the yreal democratic Republic.
</p>
<p>A constant attendance at the meetings of religious an 1 philanthropic societies,
</p>
<p>and especially of anti slavery meetings, during a residence of four years in London,
</p>
<p>thoroughly satisfied me that anti-s'avery meetings and exc tements are got up in
</p>
<p>Englan 1, not for the purpose of a removal, or an amelioration of the evils of Sla-
</p>
<p>very in any part of the world, but chiefly, if noc exclusively, with a view to keep
</p>
<p>up in the hearts of the English people a hatred of the people and institutions of
</p>
<p>America.
</p>
<p>And, as to our own country, nil who are acquainted with the history of the anti-
</p>
<p>slavery movement here, know that, prior to the Abolition of Slavery in the British
</p>
<p>colonies, the American anti-slavery movement was eminent'y kind, considerate,
</p>
<p>rational, and Christian ; that it had lrealy h .ppily effected the gradual but total
</p>
<p>abolition of slavery in all the Northern States, and was at the time very active m
</p>
<p>the border Slave States, especially among the slaveholders, who, ufter individually
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>emancipating scores of thousands of their own slaves united with each other in
</p>
<p>anti-slavery societies to promote the gradual, but eventually total abolition of
</p>
<p>slavery by law in their respective States, with fair prospects of success in Deleware,
</p>
<p>Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and with some hope even in North
</p>
<p>Carolina and Tennessee the emancipation of the slaves in most of these States
</p>
<p>to go hand in hand with their removal to other lands. It is also well known that
</p>
<p>immediaetly after the Abolition of Slavery in the British colonies, anti-slavery
</p>
<p>aocieties of a totally different character were formed in New England, and that
</p>
<p>these societies were based on the principle of bitter hatred to all slaveholders, and
</p>
<p>a fierce denunciation of the mesures which had been framed, with great conside-
</p>
<p>ration and wisdom, by Southern slaveholders, for the welfare of their slaves, and
</p>
<p>the elevation of the negro race. It is known that the supporters of these New
</p>
<p>England anti-slavery societies established newspapers, issued tracst, employed
</p>
<p>lecturers, and devised plans, evidently intended to irritate Southern men, and
</p>
<p>provoke to acts which would irritate Northern men, and provoke retaliatory act,
</p>
<p>and thus, by continued angry action and reaction, ripen a hostility between the
</p>
<p>North and the South, which would naturally end in a dissolution of the American
</p>
<p>Union. This system of hostility has been kept up now for twenty-five years, and,
</p>
<p>with what effect, let the present state of the country answer.
</p>
<p>How much of the large amount of money expended by American Abolitionists in
</p>
<p>support of this organized system of hostility to the Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States has been contributed in England we know not, but we do know that, while
</p>
<p>conservative Americans have often been publicly and wantonly insulted in England
</p>
<p>in connection with the Slavery question, and without apology where apology was
</p>
<p>due from members of the Aristocracy, other Americans, whose chief claim to no-
</p>
<p>tice was the zeal and success with which they had attacked a fundamental law of
</p>
<p>their country and promoted bitter strife between the people of its two great sec-
</p>
<p>tions, have been invited to the homes of the English nobility, flattered, honored,
</p>
<p>and encouraged on their return to America to renew their warfare upon the people
</p>
<p>and the institutions of the South. These facts are readily explained on the theory
</p>
<p>of Deputy Commissary-General, Wilson, that the aim of the English Aristocracy
</p>
<p>is to perpetuate their own power and privileges by destroying the great American
</p>
<p>democratic republic, and they can not, we think, be satisfactorily explained on

<p>SIDNEY E. MORSE.
</p>
<p>The fear of losing Canada was an incentive to more vigorous
</p>
<p>action. If a continual broil could be kept up in the States, the
</p>
<p>Canadians would be better satisfied with their condition. Money
</p>
<p>was supplied to send lecturers over the Middle and Western
</p>
<p>States, but the people would not listen. Churches, school-houses,
</p>
<p>and all other public places were closed to them. And if an at-
</p>
<p>tempt was made to speak in the street or a public square, the
</p>
<p>speaker was, in scores of places, pelted with rotten eggs, and in
</p>
<p>some instances he was obliged to submit to a coat of tar and
</p>
<p>feathers or a ride upon a rail.
</p>
<p>Did these things stop the work ? Not at all. Those engaged
</p>
<p>in it were too well paid to allow trifles to stand in the way. What
</p>
<p>did they care for the Union, or the peace and tranquility of the
</p>
<p>people.
</p>
<p>Eighteen hundred and thirty-seven found the people of Canada
</p>
<p>resolved to cut loose from the British throne. By a want of con-
</p>
<p>cert in the leaders they failed, and were denounced as traitors.
</p>
<p>While this excitement was at its heighth, long and angry dis-
</p>
<p>putes about the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>ripened Into warlike demonstrations, and preparations were made
</p>
<p>to settle the matter by combat.
</p>
<p>England finding she could not break up or cripple our com-
</p>
<p>merce or bring about a dissolution of the Union alone, called to
</p>
<p>her aid the Catholic powers of Europe, France, Austria, Russia
</p>
<p>and Prussia ; and in December, 1841, the Quintuple treaty was
</p>
<p>signed at London by representatives from each of these powers,
</p>
<p>granting a mutual right of search. This treaty was ostensibly to
</p>
<p>suppress the slave trade, but who does not see that it was aimed
</p>
<p>at the United States ?
</p>
<p>The boundary between Maine and New Brunswick was finally
</p>
<p>settled by the Ashburton treaty in 1842. This treaty provides
</p>
<p>for the final suppression of the slave trade, and contains the only
</p>
<p>extradition clause that could ever be obtained from England, and
</p>
<p>that is in cases of certain crimes. Through the want of such a
</p>
<p>treaty, our citizens have lost millions of money ; not only by fugi-
</p>
<p>tive slaves, but by dishonest debtors.
</p>
<p>Then came the question for the admission of Texas, when the
</p>
<p>North, forgetting the Missouri Compromise, sprung upon Con-
</p>
<p>gress the Wilmot proviso, and again a storm arose, the North op-
</p>
<p>posed the annexation because it would increase the area and po-
</p>
<p>litical strength of slavery. This question was decided by the
</p>
<p>people in electing to the presidency, Mr. Polk, who was pledged
</p>
<p>in favor of annexation.
</p>
<p>England, still bent upon getting up a subject of strife, laid
</p>
<p>claim to a large part of Oregon : this was finally settled by a
</p>
<p>treaty, in which she got the lion's share.
</p>
<p>In 1850, when California asked for admission, another storm
</p>
<p>came up which shook the Union to its centre, another compro-
</p>
<p>mise was resorted to, and the people rejoiced that a vexed ques-
</p>
<p>tion was finally disposed of. Then Mrs. Stowe came to the res-
</p>
<p>cue of the British party with Uncle Tom's Cabin, a tissue of
</p>
<p>misrepresentations which enlisted the sympathies of the whole

</p>
<p>North. Before this, the abolition or anti-slavery sentiment was
</p>
<p>comparatively limited in its extent. This book was read by every
</p>
<p>body. Mrs. Stowe being the daughter of a clergyman and the
</p>
<p>wife of another, her statements were swallowed by the people, as
</p>
<p>truth.
</p>
<p>The Kansas and Nebraska bill, which was intended by its fra-
</p>
<p>mers to affirm the compromise act of 1850, again set the whole
</p>
<p>nation in an uproar. Ministers who were ordained to preach the
</p>
<p>gospel, preached anti-slavery. And no class of men have done
</p>
<p>more to bring about the present condition of affairs than these
</p>
<p>same ministers, who, under the garb of preaching " Christ and
</p>
<p>Him crucified" have been step by step inflaming the public mind
</p>
<p>of the North against the Institutions of the South, and those laws
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>that have been enacted by our National Legislature for the pro-
</p>
<p>tection of the rights of the citizens of the southern half of our re-
</p>
<p>public. Instead of following the example set them by Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ and the founders of the Church, or the teachings of that
</p>
<p>Book which they pretend to follow, they have, whilst performing
</p>
<p>their ministerial duties with an air of sanctity, put a new inter-
</p>
<p>pretation upon the Scriptures and taught their followers, that an
</p>
<p>observance of those laws which recognise slavery, is a heinous sin,
</p>
<p>and that the requirements of the " higher law" demanded from
</p>
<p>all believers in the Bible, their violation.*
</p>
<p>Forbes and Redpath, two violent abolitionists, were sent from
</p>
<p>England to manage Kansas affairs, and thus to foment a civil war
</p>
<p>which threatened to involve the whole country.
</p>
<p>About this time a new party was formed professing to have
</p>
<p>nothing in common with the Abolition party or its doctrines.
</p>
<p>Though the anti-slavery hobby was mounted, the leaders intended
</p>
<p>to ride it in the territories only.
</p>
<p>The visit of the Price of Wales to this country was proposed
</p>
<p>by those who believed in an "irrepressible conflict," and know-
</p>
<p>ing if it did come, there would be a dissolution of the Union
</p>
<p>then the old plan could be accomplished of uniting Canada with
</p>
<p>the New England States. These, with the Middle and Western
</p>
<p>States, are to form that magnificent empire stretching from the
</p>
<p>Atlantic to the Pacific, with the Prince of Wales as the sovereign.
</p>
<p>You ask how the Prince of Wales is to become the sovereign of
</p>
<p>the North and West, the answer is, by the request of the people.
</p>
<p>The hope is to get the two sections into a war. And if this is
</p>
<p>accomplished, such a war will be waged as the world has never
</p>
<p>seen. Whether it will be a seven year's war or one of thirty
</p>
<p>years, neither section will give up until they are in the hands of
</p>
<p>some other power. The South may call upon France, and the North
</p>
<p>upon England. For this, her forty-five million appropriation
</p>
<p>was made, and not to defend herself against an invasion by France

<p>as was given out.
</p>
<p>The mission of Mr. Lindsay was made with the same end in
</p>
<p>view to ask that our coasting trade should be thrown open to
</p>
<p>England that she might have a force on our coast ready for any
</p>
<p>emergency.
</p>
<p>Enough has been said to lead the reflecting mind to ponder
</p>
<p>seriously on the means which ought to be adopted to defeat the
</p>
<p>machinations of the English government. Let us now turn to
</p>
<p>the other branch of the subject, and consider the schemes which
</p>
<p>the Jesuits have been employing with a similar design.
</p>
<p>* We -wish to bo entirely understood here, when we speak of a class. It is
</p>
<p>well know that there have been many honorable exceptions of those who have
</p>
<p>seen the tendency of this teaching and have warned their hearers against it.
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>The advent of Christ established the Christian religion. The
</p>
<p>system at the first, was represented by a simple association of
</p>
<p>men possessing the same faith and opinions, the same sentiments
</p>
<p>and feelings.
</p>
<p>In the fourth century, Christianity was no longer a simple be-
</p>
<p>lief, it was an institution. Under the protection of Constantino
</p>
<p>the Great, the church had been formed into a corporate body with
</p>
<p>rules and regulations devised by men, and it was fallible, as all
</p>
<p>human governments ever have been and ever will be. We need not
</p>
<p>wonder then that it became corrupt, and in the eleventh century
</p>
<p>claimed supreme dominion, both temporal and spiritual, over all
</p>
<p>the States of Christendom. At the close of this century, the Cru-
</p>
<p>sades were undertaken to drive the infidels or Mohammedans
</p>
<p>from Jerusalem and the Holy Land.
</p>
<p>The beginning of the thirteenth century found the power of the
</p>
<p>Pope supreme, Rome mistress of the world, and kings and em-
</p>
<p>perors her vassals.
</p>
<p>The Crusades undertaken to augment this power, closed with
</p>
<p>this century. Their influence was great expanding the mind of
</p>
<p>Europe, refining the general mannerse, xciting a spirit of geog-
</p>
<p>raphical research and adventure, and promoting improvement in
</p>
<p>the arts and sciences, thus undermining instead of strengthening
</p>
<p>the power of papal Rome, by advancing liberal ideas and freedom
</p>
<p>of thought.
</p>
<p>Supreme power was too valuable to be relinquished without an
</p>
<p>effort to retain it, and to this end resort was had to means lawful
</p>
<p>and unlawful.
</p>
<p>The church had become so corrupt, that a hundred complaints
</p>
<p>and accusations were preferred against it at the Diet of Nurem-
</p>
<p>berg, which Adrian VI acknowledged to be too well founded.
</p>
<p>This pontiff, by his nuncio, frankly declared to the Diet : "that
</p>
<p>all this confusion was originated by men's sins, and, above all, by
</p>
<p>those of the clergymen and prelates that for many years past

</p>
<p>the Holy See had committed many abominations that numerous
</p>
<p>abuses had crept into the administration of spiritual affairs, and
</p>
<p>many superfluities into the laws that all had been perverted
</p>
<p>and that the corruption descending from the head to the body,
</p>
<p>from the Sovereign Pontiff to the prelates was so great, that there
</p>
<p>could hardly be found any one who did good."
</p>
<p>Such was the condition of the Church when the Reformation
</p>
<p>commenced. Nicolini, a protestant writer, says: " While the
</p>
<p>Word of God was rescuing multitudes from idolatry, the Spirit
</p>
<p>of Evil, furious at the escape of so many victims whom he
</p>
<p>had already counted his own, made a desperate effort to retrieve
</p>
<p>his past and prevent future losses. He saw, with dismay, Divine
</p>
<p>truth, like a vast and ever extending inundation rapidly under-
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>mining and throwing down one by one bis many strong-holds of
</p>
<p>superstition and ignorance ; and, with the despairing energy of
</p>
<p>baffled malignity, he set about rearing up a bulwark which should
</p>
<p>check the tide ere its work of destruction was completed. For
</p>
<p>this bulwark, he devised the since famous order of the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>which arose almost simultaneously with the establishment of the
</p>
<p>Reformation."
</p>
<p>The Society of Jesus was established expressly to exterminate
</p>
<p>Protestanism. And every means is justified, that is made use of
</p>
<p>to convert or destroy heretical protestants.
</p>
<p>The bull or proclamation of Paul III, establishing the society,
</p>
<p>says : " Whereas, we have lately learned that our beloved son y
</p>
<p>Ignatius de Loyola (and nine others whose names follow,) in-
</p>
<p>spired, as is piously believed by the Holy Ghost ; coming from
</p>
<p>various regions of the globe ; are met together and become as-
</p>
<p>sociates ; and renouncing the seductions of this world, have dedi-
</p>
<p>cated their lives to the perpetual service of our Lord Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ, and of us and of our successors Roman Pontiffs ; and
</p>
<p>expressly for the instruction of boijs and other ignorant people
</p>
<p>in Christianity, and, above all, for the spiritual consolation of
</p>
<p>the faithful in Christ by HEARING CONFESSIONS.
</p>
<p>Had they adhered to the principles they professed in the out-
</p>
<p>set, and merely aimed at civilizing and converting savages and
</p>
<p>increasing knowledge at home, the institution would have been as
</p>
<p>justly praised for good achieved through it, as it is now de-
</p>
<p>nounced for ambition, avarice, cruelty, and corruption.
</p>
<p>The society is composed of a general, subordinate officers, and
</p>
<p>members. The officers and members vow implicit obedience to
</p>
<p>the general.
</p>
<p>Ignatius Loyola, the first general, while affecting acts of hu-
</p>
<p>mility, was giving his serious attention to the state affairs of dif-
</p>
<p>ferent nations, his desciples were sent all over the world, and in-
</p>
<p>stead of attending to religion as their business, they have made it

<p>a cloak under which they have meddled with the political affairs
</p>
<p>of the people. At different times they have been driven out of nearly
</p>
<p>every country on the globe. The Order, at first limited to sixty
</p>
<p>members, was afterwards extended and has become unlimited,
</p>
<p>and so formidable as to control the church. It had become such
</p>
<p>a nuisance in various countries, that in 1773 it was suppressed by
</p>
<p>Clement XIV, who said the members of the society had-merited
</p>
<p>their fall from the restlessness of their spirit and the audacity of
</p>
<p>their proceedings. In the two centuries the society had existed,
</p>
<p>it had so disturbed the peace of Europe, that thirty-seven states
</p>
<p>had suppressed it before the Pope did so. A few extracts from
</p>
<p>the Bull which abolished the order, are all that need be given to
</p>
<p>show the estimation in which they were held.
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>In the preamble or explanation of the right of a Pope to estab-
</p>
<p>lish and abolish orders in the church, he says : " We know, be-
</p>
<p>sides that we are established by Divine Providence, over KING-
</p>
<p>DOMS and NATIONS, in order to pluck up, destroy, disperse, dissi-
</p>
<p>pate, plant, or nourish, as may best conduce to the right cultiva-
</p>
<p>tion of the vineyard of Sabaoth. After a complete examination
</p>
<p>into the origin and progress of the society, " we have seen that
</p>
<p>the holy founder of the order did institute it for the salvation of
</p>
<p>souls, the conversion of heretics and infidels, and in short, for the
</p>
<p>greater advancement of piety and religion-" After enumerating
</p>
<p>the privileges granted the society by other Popes, he says :
</p>
<p>" Notwithstanding so many and so great favors, it appears from
</p>
<p>apostolic constitution, that almost at the very moment of its in-
</p>
<p>stitution, there arose in the bosom of this society, divers seeds of
</p>
<p>discord and dissension, not only among the companions them-
</p>
<p>selves, but with other regular orders, the secular clergy, the acad-
</p>
<p>emies, the universities, the public schools, and lastly, even with
</p>
<p>the princes of the states in which the society was received."
</p>
<p>Here follow some of the causes for dissension, &c. " In short,
</p>
<p>accusations of the gravest nature and very detrimental to the
</p>
<p>peace and tranquility of the Christian republic have been continu-
</p>
<p>ally received against the said order. Hence the origin of that
</p>
<p>infinity of appeals and protests against this society, which so many
</p>
<p>sovereigns have laid at the foot of the throne of our predecessors,
</p>
<p>Paul IV., Pius V., and Sixtus V.
</p>
<p>" The accusations against the society were multiplied without
</p>
<p>number, and especially with that insatiable avidity of temporal
</p>
<p>possessions with which it was reproached."*
</p>
<p>" The kings of France, Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, found
</p>
<p>themselves reduced to the necessity of expelling and driving from
</p>
<p>their states and kingdoms and provinces these very companions of
</p>
<p>Jesus ; pursuaded that there remained no other remedy to PO
</p>
<p>great evils, and that this step was necessary, in order to prevent

<p>the Christians from rising one against another, and from mas-
</p>
<p>Bacreeing each other in the very bosom of our common mother, the
</p>
<p>holy Church." This brief was issued in July, 1773, and on the
</p>
<p>22d of September, 1774, the Pope died from the effects of slow poi-
</p>
<p>son.
</p>
<p>The Jesuits have always said that Clement was forced into the
</p>
<p>measure, but this did not save him from their poison.
</p>
<p>A few years before this, Benedict XIV, in a terrible bull which
</p>
<p>he issued against them, said they were disobedient, contumacious,
</p>
<p>crafty, and reprobate men.
</p>
<p>* As a specimen of this, Bishop Hughes holds for the the church in New York
</p>
<p>city, property to the amount of $25,000,000.
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>When they were suppressed and driven from Rome, they took
</p>
<p>refuge in Prussia and in Russia, where they were welcomed as
</p>
<p>teachers of youth. Nicolini says : "No pages of ours could con-
</p>
<p>vey to our readers a mere accurate idea of the conduct of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits in Russia, than a passage of the imperial decree, by which
</p>
<p>Alexander expelled them from his capital in 1815."
</p>
<p>After having recorded that while the Jesuits were persecuted
</p>
<p>in the rest of Europe, Russia alone, from a spirit of humanity and
</p>
<p>tolerance, had received and protected them. He then enumerates
</p>
<p>the acts of base ingratitude they displayed in stirring up dissen-
</p>
<p>sions, c., in his dominions, and u after such actions we are no
</p>
<p>more surprised that these monks are expelled from all countries
</p>
<p>and no where tolerated. Where in fact is the state that would
</p>
<p>tolerate in its bosom those who sow in it hatred and discord ?
</p>
<p>In 1814, the Order was re-established. And in 189, catholic
</p>
<p>Italians drove them from Rome.
</p>
<p>According to the rules of the Order, no Jesuit is permitted to
</p>
<p>mix in any way in political or secular matters, or engage in any
</p>
<p>commercial operations. Notwithstanding these rules, they dis-
</p>
<p>pese of the destinies of kingdoms almost at their pleasure, and
</p>
<p>some of them are among the largest bankers in Europe. Instead
</p>
<p>of punishing them for these transgressions, the most skilful poli-
</p>
<p>ticians are raised to the important offices in the society.
</p>
<p>This glance at the history of the Jesuits has been given to show
</p>
<p>who and what they are. Ever since the establishment of the
</p>
<p>Order, and in all countries, they have been distinguished by
</p>
<p>an insatiable thirst for power; and while they have so often
</p>
<p>been denounced by the catholic Church for their misdeeds, yet
</p>
<p>they have succeeded in controlling the policy of that Hierar-
</p>
<p>chy to a great extent, and have so far identified themselves
</p>
<p>with the church as to be enabled to shelter their nefarious de-
</p>
<p>signs under the cloak of religion. Our purpose is not to attack
</p>
<p>any system of religious faith, but to point out the dangers to

<p>which we, as a people, are exposed from this secret organization.
</p>
<p>It is a police infinitely more exact and better informed than
</p>
<p>has ever been that of any State. This police, this secret inqui-
</p>
<p>sition carried to such a degree of perfection, may give some idea
</p>
<p>of the strength of a government, so well informed, so persevering
</p>
<p>in its projects, so powerful by its unity, (and as the constituiions
</p>
<p>have it,) by the union of its members. It is not hard to under-
</p>
<p>stand, what immense force must belong to the heads of this so-
</p>
<p>ciety, and how the General of the Jesuits could say to the Duke
</p>
<p>de Brissac : " FROM THIS ROOM SIR, I GOVERN NOT ONLY PARIS,
</p>
<p>BUT CHINA, NOT ONLY CHINA, BUT THE WHOLE WORLD AND THAT
</p>
<p>WITHOUT ANY ONE KNOWING HOW IT IS DONE.''
</p>
<p>They are now and have been for years, aiding the English
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>government in destroying the Union. England is so bent upon
</p>
<p>checking the^tide of Democracy or Republicanism, that she can-
</p>
<p>not see the viper she is fostering to her owh destruction.
</p>
<p>Ask the most ignorant Roman catholic if he believes this coun-
</p>
<p>try will ever become subject to the Church? he will answer at
</p>
<p>once, "yes, this country belongs to the catholics it was dis-
</p>
<p>covered by Columbus, who was a catholic, and the means to fit
</p>
<p>out his vessels for discovery, were furnished by the sale of Isabel-
</p>
<p>la's jewels, who was a catholic, therefore, it of right belongs to the
</p>
<p>catholics;" besides, catholics maintain that France and Spain
</p>
<p>took possession of America in the name of the *Church, and the
</p>
<p>Jesuits teach in the confessional and in their schools, that the
</p>
<p>" Plymouth Rock Pilgrims were a band of robbers and pirates,
</p>
<p>who fled from Europe to America on account of crimes committed
</p>
<p>against the government of papal England." "Soon other sects
</p>
<p>cast their scum on the same shores, and protestantism gained
</p>
<p>sovereignty in the Thirteen colonies which were destined to be-
</p>
<p>come the United States. Yet the catholic Church could never
</p>
<p>abandon THE INVADED TERRITORY.
</p>
<p>These being the sentiments of the Church, do not imply a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy against the Government.
</p>
<p>Professor Morse says: " What concurrence of circumstances,
</p>
<p>aside from confession of the plot, is sufficient to prove conspi-
</p>
<p>racy?"
</p>
<p>Is not the case proved if it can be shown ?
</p>
<p>1st. That there exists an adequate motive to conspire.
</p>
<p>2d. That there exists ample means wherewith to conspire.
</p>
<p>3d. That means capable of accomplishing the object of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy are actually employed by those whose interest it is to con-
</p>
<p>spire.
</p>
<p>No one in the case before us can expect a confession from
</p>
<p>the conspirators ; (though, in the case of England, we have the
</p>
<p>confession of Henry,) let us have recourse then to the test pro*

</p>
<p>posed :
</p>
<p>1st. Have Austria and the Holy Alliance an adequate motive
</p>
<p>for conspif ing against the liberties of the United States ? Can
</p>
<p>there be a stronger motive than that of self preservation ? So
</p>
<p>certain as this country exists in prosperity under its present demo-
</p>
<p>cratic form of government, just so certain will its example oper-
</p>
<p>ate on the. people of Europe, as it has for two centuries operated,
</p>
<p>and is now in an accellerated degree operating to subvert the
</p>
<p>ancient oppressive systems of government of the old world. The
</p>
<p>strongest motive, therefore, that can influence governments as
</p>
<p>well as individuals! that of self preservation, impels Austria and
</p>
<p>the other despots of Europe *to seek, by any means in their
</p>
<p>power, the subversion of this government
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>2d. Have they the means to conspire? No one can doubt
</p>
<p>that the usual'means of conspiracy, money and intrigueing agent*
</p>
<p>are perfectly at the command of those governments which can
</p>
<p>lavish their millions for the sole purpose of protecting their
</p>
<p>thrones, and which keep in their pay for this vital object, stand-
</p>
<p>ing armies, and a police of tens of thousands of spies.
</p>
<p>3d. Have they then employed, or are they actually employ-
</p>
<p>ing means capable of accomplishing their object in this country ?
</p>
<p>Austria, in a combination with other powers, called the St.
</p>
<p>Leopold Foundation, has sent and is still sending both moneg and
</p>
<p>agents to this coifntry ; the former comes in the shape of religious
</p>
<p>contributions to this St. Leopold Foundation, the society in Vi-
</p>
<p>enna, established with express reference to operations in the
</p>
<p>United States ; the latter come the same quarter, in the shape of
</p>
<p>hundreds of Jesuits ; a class of men notorious for their intrigue
</p>
<p>and political arts, and who have a complete military organization
</p>
<p>through the United States. The catholic religion is the cloak
</p>
<p>which covers the design.
</p>
<p>All the circumstances therefore necessary to prove conspiracy,
</p>
<p>concur in fixing this charge upon Austria and her associates in
</p>
<p>that union of Christian princes combined in the St. Leopold
</p>
<p>foundation."
</p>
<p>In 1828, Frederick Schlegel delivered a course of lectures in
</p>
<p>Vienna, going to show the mutual support which popery and
</p>
<p>monarchy derive from each other. He represented protestantism
</p>
<p>as the enemy of good government, as the ally of republicanism,
</p>
<p>as the parent of the distresses of Europe, as the cause of all the
</p>
<p>disorders with which legitimate governments are afflicted. In
</p>
<p>one of his lectures he thus speaks of this country : " The TRUE
</p>
<p>NURSERY of all these destructioe principles, THE REVOLUTIONARY
</p>
<p>SCHOOL for France and the rest of Europe, has been NORTH
</p>
<p>AMERICA. THENCE the evil has spread over many other lands,
</p>
<p>either bg natural contagion or by arbitrary communication.

</p>
<p>The result of these lectures was the combination of the catho-
</p>
<p>lic powers of Europe for the express purpose of extending popery
</p>
<p>over these United States, and in time of building up Qf establish-
</p>
<p>ing monarchies, through the St. Leopold Foundation.
</p>
<p>To induce the people of Europe to become members of this
</p>
<p>organization, the pope, in his letter approving of the society,
</p>
<p>promises indulgences for fourteen days in the year.
</p>
<p>u Indulgences were for the pardon of sins, and were sometimes
</p>
<p>so extensive as to be for the past, present, and to come. They
</p>
<p>were written upon parchment, and sealed and signed by the Pope
</p>
<p>or his delegates."
</p>
<p>That the object of this society is to subvert this government,
</p>
<p>we have, among other testimonies, the following by the Duke of
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>Richmond, formerly governor of the Canadas, who said in a speech
</p>
<p>at Montreal : " The Government of the United States ought not to
</p>
<p>stand, and it will not stand, but it will be destroyed by subver-
</p>
<p>sion and not by conquest. The plan is this : to send over the
</p>
<p>surplus population of Europe. They will go over with foreign
</p>
<p>views and feelings, and will form a heterogenous mass, and in the
</p>
<p>course of time will be prepared to rise and subvert the govern-
</p>
<p>ment." He then adds : " The Church of Rome has a design
</p>
<p>upon that country. Popery will in time be the established re-
</p>
<p>ligion, and will aid in the destruction of that republic. I have
</p>
<p>conversed with many of the sovereigns and princes of Europe ;
</p>
<p>and they have unanimously expressed their opinions relative to
</p>
<p>the Government of the United States, and their DETERMINATION
</p>
<p>to subvert it."
</p>
<p>"The Freeman's Journal" says: "The Pope of Rome has
</p>
<p>supreme authority over every diocese and over every square foot
</p>
<p>of surface on this globe." The United States is divided into forty-
</p>
<p>one dioceses, with thirty-nine bishops and two apostolic vicars, and
</p>
<p>some two thousand priests. The bishops and most of the priests are
</p>
<p>foreigners, sent here as agents for this foreign organization ; they
</p>
<p>serve their time, and if they are successful in the cause, they are
</p>
<p>recalled and promoted. These men have no love for our govern-
</p>
<p>ment or institutions, as a few extracts from their letters will show :
</p>
<p>Bishop Flaget of Bardstown, Kentucky, in a letter to his pa-
</p>
<p>trons abroad, speaking of the difficulties in converting the Indians,
</p>
<p>says the last difficulty is ! " their continual traffic among the whites,
</p>
<p>which cannot be hindered as long as THE REPUBLICAN GOVERN-
</p>
<p>MENT SHALL SUBSIST." Mr. Baraga of Michigan, in giving an ac-
</p>
<p>count of some persons who refused to have their children baptized,
</p>
<p>lays the fault on this too fret government.
</p>
<p>"The Catholic Telegraph," in commenting upon the mob who
</p>
<p>burnt the Convent at Charlestown, Massachusetts, says : " A sys-
</p>
<p>tem of government which admits a feeling of alarm in the execu-

</p>
<p>tion of the laws, from the vengeance of the mob which Mr. Aus-
</p>
<p>tin, (the prosecuting attorney,) distinctly allows to be the case
</p>
<p>a vengeance exhibited by letters to the public officers, and threats
</p>
<p>to the public authorities may be very fine in the theory, very
</p>
<p>fit for imitation on the part of those who seek the power of
</p>
<p>the mob in contradistinction to justice and the public interest,
</p>
<p>but is not of a nature to invite the reflecting part of the
</p>
<p>world, and shows at least that it has evils. A public officer
</p>
<p>in England, who would publicly avow such a fear of executing his
</p>
<p>duty and carrying into effect the law of the realm, ought and
</p>
<p>would be thrust out of office by public opinion. This one fact
</p>
<p>is condemnation OF THE SYSTEM OF AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS, con-
</p>
<p>firmed lately by numerous other proofs. Such comments came
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>with a very good grace, after some of these same citizens were
</p>
<p>threatened by the mother superior of the convent, with a mob of
</p>
<p>20,000 Irishmen, whom she said the Bishop had under his con-
</p>
<p>trol.
</p>
<p>The greatest fault which they find with this government, is the
</p>
<p>religious liberty enjoyed. In the letters of an independent irish-
</p>
<p>man addressed to Bishop Fitzpatrick, the following passage is
</p>
<p>found: says Bishop Kendrick: "No faith with heretics ;" and,
</p>
<p>says Bishop O'Connor of Pittsburg : " Religious liberty ia
</p>
<p>merely endured until the opposite can be carried into execution
</p>
<p>without peril to the Catholic world." This bigoted sentiment is
</p>
<p>the same in kind with that quoted from the Catholic Review, " no
</p>
<p>rights for Protestants or any body else except Catbolics." Fine
</p>
<p>doctrine for a republic ! Of precisely the same nature was the
</p>
<p>sentiment lately uttered by the Bishop of St. Louis : " Catho-
</p>
<p>licity will one day rule America, and then religious liberty is at
</p>
<p>an end."
</p>
<p>To show what they mean by religious liberty, we make a quo-
</p>
<p>tation from the London Rambler : " Religious liberty, in the
</p>
<p>sense of a liberty possessed by every man to choose his own re-
</p>
<p>ligion, is one of the most wicked delusions ever foisted upon this
</p>
<p>age by the father of all deceit. The very name of liberty, ex-
</p>
<p>cept in the sense of a permission to do certain definite acts, ought
</p>
<p>to be banished from the domain of religion. It is neither more
</p>
<p>nor less than a falsehood. No man has a right to choose his re-
</p>
<p>ligion. None but an atheist can uphold the principles of religious
</p>
<p>liberty. Shall I, therefore, fall in with this abominable delusion ?
</p>
<p>Shall I foster that damnable doctrine, that Socinianism and Cal-
</p>
<p>vinism and Anglicanism and Judaism are not, every one of them,
</p>
<p>mortal sins like murder and adultery ? Shall I hold out hopes
</p>
<p>to my erring protestant brother; that I will not meddle with his
</p>
<p>creed if he will not meddle with mine? Shall I tempt him to for-
</p>
<p>get that he has no more right to his religious views than he has to

</p>
<p>my purse, or my house, or my life blood ? No. Catholicism is
</p>
<p>the most intolerant of creeds. It is intolerance itself; for it is
</p>
<p>the truth itself. We might as rationally maintain that a sane
</p>
<p>man has a right to believe that two and two do not make four,
</p>
<p>as this theory of religious liberty. Its impiety is only equalled by
</p>
<p>its absurdity."
</p>
<p>This was republished and endorsed in some of the Catholic pa-
</p>
<p>pers here. Bishop Kenrick says: "Heresy and unbelief are
</p>
<p>CRIMES ; that is the whole of the matter. And in Christian coun-
</p>
<p>tries, as in Italy and Spain for instance, where all the people are
</p>
<p>catholic and where the Catholic religion is an essential part of the
</p>
<p>law of the land, they will be punished as other crimes/' Another
</p>
<p>Bishop says :
</p>
<p>. Protestantism of every kind, Catholicity inserts in her Cata-
</p>
<p>logue of mortal sins ; she endures it when and where she must ;
</p>
<p>bnt she hates it, and directs all her energies to effect its destruc-
</p>
<p>tion. If the Catholics ever gain, which they surely will do, an
</p>
<p>immense numerical majority, religious freedom in this country ia
</p>
<p>at an end."
</p>
<p>Are Americans ready for this state of affairs? if they are, there
</p>
<p>are some other things that will have to be taken into the account.
</p>
<p>Popery does nor acknowledge the right of the people to govern ;
</p>
<p>but claims for itself the supreme right to govern all people, and
</p>
<p>all rulers, by divine right.
</p>
<p>It does not tolerate the liberty of the press ; it takes advantage
</p>
<p>indeed of our liberty of the press to use its own press against our
</p>
<p>liberty, but it proclaims in the thunders of the Vatican, and with
</p>
<p>a voice which it pronounces infallible and unchangeable, that it is
</p>
<p>a liberty never sufficiently to be execrated and detested."
</p>
<p>Liberty of conscience is denounced as a most pestilential error,
</p>
<p>and liberty of opinion " a pest of all others most to be dreaded in
</p>
<p>a state."
</p>
<p>It is not responsible to the people in its financial matters. It
</p>
<p>taxes at will, and is accountable to none but itself.
</p>
<p>These are the political tenets held by catholics in close union
</p>
<p>with their religious belief, yet these are not religious, but civil
</p>
<p>tenets ; they belong to despotic government.
</p>
<p>Lafayette knowing by the history of his own country the dan-
</p>
<p>gers of this insidious foe warned us in these words : American
</p>
<p>liberty can be destroyed only by the Popish clergy."
</p>
<p>The Romish Hierarchy declares to the people of the United
</p>
<p>States the following determination, through its chief organ in our
</p>
<p>country " Brownsoris Review" "The church is a kingdom and a
</p>
<p>power, and as such must have a supreme chief (pope), and this
</p>
<p>authority is to be exercised over States as well as individuals. If
</p>
<p>the pope directed the Romanc atholics of this country to overthrow
</p>
<p>the Constitution (and put down the American flag) sell the natio-

</p>
<p>nality of the country, and annex it as a dependent province to
</p>
<p>Napoleon the Little (a papist sovereign) they would be bound to
</p>
<p>obey. It is the intention of the Pope to possess this coun-
</p>
<p>try."
</p>
<p>When most protestants read these things, they will say no ! the
</p>
<p>Pope can never control this country, they are numerically too weak.
</p>
<p>Let us see how weak they are. 'They boast that they hold the
</p>
<p>balance of power now, and have done so for years.
</p>
<p>In 1841, Bishop Hughes, in effect, offered the Roman catholic
</p>
<p>vote for sale at Carroll Hall in the city of New York, if the
</p>
<p>Bible would be excluded from the public schools.
</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>Afterwards for the same vote, the public funds were divided and
</p>
<p>they now educate their children in separate schools.
</p>
<p>In 1852, the battle ground for the presidency being Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania, and the Catholic vote the balance between the two parties,
</p>
<p>it was of vast importance where it was thrown. General Pierce
</p>
<p>was reported as opposed to Catholics holding office and of course
</p>
<p>he could not have it unless he declared for them. He did not
</p>
<p>answer their letter of inquiry and it was decided that General Scott
</p>
<p>should have the vote. Such was the determination when James
</p>
<p>Campbell went to the Western part of the State and took the stump
</p>
<p>for Pierce, he was elected, and James Campbell was rewarded by
</p>
<p>a seat in the Cabinet. This was a direct insult to the protestants
</p>
<p>of Pennsylvania, as only a few months before, this same James
</p>
<p>Campbell had been defeated as a candidate for supreme Judge,
</p>
<p>because he was a catholic.
</p>
<p>They were so elated with success in the election, they thought
</p>
<p>they could accomplish the grand object with regard to the
</p>
<p>schools.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1852 and 1853, a simultaneous movement was
</p>
<p>made in several of the States to abolish the Bible in the public
</p>
<p>schools or to divide the school fund. In Michigan they, went so
</p>
<p>far as to threaten the Legislature. In Maryland, they declared
</p>
<p>that they would not give up until it was accomplished.
</p>
<p>In 1854, Bedim was sent here as Nuncio. In the letter of the
</p>
<p>pope to the president he says, " in as much as we have been en-
</p>
<p>trusted by Divine commission with the care of the Lord's flock
</p>
<p>throughout the world, we cannot allow this opportunity to pass
</p>
<p>without earnestly entreating you to extend your protection to the
</p>
<p>catholics, in habiting those REGIONS, and to shield them at all
</p>
<p>times with your power and authority."
</p>
<p>Bedini came here expecting to be recognized as a Nuncio or
</p>
<p>Diplomatic representative of the Church ; had this been done, he
</p>
<p>would have established the " court for spiritual affairs," which is

</p>
<p>nothing more nor less than the Inquisition. This would have
</p>
<p>brought into use the prisons and dungeons that are built under
</p>
<p>the Cathedrals all over the country. Not quite certain of the
</p>
<p>success of the mission, it was given out that he was on his way to
</p>
<p>Brazil, and merely came this way to compliment the President,
</p>
<p>in the name of the Pope. This was a Jesuitical loop-hole to get
</p>
<p>out in case of failure. Another part of Bedini's mission was, to
</p>
<p>establish the Society of the San Fidesti. The emblems of this
</p>
<p>society are destruction and death. A part of the oath taken by
</p>
<p>its members, is this : " I swear to defend myself in. the cause
</p>
<p>which I have embraced, never to spare a single individual belong-
</p>
<p>ing to the infamous combination of the Liberals, whatever may be
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>his birth, parentage, or fortune, and to have no- pity for the cries
</p>
<p>of children, nor of old men or women, and to shed the blood of
</p>
<p>the Liberals even to the last drop, without regard to age, sex or
</p>
<p>rank. Finally, I swear implacable hatred to all the enemies of
</p>
<p>our Holy Roman Catholic religion, one and true." An emble-
</p>
<p>matical card of this society here has on it the American flag and a
</p>
<p>hand grasping an instrument aimed at it.
</p>
<p>The daggers, poniards, and bowie knives used by these holy
</p>
<p>societies, are blessed by the Bishop or priest before they are used.
</p>
<p>The Know-nothing party which sprung up about this time, is
</p>
<p>said to have been a Jesuitical ruse, gotten up for the purpose of
</p>
<p>creating a sympathy in favor of the church ; because the church
</p>
<p>thrives by persecution. The fate of the party leads to the be-
</p>
<p>lief that this may be true, for a genuine American party would
</p>
<p>not have become the corrupt thing that it did in its ephemeral
</p>
<p>existence. The Democratic party with its accustomed zeal, tooji
</p>
<p>up the cause of the oppressed church, and annihlated the Know-
</p>
<p>nothing party. For this service, and a hundred thousand dol-
</p>
<p>lars added to it, the Catholic vote was given to the Democratic
</p>
<p>party in 1856.
</p>
<p>A further history of the manner in which the Church has exer-
</p>
<p>cised power over political affairs since 1856. would involve indi-
</p>
<p>viduals, and this is not our purpose. Sufficient has been given to
</p>
<p>show that if they are numerically weak, they make use of their
</p>
<p>strength to control in a measure, political affairs. Many persons
</p>
<p>express surprise at the comparative ease with which Catholics
</p>
<p>sometimes obtain offices and appointments, while Protestants
</p>
<p>can do nothing. An extract from the secret instructions to
</p>
<p>the Jesuits, will explain to a certain extent, how this is done :
</p>
<p>Chapter II treats of the way to become familiar with the Great
</p>
<p>of any country : "You must manage to get the ear of those in
</p>
<p>authority, and then secure their hearts, by which way all persons will
</p>
<p>become our creatures, and none will dare to give the society dis-

<p>quiet." "The priests are to wink at the vices of the powerful, and
</p>
<p>to encourage their inclinations whatever they may be, but this
</p>
<p>is to be done in generals, always avoiding particulars." Sect. 4 :
</p>
<p>" It will further us in gaining favor if our members artfully
</p>
<p>worm themselves BY THE INTEREST OF OTHERS into honorable em-,
</p>
<p>bassies to foreign courts in their behalf, but especially to the Pope
</p>
<p>and great monarchs. Further, great care must be taken to curry
</p>
<p>favor with the minions of the great, who, by small presents and
</p>
<p>many offices of piety, we may find means to get faithful intelli-
</p>
<p>gence of the master's inclinations and humors, and thus be better
</p>
<p>qualified to chime their tempers."
</p>
<p>"In confessing, noblemen seem to have nothing in view but
</p>
<p>God's glory ; but by degrees, and sensibly to be directed towards
</p>
<p>political or secular dominion, but in a solemn manner, affirm that
</p>
<p>the administration of public affairs is what we, with reluctance,
</p>
<p>interfere with." Care should be taken to lay before them the
</p>
<p>virtues persons should be furnished with, who are to be admitted
</p>
<p>into public employ, not forgetting slyly to recommend to them
</p>
<p>such as are sincere friends of our order."
</p>
<p>"Wherefore, let the confessors and preachers be informed by
</p>
<p>our friends, of persons proper for every office, and, above all, of
</p>
<p>such as are our benefactors, and whose names let them care-
</p>
<p>fully keep by them, that when proper opportunities occur, they
</p>
<p>may be palmed upon the prince or government by the dexterity
</p>
<p>of our members or agents."
</p>
<p>By such means, we plainly discover how Protestants and Jesuits
</p>
<p>co-operate in the United States, and why leading political men
</p>
<p>bend and fall before their supremacy at the ballot box. This bal-
</p>
<p>lot box which we boast is the palladium of our liberties, is thus
</p>
<p>prostituted by dishonest and corrupt politicians of all parties, who
</p>
<p>would sell their country for a railroad grant, or the liberties
</p>
<p>of the people forever, provided they could get control of the
</p>
<p>government for the term of four years !
</p>
<p>There is a society in Europe called the Christian League, orga-
</p>
<p>nized for " the circulation of the Holy Scriptures ; for the advo-
</p>
<p>cacy of human rights and to give to all nations religious liberty."
</p>
<p>Against this society the present Pope issued a bull declaring that
</p>
<p>" all those who enroll themselves in such societies, or who presume
</p>
<p>to aid or abet them in any way, are guilty of a most grievous sin
</p>
<p>before God and the Church." "It is your duty to remove from
</p>
<p>the hands of the faithful (all) Bibles translated into the v.ulgar
</p>
<p>tongue. VVe especially reprobate the aforesaid Christian League,
</p>
<p>it being their determination to give to all nations, religious liberty."
</p>
<p>Another society, embracing nearly all the wealthy Roman
</p>
<p>Catholics of Europe, has been organized, with the express design
</p>
<p>of establishing Roman Catholic Colonies in our Western States.
</p>
<p>London is its head-quarters, but it has branches in almost every

</p>
<p>capital in Europe.
</p>
<p>The prospectus of this society, proves clearly that its objects
</p>
<p>and designs are :
</p>
<p>1st To provide the means for colonizing the surplus Roman
</p>
<p>Catholic population of Europe in our Western States.
</p>
<p>2d. To do this in such a manner as to create a large demand
</p>
<p>for articles of European manufacture.
</p>
<p>3d. To make Romanism the predominant religion of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>In connection with this pamphlet, the society also published a
</p>
<p>map of North America, showing the proposed field of Papal occu-
</p>
<p>pancy and ultimate ascendency. This field comprises the Statoi
</p>
<p>of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, togatlier
</p>
<p>with Canada West.
</p>
<p>Protestant Americans may think of such a map as they do of som
</p>
<p>of our western cities which look very well on paper, but can never
</p>
<p>be built up. But who will deny that the West is rapidly being
</p>
<p>settled by a foreign Catholic population, acknowledging the Pope
</p>
<p>as their head. They come here, declare their intention of be-
</p>
<p>coming citizens, take the oath of allegiance, and in six months, in
</p>
<p>most of the western States, have all the political rights that a na-
</p>
<p>tive citizen has.
</p>
<p>This oath of allegiance by the way, is taken with a reservation
</p>
<p>in favor of the Pope. The Jesuits direction for such an oath is
</p>
<p>this : " When we begin for instance, to say I swear (then in the
</p>
<p>proper place insert in a subdued tone, the mental restriction,) then
</p>
<p>conclude in the same loud voice ; for thus the whole speech is
</p>
<p>true."
</p>
<p>" Land for the landless," is one of the schemes that will aid in
</p>
<p>building up this power. Free farms to those who are colonized
</p>
<p>by these societies, will enable them to advance their interests to
</p>
<p>almost any imaginable extent.
</p>
<p>Another kingdom is to be formed of Pennsylvania, New York,
</p>
<p>the New England States, and Canada East. Americans, do you
</p>
<p>believe this ? if not, read the following from the London Ramb-
</p>
<p>ler concerning the increase of Romish power in the United
</p>
<p>States : " Churches^ schools, seminaries, colleges, religious com-
</p>
<p>munities, bishoprics and arch-bishoprics are rising as if by enchant*
</p>
<p>ment, in all parts of the republic. In the archi-episcopal province
</p>
<p>of New York, at the present time (1358,) there are over eight
</p>
<p>hundred churches and nearly one million of Catholic souls. The
</p>
<p>city of New York, which, twenty years ago could number but
</p>
<p>seven, can now boast of over thirty places dedicated to catholic
</p>
<p>worship within its precincts."
</p>
<p>The third kingdom is to be composed of the Southern States,
</p>
<p>and in this they will soon succeed unless something is done to

<p>bring the people to a knowledge of the true state of affairs.
</p>
<p>This society was formed in London shortly after the Quintuple
</p>
<p>treaty was was made.* How much the English Government gives
</p>
<p>toward advancing the cause, we do not know ; but soon after this
</p>
<p>*It must be remembered in this place, that in 1841, when the Quintuple treaty
</p>
<p>was made, Louis Phillipe was King of France. In 1845 he determined to expel the
</p>
<p>Jesuits from his kingdom, and succeeded in obtaining from the Pope an order for
</p>
<p>this purpose. From that moment, Louis Phillipe was doomed to fall. With the
</p>
<p>unbounded love the French have for the memory of Napoleon, it was an easy
</p>
<p>matter for the Jesuits to bring about the elevation of Louis Napoleon, with the
</p>
<p>hope of leading him just as they felt disposed ; but they made a terrible mistake.
</p>
<p>When Louis Napoleon discovered their ambitious designs, he determined to
</p>
<p>thwart them, and he has done so to an extent that ages of success cannot remedy.

</p>
<p>the Jesuit college at Maynooth, Ireland, was permanently en-
</p>
<p>dowed at the instance of government, with 26,000 pounds a year,
</p>
<p>and an appropriation of 30,000 pounds to enlarge the buildings.
</p>
<p>In this way, England is selling herself into the hands of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits to accomplish the ruin of this Union.
</p>
<p>The Orangemen in Toronto were very much censured, both in
</p>
<p>England and here, for trying to draw the Prince of Wales into a
</p>
<p>party dempnstration.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it was not remembered by either, that when the Prince
</p>
<p>landed at Halifax, and the first demonstration and procession was
</p>
<p>to come off, a question arose with regard to the place to be as-
</p>
<p>signed to the different clergy. The established church came first
</p>
<p>of course ; the protestants claimed the next place, and so did the
</p>
<p>catholics.
</p>
<p>The Duke of New Castle decided in favor of the catholics.
</p>
<p>This very -small matter was sufficient to show the power of the
</p>
<p>catholics. England pretending to be protestant, it was expected
</p>
<p>that the decision would be in favor of the protestants.
</p>
<p>In an English work called the "Statesmen of America in
</p>
<p>1846," a chapter is devoted to Bishop Hughes, and which we
</p>
<p>have every reason to belieye was revised by that prelate previous
</p>
<p>to its publication. He is spoken of thus : "He assumes his po-
</p>
<p>sition among the statesmen of America, not as an active politician,
</p>
<p>but as the representative, priest, controller and guardian of a
</p>
<p>powerful body now incorporated in [the democracy of the repub-
</p>
<p>lic. I allude to the Roman catholics, both native and foreign.
</p>
<p>The Bishop is the greatest temporal prince of America, and he is
</p>
<p>the greatest spiritual prince in the world."*
</p>
<p>" In the prevailment of the catholic religion, lies the best
</p>
<p>safeguard for this great country of America, against the evils,
</p>
<p>both public and private, which spring from the excess of liberty."
</p>
<p>They (the Catholic's,) " have laid the foundation stone of real
</p>
<p>education ; education of the heart ; the formation of character,

<p>without which liberty is licentiousness ; and compared to which the
</p>
<p>mere accomplishments of the mind and fingers are airy nothings,
</p>
<p>unsubstantial in possession and useless in application. In the nu-
</p>
<p>merous and crowded catholic schools of the United States- are
</p>
<p>taught the exercise of prayer, the practice of morality, the laws of
</p>
<p>obedience and responsibility, and self sacrifice and moral and spiri-
</p>
<p>tual humility, and good works as well as saving faith, and charity
</p>
<p>and brotherly love and tolerance ; and Jiere the strong hand of
</p>
<p>DISCIPLINE is felt."
</p>
<p>After speaking of the Established Church of England, the
</p>
<p>writer continues, " But I am not, cannot be blinded to the many
</p>
<p>*Biebop Hughes is here placed above the Pope.
</p>

</p>
<p>excellencies of the Catholic Church, and especially as its Institu-
</p>
<p>tions regard America ; they are, beyond comparison, the best adap-
</p>
<p>ted to curb the passions of a young, a fierce, impetuous, intelligent,
</p>
<p>generous and high minded democracy to protect the religion
</p>
<p>of a republic from annihilation; to subdue the struggling* and
</p>
<p>discordant interests of an immense territory into harmony, and to
</p>
<p>enchain the sympathies of a whole people in one magnificent scheme
</p>
<p>of morality and devotion. " They shall be one fold under one
</p>
<p>shepherd."
</p>
<p>If these things were really true, where is the patriot in the land
</p>
<p>who would not say amen ! and amen ! besides doing all that he
</p>
<p>could to hasten this millennium ?
</p>
<p>We can, however, only reason from analogy, let us then take two
</p>
<p>examples of nations who have been for centuries under this benign
</p>
<p>influence. What is the condition of Italy after the long experiment
</p>
<p>of priestly rule ? Travellers tell us, that there are whole villages
</p>
<p>whose inhabitans are numbered by hundreds, where no one can
</p>
<p>read or write but the priest. Mexico is in much the same or a
</p>
<p>worse condition, and both are making desperate efforts to place
</p>
<p>themselves under a different government.
</p>
<p>"Catholics are taught obedience;" obedience to what? not to
</p>
<p>the constitution and laws of the country, because the Church is to
</p>
<p>them a higher law, and as we have seen what her intentions are
</p>
<p>with respect to these, we know how far they will be obeyed if they
</p>
<p>come in conflict. They will obey the priests, but not officers who
</p>
<p>administer the laws. As a specimen of this, a few months ago
</p>
<p>there was a rendezvous for catholics of a low order, both black and
</p>
<p>white, just in the rear of the E street Baptist church. Whenever
</p>
<p>there was worship in the church, these rowdies made so much
</p>
<p>noise as to disturb the congregation. The police made several
</p>
<p>efforts to disperse them, but failed ; a\ last, a priest was called
</p>
<p>upon, and the moment he appeared every man was dumb. By a
</p>
<p>motion of the hand they moved off, and the place was closed to

</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>In 1860, when the clergy of all denominations in New York were
</p>
<p>notified of their duties with regard to the registry law, we all
</p>
<p>know the ground Bishop Hughes took when he refused to obey it.
</p>
<p>In his reply to the inspector, he closed the communication with
</p>
<p>this sentence: " I am prepared for a prison or a scaffold, but I
</p>
<p>am not prepared to obey a requisition which would violate the ob-
</p>
<p>ligation of my conscience in a country like this, in which it^ia
</p>
<p>said that civil and religious liberty is the right of every citizen."^
</p>
<p>The Jesuits are sworn to educate this country into their princi-
</p>
<p>ples and practices, in order to subjugate it. To this end, bisho E s,
</p>
<p>priests, monks, and nuns, all labor to destroy the Bible. iheir
</p>
<p>maxim is : " give us the education of the children of the present
</p>
<p>B*
</p>
<p>day, and the next generation will be ours ours in maxims, in
</p>
<p>morals, and religion." They are now doing with education in
</p>
<p>the United States, precisely what they have done in every Euro-
</p>
<p>pean kingdom. They affect all the learning of the world ; they
</p>
<p>establish their academies and their professional honors, to win the
</p>
<p>young into their embrace. The highest honors of their schools
</p>
<p>are for Christian doctrine, and if protestant children go to these
</p>
<p>schools, they can only contend for them by such study.
</p>
<p>In 1859, during the progress of the war in Italy, among the
</p>
<p>American citizens who visited Rome, there was a gentleman whose
</p>
<p>opportunities for observation were such as to make his opinions
</p>
<p>of some importance ; for this reason his acquaintance was sought
</p>
<p>by some of the dignitaries of the Government. Knowing that he
</p>
<p>was born and reared a catholic, he was spoken to as one.
</p>
<p>After he returned to the United States, in answer to the ques-
</p>
<p>tion : What do they think in Rome of their prospects here ? he
</p>
<p>replied: "they speak just as confidently of their success in ob-
</p>
<p>taining control of this country, as if it was a settled matter, but
</p>
<p>how they are to accomplish the design is more than I can tell."
</p>
<p>He then said, u you know with Jesuitical policy, they always
</p>
<p>have men exactly suited to whatever they wish to accomplish.
</p>
<p>They now have in Rome a priest who is said to be a descendant of
</p>
<p>Columbus ; he is to be sent to the United States whenever a pro-
</p>
<p>pitious time arrives, and then it is expected that he will draw every
</p>
<p>body after him, just as other celebrities do who come here." If
</p>
<p>we had doubted this statement, the doubt would have been re-
</p>
<p>moved by some late news from Cuba, in which it was said the
</p>
<p>remains of Columbus were taken from one cathedral, placed in a
</p>
<p>silver urn^and removed to another. A grand parade, with all the
</p>
<p>ceremony to make it effective, was gone through on the occasion.
</p>
<p>Now, it is well known to those who have read the life of Colum-
</p>
<p>bus, that his remains have never been in Cuba. The coffin or
</p>
<p>sarcophagus in which the remains were said to be, was known to

</p>
<p>have nothing in it when taken to Havana.
</p>
<p>Had this news made any impression upon Americans, no doubt
</p>
<p>before this, the arrival of Father Columbus would have been an-
</p>
<p>nounced.
</p>
<p>A French letter-writer says, " the political questions that agi-
</p>
<p>tate Italy, France, England, and more or less all Europe, are so
</p>
<p>much more worthy of attention, as they all rest upon the religious
</p>
<p>question. The existence of Roman Catholicism is in question in
</p>
<p>the struggle ; and as it is ostensibly connected with political abso-
</p>
<p>lutism represented by the Austrian Government, the ancient Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment of Naples and the Duchies of Tuscany, Parma, and
</p>
<p>Modena, the great triumph of Italian independence and unity will
</p>
<p>give the death blow to the POWER of the Roman Catholic church/'
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>In Europe he should have added, for this is the secret of the gi-
</p>
<p>gantic efforts made by the Church in this country. Knowing
</p>
<p>that her power is almost gone in Europe, she is determined to es-
</p>
<p>tablish a firm hold here.
</p>
<p>When the St. Leopold Foundation was formed, the Emperor of
</p>
<p>Austria, in speaking of the destruction of liberal opinions, said,
</p>
<p>" it may require a hundred years -I am not unreasonable, I give
</p>
<p>you a whole age, but you must work without relaxation." Others
</p>
<p>a few years since, thought thirty years* would accomplish the de-
</p>
<p>sign.
</p>
<p>A few. days after the secession of South Carolina, a gentleman
</p>
<p>then in Charleston wrote to Washington : " the only exultant
</p>
<p>people here are the Jesuits." They knew what they were about,
</p>
<p>but others had launched upon an unknown sea without being able
</p>
<p>to see the opposite shore ; they were anxious not axultant.
</p>
<p>The result of our inquiries, after hearing this, has satisfied us
</p>
<p>that this is the Jesuitical plan to subvert this Government. The
</p>
<p>case would not admit of the delay to obtain a numerical majority,
</p>
<p>so they have brought about the secession movement. While En-
</p>
<p>glish interest is keeping up the flame of abolitionism at the North
</p>
<p>the Jesuits at the South say, " why dont you secede go out of
</p>
<p>the Union, &c." These sentiments have been adopted by a set
</p>
<p>of political demagogues who have used them as the anti-slavery
</p>
<p>sentiment has been used at the North, until there has become so
</p>
<p>large a disunion party that it threatens to sweep the whole of the
</p>
<p>Southern States.
</p>
<p>There is no other way of accounting for some of the feelings
</p>
<p>manifested since this movement commenced, than to attribute
</p>
<p>them to Jesuitism.
</p>
<p>Some time ago the Bishop of Cincinnati said, that if the Union
</p>
<p>was destroyed every catholic could hold his hand over the defunct
</p>
<p>body and say, I had nothing to do with the death. Now, this
</p>
<p>means something or it means nothing, but every one knows that

<p>the catholics in the South are the most ardent secessionists, and
</p>
<p>in the North, they are just as zealous unionists. In ordinary cases,
</p>
<p>when a man tries to exculpate himself from a crime of which he
</p>
<p>has not been charged, it is looked upon as prima facia evidence
</p>
<p>of gilt. .. ,.
</p>
<p>Some of the secession leaders say they have been waiting thirty
</p>
<p>years for this opportunity to get out of the Union. This just
</p>
<p>coincides with the formation of the Austrian League. The first
</p>
<p>fruit of this league against the Government, was the nullification
</p>
<p>< .1 /> T Banfapffft I jhf^v
</p>
<p>of South Carolina. ^Trir '
</p>
<p>Bishop England the Bishop of Charleston and of South Carolina
</p>
<p>boasted more than twenty-five years ago, of the votes he cou c
</p>
<p>control at an election. He was one of the agents of the Leopold
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>Foundation, and the moat active man in the country. With such
</p>
<p>agencies at work for so many years, we can scarcely be surprised
</p>
<p>that a hatred of the Union has grown up, and urged to a crisis
</p>
<p>by the aggressions of the North*
</p>
<p>With these facts before her, where is the South to find protec-
</p>
<p>tion and sympathy ? Not in Europe, unless she adopts a monarch-
</p>
<p>ical government, and even then with an export duty on her cot-
</p>
<p>ton sufficient to defray the expenses of the confederacy, she will
</p>
<p>drive England to other quarters for a supply, as she will not buy
</p>
<p>a single bale if she can get it any where else. New England will
</p>
<p>adopt the same course and buy where she can, at the lowest price ;
</p>
<p>where then will the South find a market for her cotton ?
</p>
<p>The whole affair, from the first an ti- slavery agitation to the
</p>
<p>last act of secession, is part and parcel of a most suicidal farce,
</p>
<p>which will end in a grand tragedy unless the actors adopt com-
</p>
<p>mon sense instead of acting at cross purposes.
</p>
<p>Both the North and the South have been magnificently hum-
</p>
<p>bugged into doing what neither would do with their eyes open.
</p>
<p>Every day demonstrates that extremes meet as the Northern
</p>
<p>abolitionist and the ultra secessionist are both determined to ac-
</p>
<p>cept of no compromise.
</p>
<p>A large party at the North talk of coercing the Southern
</p>
<p>States to keep them in the Union. If, instead of such feeling,
</p>
<p>they would extend to the real majority their sympathy, and of-
</p>
<p>fer their aid in getting out of the trouble in which political dema-
</p>
<p>gogues have plunged them,<ihere would be more Christianity dis-
</p>
<p>played.
</p>
<p>We do not admit that the Union has been dissolved. " We
</p>
<p>the people adopted the Constitution, and if there is any way of
</p>
<p>dissolving this contract, it must be done by the people.
</p>
<p>When the people elect representatives to a legislature, they
</p>
<p>have nothing to do with the matter but to obey the laws passed
</p>
<p>by their representatives. The judiciary decide upon the constitu-

</p>
<p>tionality of the laws ; but when a convention meet to make or
</p>
<p>amend a constitution, the acts of that body are submitted to the
</p>
<p>people for their confirmation. Now, if the people of the South
</p>
<p>have delegated to their representatives the right to take away
</p>
<p>their liberties they must abide by the consequences ; but if they
</p>
<p>have not, then the Federal Government is bound to see them pro-
</p>
<p>tected.
</p>
<p>Our enemies glory in our divisions; by them they declare
</p>
<p>boastingly that they shall prevail over us. Let us show them
</p>
<p>that freemen can be united by noble principles, by the love of
</p>
<p>God, of our country, of freedom, of humanity, more closely than
</p>
<p>the vassals of superstition by terror and chains. Divided, we are
</p>
<p>less potent than a rope of sand ; United, we can defy the world
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>and the Jesuits. Let its demonstrate to them that they have
</p>
<p>mistaken the people, and over estimated their power. And if
</p>
<p>they designed to take the Capitol by a plot, they will find (thanks
</p>
<p>to the President and General Scott,) that they cannot do it
</p>
<p>though they may have their churches filled with arms and ammu-
</p>
<p>nition. But this is not the first time they have made a grand
</p>
<p>mistake. The result of the Popish plot of 1678 in England, was
</p>
<p>the writ of habeas corpus which can penetrate their prisons and
</p>
<p>dungeons, no matter how far they are placed under ground, and
</p>
<p>the present struggle may perhaps result in the establishment of
</p>
<p>religious liberty throughout the civilized world.
</p>
<p>In the words of Henry Clay : " We are fighting a great moral
</p>
<p>battle for the benefit, not only of our country, but of all man-
</p>
<p>kind. The eyes of the whole world are in fixed attention upon
</p>
<p>us. One, and the largest portion of it, is gazing with contempt,
</p>
<p>with jealousy, and with envy ; the other portion, with hope, with
</p>
<p>confidence, and with affection. Every where the black cloud of
</p>
<p>legitimacy is suspended over the world, save only one bright
</p>
<p>spot which breaks out from the political hemisphere of the West,
</p>
<p>to enlighten and animate and gladden the human heart ob-
</p>
<p>scure that, by the downfall of liberty here, and all mankind are
</p>
<p>enshrouded in a pall of universal darkness."
</p>
<p>American citizens to be forewarned is to be forearmed. In the
</p>
<p>light of these facts can we hesitate a moment as to our duty ?
</p>
<p>Shall we suffer ourselves to be the dupes of British intrigue and
</p>
<p>Jesuitical cunning, or shall we not rather frown indignantly on
</p>
<p>all attempts, come from whatever source they may, to array one
</p>
<p>section against another, and thus jeopard the fair fabric of liberty
</p>
<p>to which the eyes of the oppressed of all nations are turned ?
</p>
<p>The collection of facts- here presented, was made for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of showing to the people the means used by designing per-
</p>
<p>sons to destroy our liberties, and thus* bring discredit upon a re-
</p>
<p>publican form of Government. Having accomplished the object,

<p>we intended to leave the subject at this point. A providential
</p>
<p>delay in the publication, with an accumulation of startling events,
</p>
<p>has determined us to add a few pages.
</p>
<p>Every one who has paid any attention to political parties and
</p>
<p>their leaders has seen, that instead of radical difference of opin-
</p>
<p>ion and principles being the cause of opposition, it is simply the
</p>
<p>individual interests of the parties. The desire of power ^ and of
</p>
<p>plunder, which, as all cannot share, each is desirous of seizing and
</p>
<p>holding.
</p>
<p>Our public men, instead of doing all they can to advance the
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>interests of the country and of the people, marshall themselves in
</p>
<p>alliances and hostilities for their own interests. Principles are
</p>
<p>professed for the purpose of better compassing their objects, by
</p>
<p>maintaining a character and gaining the support of the people.
</p>
<p>For many years the Democratic party has monopolized the power
</p>
<p>and of course the plunder. The party had become so corrupt that
</p>
<p>the people determined to make a change. The opposition was
</p>
<p>composed of parties with all sorts of interests and a diversity of
</p>
<p>of principles. Opposition to slavery was the first question embra-
</p>
<p>cing those of every grade from the ultra British Abolitionist down
</p>
<p>to the men who imagine that the slave may come in competition
</p>
<p>with their grand children in the territories. The question being
</p>
<p>a sectional one, the people soon found that there was really some
</p>
<p>danger of the Union there were then thousands and thousands
</p>
<p>who determined to vote the Republican ticket because they were
</p>
<p>satisfied that Mr. Lincoln was a conservative, honest, and upright
</p>
<p>man, who would administer the laws with equal justice to all.
</p>
<p>As soon as the election was over, the different parties or inter-
</p>
<p>est in the dominant party, commenced a fierce contest to deter-
</p>
<p>mine which should control the President, and of course the Ad-
</p>
<p>ministration.
</p>
<p>The people both North and South desired peace, but the leaders
</p>
<p>of both sections had determined upon war. The secessionist
</p>
<p>wishes to get out and remain out of the Union. The British
</p>
<p>Abolitionist says, " the Union without slavery, or break it up.'*
</p>
<p>To accomplish this, the President was forced into the course pur-
</p>
<p>sued with regard to Fort Sumpter, in order to get up the war
</p>
<p>spirit both North and South, and he is now menaced with threats
</p>
<p>from this same disunion party at the North, that if he does not
</p>
<p>push on a war of aggression upon the whole South, that they will
</p>
<p>not only impeach, but depose him.
</p>
<p>The Republicans, as a party, we believe, have no desire to
</p>
<p>meddle with slavery, but if they permit themselves to be made

</p>
<p>the instruments of the Abolitionists, and on the pretence of saving
</p>
<p>the Union, go to fighting for it, they will find, when it is too late,
</p>
<p>that they have destroyed it. Who has not heard the story of the
</p>
<p>man who ran up stairs when the house was on fire and threw a
</p>
<p>looking-glass out of the window to save it. The position occupied
</p>
<p>by the majority of the people at the North and the West, is just
</p>
<p>the same as that of this man. Their love of the Union amounts
</p>
<p>to adoration, and they are willing to give themselves and all they
</p>
<p>have, to save it, but in their zeal and devotion, they are more
</p>
<p>likely to destroy it forever. Send an army South under existing
</p>
<p>circumstances and you may retake all the property that belongs
</p>
<p>to the Federal Government, but this can only be done by a sacri-
</p>
<p>fice of human life worth infinitely more than all the property in
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>the States, and after it is done, where is the Union ? and how ia
</p>
<p>it to be maintained? The Union will, no doubt, be very much
</p>
<p>like that between Ireland and England, or of Hungary and
</p>
<p>Austria, or of Poland and her plunderers, and like them, must
</p>
<p>be maintained by a large standing army.
</p>
<p>There are now two parties, one of "the North and one of the
</p>
<p>South, each actuated by the most bitter and revengeful feelings.
</p>
<p>The Northern party say, " we will whip the rebels back into the
</p>
<p>Union ;" while the Southern party say, " we will never go back
</p>
<p>to be under abolition rule." While this is the case, there is no
</p>
<p>Union. One side is just as much revolution as the other.
</p>
<p>Had Mr. Buchanan, in December last, issued a proclamation
</p>
<p>assuring the Union men of the South that they would be sustained
</p>
<p>if the whole force of the Federal Government was required to do
</p>
<p>so, secession would have died a natural death, or have been put
</p>
<p>down by those who have become secessionists in self defence.
</p>
<p>The Union men of Virginia did all that could be done to bring
</p>
<p>about a peaceful solution of the difficulty. The Peace Convention
</p>
<p>would have been a success if the delegates had been sent here by
</p>
<p>the people ; but, the abolition element being the strongest in the
</p>
<p>Republican party, and most of the governors in the states rep-
</p>
<p>resented being republicans, a majority of the delegates appointed
</p>
<p>came here to advocate the interests of themselves or their friends
</p>
<p>in the plunder about to pass into the hands of the party. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, ultra secessionists in the disguise of Union men, rep-
</p>
<p>resented a part of the South. With such men nothing could be
</p>
<p>expected that would be of service to any but themselves. Sum-
</p>
<p>ner said, u we have achieved a victory and we intend to enjoy
</p>
<p>the benefits thereof." The benefit to the disunion party which
</p>
<p>he represents, is the abolition of slavery, and to do this, every
</p>
<p>slaveholder must be exterminated if it can be done in no other
</p>
<p>way. Are the Union men of the North and West willing to be
</p>
<p>used for any such purpose ! W r e think not.

<p>We will no doubt be told that all party lines have been sunk
</p>
<p>and nothing but Union is thought of. f lhis is true we believe and
</p>
<p>the disunion party can well aflord row to ignore party lines vhen
</p>
<p>they have led the people into the scare just as Jesuitism has led
</p>
<p>the people of the South into secession.
</p>
<p>We might feel satisfied with the apparent war policy if such
</p>
<p>men as Governer Andrew, Sumner, 1 eeeher, Greely Co., were
</p>
<p>not at the head of the movement Or if tLcy are rot at the
</p>
<p>head of it, they eo cordially endorse the pi cceedirgs that it is time
</p>
<p>to suspect there is scirethirg \ucng alcut it. Men who have for
</p>
<p>years declared tlat the u Constitution is a league vith bell," and
</p>
<p>have prayed for the advent of " an anti-slavery constitution, an
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>anti-slavery Bible and an anti-slavery God," can have no genuine
</p>
<p>love for the Union and the Constitution as our fathers left it to
</p>
<p>us. Is there not then ground for suspicion that the men who sym-
</p>
<p>pathized with and endorsed John Brown and his acts, are engaged
</p>
<p>in getting up another invasion upon a grand scale with the aid of
</p>
<p>the Government. It is time the people should know what they
</p>
<p>are doing. The abolition and politico religious papers at the North
</p>
<p>say the army is to be sent to " aid the brethren and set them f-ee"
</p>
<p>and '-the downfall of slavery is at hand." These are the things
</p>
<p>that have driven thousands into secession, they were satisfied if
</p>
<p>the abolition clique obtained the control of the party that their
</p>
<p>their threats would be carried out. Giddings, who is in Canada, no
</p>
<p>doubt suggested the employment of the fugitive slaves offered for
</p>
<p>the war. Canada would be glad to get them out of her terri-
</p>
<p>tory.
</p>
<p>If this abolition movement is carried out, and the slaves are
</p>
<p>set free, where are they to go ? Are the people of the North
</p>
<p>ready to admit them as competiors for the work by which they
</p>
<p>and their families are sustained ? We leave the question to be
</p>
<p>answered by those interested in the matter.
</p>
<p>We have our own opinion about the course to be pursued, in
</p>
<p>order to correct some of the blunders that have been made, and
</p>
<p>we give it for what it is worth. If any one has a better plan,
</p>
<p>let him send it on.
</p>
<p>We would never acknowledge secession, but the people want
</p>
<p>peace and not war, and the only way which we can see to get out
</p>
<p>of the present difficulty, is to blockade every port from Cap May
</p>
<p>to the Rio Grande. Encircle the seceded States with a line of
</p>
<p>troops, and cut off all supplies except provisions. Offer a reward
</p>
<p>for the heads of the leading conspirators, and then send an army
</p>
<p>large enough to protect the Unionists and to prevent insurrection
</p>
<p>of the slaves. Even these things cannot be done peacefully unless
</p>
<p>there is some change in public opinion both North and South, and

<p>this change must commence in the North. In 1850, Union meetings
</p>
<p>were held all over the North speeches were made and resolutions
</p>
<p>passed, deprecating disunion, but no measures were taken to put
</p>
<p>down disunion. Laws in violation of the Constitution, were pas-
</p>
<p>sed in several of the States, and when the people were called
</p>
<p>upon to vote, they too often forgot the Union, and voted against
</p>
<p>it. The underground railroad was sustained, and the people per-
</p>
<p>mitted such things to be done. Again, when John Brown made
</p>
<p>his raid upon Harper's Ferry, the same kind of Union meetings
</p>
<p>were held, Brown was denounced, and when votes were to be
</p>
<p>given, his aiders and supporters obtained them. Such meetings
</p>
<p>have been played out, they will do no good, as no reliance can be
</p>
<p>placed upon them.
</p>

</p>
<p>If the people are for Union and Peace, let them declare their
</p>
<p>determination to maintain the Union peacefully.
</p>
<p>Let meetings be held in every village or in every place where
</p>
<p>votes are polled, and say to the South and to your representa-
</p>
<p>tives in Congress, we are determined to sustain the Unionists of
</p>
<p>the South, and just as determined to put down disunion, both
</p>
<p>North and South. Do this, live up to it, and there is yet hope
</p>
<p>of the Union. Can any one doubt that the South would accept
</p>
<p>such terms ? All they have ever asked (we mean the people, not
</p>
<p>the demagogues,) has been, to be let alone with their domestic
</p>
<p>institutions to suit themselves. Northern demagogues will tell
</p>
<p>you that Southern politicians have ruled the country for so many
</p>
<p>years. If this is true, it was time to make a change, bat we do
</p>
<p>not want a Northern rule ; no section has a right to rule where
</p>
<p>all have equal rights. Again, we are told that the South want
</p>
<p>to force slavery upon the North, there is just as much truth in
</p>
<p>this assertion as there is in declaring that the whole North are
</p>
<p>abolitionists.
</p>
<p>The people hold the game in there own hands ; they have the
</p>
<p>fighting to do as well as the bills to pay. The whole Union is the
</p>
<p>stake and the players are the Unionist on one side, and on the
