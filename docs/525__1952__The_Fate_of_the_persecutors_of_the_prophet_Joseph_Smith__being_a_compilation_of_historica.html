<p>FOREWORD
</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith was subject to constant persecution
</p>
<p>from the time of his First Vision until his death. Scores of times
</p>
<p>he was brought by enemies before the courts of the land but never
</p>
<p>found guilty of the things for which he was charged. Readers of
</p>
<p>his tempestuous life constantly wonder about the fate of his perse-
</p>
<p>cutors who often made unhappy his life and finally murdered him.
</p>
<p>In this book Brother Lundwall has collected all the material
</p>
<p>bearing on the subject available to him. Much of the collection
</p>
<p>is found in the History of the Church and in various Church publi-
</p>
<p>cations, but has not before been assembled under one cover. Some
</p>
<p>of the material is distinctly new even to experienced students of
</p>
<p>the life of the Prophet.
</p>
<p>The Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ as taught by the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith is the gospel of love and forgiveness. The material
</p>
<p>found within this cover does not represent hate of the persecutors
</p>
<p>of the people but sorrow for them. They serve, however, as a
</p>
<p>warning to those who without proper investigation allow their
</p>
<p>prejudices to lead them to actions contrary to the spirit of right
</p>
<p>and justice.
</p>
<p>Certainly this book will be read with challenging interest
</p>
<p>by the members of the Church and by others. We should be
</p>
<p>grateful to the compiler for the long hours of tedious work spent
</p>
<p>in making the compilation.

<p>CHAPTER 1
</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith Speaks for Himself
</p>
<p>I was born in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
</p>
<p>and five, on the twenty-third day of December, in the town of
</p>
<p>Sharon, Windsor County, State of Vermont. My father, Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, Sr., left the State of Vermont and moved to Palmyra, Ontario
</p>
<p>(now Wayne) County, in the State of New York, when I was in my
</p>
<p>tenth year, or thereabouts. In about four years after my father's
</p>
<p>arrival in Palmyra, he moved with his family into Manchester, in
</p>
<p>the same County of Ontario.
</p>
<p>Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester,
</p>
<p>there was in the place where we lived an unusual excitement on the
</p>
<p>subject of religion. It commenced with the Methodists, but soon
</p>
<p>became general among all the sects in that region. Indeed, the whole
</p>
<p>district seemed affected by it, and great multitudes united them-
</p>
<p>selves to the different religious parties, which created no small stir
</p>
<p>and division amongst the people, some crying, "Lo here!" and
</p>
<p>others, "Lo there !" Some were contending for the Methodist faith,
</p>
<p>some for the Presbyterian, and some for the Baptist.
</p>
<p>For notwithstanding the great love which the converts to these
</p>
<p>different faiths expressed at the time of their conversion, and the
</p>
<p>great zeal manifested by the respective clergy, who were active in
</p>
<p>getting up and promoting this extraordinary scene of religious feel-
</p>
<p>ing, in order to have everybody converted, as they were pleased to
</p>
<p>call it, let them join what sect they pleased  yet when the converts
</p>
<p>began to file off, some to one party and some to another, it was seen
</p>
<p>that the seemingly good feeling of both the priests and the converts
</p>
<p>were more pretended than real ; for a scene of great confusion and
</p>
<p>bad feeling ensued; priest contending against priest and convert
</p>
<p>against convert; so that all good feelings one for another, if ever
</p>
<p>they had any, were entirely lost in the strife of words and a contest
</p>
<p>about opinions.
</p>
<p>I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My father's family was
</p>
<p>proselyted to the Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined the
</p>
<p>church, namely  my mother, Lucy ; my brothers, Hyrum and Sam-

</p>
<p>uel Harrison, and my sister, Sophronia.
</p>
<p>During this time of great excitement, my mind was called up
</p>
<p>to serious reflection and great uneasiness ; but though my feelings
</p>
<p>were deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these
</p>
<p>parties, though I attended their several meetings as often as occa-
</p>
<p>sion would permit. In process of time my mind became somewhat
</p>
<p>partial to the Methodist Sect, and I felt some desire to be united
</p>
<p>with them but so great were the confusion and strife among the
</p>
<p>different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young
</p>
<p>as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any
</p>
<p>certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong.
</p>
<p>2 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were
</p>
<p>so great and incessant.
</p>
<p>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions I often
</p>
<p>said to myself, What is to be done? Who of all these parties is
</p>
<p>right ; or, are they all wrong together ? If any one of them be right,
</p>
<p>which is it, and how shall I know it?
</p>
<p>While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by
</p>
<p>the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading
</p>
<p>the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads : "If
</p>
<p>any of you lack ivisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
</p>
<p>liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
</p>
<p>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to
</p>
<p>the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to
</p>
<p>enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected
</p>
<p>on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom
</p>
<p>from God, I did ; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could
</p>
<p>get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the
</p>
<p>teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same
</p>
<p>passage of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in
</p>
<p>settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.
</p>
<p>At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain
</p>
<p>in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that
</p>
<p>is, ask of Gad. I at length came to the determination to ask of God,
</p>
<p>concluding that if He gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom,
</p>
<p>and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.
</p>
<p>So in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I
</p>
<p>retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of
</p>
<p>a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and
</p>
<p>twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an
</p>
<p>attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the
</p>
<p>attempt to pray vocally.
</p>
<p>After I had retired to the place I had previously designed to
</p>
<p>go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled
</p>
<p>down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had

</p>
<p>scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some
</p>
<p>power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing
</p>
<p>influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak.
</p>
<p>Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a
</p>
<p>time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.
</p>
<p>But exerting all my power to call upon God to deliver me out of
</p>
<p>the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very
</p>
<p>moment when I was ready to sink in despair and abandon myself to
</p>
<p>destruction  not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some
</p>
<p>actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous
</p>
<p>power as I had never before felt in any being  just at this moment
</p>
<p>of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above
</p>
<p>the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell
</p>
<p>upon me.
</p>
<p>It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the
</p>
<p>enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw
</p>
<p>two personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,
</p>
<p>standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling
</p>
<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF 3
</p>
<p>me by name, and said, pointing to the other  "This is my Beloved
</p>
<p>Son, hear Him!"
</p>
<p>My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which
</p>
<p>of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No
</p>
<p>sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to
</p>
<p>speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the
</p>
<p>light, which of all the sects was right  and which I should join.
</p>
<p>I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were
</p>
<p>all wrong and the Personage who addressed me said that all their
</p>
<p>creeds were an abomination in His sight, that those professors were
</p>
<p>all corrupt; that "they draw near to me with their lips, but their
</p>
<p>hearts are far from me ; they teach for doctrines the commandments
</p>
<p>of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power
</p>
<p>thereof."
</p>
<p>He again forbade me to join with any of them ; and many other
</p>
<p>things did He say unto me, ivhich I cannot write at this time. When
</p>
<p>I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking
</p>
<p>up into heaven.

<p>THE HEAVENLY VISION
</p>
<p>By Orson Pratt
</p>
<p>(Note: Elder Orson Pratt was very familiar with the home life
</p>
<p>of the Prophet Joseph. He stayed at the home of the Prophet when in
</p>
<p>from his missions and knew him as a husband and father, and was
</p>
<p>intimately associated with him in his private affairs. The following
</p>
<p>account of the heavenly vision can therefore be relied upon as a true
</p>

<p>He, therefore, retired to a secret place, in a grove, but a short
</p>
<p>distance from his father's house, and knelt down, and began to call
</p>
<p>upon the Lord. At first, he was severely tempted by the powers of
</p>
<p>darkness, which endeavoured to overcome him; but he continued

</p>
<p>to seek for deliverance, until darkness gave way from his mind;
</p>
<p>and he was enabled to pray, in fervency of the spirit, and in faith.
</p>
<p>And, while thus pouring out his soul, anxiously desiring an answer
</p>
<p>from God, he, at length, saiv a very bright and glorious light in the
</p>
<p>heavens above; tuhich, at first, seemed to be at a considerable
</p>
<p>distance. He continued praying, while the light appeared to be
</p>
<p>gradually descending towards him; and, as it drew nearer, it in-
</p>
<p>creased in brightness, and magnitude, so that, by the time that it
</p>
<p>reached the tops of the trees, the tuhole ivilderness, for some
</p>
<p>distance around, ivas illuminated in a most glorious and brilliant
</p>
<p>manner. He expected to have seen the leaves and boughs of the
</p>
<p>trees consumed, as soon as the light came in contact ivith them; but,
</p>
<p>perceiving that it did not produce that effect, he ivas encouraged
</p>
<p>with the hopes of being able to endure its presence. It continued
</p>
<p>descending, slowly, until it rested upon the earth, and he ivas
</p>
<p>enveloped in the midst of it. When it first came upon him, it pro-
</p>
<p>duced a peculiar sensation throughout his whole system; and, im-
</p>
<p>4 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITHS PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>mediately, his mind was caught away, from the natural objects
</p>
<p>with which he was surrounded; and he was enwrapped in a heavenly
</p>
<p>vision, and saw two glorious personages, who exactly resembled
</p>
<p>each other in their features or likeness. He was informed, that his
</p>
<p>sins iv ere forgiven. He was also informed upon the subjects, which
</p>
<p>had for some time previously agitated his mind, viz., that all the
</p>
<p>religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines ; and,
</p>
<p>consequently, that none of them was acknowledged of God, as his
</p>
<p>church and kingdom. And he was expressly commanded, to go not
</p>
<p>after them; and he received a promise that the true doctrine, the
</p>
<p>fulness of the gospel, should, at some future time, be made known
</p>
<p>to him; after which, the vision withdrew, leaving his mind in a
</p>
<p>state of calmness and peace, indescribable.
</p>
<p>MORONI'S VISIT
</p>
<p>I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the
</p>
<p>twenty-first of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-
</p>
<p>three, all of the time suffering severe persecution at the hands of all
</p>
<p>classes of men, both religious and irreligious, because I continued
</p>
<p>to affirm that I had seen a vision.
</p>
<p>During the space of time which intervened between the time
</p>
<p>I had the vision and the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three 
</p>
<p>having been forbidden to join any of the religious sects of the day,
</p>
<p>and being of very tender years, and persecuted by those who ought
</p>
<p>to have been my friends and to have treated me kindly, and if they
</p>
<p>supposed me to be deluded to have endeavored in a proper and
</p>
<p>affectionate manner to have reclaimed me  I was left to all kinds
</p>
<p>of temptations ; and mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently
</p>
<p>fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of my
</p>
<p>youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say
</p>
<p>led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God. In
</p>
<p>making this confession, no one need suppose me guilty of any great
</p>
<p>or malignant sins. A disposition to commit such was never in my
</p>
<p>nature.
</p>
<p>In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my

</p>
<p>weakness and imperfections; when, on the evening of the above
</p>
<p>mentioned twenty-first of September, after I had retired to bed
</p>
<p>for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to
</p>
<p>Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies and also
</p>
<p>for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and stand-
</p>
<p>ing before Him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine
</p>
<p>manifestation, as I previously had done.
</p>
<p>While I was thus in the act of calling upon God I discovered
</p>
<p>a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until
</p>
<p>the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a person-
</p>
<p>age appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did
</p>
<p>not touch the floor.
</p>
<p>He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a
</p>
<p>whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen ; nor do I believe
</p>
<p>that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white
</p>
<p>and brilliant. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little
</p>
<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF 5
</p>
<p>above the wrists; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs,
</p>
<p>a little above the ankles. His head and neck were bare. I could
</p>
<p>discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was
</p>
<p>open, so that I could see into his bosom.
</p>
<p>Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person
</p>
<p>was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like
</p>
<p>lightning. The room was extremely light, but not so very bright
</p>
<p>as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him I
</p>
<p>was afraid, but the fear soon left me.
</p>
<p>He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a
</p>
<p>messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name
</p>
<p>was Moroni ; that God had a work for me to do ; and that my name
</p>
<p>should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds and
</p>
<p>tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all
</p>
<p>people.
</p>
<p>He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates,
</p>
<p>giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and
</p>
<p>the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness
</p>
<p>of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it; as delivered by the
</p>
<p>Savior to the ancient inhabitants.
</p>
<p>Also, that there were two stones in silver bows  and these
</p>
<p>stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the
</p>
<p>Urim and Thummim  deposited with the plates ; and the possession
</p>
<p>and use of these stones were what constituted "seers" in ancient or
</p>
<p>former times ; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of
</p>
<p>translating the book.
</p>
<p>After telling me these things, he commenced quoting the
</p>
<p>prophecies of the Old Testament. He first quoted part of the third
</p>
<p>chapter of Malachi, and he quoted also the fourth or last chapter
</p>
<p>of the same prophecy, though with a little variation from the way
</p>
<p>it reads in our Bibles. Instead of quoting the first verse as it reads
</p>
<p>in our books, he quoted it thus :
</p>
<p>"For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all
</p>
<p>the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall burn as stubble; for
</p>

</p>
<p>they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it
</p>
<p>shall leave them neither root nor branch."
</p>
<p>And again he quoted the fifth verse thus : "Behold, I tuill reveal
</p>
<p>unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah, the Prophet, before
</p>
<p>the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord"
</p>
<p>He also quoted the next verse differently : "And he shall plant
</p>
<p>in the hearts of the children the promise made to the fathers, and
</p>
<p>the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers; if it were not
</p>
<p>so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at His coming."
</p>
<p>In addition to these he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah,
</p>
<p>saying that it was about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third
</p>
<p>chapter of Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely
</p>
<p>as they stand in our New Testament. He said that the prophet was
</p>
<p>Christ, but the day had not yet come when they who would not
</p>
<p>hear His voice should be cut off from among the people, but soon
</p>
<p>would come.
</p>
<p>He also quoted the second chapter of Joel, from the twenty-
</p>
<p>eighth verse to the last. He also said that this was not yet fulfilled,
</p>
<p>6 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>but was soon to be. And he further stated that the fulness of the
</p>
<p>Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many other passages of
</p>
<p>scripture, and offered many explanations which cannot be men-
</p>
<p>tioned here.
</p>
<p>Again he told me that when I got those plates of which he had
</p>
<p>spoken  for the time that they should be obtained was not yet ful-
</p>
<p>filled  I should not show them to any person; neither the breast-
</p>
<p>plate with the Urim and Thummim ; only to those to whom I should
</p>
<p>be commanded to show them ; if I did I should be destroyed. While
</p>
<p>he was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened
</p>
<p>to my mind that I could see the place where the plates were de-
</p>
<p>posited, and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place
</p>
<p>again when I visited it.
</p>
<p>After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin
</p>
<p>to gather immediately around the person of him who had been
</p>
<p>speaking to me, and it continued to do so, until the room was again
</p>
<p>left dark, except just around him, when instantly I saw as it were,
</p>
<p>a conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended till he entirely
</p>
<p>disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before this
</p>
<p>heavenly light had made its appearance.
</p>
<p>I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling
</p>
<p>greatly at what had been told to me by this extraordinary messen-
</p>
<p>ger, when, in the midst of my meditation, I suddenly discovered
</p>
<p>that my room was again beginning to get lighted, and in an instant,
</p>
<p>as it were, the same heavenly messenger was again by my bedside.
</p>
<p>He commenced, and again related the very same things which
</p>
<p>he had done at his first visit, without the least variation; which
</p>
<p>having done, he informed me of great judgments which were com-
</p>
<p>ing upon the earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and
</p>
<p>pestilence, and that these grievous judgments would come on the
</p>
<p>earth in this generation. Having related these things, he again
</p>
<p>ascended as he had done before.
</p>
<p>By this time, so deep were the impressions made on my mind,
</p>
<p>that sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay overwhelmed in aston-
</p>

</p>
<p>ishment at what I had both seen and heard. But what was my
</p>
<p>surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my bedside,
</p>
<p>and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things
</p>
<p>as before ; and added a caution to me, telling me that Satan would
</p>
<p>try to tempt me (in consequence of the indigent circumstances of
</p>
<p>my father's family), to get the plates for the purpose of getting
</p>
<p>rich. This he forbade me, saying that I must have no other object
</p>
<p>in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must not be
</p>
<p>influenced by any other motive than that of building His Kingdom,
</p>
<p>otherwise I could not get them.
</p>
<p>After his third visit he again ascended into heaven as before,
</p>
<p>and I was again left to ponder on the strangeness of what I had just
</p>
<p>experienced ; when almost immediately after the heavenly messen-
</p>
<p>ger had ascended from me for the third time, the cock crowed, and
</p>
<p>I found that the day was approaching, so that our interviews must
</p>
<p>have occupied the whole of that night.
</p>
<p>I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the
</p>
<p>necessary labors of the day; but, in attempting to work as at
</p>
<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF 7
</p>
<p>other times, I found my strength so exhausted as to render me
</p>
<p>entirely unable. My father, who was laboring- along with me, dis-
</p>
<p>covered something to be wrong with me, and told me to go home.
</p>
<p>I started with the intention of going to the house ; but, in attempt-
</p>
<p>ing to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my strength
</p>
<p>entirely failed me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for a time
</p>
<p>was quite unconscious of anything.
</p>
<p>The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking to me,
</p>
<p>calling me by name. I looked up and beheld the same messenger
</p>
<p>standing over my head, surrounded by light as before. He then
</p>
<p>again related unto me all that he had related the previous night,
</p>
<p>and commanded me to go to my father and tell him of the vision
</p>
<p>and commandments which I had received.
</p>
<p>I obeyed; I returned to my father in the field, and rehearsed
</p>
<p>the whole matter to him. He replied to me that it was of God, and
</p>
<p>he told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger. I left
</p>
<p>the field, and went to the place where the messenger had told me
</p>
<p>the plates were deposited; and owing to the distinctness of the
</p>
<p>vision which I had concerning it, I knew the place the instant that
</p>
<p>I arrived there.
</p>
<p>MORONI'S INSTRUCTIONS
</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the repository, a little exertion in removing
</p>
<p>the soil from the edges of the top of the box, and a light pry, brought
</p>
<p>to his natural vision its contents. While viewing and contemplating
</p>
<p>this sacred treasure with wonder and astonishment, behold! the
</p>
<p>Angel of the Lord, who had previously visited him, again stood in
</p>
<p>his presence, and his soul w r as again enlightened as it was the
</p>
<p>evening before, and he was filled with the Holy Spirit, and the
</p>
<p>heavens were opened, and the glory of the Lord shone round about
</p>
<p>and rested upon him. While he thus stood gazing and admiring,
</p>
<p>the Angel said, "Look !" And as he thus spake, he beheld the Prince
</p>
<p>of Darkness, surrounded by his innumerable train of associates.
</p>
<p>All this passed before him, and the heavenly messenger said, "All
</p>
<p>this is shown, the good and the evil, the holy and impure, the glory

</p>
<p>of God, and the power of darkness, that you may know hereafter
</p>
<p>the two powers, and never be influenced or overcome by that wicked
</p>
<p>one. Behold, whatsoever enticeth and leadeth to good and to do
</p>
<p>good, is of God, and whatsoever doth not, is of that wicked one. It
</p>
<p>is he that filleth the hearts of men with evil, to walk in darkness
</p>
<p>and blaspheme God ; and you may learn from henceforth, that his
</p>
<p>ways are to destruction, but the way of holiness is peace and rest.
</p>
<p>You cannot at this time obtain this record, for the commandment
</p>
<p>of God is strict, and if ever these sacred things are obtained, they
</p>
<p>must be by prayer and faithfulness in obeying the Lord. They are
</p>
<p>not deposited here for the sake of accumulating gain and wealth
</p>
<p>for the glory of this world ; they were sealed by the prayer of faith,
</p>
<p>and because of the knowledge which they contain, they are of no
</p>
<p>worth among the children of men, only for their knowledge. On
</p>
<p>them is contained the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it
</p>
<p>was given to his people on this land ; and when it shall be brought
</p>
<p>8 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>forth by the power of God, it shall be carried to the Gentiles, of
</p>
<p>whom many will receive it, and after will the seed of Israel be
</p>
<p>brought into the fold of their Redeemer by obeying it also. Those
</p>
<p>who kept the commandments of the Lord on this land, desired this
</p>
<p>at his hand, and through the prayer of faith obtained the promise,
</p>
<p>that if their descendants should transgress and fall away, that a
</p>
<p>record should be kept, and in the last days come to their children.
</p>
<p>These things are sacred, and must be kept so, for the promise of
</p>
<p>the Lord concerning them must be fulfilled. No man can obtain
</p>
<p>them if his heart is impure, because they contain that which is
</p>
<p>sacred." * * * "By them will the Lord work a great and marvelous
</p>
<p>work; the wisdom of the wise shall become as naught, and the
</p>
<p>understanding of the prudent shall be hid, and because the power
</p>
<p>of God shall be displayed, those who profess to know the truth, but
</p>
<p>walk in deceit, shall tremble with anger; but with signs and with
</p>
<p>wonders, with gifts and with healings, with the manifestations of
</p>
<p>the power of God, and with the Holy Ghost, shall the hearts of the
</p>
<p>faithful be comforted. You have now beheld the power of God
</p>
<p>manifested, and the power of Satan ; you see that there is nothing
</p>
<p>desirable in the works of darkness; that they cannot bring hap-
</p>
<p>piness ; that those who are overcome therewith are miserable ; while,
</p>
<p>on the other hand, the righteous are blessed with a place in the
</p>
<p>kingdom of God, where joy unspeakable surrounds them. There
</p>
<p>they rest beyond the power of the enemies of truth, where no evil
</p>
<p>can disturb them. The glory of God crowns them, and they con-
</p>
<p>tinually feast upon his goodness, and enjoy his smiles. Behold,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding you have seen this great display of power, by
</p>
<p>which you may ever be able to detect the evil one, yet I give unto
</p>
<p>you another sign, and when it comes to pass then know that the
</p>
<p>Lord is God, and that he will fulfill his purposes, and that the
</p>
<p>knowledge which this record contains will go to every nation, and
</p>
<p>kindred, and tongue, and people under the whole heaven. This is
</p>
<p>the sign: When these things begin to be known, that is, when it
</p>
<p>is known that the Lord has shown you these things, the workers

<p>of iniquity will seek your overthrow. They will circulate falsehoods
</p>
<p>to destroy your reputation; and also will seek to take your life;
</p>
<p>but remember this, if you are faithful, and shall hereafter con-
</p>
<p>tinue to keep the commandments of the Lord, you shall be pre-
</p>
<p>served to bring these things forth; for in due time he will give
</p>
<p>you a commandment to come and take them. When they are
</p>
<p>interpreted, the Lord will give the holy priesthood to some, and
</p>
<p>they shall begin to proclaim this gospel and baptize by water, and
</p>
<p>after that, they shall have power to give the Holy Ghost by the
</p>
<p>laying on of their hands. Then will persecution rage more and
</p>
<p>more; for the iniquities of men shall be revealed, and those who
</p>
<p>are not built upon the Rock will seek to overthrow the church ; but
</p>
<p>it will increase the more opposed, and spread farther and farther,
</p>
<p>increasing in knowledge till they shall be sanctified, and receive
</p>
<p>an inheritance where the glory of God will rest upon them; and
</p>
<p>when this takes place, and all things are prepared, the ten tribes
</p>
<p>of Israel will be revealed in the north country, whither they have
</p>
<p>been for a long season; and when this is fulfilled will be brought

<p>to pass that saying of the prophet : 'And the Redeemer shall come
</p>
<p>to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob,
</p>
<p>saith the Lord.' But, notwithstanding the workers of iniquity shall
</p>
<p>seek your destruction, the arm of the Lord will be extended, and
</p>
<p>you will be borne off conqueror if you keep all his commandments.
</p>
<p>Your name shall be known among the nations, for the work which
</p>
<p>the Lord will perform by your hands shall cause the righteous to
</p>
<p>rejoice and the wicked to rage ; with the one it shall be had in honor,
</p>
<p>and with the other in reproach ; yet, with these it shall be a terror,
</p>
<p>because of the great and marvelous work which shall follow the
</p>
<p>coming forth of the fulness of the gospel. Now, go thy way, re-
</p>
<p>membering what the Lord has done for thee, and be diligent in
</p>
<p>keeping his commandments, and he will deliver thee from tempta-
</p>
<p>tions and all the arts and devices of the wicked one. Forget not
</p>
<p>to pray, that thy mind may become strong, that when he shall
</p>
<p>manifest unto thee, thou mayest have power to escape the evil,

<p>and obtain these precious things. "

<p>Remarkable Visions  1840 By Orson Pratt.
</p>
<p>Continuing the narration of this interview before given, Lucy
</p>
<p>Mack Smith, mother of the Prophet Joseph, relates :
</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the angel told him, at the interview mentioned
</p>
<p>last, that the time had not yet come for the plates to be brought
</p>
<p>forth to the world; that he could not take them from the place
</p>
<p>wherein they were deposited until he had learned to keep the
</p>
<p>commandments of God  not only till he was willing but able to
</p>
<p>do it. The angel bade Joseph come to this place every year, at the
</p>
<p>same time of the year, and he would meet him there and give him
</p>
<p>further instructions.
</p>
<p>"The ensuing evening, when the family ivere all together,
</p>
<p>Joseph made known to them all that he had communicated to his
</p>
<p>father in the field, and also of his finding the record, as well as what
</p>
<p>passed between him and the angel while he ivas at the place where
</p>
<p>the plates were deposited. Sitting up late that evening, in order
</p>
<p>to converse upon these things, together, with over-exertion of mind,

<p>had much fatigued Joseph; and when Alvin observed it, he said:
</p>
<p>'Now, brother, let us go to bed, and rise early in the morning, in

<p>order to finish our day's work at an hour before sunset, then, if
</p>
<p>mother will get our suppers early, we will have a fine long evening,
</p>
<p>and we will all sit down for the purpose of listening to you while
</p>
<p>you tell us the great things which God has revealed to you.'
</p>
<p>"Accordingly , by sunset the next day, ive were all seated, and
</p>
<p>Joseph commenced telling us the great and glorious things ivhich
</p>
<p>God had manifested to him; but, before proceeding, he charged
</p>
<p>us not to mention out of the family that which he was about to say
</p>
<p>to us, as the world ivas so wicked that when they came to a knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of these things they would try to take our lives; and that
</p>
<p>when we should obtain the plates, our names would be cast out as
</p>
<p>evil by all people. Hence the necessity of suppressing these things
</p>
<p>as much as possible, until the time should come for them to go
</p>
<p>forth to the world.
</p>
<p>"After giving us this charge, he proceeded to relate further
</p>
<p>10 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>particulars concerning the work which he was appointed to do,
</p>
<p>and we received them joyfully, never mentioning them except
</p>
<p>among ourselves, agreeable to the instructions which we had re-
</p>
<p>ceived from him. From this time forth, Joseph continued to receive
</p>
<p>instructions from the Lord, and we continued to get the children
</p>
<p>together every evening for the purpose of listening while he gave
</p>
<p>us a relation of the same. I presume our family presented an
</p>
<p>aspect as singular as any that ever lived upon the face of the earth
</p>
<p> all seated in a circle, father, mother, sons and daughters, and
</p>
<p>giving the most profound attention to a boy, eighteen years of age,
</p>
<p>who had never read the Bible through in his life; he seemed much
</p>
<p>less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of our
</p>
<p>children, but far more given to meditation and deep study.
</p>
<p>"We were now confirmed in the opinion that God was about to
</p>
<p>bring to light something upon which we could stay our minds, or
</p>
<p>that would give us a more perfect knowledge of the plan of salva-
</p>
<p>tion and the redemption ol the human family. This caused us
</p>
<p>greatly to rejoice, the sweetest union and happiness pervaded our
</p>
<p>house, and tranquility reigned in our midst.
</p>
<p>"During our evening conversations, Joseph would occasionally
</p>
<p>give us some of the most amusing recitals that could be imagined.
</p>
<p>He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent, their
</p>
<p>dress, mode of traveling, and the animals upon which they rode;
</p>
<p>their cities, their buildings, with every particular; their mode of
</p>
<p>warfare; and also their religious worship. This he would do with
</p>
<p>as much ease, seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life among
</p>
<p>them." History of Joseph Smith, by Lucy Mack Smith, pp. 81-83.

<p>MANY ANGELS VISITED JOSEPH
</p>
<p>I was also informed concerning the aboriginal inhabitants of
</p>
<p>this country, and shown who they were, and from whence they
</p>
<p>came, a brief, sketch of their origin, progress, civilization, laws,
</p>
<p>governments, of their righteousness and iniquity, and the blessing
</p>
<p>of God being finally withdrawn from them as a people was made
</p>
<p>known unto me. I was also told where there was deposited some

<p>plates on which were engraven an abridgment of the records of
</p>
<p>the ancient prophets that had existed on this continent. The angel
</p>
<p>appeared to me three times the same night and unfolded the same
</p>
<p>things. After having received many visits from the angels of God

<p>unfolding the majesty, and glory of the events that should transpire
</p>
<p>in the last days, on the morning of the 22nd of September, A. D.

<p>"But, sir, when I leave the dignity and honor I received from

<p>heaven to hoist a man into power, through the aid of my friends,

<p>plished can look up the clemency, intended as a reciprocation for

<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF 11
</p>
<p>such favors, and where the wicked and unprincipled, as a matter
</p>
<p>of course, would seize the opportunity to flintify the hearts of the
</p>
<p>nation against me for dabbling at a sly game in politics ; verily, I
</p>
<p>say, when I leave the dignity and honor of heaven to gratify the
</p>
<p>ambition and vanity of man or men, may my power cease, like
</p>
<p>the strength of Samson, when he was shorn of his locks, while
</p>
<p>asleep in the lap of Delilah ! Truly said the Savior, 'Cast not your
</p>
<p>pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and
</p>
<p>turn again and rend you/
</p>
<p>"Shall I, who have witnessed the visions of eternity, and
</p>
<p>beheld the glories of the mansions of bliss, and the regions and
</p>
<p>the misery of the damned, shall I turn to be a Judas ? Shall I, who
</p>
<p>have heard the voice of God, and communed with angels, and spake,
</p>
<p>as moved by the Holy Ghost, for the renewal of the everlasting
</p>
<p>covenant, and for the gathering of Israel in the last days, shall I
</p>
<p>worm myself into a political hypocrite? Shall I, who hold the
</p>
<p>keys of the last kingdom, in which is the dispensation of the ful-
</p>
<p>ness of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets,
</p>
<p>since the world began, under the sealing power of the Melchisedec
</p>
<p>Priesthood  shall I stoop from the sublime authority of Almighty
</p>
<p>God to be handled as a monkey's catspaw, and pettify myself into
</p>
<p>a clown to act the farce of political demagoguery ? No, verily no !
</p>
<p>The whole earth shall bear me witness that I, like the towering rock
</p>
<p>in the midst of the ocean, which has withstood the mighty surges
</p>
<p>of the warring waves for centuries, am impregnable, and am a
</p>
<p>faithful friend to virtue, and a fearless foe to vice ; no odds, whether
</p>
<p>the former was sold as a pearl in Asia, or hid as a gem in America,
</p>
<p>and the latter dazzles in palaces, or glimmers among the tombs.
</p>
<p>"I combat the errors of ages ; I meet the violence of mobs ; I
</p>
<p>cope with illegal proceedings from executive authority; I cut the
</p>
<p>Gordian knot of powers; and I solve mathematical problems of
</p>
<p>universities with truth  diamond truth; and God is my 'right-
</p>
<p>hand man.' "

<p>Life of Joseph the Prophet, by Geo. Q. Cannon, p. 432.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2
</p>
<p>The Greatness of the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>By Eliza R. Snow: On my return to Kirtland, by solicitation,
</p>
<p>I took up my residence in the family of the prophet and taught his
</p>
<p>family school. Again I had ample opportunity of judging of his
</p>
<p>daily walk and conversation, and the more I made his acquaintance,
</p>
<p>the more cause I found to appreciate him in his divine calling. His
</p>
<p>lips ever flowed with instructions and kindness ; but, although very
</p>
<p>forgiving, indulgent and affectionate in his nature, when his god-
</p>
<p>like intuition suggested that the good of his brethren, or the in-
</p>
<p>terests of the kingdom of God demanded it, no fear of censure, no
</p>
<p>love of approbation, could prevent his severe and cutting rebukes.
</p>
<p>His expansive mind grasped the great plan of salvation, and solved
</p>
<p>the mystic problem of man's destiny; he ivas in possession of keys
</p>
<p>that unlocked the past and the future, with its successions of
</p>
<p>eternities; yet in his devotions he ivas as humble as a little child.
</p>
<p>Three times a day he had family io or ship; and these precious sea-
</p>
<p>sons of sacred household service truly seemed a foretaste of celestial
</p>
<p>happiness. Women of Mormondom, By E. W. Tullidge, pp. 65-66.
</p>
<p>By Orson Pratt : I had the great privilege when I was in from
</p>
<p>my missions, of boarding most of the time at his house, so that I
</p>
<p>not only knew him as a public teacher, but as a private citizen, as
</p>
<p>a husband and father. I witnessed his earnest and humble devotions
</p>
<p>both morning and evening in his family. / heard the tvords of
</p>
<p>eternal life flowing from his mouth, nourishing, soothing and com-
</p>
<p>forting his family, neighbors and friends. I saiv his countenance
</p>
<p>lighted up as the inspiration of the Holy Ghost rested upon him,
</p>
<p>dictating the great and most precious revelations now printed for
</p>
<p>our guidance. I saiv him translating, by inspiration, the Old and
</p>
<p>New Testaments, and the inspired Book of Abraham from Egyptian
</p>
<p>papyrus. j. d. 7:176.
</p>
<p>By John Taylor: No wonder that Joseph Smith should say
</p>
<p>that he felt himself shut up in a nutshell  there was no power of
</p>
<p>expansion; it teas difficult for him to reveal and communicate the
</p>
<p>things of God, because there ivas no place to receive them. What

</p>
<p>he had to communicate ivas so much more comprehensive, en-
</p>
<p>lightened and dignified than that which the people generally knew
</p>
<p>and comprehended, it was difficult for him to speak; he felt fettered
</p>
<p>and bound, so to speak, in every move he made. j. d. 10:148.
</p>
<p>The principles had placed him in communication tvith the Lord,
</p>
<p>and not only ivith the Lord, but with the ancient apostles and
</p>
<p>prophets; such men, for instance, as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah,
</p>
<p>Adam, Seth, Enoch, and Jesus and the Father, and the apostles that
</p>
<p>lived on this continent as well as those who lived on the Asiatic
</p>
<p>continent. He seemed to be as familiar with these people as we are
</p>
<p>with one another. j. D. 21:94.
</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 13
</p>
<p>By Brigham Young: Those who were acquainted with him
</p>
<p>knew when the Spirit of revelation was upon him, for his counte-
</p>
<p>nance wore an expression peculiar to himself while under that
</p>
<p>influence. He preached by the Spirit of revelation, and taught in
</p>
<p>his council by it, and those who were acquainted with him could
</p>
<p>discover it at once, for at such times there was a peculiar clearness
</p>
<p>and transparency in his face. j. d. 9:89.
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith holds the keys of this last dispensation, and is
</p>
<p>now engaged behind the veil in the great work of the last days. I
</p>
<p>can tell our beloved brother Christians who have slain the Prophets
</p>
<p>and butchered and otherwise caused the death of thousands of
</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints, the priests who have thanked God in their
</p>
<p>prayers and thanksgiving from the pulpit that we have been
</p>
<p>plundered, driven, and slain, and the deacons under the pulpit, and
</p>
<p>their brethren and sisters in their closets, who have thanked God,
</p>
<p>thinking that the Latter-day Saints were wasted away, something
</p>
<p>that no doubt will mortify them  something that, to say the least,
</p>
<p>is a matter of deep regret to them  namely, that no man or woman
</p>
<p>in this dispensation will ever enter into the Celestial Kingdom of
</p>
<p>God, without the consent of Joseph Smith. From the day that the
</p>
<p>Priesthood was taken from the earth to the winding-up scene of
</p>
<p>all things, every man and woman must have the certificate of
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, junior, as a passport to their entrance into the man-
</p>
<p>sion where God and Christ are  I with you and you with me. I can-
</p>
<p>not go there without his consent. He holds the keys of that king-
</p>
<p>dom for the last dispensation  the keys to rule in the spirit world ;
</p>
<p>and he rules there triumphantly, for he gained full power and a
</p>
<p>glorious victory over the power of Satan while he was yet in the
</p>
<p>flesh, and was a martyr to his religion and to the name of Christ,
</p>
<p>which gives him a most perfect victory in the spirit world. He
</p>
<p>reigns there as supreme a being in his sphere, capacity, and calling,
</p>
<p>as God does in heaven. Many will exclaim, "Oh, that is very dis-
</p>
<p>agreeable ! It is preposterous ! We cannot bear the thought !" But
</p>
<p>it is true. /. d. 7:289.

</p>
<p>By John Reid. Lawyer : The first acquaintance I had with Gen.
</p>
<p>Smith was about the year 1823. He came into my neighborhood, be-
</p>
<p>ing then about eighteen years of age, and resided there two years ;
</p>
<p>during which time I became intimately acquainted with him. I do
</p>
<p>know that his character was irreproachable ; that he was well known
</p>
<p>for truth and uprightness ; that he moved in the first circles of the
</p>
<p>community, and he was often spoken of as a young man of intelli-
</p>
<p>gence and good morals, and possessing a mind susceptible of the
</p>
<p>highest intellectual attainments. I early discovered that his mind
</p>
<p>was constantly in search of truth, expressing an anxious desire to
</p>
<p>know the will of God concerning His children here below, often speak-
</p>
<p>ing of those things which professed Christians believe in. I have
</p>
<p>often observed to my best informed friends, (those that were free
</p>
<p>from superstition and bigotry) that I thought Joseph was predes-
</p>
<p>tinated by his God from all eternity to be an instrument in the hands
</p>
<p>of the great Dispenser of all good, to do a great work ; what it was
</p>
<p>I knew not. D.H.C. 1:93.
</p>
<p>14 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>By Parley P. Pratt : Yes, that extraordinary man, whose inno-
</p>
<p>cent blood is yet dripping, as it were, from the hands of assassins
</p>
<p>and their accessories, in the United States, was the chosen vessel
</p>
<p>honored of God, and ordained by angels, to ordain other Apostles
</p>
<p>and Elders, to restore the Church and the Kingdom of God, the
</p>
<p>gifts of the Holy Spirit, and to be a messenger in the spirit, and
</p>
<p>power of Elijah to prepare the way of the Lord! "For, behold, he
</p>
<p>will suddenly come to his temple!"
</p>
<p>Like John, who filled a similar mission preparatory to the first
</p>
<p>advent of the Son of God, he baptized with water unto repentance,
</p>
<p>for the remission of sins; like him, he was imprisoned; and, like
</p>
<p>him, his life was taken from the earth; and, finally, like all other
</p>
<p>true messengers, his message is being demonstrated by its pro-
</p>
<p>gressive fulfillment  the powers, gifts, and signs following the
</p>
<p>administration of his message in all the world, and every minute
</p>
<p>particular of his predictions fulfilling in the order of events, as the
</p>
<p>wheels of time bring them due.
</p>
<p>But in one important point his message differs from all former
</p>
<p>messages. The science of Theology revived by him will never de-
</p>
<p>cline, nor its keys be taken from the earth. They are committed
</p>
<p>to man for the last time. Their consummation will restore the
</p>
<p>tribes of Israel, and Judah, overthrow all corrupt institutions,
</p>
<p>usher in the reign of universal peace and knowledge, introduce tc
</p>
<p>earth her lawful and eternal king, the crucified Nazarene, the
</p>
<p>resurrected Messiah, banish darkness and death, sorrow, mourn-
</p>
<p>ing and tears, from the face of our globe, and crown our race with
</p>
<p>the laurels of victory and eternal life.
</p>
<p>Ages yet unborn will rise up and call him blessed. A thousand
</p>
<p>generations of countless myriads will laud his name and recount
</p>
<p>his deeds, while unnumbered nations bask in the light and enjoy
</p>
<p>the benefits of the institution founded by his instrumentality.
</p>
<p>His kindred, the nation that gave him birth, and exulted at
</p>
<p>his death, nay, his very murderers and their posterity, will yet
</p>
<p>come bending unto him and seek his forgiveness and the benefits

</p>
<p>of his labors.
</p>
<p>But Oh! the pain! the dark despair! the torments of a guilty
</p>
<p>conscience! the blackness of darkness in the lower hell, which the
</p>
<p>guilty wretches will experience before that happy day of deliver-
</p>
<p>ance! Oh! the countless myriads of the offspring of innocent and
</p>
<p>honorable men who will walk the earth, tread on the ashes, or
</p>
<p>plough and reap over the bones and dust of those miserable mur-
</p>
<p>derers and their accomplices who have consented to the shedding
</p>
<p>of innocent blood, ere the final trump shall sound, which calls up
</p>
<p>their sleeping dust from its long slumbers in the tomb, and their
</p>
<p>spirits from the prison of the damned!
</p>
<p>And even when this, to them almost interminable, period has
</p>
<p>rolled away, and they rise from the dead, instead of a welcome
</p>
<p>exaltation to the presence and society of the sons of God, an eter-
</p>
<p>nal banishment awaits them. They never can come where God and
</p>
<p>Christ dwell, but will be servants in the dominions of the Saints,
</p>
<p>their former victims.

<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 15
</p>
<p>By Parley P. Pratt : In Philadelphia I had the happiness of once
</p>
<p>more meeting with President Smith, and of spending several days
</p>
<p>with him and others, and ivith the saints in that city and vicinity.
</p>
<p>During these interviews he taught me many great and glorious
</p>
<p>principles concerning God and the heavenly order of eternity. It
</p>
<p>tvas at this time that I received from him the first idea of eternal
</p>
<p>family organization and in the eternal union of the sexes in those
</p>
<p>inexpressibly endearing relationships ivhich none but the highly
</p>
<p>intellectual, the refined and pure in heart, know how to prize, and
</p>
<p>which are at the very foundation of everything worthy to be called
</p>
<p>happiness. Till then I had learned to esteem kindred affections
</p>
<p>and sympathies as appertaining solely to this transitory state, as
</p>
<p>something from which the heart must be entirely weaned, in order
</p>
<p>to be fitted for its heavenly state. It ivas Joseph Smith who taught
</p>
<p>me how to prize the endearing relationships of father and mother,
</p>
<p>husband and ivife; of brother and sister, son and daughter. It was
</p>
<p>from him that I learned that the ivife of my bosom might be secured
</p>
<p>to me for time and all eternity; and that the refined sympathies and
</p>
<p>affections which endeared us to each other emanated from the
</p>
<p>fountain of divine eternal love. It tvas from him that I learned that
</p>
<p>we might cultivate these affections, and grow and increase in the
</p>
<p>same to all eternity; while the result of our endless union would be
</p>
<p>an offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, or the sands of the
</p>
<p>sea shore. It tvas from him that I learned the true dignity and
</p>
<p>destiny of a son of God, clothed with eternal priesthood, as the
</p>
<p>patriarch and sovereign of his countless offspring. It was from
</p>
<p>him that I learned that the highest dignity of womanhood was to
</p>
<p>stand as a queen and princess to her husband, and to reign for ever
</p>
<p>and ever as the queen mother of her numerous and still increasing
</p>
<p>offspring. * * * Yet, at that time, my dearly beloved brother, Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, had barely touched a single key; had merely lifted a corner
</p>
<p>of the veil and given me a single glance into eternity.

<p>him and the plates from persons who declared they knew he had
</p>
<p>them, and swore they would get them from him. When Oliver
</p>
<p>Cowdery went to Pennsylvania he promised to write me what he
</p>
<p>should learn about these matters, which he did. He wrote me that
</p>
<p>Joseph had told him his (Oliver's) secret thoughts, and all he had
</p>
<p>meditated about going to see him, which no man on earth knew,
</p>
<p>as he supposed, but himself, and so he stopped to write for Joseph.
</p>
<p>. . . When I arrived at Harmony, Joseph and Oliver were coming
</p>
<p>toward me, and met me some distance from the house. Oliver told
</p>
<p>me that Joseph had informed him when I started from home, where
</p>
<p>I had stopped the first night and how I read the sign at the tavern,
</p>
<p>where I stopped the next night, etc., and that I would be there
</p>
<p>that day before dinner, and this was why they had come out to
</p>
<p>meet me; all of which was exactly as Joseph had told Oliver, at
</p>
<p>which I was greatly astonished.

</p>
<p>By Parley P. Pratt : I bear this testimony this day, that Joseph
</p>
<p>16 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>Smith was and is a Prophet, Seer and Revelator  -an Apostle hold-
</p>
<p>ing the keys of this last dispensation and of the kingdom of God,
</p>
<p>under Peter, James and John. And not only that he was a Prophet
</p>
<p>and Apostle of Jesus Christ, and lived and died one, but that he
</p>
<p>now lives in the spirit world, and holds those same keys to usward
</p>
<p>and to this whole generation. Also that he will hold those keys to
</p>
<p>all eternity ; and no power in heaven or on the earth will ever take
</p>
<p>them from him; for he will continue holding those keys through
</p>
<p>all eternity, and will stand  yes, again in the flesh upon this earth,
</p>
<p>the head of the Latter-day Saints under Jesus Christ, and under
</p>
<p>Peter, James and John. He will hold the keys to judge the genera-
</p>
<p>tion to whom he was sent, and will judge my brethren that preside
</p>
<p>over me; and will judge me, together with the Apostles ordained
</p>
<p>by the word of the Lord through him and under his administration.
</p>
<p>When this is done, those Apostles will judge this generation
</p>
<p>and the Latter-day Saints; and they will judge them with that
</p>
<p>judgment which Jesus Christ ivill give unto them; and they will
</p>

<p>By Wilford Woodruff: I have seen men in the days of Joseph
</p>
<p>bring up principles, and read and teach, and advocate theories,
</p>
<p>when the Prophet would say : "It is not right to do so ; they are not
</p>
<p>true." Those men would still argue, maintain their position, and
</p>
<p>they would write in defence of their theories when the Prophet
</p>
<p>condemned them, and they would say: "We have no faith in your
</p>
<p>theory, nor in the system you present." The very moment a man
</p>
<p>does that he crosses the path of the servant of God who is set to
</p>
<p>lead the way to life and salvation. This is one thing that the Elders
</p>
<p>should carefully avoid. The fact is, there are a great many things
</p>
<p>taught in the building up of this kingdom which seem strange to
</p>
<p>us, being contrary to our traditions, and are calculated to try men.
</p>
<p>Brother Joseph used a great many methods of testing the integrity
</p>
<p>of men; and he taught a great many things which, in consequence

<p>of tradition, required prayer, faith, and a testimony from the Lord,
</p>
<p>before they could be believed by many of the Saints. His mind was
</p>
<p>opened by the visions of the Almighty, and the Lord taught him
</p>
<p>many things by vision and revelation that were never taught
</p>
<p>publicly in his days; for the people could not bear the flood of
</p>
<p>intelligence which God poured into his mind. J. D. 5:83.

<p>By Heber C. Kimball: Nearly twenty years ago, I was in a place
</p>
<p>in England in which I felt very curious ; but I did not know at the
</p>
<p>time what it meant. I went through a town called Chadburn, beyond
</p>
<p>Clithero. Before I went there, some persons told me that there was
</p>
<p>no use in my going, and asked me what I wanted to go to Chadburn
</p>
<p>for, saying it was the worst place in the country ; for the sectarian
</p>
<p>priests had preached there faithfully thirty years without making
</p>
<p>any impression. Notwithstanding that, I went, and preached once
</p>
<p>and baptized twenty-five persons, where the priests had not been
</p>
<p>able to do a thing.
</p>
<p>I went through the streets of that town feeling as I never be-
</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 17
</p>
<p>fore felt in my life. My hair would rise on my head as I walked
</p>
<p>through the streets, and I did not then know what was the matter
</p>
<p>with me. I pulled off my hat, and felt that I wanted to pull off my
</p>
<p>shoes, and I did not know what to think of it. When I returned, I
</p>
<p>mentioned the circumstances to brother Joseph, who said: "Did
</p>
<p>you not understand it? That is the place where some of the old
</p>
<p>Prophets traveled and dedicated that land, and their blessing fell
</p>
<p>upon you." J. D. 5:22.
</p>
<p>Blessing given to Joseph the Prophet by his father: A mar-
</p>
<p>velous work and a wonder has the Lord wrought by thy hand, even
</p>
<p>that which shall prepare the way for the remnants of his people
</p>
<p>to come in among the Gentiles, with their fulness, as the tribes of
</p>
<p>Israel are restored. I bless thee with the blessings of thy fathers
</p>
<p>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and even the blessings of thy father
</p>
<p>Joseph, the son of Jacob. Behold, he looked after his posterity in
</p>
<p>the last days, when they should be scattered and driven by the
</p>
<p>Gentiles, and wept before the Lord; he sought diligently to know
</p>
<p>from whence the Son should come who should bring forth the word
</p>
<p>of the Lord, by which they might be enlightened, and brought back
</p>
<p>to the true fold, and his eyes beheld thee, my son; his heart re-
</p>
<p>joiced and his soul was satisfied and he said: As my blessings are
</p>
<p>to extend to the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills; as my
</p>
<p>father's blessings prevailed over the blessings of his progenitors,
</p>
<p>and as my branches are to run over the wall, and my seed are to
</p>
<p>inherit the choice land whereon the Zion of God shall stand in the
</p>
<p>last days, from among my seed, scattered with the Gentiles, shall
</p>
<p>a choice Seer arise, whose bowels shall be a fountain of truth, whose
</p>
<p>loins shall be girded with the girdle of righteousness, whose hands
</p>
<p>shall be lifted with acceptance before the God of Jacob to turn away
</p>
<p>his anger from his anointed, whose heart shall meditate great wis-
</p>
<p>dom, whose intelligence shall circumscribe and comprehend the
</p>
<p>deep things of God, and whose mouth shall utter the law of the
</p>
<p>just and he shall feed upon the heritage of Jacob his father. Thou

</p>
<p>THE PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER OF THE
</p>
<p>PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH
</p>
<p>President Joseph Smith was in person tall and well built,
</p>
<p>strong and active ; of a light complexion, light hair, blue eyes,
</p>
<p>very little beard, and of an expression peculiar to himself, on
</p>
<p>which the eye naturally rested with interest, and was never weary
</p>
<p>of beholding. His countenance was ever mild, affable, beaming with
</p>
<p>intelligence and benevolence; mingled with a look of interest and
</p>
<p>an unconcious smile, or cheerfulness, and entirely free from all
</p>
<p>restraint or affectation of gravity; and there was something con-
</p>
<p>nected with the serene and steady penetrating glance of his eye,
</p>
<p>18 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>as if he would penetrate the deepest abyss of the human heart,
</p>
<p>gaze into eternity, penetrate the heavens, and comprehend all
</p>
<p>worlds.
</p>
<p>He possessed a noble boldness and independence of character ;
</p>
<p>his manner was easy and familiar ; his rebuke terrible as the lion ;
</p>
<p>his benevolence unbounded as the ocean; his intelligence universal,
</p>
<p>and his language abounding in original eloquence peculiar to him-
</p>
<p>self, not polished, not studied, not smoothed and softened by edu-
</p>
<p>cation and refined by art ; but flowing forth in its own native sim-
</p>
<p>plicity, and profusely abounding in variety of subject and manner.
</p>
<p>He interested and edified, while, at the same time, he amused and
</p>
<p>entertained his audience; and none listened to him that were ever
</p>
<p>weary with his discourse. I have even known him to retain a con-
</p>
<p>gregation of willing and anxious listeners for many hours to-
</p>
<p>gether, in the midst of cold or sunshine, rain or wind, while they
</p>
<p>were laughing at one moment and weeping the next. Even his most
</p>
<p>bitter enemies were generally overcome, if he could once get their
</p>
<p>ears.
</p>
<p>I have known him when chained and surrounded with armed
</p>
<p>murderers and assassins who were heaping upon him every possible
</p>
<p>insult and abuse, rise up in the majesty of a son of God and rebuke
</p>
<p>them, in the name of Jesus Christ, till they quailed before him,
</p>
<p>dropped their weapons, and, on their knees, begged his pardon,
</p>
<p>and ceased their abuse.
</p>
<p>In short, in him the characters of a Daniel and a Cyrus were
</p>
<p>wonderfully blended. The gifts, wisdom and devotion of a Daniel
</p>
<p>were united with the boldness, courage, temperance, perseverance
</p>
<p>and generosity of a Cyrus. And had he been spared a martyr's fate
</p>
<p>till mature manhood and age, he was certainly endued with powers
</p>
<p>and ability to have revolutionized the world in many respects, and
</p>
<p>to have transmitted to posterity a name associated with more bril-
</p>
<p>liant and glorious acts than has yet fallen to the lot of mortal.
</p>
<p>As it is, his works will live to endless ages, and unnumbered mil-
</p>
<p>lions yet unborn will mention his name with honor, as a noble in-

<p>strument in the hands of God, who, during his short and youthful
</p>
<p>career, laid the foundation of that kingdom spoken of by Daniel,

</p>

<p>L. 0. LITTLEFIELD MEETS JOSEPH THE PROPHET
</p>
<p>I had read some in the scriptures and heard men often talk
</p>
<p>about the prophets and apostles of the days of the Savior and had
</p>
<p>formed an idea, of course, that they must have been remarkable
</p>
<p>and good men, and the thought that I was to look upon a prophet
</p>
<p>of God in my day  that I was, indeed, in the flesh, to behold a
</p>
<p>person who stood in that near and familiar relationship to God,
</p>
<p>that His will was made manifest to him  was something that
</p>
<p>awakened reflections that my young mind could not well fathom
</p>
<p>or reconcile. But the opportunity came, and I first beheld him a
</p>
<p>tall, well-proportioned man, busily mingling with the members of
</p>
<p>Zion's Camp, shaking hands with them, meeting them with friendly
</p>
<p>greetings and carefully seeing to their comforts. His familiar, yet
</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 19
</p>
<p>courteous and dignified manner, his pleasant and intelligent coun-
</p>
<p>tenance, his intellectual and well-formed forehead, the expressive
</p>
<p>and philanthrophic facial lineaments, the pleasant smile and the
</p>
<p>happy light that beamed from his mild blue eyes; all these were
</p>
<p>among the attractive attributes that at once awakened a responsive
</p>
<p>interest in the mind of every kindly beholder, which increased in
</p>
<p>intensity as the acquaintance continued. With his most familiar
</p>
<p>friends he was social, conversational and often indulged in harm-
</p>
<p>less jokes ; but when discoursing upon complicated topics that per-
</p>
<p>tained to the welfare of individuals or the progressiveness of com-
</p>
<p>munities, his elucidations were clear and so full of common sense
</p>
<p>and genuine philosophy that the candid and fair-minded felt inter-
</p>
<p>ested by his views, though they might decline to entertain or
</p>
<p>promulgate all of the self-evident truths he originated.

</p>
<p>HOSPITALITY OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH
</p>
<p>I often wonder, when I hear brethren and sisters complain at
</p>
<p>the trifling inconveniences which they have to suffer in these
</p>
<p>days, and I think to myself that salvation is worth as much now
</p>
<p>as it was in the commencement of the work. But "all like the pur-
</p>
<p>chase, few the price would pay." How often I have parted every
</p>
<p>bed in the home for the accommodation of the brethren, and then
</p>
<p>laid a single blanket on the floor for my husband and myself, while
</p>
<p>Joseph (the Prophet-N.B.L.) and Emma slept upon the same floor,
</p>
<p>with nothing but their cloaks for both bed and bedding.

<p>NONE COULD COMPREHEND THE PROPHET JOSEPH
</p>
<p>By George Q. Cannon
</p>
<p>There are many, perhaps all of us, that have more or less of
</p>
<p>a desire to conform to the ideas which prevail in the world. These
</p>
<p>ideas we have inherited, and they come natural to us; and not
</p>
<p>having progressed sufficiently to overcome them, we naturally
</p>
<p>lean toward them. We do this in politics, in finance, in trading, in
</p>
<p>almost everything. It seems to be right to us, because all of our

</p>
<p>inherited tendencies are in that direction. If we could have a
</p>
<p>glimpse of heaven, and understand things as they are, we might
</p>
<p>be able to do better; but this is not God's way of doing things.
</p>
<p>He wants us to work out our own development, and to exert the
</p>
<p>powers we have inherited from Him in conquering the wrong ten-
</p>
<p>dencies we have inherited from our fathers. He gives us line upon
</p>
<p>line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; but He
</p>
<p>does not reveal it all at once. At the same time He would like us
</p>
<p>to comprehend more than we do. I have sometimes thought that
</p>
<p>the Prophet Joseph, with the knowledge he possessed and the prog-
</p>
<p>ress he had made could not stay with the people, so slow were we
</p>
<p>to comprehend things and so enshrouded in our ignorant traditions.
</p>
<p>The Saints could not comprehend Joseph Smith; the Elders could
</p>
<p>not; the Apostles could not. They did so a little towards the close
</p>
<p>20 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>of his life; but his knowledge was so extensive and his compre-
</p>
<p>hension so great that they could not rise to it. It was so with
</p>
<p>President Young; and I may say it is so with the leaders of the
</p>
<p>Church now. It is a continual labor on their part to lift the people
</p>
<p>up to the comprehension of the will of God and His purposes con-
</p>
<p>nected with this work. The people are bound down by their tra-
</p>
<p>ditions, and because of this it is rarely that you can get even the
</p>
<p>Elders to see the propriety of certain things.

</p>
<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH'S BROTHER, WILLIAM, TESTIFIES
</p>
<p>Before William Smith, brother of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, died
</p>
<p>he was visited by J. W. Peterson. That gentleman has written an
</p>
<p>account of the interview with father Smith, to Zion's Ensign, a paper
</p>
<p>published at Independence, Missouri. It is written from Bradtville,
</p>
<p>Wisconsin, and is as follows: Brother Briggs and I visited him next
</p>
<p>day after he returned from St. Paul, it being about two weeks before
</p>
<p>his death. We found him able to be about the house and quite willing
</p>
<p>to talk. After passing the time of day, Brother Briggs and he spoke of
</p>
<p>former meetings and finally drifted on to the subject of Brother
</p>
<p>Smith's early boyhood and his knowledge of the rise of the Church,
</p>
<p>Book of Mormon, etc.
</p>
<p>Brother Briggs then handed me a pencil and asked Brother
</p>
<p>Smith if he ever saw the plates his brother had had, from which
</p>
<p>the Book of Mormon was translated.
</p>
<p>He replied : "I did not see them uncovered, but I handled them
</p>
<p>and hefted them while wrapped in a tow frock and judged them
</p>
<p>to have weighed about sixty pounds. I could tell they were plates
</p>
<p>of some kind and that they were fastened together by rings run-
</p>
<p>ning thru the back. Their size was as described in mother's his-
</p>
<p>tory."
</p>
<p>Brother Briggs then asked : "Did any others of the family see
</p>
<p>them?"
</p>
<p>"Yes," said he, "father and my brother Samuel saw them as
</p>
<p>I did while in the frock. So did Hyrum and others of the family."

</p>
<p>"Was this frock one that Joseph took with him especially to
</p>
<p>wrap the plates in?"
</p>
<p>"No, it was his every-day frock such as young men used to
</p>
<p>wear then."
</p>
<p>"Didn't you want to remove the cloth and see the bare plates?"
</p>
<p>said Brother Briggs.
</p>
<p>"No," he replied, "for father had just asked if he might not
</p>
<p>be permitted to do so, and Joseph, putting his hand on them said :
</p>
<p>'No, I am instructed not to show them to any one. If I do, I will
</p>
<p>transgress and lose them again.' Besides we did not care to have
</p>
<p>him break the commandment and suffer as he did before."
</p>
<p>"Did you not doubt Joseph's testimony sometimes?" said
</p>
<p>Brother Briggs.
</p>
<p>"No," was the reply. "We all had the most implicit confidence
</p>
<p>in what he said. He was a truthful boy. Father and mother be-
</p>
<p>lieved him, why should not the children? I suppose if he had told
</p>
<p>crooked stories about other things we might have doubted his
</p>
<p>word about the plates, but Joseph was a truthful boy. That father
</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 21
</p>
<p>and mother believed his report and suffered persecution for that
</p>
<p>belief shows that he was truthful. No sir, we never doubted his
</p>
<p>word for one minute."
</p>
<p>"Well," said Brother Briggs, "it is said that Joseph and the
</p>
<p>rest of the family were lazy and indolent."
</p>
<p>"We never heard of such a thing until after Joseph told his
</p>
<p>vision, and not then, by our friends. Whenever the neighbors want-
</p>
<p>ed a good day's work done they knew where they could get a good
</p>
<p>hand and they were not particular to take any of the other boys
</p>
<p>before Joseph either. We cleared sixty acres of the heaviest timber
</p>
<p>I ever saw. We had a good place. We also had on it from twelve to
</p>
<p>fifteen hundred sugar-trees, and to gather the sap and make sugar
</p>
<p>and molasses from that number of trees was no lazy job. We
</p>
<p>worked hard to clear our place and the neighbors were a little
</p>
<p>jealous. If you will figure up how much work it would take to clear
</p>
<p>sixty acres of heavy timber land, heavier than any here, trees you
</p>
<p>could not conveniently cut down, you can tell whether we were
</p>
<p>lazy or not, and Joseph did his share of the work with the rest of
</p>
<p>the boys."
</p>
<p>"We never knew we were bad folks until Joseph told his vision.
</p>
<p>We were considered respectable till then, but at once people began
</p>
<p>to circulate falsehoods and stories in a wonderful way."
</p>
<p>"Were your folks religiously inclined before Joseph saw the
</p>
<p>angel?" asked Brother Briggs.
</p>
<p>"Yes, we always had family prayers since I can remember.
</p>
<p>I well remember father used to carry his spectacles in his vest
</p>
<p>pocket, (feeling in his lower right hand pocket to show us how
</p>
<p>and where) and when us boys saw him feel for his specs, we knew
</p>
<p>that was a signal to get ready for prayer, and if we did not notice
</p>
<p>it mother would say, 'William,' or whoever was the negligent one,
</p>
<p>'get ready for prayer.' After the prayer we had a song we would
</p>
<p>sing. I remember part of it yet:
</p>
<p>Another day has passed and gone,
</p>
<p>We lay our garments by.

<p>"Hyrum, Samuel, Catharine and mother were members of the
</p>
<p>Presbyterian church. My father would not join. He did not like it
</p>
<p>because a Rev. Stockton had preached my brother's funeral ser-
</p>
<p>mon and intimated very strongly that he had gone to hell, for
</p>
<p>Alvin was not a church member, but he was a good boy, and my
</p>
<p>father did not like it."
</p>
<p>"What caused Joseph to ask for guidance as to what church
</p>
<p>he ought to join," asked Brother Briggs.
</p>
<p>"Why, there was a joint revival in the neighborhood between
</p>
<p>the Baptists, Methodists and Presbyterians and they had succeeded
</p>
<p>in stirring up quite a feeling, and after the meeting the question
</p>
<p>arose which church should have the converts. Rev. Stockton was the
</p>
<p>president of the meeting and suggested that it was their meeting and
</p>
<p>under their care and they had a church there and they ought to join
</p>
<p>the Presbyterians, but as father did not like Rev. Stockton very well,
</p>
<p>our folks hesitated and the next evening a Rev. Mr. Lane of the
</p>
<p>Methodists preached a sermon on : 'What church shall I join?' And
</p>
<p>22 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>the burden of his discourse was to ask God, using as a text: 'If
</p>
<p>any man lack wisdom let him ask of God who giveth to all men
</p>
<p>liberally/ And of course when Joseph went home and was looking
</p>
<p>over the text he was impressed to do just what the preacher had
</p>
<p>said, and going out into the woods with child-like simple trusting
</p>
<p>faith, believing that God meant just what He said, he kneeled
</p>
<p>down and prayed ; and the time having come for the reorganization
</p>
<p>of His church, God was pleased to show him that he should join
</p>
<p>none of these churches, but if faithful he should be chosen to estab-
</p>
<p>lish the true Church." Millennial Star, 56:132-134.
</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH
</p>
<p>By Dr. John A. Widtsoe
</p>
<p>Since I struggled as a boy to find the Church and the message
</p>
<p>of Joseph Smith, I have been overwhelmed by the greatness of the
</p>
<p>Prophet. He towers above all men by his great teachings. Of course,
</p>
<p>he was a man with the frailties of the flesh, but he so lived that
</p>
<p>God spoke to men through him. Indeed, he is the biggest man in
</p>
<p>the history of the world since the Savior lived among men nearly
</p>
<p>two thousand years ago. He was a magnificent type of man. The
</p>
<p>Prophet stands unique among the religious leaders of the world,
</p>
<p>for in practically all of his work in the restoration he had wit-
</p>
<p>nesses. Mohammed, Buddha, Confucius, as examples, each estab-
</p>
<p>lished his work without witnesses, but not so Joseph Smith. There
</p>
<p>were witnesses to the Gold Plates and the Book of Mormon, in the
</p>
<p>visitation of heavenly personages, and in the receiving of many of
</p>
<p>the revelations. His work was inaugurated not by himself alone,
</p>
<p>but by and with witnesses. His teachings clear up so many mis-
</p>
<p>conceptions, that any man who honestly investigates the Prophet
</p>
<p>and his work, must come to a conviction that he was indeed a
</p>
<p>Prophet. Church Section, Deseret News, January 30, 1952.
</p>
<p>JOSIAH QUINCY'S OPINION OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH
</p>
<p>"It is by no means improbable that some future' text book, for

<p>the use of generations yet unborn, will contain a question something

<p>trymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer to that
</p>
<p>interrogatory may be thus written: JOSEPH SMITH, THE MOR-
</p>
<p>MON PROPHET. And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to
</p>
<p>most men now living, may be an obvious commonplace to their de-
</p>
<p>scendants. History deals in surprises and paradoxes quite as star-
</p>
<p>tling as this. The man who established a religion in this age of free
</p>
<p>debate, who was and is today accepted by hundreds of thousands as
</p>
<p>a direct emissary from the Most High  such a rare human being is
</p>
<p>not to be disposed of by pelting his memory with unsavory epithets.
</p>
<p>* * * The most vital questions Americans are asking each other
</p>
<p>today have to do with this man and what he has left us.* * * * Burn-
</p>
<p>ing questions they are, which must give a prominent place in the
</p>
<p>history of the country to that sturdy self-asserter whom I visited
</p>
<p>at Nauvoo. Joseph Smith, claiming to be an inspired teacher, faced
</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 23
</p>
<p>adversity such as few men have been called to meet, enjoyed a brief
</p>
<p>season of prosperity such as few men have ever attained, and,
</p>
<p>finally, forty-three days after I saiv him, went cheerfully to a
</p>
<p>martyr's death. When he surrendered his person to Governor Ford,
</p>
<p>in order to prevent the shedding of blood, the Prophet had a pre-
</p>
<p>sentiment of what was before him. 7 am going like a lamb to the
</p>
<p>slaughter,' he is reported to have said, 'But I am as calm as a sum-
</p>
<p>mer's morning. I have a conscience void of offence and shall die
</p>
<p>innocent.' " Figures of the Past, May 15, 1844.
</p>
<p>ADMONITION TO THE YOUNG
</p>
<p>Oh, that the children who read this Biography would take
</p>
<p>his life for an example, imitate his faith, his humility, his love
</p>
<p>for God and man, his devotion to the truth, his fearlessness in
</p>
<p>clinging to and upholding the right, his firmness and his perfect
</p>
<p>obedience in doing the will of God! If they will do so, their lives
</p>
<p>will be great and useful in the sight of God and man, and their
</p>
<p>eternal reward will be sure. If they will do so, how ample will be
</p>
<p>our reward for the time we have spent in writing the incidents of
</p>
<p>this great and noble life!
</p>
<p>When we recollect that Joseph was only thirty-eight years of
</p>
<p>age at the time he was killed, the work which he was the instrument
</p>
<p>in the hands of God in accomplishing seems truly wonderful. Alone,
</p>
<p>with no one to help him but the Lord, he had started out with the
</p>
<p>determination to obey the commands which he received from
</p>
<p>heaven. He had not learning, he had not wealth, powerful friends
</p>
<p>he had none; but he had what were of greater value to him than
</p>
<p>all these  he had the truth and the authority from God to pro-
</p>
<p>claim it. And the Lord whom he served made him mighty in word
</p>
<p>and in deed. He performed a marvellous work, and in the face of
</p>
<p>obstacles, too, that would have frightened the most of men, and
</p>
<p>which he himself could never have overcome had the Lord not given
</p>
<p>him help.

</p>
<p>OF ALL TIME
</p>
<p>As a son, he was nobility itself, in love and honor of his par-
</p>
<p>ents; as a brother he was loving and true, even unto death; as a
</p>
<p>husband and father, his devotion to wives and children stopped
</p>
<p>only at idolatry. His life's greatest motto after "God and His
</p>
<p>Kingdom" was that of "wives, children and friends."
</p>
<p>Joseph the Prophet, as a friend was faithful, long suffering,
</p>
<p>noble and true to that degree that the erring who did love him were
</p>
<p>reminded that the rod of a friend was better than the kiss of an
</p>
<p>enemy, "while others who sopped in his dish" but bore not re-
</p>
<p>proof, became his enemies, and like Law, Marks, Foster, Higbee
</p>
<p>and others who hated him, conspired to his death.
</p>
<p>As companion, socially, he was highly endowed; was kind,
</p>
<p>generous, mirth loving, and at times, even convivial. He was
</p>
<p>partial to a well supplied table and he did not always refuse the
</p>
<p>wine that "maketh the heart glad." For amusements, he would
</p>
<p>24 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>sometimes wrestle with a friend, or ofttimes would test strength
</p>
<p>with others by sitting upon the floor with feet together and a stick
</p>
<p>grasped between them, but he never found his match. Jokes, re-
</p>
<p>buses, matching couplets in rhymes, etc., were not uncommon.
</p>
<p>But to call for the singing of one or more of his favorite songs was
</p>
<p>more frequent. Of those, "Wives, Children and Friends," "Battle
</p>
<p>of River Russen," "Soldier's Tear," "Soldier's Dream," and "Last
</p>
<p>Rose of Summer," were most common. And yet, although so social
</p>
<p>and even convivial at times, he would allow no arrogance or undue
</p>
<p>liberties, and criticisms, even by his associates, were rarely ac-
</p>
<p>ceptable, and contradictions would rouse in him the lion at once,
</p>
<p>for by no one of his fellows would he be superseded. And while
</p>
<p>with him in such fraternal, social and sometimes convivial moods,
</p>
<p>we could not then so fully realize the greatness and majesty of
</p>
<p>his calling, which, since his martyrdom, has continued to mag-
</p>
<p>nify in our view, as the glories of this last dispensation were more
</p>
<p>fully unfolded to our comprehension.
</p>
<p>One small incident, among the many, I will relate to show
</p>
<p>his playful, familiar, kind and loving nature toward one who to
</p>
<p>him was as a protege or a younger brother. Soon after the Prophet
</p>
<p>escaped from Missouri and arrived at Old Commerce, the future
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, in 1839, I was with him. The people had flocked in from
</p>
<p>the terrible exposures of the past, and nearly every one was sick
</p>
<p>with intermittent or other fevers, of which many died. In this
</p>
<p>time of great sickness, poverty and death, the Prophet called his
</p>
<p>brother, Don Carlos, and cousin, G. A. Smith, as missionaries to
</p>
<p>administer to and to comfort the people. And there being there
</p>
<p>two young Botanic medical students, Doctors Wiley and Pendle-
</p>
<p>ton, he called upon them to prescribe medicine, and called on me
</p>
<p>to follow and take general oversight and care of all the sick, which
</p>
<p>for weekis, I did, without even one night of respiteful sleep. The
</p>
<p>forepart of September, Dr. Wiley became sick unto death, which
</p>
<p>soon occurred, after which the Prophet, too, had a violent attack
</p>
<p>of the prevailing sickness. As Emma was in no degree able to

</p>
<p>care for him, it wholly devolved upon me, and both day and night,
</p>
<p>through a period of little less than two weeks, I was hardly ab-
</p>
<p>sent from his room; as almost his only food was gruel, and about
</p>
<p>the only treatment he would accept was a flush of the colon with
</p>
<p>warm water, perhaps tinctured slightly with capsicum or myrrh,
</p>
<p>or a little soda and salt, both of which were prepared and admin-
</p>
<p>istered by me in the room he occupied; and if any sleep came to
</p>
<p>me it was while lying upon his bed or sitting in my chair. At the
</p>
<p>termination of this sickness and fasting, he arose from his bed
</p>
<p>like a lion, or as a giant refreshed with wine. He went to Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Rigdon with great reproof, commanding him and his house
</p>
<p>to repent; and called for a skiff across the river, and finding Elijah
</p>
<p>Fordham in death's struggle, he commanded him to arise, which
</p>
<p>he did at once, and was made whole, as were others by his admin-
</p>
<p>istrations.
</p>
<p>Soon after the Prophet's recovery, I too, came apparently
</p>
<p>nigh unto death through a violent attack of the fever, through
</p>
<p>which my comfort was kindly looked after by the Prophet.
</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 25
</p>
<p>About the middle of October a letter came to say that my
</p>
<p>dear mother and young sister were apparently near to death, in
</p>
<p>Springfield, Illinois, and were anxious for my return. In my anx-
</p>
<p>iety to again see my mother, I procured quinine, which was just
</p>
<p>becoming known as an antidote for fever, and taking it in large
</p>
<p>quantities, my fever soon abated, and under it's tonic influence
</p>
<p>I fancied I had become well, and in great joy and hope hastened
</p>
<p>preparations to start for the home of my mother and kindred in
</p>
<p>Springfield. My horse was in the yard ready to mount, but I
</p>
<p>wished to take leave of the Prophet, with the hope of again re-
</p>
<p>ceiving his blessings. Of the whole sum I had obtained with which
</p>
<p>to pay for outfit and passage to England, with the Twelve, when
</p>
<p>they could start, to which I had been called by the June Confer-
</p>
<p>ence at Quincy, I had but one ten dollar bill left, and I thought on
</p>
<p>it at least I would pay a tithing; so going to the Prophet I told
</p>
<p>him I was ready to leave, and reaching to him the bill, I said, "As
</p>
<p>this is all I have left, I want to pay a tithe of it." He saw I was
</p>
<p>weak in body and that my heart was sad in leaving him, so think-
</p>
<p>ing to cheer and arouse me, when putting the nine silver dollars
</p>
<p>in my hand he playfully knocked my hand upward, scattering the
</p>
<p>money all over the room. My heart was full of tears, and my emo-
</p>
<p>tions must have vent, so forgetting all about the feeling that
</p>
<p>we were boy companions playing together, I sprang at and
</p>
<p>grappled him so as to teach him a lesson. But the lesson was all
</p>
<p>to me, for on making the one grand effort to throw him, I found
</p>
<p>myself in strength no more than a bullrush as compared with him,
</p>
<p>and as my strength was fictitious and my real recovery but an il-
</p>
<p>lusion, I collapsed and fainted in his arms. He placed me in re-
</p>
<p>pose, gathered up the scattered money, and after a period of
</p>
<p>delay, weak, trembling and desolute, yet determined to start, I
</p>
<p>led my horse to the outer gate, and as I was passing through, with
</p>
<p>the bridle on my arm, his hand detained me, and placing his hands
</p>
<p>upon my head, he seemed to pour out his soul in blessing me. He
</p>
<p>told the Lord I had been faithful to care for others, but I was
</p>

</p>
<p>now worn and sick, and that on my journey I would need His care,
</p>
<p>and he asked that a special guardian might go with me from that
</p>
<p>day and stay with me through all my life. And 0! my dear
</p>
<p>brother, how often have I seen through life the footprints of that
</p>
<p>angel, and knew that his hand had drawn me back from death.
</p>
<p>And then you would have "further truths from the teachings
</p>
<p>of the Prophet." Where shall I commence, and how shall I write
</p>
<p>to your understanding, even the little I may have retained in my
</p>
<p>memory? You will not forget that the march of science through
</p>
<p>the last seventy years has in many things reversed the world's
</p>
<p>thought, changed its "modus" and almost its face, and in fact
</p>
<p>exploded the dogmas of outside theology. Well, the keys to all
</p>
<p>this knowledge were first committed to the Prophet Joseph, as a
</p>
<p>part of the gospel, for the world's benefit, for all of which he was
</p>
<p>derided. He was the first to teach in this age, "substantialism,"
</p>
<p>the eternity of matter, that no part or particle of the great uni-
</p>
<p>verse could become annihilated or destroyed; that light and life
</p>
<p>and spirit were one; that all light and heat are the "Glory of
</p>
<p>26 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>God," which is His power, that fills the "immensity of space," and
</p>
<p>is the life of all things, and permeates with latent life, and heat,
</p>
<p>every particle of which all works are composed ; that light or spirit,
</p>
<p>and matter, are the two first great primary principles of the uni-
</p>
<p>verse, or of Being; that they are self -existent, co-existent, inde-
</p>
<p>structible, and eternal, and from these two elements both our spirits
</p>
<p>and our bodies were formulated, and he gave us to understand
</p>
<p>that there were twelve Kingdoms, or planets, revolving around
</p>
<p>our solar system, to which the Lord gave an equal division of His
</p>
<p>time or ministry; and that now was His time to again visit the
</p>
<p>earth. He taught that all systems of worlds were in revolution,
</p>
<p>the lesser around the greater. He taught that all the animal king-
</p>
<p>doms would be resurrected, and made us understand that they
</p>
<p>would remain in the dominion of those who, with creative power,
</p>
<p>reach out for dominion through the power of eternal lives. He
</p>
<p>taught us that the saints would fill the great West, and through
</p>
<p>Mexico, and Central and South America we would do a great work
</p>
<p>for the redemption of the remnant of Jacob. And he taught us
</p>
<p>relating to the Kingdom of God, as it would become organized,
</p>
<p>upon the earth through "all nations learning war no more," and
</p>
<p>all adopting the God-given constitution of the United States as a
</p>
<p>Paladium of Liberty and Equal Rights.
</p>
<p>But this, of itself, would require a long chapter, which must
</p>
<p>wait until the fulfillment of a prediction by the Prophet, relating
</p>
<p>to a testimony that I should bear, after I had become hoary with
</p>
<p>age, of things which he that day taught to the circle of friends
</p>
<p>then around him, of whom I am the only one living. So here I will
</p>
<p>leave this subject for your further interrogations, and proceed
</p>
<p>to give you, so far as I can, the Prophet's last charge to the
</p>
<p>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
</p>
<p>It was in Nauvoo early in 1844 in an assembly room, com-
</p>
<p>mon to the meeting of a council, or a select circle of the Prophet's
</p>
<p>most trusted friends, including the Twelve, but not all of the con-
</p>
<p>stituted authorities of the Church, for Presidents Rigdon, Law

</p>
<p>or Marks, the High Council, or presidents of quorums were not
</p>
<p>members of that council, which at times would exceed fifty in
</p>
<p>number. Its sittings were always strictly private, and all its rules
</p>
<p>were carefully and promptly observed and though its meetings
</p>
<p>were at times oftener than monthly, and my home at Ramus over
</p>
<p>twenty miles distant, I was present at every session, and being
</p>
<p>about the youngest member of that council, I was deeply im-
</p>
<p>pressed with all that transpired, or was taught by the Prophet.
</p>
<p>Criticism had already commenced by those near him in au-
</p>
<p>thority with regard to his teachings and his doings. And we
</p>
<p>began now, in a degree, to understand the meaning of what he
</p>
<p>had so often publicly said, that, should he teach and practice the
</p>
<p>principles that the Lord had revealed to him, and now requested
</p>
<p>of him, that those then nearest him in the stand would become
</p>
<p>his enemies and the first to seek his life; which they soon did, just
</p>
<p>as he had foretold. And to show you that under conditions then
</p>
<p>existing that the Prophet did not really desire longer to live, and
</p>
<p>that you may see how my mind was in a degree prepared for after
</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 27
</p>
<p>results, I will briefly relate an incident that occurred at his last
</p>
<p>visit to us at Ramus.
</p>
<p>After he had that evening preached with great animation to
</p>
<p>a large congregation, and had blessed nineteen children, he turned
</p>
<p>to me and said, "Benjamin, I am tired, let us go home," which only
</p>
<p>a block distant, we soon reached, and entering we found a warm
</p>
<p>fire with a large chair in front, and my wife sitting near with her
</p>
<p>babe, our eldest, upon her lap, and approaching her, I said, "Now,
</p>
<p>Melissa, see what we have lost by your not going to meeting.
</p>
<p>Brother Joseph has blessed all the children in the place but ours,
</p>
<p>and it is left out in the cold." But the Prophet at once said, "You
</p>
<p>shall lose nothing," and he proceeded to bless our first born, and
</p>
<p>then, with a deep drawn breath, as a sigh of weariness, he sank
</p>
<p>down heavily in his chair, and said, "0, I do get so tired and
</p>
<p>weary, that at times I almost yearn for my rest," and then pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to briefly recount to us some of the most stirring events
</p>
<p>of his life's labors, sufferings and sacrifices, and then he said, "I
</p>
<p>am getting tired and would like to go to my rest."
</p>
<p>And now returning to the council and the last charge. Let
</p>
<p>us remember that by revelation he had organized the Holy Priest-
</p>
<p>hood, and that by command of the Lord (D. & C. 124 and 125) had
</p>
<p>taken from the First Presidency his brother Hyrum to hold as
</p>
<p>Patriarch, the sealing power, the first and highest honor due to
</p>
<p>priesthood; that he had returned the keys of endowments, to the
</p>
<p>last anointing, and sealing, together with the keys for the salva-
</p>
<p>tion for the dead, with the eternity of the marriage covenant and
</p>
<p>the power of endless lives. All these keys he held, and under these
</p>
<p>then existing conditions he stood before that association of his
</p>
<p>select friends, including all of the Twelve, and with great feel-
</p>
<p>ing and animation he graphically reviewed his life of persecution,
</p>
<p>labor and sacrifice for the church and the kingdom of God, both
</p>
<p>of which he declared were now organized upon the earth, the
</p>
<p>burden of which had become too great for him longer to carry,
</p>
<p>that he was weary and tired with the weight he had so long borne,
</p>

</p>
<p>and he then said, with great vehemence: "And in the name of
</p>
<p>the Lord, I now shake from my shoulders the responsibility of
</p>
<p>bearing off the Kingdom of God to all the world, and here and
</p>
<p>now I place that responsibility, with all the keys, powers and
</p>
<p>privileges pertaining thereto, upon the shoulders of you the
</p>
<p>Twelve Apostles, in connection with this council ; and if you will
</p>
<p>accept this, to do it, God shall bless you mightily and shall open
</p>
<p>your way; and if you do it not you will be damned. I am hence-
</p>
<p>forth free from this responsibility and I now shake my garments
</p>
<p>clear and free from the blood of this generation and of all men" ;
</p>
<p>shaking his shirt with great vehemence he raised himself from the
</p>
<p>floor, while the spirit that accompanied his words thrilled every
</p>
<p>heart as with a feeling that boded bereavement and sorrow.
</p>
<p>And now, my dear brother, after 60 years have passed, at 85
</p>
<p>year's in age, I bear to you and to all the world a solemn testi-
</p>
<p>mony of the truth and veracity of what I have written above, for
</p>
<p>although so many years have intervened, they are still in my
</p>
<p>mind, as fresh as when they occurred; no doubt as a part fulfill-
</p>
<p>28 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>raent of a prediction by the Prophet relating to "testimonies I
</p>
<p>should bear of his teachings, after I had become hoary with age."
</p>
<p>There were, my dear brother, other teachings to that coun-
</p>
<p>cil, of which I am not at full liberty to write, but if I had your
</p>
<p>ear, I would remember that the Prophet once said to me : "Benja-
</p>
<p>min, in regard to those things I have taught you privately, that
</p>
<p>are not yet for the public, I give you right when you are so led,
</p>
<p>to commit them to others, for you will not be led wrong in dis-
</p>
<p>cerning those worthy of your confidence."
</p>
<p>Of Brigham Young as President of the Church, I will again
</p>
<p>bear this as a faithful testimony that I do know and bear record
</p>
<p>that upon the head of Brigham Young as chief, with the Apostle-
</p>
<p>ship in full, was by the voice of the Prophet Joseph, in my hearing,
</p>
<p>laid the full responsibility of bearing off the kingdom of God to all
</p>
<p>the world. And I do further bear this as a testimony, faithful and
</p>
<p>true, to the Church and to all the world, that at a conference of the
</p>
<p>whole Church, at Nauvoo, subsequent to the Prophet's death and
</p>
<p>before the return of the absent Apostles, that I sat in the assembly
</p>
<p>near President Rigdon, closely attentive to his appeal to the con-
</p>
<p>ference to recognize and sustain his claim as "Guardian for the
</p>
<p>Church." And was, perhaps, to a degree, forgetful of what I knew
</p>
<p>to be the rights and duties of the apostleship, and as he closed his
</p>
<p>address and sat down, my back was partly turned to the seats
</p>
<p>occupied by Apostle Brigham Young and other Apostles, when
</p>
<p>suddenly, and as from Heaven, I heard the voice of the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph, that thrilled my whole being, and quickly turning around
</p>
<p>I saw in the transfiguration of Brigham Young, the tall, straight
</p>
<p>and portly form the Prophet Joseph Smith, clothed in a sheen
</p>
<p>of light, covering him to his feet ; and I heard the real and perfect
</p>
<p>voice of the Prophet, even to the whistle, as in years past caused
</p>
<p>by the loss of a tooth said to have been broken out by the mob at
</p>
<p>Hiram. This view, or vision, although but for seconds, was to me
</p>
<p>as vivid and real as the glare of lightning or the voice of thunder
</p>
<p>from the heavens, and so deeply was I impressed with what I saw

</p>
<p>and heard in the transfiguration, that for years I dared not tell
</p>
<p>what was given me of the Lord to see. But when in later years I
</p>
<p>did publicly bear this testimony, I found that others had testified
</p>
<p>to having seen and heard the same. But to what proportion of the

<p>congregation that were present, I could never know. But I do know
</p>
<p>that this, my testimony, is true.

<p>The Prophet's lost tooth, to which I allude, was, as generally

<p>understood, broken out by the mob at Hiram while trying to pry
</p>
<p>open his mouth to strangle him with acid, from which time, until
</p>
<p>the tooth was replaced by a dentist neighbor, a year or two previous
</p>
<p>to his death, there had been a whistle-like sound to accompany all
</p>
<p>his public speaking which I again plainly heard at the time of which
</p>
<p>I write. Excerpt from letter of Benjamin F. Johnson to George S. Gibbs.

<p>THE SEER
</p>
<p>The Seer  the Seer  Joseph the Seer 
</p>
<p>I'll sing of the Prophet ever dear,
</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 29
</p>
<p>His equal now cannot be found, 
</p>
<p>By searching the wide world around.
</p>
<p>With Gods he soared in the realms of day ;
</p>
<p>And men he taught the heavenly way.
</p>
<p>'Mid the foaming billows of angry strife 
</p>
<p>He stood at the helm of the ship of life.
</p>
<p>The earthly Seer ; the heavenly Seer,
</p>
<p>I love to dwell on his mem'ry dear ; 
</p>
<p>The chosen of God, and the friend of men,
</p>
<p>He brought the priesthood back again,
</p>
<p>He gazed on the past, on the present too ; 
</p>
<p>And ope'd the heavenly world to view.
</p>
<p>Of noble seed  of heavenly birth,
</p>
<p>He came to bless the sons of earth ;
</p>
<p>With keys by the Almighty given,
</p>
<p>He opened the full rich stores of heaven,
</p>
<p>O'er the world that was wrapt in sable night
</p>
<p>Like the sun he spread his golden light.
</p>
<p>He strove,  0, how he strove to stay,
</p>
<p>The stream of crime in its reckless way 
</p>
<p>He urged the wayward to reclaim ;
</p>
<p>With a mighty mind, and a noble aim.
</p>
<p>The saints ;  the saints ; his only pride,
</p>
<p>For them he lived, for them he died !
</p>
<p>Their joys were his ;  their sorrows too ; 
</p>
<p>He lov'd the saints ;  he lov'd Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>Unchanged in death, with a Savior's love
</p>
<p>He pleads their cause, in the courts above.
</p>
<p>The Seer ;  the Seer  Joseph the Seer !
</p>
<p>0, how I love his memory dear,
</p>
<p>The just and wise, the pure and free,
</p>
<p>A father he was, and is to me.
</p>
<p>Let fiends now rage in their dark hour ;
</p>
<p>No matter, he is beyond their power.

<p>He's free ;  he's free ;  the Prophet's free !

<p>He is where he will ever be.

<p>His home's in the sky ;  he dwells with the Gods

</p>
<p>Persecutions Endured by the Prophet
</p>
<p>and the Saints
</p>
<p>(The following Memorial will only partly reveal the trials and
</p>
<p>persecutions the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Saints had to endure.

</p>
<p>AMERICAN EXILES' MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS
</p>
<p>To the Honorable Senators and Representatives of the
</p>
<p>United States of America, in Congress Assembled.
</p>
<p>We, the undersigned members of the city council of the city of
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, citizens of Hancock County, Illinois, and exiles from the
</p>
<p>State of Missouri, being in council assembled, unanimously and re-
</p>
<p>spectfully, for ourselves and in behalf of many thousands of other
</p>
<p>exiles, memorialize the honorable Senators and Representatives of
</p>
<p>our nation upon the subject of the unparalleled persecution and
</p>
<p>cruelties inflicted upon us and upon our constituents, by the consti-
</p>
<p>tuted authorities of the State of Missouri, and likewise upon the
</p>
<p>subject of the present unfortunate circumstances in which we are
</p>
<p>placed in the land of our exile. As a history of the Missouri outrages
</p>
<p>has been extensively published, both in this country and in Europe,
</p>
<p>it is deemed unnecessary to particularize all of the wrongs and
</p>
<p>grievances inflicted upon us in this memorial ; as there is an abun-
</p>
<p>dance of well-attested documents to which your honorable body can
</p>
<p>at any time refer ; hence we only embody the following important
</p>
<p>items for your consideration :
</p>
<p>First. Your memorialists, as free-born citizens of this great
</p>
<p>Republic, relying with the utmost confidence upon the sacred
</p>
<p>"Articles of the Constitution" by which the several States are bound
</p>
<p>together, and considering ourselves entitled to all the privileges
</p>
<p>and immunities of free citizens in what State soever w r e desired to
</p>
<p>locate ourselves, commenced a settlement in the county of Jack-
</p>
<p>son, on the western frontiers of the State of Missouri in the sum-
</p>
<p>mer of 1831. There we purchased lands from the government;
</p>
<p>erected several hundred houses, made extensive improvements, and
</p>

</p>
<p>shortly the wild and lonely prairies and stately forests were con-
</p>
<p>verted into well cultivated and fruitful fields. There we expected
</p>
<p>to spend our days in the enjoyment of all the rights and liberties
</p>
<p>bequeathed to us by the sufferings and blood of our noble ancestors.
</p>
<p>But alas! our expectations were vain. Two years had scarcely
</p>
<p>elapsed before we were unlawfully and unconstitutionally assailed
</p>
<p>by an organized mob, consisting of the highest officers in the county,
</p>
<p>both civil and military, who boldly and openly avowed their de-
</p>
<p>termination, in a written circular, to drive us from said county.
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 31
</p>
<p>As a specimen of their treasonable and cruel designs, your honor-
</p>
<p>able body are referred to said circular, of which the following is
</p>
<p>but a short extract, namely: "We, the undersigned citizens of
</p>
<p>Jackson county, believing that an important crisis is at hand as
</p>
<p>regards our civil society, in consequence of a pretended religious
</p>
<p>sect of people that have settled and are still settling in our county,
</p>
<p>styling themselves Mormons, and intending, as we do, to rid our
</p>
<p>society, 'peaceably' if we can  'forcibly', if we must; and believing,
</p>
<p>as we do, that the arm of the civil law does not afford us a guaran-
</p>
<p>tee, or at least a sufficient one, against the evils which are now
</p>
<p>inflicted upon us and seem to be increasing by the said religious
</p>
<p>sect, deem it expedient and of the highest importance to form our-
</p>
<p>selves into a company for the better and easier accomplishment
</p>
<p>of our purpose." This document was closed in the following words :
</p>
<p>"We therefore agree after timely warning and receiving adequate
</p>
<p>compensation for what little property they cannot take with them,
</p>
<p>they refuse to leave us in peace as they found us, we agree to use
</p>
<p>such means as may be sufficient to remove them, and to that end
</p>
<p>we each pledge to each other our bodily power, our lives, fortunes,
</p>
<p>and sacred honors."
</p>
<p>To this unconstitutional document were attached the names of
</p>
<p>nearly every officer in the county, together with the names of
</p>
<p>hundreds of others. It was by this band of murderers that your
</p>
<p>memorialists, in the year 1833, were plundered of their property,
</p>
<p>and robbed of their peaceable homes. It was by them their fields
</p>
<p>were laid waste, their houses burned, and their men, women, and
</p>
<p>children, to the number of about twelve hundred persons, banished
</p>
<p>as exiles from the county, while others were cruelly murdered by
</p>
<p>their hands.
</p>
<p>Second. After our expulsion from Jackson county we settled
</p>
<p>in Clay county, on the opposite side of the Missouri river, where
</p>
<p>we purchased lands both from the old settlers and from the land
</p>
<p>office; but soon we were again violently threatened by mobs, and
</p>
<p>obliged to leave our homes and seek out a new location.

</p>
<p>Third. Our next settlement was in Caldwell county, where we
</p>
<p>purchased the most of the lands in said county, besides a part of the
</p>
<p>lands in Daviess and Carroll counties. These counties were almost
</p>
<p>entirely in a wild and uncultivated state, but by the persevering
</p>
<p>industry of our citizens, large and extensive farms were opened in
</p>
<p>every direction, well stocked with numerous flocks and herds. We
</p>
<p>also commenced settlements in several other counties of the State,
</p>
<p>and once more confidently hoped to enjoy the hard earned fruits
</p>
<p>of our labor unmolested ; but our hopes were soon blasted. The cruel
</p>
<p>and murderous spirit which first began to manifest itself in the
</p>
<p>constituted authorities and inhabitants of Jackson county, and
</p>
<p>afterwards in Clay and the surrounding counties, receiving no
</p>
<p>check either from the civil or military power of the State, had in
</p>
<p>the meantime, taken courage, and boldly and fearlessly spread its
</p>
<p>contaminating and treasonable influence into every department of
</p>
<p>the government of said State. Lieutenant Governor Boggs, a resi-
</p>
<p>dent of Jackson county, who acted a conspicuous part in our ex-
</p>
<p>32 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>pulsion from said county, instead of being tried for treason and
</p>
<p>rebellion against the constitution, and suffering the just penalty
</p>
<p>of his crimes, was actually elected Governor and placed in the ex-
</p>
<p>ecutive chair. Thus the inhabitants of the State were greatly en-
</p>
<p>couraged to renew and with redoubled fury their unlawful attack
</p>
<p>upon our defenseless settlements. Men, women, and children were
</p>
<p>driven in every direction before their merciless persecutors. Robbed
</p>
<p>of their possessions, their property, their provisions, and their all ;
</p>
<p>cast forth upon the bleak snowy prairies, houseless and unprotected,
</p>
<p>many sank down and expired under their accumulated sufferings,
</p>
<p>while others, after enduring hunger and the severities of the sea-
</p>
<p>son, suffering all but death, arrived in Caldwell county, to which
</p>
<p>place they were driven from all the surrounding counties only to
</p>
<p>witness a still more heart-rending scene. In vain had we appealed
</p>
<p>to the constituted authorities of Missouri for protection and re-
</p>
<p>dress of our former grievances ; in vain we now stretched out our
</p>
<p>hands, and appealed, as the citizens of this great Republic, to the
</p>
<p>sympathies  to the justice and magnanimity of those in power; in
</p>
<p>vain we implored, again and again, at the feet of Governor Boggs,
</p>
<p>our former persecutor, aid and protection against the ravages and
</p>
<p>murders now inflicted upon our defenseless and unoffending citi-
</p>
<p>zens. The cry of American citizens, already twice driven and de-
</p>
<p>prived of liberty, could not penetrate their adamantine hearts. The
</p>
<p>Governor, instead of sending us aid, issued a proclamation for our
</p>
<p>EXTERMINATION AND BANISHMENT; ordered out the forces
</p>
<p>of the State, placed them under the command of General Clarke,
</p>
<p>who to execute these exterminating orders, marched several thou-
</p>
<p>sand troops into our settlements in Caldwell county, where, un-
</p>
<p>restrained by fear of law or justice, and urged on by the highest
</p>
<p>authority of the State, they laid waste our fields of corn, shot down
</p>
<p>our cattle and hogs for sport, burned our dwellings, inhumanly
</p>
<p>butchered some eighteen or twenty defenseless citizens, dragged
</p>
<p>from their hiding places little children, and placed the muzzles of
</p>
<p>their guns to their heads, shot them with the most horrid oaths

</p>
<p>and imprecations. An aged hero and patriot of the revolution, who
</p>
<p>served under General Washington, while in the act of pleading
</p>
<p>for quarter, was cruelly murdered and hewed in pieces with an
</p>
<p>old corn-cutter ; and in addition to all these savage acts of barbarity,
</p>
<p>they forcibly dragged virtuous and inoffensive females from their
</p>
<p>dwellings, bound them upon benches used for public worship, where
</p>
<p>they, in great numbers ravished them in a most brutal manner.
</p>
<p>Some fifty or sixty of the citizens were thrust into prisons and
</p>
<p>dungeons, where, bound in chains, they were fed on human flesh,
</p>
<p>while their families and some fifteen thousand others, were, at the
</p>
<p>point of the bayonet, forcibly expelled from the State. In the mean-
</p>
<p>time, to pay the expenses of these horrid outrages, they confiscated
</p>
<p>our property and robbed us of all our possessions. Before our final
</p>
<p>expulsion, with a faint and lingering hope, we petitioned the State
</p>
<p>Legislature, then in session; unwilling to believe that American
</p>
<p>citizens could appeal in vain for a restoration of liberty, cruelly
</p>
<p>wrested from them by cruel tyrants. But in the language of our
</p>
<p>noble ancestors "our repeated petitions were only answered by
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 33
</p>
<p>repeated injuries." The Legislature, instead of hearing the cries of
</p>
<p>15,000 suffering, bleeding, unoffending citizens, sanctioned and
</p>
<p>sealed the unconstitutional acts of the Governor and his troops, by
</p>
<p>appropriating 200,000 dollars to defray the expenses of exterminat-
</p>
<p>ing us from the State.
</p>
<p>No friendly arm was stretched out to protect us. The last ray
</p>
<p>of hope for redress in that State was now entirely extinguished.
</p>
<p>We saw no other alternative but to bow down our necks, and wear
</p>
<p>the cruel yoke of oppression, and quietly and submissively suffer
</p>
<p>ourselves to be banished as exiles from our possessions, our prop-
</p>
<p>erty, our sacred homes; or otherwise see our wives and children
</p>
<p>coldly murdered and butchered by tyrants in power.
</p>
<p>Fourth. Our next permanent settlement was in the land of
</p>
<p>our exile, the State of Illinois, in the spring of 1839. But even here
</p>
<p>we are not secure from our relentless persecutor, the State of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri. Not satisfied in having drenched her soil in the blood of
</p>
<p>innocence, and expelling us from her borders, she pursues her un-
</p>
<p>fortunate victims into banishment, seizing upon and kidnapping
</p>
<p>them in their defenseless moments, dragging them across the
</p>
<p>Mississippi river upon their inhospitable shores, where they are
</p>
<p>tortured, whipped, immured in dungeons, and hung by the neck
</p>
<p>without any legal process whatever. We have memorialized the
</p>
<p>former executive of this state, Governor Carlin, upon these lawless
</p>
<p>outrages committed upon our citizens, but he rendered us no pro-
</p>
<p>tection. Missouri, receiving no check in her murderous career,
</p>
<p>continues her depredations, again and again kidnapping our citi-
</p>
<p>zens, and robbing us of our property ; w T hile others who fortunately
</p>
<p>survived the execution of her bloody edicts, are again and again
</p>
<p>demanded by the executive of that state, on pretense of some crime,
</p>
<p>said to have been committed by them during the exterminating
</p>
<p>expedition against our people. As an instance, General Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, one of your memorialists, has been three times demanded,
</p>
<p>tried, and acquitted by the courts of this state, upon investigation
</p>
<p>under writs of habeas corpus, once by the United States court for

</p>
<p>the district of Illinois, again by the Circuit Court of the State of
</p>
<p>Illinois, and lastly, by the municipal court of the City of Nauvoo,
</p>
<p>when at the same time a nulle prosequi had been entered by the
</p>
<p>courts of Missouri, upon all cases of that state against Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith and others. Thus the said Joseph Smith has been several
</p>
<p>times tried for the same alleged offense, put in jeopardy of life and
</p>
<p>limb, contrary to the fifth article of the amendments to the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of these United States ; and thus we have been continually
</p>
<p>harassed and robbed of our money to defray the expense of those
</p>
<p>vexatious prosecutions. And what at the present time seems to
</p>
<p>be still more alarming, is the hostility manifested by some of the
</p>
<p>authorities and citizens of this State. Conventions have been
</p>
<p>called; inflammatory speeches made; and many unlawful and un-
</p>
<p>constitutional resolutions adopted, to deprive us of our rights, our
</p>
<p>liberties, and the peaceable enjoyment of our possessions. From
</p>
<p>the present hostile aspect, and from bitter experience in the State
</p>
<p>of Missouri, it is greatly feared that the barbarous scenes acted in
</p>
<p>34 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>that state will be reacted in this. If Missouri goes unpunished,
</p>
<p>others will be greatly encouraged to follow her murderous examples.
</p>
<p>The afflictions of your memorialists have already been overwhelm-
</p>
<p>ing, too much for humanity, too much for American citizens to
</p>
<p>endure without complaint. We have groaned under the iron hand
</p>
<p>of tyranny and oppression these many years. We have been robbed
</p>
<p>of our property to the amount of two millions of dollars. We have
</p>
<p>been hunted as the wild beasts of the forest. We have seen our aged
</p>
<p>fathers who fought in the Revolution, and our innocent children,
</p>
<p>alike slaughtered by our persecutors. We have seen the fair daugh-
</p>
<p>ters of American citizens insulted and abused in the most inhuman
</p>
<p>manner, and finally we have seen fifteen thousand souls, men,
</p>
<p>women, and children, driven by force of arms, during the severities
</p>
<p>of winter, from their sacred homes and firesides, to a land of
</p>
<p>strangers, penniless and unprotected. Under all these afflicting
</p>
<p>circumstances, we imploringly stretch forth our hands towards the
</p>
<p>highest councils of our nation, and humbly appeal to the illustrious
</p>
<p>Senators and Representatives of a great and free people for re-
</p>
<p>dress and protection.
</p>
<p>Hear, hear the petitioning voice of many thousands of
</p>
<p>American citizens who now groan in exile on Columbia's free soil.
</p>
<p>Hear, hear the weeping and bitter lamentations of widows and
</p>
<p>orphans, whose husbands and fathers have been cruelly martyred in
</p>
<p>the land where the proud eagle exultingly floats. Let it not be
</p>
<p>recorded in the archives of the nations, that Columbia's exiles
</p>
<p>sought protection and redress at your hands, but sought it in vain.
</p>
<p>It is your power to save us, our wives, and our children, from a
</p>
<p>repetition of the blood-thirsty scenes of Missouri, and thus greatly
</p>
<p>relieve the fears of a persecuted and injured people, and your pe-
</p>
<p>titioners will ever pray.
</p>
<p>The names of the members of the city council, as petitioners, are
</p>
<p>omitted for want of space. The foregoing memorial was presented
</p>
<p>to congress in the spring of 1844, making the third time that those
</p>
<p>horrid scenes of murder have been laid before them since the begin-

<p>ning of our exile, but all to no purpose. Our petitions are unheeded
</p>
<p>or treated with contempt. And thousands of American citizens must
</p>
<p>linger out a life of wretched exile, deprived of the use of their own
</p>
<p>lands, and of the sacred rights of American Liberty.

<p>APPEAL FOR AID AGAINST MOBS AND PERSECUTION
</p>
<p>(Letter to the President of the United States and
</p>
<p>the Governors of the Respective States.)
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, Illinois, April 24, 1845.
</p>
<p>His Excellency James K. Polk,
</p>
<p>President of the United States
</p>
<p>Hon. Sir:
</p>
<p>Suffer us, Sir, in behalf of a disfranchised and long afflicted
</p>
<p>people to prefer a few suggestions for your serious consideration
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 35
</p>
<p>in hope of a friendly and unequivocal response, at as early a period
</p>
<p>as may suit your convenience, and the extreme urgency of the case
</p>
<p>seem to demand.
</p>
<p>It is not our present design to detail the multiplied and aggra-
</p>
<p>vated wrongs that we have received in the midst of a nation that
</p>
<p>gave us birth. Most of us have long been loyal citizens of some one
</p>
<p>of these United States over which you have the honor to preside,
</p>
<p>while a few only claim the privileges of peaceable and lawful emi-
</p>
<p>grants designing to make the Union our permanent residence.
</p>
<p>We say we are a disfranchised people. We are privately told
</p>
<p>by the highest authorities of this state that it is neither prudent
</p>
<p>nor safe for us to vote at the polls, still we have continued to main-
</p>
<p>tain our right to vote, until the blood of our best men has been shed,
</p>
<p>both in Missouri and Illinois, with impunity.
</p>
<p>You are doubtless somewhat familiar with the history of our
</p>
<p>extermination from the state of Missouri, wherein scores of our
</p>
<p>brethren were massacred, hundreds died through want and sick-
</p>
<p>ness occasioned by their unparalleled sufferings ; some millions of
</p>
<p>our property were confiscated or destroyed, and some fifteen thou-
</p>
<p>sand souls fled for their lives to the then hospitable and peaceful
</p>
<p>shores of Illinois; and that the state of Illinois granted to us a
</p>
<p>liberal charter (for the term of perpetual succession) under whose
</p>
<p>provision private rights have become invested, and the largest city
</p>
<p>in the state has grown up, numbering about twenty thousand in-
</p>
<p>habitants.
</p>
<p>But Sir, the startling attitude recently assumed by the State
</p>
<p>of Illinois forbids us to think that her designs are any less vin-
</p>
<p>dictive than those of Missouri. She has already used the military
</p>
<p>of the state with the executive at their head to coerce and surren-
</p>
<p>der up our best men to unparalleled murder, and that too under
</p>
<p>the most sacred pledges of protection and safety. As a salvo for
</p>
<p>such unearthly perfidy and guilt she told us through her highest
</p>
<p>executive officer, that the laws should be magnified and the mur-
</p>
<p>derers brought to justice; but the blood of her innocent victims had

<p>not been wholly wiped from the floor of the awful arena, where the
</p>
<p>citizens of a sovereign state pounced upon two defenseless serv-
</p>
<p>ants of God our Prophet and our Patriarch, before the senate of
</p>
<p>that state rescued one of the indicted actors in that mournful
</p>
<p>tragedy from the sheriff of Hancock county and gave him an hon-
</p>
<p>orable seat in her hall of legislation, and all who were indicted by
</p>
<p>the grand jury of Hancock county for the murder of Generals
</p>
<p>Joseph and Hyrum Smith are suffered to roam at large watching

<p>for further prey.
</p>
<p>To crown the climax of those bloody deeds the state has re-

<p>pealed all those chartered rights, by which we might have lawfully
</p>
<p>defended ourselves against aggressors. If we defend ourselves

<p>hereafter against violence whether it comes under the shadow of
</p>
<p>law or otherwise (for we have reason to expect it both ways) we
</p>
<p>shall then be charged with treason and suffer the penalty ; and if
</p>
<p>we continue passive and non-resistant we must certainly expect
</p>
<p>to perish, for our enemies have sworn it.
</p>
<p>36 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>And here, Sir, permit us to state that General Joseph Smith,
</p>
<p>during his short life, was arraigned at the bar of his country about
</p>
<p>fifty times charged with criminal offenses, but was acquitted every
</p>
<p>time by his country, his enemies, or rather his religious opponents,
</p>
<p>almost invariably being his judges. And we further testify that
</p>
<p>as a people, we are law abiding, peaceable, and without crime and
</p>
<p>we challenge the world to prove the contrary ; and while other less
</p>
<p>cities in Illinois have had special courts instituted to try their
</p>
<p>criminals, we have been stripped of every source of arraigning
</p>
<p>marauders and murderers who are prowling around to destroy us
</p>
<p>except the common magistracy.
</p>
<p>With these facts before you, Sir, will you write to us without
</p>
<p>delay as a father and friend and advise us what to do. We are
</p>
<p>members of the same great confederacy. Our fathers, nay some of
</p>
<p>us, have fought and bled for our country, and we love her Con-
</p>
<p>stitution dearly.
</p>
<p>In the name of Israel's God and by virtue of multiplied ties of
</p>
<p>country and kindred, we ask your friendly interposition in our
</p>
<p>favor. Will it be too much for us to ask you to convene a special
</p>
<p>session of congress and furnish us an asylum, where we can enjoy
</p>
<p>our rights of conscience and religion unmolested? Or, will you in
</p>
<p>a special message to that body, when convened recommend a
</p>
<p>remonstrance against such unhallowed acts of oppression and ex-
</p>
<p>patriation as this people have continued to receive from the states
</p>
<p>of Missouri and Illinois? Or, will you favor us by your personal
</p>
<p>influence and by your official rank ? Or will you express our views
</p>
<p>concerning what is called the 'Great Western Measure' of colonizing
</p>
<p>the Latter-day Saints in Oregon, the northwestern territory, or
</p>
<p>some location remote from the states, where the hand of oppression
</p>
<p>shall not crush every noble principle and extinguish every patriotic
</p>
<p>feeling?
</p>
<p>And now, Honored Sir, having reached out our imploring hands
</p>
<p>to you, with deep solemnity, we would importune with you as a
</p>
<p>father, a friend, a patriot and the head of a mighty nation, by the

</p>
<p>have fought for the independence of this Republic, by the blood of

<p>the martyrs which has been shed in our midst, by the wailings of

<p>the widows and orphans, by their murdered fathers and mothers,

<p>brothers and sisters, wives and children, by the dread of
</p>
<p>immediate destruction from secret combinations now forming for
</p>
<p>our overthrow, and by every endearing tie that binds man to man
</p>
<p>and renders life bearable, and that too, for aught we know for the

<p>last time, that you will lend your immediate aid to quell the violence

<p>we may colonize in peace and safety as soon as circumstances will

<p>MISSOURI MOBOCRACY
</p>
<p>A pitiable yielding to murderous hate was exhibited in June,
</p>
<p>1843, by Reynolds and Ford, the governors respectively of the
</p>
<p>great states of Missouri and Illinois. The adviser of Reynolds
</p>
<p>was John C. Bennett, the corrupt traitor ; the adviser of Ford was
</p>
<p>Sam C. Owens, one of the leaders of the Jackson mob.
</p>
<p>On the 13th day of June, Thomas Reynolds, governor of the
</p>
<p>state of Missouri, made a requisition upon the state of Illinois for
</p>
<p>the person of Joseph Smith, Jun., charged with treason, on the
</p>
<p>ground that he was a fugitive from justice. To show the close
</p>
<p>communion of the quartette, Reynolds, Bennett, Ford and Owens, it
</p>
<p>is well to note that Bennett and Owens, before any papers were
</p>
<p>issued, made their boasts that the governors of the two states
</p>
<p>would comply with their demands, and that Joseph Smith would
</p>
<p>be delivered to death at the hands of his old enemies in Missouri.
</p>
<p>And on the 10th of June, three days before the requisition was

</p>
<p>issued, Sam Owens and John C. Bennett had informed Governor
</p>
<p>Ford by letter that Joseph Reynolds, sheriff of Jackson County,
</p>
<p>(although the alleged offense of treason had been committed in
</p>
<p>Daviess County) would be appointed by Governor Reynolds of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri to receive the person of Joseph Smith from the officials of
</p>
<p>Illinois; and they, in the same letter, instructed Governor Ford to
</p>
<p>appoint Harmon T. Wilson of Hancock County, to serve the writ
</p>
<p>which they demanded Ford to issue. Their reason for wanting
</p>
<p>Reynolds of Jackson County is clear; he was known to be in
</p>
<p>sympathy with the mob there, while the officers of Daviess County
</p>
<p>might have an abhorrence of murder and might refuse to be so
</p>
<p>pliant as the assassins desired. While their reason for demanding
</p>
<p>the appointment of Harmon T. Wilson was stated in a letter to
</p>
<p>Ford by Sam C. Owens in the following words:
</p>
<p>"Dr. Bennett further writes me that he has made an arrange-
</p>
<p>38 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>merit with Harmon T. Wilson, of Hancock County, (Carthage, seat
</p>
<p>of justice,) in whose hands he wishes the writ that shall be issued
</p>
<p>by you to be put."
</p>
<p>The plan as dictated to the governors by these villians was
</p>
<p>executed.
</p>
<p>On the same day that the governor of Missouri appointed
</p>
<p>Reynolds to go to Illinois after the person of the Prophet, Joseph
</p>
<p>started with Emma and their children to see her sister Mrs. Was-
</p>
<p>son who lived near Dixon, Lee County, Illinois. Five days later,
</p>
<p>on the 18th of June, a message was received at Xauvoo from Judge
</p>
<p>James Adams, of Springfield, from which it was learned that Ford
</p>
<p>had issued the writ for Joseph and that it was on the way. Hyrum
</p>
<p>Smith immediately sent Stephen Markham and William Clayton
</p>
<p>on horseback, William riding Joe Duncan, to find and warn the
</p>
<p>Prophet. These devoted men traveled two hundred and twelve
</p>
<p>miles in sixty-six hours, and found Joseph between the town of
</p>
<p>Dixon and Wasson's place. When they told him of the danger he
</p>
<p>said:
</p>
<p>"Do not be alarmed, I have no fear, and shall not flee. I will
</p>
<p>find friends and the Missourians cannot slay me, I tell you in the
</p>
<p>name of Israel's God."
</p>
<p>Wilson and Reynolds had disguised themselves and proposed
</p>
<p>to be "Mormon" Elders, following Joseph to Wesson's. On the 23rd
</p>
<p>of June they reached that place while the family were at dinner
</p>
<p>and said: "We want to see Brother Joseph."
</p>
<p>They seized him the instant they found him and presented
</p>
<p>cocked pistols to his breast, without showing any writ or serving
</p>
<p>any process. Joseph enquired: "What is the meaning of this?"
</p>
<p>And Reynolds replied : "God damn you, be still, or Til shoot
</p>
<p>you, by God."
</p>
<p>Wilson joined in this awful profanity and threat, and they
</p>
<p>both struck the Prophet with their pistols. He only said:
</p>
<p>"Kill me if you will, I am not afraid to die; and I have en-
</p>
<p>dured so much oppression that I am weary of life. But I am a

</p>
<p>strong man, and I could cast both of you down, if I would. If you
</p>
<p>have any legal process to serve, present it, for I am at all times
</p>
<p>subject to law and shall not offer resistance."
</p>
<p>At this time, Stephen Markham walked toward them and
</p>
<p>the kidnappers swore they would kill him; but he paid no atten-
</p>
<p>tion to their threats. Still bruising the Prophet with their pistols
</p>
<p>and threatening every instant to kill him if he spoke, they dragged
</p>
<p>him to a wagon without, and would have driven away not permit-
</p>
<p>ting him to say one word to his family or to obtain his hat and coat,
</p>
<p>but Stephen Markham interposed. He boldly seized the horses by
</p>
<p>the bits, and would not let them go until Emma could run from the
</p>
<p>house with the Prophet's clothing.
</p>
<p>Stephen mounted a horse and started to Dixon where the
</p>
<p>kidnappers also proceeded at full speed without even allowing
</p>
<p>Joseph to speak to his wife or little children. The wretches had
</p>
<p>not shown any writ, nor had they told the Prophet what w r as the
</p>
<p>charge against him. During the whole journey of eight miles to
</p>
<p>Dixon they continued to strike his sides with their pistols and to
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 39
</p>
<p>swear that they would have his life. So brutal were their blows
</p>
<p>that he almost fainted, and each side was turned black and blue for
</p>
<p>a circumference of eighteen inches.
</p>
<p>At Dixon they thrust him into a room at the tavern and
</p>
<p>guarded him there, while ordering fresh horses to be ready in
</p>
<p>five minutes. As Stephen Markham had raised an alarm at Dixon
</p>
<p>and proposed to get a lawyer, Reynolds once more declared his in-
</p>
<p>tention to shoot the Prophet. Joseph said : "Why do you make this
</p>
<p>threat so often. If you want to shoot me, do so. I am not afraid."
</p>
<p>The continued calmness and the undaunted heroism of the
</p>
<p>Prophet had their effect upon his captors ; and at last they desisted
</p>
<p>from their threats, although they continued their abuse. No doubt
</p>
<p>they would have killed him but they were too cowardly. They want-
</p>
<p>ed to get him into Missouri where the murder could be consum-
</p>
<p>mated without any danger to them. The lawyers whom Stephen
</p>
<p>secured for the Prophet were not permitted by Reynolds and Wilson
</p>
<p>to consult their client; but the effect of this high-handed proceed-
</p>
<p>ing was to arouse the indignation of the landlord and his friends.
</p>
<p>They gathered around the hotel and told Reynolds that this might
</p>
<p>be the Missouri way, but it would not do for Dixon, where the
</p>
<p>people were law-abiding and would not permit any man to be
</p>
<p>kidnapped and dragged away without knowing the charge against
</p>
<p>him and without an opportunity for judicial examination. As a
</p>
<p>large crowd had gathered by this time and as they threatened to
</p>
<p>take summary action against the brigands, Reynolds and Wilson
</p>
<p>concluded to permit a consultation with the lawyers. As soon as
</p>
<p>he could get speech with the attorneys, Joseph told them that he
</p>
<p>had been taken prisoner without process, had been insulted, bruised
</p>
<p>and threatened ; and that he wanted to sue out a writ of habeas
</p>
<p>corpus. At this Reynolds swore that he would only wait half an
</p>
<p>hour. A Mr. Dixon who had opposed Reynolds and Wilson in their
</p>
<p>outrageous doings, immediately sent messengers to the master in
</p>
<p>chancery and to Lawyer Walker to have them come to Dixon to get
</p>
<p>out a writ of habeas corpus.

</p>
<p>The next morning the writ was issued, returnable before Judge
</p>
<p>Caton of the ninth judicial circuit at Ottawa, and duly served
</p>
<p>upon Reynolds and Wilson.
</p>
<p>Writs were also obtained against them for threatening the
</p>
<p>life of Stephen Markham, for assaults upon Joseph and for false
</p>
<p>imprisonment; and these villains were soon placed in the custody
</p>
<p>of the sheriff of Lee County, whereupon their demeanor became
</p>
<p>as craven as it had before been bold and threatening.
</p>
<p>In the meantime Joseph had sent William Clayton to Nauvoo
</p>
<p>to inform Hyrum of what was being done.
</p>
<p>The Prophet still in captivity to Reynolds and Wilson, who
</p>
<p>in turn were in custody of Sheriff Campbell, proceeded that night
</p>
<p>to Pawpaw grove, thirty-two miles on the road to Ottawa. Here
</p>
<p>Reynolds and Wilson again began to abuse their captive ; but Camp-
</p>
<p>bell came to his assistance and slept by his side that night to pro-
</p>
<p>tect him from further assault.
</p>
<p>Early the next morning the hotel was filled with citizens who
</p>
<p>wanted to see the Prophet and hear him preach. Fearing the
</p>
<p>40 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>effect of an address from Joseph, Sheriff Reynolds yelled : "I want
</p>
<p>you to understand that this man is my legal prisoner, and you must
</p>
<p>disperse."
</p>
<p>This was false. No writ or other process had been served
</p>
<p>upon Joseph, and he was nobody's legal prisoner. But without
</p>
<p>waiting to discuss the legal question, an old man named David
</p>
<p>Town, who was lame and carried a large hickory walking stick,
</p>
<p>advanced upon Reynolds and said :
</p>
<p>"You damned infernal puke, we'll learn you to come here and
</p>
<p>interrupt gentlemen. Sit doivn there, [pointing to a very low chair]
</p>
<p>and sit still. Don't you open your head till General Smith gets
</p>
<p>through talking. If you never learned manners in Missouri, we'll
</p>
<p>teach you that gentlemen are not to be imposed upon by a nigger-
</p>
<p>driver. You cannot kidnap men here. There's a committee in this
</p>
<p>grove that ivill sit on your case; and, sir, it is the highest tribunal in
</p>
<p>the United States, as from its decision there is no appeal."
</p>
<p>Reynolds was made aware that Mr. Town was the head of a
</p>
<p>committee, just then assembled to deal with some land speculators
</p>
<p>who had attempted to impose upon honest settlers, and he obeyed
</p>
<p>with great meekness.
</p>
<p>The Prophet talked an hour and a half on the subject of mar-
</p>
<p>riage, which was the topic selected for him by his congregation.
</p>
<p>From that hour on his freedom commenced.
</p>
<p>Learning at Pawpaw grove that Judge Caton was absent in
</p>
<p>New York the party turned back to Dixon, arriving there about
</p>
<p>4 o'clock in the afternoon of June 25th. A return of the writ of
</p>
<p>habeas corpus was made to the master in chancery, with the en-
</p>
<p>dorsement that the judge was absent; whereupon a new writ was
</p>
<p>issued, returnable before the nearest tribunal in the fifth judicial
</p>
<p>district authorized to hear and determine writs of habeas corpus,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Campbell, the sheriff of Lee County, at once served it upon
</p>
<p>Wilson and Reynolds. Arrangements were then made to go before
</p>
<p>Judge Stephen A. Douglas at Quincy, a distance of two hundred
</p>
<p>and sixty miles; and in the meantime, anticipating treachery,

</p>
<p>Stephen Markham started with a letter to the Prophet's friends in-
</p>
<p>forming them further of his movements. This action was deemed
</p>
<p>necessary ; for the whole country seemed to be swarming with men
</p>
<p>anxious to carry Joseph into Missouri, where, according to the
</p>
<p>free boasts of Reynolds, Wilson and others his death was certain*
</p>
<p>The party in charge of the Prophet proceeded toward Quincy.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the 27th of June, shortly after crossing Fox River,
</p>
<p>they met seven of the Prophet's friends. The brethren burst into
</p>
<p>tears at sight of Joseph ; and as they embraced him he spoke to his
</p>
<p>captors who, it must be remembered, had not yet shown any writ
</p>
<p>or other process and were therefore kidnappers :
</p>
<p>"I think I will not go to Missouri this time, gentlemen. These
</p>
<p>are my boys."
</p>
<p>Then he mounted his favorite horse Joe Duncan ;* and the en-
</p>
<p>*The horse "Joe Duncan" owned by the Prophet is here identified. In
</p>
<p>a letter written by C. Bartholomew to the Compiler of this book is the follow-
</p>
<p>ing: "Brother Lundwall: Sister Huldah Thomas asked me to tell you that
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 41
</p>
<p>tire company proceeded to a farm house and made a halt. This
</p>
<p>party of the Prophet's friends was under the leadership of Thomas
</p>
<p>Grover, and from them it was learned that Elders Charles C. Rich
</p>
<p>and Wilson Law with other and larger parties were seeking the
</p>
<p>Prophet to prevent his murder and abduction.
</p>
<p>Reynolds and Wilson shook with fear. Peter W. Cownover,
</p>
<p>one of the Prophet's friends, said to Wilson: "What is the matter
</p>
<p>with you ? Have you got the ague ?"
</p>
<p>Wilson managed to stammer, "No."
</p>
<p>Reynolds asked : "Is Jem Flack in the crowd ?"
</p>
<p>Some one answered: "He is not now, but you will see him
</p>
<p>tomorrow about this time."
</p>
<p>"Then," said Reynolds, "I am a dead man; for I know him
</p>
<p>of old."
</p>
<p>Cownover told the foolish fellow not to be frightened, for no
</p>
<p>one intended to injure him.
</p>
<p>Stephen Markham had turned back when he met this party
</p>
<p>and was with them. He walked up to Reynolds and offered his
</p>
<p>hand, when the bandit cried out: "Do you meet me as a friend?
</p>
<p>I expected to be a dead man when I met you again."
</p>
<p>Markham replied: "We are friends, except in law; that must
</p>
<p>have its course."
</p>
<p>At Andover that night Reynolds and Wilson gathered a party
</p>
<p>and held a consultation. They intended to raise a company, take
</p>
<p>the Prophet by force, escape from their own arrest, and run with
</p>
<p>him to the mouth of Rock River, on the Mississippi, where they
</p>
<p>said they had a company of men all ready to drag him into Missouri
</p>
<p>and wreak vengeance upon him. But for Stephen Markham's
</p>
<p>vigilance they would have executed this plan, but he foiled them by
</p>
<p>putting the sheriff of Lee County on his guard.
</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 28th of June, they encamped in a little
</p>
<p>grove at the head of Elleston Creek. While the animals were feed-
</p>
<p>ing, Reynolds said: "No, we will go from here to the mouth of
</p>
<p>Rock River and take steamboat to Quincy."

</p>
<p>Markham replied: "No, for we are prepared to travel and
</p>
<p>will go by land."
</p>
<p>Wilson and Reynolds both yelled out : "No, by God, we won't ;
</p>
<p>we will never go by Nauvoo alive."
</p>
<p>Both drew their pistols upon Markham, who turned to Sheriff
</p>
<p>Campbell saying: "When these men took Joseph a prisoner, they
</p>
<p>took even his pocket knife. They are now prisoners of yours and
</p>
<p>I demand that their arms be seized."
</p>
<p>Reynolds and Wilson refused to yield their weapons ; but when
</p>
<p>the sheriff threatened to call for assistance, they submitted.
</p>
<p>While on this journey and resting in a little grove of timber
</p>
<p>where the ground was well sodded, one of the lawyers for Reynolds
</p>
<p>the horse she told you about which her grandfather, James Duncan, gave to
</p>
<p>the Prophet Joseph Smith, was raised by her grandfather from a colt, and
</p>
<p>her mother, Matilda A. Duncan, helped take care of it when very small.
</p>
<p>When they came west her mother asked her father (James Duncan) what
</p>
<p>had become of the horse. He said: "I gave it to the Prophet." The Prophet
</p>
<p>named it Joe Duncan, after Joseph Smith and James Duncan."
</p>
<p>42 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>and Wilson began to boast of his prowess as a wrestler. He offered
</p>
<p>to wager any sum that he could throw any man in the state of Illi-
</p>
<p>nois at side-hold. Stephen Markham, a side-hold wrestler, told the
</p>
<p>lawyer that he would not contest for money but would try a bout
</p>
<p>for fun. They grappled, and the man threw Markham, when a
</p>
<p>great shout arose from Joseph's enemies, and they began to taunt
</p>
<p>the Prophet and his friends.
</p>
<p>Joseph turned to Brother Philemon C. Merrill, a young man
</p>
<p>from Nauvoo, subsequently adjutant in the Mormon Battalion, and
</p>
<p>now a resident of St. David, Arizona, and said : "Get up and throw
</p>
<p>that man."
</p>
<p>Merrill was about to say that side-hold was not his game, but
</p>
<p>before he could speak the Prophet commanded him in such a way
</p>
<p>that his tongue was silenced. He arose to his feet filled with the
</p>
<p>strength of a Samson. Merrill lifted his arms and said to the
</p>
<p>lawyer: "Take your choice of sides."
</p>
<p>The man took the left side with his right arm under; when
</p>
<p>the company all declared that this was not fair as he had a double
</p>
<p>advantage. Merrill felt such confidence in the word of the Prophet
</p>
<p>that it made no difference to him how much advantage his op-
</p>
<p>ponent took, and he allowed the hold. As they grappled Joseph
</p>
<p>said: "Philemon, when I count three, throiv him!"
</p>
<p>On the instant after the word dropped from Joseph's lips,
</p>
<p>Merrill, with the strength of a giant, threw the lawyer over his
</p>
<p>left shoulder, and he fell striking his head upon the earth.
</p>
<p>Awe fell upon the opponents of the Prophet when they saw
</p>
<p>this, and there were no more challenges to wrestle during the
</p>
<p>journey.
</p>
<p>While they were lodged at a farm house near Monmouth one
</p>
<p>night Reynolds and Wilson again plotted to raise a mob and seize
</p>
<p>Joseph; but Peter Cownover detected them, and Sheriff Campbell
</p>
<p>put them under restraint, feeling that they were no longer to be
</p>
<p>trusted. On Thursday, the 29th of June, another party of the
</p>
<p>Prophet's friends joined him: He called James Flack to his side

</p>
<p>and told him he must not injure Reynolds whatever the provocation
</p>
<p>might have been; for the Prophet had pledged himself to protect
</p>
<p>the Missouri sheriff.
</p>
<p>The lawyers and Sheriff Campbell, with other civil officers, de-
</p>
<p>cided that the hearing upon the writ of habeas corpus might law-
</p>
<p>fully be held in Nauvoo, and they desired to go there rather than
</p>
<p>to Quincy ; so the party turned in that direction. This occasioned
</p>
<p>great joy to Joseph. His bruises were forgotten, and that night
</p>
<p>when they reached the house of Michael Crane, on Honey Creek,
</p>
<p>he sprang from the buggy, walked up to the fence, and and leaped
</p>
<p>over without touching it.
</p>
<p>A messenger had carried the news of the home-coming to
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, and on Friday, June the 30th, a joyous cavalcade went out
</p>
<p>to meet the Prophet. The meeting between Joseph and Hyrum was
</p>
<p>most touching. Joseph had just passed through one of the many
</p>
<p>perils of his life, but one of the few which Hyrum did not share;
</p>
<p>and his return caused Hyrum to weep for joy as he took the Proph-
</p>
<p>et in his arms. The spectacle of the entry into Nauvoo was most
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 43
</p>
<p>imposing, for the delighted people sang for joy and made such dem-
</p>
<p>onstration of love and gladness in Joseph's behalf, that the lawyers
</p>
<p>and officers from Dixon were charmed and deeply impressed.
</p>
<p>After they were within the city the multitude seemed unwill-
</p>
<p>ing to disperse ; but Joseph said to them :
</p>
<p>"I am out of the power of the Missourians again, thank God ;
</p>
<p>and thank you all for your kindness and love. I bless you in the
</p>
<p>name of Jesus Christ. I shall address you in the grove, near the
</p>
<p>temple at 4 o'clock this afternoon."
</p>
<p>A feast had been prepared at Joseph's house, and there he
</p>
<p>went  still in the hands of his captors, Reynolds and Wilson, who
</p>
<p>were the prisoners of Sheriff Campbell of Lee County; and all of
</p>
<p>these with about fifty of the Prophet's friends sat at his table. The
</p>
<p>place of honor was given to Reynolds and Wilson who were waited
</p>
<p>upon by Emma with as much courtesy as could have been bestowed
</p>
<p>upon a beloved guest. This kindness heaped coals of fire on their
</p>
<p>heads, for they remembered the time when they had dragged the
</p>
<p>Prophet from the side of his wife and little ones and had refused
</p>
<p>to permit him to say farewell.
</p>
<p>Under the advice of the lawyers, Joseph with his captors was
</p>
<p>brought before the municipal court of Nauvoo, and all the writs
</p>
<p>and other papers were filed there. The case was heard upon its
</p>
<p>merits, and the Prophet was discharged. The lawyers concurred
</p>
<p>that in all the transactions since the day of his arrest Joseph held
</p>
<p>himself amenable to the law and its officers ; and that the decision
</p>
<p>of the municipal court of Nauvoo was not only legal and just but
</p>
<p>was within the power of this tribunal under the city charter.
</p>
<p>But before the actual hearing began in the municipal court,
</p>
<p>Reynolds and Wilson in company with Lawyer Davis, of Carthage,
</p>
<p>started for that place threatening to raise a mob with which to
</p>
<p>drag Joseph from Nauvoo. Desiring a larger force than they could
</p>
<p>readily command at Carthage, they applied to Governor Ford for
</p>
<p>the state militia. But the governor sent a trusted messenger to
</p>
<p>Nauvoo to obtain evidence concerning the seizure of the Prophet

</p>
<p>and his discharge on the writ of habeas corpus; and this gentleman
</p>
<p>secured a copy of all the papers and evidence in the case. Prominent
</p>
<p>citizens of Lee County added their affidavits; and several gentle-
</p>
<p>men went up to Springfield to represent the matter fairly to his
</p>
<p>Excellency. Whatever Ford's motive may have been  whether a
</p>
<p>desire to make political capital for his party with influential men
</p>
<p>who took the side of the Saints in this question, or whether he had
</p>
<p>fear that he would lose his personal prestige by precipitating the
</p>
<p>unlawful strife  he took the only proper course; and after long
</p>
<p>consideration, and upon the representation of his trusted mes-
</p>
<p>senger, he refused to order out the militia, and so reported to
</p>
<p>Sheriff Reynolds and Governor Reynolds of Missouri. The posi-
</p>
<p>tion which Ford assumed was that no resistance had been made
</p>
<p>to any writ issued by the state of Illinois, and therefore that Illinois
</p>
<p>had neither right nor interest in the matter.
</p>
<p>On the 2nd and 3rd days of July parties returned who had
</p>
<p>been out from Nauvoo searching for the Prophet. One party had
</p>
<p>gone up the river on the little steamer Maid of Iowa, under com-

<p>mand of Dan Jones, and had passed through a very adventurous
</p>
<p>voyage. This company was accompanied by Apostle John Taylor.
</p>
<p>Another party, under the leadership of General Charles C. Rich,
</p>
<p>had traveled five hundred miles on horse-back in seven days. They
</p>
<p>were all delighted to find the Prophet safe at home ; and he blessed
</p>
<p>them for their love and devotion to him.

<p>Life of Joseph the Prophet, by George Q. Cannon, pp. 415-424.
</p>
<p>A PROMISE TO LIVE FIVE YEARS
</p>
<p>By Joseph the Prophet
</p>
<p>Soon after the apostasy that took place in Kirtland our enemies
</p>
<p>began again to trouble us. Having seen our prosperity in every-
</p>
<p>thing to which we had set our hands previous to this, they became
</p>
<p>discouraged, and ceased their operations ; but, suddenly discovering
</p>
<p>that there was a division in our midst, their fruitful imaginations
</p>
<p>were aroused to the utmost, to invent new schemes to accomplish
</p>
<p>our destruction.
</p>
<p>Their first movement was to sue Joseph for debt, and, with
</p>
<p>this pretense, seize upon every piece of property belonging to any
</p>
<p>of the family. Joseph then had in his possession four Egyptian
</p>
<p>mummies, with some ancient records that accompanied them.
</p>
<p>These the mob swore they would take, and then burn every one of
</p>
<p>them. Accordingly, they obtained an execution upon them for an
</p>
<p>unjust debt of fifty dollars; but, by various stratagems, we suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded in keeping them out of their hands.
</p>
<p>The persecution finally became so violent that Joseph regarded
</p>
<p>it as unsafe to remain any longer in Kirtland, and began to make
</p>
<p>arrangements to move to Missouri. One evening, before finishing
</p>
<p>his preparations for the contemplated journey, he sat in council
</p>
<p>with the brethren at our house. After giving them directions as
</p>
<p>to what he desired them to do, while he was absent from them,
</p>
<p>and, as he was about leaving the room he said: "Well, brethren,
</p>
<p>I do not recollect anything more, but one thing, brethren, is cer-
</p>
<p>tain, I shall see you again, let what will happen, for I have a
</p>
<p>promise of life five years, and they cannot kill me until that time

</p>
<p>is expired."
</p>
<p>That night he was warned by the Spirit to make his escape,
</p>
<p>with his family, as speedily as possible; he therefore arose from
</p>
<p>his bed, and took his family, with barely beds and clothing suf-
</p>
<p>ficient for them, and left Kirtland in the dead hour of the night.
</p>
<p>The day following, the constable, Luke Johnson, an apostate, served
</p>
<p>a summons upon my husband, telling him that no harm was in-
</p>
<p>tended, and desired him to go immediately to the office.

<p>JOSEPH NOT TO SEE FORTY YEARS
</p>
<p>The brethren of the Twelve took the propeller Hercules for
</p>
<p>Chicago at 10 a.m. Fare in the cabin $7. We had comfortable
</p>
<p>staterooms. We spent the day in writing and in social conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with each other concerning the death of Joseph and Hyrum
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 45
</p>
<p>and the welfare of the church and our families. A variety of sub-
</p>
<p>jects were called up, each one expressing his feelings freely. Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Brigham Young said he wished me to keep an account of things
</p>
<p>as they were passing, as he should look to me for his journal at a
</p>
<p>future day. Elder Wight said that Joseph told him, while in
</p>
<p>Liberty jail, Missouri, in 1839, he would not live to see forty years,
</p>
<p>but he was not to reveal it till he was dead.
</p>
<p>From Elder Wilford Woodruff's Journal  D. H. C. 7:212.
</p>
<p>WAS PERSECUTED FROM BOYHOOD TO END OF LIFE
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith did more for the salvation of the human family
</p>
<p>in the short time he lived than any other man that ever lived in the
</p>
<p>world, Jesus Christ excepted. He lived to be 39 years old and en-
</p>
<p>dured a continued scene of persecution and oppression from the
</p>
<p>time that the angel of the Lord appeared to him, until the time of
</p>
<p>his death. He bore testimony to the work of the Lord through life
</p>
<p>and sealed his testimony with his own blood. I have been with the
</p>
<p>Prophet Joseph and heard his instructions weekly and sometimes
</p>
<p>daily. The last time I heard him speak in public he spoke to the
</p>
<p>Legion (Nauvoo Legion). After telling what he had passed
</p>
<p>through and what he had suffered from men because he preached
</p>
<p>the Gospel of Jesus Christ, he said: From my boyhood up to the
</p>
<p>present time I have been hunted like a roe upon the mountains. I
</p>
<p>have never been allowed to live like other men. I have been driven,
</p>
<p>chased, stoned, whipped, robbed, mobbed, imprisoned, persecuted,
</p>
<p>accused falsely of everything bad. I have suffered till the Lord
</p>
<p>knows I have suffered enough." Diary of John Pulsipher.
</p>
<p>WHY LATTER-DAY SAINTS WERE PERSECUTED
</p>
<p>By Joseph the Prophet
</p>
<p>Must we, because we believe in the fullness of the gospel
</p>
<p>of Jesus Christ, the administration of angels and the communion
</p>
<p>of the Holy Ghost, like the prophets and apostles of old,  must
</p>
<p>we be mobbed with impunity, be exiled from our habitations and
</p>
<p>property without remedy, murdered without mercy, and govern-
</p>
<p>ment find the weapons and pay the vagabonds for doing the jobs,

<p>and give them the plunder into the bargain? Must we, because
</p>
<p>we believe in enjoying the constitutional privilege and right of
</p>
<p>worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own
</p>
<p>consciences, and because we believe in repentance, and baptism
</p>
<p>for the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying
</p>
<p>on of the hands, the resurrection of the dead, the millennium, the
</p>
<p>day of judgment and the Book of Mormon as the history of the
</p>
<p>aborigines of this continent,  must we be expelled from the in-
</p>
<p>stitutions of our country, the rights of citizenship, and the graves
</p>
<p>of our friends and brethren, and the government lock the gate
</p>
<p>of humanity and shut the door of redress against us? If so, fare-

<p>A CHARMED LIFE
</p>
<p>By Jane H. Martineau
</p>
<p>The recent death of Patriarch Benjamin F. Johnson in
</p>
<p>Mesa, Arizona, recalls to the writer an episode of the persecu-
</p>
<p>tions of the Latter-day Saints in Missouri in 1838, in which the
</p>
<p>deceased was a prominent actor; also, of a lady greatly beloved
</p>
<p>by all who knew her who has also passed to that better clime.
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson, then a young man of twenty years, had been
</p>
<p>taken prisoner by the ruffian horde styled an army, commanded
</p>
<p>by General Clark, and for eight days kept under guard at a camp
</p>
<p>fire in weather intensely cold with no shelter from the piercing
</p>
<p>winds by day or night; no bed except a few boughs between his
</p>
<p>body and the snow, which was more than a foot in depth ; no
</p>
<p>covering of any kind, and his only resource against freezing at
</p>
<p>night a constant replenishing of the camp fire, making sleep al-
</p>
<p>most impossible. In addition to all this, he was denied any food,
</p>
<p>and was only kept from starvation by the pity of the negro cook,
</p>
<p>who stealthily gave him scraps left from meals when he could
</p>
<p>do so unobserved.
</p>
<p>The wretch who at Haun's Mill slew an old revolutionary
</p>
<p>soldier was in the camp carrying the corn cutter with which he
</p>
<p>had murdered the old man and which was still dyed with his
</p>
<p>blood. Day after day he threatened Johnson's life with it, saying
</p>
<p>he would get more "Mormon" blood upon it when he got ready,
</p>
<p>and others of the mob frequently told him, "We'll kill you to-
</p>
<p>morrow, sure, and in a way to make you yell right smart."
</p>
<p>While sitting upon a log one day a brute came to him with
</p>
<p>rifle in hand, saying, "You give up Mormonism right now, or I'll
</p>
<p>shoot you." Receiving a decisive refusal, he exclaimed with fear-
</p>
<p>ful oaths, "I'll send you to hell right now," took deliberate aim
</p>
<p>not ten feet distant and pulled the trigger. No explosion oc-
</p>
<p>curred, and he cursed fearfully, saying he had used the gun for

</p>
<p>twenty years and it had never before misfired. He examined the
</p>
<p>lock, put in fresh priming and again essayed to shoot Johnson,
</p>
<p>but without effect, and a third time with the same result. A by-
</p>
<p>stander told him to fix up his gun a little, and then, said he, "You
</p>
<p>can kill the cuss all right. "Yes," said the would-be murderer,
</p>
<p>"I'll put in a fresh load." He did so and again tried to kill John-
</p>
<p>son. This time the gun burst and killed the wretch upon the spot,
</p>
<p>and a by-stander was heard to say, "You'd better not try to kill
</p>
<p>that man." And thus, day after day, Johnson was continually
</p>
<p>threatened with death.
</p>
<p>But help was coming, and that by the compassion of a young
</p>
<p>girl, who visited every family in the "Mormon" settlement not
</p>
<p>many miles away and persuaded men and women to meet at the
</p>
<p>log school-house and pray for his release. They did so, and that
</p>
<p>night, next day, and the following night they kept unceasing in
</p>
<p>prayer. As one ceased praying another began, and then her and
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 47
</p>
<p>another. Some went home to breakfast, dinner or supper, and
</p>
<p>returned again to pray for the release of their brother.
</p>
<p>At length this unceasing prayer was answered. About mid-
</p>
<p>night of the second night the general in command caused Johnson
</p>
<p>to be brought to his tent, and said to him : "Johnson, I have had
</p>
<p>all I could do to save your life until now, but I can't save you
</p>
<p>from death any longer. The men swear they will kill you to-
</p>
<p>morrow. Give up your Mormonism and I will adopt you as my
</p>
<p>son  I have none  I am wealthy, and you shall inherit all I have,
</p>
<p>and your life will be saved."
</p>
<p>Johnson said his religion was more to him than his life, and
</p>
<p>he would sooner die. Finding argument could not alter the young
</p>
<p>man's decision, the general said, "Well, all I can do is to turn you
</p>
<p>loose in the woods, and for you to escape if you can." He ordered
</p>
<p>a soldier to conduct Johnson to a deserted "Mormon" log house
</p>
<p>about half a mile from camp, leave him there and return, which
</p>
<p>he did, and the young man was free. But what a freedom  in
</p>
<p>snow two feet deep, no blanket, no arms to kill game or for self-
</p>
<p>defense and no food except about two quarts of parched corn.
</p>
<p>And he must make his way for miles  for days. He could not
</p>
<p>go to the "Mormon" village nearest at hand, as he would be
</p>
<p>sought for there, be retaken and murdered. And so he plodded
</p>
<p>through the woods, half starved and frozen, having to wade
</p>
<p>sloughs and brooks filled with snow or ice, and no chance to dry
</p>
<p>his frozen garments and limbs. He finally reached a house, but
</p>
<p>could not remain, as he found his foes were hunting the whole
</p>
<p>country for him. But here he obtained an old quilt, two or three
</p>
<p>"pones" of corn bread, a flint and steel to make a fire with, and
</p>
<p>with another man started on his weary journey that night to
</p>
<p>reach Fort Leavenworth, about two hundred miles distant. And
</p>
<p>this refuge, after days of fearful privation, they at last gained,
</p>
<p>being hospitably received and cared for.
</p>
<p>And who was the Angel of Mercy in human form  a young
</p>
<p>girl in her teens, who gained his release and saved his life through

<p>the prayer of the Saints? It was Sister Eliza R. Snow, his inti-

</p>
<p>In closing this sketch I will say I have read the foregoing in
</p>
<p>father Johnson's journal, and have also heard it from his own
</p>
<p>lips, and have thought it well, for the rising generation, born
</p>
<p>and living in peace and comfort, to know something of what their
</p>
<p>fathers and mothers have had to endure for the Gospel's sake.

<p>IN 1843 JOSEPH THE PROPHET HAD BEEN
</p>
<p>ARRESTED 42 TIMES
</p>
<p>I landed in the city of Nauvoo on the 9th of May, 1843, hav-
</p>
<p>ing then ended the 19-day journey by water and land which was
</p>
<p>a joyful home to me, and I longed to see the Prophet. I then had
</p>
<p>the opportunity of striking glad hands with him and my heart
</p>
<p>leaped in me for joy, for I had greater affection towards him than
</p>
<p>for any person on the earth. I viewed the Temple; then I re-
</p>
<p>48 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>membered my night vision I had when yet in the eastern counties
</p>
<p>seeing the Temple in the same form as it really was and the city
</p>
<p>the same. After having been in the city over forty days till
</p>
<p>Brother Joseph and his wife was going to visit her relatives about
</p>
<p>seventy miles up the Mississippi river, all being peace at home
</p>
<p>save for a few false brethren who sought to overthrow or destroy
</p>
<p>his happiness, who gave notice to his enemies of Missouri, for
</p>
<p>the plan was then devised to take him to Missouri and kill him.
</p>
<p>There was a man named Harmon Wilson who followed him under
</p>
<p>the pretense of an old writ to take him, but the Lord was with
</p>
<p>him that night and told him what to do so he escaped the hands
</p>
<p>of his enemies and brought them to shame and confounded them
</p>
<p>that they was in fear and great trouble of themselves. He then
</p>
<p>told us that ivas the l+2nd suit brought against him falsely and he
</p>
<p>always ivas cleared by the laws of the land.

<p>LAWSUITS TO WHICH JOSEPH SMITH WAS SUBJECTED
</p>
<p>By George A. Smith
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, the Prophet, was subjected, during his short
</p>
<p>ministerial career of fifteen years, to about fifty vexatious law-
</p>
<p>suits. The principal expense was incurred in liquidating lawyers'
</p>
<p>bills, and the brethren's time and expenditure in attending courts
</p>
<p>to defend the Prophet from mob violence. Magistrates' court ex-
</p>
<p>penses were generally one hundred dollars. The Prophet paid
</p>
<p>Generals Doniphan and Atchison for legal services at Richmond,
</p>
<p>Mo., in 1838-39, sixteen thousand dollars; but this amount was
</p>
<p>fruitlessly expended, as the benefits of the law were not accorded
</p>
<p>to him, because of the predominance and over-ruling power of a
</p>
<p>mob.
</p>
<p>At the Prophet's trial at Monmouth, 111., in 1841, before Judge
</p>
<p>Douglas, the lawyers' fees and expenses amounted to three thou-
</p>
<p>sand dollars. His next trial was before Judge Pope, U. S. District
</p>
<p>Court, in 1842-43, the expenses of which may be reasonably esti-
</p>
<p>mated at twelve thousand dollars.

<p>Cyrus Walker charged ten thousand dollars for defending
</p>
<p>Joseph in his political arrest, or the attempt at kidnapping him
</p>
<p>at Dixon, 111., in 1843. There were four other lawyers employed
</p>
<p>for the defense besides Walker. The expenses of the defense in
</p>
<p>this trial were enormous, involving the amounts incurred by the
</p>
<p>horse companies who went in pursuit to aid Joseph, and the trip
</p>
<p>of the steamer Maid of Iowa, from Nauvoo to Ottawa, and may
</p>
<p>be fairly estimated at one hundred thousand dollars.

<p>THE BATTLE OF NAUVOO AS WITNESSED
</p>
<p>BY A "JACK-MORMON"
</p>
<p>By L. C. Bidamon
</p>
<p>I am a Virginian by birth, removed to Ohio with my parents
</p>
<p>when a boy, and there married, but lost my wife by death, and
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 49
</p>
<p>subsequently removed to Canton, Ohio. When I first arrived in
</p>
<p>Nauvoo in April, 1846, I found the city menaced by a wicked mob,
</p>
<p>who, notwithstanding the majority of the Mormons had already
</p>
<p>gone into the wilderness, were relentless in their persecutions of
</p>
<p>the few who remained behind. I was soon convinced that the
</p>
<p>Mormons were a much abused people, and as I have always felt
</p>
<p>inclined to stand up for justice and right at all times and under
</p>
<p>all circumstances, it was not long before my sympathies were
</p>
<p>with the Saints. I watched the doings of the mob with a keen
</p>
<p>eye, and felt indignant when I witnessed how illegal and vexa-
</p>
<p>tious lawsuits were gotten up, based upon trumped up charges,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of dragging defendants twenty or thirty miles
</p>
<p>into out-of-the-way places in order to waylay them, and often
</p>
<p>for the purpose of whipping and murdering them. And when they,
</p>
<p>in some instances, refused to go, knowing the object was to kill
</p>
<p>them, the mobbers set up a great hue and cry that the Mormons
</p>
<p>disobeyed the law.
</p>
<p>I was finally appointed a trustee on the part of the "New
</p>
<p>citizens" to negotiate with the mobbers for peace, and was also
</p>
<p>sent to Governor Ford to lay our grievances before that official.
</p>
<p>At first he refused to listen to me and swore that he would not
</p>
<p>spend another dollar in the interest of Hancock county, having
</p>
<p>already had so much trouble with the people there. I knew, how-
</p>
<p>ever, that our cause was just, and becoming indignant at the
</p>
<p>governor's action, I threatened that if he would not do his duty
</p>
<p>in the matter, I would appeal to the President of the United
</p>
<p>States. Seeing that I was in earnest, he at last listened to what
</p>
<p>I had to say, and agreed to send Major Parker with me back to
</p>
<p>Nauvoo with a posse of twelve men, which were to serve as a
</p>
<p>guard to protect those upon whom writs might be served in the
</p>
<p>future. The mob, however, would not recognize Parker's author-
</p>
<p>ity, and swore by all the devils and saints they could think of,
</p>
<p>that they would do as they d-d pleased and did not care for the
</p>
<p>governor nor anybody else; not even Jesus Christ, if He would

</p>
<p>dare to say a good word for the Mormons.
</p>
<p>Some time afterwards I was sent to Springfield a second
</p>
<p>time to see the governor. I started down the river in a small
</p>
<p>rowboat, and the mobbers learning of my departure started in
</p>
<p>pursuit, crossed the river from Warsaw, and surrounded the
</p>
<p>house in which I had intended to stop for the night, at Church-
</p>
<p>ville (now Alexandria, Mo.) There were twelve or fifteen of them.
</p>
<p>They came in and asked me how I would like to go with them to
</p>
<p>Mr. Brockman's camp. I answered that I should not like it at all,
</p>
<p>as I was fully aware that his men were not favorably disposed
</p>
<p>toward me. "But, by G-d," said they, "you will go," and they made
</p>
<p>a move as if they wanted to take me by force. Quick as thought
</p>
<p>I had my hand on my pistol, which in the next instant I held
</p>
<p>cocked in their faces, while I hallowed out: "Stand back there,
</p>
<p>or I will blow daylight thru you." The way these mobbers made
</p>
<p>for the door and scattered in all directions was a caution. Order-
</p>
<p>ing my two men, whom I had engaged to row me down the river,
</p>
<p>to get the boat ready, I retreated with pistol in hand, got in the
</p>
<p>50 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>boat, pulled to the middle of the stream where the balls of the
</p>
<p>mobbers could not reach us, and arrived at Quincy in safety.
</p>
<p>From the latter place I continued the journey by stage to Spring-
</p>
<p>field. While stopping at Mount Sterling a few hours, I was sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by the inhabitants who were very curious to know all
</p>
<p>about the situation at Nauvoo. I made such explanations as I
</p>
<p>thought proper, and after I was through, a hard-looking indi-
</p>
<p>vidual with dark features, came up to me and said he was a cap-
</p>
<p>tain in Singleton's militia, and was going to Nauvoo the next
</p>
<p>day. All at once it came upon me that I should play the mobbers
</p>
<p>a trick, in order to avert the immediate danger which threat-
</p>
<p>ened Nauvoo, and keep the mob off until I had seen the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor. I asked the fellow if he would carry a letter for me to
</p>
<p>my brother in Nauvoo. He said he would on condition that I would
</p>
<p>let him know the contents of it. This I agreed to do. I then wrote
</p>
<p>a few lines, in which I pretended to advise the citizens of Nauvoo
</p>
<p>to refrain from shedding blood, if possible; "for," wrote I, "it
</p>
<p>would be an easy matter for you with your hell acres and hell
</p>
<p>half acres to destroy the whole mob force at once."
</p>
<p>"What do you mean by hell acres and hell half acres?" de-
</p>
<p>manded my man.
</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't like to tell you that," said I.
</p>
<p>"Then by G-d," ejaculated he, "I will not carry your letter."
</p>
<p>"Very well," said I, "provided you can keep a secret, I will
</p>
<p>explain to you." He thought he could, and I then proceeded to
</p>
<p>tell him that every approach to Nauvoo was undermined and
</p>
<p>large quantities of powder deposited in such a manner that by
</p>
<p>the pulling of certain wires, mechanically arranged, it could be
</p>
<p>exploded at will. Of course there was not a word of truth in that,
</p>
<p>but he drank it all in and went immediately to the mob camp,
</p>
<p>where the letter was read. It had the desired effect. The mob,
</p>
<p>although quite strong enough to have taken Nauvoo at once, con-
</p>
<p>cluded to wait for reinforcements, which gave me time to return
</p>
<p>from my visit to the governor, before the final attack was made.

</p>
<p>The governor returned me with orders to Major Flood, of
</p>
<p>Quincy, for him to proceed to Nauvoo and assist in adjusting the
</p>
<p>difficulties between the Mormons and the mob. That gentleman
</p>
<p>was at first unwilling to go, but finally concluded to do so, taking
</p>
<p>with him a number of other leading men of Quincy. When we
</p>
<p>arrived at Montrose, we could distinctly hear the cannonading
</p>
<p>on the prairie east of Nauvoo, and having crossed the river, I sent
</p>
<p>the Quincy delegation in my carriage out to the mob camp. These
</p>
<p>gentlemen tried their best to establish peace between the fight-
</p>
<p>ing parties, but all in vain ; all they succeeded in doing was that
</p>
<p>they induced the mob to promise to cease hostilities until the next
</p>
<p>day. As the delegation was returning to Nauvoo several shots
</p>
<p>were fired after them. I happened to pick up a spent ball, which I
</p>
<p>presented to Mr. Wood, saying that here was a compliment from
</p>
<p>the belligerents. At seeing this, Mr. Wood became so indignant
</p>
<p>that he jumped to his feet, exclaiming, "Give me a gun, and I
</p>
<p>will stand by you and see it all through. In all my intercourse
</p>
<p>with people  and I have dealt even with heathens  I have never,
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 51
</p>
<p>in all my life, seen such infamy among mankind." I advised Mr.
</p>
<p>Wood to keep at a safe distance and witness what was going on,
</p>
<p>that he might live to testify of our doings, for we all expected
</p>
<p>to fight till the last. Mr. Wood, who was a wealthy man, subse-
</p>
<p>quently showed great kindness in a substantial manner toward
</p>
<p>the afflicted Saints, by sending up large quantities of provisions,
</p>
<p>partly of his own stock, and partly such as he had influenced
</p>
<p>others to give.
</p>
<p>Previous to this I, together with a few other men, was sent
</p>
<p>to the mob camp at Green Plains with a view to bringing about
</p>
<p>a compromise. On that occasion it became my lot to deliver a
</p>
<p>speech in defense of the Mormons. Now, I am not a very religious
</p>
<p>man, and not at all superstitious; in fact, I am inclined to be
</p>
<p>rather skeptic, but I believe I was inspired on that occasion to
</p>
<p>portray the condition of the people in Nauvoo, and to plead in
</p>
<p>behalf of suffering innocence, for even the feelings of the hardened
</p>
<p>mobocrat Williams seemed to be touched as he listened to me;
</p>
<p>for I plainly saw tears coursing their way down his guilty cheeks.
</p>
<p>I told them that the remnant of the Mormons were making prep-
</p>
<p>arations to get away as fast as possible, and all they asked for
</p>
<p>was a little more time in which to dispose of their property and
</p>
<p>raise means for their journey. And furthermore that some of
</p>
<p>the heads of families were in the service of the United States,
</p>
<p>marching toward Mexico, and their families could not conveniently
</p>
<p>be moved until these soldiers had drawn their pay. I was ap-
</p>
<p>parently making a good impression upon the mobbers, when
</p>
<p>Thomas C. Sharp, the notorious editor of the Warsaw Signal, in-
</p>
<p>terrupted me and told me that the war was between the Mormons
</p>
<p>and the old citizens, and that I had no right to interfere, and
</p>
<p>further that if we, whom they designated Jack Mormons, did not
</p>
<p>stand aloof, we should share the same fate as the Mormons. When
</p>
<p>I alluded to the sufferings of the women and children, he burst
</p>
<p>out in terrible rage, saying, after uttering a fearful oath : "Drive
</p>
<p>them."

<p>the women into the river and throw their d-d young ones in after
</p>
<p>It was finally agreed that we should meet at Warsaw the
</p>
<p>following day and make another attempt at compromising. Here
</p>
<p>I was asked by Mr. Williams to sign a document to the effect that
</p>
<p>we would see all the Mormons out of Nauvoo within a reasonable
</p>
<p>time. This I emphatically refused to do, and said that I would
</p>
<p>see him in hell a thousand fathoms deep before I would put my
</p>
<p>signature to such a paper. At last I became so disgusted with
</p>
<p>him that I invited him to come out into the street for five minutes,
</p>
<p>and we would then and there settle the matter at once so far as
</p>
<p>we two were concerned. But he refused to engage in that kind
</p>
<p>of experience.
</p>
<p>When I think of the doings of these fellows, even at this late
</p>
<p>day (October 7, 1888), it makes my blood boil within; it was a
</p>
<p>shame, gentlemen, a burning shame, the way your people were
</p>
<p>treated at that time.
</p>
<p>I returned from Warsaw without effecting any compromise,
</p>
<p>and our next move was to defend ourselves the best we could.
</p>
<p>52 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>We turned the steamboat shafts into cannon, repaired our small
</p>
<p>arms, manufactured ammunition, and were determined to sell
</p>
<p>our lives as dear as possible. The famous battle of Nauvoo is a
</p>
<p>matter of history. I fought by the side of the gallant Captain
</p>
<p>Anderson, who fell as one of the noble defenders of human rights,
</p>
<p>but at last we were forced to capitulate, and so incensed were
</p>
<p>the mobbers at the active part I had taken in the defense, that
</p>
<p>they put me and two others on the death list, threatening to kill
</p>
<p>us at sight. To avert their murderous intent, I absented myself
</p>
<p>from Nauvoo for a few months, and did not return until February,
</p>
<p>1847. During my absence the robbers plundered my house, the one
</p>
<p>I had bought of President Young, carrying away and destroying
</p>
<p>everything they could get a hold of, including my stock of wagons
</p>
<p>and house furniture, which were never returned to me, save some
</p>
<p>of the carpets which I had purchased of the Temple committee.
</p>
<p>When Governor Ford, in his history of Illinois, says that he was
</p>
<p>not posted in regard to the crimes enacted by the mob at Nauvoo
</p>
<p>at that time, he tells a wicked lie, for I visited him twice myself,
</p>
<p>and told him all about it ; and I also know that he was duly informed
</p>
<p>by others.
</p>
<p>In regard to Joseph Smith, candor compels me to say that he
</p>
<p>was a noble man, yes, a noble man, indeed. I never met his equal
</p>
<p>in all my life, and I only saw him once, but that occasion I shall
</p>
<p>never forget. A certain phrenologist had invited me to accompany
</p>
<p>him to Nauvoo to pay Joseph a visit, the professor desiring to make
</p>
<p>an examination of his head. We found Joseph walking in the gar-
</p>
<p>den; he received us kindly and soon invited us into the house,
</p>
<p>where I had a two hours' conversation with him. His manners,
</p>
<p>movements and whole deportment made a deep and lasting im-
</p>
<p>pression upon me, and convinced me that he was not the impostor
</p>
<p>and wicked man he had been represented by his enemies to be ; to
</p>
<p>me he appeared to be a good, honest and noble-hearted man, and
</p>
<p>from all I have ever learned about him since, I have not had occa-
</p>
<p>sion to change my opinion about him.

<p>JOSEPH SMITH BEFORE THE COURT AT MONMOUTH, ILL.
</p>
<p>On Saturday, June 5th, 1841, the Prophet Joseph Smith, on his
</p>
<p>return from Quincy, 111., to which place he had accompanied his
</p>
<p>brother Hyrum and William Law on their mission to the East, he
</p>
<p>was arrested at the Bear Creek hotel by two officers on a warrant
</p>
<p>from Governor Carlin, of Illinois, to deliver him up to the authori-
</p>
<p>ties of Missouri. The Prophet Joseph succeeded in getting a writ
</p>
<p>of habeas corpus, and was taken to Monmouth on the Tuesday fol-
</p>
<p>lowing. At the hearing, which resulted in the Prophet's discharge,
</p>
<p>one 0. H. Browning, Esq., appeared in behalf of the defendant, and
</p>
<p>ably defended him. One of the brethren who was with the Prophet
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 53
</p>
<p>at the hearing sent the following report of the case to the Times
</p>
<p>and Seasons, which it published under date of June 15th (1841).
</p>
<p>American Hotel,
</p>
<p>Monmouth, Warren County, Illinois.
</p>
<p>June 9th, 1841. Wednesday Evening.
</p>
<p>We have just returned from the Court House, where we have listened
</p>
<p>to one of the most eloquent speeches ever uttered by mortal man, in favor
</p>
<p>of justice and liberty, by 0. H. Browning, Esq., who has done himself immortal
</p>
<p>honor in the sight of all patriotic citizens who listened to the same. He
</p>
<p>occupied the attention of the court for more than two hours, and showed the
</p>
<p>falsity of the arguments of the opposed counsel, and laid down principles in a
</p>
<p>lucid and able manner, which ought to guide the court in admitting testimony
</p>
<p>for the defendant  Joseph Smith. We have heard Mr. Browning on former
</p>
<p>occasions when he has frequently delighted his audience by his eloquence; but
</p>
<p>on this occasion he exceeded our most sanguine expectations. The sentiments
</p>
<p>he advanced were just, generous and exalted; he soared above the petty quib-
</p>
<p>bles which the opposite counsel urged, and triumphantly, in a manner and
</p>
<p>eloquence peculiar to himself, avowed himself the friend of humanity, and
</p>
<p>boldly, nobly and independently stood up for the rights of those who had
</p>
<p>waded through seas of oppression and floods of injustice and had sought a
</p>
<p>shelter in the state of Illinois. It was an effort worthy of a high-minded and
</p>
<p>honorable gentleman, such as we have ever considered him to be since we have
</p>
<p>had the pleasure of his acquaintance. Soon after we came out of Missouri he
</p>
<p>sympathized with us in our afflictions, and we were indeed rejoiced to know
</p>
<p>that he yet maintains the same principles of benevolence. His was not an
</p>
<p>effort of a lawyer anxious to earn his fee, but the pure and patriotic feeling
</p>
<p>of Christian benevolence and a sense of justice and of right.
</p>
<p>While he was answering the monstrous and ridiculous arguments urged
</p>
<p>by the opposing counsel, that Joseph Smith might go to Missouri and have
</p>
<p>his trial, he stated the circumstances of our being driven from that state, and
</p>
<p>feeling by and emphatically pointed out the impossibility of our obtaining jus-
</p>
<p>tice there. There we were forbidden to enter in consequence of the order of the
</p>
<p>Executive, and that injustice and cruelties of the most barbarous and atrocious
</p>
<p>character had been practiced upon us, until the streams of Missouri had run

<p>with blood, and that he had seen women and children barefoot and houseless,
</p>
<p>crossing the Mississippi to seek refuge from ruthless mobs. He concluded his
</p>
<p>remarks by saying that to tell us to go to Missouri for trial was adding insult
</p>
<p>to injury, and then said :
</p>
<p>"Great God! have I not seen it? Yes, my eyes have beheld the blood-
</p>
<p>stained traces of innocent women and children, in the drear winter, who
</p>
<p>have traveled hundreds of miles barefoot, through frost and snow, to seek
</p>
<p>a refuge from their savage pursuers. 'Twas a scene of horror sufficient to
</p>
<p>enlist sympathy from an adamantine heart. And shall this unfortunate
</p>
<p>man, whom their fury has seen proper to select for sacrifice, be driven into
</p>
<p>such a savage band, and none dare to enlist in the cause of justice? If there
</p>
<p>was no other voice under heaven ever to be heard in this cause, gladly would
</p>
<p>I stand alone and proudly spend my latest breath in defense of an oppressed
</p>
<p>American citizen." The Etders j ourna l, pp. 267-68.

<p>EARLY CHURCH HISTORY FOREVER UNTOLD
</p>
<p>By Benj. F. Johnson
</p>
<p>Your invitation through a late issue to the "Old veterans of
</p>
<p>the Nauvoo exodus," to give items from their experience relating
</p>
<p>to that period, almost prompts a smile. For to those whose broader
</p>
<p>experience takes in from before the settlement at Kirtland and
</p>
<p>succeeding vicissitudes of the Church, the Nauvoo experience ap-
</p>
<p>pears but modern. Who has yet written in detail the circumstances
</p>
<p>of poverty and persecution in which the Temple at Kirtland was
</p>
<p>54 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>built? that attended the gathering up of Zion's camp, with all of
</p>
<p>its experience in going and returning from Missouri? that grew
</p>
<p>out of the Kirtland bank? the great property boom and financial
</p>
<p>crisis of 1837? the apostasy at Kirtland and the persecution of the
</p>
<p>Prophet by his friends? his flight to Missouri and the struggles of
</p>
<p>the poor left behind? Who has written the history of the "poor
</p>
<p>camp"?
</p>
<p>The first large emigration company of the Saints, consisting
</p>
<p>of some seventy wagons, was organized and led by Joseph Young,
</p>
<p>E. Smith, Henry Herriman, Jonathan Dunham, Jonathan Hale and
</p>
<p>others. In great poverty it started from Kirtland on July 4, 1837,
</p>
<p>and arrived at Far West on October 20, just in time to get every
</p>
<p>experience of mob violence and exposure through the ensuing
</p>
<p>winter. While Joseph Young and others were stopping at Haun's
</p>
<p>Mill they barely escaped the massacre there. Where is published
</p>
<p>the appalling condition of the Saints at Adam-ondi-Ahman, driven
</p>
<p>in from the surrounding country and in the midst of deep snows,
</p>
<p>without shelter for the aged, the feeble or the sick, when infants
</p>
<p>were born to a manger of snow and starvation was near to all;
</p>
<p>followed by the expulsion and gathering again at the "Old Com-
</p>
<p>merce grave yard," afterwards Nauvoo? In 1839 every house was
</p>
<p>a hospital, but without nurse or attendant for the sick, for at this
</p>
<p>time there were hardly well ones enough to bury the dead. This
</p>
<p>experience with the arrival of the Prophet and others from Missouri
</p>
<p>prisons, with the building of another Temple under persecution
</p>
<p>and poverty, the martyrdom, etc., was all prior to our exodus from
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, and much of this still remains unpublished, if written.
</p>
<p>Having since 1831 been near the front in each evolution of the
</p>
<p>Church, you will pardon that "smile" ; for to me the butt end of our
</p>
<p>experience appears prior to our expulsion from Nauvoo, in which,
</p>
<p>as in the others, I was near to the front. After the martyrdom of
</p>
<p>the Prophet, having been for years associated with him in business,
</p>
<p>I was called by President Young to occupy and keep open the
</p>
<p>Nauvoo mansion, vacated by his death, and, having Sheriff Backen-

</p>
<p>stos as boarder and all outside officers and strangers to entertain,
</p>
<p>I had excellent opportunity to learn much from the outside that
</p>
<p>interested us as a people. When it was decided or agreed that as a
</p>
<p>people we should leave Nauvoo, with others I was appointed to
</p>
<p>organize a company of fifty and to take measures preparatory to
</p>
<p>emigration. To this end we started the making of wagons, occupy-
</p>
<p>ing as we had need the divisions in the basement story of a large
</p>
<p>brick barn belonging to the mansion. After the killing of Frank
</p>
<p>Worill by Sheriff Backenstos and posse, the hatred and fury of our
</p>
<p>enemies generally increased. A report became current abroad that
</p>
<p>many anti-Mormons were being murdered in Nauvoo, and the
</p>
<p>Nauvoo mansion was cited as the probable place for great crimes.
</p>
<p>To allay the excitement a troop of soldiers was by order of the
</p>
<p>governor sent to investigate and to examine the premises for
</p>
<p>bodies said to be secreted about the barn. They came and made a
</p>
<p>formal examination after which they appeared satisfied and quietly
</p>
<p>left. But the end was not yet, for the rumor continued as a number
</p>
<p>of our mechanics were seen about the basement of the barn, creating
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 55
</p>
<p>renewed suspicion. Such was the condition when President Young
</p>
<p>called for those ready to commence crossing the river, for which
</p>
<p>I was doing all possible to prepare. I am not certain of the date,
</p>
<p>but I think it was the sixth of February that private word was
</p>
<p>brought me in the evening that a squad of soldiers would be in the
</p>
<p>city before morning with an order for my arrest. There was no
</p>
<p>time to prepare. I must go at once. So with two of my family,
</p>
<p>leaving my wife and children in a skiff at midnight, in a fearful
</p>
<p>storm, we crossed the river which the day following was closed up
</p>
<p>with ice. A waiting vehicle took us to camp on Sugar Creek, where
</p>
<p>on arrival we were without shelter from the storm or supplies for
</p>
<p>our comfort. But we were at least among friends.

<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH WITH COMPANIONS IN
</p>
<p>A MISSOURI DUNGEON
</p>
<p>In one of those tedious nights we had lain as if in sleep till the
</p>
<p>hour of midnight had passed, and our ears and hearts had been
</p>
<p>pained, while we had listened for hours to the obscene jests, the
</p>
<p>horrid oaths, the dreadful blasphemies and filthy language of our
</p>
<p>guards, Colonel Price at their head, as they recounted to each
</p>
<p>other their deeds of rapine, murder, robbery, etc., which they had
</p>
<p>committed among the "Mormons" while at Far West and vicinity.
</p>
<p>They even boasted of defiling by force wives, daughters and virgins,
</p>
<p>and of shooting or dashing out the brains of men, women and
</p>
<p>children.
</p>
<p>I had listened till I became so disgusted, shocked, horrified,
</p>
<p>and so filled with the spirit of indignant justice that I could
</p>
<p>scarcely refrain from rising upon my feet and rebuking the guards ;
</p>
<p>but had said nothing to Joseph, or any one else, although I lay next
</p>
<p>to him and knew he was awake. On a sudden he arose to his feet,
</p>
<p>and spoke in a voice of thunder, or as the roaring lion, uttering, as
</p>
<p>near as I can recollect, the following words :
</p>
<p>"Silence, ye fiends of the infernal pit. In the name of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ I rebuke you, and command you to be still; I will not live

<p>another minute and hear such language. Cease such talk, or you
</p>
<p>or I die this instant !"
</p>
<p>He ceased to speak. He stood erect in terrible majesty. Chained
</p>
<p>and without a weapon ; calm, unruffled and dignified as an angel, he
</p>
<p>looked upon the quailing guards, whose weapons were lowered or
</p>
<p>dropped to the ground; whose knees smote together, and who,
</p>
<p>shrinking into a corner, or crouching at his feet, begged his pardon,
</p>
<p>and remained quiet till a change of guards.
</p>
<p>I have seen the ministers of justice, clothed in magisterial
</p>
<p>robes, and criminals arraigned before them, while life was sus-
</p>
<p>pended on a breath, in the Courts of England ; I have witnessed a

<p>Congress in solemn session to give laws to nations; I have tried
</p>
<p>to conceive of kings, of royal courts, of thrones and crowns ; and of
</p>
<p>emperors assembled to decide the fate of kingdoms ; but dignity
</p>
<p>and majesty have I seen but once, as it stood in chains, at midnight,
</p>
<p>in a dungeon in an obscure village of Missouri.

<p>56 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>CHRISTIAN MOBOCRACY AS DESCRIBED BY
</p>
<p>ONE WHO EXPERIENCED IT
</p>
<p>By Cordelia Smith Reeder Ellingford
</p>
<p>Through the violent persecutions of the Saints, Willard G.
</p>
<p>Smith's parents were obliged to sell their home and all other posses-
</p>
<p>sions, saving a meager outfit with which they started for Missouri
</p>
<p>in the spring of 1838. Willard, though a boy, was old enough to
</p>
<p>sense and fully realize these persecutions, and the dangers with
</p>
<p>which they were menaced all the way, on that terrible journey,
</p>
<p>every mile full of horror and uncertain dread. Often they were
</p>
<p>warned by complete strangers to travel other roads as mobs were
</p>
<p>congregated to kill them. They would thus be forced to travel
</p>
<p>unbeaten trails at night with the stars as guides. They were
</p>
<p>obliged to camp occasionally and get a few days work to replenish
</p>
<p>their scant provisions.
</p>
<p>They left Ohio in April and reached Missouri in October. On
</p>
<p>the 23rd of October they were stopped by an armed mob. All lire-
</p>
<p>arms and ammunition were taken from them; they were taken
</p>
<p>back five miles, placed under guard, and detained for three days
</p>
<p>with no consideration and little to eat, constantly threatened with
</p>
<p>complete annihilation.
</p>
<p>On the morning of October 30th they arrived at a little place
</p>
<p>called Haun's Mill, a small settlement on Shoal Creek, composed of
</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints. They received a cordial, hearty welcome. Father
</p>
<p>said the people had bees and had just taken out their honey, which
</p>
<p>was in pans and buckets. They were told, "Help yourselves; eat
</p>
<p>all you want."
</p>
<p>They passed a few hours in this friendly atmosphere before
</p>
<p>they noticed a sort of suppressed anxiety among the people. The
</p>
<p>men all gathered in groups and seemed to be discussing some vital
</p>
<p>problem. Grandfather with his three little boys, Willard, Alma
</p>
<p>and Sardis, were standing at a brush fire heating a wagon tire to
</p>
<p>re-set. Grandmother was busy with the usual work of a Pioneer
</p>
<p>mother and traveler. I will try to give you the story of the subse-

</p>
<p>quent events in fathers' own graphic words :
</p>
<p>"Myself and two little brothers were with father when, with-
</p>
<p>out warning a large body of mounted men, blackened and painted
</p>
<p>like Indians, rode up yelling, and commenced shooting at the crowd.
</p>
<p>The men at the shop called for quarter; to this the mob paid no
</p>
<p>attention. The men then called for the women and children to run
</p>
<p>for their lives.
</p>
<p>"We were surrounded on three sides by the mob; the old mill
</p>
<p>and mill pond were on the other. The men ran for the shop, taking
</p>
<p>the little boys with them. My two little brothers ran in with father.
</p>
<p>I followed but when I started to enter the shop my arms flew up
</p>
<p>and braced themselves against each side of the door, preventing
</p>
<p>my entrance. In my frenzy of fear I again tried to enter the shop,
</p>
<p>and again my arms were braced to prevent going in. After the
</p>
<p>third futile attempt, I ran around the corner of the shop and
</p>
<p>crawled into a pile of lumber, hiding as best I could. I had been
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 57
</p>
<p>there but a few seconds when the mob began shooting at me and
</p>
<p>splinters flew all about me. I crawled out and ran into an empty
</p>
<p>house on the slope near the pond. I had only been there a few
</p>
<p>minutes when I heard a suppressed groan. I listened again and
</p>
<p>then I saw a board over a potato cellar move very slightly. I raised
</p>
<p>the boards and there saw an old Revolutionary soldier by the name
</p>
<p>of Thomas McBride, who had been wounded before the women had
</p>
<p>fled and they had hidden him in this pit. Father McBride asked to
</p>
<p>be helped out and begged for water. I went with a cup to the pond,
</p>
<p>or mill race, for the water. As I stooped to fill the cup I was
</p>
<p>deliberately fired upon, the bullets spattering like hail in the water.
</p>
<p>I escaped without a scratch. I gave the suffering patriot a drink
</p>
<p>and pleaded with him to remain in the pit, telling him the mob
</p>
<p>would kill him if they found him. He replied, 'Help me out; I am
</p>
<p>dying in here/ This I did. The mob found him and as he raised
</p>
<p>his aged hands in supplication, they were cut and hacked, the
</p>
<p>fingers split down with an old dull corn cutter. By the time the
</p>
<p>old gentleman was made as comfortable as possible, the bullets
</p>
<p>were flying thick around us. I decided I must seek safety else-
</p>
<p>where. I ran out of this house into another one close by. Here I
</p>
<p>heard sobs and whispered comfortings which seemed to come from
</p>
<p>the corner where the bedstead stood. I went and lifted up the bed
</p>
<p>valence and crouched way back were six little girls. The mob saw
</p>
<p>me go in there and soon the splinters and bullets were flying around
</p>
<p>us. I said, 'Come, we must get out of here or we will all be killed.'
</p>
<p>So we left and ran toward the mill dam, finally reaching the mill
</p>
<p>race which we crossed on a board. The mob fired at us as we went
</p>
<p>up the creek bank on the other side. The bullets spattered again in
</p>
<p>the water and cut down the brush on all sides of us; but not one
</p>
<p>of us was grazed by a bullet, although several passed through the
</p>
<p>clothing of the children.
</p>
<p>"Two of these little girls I afterwards knew. They were the
</p>
<p>daughters of Brother Champlain, the man who was knocked down
</p>
<p>in the shop, and was thought to be dead, thus hearing all the con-

</p>
<p>troversies of the mob when they entered the shop to finish their
</p>
<p>fiendish work.
</p>
<p>"After our race for life, the little girls scurried off like prairie
</p>
<p>chickens into the brush and tall corn. I, knowing father and my
</p>
<p>little brothers were in the shop and the mob were still firing at
</p>
<p>them, took shelter behind a large tree, where I could be pretty safe
</p>
<p>and still watch the mob. This I did until they ceased firing, when
</p>
<p>they dismounted and went into the shop where they finished their
</p>
<p>fiendish work by killing all who were not dead. From here they
</p>
<p>went into all the cabins and tents and destroyed all their groceries
</p>
<p>and furnishings. After taking the horses and belongings of their
</p>
<p>victims, they rode off, howling like Indians.
</p>
<p>"As soon as I was sure they had gone, I started for the shop.
</p>
<p>I was the first person to enter this holocaust (wholesale destruction
</p>
<p>by fire and sword), stepping over the dead body of my father in
</p>
<p>doing so. I looked around and found my brother, Sardis, dead,
</p>
<p>with the top of his head shot away; and my little brother, Alma,
</p>
<p>almost lifeless, lying among a pile of dead where he had been
</p>
<p>58 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>thrown by the mob, who evidently thought him dead. I picked
</p>
<p>Alma up from the dirt and was carrying him from the shop when
</p>
<p>I met my mother, who screamed and said, 'Oh ! They have killed my
</p>
<p>little Alma !' I said, 'Alma is alive but they have killed father and
</p>
<p>Sardis.' I begged mother not to go in but to help me with Alma.
</p>
<p>Our tent had been devastated by the mob, even the straw tick cut
</p>
<p>open and straw scattered about, taking the tick with them. Mother
</p>
<p>leveled the straw, laid some clothes over it and on this awful bed
</p>
<p>we placed Alma, and cut his pants off. We could then see the ex-
</p>
<p>tent of his injury. The entire ball and socket joint of the left hip
</p>
<p>was entirely shot away, leaving the bones three or four inches
</p>
<p>apart. It was a sickening sight, one I shall never forget. Mother
</p>
<p>was full of divine, trusting faith, a most marvelous, wonderful
</p>
<p>woman. As soon as Alma could talk, mother asked him if he knew
</p>
<p>who made him. He said, 'Yes, mother, God did/ She then told
</p>
<p>him that the wicked mob had shot his hip away and asked, 'Do
</p>
<p>you think God can make a new one?' Alma replied, 'Yes, I know He
</p>
<p>can/ Mother then said, 'All right, let's pray to the Lord and ask
</p>
<p>Him to do so.' So we all gathered around him on his bed of straw
</p>
<p>and mother prayed, dedicating him to the Lord, asking God to
</p>
<p>spare his life if He could make him strong and well but to take him
</p>
<p>to Himself if this were impossible. In her terrible excitement and
</p>
<p>sorrow, her only help seemed her Heavenly Father. So she prayed
</p>
<p>for guidance, pleading for help in this dire extremity. By inspira-
</p>
<p>tion her prayers were answered and she knew what to do. She
</p>
<p>placed little Alma in a comfortable position on his stomach, telling
</p>
<p>him, 'The Lord has made it known to me that He will make you
</p>
<p>well, but you must lie on your stomach for a few weeks/
</p>
<p>"Mother was inspired to take the white ashes from the camp-
</p>
<p>fire, place them in water to make a weak lye, with which she washed
</p>
<p>the wound; all the crushed bone, mangled flesh and blood were
</p>
<p>thus washed away, leaving the wound clean and almost white like
</p>
<p>chicken breast. Then she was prompted how to make a poultice
</p>
<p>for the wound. Mother asked me if I knew where I could get some

</p>
<p>Slippery Elm tree roots. I said I knew where there was such a tree.
</p>
<p>She gave me a lighted torch of shag bark hickory with which to
</p>
<p>find my way."
</p>
<p>I remember asking my father, "Weren't you afraid when you
</p>
<p>went off alone in the dark?" "Of course I was but mother told me
</p>
<p>the Lord would protect me and I believed her. I took the torch and
</p>
<p>ax and soon got the roots from which mother made a poultice,
</p>
<p>with which she filled the wound. As often as the poultice turned
</p>
<p>dark it was removed and the wound washed and refilled."
</p>
<p>"This is not intended as a history of those terrible days. I will
</p>
<p>just say the Lord fulfilled His promise to the faithful in this case.
</p>
<p>The prayers of implicit, trusting faith were answered. A new hip
</p>
<p>gradually replaced the one that was shot away. Alma was fully
</p>
<p>restored to health, walked without a limp, and was a dancing master
</p>
<p>in his young days. He devoted years of his life to missionary work,
</p>
<p>was a man of faith, full of integrity, beloved by all who knew him."
</p>
<p>When a girl of 18 years, I visited with my father at the home
</p>
<p>of my grandmother. On our last evening with her, she gathered
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 59
</p>
<p>her children and grandchildren about her and again related inci-
</p>
<p>dents connected with her wonderful life. Once more we heard the
</p>
<p>story of their combined sufferings at Haun's Mill, and of the Divine
</p>
<p>help and support received during their awful experience. As a
</p>
<p>fitting climax, grandmother said, "Alma, for the benefit of these
</p>
<p>children, that it may be a living, burning testimony of God's power,
</p>
<p>will you let them see your hip?" I shall never forget the electrical
</p>
<p>thrill of conviction that ran like fire through my entire system as
</p>
<p>I gazed upon the handiwork of God. A broad, thick, strong ligament
</p>
<p>or muscle had united the trunk of the body with the limb, consti-
</p>
<p>tuting a joint or the necessary equivalent for perfect free use of
</p>
<p>the body.
</p>
<p>The day after the massacre at Haun's Mill, father helped his
</p>
<p>mother and others bury the dead from the shop. An old dry well
</p>
<p>was found and into this the dead were lowered, covered with straw,
</p>
<p>filled with diru and debris, and covered with rock and brush. Their
</p>
<p>harassments were pitiful; their suffering beyond description. My
</p>
<p>father was the only help during these terrible weeks, every day
</p>
<p>finding renewed persecution. After Alma improved so they could
</p>
<p>think of trying to leave the state, great difficulties presented them-
</p>
<p>selves. They were alone, their team, wagon, and all equipment
</p>
<p>stolen. Grandmother visited Captain Cumstock, leader of the mob,
</p>
<p>and here she found one horse but Captain Cumstock told her she
</p>
<p>could have it by paying five dollars for its keep. She walked out,
</p>
<p>took off her apron, tied it around her horse and led him off with
</p>
<p>the men looking at her. They never objected. She gathered a
</p>
<p>meager outfit and was soon on the way to Quincy, Illinois. They
</p>
<p>were ill prepared for this trip. Grandmother, in her journal, said,
</p>
<p>"I started the 1st of February for the state of Illinois, without
</p>
<p>friends or money. Mobbed all the way. I drove my own team and
</p>
<p>slept out of doors. I had four small children. We suffered much
</p>
<p>with hunger, cold and fatigue. For what? For our religion. Where,
</p>
<p>in a boasted land of liberty, 'Deny your faith or die' was the cry."
</p>
<p>Grandmother, with her little family, finally reached Quincy,

</p>
<p>Illinois, where they suffered all the trials, persecutions, and wander-
</p>
<p>ings of the Saints. Here grandmother married again, a man having
</p>
<p>the same name, Warren Smith, and also following the same business
</p>
<p>as my grandfather. From here they went with the Latter-day Saints
</p>
<p>to Nauvoo, where father seemed to enjoy life. He joined the
</p>
<p>martial band, played the kettledrum in Nauvoo Legion, and entered
</p>
<p>fully into the activities of the growing community. His associations
</p>
<p>were always dear to him. If ever a man loved another, my father
</p>
<p>loved the Prophet Joseph Smith. He loved to talk of him, would
</p>
<p>relate little incidents of kindness and consideration shown him by
</p>
<p>the Prophet, which meant so much to a boy.
</p>
<p>Father's school was situated near the Nauvoo Mansion and
</p>
<p>was taught by one of the Prophet's sisters. Here he used to play
</p>
<p>with young Joseph, Jr., and his brother, David. His home was
</p>
<p>quite a distance from school and father used to bring his lunch.
</p>
<p>One time the Prophet, passing at noon and seeing father eating,
</p>
<p>stopped and said : "Willard, I don't want you to bring your lunch
</p>
<p>from home any more. You come to my home every day and eat
</p>
<p>60 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>with my boys." Father told of occasions when the Prophet would
</p>
<p>place his arms affectionately about him and drawing him close
</p>
<p>would give him loving advice and counsel. Father told our family
</p>
<p>of the Prophet's love for boys, his interest in their sports and
</p>
<p>activities, how he would take off his coat and join the boys in a
</p>
<p>game of ball, or other sports  all of which made him become
</p>
<p>almost revered by the boys. Father worked on the Nauvoo Temple
</p>
<p>as stone cutter and glazier, assisted in making the oxen on which
</p>
<p>rested the baptismal font, and when it was completed was one of
</p>
<p>the first to receive his blessings therein. Of the awful martyrdom
</p>
<p>of the Prophet and his brother, Hyrum, father couldn't talk with-
</p>
<p>out tears filling his eyes and choking his speech. Father was em-
</p>
<p>ployed at the livery stable where the team of horses was stabled
</p>
<p>which carried visitors to and from Carthage jail. The regular
</p>
<p>driver being ill, father was asked to drive the very group to the
</p>
<p>jail which killed the Prophet and his brother, Hyrum. He heard
</p>
<p>their vile blasphemous boastings of their intended deed and was
</p>
<p>utterly helpless. After the murder, father marched with muffled
</p>
<p>drum at the head of those who brought their bodies back to Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>His grief at having to leave beautiful Nauvoo and all earthly
</p>
<p>possessions was keen, since love of home and family was strong
</p>
<p>with him. He left Nauvoo, driving a team for Beeson Lewis, later
</p>
<p>transferred to President Young's Company of Advance Pioneers.
</p>
<p>He was in this company when the call came for five hundred men
</p>
<p>to form a company of infantry for the Mexican War. After a de-
</p>
<p>cision had been reached by those directly concerned, President
</p>
<p>Young stepped upon a wagon tongue, calling out: "Is there a
</p>
<p>drummer boy present?" My father stepped forward, saying, "Yes,
</p>
<p>sir, I am one." President Young replied, "All right, Willard, you
</p>
<p>drum for recruits." Which father did, thus becoming virtually the
</p>
<p>first volunteer in this memorable body of valiant men, who made
</p>
<p>one of the most hazardous, heroic marches recorded in modern
</p>
<p>history.

<p>recorded and described in a general way by different historians,
</p>
<p>but no one can describe their acute sufferings on this uncharted,
</p>
<p>perilous march over hot, burning sand, under scorching sun, with
</p>
<p>short rations and little water. Father told of one particular in-
</p>
<p>stance, after a two days' march, with very little water to start with,
</p>
<p>the last twenty-four hours entirely without. With their tongues
</p>
<p>swollen out of their mouths, they were forced to march along or be
</p>
<p>left by the wayside. With many loitering on the way, unable to
</p>
<p>keep up, the Battalion came to a "buffalo wallow," a deep depression
</p>
<p>or sort of springy place where water had drained and here the
</p>
<p>buffalo had wallowed and their deep tracks were full of dirty,
</p>
<p>stagnant water, full of animal life and all kinds of filth, but it was
</p>
<p>wet, and hailed by the boys with delight. They spread their soiled
</p>
<p>handkerchiefs over these depressions and sucked the moisture
</p>
<p>through them. Father said the condition of their tongues was such
</p>
<p>that the sense of taste was gone. He also said he considered it
</p>
<p>providential that relief came to them in small quantities for had
</p>
<p>they come to a running stream or spring, they would have injured,
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 61
</p>
<p>if not killed themselves by drinking too much. They suffered for
</p>
<p>food on long forced marches. One day father and his companion
</p>
<p>saw a dead bird under a desert bush. After they camped at night,
</p>
<p>they quietly left camp, retraced their route, found the bird, which
</p>
<p>proved to be a crow. In their starving condition this, though not
</p>
<p>considered a choice morsel, was cooked and thoroughly enjoyed.
</p>
<p>The Battalion finally reached San Diego, where they had an
</p>
<p>opportunity to rest, with plenty of food. From here they made a
</p>
<p>forced march to Santa Ana, where they fully expected to have an
</p>
<p>engagement with the enemy. Again, those seeking promotion and
</p>
<p>notoriety were disappointed. When the Battalion arrived, the
</p>
<p>enemy had all fled to the mountains. From here they went to
</p>
<p>Los Angeles. While the Company were standing at ease in the
</p>
<p>street, there came a ragged, dejected man, in clothes much too
</p>
<p>small for him. He was dirty, a regular derelict vagabond. He
</p>
<p>accosted Captain Hancock, saying, "Gentlemen, I am glad to see
</p>
<p>you. I have been waiting here days for you, for I heard there
</p>
<p>was a company of Mormons coming.' , "Well," said Brother Hancock,
</p>
<p>"what can we do for you?" The man replied, "I hoped there would
</p>
<p>be some one in the company who had friends killed in the Haun's
</p>
<p>Mill massacre, who would kill me, because I was there. I was the
</p>
<p>man who shot that little boy's brains out in the blacksmith shop.
</p>
<p>His cries and pitiful pleadings have never been from before my
</p>
<p>eyes and I want to die." Brother Hancock took him to father, where
</p>
<p>he repeated his story. He said, "I shot that boy with a double-
</p>
<p>barreled shotgun. His pleadings still ring in my ears. I hope you
</p>
<p>will grant my request." He wore an old army shirt, buttoned over
</p>
<p>shoulder and down the right side. Tearing this open, he threw
</p>
<p>himself down on his knees, saying, "I want to die; I want you to
</p>
<p>kill me." My father stepped back from him, saying, "There is a
</p>
<p>just God in heaven who will avenge that crime. I will not stain
</p>
<p>my hands with your blood." This man loitered around camp for
</p>
<p>days until the officers had time taken away.*

<p>informative: "On Saturday afternoon in company with Elder Winegar we
</p>
<p>boarded the Burlington train for the town of Breckenridge, 85 miles east of
</p>
<p>Kansas City, and arrived at this old town about 8 p.m. Their county fair
</p>
<p>had been running for three days and would close this evening. About the
</p>
<p>center of the small park in which the fair was located was -a mill stone, said
</p>
<p>to have been taken from Mr. Haun's mill. This mill was owned and in run-
</p>
<p>ning order on Shoal Creek at the time of the massacre of the Saints on Sep-
</p>
<p>tember 6, 1838, where eighteen of the brethren were shot down and killed
</p>
<p>and three others escaped who had been dangerously wounded. About 6 o'clock
</p>
<p>in the evening, on the date above registered, 200 armed men on horseback
</p>
<p>made their appearance and at once opened fire, without warning, upon the
</p>
<p>little company of Mormon families encamped near Mr. Haun's mill and on
</p>
<p>his premises. This band of miscreants shot down every man that they could
</p>
<p>see moving in the vicinity of the camp of Latter-day Saints. The brethren
</p>
<p>ran in every direction to keep from being murdered, and some twelve or
</p>
<p>thirteen of them, with two little boys, took shelter in the blacksmith shop,
</p>
<p>a small log building which Warren Smith, one of the brethren, had rented
</p>
<p>of Mr. Haun and in which he had engaged in shoeing the horses and fixing
</p>
<p>the wagons of the immigrating saints. When these twelve brethren and two
</p>
<p>little boys took shelter in the blacksmith shop, the mob coolly and deliber-
</p>
<p>ately surrounded the same and, placing the muzzles of their guns through
</p>
<p>the openings between the logs, shot every one of the occupants and then

</p>
<p>TYPICAL MISSOURI JUSTICE
</p>
<p>(A short account of an affray that took place between the Latter-day
</p>
<p>Saints and a portion of the people of Daviess County, Mo., at an election
</p>
<p>held in Gallatin Aug. 6, 1838.)
</p>
<p>By John L. Butler
</p>
<p>Polls opened with the usual ceremonies. There were present
</p>
<p>about forty or fifty Missourians and eight or ten of the saints (viz.)
</p>
<p>Hyrum Nelson and Brother Riley Stewart, Jackson Stewart, Moses
</p>
<p>Daly, Washington Voris, Father Harvey Olmstead, Samuel Brown
</p>
<p>and Perry Durphy. There was a rush to the polls on the part of the
</p>
<p>Missourians until they were principally through with the voting
</p>
<p>when William Peniston, one of the candidates stood upon the head
</p>
<p>of a whiskey barrel and made a very inflammatory speech against
</p>
<p>the saints, stating that he had headed a company to order the
</p>
<p>Mormons off their farms and possessions, stating at the same
</p>
<p>time that he did not consider the Mormons had any more right to
</p>
<p>vote than the niggers. When he was through he called on all hands
</p>
<p>to drink, which they did, for whiskey passed free and they drank
</p>
<p>as freely. I, at the time retired a little back from the crowd
</p>
<p>rather behind the little grocery near by where they were voting.
</p>
<p>I heard the word G  damn 'em ; kill 'em G  Damn 'em. From the
</p>
<p>noise and bustle I knew there was fighting. I felt at first not to go
</p>
<p>in amongst them, for I did not want to have any trouble, but wished
</p>
<p>to vote and thought after voting I would start home immediately.
</p>
<p>I did not like the spirit manifested. It then came to my mind that
</p>
<p>they might be fighting the brethren. As I went over I saw they had
</p>
<p>attacked the brethren with sticks, clapboards (or shakes) and
</p>
<p>anything they could use to fight with. They were all in a muss
</p>
<p>together, everyone of the Missourians trying to get a lick at a
</p>
<p>Mormon. It made me feel indignant to see from four to a dozen
</p>
<p>mobbers on a man and all damning 'em and G  damning the
</p>
<p>"Mormons." I saw they were all well armed with clubs or some
</p>
<p>other weapon to fight with. I turned around and ran a few steps
</p>
<p>to get a stick. I soon found one suitable though rather large. It

</p>
<p>entered the shop and proceeded to examine the bodies by punching them with
</p>
<p>their guns to see if life remained in any of them.
</p>
<p>The two little boys, after their father fell near the bellows of the shop,
</p>
<p>crawled over behind his body to hide from the butchers. The mob also poked
</p>
<p>these two little fellows with their guns and when they cried out, they pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to finish them as they thought. The one, the younger of the two,
</p>
<p>Sardis Smith, was heard to say: "Please, mister, don't shoot me, I am only
</p>
<p>a little boy." But the villain replied, "Nits make lice," and placing his gun
</p>
<p>against the little boy's ear fired and blew the top of his head off. His older
</p>
<p>brother, Alma Smith, thirteen years of age, also received a very dangerous
</p>
<p>wound in the region of the right hip, from which he almost bled to death
</p>
<p>before he was rescued by his angel mother, whose husband had been murdered
</p>
<p>and also her little son, Sardis  this fearful and horrible assassination per-
</p>
<p>petrated on an innocent and defenseless band of immigrants because they
</p>
<p>claimed to be Latter-day Saints.
</p>
<p>Over the mill stone at the fairgrounds in Breckenridge was a placard
</p>
<p>reading as follows: "This stone was taken from the battleground where
</p>
<p>eighteen Mormons were killed and buried in a well near Haun's Mill on Shoal
</p>
<p>Creek, September 6, 1838."
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 63
</p>
<p>was a piece of the heart of an oak which I thought I could handle
</p>
<p>with ease and convenience. Returning to the crowd many thoughts
</p>
<p>ran through my mind. First, I remembered that I never in my
</p>
<p>life struck a man in anger. I had always lived in peace with all
</p>
<p>men. The stick I had to fight with was so large and heavy that I
</p>
<p>could sink it into every man's head that I might chance to strike.
</p>
<p>I did not want to kill anyone, but merely to protect my brethren.
</p>
<p>I went in with the determination to rescue my brethren from such
</p>
<p>miserable curs at all hazards. Thinking when hefting my stick
</p>
<p>that I must temper my lick just so as not to kill. Furthermore, a
</p>
<p>power rested upon me such as I never felt before. When I got in
</p>
<p>reach of them I commenced to call out loud for peace and at the
</p>
<p>same time making my stick move to my own utter astonishment
</p>
<p>tapping them as I thought lightly, but they fell as dead men, their
</p>
<p>heads often striking the ground first. I took great care to strike
</p>
<p>none except those who were fighting the brethren. When I first
</p>
<p>commenced there were some six or eight men on old Mr. Durphy
</p>
<p>and a few steps further ten or a dozen men on Brother Olmstead
</p>
<p>and Brother Nelson. But they were so thick around them that they
</p>
<p>could not do execution to advantage. I continued to knock down
</p>
<p>every man I could reach that was lifting a stick against the
</p>
<p>brethren. After getting through and seeing the brethren on their
</p>
<p>feet I looked and saw some of the men lying on the ground as
</p>
<p>though they were dead. Some of them were being held up by their
</p>
<p>friends; some were standing leaning against the little grocery.
</p>
<p>While gazing on the scene Brother Riley Stewart had in his hand
</p>
<p>(what the backwoodsman calls a knee) to place between weight
</p>
<p>poles on log cabins  a piece of timber about two and a half feet
</p>
<p>long, small at one end, and struck Dick Welding an overhand blow
</p>
<p>on the head cutting the side of his head three or four inches in
</p>
<p>length. It looked like he was certainly killed. I told Stewart he
</p>
<p>had better leave for he had killed that man. He started to run and
</p>
<p>got off about twenty or twenty-five paces when about ten or a
</p>
<p>dozen men took after him throwing sticks and stones at him and
</p>

</p>
<p>anything they could get, swearing they would kill him. I saw they
</p>
<p>would overpower him and I called for him to come back for we
</p>
<p>could do better business when together. He took a circuitous route
</p>
<p>to keep from meeting those pursuing him. At the crisis one of the
</p>
<p>mob drew a glittering dirk with blade about six inches long, waving
</p>
<p>it in the air and at the same time swearing it should drink Stewart's
</p>
<p>heart's blood. He started to meet Stewart as he was returning
</p>
<p>back to the crowd. As he was several steps ahead of me I sprang
</p>
<p>with all the power that was in me to overtake him before he met
</p>
<p>Stewart. Just as he and Stewart met he made a blow at his neck
</p>
<p>or breast, but as Stewart was passing in a run the dirk passed over
</p>
<p>his left shoulder close by his neck and struck in his right shoulder
</p>
<p>blade which bent the point of it around as much as an inch. Just
</p>
<p>as he made his lick I reached forward as far as I could and hit him
</p>
<p>on the side of the head and fetched him helpless to the ground. At
</p>
<p>the same instant I received a blow from one behind me with the
</p>
<p>butt end of a loaded horsewhip which took me right between the
</p>
<p>shoulders. I felt the jar only in my breast and had I not been
</p>
<p>64 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>stooping forward as I was at the time I made my blow, he would
</p>
<p>have taken me on the head no doubt and perhaps fetched me down.
</p>
<p>While Stewart was running off, James Welding, Dick's brother
</p>
<p>came along and saw his brother lying in his gore. He bawled and
</p>
<p>swore that they had killed Dick. He picked up a stone swearing he
</p>
<p>would kill every Mormon in Daviess County before Saturday night.
</p>
<p>Just as the word came out of his mouth, Washington Voris, stand-
</p>
<p>ing near him, hit him square in the mouth with a stone that would
</p>
<p>weigh about two pounds I think and straightened him out on the
</p>
<p>ground. As he arose with his mouth badly cut and bleeding he put
</p>
<p>his hand on his face and began to cry saying that he never saw
</p>
<p>people hit as hard as the Mormons. They had killed Dick and
</p>
<p>mashed his mouth, and off he ran bellowing in the brush.
</p>
<p>I will mention another occurrance which took place. Brother
</p>
<p>Olmstead previous to the affray had purchased half a dozen earthen
</p>
<p>bowls and as many teacups and saucers which he had tied up in
</p>
<p>a new cotton handkerchief and swung to his wrist. One of the
</p>
<p>mob struck at him when he raised his arm and the blow struck
</p>
<p>the dishes and broke them. He then commenced using them over
</p>
<p>their heads and when the fight was over I saw him empty out his
</p>
<p>broken earthenware on the ground in pieces not larger than a
</p>
<p>dollar. His handkerchief looked like it had been chewed by a cow.
</p>
<p>I have thought ever since that time that they had fun picking the
</p>
<p>pieces of earthenware from their heads, for they certainly were
</p>
<p>pretty well filled.
</p>
<p>The whole scene was soon over. I think it lasted about two
</p>
<p>or three minutes from the first to the last blow. I have seen as
</p>
<p>many as two hundred men at an election in old Kentucky fighting
</p>
<p>each other for six or eight minutes with clubs, knives, brick bats,
</p>
<p>etc., with about one tenth the execution. I believe there were as
</p>
<p>many as thirty men with bloody heads and some of them badly
</p>
<p>hurt. I knocked down about six or eight men myself. I never
</p>
<p>struck a man the second time and while knocking them down I
</p>
<p>really felt that they would sometime embrace the gospel.

</p>
<p>I felt the spirit as above stated to rest upon me with power.
</p>
<p>I felt like I was seven or eight feet high and my arms three or
</p>
<p>four feet long, for certainly I ran faster than I ever did before
</p>
<p>and could reach farther and hit a man and they could not reach me
</p>
<p>to harm me. Col. Peniston who was the author of the scrape ran
</p>
<p>up to the grocery on the hill. I looked out for him to get a clip at
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>After the fight was over we gathered our men on some hewn
</p>
<p>house logs and told the mob that we would fight them as long as
</p>
<p>blood ran warm in our veins if they still persisted. But they begged
</p>
<p>for peace after they saw their men lying around. They came to
</p>
<p>me and wanted me to go and vote. I told them I would if they
</p>
<p>would clear the road to the polls which they did immediately. But
</p>
<p>I could see that if I went in the poll box they would be all around
</p>
<p>me and thus take me prisoner for some of their men who would
</p>
<p>die. I told them I was a law-abiding man and that I did not intend
</p>
<p>to be tried by a mob. I then mounted a good horse and left.
</p>
<p>Before the fighting began John L. Butler called the brethren
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 65
</p>
<p>together and made a speech, saying: "We are American citizens;
</p>
<p>our fathers fought for their liberty in the American Revolution
</p>
<p>and we will maintain the same principles."
</p>
<p>MASONS ALSO PERSECUTED
</p>
<p>Elder Heber C. Kimball, who had been a Mason since 1823,
</p>
<p>has said of the martyrdom :
</p>
<p>Joseph and Hyrum Smith were Master Masons, yet they were
</p>
<p>massacred through the instrumentality of some of the leading men
</p>
<p>of that fraternity, and not one soul of them has ever stepped forth
</p>
<p>to administer help to me or my brethren belonging to the Masonic
</p>
<p>Institution, or to render us assistance, although bound under the
</p>
<p>strongest obligations to be true and faithful to each other in every
</p>
<p>case and under every circumstance, the commission of crime ex-
</p>
<p>cepted.
</p>
<p>Yes, Masons, it is said, were even among the mob that mur-
</p>
<p>dered Joseph and Hyrum in Carthage Jail. Joseph, leaping the
</p>
<p>fatal window, gave the masonic signal of distress. The answer
</p>
<p>was the roar of his murderers' muskets and the deadly balls that
</p>
<p>pierced his heart.
</p>
<p>In 1878, Zina D. Huntington Young said of this theme, "I am
</p>
<p>the daughter of a Master Mason; I am the widow of the Master
</p>
<p>Mason who, when leaping from the window of Carthage jail,
</p>
<p>pierced with bullets, made the Masonic sign of distress, but those
</p>
<p>signs were not heeded except by the God of Heaven."
</p>
<p>"They gave us a city charter," said Heber C. Kimball, "and
</p>
<p>then took it from us again, and that too without any just cause.
</p>
<p>They gave us a charter for a Masonic lodge, and then went to work
</p>
<p>and killed some of the men to whom the charter was given."
</p>
<p>When the enemy surrounded the jail, rushed up the stairway,
</p>
<p>and killed Hyrum Smith, Joseph stood at the open window, his
</p>
<p>martyr-cry being these words, "0 Lord My God!" This was not
</p>
<p>the beginning of a prayer, because Joseph Smith did not pray in
</p>
<p>that manner. This brave, young man who knew that death was
</p>
<p>near, started to repeat the distress signal of the Masons, expecting

<p>EARLY PERSECUTIONS OF THE PROPHET
</p>
<p>By John Reid
</p>
<p>I will return to the persecutions which followed General
</p>
<p>Smith, when his cheeks blossomed with the beauty of youth, and
</p>
<p>his eyes sparkled with innocence. Those bigots soon made up a
</p>
<p>false accusation against him and had him arraigned before Joseph
</p>
<p>Chamberlain, a justice of the peace, a man that was always ready
</p>
<p>to deal justice to all, and a man of great discernment of mind.
</p>
<p>The case came on about 10 o'clock a.m. I was called upon to
</p>
<p>defend the prisoner. The prosecutors employed the best counsel
</p>
<p>66 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>they could get, and ransacked the town of Bainbridge and county
</p>
<p>of Chenango for witnesses that would swear hard enough to convict
</p>
<p>the prisoner; but they entirely failed. Yes, sir, let me say to you
</p>
<p>that not one blemish nor spot teas found against his character, he
</p>
<p>came from that trial, notiuithstanding the mighty efforts that were
</p>
<p>made to convict him of crime by his vigilant persecutors, with his
</p>
<p>character unstained by even the appearance of guilt. The trial
</p>
<p>closed about 12 o'clock at night. After a few moments' deliberation,
</p>
<p>the court pronounced the words "not guilty," and the prisoner was
</p>
<p>discharged. But alas ! the devil, not satisfied with his defeat, stirred
</p>
<p>up a man not unlike himself, who was more fit to dwell among the
</p>
<p>fiends of hell than to belong to the human family, to go to Colesville
</p>
<p>and get another writ, and take him to Broome county for another
</p>
<p>trial. They were sure they could send that boy to hell, or to Texas,
</p>
<p>they did not care which ; and in half an hour after he was discharged
</p>
<p>by the court, he was arrested again, and on the way to Colesville
</p>
<p>for another trial. I was again called upon by his friends to defend
</p>
<p>him against his malignant persecutors, and clear him from the
</p>
<p>false charges they had preferred against him. I made every rea-
</p>
<p>sonable excuse I could, as I was nearly worn down through fatigue
</p>
<p>and want of sleep ; as I had been engaged in lawsuits for two days,
</p>
<p>and nearly the whole of two nights. But I saw the persecution was
</p>
<p>great against him ; and here let me say, Mr. Chairman, singular as it
</p>
<p>may seem, while Mr. Knight was pleading with me to go, a peculiar
</p>
<p>impression or thought struck my mind, that I must go and defend
</p>
<p>him, for he was the Lord's anointed. I did not know what it meant,
</p>
<p>but thought I must go and clear the Lord's anointed. I said I would
</p>
<p>go, and started with as much faith as the Apostles had when they
</p>
<p>could remove mountains, accompanied by Father Knight, who was
</p>
<p>like the old patriarchs that followed the ark of God to the city of
</p>
<p>David. ***** The next morning about 10 o'clock the court was
</p>
<p>organized. The prisoner was to be tried by three justices of the
</p>
<p>peace, that his departure out of the county might be made sure.
</p>

<p>They employed the ablest lawyer in that county, and introduced
</p>
<p>twenty or thirty witnesses before dark, but proved nothing. They
</p>
<p>then sent out runners and ransacked the hills and vales, grog shops
</p>
<p>and ditches, and gathered together a company that looked as if
</p>
<p>they had come from hell and had been whipped by the soot boy
</p>
<p>thereof; which they brought forward to testify one after another,
</p>
<p>but with no better success than before, although they wrung and
</p>
<p>twisted into every shape, in trying to tell something that would
</p>
<p>criminate the prisoner. Nothing was proven against him whatever.
</p>
<p>Having got through with the examination of their witnesses about
</p>
<p>2 o'clock in the morning, the case was argued about two hours.
</p>
<p>There was not one particle of testimony against the prisoner. No,
</p>
<p>sir, he came out like the three children from the fiery furnace, with-
</p>
<p>out the smell of fire upon his garments. The court deliberated upon
</p>
<p>the case for half an hour with closed doors, and then we were called
</p>
<p>in. The court arraigned the prisoner and said : "Mr. Smith, we have
</p>
<p>had your case under consideration, examined the testimony and find
</p>
<p>nothing to condemn you, and therefore you are discharged." They
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY PROPHET AND SAINTS 67
</p>
<p>then proceeded to reprimand him severely; not because anything
</p>
<p>derogatory to his character in any shape had been proven against
</p>
<p>him by the host of witnesses that had testified during the trial, but
</p>
<p>merely to please those fiends in human shape who were engaged
</p>
<p>in the unhallowed persecution of an innocent man, sheerly on ac-
</p>
<p>count of his religious opinions.
</p>
<p>After they had got through, I arose and said : 'This court puts
</p>
<p>me in mind of a certain trial held before Felix of old, when the
</p>
<p>enemies of Paul arraigned him before the venerable judge for some
</p>
<p>alleged crime, and nothing was found in him worthy of death or of
</p>
<p>bonds. Yet, to please the Jews, who were his accusers, he was left
</p>
<p>bound contrary to law ; and this court has served Mr. Smith in the
</p>
<p>same way, by their unlawful and uncalled for reprimand after his
</p>
<p>discharge, to please his accusers." We got him away that night
</p>
<p>from the midst of three hundred people without his receiving any
</p>
<p>injury; but I am well aware that we were assisted by some higher
</p>
<p>power than man; for to look back on the scene, I cannot tell how
</p>
<p>we succeeded in getting him away. I take no glory to myself ; it was
</p>
<p>the Lord's work and marvelous in our eyes.  Times and Seasons,

<p>CHAPTER 4
</p>
<p>Persecution Led by Modern Preachers
</p>
<p>MODERN MINISTERS A PERSECUTING CLASS
</p>
<p>Whenever God has authorized his servants to deliver His
</p>
<p>messages, the counterfeit have also existed, as in the days of Moses,
</p>
<p>Elijah, the Apostles of old, and in our day. Christ said to the
</p>
<p>Scribes and Pharisees, the very men who put him to death, "Ye
</p>
<p>generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell. ,,
</p>
<p>The Redeemer said to the Prophet Joseph Smith in our day, of these
</p>
<p>modern Scribes and Pharisees, these modern priests of Baal : "Their
</p>
<p>creeds were an abomination in His sight; their professors were all
</p>
<p>corrupt ; they draw near to me with their lips but their hearts are
</p>
<p>far from me; they teach for doctrine the commandments of men;
</p>
<p>they have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof ."
</p>
<p>To summarize the part these modern priests have played in
</p>
<p>this generation, the following is quoted from Elder B. H. Roberts'
</p>
<p>reply to the Salt Lake City Ministerial Association :
</p>
<p>"I have been meeting your class, gentlemen, for now thirty
</p>
<p>years ; and have had controversies of various kinds with it during
</p>
<p>that time, and I know you as a class quite thoroughly. I speak from
</p>
<p>experience, not malice, and comparing you as a class with other
</p>
<p>classes of men whom I have known, it is just a plain, solemn truth
</p>
<p>that you are, as a class, narrow, bigoted, intolerant, petty; and I
</p>
<p>say that in the very best of feeling." * * * *
</p>
<p>"These gentlemen reviewers express two fears. One is that
</p>
<p>they will be charged, because of issuing this review, with misrepre-
</p>
<p>sentation. Well, I don't wonder at that, and I think we have proven
</p>
<p>that you have misrepresented. But they also fear that we will
</p>
<p>charge them with persecution. Gentlemen, we acquit you of the
</p>
<p>intention of persecution. When the Revs. Phineas Ewing, Dixon,
</p>
<p>Cavanaugh, Hunter, Bogart, Isaac McCoy, Riley, Pixley, Woods
</p>
<p>and others carried on an agitation in Missouri against "Mormon-
</p>
<p>ism" and the "Mormons" that resulted in burning hundreds of
</p>
<p>our homes and driving our people including women and children,

<p>of the year ; when the mob incited by these reverends, your proto-
</p>
<p>types, gentlemen, laid waste our fields and gardens, stripped our
</p>
<p>people of their earthly possessions, keeping up that agitation until
</p>
<p>twelve thousand or fifteen thousand people were driven from the
</p>
<p>state of Missouri, dispossessed of several hundred thousand acres
</p>
<p>of land  two hundred and fifty thousand acres, to be exact  which
</p>
<p>they had entered, and rendered them homeless  we might call, we
</p>
<p>do call, that persecution. When the Rev. Mr. Levi Williams led the
</p>
<p>mob that shot to death Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum Smith
</p>
<p>in Carthage prison, and when the Rev. Mr. Thomas S. Brockman
</p>
<p>led the forces against Nauvoo, after the great body of the people
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS LED BY MODERN PREACHERS G9
</p>
<p>had withdrawn from that city, and expelled the aged, the widow
</p>
<p>and the fatherless, and laid waste the property of the people  we
</p>
<p>think we are justified in calling that persecution, of which, right
</p>
<p>reverend gentlemen were the chief instigators. And when in this
</p>
<p>territory some years ago one wave of agitation followed another,
</p>
<p>until a reign of terror was produced, and a regime was established
</p>
<p>under which men guilty at most of a misdemeanor, could neverthe-
</p>
<p>less be imprisoned for a term of years covering a lifetime, and fined
</p>
<p>to the exhaustion of all they possessed, under the beautiful scheme
</p>
<p>of segregating the offense into numerous counts in each indict-
</p>
<p>ment; and when in that reign of terror women were compelled to
</p>
<p>clasp their little ones to their breasts and go out among strangers,
</p>
<p>exiled from their homes  we might be inclined to call that per-
</p>
<p>secution. "
</p>
<p>THE CAUSE OF PERSECUTION OF THE SAINTS
</p>
<p>By Benjamin F. Johnson
</p>
<p>And now your question as to the cause of the early persecu-
</p>
<p>tions of the Saints. To answer this question, we should go back to
</p>
<p>its inception to find the cause for the hate that is ever behind to
</p>
<p>incite persecution. Between the present and former dispensations
</p>
<p>there is a striking analogy. Jesus appeared to the learned, haughty,
</p>
<p>dignified and opulent Jews as the "poor illiterate carpenters son
</p>
<p>of Nazareth," a despised "Galilean," who claimed to be the son of
</p>
<p>the Highest, the Great Jehovah, that "without" him there was
</p>
<p>nothing made that was made, that he held "all power both in
</p>
<p>Heaven and on Earth," that he could "destroy the temple and rear
</p>
<p>it up in three days," etc., while the multitude turned from them
</p>
<p>to follow the "lowly Nazarene," hence their envy and jealousy which
</p>
<p>ripened into hate and in their nailing Him as a malefactor to the
</p>
<p>cross; and just so has it been in our day.
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, of lowly birth, was a farm boy of common class,
</p>
<p>poor, illiterate and without distinction other than being religiously
</p>
<p>inclined; he attended revivals, was in the anxious circles honestly
</p>
<p>seeking religion and to learn which was the right church; and

</p>
<p>calling upon the Lord in simple faith that he might know. Both
</p>
<p>the Father and the Son in a pillar of light descended, and in teach-
</p>
<p>ing him commanded that "he join no religious sect, as their creeds
</p>
<p>were all an abomination in His sight."
</p>
<p>This blow, by an ignorant son of poverty at fourteen years of
</p>
<p>age, in the face of all Christendom, was an insult to the dignity of
</p>
<p>all priestly learning, greatness and wealth ; but with their millions
</p>
<p>in Bible, missionary and other societies for converting the world, all
</p>
<p>their greatness defied and denounced by an ignorant boy, their con-
</p>
<p>tempt led to hatred and persecution. And when that boy became
</p>
<p>a man, he claimed to have revelations, and that an angel had
</p>
<p>delivered to him golden plates containing a history of a fallen
</p>
<p>people, and that God, through him, was about to restore the
</p>
<p>ancient gospel in its purity, which, if true, would blot out all their
</p>
<p>greatness. Inspired by hate, they made lies their weapons with
</p>
<p>which to fight the truth ; both of which are attributes of the devil.

<p>FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS

<p>THE JOHNSON RESIDENCE

<p>stood in 1830-31, when it was the home of the Johnson family, and some of its
</p>
<p>rooms were occupied by the Prophet and his family. It was the right hand

<p>upper room (east end) that was used by the Prophet Joseph as a translation

<p>mob, cruelly beaten, tarred and feathered, and only saved from a still more

<p>horrible violence by the mercy of God. The door immediately facing the read-

</p>
<p>JOSEPH SMITH IS TARRED AND FEATHERED
</p>
<p>By John D. Barber
</p>
<p>While on a mission in the Northern States, and laboring in
</p>
<p>the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan, on March 24, 1902, I, in com-
</p>
<p>pany with Lorenzo Sorenson of Smithfield, Utah, were tracting
</p>
<p>from house to house and called at the home of a Mr. Silas Raymond
</p>
<p>who was in possession of two relics in the shape of a tar bucket and
</p>
<p>a dark lantern used the night of the horrible mobbing of the
</p>
<p>Prophet Joseph which occurred on March 25, 1832. Mr. Raymond
</p>
<p>answered the door and when we introduced ourselves as Mormon
</p>
<p>missionaries, he uttered an oath "G  D  you Mormons, come in.
</p>
<p>I want to show you something." He excused himself and returned
</p>
<p>in a few minutes with a tar bucket which was made from a block
</p>
<p>of wood 8 inches in diameter and 10 or 12 inches in height, chiseled
</p>
<p>out to make a bucket, a hole bored through each side at the top
</p>
<p>and a piece of rope knotted at each end to make the handle. It
</p>
<p>was a very crude affair. It was covered with hard tar both inside
</p>
<p>and out and had never been used for anything after the mobbing.
</p>
<p>The lantern was called a dark lantern ; and was about the size of a
</p>
<p>one gallon can. It had a pointed top on it to shed rain and a wire
</p>
<p>handle attached, with a little door cut in the side, through which a
</p>
<p>candle was put into the can and lighted. There were perforations 
</p>
<p>diamondshape, heart shape and crescent shape, also decorations
</p>
<p>were used to let the light flicker out.

</p>
<p>Upon returning with these relics he uttered another oath:
</p>
<p>("There they are, G  d  you.") and placed them before us say-
</p>
<p>ing:  "Pick 'em up; handle 'em; look 'em over," and stated that
</p>
<p>they were used on the night of the mobbing of the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith at Hiram, Ohio, while at the home of Brother Johnson.
</p>
<p>He stated that this bucket filled with liquid tar was poured
</p>
<p>over the head of Joe Smith and he was rolled onto a feather tick
</p>
<p>which had been ripped open and was rolled into the feathers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Raymond stated that his father was one of the leaders
</p>
<p>of the mob and that from the time of this mobbing something
</p>
<p>seemed to have come upon his father that he was never well again ;
</p>
<p>was finally confined to his bed where slow death came upon him,
</p>
<p>mortification setting in at his toes and he died by inches as mor-
</p>
<p>tification worked its way upward. Before dying he called his
</p>
<p>family together and talked with them regarding the mobbing and
</p>
<p>72 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>their future course in life, stating that his days were numbered,
</p>
<p>but he wanted to tell them that so far as he was concerned they
</p>
<p>could please themselves which religious denomination they affiliated
</p>
<p>themselves with, but for his part he was convinced that Joe Smith
</p>
<p>was all that he ever claimed to be  a prophet of God.
</p>
<p>After viewing these relics, and returning to our rooms, we
</p>
<p>thought a great deal about them and wrote to President Joseph F.
</p>
<p>Smith, President of the Church, asking if he thought such relics
</p>
<p>would be genuine. We received an answer to our letter stating
</p>
<p>that there was no question but what they were genuine and in-
</p>
<p>structed us to buy the relics from Mr. Raymond if a reasonable
</p>
<p>price could be agreed on, so that they could be put in the Church
</p>
<p>museum. Mr. Raymond refused to sell them stating that they had
</p>
<p>been handed down from his father's death to the oldest member of
</p>
<p>the family and they were to be kept in the family as long as they
</p>
<p>desired to have them. He said they were of no use to him, the
</p>
<p>Church should have them but it was his father's request that they
</p>
<p>should be kept in the family.
</p>
<p>Two of this Mr. Raymond's aunts joined the Church and
</p>
<p>moved West with the Saints.

<p>the men who took part in that raid had suffered a painful death.

<p>Miles Norton who poisoned the Johnson watch dog was killed by a

<p>ram in the barnyard, its spiral horn being thrust through Norton's

</p>
<p>of our rest in taking care of them, especially my wife. In the
</p>
<p>evening I told her she had better retire to rest with one of the
</p>
<p>children, and I would watch with the sickest child. In the night she
</p>
<p>told me I had better lay down on the trundle bed, and I did so, and
</p>
<p>was soon after awoke by her screaming murder! when I found
</p>
<p>myself going out of the door, in the hands of about a dozen men ;
</p>
<p>some of whose hands were in my hair, and some hold of my shirt,
</p>
<p>drawers and limbs. The foot of the trundle bed was towards the
</p>
<p>door, leaving only room enough for the door to swing. My wife
</p>
<p>heard a gentle tapping on the windows, which she then took no
</p>
<p>particular notice of, (but which was unquestionably designed for
</p>
<p>ascertaining whether we were all asleep,) and soon after the mob
</p>
<p>burst open the door and surrounded the bed in an instant, and, as
</p>
<p>I said, the first I knew I was going out of the door in the hands of
</p>
<p>an infuriated mob. I made a desperate struggle, as I was forced
</p>
<p>out, to extricate myself, but only cleared one leg, with which I
</p>
<p>made a pass at one man, and he fell on the door steps. I was im-
</p>
<p>mediately confined again; and they swore by God, they would kill
</p>
<p>me if I did not be still, which quieted me. As they passed around
</p>
<p>the house with me, the fellow that I kicked came to me and thrust
</p>
<p>his hand into my face, all covered with blood, (for I hit him on
</p>
<p>the nose,) and with an exulting horse laugh, muttering 'he, hee,
</p>
<p>G  d damn ye, I'll fix ye.'
</p>
<p>"Then they seized me by the throat and held on until I lost
</p>
<p>my breath. After I came to, as they passed along with me, about
</p>
<p>thirty rods from the house, I saw Elder Rigdon stretched out on
</p>
<p>the ground, whither they had dragged him by the heels. I sup-
</p>
<p>posed he was dead.
</p>
<p>"I began to plead with them, saying, 'you will have mercy,
</p>
<p>and spare my life, I hope.' To which they replied, 'G  d damn ye,
</p>
<p>call on yer God f er help, we'll show ye no mercy' ; and the people
</p>
<p>began to show themselves in every direction ; one coming from the
</p>
<p>orchard had a plank, and I expected they would kill me, and carry
</p>
<p>me off on the plank. They then turned to the right, and went on

<p>about thirty rods farther, about sixty rods from the house, and
</p>
<p>thirty from where I saw Elder Rigdon, into the meadow, where
</p>
<p>they stopped, and one said, 'Simonds, Simonds' (meaning, I sup-
</p>
<p>pose, Simonds Rider,) 'pull up his drawers, pull up his drawers,
</p>
<p>he will take cold. Another replied: 'aint ye going to kill 'im? aint
</p>
<p>ye going to kill 'im?' when a group of mobbers collected a little
</p>
<p>way off, and said: 'Simonds, Simonds, come here'; and Simonds
</p>
<p>charged those who had hold of me to keep me from touching the
</p>
<p>ground, (as they had done all the time) lest I should get a spring
</p>
<p>upon them. They went and held a council, and as I could occasion-
</p>
<p>ally overhear a word, I supposed it was to know whether it was
</p>
<p>best to kill me. They returned after a while, when I learned that
</p>
<p>they had concluded not to kill me, but pound and scratch me well,
</p>
<p>tear off my shirt and drawers, and leave me naked. One cried,
</p>
<p>'Simonds, Simonds, where' s the tar bucket?' 'I don't know,' an-
</p>
<p>swered one, 'where 'tis; Eli's left it.' They ran back and fetched
</p>
<p>the bucket of tar, when one exclaimed, 'G  d damn it, let us tar
</p>
<p>up his mouth ;' and they tried to force the tar-paddle in my mouth.
</p>
<p>74 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>I twisted my head around, so that they could not; and they cried
</p>
<p>out, *G  d damn ye, hold up yer head, and let us give ye some tar.'
</p>
<p>They then tried to force a vial into my mouth, and I broke it in my
</p>
<p>teeth. All my clothes were torn off me except my shirt collar ; and
</p>
<p>one man fell on me and scratched my body with his nails like a
</p>
<p>mad cat, and then muttered out: 'G  d damn ye, that's the way
</p>
<p>the Holy Ghost falls on folks.'
</p>
<p>"They then left me, and I attempted to arise, but fell again ;
</p>
<p>I pulled the tar away from my lips, etc., so that I could breathe
</p>
<p>more freely, and after awhile I began to recover, and raised myself
</p>
<p>up, when I saw two lights. I made my way towards one of them,
</p>
<p>and found it was Father Johnson's. When I had come to the door,
</p>
<p>I was naked, and the tar made me look as though I had been cov-
</p>
<p>ered with blood, and when my wife saw me she thought I was all
</p>
<p>mashed to pieces, and fainted. During the affray abroad, the
</p>
<p>sisters of the neighborhood had collected at my room. I called for
</p>
<p>a blanket; they threw me one and shut the door: I wrapped it
</p>
<p>around me and went in."
</p>
<p>In this inhuman onslaught, Sidney Rigdon was dragged by his
</p>
<p>heels over the frozen ground until his head was badly lacerated,
</p>
<p>which rendered him delirious for several days. "Father Johnson"
</p>
<p>was also roughly handled. Joseph's friends spent the remainder
</p>
<p>of the night in removing the tar and washing and cleansing his
</p>
<p>body, so that he could be clothed again. The next day was Sunday,
</p>
<p>and true to his mission, and agreeably with his determined purpose
</p>
<p>to do the will of heaven, he went to meeting, with his "flesh all
</p>
<p>scarified and defaced," and preached to a congregation, among
</p>
<p>whom were the identical mobbers who had thus invaded his home,
</p>
<p>dragged him from his imploring wife and sick children, and abused
</p>
<p>him in a manner disgraceful even to the character of savages, and
</p>
<p>in the afternoon baptized three individuals.
</p>
<p>Owing to the exposure to which the sick children were sub-
</p>
<p>jected through this sudden and cruel demonstration, one of them
</p>
<p>received a severe cold and died soon afterwards.

<p>The mobbers were mostly, if not entirely, professors of reli-
</p>
<p>gion. Simonds Rider, the leader of the mob, was a Campbellite
</p>
<p>preacher. Not satisfied with the cruelties inflicted, they kept up

<p>their aggressive demonstrations around "Father Johnson's" for

<p>THE FIRST APOSTATES OF THE CHURCH
</p>
<p>By B. H. Roberts
</p>
<p>Beautiful for situation is Hiram, one of the many incorporated
</p>
<p>hamlets of northern Ohio.
</p>
<p>A mile and a half westward from what Hiramites call the
</p>
<p>"center," meaning by that the college campus and the neat modern
</p>
<p>cottage homes that face it as a public square, is the old "Johnson
</p>
<p>homestead," where the Prophet Joseph Smith lived for some months
</p>
<p>during the eventful years of 1831 and 1832. Here in the east
</p>
<p>upper room he, with Sidney Rigdon as scribe, "translated" or what
</p>
<p>PERSECUTIONS LED BY MODERN PREACHERS 75
</p>
<p>would be more appropriate to say "revised" the King James' trans-
</p>
<p>lation of the Bible. Here, on the front steps of the Johnson resi-
</p>
<p>dence, the Prophet frequently preached to the multitudes that came
</p>
<p>from the surrounding country to hear him. Here several revela-
</p>
<p>tions were received, including what will doubtless be regarded
</p>
<p>as the grandest revelation of all, that God has given in this dis-
</p>
<p>pensation of the fullness of times  namely, the vision of the future
</p>
<p>glories to which men may attain. That revelation which upsets the
</p>
<p>theology of modern Christendom, and makes it clear that God is
</p>
<p>indeed just, and that men can be, and will be judged according to
</p>
<p>the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil.
</p>
<p>Here, too, the Prophet suffered one of the most painful and
</p>
<p>brutal persecutions that overtook him in his eventful career. On
</p>
<p>the night of the 25th of March, 1832, the Johnson residence was
</p>
<p>quietly surrounded by a mob of the Prophet's 'enemies, determined
</p>
<p>to kill him, or do him great bodily injury. Worn out with watch-
</p>
<p>ing over the sick children of John Murdock, whom the prophet's
</p>
<p>wife Emma, had taken to rear as her own, Joseph did not hear the
</p>
<p>tapping on the windowpane, which was doubtless made by the
</p>
<p>mob to ascertain if all were asleep in the household. The first
</p>
<p>thing the Prophet was conscious of was the screams of his wife
</p>
<p>and the fact that he was being carried bodily from the house into
</p>
<p>the field. (See preceding article: "Devil's Incarnate Led by Sec-
</p>
<p>tarian Ministers.")
</p>
<p>The treatment of Sidney Rigdon on the same occasion
</p>
<p>was more severe. He was dragged by the heels over the
</p>
<p>hard frozen ground for a distance of some 30 rods, beaten into in-
</p>
<p>sensibility, covered with tar and feathers, and left for dead. He
</p>
<p>was living just across the road from Father Johnson's, in a log
</p>
<p>house, at the time of the outrage, and for several days was de-
</p>
<p>lirious. The villagers point out to this day the oak tree under
</p>
<p>which he was tarred and feathered. "Why did the mob abuse these
</p>
<p>men," I asked Hartwell Rider, to whom I had been recommended
</p>
<p>as the "wise man" of the village, well versed in the history and

</p>
<p>folklore of the neighborhood. "Well, the people did not want Hiram
</p>
<p>to be a Mormon center ; and there was a man down at Shallersville
</p>
<p>whose wife had joined the Mormon Church and was agoing with
</p>
<p>the Mormons to Missouri  that was their Zion then, you know."
</p>
<p>By the way, this Hartwell Rider, with whom I talked for the bet-
</p>
<p>ter part of half a day, is the son of Simonds Rider, a noted Camp-
</p>
<p>bellite preacher, who joined the Church at Hiram in 1831. From
</p>
<p>remarks made by the different members of the mob who assaulted
</p>
<p>the Prophet on that night of the 25th of March, 1832, Simonds
</p>
<p>Rider was the leader of the mob; but his son Hartwell denies it,
</p>
<p>and asks that it be erased from the "Mormon" books. "Well," I
</p>
<p>replied, "that may be somewhat difficult, but I am happy to know
</p>
<p>that you denounce the mobbing, and are anxious to sever the as-
</p>
<p>sociation of your father's name with such an infamy."
</p>
<p>It may be of interest to remark also that Simonds Rider and
</p>
<p>Ezra Booth were among the first apostates of the Church. The
</p>
<p>thing which took Rider out of the Church is rather humorous.
</p>
<p>76 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>It is claimed by his son, Hartwell, who seems a little ashamed that
</p>
<p>his father ever was a "Mormon," that a revelation was received
</p>
<p>by Joseph to the effect that Rider was to be an Elder in the Church,
</p>
<p>and preach the Gospel, "but unfortunately/' says the son, "both in
</p>
<p>the revelation and in the Elder's certificate the name Rider was
</p>
<p>spelled R-y-d-e-r instead of R-i-d-e-r." This led the former Camp-
</p>
<p>bellite preacher to "suspect" the inspiration that could make a
</p>
<p>mistake in orthography, and so he left the Church! Ezra Booth
</p>
<p>generally, though erroneously supposed to be the first apostate
</p>
<p>from the Church, also lived at Hiram for a time, and here wrote
</p>
<p>the anti-"Mormon" letters which will be his chief claim to fame.
</p>
<p>"What became of Booth after he left the Mormon Church?" I
</p>
<p>asked Hartwell Rider, "Did he prosper, was he a successful man?"
</p>
<p>The old man shook his head. "No; if you mean in a business way.
</p>
<p>Nor in any other way, for matter of that. You see, he was not a
</p>
<p>strong man. He tried to please everybody to whom he preached.
</p>
<p>He was not a man to take a stand and draw people to him. He
</p>
<p>preached for the Methodists for a while, after he left the Mormons,
</p>
<p>and then he went to spiritualism, then became an infidel and died
</p>
<p>here a few years ago at Garretsville without any faith in God or
</p>
<p>man." "Alas!" I mentally exclaimed, "how alike is the fate of
</p>
<p>those who turn from the faith in the restored Gospel of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ! What a sad repetition it is  this wrecking of faith in
</p>
<p>'God and man' when men who have received the light turn from
</p>
<p>it to darkness ! It was promised in the very inception of the work
</p>
<p>that it should be a saver of life unto life or of death unto death, and
</p>
<p>truly the experience of the Church proves the declaration true.
</p>
<p>Anti-Mormon writers cite the fact here alluded to as an evidence
</p>
<p>of the soul-destroying power of Mormonism, saying that it leaves a
</p>
<p>trail of infidelity wherever it has been received. That is true,
</p>
<p>however, only in so far as men having once given to it their al-
</p>
<p>legiance, then turn away from it. The beggarly elements from
</p>
<p>which it called them could never seem quite the same to them after

</p>
<p>they had once tasted the good word of God and the powers of the
</p>
<p>world to come." But those who have remained true to "Mormonism"
</p>
<p>and the obligations it enjoins, have not lost faith either in God or
</p>
<p>man ; but have died happy in the hope and may I not say, knowledge,
</p>
<p>of the reality of that eternal life which God, who cannot lie, prom-
</p>
<p>ised before the world began.
</p>
<p>Thoughtful men will look deeper for the meaning of what all
</p>
<p>admit is a singular fact, viz. : that those who accept "Mormonism"
</p>
<p>and then turn from it end in believing in nothing: and they will
</p>
<p>see in that fact the evidence that these men have touched in their
</p>
<p>lives some very vital truth, and proving recreant to it has left them
</p>
<p>truth-stranded, by which I mean stripped of the truth or the power
</p>
<p>to comprehend it or hold to it. In them the word of God is verified :
</p>
<p>"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and
</p>
<p>have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the
</p>
<p>Holy Ghost ... if they shall fall away to renew them again to re-
</p>
<p>pentance ; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh
</p>
<p>and put Him to an open shame."

</p>
<p>THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS WILL PERSECUTE THE SAINTS
</p>
<p>By Orson Pratt
</p>
<p>Although the great "mother of abominations" has not gathered
</p>
<p>together in multitudes upon the face of the earth against the Lamb
</p>
<p>of God and his Saints, yet there has been enough fulfilled to show
</p>
<p>that the balance will be accomplished. Has this great and abom-
</p>
<p>inable power, under the name of the "mother of harlots," popularly
</p>
<p>called Christendom, fought against the Saints in this country?
</p>
<p>Let the history of this Church answer that question ; let the scenes
</p>
<p>we have passed through in the land of Missouri testify; let the
</p>
<p>tribulation this people had to endure in the State of Illinois bear
</p>
<p>witness. We will not refer to persecutions in Utah, for here we
</p>
<p>have had but little compared with scenes we have passed through
</p>
<p>in former years. Suffice it to say, multitudes have been gathered
</p>
<p>together, under the influence of what? Under the influence of that
</p>
<p>great and abominable church or system called "the mother of
</p>
<p>harlots."
</p>
<p>When we come to search to the bottom of this matter, we find
</p>
<p>that it has been the great influence which has produced all the
</p>
<p>persecutions that have come upon the Latter-day Saints since the
</p>
<p>organization of this Church. How many preachers were gathered
</p>
<p>together in the western part of Missouri, at the time we were
</p>
<p>driven from the State, to give their advice in a pretended court-
</p>
<p>martial to have some fifteen or twenty of the leaders of this people
</p>
<p>taken out and shot on the public square the next morning? There
</p>
<p>were not less than seventeen priests who advised the measure.
</p>
<p>When we come to hunt for the great influence that has existed
</p>
<p>on the multitudes that gathered to persecute the Saints of the Lamb
</p>
<p>of God, we find it proceeding from the pulpit. Through the false-
</p>
<p>hoods of priests and the publishing of false principles, they have
</p>
<p>endeavored to set on the frenzied multitude to put to death the
</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints and deprive them of citizenship.***
</p>
<p>Let us now go to Canada, and there a religious influence existed,

</p>
<p>mobs arose, multitudes were gathered together, and the Saints
</p>
<p>were stoned, hunted, and driven to and fro, and had to flee from
</p>
<p>place to place. This persecution was raised by the "mother of
</p>
<p>harlots," the "mother of abominations," because of what? Because
</p>
<p>we told them the Lord had revealed the same kind of religion
</p>
<p>in our day that he had eighteen hundred years ago. Go to England,
</p>
<p>and the same has happened there. Multitudes and multitudes
</p>
<p>started up against us. The Elders have had forty to fifty police
</p>
<p>to guard them from their meetings to their homes, to keep them
</p>
<p>from being destroyed by the tens of thousands of people that
</p>
<p>blockaded the streets for miles in length.
</p>
<p>I know these things to be facts from actual experience. I have
</p>
<p>passed through them. I have had tens of thousands rush upon me
</p>
<p>with the fury of tigers, and they were only restrained by the power
</p>
<p>of God.*** Go to Denmark and we find the same opposing power;
</p>
<p>and whenever this Church has been organized, or a branch estab-
</p>
<p>lished, the "mother of abominations" has marshalled her host.

</p>
<p>Conspiracies Against the Life of
</p>
<p>the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>JUDASES OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH
</p>
<p>At a meeting of the city council in December, 1843, the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of the menace to the city and the mayor was under consider-
</p>
<p>ation, and Joseph said among other things:
</p>
<p>I am exposed to far greater danger from traitors among our-
</p>
<p>selves than from enemies without, although my life has been sought
</p>
<p>for many years by the civil and military authorities, priests and
</p>
<p>people of Missouri ; and if I can escape from the ungrateful treachery
</p>
<p>of assassins, I can live as Caesar might have lived, were it not
</p>
<p>for a right-hand Brutus. I have had pretended friends betray me.
</p>
<p>All the enemies upon the face of the earth may roar and exert all
</p>
<p>their power to bring about my death, but they can accomplish nothing,
</p>
<p>unless some who are among us, who have enjoyed our society, have
</p>
<p>been with us in our councils, participated in our confidence, taken
</p>
<p>us by the hand, called us brother, saluted us with a kiss, join with
</p>
<p>our enemies, turn our virtues into faults, and, by falsehood and deceit,
</p>
<p>stir up their wrath and indignation against us, and bring their
</p>
<p>united vengeance upon our heads. All the hue and cry of the chief
</p>
<p>priests and elders against the Savior could not bring down the
</p>
<p>wrath of the Jewish nation upon his head, and thereby cause the
</p>
<p>crucifixion of the Son of God, until Judas said unto them. 'Whom-
</p>
<p>soever I shall kiss he is the man; hold him fast.' Judas was one of
</p>
<p>the Twelve Apostles, even their treasurer, and dipped with their
</p>
<p>Master in the dish, and through his treachery, the crucifixion was
</p>
<p>brought about; and we have a judas in our midst.
</p>
<p>The Judas spirit manifested itself in Nauvoo in the spring of
</p>
<p>1844. Alarmed by the Prophet's declaration that there was a
</p>
<p>right hand Brutus near him, some of the men who were willing
</p>
<p>to betray him feared that their machinations were discovered and
</p>
<p>that vengeance might be wreaked upon them. William Law and
</p>
<p>William Marks both feared or affected to fear for their lives. They

</p>
<p>made complaint which reached the ears of the Prophet, and he
</p>
<p>ordered an investigation in which they were allowed the fullest
</p>
<p>license to examine witnesses. The result was to show to them how
</p>
<p>utterly groundless was their fear ; but further it showed to all the
</p>
<p>Saints that these men were not faithful. The people said :
</p>
<p>"Is it possible that Brother Law or Brother Marks is a traitor
</p>
<p>and would deliver Joseph into the hands of his enemies in Missouri?
</p>
<p>If not, what can be the meaning of this? The righteous are bold
</p>
<p>as a lion."
</p>
<p>Joseph merely quoted:
</p>
<p>"The wicked flee when no man pursueth."
</p>
<p>But from this time on he knew from what quarter to expect
</p>
<p>the kiss of Judas. Jealousy of the Prophet and their personal im-
</p>
<p>purity led several leading men to apostasy and to a thirst for
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 79
</p>
<p>Joseph's blood. Among them were William Law, Wilson Law,
</p>
<p>Chauncey L. Higbee, Francis M. Higbee and Robert D. Foster. They
</p>
<p>became his avowed enemies; but in secret sympathy with them
</p>
<p>were Sidney Rigdon, William Marks and Austin A. Cowles.
</p>
<p>William Law was the leader of the movement. He declared
</p>
<p>that Joseph was a fallen Prophet, and he attempted to set up a
</p>
<p>church of his own. These apostates sought by every means in
</p>
<p>their power to precipitate bloodshed in Nauvoo. They flagrantly
</p>
<p>violated the law; insulted, abused and threatened the officers;
</p>
<p>usurped official prerogatives; attempted to shoot Joseph; and
</p>
<p>spread throughout the country, and even beyond its confines, the
</p>
<p>most wicked misrepresentations and complaints concerning Joseph
</p>
<p>and the municipal administration of Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>The Prophet had long known of their treachery and had
</p>
<p>warned the Saints that Judases were in their midst, without nam-
</p>
<p>ing the individuals. He knew that in a little time the traitors would
</p>
<p>betray themselves. When this expectation of the Prophet's was
</p>
<p>realized and the Saints were enabled to see the perfidy of these
</p>
<p>men, they were excommunicated.
</p>
<p>After this it seemed as if Satan was turned loose in their souls.
</p>
<p>Having no longer any profit in concealment they blazoned forth
</p>
<p>their hatred for the Prophet and their own iniquities. Some of
</p>
<p>them confessed that they knew that their sins were finding them
</p>
<p>out and that they would soon have no reputation to lose anyhow,
</p>
<p>and therefore they would persecute the Prophet and try to drag
</p>
<p>him down with them. At this time anonymous letters threatening
</p>
<p>the lives of Joseph and Hyrum were received and every conceiv-
</p>
<p>able annoyance was perpetrated upon them.
</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 25th day of May, 1844, the Prophet was
</p>
<p>informed that he had been indicted at Carthage for the alleged
</p>
<p>offenses of polygamy and perjury on the testimony of William
</p>
<p>Law and others. Two days later learning that warrants were
</p>
<p>out for him from the circuit court upon these indictments, he

</p>
<p>determined to proceed to Carthage and give himself up. He had
</p>
<p>a double purpose to serve in this action: He desired as usual to
</p>
<p>show his respect for law and legal process ; and he wanted to avoid
</p>
<p>having a Carthage mob come into Nauvoo to serve the writs. At
</p>
<p>Carthage he was informed by Charles Foster and other apostates,
</p>
<p>who repented their purpose for the moment, that a plot had been
</p>
<p>laid for his death and that it was determined that he should not
</p>
<p>leave that place alive. He secured lawyers and endeavored to have
</p>
<p>his case brought forward for trial; but the prosecution insisted
</p>
<p>upon delay and secured a postponement until the next term. In
</p>
<p>the meantime Joseph was to be released on bail satisfactory to the
</p>
<p>sheriff ; and that officer told him to go his way without bonds until
</p>
<p>called upon.
</p>
<p>His friends gathered around him when he prepared to de-
</p>
<p>part for home, and by this means his life was saved, for armed
</p>
<p>men threatened him and tried by force and stratagem to detain
</p>
<p>him in Carthage until after dark that they might the better ac-
</p>
<p>complish the assassination. But he knew their plot and departed,

<p>CHARACTER OF CONSPIRATORS
</p>
<p>By George Q. Cannon
</p>
<p>William and Wilson Law, Chauncey L. and Francis M. Higbee,
</p>
<p>Dr. Robert D. Foster, and others, were rank, bloodthirsty apostates.
</p>
<p>They were leagued together, and had for their associates men who
</p>
<p>were resolved to kill the prophet if they could. "Anti-Mormon"
</p>
<p>organizations and mobs could have had but little influence if all
</p>
<p>who had made profession of being Latter-day Saints had been true
</p>
<p>to their brethren and their religion. But these men had trans-
</p>
<p>gressed the laws of God, they had indulged in adultery, whoredom
</p>
<p>and lust, and had, therefore, lost the Spirit of the Lord.
</p>
<p>Besides these open and avowed apostates, there were men still
</p>
<p>remaining in the Church who sympathized with them, and who,
</p>
<p>at heart, were traitors to Joseph, and the work of God. Prominent
</p>
<p>among these were Sidney Rigdon, William Marks and Austin A.
</p>
<p>Cowles. There were many others, also, of lesser note. One of
</p>
<p>these was a man by the name of James Blakeslee. We recollect
</p>

<p>Charles Henry Stoddard was born on the 21st of April, 1827,
</p>
<p>in Newark, New Jersey, his parents being Israel Stoddard and
</p>
<p>Sarah Woodward. As a boy he was employed by the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, in Nauvoo, Illinois. While the Prophet was in hid-
</p>
<p>ing, he carried food to the Prophet and delivered messages to and
</p>
<p>from the Prophet. The Prophet trusted him implicitly. Upon
</p>
<p>one occasion, when in the street fixing a kite, with other boys, a
</p>
<p>man came up and inquired where the Prophet was, to which
</p>
<p>Charles replied : "He went to heaven on Hyrum's white horse and
</p>
<p>we are fixing this kite to send his dinner to him." No one suspected
</p>
<p>his important duties because of his youth.
</p>
<p>While employed by the Prophet Joseph, William Law request-
</p>
<p>ed Charles to come and work for him. He did not want to. After
</p>
<p>consulting the Prophet, he decided to do so. During his employ-
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 81
</p>
<p>ment with William Law, many private matters were talked of by
</p>
<p>Law and his associates in the presence of the boy, without any
</p>
<p>hesitation, perhaps thinking that the boy would not pay any at-
</p>
<p>tention to what was said. The boy was nevertheless on the alert
</p>
<p>and took full cognizance of what was going on.
</p>
<p>Upon retiring one evening, in a lean-to attached to a building
</p>
<p>which was partly vacant and partly used for storage purposes, the
</p>
<p>lad was awakened by conversation being held in the vacant por-
</p>
<p>tion of the building. This building was a rendezvous of the bitter
</p>
<p>apostates and enemies of the Prophet among whom was William
</p>
<p>Law, who seemed to be a ringleader. The lad listened through a
</p>
<p>hole in the log structure through which light was also emerging,
</p>
<p>and learned that these men were plotting against the Prophet's
</p>
<p>life. He heard Law tell this group of apostates that he would have
</p>
<p>Charles clean, oil and load his gun which was one of his regular
</p>
<p>duties. After the group had disbanded and had all left the build-
</p>
<p>ing, the lad dressed and hurried to the home of the Prophet and
</p>
<p>told him all that he had seen and heard and asked the Prophet
</p>
<p>what he should do. The Prophet told him to return and act as
</p>
<p>though nothing had happened, and to do as his employer requested,
</p>
<p>and admonished him to load the gun well. He told the boy that
</p>
<p>they could not hurt him until his time had arrived. The boy did
</p>
<p>as requested. The next morning, Mr. Law requested him to clean,
</p>
<p>oil and load his six shooter, which was faithfully done as the
</p>
<p>Prophet advised. When the opportune time arrived, Law aimed
</p>
<p>the revolver at the Prophet with the intention of killing him. He
</p>
<p>pulled the trigger but the gun mis-fired as did all of the other five
</p>
<p>loads in the six shooter. He cursed because the gun did not dis-
</p>
<p>charge, and blamed the boy for not loading the weapon properly.
</p>
<p>The boy replied that he had done it to the best of his ability. Law
</p>
<p>then aimed at a post and all six loads were discharged.

<p>JUDASES FIRST SIN AND NEXT BETRAY
</p>
<p>By George Q. Cannon
</p>
<p>Do you doubt the existence of a devil and of evil spirits? Need
</p>
<p>I ask the Latter-day Saints this? Have you not seen his spirit
</p>
<p>manifested? You have seen men and women in this Church who
</p>
<p>once were faithful and devoted to the work of God; but they fell
</p>
<p>into sin, and another spirit took possession of them. Men as high
</p>
<p>as members of the First Presidency have done this. / remember
</p>
<p>very ivell William Laiv, counselor to the Prophet Joseph, a friend of
</p>
<p>the Prophet, a friend of God apparently, a staunch man in the
</p>
<p>Church; but he committed sin, and that man, ivho had occupied that
</p>
<p>high and exalted station, cornpassed the death of the Prophet. He
</p>
<p>was one of the chief conspirators in arranging plans for his de-
</p>
<p>struction, and took an active part in urging on his martyrdom.
</p>
<p>Members of the council of the Twelve Apostles also partook of the
</p>
<p>same spirit. It is the spirit that Satan possesses ; for Jesus said of
</p>
<p>him that he was a liar and a murderer from the beginning. He is
</p>
<p>seeking constantly to destroy the work of God, filling men with his
</p>
<p>spirit, and urging them forward to acts of deadly hate, even to kill
</p>
<p>and to destroy. That is the spirit of Satan, and we see it mani-
</p>
<p>fested in men. Millennial Star, 60:214.

<p>ANOTHER WITNESS TESTIFIES
</p>
<p>By Sarah H. Thomas
</p>
<p>Charles Henry Stoddard was born April 21, 1827, at New
</p>
<p>Jersey. His parents and family joined the church and moved to
</p>
<p>Nauvoo in 1842, he being 15 years old and the eldest of the family
</p>
<p>of six. They suffered the persecutions with the rest of the saints.
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 83
</p>
<p>He lived with the Prophet Joseph for a while. He also ivorked for
</p>
<p>William Latu, one of the outlaivs and leaders of the gang that was
</p>
<p>continually plotting and planning against the Prophet. Mr. Law,
</p>
<p>not knowing that Mr. Stoddard was a friend of the Prophet or in-
</p>
<p>terested in him in any tvay, ivas not as careful when talking of him
</p>
<p>as he otherzvise ivould have been. Father (Mr. Stoddard) slept up-
</p>
<p>stairs directly over the room where Mr. Law and his associates held
</p>
<p>their secret meetings and could hear distinctly all their plans, and
</p>
<p>as there happened to be a hole in the floor, he could look down and
</p>
<p>see tvho ivas there. He would then go and tell the Prophet of their
</p>
<p>plans and in this way he %vas kept posted to the traps that they set
</p>
<p>for him.
</p>
<p>In April 1846, two years after the death of the Prophet, they
</p>
<p>were ordered out of Nauvoo. They crossed the Mississippi river in
</p>
<p>an old wooden boat they had fixed. They took with them two
</p>
<p>feather beds, a little clothing and some provisions. When they were
</p>
<p>crossing the river, they looked back and saw their homes being
</p>
<p>burned. Through the exposure and hardships their parents and
</p>
<p>one brother (an infant) died; the mother died first and the babe
</p>
<p>five weeks later. Six weeks from the time the mother died, the
</p>
<p>father passed away, leaving five children homeless and almost
</p>
<p>penniless, but not friendless, as the saints were very kind to them
</p>
<p>and helped them all they could.

<p>CONSPIRACY OF NAUVOO

<p>By Horace H. Cummings
</p>
<p>The following note was dictated to the Compiler of this book on
</p>
<p>Aug. 8, 1932, by Horace H. Cummings, the author of the article:
</p>
<p>The Nauvoo Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>"The article called THE NAUVOO CONSPIRACY, printed in
</p>
<p>Volume 5, beginning about page 250, of the CONTRIBUTOR,

</p>
<p>home during the spring conference of 1883, Brother Harris stopping
</p>
<p>at our home as our guest. The incidents seemed so important and
</p>
<p>so intensely interesting that I wrote them in my journal in det ul.
</p>
<p>As the CONTRIBUTOR was offering a prize for a Christmas Story,
</p>
<p>I extended my journal account somewhat and wrote that article in
</p>
<p>competition for the prize. Before submitting the article to the press,
</p>
<p>however, at the request of President John Taylor, I read it to him line
</p>
<p>by line as he was in Nauvoo at the time the narration deals with and
</p>
<p>the incidents happened and of course was with the Prophet at the
</p>
<p>time he was killed. He was familiar with many of the things to
</p>
<p>which the article refers and added certain elements to the story.
</p>
<p>When completed, President Taylor gave it his hearty approval for
</p>
<p>publication as a valuable document concerning Church history which
</p>
<p>had never been previously published. The secret was held between
</p>
<p>the Prophet and his body guard, John Scott who was the brother of
</p>
<p>Robert Scott, the companion of Dennison L. Harris.
</p>
<p>"The Prophet Joseph placed the two young men above men-
</p>
<p>tioned under covenant that thev would not reveal what took place as
</p>
<p>related in this CONSPIRACY for twenty years. The first time that
</p>
<p>it was revealed was at the dedication of the St. George Temple,
</p>
<p>when Brother Harris revealed it to President Brigham Young,

</p>
<p>Those who have read the life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet,
</p>
<p>must be familiar with the fact that from his earliest boyhood he
</p>
<p>was ever the object of bitter persecution. Notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>numerous published accounts of mobbings, drivings, bodily in-
</p>
<p>juries, aggravating accusations, mock trials, and murderous at-
</p>
<p>tempts upon his life which he endured, and with which the peo-
</p>
<p>ple are familiar, there are, no doubt, many events and trials yet
</p>
<p>hidden from the world in the bosoms of his most familiar friends
</p>
<p>which may have caused him far greater agony than many of those
</p>
<p>with which the public are acquainted. Among these the following
</p>
<p>narrative may be classed, as it has never before been published,
</p>
<p>and the facts it contains may have had an important influence in
</p>
<p>hastening, if not really accomplishing, the death of the Prophet.
</p>
<p>Early in the spring of 1844 a very strong and bitter feeling
</p>
<p>was aroused against Joseph, among many of his brethren in and
</p>
<p>around Nauvoo; and some who held high positions in the Church
</p>
<p>and were supposed to be his best friends, turned against him and
</p>
<p>sought by various means in their power to do him injury. Many
</p>
<p>murmured and complained, and some of the more wicked even
</p>
<p>watched their opportunity to take his life, and were continually
</p>
<p>plotting to accomplish that end. At length this wicked feeling be-
</p>
<p>came so strong and general among a certain class, that it was re-
</p>
<p>solved to form an organization, or secret combination, that would
</p>
<p>better enable them to accomplish their wicked purposes.
</p>
<p>Accordingly a secret meeting was appointed to take place in
</p>
<p>the new brick house of William Law, Joseph's first counselor, on
</p>
<p>a certain Sabbath, and invitations to attend it were carefully ex-
</p>
<p>tended to members of the Church whom it was thought were dis-
</p>
<p>affected, or in sympathy with these wicked views and desires.
</p>
<p>Among those who received invitations to attend this meeting was

</p>
<p>Brother Dennison L. Harris, now the Bishop of Monroe, Sevier
</p>
<p>County, Utah, then but a young man of seventeen years of age.
</p>
<p>Austin A. Cowles, at that time a member of the High Council, was
</p>
<p>one of the leaders in this wicked movement, and being a near
</p>
<p>neighbor and on intimate terms with Brother Harris, he had given
</p>
<p>young Dennison an invitation to the secret meeting, and told him
</p>
<p>also to invite his father, but to be sure and not breathe a word
</p>
<p>about it to anyone else, as it was to be kept a profound secret.
</p>
<p>Dennison was much perplexed over the invitation he had received,
</p>
<p>and certain things that Brother Cowles had told him ; and while sit-
</p>
<p>ting on his father's woodpile, thinking them over and wondering
</p>
<p>what he had better do, another young man, named Robert Scott,
</p>
<p>who lived but a short distance away, came over, sat down on the
</p>
<p>log, and the two began to converse upon various subjects such as
</p>
<p>generally engage the conversation of young men of their age. It
</p>
<p>seems they had been intimate companions for several years; and
</p>
<p>they had not conversed long before each discovered that the other
</p>
<p>had something on his mind which troubled him, but which he
</p>
<p>did not like to reveal. Finally, one proposed that, as they had
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 85
</p>
<p>always been confidants, they now exchange secrets, on condition
</p>
<p>that neither should reveal what the other told him.
</p>
<p>Both readily agreed to this, and when each had told the cause
</p>
<p>of his anxiety, it proved to be the same  both had received an in-
</p>
<p>vitation to the same secret meeting. Robert Scott, having been
</p>
<p>reared by William Law, seemed to be almost a member of his family,
</p>
<p>and on this account had been invited by him to attend the meeting.
</p>
<p>"Well, Den," said Robert, after a short pause, "are you going
</p>
<p>to attend the meeting?"
</p>
<p>"I don't know," replied Dennison, "are you?"
</p>
<p>"I don't know whether to go or not," said Robert; "suppose
</p>
<p>we go in the house and tell your father of his invitation, and see
</p>
<p>what he says about it."
</p>
<p>They entered the house and consulted for some time with
</p>
<p>Dennison's father, Emer Harris, who was a brother of Martin
</p>
<p>Harris, one of the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon. They
</p>
<p>informed him of his invitation to the same meeting, and told him
</p>
<p>many other things that Brother Cowles had told Dennison. He de-
</p>
<p>cided to go at once and lay the whole matter before the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, who was then in Nauvoo, and ask his advice. He
</p>
<p>immediately went to Joseph's house, a distance of about two and
</p>
<p>a half miles, and informed him of the whole affair. Joseph listened
</p>
<p>with interest until he had finished, when he said : "Brother Harris,
</p>
<p>I would advise you not to attend those meetings, nor pay any at-
</p>
<p>tention to them. You may tell the boys, however, that I would like
</p>
<p>to have them go, but I want them to be sure to come and see me
</p>
<p>before the meeting takes place. I wish to give them some counsel."
</p>
<p>Subsequent events snowed the wisdom of Joseph in advising
</p>
<p>Brother Emer Harris not to attend the meeting, and selecting
</p>
<p>young men to do the work he wished to have accomplished. Brother
</p>
<p>Harris returned and told the boys what Joseph desired them to
</p>
<p>do, and they readily agreed to comply with his request. Accord-
</p>
<p>ingly, on the next Sunday before the secret meeting took place,

</p>
<p>Robert and Dennison called at the house of Joseph to learn what he
</p>
<p>wished them to do. He told them he desired that they should at-
</p>
<p>tend the meeting, pay strict attention, and report to him all their
</p>
<p>proceedings at the first favorable opportunity. He moreover cau-
</p>
<p>tioned them to have as little to say as possible, and to avoid giving
</p>
<p>any offense.
</p>
<p>They attended the meeting as desired. There were quite a
</p>
<p>number present, and the time was mostly occupied in planning
</p>
<p>how to get at things the best, and effect an organization. Strong
</p>
<p>speeches were also made against the Prophet, and many lies were
</p>
<p>told to prejudice the minds of those present against him. This
</p>
<p>portion of the proceedings was not a difficult task, for the element
</p>
<p>of which the audience was composed was only too susceptible to
</p>
<p>such evil impressions, and those who spoke were eminently suc-
</p>
<p>cessful in producing the desired impressions, and arousing the
</p>
<p>feelings of enmity toward the Prophet, that they might wish to use
</p>
<p>in accomplishing his overthrow. It seems that the immediate cause
</p>
<p>of these wicked proceedings was the fact that Joseph had recently
</p>
<p>presented the revelation on Celestial Marriage to the High Council
</p>
<p>86 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>for their approval, and certain members were most bitterly op-
</p>
<p>posed to it, and denounced Joseph as a fallen Prophet, and were
</p>
<p>determined to destroy him.
</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned to convene again on the following
</p>
<p>Sabbath, and the two young men were invited to attend the next
</p>
<p>one also, but were cautioned not to tell a soul of what had trans-
</p>
<p>pired at the first one. At the first suitable opportunity they called
</p>
<p>upon Joseph, related to him what had taken place, and gave him
</p>
<p>the names of those who had taken part in the proceedings. The
</p>
<p>leading members among the conspirators, for such they really were,
</p>
<p>were William and Wilson Law, Austin A. Cowles, Francis and
</p>
<p>Chauncey Higbee, Robert Foster and his brother, two Hicks broth-
</p>
<p>ers, and two merchants, Finche and Rollinson, who were enemies
</p>
<p>to the Church. After hearing their report and asking several ques-
</p>
<p>tions, which they answered to the best of their knowledge, Joseph
</p>
<p>said : "Boys, I would like you to accept their invitation and attend
</p>
<p>the second meeting. But come to me again next Sunday, before
</p>
<p>their meeting convenes, as I may have something more to say to
</p>
<p>you before you go.''
</p>
<p>At the expiration of a week they again went to see Joseph,
</p>
<p>who gave them the necessary advice, after which they went to the
</p>
<p>meeting. This time the conspirators were still more vehement in
</p>
<p>their abusive remarks about Joseph. New crimes that he had
</p>
<p>committed had been discovered, and the old ones were much mag-
</p>
<p>nified. Their accusations were not only against him, but against
</p>
<p>his brother Hyrum and other prominent men in Nauvoo. There
</p>
<p>seemed to be no end to the wickedness of which these good men
</p>
<p>were accused, as most of the time, until a late hour, was occupied
</p>
<p>by different ones in denouncing and accusing Joseph and his friends
</p>
<p>of the most heinous crimes. Before the meeting adjourned, how-
</p>
<p>ever, it was agreed that they should all endeavor to work the mat-
</p>
<p>ter up as much as possible during the week, that something definite
</p>
<p>might be accomplished towards effecting a more complete organ-

</p>
<p>ization without further delay. The meeting was to convene again
</p>
<p>on the following Sunday. As the boys had kept quiet and said noth-
</p>
<p>ing against any of their proceedings, it was supposed, of course,
</p>
<p>that they were in sympathy with the movement, and an invitation
</p>
<p>was accordingly extended for them to attend the next meeting.
</p>
<p>As on the previous occasion, the young men watched a fit-
</p>
<p>ting opportunity of reporting to Joseph without arousing the
</p>
<p>suspicions of any that attended the meeting. He listened atten-
</p>
<p>tively to the recital of all that had taken place at the second meet-
</p>
<p>ing, after which he said : "Boys, come to me again next Sunday. I
</p>
<p>wish you to attend the next meeting also." The boys promised to
</p>
<p>do so, and left the room. They kept the meetings and their con-
</p>
<p>nection with them, however, a profound secret from the rest of
</p>
<p>their friends, and at the appointed time again went to the house
</p>
<p>of Joseph to receive their usual instructions. This time he said to
</p>
<p>them, with a very serious countenance: 'This will be your last
</p>
<p>meeting; this will be the last time that they will admit you into
</p>
<p>their councils. They will come to some determination. But be
</p>
<p>sure," he continued, "that you make no covenants, nor enter into
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 87
</p>
<p>any obligations whatever with them. Be strictly reserved, and
</p>
<p>make no promise either to conspire against me or any portion of
</p>
<p>the community. Be silent, and do not take any part in their de-
</p>
<p>liberations." After a pause of some moments, he added: "Boys,
</p>
<p>this will be their last meeting, and they may shed your blood, but
</p>
<p>I hardly think they will, as you are so young. If they do, I will be
</p>
<p>a lion in their path ! Don't flinch. If you have to die ; die like men ;
</p>
<p>you will be martyrs to the cause, and your crowns can be no great-
</p>
<p>er. But," said he again, "I hardly think they will shed your blood."
</p>
<p>This interview was a long one. Joseph's sensitive feelings
</p>
<p>were touched by the faith, generosity and love manifested by these
</p>
<p>young men in their willingness to undertake such a hazardous
</p>
<p>enterprise at his bidding. He blessed them and made them pre-
</p>
<p>cious promises for their sacrifice, and told them if their lives were
</p>
<p>taken their reward would be all the greater. After leaving Jo-
</p>
<p>seph's house with his sincere wishes for their safety, the boys
</p>
<p>waited anxiously for the time of meeting to arrive. They fully
</p>
<p>realized the dangers into which they were about to plunge them-
</p>
<p>selves, yet they did not shrink. They knew it was their duty, and
</p>
<p>they determined to attempt it at all hazards. They were now
</p>
<p>familiar with the names of the persons conspiring against Joseph,
</p>
<p>the object they had in view, and many of their plans for accom-
</p>
<p>plishing that object. Moreover, they were supposed by the would-
</p>
<p>be murderers to be in perfect sympathy with all their hellish de-
</p>
<p>signs ; and if, by any circumstance, they should arouse the suspicion
</p>
<p>that they were present at Joseph's request, or even with his knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, their lives in such a crowd would, indeed, be of little value.
</p>
<p>They determined to trust in the Lord and die rather than betray
</p>
<p>the Priesthood. Their feelings may perhaps be imagined as the
</p>
<p>time of meeting drew near, and they started off in the direction
</p>
<p>of William Law's house, where it was to be held. They certainly
</p>
<p>displayed faith that every young man in Israel should cultivate.
</p>
<p>On arriving at the rendezvous they found, to their surprise

<p>and discomfiture, that the entrance to the house was guarded by
</p>
<p>men armed with muskets and bayonets. After being scrutinized
</p>
<p>from head to foot, and carefully cross-questioned, they succeeded
</p>
<p>in passing the guards and gaining admittance. From this it will
</p>
<p>be seen that great care was taken to prevent any person from
</p>
<p>entering, except those whom they knew to be of their party, and
</p>
<p>ready to adopt any measures that might be suggested against the
</p>
<p>Prophet Joseph. On entering they found considerable confusion
</p>
<p>and much counseling among the members of the conspiracy. All
</p>
<p>seemed determined that Joseph should die, yet objections were
</p>
<p>raised by some to each of the plans proposed.
</p>
<p>The Prophet was accused of the most wicked acts, and all
</p>
<p>manner of evil was spoken of him. Some declared that he had
</p>
<p>sought to get their wives away from them, and had many times
</p>
<p>committed adultery. They said he was a fallen Prophet, and was
</p>
<p>leading the people to destruction. Joseph was not the only one
</p>
<p>against whom they lied. His brother Hyrum and many of the lead-
</p>
<p>ing men in Nauvoo were accused of being in league with him and
</p>
<p>88 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>sharing his crimes. In these councilings and plannings, consider-
</p>
<p>able time was spent before the meeting was called to order, and
</p>
<p>anything definite commenced. The boys, however, followed Jo-
</p>
<p>seph's instructions, and remained quiet and reserved. This seemed
</p>
<p>to arouse the suspicions of some that they were not earnestly in
</p>
<p>favor of their wicked purposes, and some of the conspirators began
</p>
<p>to take especial pains to explain to the young men the great crimes
</p>
<p>that Joseph had committed, and the results that would follow if his
</p>
<p>wicked career were not checked, with a view to convincing them
</p>
<p>that their severe measures against Joseph were for the best good
</p>
<p>of the Church, and persuading them to take an active part with
</p>
<p>them in accomplishing this great good. The two boys, however,
</p>
<p>sat together quietly, and would simply answer their arguments
</p>
<p>by saying that they were only young boys, and did not understand
</p>
<p>such things, and would rather not take part in their proceedings.
</p>
<p>As before stated, Brother Scott had been reared in the family
</p>
<p>of William Law, and the latter pretended great friendship for him
</p>
<p>on that account, and was very anxious to explain to him the object
</p>
<p>of the proposed organization, and induce him to join. He would
</p>
<p>come around and sit beside Robert, put his arm around his neck,
</p>
<p>and persuade, argue, and implore him to join in their effort to rid
</p>
<p>the Church of such a dangerous impostor. At the same time Broth-
</p>
<p>er Cowles would sit beside Brother Harris in the same attitude,
</p>
<p>and labor with him with equal earnestness. The boys, however,
</p>
<p>were not easily convinced. Still, in their replies and remarks, they
</p>
<p>carefully tried to avoid giving the least offense or arousing any
</p>
<p>suspicions regarding the true cause of their presence. They said
</p>
<p>they were too young to understand the "spiritual wife doctrine,"
</p>
<p>of which Joseph was accused, and many of the other things that
</p>
<p>they condemned in the Prophet. Joseph had never done them any
</p>
<p>harm, and they did not like to join in a conspiracy against his life.
</p>
<p>"But," they would urge, "Joseph is a fallen Prophet; he receives
</p>
<p>revelations from the devil, and is deceiving the people, and if some-

</p>
<p>thing decisive is not done at once to get rid of him, the whole
</p>
<p>Church will be led by him to destruction." These and many other
</p>
<p>arguments were vainly brought forth to induce the boys to join
</p>
<p>them, but they still pretended not to understand nor take much in-
</p>
<p>terest in such things. At length they ceased their persuasions, and,
</p>
<p>things having developed sufficiently, they concluded to proceed
</p>
<p>with the intended organization.
</p>
<p>An oath had been prepared which each member of the organ-
</p>
<p>ization was now required to take. Francis Higbee, a justice of the
</p>
<p>peace, sat at a table in one end of the room, and administered the
</p>
<p>oath to each individual separately, in the following manner : The
</p>
<p>candidate would step forward to the table, take up a Bible, which
</p>
<p>had been provided for the purpose, and raise it in his right hand,
</p>
<p>whereupon the justice would ask him in a solemn tone, "Are you
</p>
<p>ready?" And, receiving answer in the affirmative, would continue
</p>
<p>in a tone and manner that struck awe to the minds of the boys as
</p>
<p>they listened : "You solemnly swear, before God and all holy angels,
</p>
<p>and these your brethren by whom you are surrounded, that you will
</p>
<p>give your life, your liberty, your influence, your all, for the destruc-
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 89
</p>
<p>tion of Joseph Smith and his party, so help you God!" The person
</p>
<p>being sworn would then say, "I do," after which he would lay down
</p>
<p>the Bible and sign his name to a written copy of the oath in a book
</p>
<p>that was lying on the table, and it would be legally acknowledged
</p>
<p>by the justice of the peace.
</p>
<p>The boys sat gazing upon this scene, wondering how intelligent
</p>
<p>beings who had once enjoyed the light of truth could have fallen
</p>
<p>into such depths of wickedness as to be anxious to take such an
</p>
<p>oath against the Prophet of God and his faithful followers. They
</p>
<p>also felt no little uneasiness concerning their own fate, and almost
</p>
<p>dreaded the moment when the last one should have taken the oath.
</p>
<p>At length that portion of the business ivas accomplished, and about
</p>
<p>two hundred persons had taken the oath. Among that number were
</p>
<p>three women, who were ushered in, closely veiled to prevent being
</p>
<p>recognized, and required to take the same oath. Besides doing
</p>
<p>this, they also testified that Joseph and Hyrum Smith had endeav-
</p>
<p>ored to seduce them ; had made the most indecent and wicked pro-
</p>
<p>posals to them, and wished them to become their wives. After
</p>
<p>making affidavit to a series of lies of this kind, they made their
</p>
<p>exit through a back door. One of the women, whom the boys sus-
</p>
<p>pected as being William Law's wife, was crying, and seemed to
</p>
<p>dislike taking the oath, but did so as one who feared that the great-
</p>
<p>est bodily injury would surely follow a refusal.
</p>
<p>After the oath had been administered to all but the two boys,
</p>
<p>Law, Cowles and others again commenced their labors to get them
</p>
<p>to take it, but met the same success as before. Arguments, per-
</p>
<p>suasions and threats were in turn used to accomplish their desire,
</p>
<p>but in vain. They exhausted their ingenuity in inventing argu-
</p>
<p>ments, lies and inducements to get the boys to unite with their band.
</p>
<p>"Have you not heard," they said, "the strong testimony of all pres-
</p>
<p>ent against Joseph Smith ? Can a man be a true Prophet who would
</p>
<p>commit adultery? He is a fallen Prophet, and is teaching the peo-
</p>
<p>ple doctrines that his own imagination or lustful desires have in-

<p>vented, or else he received that revelation from the devil. He will
</p>
<p>surely lead the whole Church to destruction if his career is not
</p>
<p>stopped. We can do nothing with him by the law, and for the sake
</p>
<p>of the Church ive deem it our solemn duty to accomplish his destruc-
</p>
<p>tion and rescue the people from this peril. We are simply combin-
</p>
<p>ing and conspiring to save the Church, and we wish you to join us in
</p>
<p>our efforts, and share the honors that will be ours. Come, take
</p>
<p>the oath, and all will be well."
</p>
<p>"Oh, we are too young," they replied, "to understand or
</p>
<p>meddle with such things, and would rather let others who are
</p>
<p>older and know more do such work. We came to your meetings
</p>
<p>because we thought you were our friends and gave us a kind invita-
</p>
<p>tion. We did not think there was any harm in it; but if you will
</p>
<p>allow us to go now, we will not trouble any more of your meetings.
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith has never done us any harm, and we do not feel
</p>
<p>like injuring him."
</p>
<p>"Come, boys," said another of the crowd, "do as we have
</p>
<p>done. You are young and will not have anything to do in the affair ;
</p>
<p>90 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>but we want you should keep it a secret, and act with us ; that's
</p>
<p>all."
</p>
<p>"No," replied the boys in a firm but cool tone, as they rose
</p>
<p>to leave, "we cannot take an oath like that against any man who
</p>
<p>has never done us the least injury." They would gladly have
</p>
<p>passed out and escaped the trouble they saw brewing for them;
</p>
<p>but, as they feared, they were not allowed to depart so easily.
</p>
<p>One of the band exclaimed in a very determined voice : "No, not by
</p>
<p>a d d sight! You know all our plans and arrangements, and
</p>
<p>we don't propose that you should leave in that style. You've got
</p>
<p>to take that oath, or you'll never leave here alive."
</p>
<p>The attention of all was now directed to the two boys, and
</p>
<p>considerable confusion prevailed. A voice shouted, "Dead men
</p>
<p>tell no tales!" whereupon a general clamor arose for the boys to
</p>
<p>take the oath or be killed. Even their pretended friends, Cowles
</p>
<p>and Law, turned against them. "If you do not take that oath," said
</p>
<p>one of the leading members, in a blood curdling tone, "we will
</p>
<p>cut your throats." The looks and conduct of the rest showed
</p>
<p>plainly that he had spoken only what they were ready to execute.
</p>
<p>It was evident the mob was eager for blood. That moment cer-
</p>
<p>tainly must have been a trying one, but it seemed that fear had
</p>
<p>suddenly vanished from the bosoms of the two boys, and they
</p>
<p>coolly but positively again declared that they would not take that
</p>
<p>oath, nor enter into any other movement against the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph.
</p>
<p>The mob was now enraged, as they thought they were betrayed,
</p>
<p>and it was with the greatest difficulty that the leaders succeeded
</p>
<p>in keeping them from falling upon the boys and cutting them to
</p>
<p>pieces. The leaders, however, were no less determined that the
</p>
<p>boys should die; but as the house in which the meeting was held
</p>
<p>stood but a short distance back from the street, they thought it
</p>
<p>better to be more quiet about it, lest some one might be passing
</p>
<p>and discover what was going on. Order was at last restored, when

</p>
<p>it was decided to take the boys down the cellar, where the deed
</p>
<p>could be more safely accomplished. Accordingly, a guard, with
</p>
<p>drawn swords and bowie knives, was placed on either side of the
</p>
<p>boys, while two others, armed with cocked muskets and bayonets,
</p>
<p>at their backs, brought up the rear as they were marched off in
</p>
<p>the direction of the cellar. William and Wilson Law, Austin Cowles,
</p>
<p>and others, accompanied them to the cellar. Before committing
</p>
<p>the murderous deed, however, they gave the boys one more chance
</p>
<p>for their lives. One of them said : "Boys, if you will take that
</p>
<p>oath your lives shall be spared ; but you know too much for us to
</p>
<p>allow you to go free, and if you are still determined to refuse, we
</p>
<p>will have to shed your blood." But the boys, with most com-
</p>
<p>mendable courage, in the very jaws of death, once more rejected
</p>
<p>the only means that would save their lives.
</p>
<p>At this juncture, when it seemed that each moment would
</p>
<p>end the earthly existence of these two noble young men, a voice
</p>
<p>from some one in the crowd, as if by Divine interposition, called
</p>
<p>out just in time to save their lives: "Hold on! Hold on there! Let's
</p>
<p>talk this matter over before their blood is shed!" and with great

<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 91
</p>
<p>difficulty some of the more cautious ones succeeded in quieting
</p>
<p>those whose anger and excitement prevented them from weighing
</p>
<p>well what they were on the verge of committing, and considering
</p>
<p>the consequences that would inevitably follow. Thus the in-
</p>
<p>stantaneous death of the boys was prevented, while the crowd
</p>
<p>retired to the farther end of the room and consulted earnestly
</p>
<p>together, in so low a tone, however, that the boys could not hear
</p>
<p>what they said. It was evident, however, that they were nearly
</p>
<p>equally divided in their views of the feasibility of putting the
</p>
<p>boys to death. Some appeared to be enraged and fully determined
</p>
<p>to shed their blood, while others were equally resolved to prevent
</p>
<p>the cruel deed. During the discussion the boys distinctly heard
</p>
<p>one of them say : 'The boys' parents very likely know where they
</p>
<p>are, and if they do not return home, strong suspicions will be
</p>
<p>aroused, and they may institute a search that would be very
</p>
<p>dangerous to us. It is already late, and time that the boys were
</p>
<p>home."
</p>
<p>This was a very important consideration, as well as a very
</p>
<p>unexpected circumstance in favor of the boys. Hope rose high
</p>
<p>in their breasts as the discussion continued, and one by one of
</p>
<p>the more excited conspirators was silenced, if not convinced, until
</p>
<p>at length the tide turned in favor of the boys, and it was decided
</p>
<p>that they should be released. Some openly, and many in their
</p>
<p>feelings, opposed this resolution, as they considered it as unsafe
</p>
<p>to liberate the boys to reveal all their plans, as to kill them and
</p>
<p>get them out of the way.
</p>
<p>A strong guard was provided to escort them to a proper dis-
</p>
<p>tance, lest some of the gang might kill them before they made
</p>
<p>their escape. They placed a strict injunction upon the boys not
</p>
<p>to reveal anything they had seen or heard in these meetings, and
</p>
<p>declared if they did, any member of the conspiracy would kill
</p>
<p>them at first sight. This caution and threat were repeated several
</p>
<p>times in a way that gave the boys to understand that they meant

</p>
<p>all they said, and would just as leave slay them as not if they
</p>
<p>suspected anything had been revealed by them.
</p>
<p>Everything being ready, the boys started off in charge of the
</p>
<p>guard. Right glad were they to once more gain the open air with
</p>
<p>so good a prospect for their lives, and they breathed a sigh of relief
</p>
<p>and satisfaction when they were out of sight of the house in which
</p>
<p>they had endured such great peril. They took an unfrequented
</p>
<p>road down toward the Mississippi River, which runs around one
</p>
<p>side of Nauvoo. Some of the guard were very much dissatisfied
</p>
<p>with the way the tables had turned, and, when they had got a safe
</p>
<p>distance from the house, they halted to consider if it would not be
</p>
<p>best to slay the boys on their own responsibility. They would gladly
</p>
<p>have murdered them if they could have done so with any hopes of
</p>
<p>having the deed remain undiscovered; but, after some discussion,
</p>
<p>they contented themselves by reiterating the cautions and threats
</p>
<p>that had been given to the boys before starting. They continued
</p>
<p>their march until within a few rods of the river, when they halted,
</p>
<p>and one of the guards said:
</p>
<p>"Well, I guess we have gone about far enough, and had bet-
</p>
<p>92 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>ter turn back." Then turning to the boys, he continued, "Boys,
</p>
<p>if you ever open your mouths concerning anything you have seen
</p>
<p>or heard in any of our meetings, we will kill you by night or by
</p>
<p>day, wherever we find you, and consider it our duty."
</p>
<p>"Oh, don't fear on that account," replied the boys, anxious
</p>
<p>to allay their uneasiness, lest they still might take a notion to slay
</p>
<p>them and cast their bodies into the river, "we can see that it is
</p>
<p>greatly to our advantage and necessary to our peace and safety
</p>
<p>to keep silent concerning these things."
</p>
<p>"I'm glad you've got sense enough to see it in that light," was
</p>
<p>the rejoinder, in a tone that indicated his mind was somewhat
</p>
<p>relieved.
</p>
<p>During this conversation, one of the boys looking towards
</p>
<p>the river, to his great surprise, saw a hand rise into view from
</p>
<p>behind the bank and beckon for them to come that way. The guards,
</p>
<p>after admonishing them once more to be silent, and telling them
</p>
<p>their lives depended upon their keeping the secret, turned to re-
</p>
<p>trace their steps just as one of the boys, anxious to put them at
</p>
<p>ease as much as possible, said to his companion: "Let's go down
</p>
<p>to the river."
</p>
<p>"Yes," returned the guard, evidently pleased with the ar-
</p>
<p>rangement; "you had better go down to the river."
</p>
<p>The reader will readily understand that the meeting had
</p>
<p>lasted until a late hour in the afternoon, and the conspirators had
</p>
<p>already detained the boys so long, that they were afraid their
</p>
<p>parents and friends, some of whom perhaps knew where the boys
</p>
<p>had gone, would become anxious and begin to suspect foul play,
</p>
<p>and possibly might institute a search which would prove exceed-
</p>
<p>ingly disadvantageous to the conspiracy. The boys, therefore, very
</p>
<p>adroitly proposed to go to the river, so if they were found there
</p>
<p>it would be sufficient explanation for their long absence. The
</p>
<p>guards perceived the idea instantly, and it pleased them, for it
</p>
<p>indicated to them that the boys wished to keep the secret, and

</p>
<p>avoid being questioned too closely.
</p>
<p>The boys started off on a run toward the river, but, lest the
</p>
<p>guards should watch them, and discover the presence of Joseph,
</p>
<p>whose hand it was they had seen above the bank, they directed
</p>
<p>their course to a point about a quarter of a mile beyond where
</p>
<p>Joseph was, knowing that he would follow them. On reaching the
</p>
<p>river, they stepped down the bank, and there awaited the arrival
</p>
<p>of the Prophet, while the guards returned to the meeting.
</p>
<p>It seems that Joseph, knowing the danger into which the
</p>
<p>boys had gone, had become so uneasy at their long absence, that
</p>
<p>he could no longer remain at home, so he and one of his body
</p>
<p>guard, John Scott, who was the brother to Robert, started out to
</p>
<p>see if they could discover what had become of them. Perhaps they
</p>
<p>suspected the boys had been murdered, and that their bodies
</p>
<p>would be thrown into the stream, as William Law's house, where
</p>
<p>the meeting was held, was but a short distance from the river. At
</p>
<p>all events, they were there under the bank when the boys were
</p>
<p>liberated, and now glided around close to the water's edge to the
</p>
<p>point where the boys were awaiting them.
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 93
</p>
<p>It was a joyful meeting; Joseph seemed delighted to see that
</p>
<p>the boys had escaped with their lives. The party walked on to a
</p>
<p>point nearly opposite Joseph's store, where a board fence came
</p>
<p>down to the edge of the river, forming, together with the orchard
</p>
<p>trees and shrubbery, a suitable retreat where they could converse
</p>
<p>without any danger of being seen or heard.
</p>
<p>"Let us sit down here," said Joseph. All four of them en-
</p>
<p>tered the secluded retreat, and, when they were seated, he con-
</p>
<p>tinued : "Boys, we saw your danger and were afraid you would not
</p>
<p>get out alive, but we are thankful that you got off safely. Now
</p>
<p>relate to me all that you have witnessed."
</p>
<p>The boys then gave him a complete account of all they had
</p>
<p>witnessed and passed through; repeated to him the oath they had
</p>
<p>seen and heard administered to some two hundred individuals
</p>
<p>separately; gave him the names of all they knew that had taken
</p>
<p>the oath; in short, they gave him a most accurate recital of all
</p>
<p>they had seen and heard.
</p>
<p>Joseph and his companion listened very attentively, and, as
</p>
<p>the boys proceeded, a very grave expression crept over the counte-
</p>
<p>nance of the former, showing that a deep anxiety was preying upon
</p>
<p>his mind. When the recital was finished, a pause of some length
</p>
<p>ensued. Joseph was very much moved, and at length burst out:
</p>
<p>"0, brethren, you do not know what this will terminate in !" But
</p>
<p>proceeded no further, for his feelings were so strong that he burst
</p>
<p>into tears.
</p>
<p>In great agitation, Brother John Scott, who was an intimate
</p>
<p>and trusted friend of Joseph, sprang forward, and throwing his
</p>
<p>arms around the Prophet's neck, exclaimed: "0, Brother Joseph!
</p>
<p>do you think they are going to kill you?" and they fell on each
</p>
<p>others' necks and wept bitterly. The scene is difficult to describe.
</p>
<p>The thought of losing their friend and Prophet by the hands of
</p>
<p>such a bloodthirsty mob was sufficient to wring their hearts ; and
</p>
<p>those brave men who, but a few moments before, had fearlessly

</p>
<p>faced death, and scorned the proffered conditions on which their
</p>
<p>lives might be spared, now wept like children, and mingled their
</p>
<p>tears with those of their leader.
</p>
<p>Joseph was the first to master his feelings, and, raising
</p>
<p>Brother Scott's arms from off his neck, he said, in a deep and
</p>
<p>sorrowful tone: "I fully comprehend it!" He then relaxed into a
</p>
<p>solemn study, while his brethren anxiously watched the changes
</p>
<p>of his countenance as if they would read the thoughts and feelings
</p>
<p>that were preying upon his heart. The scene was painful and im-
</p>
<p>pressive. Each moment they expected to hear him say that his
</p>
<p>work on earth was done, and that he would have to be slain to seal
</p>
<p>his testimony.
</p>
<p>After a long silence he finally continued: "Brethren, I am
</p>
<p>going to leave you. I shall not be with you long; it will not be
</p>
<p>many months until I shall have to go."
</p>
<p>This remark still left them in doubt as to his future fate, but
</p>
<p>had such significance that Brother Scott again anxiously inquired :
</p>
<p>"Brother Joseph, are you going to be slain?"
</p>
<p>Joseph, for some reason, evaded a direct reply, but continued
</p>
<p>94 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>in a tone that told too plainly of the sorrow he felt: "I am going
</p>
<p>away, and will not be known among this people for twenty years
</p>
<p>or more. I shall go to rest for a season."
</p>
<p>This reply did not clear away their doubts any more than
</p>
<p>the former one, but it was evident he intended to leave the people
</p>
<p>and keep hid more closely than he ever had done, or else, with
</p>
<p>prophetic vision, he discerned the final outcome of his enemies'
</p>
<p>efforts, and, through compassion, forebore to crush the spirits of
</p>
<p>his brethren by telling them plainly the whole truth.
</p>
<p>Subsequent events leave us still in doubt as to the real pur-
</p>
<p>port of his words. The dark clouds of persecution from enemies
</p>
<p>without, fearfully augmented by traitors from within, grew so
</p>
<p>threatening toward the close of the Prophet's life, that he saw
</p>
<p>something must be done for the safety of himself and the people.
</p>
<p>He therefore conceived the idea of moving the Saints once more,
</p>
<p>and this time far beyond the cruel blasts of persecution, and seek
</p>
<p>shelter behind the barriers of the Rocky Mountains. He called for
</p>
<p>a company of volunteers to explore the great West, and find the
</p>
<p>most suitable place for the Saints to settle. Quite a number vol-
</p>
<p>unteered and began to make preparations for the journey.
</p>
<p>It is a well known fact that just previous to surrendering him-
</p>
<p>self to be taken to Carthage, Joseph got into a boat and started
</p>
<p>across the river, evidently to evade his enemies. He intended
</p>
<p>to keep out of their hands until this company had procured a suit-
</p>
<p>able outfit for such an undertaking, when he would have accom-
</p>
<p>panied them. Some of his brethren, however, begged him not to
</p>
<p>desert the people in such a time of trouble and danger, and at their
</p>
<p>importunity he returned to Nauvoo, and we all know the result.
</p>
<p>He was induced to surrender himself to the officers of the law, was
</p>
<p>cast into prison, and there cruelly murdered by a bloodthirsty mob.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, in reply to Brother Scott's question, Joseph was
</p>
<p>revolving these plans in his mind, and looking forward to the time
</p>
<p>when he and the Saints would be beyond the reach of persecution ;

</p>
<p>it is now impossible to tell, but the events which followed rather
</p>
<p>indicate that he foresaw his death. However, he continued in
</p>
<p>great earnestness :
</p>
<p>"They accuse me of polygamy, and of being a false Prophet,
</p>
<p>and many other tilings which I do not now remember; but I am
</p>
<p>no false Prophet; I am no impostor; I have had no dark revelations;
</p>
<p>I have had no revelations from the devil; I made no revelations; I
</p>
<p>have got nothing up myself. The same God that has thus far
</p>
<p>dictated, me and directed me and strengthened me in this work, gave
</p>
<p>me this revelation- and commandment on celestial and plural mar-
</p>
<p>riage, and the same God commanded me to obey it. He said to
</p>
<p>me that unless I accepted it and introduced it, and practiced it, I,
</p>
<p>together with my people, would be damned and cut off from this
</p>
<p>time henceforth. And they say if I do so, they will kill me. 0, what
</p>
<p>shall I do? If I do not practice it I shall be damned witJi my people.
</p>
<p>If I do teach it, and practice it, and, urge it, they say they will kill
</p>
<p>me, and I know they will. But," said he, "ice have got to observe
</p>
<p>it. It is an eternal principle, and was given by way of command-
</p>
<p>ment and not by way of instruction."
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 95
</p>
<p>It will be seen from these outbursts of his soul what a con-
</p>
<p>flict was going on in his mind, and the agony that he endured can
</p>
<p>only be imagined by those who knew his sensitive and generous
</p>
<p>spirit. Persecution and imprisonment from the hand of an enemy
</p>
<p>would be passed by almost unnoticed when compared with these
</p>
<p>murderous thrusts from the daggers of alienated friends. Death,
</p>
<p>to a man who was so familiar with the unseen world and the
</p>
<p>happiness to be enjoyed there, was stripped of its terrors. His
</p>
<p>fear of simply losing his life caused him little anxiety. But his
</p>
<p>whole soul was in the work which the Lord had given him to do,
</p>
<p>and such bloodthirsty opposition to a commandment of God among
</p>
<p>his brethren caused the greatest anxiety and grief. His greatest
</p>
<p>trials are, no doubt, hid deepest from our view.
</p>
<p>The consultation lasted for a long time before they separated
</p>
<p>to their homes, and impressions were made on the minds of our
</p>
<p>two young heroes that will last forever. They got an insight into
</p>
<p>the life of the Prophet and the nature of the work he had to per-
</p>
<p>form, that had never before entered their imaginations. Their
</p>
<p>love for him and the cause in which he was laboring was increased,
</p>
<p>and gladly would they have laid down their lives to have saved his.
</p>
<p>Before separating, however, Joseph placed a seal upon the
</p>
<p>boys' lips, and made them promise that they would not reveal
</p>
<p>what had transpired that day to a living soul  not even to their
</p>
<p>own fathers, for at least twenty years. The object of placing this
</p>
<p>injunction upon them no doubt was for their own safety, as their
</p>
<p>lives would probably have been taken if any of the conspirators
</p>
<p>should ever find out that any of their proceedings had been revealed.
</p>
<p>The boys kept their promise, and now, after a lapse of so many
</p>
<p>years, these important facts, which throw light upon many of the
</p>
<p>acts and sayings of Joseph Smith, which his brethren could never
</p>
<p>before fully understand, are revealed and placed with other im-
</p>
<p>portant records in the archives of the Church.

<p>Great Salt Lake County, Alfred Randall, who deposes and says,
</p>
<p>that about ten o'clock on the morning of the (26th) twenty-sixth
</p>
<p>day of June, one thousand eight hundred and forty-four, he was in
</p>
<p>Carthage, Hancock county, Illinois, and as the troops, under Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Thomas Ford, were in squads around the square, he went
</p>
<p>up to several of them, and heard one of the soldiers say: "When
</p>
<p>I left home I calculated to see old Joe dead before I returned. "
</p>
<p>when several others said, "So did I," "So did I," and "I'll be damned
</p>
<p>if I don't/' was the general reply.
</p>
<p>One fellow then spoke up and said "I shouldn't wonder if there
</p>
<p>is some damned Mormon hearing all we have to say." Another who
</p>
<p>stood next to Randall, replied, "If I knew there was, I would run
</p>
<p>him through with my bayonet."
</p>
<p>In a few minutes Randall went to another crowd of soldiers,
</p>
<p>and heard one say, "I guess this will be the last of old Joe." From
</p>
<p>there Randall went to Hamilton's Hotel, where Governor Thomas
</p>
<p>Ford was standing by the fence side, and heard another soldier tell
</p>
<p>Governor Thomas Ford, "The soldiers are determined to see Joe
</p>
<p>Smith dead before they leave here." Ford replied, "If you know
</p>
<p>of any such thing keep it to yourself."
</p>
<p>In a short time Randall started for his own home, stayed all
</p>
<p>night, and arrived in Nauvoo on the twenty-seventh of June, when

<p>Governor Ford was making his notorious speech to the citizens.

<p>in council upon the subject of the arrest and trial of Joseph and
</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith, who were then prisoners in the county jail in
</p>
<p>Carthage.
</p>
<p>After considerable conversation between myself and them on
</p>
<p>the subject of the Mormon religion, and the reasons why I had
</p>
<p>embraced that faith, and renounced my former religious discipline
</p>
<p> viz. that of the Methodists, Mr. March asked me what I thought
</p>
<p>of Joe Smith, and if I had any hopes of his return to Nauvoo in
</p>
<p>safety.
</p>
<p>I answered that I knew Joseph Smith was a true Prophet of
</p>
<p>the living God, as good and virtuous a man as ever lived upon the
</p>
<p>earth; that the Book of Mormon was true as holy writ, and was
</p>
<p>brought forth precisely in the way and manner it purported to be,
</p>
<p>by the gift and power of the Lord Almighty, and from no other
</p>
<p>source; and that the revelations he had received and published
</p>
<p>were eternal truth, and heaven and earth would pass away before
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 97
</p>
<p>one jot or tittle of the same should fail, and all that he pretended
</p>
<p>and testified to concerning the ministration of holy angels from
</p>
<p>the heavens to him, the Urim and Thummim, the voice of God, his
</p>
<p>correspondence with the heavens, was the truth and nothing but
</p>
<p>the truth; and that in relation to his return I had no doubt but
</p>
<p>that he would be honorably discharged upon his trial by the court,
</p>
<p>and would be preserved in safety from the power of his enemies;
</p>
<p>that he was in the hands of his God, whom he loved and faithfully
</p>
<p>served ; and He, who held the destinies of nations in His own hands,
</p>
<p>would deliver him from his enemies, as He had done hundreds of
</p>
<p>times before.
</p>
<p>Col. March replied, "Mr. Wright, you are mistaken, and I know
</p>
<p>it ; you do not know what I know ; I tell you they will kill Joe Smith
</p>
<p>before he leaves Carthage, and I know it, and you never will see him
</p>
<p>alive again." Said I, "Enoch, I do not believe it, he is in the hands
</p>
<p>of God, and God will deliver him." Says he, "I know better; when
</p>
<p>you hear of him again, you will hear he is dead, and I know it. The
</p>
<p>people at Carthage wanted permission from the Governor to kill
</p>
<p>you all and burn up your city, and Ford (the Governor) asked me
</p>
<p>if I thought it was best to suffer it. I replied, 'No, no, for God's
</p>
<p>sake, Ford, don't suffer it, that will never do, no never. Just see
</p>
<p>for a moment, Ford, what that would do; it would be the means
</p>
<p>of murdering thousands of innocent men, women and children, and
</p>
<p>destroying thousands of dollars' worth of property, and that would
</p>
<p>never do, it would not be sanctioned, it would disgrace the nation.
</p>
<p>You have now got the principal men here under your own con-
</p>
<p>trol, they are all you want, what more do you want? When they
</p>
<p>are out of the way the thing is settled, and the people will be
</p>
<p>satisfied, and that is the easiest way you can dispose of it'; and
</p>
<p>Governor Ford concluded upon the whole that was the best policy,
</p>
<p>and I know it will be done."

</p>
<p>that about the hour of 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the 27th day
</p>
<p>of June, one thousand eight hundred forty-four, a short time only
</p>
<p>before Governor Ford addressed the citizens of Nauvoo, he (Ford)
</p>
<p>and his suit occupied an upper room in the mansion of Joseph Smith,
</p>
<p>in the city of Nauvoo, when he, the said Rockwell, had of necessity
</p>
<p>to enter said upper room for his hat, and as he entered the door t
</p>
<p>all were sitting silent except one man, who was standing behind
</p>
<p>a chair making a speech, and while in the act of dropping his right
</p>
<p>hand from an uplifted position, said. 'The deed is done before this
</p>
<p>time/' which were the only words I heard while in the room, for
</p>
<p>on seeing me they all hushed in silence. At that time I could not
</p>
<p>comprehend the meaning of the words, but in a few hours after I

<p>understood them as referring to the murder of Joseph and Hyrum

</p>
<p>the afternoon the said Governor Thomas Ford and his guard visited
</p>
<p>the Temple and the workshops on the Temple block.
</p>
<p>Mr. Alpheus Cutler, one of the building committee of the
</p>
<p>Temple, sent me to watch them in and about the Temple. I was
</p>
<p>close to the Governor when one of his men called him to look at one
</p>
<p>of the oxen of the font in the basement of the Temple, that had
</p>
<p>part of one horn broken off. The Governor stepped up to it, and
</p>
<p>laying his hand on it remarked. "This is the cow with the crumply
</p>
<p>horn, that we read of." One of the staff continued, "That tossed
</p>
<p>the maiden all forlorn," and they all had a laugh about it.
</p>
<p>Several of the horns were broken off the oxen by the Governor's
</p>
<p>attendants. A man who stood behind me said, "I'll be damned but
</p>
<p>I should like to take one of those horns home with me, to show as a
</p>
<p>curiosity, but it is a pity to break them off."
</p>
<p>After they had passed round the font, one of them remarked,
</p>
<p>"This temple is a curious piece of workmanship, and it was a
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 99
</p>
<p>damned shame that they did not let Joe Smith finish it, so that we
</p>
<p>could have seen what sort of a finish he would have put on it, for
</p>
<p>it is altogether a different style of architecture from any building
</p>
<p>I have ever seen or read about." Another said, "But he is dead by
</p>
<p>this time, and he will never see this temple again."
</p>
<p>I replied, "They cannot kill him until he has finished his work."
</p>
<p>The Governor thereupon gave a very significant grin, when one of
</p>
<p>his suit who stood next to me said, "Whether he has finished his
</p>
<p>work or not by God he will not see this place again, for he's finished
</p>
<p>before this time."
</p>
<p>Another of his suit pulled out his watch and said, "Governor,
</p>
<p>it's time we were off, we have been here too long already. Whether
</p>
<p>you go or not, I'm going to leave, and that damned quick." The
</p>
<p>Governor said, "Yes, it's time for us to be going." They then all left
</p>

<p>JUDASES TO THE PROPHET JOSEPH
</p>
<p>By Benj. F. Johnson
</p>
<p>The days of tribulation were now fast approaching, for just
</p>
<p>as the Prophet so often told us, so it came to pass ; and those he had
</p>
<p>called around him as a cordon of safety and strength were worse
</p>
<p>than a rope of sand, and were now forging his fetters. William
</p>
<p>Law was his first counselor; Wilson Law, Major General of the
</p>
<p>Legion; Wm. Marks, President of the stake; the Higbees, his
</p>
<p>confidential attorneys, and Dr. Foster, his financial business agent.
</p>
<p>All of these and many others entered into secret covenant so much
</p>
<p>worse than Judas, that they would have the Prophet's life, just in

<p>A MODERN NERO SPEAKS
</p>
<p>By George Q. Cannon
</p>
<p>While the events which we have been narrating were transpir-
</p>
<p>ing at Carthage, Governor Ford was at Nauvoo. He left Carthage
</p>
<p>that morning (the 27th) to go there, notwithstanding he had been
</p>
<p>told, both before leaving and while on the road, that it was the
</p>
<p>intention of the mob to attack the jail and kill the prisoners. After
</p>
<p>reaching Nauvoo, the people were called together, and he made an
</p>
<p>address to them. It was one of the most infamous and insulting
</p>
<p>speeches ever delivered by a man in his position to a free people,
</p>
<p>and created considerable feeling among those who listened to it.
</p>
<p>100
</p>
<p>FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>Among other things he said:
</p>
<p>"A great crime has been done by destroying the Expositor press
</p>
<p>and placing the city under martial law, and a severe atonement must
</p>
<p>be made, so prepare your minds for the emergency. Another cause
</p>
<p>of excitement is the fact of your having so many firearms ; the pub-
</p>
<p>lic are afraid that you are going to use them against the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. I know there is a great prejudice against you on account of
</p>
<p>your peculiar religion, but you ought to be praying Saints, not
</p>
<p>military Saints. Depend upon it, a little more misbehavior from the
</p>
<p>citizens, and the torch, which is now already lighted, will be applied,
</p>
<p>the city may be reduced to ashes, and extermination would inevi-
</p>
<p>tably follow; and it gives me great pain to think there is danger
</p>
<p>of so many innocent women and children being exterminated. If
</p>
<p>anything of a serious character should befall the lives or property
</p>
<p>of the persons who are prosecuting your leaders, you will be held
</p>
<p>responsible. "
</p>
<p>While speaking he stood upon the unfinished frame of a build-
</p>
<p>ing on the corner below Joseph's Mansion  on the same spot from
</p>
<p>which Joseph, not long before, had delivered his last address to the
</p>
<p>Saints. There were a few of his men who stood beside him. While he
</p>
<p>was speaking there was a concussion heard, as though it might be
</p>
<p>the faint sound of thunder from afar, and one of those who stood
</p>
<p>beside him heard it, looked around with some anxiety and said
</p>
<p>something to Ford, who soon finished his remarks. After he de-
</p>
<p>scended to the ground, he ordered his troops to get ready to return
</p>
<p>to Carthage. He was in haste to get away from Nauvoo, and the
</p>
<p>anxiety which he displayed excited comment at the time, though
</p>
<p>none, probably, suspected the true cause of his hurry. The writer
</p>
<p>was then a boy, he plainly heard the sound of which mention has
</p>
<p>been made, and looked around the cloudless sky to see whence it
</p>
<p>proceeded. It was about the time that the dreadful tragedy was
</p>
<p>being enacted at Carthage, and as a cannon was fired by the mob,

</p>
<p>on the road between Carthage and Warsaw, as a signal that the
</p>
<p>bloody deed had been accomplished, it was thought that the sound
</p>
<p>was the faint report of that signal. After the meeting Governor
</p>
<p>Ford and one of his companions walked up Water Street in the
</p>
<p>direction of Joseph's store, behind which they went and held an
</p>
<p>animated conversation. Here they probably discussed the events
</p>
<p>which they had reason to believe had taken place at Carthage ; for
</p>
<p>the writer is firmly of the opinion, from the impressions their
</p>
<p>conduct made upon him at the time, that they knew or fully believed
</p>
<p>that the massacre had been accomplished. Their conversation ended,
</p>
<p>they walked quickly back to the Mansion, mounted their horses
</p>
<p>and rode off.
</p>
<p>A few miles outside of Nauvoo the Governor and his party
</p>
<p>met two messengers, Brothers Geo. D. Grant and David Bettisworth,
</p>
<p>hastening to Nauvoo with the sad news of the murder of Joseph and
</p>
<p>Hyrum and the shooting of Elder Taylor. The Governor would not
</p>
<p>let them proceed, but took them back with him to Bro. Grant's
</p>
<p>house, one and a half miles east of Carthage. This he did to pre-
</p>
<p>vent their carrying the news, that he and the people of Carthage
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROPHET'S LIFE 101
</p>
<p>might have time to get out of harm's way, and to remove the
</p>
<p>county records and public documents from that town. After he
</p>
<p>reached Carthage, and had had an interview with Dr. Richards,
</p>
<p>he went to the public square and advised all who were present to
</p>
<p>disperse. He expected, he said, the "Mormons" would be so exas-
</p>
<p>perated, that they would come and burn the town. He set them
</p>
<p>the example himself, which they were not slow to follow, by riding
</p>
<p>on as hard as he could in the direction of Quincy. He left Nauvoo
</p>
<p>about half past six in the evening, having rode there from Carthage
</p>
<p>in the morning; but he did not consider himself far enough from
</p>
<p>Nauvoo to take any rest until nearly fifty miles lay between him-
</p>
<p>self and that city! Then he thought he might refresh himself a
</p>
<p>little; but he lost no more time than absolutely necessary and
</p>
<p>pushed hastily on to his home. Instructor, Vol. 15.

<p>FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS ALSO IN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>9:40 A.M. June 27, 1844: Mr. Woods and Mr. Reid called.
</p>
<p>They said another consultation of the officers had taken place,
</p>
<p>and the former orders of the Governor for marching to Nauvoo
</p>
<p>with the whole army were countermanded.
</p>
<p>Dr. Southwick was in the meeting, seeing what was going on.
</p>
<p>He afterward told Stephen Markham that the purport of the meet-
</p>
<p>ing was to take into consideration the best way to stop Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith's career, as his views on government were widely circulated
</p>
<p>and took like wildfire. They said if he did not get into the Presi-
</p>
<p>dential chair this election, he would be sure the next time ; and if
</p>
<p>Illinois and Missouri would join together and kill him, they would
</p>
<p>not be brought to justice for it. There were delegates in said meet-
</p>
<p>ing from every state in the Union except three, Governor Ford and
</p>
<p>Captain Smith were also in the meeting. d. H. C. 6:605-6.
</p>
<p>From reliable statements federal officials were there. The
</p>
<p>mob, therefore, that killed the Prophet included federal officials,
</p>
<p>state officials, members of Masonry, apostates, as well as the
</p>
<p>rabble, all crying: "Away with him, his blood be upon us and our

<p>CHAPTER 6
</p>
<p>Imprisonment in Liberty Prison
</p>
<p>"MORMONISM" SURVIVES LIBERTY JAIL
</p>
<p>By President B. H. Roberts
</p>
<p>Liberty Jail ! How paradoxical the title ! Liberty and prison
</p>
<p>are antithetical, and are supposed to have nothing in common ; but
</p>
<p>when it is known that this particular prison is associated with
</p>
<p>"liberty" simply because it stood in a little Missouri town of that
</p>
<p>name  the county seat of Clay county, and about fifteen miles
</p>
<p>directly north of Independence  the seeming- paradox vanishes. As
</p>
<p>will be seen by reference to the cut of this "Mormon" historical
</p>
<p>monument, Liberty prison is fallen into ruins, and some years ago
</p>
<p>was entirely obliterated. The prison was built of rough-dressed
</p>
<p>limestone, the surface of which was of a yellowish color. It faced
</p>
<p>east and w r as about two hundred yards from the court house. Its
</p>
<p>dimensions w T ere about twenty by twenty-two feet. It had a heavy
</p>
<p>door in the east made strong and of considerable thickness by
</p>
<p>spiking inch oak planks together. In the south side there was a
</p>
<p>small opening a foot and a half square with strong iron bars, two
</p>
<p>inches apart, firmly imbedded in the stones of the wall. The con-
</p>
<p>tract for erecting this building was let in April, 1833, and in the
</p>
<p>December following the jail was completed. It cost the county
</p>
<p>six hundred dollars, Solomon Fry being the contractor.
</p>
<p>It was within these gloomy walls that the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith endured some of the most cruel sufferings that were crowded
</p>
<p>into his eventful life. For several months during the winter of
</p>
<p>1838-9 he was imprisoned within the rude walls of this old struc-
</p>
<p>ture, awaiting a trial for offenses charged against himself and
</p>
<p>brethren during the troubles in upper Missouri in the fall of 1838.
</p>
<p>Those imprisoned with him were his brother Hyrum Smith, Lyman
</p>
<p>Wight, Caleb Baldwin, Alexander McRae and Sidney Rigdon; but
</p>
<p>the last named prisoner was admitted to bail after a short time of
</p>
<p>imprisonment, owing to the delicate state of his health.

<p>souri, which culminated in the expulsion of more than twelve
</p>
<p>hundred of them from their homes in Jackson county, in the winter

<p>of 1838; as also their subsequent settlement in several counties

<p>north of the Missouri river in 1836, together with the final expul-

<p>sion of some fifteen thousand of the Saints from the confines of
</p>
<p>Missouri, in 1838, under the exterminating order of the governor
</p>
<p>of the state, Lilburn W. Boggs, and executed by the state militia,
</p>
<p>are circumstances which belong rather to the domain of history
</p>
<p>than to this article. It will be sufficient here to say that the
</p>
<p>measures taken by the Saints for self-protection were construed
</p>
<p>into acts of aggressive warfare ; and acts of self-defense were made

<p>criminal. It was for his connection with these measures of self-
</p>
<p>protection and self-defense that the Prophet and his associates
</p>
<p>were arraigned before courts where well known mobocrats sat as
</p>
<p>judges, and imprisoned these men to await the slow process of
</p>
<p>courts reluctant to bring them to trial lest the exposure of the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings in upper Missouri would bring reproach upon the state.
</p>
<p>We are concerned here, however, only with Liberty jail and the
</p>
<p>Prophet's life within its walls. His suffering was great and went
</p>
<p>far beyond the irritation which comes to active spirits when con-
</p>
<p>fined, unwholesome food, and the petty tyranny of unfriendly
</p>
<p>guards. The Prophet could not forget that while he himself was
</p>
<p>compelled to endure this enforced inactivity his own family and
</p>
<p>the entire Church, stripped of their earthly possessions, were being
</p>
<p>driven from the state at an inclement season of the year under
</p>
<p>circumstances of extreme cruelty. It was reflecting upon these
</p>
<p>conditions which wrung from him the soul-cry with which one of
</p>
<p>his revelations opens:
</p>
<p>God! where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth
</p>
<p>thy hiding place? How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye,
</p>
<p>yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens, the wrongs of thy
</p>
<p>people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their
</p>
<p>cries? Yea, Lord, how long shall thou suffer these wrongs and un-
</p>
<p>lawful oppressions before thine heart shall be softened towards them,
</p>
<p>and thy bowels be moved with compassion towards them?'
</p>
<p>To which the Lord made answer :
</p>
<p>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflic-
</p>
<p>tions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well,
</p>
<p>God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes;
</p>
<p>thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again, with
</p>
<p>warm hearts and friendly hands; thou art not yet as Job; thy friends
</p>
<p>do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression,
</p>
<p>as they did Job; and they who do charge thee with transgression,
</p>
<p>their hope shall be blasted, and their prospects shall melt away as

</p>
<p>the hoar frost melteth before the burning rays of the rising sun.
</p>
<p>The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools
</p>
<p>shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee, while the
</p>
<p>pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek
</p>
<p>counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy
</p>
<p>hand, and thy people shall never be turned against thee by the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of traitors.
</p>
<p>In the foregoing may be observed a prophecy which has met
</p>
<p>with remarkable fulfilment  the Prophet's people have never been
</p>
<p>turned against him by the testimony of traitors, however deter-
</p>
<p>mined they may have been in such efforts.
</p>
<p>It was not all gloom in Liberty prison, either, during the time
</p>
<p>the Prophet and his brethren occupied it. As in all cases where the
</p>
<p>servants of God are imprisoned, the sweet and peaceful influences
</p>
<p>of the Holy Spirit were enjoyed. Within those gloomy prison walls
</p>
<p>some important revelations were received; petitions and remon-
</p>
<p>strances drafted, and letters of counsel and direction written to the
</p>
<p>Saints by the Prophet and his associates. Friends visited them from
</p>
<p>time to time, to assure the Prophet of their esteem and confidence.
</p>
<p>The wives of some of the prisoners, including the Prophet's, visited
</p>
<p>IMPRISONMENT IN LIBERTY PRISON 105
</p>
<p>them to inquire of their welfare and take their leave of them before
</p>
<p>departing from the state.
</p>
<p>The Prophet and his brethren having no confidence in the in-
</p>
<p>tegrity of the courts of Missouri, and conscious of their own inno-
</p>
<p>cence, made several efforts to escape from Liberty jail, but with-
</p>
<p>out success. In April the prisoners were taken to Daviess county
</p>
<p>for trial, but finding Judge Thomas C. Birch on the bench, a man
</p>
<p>who had been connected with the court-martial which had con-
</p>
<p>demned the prisoners to be shot in the public square at Far West,
</p>
<p>but a few months before, they asked for a change of venue to
</p>
<p>Marion county. This was denied, but one was given them to Boone
</p>
<p>county. Judge Birch made out the mittimus without date, name or
</p>
<p>place and the prisoners en route for the next place of trial, with
</p>
<p>the connivance of their guards, made their escape, and ten days
</p>
<p>later arrived among their friends, who meantime had gathered to
</p>
<p>the city of Quincy and vicinity, in Illinois.

</p>
<p>LIBERTY JAIL
</p>
<p>By Thomas C. Romney
</p>
<p>Liberty Jail received its name from the city in which it is
</p>
<p>located. This jail or prison was constructed in the early part of
</p>
<p>the last century, likely in the late twenties or early thirties. It
</p>
<p>stood facing the east, twenty feet back from the street and was not
</p>
<p>more than two hundred and fifty yards from the present court
</p>
<p>house. The cost of the building was approximately $600.00. The
</p>
<p>prison does not stand today but a dwelling house has been built over
</p>
<p>a part of the foundation, nothing of the original remaining except
</p>
<p>the stones on the floor of the dungeon and about three feet running
</p>
<p>full length of two of the original walls. It was purchased by Wilford
</p>
<p>Wood for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on June
</p>
<p>19, 1939.
</p>
<p>The place has a special significance to the Latter-day Saints,
</p>
<p>for herein the Prophet Joseph Smith and five of his brethren were

</p>
<p>confined over a period of nearly six months, on the false charge
</p>
<p>of treason. The Elders incarcerated with him were Hyrum Smith,
</p>
<p>Sidney Rigdon, Caleb Baldwin, Lyman Wight and Alexander
</p>
<p>McRae. Sidney Rigdon did not serve the entire term of the other
</p>
<p>brethren due to a serious illness that enabled him to get out on bail.
</p>
<p>The indignities suffered by the Prophet and his companions
</p>
<p>were indescribable. In a letter written by the Prophet, he said:
</p>
<p>"We are kept under a strong guard, night and day, in a prison of
</p>
<p>double walls and doors, prescribed in our liberty of conscience ; our
</p>
<p>food is scant, uniform and coarse. We have been compelled to
</p>
<p>sleep on the floor with straw and not blankets sufficient to keep us
</p>
<p>warm; and when we have a fire we are obliged to have almost a
</p>
<p>constant smoke."
</p>
<p>His brother Hyrum said that poison was administered to them
</p>
<p>three or four times, with the result that it vomited them almost to
</p>
<p>death, and they would be two or three days in a torpid, stupid state ;
</p>
<p>106
</p>
<p>FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>not caring if they should pass away in death. Hyrum also declared
</p>
<p>that they were offered food that appeared to be human flesh, and
</p>
<p>which was referred to by one of the guards as "Mormon beef."
</p>
<p>Only one of their number tasted it. Alexander McRae confirms the
</p>
<p>testimony of Hyrum Smith relative to the results of poison being
</p>
<p>in the food in his declaration that all that partook of it were af-
</p>
<p>flicted, "some being blind two or three days, and it was only by
</p>
<p>much faith and prayer that the effect was overcome."
</p>
<p>During these days of trial, the Prophet Joseph was always the
</p>
<p>one to whom the other brethren went for comfort and strength.
</p>
<p>Said Brother McRae : "We never suffered ourselves to go into any
</p>
<p>important measure without asking Brother Joseph to inquire of
</p>
<p>the Lord in relation to it. Such was our confidence in him as a
</p>
<p>prophet that when he said : "Thus saith the Lord" we were confi-
</p>
<p>dent it would be as he said, "for we never found his word fail in
</p>
<p>a single instance."
</p>
<p>The Prophet's courage was sublime. In the midst of the greatest
</p>
<p>afflictions imaginable, he expressed himself thus : "We are deter-
</p>
<p>mined to endure tribulation as good soldiers unto the end; when
</p>
<p>you read this you will know that prison walls, iron doors, screech-
</p>
<p>ing hinges, guards and jailors, have not destroyed our confidence,
</p>
<p>but we say, and that from experience, that they are calculated in
</p>
<p>their very nature to make the soul of an honest man feel stronger
</p>
<p>than the power of hell."
</p>
<p>Yet at times, like the Master before him, he cried out against
</p>
<p>the indignities heaped upon him and his people by the enemies of
</p>
<p>truth. Note the anguish of spirit in these words uttered by him:
</p>
<p>"And again the cries of orphans and widows would not have
</p>
<p>ascended up to God against them. Nor would innocent blood have
</p>
<p>stained the soil of Missouri. But oh, the relenting hand; the in-
</p>
<p>humanity and murderous disposition of the people. It shades all
</p>
<p>nature ; it beggars and defies all description ; it is a tale of woe, a

<p>lamentable tale; yes, a sorrowful tale. It cannot be found among
</p>
<p>heathens; it cannot be found among the nations where kings and
</p>
<p>tyrants are enthroned; it cannot be found among the savages of
</p>
<p>the wilderness; yea, and I think it cannot be found among wild

</p>
<p>THE HISTORIC LIBERTY JAIL
</p>
<p>By Andrew Jenson and Edward Stevenson
</p>
<p>This morning, (September 18, 1888) early we took train for
</p>
<p>Cameron, a fine city in Clinton county, where we changed cars and
</p>
<p>continued our journey to Liberty, Clay county, arriving here at
</p>
<p>11 A.M. Without any difficulty we found the old jail where Joseph
</p>
<p>and his brethren were incarcerated from November, 1838, to April,
</p>
<p>1839. By the assistance of a colored neighbor we soon succeeded
</p>
<p>in gaining an entrance to the interior of the half-tumble-down
</p>
<p>building, which we found very filthy indeed, filled with cobwebs and
</p>
<p>IMPRISONMENT IN LIBERTY PRISON 107
</p>
<p>insects of numerous kinds which had their abode in the rotten
</p>
<p>timbers. Mr. Theodore Shively, who has charge of the property
</p>
<p>for the present owner (Mortimer Dearing, a wealthy banker of
</p>
<p>Kansas City), told us that the jail had not been opened and entered
</p>
<p>until today for many years. The smell from the decaying timber
</p>
<p>and dead insects was something sickening, and a couple of minutes'
</p>
<p>stay there made us wish for the fresh air outside. How the Prophet
</p>
<p>and his fellow prisoners could endure life in such a hole for up-
</p>
<p>wards of five months is more than we can comprehend. Of course
</p>
<p>it was not so filthy then, but the openings for ventilation and light
</p>
<p>seem to have been so small that it cannot possibly have been a
</p>
<p>healthy abode for human beings at any time. We found the space
</p>
<p>inside to measure about 141/2 feet from east to west, and 14 feet
</p>
<p>from north to south. From the basement floor to the ceiling we
</p>
<p>should judge it to be about 14 feet, two feet of which is under
</p>
<p>ground. The middle floor, which, while Joseph and his fellow
</p>
<p>prisoners were there, divided the space into an upper and lower
</p>
<p>story, has been torn away, but we could see where it had been and
</p>
<p>should say that the cell or lower room at that time measured 6V2
</p>
<p>feet, and the upper about 7 feet from floor to ceiling.
</p>
<p>Joseph and his fellow-prisoners were confined in the upper
</p>
<p>room. The only openings giving light and ventilation to the cell
</p>
<p>part are two very small grated windows, through the wall, one on
</p>
<p>the south and another on the north side. These openings, each of
</p>
<p>which has a heavy square iron bar running horizontally through
</p>
<p>the middle, are two feet wide and six inches high. Above them
</p>
<p>there are, near the roof, two larger openings, two feet in width
</p>
<p>and one foot in height, giving light and air to the upper story. In
</p>
<p>each of these two upper windows there are five square iron bars
</p>
<p>standing perpendicularly and fastened very securely in the timbers
</p>
<p>of the building. In fact the whole structure is a double building,
</p>
<p>the inner being built of hewn oak logs about a foot square and the
</p>
<p>outside of rock. The floor and ceiling are constructed of the same

</p>
<p>material, thus making a huge wooden box. The rock walls are two
</p>
<p>feet thick, and in building them a space of about one foot was left
</p>
<p>between the rock and timber, which space was filled up with loose
</p>
<p>rock. Thus it will be seen that the prison walls are virtually four
</p>
<p>feet thick. Several loads of rock were also placed on top of the
</p>
<p>log ceiling, in order to make escape through the roof impossible.
</p>
<p>The outside dimensions of the building are : 22*4 feet long, 22 feet
</p>
<p>wide and 12 feet high to the square. The door is on the east end,
</p>
<p>facing the street, and is 51/2 feet high and 214 feet wide, and opens
</p>
<p>to what was the upper apartment. The west gable and most of
</p>
<p>the west wall have tumbled down and also part of the north wall,
</p>
<p>thus leaving the timber or inside structure partly exposed. The
</p>
<p>east wall and gable are in a good state of preservation, and only
</p>
<p>one corner of the south wall is torn down. The building stands on
</p>
<p>the west side of what is known as Main street, one-and-one-half
</p>
<p>blocks north of the northwest corner of the Liberty court house
</p>
<p>square. It stands back from the street about 20 feet, on an un-
</p>
<p>cultivated acre lot, which the owner has offered to sell for $2,500,
</p>
<p>but no one seems to care for purchasing the property. To reach
</p>
<p>108 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>the building from the street, we had to make a path through the
</p>
<p>thick growth of grass and weeds. Some of the latter, being more
</p>
<p>than six feet high, partly hid the building from view.
</p>
<p>We also learned from official sources that the old jail con-
</p>
<p>tinued to be used as a prison until about the year 1856, when it
</p>
<p>was deemed unsafe, and for a couple of years and more Clay county
</p>
<p>criminals were sent to Platte City, in the neighboring county on
</p>
<p>the west, for safekeeping. In 1858 the present Liberty court house
</p>
<p>was erected, with apartments for prisoners. For years afterwards
</p>
<p>the old jail was utilized as an ice-house, but has not been used for
</p>
<p>any purpose whatever during the last decennium or more. The
</p>
<p>roof fell in years ago, and the rock wall is crumbling down more
</p>
<p>and more every season, so there is every reason to believe that in
</p>
<p>a few years, even if permitted to stand as it does now, there will
</p>
<p>be nothing but a heap of rocks and rotten timber left to designate
</p>
<p>the place where this historic building stood. We secured the aid
</p>
<p>of a photographer, who took a very good negative, showing the
</p>
<p>ruins as they stand at the present time.
</p>
<p>Having made all the observations we wanted around the jail,
</p>
<p>we visited a number of the old settlers of the town, among whom
</p>
<p>were Col. Luke W. Burris, a county official, Ben H. Stean, a bright
</p>
<p>business man, James H. Ford, an ex-official, Dr. Marsh and others.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford is 72 years old, served as deputy sheriff of Clay county
</p>
<p>in 1838-39, and had Joseph Smith and fellow prisoners under his
</p>
<p>charge during their incarceration, acting under the direction of
</p>
<p>Samuel Hadley, the county sheriff. On many occasions he had
</p>
<p>taken the prisoners out one at a time for walks around the town,
</p>
<p>in order to give them an opportunity to enjoy the fresh air and get
</p>
<p>better meals than the jail fare allowed. On these walks he had
</p>
<p>often had lengthy conversations with the Prophet, who to him ap-
</p>
<p>peared to be far above the average man in intelligence, and seemed
</p>
<p>to be very deep and thoughtful, although good natured and even
</p>
<p>jocular in his. manners. He had never looked upon Joseph Smith

</p>
<p>and his friends in prison as real criminals, but ascribed their in-
</p>
<p>carceration mainly to the excitement and bigotry of the times."
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford remembered the time when the prisoners tried to break
</p>
<p>jail, and said he discharged his pistol on that occasion, but hoped
</p>
<p>he did not hurt anybody. This is evidently the shot fired after
</p>
<p>Cyrus Daniels, one of the visiting brethren, who fell into a hole
</p>
<p>just as the report of a pistol was heard, and a ball came whistling
</p>
<p>by. Mr. Ford said that in stopping the prisoners from getting out
</p>
<p>he also struck a heavy blow at the head of a boyish-looking man,
</p>
<p>whose name he believed was Snow.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford also accompanied the prisoners to Gallatin, Daviess
</p>
<p>county, in April, 1839, and said when they arrived there, they were
</p>
<p>handed over to some half-a-dozen of the strongest and roughest
</p>
<p>men of Daviess county, who at first crowded the prisoners into a
</p>
<p>corner of a room, refusing to allow them any liberties at all, but
</p>
<p>after a little, when they began to converse with the prisoners, they
</p>
<p>became quite sociable with them, and a reputed champion wrestler
</p>
<p>of Daviess county wanted to try strength with the Mormon Proph-
</p>
<p>et. Joseph excused himself, saying he was a prisoner and could not
</p>
<p>IMPRISONMENT IN LIBERTY PRISON 109
</p>
<p>engage in exercises of that kind under the circumstances; but
</p>
<p>finally, through the solicitations of the guard and the man promis-
</p>
<p>ing not to get angry if he was thrown, Joseph consented to wrestle
</p>
<p>with him. Consequently a ring was made and the two stepped
</p>
<p>forth. The Missourian took recourse to all the trickery known to
</p>
<p>him in the art of wrestling, but was unsuccessful in his attempts
</p>
<p>to throw Joseph. Finally the latter gathered up his strength, made
</p>
<p>a first real attempt and threw his opponent flat upon his back in
</p>
<p>a pool of water. This made the fellow mad, although he had agreed
</p>
<p>not to get offended if thrown, and he wished to fight, but the guard
</p>
<p>interfered and the Daviess county champion was much humiliated
</p>
<p>afterwards in being made the object of considerable ridicule on the
</p>
<p>part of his companions, he having previously boasted that he could
</p>
<p>easily throw Joseph Smith.
</p>
<p>We asked Mr. Ford if he knew anything about human flesh
</p>
<p>having been offered the prisoners. He answered emphatically no.
</p>
<p>So far as his knowledge went, such a thing was not even thought
</p>
<p>of, much less done. We suggested that it might possibly have been
</p>
<p>done without his knowledge, but he thought not. Samuel Tillery,
</p>
<p>he said, was the man who boarded the prisoners, and he did not
</p>
<p>believe him guilty of such an act. Mr. Ford was satisfied that the
</p>
<p>prisoners were treated humanly throughout, and given all the at-
</p>
<p>tention and privileges the law and circumstances would allow.

<p>JOSEPH AND COMPANIONS GIVEN HUMAN

<p>FLESH TO EAT
</p>
<p>By Joseph A. McRae
</p>
<p>In a letter written from Carthage Jail, Carthage, Illinois, by
</p>
<p>Joseph A. McRae, dated March 7, 1939, to the Compiler of this book,
</p>
<p>Brother McRae says:
</p>
<p>Respecting the incident you mention, my paternal grandmother
</p>
<p>told me many times, for I asked her to repeat to me the experi-
</p>
<p>ences she had in the early period of the church, and this is what she

</p>
<p>said, speaking to me: "I visited my husband several times while
</p>
<p>he was in the Liberty Jail. I carried letters to and from the
</p>
<p>Prophet, that were sent by his family. Your father was born at
</p>
<p>Far West while your grandfather was in prison and I took him
</p>
<p>to the jail to have him blessed. The Prophet blessed him and gave
</p>
<p>him the name of Joseph.
</p>
<p>"Several times when I visited, I sat at the table and ate with
</p>
<p>them. The food was brought in and we all sat down together.
</p>
<p>The Prophet always deferred to his brother Hyrum, and as he was
</p>
<p>the eldest he had Hyrum sit at the head of the table and serve.
</p>
<p>Any meat that was to be carved was carved by Hyrum. One day
</p>
<p>a piece of roast meat was brought in that looked very dark, as
</p>
<p>though it had been burned. Brother Hyrum took the carving
</p>
<p>knife and fork, put the fork into the meat and they fell from his
</p>
<p>hands. He picked up the tools again and attempted to carve the
</p>
<p>meat and they fell from his hands again. After the second at-
</p>
<p>110 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>tempt, the Prophet said: 'Do not touch it, for it is human flesh!'
</p>
<p>It was afterwards told that the guards boasted they had cut a
</p>
<p>piece of the flesh from the thigh of an old negro and had fed it to
</p>
<p>the Mormons. "
</p>
<p>THE LOYAL AND DISLOYAL EXEMPLIFIED
</p>
<p>About December, father Smith (the Prophet Joseph's Father)
</p>
<p>gave out that there would be a prayer and fast meeting for Brother
</p>
<p>Joseph and Hyrum while they were in prison, for the Lord to bless
</p>
<p>them and enable them to bear the cruelties that they had to suffer
</p>
<p>and pass through. My mother and my wife went to go to meeting ;
</p>
<p>it was to open about sunrise in a place that was built by Joseph;
</p>
<p>but when they got to the door it was locked and they thought that
</p>
<p>they were at prayer, and father Smith and his folks and brother
</p>
<p>John Taylor came up and they said to them, "Why do you not go
</p>
<p>in?" They said that they were at prayer. "At prayer," said
</p>
<p>father Smith, "no, it cannot be." So he tried the door and found
</p>
<p>it locked on the inside. He said that some of the apostates had
</p>
<p>got there before them and they had done it to break up their meet-
</p>
<p>ing. He called to them to open the door but no one answered or
</p>
<p>took any notice whatever. By this time several had gathered
</p>
<p>together and some wanted to take an axe and cut the door down
</p>
<p>so that they could get in but father Smith said, "No, we must not
</p>
<p>do that," and Brother Taylor said that if they had deprived us of
</p>
<p>meeting in the house they could not deprive us of praying to God
</p>
<p>our Heavenly Father to look down in tender mercy upon His
</p>
<p>servants and enable them to bear their afflictions and the wrongs
</p>
<p>that they had to pass through. So father Smith said, "Let us hold
</p>
<p>meeting in this house, pointing to one of the houses belonging to
</p>
<p>one of the brethren and they that cannot get inside can hear out-
</p>
<p>side, and we will have a good meeting, although the devil has tried
</p>
<p>to frustrate our design." They did hold the meeting and they that
</p>
<p>were there said that they never saw such a meeting. The Lord was
</p>
<p>with them to bless and answer their prayers. They broke up

<p>about four o'clock in the afternoon, and the apostates had not come
</p>
<p>out yet. There was the Whitneys and Thomas B. Marsh and a great
</p>
<p>many more in there. What their business was I never found out,
</p>
<p>but some plan to help and destroy Mormonism.
</p>
<p>Some few days before that a man by the name of McLellin,
</p>
<p>one who had been high in the Church and Kingdom of God and
</p>
<p>had held the office of one of the Twelve, he and another man went
</p>
<p>into Brother Joseph's house and commenced searching over his
</p>
<p>things and Sister Emma asked him why he done so, and his answer
</p>
<p>was because he could. He took all the jewelry out of Joseph's
</p>
<p>box and took a lot of bed clothes and in fact plundered the house
</p>
<p>and took the things off. While Joseph was in prison he suffered
</p>
<p>with the cold, and he sent home to his wife, Emma, to send him
</p>
<p>some quilts or bed clothes for they had no fire there and he had to
</p>
<p>have something to keep him from the cold. It was in the dead of
</p>
<p>winter. My wife was up there when the word came and she said
</p>
<p>that Sister Emma cried and said they had taken all of her bed
</p>
<p>IMPRISONMENT IN LIBERTY PRISON 111
</p>
<p>clothes except one quilt and blanket and what could she do. So
</p>
<p>my wife, with some other sisters said, send him them and we will
</p>
<p>see that you shall have something to cover you and your children.
</p>
<p>My wife then went home and got some bed clothes and took them
</p>
<p>over to her. Diary of John Lowe Butler

<p>Hoiv long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy
</p>
<p>pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people
</p>
<p>and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?
</p>
<p>Yea, Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and un-
</p>
<p>laivful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward
</p>
<p>them, and thy boivels be moved tvith compassion toward them?

<p>of all things that in them are, and who controllest and subjectest

<p>the devil, and the dark and benighted dominion of Sheol,  stretch
</p>
<p>forth thy hand; let thine eye pierce; let thy pavilion be taken up;
</p>
<p>let thy hiding place no longer be covered; let thine ear be inclined;
</p>
<p>let thine heart be softened, and thy boivels moved tvith compassion
</p>
<p>toward us.
</p>
<p>Let thine anger be kindled against our enemies; and, in the

<p>thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.
</p>
<p>Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again,

<p>with warm hearts and friendly hands.

<p>Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against

<p>And they who do charge thee with transgression, their hope

<p>shall be blasted, and their prospects shall melt away as the hoar
</p>
<p>frost melteth before the burning rays of the rising sun;

<p>and take them in their own craftiness;

<p>The Answer to Mobocrats
</p>
<p>Wo unto all those that discomfort my people, and drive, and
</p>
<p>murder, and testify against them, saith the Lord of Hosts; a gen-
</p>
<p>eration of vipers shall not escape the damnation of hell.

<p>Behold, mine eyes see and know all their tvorks, and I have
</p>
<p>in reserve a swift judgment in the season thereof, for them all;
</p>
<p>For there is a time appointed for every man, according as his
</p>
<p>ivorks shall be.
</p>
<p>The Answer to the Saints
</p>
<p>God shall give unto you (the saints) knowledge by his Holy
</p>
<p>Spirit, yea by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not
</p>
<p>been revealed since the world ivas until now;
</p>
<p>Which our forefathers have awaited with anxious expectation
</p>
<p>to be revealed in the last times, which their minds ivere pointed to,
</p>
<p>by the angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of their glory;
</p>
<p>A time to come in the which nothing shall be tuithheld, whether
</p>

<p>How long can rolling ivaters remain impure? What power
</p>
<p>shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny
</p>
<p>arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it
</p>
<p>up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knoivl-
</p>
<p>edge from heaven, upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.
</p>
<p>Behold, there are many called, but feiv are chosen. And why
</p>
<p>are they not chosen?
</p>
<p>Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this
</p>
<p>world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this
</p>
<p>one lesson 
</p>
<p>That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected
</p>
<p>with the powers of heaven, and that the poivers of heaven cannot
</p>
<p>be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.
</p>
<p>That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we
</p>
<p>undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain am-
</p>
<p>bition or to exercise control, or dominion, or compulsion, upon the
</p>
<p>souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, be-

<p>hold, the heavens tuithdraiv themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is
</p>
<p>grieved; and tvhen it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood, or the
</p>
<p>authority of that man.
</p>
<p>Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against
</p>
<p>the pricks, to persecute the saints, and to fight against God.
</p>
<p>We have learned, by sad experience, that it is the nature and
</p>
<p>disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority,
</p>
<p>as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unright-
</p>
<p>eous dominion.
</p>
<p>Hence many are called, but feic are chosen.
</p>
<p>No poiver or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue
</p>
<p>of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentle-
</p>
<p>ness, and meekness, and by love unfeigned;
</p>
<p>By kindness, and pure knoivledge, which shall greatly enlarge
</p>
<p>the soul without hypocrisy, and ivithout guile 
</p>
<p>Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the
</p>
<p>Holy Ghost, and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love
</p>
<p>toicard him ivhom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be
</p>
<p>his enemy;
</p>
<p>That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the
</p>
<p>cords of death.
</p>
<p>Let thy boivels also be full of charity toivards all men, and to
</p>
<p>the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceas-
</p>
<p>ingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God,
</p>
<p>and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the
</p>
<p>dews from heaven.
</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy
</p>
<p>scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth, and thy
</p>
<p>dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and ivithout compulsory
</p>
<p>means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever. D. & C. Sec. 121.
</p>
<p>The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools
</p>
<p>shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee,

<p>and all the libelous histories that are published, and are writing,
</p>
<p>and by whom, and present the whole concatenation of diabolical
</p>
<p>rascality, and nefarious and murderous impositions that have been
</p>
<p>practised upon this people 
</p>
<p>That ive may not only publish to all the world but present them
</p>
<p>to the heads of government in all their dark and hellish hue, as the

<p>last effort ivhich is enjoined on us by our Heavenly Father, before

</p>
<p>It is an imperative duty that we owe to God, to angels, with
</p>
<p>whom we shall be brought to stand, and also to ourselves, to our
</p>
<p>wives and children, who have been made to bow doivn with grief,
</p>
<p>sorrow, and care, under the most damning hand of murder, tyranny
</p>
<p>and oppression, supported, and urged on and upheld by the iv-

</p>
<p>the fathers, who have inherited lies, upon the hearts of the chil-

<p>dren, and filled the world ivith confusion, and has been growing
</p>
<p>stronger and stronger, and is now the very mainspring of all cor-
</p>
<p>ruption, and the whole earth groans under the weight of its iniquity.
</p>
<p>It is an iron yoke; it is a strong band; they are the very hand-
</p>
<p>cuffs, and chains, and shackles, and fetters of hell.
</p>
<p>Therefore it is an imperative duty that we owe, not only to
</p>
<p>our oivn ivives and children, but to the ividows and fatherless, whose
</p>
<p>husbands and fathers have been murdered under its iron hand;
</p>
<p>Which dark and blackening deeds are enough to make hell
</p>
<p>itself shudder, and to stand aghast and pale, and the hands of the
</p>
<p>very devil to tremble and palsy.
</p>
<p>And also it is an imperative duty that we owe to all the rising
</p>
<p>generation, and to all the pure in heart 
</p>
<p>For there are many yet on the earth among all sets, parties,
</p>
<p>and denominations, ivho are blinded by the subtle craftiness of
</p>
<p>men, tvhereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept
</p>
<p>from the truth because they knotu not ivhere to find it 
</p>
<p>Therefore, that we should waste and ivear out our lives in
</p>
<p>bringing to light all the hidden things of darkness, wherein we
</p>
<p>knotv them; and they are truly manifest from heaven 
</p>
<p>These should then be attended to with great earnestness.
</p>
<p>Let no man count them as small things; for there is much
</p>
<p>which lieth in futurity, pertaining to the saints, which depends

<p>upon these things.
</p>
<p>You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very
</p>
<p>much by a very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept
</p>
<p>ivorktvays with the tvind and the waves.
</p>
<p>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all
</p>
<p>things that lie in our poiver; and then may we stand still with the
</p>
<p>utmost assurance to see the salvation of God, and for his own arm

<p>CHAPTER 7
</p>
<p>The Only Way to Escape Martyrdom
</p>
<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH WAS INSPIRED TO
</p>
<p>FLEE TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph did what the Lord required of him, viz:
</p>
<p>appeal the cause of the Saints to the judge, to the governor and lastly
</p>
<p>to the President of the nation: all to no avail. His only course now
</p>
<p>was to flee to the Rocky Mountains.
</p>
<p>The same evening that they returned from Carthage with
</p>
<p>the letter from the governor, Joseph called Hyrum, Willard and
</p>
<p>some others together in his upper room and, after reading the
</p>
<p>governor's letter, he remarked: "There is no mercy  no mercy
</p>
<p>here." Hyrum said, "No, just as sure as we fall into their hands,
</p>
<p>we are dead men." Joseph replied, "Yes, what shall we do, Brother
</p>
<p>Hyrum?" He replied, "I don't know." All at once Joseph's counte-
</p>
<p>nance brightened up, and he said, "The way is open; it is clear to
</p>
<p>my mind what to do. All they want is Hyrum and myself. There
</p>
<p>is no doubt they will come here and search for us. Let them search,
</p>
<p>they will not harm you in person or in property, and not even a
</p>
<p>hair of your head. We will cross the river tonight, and go away to
</p>
<p>the West."
</p>
<p>At midnight, the same night, Joseph, Hyrum, and Dr. Rich-
</p>
<p>ards called for 0. P. Rockwell, and at 2 a.m. all four got into a
</p>
<p>boat and started to cross the Mississippi River. 0. P. Rockwell
</p>
<p>rowed the boat. The boat was very leaky, and it kept Joseph,
</p>
<p>Hyrum and the Doctor very busy bailing out the water with their
</p>
<p>boots and shoes, to prevent it from sinking. At daybreak Joseph,
</p>
<p>Hyrum and Willard landed on the Iowa side of the river, and 0. P.
</p>
<p>Rockwell returned to Nauvoo for horses, that the start might be
</p>
<p>made at once to the Rocky Mountains.
</p>
<p>The same morning a posse arrived in Nauvoo to arrest Joseph
</p>
<p>but as he could not be found they returned to Carthage. They said
</p>
<p>that if Joseph and Hyrum were not given up that the governor
</p>
<p>would send his troops and guard the town until they were found.

</p>
<p>Messengers were sent at once across the river by Emma, en-
</p>
<p>treating Joseph to return and give himself up. Others also crossed
</p>
<p>the river to persuade them to return. They found Joseph, Hyrum
</p>
<p>and Willard in a room by themselves ivith provisions ready for the
</p>
<p>start. They begged Joseph to return, and some accused him of
</p>
<p>deserting the flock when the wolves came, like the shepherd in the
</p>
<p>fable. To which Joseph replied: "If my life is of no value to my
</p>
<p>friends, it is of none to myself." He then turned to Hyrum and
</p>
<p>said, "Brother Hyrum, you are the oldest, what shall we do?"
</p>
<p>Hyrum answered, "Let us go back and give ourselves up, and see
</p>
<p>120 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>the thing out." After studying a few minutes, Joseph replied,
</p>
<p>"If you go back, I shall go with you, but we will be butchered."

</p>
<p>PLANS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH TO GO TO
</p>
<p>THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
</p>
<p>By Historian Edward W. Tullidge
</p>
<p>In 1880 the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
</p>
<p>Saints published The Life of Joseph the Prophet, at Piano, Illinois.
</p>
<p>A portion of the "Preface" to this history states:
</p>
<p>In presenting this work to the reading public, it has been the aim of
</p>
<p>the publishers to place within the reach of those who cared to know, a more
</p>
<p>correct standard from which to determine the character and work of Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, the founder, under divine direction, of the Church of Jesus Christ of
</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints. It is with the consciousness that the work is not so com-
</p>
<p>plete nor perfect as desirable, owing to the imperfect facilities for obtaining
</p>
<p>dates and facts that were at the disposal of the publishers, that it is offered;
</p>
<p>but the determination to place in the hands of friends of the Church, some-
</p>
<p>thing from friendly authentic sources, has hastened its preparation and
</p>
<p>publication. *****
</p>
<p>The publishers ask that a patient reading be accorded the work, that
</p>
<p>the lack long felt may be at least partially supplied.
</p>
<p>On pages 510 to 5.13 of this history, the following is recorded
</p>
<p>by Mr. Tullidge:
</p>
<p>"June 22, 1844. About 9 p.m. Hyrum came out of the mansion
</p>
<p>and gave his hand to Reynolds Cahoon, at the same time saying:
</p>
<p>'A company of men are seeking to kill my brother Joseph, and the
</p>
<p>Lord has ivarned him to flee to the Rocky Mountains to save his
</p>
<p>life. Good-bye, Brother Cahoon, we shall see you again.' In a few
</p>
<p>moments afterwards Joseph came from his family. His tears were
</p>
<p>flowing fast. He held a handkerchief to his face, and followed after
</p>
<p>brother Hyrum without uttering a word.***
</p>
<p>"At about midnight Joseph, Hyrum, and Dr. Richards called
</p>
<p>for 0. P. Rockwell at his lodging and all went up the river bank

</p>
<p>until they found Aaron Johnson's boat, which they got into and
</p>
<p>started about 2 a.m. to cross the Mississippi River. O. P. Rockwell
</p>
<p>rowed the skiff, which was very leaky, so that it kept Joseph,
</p>
<p>Hyrum and the Doctor busy bailing out the water with their boots
</p>
<p>and shoes to prevent it from sinking.
</p>
<p>" Sunday t 23rd. At daybreak arrived on the Iowa side of the
</p>
<p>river. Sent 0. P. Rockwell back to Nauvoo with instructions to
</p>
<p>return the next night ivith horses for Joseph and Hyrum, pass
</p>
<p>them over the river in the night secretly, and be ready to start for
</p>
<p>the Great Basin in the Rocky Mountains.***
</p>
<p>"At 1 p.m. Emma sent over 0. P. Rockwell, requesting him to
</p>
<p>entreat of Joseph to come back. Reynolds Cahoon accompanied
</p>
<p>him with a letter which Emma had t written to the same effect,
</p>
<p>and she insisted that Cahoon should persuade Joseph to come
</p>
<p>back and give himself up. When they ivent over they found Joseph,
</p>
<p>Hyrum and Willard in a room by themselves, having flour and other
</p>
<p>provisions on the floor ready for packing.

</p>
<p>121
</p>
<p>THE NAUVOO MANSION AND NAUVOO HOUSE
</p>
<p>The former is one block from the Mississippi River, the latter is but
</p>
<p>a few feet from the River.
</p>
<p>The top of the Old Homestead is seen to the left diagonally from the
</p>
<p>Mansion and the Nauvoo House, hidden in the trees across the street.
</p>
<p>"The graves of the Martyrs are located a few feet from the Old
</p>
<p>Homestead."
</p>
<p>"Reynolds Cahoon informed Joseph what the troops intended
</p>
<p>to do, and urged upon him to give himself up, inasmuch as the
</p>
<p>Governor had pledged his faith and the faith of the State to pro-
</p>
<p>tect him while he underwent a legal and fair trial. Reynolds Ca-
</p>
<p>hoon, L. D. Wasson and Hiram Kimball accused Joseph of coward-
</p>
<p>ice for wishing to leave the people, adding that their property
</p>
<p>would be destroyed, and they left without house or home  like
</p>
<p>the fable, when the wolves came the shepherd ran from the flock,
</p>
<p>and left the sheep to be devoured. To which Joseph replied : 'If
</p>
<p>my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to myself.'
</p>
<p>"Joseph said to Rockwell, 'What shall I do?' Porter replied,
</p>
<p>'You are the oldest and ought to know best; and as you make
</p>
<p>your bed I will lay with you.' Joseph then turned to Hyrum, who
</p>
<p>was talking with Cahoon, and said, 'Brother Hyrum, you are the
</p>
<p>oldest, what shall we do?' Hyrum said, 'Let us go back and give
</p>
<p>ourselves up, and see the thing out.' After studying a few moments
</p>
<p>Joseph said, 'If you go back, I shall go with you, but we shall be
</p>
<p>butchered/ Hyrum said, 'No, no; let us go back and put our trust
</p>
<p>in God, and we shall not be harmed. The Lord is in it. If we live
</p>
<p>or have to die, we will be reconciled to our fate.'
</p>
<p>"About 4 p.m. Joseph, Hyrum, the Doctor and others started
</p>
<p>back. While walking towards the river Joseph fell behind with 0.
</p>
<p>P. Rockwell. The others shouted to him to come on. Joseph replied,
</p>
<p>'It is of no use to hurry, for we are going back to be slaughtered.'

<p>"Monday, 24th. ***Governor Ford having sent word by the
</p>
<p>posse that those eighteen persons (Joseph, Hyrum and the others
</p>
<p>included in Morrison's original warrant) should be protected by

<p>the militia of the State ; they, upon the assurance of that pledge,
</p>
<p>at half past six a.m. started for Carthage. Willard Richards, Daniel

</p>
<p>Wheelock, A. C. Hodge, and several other brethren, together with
</p>
<p>James W. Woods as counsel, accompanying them. * * *
</p>
<p>"Joseph paused when they got to the temple, and looked with
</p>
<p>admiration first on that and then on the city, and remarked, 'This
</p>
<p>is the loveliest place and the best people under the heavens.' As
</p>
<p>he passed out of the city he called on Daniel H. Wells, Esq., who
</p>
<p>was unwell, and on parting he said, 'Squire Wells, I wish you to
</p>
<p>cherish my memory ; and not think me the worst man in the world
</p>
<p>either.' "
</p>
<p>ORIGIN OF THE PLAN FOR THE EXODUS
</p>
<p>By Samuel W. Richards
</p>
<p>The children and family of the Prophet, and others upon their
</p>
<p>testimony, have published extensively, both through the press
</p>
<p>and otherwise, that the movement of the Saints to the Rocky
</p>
<p>Mountains was not any plan or purpose of the Prophet Joseph, but
</p>
<p>that the plan or movement was entirely that of Brigham Young;
</p>
<p>but it is well known that he and his co-workers of the twelve
</p>
<p>were on missions abroad, and did not return to Nauvoo until some-
</p>
<p>time after the Prophet's martyrdom, and hence knew nothing of
</p>
<p>the movement planned, only as informed by others after their
</p>
<p>return. The refusal of the people at a general conference to accept
</p>
<p>Sidney Rigdon as their leader, and the appointment of Brigham
</p>
<p>Young as Joseph Smith's successor to lead the people, placed the
</p>
<p>latter where he was entitled to the inspiration of the Spirit to be
</p>
<p>his guide, and this led him to act in harmony with the Prophet

<p>Joseph's plans which were well known to those who had been with
</p>
<p>him, and who had become the counselors and advisers to Brigham
</p>
<p>Young, now chosen and standing in the Prophet Joseph's place
</p>
<p>before the people.
</p>
<p>As is well known, after the people had expressed their choice
</p>
<p>in general conference that Brigham Young should be their leader
</p>
<p>and adviser, measures were at once adopted to carry out what
</p>
<p>was known to be the revealed will of God to Joseph concerning
</p>
<p>the removal of the Saints to the mountains, which was successfully
</p>
<p>accomplished, and which has placed them in the midst of pros-
</p>
<p>perity ; both temporal and spiritual, giving evidence of God's ap-
</p>
<p>proval. I testify to the following facts which I know personally
</p>
<p>to be true.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1843-4, in the city of Nauvoo, Illinois, the
</p>
<p>then gathering place of the people known as Latter-day Saints,
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and leader of that people, selected and
</p>
<p>organized a company of twenty-five, mostly young men, for a
</p>
<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 123
</p>
<p>pioneer company to visit the Rocky Mountains and southern Cali-
</p>
<p>fornia, to find a suitable place for the Saints to remove and gather
</p>
<p>to, where they could be free from those who viewed them as
</p>
<p>enemies, and were constantly hunting him, as their leader, to
</p>
<p>take his life.
</p>
<p>This, then, seemed to be a necessary movement, as the people
</p>
<p>had already been driven from their former homes in Missouri,
</p>
<p>with a considerable loss of life attending, and a like event now
</p>
<p>threatened those who were gathering in and about Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>In view of such a condition and emergency, the Prophet
</p>
<p>deemed it advisable to have the western wilderness explored,
</p>
<p>before the exodus of the people from their present homes and
</p>
<p>gathering place be advised.
</p>
<p>One of the apostles of the Church, viz., Willard Richards,
</p>
<p>who was with the Prophet at his martyrdom, was an almost con-
</p>
<p>stant companion of the Prophet, was sent to me to learn if I
</p>
<p>would be one of the number. Upon being assured that it was the
</p>
<p>wish of the Prophet Joseph Smith, I readily consented, and my
</p>
<p>name was placed upon the list. My former experience, under the
</p>
<p>influence of that man's personal, prophetic power, would have
</p>
<p>caused me to say yes to almost anything he could have asked.
</p>
<p>Arrangements were made for the purpose, and weekly meet-
</p>
<p>ings were held, during the latter part of the winter, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of instructing the company in what would be expected of
</p>
<p>them, in filling the mission for which they were now being set
</p>
<p>apart. These meetings were held under the presidency of the
</p>
<p>Prophet's brother, Hyrum, Joseph being so closely hunted for his
</p>
<p>life that he was seldom with us. His brother Hyrum, Sidney Rig-
</p>
<p>don, and those of the twelve apostles then present in the city,
</p>
<p>were in attendance at these meetings, which were otherwise of a
</p>
<p>strictly private nature.
</p>
<p>At these meetings, the spirit of prophecy was abundantly en-
</p>
<p>joyed by those giving instructions. Upon one occasion, after Sidney

</p>
<p>Rigdon had been speaking, the president of the meeting arose and
</p>
<p>said, 'The spirit weighs down mightily, there has been enough
</p>
<p>said," and dismissed the meeting without further ceremony.
</p>
<p>I had attended two or three of these meetings before I heard
</p>
<p>of what the Prophet Joseph had said while selecting the parties
</p>
<p>for the company, that he wanted young men of faith who could
</p>
<p>go upon the mountains of Israel, and talk with God face to face
</p>
<p>as Moses did upon Mount Sinai, and learn where he would have
</p>
<p>his people locate for their future welfare, and the kingdom's
</p>
<p>development.
</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the first response of my soul was, "I am
</p>
<p>not the one wanted, and I will decline at once ;" but as I was about
</p>
<p>to offer my resignation, a voice whispered to me, "Wait ! no hasty
</p>
<p>action!" I complied with the whisperings of the voice, went home
</p>
<p>and retired for the night, after first pleading most earnestly with
</p>
<p>the Lord to let me know what I should do in the matter, which
</p>
<p>seemed to me the most important of my life. I retired to my bed,
</p>
<p>and during the four hours of my sleep, my prayer was more than
</p>
<p>124 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>answered ; and in the morning, I was ready to continue my relation
</p>
<p>with the company, and prepare the outfit required for the journey.
</p>
<p>I performed the journey in my sleep, and had shown to me
</p>
<p>important events to transpire, and the condition of the earth itself
</p>
<p>to the complete restoration of its Eden beauty and grandeur as
</p>
<p>when man was first placed upon it, in a state of innocence and
</p>
<p>immortality, to which condition all must come in the restoration
</p>
<p>of all things spoken of by prophets and holy men, since the world
</p>
<p>began. It was no ordinary dream to be obscured, and to pass away
</p>
<p>from memory with the returning light of morning, but it was an
</p>
<p>impress upon the spirit which left the body and traversed the
</p>
<p>regions of space, while it surveyed the work of a thousand years
</p>
<p>in the restoration of the earth, and man upon it ; an impress never
</p>
<p>to be obliterated from the mind.
</p>
<p>Upon returning to my natural condition of wakefulness and
</p>
<p>human thought relating to my pioneer call, my whole soul re-
</p>
<p>sponded: "Here am I, Lord," and I continued my attendance at
</p>
<p>the meetings, and my preparations for the journey. During these
</p>
<p>meetings, many things were spoken of concerning future develop-
</p>
<p>ment, perfectly in accord with what had been shown to me, and
</p>
<p>I felt more than ever assured of the divine approval of the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph's determination in the matter.
</p>
<p>When all things seemed to have been satisfactorily arranged,
</p>
<p>and future movements of the company determined, Joseph took
</p>
<p>his departure from Nauvoo, crossed the river, and was making
</p>
<p>ready to visit awhile among the Indians, thinking it would be
</p>
<p>safer than to remain in Nauvoo; and, as I understood, that he
</p>
<p>might be ready to join the pioneer company when they should
</p>
<p>leave, and be their leader in search of a resting place for the
</p>
<p>Saints to be gathered to, as he well knew that where he should
</p>
<p>make a home, the Saints would cheerfully, under his direction,
</p>
<p>locate.
</p>
<p>But this was not to be realized. As soon as it was known that

</p>
<p>the Prophet had left the city, with a view of a prolonged absence,
</p>
<p>a company of the brethren followed him, and insisted upon his
</p>
<p>return to the city. They felt that if he went away, and it was
</p>
<p>known, that not only would the work stop, but enemies who had
</p>
<p>been hunting his life would at once drive the people from their
</p>
<p>homes, and destroy and lay waste, as had been done in Missouri.
</p>
<p>This committee said things to him that grieved him very much,
</p>
<p>calling him a coward and other like reflections, so that he told
</p>
<p>them, "If my life is not worth anything to you, it is not to me;
</p>
<p>if I return, I go as a lamb to the slaughter." But this did not change
</p>
<p>their determination that he should return, which he did, and the
</p>
<p>result is well known.
</p>
<p>This turn of affairs changed the entire program which had
</p>
<p>been arranged for the pioneer company, and the Church was to
</p>
<p>take their departure without the information desired, as to where
</p>
<p>it would be most desirable for them to make an abiding place for
</p>
<p>future growth and development.
</p>
<p>While at Nauvoo, on his return, he addressed the people of
</p>
<p>the city, as he was about to be taken to Carthage for safe keep-
</p>
<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 125
</p>
<p>ing, as promised him by the Governor of the state. Here he made
</p>
<p>a similar statement to the people, that he went as a lamb to the
</p>
<p>slaughter, which proved so verily true, as the world well knows.
</p>
<p>At a meeting held February 21, 1844, in the Mayor's office,

<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH KNEW OF THE EXODUS
</p>
<p>IN THE DAYS OF KIRTLAND
</p>
<p>By Wilford Woodruff
</p>
<p>I arrived in Kirtland April 26, 1834, and there met Joseph
</p>
<p>and Hyrum Smith in the street. I was introduced to Joseph Smith.
</p>
<p>It was the first time that I had ever seen him in my life. He in-
</p>
<p>vited me to spend the Sabbath with him, and I did so. They had

</p>
<p>meeting on Sunday.
</p>
<p>On Sunday night the Prophet called on all who held the Priest-
</p>
<p>hood to gather into the little log schoolhouse they had there. It
</p>
<p>was a small house, perhaps fourteen feet square. But it held the
</p>
<p>whole of the Priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
</p>
<p>day Saints who were then in the town of Kirtland, and who had
</p>
<p>gathered together to go off in Zion's Camp. That was the first
</p>
<p>time I ever saw Oliver Cowdery, or heard him speak ; the first time
</p>
<p>I ever saw Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball, and the two
</p>
<p>Pratts, and Orson Hyde and many others. There were no Apostles
</p>
<p>in the Church then except Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. When
</p>
<p>we got together the Prophet called upon the Elders of Israel with
</p>
<p>him to bear testimony of this work. Those that I have named spoke
</p>
<p>and a good many I have not named bore their testimonies. When
</p>
<p>126 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>they got through the Prophet said: ''Brethren, I have been very
</p>
<p>much edified and instructed in your testimonies here tonight, but
</p>
<p>I want to say to you before the Lord, that you know no more con-
</p>
<p>cerning the destinies of this Church and Kingdom than a babe upon
</p>
<p>its mother's lap. You don't comprehend it." I was rather surprised.
</p>
<p>He said: "It is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here
</p>
<p>tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America  it will
</p>
<p>fill the world." Among other things he said : "It will fill the Rocky
</p>
<p>Mountains. There will be tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints
</p>
<p>who will be gathered in the Rocky Mountains and there they will
</p>
<p>open the door for the establishing of the Gospel among the Laman-
</p>
<p>ites who ivill receive the Gospel and their endowments, and the
</p>
<p>blessings of God. This people ivill go into the Rocky Mountains;
</p>
<p>they ivill there build Temples to the Most High. They will raise up
</p>
<p>a posterity there, and the Latter-day Saints who dwell in these
</p>
<p>mountains will stand in the flesh until the coming of the Son of
</p>
<p>Man. The Son of Man will come to them while in the Rocky Moun-
</p>
<p>tains. General Conference Report, April 8, 1898, p. 57.

<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH PROPHESIED THE EXODUS
</p>
<p>OF THE SAINTS WESTWARD
</p>
<p>Saturday, August 6, 1842 : Passed over the river to Montrose,
</p>
<p>Iowa, in company with General Adams, Colonel Brewer, and others,
</p>
<p>and witnessed the installation of the officers of the Rising Sun
</p>
<p>Lodge Ancient York Masons, at Montrose, by General James
</p>
<p>Adams, Deputy Grand-Master of Illinois. While the Deputy Grand-
</p>
<p>Master was engaged in giving the requisite instructions to the
</p>
<p>Master-elect, I had a conversation with a number of brethren in
</p>
<p>the shade of the building on the subject of our persecutions in Mis-
</p>
<p>souri and the constant annoyance which has followed us since we
</p>
<p>were driven from that state. / prophesied that the Saints would
</p>
<p>continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky
</p>
<p>Mountains; many would apostatize, others would be put to death
</p>
<p>by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence of exposure

<p>THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS  A PLACE OF REFUGE
</p>
<p>AND DESTINY FOR SAINTS
</p>
<p>By Samuel W. Richards
</p>
<p>My brethren, sisters and friends: Quite unexpected to me,
</p>
<p>prior to coming into this meeting, I have been requested to say
</p>
<p>a few words to you on some matters touching my history and
</p>
<p>experience with the Prophet Joseph Smith. I am thankful that
</p>
<p>I can say I was quite intimate with him while he was living upon
</p>
<p>the earth. There is a little experience I had with him that per-
</p>
<p>haps no other person living today could relate. In the winter of
</p>
<p>1843-44, about six months prior to the death of the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 127
</p>
<p>Smith, a messenger was sent to me from Nauvoo to ask if I would
</p>
<p>be one of a company of pioneers to explore the Rocky Mountains
</p>
<p>and to find a place for the Church to go. That request came from
</p>
<p>the Prophet Joseph Smith. At the time I thought it a little
</p>
<p>strange that I should be called upon for a mission of this kind,
</p>
<p>as I was but a young man, in my teens; but my acquaintance up
</p>
<p>to that time with the Prophet Joseph was such that I could not
</p>
<p>say no. I replied, "Yes, I will do anything that the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>wants me to do, that is in my power to do." Consequently, I gave
</p>
<p>my name in to be one of a company of twenty-four young men
</p>
<p>who were selected to travel and explore the Rocky Mountains and
</p>
<p>find a place for the Church to go to, because the persecution was
</p>
<p>getting so strong then in Nauvoo that the Prophet Joseph fore-
</p>
<p>saw that the Church would have to leave, retire from the civilized
</p>
<p>world, and go into the mountains. This was then a wild country.
</p>
<p>I am reminded that when I was in Europe, in the early fifties,
</p>
<p>it was reported to the British Government that I was emigrating
</p>
<p>many people from Great Britain into a wild country, where they
</p>
<p>were liable to perish, and it was thought that this emigration
</p>
<p>ought to be stopped. Because of this I was ordered to appear in
</p>
<p>London and give an account of what I was doing. I was then pre-
</p>
<p>siding over the British Mission, and emigrated many people to
</p>
<p>this country. I responded to this call, and spent about five hours
</p>
<p>before a committee of sixteen members of Parliament telling them
</p>
<p>what I was doing. I had been to this valley myself and knew
</p>
<p>what it was. I told them that I was sending people to a country
</p>
<p>where they could own a farm and be as independent in their liv-
</p>
<p>ing as the lords and peers were there. I satisfied them, and they
</p>
<p>all shook hands with me at the end of our interview and wished
</p>
<p>me well, and I was invited by a number of them to come again
</p>
<p>to London and spend some time with them. I speak of this to
</p>
<p>show that the feeling of the people at that time was that this
</p>
<p>was a wild country, and we were coming here to perish.

</p>
<p>It was the purpose of the Prophet Joseph to come here and
</p>
<p>locate with his people. He organized this company and held weekly
</p>
<p>meetings with them for several weeks in Nauvoo, and when he
</p>
<p>had them sufficiently instructed, as he thought, to properly under-
</p>
<p>stand what was to be the character of their mission and fit-out,
</p>
<p>he went across the river and made a start to go toward the moun-
</p>
<p>tains. It was his intention to go to the mountains with us, as a
</p>
<p>company of pioneers. But he was followed by those who did not
</p>
<p>like the idea of his leaving, and while they were pleading with him
</p>
<p>to return, he told them, "If I go back, I go as a lamb to the
</p>
<p>slaughter/' Nevertheless, they determined he should return, and
</p>
<p>he went back to Nauvoo. From there he went to Carthage, and
</p>
<p>we all know the history of what followed.
</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, I attended four meetings of this company
</p>
<p>and at one of them, which was in charge of Hyrum Smith, and
</p>
<p>three or four of the Twelve were also present, it was said that
</p>
<p>Joseph the Prophet had remarked that he wanted young men for
</p>
<p>that mission who could go upon the mountains and talk with God
</p>
<p>face to face, as Moses did upon Mount Sinai. When I heard that

<p>130 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>statement, I felt in my soul that I was not the one to go; and
</p>
<p>just before the meeting closed I got up out of my seat for the
</p>
<p>purpose of going to Brother Hyrum Smith and telling him I was
</p>
<p>not the one to go for I did not feel that I could meet these condi-
</p>
<p>tions, but as I got up there was a voice came to me and I heard
</p>
<p>it distinctly as from one standing by my side, saying, "Stop; rest
</p>
<p>awhile. " I took my seat again, and instead of telling the Prophet
</p>
<p>Hyrum that I did not feel I could go, I went home, and before re-
</p>
<p>tiring I knelt by my bedside and prayed to my heavenly Father.
</p>
<p>If I ever prayed in earnest it was then, that I might know before
</p>
<p>morning whether I was a suitable one to go on that expedition,
</p>
<p>under the terms specified. The idea of going into the mountains
</p>
<p>and talking with God face to face, as Moses did on Mount Sinai,
</p>
<p>was more than I, as a boy, could think of encountering.
</p>
<p>No one perhaps need wonder that I should shrink from such
</p>
<p>a consideration. I retired to my bed and remained there about
</p>
<p>four hours, and during that four hours I got the answer to my
</p>
<p>prayer, and when I awoke I was prepared to go upon that journey
</p>
<p>and do just as the Prophet wanted me to do. During that four
</p>
<p>hours I saw all that I expect to see if I should live a thousand
</p>
<p>years. Someone came to me and told me where to go, and I per-
</p>
<p>formed that journey that night while I lay upon my bed. I came
</p>
<p>to this valley first. I don't know how I got here, but I went down
</p>
<p>through these valleys and into Southern California. It had been
</p>
<p>stated that possibly we might have to go that far. When I came
</p>
<p>here I had to pass four sentinels, and in passing them I gave a
</p>
<p>countersign, which I got direct from heaven at the time it was
</p>
<p>needed. I passed them all, and went on down into Southern Cali-
</p>
<p>fornia. Then I was prompted to go farther, and I went into the
</p>
<p>northern part of Mexico. I returned from there to Jackson
</p>
<p>County, Missouri, and there I stayed and helped build the temple.
</p>
<p>I saw the temple thoroughly completed; in fact, I labored upon it

<p>and I went and laid down my body in the ground, and my spirit
</p>
<p>left this tabernacle. Then I traversed this continent from end to
</p>
<p>end. I saw the Garden of Eden as it was in the beginning and as
</p>
<p>it will be restored again. It was a land filled with verdure and
</p>
<p>vegetation, and with all manner of fruits, on which man was liv-
</p>
<p>ing. I saw it filled with cities, towns and villages, and people
</p>
<p>happy, living under the administration of divine providence. It
</p>
<p>was a Garden of Eden in very deed.
</p>
<p>Now, all this I saw while I was sleeping, and it was so im-
</p>
<p>pressed upon me that it can never be forgotten. I saw that this
</p>
<p>was the result of the Latter-day Saints coming to these valleys
</p>
<p>of the mountains and following the direction that the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph indicated. I could tell a long story about this matter, if
</p>
<p>I had the time to do it, but it is not best that I should. I wish,
</p>
<p>however, to make the statement distinctly, that this coming to
</p>
<p>the mountains of the Saints of God and establishing themselves
</p>
<p>here was under the special direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith.
</p>
<p>Although there are those who say to the contrary, this is my
</p>
<p>testimony. The Prophet Joseph Smith had all this planned, and

<p>if he had been allowed to have had his way, I believe he might
</p>
<p>have been with us even today. He would certainly have gone with
</p>
<p>that company to these mountains and have located the people.
</p>
<p>I was one of that company, and I think I have the names of the
</p>
<p>rest. However, the conditions became so severe at Nauvoo that
</p>
<p>the people had to pick up and leave in a body, before there was
</p>
<p>time for this company to make the proposed exploration. The
</p>
<p>Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hyrum, were martyred in Carth-
</p>
<p>age, and the mob would not let the people remain in Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>These are the facts in regard to this matter, and I am proud
</p>
<p>and thankful that I know of these things, and am glad that the
</p>
<p>Saints are building up these valleys of the mountains as I saw
</p>
<p>them built up in vision. If the people of God will only go on and
</p>
<p>keep His commandments, the time will come when the whole land
</p>
<p>will be filled with towns, cities, and villages, and the earth will
</p>
<p>bring forth all that is necessary for the support and sustenance
</p>
<p>of the people thereof. Amen.

<p>PROPHECY HELD IN ABEYANCE
</p>
<p>By O. B. Huntington
</p>
<p>My father was living in a good hewed log house in 1840 when
</p>
<p>one morning as the family all sat at breakfast old Father Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, the first Patriarch of the Church and father of the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph, came in and sat down by the fireplace, after declining
</p>
<p>to take breakfast with us, and there he sat some little time in
</p>
<p>silence looking steadily in the fire. At length he observed that
</p>
<p>we had been driven from Missouri to this place; and with some
</p>
<p>passing comments, he then asked this question: "And how long,
</p>
<p>Brother Huntington, do you think we will stay here?" As he
</p>
<p>asked this question I noticed a strange, good-natured expression
</p>
<p>creep over his whole being  an air of mysterious joy. Father
</p>
<p>answered, after just a moment's hesitation, "Well, Father Smith,
</p>
<p>I can't begin to imagine." "We will just stay here seven years,"

</p>
<p>he answered. "The Lord has told Joseph so  just seven years,"
</p>
<p>he repeated. "Now this is not to be made public; I would not
</p>
<p>like to have this word go any further," said the Patriarch, who
</p>
<p>leaned and relied upon his son Joseph in all spiritual matters as
</p>
<p>much as boys generally do upon their parents for temporalities.
</p>
<p>There were then two or three minutes of perfect silence. Then
</p>
<p>the old gentleman with more apparent secret joy and caution in
</p>
<p>his countenance, said, "And where do you think we will go to when
</p>
<p>we leave here, Brother Huntington?" Father did not pretend to
</p>
<p>guess; unless we went back to Jackson county. "No," said the
</p>
<p>old Patriarch, his whole being seeming to be alive with anima-
</p>
<p>tion. "The Lord has told Joseph that when we leave here we will
</p>
<p>go into the Rocky Mountains; right into the midst of the La-
</p>
<p>manites."
</p>
<p>This information filled our hearts with unspeakable joy, for
</p>
<p>we knew that the Book of Mormon and this gospel had been
</p>
<p>brought to light more for the remnants of Jacob upon this conti-
</p>
<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 133
</p>
<p>nent than for the Gentiles. Father Smith again enjoined upon
</p>
<p>us profound secrecy in this matter and I don't think it was ever
</p>
<p>uttered by one of Father Huntington's family. The history of
</p>
<p>Nauvoo shows that we located in Nauvoo in 1839, and left it
</p>
<p>in 1846.
</p>
<p>The Church did move to the Rocky Mountains into the midst
</p>
<p>of the Indians or Lamanites  or more properly speaking the
</p>
<p>Jews  and here we expect to live until we move to the spirit land
</p>
<p>or the Lord moves us somewhere else.

<p>ANSON CALL'S TESTIMONY AS RELATED BY
</p>
<p>HISTORIAN EDWARD W. TULLIDGE
</p>
<p>It is thought important that the following statement from a
</p>
<p>biography of Anson Call, 'by Edward Tullidge, should be made part
</p>
<p>of the history of this prophetic incident, as doubtless the testimony
</p>
<p>of Brother Call relates to the same incident as that described in the
</p>
<p>Prophet's text of the History, notwithstanding some confusion of
</p>
<p>dates that exists in the Call testimony. It will be seen that the
</p>
<p>Prophet fixes the date of his prophecy on Saturday, the 6th of August,
</p>
<p>1842. In Whitney's History of Utah, Vol. IV  (Biographical section
</p>
<p>of the history, p. 143), the date on which Call heard the prophecy,
</p>
<p>is given as the 8th of August, 1842. While in Tullidge's biography of
</p>
<p>Call the date is given as the 14th of July, 1843, evidently in error.
</p>
<p>There is no entry in the Prophet's journal for the 8th of August,
</p>
<p>1842, and the entries for the 8th of August, 1843, and the 14th of
</p>
<p>July 1843, relate to matters of quite a different character. Tullidge, in
</p>
<p>relating Anson Call's recollection of the incident also says that J. C.
</p>
<p>Bennett was present on the occasion, which must also be an error, as
</p>
<p>the rupture between Bennett and the Church and its authorities
</p>
<p>occurred and he had left Nauvoo previous to the 6th of August, 1842.
</p>
<p>In the Call statement as published by Tullidge, the name of Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams, the Deputy Grand Master Mason in charge of the ceremonies,
</p>
<p>is given as George, it should be James.

</p>
<p>On the 14th of July, 1843 (this date is in error. See footnote
</p>
<p>on page 85, vol. 5 of Documentary History of the Church), with
</p>
<p>quite a number of his brethren, he crossed the Mississippi River
</p>
<p>to the town of Montrose, to be present at the installment of the
</p>
<p>masonic lodge of the "Rising Sun." A block school house had
</p>
<p>been prepared with shade in front, under which was a barrel of
</p>
<p>ice water. Judge George Adams was the highest masonic author-
</p>
<p>ity in the state of Illinois and had been sent there to organize
</p>
<p>this lodge. He, Hyrum Smith and J. C. Bennett, being high
</p>
<p>Masons, went into the house to perform some ceremonies which
</p>
<p>the others were not entitled to witness. These, including Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, remained under the bowery. Joseph, as he was tasting the
</p>
<p>cold water, warned the brethren not to be too free with it. With
</p>
<p>the tumbler still in his hand, he prophesied that the Saints would
</p>
<p>yet go to the Rocky Mountains; and, said he, "this tuater tastes
</p>
<p>much like that of the crystal streams that are running from the
</p>
<p>snow capped mountains." We will let Mr. Call describe this
</p>
<p>prophetic scene: "I had before seen him in a vision and now saw
</p>
<p>while he was talking, his countenance changed to white; not the
</p>
<p>deadly white of a bloodless face, but a living brilliant white. He
</p>
<p>134 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>seemed absorbed in gazing- at something at a great distance and
</p>
<p>said, 'I am gazing upon the valleys of those mountains.' This was
</p>
<p>followed by a vivid description of the scenery of these moun-
</p>
<p>tains as I have since become acquainted with it. Pointing to
</p>
<p>Shadrach Roundy and others, he said: There are some men here
</p>
<p>who shall do a great work in that land/ Pointing to me, he said:
</p>
<p>'There is Anson, he shall go and shall assist in building cities
</p>
<p>from one end of the country to the other, and you (rather ex-
</p>
<p>tending the idea to all those he had spoken of) shall perform as
</p>
<p>great a work as has been done by man, so that the nations of
</p>
<p>the earth shall be astonished and many of them will be gathered
</p>
<p>in that land and assist in building cities and temples, and Israel
</p>
<p>shall be made to rejoice.'
</p>
<p>"It is impossible to represent in words this scene which is still
</p>
<p>vivid in my mind, of the grandeur of Joseph's appearance, his
</p>
<p>beautiful descriptions of this land and his wonderful prophetic
</p>
<p>utterances as they emanated from the glorious inspirations that
</p>
<p>overshadowed him. There was a force and power in his exclama-
</p>
<p>tions of which the following is but a faint echo: 'Oh the beauty
</p>
<p>of those snow capped mountains. The cool refreshing streams
</p>
<p>that are running down through those mountains gorges.' Then
</p>
<p>gazing in another direction, as if there was a change in locality:
</p>
<p>'Oh the scenes that this people will pass through! The dead that
</p>
<p>will lay between here and there.' Then turning in another direc-
</p>
<p>tion as if the scene had again changed: 'Oh the apostasy that
</p>
<p>will take place before my brethren reach that land!' But he con-
</p>
<p>tinued: The priesthood shall prevail over all its enemies, triumph
</p>
<p>over the devil and be established upon the earth never more to be
</p>
<p>thrown down.' He then charged us with great force and power,
</p>
<p>to be faithful in those things that had been and should be com-
</p>
<p>mitted to our charge, with the promise of all the blessings that
</p>
<p>the priesthood could bestow. 'Remember these things and treas-
</p>
<p>ure them up. Amen.'

</p>
<p>"Although I felt that Joseph was wrapt in vision, and that
</p>
<p>his voice was the voice of God, little did I then realize the vast
</p>
<p>significance of those prophetic declarations compared with what
</p>
<p>I do now, with the experiences of the forty-five years that have
</p>
<p>intervened since they were uttered. As he drew to a close the
</p>
<p>door of the house opened and we entered the building to transact
</p>
<p>the business for which we had gathered. It is impossible to ex-
</p>
<p>press the feelings that came over me when Joseph prophesied
</p>
<p>upon my head. I queried in my head how it was possible for me
</p>
<p>to accomplish this great work with the persecution, the poverty
</p>
<p>and sickness that I had thus far to contend with. These proph-
</p>
<p>ecies were ever fresh in my mind until in the process of fulfill-
</p>
<p>ment I arrived in these mountains. When misfortune overtook
</p>
<p>me they buoyed me up, for I claimed the promises of the Lord
</p>
<p>and they strengthened me. After arriving here I still expected
</p>
<p>their fulfillment. The remainder of the narrative will witness
</p>
<p>that my expectations have not been in vain."

<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 135
</p>
<p>SPIRITUAL GIFT ENJOYED IN THE TEMPLE
</p>
<p>In the January 5, 1946, issue of the Deseret News, Church
</p>
<p>Section, compiled by Preston Nibley, events that occurred in the Nau-
</p>
<p>voo Temple under date of December 27 and 30th, 1845, are recorded.
</p>
<p>In the Journal History, President Brigham Young, under date of
</p>
<p>the 27th, states:
</p>
<p>"In the evening I went to the Temple and met with brothers
</p>
<p>Heber C. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, Amasa Lyman
</p>
<p>and George A. Smith. We retired to my room for prayer at
</p>
<p>6:45 p. m.
</p>
<p>"After prayers, a general conversation ensued. The visit of
</p>
<p>the marshal and the emigration to California were the promi-
</p>
<p>nent topics. Elder Parley P. Pratt read from Hasting's account of
</p>
<p>California. ,,
</p>
<p>Under date of December 30th, President Young's account
</p>
<p>continues:
</p>
<p>"The labors of the day having been brought to a close at so
</p>
<p>early an hour, viz., eight thirty, it was thought proper to have a
</p>
<p>little season of recreation. Accordingly, Brother Hanson was
</p>
<p>invited to produce his violin, which he did and played several
</p>
<p>lively airs, accompanied by Elisha Averett on his flute; among
</p>
<p>others some very good lively dancing tunes. This was too much
</p>
<p>for the gravity of Brother Joseph Young, who indulged in danc-
</p>
<p>ing a hornpipe, and was soon joined by several others, and before
</p>
<p>the dance was over, several French fours were indulged in. The
</p>
<p>first was opened by myself, with Sister Whitney, and Elder Kim-
</p>
<p>ball and partner. The spirit of dancing was increased until the
</p>
<p>whole floor was covered with dancers ; and while we danced be-
</p>
<p>fore the Lord, we shook the dust from our feet as a testimony
</p>
<p>against this nation.
</p>
<p>"After the dancing had continued about an hour, several
</p>
<p>excellent songs were sung, in which the brethren and sisters
</p>
<p>joined. The "Upper California" was sung by Erastus Snow, after

</p>
<p>which I called upon Sister Whitney, who stood up, and invoking
</p>
<p>the gift of tongues, sang a beautiful song of Zion in tongues. The
</p>
<p>interpretation was given by her husband, Bishop Whitney, and
</p>
<p>me. It related to our efforts to build this house to the privilege
</p>
<p>we now have of meeting in it, our departure shortly to the coun-
</p>
<p>try of the Lamanites, their rejoicing when they hear the Gospel,
</p>
<p>and of the gathering of Israel.

<p>MODERN ISRAEL, DRIVEN FROM CIVILIZATION,
</p>
<p>LED OF GOD WESTWARD
</p>
<p>By Erastus Snow
</p>
<p>When the pioneers left the confines of civilization, we were
</p>
<p>not seeking a country on the Pacific, neither a country to the north
</p>
<p>or south ive were seeking a country tvhich had been pointed out by
</p>
<p>the Prophet Joseph Smith in the midst of the Rocky Mountains, in
</p>
<p>the interior of the great North American continent. When the
</p>
<p>leader of that noble band of pioneers set out with his little
</p>
<p>136 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>company from the Missouri River, they went, as did Abraham,
</p>
<p>when he left his father's house  knowing not whither he went 
</p>
<p>only God had said, Go out from your father's house unto a land
</p>
<p>which I will show you. That band of pioneers went out, not know-
</p>
<p>ing whither they went, only they knew that God had commanded
</p>
<p>them to go into a land which He would show them. And whenever
</p>
<p>the Prophet Brigham Young, the leader of that band of Pioneers,
</p>
<p>was asked the question: "Whither goes thou?" the only answer he
</p>
<p>could give was : "I ivill show you tuhen ive come to it."
</p>
<p>The prayers of that band of pioneers, offered up day and
</p>
<p>night, continually unto God was to lead us, as He had promised,
</p>
<p>unto a land which, by the mouth of His servant Joseph, He had
</p>
<p>declared He would give us for an inheritance. Said the Prophet
</p>
<p>Brigham: "I have seen it, I have seen it in vision, and ivhen my
</p>
<p>natural eyes behold it, I shall know it." They, therefore, like
</p>
<p>Abraham of old, journeying by faith, knowing not whither they
</p>
<p>went, only knew that God had called them to go out from among
</p>
<p>their brethren, who had hated, despised and persecuted them, and
</p>
<p>driven them from their possessions, and would not that they should
</p>
<p>dwell among them. And ivhen they reached this land the Prophet
</p>
<p>Brigham said: "This is the place where I, in vision, saiu the ark of
</p>
<p>the Lord resting; this is the place whereon we will plant the soles
</p>
<p>of our feet, and where the Lord ivill place His name amongst His
</p>
<p>people." And he said to that band of pioneers : "Organize your ex-
</p>
<p>ploring parties, one to go south, another north, and another to go
</p>
<p>west, and search out the land, in the length and the breadth thereof,
</p>
<p>learn the facilities for settlement, for grazing, water, timber, soil
</p>
<p>and climate that we may be able to report to our brethren when
</p>
<p>we return ;" and when the parties were organized, said he unto
</p>
<p>them: "You will find many excellent places for settlement. On
</p>
<p>every hand in these mountains, are locations where the people of
</p>
<p>God may dwell, but when you return from the south, west and
</p>
<p>north to this place, you will say with me, This is the place which

<p>the Lord has chosen for us to commence our settlements, and from
</p>
<p>this place we shall spread abroad and possess the land !' "
</p>
<p>J. D. 16:207.
</p>
<p>WHY THE CHURCH MOVED WEST
</p>
<p>In reply to the assertion of the Lanioni Herald that Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith the Prophet knew nothing about the projected expedition to
</p>
<p>the Rocky Mountains, and did not predict the movement of the Saints
</p>
<p>to this region, we have already made some quotations from Church
</p>
<p>history and now proceed to give others. There are living witnesses
</p>
<p>in Utah to the truth of that which is found in the written records,
</p>
<p>and their testimony remains incontrovertible.
</p>
<p>The following extracts from the history are all taken from the
</p>
<p>Millennial Star as they previously appeared in the Deseret News,
</p>
<p>in regular order according to their dates, and are integral parts of
</p>
<p>the complete record, the original manuscript being preserved in the
</p>
<p>office of the Church Historian in this city:
</p>
<p>Under date of Tuesday, February 20, 1844, the following occurs
</p>
<p>in the history:
</p>
<p>"At 10 a. m., went to my office, where the Twelve Apostles
</p>
<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 137
</p>
<p>and some others met in council with Brothers Mitchell Curtis and
</p>
<p>Stephen Curtis, who left the Pinery on Black river, the 1st of
</p>
<p>January. They were sent by Lyman Wight and Bishop Miller to
</p>
<p>know whether Lyman should preach to the Indians, the Meno-
</p>
<p>minees and Chippeways having requested it. ... I instructed the
</p>
<p>Twelve Apostles to send out a delegation and investigate the
</p>
<p>locations of California and Oregon, and hunt out a good location
</p>
<p>where we can remove to after the Temple is completed and where
</p>
<p>we can build a city in a day, and have a government of our own,
</p>
<p>get up into the mountains where the devil cannot dig us out, and
</p>
<p>live in a healthy climate where we can live as old as we have a
</p>
<p>mind to."
</p>

</p>
<p>in my office. I insert the minutes:

<p>the mountains or some uninhabited region, where we can enjoy
</p>
<p>the liberty of conscience guaranteed to us by the Constitution
</p>
<p>of our country, rendered doubly sacred by the precious blood of
</p>
<p>our fathers, and denied to us by the present authorities who have
</p>
<p>smuggled themselves into power in the State and nation."
</p>
<p>On March 26th the Prophet Joseph Smith addressed a me-
</p>
<p>morial to the Congress of the United States, asking for authority
</p>
<p>to raise a company of 100,000 men in the United States, to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed to the West in the neighborhood of Oregon and California,
</p>
<p>the purpose of which is thus described in the memorial:
</p>
<p>"To open the vast region of the unpeopled West and South
</p>
<p>to our enlightened and enterprising yeomanry; to protect them in
</p>
<p>their researches; to secure them in their locations, and thus
</p>
<p>strengthen the government and enlarge her borders; to extend
</p>
<p>her influence; to inspire the nations with the spirit of freedom
</p>
<p>and win them to her standard; to promote intelligence; to culti-
</p>
<p>vate and establish peace among all with whom we may have inter-

<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 139
</p>
<p>course as neighbors; to settle all existing difficulties among those
</p>
<p>not organized into an acknowledged government bordering upon
</p>
<p>the United States and Territories; to save the national revenue
</p>
<p>in the nation's coffers ; to supersede the necessity of a standing
</p>
<p>army on our western and southern frontiers; to create and main-
</p>
<p>tain the principles of peace and suppress mobs, insurrections and
</p>
<p>oppression in Oregon and all lands bordering upon the United
</p>
<p>States and not incorporated into any acknowledged national gov-
</p>
<p>ernment; to explore the unexplored regions of our continent; to
</p>
<p>open new fields of enterprise for our citizens and protect them
</p>
<p>therein; to search out the antiquities of the land, and thereby
</p>
<p>promote the arts and sciences, and general information; to amal-
</p>
<p>gamate the feelings of all with whom we may have intercourse
</p>
<p>on the principles of equity, liberty, justice, humanity, and benev-
</p>
<p>olence; to break down tyranny and oppression, and exalt the
</p>
<p>standard of universal peace."
</p>
<p>On March 30th, Elder Orson Hyde was appointed by the city
</p>
<p>council of Nauvoo, to carry the memorial and an ordinance ac-
</p>
<p>companying it to Washington, for the consideration of both
</p>
<p>houses of Congress. This appointment appeared of record on the
</p>
<p>City Council minutes, with the seal of the corporation, signed by
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Mayor, and Willard Richards, recorder.
</p>
<p>Elder Orson Hyde made a lengthy report of his labors to the
</p>
<p>General Council dated Washington, D. C, April 26th. In speaking
</p>
<p>of the difficulties in the way because of the personal desires and
</p>
<p>ambitions of prominent men, he says:
</p>
<p>"Now all these politicians rely upon the arm of our govern-
</p>
<p>ment to protect them there; and if government were to pass an
</p>
<p>act establishing a territorial government west of the Rocky
</p>
<p>Mountains there would be at once a tremendous rush of emigra-
</p>
<p>tion. But if government pass no act in relation to it, these men
</p>
<p>have not stamina or sufficient confidence in themselves and their
</p>
<p>own resources to hazard the enterprise."

</p>
<p>In the same communication, Orson Hyde states that Orson
</p>
<p>Pratt was with him, and they drafted a bill to present to Congress,
</p>
<p>and he goes on to say:
</p>
<p>"In case of a removal to that country, Nauvoo is the place of
</p>
<p>general rendezvous. Our course from thence would be westward
</p>
<p>through Iowa, bearing a little to the north till we come to the
</p>
<p>Missouri river, leaving the State of Missouri on the left, thence
</p>
<p>up the north fork of the Platte into the mouth of Sweetwater
</p>
<p>river, in longitude 107 degrees 45 minutes w. and thence up Sweet-
</p>
<p>water river to the South pass of the Rocky Mountains. And from
</p>
<p>said South pass in latitude 42 degrees, 28 minutes north to the
</p>
<p>Umpqua and Klamet valleys in Oregon, bordering on California,
</p>
<p>is about 600 miles, making the distance from Nauvoo to the best
</p>
<p>portions of Oregon, 1,700 miles."
</p>
<p>All this goes to prove, beyond a doubt that the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith had in his mind the establishment of a gathering place for
</p>
<p>the Saints on the Western slope of the Rocky Mountains, and
</p>
<p>that the idea of the migration toward the West originated in his
</p>
<p>140 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>mind long before it was carried into practical effect by President
</p>
<p>Brigham Young.
</p>
<p>It is recorded in the history of Joseph Smith that about 7 p. m.
</p>
<p>June 22, 1844, Joseph Smith called Hyrum Smith, Willard Rich-
</p>
<p>ards, John Taylor, W. W. Phelps, Abraham E. Hodge, John L.
</p>
<p>Butler, Alpheus Cutler, William Marks and some other brethren
</p>
<p>into his upper room, where he conferred with them in regard to
</p>
<p>what he should do, there being warrants out for his arrest and
</p>
<p>a spirit of murder in the air. Joseph decided that all the enemy
</p>
<p>wanted was to get himself and Hyrum, and that if they went
</p>
<p>away no harm would come to the people or their property. He
</p>
<p>said, "We will cross the river to-night and go away to the west."
</p>
<p>These evidences form an array of testimony sufficient to make
</p>
<p>the proof positive and beyond reasonable question that Joseph
</p>
<p>Smtih, the Prophet of the nineteenth century, was under God, the
</p>
<p>originator and projector of the plan to colonize the Rocky Moun-
</p>
<p>tain valleys with Latter-day Saints, and build up a great com-
</p>
<p>monwealth, devoted to civil and religious liberty, where all persons
</p>
<p>of every shade of belief could worship their God according to the
</p>
<p>dictates of their own consciences, without hindrance and without
</p>
<p>molestation. Millennial Star, 62:417-421.

<p>BRIGHAM YOUNG VINDICATED AS SUCCESSOR
</p>
<p>TO THE PROPHET
</p>
<p>By Samuel P. Orton
</p>
<p>In 1856 I crossed the plains in Captain Edward Bunker's
</p>
<p>handcart company. We got along very well until we ran short
</p>
<p>of flour; our rations being a quarter of a pound of flour per day
</p>
<p>without trimmings. Being young and healthy, I became very
</p>
<p>weak, and I prayed to the Lord that I might die; but my prayers
</p>
<p>were not answered. One day, about this time, there came an old
</p>
<p>buffalo past our camp; we killed him and I being very hungry
</p>
<p>ate some of the meat while it was warm. This nearly killed me.
</p>
<p>I was so sick I had to leave my cart and walk behind the company.

<p>All at once a voice spoke to me and said "Samuel are you
</p>
<p>here?" I said, "Yes, I am here," and turned to see who it was
</p>
<p>that spoke to me, but saw no one. This set me to thinking what
</p>
<p>I was here for, and what I was going to Utah for. I wanted to
</p>
<p>know if the Gospel was true, and if the Father and the Son did
</p>
<p>appear to Joseph Smith and reveal it to him, and if Brigham
</p>
<p>Young was his lawful successor. If so, I wanted to see when I
</p>
<p>got to Salt Lake City that halo of light around the head of Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Young that we see in pictures around the head of the Savior.
</p>
<p>While this train of thought was passing through my mind I had
</p>
<p>caught up with the company, feeling quite well, as my sickness
</p>
<p>had left me. We soon after met a team from Salt Lake City with
</p>
<p>some flour for us ; so we got along all right during the rest of the
</p>
<p>journey. We arrived in Salt Lake City on the 5th of October. The

<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 141
</p>
<p>next morning, it being Conference, I went to meeting in the old
</p>
<p>Bowery, and took my seat about the middle of the building. The
</p>
<p>people were coming in "pretty lively." I was watching to see if
</p>
<p>there was any one that I knew, but saw no one. Then on looking
</p>
<p>toward the stand I saw President Young there with the rays of
</p>
<p>light around his head as I had asked to see while on the plains,
</p>
<p>and the same rays seemed to faintly encircle the brethren on each
</p>
<p>side of him. Then the same voice that spoke to me on .the plains,
</p>
<p>said to me plainly: "Now Samuel if ever you apostatize, here is
</p>
<p>your condemnation. " I looked around me to see if any of the
</p>
<p>people heard the voice, but I thought they did not. This has ever
</p>
<p>since been a very valuable testimony to me.

<p>THE ALMIGHTY DIRECTED PIONEERS TO
</p>
<p>SALT LAKE VALLEY
</p>
<p>By Brigham Young
</p>
<p>I do not wish men to understand that I had anything to do
</p>
<p>with our being moved here, that was the providence of the
</p>
<p>Almighty. It was the power of God that wrought out salvation for
</p>
<p>this people, I never could have devised such a plan. . . .
</p>
<p>We have faith, we live by faith; we came to these mountains
</p>
<p>by faith. We came here, I often say, though to the ears of some
</p>
<p>the expression may sound rather rude, naked and barefoot, and
</p>
<p>comparatively this is true. . . .
</p>
<p>We had to have faith to come here. When we met Mr. Bridger
</p>
<p>on the Big Sandy River, said he, "Mr. Young, I would give a thou-
</p>
<p>sand dollars if I knew an ear of corn could be ripened in the Great
</p>
<p>Basin. ,, Said I, "Wait eighteen months and I will show you many of
</p>
<p>them." Did I say this from knowledge? No, it was my faith. . . .
</p>
<p>I cannot help being here. We might have gone to Vancouver's
</p>
<p>Island ; and if we had, we should probably have been driven away or
</p>
<p>used up before this time.
</p>
<p>But here we are in the valleys of the mountains, where the

</p>
<p>Lord directed me to lead the people.
</p>
<p>The brethren who are in foreign countries desire to gather to
</p>
<p>the gathering-place of the Saints, and they have for the present
</p>
<p>to come to Great Salt Lake City. They cannot help that.
</p>
<p>Why did we not go to San Francisco? Because the Lord told
</p>
<p>me not: "For there are lions in the way, and they will devour the
</p>
<p>lambs, if you take them there. . . ."
</p>
<p>Talk about these rich valleys, why there is not another people
</p>
<p>on the earth that could have come here and lived. We prayed over
</p>
<p>the land, and dedicated it and the water, air and everything per-
</p>
<p>taining to them unto the Lord, and the smiles of heaven rested on
</p>
<p>the land and it became productive, and today yields us the best of
</p>
<p>grain, fruit and vegetables. . . .
</p>
<p>You inquire if we shall stay in these mountains. I answer yes,
</p>
<p>as long as we please to do the will of God, our Father in Heaven.

<p>JOSEPH SMITH DIRECTED BRIGHAM YOUNG
</p>
<p>TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
</p>
<p>By George A. Smith
</p>
<p>We look around today and behold our city clothed with verdure
</p>
<p>and beautified with trees and flowers, with streams of water running
</p>
<p>in almost every direction, and the question is frequently asked:
</p>
<p>"How did you ever find this place?" I answer, we were led to it
</p>
<p>by the inspiration of God. After the death of Joseph Smith, ivhen
</p>
<p>it seemed as if every trouble and calamity had come upon the
</p>
<p>Saints, Brigham Young, who was President of the Twelve, then
</p>
<p>the presiding Quorum of the Church, sought the Lord to know
</p>
<p>what they should do, and ivhere they should lead the people for
</p>
<p>safety, and ivhile they ivere fasting and praying daily on this
</p>
<p>subject, President Young had a vision of Joseph Smith, tvho showed
</p>
<p>him the mountain that ive now call Ensign Peak, immediately north
</p>
<p>of Salt Lake City, and there ivas an ensign fell upon that peak, and
</p>
<p>* Future Judgments Predicted: When we go back to Jackson County,
</p>
<p>we are to go back with power. Do you suppose that God will reveal his
</p>
<p>power among an unsanctified people, who have no regard nor respect for
</p>
<p>his laws and institutions, but who are filled with covetousness? No. When
</p>
<p>God shows forth his power among the Latter-day Saints, it will be because
</p>
<p>there is a union of feeling in regard to doctrine, and in regard to everything
</p>
<p>that God has placed in their hands; and not only a union, but a sanctification
</p>
<p>on their part, that there shall not be a spot or wrinkle as it were, but every-
</p>
<p>thing shall be a.s fair as the sun that shines in the heavens.
</p>
<p>In order to bring about thisy who knows how many chastisements God
</p>
<p>may yet have to pour out upon the people calling themselves Latter-day
</p>
<p>Saints? I do not know. Sometimes I fear, when I read certain revelations

<p>contained in this book. In one of them the Lord says, "If this people will be
</p>
<p>obedient to all of my commandments, they shall begin to prevail against their
</p>
<p>enemies from this very hour, and shall not cease to prevail until the kingdoms
</p>
<p>of this world shall become the kingdoms of our God and his Christ." That
</p>
<p>promise was given almost forty years ago. In the same paragraph it says:
</p>
<p>"Inasmuch as this people will not be obedient to my commandments and live
</p>
<p>by every word that I have spoken, I will visit them with sore afflictions,
</p>
<p>with pestilence, with plague, with sword and with the flame of devouring
</p>
<p>fire." Is it not enough to make a person fear when God has spoken this con-
</p>
<p>cerning the Latter-day Saints? I do not know all things which await us. One
</p>
<p>thing I do know  that the righteous need not fear. The Book of Mormon is
</p>
<p>very expressive upon this subject. In the last chapter of the first book of
</p>
<p>Nephi, the Lord, through the Prophet, speaks concerning the building up of
</p>
<p>Zion in the latter days on the earth. He says his people should be, as it
</p>
<p>were, in great straits, at certain times, but said the Prophet, "The righteous
</p>
<p>need not fear, for I will preserve them, if it must needs be that I send down
</p>
<p>fire from heaven unto the destruction of their enemies." This will be fulfilled
</p>
<p>if necessary. Let the righteous among this people abide in their righteousness,
</p>
<p>and let them cleave unto the Lord their God; and if there are those among
</p>
<p>them who will not keep his commandments, they will be cleansed out by the
</p>
<p>judgments of which I have spoken. (Excerpt from Sermon of Orson Pratt)
</p>
<p>J. of D. 15:360.
</p>
<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 143
</p>
<p>Joseph said, "Build under the point ivhere the colors fall and you
</p>
<p>will prosper and have peace/' The pioneers had no pilot or guide,
</p>
<p>none among them had ever been in the country or knew anything
</p>
<p>about it. Hoivever, they travelled under the direction of President
</p>
<p>Young until they reached this valley. When they entered it Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Young pointed to that peak, and, said he, "I tvant to go there."
</p>
<p>He went up to the point and said, "This is Ensign Peak. Now,
</p>
<p>brethren, organize your exploring parties, so as to be safe from
</p>
<p>Indians; go and explore where you will, and you will come back
</p>
<p>every time and say this is the best place." They accordingly started
</p>
<p>out exploring companies and visited what we now call Cache,
</p>
<p>Malad, Tooele, and Utah valleys, and other parts of the country in
</p>
<p>various directions, but all came back and declared this was the
</p>
<p>best spot. J. D. 13:85-86.

<p>BRIGHAM YOUNG'S FEELINGS ON LEAVING NAUVOO
</p>
<p>(Excerpts from letter written to his brother Joseph, dated
</p>
<p>"Richardson's Point, Camp of Israel, fifty-five miles from Nauvoo,
</p>
<p>March 9." (1846)
</p>
<p>"I feel as though Nauvoo will be filled with all manner of
</p>
<p>abominations. It is no place for the Saints, and the Spirit whispers
</p>
<p>to me that the brethren had better get away as fast as they can.
</p>
<p>We pray for you continually. I hope the brethren will not have
</p>
<p>trouble there, but the dark clouds of sorrow are gathering fast over
</p>
<p>that place. It is a matter of doubt about any of the Twelve return-
</p>
<p>ing to Nauvoo very soon. It is not the place for me any more, till
</p>
<p>this nation is scourged by the hand of the Almighty, who rules in
</p>
<p>the heavens. This nation shall feel the heavy hand of judgment.
</p>
<p>They have shed the blood of prophets and saints and have been
</p>
<p>the means of the death of many. Do not think, Brother Joseph,
</p>
<p>that I hate to leave my house and home. No, far from that, I am
</p>
<p>so free from bondage at this time, that Nauvoo looks like a prison
</p>
<p>to me. It looks pleasant ahead, but dark to look back."

<p>BRIGHAM YOUNG WOULD HAVE PREVENTED
</p>
<p>THE MASSACRE OF JOSEPH SMITH
</p>
<p>"Events have since proved that had Joseph led a band of pio-
</p>
<p>neers in the spring of 1844 to the Rocky Mountains, Brigham was
</p>
<p>quite equal to master an exodus and remove the entire Church.
</p>
<p>When the mob force threatened Nauvoo, and the Governor, with an
</p>

<p>He had even started, crossing the river to the Iowa side, where he

<p>from his wife and certain of his disciples, reproaching him as a
</p>
<p>shepherd who had deserted his flock, recalled him to Nauvoo. Such
</p>
<p>a reproach ivas, beyond all others, the last that the lion heart of

</p>
<p>Joseph could bear and he returned and gave himself up to the
</p>
<p>authorities of Illinois. But had Brigham Young been home he never
</p>
<p>would have permitted that return. He would have thundered in-
</p>
<p>dignation upon the craven heads of those ivho thus devoted their
</p>
<p>Prophet to almost certain death. Rather would he have sent a
</p>
<p>thousand elders to guard him to the mountains, for none loved
</p>
<p>Joseph better than did Brigham Young."

<p>PLANS FOR REMOVAL TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
</p>
<p>By Helen Mar Whitney
</p>
<p>The Saints of Nauvoo well remember how the Prophet was
</p>
<p>warned by the Lord to flee to the Rocky Mountains, and had it not
</p>
<p>been for his wife, Emma, and a few faithless and frightened
</p>
<p>brethren, he would have come west, but it was otherwise ordained.
</p>
<p>We cite Joseph Smith to other items (which he must have
</p>
<p>forgotten if he ever knew them) that are contained in his father's
</p>
<p>life, which was written and published by E. W. Tullidge. It con-
</p>
<p>tains an address delivered by Lieutenant General Joseph Smith to
</p>
<p>the Nauvoo Legion, in the afternoon of June 18, 1844, which was
</p>
<p>listened to by hundreds who are still living here in Utah, and from
</p>
<p>it I take the following extracts :
</p>
<p>"It is thought by some that our enemies would be satisfied,
</p>
<p>with my destruction; but I tell you that as soon as they have shed
</p>
<p>my blood, they will thirst for the blood of every man in ivhose heart
</p>
<p>dwells a single spark of the spirit of the fulness of the gospel.**
</p>
<p>It is not only to destroy me but every man and woman icho dares
</p>
<p>believe the doctrines that God hath inspired me to teach to this
</p>
<p>generation.
</p>
<p>"We have turned the barren bleak prairie swamps of this
</p>
<p>State into beautiful towns, farms and cities, by our industry; and
</p>
<p>the men who seek our destruction and cry thief, treason, riot, etc.
</p>
<p>are those who themselves violate the laws, steal and plunder from
</p>
<p>their neighbors, and seek to destroy the innocent; heralding forth

</p>
<p>by bringing distress upon this innocent people.
</p>
<p>"We are American citizens. We live upon a soil for the liberties

<p>of which our fathers periled their lives and spilt their blood upon

<p>the battle-field. Those rights, so dearly purchased shall not be
</p>
<p>disgracefully trodden under foot by lawless marauders without at
</p>
<p>least a noble effort on our part to sustain our liberties.
</p>
<p>"Will you stand by me to the death, and sustain, at the peril
</p>
<p>of your lives, the laws of our country, and the liberties and privi-
</p>
<p>leges which our fathers have transmitted unto us, sealed with
</p>
<p>their sacred blood?" "Aye," shouted thousands. He then said: "It
</p>
<p>is well. If you had not done it, I would have gone out there,"
</p>
<p>(pointing to the west), "and would have raised up a mightier
</p>
<p>people."
</p>
<p>Drawing his sword and presenting it to heaven, the Prophet
</p>
<p>said : "I call God and angels to tvitness that I have unsheathed my

<p>sword with a firm and unalterable determination that this people
</p>
<p>shall have their legal rights, and be protected from mob violence,
</p>
<p>or my blood shall be spilt upon the ground like water, and my body
</p>
<p>consigned to the silent tomb. While I live, I ivill not tamely submit
</p>
<p>to the dominion of a cursed mobocracy. I would welcome death
</p>
<p>rather than submit to this oppression; and it tuould be siveet, oh,
</p>
<p>sweet to rest in the grave, rather than submit to this oppression,
</p>
<p>agitation, annoyance, confusion, and alarm upon alarm, any longer.
</p>
<p>"I call upon all friends of truth and liberty to come to our as-
</p>
<p>sistance; and may the thunders of the Almighty, and the forked
</p>
<p>lightnings of heaven, and pestilence, and war, and bloodshed come
</p>
<p>down on those ungodly men ivho seek to destroy my life and the
</p>
<p>lives of this innocent people.
</p>
<p>"I do not regard my own life. I am ready to be offered a sacri-
</p>
<p>fice for this people; for what can our enemies do? Only kill the
</p>
<p>body, and their power is then at an end. Stand firm, my friends;
</p>
<p>never flinch; do not seek to save your lives, for he that is afraid
</p>
<p>to die for the truth will lose eternal life. Hold out to the end, and
</p>
<p>we shall be resurrected, and become like Gods, and reign in celes-
</p>
<p>tial kingdoms, principalities, and eternal dominions, while this
</p>
<p>cursed mob will sink to hell, the portion of all those who shed in-
</p>
<p>nocent blood.
</p>
<p>"God has tried you. You are a good people ; therefore I love you
</p>
<p>with all my heart. Greater love hath no man than that he should
</p>
<p>lay down his life for his friends. You have stood by me in the hour
</p>
<p>of trouble, and I am willing to sacrifice my life for your preserva-

</p>
<p>They were accompanied by Willard Richards and 0. P. Rock-
</p>
<p>well, and it was after midnight when they started to cross the
</p>
<p>Mississippi. Bishop N. K. Whitney and others of their wise and
</p>
<p>faithful friends also followed them shortly afterwards. Joseph
</p>
<p>sent 0. P. Rockwell back for horses, and the brethren were packing
</p>
<p>their provisions, when messengers came with a letter from Emma

<p>Smith, asking them to return and deliver themselves up, but at

<p>the same time those who were with them begged them not to return.

</p>
<p>THE SAINTS WILL BE OUT OF THE POWER OF THEIR
</p>
<p>ENEMIES IN FIVE YEARS
</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 25th day of February, 1844, in a meeting at
</p>
<p>the assembly room of the Saints in Nauvoo, Joseph prophesied that
</p>
<p>within five years the Saints would be out of the power of their old
</p>
<p>enemies, whether apostates or of the world; and he asked the
</p>
<p>brethren to record the prediction.
</p>
<p>About this time he was inspired to direct the glance of the
</p>
<p>Apostles to the western slope where he said the people of God
</p>
<p>might establish themselves anew, worship after their own sincere
</p>
<p>convictions, and work out the grand social problems of modern
</p>
<p>life. This subject was present in his mind and often upon his lips
</p>
<p>during the brief remainder of his earthly existence.
</p>
<p>Frequent councils were held and he directed the organization
</p>
<p>of an exploring expedition to venture beyond the Rocky Moun-
</p>
<p>tains to seek a home for a righteous people denied every right of

</p>
<p>citizenship within the boundaries of the United States then exist-
</p>
<p>ing. His purpose was not to sever the Saints from this sublime
</p>
<p>republic by any emigration; he saw that this country's domain
</p>
<p>must soon stretch from ocean to ocean. The entire land of North
</p>
<p>and South America was the Zion of the Lord, and the people might
</p>
<p>settle in any spot where peace could be enjoyed, always remember-
</p>
<p>ing that in the due time of the Almighty the center stake must
</p>
<p>be built up.
</p>
<p>Work was stopped on the Nauvoo house by the Prophet's
</p>
<p>direction and every effort concentrated upon the temple. He de-
</p>
<p>termined that the structure should be fitted to receive the wor-
</p>
<p>shiping Saints of the Most High before they should go into volun-
</p>
<p>tary exile or submit to expatriation. And though he did not live
</p>
<p>to see the consummation of this purpose, it was literally fulfilled.
</p>
<p>And though he did not live to see the exodus of the Saints nor to
</p>
<p>send out the first pioneer party of explorers, his inspired sugges-
</p>
<p>tion was carried out; and through it his prediction was fulfilled
</p>
<p>THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE MARTYRDOM 147
</p>
<p>that the Saints in five years should be beyond the power of their
</p>
<p>old enemies.
</p>
<p>In March, the Prophet addressed a memorial to Congress,
</p>
<p>asking for the passage of an ordinance to protect citizens of the
</p>
<p>United States emigrating into the western region. His purpose
</p>
<p>was to advance, under national authority, beyond the western
</p>
<p>boundary of the United States and establish American citizens
</p>
<p>in this vast domain preparatory to the hour when it should become
</p>
<p>annexed to our country. The ordinance he himself drafted, and in
</p>
<p>its provisions he betrayed his usual grandeur of purpose.

<p>SAINTS, IF WORTHY, SHALL BE PROTECTED
</p>
<p>By Orson Hyde
</p>
<p>The Latter-day Saints once had homes amongst other people;
</p>
<p>but other people and other powers would neither protect nor de-
</p>
<p>fend us in the possession and enjoyment of them. Consequently,
</p>
<p>we were forced away to the home which God provided for us ; and
</p>
<p>he has promised us here his own protection and defense, if ive prove
</p>
<p>faithful to him,  that if any people, any power, or any force should
</p>
<p>stretch out an arm to molest or oppress us, that people, that power,
</p>
<p>or that force should be broken like a potter's vessel tuhen smitten
</p>
<p>by an iron rod. "Whosoever f alleth upon this stone shall be broken."
</p>
<p>"I will fight your battles," saith the Almighty. All who prefer the
</p>
<p>protection of Jehovah to the protection of the crumbling powers
</p>
<p>of this world, and whose hearts are pure and honest enough to
</p>
<p>merit that protection, may come and share it. "Come out of Baby-
</p>
<p>lon, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye
</p>
<p>receive not of her plagues." Millennial Star, 24:275.

</p>
<p>up the centre Stake of Zion. If we leave here, where shall we go to?
</p>
<p>Has any one discovered where we can again pitch our tents, when
</p>
<p>we leave this country? In the days of Joseph ive have sat many
</p>
<p>hours at a time conversing about this very country. Joseph has
</p>
<p>often said, 'If I ivere only in the Rocky Mountains ivith a hundred
</p>
<p>faithful men, I would then be happy, and ask no odds of mobocrats!
</p>
<p>And neither do I.
</p>
<p>"Who are going to pull up stakes and leave here? If we for-
</p>
<p>sake our God and our religion, then woe to us, for then we shall be
</p>
<p>all apostates together, and under such circumstances we have no
</p>
<p>promise of God for our protection; but if we live in the faith of

<p>the Son of God, we have the heavens, the power of God and of

<p>angels on our side. I can tell you, as truly as Elisha said to his
</p>
<p>servant: Tear not; for they that be with us are more than they
</p>
<p>that be with them.' For, 'the mountain was full of horses and

<p>chariots of fire around about Elisha.' " /. d. 11:16.

<p>TRAITORS ADVISED THE PROPHET TO RETURN
</p>
<p>By Benj. F. Johnson
</p>
<p>It was now June 1844, and mobs were destroying property,
</p>
<p>burning homes of the Saints outside of Nauvoo, and threatening
</p>
<p>the city. Governor Ford ordered out troops to enforce the law, but
</p>
<p>they were not reliable, and all was excitement. On the 15th an
</p>
<p>order came for the able-bodied men at Macedonia to hasten to
</p>
<p>Nauvoo. On the 16th we started, and to avoid attack travelled all
</p>
<p>night, across the prairie through mud, rain and darkness, terrible
</p>
<p>to those who were there. The Prophet came out to greet us. Here
</p>
<p>I remained a few days on duty, when I was sent by General Dun-
</p>
<p>ham, then in command, back to Macedonia to look after and keep
</p>
<p>up a home-guard.
</p>
<p>It was now revealed to the Prophet that his only safety was
</p>
<p>in flight to the Rocky Mountains, and he crossed the river with a
</p>
<p>few faithful friends with a full purpose not to return. But through
</p>
<p>the persuasion and reproaches of his wife, Emma, and others, he
</p>
<p>was induced to return and give himself up to the slaughter. With
</p>
<p>all the persons who induced him to return I was well acquainted,
</p>
<p>and I know that fearful has been the hand of the Lord to follow
</p>
<p>them from the day they sought to steady the Ark of God, which
</p>
<p>resulted in the martyrdom of his servants.

<p>CHAPTER 8
</p>
<p>Personal Farewells of the Prophet
</p>
<p>to his Friends
</p>
<p>PROPHET'S LAST WORDS IN MORTALITY
</p>
<p>Joseph laid out his right arm, and said to John S. Fullmer,
</p>
<p>"Lay your head on my arm for a pillow, Brother John ;" and when
</p>
<p>all were quiet they conversed in a low tone about the prospects
</p>
<p>of their deliverance. Joseph gave expression to several presenti-
</p>
<p>ments that he had to die, and said "I would like to see my family
</p>
<p>again," and "I would to God that I could preach to the Saints in
</p>
<p>Nauvoo once more." Fullmer tried to rally his spirits, saying he
</p>
<p>thought he would often have that privilege, when Joseph thanked
</p>
<p>him for the remarks and good feelings expressed to him.
</p>
<p>Henry G. Sherwood went up to Joseph and said "Brother
</p>
<p>Joseph, shall I return to Nauvoo and regulate about getting the
</p>
<p>arms and get the receipts for them?" Joseph inquired if he was
</p>
<p>under arrest, or expected to be arrested. Sherwood answered
</p>
<p>"No," when Joseph directed him to return ahead of the company,
</p>
<p>gather the arms and do as well as he could in all things. Joseph
</p>
<p>then said to the company who were with him, "I am going like a
</p>
<p>lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's morning. I
</p>
<p>have a conscience void of offense toward God and toiuard all men.
</p>
<p>If they take my life I shall die an innocent man, and my blood shall
</p>
<p>cry from the ground for vengeance, and it shall be said of me 'He
</p>
<p>ivas murdered in cold blood!' " He then said to Father Sherwood,
</p>
<p>"Go, and God bless you." Sherwood then rode as swiftly as he
</p>
<p>could to Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>Joseph paused when they got to the Temple, and looked with
</p>
<p>admiration first on that, and then on the city, and remarked, "This
</p>
<p>is the loveliest place and the best people under the heavens ; little
</p>
<p>do they know the trials that await them." As he passed out of
</p>
<p>the city, he called on Daniel H. Wells, Esq., who was unwell, and
</p>
<p>on parting he said, "Squire Wells, I wish you to cherish my memory,
</p>
<p>and not think me the worst man in the world either."

</p>
<p>The company (about fifteen) then started again for Carthage,
</p>
<p>and when opposite to the Masonic Hall, Joseph said, "Boys, if I
</p>
<p>don't come back, take care of yourselves; I am going like a lamb
</p>
<p>to the slaughter." When they passed his farm he took a good
</p>
<p>look at it, and after they had passed it, he turned round several
</p>
<p>times to look again, at which some of the company made remarks,
</p>
<p>when Joseph said: "If some of you had got such a farm and knew
</p>
<p>you would not see it any more, you would want to take a good look
</p>
<p>at it for the last time."
</p>
<p>Joseph rode down home twice to bid his family farewell. He
</p>
<p>appeared solemn and thoughtful, and expressed himself to several
</p>
<p>150 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>individuals that he expected to be murdered. There appeared no
</p>
<p>alternative but that he must either give himself up, or the in-
</p>
<p>habitants of the city would be massacred by a lawless mob under
</p>
<p>sanction of the Governor.
</p>
<p>/ told Stephen Markham that if I and Hyrum ivere ever taken
</p>
<p>again we should be massacred, or I was not a prophet of God. 1

<p>WILFORD WOODRUFF SEES THE PROPHET JOSEPH
</p>
<p>FOR THE LAST TIME
</p>
<p>I left New York for Nauvoo, via the lakes, and was on the
</p>
<p>steamer Chesapeake, with my wife and child when she was wrecked
</p>
<p>on Lake Michigan, and all came near being lost; but through the
</p>
<p>mercy of God we were again preserved from the perils of the
</p>
<p>waters. I arrived at Nauvoo on the 6th of October, 1841, where I
</p>
<p>again had the happy privilege of meeting with the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>and Apostles and my friends. I spent the winter of 1841-2 in
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, attending meetings and councils, and laboring with my
</p>
<p>hands for the support of myself and family until the 3rd of Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary, 1842, at which time Joseph Smith called me to take charge
</p>
<p>of the business department of the printing office, which I attended
</p>
<p>to until the 20th of January, 1844, when I left the office well sup-
</p>
<p>plied with materials, in the hands of Elder John Taylor. I received
</p>
<p>my endowments with the Twelve under the direction of the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith in the winter of 1843. In the spring of 1844, I was
</p>
<p>appointed a mission w T ith most of the Tw T elve to go through the
</p>
<p>Eastern States. On the 9th of May, 1844, I took the last parting
</p>
<p>hand with President Joseph Smith in his own house, with Brother
</p>
<p>Jedediah M. Grant. He blessed me and bade me God speed, but
</p>
<p>seemed very sorrowful, as he did in parting with all the Twelve.
</p>
<p>I have since been satisfied that he had a presentiment that it was
</p>
<p>his last parting with his brethren of the Apostles. I attended a
</p>
<p>conference at Boston, and on the 27th of June, 1844, while at the

<p>railway depot in Boston with Elder Brigham Young, waiting for
</p>
<p>trains to take us to Lowell, there seemed to be a dark cloud and
</p>
<p>sorrowful gloom come over us, which we could not comprehend at
</p>
<p>the time. While I was at Portland, Maine, and ready to step on
</p>
<p>board a steamer for Fox Islands I saw an account of the martyr-
</p>
<p>dom of the Prophet and his brother Hyrum, and the Spirit bore

<p>record to me that it was true; so I returned to Boston, where the

<p>Twelve soon met together, and we hastened to Nauvoo, when we
</p>
<p>found the city enveloped in mourning. Millennial Star, Vol. 51:242.

<p>ORDERS FOR MACEDONIA TROOPS OF THE
</p>
<p>NAUVOO LEGION
</p>
<p>By John L. Smith
</p>
<p>In 1844, during the increase of troubles and mobocracy in
</p>
<p>Hancock county, Illinois, orders were issued for the Macedonia
</p>
<p>PERSONAL FAREWELLS OF THE PROPHET 151
</p>
<p>troop of the Nauvoo Legion to march to Nauvoo. The troops being
</p>
<p>assembled and the dispatches read, Captain Babbitt made the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing speech, as near as my memory serves : "My men, I love you,
</p>
<p>but I will not go, and will say that not one of you who start for
</p>
<p>Nauvoo will ever reach that place alive." My father, president of
</p>
<p>the branch, stepped in front of the company, and in a clear distinct
</p>
<p>voice said : "Every man of you that goes at the call of the Prophet
</p>
<p>shall go and return safely and not a hair of your heads shall be
</p>
<p>lost; and I bless you in the name of the Lord."
</p>
<p>The troop, seventy-five in number, quickly voted for Lieut.
</p>
<p>Yager to take command, and in one hour we were on the march.
</p>
<p>For some days previous the rain had been falling in torrents;
</p>
<p>creeks and sloughs were overflowing and the roads were ankle-deep
</p>
<p>in mud. Some six or eight of our party were mounted on horses,
</p>
<p>the balance trailing behind the baggage wagons, holding our arms
</p>
<p>and ammunition above our heads, as we were often waist-deep in
</p>
<p>water.
</p>
<p>About five miles on our way, we encountered a band of mounted
</p>
<p>men with red flags flying. They were twice our number, and had
</p>
<p>gathered around a log house, some fifty yards to the left of the
</p>
<p>road. They rode around the house several times and fired at us
</p>
<p>as they made the circle, the bullets whistling through the air and
</p>
<p>some of them ploughing up the ground before reaching our line.
</p>
<p>Captain Yager placed our men in file at three paces space, directing
</p>
<p>each man to load well, but hold fire until we could see them wink ;
</p>
<p>just as we were nearly opposite them they took fright and broke
</p>
<p>into a run across the prairie toward Carthage.
</p>
<p>We reached Nauvoo about daylight, and encamped in front
</p>
<p>of Foster's big brick house near the Temple. Our camp equipage
</p>
<p>was placed by the side of a log which reached halfway across the
</p>
<p>street. While I was guarding the baggage, Joseph the Prophet
</p>
<p>rode up to the log, reached his hand to me and inquired after uncle
</p>
<p>and aunt. He held me by the hand and pulled me forward until

</p>
<p>I was obliged to step upon the log. When turning his horse side-
</p>
<p>ways he drew me step by step to near the end of the log, when
</p>
<p>seeing that each foot left marks upon the bark he asked me what
</p>
<p>was the matter with my feet. I replied the prairie grass had cut
</p>
<p>my shoes to pieces and wounded my feet, but they would soon be
</p>
<p>all right. I noticed the hand he raised to his face was wet, and
</p>
<p>looking up I saw his cheeks covered with tears. He placed his hand
</p>
<p>on my head and said, "God bless you, my dear boy," and asked if
</p>
<p>others of the company were in the same plight. I replied that a
</p>
<p>number of them were. Turning his face toward Mr. Lathrop as
</p>
<p>the latter came to the door of his store, the Prophet said : "Let these
</p>
<p>men have some shoes." Lathrop said: "I have no shoes." Joseph's
</p>
<p>quick reply was : "Let them have boots, then."
</p>
<p>Joseph then turned to me and said: "Johnnie, the troops will
</p>
<p>be disbanded and return home. I shall go to Carthage for trial,
</p>
<p>under the protection of the governor." Then leaning towards me,
</p>
<p>with one hand on my head, he said : "Have no fears, for you shall
</p>
<p>yet see Israel triumph and in peace." This was the last time I saw
</p>
<p>and spoke with Joseph the Prophet while living, and the sensation
</p>
<p>152 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>and impression made upon me will never be forgotten. On June 20,
</p>
<p>1844, the troops disbanded, and we marched home, numbers of my
</p>
<p>brethren as well as myself being very thankful for the protection
</p>
<p>our boots afforded to our wounded feet.
</p>
<p>On June 27, 1844, while on picket duty on one of the main
</p>
<p>streets of Macedonia, word came that Joseph and Hyrum had been
</p>
<p>murdered at Carthage. This we could scarcely believe to be true,
</p>
<p>though at the hour specified we heard the firing of guns from that
</p>
<p>direction, it being only a few miles distant. The report was con-
</p>
<p>firmed soon after.
</p>
<p>On the 29th my father and family, with the Saints generally,
</p>
<p>visited Nauvoo and passed through the room in the Mansion house
</p>
<p>where the bodies of the Prophet and Patriarch lay, while thousands
</p>
<p>viewed them. My eyes were dry and it seemed to me they would
</p>
<p>burn out of my head, but no tears relieved me. After the burial
</p>
<p>ceremonies were over we returned to Macedonia. Many threats
</p>
<p>were made, and much talk of murdering all the Smith relatives.
</p>
<p>During the summer we removed to Nauvoo and with the assistance
</p>
<p>of many friends we built a room or two adjoining my brother
</p>
<p>George A. Smith's house. My father administered hundreds of
</p>
<p>patriarchal blessings, having been ordained a Patriarch by Joseph
</p>
<p>and Hyrum before they were murdered. Millennial Star, 56:539-541.
</p>
<p>THE LAST TIME I SAW THE PROPHET
</p>
<p>By Mary Ellen Kimball
</p>
<p>The last time I saw the Prophet, he was on his way to Carthage
</p>
<p>jail. Himself and his brother Hyrum were on horseback, also
</p>
<p>Brothers John Taylor and Willard Richards. They stopped outside
</p>
<p>Sister Clawson's house, at the house of Brother Rosecrans. We were
</p>
<p>on the porch. The streets of Nauvoo were narrow, and we could
</p>
<p>hear every word he said. He asked for a drink of water. They all
</p>
<p>took a drink. Some few remarks passed between them which I do
</p>
<p>not remember; after bidding goodbye, he said to Brother Rose-
</p>
<p>crans : "If I never see you again, or if I never come back, remem-

</p>
<p>ber that I love you." This went through me like electricity. I
</p>
<p>went in the house and threw myself on the bed and wept like a
</p>
<p>child. Juvenile Instructor, 27:490; Nauvoo the Beautiful, p. 157.
</p>
<p>FOREBODINGS OF THOMAS COTTAM
</p>
<p>Thomas Cottam, whose home is in St. George, Washington
</p>
<p>County, Utah, first met the Prophet Joseph Smith, in April 1842, in
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, having emigrated there from England, his native country,
</p>
<p>where he received the gospel February 2nd, 1840. Brother Cottam
</p>
<p>states that the Prophet's appearance when he first saw him was just
</p>
<p>what he had previously conceived it to be  that of a noble, fine-
</p>
<p>looking man.
</p>
<p>"My testimony of him is that he was a true Prophet of God,
</p>
<p>raised up in this last dispensation of the fullness of times, and that
</p>
<p>his sayings and teachings are true and faithful, and that he sealed
</p>
<p>his testimony with his blood. "
</p>
<p>PERSONAL FAREWELLS OF THE PROPHET 153
</p>
<p>'There are some things that are, as it were, engraved on my
</p>
<p>memory. One is particularly so. In Nauvoo I lived near Brother
</p>
<p>Caspar's on the creek, about a mile and a half from the Temple.
</p>
<p>Accidentally going into the city on that fatal day, the 27th of June,
</p>
<p>I met Brothers Joseph and Hyrum with others of the brethren
</p>
<p>and a posse of men on their leaving Nauvoo for Carthage for the
</p>
<p>last time. His appearance and demeanor conveyed plainly to my
</p>
<p>mind that he realized he was going as a lamb to the slaughter. I
</p>
<p>should judge his feelings to be similar to that of the Savior when
</p>
<p>he uttered these memorable words : '0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou
</p>
<p>that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee,
</p>
<p>how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a
</p>
<p>hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not !' "
</p>
<p>"As I was on guard in and around Nauvoo I did not see the
</p>
<p>bodies of our honored dead after they were brought home, but I
</p>
<p>recollect the feeling that came upon me when I just heard of their
</p>
<p>death. 'Can it be possible! can it be possible!' I repeated in my
</p>
<p>mind; 'well, I shall have to go back to England.' But it was only
</p>
<p>temporary, for I soon realized that there would be a leader for the
</p>
<p>people. Even some of the disciples of Jesus thought momentarily
</p>
<p>that they would have to return again to their fishing."

</p>
<p>A PROPHECY BY JOSEPH THE SEER
</p>
<p>On the 16th of June (1844) Brother Joseph preached to the
</p>
<p>assembled Saints in the grove east of the Temple (while the rain
</p>
<p>fell heavily), from the revelations of St. John the Divine. After
</p>
<p>the city had been declared under martial law, the Legion was drawn
</p>
<p>up in front of the Mansion House and the Prophet, standing upon
</p>
<p>the framework of a building opposite, addressed them. He asked
</p>
<p>us if we loved him? if we would stand by him and sustain the laws
</p>
<p>of our country? And we all answered "Yes, yes." Then he said
</p>
<p>he was content; he would die for us. "I love you, my brethren;
</p>
<p>greater love hath no man than that he lay down his life for his

</p>
<p>friends ; you have stood by me in the hour of trouble, and I am
</p>
<p>willing to sacrifice my life for your preservation." Then drawing
</p>
<p>his sword : "I call God and Angels to witness that this people shall
</p>
<p>have their legal rights or my blood shall be spilt upon the ground
</p>
<p>**** and my body consigned to the tomb, but if there is one drop
</p>
<p>of blood shed on this occasion, the sword shall never again be
</p>
<p>sheathed until Christ comes to reign over the earth**** Peace shall
</p>
<p>be taken from the land which permits these crimes against the
</p>
<p>Saints to go unavenged***. May God bless you forever and ever."
</p>
<p>And we all answered, "Amen."
</p>
<p>On the 20th day of June Brother Joseph sent word to all the
</p>
<p>apostles to return home immediately; and on the 24th he, with
</p>
<p>seventeen others, went to Carthage.
</p>
<p>At this time I was living at Big Mound, an English settlement
</p>
<p>about eight miles from Nauvoo, and there, while engaged in putting
</p>
<p>in sod corn I heard of the Prophet's and Hyrum's death. The next
</p>
<p>morning I started to Carthage with those who went after the
</p>
<p>154 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>bodies. We met them on the road, Dr. Richards having dressed
</p>
<p>the wounds of John Taylor and started for Nauvoo with Joseph's
</p>
<p>and Hyrum's bodies.
</p>
<p>The wailing of the Saints when they saw the martyrs was
</p>
<p>terrible. Ten thousand people were addressed by Apostle Richards,
</p>
<p>who admonished them to keep the peace and trust to the law for a
</p>
<p>remedy for the awful crimes which had been committed and if the
</p>
<p>law failed, to call upon God in heaven to avenge us of our wrongs.
</p>
<p>The bodies were placed in coffins, the funeral was held, while deep
</p>
<p>grief filled our hearts and sorrow rested heavily upon us  a stricken
</p>
<p>people. The woe of the Saints cannot be described. Our Prophet
</p>
<p>and Patriarch dead, only two of the apostles with us and one of
</p>
<p>them supposed to be dying, and all this time we were in constant
</p>
<p>expectation of an attack by the mob army.

</p>
<p>LAST ADMONITION OF JOSEPH THE PROPHET
</p>
<p>A few words of counsel given by the Prophet Joseph Smith on
</p>
<p>the 22nd day of June, 1844. On this day our General called us out
</p>
<p>in order and to my astonishment counselled us to give up our arms
</p>
<p>that had been supplied for our defense by the authority of the state
</p>
<p>of Illinois, saying: "We will give to them that asketh of us and
</p>
<p>trust in God for our future welfare. I wish to render you my
</p>
<p>thanks as soldiers and citizens under my command. I proclaim as
</p>
<p>your general, you have done your duty faithfully in guarding this
</p>
<p>city and in preserving the lives of all the people as well as mine in
</p>
<p>a special manner; for I have seen you on duty without shoes and
</p>
<p>comfortable clothing, and if I had the means to buy or if I could
</p>
<p>obtain these necessary things for you I would gladly do it. But I
</p>
<p>cannot mortgage any of my property to get one dollar but I will
</p>
<p>say this: You will be called the first Elders of the Church, and
</p>
<p>your missions will be to the nations of the earth. You will gather
</p>
<p>many people into the fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains as a
</p>
<p>center for the gathering of the people, and you will be faithful

</p>
<p>because you have been true; and many of those that come under
</p>
<p>your ministry, because of their much learning, will seek for high
</p>
<p>positions, and they will be set up and raise themselves in eminence
</p>
<p>above you, but you will walk in low places unnoticed and you will
</p>
<p>know all that transpires in their midst, and those that are my
</p>
<p>friends will be your friends. This I ivill promise to you, that when
</p>
<p>I come again to lead you forth, for I will go to prepare a place
</p>
<p>for you, so that where I am you shall be with me."
</p>
<p>With these comforting sayings, he thanked us for past duties
</p>
<p>done. "You are now dismissed to take care of your wives and chil-
</p>
<p>dren and homes."
</p>
<p>On the 23rd day of June, 1844, we heard a call upon the
</p>
<p>Legion to muster in Main street near the Mansion house. I again
</p>
<p>saw our General in his uniform upon a small frame. He again
</p>
<p>spoke to the Legion. Laying his hand upon the head of Levi W.
</p>
<p>Hancock who was sitting at his feet, he said : "This day the Lord
</p>
<p>has shown to me that which was never shown to me before, that

</p>
<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH ADDRESSING THE NAUVOO LEGION.
</p>
<p>Unsheathing his sword the Prophet said: "I call God and angels to wit-
</p>
<p>ness that this people shall have their legal rights or my blood shall be spilt
</p>
<p>upon the ground and my body consigned to the tomb but if there is one drop
</p>
<p>of blood shed on this occasion, the sword shall never again be sheathed until
</p>
<p>Christ comes to reign on earth."
</p>
<p>I have thousands of friends that never pretended friendship, while
</p>
<p>others have sought to crawl into my bosom because of my good
</p>
<p>feelings towards them, and now are the vipers and do seek my life ;
</p>
<p>and if they shall take it they will pursue you ; they will do it any-
</p>
<p>how. When you are obliged to fight, be sure that you do not stain
</p>
<p>your hands with the blood of women and children, and when your
</p>
<p>enemies call for quarters, be sure that you grant them the same,
</p>
<p>and then you will gain power over the world." He then raised his

<p>hand from Levi W. Hancock's head and also raised his voice, say-
</p>
<p>156 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>ing: "You will forever be named the Nauvoo Legion, and as I have
</p>
<p>had the honor of being your General and leader, I feel to say a few
</p>
<p>words to your comfort and I wish to ascertain your interest and
</p>
<p>faith in your mission of life that you are engaged in, even in the
</p>
<p>same cause, with the power of the Priesthood sealed upon you.
</p>
<p>Your calling is to minister life and salvation to all nations on the
</p>
<p>earth. Although things appear at the present crisis, by the works
</p>
<p>of our enemies, that they hold an overruling power over us, but I
</p>
<p>will liken these things to a wheel of fortune. If we are at this time
</p>
<p>under the wheel, it is sure to be rolling on, and as sure will the
</p>
<p>Saints, sometime be on top of this wheel, if they hang on for their
</p>
<p>fortune in view. If it was not for the tender bonds of love that
</p>
<p>binds me to you, my friends and brethren, death would be sweet to
</p>
<p>me as honey. Our enemies are after me, to trust my life to them,
</p>
<p>by their voucher and honor of the state and that by the Governor
</p>
<p>and authority of the state of Illinois. I therefore will say to you
</p>
<p>Saints and Elders of Israel: Be not troubled nor give yourselves
</p>
<p>uneasiness, so as to make any rash moves or to take any hasty
</p>
<p>steps in doing any ivrong whereby you will be cut short in your
</p>
<p>calling in preaching the Gospel to this generation, for you ivill yet
</p>
<p>be called upon to go forth and call upon the free men from Maine
</p>
<p>to gather themselves together to the Rocky Mountains; and the
</p>
<p>Redmen from the West and all people from the North and from
</p>
<p>the South and from the East, and go to the West, to establish them-
</p>
<p>selves in the strongholds of their gathering places, and there you
</p>
<p>will gather the Redmen to their center from their scattered and
</p>
<p>dispersed situation, to become the strong arm of Jehovah, who will
</p>
<p>be a strong buhvark of protection from your foes. These things
</p>
<p>I feel to tell you beforehand, that you may always be ready for
</p>
<p>your duty, for at this time I need the best of friends to stand by
</p>
<p>me, and on this occasion I would like to know of you all, by your
</p>
<p>own answer, Yes or No, Are you willing to lay down your lives for

<p>me?"

</p>
<p>The answer was then heard with one unanimous voice, "Yes."
</p>
<p>"I am your Father. Shall I not be your Father?" Then all, with
</p>
<p>a loud exclamation said, "Yes." He again said to us : "Now I am will-
</p>
<p>ing to lay my life down for you, and if innocent blood is spilt on this
</p>
<p>occasion" (he then drew his sword out of the scabbard, raising it
</p>
<p>above his head, saying) "I will call upon the mighty Gods to bear
</p>
<p>witness of this; I have drawn my sword and it shall never be
</p>
<p>sheathed again until vengeance is taken on all of our enemies. I
</p>
<p>will call upon the elements in our defense, the winds with the
</p>
<p>whirlwinds, the thunders and lightnings and the hail storms; the
</p>
<p>heavens shall tremble and with earthquakes shall the earth be
</p>
<p>shaken, with the seas heaving themselves beyond their bounds.
</p>
<p>These things shall be brought to bear against our enemies for our
</p>
<p>preservation as a people of the Lord. We have given up our arms
</p>
<p>and they have taken away our right of protection, by our City
</p>
<p>Charter, and now they desire that I shall surrender myself into
</p>
<p>their hands, which I have consented to do. I only go to return to
</p>
<p>you again."

<p>PERSONAL FAREWELLS OF THE PROPHET 157
</p>
<p>With his blessing upon us, we were dismissed to go to our
</p>
<p>homes. Excerpts from Diary of John E. Forsgren.
</p>
<p>THE SISTER OF THE PROPHET TESTIFIES
</p>
<p>The following is from the Carthage, 111., Republican of May 16
</p>
<p>(1894), and will be of more than passing interest to the Latter-day
</p>
<p>Saints, as it relates to the only surviving sister of the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith and to incidents which are deeply impressed in the
</p>
<p>history of the Mormon people:
</p>
<p>A representative of the Republican recently paid a visit to the
</p>
<p>home of Fred Salisbury, residing some four miles northeast of
</p>
<p>Fountain Green, and was cordially received by that gentleman and
</p>
<p>his family, as well as by his venerable and noted mother, Mrs. Cath-
</p>
<p>erine Salisbury, who is a sister of the Prophet Joseph Smith. On the
</p>
<p>27th day of June next will be the fiftieth anniversary of the massacre
</p>
<p>of Hyrum and Joseph Smith in the old stone jail at Carthage. The
</p>
<p>silver-crowned matriarch who will be 88 years old in July, bears a
</p>
<p>striking resemblance to her nephew, the present Joseph Smith, son
</p>
<p>of the Prophet, and president of the Reorganized Church of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ of Latter-day Saints, at Lamoni, Iowa. Some resemblance to
</p>
<p>the martyred Prophet, as shown in some of the photographs of him,
</p>
<p>may be noted in the features of this venerable lady, but very little.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Salisbury, as well as her son, was ready to answer any questions
</p>
<p>relating to their noted relatives or the early reminiscences of Mor-
</p>
<p>monism in Hancock County. "We have been interviewed by authors
</p>
<p>and newspaper writers/' said Mrs. Salisbury, "but we have not always
</p>
<p>received justice in histories or published stories. All we ask is a fair
</p>
<p>representation."
</p>
<p>Mrs. Salisbury also stated that her brother's life and acts had
</p>
<p>been most cruelly misrepresented. She loaned the writer a book
</p>
<p>written a number of years ago by Mrs. Lucy Smith, mother of
</p>
<p>Joseph, which she says is the most authentic account of the Smith
</p>
<p>family ever published. Mrs. Salisbury resided with her husband at
</p>
<p>Plymouth, in this county, during the Mormon ascendancy. She with

</p>
<p>the time the Mormons were driven out of Missouri. The major por-
</p>
<p>tion of the Mormons remained in Quincy two or three weeks after
</p>
<p>leaving Missouri until Joseph and Hyrum were liberated from jail.
</p>
<p>They then followed their leaders to Nauvoo, where the "New Zion"
</p>
<p>was built upon these beautiful hills.
</p>
<p>"I heard brother Joseph's last sermon, delivered to a great
</p>
<p>audience in Nauvoo," said Mrs. Salisbury, and a look of tender
</p>
<p>sadness lighted up those dimming eyes as she spoke. "In that ser-
</p>
<p>mon," continued the venerable lady, "Brother Joseph said that
</p>
<p>there was seated on the speaker's stand beside him those who were
</p>
<p>conspiring to take his life, and ivho would be responsible for his
</p>
<p>death"
</p>
<p>Among the valuable relics exhibited to the visitor was a por-
</p>
<p>trait of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, standing facing each other,
</p>
<p>dressed in the peculiar costumes worn by them as Prophets of the
</p>
<p>Church. "That is the position they assumed the last time I ever
</p>
<p>saw my brothers, " said Mrs. Salisbury, "I left them on the Satur-
</p>
<p>day (June 22, 1844) before the Thursday that they were murdered
</p>
<p>at Carthage. Brother Joseph shook my hand saying, "Sister Cath-
</p>
<p>erine as soon as this trouble blows over I will come down to
</p>
<p>Plymouth and make you a visit." Brother Hyrum simply said,
</p>
<p>158 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>"Good-bye" in an impressive manner. I never saw them again in
</p>
<p>life. They were both very kind to me and whenever there was a
</p>
<p>church celebration or any big doings at Nauvoo they would always
</p>
<p>send for me." Millennial Star, 56:549-551.

<p>FOREBODINGS OF THE MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>By Wilford Woodruff
</p>
<p>While delivering an interesting address before the Female
</p>
<p>Relief Society of Nauvoo, he said, As he had this opportunity he
</p>
<p>was going to instruct the society, and point out the way for them to
</p>
<p>conduct themselves, that they might act according to the will of
</p>
<p>God ; that he did not know that he should have many opportunities
</p>
<p>of teaching them, as they were going to be left to themselves ; they
</p>
<p>would not have him to instruct them; that the church would not
</p>
<p>have his instructions long, and the world would not be troubled
</p>
<p>with him a great while, nor have his teachings; he spoke of de-
</p>
<p>livering the keys to others, and that, according to his prayers, God
</p>
<p>had appointed him elsewhere.
</p>
<p>The Prophet called the quorum of the twelve together several
</p>
<p>months before his death, and informed them that the Lord had
</p>
<p>commanded him to hasten their endowments; that he did not ex-
</p>
<p>pect to remain himself to see the temple completed, but wished to
</p>
<p>confer the keys of the kingdom of God upon other men, that they
</p>
<p>might build up the church and kingdom according to the pattern
</p>
<p>given. And the Prophet stood before the twelve from day to day,
</p>
<p>clothed with the spirit and power of God, and instructed them in
</p>
<p>the oracles of God, in the pattern of heavenly things, in the keys
</p>
<p>of the kingdom, the power of the priesthood, and in the knowledge
</p>
<p>of the last dispensation in the fullness of times.

<p>he organized this Church. He also was slain. But before he died
</p>
<p>he organized the Church with Apostles, Patriarchs, Pastors, Teach-
</p>
<p>ers, and the whole government of the Church of God; and that
</p>
<p>Priesthood he organized or laid the foundation of which remained
</p>
<p>with the people after his death. The Twelve Apostles stood next to
</p>
<p>the First Presidency of the Church; and I am a living witness
</p>
<p>myself to this work. I am a living witness to the testimony that he
</p>
<p>gave to the Twelve Apostles when all of us received our endow-
</p>
<p>ments under his hands. I remember the last speech that he ever
</p>
<p>gave us before his death. It was before we started upon our mis-
</p>
<p>sion to the East. He stood upon his feet some two or three hours.
</p>
<p>The room was filled as with consuming fire, his face was as clear
</p>
<p>as amber, and he was clothed upon by the power of God. He laid
</p>
<p>before us our duty. He laid before us the fullness of this great work
</p>
<p>PERSONAL FAREWELLS OF THE PROPHET 159
</p>
<p>of God; and in his remarks to us he said: "I have sealed upon!
</p>
<p>my head every key, every power, every principle of life and salva-
</p>
<p>tion that God has ever given to any man who ever lived upon the
</p>
<p>face of the earth. And these principles and this priesthood and
</p>
<p>power belong to this great and last dispensation which the God of
</p>
<p>Heaven has set His hand to establish in the earth." "Now," said he,
</p>
<p>addressing the Twelve, "I have sealed upon your heads every key,
</p>
<p>every power, and every principle which the Lord has sealed upon
</p>
<p>my head." Continuing, he said, "I have lived so long  up to the
</p>
<p>present time  I have been in the midst of this people, and in the
</p>
<p>great work of labor and redemption. I have desired to live to see
</p>
<p>this Temple (at Nauvoo) built. But I shall never live to see it com-
</p>
<p>pleted; but you will." Now, we did not suppose but what he
</p>
<p>would live. We did not comprehend what he meant. Neither did
</p>
<p>the Twelve in the days of the Savior comprehend what He meant
</p>
<p>when He said, "I am going away from you ; if I go not the Com-
</p>
<p>forter will not come unto you." So we did not understand Joseph
</p>
<p>when he said that he would not live to see that Temple completed ;
</p>
<p>it was not given to us to realize it at that time.
</p>
<p>After addressing us in this manner he said: "I tell you the
</p>
<p>burden of this kingdom now rests upon your shoulders ; you have
</p>
<p>got to bear it off in all the world, and if you don't do it you will be
</p>
<p>damned." That was pretty strong language, but it was full of
</p>
<p>meaning, it was full of significance. Joseph was trained in the
</p>
<p>Priesthood before he came to this planet. He understood the Priest-
</p>
<p>hood perfectly before he came here. He understood its work and
</p>
<p>its lineage, so far as lineage applies to offices in the Priesthood.
</p>
<p>He also understood that he was going away from this earth; but
</p>
<p>we did not know it until after he was put to death. I was in Boston
</p>
<p>with President Young the very hour that he and his brother Hyrum
</p>
<p>were slain. And at that moment there was a power of darkness
</p>
<p>surrounded us, a feeling of heaviness that I never felt before. I
</p>
<p>had never seen President Young feel so bad in my life as he did

</p>
<p>MERCY R. THOMPSON DESCRIBES THE PARTING
</p>
<p>PRIOR TO THE MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>I was present at a prayer meeting held in the upper room of
</p>
<p>the brick-stone building, at a time when his enemies were seeking
</p>
<p>his life.
</p>
<p>At another time  a time never to be forgotten  I was present
</p>
<p>at a meeting when Joseph knelt down with the small congregation
</p>
<p>surrounding him, when every sentence he uttered seemed to con-
</p>
<p>vey to my mind, and to the minds of others present, the impression
</p>
<p>that this was our last meeting together  and so it was.
</p>
<p>It seemed to me that there was nothing forgotten or omitted
</p>
<p>by him, at that time, which pertained either to himself or the
</p>
<p>Church generally. A few days after this he called at his brother
</p>
<p>Hyrum's to take leave of the family previous to their crossing the
</p>
<p>Mississippi River, intending to go west to the Rocky Mountains to
</p>
<p>160 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>seek out, if possible, a place of peace and safety for the Saints.
</p>
<p>His parting words to my sister Mary, as she wept at their going,
</p>
<p>were these :
</p>
<p>"Sister Mary, don't feel bad, the Lord will take care of you,
</p>
<p>and He will deliver us, but I do not know how." The two brothers
</p>
<p>then started to cross the river, not knowing whether they would
</p>
<p>ever see their homes again or not. But on account of the feelings
</p>
<p>expressed by some of the brethren, who should have been their
</p>
<p>truest friends, and by their urgent request, sent after them, the
</p>
<p>brothers returned to Nauvoo the following day. Watching from a
</p>
<p>chamber window I saw them being rowed in a skiff across the river,
</p>
<p>until they landed, and walked up the river bank to Hyrum's house,
</p>
<p>where they both entered, Joseph seating himself, while Hyrum
</p>
<p>made some changes in his clothing, when they both went on to
</p>
<p>the Mansion.
</p>
<p>Although I did not know that the brothers had returned home
</p>
<p>to be taken as "lambs to the slaughter," my feelings were indescrib-
</p>
<p>able, and the very air seemed burdened with sorrowful forebodings.
</p>
<p>The awful scene at Carthage followed in a few days, and here
</p>
<p>all men must draw the veil, for until all the truth concerning these
</p>
<p>good men, and this black deed of their murderous foes, can be told
</p>
<p>and understood the history of this time will not be written. But
</p>
<p>the day will come when God will speak, and the Martyrs and their
</p>
<p>history shall be known. Instructor, 27:400.
</p>
<p>THE PROPHET'S LAST ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE
</p>
<p>After the city had been declared under martial law, the Legion
</p>
<p>was drawn up in front of the mansion to be addressed by the Proph-
</p>
<p>et. He stood upon the frame of a building opposite his house,
</p>
<p>dressed in his full uniform as Lieutenant-General.
</p>
<p>William W. Phelps read from an extra issue of the Warsaw
</p>
<p>Signal* of the day before, calling upon all the old citizens to assist
</p>
<p>*The Warsaw Signal, edited by an infamous man by the name of Thomas
</p>
<p>Sharp, took a prominent and diabolical part in arousing the spirit of murder.

<p>It published the minutes of mob meetings and resolutions adopted there, in
</p>
<p>which the most fiendish threats were made. Some of them are as follows:
</p>
<p>"We therefore declare that we will sustain our press and the editor at
</p>
<p>all hazards; that we will take full vengeance, terrible vengeance, should the
</p>
<p>lives of any of our citizens be lost in the effort; that we hold ourselves at all
</p>
<p>times in readiness to co-operate with our fellow-citizens in this state, Missouri
</p>
<p>and Iowa, to exterminate, utterly exterminate the wicked and abominable Mor-
</p>
<p>mon leaders, the authors of our troubles.
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed forthwith to notify all
</p>
<p>persons in our township suspected of being the tools of the Prophet to leave
</p>
<p>immediately on pain of instant vengeance. And we do recommend the inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants of the adjacent townships to do the same, hereby pledging ourselves to
</p>
<p>render all the assistance they may require.
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That the time, in our opinion has arrived, when the adherents
</p>
<p>of Smith, as a body, should be driven from the surrounding settlements into
</p>
<p>Nauvoo. That the Prophet and his miscreant adherents should then be de-
</p>
<p>manded at their hands; and, if not surrendered, a war of extermination should
</p>
<p>be waged, to the entire destruction, if necessary for our protection, of his ad-
</p>
<p>herents. And we do hereby recommend this resolution to the consideration of
</p>
<p>the several townships, to the mass convention to be held at Carthage, hereby
</p>
<p>pledging ourselves to aid to the utmost the complete consummation of the
</p>
<p>PERSONAL FAREWELLS OF THE PROPHET 16]
</p>
<p>the mob in exterminating the leaders of the Saints and driving the
</p>
<p>people into exile.
</p>
<p>Joseph then recounted the doings of the time at Nauvoo, and
</p>
<p>demonstrated that he and his brethren had been willing and were
</p>
<p>still as willing as ever to submit to the authority of law ; that they
</p>
<p>had not transgressed the statutes; and that the effort making
</p>
<p>against them was the device of Satan. He told them that a pre-
</p>
<p>text had been sought by their enemies in order that a band of in-
</p>
<p>furiated mob-men might be congregated to fall upon Nauvoo, to
</p>
<p>murder, plunder and ravish the innocent.
</p>
<p>The vast assemblage had listened to his words with breathless
</p>
<p>attention, for he spoke with a power transcending anything that
</p>
<p>the Saints had ever before heard, even from him whose speech was
</p>
<p>always soul-touching. Had he expressed a wish to fight, his people
</p>
<p>would have followed him with joy to the contest. It is no wonder
</p>
<p>that his words sank deep into their hearts ; it is no wonder that to
</p>
<p>their sight he appeared grander than mortal. It was the last time
</p>
<p>for many of them in the flesh that they were to listen to the music
</p>
<p>of his voice or to feel the spell of his mighty inspiration. It was
</p>
<p>his last public address ! In a few short days that god-like form, so
</p>
<p>perfect in its manly beauty, was to be locked in the embrace of the
</p>
<p>tomb ; and that voice, whose angelic sweetness had comforted them
</p>
<p>in the hour of darkest woe, was to be hushed in death.
</p>
<p>On the 20th of June he wrote to all the Apostles who were
</p>
<p>absent on missions to come home immediately. Only two of the
</p>
<p>Twelve were with him, Apostle John Taylor and Willard Richards.
</p>
<p>He had often stated to the Twelve that upon them would devolve
</p>
<p>the work when he was gone, and he knew that their presence would
</p>
<p>soon be needed. His consciousness of his impending fate and his
</p>
<p>fortitude were divine. His last deeds and his last thoughts were
</p>
<p>for the cause and the people whom he loved.

</p>
<p>About this time, Joseph wrote also to those of the Twelve
</p>
<p>Apostles who were absent on missions, to come home immediately,
</p>
<p>as he was anxious to have them with him ; for he felt that trouble

<p>He was anxious to get Hyrum, his brother, out of the way.
</p>
<p>He advised him to take his family on the next steamboat to Cincin-
</p>
<p>nati. If anything happened to himself, he was anxious that Hyrum
</p>
<p>should live. Said he : "I wish I could get Hyrum out of the way, so
</p>
<p>that he may live to avenge my blood ; and I will stay with you and
</p>
<p>object in view, that we may thereby be utterly relieved of the alarm, anxiety

<p>see it out." But Hyrum could not be moved. If Joseph suffered and
</p>
<p>died, he was determined to suffer and die with him. Said he to the
</p>
<p>prophet : "Joseph, I cannot leave you." Instructor, Vol. 15.
</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Instructs the Twelve to Return to Nauvoo
</p>
<p>Dear Brother B. Young: Nauvoo, June 17, 1844.
</p>
<p>There has been for several days a great excitement among the
</p>
<p>inhabitants in the adjoining counties. Mass meetings are held upon
</p>
<p>mass meetings, drawing up resolutions to utterly exterminate the
</p>
<p>saints. The excitement has been gotten up by the Laws, Fosters and
</p>
<p>the Higbees, and they themselves have left the city, and are engaged
</p>
<p>in the mob. They have sent their runners into the State of Missouri
</p>
<p>to excite them to murder and bloodshed, and the report is that a
</p>
<p>great many hundreds of them will come over to take an active part
</p>
<p>in murdering the saints. The excitement is very great indeed.
</p>
<p>It is thought by myself and others for you to return without
</p>
<p>delay, and the rest of the Twelve and all the Elders that have gone
</p>
<p>out from this place, and as many more good, faithful men as feel
</p>
<p>disposed to come up with them. Let wisdom be exercised ; and what-
</p>
<p>ever they do, do it without a noise. You know we are not frightened,
</p>
<p>but think it best to be well prepared and be ready for the onset ; and
</p>
<p>if it is extermination, extermination it is of course. Communicate
</p>
<p>to the others of the Twelve with as much speed as possible, with
</p>
<p>perfect stillness and calmness. A word to the wise is sufficient,
</p>
<p>and a little powder, lead and a good rifle, can be packed in your
</p>
<p>luggage very easy without creating any suspicion.
</p>
<p>In haste, I remain yours in the firm bonds of the new and
</p>
<p>everlasting covenant. Hyrum Smith.
</p>
<p>Large bodies of armed men, cannon and munitions of war are
</p>
<p>coming on from Missouri in steamboats. These facts are communi-
</p>
<p>cated to the Governor and President of the United States, and you
</p>
<p>will readily see that you will have to prepare for the onset.
</p>
<p>In the bonds of the new and everlasting covenant, I remain
</p>
<p>yours, Joseph Smith.

</p>
<p>The reader should bear in mind that not only the entire quo-
</p>
<p>rum of the Twelve, excepting John Taylor and Willard Richards,
</p>
<p>were scattered on missions in the States east, but that about five
</p>
<p>hundred of the ablest, strong-willed Elders were also from home
</p>
<p>on the same campaign. To this fact, indeed, is largely to be ascribed
</p>
<p>the opportunity of the martyrdom. It was Brigham Young's re-
</p>
<p>peated affirmation ever after the death of his chief, that, had he,
</p>
<p>with the Twelve, been home, Joseph should not have been given up.

<p>THE PROPHET JOSEPH HAD COMPLETED HIS WORK
</p>
<p>By Parley P. Pratt
</p>
<p>This great and good man was led, before his death, to call
</p>
<p>the Twelve together from time to time and to instruct them in all
</p>
<p>PERSONAL FAREWELLS OF THE PROPHET 163
</p>
<p>things pertaining to the kingdom, ordinances and government of
</p>
<p>God. He often observed that he was laying the foundation, but it
</p>
<p>would remain for the Twelve to complete the building. Said he:
</p>
<p>"I know not why; but for some reason I am constrained to hasten
</p>
<p>my preparations, and to confer upon the Twelve all the ordinances,
</p>
<p>keys, covenants, endowments, and sealing ordinances of the priest-
</p>
<p>hood, and so set before them a pattern in all things pertaining to
</p>
<p>the sanctuary and the endowment therein."
</p>
<p>Having done this, he rejoiced exceedingly; "for," said he, "the
</p>
<p>Lord is about to lay the burden on your shoulders and let me rest
</p>
<p>awhile; and if they kill me," continued he, "the kingdom of God
</p>
<p>will roll on, as I have now finished the ivork which was laid upon
</p>
<p>me, by committing to you all things for the building up of the king-
</p>
<p>dom according to the heavenly vision, and the pattern shown me
</p>
<p>from heaven" With many conversations like this he comforted the
</p>
<p>minds of the Twelve, and prepared them for what was soon to
</p>
<p>follow. Millennial Star, 5:151.
</p>
<p>THE PROPHETS TESTIMONY IN CARTHAGE JAIL
</p>
<p>Joseph bore a powerful testimony to the guards of the divine
</p>
<p>authenticity of the Book of Mormon, the restoration of the Gospel,
</p>
<p>the administration of angels, and that the kingdom of God was
</p>
<p>again established upon the earth, for the sake of which he was
</p>
<p>then incarcerated in that prison, and not because he had violated
</p>
<p>any law of God or man.
</p>
<p>Said Joseph, "Our lives have already become jeopardized by
</p>
<p>revealing the wicked and bloodthirsty purposes of our enemies;
</p>
<p>and for the future we must cease to do so. All we have said about
</p>
<p>them is truth, but it is not always wise to relate all the truth. Even
</p>
<p>Jesus, the Son of God had to refrain from doing so, and had to
</p>
<p>restrain His feelings many times for the safety of Himself and
</p>
<p>His followers, and had to conceal the righteous purposes of His
</p>
<p>heart in relation to many things pertaining to His Father's king-
</p>
<p>dom. When still a boy He had all the intelligence necessary to

</p>
<p>enable Him to rule and govern the kingdom of the Jews, and could
</p>
<p>reason with the wisest and most profound doctors of law and
</p>
<p>divinity, and make their theories and practice to appear like folly
</p>
<p>compared with the wisdom He possessed; but He was a boy only,
</p>
<p>and lacked physical strength even to defend His own person, and
</p>
<p>was subject to cold, to hunger and to death. So it is with the
</p>
<p>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ; we have the revelation
</p>
<p>of Jesus, and the knowledge within us is sufficient to organize a
</p>
<p>righteous government upon the earth, and to give universal peace
</p>
<p>to all mankind, if they would receive it, but we lack the physical
</p>
<p>strength, as did our Savior when a child, to defend our principles,
</p>
<p>and we have of necessity to be afflicted, persecuted and smitten,
</p>
<p>and to bear it patiently until Jacob is of age, then he will take
</p>
<p>care of himself." d. H. C. 6:600, 608.

<p>of many friends:
</p>
<p>Carthage, June 27, 1844.
</p>
<p>A shower of musket balls were thrown up the stairway against
</p>
<p>the door of the prison in the second story, followed by many rapid
</p>
<p>footsteps.
</p>
<p>While Generals Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Mr. Taylor and
</p>
<p>myself, who were in the front chamber, closed the door of our
</p>
<p>room against the entry at the head of the stairs, and placed our-
</p>
<p>selves against it, there being no lock on the door, and no catch
</p>
<p>that was useable.
</p>
<p>The door is a common panel, and as soon as we heard the feet at
</p>
<p>the stairs head, a ball was sent through the door, which passed
</p>
<p>between us, and showed that our enemies were desperadoes, and
</p>
<p>we must change our position.
</p>
<p>General Joseph Smith, Mr. Taylor, and myself sprang back to
</p>
<p>the front part of the room and General Hyrum Smith retreated
</p>
<p>two-thirds across the chamber directly in front of and facing the
</p>
<p>door.
</p>
<p>A ball was sent through the door which hit Hyrum on the
</p>
<p>side of his nose, when he fell backwards, extended at length, with-
</p>
<p>out moving his feet.
</p>
<p>From the holes in his vest (the day was warm, and no one had
</p>
<p>their coats on but myself), pantaloons, drawers, and shirt, it ap-
</p>
<p>peared evident that a ball must have been thrown from without,
</p>
<p>through the window, which entered his back on the right side,
</p>
<p>and passing through lodged against his watch, which was in his
</p>
<p>right vest pocket, completely pulverizing the crystal and face,
</p>
<p>tearing off the hands and mashing the whole body of the watch.

</p>
<p>At the same instant the ball from the door entered his nose.
</p>
<p>As he struck the floor he exclaimed emphatically, "I'm a dead
</p>
<p>man." Joseph looked towards him and responded, "Oh dear ! Brother
</p>
<p>Hyrum," and opening the door two or three inches with his left
</p>
<p>hand, discharged one barrel of a six-shooter (pistol) at random in
</p>
<p>the entry, from whence a ball grazed Hyrum's breast, and enter-
</p>
<p>ing his throat passed into his head, while other muskets were
</p>
<p>aimed at him and some balls hit him.
</p>
<p>Joseph continued snapping his revolver round the casing of
</p>
<p>the door into the space as before, three barrels of which missed
</p>
<p>fire, while Mr. Taylor with a walking stick stood by his side and
</p>
<p>knocked down the bayonets and muskets which were constantly
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 165
</p>
<p>discharging through the doorway, while I stood by him, ready to
</p>
<p>lend any assistance, with another stick, but could not come within
</p>
<p>striking distance without going directly before the muzzles of the
</p>
<p>guns.
</p>
<p>When the revolver failed, we had no more firearms, and ex-
</p>
<p>pected an immediate rush of the mob, and the doorway full of
</p>
<p>muskets, half way in the room, and no hope but instant death from
</p>
<p>within.
</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor rushed into the window, which is some fifteen or
</p>
<p>twenty feet from the ground. When his body was nearly on a bal-
</p>
<p>ance, a ball from the door within entered his leg, and a ball from
</p>
<p>without struck his watch, a patent lever, in his vest pocket near
</p>
<p>the left breast, and smashed it into pi, leaving the hands standing
</p>
<p>at 5 o'clock, 16 minutes, and 26 seconds, the force of which ball
</p>
<p>threw him back on the floor, and he rolled under the bed which
</p>
<p>stood by his side, where he lay motionless, the mob from the door
</p>
<p>continuing to fire upon him, cutting away a piece of flesh from his
</p>
<p>left hip as large as a man's hand, and were hindered only by my
</p>
<p>knocking down their muzzles with a stick; while they continued
</p>
<p>to reach their guns into the room, probably left handed, and aimed
</p>
<p>their discharge so far round as almost to reach us in the corner
</p>
<p>of the room to where we retreated and dodged, and then I recom-
</p>
<p>menced the attack with my stick.
</p>
<p>Joseph attempted, as the last resort, to leap the same window
</p>
<p>from whence Mr. Taylor fell, when two balls pierced him from the
</p>
<p>door, and one entered his right breast from without, and he fell
</p>
<p>outward, exclaiming, "0 Lord, my God." As his feet went out of
</p>
<p>the window my head went in, the balls whistling all around. He
</p>
<p>fell on his left side a dead man.
</p>
<p>At this instant the cry was raised, "He's leaped the window"
</p>
<p>and the mob on the stairs and in the entry ran out.
</p>
<p>I withdrew from the window, thinking it of no use to leap out
</p>
<p>on a hundred bayonets, then around General Smith's body.

</p>
<p>Not satisfied with this I again reached my head out of the
</p>
<p>window, and watched some seconds to see if there were any signs
</p>
<p>of life, regardless of my own, determined to see the end of him I
</p>
<p>loved. Being fully satisfied that he was dead, with a hundred men
</p>
<p>near the body and more coming round the corner of the jail, and
</p>
<p>expecting a return to our room, I rushed towards the prison door,
</p>
<p>at the head of the stairs, and through the entry from whence the
</p>
<p>firing had proceeded, to learn if the doors into the prison were
</p>
<p>open.
</p>
<p>When near the entry, Mr. Taylor cried out, "Take me." I
</p>
<p>pressed my way until I found all doors unbarred, returning in-
</p>
<p>stantly, caught Mr. Taylor under my arm, and rushed by the stairs
</p>
<p>into the dungeon, or inner prison, stretched him on the floor and
</p>
<p>covered him with a bed in such a manner as not likely to be per-
</p>
<p>ceived, expecting an immediate return of the mob. I said to Mr.
</p>
<p>Taylor. "This is a hard case to lay you on the floor, but if your
</p>
<p>wounds are not fatal, I want you to live to tell the story." I ex-
</p>
<p>pected to be shot the next moment, and stood before the door
</p>
<p>awaiting the onset. D.H.C., 7:619-21.

<p>WELL AT CARTHAGE JAIL IN 1855.
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 167
</p>
<p>AN ACCOUNT OF THE MARTYRDOM OF JOSEPH SMITH
</p>
<p>By President John Taylor
</p>
<p>Being requested by Elders George A. Smith and Wilf ord Wood-
</p>
<p>ruff, Church historians, to write an account of events that trans-
</p>
<p>pired before, and took place at, the time of the martyrdom of
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, in Carthage jail, in Hancock County, State of
</p>
<p>Illinois, I write the following, principally from memory, not having
</p>
<p>CARTHAGE JAIL
</p>
<p>The two illustrations opposite were sketched by Frederick Piercy in 1855,
</p>
<p>and were reproduced in the book: "Route from Liverpool to Great Salt Lake
</p>
<p>Valley." It is very probable that the jail and well looked exactly in 1844 as
</p>
<p>in 1855. Special attention is directed to the well, it was against it that the
</p>
<p>Prophet was set when four of the mob shot him.
</p>
<p>In the book above quoted, Mr. Piercey says: "The landlord of the tavern
</p>
<p>(Hamilton House) took me to the jail and obtained admittance for me. The
</p>
<p>keeper was away, and I was shown over it by a young girl. The holes made
</p>
<p>in the wall by the bullets still remain unstopped. The bullet hole in the door
</p>
<p>is that made by the ball which caused the death of Hyrum. I was told that the
</p>
<p>stains of blood were still in the floor, but I could not see them, as the room was
</p>
<p>covered by a carpet. *** Having seen the place and made my sketches, I was
</p>
<p>glad to leave. Two lives unatoned for, and 'blood crying from the ground,'
</p>
<p>made the spot hateful."
</p>
<p>****
</p>
<p>Carthage jail was erected in 1839-40 by Wm. Metcalf as contractor, at a
</p>
<p>cost of $4,105.00. It is constructed of yellow limestone, taken from a quarry
</p>
<p>four miles northeast of the building. In 1866 Hancock county sold the jail to
</p>
<p>Bryant F. Petersen for $1,100.00. He sold it to James M. Browning for
</p>
<p>$1500.00. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through President
</p>
<p>Joseph F. Smith as trustee-in-trust, purchased it from Mrs. Eliza M. Browning,
</p>
<p>widow of James M. Browning, for $4,000, by deed dated November 4, (1903).
</p>
<p>There are three rooms on the ground floor: a living room, dining room and
</p>
<p>the debtor's room, with an attached kitchen which is seen in both illustrations
</p>
<p>of the jail produced in this book. The upper story contained the jailor's bed-

<p>room in which the Prophet and his three companions were at the time of the
</p>
<p>martyrdom, and the cell room (12' x 24Vz') to the north of the stair landing
</p>
<p>which was partitioned by bars. It was in this cell room that Willard Richards
</p>
<p>carried John Taylor at the time of the tragedy.
</p>
<p>(See booklet published by Joseph A. McRae, entitled: "The Historic Carth-
</p>
<p>age Jail."
</p>
<p>access at this time to any public documents relative thereto farther
</p>
<p>than a few desultory items contained in Ford's "History of Illi-
</p>
<p>nois. " I must also acknowledge myself considerably indebted to
</p>
<p>George A. Smith who was with me when I wrote it, and who, aj-
</p>
<p>though not there at the time of the bloody transaction, yet, from
</p>
<p>conversing with several persons who were in the capacity of
</p>
<p>Church historians, and aided by an excellent memory, has rendered
</p>
<p>me considerable service.
</p>
<p>These and the few items contained in the note at the end of
</p>
<p>this account are all the aid I have had. I would further add that the
</p>
<p>items contained in the letter, in relation to dates especially, may be
</p>
<p>considered strictly correct.
</p>
<p>168 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>After having written the whole, I read it over to the Hon.
</p>
<p>J. M. Bernhisel, who with one or two slight alterations, pronounced
</p>
<p>it strictly correct. Brother Bernhisel was present most of the time.
</p>
<p>I am afraid that, from the length of time that has transpired since
</p>
<p>the occurrence, and having to rely almost exclusively upon my
</p>
<p>memory, there may be some slight inaccuracies, but I believe that
</p>
<p>in the general it is strictly correct. As I figured in those trans-
</p>
<p>actions from the commencement to the end, they left no slight im-
</p>
<p>pression on my mind.
</p>
<p>In the year 1844, a very great excitement prevailed in some
</p>
<p>parts of Hancock, Brown and other neighboring counties of Illinois,
</p>
<p>in relation to the Mormons, and a spirit of vindictive hatred and
</p>
<p>persecution was exhibited among the people, which was manifested
</p>
<p>in the most bitter and acrimonious language, as well as by acts of
</p>
<p>hostility and violence, frequently threatening the destruction of
</p>
<p>the citizens of Nauvoo and vicinity, and utter annihilation of the
</p>
<p>Mormons and Mormonism, and in some instances breaking out in
</p>
<p>the most violent acts of ruffianly barbarity. Persons were kid-
</p>
<p>napped, whipped, persecuted and falsely accused of various crimes ;
</p>
<p>their cattle and houses injured, destroyed, or stolen; vexatious
</p>
<p>prosecutions were instituted to harass and annoy. In some remote
</p>
<p>neighborhoods they were expelled from their homes without re-
</p>
<p>dress, and in others violence was threatened to their persons and
</p>
<p>property, while in others every kind of insult and indignity were
</p>
<p>heaped upon them, to induce them to abandon their homes, the
</p>
<p>County or the State.
</p>
<p>These annoyances, prosecutions and persecutions were insti-
</p>
<p>gated through different agencies and by various classes of men,
</p>
<p>actuated by different motives, but all uniting in the one object
</p>
<p> prosecution, persecution and extermination of the Saints.
</p>
<p>There were a number of wicked and corrupt men living in
</p>
<p>Nauvoo and its vicinity, who had belonged to the Church, but
</p>
<p>whose conduct was incompatible with the Gospel; they were ac-

</p>
<p>cordingly dealt with by the Church and severed from its com-
</p>
<p>munion. Some of these had been prominent members, and held
</p>
<p>official stations either in the city or Church. Among these were
</p>
<p>John C. Bennett, formerly mayor; William Law, counselor to
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith; Wilson Law, his natural brother, and general in
</p>
<p>the Nauvoo Legion; Dr. R. D. Foster, a man of some property,
</p>
<p>but with a very bad reputation; Francis and Chauncey Higbee,
</p>
<p>the latter a young lawyer, and both sons of a respectable and
</p>
<p>honored man in the Church, known as Judge Elias Higbee, who
</p>
<p>died about twelve months before.
</p>
<p>Besides these, there were a great many apostates, both in
</p>
<p>the city and county, of less notoriety, who for their delinquen-
</p>
<p>cies, had been expelled from the Church. John C. Bennett and
</p>
<p>Francis and Chauncey Higbee were cut off from the Church; the
</p>
<p>former was also cashiered from his generalship for the most
</p>
<p>flagrant acts of seduction and adultery; and the developments
</p>
<p>in the cases were so scandalous that the High Council, before
</p>
<p>which they were tried, had to sit with closed doors.
</p>
<p>William Law, although counselor to Joseph, was found to be
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 169
</p>
<p>his most bitter foe and maligner, and to hold intercourse, con-
</p>
<p>trary to all law, in his own house, with a young lady resident
</p>
<p>with him; and it was afterwards proven that he had conspired
</p>
<p>with some Missourians to take Joseph Smith's life, and was only
</p>
<p>saved by Josiah Arnold and Daniel Garn, who, being on guard
</p>
<p>at his house, prevented the assassins from seeing him. Yet, al-
</p>
<p>though having murder in his heart, his manners were generally
</p>
<p>courteous and mild, and he was well calculated to deceive.
</p>
<p>General Wilson Law was cut off from the Church for seduc-
</p>
<p>tion, falsehood, and defamation; both the above were also court-
</p>
<p>martialed by the Nauvoo Legion, and expelled. Foster was also
</p>
<p>cut off I believe, for dishonesty, fraud and falsehood. I know he
</p>
<p>was eminently guilty of the whole, but whether these were the
</p>
<p>specific charges or not, I don't know, but I do know that he was
</p>
<p>a notoriously wicked and corrupt man.
</p>
<p>Besides the above characters and Mormonic apostates, there
</p>
<p>were three other parties. The first of these may be called religion-
</p>
<p>ists, the second politicians, and the third counterfeiters, black-
</p>
<p>legs, horse-thieves and cut-throats.
</p>
<p>The religious party were chagrined and maddened because
</p>
<p>Mormonism came in contact with their religion, and they could
</p>
<p>not oppose it from the scriptures. Thus like the ancient Jews,
</p>
<p>when enraged at the exhibition of their follies and hypocrisies
</p>
<p>by Jesus and His apostles, so these were infuriated against the
</p>
<p>Mormons because of their discomfiture by them; and instead of
</p>
<p>owning the truth and rejoicing in it, they were ready to gnash
</p>
<p>upon them with their teeth, and to persecute the believers in
</p>
<p>principles which they could not disprove.
</p>
<p>The political party were those who were of opposite politics
</p>
<p>to us. There were always two parties, the Whigs and Democrats,
</p>
<p>and we could not vote for one without offending the other; and it
</p>
<p>not unfrequently happened that candidates for office would place
</p>
<p>the issue of their election upon opposition to the Mormons, in

</p>
<p>order to gain political influence from the religious prejudices, in
</p>
<p>which case the Mormons were compelled, in self-defense, to vote
</p>
<p>against them, which resulted almost invariably against our op-
</p>
<p>ponents. This made them angry; and although it was of their
</p>
<p>own making, and the Mormons could not be expected to do other-
</p>
<p>wise, yet they raged on account of their discomfiture, and sought
</p>
<p>to wreak their fury on the Mormons. As an instance of the above,
</p>
<p>when Joseph Duncan was candidate for the office of governor
</p>
<p>of Illinois, he pledged himself to his party that, if he could be
</p>
<p>elected, he would exterminate or drive the Mormons from the
</p>
<p>State.* The consequence was that Governor Ford was elected.
</p>
<p>The Whigs, seeing that they had been out-generaled by the Demo-
</p>
<p>crats in securing the Mormon vote, became seriously alarmed,
</p>
<p>and sought to repair their disaster by raising a crusade against
</p>
<p>the people. The Whig newspapers teemed with accounts of the
</p>
<p>wonders and enormities of Nauvoo, and of the awful wickedness
</p>
<p>of a party which could consent to receive the support of such mis-
</p>
<p>*See his remarks as contained in his History of Illinois, p. 269.
</p>
<p>170 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>creants. Governor Duncan, who was really a brave, honest man,
</p>
<p>and who had nothing to do with getting the Mormon charters
</p>
<p>passed through the Legislature, took the stump on this subject
</p>
<p>in good earnest, and expected to be elected governor almost on
</p>
<p>this question alone.
</p>
<p>The third party, composed of counterfeiters, black-legs, horse-
</p>
<p>thieves and cut-throats, were a pack of scoundrels that infested
</p>
<p>the whole of the western country at that time. In some districts
</p>
<p>their influence was so great as to control important State and
</p>
<p>County offices. On this subject Governor Ford has the following:
</p>
<p>"Then, again, the northern part of the State was not desti-
</p>
<p>tute of its organized bands of rogues, engaged in murders, rob-
</p>
<p>beries, horse-stealing and in making and passing counterfeit
</p>
<p>money. These rogues were scattered all over the north, but the
</p>
<p>most of them were located in the counties of Ogle, Winnebago,
</p>
<p>Lee and De Kalb.
</p>
<p>"In the County of Ogle they were so numerous, strong, and
</p>
<p>well organized that they could not be convicted for their crimes.
</p>
<p>By getting some of their numbers on the juries, by producing a
</p>
<p>host of witnesses to sustain their defense, by perjured evidence,
</p>
<p>and by changing the venue of one County to another, by con-
</p>
<p>tinuances from term to term, and by the inability of witnesses to
</p>
<p>attend from time to time at distant and foreign Counties, they
</p>
<p>most generally managed to be acquitted."*
</p>
<p>There was a combination of horse-thieves extending from
</p>
<p>Galena to Alton. There were counterfeiters engaged in merchan-
</p>
<p>dising, trading, and store-keeping in most of the cities and vil-
</p>
<p>lages, and in some districts, I have been credibly informed by
</p>
<p>men to whom they have disclosed their secrets, the judges, sheriffs,
</p>
<p>constables, and jailers, as well as professional men, were more
</p>
<p>or less associated with them. These had in their employ the most
</p>
<p>reckless, abandoned wretches, who stood ready to carry into ef-
</p>
<p>fect the most desperate enterprises, and were careless alike of

</p>
<p>human life and property. Their object in persecuting the Mor-
</p>
<p>mons was in part to cover their own rascality, and in part to pre-
</p>
<p>vent them from exposing and prosecuting them; but the principal
</p>
<p>reason was plunder, believing that if they could be removed or
</p>
<p>driven they would be made fat on Mormon spoils, besides having
</p>
<p>in the deserted city a good asylum for the prosecution of their
</p>
<p>diabolical pursuits.
</p>
<p>This conglomeration of apostate Mormons, religious bigots,
</p>
<p>political fanatics and black-legs, all united their forces against
</p>
<p>the Mormons, and organized themselves into a party, denominated
</p>
<p>anti-Mormons. Some of them, we have reason to believe, joined
</p>
<p>the Church in order to cover their infamous practices, and when
</p>
<p>they were expelled for their unrighteousness only raged with
</p>
<p>greater violence. They circulated every kind of falsehood that
</p>
<p>they could collect or manufacture against the Mormons. They
</p>
<p>also had a paper to assist them in their nefarious designs, called
</p>
<p>the Warsaiv Signal, edited by a Mr. Thomas Sharp, a violent and
</p>
<p>* Ford's History of Illinois, p. 246.
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 171
</p>
<p>unprincipled man, who shrunk not from any enormity. The anti-
</p>
<p>Mormons had public meetings, which were very numerously at-
</p>
<p>tended, where they passed resolutions of the most violent and in-
</p>
<p>flammatory kind, threatening to drive, expel and exterminate the
</p>
<p>Mormons from the State, at the same time accusing them of
</p>
<p>every evil in the vocabulary of crime.
</p>
<p>They appointed their meetings in various parts of Hancock,
</p>
<p>M'Donough, and other counties, which soon resulted in the or-
</p>
<p>ganization of armed mobs, under the direction of officers who
</p>
<p>reported to their headquarters, and the reports of which were
</p>
<p>published in the anti-Mormon paper, and circulated through the
</p>
<p>adjoining counties. We also published in the Times and Seasons
</p>
<p>and the Nauvoo Neighbor (two papers published and edited by
</p>
<p>me at that time) an account, not only of their proceedings, but
</p>
<p>our own. But such was the hostile feeling, so well arranged their
</p>
<p>plans, and so desperate and lawless their measures, that it was
</p>
<p>with the greatest difficulty that we could get our papers circu-

<p>lated ; they were destroyed by postmasters and others, and scarcely
</p>
<p>ever arrived at the place of their destination, so that a great
</p>
<p>many of the people, who would have been otherwise peaceable,
</p>
<p>were excited by their misrepresentations, and instigated to join
</p>
<p>their hostile or predatory bands.
</p>
<p>Emboldened by the acts of those outside, the apostate Mor-
</p>
<p>mons, associated with others, commenced the publication of a
</p>
<p>libelous paper in Nauvoo, called the Nauvoo Expositor. This paper
</p>
<p>not only reprinted from the others, but put in circulation the most
</p>
<p>libelous, false, and infamous reports concerning the citizens of
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, and especially the ladies. It was, however, no sooner put
</p>
<p>in circulation than the indignation of the whole community was
</p>
<p>aroused; so much so, that they threatened its annihilation; and
</p>
<p>I do not believe that in any other city of the United States, if the
</p>
<p>same charges had been made against the citizens, it would have
</p>
<p>been permitted to remain one day. As it was among us, under

</p>
<p>these circumstances, it was thought best to convene the city
</p>
<p>council to take into consideration the adoption of some measures
</p>
<p>for its removal, as it was deemed better that this should be done
</p>
<p>legally than illegally. Joseph Smith, therefore, who was mayor,
</p>
<p>convened the city council for that purpose; the paper was intro-
</p>
<p>duced and read, and the subject examined. All, or nearly all pres-
</p>
<p>ent, expressed their indignation at the course taken by the
</p>
<p>Expositor, which was owned by some of the aforesaid apostates,
</p>
<p>associated with one or two others. Wilson Law, Dr. Foster,
</p>
<p>Charles Ivins and the Higbees before referred to, some lawyers,
</p>
<p>storekeepers, and others in Nauvoo who were not Mormons, to-
</p>
<p>gether with the anti-Mormons outside of the city, sustained it.
</p>
<p>The calculation was, by false statements, to unsettle the minds
</p>
<p>of many in the city, and to form combinations there similar to the
</p>
<p>anti-Mormon associations outside of the city. Various attempts
</p>
<p>had heretofore been made by the party to annoy and irritate the
</p>
<p>citizens of Nauvoo; false accusations had been made, vexatious
</p>
<p>lawsuits instituted, threats made, and various devices resorted to,
</p>
<p>to influence the public mind, and, if possible, to provoke us to the
</p>
<p>172 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>commission of some overt act that might make us amenable to
</p>
<p>the law. With a perfect knowledge, therefore, of the designs of
</p>
<p>these infernal scoundrels who were in our midst, as well as those
</p>
<p>who surrounded us, the city council entered upon an investiga-
</p>
<p>tion of the matter. They felt that they were in a critical position,
</p>
<p>and that any move made for the abating of that press would be
</p>
<p>looked upon, or at least represented, as a direct attack upon the
</p>
<p>liberty of speech, and that, so far from displeasing our enemies,
</p>
<p>it would be looked upon by them as one of the best circumstances
</p>
<p>that could transpire to assist them in their nefarious and bloody
</p>
<p>designs. Being a member of the city council, I well remember the
</p>
<p>feeling of responsibility that seemed to rest upon all present; nor
</p>
<p>shall I soon forget the bold, manly, independent expressions of
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith on that occasion in relation to this matter. He ex-
</p>
<p>hibited in glowing colors the meanness, corruption, and ultimate
</p>
<p>designs of the anti-Mormons; their despicable characters and un-
</p>
<p>godly influences, especially of those who were in our midst. He
</p>
<p>told of the responsibility that rested upon us, as guardians of the
</p>
<p>public interest, to stand up in the defense of the injured and op-
</p>
<p>pressed, to stem the current of corruption, and, as men and
</p>
<p>Saints, to put a stop to this flagrant outrage upon this people's
</p>
<p>rights.
</p>
<p>He stated that no man was a stronger advocate for the liberty
</p>
<p>of speech and of the press than himself : yet, when this noble gift
</p>
<p>is utterly prostituted and abused, as in the present instance, it
</p>
<p>loses all claim to our respect, and becomes as great an agent for
</p>
<p>evil as it can possibly be for good; and notwithstanding the ap-
</p>
<p>parent advantage we should give our enemies by this act, yet it
</p>
<p>behooved us, as men, to act independent of all secondary influ-
</p>
<p>ences, to perform the part of men of enlarged minds, and boldly
</p>
<p>and fearlessly to discharge the duties devolving upon us by de-
</p>
<p>claring as a nuisance, and removing this filthy, libelous, and sedi-
</p>
<p>tious sheet from our midst.

<p>The subject was discussed in various forms, and after the
</p>
<p>remarks made by the mayor, every one seemed to be waiting for
</p>
<p>some one else to speak.
</p>
<p>After a considerable pause, I arose and expressed my feelings
</p>
<p>frankly, as Joseph had done, and numbers of others followed in
</p>
<p>the same strain; and I think, but am not certain, that I made a
</p>
<p>motion for the removal of that press as a nuisance. This motion
</p>
<p>was finally put, and carried by all but one; and he conceded that
</p>
<p>the measure was just, but abstained through fear.
</p>
<p>Several members of the city council were not in the Church.
</p>
<p>The following is the bill referred to:
</p>
<p>Bill for Removing of the Press of the "Nauvoo Expositor."*
</p>
<p>Resolved by the city council of the city of Nauvoo, that the printing-
</p>
<p>office from whence issues the Nauvoo Expositor is a public nuisance; and
</p>
<p>also of said Nauvoo Expositors which may be or exist in said establishment;
</p>
<p>and the mayor is instructed to cause said establishment and papers to be
</p>
<p>removed without delay, in such manner as he shall direct.

<p>Passed June 10th, 1844. Geo. W. Harris, President pro tern.

</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 173
</p>
<p>After the passage of the bill, the marshal, John P. Greene,
</p>
<p>was ordered to abate or remove, which he forthwith proceeded to
</p>
<p>do by summoning a posse of men for that purpose. The press
</p>
<p>was removed or broken, I don't remember which, by the marshal,
</p>
<p>and the types scattered in the street.
</p>
<p>This seemed to be one of those extreme cases that require
</p>
<p>extreme measures, as the press was still proceeding in its inflam-
</p>
<p>matory course. It was feared that, as it was almost universally
</p>
<p>execrated, should it continue longer, an indignant people might
</p>
<p>commit some overt act which might lead to serious consequences,
</p>
<p>and that it was better to use legal than illegal means.
</p>
<p>This, as was foreseen, was the very course our enemies wished
</p>
<p>us to pursue, as it afforded them an opportunity of circulating a
</p>
<p>very plausible story about the Mormons being opposed to the
</p>
<p>liberty of the press and of free speech, which they were not slow
</p>
<p>to avail themselves of. Stories were fabricated, and facts per-
</p>
<p>verted; false statements were made, and this act brought in as
</p>
<p>an example to sustain the whole of their fabrications; and, as if
</p>
<p>inspired by Satan, they labored with an energy and zeal worthy
</p>
<p>of a better cause. They had runners to circulate their reports,
</p>
<p>not only through Hancock County, but in all the surrounding
</p>
<p>counties. These reports were communicated to their anti-Mor-
</p>
<p>mon societies, and these societies circulated them in their several
</p>
<p>districts. The anti-Mormon paper, the Warsaw Signal, was filled
</p>
<p>with inflammatory articles and misrepresentations in relation to
</p>
<p>us, and especially to this act of destroying the press. We were
</p>
<p>represented as a horde of lawless ruffians and brigands, anti-
</p>
<p>American and anti-republican, steeped in crime and iniquity, op-
</p>
<p>posed to freedom of speech and of the press, and all the rights
</p>
<p>and immunities of a free and enlightened people; that neither
</p>
<p>person nor property were secure: that we had designs upon the
</p>
<p>citizens of Illinois and of the United States, and the people were
</p>
<p>called upon to rise en masse, and put us down, drive us away, or

</p>
<p>exterminate us as a pest to society, and alike dangerous to our
</p>
<p>neighbors, the State, and commonwealth.
</p>
<p>These statements were extensively copied and circulated
</p>
<p>throughout the United States. A true statement of the facts in
</p>
<p>question was published by us both in the Times and Seasons and
</p>
<p>the Nauvoo Neighbor; but it was found impossible to circulate
</p>
<p>them in the immediate counties, as they were destroyed in the
</p>
<p>post-offices or otherwise by the agents of the anti-Mormons, and
</p>
<p>in order to get the mail to go abroad, I had to send the papers a
</p>
<p>distance of thirty or forty miles from Nauvoo, and sometimes to
</p>
<p>St. Louis (upward of two hundred miles), in insure their pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding on their route, and then one-half or two-thirds of the
</p>
<p>papers never reached the place of destination, being intercepted
</p>
<p>or destroyed by our enemies.
</p>
<p>These false reports stirred up the community around, of whom
</p>
<p>many, on account of religious prejudice, were easily instigated
</p>
<p>to join the anti-Mormons and embark in any crusade that might
</p>
<p>be undertaken against us: hence their ranks swelled in numbers,
</p>
<p>and new organizations were formed, meetings were held, resolu-
</p>
<p>174 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>tions passed, and men and means volunteered for the extirpation
</p>
<p>of the Mormons.
</p>
<p>On these points Governor Ford writes: "These also were the
</p>
<p>active men in blowing up the fury of the people, in hopes that a
</p>
<p>popular movement might be set on foot, which would result in
</p>
<p>the expulsion or extermination of the Mormon voters. For this
</p>
<p>purpose public meetings had been called, inflammatory speeches
</p>
<p>had been made, exaggerated reports had been extensivly circu-
</p>
<p>lated, committees had been appointed, who rode night and day
</p>
<p>to spread the reports and solicit the aid of neighboring counties,
</p>
<p>and at a public meeting at Warsaw resolutions were passed to
</p>
<p>expel or exterminate the Mormon population. This was not, how-
</p>
<p>ever, a movement which was unanimously concurred in. The
</p>
<p>county contained a goodly number of inhabitants in favor of peace,
</p>
<p>or who at least desired to be neutral in such a contest. These were
</p>
<p>stigmatized by the name of Jack-Mormons, and there were not a
</p>
<p>few of the more furious exciters of the people who openly ex-
</p>
<p>pressed their intention to involve them in the common expulsion
</p>
<p>or extermination.
</p>
<p>"A system of excitement and agitation was artfully planned
</p>
<p>and executed with tact. It consisted in spreading reports and
</p>
<p>rumors of the most fearful character. As examples : On the morn-
</p>
<p>ing before my arrival at Carthage, I was awakened at any early
</p>
<p>hour by the frightful report, which was asserted with confidence
</p>
<p>and apparent consternation, that the Mormons had already com-
</p>
<p>menced the work of burning, destruction, and murder, and that
</p>
<p>every man capable of bearing arms was instantly wanted at
</p>
<p>Carthage for the protection of the county.
</p>
<p>"We lost no time in starting ; but when we arrived at Carthage
</p>
<p>we could hear no more concerning this story. Again, during the
</p>
<p>few days that the militia were encamped at Carthage, frequent
</p>
<p>applications were made to me to send a force here, and a force
</p>
<p>there, and a force all about the country, to prevent murders, rob-

<p>beries, and larcenies which, it was said, were threatened by the
</p>
<p>Mormons. No such forces were sent, nor were any such offenses
</p>
<p>committed at that time, except the stealing of some provisions,
</p>
<p>and there was never the least proof that this was done by a
</p>
<p>Mormon. Again, on my late visit to Hancock County, I was in-
</p>
<p>formed by some of their violent enemies that the larcenies of the
</p>
<p>Mormons had become unusually numerous and insufferable.
</p>
<p>"They admitted that but little had been done in this way in their
</p>
<p>immediate vicinity, but they insisted that sixteen horses had been
</p>
<p>stolen by the Mormons in one night near Lima, and, upon inquiry,
</p>
<p>was told that no horses had been stolen in that neighborhood, but
</p>
<p>that sixteen horses had been stolen in one night in Hancock
</p>
<p>County. This last informant being told of the Hancock story,
</p>
<p>again changed the venue to another distant settlement in the
</p>
<p>northern edge of Adams/'*

<p>The council did not refuse to attend to the legal proceedings
</p>
<p>in the case, but as the law of Illinois made it the privilege of the
</p>
<p>persons accused to go "or appear before the issuer of the writ, or
</p>
<p>any other justice of the peace," they requested to be taken before
</p>
<p>another magistrate, either in the city of Nauvoo or at any reason-
</p>
<p>able distance out of it.
</p>
<p>This the constable, who was a mobocrat, refused to do ; and as
</p>
<p>this was our legal privilege we refused to be dragged, contrary to
</p>
<p>law, a distance of eighteen miles, when at the same time we had
</p>
<p>reason to believe that an organized band of mobocrats were as-
</p>
<p>sembled for the purpose of extermination or murder, and among
</p>
<p>whom it would not be safe to go without a superior force of armed
</p>
<p>men. A writ of habeas corpus was called for, and issued by the

</p>
<p>municipal court of Nauvoo, taking us out of the hands of Bettes-
</p>
<p>worth, and placing us in the charge of the city marshal. We went
</p>
<p>before the municipal court and were dismissed. Our refusal to obey
</p>
<p>this illegal proceeding was by them construed into a refusal to
</p>
<p>submit to law, and circulated as such, and the people either did
</p>
<p>believe, or professed to believe, that we were in open rebellion
</p>
<p>against the laws and the authorities of the State. Hence mobs be-
</p>
<p>gan to assemble, among which all through the country inflamma-
</p>
<p>tory speeches were made, exciting them to mobocracy and violence.
</p>
<p>Soon they commenced their depredations in our outside settle-
</p>
<p>ments, kidnapping some, and whipping and otherwise abusing
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p>The persons thus abused fled to Nauvoo as soon as practicable,
</p>
<p>and related their injuries to Joseph Smith, then mayor of the city,
</p>
<p>and lieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion. They also went be-
</p>
<p>fore magistrates, and made affidavits of what they had suffered,
</p>
<p>seen and heard. These affidavits, in connection with a copy of all
</p>
<p>our proceedings were forwarded by Joseph Smith to Mr. Ford, then
</p>
<p>governor of Illinois, with an expression of our desire to abide law,
</p>
<p>and a request that the governor would instruct him how to proceed
</p>
<p>in the case of arrival of an armed mob against the city. The gov-
</p>
<p>ernor sent back instructions to Joseph Smith that, as he was
</p>
<p>lieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion, it was his duty to pro-
</p>
<p>tect the city and surrounding country, and issued orders to that
</p>
<p>effect. Upon the reception of these orders Joseph Smith assembled
</p>
<p>the people of the city, and laid before them the governor's instruc-
</p>
<p>tions; he also convened the officers of the Nauvoo Legion for the
</p>
<p>purpose of conferring in relation to the best mode of defense. He
</p>
<p>also issued orders to the men to hold themselves in readiness in
</p>
<p>case of being called upon. On the following day General Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, with his staff, the leading officers of the Legion, and some
</p>
<p>prominent strangers who were in our midst, made a survey of the
</p>
<p>outside boundaries of the city, which was very extensive, being

<p>about five miles up and down the river, and about two and a half
</p>
<p>back in the center, for the purpose of ascertaining the position of
</p>
<p>the ground, and the feasibility of defense, and to make all neces-
</p>
<p>sary arrangements in case of an attack.
</p>
<p>It may be well here to remark that numbers of gentlemen,
</p>
<p>strangers to us, either came on purpose or were passing through
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, and upon learning the position of things, expressed their
</p>
<p>indignation against our enemies, and avowed their readiness to
</p>
<p>assist us by their counsel or otherwise. It was some of these who
</p>
<p>assisted us in reconnoitering the city, and finding out its adapta-
</p>
<p>bility for defense, and how to protect it best against an armed
</p>
<p>force. The Legion was called together and drilled, and every means
</p>
<p>made use of for defense. At the call of the officers, old and young
</p>
<p>men came forward, both from the city and the country, and mus-
</p>
<p>tered to the number of about five thousand.
</p>
<p>In the meantime our enemies were not idle in mustering their
</p>
<p>forces and committing depredations, nor had they been; it was, in
</p>
<p>fact, their gathering that called ours into existence; their forces
</p>
<p>continued to accumulate ; they assumed a threatening attitude, and
</p>
<p>178 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>assembled in large bodies, armed and equipped for war, and threat-
</p>
<p>ened the destruction and extermination of the Mormons.
</p>
<p>An account of their outrages and assemblages was forwarded
</p>
<p>to Governor Ford almost daily; accompanied by affidavits furn-
</p>
<p>ished by eye-witnesses of their proceedings. Persons were also sent
</p>
<p>out to the counties around with pacific intentions, to give them an
</p>
<p>account of the true state of affairs, and to notify them of the feel-
</p>
<p>ings and dispositions of the people of Nauvoo, and thus, if possible,
</p>
<p>quell the excitement. In some of the more distant counties these
</p>
<p>men were very successful, and produced the salutary influence upon
</p>
<p>the minds of many intelligent and well-disposed men. In neighbor-
</p>
<p>ing counties, however, where anti-Mormon influence prevailed, they
</p>
<p>produced little effect. At the same time guards were stationed
</p>
<p>around Nauvoo, and picket-guards in the distance, At length op-
</p>
<p>posing forces gathered so near that more active measures were
</p>
<p>taken; reconnoitering parties were sent out, and the city pro-
</p>
<p>claimed under martial law. Things now assumed a beligerent atti-
</p>
<p>tude, and persons passing through the city were questioned as to
</p>
<p>what they knew of the enemy, while passes were in some instances
</p>
<p>given to avoid difficulty with the guards. Joseph Smith continued
</p>
<p>to send on messengers to the governor, (Philip B. Lewis and other
</p>
<p>messengers were sent) . Samuel James, then residing at La Harpe,
</p>
<p>carried a message and dispatches to him, and in a day or two after
</p>
<p>Bishop Edward Hunter and others went again with fresh dis-
</p>
<p>patches, representations, affidavits, and instructions; but as the
</p>
<p>weather was excessively wet, the rivers swollen, and the bridges
</p>
<p>washed away in many places, it was with great difficulty that they
</p>
<p>proceeded on their journeys. As the mobocracy had at last attracted
</p>
<p>the governor's attention, he started in company with some others
</p>
<p>from Springfield to the scene of trouble, and missed, I believe,
</p>
<p>both Brothers James and Hunter on the road, and, of course, did
</p>
<p>not see their documents. He came to Carthage, and made that
</p>
<p>place, which was a regular mobocratic den, his headquarters ; as it

<p>was the county seat, however, of Hancock County, that circum-
</p>
<p>stance might, in a measure, justify his staying there.
</p>
<p>To avoid the appearance of all hostility on our part, and to
</p>
<p>fulfill the law in every particular, at the suggestion of Judge Thom-
</p>
<p>as, judge of that judicial district, who had come to Nauvoo at the
</p>
<p>time, and who stated that we had fulfilled the law, but, in order to
</p>
<p>satisfy all he would counsel us to go before Esquire Wells, who was
</p>
<p>not in our Church, and have a hearing, we did so, and after a full
</p>
<p>hearing we were again dismissed.
</p>
<p>The governor on the road collected forces, some of whom were
</p>
<p>respectable, but on his arrival in the neighborhood of the diffi-
</p>
<p>culties he received as militia all the companies of the mob forces
</p>
<p>who united with him. After his arrival at Carthage he sent two
</p>
<p>gentlemen from there to Nauvoo as a committee to wait upon
</p>
<p>General Joseph Smith, informing him of the arrival of his excel-
</p>
<p>lency, with a request that General Smith would send out a com-
</p>
<p>mittee to wait upon the governor and represent to him the state
</p>
<p>of affairs in relation to the difficulties that then existed in the
</p>
<p>county. We met this committee while we were reconnoitering the
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 179
</p>
<p>city, to find out the best mode of defense as aforesaid. Dr. J. M.
</p>
<p>Bernhisel and myself were appointed as a committee by General
</p>
<p>Smith to wait upon the governor. Previous to going, however, we
</p>
<p>were furnished with affidavits and documents in relation both to
</p>
<p>our proceedings and those of the mob; in addition to the general
</p>
<p>history of the transaction, we took with us a duplicate of those
</p>
<p>documents which had been forwarded by Bishop Hunter, Brother
</p>
<p>James, and others. We started from Nauvoo in company with the
</p>
<p>aforesaid gentlemen at about 7 o'clock on the evening of the 21st
</p>
<p>of June, and arrived at Carthage about 11 p.m.
</p>
<p>We put up at the same hotel with the governor, kept by a Mr.
</p>
<p>Hamilton. On our arrival we found the governor in bed, but not so
</p>
<p>with the other inhabitants. The town was filled with a perfect set
</p>
<p>of rabble and rowdies, who, under the influence of Bacchus, seemed
</p>
<p>to be holding a grand saturnalia, whooping, yelling and vociferat-
</p>
<p>ing as if Bedlam had broken loose.
</p>
<p>On our arrival at the hotel, and while supper was preparing,
</p>
<p>a man came to me, dressed as a soldier, and told me that a man
</p>
<p>named Daniel Garn had just been taken prisoner, and was about
</p>
<p>to be committed to jail, and wanted me to go bail for him. Believ-
</p>
<p>ing this to be a ruse to get me out alone, and that some violence
</p>
<p>was intended, after consulting with Dr. Bernhisel, I told the man
</p>
<p>that I was well acquainted with Mr. Garn, that I knew him to be
</p>
<p>a gentleman, and did not believe that he had transgressed law, and,
</p>
<p>moreover, that I considered it a very singular time to be holding
</p>
<p>courts and calling for security, particularly as the town was full
</p>
<p>of rowdyism.
</p>
<p>I informed him that Dr. Bernhisel and myself would, if nec-
</p>
<p>essary go bail for him in the morning, but that we did not feel
</p>
<p>ourselves safe among such a set at that late hour of the night.
</p>
<p>After supper, on retiring to our room, we had to pass through
</p>
<p>another, which was separated from ours only by a board partition,
</p>
<p>the beds in each room being placed side by side, with the ex-

</p>
<p>ception of this fragile partition. On the bed that was in the room
</p>
<p>which we passed through I discovered a man by the name of Jack-
</p>
<p>son, a desperate character, and a reputed, notorious cut-throat and
</p>
<p>murderer. I hinted to the doctor that things looked rather sus-
</p>
<p>picious, and looked to see that my arms were in order. The doctor
</p>
<p>and I occupied one bed. We had scarcely laid down when a knock
</p>
<p>at the door, accompanied by a voice announced the approach of
</p>
<p>Chauncey Higbee, the young lawyer and apostate before referred
</p>
<p>to.
</p>
<p>He addressed himself to the doctor, and stated that the object
</p>
<p>of his visit was to obtain the release of Daniel Garn ; that Garn he
</p>
<p>believed to be an honest man ; that if he had done anything wrong,
</p>
<p>it was through improper counsel, and that it was a pity that he
</p>
<p>should be incarcerated, particularly when he could be so easily
</p>
<p>released; he urged the doctor, as a friend, not to leave so good a
</p>
<p>man in such an unpleasant situation ; he finally prevailed upon the
</p>
<p>doctor to go and give bail, assuring him that on his giving bail Garn
</p>
<p>would be immediately dismissed.
</p>
<p>During this conversation I did not say a word.
</p>
<p>180 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>Higbee left the doctor to dress, with the intention of return-
</p>
<p>ing and taking him to the court. As soon as Higbee had left, I told
</p>
<p>the doctor that he had better not go ; that I believed this affair was
</p>
<p>all a ruse to get us separated; that they knew we had documents
</p>
<p>with us from General Smith to show to the governor; that I be-
</p>
<p>lieved their object was to get possession of those papers, and, per-
</p>
<p>haps, when they had separated us, to murder one or both. The
</p>
<p>doctor, who was actuated by the best of motives in yielding to the
</p>
<p>assumed solicitude of Higbee, coincided with my views; he then
</p>
<p>went to Higbee, and told him that he had concluded not to go that
</p>
<p>night, but that he and I would both wait upon the justice and Mr.
</p>
<p>Garn in the morning.
</p>
<p>That night I lay awake with my pistols under my pillow, wait-
</p>
<p>ing for any emergency. Nothing more occurred during the night.
</p>
<p>In the morning we arose early, and after breakfast sought an inter-
</p>
<p>view with the governor, and were told that we could have an audi-
</p>
<p>ence, I think, at ten o'clock. In the meantime we called upon Mr.
</p>
<p>Smith, a justice of the peace, who had Mr. Garn in charge. We rep-
</p>
<p>resented that we had been called upon the night before by two
</p>
<p>different parties to go bail for a Mr. Daniel Garn, whom we were
</p>
<p>informed he had in custody, and that, believing Mr. Garn to be an
</p>
<p>honest man, we had now come for that purpose, and were prepared
</p>
<p>to enter into recognizances for his appearance, whereupon Mr.
</p>
<p>Smith, the magistrate, remarked that, under the present excited
</p>
<p>state of affairs, he did not think he would be justified in receiving
</p>
<p>bail from Nauvoo, as it was a matter of doubt whether property
</p>
<p>would not be rendered valueless there in a few days.
</p>
<p>Knowing the party we had to deal with, we were not much
</p>
<p>surprised at this singular proceeding ; we then remarked that both
</p>
<p>of us possessed property in farms out of Nauvoo in the country,
</p>
<p>and referred him to the county records. He then stated that such
</p>
<p>was the nature of the charge against Mr. Garn that he believed
</p>
<p>he would not be justified in receiving any bail. We were thus con-

</p>
<p>firmed in our opinion that the night's proceedings before, in relation
</p>
<p>to their desire to have us give bail, was a mere ruse to separate us.
</p>
<p>We were not permitted to speak with Garn, the real charge against
</p>
<p>whom was that he was traveling in Carthage or its neighborhood:
</p>
<p>what the fictitious one was, if I knew, I have since forgotten, as
</p>
<p>things of this kind were of daily occurrence.
</p>
<p>After waiting the governor's pleasure for some time we had
</p>
<p>an audience ; but such an audience !
</p>
<p>He was surrounded by some of the vilest and most unprin-
</p>
<p>cipled men in creation ; some of them had an appearance of respect-
</p>
<p>ability, and many of them lacked even that. Wilson, and, I be-
</p>
<p>lieve, William Law, were there, Foster, Frank and Chauncey Hig-
</p>
<p>bee, Mr. Mar, a lawyer from Nauvoo, a mobocratic merchant from
</p>
<p>Warsaw, the aforesaid Jackson, a number of his associates, among
</p>
<p>whom was the governor's secretary, in all, some fifteen or twenty
</p>
<p>persons, most of whom were recreant to virtue, honor, integrity,
</p>
<p>and everything that is considered honorable among men. I can well
</p>
<p>remember the feelings of disgust that I had in seeing the governor
</p>
<p>surrounded by such an infamous group, and on being introduced
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 181
</p>
<p>to men of so questionable a character; and had I been on private
</p>
<p>business, I should have turned to depart, and told the governor
</p>
<p>that if he thought proper to associate with such questionable char-
</p>
<p>acters, I should beg leave to be excused ; but coming as we did on
</p>
<p>public business, we could not, of course, consult our private feelings.
</p>
<p>We then stated to the governor that, in accordance with his
</p>
<p>request, General Smith had, in response to his call, sent us to him
</p>
<p>as a committee of conference ; that we were acquainted with most
</p>
<p>of the circumstances that had transpired in and about Nauvoo
</p>
<p>lately, and were prepared to give him all information ; that, more-
</p>
<p>over, we had in our possession testimony and affidavits confirma-
</p>
<p>tory of what we should say, which had been forwarded to him by
</p>
<p>General Joseph Smith; that communications had been forwarded
</p>
<p>to his excellency by Messrs. Hunter, James, and others, some of
</p>
<p>which had not reached their destination, but of which we had dupli-
</p>
<p>cates with us. We then, in brief, related an outline of the diffi-
</p>
<p>culties, and the course we had pursued from the commencement
</p>
<p>of the trouble up to the present, and handing him the documents,
</p>
<p>respectfully submitted the whole.
</p>
<p>During our conversation and explanations with the governor
</p>
<p>we were frequently, rudely and impudently contradicted by the
</p>
<p>fellows he had around him, and of whom he seemed to take no
</p>
<p>notice.
</p>
<p>He opened and read a number of the documents himself, and as
</p>
<p>he proceeded he was frequently interrupted by, "that's a lie!"
</p>
<p>"that's a God damned lie !" that's an infernal falsehood !" "that's a
</p>
<p>blasted lie !" etc.
</p>
<p>These men evidently winced at the exposure of their acts, and
</p>
<p>thus vulgarly, impudently, and falsely repudiated them. One of
</p>
<p>their number, Mr. Mar, addressed himself several times to me
</p>
<p>while in conversation with the governor. I did not notice him until
</p>
<p>after a frequent repetition of his insolence, when I informed him
</p>
<p>that "my business at that time was with Governor Ford," where-

</p>
<p>upon I continued my conversation with his excellency. During the
</p>
<p>conversation, the governor expressed a desire that Joseph Smith,
</p>
<p>and all parties concerned in passing or executing the city law in re-
</p>
<p>lation to the press, had better come to Carthage; that, however
</p>
<p>repugnant it might be to our feelings, he thought it would have a
</p>
<p>tendency to allay public excitement, and prove to the people what
</p>
<p>we professed, that we wished to be governed by law. We repre-
</p>
<p>sented to him the course we had taken in relation to this matter,
</p>
<p>and our willingness to go before another magistrate other than
</p>
<p>the municipal court; the illegal refusal of our request by the con-
</p>
<p>stable; our dismissal by the municipal court, a legally constituted
</p>
<p>tribunal; our subsequent trial before 'Squire Wells at the instance
</p>
<p>of Judge Thomas, the circuit judge, and our dismissal by him; that
</p>
<p>we had fulfilled the law in every particular ; that it was our enemies
</p>
<p>who were breaking the law, and, having murderous designs, were
</p>
<p>only making use of this as a pretext to get us into their power.
</p>
<p>The governor stated that the people viewed it differently, and that,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding our opinions, he would recommend that the people
</p>
<p>should be satisfied. We then remarked to him that, should Joseph
</p>
<p>182 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>Smith comply with his request, it would be extremely unsafe, in
</p>
<p>the present excited state of the country, to come without an armed
</p>
<p>force ; that we had a sufficiency of men, and were competent to
</p>
<p>defend ourselves, but there might be danger of collision should our
</p>
<p>forces and those of our enemies be brought into such close prox-
</p>
<p>imity. He strenuously advised us not to bring our arms, and
</p>
<p>pledged his faith as governor, and the faith of the State, that we
</p>
<p>should be protected, and that he would guarantee our perfect safety.
</p>
<p>We had at that time about five thousand men under arms, one
</p>
<p>thousand of whom would have been amply sufficient for our
</p>
<p>protection.
</p>
<p>At the termination of our interview, and previous to our with-
</p>
<p>drawal, after a long conversation and the perusal of the documents
</p>
<p>which we had brought, the governor informed us that he would pre-
</p>
<p>pare a written communication for General Joseph Smith, which he
</p>
<p>desired us to wait for. We were kept waiting for this instrument
</p>
<p>some five or six hours.
</p>
<p>About five o'clock in the afternoon we took our departure with
</p>
<p>not the most pleasant feelings. The associations of the governor,
</p>
<p>the spirit he manifested to compromise with these scoundrels, the
</p>
<p>length of time that he had kept us waiting, and his general deport-
</p>
<p>ment, together with the infernal spirit that we saw exhibited by
</p>
<p>those whom he had admitted to his councils made the prospect
</p>
<p>anything but promising.
</p>
<p>We returned on horseback, and arrived at Nauvoo, I think, at
</p>
<p>about eight or nine o'clock at night, accompanied by Captain Yates
</p>
<p>in command of a company of mounted men who came for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of escorting Joseph Smith and the accused in case of their
</p>
<p>complying with the governor's request, and going to Carthage.
</p>
<p>We went directly to Brother Joseph's, when Captain Yates de-
</p>
<p>livered to him the governor's communication. A council was called,
</p>
<p>consisting of Joseph's brother, Hyrum, Dr. Richards, Dr. Bern-
</p>
<p>hisel, myself, and one or two others.

</p>
<p>We then gave a detail of our interview with the governor.
</p>
<p>Brother Joseph was very much dissatisfied with the governor's
</p>
<p>letter and with his general deportment, and so were the council,
</p>
<p>and it became a serious question as to the course we should pursue.
</p>
<p>Various projects were discussed, but nothing definitely decided
</p>
<p>upon for some time.
</p>
<p>In the interim two gentlemen arrived ; one of them, if not both,
</p>
<p>sons of John C. Calhoun. They had come to Nauvoo, and were very
</p>
<p>anxious for an interview with Brother Joseph.
</p>
<p>These gentlemen detained him for some time; and, as our
</p>
<p>council was held in Dr. Bernhisel's room in the Mansion House, the
</p>
<p>doctor lay down ; and as it was now between 2 and 3 o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning, and I had had no rest on the previous night, I was fa-
</p>
<p>tigued, and thinking that Brother Joseph might not return. I left
</p>
<p>for home and rest.
</p>
<p>Being very much fatigued, I slept soundly, and was somewhat
</p>
<p>surprised in the morning by Mrs. Thompson entering my room
</p>
<p>about 7 o'clock, and exclaiming in surprise, "What, you here! the
</p>
<p>brethren have crossed the river some time since."
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 183
</p>
<p>"What brethren?" I asked.
</p>
<p>"Brother Joseph, and Hyrum, and Brother Richards," she
</p>
<p>answered.
</p>
<p>I immediately arose upon learning that they had crossed the
</p>
<p>river, and did not intend to go to Carthage. I called together a
</p>
<p>number of persons in whom I had confidence, and had the type,
</p>
<p>stereotype plates, and most of the valuable things removed from
</p>
<p>the printing office, believing that, should the governor and his force
</p>
<p>come to Nauvoo, the first thing they would do would be to burn the
</p>
<p>printing office, for I knew they would be exasperated if Brother
</p>
<p>Joseph went away. We had talked over these matters the night be-
</p>
<p>fore, but nothing was decided upon. It was Brother Joseph's opinion
</p>
<p>that, should we leave for a time, public excitement, which was then
</p>
<p>so intense, would be allayed; that it would throw on the governor
</p>
<p>the responsibility of keeping the peace; that in the event of an
</p>
<p>outrage, the onus would rest upon the governor, who was amply
</p>
<p>prepared with troops, and could command all the forces of the
</p>
<p>State to preserve order ; and that the act of his own men would be
</p>
<p>an overwhelming proof of their seditious designs, not only to the
</p>
<p>governor, but to the world. He moreover thought that, in the east,
</p>
<p>where he intended to go, public opinion would be set right in re-
</p>
<p>lation to these matters, and its expression would partially influence
</p>
<p>the west, and that, after the first ebullition, things would assume
</p>
<p>a shape that would justify his return.
</p>
<p>I made arrangements for crossing the river, and Brother Elias
</p>
<p>Smith and Joseph Cain, who were both employed in the printing
</p>
<p>office with me, assisted all that lay in their power together with
</p>
<p>Brother Brower and several hands in the printing office. As we could
</p>
<p>not find out the exact whereabouts of Joseph and the brethren,
</p>
<p>I crossed the river in a boat furnished by Brother Cyrus H. Wheel-
</p>
<p>ock and Alfred Bell ; and after the removal of the things out of the
</p>
<p>printing office, Joseph Cain brought the account books to me, that
</p>
<p>we might make arrangements for their adjustment; and Brother

</p>
<p>Elias Smith, cousin to Brother Joseph, went to obtain money for
</p>
<p>the journey, and also to find out and report to me the location of
</p>
<p>the brethren.
</p>
<p>As Cyrus H. Wheelock was an active, enterprising man, and in
</p>
<p>the event of not finding Brother Joseph I calculated to go to Upper
</p>
<p>Canada for the time being, and should need a companion, I said to
</p>
<p>Brother Cyrus H. Wheelock, "Can you go with me ten or fifteen
</p>
<p>hundred miles?"
</p>
<p>He answered, "Yes."
</p>
<p>"Can you start in half an hour?"
</p>
<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>However, I told him that he had better see his family, who
</p>
<p>lived over the river, and prepare a couple of horses and the nec-
</p>
<p>essary equippage for the journey, and that, if we did not find
</p>
<p>Brother Joseph before, we would start at nightfall.
</p>
<p>A laughable incident occurred on the eve of my departure.
</p>
<p>After making all the preparations I could, previous to leaving Nau-
</p>
<p>voo, and having bid adieu to my family, I went to a house adjoin-
</p>
<p>ing the river, owned by Brother Eddy. There I disguised myself so
</p>
<p>184 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>as not to be known, and so effectual was the transformation that
</p>
<p>those who had come after me with a boat did not know me. I went
</p>
<p>down to the boat and sat in it. Brother Bell, thinking it was a
</p>
<p>stranger, watched my moves for some time very impatiently, and
</p>
<p>then said to Brother Wheelock, "I wish that old gentleman would
</p>
<p>go away; he has been pottering around the boat for some time,
</p>
<p>and I am afraid Elder Taylor will be coming." When he discovered
</p>
<p>his mistake, he was not a little amused.
</p>
<p>I was conducted by Brother Bell to a house that was surround-
</p>
<p>ed by timber on the opposite side of the river. There I spent several
</p>
<p>hours in a chamber with Brother Joseph Cain, adjusting my
</p>
<p>accounts ; and I made arrangements for the stereotype plates of the
</p>
<p>Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants, to be forwarded east,
</p>
<p>thinking to supply the company with subsistence money through
</p>
<p>the sale of these books in the east.
</p>
<p>My horses were reported ready by Brother Wheelock, and
</p>
<p>funds on hand by Brother Elias Smith. In about half an hour I
</p>
<p>should have started, when Brother Elias Smith came to me with
</p>
<p>word that he had found the brethren; that they had concluded to
</p>
<p>go to Carthage, and wished me to return to Nauvoo and accom-
</p>
<p>pany them. I must confess that I felt a good deal disappointed
</p>
<p>at this news, but I immediately made preparations to go. Escorted
</p>
<p>by Brother Elias Smith, I and my party went to the neighborhood
</p>
<p>of Montrose, where we met Brother Joseph, Hyrum, Brother Rich-
</p>
<p>ards and others. Dr. Bernhisel thinks that W. W. Phelps was not
</p>
<p>with Joseph and Hyrum in the morning, but that he met him, my-
</p>
<p>self, Joseph and Hyrum, W. Richards and Brother Cahoon, in the
</p>
<p>afternoon, near Montrose, returning to Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>On meeting the brethren I learned that it was not Brother
</p>
<p>Joseph's desire to return, but that he came back by request of some
</p>
<p>of the brethren, and that it coincided more with Brother Hyrum's
</p>
<p>feelings than those of Brother Joseph. In fact, after his return,
</p>

<p>course taken, and said he felt much more at ease in his mind than
</p>
<p>he did before. On our return the calculation was to throw ourselves
</p>
<p>under the immediate protection of the governor, and to trust to his
</p>
<p>word and faith for our preservation.
</p>
<p>A message was, I believe, sent to the governor that night,
</p>
<p>stating that we should come to Carthage in the morning, the party
</p>
<p>that came along with us to escort us back, in case we returned to
</p>
<p>Carthage, having returned.
</p>
<p>It would seem from the following remarks of General Ford
</p>
<p>that there was a design on foot, which was, that if we refused to go
</p>
<p>to Carthage at the governor's request, there should be an increased
</p>
<p>force called for by the governor, and that we should be destroyed
</p>
<p>by them. In accordance with this project, Captain Yates returned
</p>
<p>with his posse, accompanied by the constable who held the writ.
</p>
<p>The following is the governor's remark in relation to this
</p>
<p>affair :
</p>
<p>"The constable and his escort returned. The constable made
</p>
<p>no effort to arrest any of them, nor would he or the guard delay
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 185
</p>
<p>their departure one minute beyond the time, to see whether an
</p>
<p>arrest could be made. Upon their return they reported that they
</p>
<p>had been informed that the accused had fled, and could not be
</p>
<p>found. I immediately proposed to a council of officers to march into
</p>
<p>Nauvoo with the small force then under my command, but the
</p>
<p>officers were of the opinion that it was too small, and many of them
</p>
<p>insisted upon a further call of the militia. Upon reflection I was of
</p>
<p>the opinion that the officers were right in the estimate of our
</p>
<p>force, and the project for immediate action was abandoned.
</p>
<p>"I was soon informed, however, of the conduct of the constable
</p>
<p>and guard, and then I was perfectly satisfied that a most base fraud
</p>
<p>had been attempted, that, in fact, it was feared that the Mormons
</p>
<p>would submit, and thereby entitle themselves to the protection of
</p>
<p>the law. It was very apparent that many of the bustling, active
</p>
<p>spirits were afraid that there would be no occasion for calling out
</p>
<p>an overwhelming militia force, for marching into Nauvoo, for
</p>
<p>probable mutiny when there, and for the extermination of the
</p>
<p>Mormon race. It appeared that the constable and the escort were
</p>
<p>fully in the secret, and acted well their part to promote the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy."*
</p>
<p>In the morning Brother Joseph had an interview with the offi-
</p>
<p>cers of the Legion, with the leading members of the city council,
</p>
<p>and with the principal men of the city. The officers were instructed
</p>
<p>to dismiss their men, but to have them in a state of readiness to be
</p>
<p>called upon in any emergency that might occur.
</p>
<p>About half past six o'clock the members of the city council,
</p>
<p>the marshal, Brothers Joseph and Hyrum, and a number of others,
</p>
<p>started for Carthage, on horseback. We were instructed by Brother
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith not to take any arms, and we consequently left them
</p>
<p>behind. We called at the house of Brother Fellows on our way out.
</p>
<p>Brother Fellows lived about four miles from Carthage.
</p>
<p>While at Brother Fellow's house, Captain Dunn, accompanied
</p>
<p>by Mr. Coolie, one of the governor's aides-de-camp, came up from

</p>
<p>Carthage en route for Nauvoo with a requisition from the governor
</p>
<p>for the State arms. We all returned to Nauvoo with them ; the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor's request was complied with, and after taking some refresh-
</p>
<p>ments, we all returned to proceed to Carthage. We arrived there
</p>
<p>late in the night. A great deal of excitement prevailed on and after
</p>
<p>our arrival. The governor had received into his company all of the
</p>
<p>companies that had been in the mob; these fellows were riotous
</p>
<p>and disorderly, halloowing, yelling, and whooping about the streets
</p>
<p>like Indians, many of them intoxicated ; the whole presented a scene
</p>
<p>of rowdyism and low-bred ruffianism only found among mobocrats
</p>
<p>and desperadoes, and entirely revolting to the best feelings of hu-
</p>
<p>manity. The governor made a speech to them to the effect that he
</p>
<p>would show Joseph and Hyrum Smith to them in the morning.
</p>
<p>About here the companies with the governor were drawn up
</p>
<p>in line, and General Demming, I think, took Joseph by the arm and
</p>
<p>Hyrum (Arnold says that Joseph took the governor's arm), and
</p>
<p>as he passed through between the ranks, the governor leading in

<p>front, very politely introduced them as General Joseph Smith and
</p>
<p>General Hyrum Smith.*
</p>
<p>All were orderly and courteous except one company of mobo-
</p>
<p>crats  the Carthage Grays  who seemed to find fault on account
</p>
<p>of too much honor being paid to the Mormons. There was after-
</p>
<p>wards a row between the companies, and they came pretty near
</p>
<p>having a fight ; the more orderly not feeling disposed to endorse or
</p>
<p>submit to the rowdyism of the mobocrats. The result was that
</p>
<p>General Demming, who was very much of a gentleman, ordered the
</p>
<p>Carthage Grays, a company under the command of Captain Smith,
</p>
<p>a magistrate in Carthage, and a most violent mobocrat, under
</p>
<p>arrest. This matter, however, was shortly afterward adjusted, and
</p>
<p>the difficulty settled between them.
</p>
<p>The mayor, aldermen, councilors, as well as the marshal of
</p>
<p>the city of Nauvoo, together with some persons who had assisted
</p>
<p>the marshal in removing the press in Nauvoo, appeared before Jus-
</p>
<p>tice Smith, the aforesaid captain and mobocrat, to again answer
</p>
<p>the charge of destroying the press ; but as there was so much ex-
</p>
<p>citement, and as the man was an unprincipled villain before whom
</p>
<p>we were to have our hearing, we thought it most prudent to give
</p>
<p>bail, and consequently became security for each other in $500 bonds
</p>
<p>each, to appear before the County Court at its next session. We had
</p>
<p>engaged as counsel a lawyer by the name of Wood, of Burlington,
</p>
<p>*The Deseret Netvs gives the following account of Joseph and Hyrum
</p>
<p>Smith's passing through the troops in Carthage:
</p>
<p>"Carthage, June 25, 1844.
</p>
<p>"Quarter past nine. The governor came and invited Joseph to walk with
</p>
<p>him through the troops. Joseph solicited a few moments' private conversation
</p>
<p>with him, which the governor refused.
</p>
<p>"While refusing, the governor looked down at his shoes, as though he
</p>
<p>was ashamed. They then walked through the crowd, with Brigadier General
</p>
<p>Miner R. Demming, and Dr. Richards, to General Demming's quarters. The
</p>
<p>people appeared quiet until a company of Carthage Grays flocked round the

</p>
<p>doors of General Demming in an uproarious manner, of which notice was
</p>
<p>sent to the governor. In the meantime the governor had ordered the McDon-
</p>
<p>ough troops to be drawn up in line, for Joseph and Hyrum to pass in front of
</p>
<p>them, they having requested that they might have a clear view of the General
</p>
<p>Smiths. Joseph had a conversation with the governor for about ten minutes,
</p>
<p>when he again pledged the faith of the State that he and his friends should be
</p>
<p>protected from violence.
</p>
<p>"Robinson, the postmaster, said, on report of martial law being proclaimed
</p>
<p>in Nauvoo, he had stopped the mail, and notified the postmaster general of
</p>
<p>the state of things in Hancock County.
</p>
<p>"From the general's quarters Joseph and Hyrum went in front of the
</p>
<p>lines, in a hollow square of a company of Carthage Grays. At seven minutes
</p>
<p>before ten they arrived in front of the lines, and passed before the whole,
</p>
<p>Joseph being on the right of General Demming and Hyrum on his left, Elders
</p>
<p>Richards, Taylor and Phelps following. Joseph and Hyrum were introduced
</p>
<p>by Governor Ford about twenty times along the line as General Joseph Smith
</p>
<p>and General Hyrum Smith, the governor walking in front on the left. The
</p>
<p>Carthage Grays refused to receive them by that introduction, and some of
</p>
<p>the officers threw up their hats, drew their swords, and said they would intro-
</p>
<p>duce themselves to the damned Mormons in a different style. The governor
</p>
<p>mildly entreated them not to act so rudely, but their excitement increased;
</p>
<p>the governor, however, succeeded in pacifying them by making a speech, and
</p>
<p>promising them that they should have 'full satisfaction.' General Smith and
</p>
<p>party returned to their lodgings at five minutes past ten."

</p>
<p>Iowa; and Reed, I think, of Madison, Iowa. After some little dis-
</p>
<p>cussion the bonds were signed, and we were all dismissed.
</p>
<p>Almost immediately after our dismissal, two men  Augustine
</p>
<p>Spencer and Norton  two worthless fellows, whose words would
</p>
<p>not have been taken for five cents, and the first of whom had a short
</p>
<p>time previously been before the mayor in Nauvoo for maltreating
</p>
<p>a lame brother, made affidavits that Joseph and Hyrum Smith were
</p>
<p>guilty of treason, and a writ was accordingly issued for their arrest,
</p>
<p>and the constable Bettesworth, a rough, unprincipled man, wished
</p>
<p>immediately to hurry them away to prison without any hearing.
</p>
<p>His rude, uncouth manner in the administration of what he con-
</p>
<p>sidered the duties of his office made him exceedingly repulsive to
</p>
<p>us all. But, independent of these acts, the proceedings in this case
</p>
<p>were altogether illegal. Providing the court was sincere, which it
</p>
<p>was not, and providing these men's oaths were true, and that Jo-
</p>
<p>seph and Hyrum were guilty of treason, still the whole course was
</p>
<p>illegal.
</p>
<p>The magistrate made out a mittimus, and committed them to
</p>
<p>prison without a hearing, which he had no right legally to do. The
</p>
<p>statute of Illinois expressly provides that "all men shall have a
</p>
<p>hearing before a magistrate before they shall be committed to
</p>
<p>prison ;" and Mr. Robert H. Smith, the magistrate, had made out
</p>
<p>a mittimus committing them to prison contrary to law without such
</p>
<p>hearing. As I was informed of this illegal proceeding, I went im-
</p>
<p>mediately to the governor and informed him of it. Whether he was
</p>
<p>apprised of it before or not, I do not know ; but my opinion is that
</p>
<p>he was.
</p>
<p>I represented to him the characters of the parties who had
</p>
<p>made oath, the outrageous nature of the charge, the indignity
</p>
<p>offered to men in the position which they occupied, and declared
</p>
<p>to him that he knew very well it was a vexatious proceeding, and
</p>
<p>that the accused were not guilty of any such crime. The governor
</p>
<p>replied, he was very sorry that the thing had occurred ; that he did

</p>
<p>not believe the charges, but that he thought the best thing to be
</p>
<p>done was to let the law take its course. I then reminded him that
</p>
<p>we had come out there at his instance, not to satisfy the law, which
</p>
<p>we had done before, but the prejudices of the people, in relation
</p>
<p>to the affairs of the press ; that at his instance we had given bonds,
</p>
<p>which we could not by law be required to do to satisfy the people,
</p>
<p>and that it was asking too much to require gentlemen in their po-
</p>
<p>sition in life to suffer the degradation of being immured in a jail
</p>
<p>at the instance of such worthless scoundrels as those who had made
</p>
<p>this affidavit. The governor replied that it was an unpleasant affair,
</p>
<p>and looked hard; but that it was a matter over which he had no
</p>
<p>control, as it belonged to the judiciary; that he, as the executive,
</p>
<p>could not interfere with their proceedings, and that he had no
</p>
<p>doubt but that they would immediately be dismissed. I told him
</p>
<p>that we had looked to him for protection from such insults, and
</p>
<p>that I thought we had a right to do so from the solemn promises
</p>
<p>which he had made to me and to Dr. Bernhisel in relation to our
</p>
<p>coming without guard or arms ; that we had relied upon his faith,
</p>
<p>and had a right to expect him to fulfill his engagements after we
</p>
<p>188 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>had placed ourselves implicitly under his care, and complied with all
</p>
<p>his requests, although extrajudicial.
</p>
<p>He replied that he would detail a guard, if we required it, and
</p>
<p>see us protected, but that he could not interfere with the judiciary.
</p>
<p>I expressed my dissatisfaction at the course taken, and told him,
</p>
<p>that, if we were to be subject to mob rule, and to be dragged, con-
</p>
<p>trary to law, into prison at the instance of every infernal scoundrel
</p>
<p>whose oaths could be bought for a dram of whiskey, his protection
</p>
<p>availed very little, and we had miscalculated his promises.
</p>
<p>Seeing there was no prospect of redress from the governor, I
</p>
<p>returned to the room, and found the constable Bettesworth very
</p>
<p>urgent to hurry Brothers Joseph and Hyrum to prison, while the
</p>
<p>brethren were remonstrating with him. At the same time a great
</p>
<p>rabble was gathered in the streets and around the door, and from
</p>
<p>the rowdyism manifested I was afraid there was a design to murder
</p>
<p>the prisoners on the way to jail.
</p>
<p>Without conferring with any person, my next feelings were
</p>
<p>to procure a guard, and seeing a man habited as a soldier in the
</p>
<p>room, I went to him and said, ''I am afraid there is a design against
</p>
<p>the lives of the Messrs. Smith ; will you go immediately and bring
</p>
<p>your captain; and, if not convenient, any other captain of a com-
</p>
<p>pany, and I will pay you well for your trouble ?" He said he would,
</p>
<p>and departed forthwith, and soon returned with his captain, whose
</p>
<p>name I have forgotten, and introduced him to me. I told of my fears,
</p>
<p>and requested him immediately to fetch his company.
</p>
<p>He departed forthwith, and arrived at the door with them
</p>
<p>just at the time when the constable was hurrying the brethren
</p>
<p>down stairs. A number of the brethren went along, together with
</p>
<p>one or two strangers ; and all of us, safely lodged in prison, remained
</p>
<p>there during the night.
</p>
<p>At the request of Joseph Smith for an interview with the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor, he came the next morning, Thursday, June 26th, at half past
</p>
<p>9 o'clock, accompanied by Colonel Geddes, when a lengthy conver-

</p>
<p>sation was entered into in relation to the existing difficulties ; and
</p>
<p>after some preliminary remarks, at the governor's request, Brother
</p>
<p>Joseph gave him a general outline of the state of affairs in relation
</p>
<p>to our difficulties, the excited state of the country, the tumultuous
</p>
<p>mobocratic movements of our enemies, the precautionary measures
</p>
<p>used by himself (Joseph Smith), the acts of the city council, the
</p>
<p>destruction of the press, and the moves of the mob and ourselves
</p>
<p>up to that time.
</p>
<p>The following report is, I believe, substantially correct :
</p>
<p>Governor  "General Smith, I believe you have given me a
</p>
<p>general outline of the difficulties that have existed in the country
</p>
<p>in the documents forwarded to me by Dr. Bernhisel and Mr. Taylor ;
</p>
<p>but, unfortunately, there seems to be a great discrepancy between
</p>
<p>your statements and those of your enemies. It is true that you
</p>
<p>are substantiated by evidence and affidavit, but for such an extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary excitement as that which is now in the country there
</p>
<p>must be some cause, and I attribute the last outbreak to the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of the Expositor, and to your refusal to comply with the writ
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 189
</p>
<p>issued by Esquire Morrison. The press in the United States is
</p>
<p>looked upon as the great bulwark of American freedom, and its
</p>
<p>destruction in Nauvoo was represented and looked upon as a high-
</p>
<p>handed measure, and manifests to the people a disposition on your
</p>
<p>part to suppress the liberty of speech and of the press. This, with
</p>
<p>your refusal to comply with the requisition of a writ, I conceive to
</p>
<p>be the principal cause of this difficulty ; and you are moreover rep-
</p>
<p>resented to me as turbulent, and defiant of the laws and institu^-
</p>
<p>tions of your country."
</p>
<p>General Smith  "Governor Ford, you, sir, as governor of this
</p>
<p>State, are aware of the persecutions that I have endured. You
</p>
<p>know well that our course has been peaceable and law-abiding for
</p>
<p>I have furnished this State ever since our settlement here with
</p>
<p>sufficient evidence of my pacific intentions, and those of the people
</p>
<p>with whom I am associated, by the endurance of every conceivable
</p>
<p>indignity and lawless outrage perpetrated upon me and upon this
</p>
<p>people since our settlement here; and you know yourself that I
</p>
<p>have kept you well posted in relation to all matters associated
</p>
<p>with the late difficulties. If you have not got some of my communi-
</p>
<p>cations, it has not been my fault.
</p>
<p>"Agreeable to your orders, I assembled the Nauvoo Legion for
</p>
<p>the protection of Nauvoo and the surrounding country against an
</p>
<p>armed band of marauders ; and ever since they have been mustered
</p>
<p>I have almost daily communicated with you in regard to all the
</p>
<p>leading events that have transpired; and whether in the capacity
</p>
<p>of mayor of the city, or lieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion,
</p>
<p>I have striven, according to the best of my judgment, to preserve
</p>
<p>the peace and to administer even-handed justice; but my motives
</p>
<p>are impugned, my acts are misconstrued, and I am grossly and
</p>
<p>wickedly misrepresented. I suppose I am indebted for my incarcer-
</p>
<p>ation to the oath of a worthless man, who was arraigned before
</p>
<p>me and fined for abusing and maltreating his lame, helpless brother.
</p>
<p>That I should be charged by you sir, who know better, of acting

</p>
<p>contrary to law, is to me a matter of surprise. Was it the Mormons
</p>
<p>or our enemies who first commenced these difficulties? You know
</p>
<p>well it was not us ; and when this turbulent, outrageous people com-
</p>
<p>menced their insurrectionary movements I made you acquainted
</p>
<p>with them officially, and asked your advice, and have followed
</p>
<p>strictly your counsel in every particular. Who ordered out the Nau-
</p>
<p>voo Legion? I did, under your direction. For what purpose? To
</p>
<p>suppress the insurrectionary movements. It was at your instance,
</p>
<p>sir, that I issued a proclamation calling upon the Nauvoo Legion
</p>
<p>to be in readiness at a moment's warning to guard against the in-
</p>
<p>cursions of mobs, and gave an order to Jonathan Dunham, acting
</p>
<p>major-general, to that effect.
</p>
<p>"Am I, then, to be charged wtih the acts of others? and be-
</p>
<p>cause lawlessness and mobocracy abound, am I, when carrying out
</p>
<p>your instructions, to be charged with not abiding law? Why is it
</p>
<p>that I must be made accountable for other men's acts ? If there is
</p>
<p>trouble in the country, neither I nor my people made it; and all
</p>
<p>that we have ever done, after much endurance on our part, is to
</p>
<p>maintain and uphold the Constitution and institutions of our coun-
</p>
<p>190 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>try, and to protect an injured, innocent, and persecuted people
</p>
<p>against misrule and mob violence.
</p>
<p>"Concerning the destruction of the press to which you refer,
</p>
<p>men may differ somewhat in their opinions about it ; but can it be
</p>
<p>supposed that after all the indignities to which they have been sub-
</p>
<p>jected outside, that people could suffer a set of worthless vagabonds
</p>
<p>to come into their city, and, right under their own eyes and pro-
</p>
<p>tection, vilify and calumniate not only themselves, but the charac-
</p>
<p>ter of their wives and daughters, as was impudently and unblush-
</p>
<p>ingly done in that infamous and filthy sheet?
</p>
<p>"There is not a city in the United States that would have suf-
</p>
<p>fered such an indignity for twenty-four hours. Our whole people
</p>
<p>were indignant, and loudly called upon our city authorities for a
</p>
<p>redress of their grievances, which, if not attended to, they them-
</p>
<p>selves would have taken into their own hands, and have summarily
</p>
<p>punished the audacious wretches as they deserved. The principle of
</p>
<p>equal rights that has been instilled into our bosoms from our cradles
</p>
<p>as American citizens forbids us submitting to every foul indignity,
</p>
<p>and succumbing and pandering to wretches so infamous as these.
</p>
<p>But, independent of this, the course that we pursued we consider
</p>
<p>to be strictly legal ; for, notwithstanding the result, we were anxious
</p>
<p>to be governed strictly by law, and therefore we convened the city
</p>
<p>council; and being desirous in our deliberations to abide by law,
</p>
<p>we summoned legal counsel to be present on the occasion. Upon in-
</p>
<p>vestigating the matter, we found that our city charter gave us
</p>
<p>power to remove all nuisances. Furthermore, after consulting Black-
</p>
<p>stone upon what might be considered a nuisance, it appeared that
</p>
<p>that distinguished lawyer, who is considered authority, I believe,
</p>
<p>in all our courts, states among other things that 'a libelous and
</p>
<p>filthy press, may be considered a nuisance; and abated as such/
</p>
<p>Here, then, one of the most eminent English barristers, whose
</p>
<p>works are considered standard with us, declares that a libelous and
</p>
<p>filthy press may be considered a nuisance; and our own charter,

<p>given us by the Legislature of this State, gives us power to remove
</p>
<p>nuisances ; and by ordering that press to be abated as a nuisance,
</p>
<p>we conceived that we were acting strictly in accordance with law.
</p>
<p>We made that order in our corporate capacity, and the city mar-
</p>
<p>shal carried it out. It is possible there may have been some better
</p>
<p>way, but I must confess that I could not see it.
</p>
<p>"In relation to the writ served upon us, we are willing to abide
</p>
<p>the consequences of our own acts, but are unwilling, in answering
</p>
<p>a writ of that kind, to submit to illegal exactions, sought to be
</p>
<p>imposed upon us under the pretense of law, when we knew they
</p>
<p>were in open violation of it. When that document was presented to
</p>
<p>me by Mr. Bettesworth, I offered, in the presence of more than
</p>
<p>twenty persons, to go to any other magistrate, either in our city, in
</p>
<p>Appanoose, or any other place where we should be safe, but we
</p>
<p>all refused to put ourselves into the power of a mob. What right
</p>
<p>had that constable to refuse our request? He had none according
</p>
<p>to law; for you know, Governor Ford, that the statute law in
</p>
<p>Illinois is, that the parties served with the writ 'shall go before
</p>
<p>him who issued it, or some other justice of the peace. , Why, then,
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 191
</p>
<p>should we be dragged to Carthage, where the law does not compel
</p>
<p>us to go ? Does not this look like many others of our persecutions
</p>
<p>with which you are acquainted ? and have we not a right to expect
</p>
<p>foul play? This very act was a breach of law on his part, an as-
</p>
<p>sumption of power that did not belong to him, and an attempt, at
</p>
<p>least, to deprive us of our legal and constitutional rights and priv-
</p>
<p>ileges. What could we do, under the circumstances, different from
</p>
<p>what we did do? We sued for, and obtained a writ of habeas corpus
</p>
<p>from the municipal court, by which we were delivered from the
</p>
<p>hands of Constable Bettesworth, and brought before and acquitted
</p>
<p>by the municipal court. After our acquittal, in a conversation with
</p>
<p>Judge Thomas, although he considered the acts of the party illegal,
</p>
<p>he advised that, to satisfy the people, we had better go before an-
</p>
<p>other magistrate who was not in our Church. In accordance with
</p>
<p>his advice, we went before Esquire Wells, with whom you are well
</p>
<p>acquainted; both parties were present, witnesses were called on
</p>
<p>both sides, the case was fully investigated, and we were again dis-
</p>
<p>missed. And what is this pretended desire to enforce law, and
</p>
<p>wherefore are these lying, base rumors put into circulation but
</p>
<p>to seek, through mob influence, under pretense of law, to make
</p>
<p>us submit to requisitions which are contrary to law and subversive
</p>
<p>of every principle of justice? And when you, sir, required us to
</p>
<p>come out here, we came, not because it was legal, but because you
</p>
<p>required it of us, and we were desirous of showing to you, and to
</p>
<p>all men, that we shrunk not from the most rigid investigation of
</p>
<p>our acts. We certainly did expect other treatment than to be im-
</p>
<p>mured in a jail at the instance of these men, and I think, from your
</p>
<p>plighted faith, we had a right so to expect, after disbanding our
</p>
<p>own forces, and putting ourselves entirely in your hands. And
</p>
<p>now, after having fulfilled my part, sir, as a man and an American
</p>
<p>citizen, I call upon you, Governor Ford, to deliver us from this
</p>
<p>place, and rescue us from this outrage that is sought to be practiced
</p>
<p>upon us by a set of infamous scoundrels. ,,

<p>Governor Ford.  "But you have placed men under arrest, de-
</p>
<p>tained men as prisoners, and given passes to others, some of which
</p>
<p>I have seen."
</p>
<p>John P. Greene, City Marshal.  "Perhaps I can explain. Since
</p>
<p>these difficulties have commenced, you are aware that we have been
</p>
<p>placed under very peculiar circumstances ; our city has been placed
</p>
<p>under a very rigid police guard ; in addition to this, frequent guards
</p>
<p>have been placed outside the city to prevent any sudden surprise,
</p>
<p>and those guards have questioned suspected or suspicious persons
</p>
<p>as to their business. To strangers, in some instances, passes have
</p>
<p>been given to prevent difficulty in passing those guards; it is
</p>
<p>some of these passes that you have seen. No person, sir, has been
</p>
<p>imprisoned without a legal cause in our city."
</p>
<p>Governor.  "Why did you not give a more speedy answer to
</p>
<p>the posse that I sent out?"
</p>
<p>General Smith.  We had matters of importance to consult
</p>
<p>upon; your letter showed anything but an amiable spirit. We have
</p>
<p>suffered immensely in Missouri from mobs, in loss of property, im-
</p>
<p>192 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>prisonment, and otherwise. It took some time for us to weigh duly
</p>
<p>these matters; we could not decide upon matters of such impor-
</p>
<p>tance immediately, and your posse were too hasty in returning;
</p>
<p>we were consulting for a large people, and vast interests were at
</p>
<p>stake. We had been outrageously imposed upon, and knew not how
</p>
<p>far we could trust any one; besides, a question necessarily arose,
</p>
<p>How shall we come? Your request was that we should come un-
</p>
<p>armed. It became a matter of serious importance to decide how far
</p>
<p>promises could be trusted, and how far we were safe from mob
</p>
<p>violence."
</p>
<p>Colonel Geddes.  "It certainly did look, from all I have heard,
</p>
<p>from the general spirit of violence and mobocracy that here pre-
</p>
<p>vails, that it was not safe for you to come unprotected."
</p>
<p>Governor Ford.  "I think that sufficient time was not allowed
</p>
<p>by the posse for you to consult and get ready. They were too hasty ;
</p>
<p>but I suppose they found themselves bound by their orders. I think,
</p>
<p>too, there is a great deal of truth in what you say, and your reason-
</p>
<p>ing is plausible, but I must beg leave to differ from you in relation
</p>
<p>to the acts of the City Council. That Council, in my opinion, had no
</p>
<p>right to act in a legislative capacity, and in that of the judiciary.
</p>
<p>They should have passed a law in relation to the matter, and then
</p>
<p>the Municipal Court, upon complaint, could have removed it; but
</p>
<p>for the City Council to take upon themselves the law-making and
</p>
<p>the execution of the law, is, in my opinion, wrong; besides, these
</p>
<p>men ought to have had a hearing before their property was de-
</p>
<p>stroyed ; to destroy it without was an infringement on their rights ;
</p>
<p>besides, it is so contrary to the feelings of American people to
</p>
<p>interfere with the press. And, furthermore, I cannot but think that
</p>
<p>it would have been more judicious for you to have gone with Mr.
</p>
<p>Bettesworth to Carthage, notwithstanding the law did not require
</p>
<p>it. Concerning your being in jail, I am sorry for that; I wish it had
</p>
<p>been otherwise. I hope you will soon be released, but I can not
</p>
<p>interfere."

<p>Joseph Smith.  "Governor Ford, allow me, sir, to bring one
</p>
<p>thing to your mind that you seem to have overlooked. You state
</p>
<p>that you think it would have been better for us to have submitted
</p>
<p>to the requisition of Constable Bettesworth, and to have gone to
</p>
<p>Carthage. Do you not know, sir, that that writ was served at the
</p>
<p>instance of an anti-Mormon mob, who had passed resolutions, and
</p>
<p>published them, to the effect that they would exterminate the Mor-
</p>
<p>mon leaders ? And are you not informed that Captain Anderson was
</p>
<p>not only threatened but had a gun fired at his boat by this said
</p>
<p>mob in Warsaw when coming up to Nauvoo, and that this very
</p>
<p>thing was made use of as a means to get us into their hands ; and
</p>
<p>we could not, without taking an armed force with us, go there
</p>
<p>without, according to their published declarations, going into the
</p>
<p>jaws of death? To have taken a force with us would only have
</p>
<p>fanned the excitement, and they would have stated that we wanted
</p>
<p>to use intimidation; therefore, we thought it the most judicious
</p>
<p>to avail ourselves of the protection of the law."
</p>
<p>Governor Ford.  "I see, I see."
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 193
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith.  "Furthermore, in relation to the press, you
</p>
<p>say that you differ from me in opinion. Be it so ; the thing, after all,
</p>
<p>is only a legal difficulty, and the courts, I should judge, are compe-
</p>
<p>tent to decide on that matter. If our act was illegal, we are willing
</p>
<p>to meet it ; and although I cannot see the distinction that you draw
</p>
<p>about the acts of the City Council, and what difference it could
</p>
<p>have made in point of fact, law, or justice between the City Coun-
</p>
<p>cil's acting together or separate, or how much more legal it would
</p>
<p>have been for the Municipal Court, who were a part of the City
</p>
<p>Council, to act separately instead of with the councilors, yet, if it
</p>
<p>is deemed that we did a wrong in destroying that press, we refuse
</p>
<p>not to pay for it ; we are desirous to fulfill the law in every particu-
</p>
<p>lar, and are responsible for our acts. You say that the parties ought
</p>
<p>to have a hearing. Had it been a civil suit, this of course, would
</p>
<p>have been proper ; but there was a flagrant violation of every prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of right  a nuisance; and it was abated on the same prin-
</p>
<p>ciple that any nuisance, stench, or putrefied carcass would have
</p>
<p>been removed. Our first step, therefore, was to stop the foul, noi-
</p>
<p>some, filthy sheet, and then the next in our opinion would have
</p>
<p>been to have prosecuted the man for a breach of public decency.
</p>
<p>And, furthermore, again let me say, Governor Ford, I shall look
</p>
<p>to you for our protection. I believe you are talking of going to Nau-
</p>
<p>voo; if you go, sir, I wish to go along. I refuse not to answer any
</p>
<p>law, but I do not consider myself safe here."
</p>
<p>Governor.  "I am in hopes that you will be acquitted, and if I
</p>
<p>go I will certainly take you along. I do not, however, apprehend
</p>
<p>danger. I think you are perfectly safe either here or anywhere else.
</p>
<p>I can not, however, interfere with the law. I am placed in peculiar
</p>
<p>circumstances and seem to be blamed by all parties."
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith.  "Governor Ford, I ask for nothing but what is
</p>
<p>legal ; I have a right to expect protection, at least from you ; for, in-
</p>
<p>dependent of law, you have pledged your faith and that of the
</p>
<p>State for my protection, and I wish to go to Nauvoo."

</p>
<p>Governor.  "And you shall have protection, General Smith. I
</p>
<p>did not make this promise without consulting my officers, who all
</p>
<p>pledged their honor to its fulfillment. I do not know that I shall go
</p>
<p>tomorrow to Nauvoo, but if I do I will take you along."
</p>
<p>At a quarter past ten o'clock the governor left.
</p>
<p>At about half past twelve o'clock, Mr. Reed, one of Joseph's
</p>
<p>counsel, came in, apparently much elated; he stated that, upon an
</p>
<p>examination of the law, he found that the magistrate had tran-
</p>
<p>scended his jurisdiction, and that having committed them without
</p>
<p>an examination, his jurisdiction ended, that he had him upon a pin-
</p>
<p>hook; that he ought to have examined them before he committed
</p>
<p>them, and that, having violated the law in this particular, he had
</p>
<p>no further power over them; for, once committed, they were out
</p>
<p>of his jurisdiction, as the power of the magistrate extended no
</p>
<p>farther than their committal, and that now they could not be
</p>
<p>brought out except at the regular session of the Circuit Court,
</p>
<p>or by a writ of habeas corpus; but that if Justice Smith would con-
</p>
<p>194 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>sent to go to Nauvoo for trial, he would compromise matters with
</p>
<p>him, and overlook this matter.
</p>
<p>Mr. Reed further stated that the anti-Mormon or mob, had
</p>
<p>concocted a scheme to get out a writ from Missouri, with a demand
</p>
<p>upon Governor Ford for the arrest of Joseph Smith, and his con-
</p>
<p>veyance to Missouri, and that a man by the name of Wilson had
</p>
<p>returned from Missouri the night before the burning of the press
</p>
<p>for this purpose.
</p>
<p>At half past two o'clock Constable Bettesworth came to the jail
</p>
<p>with a man named Simpson, professing to have some order, but he
</p>
<p>would not send up his name, and the guard would not let him pass.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bernhisel and Brother Wasson went to inform the governor
</p>
<p>and council of this. At about twenty minutes to three Dr. Bernhisel
</p>
<p>returned, and stated that he thought the governor was doing all he
</p>
<p>could. At about ten minutes to three Hiram Kimball appeared
</p>
<p>with news from Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>Soon after Constable Bettesworth came with an order from
</p>
<p>Esquire Smith to convey the prisoners to the court-house for trial.
</p>
<p>He was informed that the process was illegal, that they had been
</p>
<p>placed there contrary to law, and that they refused to come unless
</p>
<p>by legal process. I was informed that Justice Smith (who was also
</p>
<p>captain of the Carthage Grays) went to the governor and informed
</p>
<p>him of the matter, and that the governor replied, "You have your
</p>
<p>forces, and of course can use them." The constable certainly did
</p>
<p>return, accompanied by a guard of armed men, and by force, and
</p>
<p>under protest, hurried the prisoners to the court.
</p>
<p>About four o'clock the case was called by Captain Robert F.
</p>
<p>Smith, J. P. The counsel for the prisoners called for subpoenas to
</p>
<p>bring witnesses. At twenty-five minutes past four he took a copy
</p>
<p>of the order to bring the prisoners from jail to trial, and after-
</p>
<p>wards he took names of witnesses.
</p>
<p>Counsel present for the State: Higbee, Skinner, Sharp, Em-
</p>
<p>mons, and Morrison. Twenty-five minutes to five the writ was

</p>
<p>returned as served, June 25th.
</p>
<p>Many remarks were made at the court that I paid but little
</p>
<p>attention to, as I considered the whole thing illegal and a complete
</p>
<p>burlesque. Wood objected to the proceedings in toto, in consequence
</p>
<p>of its illegality, showing that the prisoners were not only illegally
</p>
<p>committed, but that, being once committed, the magistrate had no
</p>
<p>further power over them ; but as it was the same magistrate before
</p>
<p>whom he was pleading who imprisoned them contrary to law, and
</p>
<p>the same who, as captain, forced them from jail, his arguments
</p>
<p>availed but little. He then urged that the prisoners be remanded
</p>
<p>until witnesses could be had, and applied for a continuance for that
</p>
<p>purpose. Skinner suggested until twelve o'clock next day. Wood
</p>
<p>again demanded until witnesses could be obtained; that the court
</p>
<p>meet at a specified time, and that, if, witnesses were not present,
</p>
<p>again adjourn, without calling the prisoners. After various remarks
</p>
<p>from Reed r Skinner, and others, the court stated that the writ was
</p>
<p>served yesterday, and that it will give until tomorrow at twelve m.
</p>
<p>to get witnesses.
</p>
<p>We then returned to jail. Immediately after our return Dr.

</p>
<p>Bernhisel went to the governor, and obtained from him an order
</p>
<p>for us to occupy a large open room containing a bedstead. I rather
</p>
<p>think that the same room had been appropriated to the use of
</p>
<p>debtors ; at any rate, there was free access to the jailer's house, and
</p>
<p>no bars or locks except such as might be on the outside door of the
</p>
<p>jail. The jailer, Mr. George W. Steghall, and his wife, manifested a
</p>
<p>disposition to make us as comfortable as they could ; we ate at their
</p>
<p>table, which was well provided, and, of course, paid for it.
</p>
<p>I do not remember the names of all who were with us that night
</p>
<p>and the next morning in jail, for several went and came; among
</p>
<p>those that we considered stationary were Stephen Markham, John
</p>
<p>S. Fullmer, Captain Dan Jones, Dr. Willard Richards, and myself.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bernhisel says that he was there from Wednesday in the after-
</p>
<p>noon until eleven o'clock next day. We were, however, visited by
</p>
<p>numerous friends, among whom were Uncle John Smith, Hiram
</p>
<p>Kimball, Cyrus H. Wheelock, besides lawyers, as counsel. There
</p>
<p>was also a great variety of conversation, which was rather desultory
</p>
<p>than otherwise, and referred to circumstances that had transpired,
</p>
<p>our former and present grievances, the spirit of the troops around
</p>
<p>us, and the disposition of the governor ; the devising for legal and
</p>
<p>other plans for deliverance, the nature of testimony required ; the
</p>
<p>gathering of proper witnesses, and a variety of other topics, includ-
</p>
<p>ing our religious hopes, etc.
</p>
<p>During one of these conversations Dr. Richards remarked :
</p>
<p>"Brother Joseph, if it is necessary that you die in this matter, and
</p>
<p>if they will take me in your stead, I will suffer for you." At
</p>
<p>another time, when conversing about deliverance, I said, "Brother
</p>
<p>Joseph, if you will permit it, and say the word, I will have you out
</p>
<p>of this prison in five hours, if the jail has to come down to do it."
</p>
<p>My idea was to go to Nauvoo, and collect a force sufficient, as I
</p>
<p>considered the whole affair a legal farce, and a flagrant outrage
</p>
<p>upon our liberty and rights. Brother Joseph refused.
</p>
<p>Elder Cyrus H. Wheelock came in to see us, and when he was

</p>
<p>about leaving drew a small pistol, a six-shooter, from his pocket,
</p>
<p>remarking at the same time, "Would any of you like to have this?"
</p>
<p>Brother Joseph immediately replied, "Yes, give it to me;" where-
</p>
<p>upon he took the pistol, and put it in his pantaloons pocket. The
</p>
<p>pistol was a six-shooting revolver, of Allen's patent ; it belonged to
</p>
<p>me, and was one that I furnished to Brother Wheelock when he
</p>
<p>talked of going with me to the east, previous to our coming to
</p>
<p>Carthage. I have it now in my possession. Brother Wheelock went
</p>
<p>out on some errand, and was not suffered to return. The report of
</p>
<p>the governor having gone to Nauvoo without taking the prisoners
</p>
<p>along with him caused very unpleasant feelings, as we were ap-
</p>
<p>prised that we were left to the tender mercies of the Carthage
</p>
<p>Grays, a company strictly mobocratic, and whom we knew to be our
</p>
<p>most deadly enemies ; and their captain, Esquire Smith, was a most
</p>
<p>unprincipled villain. Besides this, all the mob forces, comprising
</p>
<p>the governor's troops, were dismissed, with the exception of one
</p>
<p>or two companies, which the governor took with him to Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>The great part of the mob was liberated, the remainder was our
</p>
<p>guard.
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 197
</p>
<p>We looked upon it not only as a breach of faith on the part of
</p>
<p>the governor, but also as an indication of a desire to insult us, if
</p>
<p>nothing more, by leaving us in the proximity of such men. The
</p>
<p>prevention of Wheelock's return was among the first of their
</p>
<p>hostile movements.
</p>
<p>Colonel Markham then went out, and he was also prevented
</p>
<p>from returning. He was very angry at this, but the mob paid no
</p>
<p>attention to him; they drove him out of town at the point of the
</p>
<p>bayonet, and threatened to shoot him if he returned. He went, I am
</p>
<p>informed, to Nauvoo for the purpose of raising a company of men
</p>
<p>for our protection. Brother Fullmer went to Nauvoo after wit-
</p>
<p>nesses; it is my opinion that Brother Wheelock did also.
</p>
<p>Some time after dinner we sent for some wine. It has been
</p>
<p>reported by some that this was taken as a sacrament. It was no
</p>
<p>such thing; our spirits were generally dull and heavy, and it was
</p>
<p>sent for to revive us. I think it was Captain Jones who went after it,
</p>
<p>but they would not suffer him to return. I believe we all drank of
</p>
<p>the wine, and gave some to one or two of the prison guards. We
</p>
<p>all of us felt unusually dull and languid, with a remarkable depres-
</p>
<p>sion of spirits. In consonance with those feelings I sang a song,
</p>
<p>that had lately been introduced into Nauvoo, entitled, "A poor,
</p>
<p>wayfaring man of grief/' etc.
</p>
<p>THE POOR WAYFARING MAN OF GRIEF
</p>
<p>A poor wayfaring man of grief
</p>
<p>Had often crossed me on my way,
</p>
<p>Who sued so humbly for relief
</p>
<p>That I could never answer, Nay.
</p>
<p>I had not power to ask his name;
</p>
<p>Whither he went or whence he came;
</p>
<p>Yet there was something in his eye
</p>
<p>That won my love, I knew not why.
</p>
<p>Once, when my scanty meal was spread,
</p>
<p>He entered  not a word he spake!

<p>Just perishing for want of bread;
</p>
<p>I gave him all; he blessed it, brake.
</p>
<p>And ate, but gave me part again;
</p>
<p>Mine was an angel's portion then,
</p>
<p>For while I fed with eager haste,
</p>
<p>The crust was manna to my taste.
</p>
<p>I spied him where a fountain burst,
</p>
<p>Clear from the rock  his strength was gone,
</p>
<p>The heedless water mock'd his thirst,
</p>
<p>He heard it, saw it hurrying on.
</p>
<p>I ran and raised the suff'rer up;
</p>
<p>Thrice from the stream he drain'd my cup,
</p>
<p>Dipp'd, and returned it running o'er;
</p>
<p>I drank and never thirsted more.
</p>
<p>'Twas night, the floods were out, it blew
</p>
<p>A winter hurricane aloof;
</p>
<p>I heard his voice, abroad, and flew
</p>
<p>To bid him welcome to my roof.
</p>
<p>198 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>I warmed, I clothed, I cheered my guest,
</p>
<p>I laid him on my couch to rest;
</p>
<p>Then made the earth my bed, and seem'd
</p>
<p>In Eden's garden while I dream'd.
</p>
<p>Stripp'd, wounded, beaten nigh to death,
</p>
<p>I found him by the highway side;
</p>
<p>I rous'd his pulse, brought back his breath,
</p>
<p>Revived his spirit, and supplied
</p>
<p>Wine, oil, refreshment  he was heal'd;
</p>
<p>I had myself a wound conceal'd;
</p>
<p>But from that hour forgot the smart.
</p>
<p>And peace bound up my broken heart.
</p>
<p>In pris'n I saw him next  condemned
</p>
<p>To meet a traitor's doom at morn;
</p>
<p>The tide of lying tongues I stemmed,
</p>
<p>And honored him 'mid shame and scorn.
</p>
<p>My friendship's utmost zeal to try,
</p>
<p>He asked, if I for him would die;
</p>
<p>The flesh was weak, my blood ran chill,
</p>
<p>But the free spirit cried, "I will!"
</p>
<p>Then in a moment to my view,
</p>
<p>The stranger started from disguise:
</p>
<p>The tokens in his hands I knew,
</p>
<p>The Savior stood before mine eyes.
</p>
<p>He spake  and my poor name he named 
</p>
<p>"Of me thou hast not been asham'd;
</p>
<p>These deeds shall thy memorial be;
</p>
<p>Fear not thou didst them unto me."
</p>
<p>The song is pathetic, and the tune quite plaintive, and was
</p>
<p>very much in accordance with our feelings at the time, for our
</p>
<p>spirits were all depressed, dull and gloomy, and surcharged with
</p>
<p>indefinite ominous forebodings. After a lapse of some time, Brother
</p>
<p>Hyrum requested me again to sing that song. I replied, "Brother

</p>
<p>Hyrum, I do not feel like singing," when he remarked, "Oh, never
</p>
<p>mind ; commence singing, and you will get the spirit of it." At his
</p>
<p>request I did so. Soon afterwards I was sitting at one of the front
</p>
<p>windows of the jail, when I saw a number of men, with painted
</p>
<p>faces, coming around the corner of the jail, and aiming towards the
</p>
<p>stairs. The other brethren had seen the same, for, as I went to the
</p>
<p>door, I found Brother Hyrum Smith and Dr. Richards already
</p>
<p>leaning against it. They both pressed against the door with their
</p>
<p>shoulders to prevent its being opened, as the lock and latch were
</p>
<p>comparatively useless. While in this position, the mob, who had
</p>
<p>come up stairs, and tried to open the door, probably thought it was
</p>
<p>locked, and fired a ball through the keyhole; at this Dr. Richards
</p>
<p>and Brother Hyrum leaped back from the door, with their faces
</p>
<p>towards it ; almost instantly another ball passed through the panel
</p>
<p>of the door, and struck Brother Hyrum on the left side of the nose,
</p>
<p>entering his face and head. At the same instant, another ball from
</p>
<p>the outside entered his back, passing through his body and striking
</p>
<p>his watch. The ball came from the back, through the jail window,
</p>
<p>opposite the door, and must, from its range, have been fired from
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 199
</p>
<p>the Carthage Grays, who were placed there ostensibly for our pro-
</p>
<p>tection, as the balls from the fire-arms, shot close by the jail, would
</p>
<p>have entered the ceiling, we being in the second story, and there
</p>
<p>never was a time after that when Hyrum could have received the
</p>
<p>latter wound. Immediately, when the balls struck him, he fell flat
</p>
<p>on his back, crying as he fell, "I am a dead man." He never moved
</p>
<p>afterwards.
</p>
<p>I shall never forget the deep feeling of sympathy and regard
</p>
<p>manifested in the countenance of Brother Joseph as he drew nigh
</p>
<p>to Hyrum, and, leaning over him, exclaimed, "Oh! my poor, dear
</p>
<p>brother Hyrum !" He, however, instantly arose, and with a firm,
</p>
<p>quick step, and a determined expression of countenance, approached
</p>
<p>the door, and pulling the six-shooter left by Brother Wheelock from
</p>
<p>his pocket, opened the door slightly, and snapped the pistol six
</p>
<p>successive times; only three of the barrels, however, were dis-
</p>
<p>charged. I afterwards understood that two or three were wounded
</p>
<p>by these discharges, two of whom, I am informed, died. I had in
</p>
<p>my hands a large, strong hickory stick, brought there by Brother
</p>
<p>Markham, and left by him, which I had seized as soon as I saw the
</p>
<p>mob approach; and while Brother Joseph was firing the pistol, I
</p>
<p>stood close behind him. As soon as he had discharged it he stepped
</p>
<p>back, and I immediately took his place next to the door, while he
</p>
<p>occupied the one I had done while he was shooting. Brother Rich-
</p>
<p>ards, at this time, had a knotty walking-stick in his hands belonging
</p>
<p>to me, and stood next to Brother Joseph, a little farther from the
</p>
<p>door, in an oblique direction, apparently to avoid the rake of the fire
</p>
<p>from the door. The firing of Brother Joseph made our assailants
</p>
<p>pause for a moment ; very soon after, however, they pushed the door
</p>
<p>some distance open, and protruded and discharged their guns into
</p>
<p>the room, when I parried them off with my stick, giving another
</p>
<p>direction to the balls.
</p>
<p>It certainly was a terrible scene : streams of fire as thick as my
</p>
<p>arm passed by me as these men fired, and, unarmed as we were, it

</p>
<p>looked like certain death. I remember feeling as though my time
</p>
<p>had come, but I do not know when, in any critical position, I was
</p>
<p>more calm, unruffled, energetic, and acted with more promptness
</p>
<p>and decision. It certainly was far from pleasant to be so near the
</p>
<p>muzzles of those fire-arms as they belched forth their liquid flames
</p>
<p>and deadly balls. While I was engaged in parrying the guns,
</p>
<p>Brother Joseph said, "That's right, Brother Taylor, parry them off
</p>
<p>as well as you can." These were the last words I ever heard him
</p>
<p>speak on earth.
</p>
<p>Every moment the crowd at the door became more dense, as
</p>
<p>they were unquestionably pressed on by those in the rear ascending
</p>
<p>the stairs, until the whole entrance at the door was literally crowded
</p>
<p>with muskets and rifles, which, with the swearing, shouting and
</p>
<p>demoniacal expressions of those outside the door and on the stairs,
</p>
<p>and the firing of the guns, mingled with their horrid oaths and
</p>
<p>execrations, made it look like pandemonium let loose, and was,
</p>
<p>indeed, a fit representation of the horrid deed in which they were
</p>
<p>engaged.

</p>
<p>The landing showing the hole in the door made by the ball that
</p>
<p>killed Hyrum Smith.
</p>
<p>202 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>After parrying the guns for some time, which now protruded
</p>
<p>thicker and farther into the room, and seeing no hope of escape or
</p>
<p>protection there, as we were now unarmed, it occurred to me that
</p>
<p>we might have some friends outside, and that there might be some
</p>
<p>chance of escape in that direction, but here there seemed to be
</p>
<p>none. As I expected them every moment to rush into the room 
</p>
<p>nothing but extreme cowardice having thus far kept them out  as
</p>
<p>the tumult and pressure increased, without any other hope, I made
</p>
<p>a spring for the window which was right in front of the jail door,
</p>
<p>where the mob was standing, and also exposed to the fire of the
</p>
<p>Carthage Grays, who were stationed some ten or twelve rods off.
</p>
<p>The weather was hot, we all of us had our coats off, and the window
</p>
<p>was raised to admit air. As I reached the window, and was on the
</p>
<p>point of leaping out, I was struck by a ball from the door about
</p>
<p>midway of my thigh, which struck the bone, and flattened out
</p>
<p>almost to the size of a quarter of a dollar, and then passed on
</p>
<p>through the fleshy part to within about half an inch of the outside.
</p>
<p>I think some prominent nerve must have been severed or injured,
</p>
<p>for, as soon as the ball struck me, I fell like a bird when shot, or
</p>
<p>an ox when struck by a butcher, and lost entirely and instantan-
</p>
<p>eously all power of action or locomotion. I fell upon the window-
</p>
<p>sill, and cried out, "I am shot!" Not possessing any power to move,
</p>
<p>I felt myself falling outside of the window, but immediately I fell
</p>
<p>inside, from some, at that time, unknown cause. When I struck the
</p>
<p>floor my animation seemed restored, as I have seen it sometimes
</p>
<p>in squirrels and birds after being shot. As soon as I felt the power
</p>
<p>of motion I crawled under the bed which was in a corner of the
</p>
<p>room, not far from the window where I received my wound. While
</p>
<p>on my way and under the bed I was wounded in three other places ;
</p>
<p>one ball entered a little below the left knee, and never was extracted ;
</p>
<p>another entered the forepart of my left arm, a little above the
</p>
<p>wrist, and, passing down by the joint, lodged in the fleshy part
</p>
<p>of my hand, about midway, a little above the upper joint of my

</p>
<p>little finger ; another struck me on the fleshy part of my left hip, and
</p>
<p>tore away the flesh as large as my hand, dashing the mangled frag-
</p>
<p>ments of flesh and blood against the wall.
</p>
<p>My wounds were painful, and the sensation produced was as
</p>
<p>though a ball had passed through and down the whole length of
</p>
<p>my leg. I very well remember my reflections at the time. I had a
</p>
<p>very painful idea of becoming lame and decrepid, and being an
</p>
<p>object of pity, and I felt as though I would rather die than be
</p>
<p>placed in such circumstances.
</p>
<p>It would seem that immediately after my attempt to leap out
</p>
<p>of the window, Joseph also did the same thing, of which circum-
</p>
<p>stance I have no knowledge only from information. The first thing
</p>
<p>that I noticed was a cry that he had leaped out of the window. A
</p>
<p>cessation of firing followed, the mob rushed down stairs, and Dr.
</p>
<p>Richards went to the window. Immediately afterwards I saw the
</p>
<p>doctor going towards the jail door, and as there was an iron door
</p>
<p>at the head of the stairs adjoining our door which led into the cells
</p>
<p>for criminals, it struck me that the doctor was going in there, and
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 203
</p>
<p>I said to him, "Stop, doctor, and take me along." He proceeded to
</p>
<p>the door and opened it, and then returned and dragged me along
</p>
<p>to a small cell prepared for criminals.
</p>
<p>Brother Richards was very much troubled, and exclaimed,
</p>
<p>"Oh! Brother Taylor, is it possible that they have killed both
</p>
<p>Brother Hyrum and Joseph ? it cannot surely be, and yet I saw them
</p>
<p>shoot them;" and, elevating his hands two or three times, he
</p>
<p>exclaimed, "Oh Lord, my God, spare thy servants!" He then said,
</p>
<p>"Brother Taylor, this is a terrible event;" and he dragged me
</p>
<p>farther into the cell, saying, "I am sorry I can do no better for
</p>
<p>you;" and, taking an old filthy mattress, he covered me with it,
</p>
<p>and said, "That may hide you, and you may yet live to tell the tale,
</p>
<p>but I expect they will kill me in a few moments." While lying in
</p>
<p>this position I suffered the most excruciating pain.
</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Dr. Richards came to me, informed me that
</p>
<p>the mob had precipitately fled, and at the same time confirmed my
</p>
<p>worst fears that Joseph was assuredly dead. I felt a dull, lonely,
</p>
<p>sickening sensation at the news. When I reflected that our noble
</p>
<p>chieftain, the prophet of the living God, had fallen, and that I had
</p>
<p>seen his brother in the cold embrace of death, it seemed as though
</p>
<p>there was a void or vacuum in the great field of human existence to
</p>
<p>me, and a dark, gloomy chasm in the kingdom, and that we were
</p>
<p>left alone. Oh how lonely was that feeling ! How cold, barren and
</p>
<p>desolate! In the midst of difficulties he was always the first in
</p>
<p>motion; in critical positions his counsel was always sought. As
</p>
<p>our prophet he approached our God, and obtained for us his will ;
</p>
<p>but now our prophet, our counselor, our general, our leader was
</p>
<p>gone, and amid the fiery ordeal that we then had to pass through,
</p>
<p>we were left alone without his aid, and as our future guide for
</p>
<p>things spiritual or temporal, and for all things pertaining to this
</p>
<p>world or the next, he had spoken for the last time on earth !
</p>
<p>These reflections and a thousand others flashed upon my mind.
</p>
<p>I thought, Why must the good perish, and the virtuous be destroyed ?

</p>
<p>Why must God's nobility, the salt of the earth, the most exalted
</p>
<p>of the human family, and the most perfect types of all excellence,
</p>
<p>fall victims to the cruel, fiendish hate of incarnate devils?
</p>
<p>The poignancy of my grief, I presume, however, was some-
</p>
<p>what allayed by the extreme suffering that I endured from my
</p>
<p>wounds.
</p>
<p>Soon afterwards I was taken to the head of the stairs and laid
</p>
<p>there, where I had a full view of our beloved and now murdered
</p>
<p>Brother Hyrum. There he lay as I had left him ; he had not moved
</p>
<p>a limb; he lay placid and calm, a monument of greatness even in
</p>
<p>death ; but his noble spirit had left its tenement, and was gone to
</p>
<p>dwell in regions more congenial to its exalted nature. Poor Hyrum !
</p>
<p>he was a great and good man, and my soul was cemented to his.
</p>
<p>If ever there was an exemplary, honest, and virtuous man, an em-
</p>
<p>bodiment of all that is noble in the human form, Hyrum Smith was
</p>
<p>its representative.
</p>
<p>While I lay there a number of persons came around, among
</p>
<p>whom was a physician. The doctor, on seeing a ball lodged in my
</p>
<p>204 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>left hand, took a penknife from his pocket and made an incision
</p>
<p>in it for the purpose of extracting the ball therefrom, and having
</p>
<p>obtained a pair of carpenter's compasses, made use of them to draw
</p>
<p>or pry out the ball, alternately using the penknife and compasses.
</p>
<p>After sawing for some time with a dull penknife, and prying and
</p>
<p>pulling with the compasses, he ultimately succeeded in extracting
</p>
<p>the ball, which weighed about half an ounce. Some time afterwards
</p>
<p>he remarked to a friend of mine that I had "nerves like the devil,"
</p>
<p>to stand what I did in its extraction. I really thought I had need
</p>
<p>of nerves to stand such surgical butchery, and that, whatever my
</p>
<p>nerves may be, his practice was devilish.
</p>
<p>This company wished to remove me to Mr. Hamilton's hotel,
</p>
<p>the place where we had staid previous to our incarceration in jail.
</p>
<p>I told them, however, that I did not wish to go ; I did not consider
</p>
<p>it safe. They protested that it was, and that I was safe with them ;
</p>
<p>that it was a perfect outrage for men to be used as we had been;
</p>
<p>that they were my friends; that it was for my good they were
</p>
<p>counseling me, and that I could be better taken care of there than
</p>
<p>here.
</p>
<p>I replied, "I don't know you. Who am I among? I am sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by assassins and murderers; witness your deeds! Don't
</p>
<p>talk to me of kindness or comfort; look at your murdered victims.
</p>
<p>Look at me ! I want none of your counsel nor comfort. There may
</p>
<p>be some safety here ; I can be assured of none anywhere," etc.
</p>
<p>They G  d  their souls to hell, made the most solemn asserva-
</p>
<p>tions, and swore by God and the devil, and everything else that they
</p>
<p>could think of, that they would stand by me to death and protect
</p>
<p>me. In half an hour every one of them had fled from the town.
</p>
<p>Soon after a coroner's jury were assembled in the room over
</p>
<p>the body of Hyrum. Among the jurors was Captain Smith, of the
</p>
<p>Carthage Grays, who had assisted in the murder, and the same
</p>
<p>justice before whom we had been tried. I learned of Francis Higbee
</p>
<p>as being in the neighborhood. On hearing his name mentioned, I

</p>
<p>immediately arose and said, "Captain Smith, you are a justice of
</p>
<p>the peace ; I have heard his name mentioned ; I want to swear my
</p>
<p>life against him." I was informed that word was immediately sent
</p>
<p>to him to leave the place, which he did.
</p>
<p>Brother Richards was busy during this time attending to the
</p>
<p>coroner's inquest, and to the removal of the bodies, and making
</p>
<p>arrangements for their removal from Carthage to Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>When he had a little leisure, he again came to me, and at his
</p>
<p>suggestion I was removed to Hamilton's tavern. I felt that he was
</p>
<p>the only friend, the only person, that I could rely upon in that
</p>
<p>town. It was with difficulty that sufficient persons could be found
</p>
<p>to carry me to the tavern; for immediately after the murder a
</p>
<p>great fear fell upon all the people, and men, women, and children
</p>
<p>fled with great precipitation, leaving nothing nor anybody in the
</p>
<p>town but two or three women and children and one or two sick
</p>
<p>persons.
</p>
<p>It was with great difficulty that Brother Richards prevailed
</p>
<p>upon Mr. Hamilton, hotel-keeper, and his family, to stay; they
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 205
</p>
<p>would not until Brother Richards had given a solemn promise that
</p>
<p>he would see them protected, and hence I was looked upon as a
</p>
<p>hostage. Under these circumstances, notwithstanding, I believe
</p>
<p>they were hostile to the Mormons, and were glad that the murder
</p>
<p>had taken place, though they did not actually participate in it;
</p>
<p>and, feeling that I should be a protection to them, they staid.
</p>
<p>The whole community knew that a dreadful outrage had been
</p>
<p>perpetrated by those villains, and fearing lest the citizens of
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, as they possessed the power, might have a disposition to
</p>
<p>visit them with a terrible vengeance, they fled in the wildest con-
</p>
<p>fusion. And, indeed, it was with very great difficulty that the
</p>
<p>citizens of Nauvoo could be restrained. A horrid, barbarous murder
</p>
<p>had been committed, the most solemn pledge violated, and that,
</p>
<p>too, while the victims were, contrary to the requirements of the
</p>
<p>law, putting themselves into the hands of the governor to pacify
</p>
<p>a popular excitement. This outrage was enhanced by the reflection
</p>
<p>that our people were able to protect themselves against not only all
</p>
<p>the mob, but against three times their number and that of the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor's troops put together. They were also exasperated by the
</p>
<p>speech of the governor in town.
</p>
<p>The whole events were so faithless, so dastardly, so mean,
</p>
<p>cowardly, and contemptible, without one extenuating circumstance,
</p>
<p>that it would not have been surprising if the citizens of Nauvoo had
</p>
<p>arisen en masse, and blotted the wretches out of existence. The
</p>
<p>citizens of Carthage knew they would have done so under such
</p>
<p>circumstances, and, judging us by themselves, they were all panic-
</p>
<p>stricken, and fled. Colonel Markham, too, after his expulsion from
</p>
<p>Carthage, had gone home, related the circumstances of his eject-
</p>
<p>ment, and was using his influence to get a company to ero out. Fear-
</p>
<p>ing that when the people heard that their prophet and patriarch had
</p>
<p>been murdered under the above circumstances they might act
</p>
<p>rashly, and knowing that if they once got roused, like a mighty
</p>

<p>a terrible vengeance  as none of the Twelve were in Nauvoo, and
</p>
<p>no one, perhaps, with sufficient influence to control the people,
</p>
<p>Dr. Richards, after consulting me, wrote the following note, fearing
</p>
<p>that my family might be seriously affected by the news. I told him
</p>
<p>to insert that I was slightly wounded.

<p>Willard Richards' Note from Carthage Jail to Nauvoo *

<p>"Joseph and Hyrum are dead. Taylor wounded, not very badly.
</p>
<p>I am well. Our guard was forced, as we believe, by a band of Mis-
</p>
<p>sourians from 100 to 200. The job was done in an instant, and the
</p>
<p>party fled towards Nauvoo instantly. This is as I believe it. The
</p>
<p>citizens here are afraid of the 'Mormons' attacking them ; I promise
</p>
<p>them no. W. Richards.

</p>
<p>206 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>I remember signing my name as quickly as possible, lest the
</p>
<p>tremor of my hand should be noticed, and the fears of my family
</p>
<p>excited.
</p>
<p>A messenger was dispatched immediately with the note, but
</p>
<p>he was intercepted by the governor, who, on hearing a cannon fired
</p>
<p>at Carthage, which was to be the signal for the murder, immediately
</p>
<p>fled with his company, and fearing that the citizens of Nauvoo,
</p>
<p>when apprised of the horrible outrage, would immediately rise and
</p>
<p>pursue, he turned back the messenger, who was George D. Grant.
</p>
<p>A second one was sent, who was treated similarly; and not until
</p>
<p>a third attempt could news be got to Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>Samuel H. Smith, brother to Joseph and Hyrum, was the first
</p>
<p>brother I saw after the outrage ; I am not sure whether he took the
</p>
<p>news or not ; he lived at the time in Plymouth, Hancock County, and
</p>
<p>was on his way to Carthage to see his brothers, when he was met
</p>
<p>by some of the troops, or rather mob, that had been dismissed by
</p>
<p>the governor, and who were on their way home. On learning that
</p>
<p>he was Joseph Smiths brother they sought to kill him, but he
</p>
<p>escaped, and fled into the woods, where he was chased for a length
</p>
<p>of time by them ; but, after severe fatigue, and much danger and
</p>
<p>excitement, he succeeded in escaping, and came to Carthage. He
</p>
<p>was on horseback when he arrived, and was not only very much
</p>
<p>tired with the fatigue and excitement of the chase, but was also
</p>
<p>very much distressed in feelings on account of the death of his
</p>
<p>brothers. These things produced a fever, which laid the foundation
</p>
<p>for his death, which took place on the 30th of July. Thus another
</p>
<p>of the brothers fell a victim although not directly, but indirectly to
</p>
<p>this infernal mob.
</p>
<p>I lay from about five o'clock until two next morning without
</p>
<p>having my wounds dressed, as there was scarcely any help of any
</p>
<p>kind in Carthage, and Brother Richards was busy with the dead
</p>
<p>bodies, preparing them for removal. My wife Leonora started early
</p>
<p>the next day, having had some little trouble in getting a company

</p>
<p>or a physician to come with her; after considerable difficulty she
</p>
<p>succeeded in getting an escort, and Dr. Samuel Bennett came along
</p>
<p>with her. Soon after my father and mother arrived from Oquakie,
</p>
<p>near which place they had a farm at that time, and hearing of the
</p>
<p>trouble hastened along.
</p>
<p>General Demming, Brigadier General of the Hancock County
</p>
<p>Militia, was very much of a gentleman, and showed me every
</p>
<p>courtesy, and Colonel Jones also was very solicitous about my wel-
</p>
<p>fare.
</p>
<p>I was called upon by several gentlemen of Quincy and other
</p>
<p>places, among whom was Judge Ralston, as well as by our own
</p>
<p>people, and a medical man extracted a ball from my left thigh that
</p>
<p>was giving me much pain ; it lay about half an inch deep, and my
</p>
<p>thigh was considerably swollen. The doctor asked me if I would
</p>
<p>be tied during the operation ; I told him no ; that I could endure the
</p>
<p>cutting associated with the operation as well without, and I did so ;
</p>
<p>indeed, so great was the pain I endured that the cutting was rather
</p>
<p>a relief than otherwise.
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 207
</p>
<p>A very laughable incident occurred at the time; my wife
</p>
<p>Leonora went into an adjoining room to pray for me, that I might
</p>
<p>be sustained during the operation. While on her knees at prayer, a
</p>
<p>Mrs. Bedell, an old lady of the Methodist association, entered, and,
</p>
<p>patting Mrs. Taylor on her back with her hand, said, "There's a
</p>
<p>good lady, pray for God to forgive your sins, pray that you may
</p>
<p>be converted, and the Lord may have mercy on your soul."
</p>
<p>The scene was so ludicrous that Mrs. Taylor knew not whether
</p>
<p>to laugh or be angry. Mrs. Taylor informed me that Mr. Hamilton,
</p>
<p>the father of the Hamilton who kept the house, rejoiced at the mur-
</p>
<p>der, and said in company that "it was done up in the best possible
</p>
<p>style, and showed good generalship ;" and she further' believed that
</p>
<p>the other branches of the family sanctioned it. These were the
</p>
<p>associates of the old lady referred to, and yet she could talk of con-
</p>
<p>version and saving souls in the midst of blood and murder : such is
</p>
<p>man and such consistency.
</p>
<p>The ball being extracted was the one that first struck me,
</p>
<p>which I before referred to: it entered on the outside of my left
</p>
<p>thigh, about five inches from my knee, and, passing rather obliquely
</p>
<p>towards my body, had, it would seem, struck the bone, for it was
</p>
<p>flatted out nearly as thin and large as a quarter of a dollar.
</p>
<p>The governor passed on, staying at Carthage only a few min-
</p>
<p>utes, and he did not stop until he got fifty miles from Nauvoo. There
</p>
<p>had been various opinions about the complicity of the governor in
</p>
<p>the murder, some supposing that he knew all about it, and assisted
</p>
<p>or winked at its execution. It is somewhat difficult to form a correct
</p>
<p>opinion; from the facts presented it is very certain that things
</p>
<p>looked more than suspicious against him.
</p>
<p>In the first place, he positively knew that we had broken no
</p>
<p>law.
</p>
<p>Secondly. He knew that the mob had not only passed inflam-
</p>
<p>matory resolutions, threatening extermination to the Mormons, but
</p>
<p>that they had actually assembled armed mobs and commenced hos-

</p>
<p>tilities against us.
</p>
<p>Thirdly. He took those very mobs that had been arrayed
</p>
<p>against us, and enrolled them as his troops, thus legalizing their
</p>
<p>acts.
</p>
<p>Fourthly. He disbanded the Nauvoo Legion, which had never
</p>
<p>violated law, and disarmed them, and had about his person in the
</p>
<p>shape of militia known mobocrats and violaters of the law.
</p>
<p>Fifthly. He requested us to come to Carthage without arms,
</p>
<p>promising protection, and then refused to interfere in delivering
</p>
<p>us from prison, although Joseph and Hyrum were put there con-
</p>
<p>trary to law.
</p>
<p>Sixthly. Although he refused to interfere in our behalf, yet,
</p>
<p>when Captain Smith went to him and informed him that the persons
</p>
<p>refused to come out, he told him that he had a command and knew
</p>
<p>what to do, thus sanctioning the use of force in the violation of law
</p>
<p>when opposed to us, whereas he would not for us interpose his
</p>
<p>executive authority to free us from being incarcerated contrary
</p>
<p>208 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>to law, although he was fully informed of all the facts of the case,
</p>
<p>as we kept him posted in the affairs all the time.
</p>
<p>Seventhly. He left the prisoners in Carthage jail contrary to
</p>
<p>his plighted faith.
</p>
<p>Eighthly. Before he went he dismissed all the troops that could
</p>
<p>be relied upon, as well as many of the mob, and left us in charge of
</p>
<p>the "Carthage Grays," a company that he knew were mobocratic,
</p>
<p>our most bitter enemies, and who had passed resolutions to extermi-
</p>
<p>nate us, and who had been placed under guard by General Demming
</p>
<p>only the day before.
</p>
<p>Ninthly. He was informed of the intended murder, both be-
</p>
<p>fore he left and while on the road, by several different parties.
</p>
<p>Tenthly. When the cannon was fired in Carthage, signifying
</p>
<p>that the deed was done, he immediately took up his line of march and
</p>
<p>fled. How did he know that this signal portrayed their death if he
</p>
<p>was not in the secret? It may be said some of the party told him.
</p>
<p>How could he believe what the party said about the gun signal if
</p>
<p>he could not believe the testimony of several individuals who told
</p>
<p>him in positive terms about the contemplated murder?
</p>
<p>He has, I believe, stated that he left the "Carthage Grays" there
</p>
<p>because he considered that, as their town was contiguous to ours,
</p>
<p>and as the responsibility of our safety rested solely upon them,
</p>
<p>they would not dare suffer any indignity to befall us. This very ad-
</p>
<p>mission shows that he did really expect danger ; and then he knew
</p>
<p>that these people had published to the world that they would ex-
</p>
<p>terminate us, and his leaving us in their hands and taking of their
</p>
<p>responsibilities was like leaving a lamb in charge of a wolf, and
</p>
<p>trusting to its humanity and honor for its safe-keeping.
</p>
<p>It is said, again that he would not have gone to Nauvoo, and
</p>
<p>thus placed himself in the hands of the Mormons, if he had antici-
</p>
<p>pated any such event, as he would be exposed to their wrath. To
</p>
<p>this it may be answered that the Mormons did not know their sig-
</p>
<p>nals, while he did ; and they were also known in Warsaw, as well as
</p>

</p>
<p>in other places; and as soon as the gun was fired, a merchant of
</p>
<p>Warsaw jumped upon his horse and rode directly to Quincy, and
</p>
<p>reported "Joseph and Hyrum killed, and those who were with them
</p>
<p>in jail." He reported further that "they were attempting to break
</p>
<p>jail, and were all killed by the guard." This was their story ; it was
</p>
<p>anticipated to kill all, and the gun was to be the signal that the deed
</p>
<p>was accomplished. This was known in Warsaw. The governor also
</p>
<p>knew it and fled ; and he could really be in no danger in Nauvoo, for
</p>
<p>the Mormons did not know it, and he had plenty of time to escape,
</p>
<p>which he did.
</p>
<p>It is said that he made all his officers promise solemnly that
</p>
<p>they would help him to protect the Smiths ; this may or may not be.
</p>
<p>At any rate, some of these officers helped to murder them.
</p>
<p>The strongest argument in the governor's favor, and one that
</p>
<p>would bear more weight with us than all the rest put together,
</p>
<p>would be that he could not believe them capable of such atrocity;
</p>
<p>and, thinking that their talk and threatenings were a mere ebulli-
</p>
<p>tion of feeling, a kind of braggadocio, and that there was enough of
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 209
</p>
<p>good moral feeling to control the more violent passions, he trusted
</p>
<p>to their faith. There is, indeed, a degree of plausibility about this,
</p>
<p>but when we put it in juxtaposition to the amount of evidence that
</p>
<p>he was in possession of, it weighs very little. He had nothing to in-
</p>
<p>spire confidence in them, and everything to make him mistrust them.
</p>
<p>Besides, why his broken faith? why his disregard of what was told
</p>
<p>him by several parties ? Again, if he knew not the plan, how did he
</p>
<p>understand the signal? Why so oblivious to everything pertaining
</p>
<p>to the Mormon interest, and so alive and interested about the mobo-
</p>
<p>crats? At any rate, be this as it may, he stands responsible for
</p>
<p>their blood, and it is dripping on his garments. If it had not been
</p>
<p>for his promise of protection, they would have protected them-
</p>
<p>selves; it was plighted faith that led them to the slaughter; and
</p>
<p>to make the best of it, it was a breach of that faith and a non-
</p>
<p>fulfillment of that promise, after repeated warning, that led to
</p>
<p>their death.
</p>
<p>Having said so much, I must leave the governor with my read-
</p>
<p>ers and with his God. Justice, I conceive, demanded this much, and
</p>
<p>truth could not be told with less ; as I have said before, my opinion
</p>
<p>is that the governor would not have planned this murder, but he
</p>
<p>had not sufficient energy to resist popular opinion, even if that
</p>
<p>opinion led to blood and death.
</p>
<p>It was rumored that a strong political party, numbering in its
</p>
<p>ranks many of the prominent men of the nation, were engaged in a
</p>
<p>plot for the overthrow of Joseph Smith, and that the governor was
</p>
<p>of this party, and Sharp, Williams, Captain Smith, and others were
</p>
<p>his accomplices, but whether this was the case or not I do not know.
</p>
<p>It is very certain that a strong political feeling existed against Jo-
</p>
<p>seph Smith, and I have reason to believe that his letters to Henry
</p>
<p>Clay, were made use of by political parties opposed to Mr. Clay,
</p>
<p>and were the means of that statesman's defeat. Yet, if such a com-
</p>
<p>bination as the one referred to existed, I am not apprised of it.
</p>
<p>While I lay at Carthage, previous to Mrs. Taylor's arrival, a

</p>
<p>pretty good sort of a man, who was lame of a leg, waited upon me,
</p>
<p>and sat up at night with me ; afterwards Mrs. Taylor, mother and
</p>
<p>others waited upon me.
</p>
<p>Many friends called upon me, among whom were Richard
</p>
<p>Ballantyne, Elizabeth Taylor, several of the Perkins Family, and a
</p>
<p>number of the brethren from Macedonia and La Harpe. Besides
</p>
<p>these, many strangers from Quincy, some of whom expressed in-
</p>
<p>dignant feelings against the mob and sympathy for myself. Brother
</p>
<p>Alexander Williams called upon me, who suspected that they had
</p>
<p>some designs in keeping me there, and stated that he had, at a giv-
</p>
<p>en point in some woods, fifty men, and if I would say the word he
</p>
<p>would raise another fifty, and fetch me out of there. I thanked
</p>
<p>him, but told him I thought there was no need. However, it would
</p>
<p>seem that I was in some danger ; for Colonel Jones, before referred
</p>
<p>to, when absent from me, left two loaded pistols on the table in
</p>
<p>case of an attack, and some time afterward, when I had recovered
</p>
<p>and was publishing the affair, a lawyer, Mr. Backman, stated that
</p>
<p>he had prevented a man by the name of Jackson, before referred
</p>
<p>to, from ascending the stairs, who was coming with a design to
</p>
<p>210 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>murder me, and that now he was sorry he had not let him do the
</p>
<p>deed.
</p>
<p>There were others also, of whom I heard, that said I ought to
</p>
<p>be killed, and they would do it, but that it was too damned cowardly
</p>
<p>to shoot a wounded man; and thus, by the chivalry of murderers,
</p>
<p>I was prevented from being a second time mutilated or killed. Many
</p>
<p>of the mob, came around and treated me with apparent respect,
</p>
<p>and the officers and people generally looked upon me as a hostage,
</p>
<p>and feared that my removal would be the signal for the rising of
</p>
<p>the Mormons.
</p>
<p>I do not remember the time that I stayed at Carthage, but I
</p>
<p>think three or four days after the murder, when Brother Marks
</p>
<p>with a carriage, Brother James Allred with a wagon, Dr. Ells, and
</p>
<p>a number of others on horseback, came for the purpose of taking
</p>
<p>me to Nauvoo. I was very weak at the time, occasioned by the loss
</p>
<p>of blood and the great discharge of my wounds, so when my wife
</p>
<p>asked me if I could talk I could barely whisper, no. Quite a dis-
</p>
<p>cussion arose as to the propriety of my removal, the physician and
</p>
<p>people of Carthage protesting that it would be my death, while
</p>
<p>my friends were anxious for my removal if possible.
</p>
<p>I suppose the former were actuated by the above-named desire
</p>
<p>to keep me. Colonel Jones was, I believe, sincere ; he had acted as a
</p>
<p>friend all the time, and he told Mrs. Taylor she ought to persuade
</p>
<p>me not to go, for he did not believe I had strength enough to reach
</p>
<p>Nauvoo. It was finally agreed, however, that I should go; but it
</p>
<p>was thought that I could not stand riding in a wagon or carriage,
</p>
<p>they prepared a litter for me; I was carried down stairs and put
</p>
<p>upon it. A number of men assisted to carry me, some of them had
</p>
<p>been engaged in the mob. As soon as I got down stairs, I felt much
</p>
<p>better and strengthened, so that I could talk; I suppose the effect
</p>
<p>of the fresh air.
</p>
<p>When we got near the outside of the town I remembered some
</p>
<p>woods that we had to go through, and telling a person near to call

</p>
<p>for Dr. Ells, who was riding a very good horse, I said, ''Doctor, I
</p>
<p>perceive that the people are getting fatigued with carrying me ; a
</p>
<p>number of Mormons live about two or three miles from here, near
</p>
<p>our route, will you ride to their settlement as quick as possible, and
</p>
<p>have them come and meet us?" He started off on a gallop im-
</p>
<p>mediately. My object in this was to obtain protection in case of an
</p>
<p>attack, rather than to obtain help to carry me.
</p>
<p>Very soon after the men from Carthage made one excuse after
</p>
<p>another until they had all left, and I felt glad to get rid of them. I
</p>
<p>found that the tramping of those carrying me produced violent pain,
</p>
<p>and a sleigh was produced and attached to the hind end of Brother
</p>
<p>James Allred's wagon, a bed placed upon it, and I propped up on
</p>
<p>the bed. Mrs. Taylor rode with me, applying ice and ice-water to
</p>
<p>my wounds. As the sleigh was dragged over the grass on the
</p>
<p>prairie, which was quite tall, it moved very easy and gave me very
</p>
<p>little pain.
</p>
<p>When I got within five or six miles of Nauvoo the brethren
</p>
<p>commenced to meet me from the city, and they increased in num-
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 211
</p>
<p>ber as we drew nearer, until there was a very large company of
</p>
<p>people of all ages and both sexes, principally, however, men.
</p>
<p>For some time there had been almost incessant rain, so that in
</p>
<p>many low places on the prairie it was from one to three feet deep
</p>
<p>in water, and at such places the brethren whom we met took hold
</p>
<p>of the sleigh, lifted it, and carried it over the water ; and when we
</p>
<p>arrived in the neighborhood of the city, where the roads were ex-
</p>
<p>cessively muddy and bad, the brethren tore down the fences, and
</p>
<p>we passed through the fields.
</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the difference of feeling that I experienced
</p>
<p>between the place that I had left and the one I had now arrived
</p>
<p>at. I had left a lot of reckless, bloodthirsty murderers, and had
</p>
<p>come to the City of the Saints, the people of the living God ; friends
</p>
<p>of truth and righteousness, thousands of whom stood there with
</p>
<p>warm, true hearts to offer their friendship and services, and to
</p>
<p>welcome my return. It is true it was a painful scene, and brought
</p>
<p>sorrowful remembrance to mind, but to me it caused a thrill of joy
</p>
<p>to find myself once more in the bosom of my friends, and to meet
</p>
<p>with the cordial welcome of true, honest hearts. What was very
</p>
<p>remarkable, I found myself very much better after my arrival at
</p>
<p>Nauvoo than I was when I started on my journey, although I had
</p>
<p>traveled eighteen miles.
</p>
<p>The next day as some change was wanting, I told Mrs. Taylor
</p>
<p>that if she could send to Dr. Richards, he had my purse and watch,
</p>
<p>and they would find money in my purse.
</p>
<p>Previous to the doctor leaving Carthage, I told him that he had
</p>
<p>better take my purse and watch, for I was afraid the people would
</p>
<p>steal them. The doctor had taken my pantaloons' pocket, and put
</p>
<p>the watch in it with the purse, cut off the pocket, and tied a string
</p>
<p>around the top; it was in this position when brought home. My
</p>
<p>family, however, were not a little startled to find that my watch
</p>
<p>had been struck with a ball. I sent for my vest, and, upon exam-
</p>
<p>ination, it was found that there was a cut as if with a knife, in the

</p>
<p>vest pocket which had contained my watch. In the pocket the frag-
</p>
<p>ments of the glass were found literally ground to powder. It then
</p>
<p>occurred to me that a ball had struck me at the time I felt myself
</p>
<p>falling out of the window, and that it was this force that threw me
</p>
<p>inside. I had often remarked to Mrs. Taylor the singular fact of
</p>
<p>finding myself inside the room, when I felt a moment before after
</p>
<p>being shot, that I was falling out, and I never could account for it
</p>
<p>until then; but here the thing was fully elucidated, and was ren-
</p>
<p>dered plain to my mind. I was indeed falling out, when some vil-

<p>lain aimed at my heart. The ball struck my watch, and forced me
</p>
<p>back ; If I had fallen out I should assuredly have been killed, if not
</p>
<p>by the fall, by those around, and this ball intended to dispatch me,
</p>
<p>was turned by an overruling Providence into a messenger of mercy,
</p>
<p>and saved my life. I shall never forget the feelings of gratitude
</p>
<p>that I then experienced towards my Heavenly Father; the whole
</p>
<p>scene was vividly portrayed before me, and my heart melted before
</p>
<p>the Lord. I felt that the Lord had preserved me by a special act of

<p>to perform upon the earth.

<p>AN EYE WITNESS TO JOSEPH SMITH'S DEATH
</p>
<p>Col. M. B. Darnell of Sheldon, Iowa, has been visiting Salt Lake
</p>
<p>City. He is an interesting figure to the people of Utah in that he is
</p>
<p>probably the only living eye witness of the assassination of the
</p>
<p>Prophet Joseph Smith at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 1844.
</p>
<p>"You know it is a long time since then," said Col. Darnell.
</p>
<p>"It is fifty years ago, and my memory may be faulty in some par-
</p>
<p>ticulars, but I will relate that only which I remember distinctly.
</p>
<p>When the Mormons came to Commerce, they changed the name to
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, and built the place up rapidly until there were about
</p>
<p>15,000 people in the city. The inhabitants of that part of the state
</p>
<p>were of the rougher element to a great extent. The county offices
</p>
<p>were profitable positions, because there was big opportunity
</p>
<p>for stealing, so there was considerable rivalry between Whigs
</p>
<p>and Democrats as to who should get in. The Mormons were
</p>
<p>not in it as a political party, but they held the balance of power,
</p>
<p>and of course they voted for those they considered the best
</p>
<p>men. This caused great hostility toward the Mormons on the
</p>
<p>part of the 'antis.' They wanted to get rid of the Mormons for
</p>
<p>political reasons, so they fed the feeling against them. There was
</p>
<p>lots of stealing going on, and it was charged to the Mormons. The
</p>
<p>women and children were taught to believe the Mormons guilty,
</p>
<p>but I do not. I know that stealing was done by others, and that
</p>
<p>the Mormons as a community were not chargeable with it. Of
</p>
<p>course there may have been some Mormons who stole, but it was
</p>
<p>mostly the rough element, and the fire-eating anti-Mormons ac-
</p>
<p>cused the Mormons so as to get them driven out. The 'law and

</p>
<p>order' men, as we called them, wanted the courts to settle all mat-
</p>
<p>ters, and were called 'Jack-Mormons' by the 'antis.' I was a stu-
</p>
<p>dent under General M. R. Demming. He got me a commission as
</p>
<p>lieutenant from Gov. Ford. He commanded the mob that arrested
</p>
<p>the Smiths at Nauvoo, but he was there as a friend of order. I call
</p>
<p>the posse comitatus that made the arrest a mob, because that was
</p>
<p>what it really was. They went through the process of law merely
</p>
<p>for form's sake. It was called a war at that time. When the posse
</p>
<p>was called by the sheriff, John Carlin, I was in the crowd and con-
</p>
<p>sidered myself summoned, as it were, to assist in making the arrest.
</p>
<p>"My recollection is we were there in Carthage a week. We
</p>
<p>went just outside the town and pitched our tents. We camped there
</p>
<p>and played soldiers as well as we knew how. Some way or other,
</p>
<p>I do not know how, communication was had by which the Smiths
</p>
<p>agreed to give themselves up, and the officers went out and met
</p>
<p>them about half way in the prairie and brought them in. They
</p>
<p>took them to the Hamilton house, a hotel, and held them there for
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 213
</p>
<p>a couple of days, probably determining in their own mind what they
</p>
<p>were going to do. As an officer on Gen. Demming's staff it was my
</p>
<p>duty to take this company called the Carthage Greys, down to the
</p>
<p>hotel and form a hollow square, and they had a man with them by
</p>
<p>the name, I think, of Scribling. He was attorney or counselor for
</p>
<p>the prisoners, I understood. They put the prisoners in the center
</p>
<p>of the square and marched them down to the general headquarters
</p>
<p>while they had their conference. The posse had the Smiths in their
</p>
<p>power and seemed disposed to make terms of some kind to determine
</p>
<p>what course would be pursued. At the end of about a couple of
</p>
<p>days they were placed in jail, which was a two story stone struc-
</p>
<p>ture and overhead were very nice rooms, in one of which there was
</p>
<p>a bed. They were called the debtors' rooms. Very soon after the
</p>
<p>prisoners were placed in jail, it might have been the same day,
</p>
<p>the troops as we called them, were all called together and Gov.
</p>
<p>Ford addressed them. In his speech he stated that the object of
</p>
<p>their assembling had been accomplished; that the writ had been
</p>
<p>executed and the parties were in jail. He commanded the
</p>
<p>troops to disband and go to their several places of abode, and most
</p>
<p>of them did so.
</p>
<p>"On the afternoon of the day of the assassination, the mob who
</p>
<p>did the killing came up. They had their faces painted a sort of
</p>
<p>brown color. I saw this crowd of men coming up from the direc-
</p>
<p>tion of the creek at the northwest corner of the pasture. I was
</p>
<p>standing within ten or twenty steps of the pasture gate east of the
</p>
<p>jail. The crowd was coming single file, and stooping down. They
</p>
<p>had on blue hunting shirts. I knew something terrible was going to
</p>
<p>happen. I was a youth at the time and became transfixed to the
</p>
<p>spot. As the crowd turned the southwest corner of the jail, about
</p>
<p>one-half of them went right up the stairway, the other half came
</p>
<p>right against me. I got out of their way, and a moment afterwards
</p>
<p>I heard the report of a gun in the house. That was supposed to be
</p>
<p>the shot which killed Hyrum Smith. Joseph started to jump

</p>
<p>through the window, and the mob fired at him. He came out on
</p>
<p>the east side of the building. There was a large well just under-
</p>
<p>neath there and he fell just outside the curb. Joseph was killed
</p>
<p>while passing out of the window. The Carthage Greys, it is said 
</p>
<p>and I have no doubt with truth, for I look at this thing very dif-
</p>
<p>ferent now from what I did then, because I know more about men,
</p>
<p>their motives and dispositions  I say there is no doubt that the
</p>
<p>Carthage Greys were cognizant of the fact that that mob was com-
</p>
<p>ing. I believe every man of them knew it, and I also believe that
</p>
<p>their guns were charged with blank cartridges. When they fired
</p>
<p>a few shots at the mob no one was hurt. The faces of the mob were
</p>
<p>painted a kind of Indian color. The Carthage Greys were a very
</p>
<p>nicely drilled company. It would seem to me that the mob were not
</p>
<p>any larger in number than the Carthage Greys. From my recol-
</p>
<p>lection I think the number was very nearly equal  about thirty or
</p>
<p>forty men in each. I do not believe that the estimate of one hun-
</p>
<p>dred men in the mob is at all correct. Probably there were fifty
</p>
<p>to eighty in the mob; I thought there were less. It was thought
</p>
<p>there at the time that Thomas C. Sharp was the ringleader  the
</p>
<p>214 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>moving spirit of the mob. He commenced life as an attorney, but
</p>
<p>did not succeed, and became a newspaper editor. When I last saw
</p>
<p>him, several years ago, he was quite aged. I know there was such
</p>
<p>a man as William M. Daniels, but do not know what became of
</p>
<p>him. I knew Frank Worrell, commander of the guard at the jail. He
</p>
<p>was afterwards killed outside of Nauvoo, during the Mormon war
</p>
<p>in 1846. I also knew Alexander Sympson and his sons. They were
</p>
<p>at the jail. They were fiery anti-Mormons.
</p>
<p>"I remember to have seen Joseph Smith jump from the win-
</p>
<p>dow. It was a terribly exciting time and it all happened in an
</p>
<p>instant. I cannot describe it in any better way than by saying he
</p>
<p>came out just as though some one big and powerful had thrown him
</p>
<p>right through the window. Undoubtedly, however, he came by his
</p>
<p>own effort. He certainly did not hang to the window. It seems
</p>
<p>to me he came out head first, and he was shot while passing through
</p>
<p>the window. I do not know that I really saw any one set him up
</p>
<p>against the well. I know I partially saw it and got it from what
</p>
<p>they said at the time. I could not hear distinctly what Joseph said
</p>
<p>when he fell, but it seemed to me to be, "0 Lord, My God." That
</p>
<p>was all he said. I think he raised himself to a sitting position. A
</p>
<p>young man went up and struck him either with the end of his gun
</p>
<p>or a bayonet, after he was dead, you may say. I did not notice
</p>
<p>whether they fired into him after he was set up by the well. I
</p>
<p>have the idea, however, that the young man went up to him and
</p>
<p>ran his bayonet through him, or rushed at him with his gun. I do
</p>
<p>not believe there was a gun fired after he struck the ground, and
</p>
<p>still I may be mistaken. I tell you those bullets came instantaneous-
</p>
<p>ly. I did not notice any one raise a knife for the purpose of sever-
</p>
<p>ing Joseph's head from his body, but I heard at the time that a
</p>
<p>young man did so. Those things might have been true. I was not
</p>
<p>one of the mob, but was one of the disbanded posse. I was going to
</p>
<p>the pasture after my horse, and was so close at the time that if I
</p>
<p>had been dressed like the mob I might have been considered one of

</p>
<p>their number. The young man who struck Joseph claimed to be a
</p>
<p>son of Gov. Boggs. He rushed from the mob after Joseph was set
</p>
<p>up and struck him with the point of his gun or bayonet, and said,
</p>
<p>"G  d  you ; you are the man that had my father shot." Of course
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith might have been alive with the bullets in his body,
</p>
<p>and have set himself up. I am satisfied he was alive then. If a
</p>
<p>gun was fired at him after he fell from the window I don't remember
</p>
<p>it. My memory is dim on some things, but I know there was great
</p>
<p>excitement just at the time.
</p>
<p>"The firing was .all done in a moment. Then there was a sort
</p>
<p>of recognition between the Carthage Greys and the mob, as they
</p>
<p>mingled after Joseph was lying dead on the ground. I remember
</p>
<p>now that there was some talk right on the ground there within
</p>
<p>twenty minutes after the assassination about a man going up with
</p>
<p>a knife to cut off Joseph's head or disembowel him. I did not hear
</p>
<p>any reason given why he did not carry out his threat. I merely
</p>
<p>heard the young man say what I have stated as he made a lunge
</p>
<p>at him. I was away perhaps eleven or twelve feet. The guns were
</p>
<p>rattling and the men were swearing.
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 215
</p>
<p>"In a little while the mob went back the way they came, where
</p>
<p>I understood they had animals to help them away. I could not
</p>
<p>recognize the mobbers very well, because of their disguise, but I
</p>
<p>remember Sharp, Hendricks, Davis and some of the others, who
</p>
<p>were afterwards known as having been there. It was a terrible
</p>
<p>deed, and the law and order people there have no excuse for it.
</p>
<p>We were not civilized there then as we are now, but there was
</p>
<p>nothing to justify the assassination. It was the work of fiery anti-
</p>
<p>Mormons who wanted the Mormons driven out of the state."

<p>THE KILLING OF JOSEPH AND HYRUM
</p>
<p>(Note: One day when visiting Mr. S. H. Goodwin, Secretary of
</p>
<p>the Masonic Lodge of Salt Lake City, he stated that when visiting
</p>
<p>the Chicago City Library, the Manuscript Department, he saw a
</p>
<p>letter written by Col. Williams, the leader of the mob who murdered
</p>
<p>the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum, to a relative of his.
</p>
<p>I immediately wrote to President George S. Romney of the Northern
</p>
<p>States Mission, suggesting to him that he look into the matter and
</p>
<p>secure a copy of this letter. In a few weeks I received a note from
</p>
<p>Pres. Romney as follows:
</p>
<p>"Brother Lundwall: This letter from Samuel Ottis Williams to
</p>
<p>Mr. Prickett is the only one I can find that in any way resembles the
</p>
<p>one you wrote to me about. Do you think it could be the one? I ap-
</p>
<p>preciate your letter very much. Many thanks.
</p>
<p>Signed: Geo. S. Romney."
</p>
<p>This letter follows verbatim:
</p>
<p>My dear John: Carthage, July 10, 1844.
</p>
<p>I have just this moment received your letter of the first and
</p>
<p>hasten to answer it. I proceed to give you a history of our diffi-
</p>
<p>culties with the Saints. About a month ago a paper was started
</p>
<p>in Nauvoo called the Nauvoo Expositor owned by several of the
</p>
<p>seceding saints which had for its purpose the exposure of the
</p>
<p>Smiths and all villainy practiced by them and in the City under

</p>
<p>their direction.
</p>
<p>The first number of the paper was issued and the way it let
</p>
<p>out on Jo was a sin. Jo called the City Council together and after
</p>
<p>much deliberation and talk the new paper was declared a nuisance,
</p>
<p>and they passed an ordinance requiring the marshal of the city to
</p>
<p>destroy the press and pi the type and if any resistance was offered
</p>
<p>to destroy the house. The Mayor of the City (Jo) accordingly
</p>
<p>issued his writ to the Marshal commanding him to do the work
</p>
<p>which he did. He with his posse (the marshal) threw the press
</p>
<p>into the street and broke it up with a sledge hammer and burned
</p>
<p>the type. The Mormons also tried to catch the owners of the Press
</p>
<p>but they escaped. Several of them came here.
</p>
<p>Complaint was made here before a Justice of the Peace, who
</p>
<p>issued his warrant and sent a constable to bring them. (Jo and all
</p>
<p>the others concerned, about 20 in number.) The Municipal Court
</p>
<p>of the City of Nauvoo discharged the balance on writs of Habeas
</p>
<p>Corpus. These potent words were entered on the record. "Hon-
</p>
<p>orably discharged. W." As soon as we heard of the press being
</p>
<p>216 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>destroyed a meeting of the old citizens was called and was in ses-
</p>
<p>sion at the time the officer returned from Nauvoo without the
</p>
<p>prisoners. Of course, such an excitement I never did see in my life.
</p>
<p>There were about seven hundred of the old citizens assembled
</p>
<p>here and I tell you that we all felt that the time had come when
</p>
<p>either the Mormons or old citizens had to leave. The meeting de-
</p>
<p>termined to call for volunteers to rendezvous at four places in this
</p>
<p>county and when a sufficient number had assembled the constable
</p>
<p>that arrested Smith and the others was to call on us as a posse
</p>
<p>comitatus to help him arrest the accused. Our Brigadier General
</p>
<p>in the meantime called out the forces under his command. The
</p>
<p>meeting also appointed two persons to go to the Governor and get
</p>
<p>him to issue a call for the Militia.
</p>
<p>They repaired to Springfield and returned with his Excel-
</p>
<p>lency  when the Gov. arrived here he found about 300 men armed
</p>
<p>and drilling four hours each day and standing guard at night. Our
</p>
<p>Company the Carthage Greys as soon as the meeting came to the
</p>
<p>conclusion it did, pitched our tents on the public square and went
</p>
<p>to work. The Gov. after his arrival made a speech to the troops
</p>
<p>and announced his determination to see the laws executed and im-
</p>
<p>mediately dispatched a messenger to Nauvoo to Smith telling him
</p>
<p>the consequences if he did not immediately surrender himself for
</p>
<p>trial, this was on Friday.
</p>
<p>On Sunday a whole regiment marched into town from Mc-
</p>
<p>Donough County and on the next Tuesday a Battalion from Schuy-
</p>
<p>ler County which made the forces here amount to about 1400 men.
</p>
<p>As the different forces marched into town they pledged themselves
</p>
<p>that no violence should be offered to the prisoners if they did come
</p>
<p>to Carthage.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday the Gov. sent Capt. Dunn of the Union Dragoons
</p>
<p>of this county to Nauvoo with an order for the state arms with
</p>
<p>wagons and horses to bring them here. On the road between this
</p>
<p>place and Nauvoo they met Smith and the others accused coming

</p>
<p>to this place to give themselves up for trial. They returned to
</p>
<p>Nauvoo with Capt. Dunn and about two-thirds of the State Arms
</p>
<p>delivered to Capt. Dunn and the two Smiths, Jo and Hyrum came
</p>
<p>out here with Capt. Dunn with the arms.
</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning the McDonough troops requested the
</p>
<p>Gov. to bring Smith, (Jo) along their lines, many of whom had
</p>
<p>never seen him. The two Smiths were after breakfast brought to
</p>
<p>the Headquarters of the Brigadier General and our company sta-
</p>
<p>tioned at the door as a guard  your humble Servant had com-
</p>
<p>mand of the Greys at this time. I brought the company up to the
</p>
<p>house and formed a square of three sides in front of the house with
</p>
<p>their muskets set at "Charge" and even then had some difficulty
</p>
<p>in keeping the crowd back so great was the anxiety to see the
</p>
<p>Smiths. We stood in this position about half an hour when I re-
</p>
<p>ceived orders from the Brig. Gen. to form the Grey's into a Hollow
</p>
<p>square and guard the Smiths and the Gov. and the Gen. to the right
</p>
<p>of the 57th Regt., which formed about 300 yards from the Gen-
</p>
<p>eral's quarters, which was accordingly done, and when we arrived
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 217
</p>
<p>there I opened the square and let them out and marched the Greys
</p>
<p>back to their "quarters."
</p>
<p>I was about to dismiss the company when the Smiths in
</p>
<p>company with the Brig. Gen. came past our quarters. The company
</p>
<p>in line at "order arms" when the Greys commenced hissing, groan-
</p>
<p>ing, and making all sorts of hellish sounds. I tried to stop it but
</p>
<p>could not. I was about to dismiss the company again when several
</p>
<p>of them requested me to march out and drill awhile. I accordingly
</p>
<p>marched out and started down a street on which the Tavern stands
</p>
<p>that Jo was stopping at. On the way we passed the Brig. Gen. and
</p>
<p>the Greys viped him the worst kind and arrived in a few minutes
</p>
<p>afterwards in front of the Tavern where Jo was when the same
</p>
<p>scene was enacted. Hissing, groaning, and all kinds of discordant
</p>
<p>sounds. I all the time tried my utmost to preserve silence, but had
</p>
<p>no more command than I would have had over a pack of wild In-
</p>
<p>dians. At this demonstration of feeling on the part of the Greys,
</p>
<p>Jo actually fainted.
</p>
<p>I will now tell you the reason of all the hissing and etc. The
</p>
<p>Greys thought we were ordered to escort Smith and that it was in-
</p>
<p>tended as an honor to be conferred on him, and the General always
</p>
<p>has been what we call a Jack Mormon. I believe I have told you
</p>
<p>what that is and therefore won't stop to explain now  A few days
</p>
<p>before at our Anti-Mormon meeting he attempted to make a speech
</p>
<p>and was hissed down.
</p>
<p>Well to resume where we arrived at our quarters. I was in-
</p>
<p>formed that our company was ordered under "Arrest." A member
</p>
<p>of the company immediately mounted a wagon and made a speech
</p>
<p>to the troops and the remainder loaded their muskets with Ball
</p>
<p>Cartridges and swore that they would die sooner than give up
</p>
<p>their arms. A considerable number of the troops, say one half
</p>
<p>swore that the arms of the Greys should not be taken from them.
</p>
<p>If you had been here to see the excitement at this time you would
</p>
<p>have been astonished. I never saw anything to equal it. The Brig.

</p>
<p>Gen. had insulted the McDonough troops by introducing the Smiths
</p>
<p>in this way: "Gentlemen officers of the 57th Regt., I introduce to
</p>
<p>you Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Generals of the Nauvoo Legion."
</p>
<p>They at the same time, prisoners.
</p>
<p>At this stage of the proceedings the- Gov. came on the ground
</p>
<p>and stated that no honor was intended to be conferred on the
</p>
<p>Smiths : that it was done at the request of the 57th Regt., that they
</p>
<p>might see him. That he disapproved of the way of introducing
</p>
<p>the prisoners and rescinded the order of arrest. At this time the
</p>
<p>shout of the multitude ascended to the heavens. We cheered the Gov.
</p>
<p>for about two minutes and we made some noise. This settled all
</p>
<p>things for the present.
</p>
<p>The same day an order was issued to all the troops to march
</p>
<p>on Friday into Nauvoo. The whole rendezvous on Thursday night
</p>
<p>at Golden Point about five miles below Nauvoo and the former or-
</p>
<p>der of march was revoked. The Gov. thinking that if, we once got
</p>
<p>into Nauvoo that he could not restrain the troops and that we would
</p>
<p>burn the place. On Friday morning all the troops except the

</p>
<p>Union Dragoons  Carthage Greys and the Carthage Riflemen (the
</p>
<p>last a Militia Company) were disbanded and left for home. Jo
</p>
<p>and Hyrum all this time in jail. I forgot to say that 15 of these
</p>
<p>concerned in destroying the press came forward and gave bail for
</p>
<p>their appearance at the next term of the Circuit Court without an
</p>
<p>examination and immediately afterward Jo and Hyrum were ar-
</p>
<p>rested on a charge of Treason and the examination was postponed
</p>
<p>until Saturday the 29th which time they were destined never to see.
</p>
<p>On Friday about 10 o'clock a.m. the Gov. under the escort of
</p>
<p>the Union Dragoons started for Nauvoo to address the people there.
</p>
<p>Leaving our company and the Militia Company to protect the pris-
</p>
<p>oners. They being under a pledge to do so. All was quiet at this
</p>
<p>time. A guard of six men was placed at the jail with a sergeant to
</p>
<p>command it which was relieved about every three hours. When the
</p>
<p>Gov. had been gone about 2 hours he sent back a messenger to Capt.
</p>
<p>Smith stating that he was afraid some violence would be offered
</p>
<p>to the prisoners and that he expected him to do his duty. The same
</p>
<p>messenger was sent back to the Gov. that we would.
</p>
<p>5 o'clock p.m. our look-out of the courthouse cried out, "there's
</p>
<p>about 400 Mormons coming down the fence to the jail." I cannot
</p>
<p>explain to you the situation of the jail and our encampment on
</p>
<p>paper. But when I see you (which I hope will be soon) I will show
</p>
<p>you. As soon as the alarm was given our company and the Militia
</p>
<p>Company was immediately formed and started for the jail which
</p>
<p>was about 700 yards from our quarters. At the time the alarm
</p>
<p>was given the mob were within about 200 yards of the jail. We
</p>
<p>marched double quick time and when we got to the jail both the
</p>
<p>Smiths were killed, and the mob running off. When the mob came
</p>
<p>up in front of the jail our guard challenged them. The mob de-
</p>
<p>manded the prisoners. They were told that if they did not retire
</p>
<p>the guard would fire on them. The mob raised a shout and com-
</p>
<p>menced jumping over the low fence in front of the jail when our
</p>
<p>guard fired on them. The guard were not hurt except some bruises.

</p>
<p>One of the guard who was the sergeant in command lost his sword
</p>
<p>and another his musket. The guard in return captured a musket
</p>
<p>and a rifle. The mob all had their faces blacked.
</p>
<p>When we were marching to the jail about 150 yards from the
</p>
<p>jail, we saw Jo come to the window and turn back and in about a
</p>
<p>second or two afterwards he came to the window and tumbled out.
</p>
<p>He was shot several times and a bayonet run through him after
</p>
<p>he fell. From all the information I can get the mob were about 250
</p>
<p>strong. The forces left to guard the prisoners about 60 to 65 strong.
</p>
<p>A messenger was immediately dispatched to the Gov. who returned
</p>
<p>here about 12 o'clock that night and advised us to evacuate the
</p>
<p>town. After the Smiths were killed all the women and children
</p>
<p>were removed from town and the men were determined to stay and
</p>
<p>protect their property, but when the Gov. came in and stated he
</p>
<p>believed our town would be in ashes before morning we all left and
</p>
<p>deserted the town.
</p>
<p>Stop  there were six men in town at daylight Saturday morn-

</p>
<p>ing. I was not one of them, I left Carthage about half past one
</p>
<p>and traveled all night through mud and water knee deep in some
</p>
<p>places. I arrived at Augusta about 7 o'clock Saturday morning
</p>
<p>having traveled 18 miles and considering the roads, was tolerably
</p>
<p>good walking. The Gov. was badly scared and stopped in this place
</p>
<p>but a few minutes and left for Augusta. Arrived there about day-
</p>
<p>light and left there directly after breakfast for Quincy where he
</p>
<p>now is.
</p>
<p>What will be the result of the death of the Smiths I am en-
</p>
<p>tirely unable to say. The Mormons are very badly scared and I
</p>
<p>don't think they will do anything at present. The citizens of this
</p>
<p>place have nearly all returned. Samuelson Ottis Williams
</p>
<p>P. S. I think I will be in Edwardsville soon, anyhow as soon
</p>
<p>as I can leave. Our company is still under orders and I can't leave
</p>
<p>just yet. My family sent off to Rushville, 50 miles from here as
</p>
<p>soon as they could start after the Smiths were killed and I returned
</p>
<p>here with them yesterday. I suppose your letter has been lying
</p>
<p>here several days. This will account for its not being answered be-
</p>
<p>fore. My family are all well, that is, my wife and boy and gal. I
</p>
<p>rather guess you will think I have inherited some of Old Henry T.
</p>
<p>Lusks principles in writing this letter, but I could not well make
</p>
<p>it shorter and besides I want to make you repent of taking such an
</p>
<p>unwarrantable privilege as to intrude upon the attention of

<p>WITNESSED THE PROPHET'S MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>By President E. H. Nye
</p>
<p>"I and my companion spent an evening recently with a gentle-
</p>
<p>man who witnessed the killing of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He
</p>
<p>was then employed as a stage driver between Nauvoo and Keokuk,
</p>
<p>with Carthage as a half-way station, and came rattling into Carth-
</p>
<p>age with the stage. Driving past the old jail, he says, he saw the
</p>
<p>mob on one side and a large number of the regulars on the other.
</p>
<p>He drove past the jail on one side to the hotel, delivered his mail

<p>and passengers. Then, whirling around and passing on the other
</p>
<p>side of the jail to reach his stable, the shooting commenced as
</p>
<p>his passengers were getting out, and as he drove past the jail
</p>
<p>towards his stable, the Prophet Joseph jumped out of the window.
</p>
<p>He saw him fall and saw them set him up against the well. He
</p>
<p>says that as soon as the stableman took charge of the team, he
</p>
<p>jumped off and ran, frightened half out of his wits.
</p>
<p>"This man speaks in the highest terms of commendation and
</p>
<p>praise of the Prophet Joseph and his family. He says that he
</p>
<p>arrived in Nauvoo at night, a stranger, about a year prior to the
</p>
<p>death of Joseph Smith, without money or friends, a boy about
</p>
<p>14 years of age, having understood that his brother lived there.
</p>
<p>On inquiring for his brother, he learned that it was eight miles
</p>
<p>to his home, with snow on the ground and very cold. The gentle-
</p>
<p>220 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>man of whom he inquired, took him over to a large house that
</p>
<p>he thought was a hotel, and told the man of the house the situ-
</p>
<p>ation, who said, "Come in, son; we'll take care of you." He was
</p>
<p>taken in, warmed, fed and lodged. The next day was bitter cold,
</p>
<p>and the man of the house, who he learned was Joseph Smith, told
</p>
<p>him to content himself in peace; it was too cold for him to go
</p>
<p>out to his brother's place alone; some teams would be in from
</p>
<p>there, and then he could go out. The boy said he had no money,
</p>
<p>but he was told not to worry about that; they would take care of
</p>
<p>him. After this incident he became well acquainted with Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, who always called him "sonny," and after the boy ob-
</p>
<p>tained the position of stage driver, Joseph Smith rode with him
</p>
<p>repeatedly.

<p>LETTER WRITTEN BY THOMAS L. BARNES
</p>
<p>(This Dr. Barnes is the identical person who is mentioned by John
</p>
<p>Taylor as the man who took the bullet from his hand, using a car-
</p>
<p>penter^ compass and a dull pen knife. This letter* was written
</p>
<p>to Miranda Barnes Haskett, his eldest daughter, from Ukiah City,
</p>
<p>Mendocino County, California.)
</p>
<p>Well, Miranda, I suppose you would like me to tell you some-
</p>
<p>thing about the killing of the Smiths and what led to it. Some
</p>
<p>person made complaint under oath before a Justice of the Peace
</p>
<p>charging Jo Smith with some grave offence. I do not now re-
</p>
<p>member what the offence was. A warrant was issued by the
</p>
<p>Justice of the Peace, and given to a Constable to serve. I met
</p>
<p>the Constable on his way to Nauvoo to serve the writ; I told
</p>
<p>(him) I would go with him, which I did. He served the writ on
</p>
<p>the accused without any trouble. As was usual in such cases,
</p>
<p>where a grave charge is made against a prominent person, almost
</p>
<p>every person in the vicinity would soon know it.

</p>
<p>The City authorities was granted by their charter as they
</p>
<p>supposed unlimited authority. They issued a writ of habious
</p>
<p>corpus. (I believe that is what they called the writ.) and took
</p>
<p>the accused out of the Constable's hands and set him at liberty.
</p>
<p>While this proceeding was going on, in conversation with Mr.
</p>
<p>Smith, he said to me he was not guilty of that nor any other
</p>
<p>crime. Said he, let them charge me with any crime, I do not care
</p>
<p>what it is, I can prove that I was not there and did not do it. (I
</p>
<p>said to him if they will fix the time and place.) He answered as a
</p>
<p>matter of course or words to that effect.
</p>
<p>Well the Constable returned to Carthage and made his return
</p>
<p>of his warrent. That fact that the Municipal authorities of Nau-
</p>
<p>voo had set the authorities of the state at defiance and taken a
</p>
<p>man charged with crime out of the hands of an officer of the law,
</p>
<p>caused great excitement all over that part of the state. Public
</p>
<p>Spelling exactly as in original letter.
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 221
</p>
<p>meetings were held, inflamitory speeches were made in more than
</p>
<p>one place in the county. The Governor was petitioned to send the
</p>
<p>milita of the state to inforce obedience to the law. The governor
</p>
<p>sent some two or three companies of the state troops into the
</p>
<p>county. A part of the malitia rendisvoosed at Carthage and a part
</p>
<p>at Warsaw. It was arrainged that on a certain day they were to
</p>
<p>march to Nauvoo. They all professed to be ready and anxious to
</p>
<p>fight, if needs be kill, and drive the Mormons out of the county.
</p>
<p>In the meantim Smith had surendered himsef to the officers of
</p>
<p>the law. The Governor disbanded the soldiers that was at Carth-
</p>
<p>age, and sent word to them at Warsaw who was then on the march
</p>
<p>for Nauvoo. When they got the disbanding order many of them
</p>
<p>wer indignant at the Governor, resigned their offices and formed
</p>
<p>themselves into a mob determed to have satisfaction of the Smiths
</p>
<p>any way whether by authority of law or by violence. The men
</p>
<p>that was willing to set all laws aside and have the life of the
</p>
<p>Smiths at any formed a new company and started to
</p>
<p>Carthage where the Smiths Jo and Hyrum John Taylor the editor
</p>
<p>of the Mormon paper, and Willard Richards privet secretary to
</p>
<p>Jo Smith were. Joseph Smith was presumably in the hands of
</p>
<p>the Constable and the others his friends were with him to in
</p>
<p>charge of an officer.
</p>
<p>The under sheriff and jailer lived in the jail. The jail was a
</p>
<p>two story stone house. The lower story and part of the upper
</p>
<p>story was occupied by the jailor and his family. The jail proper
</p>
<p>was in the north end of the building up stairs, divided off into
</p>
<p>cells. The front room up stairs was a kind of a family room. At
</p>
<p>the head of the stairs there was two doors, one entering into the
</p>
<p>family room and the other entering into the jail proper.
</p>
<p>I have tried to be a little particular in discribing the house
</p>
<p>so as to give you an idea of the way the mob got to their victims.
</p>
<p>I said this new company or mob as they realy were had some
</p>
<p>understanding of some of the citizens of our town. I want you

<p>to know and believe, my daughter, that I had nothing (to) do
</p>
<p>with the murder of the Smiths, or any other person and during
</p>
<p>all the excitement I never did any thing to any one that I would
</p>
<p>not under like circumstances they should do to me.
</p>
<p>I said I thought some of our citizens  citizens of Carthage
</p>
<p>I mean  was privy to the hole matter. One of them, a prominent
</p>
<p>man and a man of influence, came to me just befor the cowardly
</p>
<p>murder was committed and asked me to go out on the road to-
</p>
<p>ward Nauvoo and see what was going on out that way. I went
</p>
<p>and John Wilson an old citizen and Doctor Morrison a prominent
</p>
<p>Physician went with me. We went about three miles from Carth-
</p>
<p>age, on the Nauvoo road, where we had a fine view of the country
</p>
<p>all around, the country being pararie all around, we could see very
</p>
<p>plain where the Carthage and Warsaw road was. We saw going
</p>
<p>on that road quite a company going hurriedly in the direction (of)
</p>
<p>Carthage. It was not long till we could see quite a number on
</p>
<p>the same road going toward Warsaw. We then went back to
</p>
<p>Carthage to report and what did we find. Such a sight as I hope
</p>
<p>never to see again.
</p>
<p>222 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>When we saw that company going to and from Carthage my
</p>
<p>suspicions was arroused that all was not right. Afterwards my
</p>
<p>suspicions was strengthened from the fact that a guard of the
</p>
<p>"Carthage Greys" a part of a Millitary company had been left
</p>
<p>in charge of the accused to protect and kepe them safe, whose
</p>
<p>sworn duty it was to protect their prisoner as well as it was to keep
</p>
<p>him from running off. They were there I don't know just how
</p>
<p>many. I think from six to ten men on guard when the mob came
</p>
<p>rushing on them, they fired blank cartridges over the heads of
</p>
<p>the mob as I afterwards learned from some one of the guard. My
</p>
<p>impresion is that they were equal guilty as any one of the mob.
</p>
<p>Excuse me for calling the murders of the Smith a mob. I think
</p>
<p>that is the right name to call them, though I believe I do not know
</p>
<p>if that you had an uncle in the affair. Well after the brave guards
</p>
<p>had fired their blank carheridge on the mob as I was taken prison-
</p>
<p>ers, the mob rushed up stairs to where the Smiths Taylor and
</p>
<p>Richards were enjoying themselves. Some said they were sip-
</p>
<p>ping their wine whether that is true or not I do not know. At any
</p>
<p>rate they were comfortably situated, and they had a right to sup-
</p>
<p>pose safely protected by the laws of the great state of Illinois.
</p>
<p>When the false guard had made their hypocritical assault
</p>
<p>on the other part of the mob (I look upon them as being equally
</p>
<p>guilty as those that came from Warsaw.) They the attacking
</p>
<p>party rushed up stairs with murder in their hearts to where the
</p>
<p>accused were tryed to break open the door which it appears was
</p>
<p>held shut by all four of the men when the mob commenced firing
</p>
<p>their loaded arms through the door. It appears that one of the
</p>
<p>balls in the commencement of the attac pased through a panel
</p>
<p>of the door and hit Hyrum in his neck which probably broke his
</p>
<p>neck he fell back and died, as I was informed instantly. When I
</p>
<p>went into the room shortly afterwards his head was laying against
</p>
<p>the wall on the other sid from the door.
</p>
<p>It is supposed when Hyrum fell the door was partially opened

<p>by the attacking party, so much so at any rate that I was in-
</p>
<p>formed that Jo Smith had what was common then what was and
</p>
<p>probable is now called one of Steves peper boxes. It is said and
</p>
<p>there is no dout but what it is true that he sliped his hand through
</p>
<p>the opening of the door and hit a young man from Warsaw about
</p>
<p>his neck or sholder which made it conveinent for the young man
</p>
<p>to remain for a while in Missouri. The attacing party forced the
</p>
<p>door open and commenced firing at Smith it is said they must
</p>
<p>have hit him an probably disabled him, as he stagered across the
</p>
<p>floor to the oposite side of the room where there was a window.
</p>
<p>It is said that there he gave the hailing sign of the distress of a
</p>
<p>Mason but that did him no good. In the room behind him was
</p>
<p>armed men, furious men, with murder in their hearts. Before
</p>
<p>him arround the well under the window there was a croud of des-
</p>
<p>perate men, as he was receiving shots from behind which he could
</p>
<p>not stand, in despersation he leaped or rather fell out of the win-
</p>
<p>dow near the well where he breathed his last. When I found him
</p>
<p>soon afterwards he was laying in the hall at the foot of the stairs
</p>
<p>where his blood had as I believe left indelible stain on the floor.
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM 223
</p>
<p>I suppose by this time you are anxious to know what became
</p>
<p>of Taylor and Richards; was they also killed, no they were not.
</p>
<p>Taylor was severely wounded Richards was not hurt. Shall I try
</p>
<p>to describe the wounds that Taylor received and got over them.
</p>
<p>Well let me tell you where we found him, I cannot impress your
</p>
<p>mind of his appearance as he appered to us when we wer called
</p>
<p>to him by the jailor. We found him in a pile of straw. It appeared
</p>
<p>that a straw bed had been emtied in the cell where he was when
</p>
<p>we found him. He was very much frightened as well as severly
</p>
<p>wounded. It took strong persuading of the jailor as well as our
</p>
<p>positive assuriance that we ment him no harm but Was desirous
</p>
<p>of doing him some good. He finally consented to come out of his
</p>
<p>cell. When we examined him we found that he had been hit by
</p>
<p>four balls. One ball had hit him in his fore arm and pased down
</p>
<p>and lodged in the hand betwen the phalanges of his third and
</p>
<p>fourth fingers. Another hit on the left side of the pelvis cuttin
</p>
<p>through the skin and pasin leaving a superficial wound
</p>
<p>that you could lay your hand in. A third ball passed through his
</p>
<p>thigh lodging in his notus. A fourth ball hit his watch which he
</p>
<p>had in the fob in his pantaloons, which I suppose the Mormons
</p>
<p>have today, to show the precise time that their great leader was
</p>
<p>killed. The wounds had bled quite freely, the blood had had time
</p>
<p>to coagulate which it had done, and where the clothes and straw
</p>
<p>came in contact they all adhered together so that Mr. Taylor came
</p>
<p>out his self sought cell he was a pitable looking sight. We took
</p>
<p>the best care of him we could till he left us. He got well but never
</p>
<p>paid us for skill or good wishes.
</p>
<p>You want to know what has become of Richards. He was not
</p>
<p>hurt. You will ask how did it happen that his comrads (were)
</p>
<p>so badly treated and he came off without receiving any damage
</p>
<p>whatever. It was in this way, as I suppose I think he told me so.
</p>
<p>The four braced themselves against the door to keep the mob out.
</p>
<p>He stood next to the hinges of the door so when the door opened

</p>
<p>it would turn back against the wall that divided the room that
</p>
<p>they were in from the prison room. So when they crowded the
</p>
<p>door open it shut him up against the wall and he stood there and
</p>
<p>did not move till the affair was all over, so they did not see him.
</p>
<p>After we were through with Taylor I went to Richards and
</p>
<p>said to him Richards what does all this mean who done it. Said
</p>
<p>he, doctor I do not know, but I belive it was some Missourians
</p>
<p>that came over and have killed brothers Josef and Hyrum and
</p>
<p>wounded bro Taylor. Said I to him do you believe that, he said
</p>
<p>I do. Says I, will you write that down and send it to Nauvoo. He
</p>
<p>said he would if he could get any person to take it. I told him if
</p>
<p>he would write it I would send it. He wrote the note, I found the
</p>
<p>man that took it to Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>Shall I tell you any more.

<p>That graced thy surface, degraded earth!
</p>
<p>Oh, wretched murderers, fierce for human blood!
</p>
<p>You've slain the Prophets of the living God,
</p>
<p>Who've borne oppression from their early youth,
</p>
<p>To plant on earth the principles of truth
</p>
<p>Shades of our patriot fathers! can it be,
</p>
<p>Beneath your blood-stained flag of Liberty,
</p>
<p>The firm supporters of our country's cause,
</p>
<p>Are butcher'd while submission to her laws?
</p>
<p>Yes, blameless men, defamed by hellish lie,
</p>
<p>Have thus been offer'd as a sacrifice
</p>
<p>To appease the ragings of a brutish clan
</p>
<p>That has defiled the laws of God and man!

<p>'Twas not for crime or guilt of theirs they fell:

<p>Against the laws they never did rebel.

<p>True to their country, yet her plighted faith

<p>Oh, persecution! shall thy purple hand

<p>Spread utter desolation through the land?
</p>
<p>Shall Freedom's banner be no more unfurled?
</p>
<p>Has peace indeed been taken from the world?

<p>Help us to trust in thy Almighty power

<p>Make bare thine arm to break oppressions' yoke.

<p>A depth of thought no human art could reach,
</p>
<p>From time to time roll'd in sublimest speech,

<p>From thy celestial fountain, through his mind,
</p>
<p>To purify and elevate mankind;
</p>
<p>The rich intelligence by him brought forth
</p>
<p>Is like the sunbeams spreading o'er the earth.
</p>
<p>Now Zion mourns  she mourns an earthly head;
</p>
<p>Her Prophet and her Patriarch are dead!
</p>
<p>The blackest deed that men and devils know

<p>One while in life, and one in death, they prov'd

<p>How strong their friendship  how true they loved;

<p>True to their mission until death they stood,

<p>Is bath'd in tears, each bosom heaves a sigh,

<p>Heart-broken widows' agonizing groans

<p>CHAPTER 10
</p>
<p>The Prophet's Body Not Permitted
</p>
<p>to be Mutilated
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM M. DANIELS
</p>
<p>He (Joseph the Prophet) seemed to fall easy. He struck
</p>
<p>partly on his right shoulder and back, his neck and head reaching
</p>
<p>the ground a little before his feet. He rolled instantly on his face.
</p>
<p>From this position he was taken by a young man, who sprang to
</p>
<p>him from the other side of the fence, who held a pewter fife in his
</p>
<p>hand, was barefoot and bare-headed, having on no coat, with his
</p>
<p>pants rolled above his knees and shirt-sleeves above his elbows.
</p>
<p>He set President Smith against the south side of the well-curb,
</p>
<p>that was situated a few feet from the jail. While doing this, the
</p>
<p>savage muttered aloud : "This is Old Jo ; I know him. I know you,
</p>
<p>Old Jo. Damn you, you are the man that had my daddy shot." ****
</p>
<p>When President Smith had been set against the curb, and
</p>
<p>began to recover from the effects of the fall, Col. Williams ordered
</p>
<p>four men to shoot him. Accordingly, four men took an eastern
</p>
<p>direction, about eight feet from the curb, Col. Williams standing
</p>
<p>partly at their rear, and made ready to execute the order. While
</p>
<p>they were making preparations, and the muskets were raised to
</p>
<p>their faces, President Smith's eyes rested upon them with a calm
</p>
<p>and quiet resignation. He betrayed no agitated feelings and the
</p>
<p>expression upon his countenance seemed to betoken his only prayer
</p>
<p>to be : "O, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
</p>
<p>The fire was simultaneous. A slight cringe of the body was
</p>
<p>all the indication of pain that he betrayed when the balls struck
</p>
<p>him. He fell upon his face. One ball had entered the back part of
</p>
<p>his body. This is the ball that many people have supposed struck
</p>
<p>him about the time he was in the window. But this is a mistake.
</p>
<p>I was close by him, and I know he was not hit with a ball until
</p>
<p>after he was seated by the well-curb.****
</p>
<p>The ruffian, of whom I have spoken, who set him against the
</p>
<p>well-curb, now secured a bowie knife for the purpose of severing

</p>
<p>his head from his body. He raised the knife and was in the atti-
</p>
<p>tude of striking, when a light, so sudden and powerful, burst from
</p>
<p>the heavens upon the bloody scene, (passing its vivid chain between
</p>
<p>Joseph and his murderers.) that they were struck with terrified
</p>
<p>awe and filled with consternation. This light, in its appearance and
</p>
<p>potency, baffles all powers of description. The arm of the ruffian,
</p>
<p>that held the knife, fell powerless; the muskets of the four, who
</p>
<p>fired, fell to the ground, and they all stood like marble statues, not
</p>
<p>having power to move a single limb of their bodies.
</p>
<p>By this time most of the men had fled in great disorder. I
</p>
<p>never saw so frightened a set of men before. Col. Williams saw the
</p>
<p>JOSEPH'S BODY NOT PERMITTED TO BE MUTILATED 227
</p>
<p>light and was also badly frightened; but he did not entirely lose
</p>
<p>the use of his limbs or speech. Seeing the condition of these men
</p>
<p>he hallowed to some who had just commenced to retreat, for God's
</p>
<p>sake to come and carry off these men. They came back and carried
</p>
<p>them by main strength towards the baggage wagons. They seemed
</p>
<p>as helpless as if they were dead. The Martyrs, pp. 79-81.

<p>STATEMENT OF MRS. ELIZA MORGAN
</p>
<p>My father Jacob Hofheins was born on December 4, 1812, in
</p>
<p>Baden, Germany. He emigrated to America in 1830 and joined
</p>
<p>the Mormon Church in 1835. He was a bodyguard of the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith in the days of Nauvoo, and was present at the martyr-
</p>
<p>dom of the Prophet at Carthage, Illinois. / have heard him speak
</p>
<p>many times of the cruelty of the mobbers and have heard him state
</p>
<p>many times of the light that struck the fiend who raised his arm to
</p>
<p>cut off the head of the Prophet, the fiend's hand tvas paralyzed and
</p>
<p>fell to his side. He saw the Prophet as he fell or leaped from the
</p>
<p>window of the Carthage jail and saw the mob set him against the
</p>
<p>well. My father stated emphatically and positively that he saw
</p>
<p>this. In 1846 he joined the Mormon Battalion. He witnessed the
</p>
<p>great mourning by the entire people, men, women and children,
</p>
<p>in Nauvoo, at the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith and Hyrum
</p>
<p>Smith his brother.
</p>
<p>To all of the above statements, I solemnly testify I heard my
</p>
<p>father relate to me.

<p>HISTORY BY GEORGE Q. CANNON
</p>
<p>Among the murderers outside was a man, barefoot and bare-

<p>against the south side of the well curb which stood a few feet from
</p>
<p>the jail. Colonel Levi Williams then ordered four men to shoot
</p>
<p>him. They stood about eight feet from the curb, and fired simul-
</p>
<p>taneously. A slight cringe of the body was noticed as the balls struck
</p>
<p>him, and he fell on his face. The ruffian who set him against the
</p>
<p>well-curb, then took a boivie-knife, with the evident intention of
</p>
<p>cutting off his head. It tvas reported that a considerable sum of
</p>
<p>money had been offered, by the mob, for his head. As he raised the
</p>
<p>knife, and was in the attitude of striking, a light, so sudden and
</p>
<p>powerful, burst from the heavens upon the bloody scene, (passing
</p>
<p>its vivid chain between Joseph and his murderers) that they were
</p>
<p>struck with terror. The arm of the ruffian that held the knife, fell
</p>
<p>powerless; the muskets of the four who fired fell to the ground, and
</p>
<p>228 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>they all stood like marble statues, not having the power to move a
</p>
<p>single limb of their bodies.
</p>
<p>As Joseph fell from the window, the cry was raised, "He has
</p>
<p>leaped the ivindow," and the mob on the stairs and in the entry ran
</p>
<p>out as soon as they could. After shooting him, the murderers hur-
</p>
<p>ried off in a disorderly manner as fast as they could. Colonel Wil-
</p>
<p>liams shouted to some who had just commenced their retreat, to
</p>
<p>come back and help to carry off the four men who fired, who were
</p>
<p>still paralyzed. They came and carried them away by main strength
</p>
<p>to the baggage wagons, and they all fled toward Warsaw.

</p>
<p>AN OFFICER OF ILLINOIS MILITIA TESTIFIES
</p>
<p>"Wm. T. Head, an officer in Captain Lawn's company, and
</p>
<p>tarrying in Carthage, testified that he saw a certain man raise a
</p>
<p>large knife to strike off the head of Joseph, when, all at once, and in
</p>
<p>the midst of a clear day, with no cloud in sight, ( a terrible clap of
</p>
<p>thunder rolled heavily, and forked lightning flashed in the face of
</p>
<p>the murderers, and perfectly paralyzed a number of them.'
</p>
<p>"The ruffian, who had raised his knife and had sworn with a
</p>
<p>dreadful oath to take the head off Joseph, stood perfectly paralyzed,
</p>
<p>his arm uplifted with the knife suspended in air, and could not
</p>
<p>move a limb. His comrades carried him off, and all fled in terror
</p>
<p>from the scene." Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, p. 477.

<p>HISTORIAN EDW. W. TULLIDGE'S DECLARATIONS
</p>
<p>From the point where Joseph leaped the window, the record
</p>
<p>continues : "He fell partly on his right shoulder and back, his neck
</p>
<p>and head reaching the ground a little before his feet, and he rolled
</p>
<p>instantly on his face.
</p>
<p>"From this position he ivas taken by a man tuho was barefoot
</p>
<p>and bareheaded, and having on no coat, his pants rolled up above
</p>
<p>his knees, and his shirt sleeves above his elbows. He set Joseph
</p>
<p>against the south side of the well-curb, ivhich was situated a few

<p>shoot him. They stood about eight feet from the curb, and fired
</p>
<p>simultaneously. A slight cringe of the body ivas all the indication
</p>
<p>of pain visible when the balls struck him, and he fell on his face.
</p>
<p>The ruffian ivho set him against the well-curb now gathered a bowie-
</p>
<p>knife for the purpose of severing his head from his body. He
</p>
<p>raised the knife, and was in the attitude of striking when a light,
</p>
<p>so sudden and poiverful, burst from the heavens upon the bloody
</p>
<p>scene {passing its vivid chain between Joseph and his murderers) ,
</p>
<p>that they were struck with terror. This light, in its appearance and
</p>
<p>potency baffles all poivers of description. The arm of the ruffian
</p>
<p>that held the knife fell powerless, the muskets of the four tvho
</p>
<p>fired fell to the ground, and they all stood like marble statues, not
</p>
<p>having the power to move a single limb of their bodies.
</p>
<p>"The retreat of the mob was so hurried and disorderly as it
</p>
<p>possibly could have been. Colonel Williams hallowed to some who
</p>
<p>JOSEPH'S BODY NOT PERMITTED TO BE MUTILATED 229
</p>
<p>had just commenced their retreat to come back and help to carry
</p>
<p>off the four men who fired, and who were still paralyzed. They
</p>
<p>came and carried them away by main strength to the baggage
</p>
<p>wagons, when they fled towards Warsaw."
</p>
<p>Upon the tide of grief that swept over Nauvoo, and the con-
</p>
<p>sternation that filled the hearts of the mob, when the awful deed
</p>
<p>became known, we will not dwell. Neither will we attempt to de-
</p>
<p>pict that scene of woe which occurred when the bodies of the slain
</p>
<p>were delivered into the hands of their families. A whole people
</p>
<p>had been cruelly, fiendishly betrayed and bereaved. Awful, beyond
</p>
<p>the power of words to picture, was the lament.
</p>
<p>Today some of that very mob remain in peace near the scene
</p>
<p>of that atrocious crime, unwhipped of justice, and not one of that
</p>
<p>horde of assassins has ever felt the lash of the law.
</p>
<p>Thus lived, and labored, and loved, and died the martyr
</p>
<p>prophet of the nineteenth century. Thus flashed athwart the black
</p>
<p>midnight of his age the light of the latter-days. But the darkness
</p>
<p>comprehended it not; and even as one of old was he betrayed and
</p>
<p>sacrificed.
</p>
<p>Back to that scene on Calvary leaps the thought of man. In-
</p>
<p>stinctively are associated the tragedy of that day and the tragedy
</p>
<p>of this. Across the ages stride the footsteps of the self -same genius.
</p>
<p>In the agony of death appears the self -same spirit. Nay, from out
</p>
<p>the agony of Calvary and of Carthage comes the self -same voice:
</p>
<p>"Lama Sabacthana !" "Oh, Lord my God!"

<p>has but recently celebrated her 100th birthday  Mrs. Sulvia Whit-
</p>
<p>mar, who lives with her daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Don
</p>

</p>
<p>100 years old, and is still as spry and hearty as are many women

<p>40 years her junior. She does a share of the work about the house
</p>
<p>and assists in caring for the nine children of her daughter, and
</p>
<p>insists that she is not an old woman, as the term is generally under-
</p>

<p>ally and well in the early days of Illinois, and tells many interesting

<p>stories of the early days in the "western" life of that state. She was
</p>
<p>also a personal friend of the great Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith,

<p>to me in detail all she knew in regard to Joseph Smith and his

</p>
<p>Bro. N. B. Lundwall, Jensen, Utah, Dec. 31, 1938
</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, Utah.
</p>
<p>Dear Brother:
</p>
<p>I have been some time getting started to write a few lines
</p>
<p>regarding the testimony given to me by my mother concerning the
</p>
<p>martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum. Grand-
</p>
<p>father Stephen Markham was with the Prophet in Carthage jail.
</p>
<p>Just before the shooting he left the jail to get some medicine for
</p>
<p>Brother Taylor, I believe it was. There were seven of the mob
</p>
<p>went with him. They had gone but a short distance when the
</p>
<p>fatal shots were fired. Grandfather turned his horse to go back
</p>
<p>and the men that were with him guarding him for fear he would
</p>
<p>get away, stuck their bayonets in his legs till the blood filled his
</p>
<p>boots and ran to the ground. He testified that there was a light
</p>
<p>descended from heaven and fell upon the man who made the at-
</p>
<p>tempt to cut off the Prophet's head and that he fell to the ground.
</p>
<p>My mother was Stephen Markham's oldest daughter, Mary
</p>
<p>Lucy Markham.
</p>
<p>I hope this will be of some value to you. Am glad of having
</p>
<p>met you and appreciate your acquaintance.

<p>I was born on January 5, 1878, in Sunset, Arizona, my father's
</p>
<p>name being Charles Allen Foster and my mother Josephine Mor-

<p>ris Foster. My father was well acquainted with the Prophet Jo-
</p>
<p>seph Smith, which acquaintance lasted several years prior to the
</p>
<p>martyrdom of the Prophet. He was present in Nauvoo when the
</p>
<p>Prophet made the statement "I am going as a lamb to the slaugh-
</p>
<p>ter." I have heard father state several times that he was present
</p>
<p>on the ground when the Prophet was murdered and saw the mob
</p>
<p>drag his body from under the Carthage jail window after he was
</p>
<p>shot and saw members of the mob set the body of the Prophet
</p>
<p>against the well. The leader of the mob asked the others "who
</p>
<p>will cut his head of?" to which two of the mob stated, "I will cut
</p>
<p>off his G  d d  head." One of the two raised his sword with the

<p>then fled and left the bodies of the two lying on the ground. To

<p>Note: While at the home of Mrs. Allred, in Spring City, Utah, on
</p>
<p>August 8, 1951, conversing on the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, Mrs. Allred dictated the following statement.
</p>
<p>I was born on February 15, 1865, in Spring City, Utah. I
</p>
<p>was well acquainted with Cyrus Wheelock who lived at Mt. Pleas-
</p>
<p>ant, Utah. I have heard Cyrus Wheelock and Orson Hyde in con-
</p>
<p>versation many times, as they would reminisce on their acquaint-
</p>
<p>ances and association with the Prophet Joseph Smith. I have heard
</p>
<p>Brother Wheelock state many times how he was with the Prophet,
</p>

<p>THE FATAL 27th OF JUNE
</p>
<p>(Excerpts)
</p>
<p>Shortly after five o'clock a noise outside was heard, a cry of
</p>
<p>surrender, a few musket shots and then a tumult. As planned, the

</p>
<p>disbanded militia had organized and with faces blackened with
</p>
<p>powder and mud came up against the jail, two hundred strong.
</p>
<p>The guard feigned resistance by shooting over their heads. They
</p>
<p>stormed the prison, some fired from the yard through the windows,
</p>
<p>and others rushed up the stairs to break into the room. The four
</p>
<p>men threw themselves against the door, but failed to hold it closed.
</p>
<p>Guns were thrust in and discharged. A stream of bullets from
</p>
<p>different directions came pouring into the room.
</p>
<p>Hyrum was the first victim. One ball from the door struck
</p>
<p>him in the face and he lurched back saying, "I am a dead man." An-
</p>
<p>other from the window pierced him as he fell, and two more took
</p>
<p>effect after he reached the floor. John Taylor, unable to hold the
</p>
<p>door, ran across the room. A bullet from the doorway struck him
</p>
<p>232 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>in the thigh, and its force would have driven his falling body
</p>
<p>through the open window, but another ball from outside struck
</p>
<p>his watch and without wounding him cast his body back into the
</p>
<p>room. Three more struck him as he lay helpless on the floor. Wil-
</p>
<p>lard Richards, save a slight wound in the ear, was unhurt.
</p>
<p>Up to this time Joseph had not been struck, but he realized
</p>
<p>he had not long to live. With the same motive that had drawn him
</p>
<p>from Nauvoo, he sprang to the window, willing to die quickly and
</p>
<p>thus save his two living brethren. He did not need to jump to the
</p>
<p>ground, however; two bullets from the door and one from below
</p>
<p>struck him simultaneously. He fell down at the feet of his mur-
</p>
<p>derers with the death cry, "0 Lord, my God !"
</p>
<p>All the assassins rushed from the jail; the body was set up
</p>
<p>against a well curb, and Colonel Levi Williams ordered four men to
</p>
<p>shoot it. A scantily clothed brutal fellow, coveting the money that
</p>
<p>had been offered by the Missourians for the Prophet's head, rushed
</p>
<p>forward with a knife in his hand to gain his trophy. Suddenly a
</p>
<p>shaft of light from heaven fell down and paralyzed the nearest of
</p>
<p>the murderers. The rabble and the soldiers ran away in terror, but
</p>
<p>Williams cried to them for help. Some came back and lifted the help-
</p>
<p>less bodies of their comrades into a wagon. Then the mob together
</p>
<p>with nearly all of the inhabitants of Carthage fled from the cursed
</p>
<p>place.
</p>
<p>For Willard Richards it remained to care for the living and
</p>
<p>the dead. John Taylor, desperately wounded, was hidden by him
</p>
<p>in an inner dungeon, and Willard spent the night in watching over
</p>
<p>the precious remains of the martyrs. Next day he took them to
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, and the mourning Saints met him on the way. Thousands
</p>
<p>viewed the familiar features of the two beloved men and wept as
</p>
<p>they saw them, fallen in the glory of their manhood. Loving hands
</p>
<p>buried the Prophets secretly and at night, that no unhallowed hands
</p>
<p>should disturb the sleeping dust.
</p>
<p>The mob had fulfilled their threat. They could not reach these

<p>middle of the nineteenth century Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Proph-

<p>TESTIMONY OF ORVILLE ALLEN
</p>
<p>(Given on the 22nd day of January, 1952,
</p>
<p>at Thatcher, Arizona.)
</p>
<p>I was born on the 21st day of May, 1881, at Taylor, Arizona,
</p>
<p>my parents being Orville Morgan Allen and Diana J. Allen. I was
</p>
<p>called on a mission to the Central States on the 6th of April, 1905,
</p>
<p>and was sent from the headquarters of the mission at Independence,
</p>
<p>Missouri, to Morgan City, Louisiana, by President S. 0. Bennion
</p>
<p>who was then president of that mission. My companion at the
</p>
<p>time this narrative deals was Elder Church from Salt Lake City.
</p>
<p>We labored under the district presidency of Elder Leavitt, in the
</p>
<p>JOSEPH'S BODY NOT PERMITTED TO BE MUTILATED 233
</p>
<p>vicinity of Morgan City and Swevers Port, La. When traveling
</p>
<p>without purse or script to conference which was held at Kelsey,
</p>
<p>Texas, we met two old men, 82 and 84 years of age, who were broth-
</p>
<p>ers, whose names I wrote in my diary which was later lost. These
</p>
<p>men lived in the Red Hills of Louisiana, between the two localities
</p>
<p>mentioned. Neither of them had married and lived alone in the
</p>
<p>jungles or timbered country.
</p>
<p>They testified that they were present at the time of the martyr-
</p>
<p>dom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and were with their people in
</p>
<p>the mob of from 200 to 250 men. They told us that as they went
</p>
<p>around the jail to see what was going on, they saw the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph against the well-curb after he had been shot, and they
</p>
<p>saw a man take the Prophet by the hair of his head with a drawn
</p>
<p>sword in his other hand. There was a reward of $1,000.00 for
</p>
<p>the Prophet's head. He raised his sword to strike off the head of
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith when a flash of lightning from the heavens was seen,
</p>
<p>the day being bright with no clouds. This so frightened them and
</p>
<p>the rest of the mob who saw it that they all fled for fear. These
</p>
<p>two young men (for they were in the neighborhood of twenty
</p>
<p>years of age) looked back after running a short distance and saw
</p>
<p>the man whose arm was still raised with the sword in his hand.
</p>
<p>They continued to travel as fast as they could, anxious to get away
</p>
<p>from the scene of the murder but the fear remained with them up
</p>
<p>to the time of our visit with them. They settled in the locality
</p>
<p>where we found them and still feared the divine punishment that
</p>
<p>they expected to receive after death, and they asked Elder Church
</p>
<p>what they should do about it to take away that fear. He told them
</p>
<p>that they would have to settle it with their God. They feared to
</p>
<p>die and testified that they had taken part with the mob in killing
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith and were in full accord with the mob in doing so but
</p>
<p>after seeing this flash of lightning fear came upon them which was
</p>
<p>not lessened or removed.
</p>
<p>They had seen Elders passing but had never conversed with

</p>
<p>them and had purposely avoided meeting them. My companion and
</p>
<p>I passed through the woods and happened to come onto their home.
</p>
<p>They knew who we were and seemed relieved at meeting us and
</p>
<p>asked us to return again if we should happen to pass that way but
</p>
<p>we never returned. They seemed to be very humble after talking
</p>
<p>to us. They said they knew the mob had killed a man of God be-
</p>
<p>cause of the fear that always existed in their hearts since the mar-
</p>
<p>tyrdom. The above incident was one of the strongest testimonies I
</p>
<p>received concerning the divinity of the mission of Joseph Smith
</p>
<p>the Prophet, my entire mission being one of many wonderful ex-
</p>
<p>periences in the Southern states, while on this mission.

<p>LETTER OF INSTRUCTION AND INFORMATION
</p>
<p>TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH MISSION
</p>
<p>(Excerpts)
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, Illinois, U. S ,
</p>
<p>July 9th, 1844. "
</p>
<p>Elder Reuben Hedlock, Presiding Elder of the Church of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ in England, and the Saints in the British Empire.
</p>
<p>Beloved brethren, we say to you all, as we say to the saints
</p>
<p>here, be still and know that God reigns. This is one of those fiery
</p>
<p>trials that is to try the saints in the last days. * * *
</p>
<p>These servants of God have gone to heaven by fire  the fire of
</p>
<p>an ungodly mob. Like the Prophets of ancient days they lived as
</p>
<p>long as the world would receive them; and this is one furnace in
</p>
<p>which the saints were to be tried, to have their leaders cut off from
</p>
<p>their midst, and not be permitted to avenge their blood.
</p>
<p>God has said, "Vengeance is mine ; I have not called mine elders
</p>
<p>to fight their battles; I will fight their battle for them;" and we
</p>
<p>know, assuredly, that he will do it in his own due time, and we have
</p>
<p>only to wait in patience and pray for the fulfilment of the promise.
</p>
<p>This event is one of the most foul and damnable that ever
</p>
<p>disgraced the earth, having no parallel in time. Innocent men im-
</p>
<p>prisoned without law, without justice, and murdered in cold blood
</p>
<p>in the enlightened nineteenth century, in an enlightened country
</p>
<p>in open daylight.
</p>
<p>It will call down the wrath and indignation of all nations upon
</p>
<p>the perpetrators of the horrid deed, and will prove the truth of the
</p>
<p>saying, "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church." They
</p>
<p>died for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>God has not left his church without witnesses; as in former
</p>
<p>days, so shall it be in the latter days, when one falls another will
</p>
<p>arise to occupy a similar station. Our heavenly Father always has

<p>had a leader to his people, always will have, and the gates of hell
</p>
<p>can never prevail against the chosen of heaven.
</p>
<p>The murder of Joseph will not stop the work ; it will not stop
</p>
<p>the Temple; it will not stop the gathering; it will not stop the
</p>
<p>honest-in-heart from believing the truth and obeying it; but it is
</p>
<p>a proof of the revelations we have received from heaven through
</p>
<p>him. He has sealed his testimony with his blood. He was willing
</p>
<p>to die, and desired only to live for the sake of the brethren.
</p>
<p>Two better men than Joseph and Hyrum Smith never lived.
</p>

</p>
<p>Two better men God never made. The memorial of their godly
</p>
<p>lives is embalmed, printed with indelible ink in the memory of
</p>
<p>every honest heart who knew their upright walk and conversation ;
</p>
<p>but they are taken away by the hands of assassins, and of the fool-
</p>
<p>ish things of the earth God will raise up others to comfort and lead
</p>
<p>his people, and not one item of his word can fail.
</p>
<p>Jerusalem must be rebuilt and Zion must be redeemed, the
</p>
<p>earth be cleansed from blood by fire, Jesus return to his own, and
</p>
<p>all who shall continue faithful unto the end shall rest in everlasting
</p>
<p>peace and blessedness.
</p>
<p>We alone, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, are here at
</p>
<p>this time to write to you, the remaining ten are in the eastern
</p>
<p>states preaching the gospel, and we expect them soon to return;
</p>
<p>and as soon as God will, we will write you again.
</p>
<p>Proceed onward with all your labors as though nothing had
</p>
<p>happened, only, preach Joseph martyred for his religion, instead of
</p>
<p>living, and God will pour out his Spirit upon you, and hasten his
</p>
<p>work from this time.
</p>
<p>Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits ; believe not every
</p>
<p>report, for every false rumor that men and demons can invent is
</p>
<p>set afloat to gull the world. What we have told you by letter and
</p>
<p>papers is true, but time will not permit to tell you every particular
</p>
<p>now.
</p>
<p>Be humble, prayerful, watchful, and let not the adversary get
</p>
<p>any advantage of one of you, and may the choicest blessings of
</p>
<p>Israel's God rest upon you and abide with you, that you may en-
</p>
<p>dure faithful in all tribulation and affliction, and be prepared to
</p>
<p>be gathered unto Mount Zion, and enter into celestial glory, is the
</p>
<p>earnest prayer of your brethren in the new and everlasting cove-
</p>
<p>nant. Amen. [Signed] Willard Richards,

<p>By Ben E. Rich
</p>
<p>Sixty-two years ago, on the 27th of June, just passed, the
</p>
<p>Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum the Patriarch, were mar-
</p>
<p>tyred at Carthage, 111. Both of these valiant men had received the
</p>
<p>revelations of God; both had believed and obeyed His word; both
</p>
<p>were advocates of the Father and ministers of His divine truth;
</p>
<p>both declared no doctrine save that which a Christian nation pro-
</p>
<p>fessed already to believe, and which that sacred volume, the Word
</p>
<p>of God, so clearly defines ; both were peaceable, law-abiding men 
</p>
<p>men of honesty  men of honor  men of integrity  men of God!
</p>
<p>Both were hated, despised, and abused, not because they were
</p>
<p>violators of law, but purely because they came in the name of the
</p>
<p>Lord, filled with His Spirit which discerns the wickedness in the
</p>
<p>hearts of men and rebukes them for their transgression  because
</p>
<p>they came with the authority from God to establish His Church in
</p>
<p>the earth  that Church which Satan has always opposed and so
</p>
<p>236 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>vigorously fought whenever it has been upon the earth ; both were
</p>
<p>in a Christian land; both were citizens of the United States; and
</p>
<p>yet notwithstanding all this, both were murdered in cold blood at
</p>
<p>the hands of professed followers of Christ who trampled the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the United States under their feet in order that the
</p>
<p>insatiable cravings of their depraved hearts for the blood of inno-
</p>
<p>cent men might be gratified.
</p>
<p>But that even has passed now and is buried beneath the weight
</p>
<p>of sixty-two years ; and in recalling it at the present time we do so,
</p>
<p>not because of any spirit of revenge harbored within our breasts,
</p>
<p>for vengeance belongs to the Lord and He will repay, but because
</p>
<p>the memories of these divinely inspired men are dear to the hearts
</p>
<p>of every Latter-day Saint, and because their pains of intense suffer-
</p>
<p>ing unjustly and cruelly inflicted upon their bodies because of their
</p>
<p>love for the truth, are forced upon our minds when the anniversary
</p>
<p>of the day on which they gave their lives for the cause of righteous-
</p>
<p>ness comes and goes. * * *
</p>
<p>He stands at the head of this dispensation, and some day when
</p>
<p>the veil of darkness is lifted from the eyes of the world and they
</p>
<p>are able to see and comprehend the things of God in their true
</p>
<p>relationship they will then know that June the 27th, 1844, marks
</p>
<p>the day of the martyrdom of two of God's holy prophets, Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, who opened up the greatest of all dispensations on the
</p>
<p>earth since the world began, and Hyrum the Patriarch, his devoted
</p>
<p>and self-sacrificing brother. Elders Journal, July 1, 1906.

<p>but leave it with the executive, who had pledged the faith of the
</p>
<p>state for their safe-keeping. The elders cannot be too careful in
</p>
<p>all the world, to keep from saying anything to irritate and vex the
</p>
<p>governor, etc., for at present we must conciliate : it is for our sal-
</p>
<p>vation. The governor has appeared to act with honest intentions;
</p>
<p>we bring no charge against him  will wait patiently his proceed-
</p>
<p>ings in the matter. Let the elders keep cool, vengeance rests in
</p>
<p>heaven.  Yours as ever, Willard Richards.

<p>JOSEPH HAD SUFFERED ENOUGH
</p>
<p>By Brigham Young
</p>
<p>He (Brigham Young) then referred to the Missourians when
</p>
<p>Joseph and others went to jail, snapping their guns at the brethren
</p>
<p>but they would not go off. The Lord never let a prophet fall on the

<p>earth until he had accomplished his work; and the Lord did not
</p>
<p>take Joseph until he had finished his work, and it is the greatest
</p>
<p>blessing to Joseph and Hyrum God could bestow to take them
</p>
<p>away, for they had suffered enough. They are not the only martyrs
</p>
<p>that will have to die for the truth. There are men before me today
</p>
<p>who will be martyrs and who will have to seal their testimony with
</p>
<p>their blood. D. H. C. 7:302.
</p>
<p>STORY OF THE MARTYRDOM AS GIVEN BY
</p>
<p>TWO MODERN PRIESTS OF BAAL
</p>
<p>We, by accident, the other day, stumbled on a number of the
</p>
<p>Jonesborough Whig, dated July 24, 1844. The editor, the Rev.
</p>
<p>William G. Brownlow, is of the true stripe on Mormonism, as the
</p>
<p>following from his pen will demonstrate :
</p>
<p>Death of Joe Smith  Some of the public Journals of the coun-
</p>
<p>try, we are sorry to see, regret the death of Joe Smith, the Mormon
</p>
<p>Prophet. Our deliberate judgment is, that he ought to have been
</p>
<p>dead ten years ago, and that those who at length have deprived
</p>
<p>him of his life, have done the cause of God, and of the country,
</p>
<p>good service.
</p>
<p>What lead to his death? This question answered properly,
</p>
<p>and no one will be found to regret his death. By order of Smith and
</p>
<p>his villainous Council a newspaper press was destroyed on the 10th
</p>
<p>ultimo, for the reason too, that it did not advocate Mormonism.
</p>
<p>This was followed by a declaration of Martial Law, and the adop-
</p>
<p>tion of other arbitrary measures to the injury and annoyance of
</p>
<p>other peaceable citizens. These things led to war, and Smith was
</p>
<p>killed, as he should have been. THREE CHEERS to the brave com-
</p>
<p>pany who shot him to pieces !

<p>Smith and his brother Hiram have been providentially cut off in
</p>
<p>the midst of their diabolical career. They were most lawlessly and
</p>
<p>mobocratically put to death. But the money-digger, the juggler,
</p>
<p>and the founder of the Golden Bible delusion, has been hurried
</p>
<p>away in the midst of his madness to his final account. "He died not
</p>
<p>as a righteous man dieth." The hand of the Lord was heavy upon
</p>
<p>him. An outlaw himself, God cut him off by outlaws. He requited
</p>
<p>him according to his works. He was not persecuted, unless to
</p>
<p>punish a traitor, a public plunderer, a marauder, be persecution!
</p>
<p>The killing of Robespierre was not murder. It was the outrages
</p>
<p>of the Mormons that brought upon the head of their leader the arm
</p>
<p>of justice. The frenzy of a fanatic cannot make out of the affair
</p>
<p>persecution. Religion or religious opinions had nothing to do with
</p>
<p>it. It was neither more nor less than the assassination of one whose
</p>
<p>238 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>career was in open rebellion against God and man. Still the guilt

<p>of his death lies upon those who, in violation of the laws both of

<p>THE PROPHET'S PROMISES REALIZED
</p>
<p>By "M. F. C."
</p>
<p>My grandfather and his family arrived in Nauvoo from the
</p>
<p>Isle of Man late in the year 1843. Finding no employment in
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, grandfather and family removed to Warsaw, he giving

</p>
<p>his overcoat and grandmother's shawl as security for the loan of
</p>
<p>four dollars to pay the passage thence. Here they worked hard at
</p>
<p>brick-making for about six months. My father's journal contains
</p>
<p>the following:
</p>
<p>"By this time there arose a great disturbance about the 'Mor-
</p>
<p>mons' throughout the State of Illinois. The little town we lived in
</p>
<p>was not a whit behind in being excited, and all the inhabitants were
</p>
<p>ordered to take up arms against the 'Mormons/ Nauvoo, and Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith. Father, too, was ordered to take up arms against his breth-
</p>
<p>ren and sisters. Two armed men came to the house we lived in,
</p>
<p>and took him by force to the office, where they took names, and
</p>
<p>offered him a musket, which he refused to accept, saying at the
</p>
<p>same time, 'Gentlemen, I shall never fight against my brethren 
</p>
<p>the Saints of Almighty God  no, never !' Those who were walking
</p>
<p>behind him, when they marched him to their rendezvous, made
</p>
<p>motions as though they were going to cut his throat. They would
</p>
<p>not have anything to do with me because I was too young, and told
</p>
<p>me to go home and take care of my mother. They then ordered
</p>
<p>us to leave the town within twenty-four hours. We were not able
</p>
<p>to do so, because we could not procure any conveyance. Father
</p>
<p>himself was driven late in the afternoon, several miles out of town,
</p>
<p>at the point of the bayonet. They told him if he ever returned they
</p>
<p>would shoot him, and appointed a guard that night to see if he
</p>
<p>came back. He traveled on to Nauvoo, a distance of between twenty
</p>
<p>and thirty miles. There had been some very wet weather previously,
</p>
<p>and the creeks were high, so that he was obliged to swim many of
</p>
<p>the streams during the night. Owing to the current being so swift,
</p>
<p>he was carried down some of them a considerable distance before
</p>
<p>he could reach the other side.
</p>
<p>"He reached Nauvoo in the morning feeling very fatigued.
</p>
<p>After resting awhile, and receiving some refreshments, he went
</p>
<p>to see the Prophet Joseph, told him what had occurred, and that
</p>
<p>he had left his family to the mercy of the mob, and was afraid they

</p>
<p>would massacre them. Joseph then raised his hand and said :
</p>
<p>'Brother C  , they shan't hurt a hair of their heads. God bless you.'
</p>
<p>Father then joined the Nauvoo Legion. The guns being all engaged,
</p>
<p>he procured a pitchfork and marched. * * *
</p>
<p>"Father was still in Nauvoo. About 4 p.m., on the 28th day
</p>
<p>of June, 1844, mother and myself, being in Warsaw, heard cheering
</p>
<p>and saw men throwing their hats up in the air. I felt like knowing
</p>
<p>what was the matter, and ran out among them, making my way
</p>
<p>through the blood-thirsty mob towards the one who was speaking.
</p>
<p>I soon learned that they had killed Joseph Smith and his brother,
</p>
<p>Hyrum. The speaker saw me and ordered me home to stop with
</p>
<p>my mother. Knowing that I was a 'Mormon' boy, a crowd of school
</p>
<p>boys followed me, being urged on by the mob. They clubbed me all
</p>
<p>the way home with whatever they could find in the street. I escaped
</p>
<p>them through a neighboring yard, and got into the house the back
</p>
<p>way. Soon after I had occasion to go to the river for a pail of
</p>
<p>water. The mob saw me again, and hired a drunken man, for a
</p>
<p>large sum of money, to throw me into the river, and drown me.
</p>
<p>He followed me to the bank of the Mississippi River and as I was

</p>
<p>stooping to dip up the pail of water, caught me by the back of the
</p>
<p>neck, and said, 'Now you d  d little "Mormon, " I'll drown you.'
</p>
<p>I asked him why he would drown me, and if I had ever done him
</p>
<p>any harm? 'No/ he said, 'I won't drown you. I'll be d  d if I do, they
</p>
<p>may drown you themselves; I've got my pay, you may go home.'
</p>
<p>By this time, mother heard that the mob was drowning me. I
</p>
<p>started home with my pail of water, and met her coming to rescue
</p>
<p>me. Said I, 'Mother, all is right. The Lord is on our side. You
</p>
<p>know Joseph prophesied the mobocrats should not hurt a hair of
</p>
<p>our heads. They can't do it.' That evening they put a torch three
</p>
<p>times to the house we occupied, but it would not burn. During this
</p>
<p>time the mobocrats of Warsaw were moving their wives and chil-
</p>
<p>dren across the river, so as to be secure from the expected 'Mormon'
</p>
<p>company. After a few days of excitement and anxiety, a team came
</p>
<p>for us from Nauvoo, the driver stating that Brother C  had sent
</p>
<p>him for his family and goods. We were not long in packing up and
</p>
<p>leaving Warsaw. We arrived in Nauvoo about 3 p.m. the next day.
</p>
<p>Father was out of town on business, but we met some friends, who
</p>
<p>found us a house. We got our furniture into it, and felt at home
</p>
<p>once more, feeling that we were delivered from our enemies, by
</p>
<p>the power of God."

</p>
<p>" . . . instead of cowardice, they exhibited foolhardy courage,
</p>
<p>for they must have known or thought that they would bring down
</p>
<p>on themselves the vengeance of the Mormons. True, the act of an
</p>
<p>armed body going to the jail and killing prisoners does appear at
</p>
<p>first sight dastardly, but we look at it as though these men were
</p>
<p>the executioners of justice, and their act is no more cowardly than
</p>
<p>is the act of the hangman in stretching up a defenseless convict who
</p>
<p>is incapable of resistance. If any other mode could have been de-

</p>
<p>Preparation and Funeral of the Martyrs
</p>
<p>MARTYRS LEAVE CARTHAGE FOR NAUVOO
</p>
<p>About 8 o'clock on the morning after the murder (the 28th)
</p>
<p>Dr. Richards started for Nauvoo with the bodies of Joseph and
</p>
<p>Hyrum on two wagons, accompanied by Samuel H. Smith, who was
</p>
<p>a brother of Joseph and Hyrum, and a Mr. Hamilton and a guard
</p>
<p>of eight soldiers who had been sent on that service by Gen. Dem-
</p>
<p>ming. The bodies were covered with bushes to keep them from the
</p>
<p>hot sun. Nearly all the people of the city, when they heard the
</p>
<p>bodies were coming, collected together and went out to meet them ;
</p>
<p>they were under the direction of the city marshal. Besides private
</p>
<p>citizens there were the City Council, Joseph's staff and the staffs of
</p>
<p>the other generals of the Legion, and many of the officers of that
</p>
<p>body. The procession was an imposing one, and the lamentations
</p>
<p>and wailings of the people, were such as are seldom witnessed or
</p>
<p>heard. It was as though every person in the assemblage had lost
</p>
<p>his nearest kinsmen and friends.
</p>
<p>When the procession arrived, the bodies were both taken into
</p>
<p>the Nauvoo Mansion, Joseph's residence. No language that we can
</p>
<p>use would do justice to the scenes that followed. The heart-rending
</p>
<p>grief of the families of the deceased and of all who were there was
</p>
<p>indescribable. But the public was not then admitted to see the bodies.
</p>
<p>They were told that the next morning they would be exposed to
</p>
<p>view.
</p>
<p>There were about eight or ten thousand people collected to-
</p>
<p>gether on that occasion. From the frame of the building which
</p>
<p>stood on the opposite corner to the Mansion they were addressed
</p>
<p>by Dr. Willard Richards, W. W. Phelps, and two of Joseph's law-
</p>
<p>yers, Messrs. Woods and Reid, and Col. Stephen Markham. The
</p>
<p>people were admonished by Dr. Richards to keep the peace. He
</p>
<p>had pledged his honor and his life, he said, for their good conduct.
</p>
<p>The other speeches were generally to the same effect. The people
</p>
<p>resolved with one united voice to trust to the law for a remedy of

</p>
<p>such a high-handed assassination, and when that failed, to call upon
</p>
<p>God to avenge them of their wrongs.
</p>
<p>The next day it was estimated that over ten thousand persons
</p>
<p>visited the Mansion to see the bodies of the Prophet and Patriarch.
</p>
<p>From 8 o'clock in the morning until 5 o'clock in the evening a living
</p>
<p>stream passed through the doors of the room where they laid in
</p>
<p>their coffins. A mock funeral took place that afternoon by the
</p>
<p>boxes which contained the coffins being carried to the graveyard
</p>
<p>in the hearse. But the bodies were secretly buried that night. This
</p>
<p>was done to prevent the enemies of the martyrs getting possession
</p>
<p>of their bodies.

<p>PREPARATION AND FUNERAL OF THE MARTYRS 243
</p>
<p>THE MOCK BURIAL OF THE PROPHETS
</p>
<p>It was a solemn procession wending its way that sultry day in
</p>
<p>June, from the Mansion House, on Water Street to the public ceme-
</p>
<p>tery. As the hearse was drawn from the heart of the city, the
</p>
<p>funeral of the martyrs was held in the grove near the Temple.
</p>
<p>There were few dry eyes in the congregation as the dark carriage
</p>
<p>slowly made its way along Mulholland Street.
</p>
<p>Few, indeed, were the ones who knew that the coffins in the
</p>
<p>carriage contained only bags of sand, for this burial must be as
</p>
<p>secret as that of Moses, which is thus described : "For the Lord took
</p>
<p>him unto his fathers * * * therefore no man knoweth of his
</p>
<p>sepulchre unto this day."
</p>
<p>At the city cemetery when the bags of sand were lowered into
</p>
<p>the graves ostensibly intended for the bodies of the martyrs, strong
</p>
<p>men wept like children bereft of parents, while hysterical women
</p>
<p>cried and prayed and fainted ; yet the bodies were safely concealed
</p>
<p>in a darkened closet at the Mansion House, for the bodies of these
</p>
<p>men were not safe even in the grave. Not only the rigid bodies
</p>
<p>of the martyrs, but their very graves must be buried to protect
</p>
<p>them from vandal hands in the night.
</p>
<p>The proposed secret burial was known only by a few trusted
</p>
<p>friends who were pledged to guard the secret with their lives, for
</p>
<p>the bodies of the martyrs must be shrouded in secrecy and buried
</p>
<p>in oblivion to prevent vandal hands from profaning the final rest-

<p>ing place of these martyred men.*** Fiends from Missouri  their

<p>of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, while buried secretly and at night
</p>
<p>soon after the massacre, lie in the exact spot where they were then
</p>
<p>buried, viz. : in the family burying ground a short distance in the
</p>
<p>rear of the old mansion house. The bodies were deposited in a
</p>
<p>brick vault. "When Aunt Emma Smith  Joseph's widow, later
</p>
<p>Mrs. C. L. Bidamon died in 1875, I think, five of us boys, Fred.
</p>
<p>Solomon, Don and Alvin Salisbury, and Don Milikin, all her neph-
</p>
<p>ews, acted as pall bearers at her funeral. We buried Aunt Emma
</p>
<p>by the side of the Prophet. Of course there can be nothing left of
</p>
<p>the bodies of Joseph and Hyrum but dust. I am satisfied that the
</p>
<p>Prophets were buried there, and that their bodies have never been
</p>
<p>disturbed." "The reason why the burial was secret," said Mrs.
</p>
<p>Salisbury, "was from the fact that a large sum of money was offered
</p>
<p>for the head of Joseph. It was thought best at the time to have
</p>
<p>the burial private, and both bodies were placed in a brick vault to
</p>
<p>prevent their being stolen." Millennial Star, 56:549-51.
</p>
<p>244 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>THE PROPHETS BURIED IN THE NAUVOO HOUSE
</p>
<p>In the soft soil of the floorless room beneath the fortress of
</p>
<p>stone and brick only one story high, busy spades prepared a secret
</p>
<p>tomb to hide their martyred leaders from vandal hands. Upon
</p>
<p>the soft, tell-tale carpet of fresh earth forming the floor of the
</p>
<p>Nauvoo House, beaten paths of footprints were left by the nocturnal
</p>
<p>visitors who spared the sexton the task of burial. In the gathering
</p>
<p>darkness they carried the surplus earth to the river and scattered
</p>
<p>chips of wood and stone about the buried sepulchres so that the
</p>
<p>spot would not look unlike the surrounding area, thus not arousing
</p>
<p>the curiosity of the workmen.
</p>
<p>Their acts of camouflage were further made complete when
</p>
<p>the understanding heavens poured down a flood of tears to mingle
</p>
<p>with those of the sorrowing saints. The procession soon disorgan-
</p>
<p>ized, each man seeking shelter under his own roof. The privacy
</p>
<p>of their homes had scarcely concealed the men who knew the sec-
</p>
<p>ret of the burial, until the weeping heavens deluged the country.
</p>
<p>When the pounding rain had ceased to fall, there was not a trace
</p>
<p>of foot prints in the soft soil, the roily rivulets bearing them into
</p>
<p>the wide stream whose arms feverishly reached across the sandy
</p>
<p>shore toward the unmarked grave of the martyrs. And thus were
</p>
<p>interred in a secret tomb not only the bodies of the martyrs, but
</p>
<p>their graves as well. No visible mounds of earth were left to re-
</p>
<p>mind the mourners of the sorrow of the separation.

<p>BODIES OF THE MARTYRS REMOVED TO THEIR

<p>FINAL RESTING PLACE
</p>
<p>When the endless chain of time slowly dragged its weary links
</p>
<p>of days away, numbing the sorrow of the parting and dimming the
</p>
<p>widows' vision of their slain, it was deemed wisdom to remove the
</p>
<p>bodies to a safer place of keeping. At the time the early autumn
</p>
<p>stripped the green leaves from the trees and traded scarred, brown,
</p>
<p>lifeless vegetation for the fresh foliage of the fields, the thoughts of

</p>
<p>widows turned, like the season, to scenes of death. It was at this
</p>
<p>sad season of the year that the widow Emma gave birth to her
</p>
<p>last-born son, thus taking her thoughts back to her martyred hus-
</p>
<p>band.
</p>
<p>Emma insisted that the bodies be taken to the Old Homestead
</p>
<p>and given secret burial near the intimate family who slept in the
</p>
<p>shadow of the old trading post. The spot selected for this unmarked
</p>
<p>grave was beneath the old Spring House. This small building was
</p>
<p>simply a canopied cellar within whose moist walls of earth the
</p>
<p>Smith family had stored their supply of milk, butter, cream, etc.,
</p>
<p>and vegetables during the hot days of summer. This sheltered
</p>
<p>cellar was so deep and close to the river that its cool walls provided
</p>

</p>
<p>Ten men buried the remains of the martyrs in the basement
</p>
<p>of the Nauvoo House, while only four men placed the bodies in the
</p>
<p>secret tomb near the Old Homestead. Before the secret was known
</p>
<p>abroad, this small structure had been torn down and its cellar
</p>
<p>compartment filled in with earth, thus doubly securing the mystery
</p>
<p>of the unknown grave. With the passing of time it became a pro-

<p>found mystery just where the Spring House stood where once the

<p>graves were sheltered.

</p>
<p>THE SORROW OF THE PROPHET'S SAINTED MOTHER
</p>
<p>After the corpses were washed and dressed in their burial
</p>
<p>clothes, we were allowed to see them. I had for a long time braced
</p>
<p>every nerve, roused every energy of my soul and called upon God to
</p>
<p>strengthen me, but when I entered the room and saw my murdered
</p>
<p>sons extended both at once before my eyes and heard the sobs and
</p>
<p>groans of my family and the cries of "Father ! Husband ! Brothers !"
</p>
<p>from the lips of their wives, children, brothers and sisters, it was
</p>
<p>too much ; I sank back, crying to the Lord in the agony of my soul :
</p>
<p>'My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken this family?" A voice
</p>
<p>replied : "I have taken them to myself that they might have rest."
</p>
<p>Emma was carried back to her room almost in a state of insensi-
</p>
<p>bility. Her oldest son approached the corpse and dropped upon his
</p>
<p>knees, and laying his cheek against his father's and kissing him,
</p>
<p>exclaimed, "Oh, my father! my father." As for myself, I was
</p>
<p>swallowed up in the depths of my afflictions, yet I was dumb until
</p>
<p>I arose again to contemplate the spectacle before me. Oh! at that
</p>
<p>moment how my mind flew through every scene of sorrow and dis-
</p>
<p>tress which we had passed, together, in which they had shown the
</p>
<p>innocence and sympathy which filled their guileless hearts. As I
</p>
<p>looked upon their peaceful, smiling countenances, I seemed almost
</p>
<p>to hear them say, "Mother, iveep not for us, tve have overcome the

<p>world by love; tee carried to them the gospel, that their souls might
</p>
<p>be saved; they sleiu us for our testimony, and thus placed us beyond
</p>
<p>their power; their ascendency is for a moment, ours is an eternal
</p>
<p>triumph." I then thought upon the promise which I had received
</p>
<p>in Missouri, that in five years Joseph should have power over all
</p>
<p>his enemies. The time had elapsed and the promise was fulfilled.***
</p>
<p>On the following day the funeral rites of the murdered ones
</p>
<p>were attended to, in the midst of terror and alarm, for the mob had
</p>
<p>made their arrangements to burn the city that night, but by the
</p>
<p>diligence of the brethren, they were kept at bay until they became
</p>
<p>discouraged and returned to their homes. ***
</p>
<p>Here ends the history of my life, as well as that of my family,
</p>
<p>as far as I intend carrying it for the present. And I shall leave
</p>
<p>the world to judge, as seemeth them good, concerning what I have
</p>
<p>written. But this much I will say, that the testimony which I have
</p>
<p>given is true, and will stand forever; and the same will be my
</p>
<p>testimony in the day of God Almighty, when I shall meet them,

<p>Sunday, January 22, 1928, copy of which paper is owned by the com-

<p>"Nauvoo, 111., Jan. 22. Three skeletons, brown with a century's
</p>
<p>decay, lay in three narrow crypts in a tiny cemetery on the shore of
</p>
<p>Lake Cooper. Wan, wintry sunlight shadowed the gaunt branches
</p>
<p>of trees across the strange grave, and sharp gusts of wind stirred
</p>
<p>the bones in their shallow vaults. A reverent group huddled to-
</p>
<p>gether as a plaintive voice rose above the ice-muffled requiem of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi  a minister, pleading for divine guidance. For
</p>
<p>twenty minutes the voice, quivering with cold at times, intoned a
</p>
<p>prayer. A cold blast swept "Amen" from his lips, the skeletons
</p>
<p>were covered, the crypts sealed and a hundred persons hurried to
</p>
<p>shelter. Such were the final rites Friday for Joseph Smith. Jr.,

<p>inally known as the Mormon church, and Hyrum Smith, his brother,
</p>
<p>whose secreted graves were located in Nauvoo by officials of the
</p>
<p>Church after a six-day search. The bones of Emma Smith, wife of
</p>
<p>Joseph, were placed beside the skeletons of the brothers.
</p>
<p>"Joseph and Hyrum Smith were shot to death by a mob in the
</p>
<p>Hancock county jail at Carthage, June 27, 1844. Their bodies were
</p>
<p>taken to Nauvoo and the burial place was kept secret by Emma
</p>
<p>Smith who feared that enemies might mutilate them. The story
</p>
<p>of the secret burial was divulged to Frederick M. Smith, of Kansas
</p>
<p>City, Mo., grandson of the Prophet Joseph Smith, by Frederick
</p>
<p>Smith's father, Joseph Smith III. The exact location of the grave
</p>
<p>was not determined until less than a week ago. The bodies have been
</p>
<p>positively identified, according to officials of the Church of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ of Latter-day Saints. The bones were placed in crypts and
</p>
<p>sealed in a solid block of concrete which will form the foundation
</p>
<p>for an impressive monument to be erected later. Services held at
</p>
<p>the sealing of the crypts were simple and brief. Three oblong
</p>
<p>PREPARATION AND FUNERAL OF THE MARTYRS 247
</p>
<p>depressions had been sunk in a base of concrete. After the skulls
</p>
<p>of both Joseph and Hyrum Smith had been photographed from
</p>
<p>every angle, the skeletons were assembled on beds of soft material
</p>
<p>placed in the depressions. The feet lay to the north, and the heads
</p>
<p>to the south. Joseph Smith, as founder of the Mormon church,
</p>
<p>now known as the Re-organized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
</p>
<p>day Saints, was placed in the center crypt. To his east was placed
</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith, his brother, and to the west, the bones of Emma
</p>
<p>Smith, wife of Joseph, taken from another grave, were laid. * * *
</p>
<p>"Settlement of rumors concerning the location of the bodies of
</p>
<p>Joseph and Hyrum Smith for all time is the most important sig-
</p>
<p>nificance of the discovery made in Nauvoo a feiv days ago, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to Frederick M. Smith, president of the Reorganized Church of
</p>
<p>Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and J. A. Gardner, publicity di-
</p>
<p>rector. 'We think it rather opportune that the discovery came at
</p>
<p>this time/ Mr. Gardner said, 'in view of the fact that in 1930 we
</p>
<p>are preparing to celebrate the first centennial of the Church. It
</p>
<p>will have been organized 100 years on April 6, 1930. We are pre-
</p>
<p>paring for a great celebration at Independence, Mo., and expect
</p>
<p>by that time to have the monument over the bodies of Joseph and
</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith erected at Nauvoo/
</p>
<p>"Frederick M. Smith of Kansas City, now president of the
</p>
<p>Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, spoke
</p>
<p>briefly, eulogizing his grandfather and Hyrum Smith as martyrs
</p>
<p>to their religion. Then James A. Gillen, member of the Quorum of
</p>
<p>Twelve Apostles, of Independence, Mo., gave a long prayer. The
</p>
<p>services were made brief because of inclement weather. The crypts
</p>
<p>of the three Smiths are located in the old Mormon burial ground,
</p>
<p>a small enclosed plot located about eight blocks west of the Nauvoo
</p>
<p>business district, on a peninsula which extends into Lake Cooper,
</p>
<p>as the Mississippi is known at that point. It is, perhaps, one of
</p>
<p>the most beautiful spots on the upper Mississippi. Adjacent to the
</p>
<p>graveyard are the Mansion House, where Joseph Smith was re-

<p>siding at the time he was assassinated; the Joseph Smith home
</p>
<p>and the Nauvoo house, located to the south of the Smith home,
</p>
<p>which was to have been a hotel. All of these buildings, though
</p>
<p>almost a century old, are still standing and have been kept in
</p>
<p>excellent repair by the church. J. W. Layton, caretaker of the
</p>
<p>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at Nauvoo, lives in
</p>
<p>the Mansion House.
</p>
<p>"Officials of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
</p>
<p>day Saints, say there is no doubt regarding the identity of the
</p>
<p>skeletons. The skull of Hyrum, saints say, clearly shows a bullet
</p>
<p>hole beneath the right eye and to the right of the nose, which
</p>
<p>biographers and historians claim was the manner in which Hyrum
</p>
<p>was wounded. Hyrum Smith was leaning against the door of the
</p>
<p>Hancock county jail to resist forced entrance when a bullet plowed
</p>
<p>through the door and struck him in the face. The skull is torn
</p>
<p>away at the point where the bullet is supposed to have struck, and
</p>
<p>church officials believe this to show the course of the bullet. No
</p>
<p>bullets were found in the graves, however.
</p>
<p>"People of Nauvoo and members of the Reorganized church
</p>
<p>248 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>apparently have always been certain that the bodies of the two
</p>
<p>Smiths were located in Nauvoo. However, officials of the Reor-
</p>
<p>ganized church say they have found it necessary to repudiate state-
</p>
<p>ments emanating from the Utah branch of the church that the
</p>
<p>bodies were in Utah. The Utah and the Reorganized church are
</p>
<p>separate. A breach exists.
</p>
<p>"Frederick M. Smith, now president of the Reorganized church,
</p>
<p>tells an interesting story of the finding of the bodies. His father,
</p>
<p>he said, remembered standing by the side of Emma Smith as the
</p>
<p>bodies were lowered into shallow graves which had been prepared
</p>
<p>in the bottom of a spring house, standing near the old homestead.
</p>
<p>The spring house, Joseph Smith III told Frederick, had a brick
</p>
<p>floor and foundation wall. The bodies would be found in the north-
</p>
<p>west corner of the place designated, he was told. All of this had
</p>
<p>been kept a family secret. Emma Smith had kept it so after she
</p>
<p>allowed two coffins filled with sand to be buried as Joseph and
</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith, in a Nauvoo cemetery. The spring house rotted
</p>
<p>and fell away, leaving no mark by which the grave might be found.
</p>
<p>Attempt to locate the bodies had been discussed often, but other
</p>
<p>activities prevented until Wednesday, January 11. On that day,
</p>
<p>W. 0. Hand, of Kansas City, engineer, started excavation in the
</p>
<p>vicinity. He and his men first dug near the water's edge, outside
</p>
<p>the graveyard enclosure, but met with no success. Then a trench
</p>
<p>system of searching was devised and after 'a season of prayer,'
</p>
<p>Mr. Hand and his crew uncovered the bodies on Monday, January
</p>
<p>16. The grave of Emma Smith was opened first. It was marked,
</p>
<p>but the grave stone was removed some distance from the body.
</p>
<p>From this grave trenches were extended to determine where the
</p>
<p>ground had been disturbed and finally to the south and west of the
</p>
<p>feet of Emma Smith the brick walls of the old spring house were
</p>
<p>struck. Proceeding farther, the men uncovered the remains of
</p>
<p>two walnut coffins lying side by side, the tops of which had caved
</p>
<p>in. The wood was nearly dust and gave way as soon as touched.

<p>A group of Nauvoo citizens was called in to view the bones in the
</p>
<p>grave. The bodies were then taken out and put in canvas and the
</p>
<p>skulls were conveyed to the Mansion House, where they were
</p>
<p>photographed."
</p>
<p>FUNERAL AND INTERMENT OF THE MARTYRS
</p>
<p>By B. H. Roberts
</p>
<p>When the bodies of Joseph and Hyrum arrived at the Mansion,
</p>
<p>the doors were closed immediately. The people were told to go
</p>
<p>quietly home, and the bodies would be viewed the next morning at
</p>
<p>eight o'clock.
</p>
<p>Dimick B. Huntington, with the assistance of William Marks
</p>
<p>and William D. Huntington, washed the bodies from head to foot.
</p>
<p>Joseph was shot in the right breast, also under the heart, in the
</p>
<p>lower part of his bowels and the right side, and on the back part
</p>
<p>of the right hip. One ball had come out at the right shoulder-blade.
</p>
<p>Cotton soaked in camphor was put into each wound, and the bodies
</p>
<p>PREPARATION AND FUNERAL OF THE MARTYRS 249
</p>
<p>laid out with fine plain drawers and shirt, white neckerchiefs,
</p>
<p>white cotton stockings and white shrouds. (Gilbert Goldsmith was
</p>
<p>doorkeeper at the time).
</p>
<p>After this was done, Emma (who at the time was pregnant)
</p>
<p>also Mary (Hyrum's wife) with the children of the martyred
</p>
<p>Prophet and Patriarch, were admitted to see the bodies. On first
</p>
<p>seeing the corpse of her husband, Emma screamed and fell back,
</p>
<p>but was caught and supported by Dimick B. Huntington. She then
</p>
<p>fell forward to the Prophet's face and kissed him, calling him by
</p>
<p>name, and begged him to speak to her once. Mary, (the Patriarch's
</p>
<p>wife) manifested calmness and composure throughout the trying
</p>
<p>scene, which was affecting in the extreme. Relatives and particular
</p>
<p>friends were also permitted to view the remains during the evening.
</p>
<p>Saturday 29.  At 7 a.m. the bodies were put into the coffins
</p>
<p>which were covered with black velvet fastened with brass nails.
</p>
<p>Over the face of each corpse a lid was hung with brass hinges,
</p>
<p>under which was a square of glass to protect the face, and the coffin
</p>
<p>was lined with white cambric. The coffins were then each put into
</p>
<p>a rough pine box.
</p>
<p>At 8 a.m. the room was thrown open for the Saints to view
</p>
<p>the bodies of their martyred Prophet and Patriarch, and it is
</p>
<p>estimated that over ten thousand persons visited the remains that
</p>
<p>day, as there was a perfect living stream of people entering in at
</p>
<p>the west door of the Mansion and out at the north door from 8 a.m.
</p>
<p>to 5 p.m., at which hour a request was made that the Mansion
</p>
<p>should be cleared, so that the family could take their farewell look
</p>
<p>at the remains.
</p>
<p>The coffins were then taken out of the boxes into the little
</p>
<p>bedroom in the northeast corner of the Mansion, and there con-
</p>
<p>cealed and the doors locked. Bags of sand were then placed in
</p>
<p>each end of the boxes, which were nailed up, and a mock funeral
</p>
<p>took place, the boxes being put into a hearse and driven to the
</p>
<p>graveyard by William D. Huntington, and there deposited in a

</p>
<p>grave with the usual ceremonies.
</p>
<p>This was done to prevent enemies of the martyred Prophet
</p>
<p>and Patriarch getting possession of the bodies, as they threatened
</p>
<p>they would do. As the hearse passed the meeting ground accom-
</p>
<p>panied by a few men, William W. Phelps, was preaching the funeral
</p>
<p>sermon.
</p>
<p>About midnight the coffins containing the bodies were taken
</p>
<p>from the Mansion by Dimick B. Huntington, Edward Hunter, Wil-
</p>
<p>liam D. Huntington, William Marks, Jonathan H. Holmes, Gilbert
</p>
<p>Goldsmith, Alpheus Cutler, Lorenzo D. Wasson, and Philip B.
</p>
<p>Lewis, preceded by James Emmett as guard with his musket.
</p>
<p>They went through the garden, round by the pump, and were
</p>
<p>conveyed to the Nauvoo house, which was then built to the first
</p>
<p>joists of the basement, and buried in the basement story.
</p>
<p>After the bodies were interred, and the ground smoothed off
</p>
<p>as it was before, and chips of wood and stone and other rubbish
</p>
<p>thrown over, so as to make it appear like the rest of the ground
</p>
<p>around the graves, a most terrific shower of rain, accompanied with
</p>
<p>250 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>thunder and lightning, occurred, and obliterated all traces of the
</p>
<p>fact that the earth had been newly dug.
</p>
<p>The bodies remained in the cellar of the Nauvoo House where
</p>
<p>they were buried, until the fall, when they were removed by Dimick
</p>
<p>B. Huntington, William D. Huntington, Jonathan H. Holmes, and
</p>
<p>Gilbert Goldsmith, at Emma's request, to near the Mansion, and
</p>
<p>buried side by side, and the bee house then moved and placed over
</p>
<p>their graves.
</p>
<p>The deceased children of Joseph were afterwards removed and
</p>
<p>interred in the same place. It was found at this time that two
</p>
<p>of Hyrum's teeth had fallen into the inside of his mouth, supposed
</p>
<p>to have been done by a ball at the time of the martyrdom, but which
</p>
<p>was not discovered at the time he was laid out, in consequence of
</p>
<p>his jaws being tied up. d. H. C. 6:627-9.
</p>
<p>STATEMENT BY B. H. ROBERTS
</p>
<p>The above (that is, the "Funeral and Interment of the Mar-
</p>
<p>tyrs") is from the Deseret News of November 25, 1857, published
</p>
<p>in Salt Lake City. The same historical statement verbatim is found
</p>
<p>in the Millennial Star of August 9, 1862, which was republishing
</p>
<p>at the time this History from the Deseret Xeivs. This historical
</p>
<p>narrative of the burial of Joseph and Hyrum Smith from the two
</p>
<p>preceding periodicals was published in book form under the title
</p>
<p>of the History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
</p>
<p>and includes the above excerpt from the Deseret News and Millen-
</p>
<p>nial Star, in Vol. 6, pages 627-629, so that this has been the con-
</p>
<p>tinuous history of the burial and burial places of the two martyrs
</p>
<p>before the people of Utah and all the world.
</p>
<p>"In 1884, while writing my Rise and Fall of Nauvoo, I
</p>
<p>visited Nauvoo to secure photographs for illustrating the articles
</p>
<p>on the above subject which were then appearing in the Contributor,
</p>
<p>a magazine published in Salt Lake City. After photographing the
</p>
<p>house which was known as the old Smith homestead, and after-
</p>
<p>wards as the home of Hyrum Smith, I called upon Major Bidamon

</p>
<p>who at that time was living just across the road from Emma
</p>
<p>Smith's grave in some rooms raised on the foundations of the
</p>
<p>Nauvoo House. Mr. Bidamon married Emma Smith some years
</p>
<p>after the death of the prophet. In the course of the conversation
</p>
<p>I asked Major Bidamon why Emma Smith was buried out in the
</p>
<p>yard of the Smith homestead alone, rather than in the Nauvoo
</p>
<p>cemetery. To this Mr. Bidamon replied: 'She isn't alone; she is
</p>
<p>buried by the side of her former husband, Joseph Smith and his
</p>
<p>brother Hyrum.' He then went on to say that a day or two before
</p>
<p>her demise, Emma Smith called those to her who would likely
</p>
<p>dispose of her remains, after her death, and directed them to go
</p>
<p>to the southeast corner of the old Smith homestead, and in a di-
</p>
<p>rect line from that corner take twenty-five paces and there dig
</p>
<p>down and they would come upon a brick vault. She desired that
</p>
<p>her coffin be placed by the side of that vault. She did not ask for
</p>
<p>the vault to be opened, but that her coffin might be laid by the side
</p>
<p>PREPARATION AND FUNERAL OF THE MARTYRS 251
</p>
<p>of it, and 'that was done according to her wishes/ said Mr. Bida-
</p>
<p>mon."
</p>
<p>"On returning to Salt Lake City from this visit to Nauvoo,
</p>
<p>I reported this incident to President Joseph F. Smith, the son of
</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith, and later president of the Church, whereupon Joseph
</p>
<p>F. Smith stated that this was in exact accordance with information
</p>
<p>imparted to him by his mother, Mary Fielding Smith, wife of
</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith. She had stated to him, Joseph Fielding Smith, that
</p>
<p>at the time that the remains of Joseph and Hyrum were being
</p>
<p>removed in the night by Emma Smith, from their first place of
</p>
<p>interment in the basement of the Nauvoo house, she awoke in the
</p>
<p>night, having a strange presentiment that something was wrong.
</p>
<p>Some strange thing was either impending or happening, which
</p>
<p>made her restless and sleepless, and so about midnight she arose
</p>
<p>from her bed, went about the house and finally outside of it, and
</p>
<p>soon discovered that something was going on over at the Nauvoo
</p>
<p>House, and accordingly, on crossing the road she came upon the
</p>
<p>parties who were removing the bodies of her husband and his
</p>
<p>brother, under the direction of Emma Smith. Evidently she as-
</p>
<p>sented to the removal to which she had been so strangely brought
</p>
<p>as a witness; and this was the account of that experience which
</p>
<p>she related to her son Joseph F. Smith, in whose family the incident
</p>
<p>is a cherished memory.****
</p>
<p>"Moreover, Elder S. 0. Bennion, president of the Central
</p>
<p>States Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
</p>
<p>stationed at Independence, Missouri, writing to the president of
</p>
<p>the Church at Salt Lake City, Utah, under date of January 21,
</p>
<p>1928, says :
</p>
<p>"Several years ago 'Young Joseph' as he was called (president
</p>
<p>of the Reorganized church) told me he was going to bring his
</p>
<p>father's body to Independence, and when I went out to Utah to

<p>conference I told President Joseph F. Smith, and President Smith
</p>
<p>said to me: 'You tell Joseph not to disturb those bodies without

</p>
<p>This message was delivered and there evidently the matter of
</p>
<p>removing the bodies was dropped by Mr. Fred M. Smith's predeces-
</p>
<p>sor.
</p>
<p>In view of all of this information representing continuous
</p>
<p>knowledge by the Church authorities in Utah as to the whereabouts
</p>
<p>of the burial place of the brothers, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, it
</p>
<p>will appear to reasonable minds that the effort of sensational
</p>
<p>"finding" of the skeletons of these men, and the claim of the Utah
</p>
<p>church authorities being overthrown by such alleged "discovery"
</p>
<p>is ridiculous and a cheap effort at sensationalism, and the bolster-
</p>
<p>ing up of a cheaper claim of "inspirational guidance" in the finding
</p>
<p>of them, when all along the Reorganized Church branch of the
</p>
<p>Smith family have known of the location of these bodies as well as
</p>
<p>the Utah branch of the Smith family has known of it.
</p>
<p>In plain terms, the whole procedure of Mr. Fred M. Smith
</p>
<p>and those associated with him in this business is unwarranted, a
</p>
<p>cheap bid for a sensation, and for the reputation of being guided

<p>by "inspiration" to find the remains of Joseph and Hyrum Smith,

</p>
<p>The Sorrow and Mourning of the Saints
</p>
<p>NIGHT OF THE MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>By Apostle Orson Hyde
</p>
<p>Twenty-seventh of June, 1844. Eventful period in the calendar
</p>
<p>of the nineteenth century ! That awful night ! I remember it well :
</p>
<p>I shall never forget it ! Thousands and tens of thousands will never
</p>
<p>forget it ! A solemn thrill  a melancholy awe comes o'er my spirit !
</p>
<p>The memorable scene is fresh before me ! It requires no art of the
</p>
<p>pencil, no retrospection of history, to portray it. The impression of
</p>
<p>the Almighty Spirit on that occasion will run parallel with eternity !
</p>
<p>The scene was not portrayed by earthquake, or thunderings, and
</p>
<p>lightnings, and tempests; but the majesty and sovereignty of
</p>
<p>Jehovah was felt far more impressively in the still, small voice of
</p>
<p>that significant hour, than the roaring of many waters, or the
</p>
<p>artillery of many thunders, when the spirit of Joseph was driven
</p>
<p>back to the bosom of God, by an ungrateful and bloodthirsty world !
</p>
<p>There was an unspeakable something, a portentious significancy
</p>
<p>in the firmament and among the inhabitants of the earth. Multi-
</p>
<p>tudes felt the whisperings of woe and grief, and the forebodings of
</p>
<p>tribulation and sorrow that they will never forget, though the
</p>
<p>tongue of man can never utter it. The Saints of God, whether near
</p>
<p>the scene of blood, or even a thousand miles distant, felt at the
</p>
<p>very moment the Prophet lay in royal gore, that an awful deed was
</p>
<p>perpetrated. 0, the repulsive chill! the melancholy vibrations of
</p>
<p>the very air, as the prince of darkness receded in hopeful triumph
</p>
<p>from the scene of slaughter ! That night could not the Saints sleep,
</p>
<p>though uninformed by man of what had passed with the Seer and
</p>
<p>Patriarch, and far, far remote from the scene; yet to them sleep
</p>
<p>refused a visitation  the eyelids refused to close  the hearts of
</p>
<p>many sighed deeply in secret, and inquired, "Why am I thus?"
</p>
<p>One of the Twelve Apostles, while traveling a hundred miles
</p>
<p>from the scene of assassination, and totally ignorant of what was
</p>
<p>done, was so unaccountably sad, and filled with such unspeakable

</p>
<p>anguish of heart without knowing the cause, that he was con-
</p>
<p>strained to turn aside from the road and give utterance to his
</p>
<p>feelings in tears and supplications to God. Another Apostle, twelve
</p>
<p>hundred miles distant, while standing in Faneuil Hall, Boston,
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, with many others, was similarly affected, and was
</p>
<p>obliged to turn aside to hide the big tears that gushed thick and
</p>
<p>long from his eyes. Another, President of the High Priests, while
</p>
<p>in the distant state of Kentucky, in the solitude of midnight, being
</p>
<p>marvelously disquieted, God condescended to show him, in a vision,
</p>
<p>the mangled bodies of the two murdered worthies, all dripping in
</p>
<p>254 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>purple gore, who said to him, "We are murdered by a faithless state
</p>
<p>and cruel mob."
</p>
<p>Shall I attempt to describe the scene at Nauvoo on that
</p>
<p>memorable evening? If I could, surely you would weep, whatever
</p>
<p>may be your faith or skepticism, if the feelings of humanity are
</p>
<p>lodged in your bosom; all prejudice and mirth would slumber, till
</p>
<p>the eye of pity had bedewed the bier, and the heart had found relief
</p>
<p>in lamentation. Before another day dawned, the messenger bore
</p>
<p>the tidings into the afflicted city; the picket guards of the city
</p>
<p>heard the whisper of murder in silent amazement, as the messenger
</p>
<p>passed into the city. There the pale muslin signal for gathering
</p>
<p>the troops hung its drooping folds from the Temple spire (as if
</p>
<p>partaking of nature's sadness), and made tremulous utterance to
</p>
<p>the humble soldiery to muster immediately. As the dawn made the
</p>
<p>signal visible, and the bass tone of the great drum confirmed the
</p>
<p>call, fathers, husbands, and minor sons, all seized the broken frag-
</p>
<p>ment of a dodger, or a scanty bone, for the service that might be
</p>
<p>long and arduous before their return, or swallowed some thickened
</p>
<p>milk (as might be the case), and fled to the muster ground; the
</p>
<p>suspicious mother and children followed to the door and window,
</p>
<p>anxious to see the gathering hosts emerge from their watch-posts
</p>
<p>and firesides, where rest and food were scanted to the utmost endur-
</p>
<p>ance. The troops continued to arrive, and stood in martial order,
</p>
<p>with a compressed lip and a quick ear. They waited with deathly
</p>
<p>but composed silence, to hear the intelligence that mournful spirits
</p>
<p>had saddened their hearts with during the night. The speaker
</p>
<p>stood up in the midst, not of an uniform soldiery of hirelings, for
</p>
<p>they had no wages; their clothing was the workmanship of the
</p>
<p>diligent domestic  the product of wife and daughters' arduous
</p>
<p>toil ; their rations were drawn from the precarious supplies earned
</p>
<p>in the intervals between preaching to the states and nations of the
</p>
<p>earth, and watching against the intrusions and violence of mobs.
</p>
<p>The speaker announced the martyrdom of the Prophet and Patri-

<p>arch, and paused under the heavy burden of the intelligence.
</p>
<p>But here I must pause ; my pen shall touch lightly, as it must
</p>
<p>feebly, that hallowed  that solemn and ever-memorable hour ! The
</p>
<p>towering indignation ; the holy and immutable principle of retribu-
</p>
<p>tion for crime that dwells eternally in the bosom of God, insensibly
</p>
<p>impelled the right hand almost to draw the glittering sword, and
</p>
<p>feel the sharpness of the bayonet's point and its fixedness to the
</p>
<p>musket's mouth. But the well-planted principle of self-command,
</p>
<p>and also of observing the order of Heaven and the counsel of the
</p>
<p>Priesthood, soon returned the deadly steel to the scabbard; and
</p>
<p>the victorious triumph of loyalty to God, in committing evil-doers
</p>
<p>to Him that judgeth righteously, and who hath said, "Vengeance
</p>
<p>is mine, and I will repay," prevailed over the billows of passion;
</p>
<p>and in the transit of a fleeting moment the holy serenity of the
</p>
<p>soldiery, depicted by an occasional tear, showed to the angels and
</p>
<p>men that the tempest of passion was hushed, and wholly under the
</p>
<p>control of the spirit of wisdom and of God !

<p>THE SORROW AND MOURNING OF THE SAINTS 255
</p>
<p>WILFORD WOODRUFF AND BRIGHAM YOUNG
</p>
<p>WEEP OVER THE MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>By Wilford Woodruff
</p>
<p>I was sitting with Brigham Young in the depot in the city of
</p>
<p>Boston at the time when the two prophets were martyred. Of
</p>
<p>course we had no telegraphs and no fast reports as we have today
</p>
<p>to give communication over the land. During that period Brother
</p>
<p>Young was waiting there for a train of cars to go to Peterborough.
</p>
<p>Whilst sitting there we were overshadowed by a cloud of darkness
</p>
<p>and gloom as great as I ever witnessed in my life under almost any
</p>
<p>circumstances in which we were placed. Neither of us knew or
</p>
<p>understood the cause until after the report of the death of the
</p>
<p>prophets was manifested to us. Brother Brigham left ; I remained
</p>
<p>in Boston, and next day took passage for Fox Islands, a place I had
</p>
<p>visited some years before, and baptized numbers of people and
</p>
<p>organized branches upon both those islands. My father-in-law,
</p>
<p>Ezra Carter, carried me on a wagon from Scarborough to Portland.
</p>
<p>I there engaged passage on board of a steamer. I had put my trunk
</p>
<p>on board and was just bidding my father-in-law farewell, when
</p>
<p>a man came out from a shop  a shoemaker  holding a newspaper
</p>
<p>in his hand. He said, "Father Carter, Joseph and Hyrum Smith
</p>
<p>have been martyred  they have been murdered in Carthage jail!"
</p>
<p>As soon as I looked at the paper, the Spirit said to me that it
</p>
<p>was true. I had no time for consultation, the steamer's bell was
</p>
<p>ringing, so I stepped on board and took my trunk back to land. As
</p>
<p>I drew it off, the plank was drawn in. I told Father Carter to drive
</p>
<p>me back to Scarborough. I there took the car for Boston, and
</p>
<p>arrived at that place on the Saturday night. On my arrival there
</p>
<p>I received a letter which had been sent from Nauvoo, giving us an
</p>
<p>account of the killing of the prophets. I was the only man in Boston
</p>
<p>of the quorum of the Twelve.
</p>
<p>I had very strange feelings, as, I have no doubt, all the Saints
</p>
<p>had. I attended a meeting on the following day in Boydston's Hall,
</p>

</p>
<p>where a vast number of the inhabitants of Boston and some three
</p>
<p>hundred Latter-day Saints had assembled. Hundreds of men came
</p>
<p>to that meeting to see what the "Mormons" were going to do now
</p>
<p>that their prophets were dead. I felt braced up ; every nerve, bone,
</p>
<p>and sinew tvithin me seemed as though made of steel. I did not
</p>
<p>shed a tear. I went into that hall, though I knew not what I was
</p>
<p>going to say to that vast audience. I opened the Bible promiscu-
</p>
<p>ously and opened to the words of St. John where he saw under
</p>
<p>the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and
</p>
<p>heard them cry, "How long, Lord, holy and true, dost thou not
</p>
<p>judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" The
</p>
<p>Lord informed them that they must wait a little season, until their
</p>
<p>brethren were slain as they were. I spoke on those words.
</p>
<p>Next day I met Brigham Young in the streets of Boston, he
</p>
<p>having just returned, opposite to Sister Voce's home. We reached
</p>
<p>out our hands but neither of us was able to speak sl word. We
</p>
<p>walked into Sister Voce's house. We each took a seat and veiled
</p>
<p>256 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>our faces. We were overwhelmed with grief and our faces were
</p>
<p>soon bathed in a flood of tears. I felt then that I could talk, though
</p>
<p>I could not do so before  that is, to Brother Brigham. After we
</p>
<p>had done weeping we began to converse together concerning the
</p>
<p>death of the prophets. In the course of the conversation, he smote
</p>
<p>his hand upon his thigh and said: "Thank God, the keys of the
</p>
<p>kingdom are here." Millennial Star, Vol. 51, 545-47.
</p>
<p>LOCATION OF THE TWELVE AT THE TIME
</p>
<p>OF THE MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>"Brigham was away with the majority of the Twelve when
</p>
<p>the martyrdom took place. Two only were in Nauvoo; they were
</p>
<p>Willard Richards and John Taylor. Both of these were in prison
</p>
<p>with the Prophet when the assassins, with painted faces, broke into
</p>
<p>Carthage gaol, overpowered the guards and martyred the brothers
</p>
<p>Joseph and Hyrum. No pen can describe the universal shock felt
</p>
<p>among the Saints when the news burst upon them, and sped
</p>
<p>throughout the United States and Europe.
</p>
<p>Brigham Young and Orson Pratt were together at Peterboro,
</p>
<p>N. H., at the house of Brother Bemet, when a letter from Nauvoo
</p>
<p>came to a Mr. Joseph Powers, giving particulars of the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion. The rumor met them first at Salem. Awful as it was to him,
</p>
<p>the President too well realized that unless the Twelve were equal
</p>
<p>to the occasion, the Church was in danger of dissolution or a great
</p>
<p>schism. At best, the Saints must feel for a moment as sheep with-
</p>
<p>out a shepherd.
</p>
<p>"Those who have followed him in his eventful career, know
</p>
<p>that Brigham is always greatest on great occasions. He never
</p>
<p>fails in a trying hour. **** The first thing that I thought of,' says
</p>
<p>the President, 'was whether Joseph had taken the keys of the
</p>
<p>kingdom with him from the earth. Brother Orson Pratt sat on
</p>
<p>my left; we were both leaning back in our chairs. Bringing my
</p>
<p>hand down on my knee, I said, the keys of the kingdom are right
</p>
<p>here with the Church/

</p>
<p>"The President immediately started for Boston, where he held
</p>
<p>council with Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, and Wilford Woodruff,
</p>
<p>relative to their return to Nauvoo. Heber and Brigham remained
</p>
<p>there a week, awaiting the arrival of Apostle Lyman Wight. During
</p>
<p>their stay, they ordained, at one evening meeting, thirty-two elders.
</p>
<p>This act was conclusive evidence that these apostles did not intend
</p>
<p>to let the Church die.
</p>
<p>"As soon as Lyman Wight arrived, the three set out for
</p>
<p>Nauvoo, and at Albany they were joined by Orson Hyde, Orson
</p>
<p>Pratt and Wilford Woodruff."

</p>
<p>PARLEY P. PRATT IS COMFORTED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT
</p>
<p>President B. Young and most of the members of the quorum
</p>
<p>of the Twelve, were then on a mission through the Eastern States,
</p>
<p>as well as myself. While on this mission, on the 27th of June, 1844,
</p>
<p>THE SORROW AND MOURNING OF THE SAINTS 257
</p>
<p>a mob murdered the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum,
</p>
<p>in a jail at Carthage, Illinois, while Governor Ford had pledged
</p>
<p>the faith of the State for their protection.
</p>
<p>A day or two previous to this circumstance I had been con-
</p>
<p>strained by the Spirit to start prematurely for home, without
</p>
<p>knowing why or wherefore ; and on the same afternoon I was pass-
</p>
<p>ing on a canal boat near Utica, New York, on my way to Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>My brother, William Pratt, being then on a mission in the same
</p>
<p>State (New York), happened, providentially, to take passage on
</p>
<p>the same boat. As we conversed together on the deck, a strange
</p>
<p>and solemn awe came over me, as if the powers of hell were let
</p>
<p>loose. I was so overwhelmed with sorrow I could hardly speak;
</p>
<p>and after pacing the deck for some time in silence, I turned to my
</p>
<p>brother William and exclaimed: ''Brother William, this is a dark
</p>
<p>hour; the powers of darkness seem to triumph, and the spirit of
</p>
<p>murder is abroad in the land; and it controls the hearts of the
</p>
<p>American people, and a vast majority of them sanction the killing
</p>
<p>of the innocent. My brother, let us keep silence and not open our
</p>
<p>mouths. If you have any pamphlets or books on the fulness of the
</p>
<p>gospel lock them up; show them not, neither open your mouth to
</p>
<p>the people; let us observe an entire and solemn silence, for this
</p>
<p>is a dark day, and the hour of triumph for the powers of darkness.
</p>
<p>0, how sensible I am of the spirit of murder which seems to per-
</p>
<p>vade the whole land." This was June 27, 1844, in the afternoon,
</p>
<p>and as near as I can judge, it was the same hour that the Carthage
</p>
<p>mob were shedding the blood of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and
</p>
<p>John Taylor, near one thousand miles distant. My brother bid me
</p>
<p>farewell somewhere in western New York, he being on his way
</p>
<p>to a conference in that quarter, and passing on to Buffalo I took
</p>
<p>steamer for Chicago, Illinois.
</p>
<p>The steamer touched at a landing in Wisconsin, some fifty
</p>
<p>or sixty miles from Chicago, and here some new passengers came
</p>
<p>on board and brought the news of the martyrdom of Joseph and

</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith. Great excitement prevailed on board, there being
</p>
<p>a general spirit of exultation and triumph at this glorious news,
</p>
<p>as it was called, much the same as is generally shown on the first
</p>
<p>receipt of the news of a great national victory in time of war.
</p>
<p>Many passengers now gathered about me and tauntingly inquired
</p>
<p>what the Mormons would do now, seeing their Prophet and leader
</p>
<p>was killed. To these taunts and questions I replied, that they
</p>
<p>would continue their mission and spread the work he had restored,
</p>
<p>in all the world. Observing that nearly all the prophets and Apos-
</p>
<p>tles who were before him had been killed, and also the Saviour of
</p>
<p>the world, and yet their death did not alter the truth nor hinder
</p>
<p>its final triumph.
</p>
<p>At this reply many of them seemed astonished, and some
</p>
<p>inquired who would succeed him, and remarked to me : "Perhaps
</p>
<p>you will be the man who will now seek to be leader of the Mormons
</p>
<p>in his stead  who are you, sir?" I replied: "I am a man, sir; and
</p>
<p>a man never triumphs and exults in the ruin of his country and the
</p>
<p>murder of the innocent." This was said in the energy of my soul,
</p>
<p>and by constraint of the Spirit, and a powerful and peculiar accent
</p>
<p>258 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>was thrown upon the word MAN each time it occurred in the
</p>
<p>sentence. This served as a sufficient rebuke, and all were silent.
</p>
<p>Landing in Chicago I found great excitement, and the press
</p>
<p>had issued extras announcing the triumph of the murderous mob
</p>
<p>in killing the Smiths. I now hastened on to Peoria, and, staying
</p>
<p>over night, started next day on foot across the country to Nauvoo 
</p>
<p>distance 105 miles.
</p>
<p>During the two or three days I spent in traveling between
</p>
<p>Chicago and Peoria I felt so weighed down with sorrow and the
</p>
<p>powers of darkness that it was painful for me to converse or speak
</p>
<p>to any one, or even to try to eat or sleep. I really felt that if it had
</p>
<p>been my own family who had died, and our beloved Prophet been
</p>
<p>spared alive, I could have borne it, and the blow would have fallen
</p>
<p>on me with far less weight. I had loved Joseph with a warmth of
</p>
<p>affection indescribable for about fourteen years. I had associated
</p>
<p>with him in private and in public, in travels and at home, in joy
</p>
<p>and sorrow, in honor and dishonor, in adversity of every kind.
</p>
<p>With him I had triumphed over all our foes in Missouri, and found
</p>
<p>deliverance for ourselves and people in Nauvoo, where we had
</p>
<p>reared a great city. But now he was gone to the invisible world,
</p>
<p>and we and the Church of the Saints were left to mourn in sorrow
</p>
<p>and without the presence of our beloved founder and Prophet.
</p>
<p>As I walked along over the plains of Illinois, lonely and solitary,
</p>
<p>I reflected as follows : I am now drawing near to the beloved city ;
</p>
<p>in a day or two I shall be there. How shall I meet the sorrowing
</p>
<p>widows and. orphans? How shall I meet the aged and widowed
</p>
<p>mother of these two martyrs? How shall I meet an entire com-
</p>
<p>munity bowed down with grief and sorrow unutterable? What
</p>
<p>shall I say? or how console and advise twenty-five thousand people
</p>
<p>who will throng about me in tears, and in the absence of my Presi-
</p>
<p>dent and the older members of the now presiding council, will ask
</p>
<p>counsel at my hands? Shall I tell them to fly to the wilderness and
</p>
<p>deserts? Or, shall I tell them to stay at home and take care of

<p>themselves, and continue to build the Temple? With these reflec-
</p>
<p>tions and inquiries, I walked onward, weighed down as it were
</p>
<p>unto death. When I could endure it no longer, I cried out aloud,
</p>
<p>saying : Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ I pray Thee, show me
</p>
<p>what these things mean, and what I shall say to Thy people? On
</p>
<p>a sudden the Spirit of God came upon me, and filled my heart with
</p>
<p>joy and gladness indescribable; and while the spirit of revelation
</p>
<p>glowed in my bosom with as visible a warmth and gladness as if
</p>
<p>it were fire, the Spirit said unto me : "Lift up your head and rejoice ;
</p>
<p>for behold! it is well with my servants Joseph and Hyrum. My
</p>
<p>servant Joseph still holds the keys of my kingdom in this dispen-
</p>
<p>sation, and he shall stand in due time on the earth, in the flesh,
</p>
<p>and fulfil that to which he is appointed. Go and say unto my
</p>
<p>people in Nauvoo, that they shall continue to pursue their daijy
</p>
<p>duties and take care of themselves, and make no movement in
</p>
<p>Church government to reorganize or alter anything until the return
</p>
<p>of the remainder of the quorum of the Twelve. But exhort them
</p>
<p>that they continue to build the House of the Lord which I have
</p>
<p>commanded them to build in Nauvoo."
</p>
<p>THE SORROW AND MOURNING OF THE SAINTS 259
</p>
<p>This information caused my bosom to burn with joy and glad-
</p>
<p>ness, and I was comforted above measure; all my sorrow seemed
</p>
<p>in a moment to be lifted as a burden from my back. The change
</p>
<p>was so sudden I hardly dared to believe my senses. I, therefore,
</p>
<p>prayed the Lord to repeat to me the same things the second time ;
</p>
<p>if, indeed, I might be sure of their truth, and might really tell the
</p>
<p>Saints to stay in Nauvoo, and continue to build the Temple. As
</p>
<p>I prayed thus, the same spirit burned in my bosom, and the Spirit
</p>
<p>of the Lord repeated to me the same message again. I then went
</p>
<p>on my way rejoicing, and soon arrived in Nauvoo, and delivered
</p>
<p>this message both to the people and friends individually, and in
</p>
<p>the great congregation. In confirmation that the message was right,
</p>
<p>I found them already renewing their labors on the Temple, under
</p>
<p>the direction of John Taylor and Willard Richards, who were
</p>
<p>members of our quorum, and who were in jail with the prophets
</p>
<p>when they were murdered  Taylor being wounded with four
</p>
<p>bullets, and Richards escaping uninjured.

<p>THE FATEFUL NIGHT OF JUNE 27, 1844
</p>
<p>By Mrs. George A. Smith
</p>
<p>On the evening of the 27th of June such a barking and howling
</p>
<p>of dogs and bellowing of cattle all over the city of Nauvoo I never
</p>
<p>heard before or since. I was at Brother David Smith's house. I
</p>
<p>knelt down and tried to pray for the prophet, but I was struck
</p>
<p>speechless, and knew not the cause till morning, of course the
</p>
<p>awful deed was already accomplished, when the spirit refused to
</p>
<p>give me utterance to prayer the evening before. The next day the
</p>
<p>bodies were brought and conveyed to the mansion. Here I witnessed
</p>
<p>the awful scene  the Prophet and Patriarch lying in their gore
</p>
<p>and thousands of men, women, and children weeping all around.

<p>day when Joseph and Hyrum were assassinated at Carthage. It
</p>
<p>was the darkest day of my life. No scene before or since has struck
</p>
<p>such a terror to my heart. Joseph, when living, often patted my
</p>
<p>head and said, "You're a little Ephraimite. ,, How I loved that
</p>
<p>man ! And I know now even as I knew then that he was a man of
</p>
<p>God, a true prophet.

</p>
<p>HOW THE SAINTS MOURNED FOR THE PROPHET JOSEPH
</p>
<p>By Franklin D. Richards
</p>
<p>Back in the days when the Prophet Joseph was slain, and the
</p>
<p>Church was left without him here upon the earth, the whole people
</p>
<p>mourned  mourned as we have never known how to mourn since.
</p>
<p>260 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>I want to tell you Saints that felt you mourned when President
</p>
<p>Young died, when President Taylor died, or now that President
</p>
<p>Woodruff has departed from us, it is no such mourning as was felt
</p>
<p>through all Nauvoo, and among all the Saints when the Prophet
</p>
<p>and Patriarch were slain. It just seemed as if everything around
</p>
<p>us, even the animals, the trees and the habitations, were clothed
</p>
<p>in mourning. We felt his absence, because he was to us instead of
</p>
<p>God. He directed us in everything, taught us in all the great prin-
</p>
<p>ciples that pertain to our salvation and exaltation throughout all
</p>
<p>this mortal existence and clear into the eternities. Anybody that
</p>
<p>has the spirit of revelation, and who will read the last revelation
</p>
<p>that he gave us, cannot help but wonder and admire, and compre-
</p>
<p>hend something of the great mind and capacity of soul that he had
</p>
<p>acquired during his short experience, in the gospel, of twenty-four
</p>
<p>years here in the flesh.
</p>
<p>Now, when he was taken away, it was the first great and
</p>
<p>terrible experience in that line, and there was no rule left when
</p>
<p>the church organization should be perfected. Let me cite you to
</p>
<p>a few facts in connection with this. When that event occurred,
</p>
<p>the apostles were all away throughout the United States, on mis-
</p>
<p>sions, except John Taylor and Willard Richards. They were in
</p>
<p>prison with the Prophet Joseph. President Taylor was shot nearly
</p>
<p>to pieces, so that he had like to have died, according to all human
</p>
<p>appearance. Willard just lost a drop of blood from one of his ears ;
</p>
<p>a ball whistled so near that it broke his skin and let a drop of
</p>
<p>blood mingle with the others. The Prophet Brigham was in Boston,
</p>
<p>with Apostle Woodruff. It was a sad and sorrowful time. Immed-
</p>
<p>iately the Prophet Joseph was slain, one man and another, and
</p>
<p>another, who had been taught by him to comprehend some great
</p>
<p>principles of the Gospel, came to feel so important that one man
</p>
<p>said, since Joseph was dead there was no man living to whom he
</p>
<p>owed allegiance. He, therefore, in the greatness of his self-impor-
</p>
<p>tance, gathered up his family, with a few others, and went away

</p>
<p>to Texas. Lyman Wight was this man, whose cognomen among
</p>
<p>the twelve was "the wild ram of the mountain." By and by one of
</p>
<p>his sons returned to us. Another man, Alpheus Cutler, in the
</p>
<p>greatness of his experience and self-sufficiency, took his family
</p>
<p>and some friends and went to a northern state, making a camp of
</p>
<p>his own, ready to build up a city, a people, a nation, and become
</p>
<p>a prophet. George Miller, one of the presiding bishops, also started,
</p>
<p>with a few and went off among the Pancho Indians. Another one,
</p>
<p>James J. Strang, who thought he had the thing fixed so it had
</p>
<p>come to stay, went off with a few to Beaver Island, in Lake Mich-
</p>
<p>igan, and carried on his operations for a while, till, by and by, one
</p>
<p>of his followers sickened of him and assassinated him. This is the
</p>
<p>way these great men, w r ho thought they were somebody, have gone
</p>
<p>in the strength of their own endowments, feeling themselves as
</p>
<p>great as Joseph the Prophet. How was it, when the Prophet Brig-
</p>
<p>ham came back to Nauvoo, that he realized that the powders of the
</p>
<p>priesthood and the keys thereof had come down upon him? He
</p>
<p>went and stood in his place. Sidney Rigdon w 7 anted to become a
</p>
<p>"guardian" to the church, to guide and lead them till they should
</p>
<p>THE SORROW AND MOURNING OF THE SAINTS 261
</p>
<p>see Joseph again. And thus, one after another, these different influ-
</p>
<p>ences wrought. About this time, too, to fill up the cup and make it
</p>
<p>run over, and to accomplish the wickedness of the world, a mob
</p>
<p>got around and forced the twelve, when they got back to Nauvoo,
</p>
<p>to enter into an agreement with them that they and the people
</p>
<p>would get up and leave the country. This they did. They made
</p>
<p>their arrangements, and, as quick as we could finish the temple
</p>
<p>and get the blessings of the Lord upon us, the Saints started out
</p>
<p>into the wilderness to find a country as far from civilization as they
</p>
<p>could.
</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph had a feeling or a premonition of what
</p>
<p>might be, and we find it on the record of his history that he felt
</p>
<p>forebodings that he might not stay to see that temple completed.
</p>
<p>He took the twelve aside  those who were faithful  and he gave
</p>
<p>them their endowments in a holy place, in a new building that he
</p>
<p>consecrated for that purpose. He placed upon them the keys, author-
</p>
<p>ity and powers which the Lord and the angels had conferred upon
</p>
<p>him. You recollect that John the Baptist came and ordained Joseph
</p>
<p>and Oliver to the Aaronic Priesthood. Peter, James and John came
</p>
<p>and ordained him and Oliver unto the Melchizedek Priesthood 
</p>
<p>the holy apostleship. In the temple at Kirtland, Moses, Elias and
</p>
<p>Elijah appeared and conferred upon him the keys of the gathering
</p>
<p>of Israel, of the Gospel of Abraham, and of the turning of the
</p>
<p>hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to their
</p>
<p>fathers. Joseph called the brethren aside and placed all these keys,
</p>
<p>powers and blessings that he had received upon them. You have
</p>
<p>heard President Woodruff testify of this, and of the great work and
</p>
<p>marvelous power thereof. Well, these things bestowed upon the
</p>
<p>brethren caused some men to become headstrong, and in view of
</p>
<p>what they knew, they thought they could build up the church unto
</p>
<p>God, build up the kingdom of God, and stand at the head of it
</p>
<p>themselves.
</p>
<p>While this was going on the powers of the priesthood rested

</p>
<p>down upon the Twelve Apostles, and President Young always
</p>
<p>took pains to have a majority of them within reach, where he could
</p>
<p>arrange for any decisions that he found it necessary to make. He
</p>
<p>had a great vision, in which Joseph said to us, through him : "Get
</p>
<p>the holy spirit and keep it." That is a great injunction that is upon
</p>
<p>us all. If we want to go where these men are, we must get the
</p>
<p>holy spirit and walk in the light of it. After he and the pioneers
</p>
<p>had been out here and had found this place for us to come and live
</p>
<p>in, and then went back to the Mississippi river, in Winter Quarters,
</p>
<p>the spirit of the Lord, the revelation of the Lord, came upon him.
</p>
<p>It was about two years and a half, on that occasion, that the Church
</p>
<p>had been without a first presidency, till the Lord made manifest
</p>
<p>to them in Winter Quarters, about December, 1847, that the organi-
</p>
<p>zation should be completed. There being no good place for it, they
</p>
<p>picked out men and set them to work to build a tabernacle in
</p>
<p>Kanesville for the conference. At that conference the first presi-
</p>
<p>dency was accepted, and, according to the dictation of the revela-
</p>
<p>tion, they, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards,
</p>
<p>were upheld by the unanimous consent and voice and prayers of
</p>
<p>262 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>God's people. Thus the first great calamity to the Church was
</p>
<p>remedied, and the fullness of the presidency was again restored.

<p>MEMORIES OF AURELIA S. ROGERS
</p>
<p>"It is generally known that our enemies seeing the prosperity
</p>
<p>of the Saints began to hunt up excuses for serving writs on the
</p>
<p>leading members of the Church; and that this was the cause of
</p>
<p>some of the brethren going to prison, while others hid themselves
</p>
<p>to keep out of their enemies' way, similar to what they have been
</p>
<p>doing of late years, with this difference, polygamy was not the
</p>
<p>offense at that time, but hatred toward the Prophet because of
</p>
<p>the religion the Lord had revealed to him. This persecution lasted
</p>
<p>until the massacre of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, after which there
</p>
<p>was comparative peace for over a year.
</p>
<p>"Well do I remember the morning after the martyrdom of those
</p>
<p>noble men. A gloom was cast over the whole city of Nauvoo, men,
</p>
<p>women and children wept for their departed Prophet and Patri-
</p>
<p>arch. I witnessed the long procession that followed the bodies of
</p>
<p>our beloved leaders as they were taken to Joseph's Mansion, where
</p>
<p>they laid in state until the people could take a last look at them
</p>
<p>and say farewell. My father lifted me thru one of the windows
</p>
<p>of the Mansion as the doorways were thronged with people, when
</p>
<p>after viewing the bodies I was passed again and taken home."

<p>THE SORROW AND GLOOM ON THE DAY OF
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>By Louisa Barnes Pratt
</p>
<p>In the spring of '44, I took up a school in my own house. It
</p>
<p>was attended with great difficulty, and confusion, being a crowded
</p>
<p>school in a small room. But it brought me in a little. There were
</p>
<p>continual hostilities in Nauvoo from either one source or another.
</p>
<p>Brother Joseph Smith went with his wife to Dixon, an adjoining
</p>
<p>county, to visit his wife's relatives. Officers from Missouri were

</p>
<p>lying in wait to kidnap and take him across the river, for which
</p>
<p>they were to receive a reward. They started with him, called at
</p>
<p>a public house for the night, ivhen he made signs to the landlord
</p>
<p>that he ivas a free mason. He was immediately taken out of their
</p>
<p>custody, the two men were arrested for assault and battery, and
</p>
<p>brought to Nauvoo in chains. There was great excitement when it
</p>
<p>was reported that the Prophet was returning, bringing his enemies
</p>
<p>as prisoners. Lawyer Dixon attended Mr. Smith on his w r ay home ;
</p>
<p>and addressed a crowded assembly in his behalf, while the two
</p>
<p>prisoners were sitting by his side on the stand. After the exercises,
</p>
<p>which were exciting in the extreme, Mr. Smith invited, or rather,
</p>
<p>conveyed the prisoners to his house, took off their shackles, seated
</p>
<p>them at his table with his wife and mother, treated them as friends
</p>
<p>instead of enemies. He gave them their liberty. They went to
</p>
<p>THE SORROW AND MOURNING OF THE SAINTS 263
</p>
<p>Carthage and cursed their bad luck in not getting their prey across
</p>
<p>the river and receiving their booty, so little did unmerited kind-
</p>
<p>ness humble their proud hearts.
</p>
<p>It was eventually announced that the government of the state
</p>
<p>had taken up arms against the citizens of Nauvoo; and Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith was summoned to Carthage to be tried for treason. The
</p>
<p>governor pledged the faith of the state that he should have a fair
</p>
<p>and impartial trial. He at first seemed unwilling to go, but being
</p>
<p>urged by some who had more confidence in the governor's promise,
</p>
<p>he consented. He was heard to say as he rode on the way: "I am
</p>
<p>going like a lamb to the slaughter, henceforth it will be said of
</p>
<p>me, 'He was murdered in cold blood.' " On the morning preceding
</p>
<p>the murder, the governor rode into Nauvoo with troops, made a
</p>
<p>speech to the people, in which he railed them in a sarcastic manner
</p>
<p>for carrying arms.
</p>
<p>While the governor was speaking, the report of guns was heard
</p>
<p>from Carthage. He was in bold terms affirming that Gen. Smith's
</p>
<p>going to Carthage, according to demand, had saved the city from
</p>
<p>being burned and the women and children from being put to the
</p>
<p>sword and perishing by it. The moment the guns were heard, he
</p>
<p>dismissed the assembly abruptly, jumped on his horse and rode
</p>
<p>away, as if fearing the people would divine the import and he would
</p>
<p>be in danger in spite of his troops. He continued his journey, not
</p>
<p>even stopping in Carthage to witness the bloody deed committed ;
</p>
<p>not halting till he had gone twenty-five miles beyond that place.
</p>
<p>The brethren went with great speed to the spot, anticipating the
</p>
<p>tragedy. The citizens were greatly terrified, supposing the exasper-
</p>
<p>ated Mormons would burn the town, but so intense was their
</p>
<p>sorrow, revenge found no place in their hearts. Dumb with anguish,
</p>
<p>even to profound silence, they laid the dead bodies of the two noble
</p>
<p>martyrs in a wagon and drove solemnly towards the city where
</p>
<p>thousands were watching in breathless sorrow for their return.
</p>
<p>Such consternation ivas never known since tine rocks were

<p>rent, and the sun darkened, when Christ the Lamb ivas slain!
</p>
<p>Had the sun and moon fallen from their orbits and left the world in
</p>
<p>total darkness, it would not have betokened a more irretrievable
</p>
<p>de spoliation! I thought the Church was ruined forever! I rushed
</p>
<p>into my garden when the news ivas confirmed and poured out my
</p>
<p>soul in such bitterness as I had never felt before. The inconceivable
</p>
<p>cruelty of our enemies!
</p>
<p>This was the 28th of June, 1844. At dusk a report came that
</p>
<p>a thousand dollar reward was offered for the head of the Prophet,
</p>
<p>and that the mob was at Warsaw, coming across the river! The
</p>
<p>Legion was called out in the night. Such a tramping of horses was
</p>
<p>heard, the bass drum beat with astonishing loudness, every blow
</p>
<p>seemed to strike on my heart, and did really inflict pain, so dread-
</p>
<p>ful was my fear. It was a still night, and the moon was at the full.
</p>
<p>A night of death it seemed, and everything conspired to make it
</p>
<p>solemn! The voices of the officers were heard calling the men
</p>
<p>together and coming in the distance made it fall on the heart like a
</p>
<p>funeral knell. The women were assembled in groups, weeping and
</p>
<p>264 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>praying, some wishing terrible punishment on the murderers;
</p>
<p>others acknowledging the hand of God in the event.
</p>
<p>I could feel no anger or resentment. I felt the deepest humility
</p>
<p>before God. I thought continually of his words : "Be still and know
</p>
<p>that I am God." My children clung to me with great fear. They
</p>
<p>heard talk of hiding them in case the mob should come in. The
</p>
<p>question arose, where could we hide them? A deep cellar was
</p>
<p>suggested, a trap door and carpet overspread. They shuddered at
</p>
<p>the thought of being concealed in such a place. We concluded to
</p>
<p>take our chances together and trust in the Lord. I went to bed, but
</p>
<p>not to sleep. I could hear the men on parade; my whole system
</p>
<p>was in agitation. I arose in the morning with great prostration
</p>
<p>and walked my room to and fro.
</p>
<p>Later I awakened the children, told them to dress and we
</p>
<p>would go and see the bodies of our dead leaders. It was the day
</p>
<p>appointed, and to appearance all the world was there ! The Saints
</p>
<p>had assembled from the settlements abroad through the country.
</p>
<p>The coffins were placed in a long hall in the Mansion House, a door
</p>
<p>at each end. The multitude was required to pass through, looking
</p>
<p>at the corpses as they passed. This occupied the time from early
</p>
<p>sunrise till dusky evening. The features of Joseph Smith looked
</p>
<p>natural, but those of Hyrum were terribly marred and disfigured.
</p>
<p>My second daughter trembled exceedingly at sight of him. I
</p>
<p>regretted having brought her there to witness the spectacle. The
</p>
<p>elder one grieved as we all did, but betrayed less excitement. The
</p>
<p>bodies were conveyed, whither we knew not.
</p>
<p>When the solemn event took place, the Twelve Apostles were
</p>
<p>nearly all absent. They soon returned, and we were all anxiety to
</p>
<p>know what they would say. President Brigham Young spoke words
</p>
<p>which pierced my heart like a dagger ! Said he, "Had I been here,
</p>
<p>Joseph should not have gone to Carthage !" The bare idea that
</p>
<p>any one, or many, had been in fault was terrible to me. Had Joseph
</p>
<p>given the command, every man, woman and child would have

<p>stood in his defense, even to the loss of their own lives. Afterwards
</p>
<p>brother Willard Richards rehearsed what transpired at Carthage
</p>
<p>jail. He said everything to console the people; what it was to
</p>
<p>accomplish a purpose in the Almighty as disposer of events; re-
</p>
<p>ferred to many remarks of the Prophet Joseph during his confine-
</p>
<p>ment, showing that he was aware of his approaching dissolution;
</p>
<p>of the hymns they sang in prison, and how calm he was.
</p>
<p>From that hour I watched for words of comfort, and drank
</p>
<p>them in as I would an antidote to relieve pain. The enemies stood
</p>
<p>afar off and wondered; seemed waiting to see if the saints would
</p>
<p>seek to revenge the wrongs done them. When they found it was
</p>
<p>not the design of the injured, they again began their aggressions.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the work on the Temple rolled on with astonishing
</p>
<p>rapidity. Everyone seemed inspired with renewed vigor and deter-
</p>
<p>mination to have the Lord's house completed, and their blessings
</p>
<p>received, before being compelled to leave the place which was soon
</p>
<p>anticipated after the tragedy.
</p>
<p>There was no lack of evidence in regard to the perpetrators
</p>
<p>of the bloody deed. I was intimately acquainted with one Miss

</p>
<p>Graham, a truthful, amiable girl who was living with an aunt of
</p>
<p>hers in Warsaw at the time. She testified that the mobbers ate
</p>
<p>supper at the Hotel where she lived that night on their return
</p>
<p>from the scene of action, and that she heard certain individuals,
</p>
<p>calling them by name, boast of their conquest, killing prisoners in
</p>
<p>jail. One says: "It was my rifle that did the deed;" another, "It
</p>
<p>was mine." And thus they exulted in the committal of as black-
</p>
<p>hearted a crime as ever stained the annals of history! Was the
</p>
<p>testimony heeded by the judges? It was not.

<p>THE LORD PROTECTED THE SAINTS IN NAUVOO
</p>
<p>From the Diary of Electa C. Williams
</p>
<p>September 1, 1943
</p>
<p>The night after Joseph and Hyrum were killed, the mob went
</p>
<p>to Golden Point to set fire to the city of Nauvoo, and burn the bodies
</p>
<p>of those martyred. Brother Andrus returned home. He was taken
</p>
<p>sick while away. All the family were on guard, my husband with
</p>
<p>the rest. The bass drums were to be beat if any thing alarming
</p>
<p>should occur before midnight. We heard from the men, saying:
</p>
<p>"Run, the mob are upon us." The drums were beating violently.
</p>
<p>The dogs began barking and the cattle looking in every direction.
</p>
<p>What a night with flashing and vivid lightning and distant thunder
</p>
<p>in the heavens. Above us we discovered a small cloud. It followed
</p>
<p>the Mississippi, kept spreading as if to gather the whole waters of
</p>
<p>that noble river. The mob were marching onward to their destined
</p>
<p>point of slaughter when the rain began pouring, destroying their
</p>
<p>ammunition, drenching them to the skin, and killing some of them.
</p>
<p>The mob was glad to retreat. Thus the Lord on that day fought the
</p>
<p>battle of the Saints, never to be forgotten by those who were an
</p>
<p>eye witness of such a scene. The Lord has promised to fight the
</p>
<p>battles of his people.

</p>
<p>On the 20th of June Brother Joseph sent word to all the apos-
</p>
<p>tles to return home immediately ; and on the 24th he, with seventeen
</p>
<p>others, went to Carthage. At this time I was living at Big Mound,
</p>
<p>an English settlement about eight miles from Nauvoo, and there,
</p>
<p>while engaged in putting in sod corn I heard of the Prophet's and
</p>
<p>Hyrum's death. The next morning I started to Carthage with those
</p>
<p>who went after the bodies. We met them on the road, Dr. Richards
</p>
<p>having dressed the wounds of John Taylor and started for Nauvoo
</p>
<p>with Joseph's and Hyrum's bodies.
</p>
<p>The wailing of the Saints when they saw the martyrs was
</p>
<p>terrible. Ten thousand people were addressed by Apostle Richards,
</p>
<p>who admonished them to keep the peace and trust to the law for a
</p>
<p>remedy for the awful crimes which had been committed, and if the
</p>
<p>law failed, to call upon God in heaven to avenge us of our wrongs.
</p>
<p>The bodies were placed in coffins, the funeral was held, while deep
</p>
<p>grief filled our hearts and sorrow rested heavily upon us  a stricken
</p>
<p>266 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>people. The woe of the Saints cannot be described. Our Prophet
</p>
<p>and Patriarch dead, only two of the apostles with us and one of
</p>
<p>them supposed to be dying, and all this time we were in constant
</p>
<p>expectation of an attack by the mob army.
</p>
<p>Our enemies were sure now that they had destroyed the gospel
</p>
<p>work, but it still lives and will live, for it is the eternal work of
</p>
<p>God, and I here bear my testimony that I know that Joseph Smith,
</p>
<p>who established it, was a Prophet holy and pure.
</p>
<p>Like sheep without a shepherd, we felt lost and bewildered,
</p>
<p>and seriously we discussed the question: "Who was highest in
</p>
<p>authority? Who held the keys of the kingdom ?" On August 6th
</p>
<p>the apostles arrived from the East, while we were still uncertain
</p>
<p>about choosing a guardian of the Church and it was a great relief
</p>
<p>to greet them among us. A council of the priesthood was called and
</p>
<p>it was not long before, with the Twelve at the head, we felt that
</p>
<p>all things would be managed and directed aright. In the person of
</p>
<p>the President of the Twelve, Brigham Young, we knew that a great
</p>
<p>character had arisen, to build upon the foundation laid by Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, a kingdom whose equal "there never was in the world."
</p>
<p>Now feeling at peace, we pursued our usual work : the work on the
</p>
<p>Temple was pushed forward as rapidly as possible.
</p>
<p>Life of Christopher Layton, pp. 20-22.
</p>
<p>THE POWERS OF DARKNESS PREVAILED
</p>
<p>The death of Joseph and Hyrum was a dreadful blow to the
</p>
<p>people. They had felt towards Joseph as we imagine the disciples
</p>
<p>of Jesus, when he was upon the earth, felt towards him. You
</p>
<p>recollect that when the Savior was crucified two of them said : "We
</p>
<p>trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel."
</p>
<p>They had expected Joseph would live to lead the people until Zion
</p>
<p>should be redeemed. They were fully aware of the hatred of the
</p>
<p>mob, of the blood-thirsty disposition which Joseph's enemies had
</p>
<p>towards him; but he had escaped so many times from their traps
</p>
<p>that they hoped he would escape again as he had in times past.

</p>
<p>They knew his innocence of every charge brought against him, and
</p>
<p>they had confidence that no court could, with the least degree of
</p>
<p>fairness, convict him of any wrong doing. The thought of his being
</p>
<p>killed by his enemies had not entered into the minds of the majority
</p>
<p>of the people, the news of his death, therefore, fell upon them with
</p>
<p>stunning and overwhelming effect, and they were almost crushed
</p>
<p>by the dreadful intelligence. Oh, how dark and gloomy was that
</p>
<p>day at Nauvoo. The night after the murder, and before the word
</p>
<p>had come from Carthage, was one of horror to many. Numbers
</p>
<p>arose from sleepless couches to go forth and relate to their neigh-
</p>
<p>bor the singular feelings they had through the night. But when
</p>
<p>they emerged from their dwellings and heard the dreadful tidings
</p>
<p>that Joseph and Hyrum had been slain, that John Taylor had been
</p>
<p>desperately wounded and Willard Richards had barely escaped, the
</p>
<p>cheeks of all were blanched, and the breath suspended, as they
</p>
<p>listened to the tale of horror. It was too horrible to believe that
</p>
<p>lives of such purity had been quenched in blood. The wailings and
</p>
<p>lamentations of the whole people ascended to heaven on that day.
</p>
<p>THE SORROW AND MOURNING OF THE SAINTS 267
</p>
<p>On the day of the murder of the Prophet and Patriarch, those
</p>
<p>of the Twelve Apostles who were on missions, as well as other
</p>
<p>elders, had warnings that something dreadful had happened. They
</p>
<p>felt cast down and a spell of horror seemed to rest upon them.
</p>
<p>Some wept without knowing why they should do so, except that they
</p>
<p>were filled with unaccountable sadness and gloom. The succeeding
</p>
<p>night was a miserable one to them. When they received the news
</p>
<p>of the death of Joseph and Hyrum the cause of these feelings was
</p>
<p>explained, though it was difficult then for several of them to believe
</p>
<p>that they were dead.

</p>
<p>I LONG FOR MY REST, SAID THE PROPHET
</p>
<p>By Benjamin F. Johnson
</p>
<p>"Oh! I am so tired  so tired that I often feel to long for my
</p>
<p>day of rest. For what has there been in this life but tribulation for
</p>
<p>me? From a boy I have been persecuted by my enemies, and now
</p>
<p>even my friends are beginning to join them, to hate and persecute
</p>
<p>me ! Why should I not wish for my time of rest?"
</p>
<p>His words to me were ominous, and they brought a shadow as
</p>
<p>of death over my spirit, and I said: "Oh, Joseph! how could you
</p>
<p>think of leaving us? How as a people could we do without you?" He
</p>
<p>saw my feelings were sorrowful and said kindly* "Bennie, if I were
</p>
<p>on the other side of the veil I could do many times more for my
</p>
<p>friends than I can do while I am with them here." But the iron
</p>
<p>had gone into my soul, and I felt that in his words there was a
</p>
<p>meaning that boded sorrow, and I could not forget them.****
</p>
<p>After returning to Macedonia I saw no more of Brothers
</p>
<p>Joseph and Hyrum, but learned early on June 28th of their assas-
</p>
<p>sination. To attempt to delineate the feelings of woe and unutter-
</p>
<p>able sorrow that swelled every heart too full for tears, I need not
</p>
<p>attempt. I stood up, dazed with grief, could groan but could not
</p>
<p>weep. The fountain of tears was dry! "Oh, God! what will thy
</p>
<p>orphan church and people now do !" was the only feeling or thought

</p>
<p>that now burst out in groans.
</p>
<p>I did not go to see their mutilated bodies. I had no wish to
</p>
<p>look into their grave ; I knew they were- not there, and the words
</p>
<p>of Brother Joseph began to come back to me : "I could do so much
</p>
<p>more for my friends if I were on the other side of the veil." These
</p>
<p>words  "my friends"  oh, how glad that he was my friend. These
</p>
<p>thoughts gradually gained the empire in my heart, and I began to
</p>
<p>realize that in his martyrdom there was a great eternal purpose
</p>
<p>in the heavens. But we were not able, as yet, to comprehend such
</p>
<p>a necessity. I could begin now to feel just what he meant, and his
</p>
<p>words, "do for my friends" to me, were like the promise of Jesus
</p>
<p>to provide mansions for his disciples that they might be with him
</p>
<p>always. These things now were my consolation, and when I could
</p>
<p>begin to rejoice in them, the fountains of my tears began to flow,
</p>
<p>and I grew in consolation from day to day.

<p>The Identity and Trial of the Murderers
</p>
<p>AFFIDAVIT OF WILLIAM M. DANIELS
</p>
<p>State of Illinois,
</p>
<p>;!
</p>
<p>Hancock County, I ss *
</p>
<p>On the 4th day of July, 1844, came William M. Daniels before
</p>
<p>me, Aaron Johnson, a justice of the peace within and for said coun-
</p>
<p>ty, and after being duly sworn, deposeth and saith that on Saturday,
</p>
<p>the 22nd day of June, 1844, he came to the town of Warsaw, in said
</p>
<p>county of Hancock, and continued there until the Thursday follow-
</p>
<p>ing, the 27th day of June ; that on that morning your affiant joined
</p>
<p>the rifle company commanded by Jacob Davis ; that the lieutenant
</p>
<p>and Chittenden, Esq., said that as the governor would
</p>
<p>be absent from Carthage that day, that they would send ten men
</p>
<p>from each of the two companies to join the Carthage Greys, and
</p>
<p>kill the two Generals Smith, and if the governor opposed, to kill
</p>
<p>him too; that among those twenty men were Mr. Houck, a tailor,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Stephens, a cooper ; the rest of the two companies marched
</p>
<p>towards Golden's Point to the railroad crossing, when they were
</p>
<p>met by the governor's order to disband all the troops, and Colonel
</p>
<p>Williams disbanded them.
</p>
<p>That then the captains called them to order, saying they had
</p>
<p>no command over them, but wished them to form in line, which
</p>
<p>they did; that then Mr. Sharp, the editor of the Warsatv Signal,
</p>
<p>urged by a speech the necessity of killing the two Smiths, and a vote
</p>
<p>was then called who would go and do it.
</p>
<p>Captain Davis and about twenty men went home, the residue,
</p>
<p>eighty-four men, went to Carthage, having six runners ahead to
</p>
<p>stop the twenty men who had before started for Carthage.
</p>
<p>Soon after they started, one of the Carthage Greys met them
</p>
<p>with a letter, saying it was a most delightful time, the governor
</p>
<p>had gone, they could now kill Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and must
</p>
<p>do it quick before the governor returned ; that they then turned to

</p>
<p>again by your affiant till they arrived at the jail in Carthage; that
</p>
<p>among the names of those who committed the murder at the jail
</p>
<p>in Carthage, Hancock county aforesaid, on the 27th day of June,
</p>
<p>1844, at about 5 o'clock and 20 minutes, was Colonel Levi Williams,
</p>
<p>of Green Plains precinct, Captain Wires, Chittenden,

<p>Esq., of Warsaw. Houck, the tailor, Captain Grovenor,
</p>
<p>three brothers by the name of Stephens, coopers, Allen,
</p>
<p>a cooper, all of Warsaw, and a man by the name of Mills, who was
</p>
<p>wounded in the right arm.
</p>
<p>That your affiant would further state that this company before

<p>who came to meet said company in the morning.
</p>
<p>That your said affiant saw Joseph Smith leap from the win-

<p>dow of the jail, and that one of the company picked him up and
</p>
<p>placed him against the well curb, and several shot him, Colonel

<p>further your affiant saith not. [Signed] William M. Daniels.

<p>The foregoing is a pretty large list; there are others of the smaller fry

<p>which I deem unworthy of notice, inasmuch as they were led on through the

<p>influence of the leaders, and whiskey. I most cheerfully give you any informa-
</p>
<p>tion in my power in reference to this matter; the only thing that I regret
</p>
<p>about is, that these things I am fearful will be put off so long that I will not
</p>
<p>live to see or hear of the awful vengeance which will in the end overtake
</p>
<p>the Hancock assassins. I have long been of the opinion that forbearance is
</p>
<p>no longer a virtue, let the guilty be made to answer for their crimes. Let
</p>
<p>justice be done, and all will be well.
</p>
<p>The bloodhounds are still determined on taking my life; I can hear from
</p>
<p>them every once in a while. I will have to be exceedingly careful this sum-
</p>
<p>mer, or they will have my scalp. They still act upon the principle that had
</p>
<p>it not been for me in September last, Worrell and McBradney would not have
</p>
<p>been killed, and the city of Nauvoo burned to the ground. They want to hold

<p>me responsible for everything that was done to put them down in their mob

<p>doings last year.

<p>EVERY STATE OF THE UNION WAS REPRESENTED
</p>
<p>IN THE MOB
</p>
<p>By Brigham Young
</p>
<p>The mob that collected at Carthage, Illinois, to commit that
</p>
<p>deed of blood contained a delegation representing every State in
</p>
<p>the Union. Each has received its blood stain. In the perpetration
</p>
<p>of this great national sin, they acted upon their own free volition
</p>
<p>which God implanted within them, as much so as if they had been
</p>
<p>willing to hearken to the advice of the Prophet and his friends
</p>
<p>when they showed them how to preserve the nation from destruc-
</p>
<p>tion, how to do good to all, and how to introduce every holy prin-
</p>
<p>ciple that is calculated to bless and exalt a people. But, said they,
</p>
<p>"We will not hearken to the counsels of this man;" for, like the
</p>
<p>Jews of old, they were afraid if they let him live he would take
</p>
<p>away their place and nation. They not only feared the principles
</p>
<p>which he taught, but they feared the increasing numbers which
</p>
<p>followed him; they feared that if they let him alone he would in-
</p>
<p>corporate in his religion all the religion there is that is good for
</p>
<p>anything, or that is according to the Bible, and all the honest,
</p>
<p>truthful and virtuous of the nation, they feared, would follow him ;
</p>
<p>272 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>and they feared that thereby they would be deprived of their rich
</p>
<p>emoluments and livings, so they concluded to get rid of him by
</p>
<p>slaying him. * * * If they had hearkened to the counsel of Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, this nation would have had no wars; there would have
</p>
<p>been no division in the Government, but it would have gone on in
</p>
<p>harmony and prosperity. j.d. 12: 121.

<p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE TRIAL
</p>
<p>Letter written to Josiah Lamborn, Attorney General of Illinois
</p>
<p>Review of difficulties attendant upon collection of evidence for the
</p>
<p>prospective trial of those charged with the murder of the Prophet and
</p>
<p>Patriarch Joseph and Hyrum Smith.
</p>
<p>Sir : We are this evening informed by Mr. Scott that it is your
</p>
<p>wish as prosecuting attorney vs. the murderers of the Generals
</p>
<p>Smith that the Mormons should hunt up the witnesses in the case,
</p>
<p>and that Mr. Murray McConnell had conveyed the idea that there
</p>
<p>was a committee in the county whose business it was to collect and
</p>
<p>arrange the testimony against the day of trial and that said com-
</p>
<p>mittee are supposed to be Mormons, etc. etc.
</p>
<p>Now, Sir, in behalf of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
</p>
<p>Saints ; or, if you choose, the Mormon fraternity, we beg leave to
</p>
<p>state to you, what has been often reiterated by us, and which is a
</p>
<p>well known fact, both to our people and the state, viz: that the
</p>
<p>difficulty causing the pending trials is not between the Mormons
</p>
<p>and anti-Mormons; nor between the Mormons and the murderers;
</p>
<p>but it is between the state and the prisoners or offenders.
</p>
<p>The facts are, the Messrs. Smiths were murdered while in the
</p>
<p>charge of the state, relying on the plighted faith of the state for
</p>
<p>protection, and not in the presence of Mormon witnesses, for the
</p>
<p>Mormons were not there, but doubtless in the presence of many
</p>
<p>who were not Mormons.
</p>
<p>To show our loyalty to the institutions of our country and
</p>
<p>preserve peace in the country, as a people, we pledged ourselves to
</p>
<p>abide the operations of the law as directed by the proper authori-

</p>
<p>ties of the commonwealth; and that we would abide the decisions
</p>
<p>of the court, not taking vengeance into our own hands, (as was
</p>
<p>then feared by some) or commencing prosecutions, to which we
</p>
<p>have strictly adhered, and intend still to adhere, that our pledge
</p>
<p>may be honorably redeemed in the sight of all men, although we
</p>
<p>have been strongly solicited to enter the field of prosecution, and
</p>
<p>that, too, by the state or her agents: for instance when Mr. Mc-
</p>
<p>Connell was engaged in preparation for the prosecution he came
</p>
<p>to Nauvoo and strongly solicited the Mormons to come out as com-
</p>
<p>plainants and assist in procuring witnesses, etc.; but we replied
</p>
<p>that we had had nothing to do with the affair, and wanted nothing
</p>
<p>to do with it; and for us to enlist in attempting to bring the mur-
</p>
<p>derers to justice, no matter how legal in our movements, it would
</p>
<p>be construed into a persecution, or a desire to pick a quarrel on our
</p>
<p>part, which we were and still are determined to avoid, even every
</p>
<p>appearance of evil, and cut off every occasion of our enemies, or
</p>
<p>of those who are ready to seize upon any pretext to make us trouble.
</p>
<p>THE IDENTITY AND TRIAL OF THE MURDERERS 273
</p>
<p>We are decidedly for peace, and we ever have been and as the
</p>
<p>murders were committed while the murdered were in immediate
</p>
<p>charge of the state, all we ask is, that the state will prosecute the
</p>
<p>case to final judgment, and redeem her pledge, as we have ours;
</p>
<p>or if she choose to abandon the prosecution we shall submit peace-
</p>
<p>ably ; although, for public good, we would prefer that justice should
</p>
<p>take place.
</p>
<p>We are unacquainted with the statute which suffers indicted
</p>
<p>murderers to roam at large month after month without arrest ; or,
</p>
<p>after delivery, or surrender, to run at pleasure before trial, and
</p>
<p>we know not what other similar laws we might come in contact
</p>
<p>with, and be liable to break to our own endangering or disadvantage,
</p>
<p>should we attempt to have anything to do with the case in question.
</p>
<p>It is reported to us, true or false we know not, that the sheriff
</p>
<p>of Hancock county and his deputies have been forbidden by the
</p>
<p>court to act in pending trials, and that the jurors have been dis-
</p>
<p>charged without impaneling. If this be true we are unacquainted
</p>
<p>with the statutes in the case and have nothing to say.
</p>
<p>When Mr. McConnell was here last fall, at his earnest solici-
</p>
<p>tation, we collected all the information in our possession and pre-
</p>
<p>sented the same to him, supposing he would prosecute the case to
</p>
<p>final judgment. He took minutes at the time and probably has them
</p>
<p>now, if he has not handed them over, of which you must be ac-
</p>
<p>quainted, better than we, and of which we did not preserve min-
</p>
<p>utes: we know of no new information since that period.
</p>
<p>We were happy to hear that the trials had been committed to
</p>
<p>your able charge, and anticipated that you would have made us a
</p>
<p>visit before the sitting of the court; and we still anticipate that
</p>
<p>after court you will make us a visit, that we may have the pleasure
</p>
<p>of a more general acquaintance among our citizens; and we feel
</p>
<p>confident that such a visit would be highly appreciated by our
</p>
<p>friend, General Young, with whom we understand you are ac-
</p>
<p>quainted.

<p>To Thos. H. Owen.
</p>
<p>Sir,  I am sorry that there has been delay which caused your
</p>
<p>letter to arrive so late to hand, and I feel thankful for the very
</p>
<p>kind and sympathetic manner in which you express yourself to-

</p>
<p>tinue your favors to me whenever anything may occur, and you
</p>
<p>may depend upon my doing the same to yourself.
</p>
<p>In regard to the assassination of the Generals Smith, we do
</p>
<p>not intend to take any action in the case whatever, but leave our-
</p>
<p>selves entirely in the hands of the governor and the majesty of
</p>
<p>the law, to mete just and retributive justice in the matter.
</p>
<p>You may rest perfectly assured that we never did act on the
</p>
<p>offensive, or against the law, but shall continue the same course,
</p>
<p>which appears to have given you so much satisfaction, and act en-
</p>
<p>tirely on the defensive, and abide the law.

<p>GEORGE D. WATTS' REPORT OF THE CARTHAGE TRIAL
</p>
<p>'District Court of Illinois,
</p>
<p>Carthage, Hancock County, State of Iillinois,
</p>
<p>May 19, 1845.
</p>
<p>The Hon. Richard M. Young of Quincy on the bench. The fore-
</p>
<p>noon was spent in organizing. Adjourned at twelve m.
</p>
<p>Court met at two p.m.
</p>
<p>Colonel Levi Williams, Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the Warsaw
</p>
<p>Signal, Jacob C. Davis, state senator, Mark Aldrich and William N.
</p>
<p>Grover were held to bail with each other for sureties, in the sum
</p>
<p>of one thousand dollars each, to make their appearance in court
</p>
<p>each day of the term ; they were indicted for the murder of Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith at Carthage jail on the twenty-seventh day of June, 1844.
</p>
<p>The court decided that their case would be tried on Wednesday
</p>
<p>morning, May 21st.
</p>
<p>Accordingly the sheriff notified the witnesses for both parties
</p>
<p>to make their appearance on said morning at seven o'clock; the
</p>
<p>court then proceeded to other business.
</p>
<p>Wednesday Morning, May 21st.
</p>
<p>Court opened.

</p>
<p>The names of the counsel for the defense are as follows:
</p>
<p>William A. Richardson, 0. H. Browning, Calvin A. Warren.
</p>
<p>Josiah Lamborn, Esq. for the people.
</p>
<p>Colonel Wm. A. Richardson presented before the court two
</p>
<p>affidavits drawn out by the defendants to quash the array. The
</p>
<p>charge of prejudice, consanguinity and partiality was preferred by
</p>
<p>these affidavits against the county commissioners, the sheriff and
</p>
<p>his deputies in the arrangement of the present panel of jurors ; that
</p>
<p>their design was to hurt and prejudice the present trial, and thus
</p>
<p>endanger the lives of the defendants. On these grounds the defend-
</p>
<p>ants pleaded for the quashing of the array. After referring to the
</p>
<p>statute to show the provision made for such a proceeding he sub-
</p>
<p>mitted to the court.
</p>
<p>The attorney for the people then arose and made the follow-
</p>
<p>ing observations, viz.: That the doctrine advanced by Colonel
</p>
<p>Richardson was a novelty to him, as the affidavits of the defend-
</p>
<p>THE IDENTITY AND TRIAL OF THE MURDERERS 275
</p>
<p>ants predicated no charge against the present panel of jurors,
</p>
<p>either individually or collectively; he snowed from the statute
</p>
<p>that the array could not be quashed upon the above principle,
</p>
<p>neither did he believe the officers of the county could be discharged
</p>
<p>upon a mere exparte affidavit, but the charges ought to be made
</p>
<p>and affidavits filed and a trial had before the court. He said it
</p>
<p>was the first time he had heard of such a proceeding to quash the
</p>
<p>array, at the same time nothing alleged against it individually
</p>
<p>or collectively.
</p>
<p>He showed that the statute referred to by Colonel Richardson
</p>
<p>applied to civil and not criminal cases. He could not suffer the
</p>
<p>idea of having the panel quashed by the discharge of all the offi-
</p>
<p>cers of the county upon a mere exparte affidavit, and that too
</p>
<p>made by five men indicted for murder. He asked for a precedent
</p>
<p>in all the experience of this state or any other in criminal cases ;
</p>
<p>he defied them to produce a single case.
</p>
<p>Mr. Browning, for the defense, said, that although there had
</p>
<p>not been a precedent in the United States for such a proceeding,
</p>
<p>the reason is there has never been a case like this in the United
</p>
<p>States. He contended that such a proceeding is fully warranted by
</p>
<p>the English statutes and the statutes of the United States, that
</p>
<p>in a case like this the county commissioners, the sheriff and his
</p>
<p>deputies can be discharged, and in their place can be appointed
</p>
<p>elisors for the purpose of choosing another jury.
</p>
<p>The court ruled that the jury be discharged and elisors ap-
</p>
<p>pointed.
</p>
<p>The court then adjourned.
</p>
<p>Thursday, May 22nd
</p>
<p>The court appointed Thomas H. Owen and William D. Aber-
</p>
<p>nethy elisors and they selected a full panel of jurors.
</p>
<p>Four panels of jurors were successively called and out of the
</p>
<p>ninety-six men twelve were selected as a jury satisfactory to the
</p>
<p>defense.

</p>
<p>Mr. Lamborn prosecuted before this jury in a manner which
</p>
<p>showed clearly to every bystander the certainty of the guilt of
</p>
<p>the prisoners who were honorably acquitted. Mr. Frank Worrell,
</p>
<p>who had command of the guard at the jail at the time of the
</p>
<p>massacre, being summoned as a witness, and being asked by the
</p>
<p>prosecuting attorney if the guard had their guns loaded with
</p>
<p>blank cartridges at the time of the attack on the jail refused to
</p>
<p>answer, assigning as a reason that he could not without incrim-
</p>
<p>inating himself.' d. H. C. 421-22.
</p>
<p>COMMENTS ON THE VERDICT BY ORSON F. WHITNEY
</p>
<p>The trial took place at Carthage, beginning on the 19th of
</p>
<p>May, 1845. Sixty names had been presented to the Grand Jury
</p>
<p>of the Circuit Court, as being implicated in the crime, but only
</p>
<p>nine men had been indicted. * * * One of them, Levi Williams, the
</p>
<p>leader of the mob, was not only a Colonel of militia, he was also
</p>
<p>a Baptist preacher, and, of course, an "eminently respectable and
</p>
<p>276 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>conservative" man. Judge Richard M. Young presided at the
</p>
<p>trial, and James H. Ralston and Josiah Lamborn conducted the
</p>
<p>prosecution. The defense was represented by William A. Richard-
</p>
<p>son, O. H. Browning, Calvin A. Warren, Archibald Williams, 0. C.
</p>
<p>Skinner, and Thomas Morrison. The panel of the trial jury was
</p>
<p>as follows: Jesse Griffits, Joseph Jones, William Robertson,
</p>
<p>William Smith, Joseph Massey, Silas Griffits, Jonathan Foy,
</p>
<p>Solomon J. Hill, James Gittings, F. M. Walton, Jabez A. Beebe,
</p>
<p>and Gilmore Callison. The trial lasted until the 30th of May.
</p>
<p>During its progress, Mr. Warren, of counsel for the defense,
</p>
<p>argued, it is said, in the course of his plea, that if the prisoners
</p>
<p>were guilty of murder, then he himself was guilty; that it was
</p>
<p>the public opinion that the Smiths ought to be killed, and public
</p>
<p>opinion made the law; consequently it was not murder to kill
</p>
<p>them. Evidently this wretched piece of sophistry had weight with
</p>
<p>the jury in making up their verdict.
</p>
<p>"In the light of such statements as these, the verdict (not
</p>
<p>guilty) is easily explained. The jury may have been 'ignorant
</p>
<p>enough and indifferent enough' in the first place, as alleged; but
</p>
<p>they doubtless became well enough informed as to the fate that
</p>
<p>would befall them if their findings failed to please the mob, and
</p>
<p>were sufficiently interested to provide against the perilous con-
</p>
<p>tingency. " Mormon Prophet's Tragedy, pp. 89-90.

<p>GOV. FORD'S REVIEW OF THE TRIAL
</p>
<p>During the progress of these trials, the judge was compelled
</p>
<p>to permit the courthouse to be filled and surrounded by armed
</p>
<p>bands, who attended court to browbeat and overawe the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of justice. The judge himself w T as in a duress, and in-
</p>
<p>formed me that he did not consider his life secure any part of
</p>
<p>the time. The consequence was, that the crowd had everything
</p>
<p>their own way; the lawyers for the defense defended their clients
</p>
<p>by a long and elaborate attack on the governor; the armed mob
</p>
<p>stamped with their feet and yelled their approbation at every

</p>
<p>sarcastic and smart thing that was said; and the judge was not
</p>
<p>only forced to hear it, but to lend it a kind of approval. Josiah
</p>
<p>Lamborn was attorney for the prosecution; and O. H. Browning.

<p>CORONER'S VERDICT ON MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>(The following appears as a press dispatch, dated, Carthage, 111.,
</p>
<p>September 11th:
</p>
<p>An interesting discovery was made by Thomas B. Griffiths, a
</p>
<p>pioneer citizen, while hunting among a pile of rubbish in one of the
</p>
<p>court-house jury rooms. It is the original coroner's verdict on the
</p>
<p>killing of Joseph and Hyrum Smith at the old Carthage jail, on June
</p>
<p>28, 1844. The verdict reads as follows:
</p>
<p>"We, the jury, having been duly sworn by George W. Stigoll,
</p>
<p>coroner of Hancock County, diligently to inquire, and a true pre-
</p>
<p>sentment make, in what manner and by whom Joseph Smith and
</p>

</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith, whose dead bodies were found in and at the jail of
</p>
<p>Hancock County, on the 28th of June, 1844, came to their deaths,
</p>
<p>after having heard the evidence and upon full inquiry, concerning
</p>
<p>the facts and a careful examination of the said bodies, do find
</p>
<p>that deceased came to their deaths by violence, and that the body
</p>
<p>of the said Joseph Smith has upon it the following marks, to-wit :
</p>
<p>A bullet wound near the right breast and another in the right
</p>
<p>shoulder, and that the said Hyrum Smith has the following marks,
</p>
<p>to-wit: A wound in the throat by a bullet and a wound in the ab-
</p>
<p>domen, inflicted by some person or persons to the jury unknown
</p>
<p>and which the jury find to be the cause of their deaths."
</p>
<p>The document is signed by Wesley Williams, Franklin J. Barlett, Aaron
</p>
<p>Griffiths, Antony Barklan, George C. Waggoner, Peter Bioan, George Bach-
</p>
<p>man, Thomas Barnett, Elam S. Freeman, John Maherman, Simon Pennock,
</p>

</p>
<p>Endorsement: "Verdict 'of the jury on an inquest upon the bodies of
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith, filed, October 23, A. D., 1844."
</p>
<p>J. B. Backenstoe, Clerk.
</p>
<p>The document does not appear to have been filed until four months after
</p>
<p>the killing and the inquest. There can be no doubt as to its genuineness. It is
</p>
<p>written on an excellent quality of old style line foolscap, faintly ruled, and
</p>
<p>is discolored by time.
</p>
<p>So far as known, the only person now living who was on that jury is
</p>
<p>Mr. George C. Waggoner, of Pilot Grove township. Mr. Griffiths, who found

<p>prisoners were acquitted in the case of Joseph Smith. This ac-
</p>
<p>cords with the vote of the city council last July, that when the
</p>
<p>law failed to atone for the blood of our prophet and patriarch,
</p>
<p>shed at Carthage on the 27th of June last by a mob, we would
</p>
<p>refer the case to God for a righteous judgment, and we have never
</p>
<p>varied from that intention. If those men had been found guilty it
</p>
<p>would have been a novel case, and a violation of all the rules of the
</p>
<p>world in all martyr cases before.
</p>
<p>The wicked who slew the prophets  boiled the children of
</p>
<p>Israel in cauldrons, who fried them in pans, who stoned a Stephen,
</p>
<p>who crucified the Son of God, and who harrassed the Saints to
</p>
<p>death for sport, or burnt them at the stake, did the laws of the
</p>
<p>land and its executors ever make the perpetrators atone for that
</p>
<p>innocent blood ? No ! alas, no !
</p>
<p>We are satisfied to let the dead bury their dead. We ask for
</p>
<p>even handed justice, a righteous judgment, and we ask for our
</p>
<p>rights of the powers that be ; and then content ourselves as Saints
</p>
<p>of the living God with the action of those powers, knowing that
</p>
<p>the judge of all tke earth will reward every man according to his
</p>
<p>278 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>work in the day of judgment. The sentence of Jehovah upon Cain
</p>
<p>for martyring his brother Abel, is a sample for all murderers that
</p>
<p>have cursed themselves and the earth since  a fugitive and a
</p>
<p>vagabond in the earth shalt thou be.
</p>
<p>The severest punishment upon a guilty conscience is a con-
</p>
<p>tinual torment in the flesh without satisfying the demands of jus-
</p>
<p>tice, wiping out the stains of innocent blood, or soothing the cry
</p>
<p>of widows and orphans to God for vengeance! Again let us say
</p>
<p>we are satisfied; we will not do wrong because others do. The
</p>
<p>ghosts that haunt the guilty by night and by day shall never tor-
</p>
<p>ment us by shedding innocent blood. The blood of the prophets,
</p>
<p>the tears of the widows, and the weeping of orphan children, let
</p>
<p>alone the broken faith of a State, and the weakness of law, or
</p>
<p>even the scars of living witnesses, shall never cry in the ears of
</p>
<p>the Lord of Sabaoth for vengeance  because we have shed inno-
</p>
<p>cent blood, and hid ourselves under the cobwebs of chicanery.
</p>
<p>Mormonism was ever above such artifices, being eternal truth ;
</p>
<p>and while we seek peace and salvation, the murderers of Joseph
</p>
<p>and Hyrum Smith, be they who they may, can rest assured that
</p>
<p>their case, independent of all earthly tribunals, will be tried by
</p>
<p>the Supreme Judge of the universe, who has said, vengeance is
</p>
<p>mine, I will repay. The Mormons do not believe in taking life like
</p>
<p>the world, knowing that the scriptures say, "No murderer hath
</p>
<p>eternal life abiding in him."
</p>
<p>Calm as a summer's morning; still as the noiseless light that
</p>
<p>flies from sphere to sphere ; and orderly as the worlds roll in their
</p>
<p>circuits before the Lord, does Mormonism pursue the even tenor
</p>
<p>of its way  sounding to the nations of the earth good tidings of
</p>
<p>great joy; continually consoling one another;  with persecutions
</p>
<p>we are satisfied, with prosperity we are satisfied, yea, with all
</p>
<p>things we are satisfied when we know that God is satisfied! and
</p>
<p>from henceforth let all men who drive, despoil, rob, or murder
</p>
<p>us, do it on the credit of the nation; that if there be any glory

<p>in opposing Mormonism, all that act may share in that glory. As

<p>the most prominent points in the early history of her family ; their

<p>hardships, trials, privations, persecutions, sufferings, etc. ; some
</p>
<p>parts of which melted those who heard her to tears, more espe-

<p>cially the part relating to a scene in Missouri, when her beloved

<p>son Joseph was condemned to be shot in fifteen minutes, and she

<p>by prodigious efforts was enabled to press through the crowd to
</p>
<p>where he was, and to give him her hand; but could not see his

<p>face; he took her hand and kissed it; she said, "let me hear your

</p>
<p>She gave notice that she had written her history, and wished it

<p>printed before we leave this place. She then mentioned a discourse
</p>
<p>once delivered by Joseph after his return from Washington, in
</p>
<p>which he said that he had done all that could be done on earth to
</p>
<p>obtain justice for their ivrongs; but they ivere all, from the presi-
</p>
<p>dent to the judge, determined not to grant justice. "But," said he,

</p>
<p>going to lay them before the highest court in heaven." "Little," said

<p>CHAPTER 15
</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph in Zion's Camp
</p>
<p>(Excerpts)
</p>
<p>BY L. 0. LlTTLEFIELD
</p>
<p>I well remember when the name of Joseph Smith  the Prophet
</p>
<p>of God, whose destiny was to restore a knowledge of the fulness
</p>
<p>of the everlasting gospel to the earth at the commencement of the
</p>
<p>dispensation of the fulness of times  first saluted my ears in this
</p>
<p>life. I was then a mere boy, perhaps about nine years old.
</p>
<p>While playing with my eldest brother Josiah in the dooryard
</p>
<p>at the home of my parents, some person, whose name has passed
</p>
<p>out of my memory, came and informed our parents that a strange
</p>
<p>circumstance had taken place in the western portion of the State
</p>
<p>of New York, the State in which we then resided. This so impressed
</p>
<p>my young mind that I ceased to play with my brother and listened
</p>
<p>to all that was said by the stranger. He related in substance that
</p>
<p>a young man reported that he had found a record of a people who
</p>
<p>once dwelt upon this land but had become extinct in consequence
</p>
<p>of internal wars that occurred in their midst. This record was
</p>
<p>said to have been engraved upon gold plates, which had been hid
</p>
<p>in the earth ; and that the young man declared that an angel had
</p>
<p>directed him to the place where they had been concealed for very
</p>
<p>many years.
</p>
<p>This impressed us all as being a very strange rumor, but I
</p>
<p>do not remember that myself or my parents heard anything addi-
</p>
<p>tional to satisfy our awakened curiosity, until about two years from
</p>
<p>that date, after we had removed to the State of Michigan.
</p>
<p>We settled in Oakland County, near to the town of Pontiac.
</p>
<p>Two Mormon Elders came there as missionaries. They were the
</p>
<p>expounders of a new and very strange religion. My father and
</p>
<p>mother were members of the Methodist church, but out of curiosity
</p>
<p>they went to hear them preach and took me with them.
</p>
<p>We were a little late in arriving at the place where the meeting
</p>
<p>was being held, and we heard the speaker's voice distinctly before

</p>
<p>we reached the house. I have considered it somewhat singular,
</p>
<p>but it is truly a fact of which I have often spoken, that there was
</p>
<p>an inspiration or a convincing power which accompanied that
</p>
<p>man's voice that caused me to feel that he was a good man and
</p>
<p>was speaking the truth, though I had not distinctly understood
</p>
<p>a single word that he had uttered. After entering the house I
</p>
<p>believed every word that Elder Jared Carter, uttered to be the
</p>
<p>truth. I was convinced, even from the very sound of his voice,
</p>
<p>and still more confirmed after hearing his doctrines, that what
</p>
<p>he enunciated was what I have since more fully learned to be the
</p>
<p>fullness of the everlasting gospel, as was formerly preached by
</p>
<p>THE PROPHETIC FATE OF PERSECUTING NATIONS 281
</p>
<p>Christ and His apostles. "Blessed are they who know the joyful
</p>
<p>sound," saith the Psalmist.
</p>
<p>It is sufficient for my present purpose to record here that my
</p>
<p>parents soon were baptized, together with many others in that
</p>
<p>section of country. A branch of the Church was organized, over
</p>
<p>which Elder Samuel Bent was called to preside. This is the man
</p>
<p>who afterward became well known in the Church and was a
</p>
<p>member of the High Council in the days of Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>During Elder Bent's presidency in that branch of the Church,
</p>
<p>Elders Hyrum Smith and Lyman Wight came there on a special
</p>
<p>mission. They had been sent by the Church at Kirtland, Ohio,
</p>
<p>to gather up as many of the Latter-day Saints as was consistent
</p>
<p>with circumstances to go up to Missouri to aid the brethren there
</p>
<p>who had been driven from their homes in Jackson County, and, if
</p>
<p>possible, accomplish their re-establishment upon their lands in that
</p>
<p>county, as those brethren were the lawful possessors of those lands,
</p>
<p>to which they held lawful titles, and from which they had been
</p>
<p>forcibly ejected by mobs.
</p>
<p>I was away from my father's home when I learned of this
</p>
<p>proposed journey to Missouri. I was impressed with a desire 
</p>
<p>boy as I still was  to go with that company.
</p>
<p>When I returned home I found to my delight that my father
</p>
<p>was going, and designed to take my brother Josiah and myself
</p>
<p>with him.
</p>
<p>A company of, I believe, eighteen were soon in readiness for
</p>
<p>the journey. I cannot, from memory, give the names of all who
</p>
<p>composed the company, but, besides Elders Hyrum Smith and
</p>
<p>Lyman Wight, I remember Samuel Bent, Lyman Curtis, Meecham
</p>
<p>Smith, Alanson Colby, Ornon Hoton, Elijah Fordham, George
</p>
<p>Fordham, Waldo Littlefield, Josiah Littlefield, Lyman 0. Littlefield ;
</p>
<p>also three females : Sophronia Curtis, Charlotte Alverd and Sister
</p>
<p>Hoton, wife of Ornon Hoton.
</p>
<p>Our wagons contained our provisions, clothing, bedding, cook-

</p>
<p>ing utensils, etc., which, all told, made the loads so heavy that
</p>
<p>the men had to walk about the entire distance, and the women
</p>
<p>walked a great portion of the time where the roads were in a
</p>
<p>condition to admit of their doing so. Our two honored leaders
</p>
<p>also walked the entire distance.
</p>
<p>From our place of starting to the line which forms the western
</p>
<p>boundary of the State of Michigan was a long distance ; but when
</p>
<p>we reached that we had then to travel across the states of Indiana
</p>
<p>and Illinois before reaching the Missouri River at Quincy. As this
</p>
<p>stream, at that point, divides Illinois and Missouri, and as we were
</p>
<p>all weary and the most of us footsore, we were pleased enough to
</p>
<p>reach it; and we felt additional joy because of our anticipation
</p>
<p>of soon joining the main portion of Zion's Camp which was being
</p>
<p>led by the Prophet Joseph Smith.
</p>
<p>This camp  now so celebrated and making so important a
</p>
<p>portion of Church History  was encamped for a few days' rest
</p>
<p>at the farm and home where a brother in the Church, by the name
</p>
<p>of Burget, resided. It was there that our little Michigan company
</p>
<p>formed a junction with it.
</p>
<p>282 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>Our company had already learned to love and honor Hyrum
</p>
<p>Smith because of his dignified and upright course and correct
</p>
<p>teachings; and we rejoiced that our eager desires to become
</p>
<p>acquainted with his brother, the Prophet Joseph Smith, were so
</p>
<p>soon to be realized.
</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that I, so young in years, should be filled with
</p>
<p>sensations of intense pleasure and respect for him when I first met
</p>
<p>him? He was, indeed, more than all this, in my estimation, for I
</p>
<p>then and there felt, as it were, my whole being absorbed in the
</p>
<p>conviction and knowledge given me by the divine Spirit of truth,
</p>
<p>that he was a Prophet of God, raised up in the nineteenth century
</p>
<p>to restore the gospel that had been discarded by the people of the
</p>
<p>earth since the Savior was crucified and the prophets and apostles
</p>
<p>had been slain, or had fallen asleep in death. It surpasses the
</p>
<p>understanding of the carnal mind to comprehend the force of the
</p>
<p>testimony which the Spirit of divine truth brings to the minds of
</p>
<p>the honest in heart when convinced of the truth of the gospel or
</p>
<p>of the divine mission of God's chosen servants who are sent to
</p>
<p>deliver a gospel message or perform a work for the salvation
</p>
<p>and redemption of the fallen sons and daughters of Adam.
</p>
<p>He received our little company with manifestations of friend-
</p>
<p>ship and joy. The meeting with himself and his brother Hyrum
</p>
<p>was as might have been expected with two such noble men, united
</p>
<p>together by natural ties and with souls enlightened by divine influ-
</p>
<p>ences, the fruits of which was to them the knowledge that God
</p>
<p>lived and communicated His will from the heavens to them as He
</p>
<p>had done anciently before the channel of revelation was closed.
</p>
<p>The camp had traveled up from Kirtland, Ohio, under a variety
</p>
<p>of difficulties. The wonder, in the later years of my reflections,
</p>
<p>has been how the people of the towns, cities and states through
</p>
<p>which they passed permitted them to pursue their way without
</p>
<p>interposing force to stop them. It is looked upon by me to this
</p>
<p>day as being miraculous. God was in it, or they never could have

</p>
<p>penetrated so many hundreds of miles of the dense population of
</p>
<p>the United States. Indeed, they were even armed, but only for
</p>
<p>purposes of self protection, and no intention was entertained to
</p>
<p>use their arms for aggressive purposes. But why were not the
</p>
<p>people so jealous of their motive as to deprive them of their arms
</p>
<p>or turn them back? My emphatic answer to this would be that
</p>
<p>the camp was not thus hindered because God was in the movement.
</p>
<p>Partly for recuperative purposes and to effect a more thorough
</p>
<p>organization, Zion's Camp was halted at Brother Allred's place,
</p>
<p>at Salt River. The name of the county I cannot state, but it was
</p>
<p>no very great distance from the city of Quincy, across the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi River, west. In this work of reconstruction, cleansing
</p>
<p>and brushing off the dust that necessarily accumulated after many
</p>
<p>hundred miles of travel, the members of the camp were busily
</p>
<p>engaged and preparing to continue their march still to the west.
</p>
<p>The camping ground presented a city of tents and covered
</p>
<p>wagons. These were arranged in an order which made them quite
</p>
<p>THE PROPHETIC FATE OF PERSECUTING NATIONS 283
</p>
<p>convenient for all purposes of passing to and fro for horsemen,
</p>
<p>carriages or footmen. Visitors were struck with this feature of
</p>
<p>order, and seemed to look upon the camp as quite a novelty, and
</p>
<p>the people as being a class used to good order and thriftiness.
</p>
<p>The visiting resident citizens at this point, as well as I remem-
</p>
<p>ber, were by no means unfriendly, but were quite civil and courteous
</p>
<p>in their deportment towards the members of our company. Brother
</p>
<p>Allred and family were especially kind and active in making com-
</p>
<p>fortable as many as possible of our large number.
</p>
<p>The encampment at Brother Allred's was made, I think, two
</p>
<p>or three days previous to the arrival of our Michigan company.
</p>
<p>Our coming had been looked for and now that the junction had
</p>
<p>been formed, the main and active motive was to prepare for an
</p>
<p>advance as soon as possible. As I was then so very young I was
</p>
<p>naturally enough not made acquainted with the intricate or minute
</p>
<p>order in which the camp was organized for traveling; but I
</p>
<p>remember that they were classed into messes of tens for purposes
</p>
<p>of cooking, washing our clothing, eating, sleeping, etc. While
</p>
<p>there the men were paraded outside of the camp for exercise and
</p>
<p>instruction. This was an unpleasant feature for me, as I was
</p>
<p>too young and too small of stature to act with the men. This
</p>
<p>created within me, as I remember, some lonesome reflections. I
</p>
<p>sat down upon a rock where the men were passing, the better to
</p>
<p>observe their movements. While thus seated, the Prophet Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, who happened to be passing by in quite a hurry, noticed
</p>
<p>me. He stepped to where I sat alone. It might have been my
</p>
<p>isolated position that attracted him. I knew not the motive; but
</p>
<p>that man, who to me appeared so good and so godlike, really halted
</p>
<p>in his hurry to notice me  only a little boy. Placing one of his
</p>
<p>hands upon my head, he said: "Well, bub, is there no place for
</p>
<p>your
</p>
<p>This recognition from the man whom I then knew was a
</p>
<p>Prophet of God created within me a tumult of emotions. I could

</p>
<p>make him no reply. My young heart was filled with joy to me
</p>
<p>unspeakable. He passed on and left me in my lonely attitude, for
</p>
<p>he was then in quite a hurry to accomplish something pertaining
</p>
<p>to the movements of the men which could not be delayed.
</p>
<p>I mention this circumstance as it illustrates a trait of his
</p>
<p>character, which in after years he has often been seen to exemplify.
</p>
<p>He was naturally fond of the young  especially little children. He
</p>
<p>did not like to pass a child, however small, without speaking to it.
</p>
<p>He has been known to actually cross a street if he saw a child
</p>
<p>alone on the opposite side, to speak to it or to inquire if it had lost
</p>
<p>its way.
</p>
<p>These little acts of human sympathy were prompted by those
</p>
<p>innate qualities implanted in his heart which rendered it so easy
</p>
<p>and natural for him to be ever prompt in administering kindness
</p>
<p>and rendering aid to all who chanced to move within his accustomed
</p>
<p>rounds of life. He was not only kind and gentle to the youth, but
</p>
<p>the aged he treated with the respect due their whitened locks;
</p>
<p>and their tottering limbs could ever find ready and willing support
</p>
<p>284 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>on his strong arm, ever prompt to lead them to the place where
</p>
<p>inclination or duty called for their presence.
</p>
<p>Thus I have made allusion to my first introduction to an
</p>
<p>acquaintance with Joseph Smith, the God-chosen Prophet of the
</p>
<p>nineteenth century. In my estimation he was good and great, and
</p>
<p>even one of God's noblemen. My subsequent acquaintance with
</p>
<p>him proved to me that my first estimate of his true character was
</p>
<p>not too highly formed.
</p>
<p>Preparations were rapidly being made for the camp to move
</p>
<p>upon its westward journey. This required a great amount of care
</p>
<p>and labor to be performed. Every person was ready and willing
</p>
<p>to render whatever service Joseph advised, and his wishes were
</p>
<p>made known with such a good and friendly spirit that none could
</p>
<p>find a reason to feel anything but satisfied pleasure in pushing
</p>
<p>forward the necessary preparation.
</p>
<p>The camp consisted of two hundred and five persons, all
</p>
<p>happy, satisfied and hopeful. They felt they were discharging a
</p>
<p>great duty which they owed both to God and to their brethren
</p>
<p>who had been by violence dispossessed of their homes and driven
</p>
<p>from the lands for which they had paid their money and secured
</p>
<p>legal titles. But we had still to travel a long and weary road which
</p>
<p>lay, portions of it at least, through a country thickly settled by
</p>
<p>people who we had reasons to believe were much prejudiced against
</p>
<p>us and who according to rumor, would oppose our advance when
</p>
<p>we should reach their settlements. We had but one alternative
</p>
<p>which was to trust in God and go ahead.
</p>
<p>The bugle sounded for prayers night and morning, which
</p>
<p>service was attended to, not in mass with one person to act as
</p>
<p>intercessor, but this sacred duty was generally performed in the
</p>
<p>various tents and wagons according as the brethren were associated
</p>
<p>together in messes of tens, when some one of that little family
</p>
<p>would offer prayer for their respective number.
</p>

<p>we had bowed the head and bent the knee in offering our supplica-
</p>
<p>tions  the sweet singers would sing with the spirit and the under-
</p>
<p>standing, some of the hymns which had been inspired in connection
</p>
<p>with the great latter-day work. And these hymns were rendered
</p>
<p>by the faith which the new and everlasting gospel had revived in
</p>
<p>the hearts of those humble and faithful followers of Christ. In all
</p>
<p>these seasons of prayer and singing there was felt the power of
</p>
<p>faith which flowed pure and uninterrupted from the fountain of
</p>
<p>light. Even the unbelieving strangers who happened to be passing
</p>
<p>were attracted by these exercises; but the hearts of some were
</p>
<p>hardened and filled with the spirit of rage and bitterness.
</p>
<p>Frequently the leading men of the camp would speak to us
</p>
<p>and encourage us by their words and testimony concerning the
</p>
<p>truthfulness of the strange work which God had just brought to
</p>
<p>light. The Prophet himself frequently spoke to us in a collective
</p>
<p>capacity, and often with a power and force of utterance that
</p>
<p>exceeded anything that the members of the camp had ever before
</p>
<p>heard or seen manifested by mortal man. His inspired mind
</p>
<p>THE PROPHETIC FATE OF PERSECUTING NATIONS 285
</p>
<p>seemed to commune with, and at times, almost grasp the mind of
</p>
<p>Deity itself.
</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith was much beloved by all the members of the
</p>
<p>camp for zeal, faithfulness and a straightforward, even course
</p>
<p>from day to day. His daily deportment was exemplary and what-
</p>
<p>ever he said privately to the brethren or when he talked to them
</p>
<p>in a collective body, was received with approval and had great
</p>
<p>influence with them in stimulating them to endure the fatigues of
</p>
<p>travel with patience. He was a strong support to the Prophet
</p>
<p>and rendered every service in his power in helping to carry out
</p>
<p>his counsels and desires.
</p>
<p>Men were detailed to stand guard every night to watch our
</p>
<p>animals and to see that the threats of molestation made occasionally
</p>
<p>by some of the inhabitants were not carried into effect.
</p>
<p>The camp moved forward day after day and the routine of
</p>
<p>labors that were necessary to be performed was kept up in general
</p>
<p>good order and punctuality. Nearly every person in the camp
</p>
<p>had specific duties and labors assigned him. Some were cooks,
</p>
<p>some drove and took care of the teams ; others acted as commissary
</p>
<p>agents for the various messes, by visiting farm houses and other
</p>
<p>places to purchase provisions. Persons also were charged with
</p>
<p>the duty of procuring water for drinking and cooking purposes,
</p>
<p>while others procured fuel, all to be obtained as speedily as possible
</p>
<p>when the wagons were halted. We had no drones, and what was
</p>
<p>very agreeable, none performed these several duties with reluctance ;
</p>
<p>but all were accomplished orderly, with willing hands and cheerful
</p>
<p>hearts.
</p>
<p>The labors and duties that necessarily had to be performed
</p>
<p>by the members of Zion's Camp, day after day and night after
</p>
<p>night, were very fatiguing. The large majority of them walked
</p>
<p>the most of the way. The Prophet was relieved of this task. His
</p>
<p>duties were such that he had provided himself  extra from his
</p>
<p>baggage wagons  with a light, open carriage. Frequently he

</p>
<p>was under the necessity of driving several miles out of the course
</p>
<p>to be traveled by the main body of the camp, in order to transact
</p>
<p>business or hold an interview with some of the leading men, in
</p>
<p>order to allay excitement which here and there existed in opposition
</p>
<p>to our passing through the country with so large and well-disci-
</p>
<p>plined a force. Often he was under the necessity of taking a
</p>
<p>few men with him. When there was no business of this character
</p>
<p>to be attended to, he frequently would take his brother Hyrum or
</p>
<p>some two or three leading men with him to ride, for the purpose,
</p>
<p>no doubt, of consulting upon the best and wisest measures to be
</p>
<p>adopted in order to meet certain difficult circumstances that seemed
</p>
<p>to menace our advance.
</p>
<p>A complication of difficulties seemed to become more and
</p>
<p>more frequent as we traveled to the west and neared the place
</p>
<p>of our destination. At times the possibility of reaching the western
</p>
<p>counties of Missouri seemed dark and forbidding, and had it not
</p>
<p>been for the firm trust the Prophet and all in camp had in the
</p>
<p>overruling hand of God, we certainly would have been inclined
</p>
<p>to abandon all idea of being permitted to pass through the country
</p>
<p>286 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>much nearer to the setting sun. But night after night the prayers
</p>
<p>of the faithful ascended into the ears of Jehovah to soften the
</p>
<p>hearts of the people towards us, as we had no design of violence
</p>
<p>or evil against them or their country. We traveled by faith, and
</p>
<p>the Lord heard our importunities.
</p>
<p>It must have been the 22nd of June, 1834, that we camped
</p>
<p>at Fishing River, in the State of Missouri, as that is the date of
</p>
<p>a very important revelation received by the Prophet Joseph Smith.
</p>
<p>This revelation will be found commencing on page 377 of the third
</p>
<p>electrotype edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. Persons reading
</p>
<p>this revelation will obtain authentic reasons why Zion's Camp was
</p>
<p>started from Kirtland, Ohio, to journey into the western portion
</p>
<p>of the State of Missouri. The reasons there given are plain and
</p>
<p>will relieve me of the necessity of trying to give explanations in
</p>
<p>my own language. I will try, however, to give my readers, as
</p>
<p>well as I can, an understanding of the scenes that transpired at
</p>
<p>the place of our encampment, there and in the region round about.
</p>
<p>As near as memory serves me it was about 4 o'clock in the
</p>
<p>afternoon of June 22nd, 1834, that the camp made a halt and
</p>
<p>camped upon the bank of Fishing River. I am not certain whether
</p>
<p>the revelation here referred to was received on the very day we
</p>
<p>reached that point or whether it was received during the following
</p>
<p>day. I have an impression that this revelation was received the
</p>
<p>morning after. It will perhaps be sufficient to know that this
</p>
<p>revelation was received during the time the camp remained at that
</p>
<p>place.
</p>
<p>When we reached Fishing River the day was warm and very
</p>
<p>pleasant. I think there was not a cloud to be seen in the sky. We
</p>
<p>found the river in fine condition for fording. The water was
</p>
<p>reported, by the brethren who went down to it where the road
</p>
<p>crossed, to be not over knee-deep. Of course, we had plenty of
</p>
<p>time and might easily have crossed and made our encampment on
</p>
<p>the opposite shore long before dark ; but the brethren felt impressed

</p>
<p>not to cross the stream at that time. We were soon busy pitching
</p>
<p>our tents and placing the wagons in position, as was our custom.
</p>
<p>While we were building fires and commencing to prepare
</p>
<p>supper, two or three men rode hastily into camp and commenced
</p>
<p>a blasphemous tirade about "Jo Smith and the G  d d  d Mormons/'
</p>
<p>They wanted to know what the h  1 so many of us were traveling
</p>
<p>through the county for. They swore that we had got to our jour-
</p>
<p>ney's end. They declared also that a large force, consisting of
</p>
<p>several hundred armed men, would be at the ford on the opposite
</p>
<p>side of the river in a short time, and that our company would all
</p>
<p>be slaughtered before morning.
</p>
<p>The Prophet remonstrated firmly but quietly with them. He
</p>
<p>tried to calm their excited minds by assuring them that we had
</p>
<p>nothing but peaceable intentions toward the inhabitants.
</p>
<p>I thought the men were intoxicated; but whether this was
</p>
<p>their condition or not they certainly were very earnest and loud-
</p>
<p>spoken in their denunciations of the Mormons and "Jo Smith,"
</p>
<p>as they called him. During this parley  entirely unexpected on
</p>
<p>our part  the entire camp naturally gathered around them. Their
</p>
<p>THE PROPHETIC FATE OF PERSECUTING NATIONS 287
</p>
<p>position was on the main traveled road, on both sides of which
</p>
<p>our tents had been pitched. Joseph and a few of the leading men
</p>
<p>happened to be near the spot where they halted and commenced
</p>
<p>their angry declamation. I was at the outskirts of the brethren,
</p>
<p>who were quite densely massed around the rude intruders; but
</p>
<p>still near enough to note the contrast manifested between Joseph
</p>
<p>and the brethren and that of the rough, demoniacal appearance
</p>
<p>of these men as they sat upon their horses and swung their arms
</p>
<p>uncouthly around to give emphasis to their wicked threats of
</p>
<p>slaughter.
</p>
<p>Joseph maintained his usual dignity of demeanor. They
</p>
<p>failed to draw from him any angry resentment of words. He firmly
</p>
<p>and kindly assured them, however, that the remaining portion
</p>
<p>of our journey would be characterized by the same moderation
</p>
<p>and justice towards the inhabitants as had been the case all along
</p>
<p>our route of travel ; that we had not asked any aid from the people
</p>
<p>except we had paid the price asked for what we had obtained ; and
</p>
<p>he intended to pay a just equivalent for all supplies furnished us
</p>
<p>until our journey was ended. He only asked to travel peaceably
</p>
<p>through the country as an American citizen, with no intention
</p>
<p>other than to fully respect the rights of the citizens. He did not
</p>
<p>quail before them a particle, but took all the pains possible in the
</p>
<p>short time the men tarried to correctly inform them as to the
</p>
<p>honesty and justice of our motives.
</p>
<p>The men finally reined up their horses and spurred away,
</p>
<p>still shouting their anathemas to the effect that our company were
</p>
<p>all to be massacred during that night.
</p>
<p>These men were gone just long enough for us to look around
</p>
<p>a little, when we observed the sky was being rapidly overcast with
</p>
<p>densely dark and angry clouds. I think we had not all finished
</p>
<p>eating our suppers, when the rain began to fall in torrents, accom-
</p>
<p>panied with terribly fierce wind. So violent was the wind and
</p>
<p>torrents of rain that neither our wagons nor tents afforded us

</p>
<p>protection, and we were quickly drenched and almost unable to
</p>
<p>stand against the fierceness of the blast. Our condition was indeed
</p>
<p>critical.
</p>
<p>Close by where we were encamped was a large log meeting-
</p>
<p>house. We had no alternative but to seek shelter within the strong
</p>
<p>walls of this building. The door was found locked, but the windows
</p>
<p>were easily raised and we hastily found ingress thereby. Had it not
</p>
<p>been for that shelter our suffering must have been great  the
</p>
<p>effects from which might have been fatal to some of us at least.
</p>
<p>I have witnessed rain storms in various portions of the earth,
</p>
<p>but nothing I have ever experienced has equaled that storm in
</p>
<p>point of the terrible fierceness of the wind and the immensity of
</p>
<p>water that fell. What added to the destructiveness of the storm
</p>
<p>were the missiles of hail that were hurled in vast quantities by the
</p>
<p>currents of wind that rushed and roared through the woods which
</p>
<p>surrounded our place of shelter, causing the sound of falling trees
</p>
<p>and massive limbs to add additional terrors to the general clang
</p>
<p>of the storm.
</p>
<p>The vast electric artillery of the expansive firmament seemed
</p>
<p>288 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>to be in a state of rapid combustion, so that night, which otherwise
</p>
<p>would have been as dark as night could possibly become, was at
</p>
<p>times rendered so light that we could look far out beyond the sway-
</p>
<p>ing trees, and falling and splintered branches hurled along the
</p>
<p>air and striking the earth with a fury that made us truly thankful
</p>
<p>for the protecting walls of the strong blockhouse that rendered
</p>
<p>us secure from the perils of that exciting hour. The elemental
</p>
<p>phenomena of that night were certainly a strange mixture of hail
</p>
<p>and rain, light and darkness, alternating in successive motion as
</p>
<p>if vieing with each other to become champions in the strife.
</p>
<p>The heavens above us were so completely lit up by the electric
</p>
<p>display that the dense and sombrous clouds appeared as ponderous
</p>
<p>masses floating through luminous areas of glowing light. We
</p>
<p>looked and gazed through the protecting windows of our place of
</p>
<p>refuge, and amazement filled our minds as we contemplated the
</p>
<p>inimitable wonders of the God of nature.
</p>
<p>The voice of thunder uttered anathemas against the enemies
</p>
<p>of truth and righteousness, who were massed with arms across
</p>
<p>the river, ready at that hour to fall upon us and spill our blood.
</p>
<p>And that thunder shook the very earth with terrible force, as if
</p>
<p>threatening to open its caverns and engulf whatever existed upon
</p>
<p>its surface within the range of that perilous storm. But our trust
</p>
<p>was in Jehovah, and we looked confidently for His preservation,
</p>
<p>for we knew, by the faith that the gospel had implanted in our
</p>
<p>hearts, that the arm of the Eternal Father was stretched out for
</p>
<p>our preservation.
</p>
<p>I cannot relate how our animals fared outside ; but the peltings
</p>
<p>of the rain and hail hurled against them by such fierce wind as
</p>
<p>blew through that night must have tortured them unmercifully.
</p>
<p>I understood, however, that they, as much as possible, were placed
</p>
<p>at the lee side of the wagons and the large building that sheltered
</p>
<p>us. Nearly everything in our wagons was wet and unfit for use
</p>
<p>until overhauled and dried.

</p>
<p>At length the terrible night was passed and a glorious morn-
</p>
<p>ing's sun chased away the darkness and revealed for our inspection
</p>
<p>the fragmentary condition of the woods and fields. A visible
</p>
<p>change had been wrought by the warring elements. The work
</p>
<p>of havoc and devastation met the eye in every direction. Trees
</p>
<p>were uprooted and limbs hurled in great quantities to the earth.
</p>
<p>But the brightness of the new-born day and the reviving warmth
</p>
<p>of the June sun re-assured all nature. The birds of the woods
</p>
<p>hymned their unwritten notes of sweetness and twittered through
</p>
<p>the branches as if to search out the new disasters that had befallen
</p>
<p>their wonted resorts.
</p>
<p>The brethren also partook of the genial influence. They
</p>
<p>rejoiced in the morning's effulgence and thanked God that He had
</p>
<p>preserved them and revived within them an increase of faith in
</p>
<p>His overruling providences. They took hasty excursions here
</p>
<p>and there and found the storm had left its destructive mark to an
</p>
<p>extent that surpassed expectation. From the place of our encamp-
</p>
<p>ment we heard the roar of water in the river and in a short time
</p>
<p>some of our men returned and declared that the water in Fishing
</p>
<p>THE PROPHETIC FATE OF PERSECUTING NATIONS 289
</p>
<p>River was forty feet deep ! When we made our encampment there
</p>
<p>it was no more than knee deep. What did we understand by this?
</p>
<p>We understood that the Almighty had sent that storm for the
</p>
<p>special preservation of Zion's Camp. This was a great truth
</p>
<p>that was plain to our comprehension and the gratitude we felt
</p>
<p>to our Heavenly Father was such that melted our hearts with
</p>
<p>thankfulness.
</p>
<p>As soon as we well could we prepared for starting, after
</p>
<p>partaking of a scanty breakfast. We found the road in many
</p>
<p>places strewn with limbs and a few trees, some of which we had
</p>
<p>to remove before we could proceed. Of course the roads were muddy
</p>
<p>and our progress was anything but rapid. After we had traveled
</p>
<p>a few miles we came to a friendly family who received us with
</p>
<p>feelings of humane sympathy. We camped at that place and took
</p>
<p>time to rest and recover to some extent from the fatigues and
</p>
<p>exposures of the night. The Prophet Joseph there made a speech
</p>
<p>to the members of the camp, and, if I remember correctly, a few
</p>
<p>strangers were present. Joseph spoke almost with superhuman
</p>
<p>force and clearness. He told us that the storm had been sent by
</p>
<p>the God of Israel to place a barrier between us and our enemies,
</p>
<p>to prevent them from falling upon us during the night to massacre
</p>
<p>us, as the men who rode into our camp the evening before had
</p>
<p>declared was the intention. We soon learned from the inhabitants
</p>
<p>that this was certainly in the program of a few hundred men to
</p>
<p>do, who were posted not far from the ford on the opposite shore.
</p>
<p>Could we now have the prophetic declarations made by the
</p>
<p>Prophet Joseph in his speech at that place they would be far above
</p>
<p>the value of gold. They were of such import that no man but an
</p>
<p>inspired servant of Jehovah could have uttered them. I can see
</p>
<p>him to this day, in memory, as his tall, manly form stood erect
</p>
<p>and commanding. His face shone with the light of the Holy Spirit,
</p>
<p>his mild blue eyes fairly sparkled with the fire of the divinity that
</p>
<p>possessed his being. I can only let that scene live in memory, and

</p>
<p>thank my Heavenly Father that I heard that mighty man in the
</p>
<p>days of my youth, when early impressions are not apt to die.
</p>
<p>He declared the storm of that night was to be numbered
</p>
<p>among the manifestations which were to follow in the last days
</p>
<p>in defense of the house of Israel, scattered among the nations of
</p>
<p>the earth. He said the fury of elements ivould yet ivaste away the
</p>
<p>wicked, and floods ivould overflow the river banks and sweep the
</p>
<p>precious fruits of soil from the possession of those who had labored
</p>
<p>to mature them. The sea ivould sweep beyond its bounds and
</p>
<p>work wonderful havoc, and that earthquakes would shake the
</p>
<p>earth and cast down the dwellings of those whose hearts rebelled
</p>
<p>against the everlasting gospel. God ivould visit the wicked nations
</p>
<p>with just retribution, for many of them would harden their hearts
</p>
<p>against the testimony of the humble ambassadors of truth; that
</p>
<p>the time was nigh when He would have a controversy with the
</p>
<p>people of the earth, for they ivould yet shed the blood of His
</p>
<p>prophets and cast out His people from their borders. These sayings
</p>
<p>were not uttered in the exact words here written, but this will
</p>
<p>convey to the reader a portion of the substance of his declarations.
</p>
<p>290 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>He said also that Jehovah had commanded that journey to be
</p>
<p>taken and He would protect the members of the camp to their
</p>
<p>place of destination; that no hand should prosper that should be
</p>
<p>lifted against them, if they would continue to be united and faithful
</p>
<p>in walking by the counsel that should be imparted to them from
</p>
<p>time to time by the influence of the Spirit of the Great Jehovah.
</p>
<p>"During our travels," said the Prophet, "we visited several of
</p>
<p>the mounds which had been thrown up by the ancient inhabitants of
</p>
<p>this country, Nephites, Lamanites, etc., and this morning I went up
</p>
<p>on a high mound near the river, accompanied by the brethren. From
</p>
<p>this mound we could overlook the tops of the trees and view the
</p>
<p>prairie on each side of the river as far as our visions could extend,
</p>
<p>and the scenery was truly delightful.
</p>
<p>"On the top of the mound were stones which presented the
</p>
<p>appearance of three altars having been erected one above the
</p>
<p>other, according to ancient order, and human bones were strewn
</p>
<p>over the surface of the ground. The brethren procured a shovel
</p>
<p>and hoe, and removing the earth to the depth of about one foot
</p>
<p>discovered the skeleton of a man, almost entire, and between his
</p>
<p>ribs was a Lamanitish arrow, which evidently produced his death.
</p>
<p>Elder Brigham Young retained the arrow and the brethren carried
</p>
<p>some pieces of the skeleton to Clay County. The contemplation
</p>
<p>of the scenery before us produced peculiar sensations in our
</p>
<p>bosoms; and the visions of the past being opened to my under-
</p>
<p>standing by the Spirit of the Almighty, I discovered that the
</p>
<p>person whose skeleton was before us was a white Lamanite, a
</p>
<p>large, thick-set man, and a man of God. He was a warrior and
</p>
<p>chieftain under the great prophet Omandagus, who was known
</p>
<p>from the hill Cumorah, or Eastern Sea, to the Rocky Mountains.
</p>
<p>His name was Zelph. The curse was taken from him, or at least
</p>
<p>in part; one of his thigh bones was broken by a stone flung from
</p>
<p>a sling, while in battle years before his death. He was killed in
</p>
<p>battle by the arrow found among his ribs, during the last great

</p>
<p>struggle of the Lamanites and Nephites."
</p>
<p>Our camp was made at Brother Burget's on the 23rd of June,
</p>
<p>1834. Of the night of the 24th of June the Prophet writes :
</p>
<p>"This night the cholera burst forth among us, and about
</p>
<p>midnight it was manifest in its most terrified form. Our ears
</p>
<p>were saluted with cries and moanings and lamentations on every
</p>
<p>hand; even those on guard fell to the earth with their guns in
</p>
<p>their hands, so sudden and powerful was the attack of this terrible
</p>
<p>disease. At the commencement I attempted to lay on hands for
</p>
<p>their recovery, but I quickly learned by painful experience that
</p>
<p>when the Great Jehovah decrees destruction upon any people, makes
</p>
<p>known His determination, man must not attempt to stay His hand.
</p>
<p>The moment I attempted to rebuke this disease, that moment I was
</p>
<p>attacked, and had I not desisted, I must have saved the life of
</p>
<p>my brother by the sacrifice of my own, for when I rebuked the
</p>
<p>disease it left him and seized me.
</p>

</p>
<p>was the first man who stepped forward to rebuke it, and upon
</p>
<p>this, was immediately seized and became the first victim of the

</p>
<p>camp. He died about six o'clock in the afternoon, and Seth
</p>
<p>Hitchcock died in about thirty minutes after. As it was impossible
</p>
<p>to obtain coffins, the brethren rolled them in blankets, carried
</p>
<p>them on a horse sled about half a mile and buried them in the bank
</p>
<p>of a small stream which empties into Rush Creek, all of which was
</p>
<p>accomplished by dark.
</p>
<p>"When they had returned from the burial, the brethren united,
</p>
<p>covenanted and prayed, hoping the disease would be stayed ; but in
</p>
<p>vain, for while thus covenanting, Eber Wilcox died, and while
</p>
<p>some were digging the grave others stood sentry with their fire
</p>
<p>arms, watching their enemies.
</p>
<p>"The cholera," he states, "continued its ravages about four
</p>
<p>days, when an effectual remedy for their purging, vomiting and
</p>
<p>cramping was discovered, viz. : dipping the person afflicted in
</p>
<p>cold water, or pouring it upon him. About sixty-eight of the Saints
</p>
<p>suffered from this disease, of which number thirteen died, viz. :
</p>
<p>John S. Carter, Eber Wilcox, Seth Hitchcock, Erastus Rudd,
</p>
<p>Algernon Sidney Gilbert, Alfred Fisk, Edward Ives, Noah Johnson,
</p>
<p>Jesse B. Lawson, Robert McCard, Elial Strong, Jesse Smith and
</p>
<p>Betsy Parish."
</p>
<p>With regard to the disbanding of the camp Joseph writes:
</p>
<p>"Early in the morning of the 25th the camp was separated into
</p>
<p>small bands and dispersed among brethren living in the vicinity."
</p>
<p>Our last encampment was made on Rush Creek, in brother
</p>
<p>Burget's field. It was the ending of a long, arduous and fatiguing
</p>
<p>journey of over one thousand miles, mostly performed on foot,
</p>
<p>over roads variegated by dust and mud, and crossing streams of
</p>
<p>both small and large dimensions.
</p>
<p>It being in the warm season of the year, much suffering was
</p>
<p>necessarily endured by being necessitated, the most of us at least,
</p>
<p>to walk, unsheltered from the broiling sun. Sometimes, for a little
</p>
<p>season, we endured both hunger and thirst, but this class of suffer-
</p>
<p>ing came upon us generally when we were out of the reach of

<p>CHAPTER 16
</p>
<p>Physical and Mental Sufferings of Persecutors
</p>
<p>A MOBOCRAT COMES TO UTAH
</p>
<p>Affidavit of William H. Chappell, now residing in Coalville,
</p>
<p>Summit County, Utah, concerning a member of the mob that killed
</p>
<p>the Prophet Joseph Smith.
</p>
<p>About the year 1892, when I was eighteen years of age (hav-
</p>
<p>ing been born on the 29th of April, 1874), and living in what was
</p>
<p>then known as East Coalville ward but now known as Cluff ward),
</p>
<p>an old man by the name of Brooks moved into that neighborhood
</p>
<p>and lived neighbor to my father, William E. Chappell. This old
</p>
<p>man had a son by the name of Alf Brooks who was some four years
</p>
<p>older than I. As I remember, it was a little log house in which he
</p>
<p>lived. The old man used to come to my father's home, sit on the
</p>
<p>porch and talk to my father. The conversation turned to pioneer
</p>
<p>stories and of Joseph Smith the Prophet. On one particular even-
</p>
<p>ing after my father had talked about Joseph Smith, the old man
</p>
<p>Brooks said : "Mr. Chappell, I saw the last bullet shot into the old
</p>
<p>boy." After Mr. Brooks had gone to his cabin, my father said:
</p>
<p>"No wonder he is a miserable old soul. If he saw the last bullet
</p>
<p>shot into Joseph Smith, he was in that mob. If he was in that mob,
</p>
<p>it has been prophesied that he will suffer all kinds of torment, his
</p>
<p>limbs shall rot off of his body and he will not have courage to take
</p>
<p>his own life."
</p>
<p>Before this conversation occurred, I had taken no notice of the
</p>
<p>old man but I had been rather friendly and chummy with his son ;
</p>
<p>but after this conversation I took particular notice of the old man
</p>
<p>and how he suffered. The old man had a belt which he wore around
</p>
<p>his waist which the son would take off, then beat the old man with
</p>
<p>it just to hear him scream and when beating him the son would
</p>
<p>laugh and profane and seemed to enjoy it. All of this I saw. The
</p>
<p>old man was crippled and could walk only with the aid of two
</p>
<p>sticks  one in each hand and without the aid of these he was
</p>
<p>totally helpless and unable to walk. The cause of this crippled

</p>
<p>condition was unknown to me. The son would drive the old man
</p>
<p>up to the coal mine dump about three or four hundred yards from
</p>
<p>their cabin like he would drive cattle and fill sacks with coal, tie
</p>
<p>the sacks on the old man's back and drive him back to the cabin.
</p>
<p>The old man would beg his son not to fill the sacks too full of coal.
</p>
<p>If he would not go fast enough the son would whip him with his
</p>
<p>belt which he had taken from the father before going for the coal.
</p>
<p>They lived in this cabin for some two years and then moved to
</p>
<p>Coalville, into a house near where the present Beth White hot dog
</p>
<p>stand is now located. While living here his toes rotted off his feet.
</p>
<p>Later, a Dr. Cannon, then living in Coalville, and who owned a
</p>
<p>ranch in Weber canyon about eight miles above Oakley, made ar-
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 293
</p>
<p>rangements with this old man and his son to start a chicken ranch
</p>
<p>on Dr. Cannon's premises, onto which the father and son moved.
</p>
<p>About that time my sister, Elizabeth Chappell, married Thomas
</p>
<p>Wilde and he owned a ranch adjoining Dr. Cannon's and lived
</p>
<p>about four hundred yards from where the old man and his son
</p>
<p>lived. In the spring, Dr. Cannon made inquiry concerning the
</p>
<p>disappearance of the chickens on the farm and the old man replied
</p>
<p>that "The skunks had eaten them up." To which Dr. Cannon re-
</p>
<p>plied : "You are the biggest skunk."
</p>
<p>The son would often leave his father for three or four days
</p>
<p>and sometimes a week without any food. I was up to my brother-
</p>
<p>in-law's ranch one fall, in November, when an eight inch snow fell,
</p>
<p>the weather clearing up in the afternoon, and dropping to zero
</p>
<p>weather by night. My brother-in-law and I took over an extra
</p>
<p>quilt and some supper to the old man and also chopped wood which
</p>
<p>we piled close to the stove so that he could handily keep the fire
</p>
<p>going during the night without getting out of bed. After return-
</p>
<p>ing home later in the night, I heard him screaming. I awoke my
</p>
<p>brother-in-law and he said : "Don't take notice of him ; he always
</p>
<p>screams like that." When we got up the next morning, we looked
</p>
<p>towards his cabin and saw that the house was gone. We immediate-
</p>
<p>ly went to where his cabin had been and found it had burned to the
</p>
<p>ground during the night. All of the old man's clothes had burned
</p>
<p>off of him and he was burned all over his body from his feet to the
</p>
<p>top of his head. He was alive and lay curled up in the ashes of
</p>
<p>the burned cabin, trying to keep warm. We secured some quilts
</p>
<p>and with team and sleigh we took him to Peoa where we found the
</p>
<p>son. The people of Peoa took up a collection which amounted to
</p>
<p>five dollars, gave it to the son and told him to go to Park City for the
</p>
<p>particular medicine he was directed to buy. With the money the
</p>
<p>son bought liquor and became drunk and did not return for four
</p>
<p>days. The old man died on the fourth day after he was burned,
</p>
<p>before his son returned. His remains were interred in the Peoa

<p>I, Joseph H. Wilde, was present when my brother, Thomas
</p>
<p>Wilde and others, took the blankets to the cabin to cover the old
</p>
<p>man as stated in the above affidavit. The old man was an habitual
</p>
<p>user of chewing tobacco and upon this occasion my brother had pur-

</p>
<p>chased a plug for him and presented it to him. The old man thought
</p>
<p>it was a revolver that was being shoved towards him and ex-
</p>
<p>claimed : "For God's sake don't shoot me." I was a little boy when
</p>
<p>these things happened but I can distinctly remember the old man
</p>
<p>referring to the Prophet Joseph Smith as "old Joe Smith." Although
</p>
<p>this man was implicated in the murder of the Prophet Joseph, yet
</p>
<p>the Latter-day Saints who resided in this vicinity were very con-
</p>
<p>siderate and brought food and clothing to him, particularly was

<p>this true of my brother Thomas Wilde who resided but a short

<p>distance from the cabin in which the old man, Mr. Brooks, lived.

<p>His son, Alf . Brooks, helped my brother during the haying season
</p>
<p>and ate dinner at his home when so employed.

<p>THIRTEEN MOBOCRATS MEET A COMMON FATE
</p>
<p>Martha James Cragun (who married Isaiah Cox) was born
</p>
<p>March 3, 1852, in Mill Creek, Salt Lake County, Utah. In October,
</p>
<p>1862, they received a call to go to the Dixie country as pioneers and
</p>
<p>in May Gt. grandfather James Cragun, his wife (Eleanor Lane
</p>
<p>Cragun) and family started for Dixie. Martha Cox received her
</p>
<p>schooling there by going to school and working on the side. She started
</p>
<p>teaching in 1868 and was married Dec. 6, 1869 in the Salt Lake
</p>
<p>Endowment House by Pres. Daniel H. Wells. She resumed teaching
</p>
<p>as soon as they returned from Salt Lake City and taught in St.
</p>
<p>George off and on until the 31st of August, 1881, when she arrived
</p>
<p>in the Muddy Valley.
</p>
<p>From Diary of J. C. Cox
</p>
<p>The trustees of the Muddy Valley school had notified me that
</p>
<p>they expected to open their school September 1st. I was there
</p>
<p>August 31.*** The next morning after my arrival I visited the
</p>
<p>trustees at the place where the school house was in course of erec-

</p>
<p>tion. I introduced myself as their contemplated school "marm."
</p>
<p>There was Mr. McGuire, the leading trustee, who was a tall Irish-
</p>
<p>man, sitting when I first came up, on a large stone which was to be
</p>
<p>used as a hearth stone in the building, but who stood up with a
</p>
<p>pipe with long stem held in his drooling mouth. He removed his
</p>
<p>hat and scratched his shaggy head while he informed me that it
</p>
<p>would be three weeks before they would be ready for me.
</p>
<p>I asked what preparation was needed for readiness. They said
</p>
<p>only the finishing of the house and this had only the walls partly
</p>
<p>up. I looked at Morgan, the second trustee, a great massive form
</p>
<p>of fat, muscle and bone, whose business it seemed was to haul in
</p>
<p>the material while Ute Perkins whom I knew as an old St. Georger
</p>
<p>had the business of putting the mortar and adobies together. I
</p>
<p>told them if that was all they needed, the school need not wait a
</p>
<p>day for with such beautiful weather a class seated under the beau-
</p>
<p>tiful cottonwood trees by the side of the lovely clear stream could
</p>
<p>have no better place for learning and if they would assent to it 7
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 295
</p>
<p>would open school the next morning under the trees. McGuire re-
</p>
<p>ceived my proposition with a doubtful look but that was dispelled
</p>
<p>when I smilingly told him I could teach all I knew under the cotton-
</p>
<p>wood trees. So it was arranged. An old man named Roscoe owned
</p>
<p>a cabin hard by, just across the little creek with a clean hard door
</p>
<p>yard that reached to the creek bank. Directly across the stream
</p>
<p>was a level space shaded by three beautiful trees. Here they brought
</p>
<p>a few of the school desks and Mr. Roscoe loaned me an old table
</p>
<p>for my use. The pupils hung bonnets and hats on nails driven in
</p>
<p>the trees, where I also contrived to hang my black board which I
</p>
<p>had always retained from the time I had it converted from a bread-
</p>
<p>board for my very first school. That afternoon, Sept. 1st, I regis-
</p>
<p>tered nine pupils.
</p>
<p>An outsider by the name of Logan, the other trustee, living at
</p>
<p>a place that still bears his name, retained his children  would not
</p>
<p>send them to be taught by a "Mormon," besides the school house was
</p>
<p>not being built in the right place as he saw it. The trustees asked
</p>
<p>me to visit him which I did. He told me he withheld assistance on
</p>
<p>the house building because it was not placed on the right spot and
</p>
<p>would not send his children so far to the school and he lived at least
</p>
<p>five miles away. But he made no reference to the teacher. His
</p>
<p>tobacco drooling from his mouth and his otherwise stinking per-
</p>
<p>son was disgusting and Sister Whitmore and myself soon took our
</p>
<p>leave. I felt that I had at least one mortal enemy in the valley.
</p>
<p>He told me also that I would have trouble about getting my pay
</p>
<p>and told me I had better withdraw and leave the valley. I was not
</p>
<p>at all frightened.
</p>
<p>At a meeting in Saint Thomas (Nevada) called of all the people
</p>
<p>to consider the wants of the school and the "Mormon" teacher, each
</p>
<p>citizen was asked to give his mind on the Mormon question  neith-
</p>
<p>er Mrs. Whitmore nor myself were invited so we were not present.
</p>
<p>At this meeting all except Logan decided to sustain me. One man
</p>
<p>a "Jack Reed" an old man who was respected in the valley, living
</p>

</p>
<p>then in St. Thomas, said in this meeting that he was a member of
</p>
<p>the mob who martyred the prophet. He was about fifteen years
</p>
<p>old at the time. He said he took his gun and marched proudly to
</p>
<p>Carthage and took part in the killing of the two prophets. Mrs.
</p>
<p>McGuire related to me what he said ; then told me also that her own
</p>
<p>father was one of the mobbers who tarred and feathered the proph-
</p>
<p>et and she told me she thought I was too smart a woman to be a
</p>
<p>Mormon.
</p>
<p>I had my abode with Sister Whitmore. I was expected to help
</p>
<p>with the work of the house to pay my room. This I did satisfactor-
</p>
<p>ily, but it was a difficult thing to find my food. I soon ran out of
</p>
<p>flour and had to borrow from my friends. I did the milking and
</p>
<p>cared for the milk for a portion of the milk. It was hard for the
</p>
<p>folks to find a way to send me supplies. I made arrangement with
</p>
<p>Sister Whitmore to let me do more work and give me meals. I did
</p>
<p>some peculiar work. I picked cotton on Saturday and put in one
</p>
<p>day of work cutting sunflowers.
</p>
<p>About the last of September I heard that Jack Reed was very
</p>
<p>296 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>sick of a strange ailment. He was taken ill in a few days after
</p>
<p>having made the statement that he took part in the affair at
</p>
<p>Carthage  but no one had told me of his sickness until I heard
</p>
<p>it from one of my Indian friends who said he had worms in his
</p>
<p>flesh. I determined to see him if I could and try to get him to verify
</p>
<p>the statement he had made at the meeting. The man had no family
</p>
<p>and Mr. McGuire was his attendant. I asked Mr. McGuire if he
</p>
<p>would allow Mrs. Whitmore and myself to visit Mr. Reed. He said
</p>
<p>that Mr. Reed was a sight that no white woman could be allowed
</p>
<p>to look upon. He was literally eaten alive by worms. His eye balls
</p>
<p>had fallen out, the flesh on his cheeks and neck had fallen off and
</p>
<p>though he could breathe he could take nourishment only through
</p>
<p>an opening in his throat, and said McGuire, "Pieces of flesh as large
</p>
<p>as my two hands have fallen off from different parts of his body."
</p>
<p>The sick man's farm was given to the white men who attended him
</p>
<p>in the first of his ailment. Finally when they could no longer en-
</p>
<p>dure the ordeal the Indians were called in to pour water into his
</p>
<p>throat and give him whatever other attention they could and these
</p>
<p>received the sick man's bunch of horses for their pay. When he
</p>
<p>finally passed the Indians carried out the awful remains by the
</p>
<p>four corners of the blanket upon which he had lain for weeks, and
</p>
<p>lowered that into the box the white men had prepared. The blanket
</p>
<p>was tucked in over him and the box quickly nailed up and put into
</p>
<p>the deep grave as soon as possible. No funeral was held. Beside
</p>
<p>Reed, Mr. Logan was backed by another man, a lawyer named
</p>
<p>McGarrigle. I had gathered the idea that this bunch of enemies
</p>
<p>were heading a petition against me because I was a polygamist.
</p>
<p>But during Reed's sickness all talk of Mormons seemed to die down.
</p>
<p>It was not for a long time, some years afterwards, that I learned
</p>
<p>the cause of the qualm. One called "Jack Longstreet" became
</p>
<p>Reed's first attendant in company with McGuire. To these men
</p>
<p>Reed confessed that his participation in the murder of the Prophets
</p>
<p>was the cause of his affliction. He said to Longstreet: "It is the

</p>
<p>Mormon curse that is upon me. I cannot live  / must utterly rot
</p>
<p>before I die." He said that Brigham Young had pronounced that
</p>
<p>curse upon all that mob, and he had known thirteen of them to die
</p>
<p>just as he was dying. But he had lived so long and had passed the
</p>
<p>unlucky number thirteen, that he thought to escape the curse. He
</p>
<p>charged his attendants to never do anything against the Mormons,
</p>
<p>to be their friends, or said he, "You may suffer the Mormon curse."
</p>
<p>Longstreet related this to Mrs. Emma Huntsman, with whom he
</p>
<p>often stopped, this confession of Reed's as a ivarning to her and
</p>
<p>declared that he himself would not dare to raise a hand against
</p>
<p>them. I don't think he ever did.

<p>STATEMENT OF GEORGE E. KING
</p>
<p>(Dictated to N. B. Lundwall, at the farm home of Mr. King,
</p>
<p>near Garland, Utah, on August 4, 1950.)
</p>
<p>During the early summer of 1925, I was a graduate student
</p>
<p>and half-time faculty member of the University of Illinois. As
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 297
</p>
<p>was frequently my practice, I was doing- some extracurricular
</p>
<p>work for a friend at the home of Seth Howe, in Champaign, Illi-
</p>
<p>nois. Casually Mr. Howe and I, in conversation, discussed our per-
</p>
<p>sonal beliefs. He asked me if I was a Methodist, a Baptist, a Pres-
</p>
<p>byterian, a Roman Catholic, and mentioned other faiths but did
</p>
<p>not ask me if I was a Mormon. I was glad to have the freedom
</p>
<p>of questioning him, which I would not have had if he had known
</p>
<p>my belief. At one remark of mine, he stated that my belief seemed
</p>
<p>to be something like the Mormon belief. As he did not suspect that
</p>
<p>I was a Mormon, I was able to ask him some questions and obtain
</p>
<p>answers freely; whereas he would not have volunteered the infor-
</p>
<p>mation he gave me had he known I was a Mormon.
</p>
<p>The opening of this conversation was by me asking him : "What
</p>
<p>do you know about the Mormons ?" He replied that he did not
</p>
<p>know very much about their belief, but stated that his grandmother
</p>
<p>Howe had once belonged to the Mormon church. Further question-
</p>
<p>ing disclosed the following information: Missionaries during the
</p>
<p>life of the Prophet Joseph Smith had found the Howe family in one
</p>
<p>of the settlements in the southern part of Illinois. Mrs. Howe
</p>
<p>joined the church and desired to go to Nauvoo. Her husband bit-
</p>
<p>terly objected to her gathering with the body of the church. As
</p>
<p>they had a large family he seemed to feel that if he left home she
</p>
<p>would not desert the children, which of course proved true ; but in
</p>
<p>his leaving home he joined himself to the mobs which were persecut-
</p>
<p>ing the saints. The statement of Seth Howe had a lasting impres-
</p>
<p>sion on me as he related : "My grandfather was one of the leaders
</p>
<p>of the mob which murdered Joe Smith." I questioned him further
</p>
<p>as to what became of his grandfather afterwards. He related that
</p>
<p>following the assassination of Joseph Smith his grandfather never
</p>
<p>saw a well day, although he lived for several years afterwards.
</p>
<p>His condition grew progressively worse and physicians of the day
</p>
<p>who called to attend him were unable to diagnose it as any known
</p>
<p>affliction, but his suffering w T as so intense that he frequently ex-

<p>pressed the desire to obtain poison to end it all. His family very
</p>
<p>carefully kept anything of that nature out of his reach and at his
</p>
<p>final demise he actually had rotted alive, finally dying in intense
</p>
<p>agony.

<p>A MOBOCRAT ROAMS WESTERN SHEEP RANGES
</p>
<p>By Thomas Nichols
</p>
<p>In the summer of 1887, 1 was herding sheep up in Bedue Creek,
</p>
<p>which empties into the Weber River, just below the lower bridge.
</p>
<p>One day a little boy about nine to eleven years of age, came to my
</p>
<p>camp. He was very dirty and shabbily dressed and was very shy.
</p>
<p>298 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>I noticed he was watching me very closely as I busied myself pre-
</p>
<p>paring my dinner. I asked him if he was hungry. He did not an-
</p>
<p>swer me, but in a few minutes he went to the creek and went
</p>
<p>through the motions of washing his hands. When he came back
</p>
<p>to the camp I looked at him and smiled at him. I then told him I
</p>
<p>would let him have some soap and a wash basin so he could give
</p>
<p>his face and hands a good wash. He looked at his hands and smiled
</p>
<p>at me ; took the articles mentioned and ran back to the creek. When
</p>
<p>he came back to me he was partly clean. When the dinner was
</p>
<p>ready I asked the blessing on it. The lad looked at me in wonder but
</p>
<p>as he did not speak a word I gave him a generous supply of fried
</p>
<p>potatoes, onions, lamb and bread. He ate it very quickly, got up
</p>
<p>and ran down the creek and was gone. In a few days he came
</p>
<p>again and made for the creek once more. This time he was not
</p>
<p>so shy. He gathered wood for the fire and brought water for the
</p>
<p>camp. He did not say a word until I had given him his dinner.
</p>
<p>Then he said very quietly, "Thank you." I asked him where he
</p>
<p>came from. He just pointed down to the river. I asked his name.
</p>
<p>He said : "Jim," and was gone again. He visited me several times.
</p>
<p>On one of his visits I asked him if he did not get enough to eat.
</p>
<p>His reply was: "Sometimes grandpa has some and sometimes he
</p>
<p>did not. Grandpa snares rabbits and catches fish but mostly his
</p>
<p>feet hurt him and he did not try." I gave him flour and mutton to
</p>
<p>take home with him. The next day he came again and asked if I
</p>
<p>had coffee. "Grandpa wants some and some tobacco." I explained
</p>
<p>to him that I did not use either one.
</p>
<p>I decided that I would visit the grandfather. I found him in
</p>
<p>an abandoned cabin situated in a grove of aspens. He was not very
</p>
<p>friendly. The little boy told him I was the man that sent the food
</p>
<p>to him. Then he came and sat down on a bench outside the cabin.
</p>
<p>I noticed that he had several bad sores on his face and that his hands
</p>
<p>were wrapped in rags. I asked him his name but he did not an-
</p>
<p>swer. He finally told me he was from the east and had drifted

<p>west. I asked him if he was a timber man or a prospector. He
</p>
<p>said, no. Then I asked him what was his object in coming to Utah
</p>
<p>and up here in the Weber canyon. He said: "I don't know. I just
</p>
<p>drifted here and this cabin was empty so I decided to stay a spell."
</p>
<p>After talking to him in a general way for a while I started to leave.
</p>
<p>He then asked me to give him some mutton tallow to put on his
</p>
<p>sores. I said, "Send the boy up and I will give him some." I noticed
</p>
<p>that the lower part of one ear was gone, a part of the left side of
</p>
<p>his nose had rotted away, and there were other repulsive sores on
</p>
<p>his face. He showed me his hands. There was very little solid
</p>
<p>flesh on them. I expressed my sympathy for him and he said his
</p>
<p>feet were worse than his hands. I asked him what had caused all
</p>
<p>this trouble and he replied : "I don't know unless it was a curse God
</p>
<p>had placed on me." He said some men had told him that was it, be-
</p>
<p>cause he was with the men who killed Joe Smith, the Mormon
</p>
<p>Prophet. "I guess that is the main reason I drifted out here; I
</p>
<p>wanted to know how the Mormons made out without Joe Smith to
</p>
<p>lead them."

<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 299
</p>
<p>THOMAS FORD
</p>
<p>Thomas Ford (Dec. 5, 1800-Nov. 3, 1850), governor of Illinois,
</p>
<p>was born in Fayette County, Pa. His father was Robert Ford, of a
</p>
<p>Maryland family. His mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of Hugh
</p>
<p>Logue and Isabella Delaney, both natives of Ireland. By a former
</p>
<p>marriage she was the mother of George Forquer, who by the time
</p>
<p>of his death in 1837 had risen to be the Jackson leader in Illinois.
</p>
<p>Robert Ford died in 1803, and the next year his widow removed first
</p>
<p>to St. Louis, then to New Design in the future Monroe County, 111.
</p>
<p>Despite the straitened circumstances of the family, Thomas Ford
</p>
<p>managed to get a common-school education. Later his half-brother
</p>
<p>helped him to spend a year at Transylvania University; then with
</p>
<p>the encouragement of Daniel P. Cook he studied law. After a term of
</p>
<p>practice in Waterloo, 111., he set up with Forquer in partnership at
</p>
<p>Edwardsville, 1825-29, and for the following six years, 1829-35, he
</p>
<p>served as state's attorney at Galena and Quincy, 111. On Jan. 14,
</p>
<p>1835, he was elected circuit judge by the state legislature, serving
</p>
<p>until Mar. 4, 1837, when he resigned to become judge of the Chicago
</p>
<p>municipal court. He was again elected circuit judge, Feb. 23, 1839.
</p>
<p>When the Democratic general assembly reorganized the state supreme
</p>
<p>court to swamp a Whig majority, he was elected to the court Feb.
</p>
<p>15, 1841, and held office till he resigned to run for governor in 1842.
</p>
<p>Ford apparently took no active part in politics until 1842. In the
</p>
<p>latter year the Whig and Democratic nominees for governor, Joseph
</p>
<p>Duncan and Adam W. Snyder, had long and vulnerable records
</p>
<p>to defend. The Democratic loss was therefore more apparent than
</p>
<p>real when Snyder died May 14, 1842. The leaders of the party turned
</p>
<p>to Ford, and after ten days' entreaty he consented to run. With no
</p>
<p>chance to gather ammunition for the election on August 1, the Whigs
</p>
<p>lost to Ford by a vote of 39,020 to 46,507. (T.C. Pease, Illinois Election
</p>
<p>Returns, 1923, p. 126.) At the end of his term, though he was asked
</p>
<p>to run against Douglas for the Senate, he resumed the practice of
</p>
<p>law at Peoria. Unfortunately he was overtaken by tuberculosis, and

<p>at his death in 1850 was virtually dependent on charity. His wife,
</p>
<p>Frances Hambaugh, whom he had married on June 12, 1828, was
</p>
<p>worn out by nursing him and died a few weeks before him. He left
</p>
<p>five children for whose financial benefit he had some time before begun
</p>
<p>his History of Illinois from its Commencement as a State in 1818 to
</p>
<p>1847. It was finally published under the auspices of James Shields
</p>
<p>in 1854.  Dictionary of American Biography (N.Y. Schribner's 1931),
</p>
<p>v. 6, pp. 520-521.
</p>
<p>"From this resume of public affairs we turn to Governor
</p>
<p>Ford's private and domestic concerns. Of his diffidence enough
</p>
<p>has been said. Ballance [Charles. History of Peoria, 1870, pp.
</p>
<p>254-55], who knew and was sharply critical of him, draws this
</p>
<p>picture of his personal characteristics: 'He was a small man with
</p>
<p>features indicating one from the lower rather than the upper
</p>
<p>walks of life. His nose was rather sharp and bent a little to one
</p>
<p>side. He was plain and unpretending in his manners. He was no
</p>
<p>orator in the common acceptance of the word; but what he said
</p>
<p>was to the point ... He reasoned well, not so much by any show
</p>
<p>of logic as by clever distinct statements. Though his mind was
</p>
<p>not far-reaching, it was never in a cloud. Whatever he saw, he
</p>
<p>saw clearly ... He was not religious in the common acceptance
</p>
<p>of the word; yet up to his forty-second year he lived as pure a
</p>
<p>life as any man I know/
</p>
<p>"The qualification is significant, for Ford's 'forty-second'
</p>
<p>year was the one in which he became governor. The same neigh-
</p>
<p>300 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>bor and critic relates that during his term in office 'the harpies
</p>
<p>about the capitol' led him into habits which hastened his death,
</p>
<p>and which he vainly strove to reform. These statements, if true,
</p>
<p>shed light upon the conditions, physical and otherwise, attending
</p>
<p>the writing of the History. At the expiration of his term as Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor in January, 1846, Ford retired to his father-in-law's farm
</p>
<p>to devote himself to this task, and mid-April, 1847, saw it prac-
</p>
<p>tically completed.
</p>
<p>"He had already planned to remove to Peoria to take up anew
</p>
<p>the practice of law. Peoria was one of the few even moderately
</p>
<p>sizable cities of Illinois, and Ford's long service as state's attorney
</p>
<p>and judge in northern Illinois had given him an extensive ac-
</p>
<p>quaintance throughout the entire region. Yet the story of his
</p>
<p>three year's sojourn there is one of unrelieved poverty and defeat,
</p>
<p>Mrs. Ford, afflicted with cancer, died October 12, 1850 at the
</p>
<p>early age of thirty-eight. Three weeks later, on November 3, he
</p>
<p>followed her to the grave.* Left behind were five orphaned chil-
</p>
<p>dren, penniless and of tender years, to face the world as best they
</p>
<p>might. "To the credit of common humanity, all were taken in
</p>
<p>charge by considerate townsmen, and reared in homes which were
</p>
<p>better than their own father could provide. In his closing weeks
</p>
<p>he had been an object of charity, and his funeral expenses were
</p>
<p>met by the gifts of a group of citizens."

<p>A testimony published in the latter part of 1874: "A lady
</p>
<p>was invited to attend a Methodist church at Peoria, Illinois, and
</p>
<p>noticing a rough box or coffin resting under the pulpit, inquired
</p>
<p>concerning it, and was informed that it enclosed the remains of
</p>
<p>the wife of ex-Governor Ford, and was supplied at the public ex-
</p>
<p>pense. Ford was present, and he looked gaunt and miserable, and

</p>
<p>his bones appeared ready to pierce through the skin. Two weeks
</p>
<p>later, the lady attended again, and was astonished to see a similar
</p>
<p>coffin in the same place. It contained all that was left of Governor
</p>
<p>Ford, who had for some time lived, and had now died, a pauper.
</p>
<p>The lady who saw this, though she had left the "Mormon" church,
</p>
<p>remembered hearing Elder John Taylor say in Nauvoo, that "Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Ford would live until the flesh would wither from his bones
</p>
<p>and he would die a pauper."
</p>
<p>Also, a few days after the appearance of the above notice, the
</p>
<p>following account of the tragic fate of Governor Ford's son,
</p>
<p>Thomas, appeared in print, and may be set down among the many
</p>
<p>cases where the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children:
</p>
<p>"Ford's children, in consequence of his poverty, were adopted

<p>*His death was commonly ascribed to tuberculosis. Ballance, however,
</p>
<p>writing in 1870, firmly insists that his relatively early demise was caused by
</p>
<p>the bad habits acquired at Springfield. Apparently this means over-indul-
</p>
<p>gence in liquor.

</p>
<p>by different citizens, Thomas being taken care of by Hon. Thos.
</p>
<p>E. Moore of Peoria. The young man served in the army, and after-
</p>
<p>wards moved to Kansas, where, with an elder brother, he fol-
</p>
<p>lowed various occupations, principally driving large herds of
</p>
<p>stock from the South.
</p>
<p>"Last July he was going to Caldwell and stopped at a ranch
</p>
<p>for refreshment. Here he was watched by two armed men, and,
</p>
<p>after proceeding about a mile, was suddenly seized by three men
</p>
<p>before he could defend himself. They took him for one of the
</p>
<p>cattle stealers, with which the state was infested, and, in spite of
</p>
<p>his protestations, prayers and appeals for an investigation, they
</p>
<p>proceeded to hang him to the limb of a tree. He told them he was
</p>
<p>the son of ex-Governor Ford, but they laughed him to scorn and
</p>
<p>refused to examine his papers." The Martyrs, pp. 109-10.
</p>
<p>THE UNKEPT GRAVE OF THOMAS FORD
</p>
<p>Last week an Illinois public man at the state capitol com-
</p>
<p>mented on the neglect shown to the grave of one who once was
</p>
<p>governor of the state and the Peoria Journal takes up the subject,
</p>
<p>describing how the ex-governor's grave, as well as the whole lot,
</p>
<p>in which rest his wife and youngest daughter, is uncared for. It
</p>
<p>says that all around it the grass has been carefully mown, and
</p>
<p>every lot in the vicinity has been kept in good order, but not a
</p>
<p>single touch has been bestowed upon the lot sacred to the memory
</p>
<p>of a former governor of the great state of Illinois. The cemetery
</p>
<p>authorities complained that no money had been given them for
</p>
<p>the purpose, and neither state nor city, nor any private citizen
</p>
<p>of state or city had furnished any money. About $60.00 is required
</p>
<p>as a fund to keep the loc in order. Occasionally there has been
</p>
<p>talk of raising a subscription for the purpose from the citizens
</p>
<p>of Peoria, but nobody has taken the initiative. Occasionally it
</p>
<p>has been proposed to secure an appropriation from the legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, but no one has felt sufficiently interested to take the matter
</p>
<p>in charge.

<p>The statement is made that it is proposed to secure such an
</p>
<p>appropriation at this session; but that meanwhile the cemetery
</p>
<p>authorities have remained obdurate, and have steadfastly refused
</p>
<p>to bestow a stroke of work upon the lot. Weeds, tall grass and
</p>
<p>brush have luxuriated thick and rank within the entire lot to an
</p>
<p>extent that renders it uncomfortable to walk about in it. Around
</p>
<p>the lot has grown a thick hedge of evergreen from ten to fifteen
</p>
<p>feet high, irregular and unkempt  never trimmed. Evergreen
</p>
<p>trees, higher than the hedge, stand on each side of the entrance.
</p>
<p>A still taller evergreen spreads its branches wide at the rear of
</p>
<p>the lot. From some points a glimpse of the top of the monu-
</p>
<p>ment, erected by the state at a cost of $500, can be obtained, but
</p>
<p>elsewhere nothing within the hedge is visible. Few people who
</p>
<p>drive or stroll along the avenue are aware that the remains of a
</p>
<p>former governor of Illinois reposes there. In such neglect have
</p>
<p>the people of Peoria allowed Thomas Ford's grave to remain.

<p>302 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>FATE PURSUES FAMILY OF GOV. FORD, ILLINOIS
</p>
<p>Peoria, 111., March 20. Without the last rites of the Church,
</p>
<p>and with only four mourners surrounding the grave, the body of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Anna Davies, who died a pauper in the Deaconess home in
</p>
<p>Lincoln, 111., Thursday, was buried here at twilight tonight.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Davies was the only surviving daughter of former Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Thomas Ford of Illinois, who likewise died in poverty.
</p>
<p>The spectre of poverty that has beset the family for half a
</p>
<p>century also found a victim in Mrs. Davies' only daughter, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Watson of Oskaloosa, la., who for weeks before her mother's death
</p>
<p>sought funds with which to purchase a coffin. Up to the time of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Davies' death the daughter had been unsuccessful in her
</p>
<p>quest, but following the demise citizens of Lincoln contributed
</p>
<p>enough to make possible the obsequies that took place tonight.
</p>
<p>It was while under the plighted protection of the state of
</p>
<p>of Illinois, as represented by Governor Ford, that the Prophet
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were murdered in Carthage
</p>
<p>jail, June 27, 1844. Elder John Taylor, who was with the martyrs
</p>
<p>at the time and was himself desperately wounded, gave utterance
</p>
<p>shortly afterwards to a prophecy concerning Governor Ford, the
</p>
<p>literal fulfillment of which in its utmost detail, is thus recorded.

<p>A TRUE PICTURE OF GOV. FORD
</p>
<p>By George Q. Cannon
</p>
<p>Even after the lapse of nearly thirty-six years, one can not
</p>
<p>read the history of the last days of Joseph Smith without a feel-
</p>
<p>ing of indignation rising towards the miserable creature who
</p>
<p>acted, at that time, as Governor of the State. Thomas Ford is a name
</p>
<p>that will live in history side by side with that of Pontius Pilate.
</p>
<p>He was an imbecile. A more pliant, short-sighted, weak tool could
</p>
<p>not have been found, to suit the purposes of the mob, if the
</p>
<p>country had been searched. He was full of pompous littleness,
</p>
<p>and the leaders of the mob humored his weak conceit. By this

</p>
<p>means, they used him, and he was more serviceable to them, with-
</p>
<p>out knowing their plans, than if they had explained them to him.
</p>
<p>Governor Ford was deaf to all reason. He was surrounded
</p>
<p>by apostates and the worst enemies of the Saints. On his arrival
</p>
<p>at Carthage, he had ordered the entire mob into service. He heard
</p>
<p>their imprecations and their threats, and saw their violence and
</p>
<p>outrageous conduct; but instead of being disgusted with them,
</p>
<p>they suited him. He adopted, as the truth, every lie and misrep-
</p>
<p>resentation that the mob circulated. The delegates, whom he
</p>
<p>wished the Mayor and City Council of Nauvoo to send to him, he
</p>
<p>treated with great rudeness. When they attempted to make the
</p>
<p>necessary statements and explanations, he suffered them to be
</p>
<p>interrupted and insulted by the vile crew who were his compan-
</p>
<p>ions. Even the communications which they brought were read to
</p>
<p>him in the presence of these villains, who frequently interrupted
</p>
<p>the reading by their cursing! Instructor, Vol. 15.

<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 303
</p>
<p>ANOTHER MURDERER'S END
</p>
<p>Elder James H. Moyle, writing from the Southern States, in
</p>
<p>August, 1881, says:
</p>
<p>"Bro. W. C. Burton and I met a citizen of North Carolina,
</p>
<p>named Brown, who claims to be one of the mob that committed
</p>
<p>the soul-destroying crime of shedding the innocent, unoffending
</p>
<p>blood of an anointed prophet of God. He says that he lived in
</p>
<p>Quincy, Illinois, and admits that it was a rich and productive
</p>
<p>country, but with all its charms he did not seem to have content-
</p>
<p>ment, as he has been wandering from place to place ever since,
</p>
<p>as though in search of an asylum for a troubled conscience. He is
</p>
<p>now settled in one of the poorest of poor districts, where he is so
</p>
<p>situated that he can go no farther, and where he is scarcely able
</p>
<p>to earn a subsistence.
</p>
<p>"During the extremely cold weather last winter, some of his
</p>
<p>little children were totally destitute of clothing. The neighbors,
</p>
<p>moved with compassion, collected some old clothes and necessaries
</p>

<p>"While we should be far, far from despising the poor for their

<p>A MOBOCRAT IN EARLY CALIFORNIA HISTORY
</p>
<p>Daniel Tyler, in his "History of the Mormon Battalion," in

<p>"Near the foreigners' burying ground resided a miserable

<p>specimen of humanity, who stole and begged from door to door.
</p>
<p>He was one of the most forlorn of human beings. He acknowl-

<p>edged to having been engaged in the Haun's Mill massacre, and

<p>begged our people to forgive him. He claimed to have been one

<p>of Fremont's party, and said he had been among the. Rocky Moun-
</p>
<p>tains for the last seven years."
</p>
<p>The following statement is furnished by Brother Joel Par-
</p>
<p>rish, of Centerville, Utah:
</p>
<p>"In March, 1877, in company with Elder Charles F. Middle-
</p>
<p>ton, I passed through Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois, enroute
</p>
<p>for St. Louis. We tarried there a sufficient length of time to visit
</p>
<p>the Carthage jail, where our lamented Prophet and Patriarch,
</p>
<p>Joseph and Hyrum Smith, were murdered. We visited a Mr.
</p>
<p>Browning, who then owned and occupied, as his family residence,
</p>
<p>the old rock building, or jail, where the prisoners referred to were
</p>
<p>confined. This building was no longer needed as a jail, a new and
</p>
<p>larger one having been built. Mr. Browning and lady entertained
</p>
<p>us over night, treated us very kindly, and stated that any of our
</p>
<p>Elders, passing through, would be welcome to be entertained by
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>304 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>"The room where the prisoners were murdered was, at that
</p>
<p>time, used as a parlor. We were taken therein and shown the
</p>
<p>arrangement of the room. The bullet hole in the door, made by
</p>
<p>the fatal ball that struck Hyrum Smith at the left side of the
</p>
<p>nose, had been filled with putty, but was plainly to be seen. There
</p>
<p>being a carpet on the floor, we could not see the bloodstains where
</p>
<p>the murdered Patriarch fell, but we were assured that they were
</p>
<p>still there. The stains of blood on the walls, also, were obscured,
</p>
<p>as the room had been white-washed. The jail had been painted
</p>
<p>and kept in good repair.
</p>
<p>"We were asked by Mr. Browning if we would like to see 'the
</p>
<p>wickedest man in Illinois/ having reference to the notorious Thos.
</p>
<p>C. Sharp, who was then publishing a paper in Carthage. We re-
</p>
<p>plied that we wpuld not object to seeing him without an intro-
</p>
<p>duction or being under any necessity of shaking his hand. With
</p>
<p>this understanding, we went with Mr. Browning to Sharp's office.
</p>
<p>Sharp was very courteous and polite, and showed signs of wishing
</p>
<p>to shake hands, a conjunction which we carefully avoided.
</p>
<p>"A few years previous to this time, Sharp had been a candi-
</p>
<p>date for office, and while the canvass was in progress, his op-
</p>
<p>ponent said, in a public speech: 'Sharp, you know if we had not
</p>
<p>sworn like h - - 1 for you, you would have been hung for the
</p>
<p>murder of the Smiths/
</p>
<p>"One of the Higbees (am not certain whether Chauncey or
</p>
<p>Francis) then resided fifteen or twenty miles east of Carthage.
</p>
<p>Mr. Browning stated that a gentleman in conversation with him
</p>
<p>asked if he ever felt any remorse of conscience for the part he
</p>
<p>took in the murder of the Smiths, to which Higbee replied: 'If
</p>
<p>you think I have not, look at my child/ The child referred to
</p>
<p>was then a young woman, grown, and, strange to behold, the en-
</p>
<p>tire left half of her face, on a line with the nose from the fore-
</p>
<p>head to the chin, was one red mass, as if it were fresh blood, warm
</p>
<p>and dripping. The left arm and hand were also in the same condi-

<p>tion. Higbee can see in his offspring the visible mark of God's
</p>
<p>judgment for his great sin."
</p>
<p>Elder Henry G. Boyle says:
</p>
<p>"While in California on a mission in the year 1855-56, and la-
</p>
<p>boring on the Russian River, near where Healdsburg now stands, I
</p>
<p>often heard of an old mobocrat by the name of Kogan, or Cougan,
</p>
<p>whe lived in that vicinity, and who boasted of having helped to mur-
</p>
<p>der Joseph and Hyrum Smith at Carthage. He often sent a request
</p>
<p>to me to visit him and proffered to tell me all about the manner
</p>
<p>of the death of our Prophet. A few months afterwards I heard
</p>
<p>that Mr. Cougan was stricken with some very singular disease.
</p>
<p>So peculiar was his case, that many people came to see him. He
</p>
<p>grew worse and worse, and lay for three months seemingly at the
</p>
<p>point of death. He suffered excruciatingly, and constantly prayed
</p>
<p>to die. He also begged his friends to put an end to his suffering,
</p>
<p>by taking his life, and even sought an opportunity to commit sui-
</p>
<p>cide, but was prevented by those waiting upon him. Many physi-
</p>
<p>cians visited him, and declared they never saw anything like his
</p>
<p>case.

<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 305

<p>"Many of the people in the neighborhood said : "If such is the

<p>Notary Public for North Carolina.

</p>
<p>Statement of Arthur S. Haymore on Belton
</p>
<p>(Dictated to the Compiler of this book, on Dec. 7, 1951, at Mesa, Arizona.)
</p>
<p>I was born in Payson, Utah, on Feb. 1, 1878. My parents were born at
</p>
<p>Mt. Airy, Surry County, North Carolina, my father, Franklin D. Haymore
</p>
<p>on Aug. 12, 1849, my mother, Lucinda Adeline Taylor born in 1852.
</p>
<p>Father was well acquainted with the Belton family. James Belton was
</p>
<p>a member of the mob that murdered the Prophet Joseph Smith, and after
</p>
<p>the murder he fled into North Carolina, located there and reared a family.
</p>
<p>306 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>He was in great poverty and could hardly keep the wolf from the door. When
</p>
<p>I was visiting that vicinity in 1939, I visited a neighbor of Belton who told
</p>
<p>me of Belton's illness. He said he died from a cancer in his eye and when
</p>
<p>his meals were brought to him, the pus from his eye would drop in his plate.
</p>
<p>He died a horrible death. I asked this neighbor if Belton ever discussed
</p>
<p>Mormonism or the tragedy of the Prophet's death, and he stated that Belton
</p>
<p>did not wish to talk about it, that he didn't boast or brag about the martyr-
</p>
<p>dom but was very sorry for what had happened.
</p>
<p>I made a special trip to hunt this neighbor up and learn what he might
</p>
<p>know about Belton.
</p>
<p>Statement of Elder James H. Moyle
</p>
<p>"In Mt. Airy, Surry Co., N. C, a man named Belton was point-
</p>
<p>ed out to me who claims to have taken a part in the same vile, fiend-
</p>
<p>ish crime, and seems to have fared a similar or worse fate, having
</p>
<p>been taken with something like the palsy. He is disabled for work
</p>
<p>of any importance, which renders him a perfect object of pity and
</p>
<p>charity.
</p>
<p>'These are the only men I ever saw who claim to be, or bear
</p>
<p>the name of being connected with those who slew the great latter-
</p>
<p>day Prophet and Patriarch, Joseph and Hyrum Smith. If these be
</p>
<p>fair examples of their kind, it certainly looks as though their sins
</p>
<p>were going before them to judgment." The Martyrs, p. 112.

<p>TO CALIFORNIA
</p>
<p>Mr. Burdow, the principal man at the Fort (Laramie) was a
</p>
<p>Frenchman. He cordially received President Young and his staff,
</p>
<p>invited them into his sitting-room, gave them information of the
</p>
<p>route, and furnished them with a flat-bottom boat on reasonable
</p>
<p>terms, to assist them in ferrying the Platte. Ex-Governor Boggs,
</p>
<p>who had recently passed with his company had said much against
</p>
<p>the Mormons, cautioning Mr. Burdow to take care of his horses
</p>
<p>and cattle. Boggs and his company were quarreling, many having
</p>
<p>deserted him; so Burdow told that old anti-Mormon that, let the
</p>
<p>Mormons be what they might, they could not be worse than himself
</p>
<p>and his men.
</p>
<p>"It is not a little singular that this extermination Governor
</p>
<p>of Missouri should have been crossing the Plains at the same time

</p>
<p>with the pioneers. They were going to carve out for their people
</p>
<p>a greater destiny than they could have reached either in Missouri
</p>
<p>or Illinois  he to pass away, leaving nothing but the infamy of
</p>
<p>his name.***
</p>
<p>"Fifteen miles from Laramie, at the Springs, a company of
</p>
<p>Missouri emigrants came up. The pioneers kept the Sabbath the
</p>
<p>next day; the Missourians journeyed. Another company of Mis-
</p>
<p>sourians appeared. *** The two Missouri companies kept up a war-
</p>
<p>fare between themselves on the route. They were a suggestive ex-
</p>
<p>ample to the Mormons. After they had travelled near each other
</p>
<p>for a week, on the Sunday following the President made this the
</p>
<p>subject of his discourse. He said of the two Missourian companies :
</p>
<p>" They curse, swear, rip and tear, and are trying to swallow
</p>
<p>up the earth ; but though they do not wish us to have a place on it,
</p>
<p>the earth might as well Open and swallow them up; for they will
</p>
<p>go to the land of forgetfulness, while the Saints, though they suf-
</p>
<p>fer some privations here, if faithful, will ultimately inherit the
</p>
<p>earth, and increase in power, dominion and glory.' "
</p>
<p>Life of Brigham Young, by Edw. W. Tullidge, pp. 163-5.
</p>
<p>In contrast to the deportment of the above swearing, quarreling,
</p>
<p>fighting, devils incarnate, read the following history of Saints of
</p>
<p>God who were hunting a new home, free from the Christian mon-
</p>
<p>ocracy of Missouri and Illinois, by Orson Pratt.
</p>
<p>"In the spring of 1847, eight of the Quorum of the Twelve, in
</p>
<p>company with one hundred and thirty-five others, left Council
</p>
<p>Bluffs on the Missouri River, as pioneers, to explore the great
</p>
<p>interior of the continent, and find a place suitable for the location
</p>
<p>of the Saints. We prepared ourselves with astronomical and other
</p>
<p>scientific instruments of English construction, viz. : One circle of
</p>
<p>reflection, two sextants, one quadrant, two artificial horizons, one
</p>
<p>large reflecting telescope, several smaller ones, two barometers,
</p>
<p>several thermometers, besides nautical almanacs, books, maps, etc.

<p>which the whole distance, as well as distance from place to place,
</p>
<p>were accurately measured. By the aid of these instruments, the
</p>
<p>latitudes and longitudes of the most prominent places upon ur
</p>
<p>route were obtained, as also their elevations above the sea. Mete-
</p>
<p>orological and geological observations were also taken throughout
</p>
<p>the whole journey. Geographical descriptions of the streams, riv-
</p>
<p>ers, lakes, plains, deserts, mountains, and vales, will also be found
</p>
<p>interspersed throughout the numerous journals kept by us. Botan-
</p>
<p>ical and Zoological observations were not forgotten by the scientific
</p>
<p>among us; and, indeed, the whole journey was rendered intensely
</p>
<p>interesting to the lovers of nature. New sceneries, grand and
</p>
<p>sublime beyond description, were constantly exhibiting themselves
</p>
<p>to our delighted vision. Mineral springs, caves, and numerous other
</p>
<p>natural curiosities, were found in abundance, which constantly
</p>
<p>excited the analyzing and cause-seeking powers of our chemists
</p>
<p>and natural philosophers. "

<p>308 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>DEPORTMENT OF MOBOCRATS CONTRASTED
</p>
<p>WITH SAINTS OF GOD
</p>
<p>From near the first of February to the first of March we were
</p>
<p>camped on Sugar Creek amid storms, the mercury at one time
</p>
<p>recording 20 degrees below zero. Yet there was a warm feeling in
</p>
<p>our hearts for we felt to trust in God. Even in the midst of tribula-
</p>
<p>tion, in a stormy winter's encampment, merry songs and happy
</p>
<p>voices were heard at every camp, and when the weather permitted
</p>
<p>all ages would join, inspired by sweet music, in the dance. At the
</p>
<p>signal for prayer, every occupation was suspended, and around the
</p>
<p>campfire, in wagons and tents, every knee was bowed, and a voice
</p>
<p>from every circle was raised in gratitude for past and in petition
</p>
<p>for continued protection.
</p>
<p>We left Sugar Creek about the first of March, with snow, sleet,
</p>
<p>rain and mud, often pitching tents on ground swimming with
</p>
<p>water and deep with mud. To picture the realities of our journey to
</p>
<p>Garden Grove, about two hundred miles, is beyond my capacity.
</p>
<p>One day, in the open prairie, without a road, and ground full of
</p>
<p>water, our mule's feet, like pegs, could find no bottom and could
</p>
<p>go no farther. So in the open, treeless prairie we were compelled to
</p>
<p>stay. The companies had all passed, and we were alone. In the
</p>
<p>carriage was a small sheet iron stove, but not a stick of wood. The
</p>
<p>evening was growing cold and snow began to fall. Here was a
</p>
<p>dilemma. Without fire, and something warm to eat, all would
</p>
<p>suffer through the night. Seeing no other way I emptied a large,
</p>
<p>valuable chest, highly prized, split it up with the hatchet, and soon
</p>
<p>had a warm supper; then in the freezing storm, we crowded into
</p>
<p>our wagon and remained through the night. Next morning Brother
</p>
<p>Weatherby went IV2 miles for a green elm pole, which, with a
</p>
<p>little of the chest, gave us fire for our breakfast. Soon some of
</p>
<p>the brethren returned to look after and help us, but the ground
</p>
<p>was now frozen hard enough to bear both wagon and mules. We
</p>
<p>only needed help to get our wagon wheels out of the deep, frozen

<p>mud, in which they had been sunk.
</p>
<p>Measles was now in camp, and when its fever was upon our
</p>
<p>two eldest, the water came so deep into the tent that our beds were
</p>
<p>soaked. A number of children died, among whom was one of
</p>
<p>Brother Bostwick's, a little girl about six years of age. Oh! how
</p>
<p>sorrowful to put her little form, as we did, in a grave half full of
</p>
<p>water, as no drier place could be found. Yet, with all this, there
</p>
<p>was hope and cheerfulness in the camp, and perhaps no company of
</p>
<p>equal size ever journeyed together with less faultfinding or murmur-
</p>
<p>ing. My Life's Review, by Benj. F. Johnson, pp. 110-111.

<p>THE FATE OF GOVERNOR REYNOLDS OF MISSOURI
</p>
<p>By Wilford Woodruff
</p>
<p>Governor Reynolds on one occasion employed men to try and
</p>
<p>kidnap Joseph and they almost accomplished their designs, but
</p>
<p>Joseph and some Gentile friends, as well as his brethren, through
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 309
</p>
<p>whom he was rescued, were taken to Nauvoo and released under a
</p>
<p>writ of habeas corpus. But the governor continued to harass him
</p>
<p>with writs, and was determined to destroy Joseph. Joseph and
</p>
<p>the Twelve went before God in prayer, Joseph kneeling before the
</p>
<p>Lord, offered up prayer, and asked God to deliver him from the
</p>
<p>power of that man. Among other things he told the Lord that he
</p>
<p>was innocent before Him and that his heart was heavy under the
</p>
<p>persecutions he endured. In about forty-eight hours from that
</p>
<p>time word reached Joseph that Reynolds had blown his brains out.
</p>
<p>Before perpetrating the deed he left a note on his desk stating, that
</p>
<p>as his services were not appreciated by the people of the state, he
</p>
<p>took that course to end his days.
</p>
<p>There is another instance that occurs to my mind. A certain
</p>
<p>man took a stand against Joseph, and endeavored to bring persecu-
</p>
<p>tion on him. Joseph went to his God and laid the matter before
</p>
<p>Him, asking to be delivered out of the hands and power of that
</p>
<p>wicked man. Joseph was a prophet, seer and revelator. He was
</p>
<p>acquainted with God ; he knew the voice of the Spirit when it spoke
</p>
<p>to him. After offering up his prayer, the whispering of the still
</p>
<p>small voice came to him, saying: "Wait with patience." The next
</p>
<p>day that man was taken sick with cholera, and died in a few hours.

<p>THE REMORSE OF A TRAITOR
</p>
<p>Abraham C. Hodge stated that he had some conversation with
</p>
<p>Robert D. Foster, who told him his feelings on the subject of

<p>Mormonism. He said, "Hodge, you are going to the west  I wish
</p>
<p>I was going among you, but it can't be so, I am the most miserable
</p>
<p>wretch that the sun shines upon. If I could recall eighteen months
</p>
<p>of my life I would be willing to sacrifice everything I have upon
</p>
<p>earth, my wife and chiid not excepted. I did love Joseph Smith
</p>
<p>more than any man that ever lived. If I had been present I would
</p>
<p>have stood between him and death." Hodge inquired, "Why did
</p>
<p>you do as you have done? You were accessory to his murder." He

<p>replied : "I know that, and I have not seen one moment's peace since
</p>
<p>that time. I know that Mormonism is true, and the thought of meet-
</p>
<p>ing (Joseph and Hyrum) at the bar of God is more awful to me
</p>
<p>than anything else." D.H.C., 7:513.

<p>FATE OF A CARTHAGE JAIL MOBOCRAT
</p>
<p>Sheriff Backenstos arrived in great haste and somewhat ex-
</p>
<p>cited, said that the mob had driven him from his house in Carthage
</p>
<p>yesterday, and he went to Warsaw and stayed over night. He soon

<p>ascertained that the people were so enraged at him for trying to
</p>
<p>stop the house-burning that there was little probability of getting
</p>
<p>away alive, but finally prevailed on an influential mobocrat to
</p>
<p>escort him out of Warsaw this morning, who came with him about
</p>
<p>three and a half miles and on leaving cautioned him that if he saw
</p>
<p>two men together to avoid them for there were deep plans laid to
</p>
<p>kill him. Soon after he was pursued by a party of the mob on
</p>
<p>310 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>horseback, three of whom took the lead, one of the three had a
</p>
<p>swifter horse and gained a hundred yards in advance of his party
</p>
<p>in a short time when his horse stumbled and threw his rider. Back-
</p>
<p>enstos maintained his speed, driving as fast as his horse could go.
</p>
<p>The mob took the nearest road to cross his track and on his
</p>
<p>arrival at the old railroad crossing, the mob were within about 200
</p>
<p>yards, they being on horseback and he in a buggy, they had gained
</p>
<p>on him considerably.
</p>
<p>Orrin P. Rockwell and John Redding were refreshing them-
</p>
<p>selves near the crossing as they had been out to bring in some of
</p>
<p>the burnt-out families who were sick, and on looking up saw
</p>
<p>Backenstos coming down the hill at full speed, and asked what was
</p>
<p>the matter. Backenstos replied the mob were after and determined
</p>
<p>to kill him and commanded them in the name of the people of the
</p>
<p>state to protect him. Rockwell replied, fear not, we have 50 rounds
</p>
<p>(two fifteen-shooter rifles besides revolvers) .
</p>
<p>Sheriff Backenstos then turned to the mob and commanded
</p>
<p>them to stop, and as they continued to advance raising their guns,
</p>
<p>he ordered Rockwell to fire; he did so aiming at the clasp of the
</p>
<p>belt on one of the mob, which proved to be Frank Worrell, who
</p>
<p>fell from his horse and the rest turned back and soon brought up
</p>
<p>a wagon and put his body into it. D.H.C., 6:446.
</p>
<p>ACQUITTAL OF SHERIFF BACKENSTOS FOR THE
</p>
<p>KILLING OF FRANK A. WORRELL
</p>
<p>News has arrived that Sheriff Backenstos, who went to Peoria
</p>
<p>in charge of Henry W. Miller, coroner of Hancock county, and was
</p>
<p>tried before Judge Purple on the charge of the 'murder' of Frank A.
</p>
<p>Worrell, was acquitted. The moral atmosphere around the judge
</p>
<p>was so different, than when at Carthage, that in all his charges
</p>
<p>and rulings, he appeared like another judge, and as though he had
</p>
<p>never been afflicted with mobocratic mania.
</p>
<p>The jury said if there had been no witnesses only on the part
</p>
<p>of the state, it would not have required more than two minutes to

<p>THE SUFFERING OF ONE OF THE ASSASSINS
</p>
<p>By Matilda C. Giauque Steed
</p>
<p>After the April Conference in Nauvoo, 1846, Thomas Steed
</p>
<p>(late of Farmington, Utah) then about twenty years of age, left
</p>
<p>the city with his uncle John Steed. His last dime was paid to the
</p>
<p>ferry-boat that landed him to the west bank of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>River, at Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa. There he found work at un-
</p>
<p>loading boats and received fifty cents the first night, the biggest
</p>
<p>money he had seen in the United States. He continued this work
</p>
<p>until he had saved $100.00. He found a home with his cousin
</p>
<p>Henry Steed, who had married as his second wife Miss Rebecca
</p>
<p>Reed at Nauvoo. Both were members of the Church, as well as
</p>
<p>his mother Ann Steed, and the family of James and Caroline Steed,
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 311
</p>
<p>all living at Keokuk. The three counsins had bought jointly a
</p>
<p>property of eighty acres of woodland and a quarry and worked
</p>
<p>together at building basements, furnishing their own lime and
</p>
<p>stone. They now lived on their land in two dwellings.
</p>
<p>One cold October morning, in 1846, Thomas went after the
</p>
<p>two oxen browsing in the Mississippi bottoms and was surprised
</p>
<p>to find a man whose clothes were white with frost, walking slowly
</p>
<p>among the trees. "Man, did you spend the night outside? I would
</p>
<p>have given you a place to sleep in my cabin." "I cannot stay any-
</p>
<p>where/' was the answer. "Why cannot you?" "I have a farm on
</p>
<p>the other side of the river, at Warsaw, as good as any farm, but
</p>
<p>I can't stay in it." "Tell me, why?" "I will tell you stranger:
</p>
<p>I was in that Smith scrape. Now I can rest nowhere. They pre-
</p>
<p>vailed on me to go with them. Would to God I had been a thousand
</p>
<p>miles away."
</p>
<p>Slowly, in the cold, alone and hungry, through the woods of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi bottoms, this remorseful murderer continued his
</p>
<p>march. That "Smith scrape," the tragedy of Carthage, was about
</p>
<p>28 months past. "I pitied him," said my husband.
</p>
<p>HOW SOME OF THE MISSOURI MOBOCRATS
</p>
<p>MET THEIR FATE
</p>
<p>By Andrew Jenson and Edward Stevenson
</p>
<p>On the morning of Monday, 10th, (September, 1888) we took
</p>
<p>a 15th Street cable car to the outskirts of the city (Independence,
</p>
<p>Missouri) from where we walked in a southeasterly direction to
</p>
<p>the Big Blue. The reader will remember that it was on this
</p>
<p>stream the Colesville branch and other Saints located in 1831,
</p>
<p>and that on the 2nd of August of the year mentioned Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith the Prophet, and eleven other men, in honor of the twelve
</p>
<p>tribes of Israel, carried and placed in position the first log for a
</p>
<p>house as a commencement for the building of Zion in this dis-
</p>
<p>pensation. The Big Blue is quite a large but sluggish stream
</p>
<p>which rises in Johnson county, Kansas, enters Jackson county,

</p>
<p>Missouri, from the west and then changes its course northward
</p>
<p>winding through the fields and farms about half way between
</p>
<p>Kansas City and Independence centers. In going up the hill travel-
</p>
<p>ing east, after having crossed the bridge over the Big Blue on the
</p>
<p>Westport and Independence road (a few hundred feet north of
</p>
<p>where the ferry over the Big Blue, mentioned in Church history,
</p>
<p>once was), we turned aside to an old farm house, where we hap-
</p>
<p>pened on an old Missouri mobocrat, who boasted of having been
</p>
<p>an enemy to the Mormons for over fifty years. Says he, "I was but
</p>
<p>a boy when the Mormons were expelled from Jackson county, but,
</p>
<p>by G-d, I was old enough to shoulder a gun and help drive them
</p>
<p>out."
</p>
<p>We asked him what the Mormons had done to the old settlers
</p>
<p>which merited so brutal a treatment, and especially wanted him
</p>
<p>to tell us his own personal experience with them. "0," says he, "they
</p>
<p>did not molest me, for I was so young, but they did others." He
</p>
<p>312 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>then related how one of the Saints claimed to have received a reve-
</p>
<p>lation authorizing him to steal another man's cow, and that the
</p>
<p>Missourian thus imposed upon retaliated by killing the Mormon,
</p>
<p>and this was the commencement of the hostilities between the
</p>
<p>Saints and the Missourians in Jackson county. Of course our knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of the true history of the affair prevented us from accepting
</p>
<p>the statement as true. We did not, however, consider it wise to
</p>
<p>enter into any argument with him, but proceeded to ask him other
</p>
<p>questions.
</p>
<p>He then informed us that old Col. Pitcher, who took an active
</p>
<p>part against the Saints in 1833, died about a year ago as a pauper.
</p>
<p>Not only did he die poor, but during his last days he was shunned
</p>
<p>and deserted by all. Even his own children neglected to care for
</p>
<p>him. It went so far that some of the neighbors proposed to take
</p>
<p>up a subscription in order to raise sufficient means to hire a negro
</p>
<p>from Kansas City to wait on him until he died; but before the
</p>
<p>darkey came he breathed his last in the midst of filth and misery.
</p>
<p>He was once a wealthy man, but during the late civil war his prop-
</p>
<p>erty was burned by the enemy and he was reduced to poverty. Thus
</p>
<p>he seemed to have received his just due for the cruel part he took in
</p>
<p>mobbing the Saints and burning their houses in 1833.
</p>
<p>It may be proper to state here that nearly every house on both
</p>
<p>sides of the Big Blue, the very section of country where about 200
</p>
<p>houses belonging to the Saints were burned in the beginning of
</p>
<p>1834  was destroyed during the guerrilla and bushwacker's cam-
</p>
<p>paign of terror in the time of the late civil war. It was a war be-
</p>
<p>tween neighbors and neighborhoods, and the whole section of coun-
</p>
<p>try was laid waste, so Mr. Mason informed us. His own house was
</p>
<p>burned with the rest.
</p>
<p>In answer to our inquiry he also told us that Moses Wilson,
</p>
<p>the old mobocrat general, notoriously known in the Missouri perse-
</p>
<p>cutions, died many years ago in Texas as a drunkard, gambler and
</p>
<p>genuine vagabond, despised by all who knew him.

</p>
<p>"What became of Samuel C. Owens who had so narrow an
</p>
<p>escape from drowning in the Missouri River while fighting the
</p>
<p>Mormons in 1834," we asked. "Sam Owens," replied Mr. Mason,
</p>
<p>"why, he was the only man killed in the battle with the Mexicans
</p>
<p>near the city of Chihuahua in 1846. He had just received bad news
</p>
<p>from home, informing him that his son-in-law had committed the
</p>
<p>crime of murder, and Mr. Owens felt so bad about it, that he im-
</p>
<p>mediately filled himself with brandy, plunged heedlessly into a
</p>
<p>hand-to-hand conflict with the Mexicans, during which he was
</p>
<p>killed, according to his own wish ; for he said before starting, that
</p>
<p>he wanted to go to hell at once, knowing, as he did, that he would
</p>
<p>have to go there some day anyway." Such was the fate of this old
</p>
<p>mobocrat, who persecuted the Saints so unmercifully during the
</p>
<p>Jackson and Clay county troubles.
</p>
<p>Mr. Mason, our informant, lives on a farm which once be-
</p>
<p>longed to the Saints. He is seventy-one years of age, and although
</p>
<p>he was bitter against the Saints, he seemed pleased with being
</p>
<p>able to point out to us the various bends on the Big Blue, where the
</p>
<p>humble log cabins of the Saints once stood. At several points there
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 313
</p>
<p>are still remnants to be found of the chimneys and foundations,
</p>
<p>but not a single house is known to be in existence. The residence
</p>
<p>of Brother Joshua Lewis, in which the Church held its fifth Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Conference, August 4, 1831, crumbled to pieces years ago.
</p>
<p>That was one of the few buildings not burned by the mob at the
</p>
<p>time of the exodus, but it was partly torn down. Mr. Mason also
</p>
<p>told us where the skirmish took place between the Saints and the
</p>
<p>mob, November 4, 1833, when Andrew Barber and two of the mob
</p>
<p>were killed.
</p>
<p>In alluding to himself the old man, whom we considered a fair
</p>
<p>sample of many of those who drove the Saints out of Jackson
</p>
<p>county in 1833, informed us that he had no education, "I can't read
</p>
<p>a word," said he, "I only went to school three weeks in my life,
</p>
<p>during which time I got nine lickings and quit."
</p>
<p>After we left, Mr. Mason remarked to a neighbor: 'They
</p>
<p>(meaning your correspondents) asked me about these men (allud-
</p>
<p>ing to the mobbers), and as I did not want to lie to them I told
</p>
<p>them the truth. These strangers, even if they were d-d Mormons,
</p>
<p>possessed one redeeming quality  they were Democrats." On our
</p>
<p>merits as Democrats he gave us all the buttermilk we could drink
</p>
<p>and wished us success. * * *
</p>
<p>Last evening (Sept. 10, 1888), we were taken in a conveyance,
</p>
<p>by our friend, Elder George P. Frisbey of the Hedrickite church, to
</p>
<p>fill our appointment in their meeting house on the Temple lot. Our
</p>
<p>journey was over rolling land, with fields and forests intermingled,
</p>
<p>forming a picture worthy of Zion's borders, on which we truly
</p>
<p>were. Farms containing hundreds of acres of beautiful land, the
</p>
<p>homes of the Saints more than half a century ago, were pointed
</p>
<p>out to us ; also the residence of the late Col. Pitcher, standing on a
</p>
<p>hill about four miles southwest of Independence, on the Westport
</p>
<p>and Independence Road, where the colonel resided for fifty years
</p>
<p>on a beautiful plantation which subsequently passed away from
</p>
<p>him. We also learned the fate of another notorious and leading

</p>
<p>mobocrat, Mr. A. E. Hickman, known as Captain Hickman, once
</p>
<p>a government surveyor, who took an active part in driving the
</p>
<p>Saints from their homes in 1833. His possessions were pointed out,
</p>
<p>and his wealth boasted of as that of a possessor of broad fields.
</p>
<p>"But," said our informant, "he died in that little cabin on yonder
</p>
<p>hill in 1882, in the midst of grief and poverty."
</p>
<p>THE JAIL WHERE JOSEPH THE PROPHET
</p>
<p>REBUKED THE GUARDS
</p>
<p>This morning (September 13, 1888) we visited a number of
</p>
<p>old settlers trying to gather information in regard to circumstances
</p>
<p>transpiring fifty years ago. We visited the site of the old jail where
</p>
<p>Parley P. Pratt, Morris Phelps and others were imprisoned from
</p>
<p>November, 1838, to May, 1839. An old resident told us that he
</p>
<p>remembered many years afterwards seeing the name of P. P. Pratt
</p>
<p>on the ceiling of the jail, which was finally torn down and the site
</p>
<p>is now occupied by a large wagon repairing and blacksmith shop
</p>
<p>owned by Messrs. Powell & Sons. On the identical spot where the
</p>
<p>314 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>jail stood is a well from which we drew and drank water in memory
</p>
<p>of the past. The jail site is a little more than half a block east of
</p>
<p>the northeast corner of the court-house square, on the south side
</p>
<p>of the street. We made several inquiries about the old log house,
</p>
<p>where Joseph the Prophet and fellow-prisoners were guarded dur-
</p>
<p>ing Judge Austin A. King's trial in November, 1838, and where
</p>
<p>Joseph rebuked the guard; but we were unable to find any who
</p>
<p>could give us the necessary information. One old settler, Mr. B. H.
</p>
<p>Quesenberry, who acted as county clerk of Ray County in 1838,
</p>
<p>told us that there were a number of old log houses on the north
</p>
<p>side of the court-house square at that time, and it was no doubt
</p>
<p>into one of these that the Prophet and his brethren were usherd
</p>
<p>on that memorable occasion.
</p>
<p>We have also learned that General John B. Clark, the notorious
</p>
<p>mobocrat, died as a drunkard in Fayette, Howard county, about
</p>
<p>the year 1880, forsaken by his political friends at least. The no-
</p>
<p>torious Austin A. King also died years ago. He was taken sick
</p>
<p>very suddenly at St. Louis and died almost immediately. His re-
</p>
<p>mains were brought to Ray county for burial. ****
</p>
<p>(September 16, 1888). The region around Shoal creek, where
</p>
<p>Haun's Mill stood, is much heavier timbered than it was fifty
</p>
<p>years ago, and a fine grove of locust trees now covers the site of
</p>
<p>old "Mormontown." A resident of Kingston, who yesterday pointed
</p>
<p>out to us a number of farms once owned by the Saints, said, that
</p>
<p>in going through Caldwell county, he could always distinguish the
</p>
<p>old Mormon homesteads from all others. We asked him to describe
</p>
<p>to us the difference between Mormon farms and others. "Well," said
</p>
<p>he, "nearly every one of the Mormons planted locust trees around
</p>
<p>their buildings which was something the Missourians never thought
</p>
<p>of doing, and these have now grown and spread, until there are
</p>
<p>locusts groves on nearly every farm where the Mormons resided."
</p>
<p>Nearly all who participated in the massacre are now dead, or

</p>
<p>have moved away, so that their whereabouts, if alive, are not
</p>
<p>known. Some of the murderers have died in disgrace and shame,
</p>
<p>haunted by their consciences until their last hours. Others have
</p>
<p>boasted of their dastardly deeds, until they have been smitten
</p>
<p>with sickness and misery, in the midst of which they would curse
</p>
<p>God and die.
</p>
<p>The notorious Col. Wm. 0. Jennings, who commanded the mob
</p>
<p>at the massacre, was assassinated in Chilicothe, Livingston county,
</p>
<p>Mo., in the evening of Jan. 30, 1862, by an unknown person, who
</p>
<p>shot him on the street with a revolver or musket as the colonel
</p>
<p>was going home after dark. He died the next day in great agony.
</p>
<p>The shooting occurred in Calhoun street, a little northwest of the
</p>
<p>present county jail in Chilicothe. Nehemiah Comstock, another
</p>
<p>leader of the mob who committed the murders, expired years ago
</p>
<p>in Livingston county, as a good-for-nothing drunkard. His mother
</p>
<p>was also a drunkard and died a pauper and in the midst of misery
</p>
<p>in a Kentucky poor house.
</p>
<p>Thomas S. Brockman, one of the principal mob leaders in 1846,
</p>
<p>came to a miserable end in Kansas, whither he removed from
</p>
<p>Mount Sterling, Adams county, Illinois, after trying in vain to be
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 315
</p>
<p>elected to office in Hancock county, He was killed during a quarrel,
</p>
<p>in which he was the attacking party, in 1872. Francis Higbee died
</p>
<p>in New York, his brother in Pittsfield, Pike county, Illinois. Robert
</p>
<p>D. Foster went to California and has not since been heard of by
</p>
<p>our informants. William and Wilson Law are supposed to be alive
</p>
<p>yet, as they both visited Nauvoo a few years ago, trying to sell
</p>
<p>their claims on the islands in the Mississippi River, near Nauvoo.
</p>
<p>All these will be remembered by the Saints as the parties who,
</p>
<p>more than any others, were the means of bringing about the mar-
</p>
<p>tyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum. Levi Williams, the principal leader
</p>
<p>of the Carthage Jail murderers, died at his home in Green Plains,
</p>
<p>about the year 1858. John McAuley, a notorious mobocrat, died a
</p>
<p>most miserable death about the year 1872. While lying on his death
</p>
<p>bed, suffering the most excruciating pains, he told Mr. Morrill, our
</p>
<p>informant, that if he could only blot out five years of his life (re-
</p>
<p>ferring to the time he fought the Mormons), he could die a happy
</p>
<p>man. Mr. Morrill said that a great number of the old mobocrats
</p>
<p>came to a miserable end, and he did not remember a single one of
</p>
<p>them who ever amounted to anything after having persecuted the
</p>
<p>Saints. On the other hand, we heard of several of those who took
</p>
<p>an active part in defending the Saints who have since occupied
</p>
<p>various positions of honor and trust. Prominent among them we
</p>
<p>may mention Mr. Morrill himself, who has always been on the side
</p>
<p>of justice and right, and took an active part legally in defending
</p>
<p>a number of the brethren in times of their trouble ; he has served
</p>
<p>ten years as mayor of Nauvoo and several terms in the Illinois
</p>
<p>legislature.
</p>
<p>Our letter would be too long if we should relate what we
</p>
<p>learned in regard to the Jack-Mormons, the French Icarians, who
</p>
<p>purchased the walls of the Temple, after the building was burned
</p>
<p>by the hands of an incendiary, and others who have figured in the
</p>
<p>history of Nauvoo since the Saints were forced to leave. Suffice it

<p>to say that shortly after the exodus and after most of the so-called
</p>
<p>Jack-Mormons got discouraged and moved to other parts, the popu-
</p>
<p>lation of Nauvoo was reduced to about 300 souls, and property sold
</p>
<p>for almost a song. To illustrate, we will simply state that a Mr.
</p>
<p>Reimbold, father of our informant, who came to Nauvoo in 1848,
</p>
<p>bought a fine two-story house  hewed logs at that  with floors
</p>
<p>and everything complete, for the sum of $4. The present German
</p>
<p>population, who have come to stay, have done better than any of
</p>
<p>their predecessors since the Saints left, but even they cannot make
</p>
<p>it a place of any importance. No, that is reserved for "others" to
</p>
<p>do, and even these "others" can not do it till the Lord's time comes.

<p>town of Nauvoo stood. I could not help the feeling of awe that crept
</p>
<p>over me, as house after house was pointed out to me where the
</p>
<p>down-trodden, robbed, driven, and murdered servants of God once
</p>
<p>lived, among them being the house of the great latter-day Prophet,
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith. The houses that are remaining, which the Saints
</p>
<p>built, are among the best average buildings of today.
</p>
<p>I registered at the Arlington hotel, from Salt Lake City, and
</p>
<p>I soon made my business known, and was introduced to an old
</p>
<p>gentleman who lived here in the times of trouble, by the name of
</p>
<p>Thomas E. Kelley, who received me very kindly and spared no
</p>
<p>pains in giving me all the information he could command. We
</p>
<p>visited all the houses of note now standing, and I carefully made
</p>
<p>note of the history of each, as given by him. He condemned with
</p>
<p>the most severe emphasis the way the Mormons had been treated.
</p>
<p>He said he was only a boy then, but was eye witness to "Jack-Mor-
</p>
<p>mons stealing from parties and hiding it upon the places of Mor-
</p>
<p>mon leaders, and then going to the parties whom they had stolen
</p>
<p>from and telling them they'd bet the Mormon leaders had them."
</p>
<p>I next called at the Nauvoo Rustler printing office, and gained
</p>
<p>what information I could of the present feeling toward the Mor-
</p>
<p>mons. The people here universally acknowledge the mis(\e of
</p>
<p>those who drove the Mormons, and agree that it was one of the
</p>
<p>most wicked things that ever happened. With an expressive sigh
</p>
<p>they tell of the time when Nauvoo had about 22,000 inhabitants,
</p>
<p>while Chicago at that time had 12,000 inhabitants. Nauvoo then,
</p>
<p>they are careful to remark, had no saloons; now with about 1,200
</p>
<p>inhabitants it has several saloons.
</p>

<p>the Mormons, I departed for Carthage, having to recross the river
</p>
<p>and take train to Keokuk, la., and from there to Carthage. I regis-
</p>
<p>tered at the Grove hotel, made my business known, and was soon
</p>
<p>introduced and kindly received by the people. I called at the place
</p>
<p>where the Prophet and Patriarch were killed, and found that I had
</p>
<p>learned more about the building in a moment's view than I had
</p>
<p>ever found out by reading. The place is now used for a dwelling,
</p>
<p>and the kind old lady is very hospitable in showing strangers
</p>
<p>through the house and giving liberally of her beautiful selection
</p>
<p>of flowers. I also secured a piece of stone from the building.
</p>
<p>I next called on Sergeant Williams. I found him still bitter in
</p>
<p>his epithets toward the man whom he "saw killed." He said : "We
</p>
<p>all wanted him killed; we held a meeting the night before and de-
</p>
<p>cided to kill him. We loaded our cartridges blank, and agreed upon
</p>
<p>the plan carried out." He then continued to say that "Joe Smith
</p>
<p>was a bad man ; he taught the people to steal. One of his teachings
</p>
<p>I remember now was: The earth is the Lord's and the fulness
</p>
<p>thereof, therefore take whatsoever seemeth you good.' Such doc-
</p>
<p>trine as that would make bad people." So Williams went on. He then
</p>
<p>asked me where I was from. I told him from Salt Lake City. He
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 317
</p>
<p>would not tell me any more, and was seized with such a violent
</p>
<p>shivering and shaking, that his daughter politely asked me if I
</p>
<p>would not defer further conversation.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Williams, as he calls himself, lives in about the poor-
</p>
<p>est house in Carthage. The forest trees, in their native wildness,
</p>
<p>remain with the greatest possible dullness, and everything, both
</p>
<p>within and without, bears the frown of a just God.
</p>
<p>I found people in both of these towns who would look at the
</p>
<p>Views of Salt Lake City, which I had with me, and with moisture
</p>
<p>in their eyes express : "Surely the Lord is with these people or they
</p>
<p>could not endure and accomplish what they do."

<p>A MOBOCRAT BURIED IN THE OCEAN
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, May 24, 1864, we sailed second cabin on the bark
</p>
<p>Onward, Hempstead, captain. Brother Cluff and I occupied one
</p>
<p>room with a Missourian named McCarty, said to be suffering with
</p>
<p>consumption. He was a large, raw-boned man, of a quarrelsome
</p>
<p>disposition.
</p>
<p>One day Captain Hempstead invited us three to have seats on
</p>
<p>the upper deck with the first-cabin passengers. The reason for this
</p>
<p>courtesy was soon apparent. Among the cabin passengers were
</p>
<p>several ministers ; and they wanted a little diversion at the expense
</p>
<p>of the Mormon Elders.
</p>
<p>A warm discussion ensued. It was asserted that the Mormons
</p>
<p>were driven from Missouri and Illinois on account of their thieving
</p>
<p>and lawless acts. In my defense I challenged the proof of a single
</p>
<p>dishonest deed, and testified that Joseph and Hyrum were inno-
</p>
<p>cent, and that they were murdered in cold blood. Mr. McCarty be-
</p>
<p>came angry, and boasted that he helped kill Joseph and Hyrum
</p>
<p>Smith. I told him then that by his own confession he was a mur-
</p>
<p>derer, and that the curse of God was upon him. He would have
</p>
<p>struck me, but the captain interfered, and made him behave.

<p>About midnight of the 30th of May, I was awakened by Mc-
</p>
<p>Carty. He was sitting on a stool, in front of his bunk; the full
</p>
<p>moon shining through the window, giving him a white, ghastly
</p>
<p>appearance. He told me to get up and get him a drink. I replied
</p>
<p>that the guard passed the door every five minutes and would wait
</p>
<p>upon him. He seized a butcher knife, sprang to his feet, and swore
</p>
<p>he would cut the heart out of me. I was lying in the middle bunk
</p>
<p>and had but little room in which to move, and nothing with which
</p>
<p>to defend myself ; but I felt I would rather die than do his bidding.
</p>
<p>I therefore silently asked God to deliver me from his power.
</p>
<p>He took one step forward, threw up both hands, and fell back-
</p>
<p>wards. I sprang from the bunk, and raised his head, but the man
</p>
<p>was dead. Brother Cluff called the guard, who soon brought the
</p>
<p>captain and the doctor. The latter said he died of heart failure.
</p>
<p>In the morning they sewed him up in a canvas, a cannon ball
</p>
<p>at his feet. I stood by the taffrail, and saw the body slide off the
</p>
<p>plank; and as I watched it sink into the depths of the ocean, I
</p>
<p>rejoiced that I had borne a faithful testimony of God's martyred
</p>
<p>318 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS

<p>the hands of a wicked man. Memoirs of John R. Young, pp. 129-130.
</p>
<p>ANOTHER MURDERER GOES TO HIS REWARD
</p>
<p>A telegram from Carthage, Illinois, brings the news that on
</p>
<p>the night of Monday, April 9, (1894), Thomas Coke Sharp, editor
</p>
<p>and proprietor of the Carthage Gazette, died at his home at that place,
</p>
<p>from paralysis, from which he had suffered the past three years.
</p>
<p>The Deseret News gives the following additional information of the
</p>
<p>life of this man:
</p>
<p>The deceased was the son of a noted Methodist minister, Rev.
</p>
<p>Solomon Sharp, of Philadelphia, and was in the 76th year of his
</p>
<p>age at the time of his demise. He was a native of New York, hav-
</p>
<p>ing been born at Mt. Holly, September 25, 1818. He came west and
</p>
<p>settled in Quincy, Illinois, and engaged in the practice of law.
</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, in the summer of 1840, he moved to Warsaw,
</p>
<p>Hancock County. He became associated in business with James
</p>
<p>Gamble, and together they purchased from Daniel N. White the
</p>
<p>Western World, of which Sharp became editor. A year later the
</p>
<p>name of the paper was changed to the Warsaw Signal, and for a
</p>
<p>number of years it was the only paper published in Hancock County,
</p>
<p>outside of Nauvoo. In later years Mr. Sharp became the editor of
</p>
<p>the Carthage Gazette.
</p>
<p>The chief interest of the people of Utah in Thomas C. Sharp
</p>
<p>arises from the fact that they and others have had to regard him
</p>
<p>as one of the murderers of the Prophet Joseph and the Patriarch
</p>
<p>Hyrum Smith, at Carthage jail, June 27, 1844. Perhaps the last
</p>
<p>Utah man to visit and converse with him was Sheriff Gilbert Bel-
</p>
<p>nap, of Ogden. He stated at the time that Sharp was an invalid,
</p>
<p>and his mind impaired. He was non-communicative on the subject
</p>
<p>of the assassination, particularly the part he played in it, but
</p>
<p>Sheriff Belnap believes that at the time of his visit Sharp would
</p>
<p>have told all he remembered if his wife would have allowed it, but
</p>

</p>
<p>this she would not do. When Sharp came into Hancock County there
</p>
<p>was some anti-"Mormon" agitation and he entered into it with
</p>
<p>ardor. He was ambitious for political preferment and was wholly
</p>
<p>unscrupulous in measures to gain his ends. He published in his
</p>
<p>paper the most infamous falsehoods against the Latter-day Saints.
</p>
<p>All through those troublous times the columns of the Signal were
</p>
<p>replete with vicious articles inciting and urging violence toward
</p>
<p>the "Mormon" people. Thomas C. Sharp had murder in his heart
</p>
<p>then and later availed himself of the opportunity to imbrue his
</p>
<p>hands in the blood of innocence. He was denounced by the sheriff
</p>
<p>of the county as "a villain of the worst dye." In connection with
</p>
<p>his associates he was instrumental in inflaming public prejudice
</p>
<p>to the extent that meetings were held, the first of them at Warsaw,
</p>
<p>in which resolutions were passed declaring that in the opinion of
</p>
<p>those participating the time had arrived when the "Mormons," as
</p>
<p>a body, should be driven from the surrounding settlements into
</p>
<p>Nauvoo ; that the Prophet and his miscreant adherents should then
</p>
<p>be demanded at their hands, and if not surrendered a war of ex-
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 319
</p>
<p>termination should be waged to their entire destruction. Sharp was
</p>
<p>an ardent advocate of the murderous policy.
</p>
<p>This situation was known at the time, as may be seen by the
</p>
<p>following from the diary of the Prophet Joseph, though the people
</p>
<p>did not realize the full import of the ominous proceedings. The
</p>
<p>Prophet says, under date of June 18, 1844:
</p>
<p>"About 2 p.m., the Legion was drawn up in the street close
</p>
<p>by the mansion. I stood in full uniform on the top of the frame of a
</p>
<p>building. Judge Phelps read the Warsaw Signal extra of the 17th,
</p>
<p>wherein the 'old citizens' were called upon to assist the mob in
</p>
<p>exterminating the leaders of the Saints and driving away the
</p>
<p>people."
</p>
<p>Thomas C. Sharp was one of the attorneys engaged as prose-
</p>
<p>cuting counsel when the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum
</p>
<p>were placed under arrest. Knowing that they were innocent of any
</p>
<p>crime, and that if the case proceeded to trial acquittal must follow,
</p>
<p>he joined with others in carrying out the mobocratic design. He
</p>
<p>was a leader in the murderous conspiracy, and conducted the ne-
</p>
<p>gotiations by which it was arranged that the mob should get pos-
</p>
<p>session of the jail unopposed. When the assault took place he was
</p>
<p>one of the participants. The readers of the News will remember
</p>
<p>that a few weeks ago there was present in this city Col. M. B. Dar-
</p>
<p>nell, of Iowa, who was an eye-witness to the shooting at Carthage.
</p>
<p>A relative of his, a young man who was with the mob, names Sharp
</p>
<p>as one of the persons who engaged in the actual shooting. He was
</p>
<p>indicted with others, but all were acquitted by a jury selected, as
</p>
<p>was well understood by the people then, and as testified to by Col.
</p>
<p>Darnell from personal knowledge, from among the mobocrats them-
</p>
<p>selves.
</p>
<p>No language can make the crime in which Thomas Coke Sharp
</p>
<p>was a leading participator appear more heinous than it is. He has
</p>
<p>gone to his final account, where he will receive from a just Judge

<p>that reward which his works merit. The people of Utah are satis-
</p>
<p>fied to let the matter rest there. The Neivs refers on this occasion
</p>
<p>to the awful tragedy of June 27, 1844, because it feels it to be a
</p>
<p>solemn duty to make the record in connection with the passing
</p>
<p>from mortality of one of the men chiefly responsible for the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation of the Prophet and Patriarch. Millennial Star, 56:349-350,

<p>THOSE RESONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THE
</p>
<p>PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH
</p>
<p>By Orson Pratt
</p>
<p>The word concerning the driving of the people from Illinois,
</p>
<p>westward to the Rocky Mountains, in the article of the treaty got
</p>
<p>up by the mobocrats, was that "we must not stop short of the
</p>
<p>Rocky Mountains, but that we must go beyond them." Were any
</p>
<p>lives lost in those terrible persecutions, or was it merely property
</p>
<p>taken away from the Saints, without paying them a cent, in the
</p>
<p>shape of thousands of acres of land which they had paid the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment for, and comfortable houses ? If it had been only our houses
</p>
<p>320 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>and lands it would have been bad enough; but lives were taken 
</p>
<p>innocent men, women and children were shot down. I might go on
</p>
<p>and relate some of the circumstances, but I dislike to dwell on the
</p>
<p>subject; it is apt to kindle up old nature in one's heart, therefore
</p>
<p>I will leave that topic. Suffice it to say that the blood of hundreds
</p>
<p>and I might almost say thousands, will be required at the hands
</p>
<p>of this nation unless the people repent.
</p>
<p>Where is our prophet who translated this book (the Book of
</p>
<p>Mormon), that noble youth whom God raised up when only be-
</p>
<p>tween fourteen and fifteen years of age, Where is that noble boy
</p>
<p>to whom God sent His angel, and to whom He gave the Urim and
</p>
<p>Thummim, and to whom He entrusted the original golden plates
</p>
<p>from which this book was translated. He fell a martyr to his re-
</p>
<p>ligion under this free Government of the United States. Where is
</p>
<p>the Patriarch of our Church, the brother of our Prophet? He too,
</p>
<p>was shot down at the same time. By whom? By people who were
</p>
<p>painted black, for the occasion, and who boasted of their bloody
</p>
<p>deeds in Hancock county, Illinois. Some of them are still alive in
</p>
<p>that county, and to this day boast of their bloody deeds in perse-
</p>
<p>cuting the Latter-day Saints.
</p>
<p>Many scores of our people were wasted away, and their blood
</p>
<p>soaks the soil of this great government, crying aloud to the
</p>
<p>heavens for vengeance on those who shed the blood of the martyrs,
</p>
<p>and who persecuted God's people and sent them forth, as they sup-
</p>
<p>posed, to perish in the heart of the Great American Desert. Not
</p>
<p>only will they who committed these deeds be brought to judgment,
</p>
<p>but those also who stood back behind the screen and said: "How
</p>
<p>glad I am, Joe Smith is now dead, the Mormon Patriarch Hyrum
</p>
<p>Smith is shot down, and we have killed many of their followers,
</p>
<p>men, women and children. They have been driven five times from
</p>
<p>their locations and settlements and been robbed of millions of dol-
</p>
<p>lars worth of property and we are enjoying it, and it is all right.

<p>Joe Smith ought to have been killed before, long ago."
</p>
<p>This seemed to be the feeling of a great many people in the
</p>
<p>American nation. They sanctioned the shedding of innocent blood,
</p>
<p>if they did not actually shed it themselves, and God will require
</p>
<p>it at their hands. Will He require anything at the hands of our
</p>
<p>nation, in a national capacity, in regard to this matter? Was it not
</p>
<p>within their power to protect us on the lands which we purchased
</p>
<p>from the General Government? We did not purchase, to any extent,
</p>
<p>land from the Missourians, but we took up land that belonged to
</p>
<p>the General Government. We paid our money into that government
</p>
<p>land office. Did they protect us in the possession of that land,
</p>
<p>which they guaranteed by their deeds to us and our seed or heirs
</p>
<p>for ever? They did not. Did they protect us in our citizenship? No,
</p>
<p>they did not. Did we appeal to them for protection? Yes, we laid
</p>
<p>our case before them. What was their reply? Martin Van Buren,
</p>
<p>who sat at the head of the government at that time, said : "Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you." He saw
</p>
<p>the testimony ; there was no getting away from it.

<p>Excerpts from daily diary of Alonzo Winters who was a Mor-

<p>cent territory during the year 1876-1877.
</p>
<p>Tuesday, December 6, 1876 : Went with Aunt Lucinda to visit
</p>
<p>a woman, a member of the Church by the name of Herbey. She had
</p>
<p>been sick for a long time. She told me of two men, residents of
</p>
<p>Alexandria, that were engaged in the martyrdom of Joseph and
</p>
<p>Hyrum  John Johnston and a man by the name of Frazier John-
</p>
<p>ston, the first died a prisoner at the hands of the rebels during the
</p>
<p>rebellion, perished with the cold. The other, Frazier, still lives
</p>
<p>here. A man by the name of Bledsaw who is believed to have beer?
</p>
<p>in that scrape, and who is known to have been in the mob who
</p>
<p>drove and plundered the Saints in Nauvoo, froze to death in a corn
</p>
<p>shock.
</p>
<p>Today I listened to some horrid recitals of murders that were
</p>
<p>committed in Missouri during the Rebellion. In one case where a
</p>
<p>leading man near here was missing; the Union soldiers arrested
</p>
<p>twelve peaceable citizens and gave them 24 hours to produce the
</p>
<p>man or be led out and shot. The man not being found in time, the
</p>
<p>poor farmers were led out and shot with the exception of one old
</p>
<p>man with a large family. A noble young man volunteered to save
</p>
<p>the old man to his family ; his offer was accepted, and he was shot
</p>
<p>in place of the man with the family.

<p>Saturday, December 23, 1876 : Spent my time with the family

<p>of Mr. Tripp (Alexandria, Missouri) where I was treated very
</p>
<p>kindly, and heard from him the particulars of the burning of the
</p>
<p>property that took place during the driving of the Saints from
</p>
<p>their homes in this country (Lima). Mr. Tripp and his wife who

<p>buried, where from, the day they died, age, disease, etc. But we
</p>
<p>have not seen a solitary instance where one of the Saint's tombs,
</p>
<p>have been disturbed by the wolves. Among the graves of those
</p>
<p>whose bones lay around their graves, bleaching in the sun, their
</p>
<p>flesh being consumed by the ravenous wolf, we recognized the
</p>
<p>names of several noted mobocrats from the states of Missouri and
</p>
<p>Illinois, who took an active and prominent part in persecuting,
</p>
<p>mobbing, and driving the Saints from these states. Among others,
</p>
<p>we noticed at the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains the grave
</p>
<p>of one E. Dodd, of Gallatin, Missouri, who died on the 19th of July
</p>
<p>last, of typhus fever. The wolves had completely disinterred him.
</p>
<p>The clothes in which he had been buried lay strewed around. The
</p>
<p>under jaw bone was found in his grave, with the teeth complete,
</p>
<p>being the only remains discernible of him. It is believed he was the

<p>same Dodd that took an active part as a prominent mobocrat in
</p>
<p>the murder of the Saints at Haun's Mill, Missouri; if so, it is a
</p>
<p>righteous retribution. Our God will surely inflict punishment upon
</p>
<p>the heads of our oppressors in His own due time and way."

<p>RENOUNCE MORMONISM AND LIVE

<p>By Brigham Young
</p>
<p>I do not acknowledge that I ever received persecution; my
</p>
<p>path has been kind from the Lord, I do not consider that I have
</p>
<p>suffered enough even to mention it. But when the words of Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Lilburn W. Boggs were read by General Clark, with regard
</p>
<p>to our leaving the state or renouncing our religion, I sat close by
</p>
<p>him, although I was the very particular one they wanted to get
</p>
<p>and were enquiring for ; but, as kind Providence would have it, they
</p>
<p>could not tell whether it was Brigham Young they were looking
</p>
<p>at or somebody else. No matter how this was done, they could not

<p>tell. But, standing close by General Clark, I heard him say: "You
</p>
<p>are the best and most orderly people in this state, and have done
</p>
<p>more to improve it in three years than we have in fifteen. You
</p>
<p>have showed us how to improve, how to raise fruit and wheat, how
</p>
<p>to make gardens, orchards, and so on; and on these accounts we
</p>
<p>want you ; but we have this to say to you, no more bishops, no more
</p>
<p>high councils, and as for your Prophet," and he pointed down to
</p>
<p>where Joseph lay, right in the midst of the camp, "you will never
</p>
<p>see him again." Said I to myself, "May be so and may be not ; but
</p>
<p>I do not believe a word of it." And continued he, "disperse and be-
</p>
<p>come as we are."
</p>
<p>Do you want I should tell you what I thought? I do not think
</p>
<p>I will. Renounce my religion? "No, sir," said I, "It is my all, all I
</p>
<p>have on this earth. What is the world worth as it is now? Nothing.
</p>
<p>It is like a morning shadow ; it is like the dew before the sun, like
</p>
<p>the grass before the scythe, or the flower before the pinching frosts
</p>
<p>of autumn. No, sir, I do not renounce my religion. I am looking be-

<p>THE FATE OF THE MURDERERS OF THE
</p>
<p>PROPHET JOSEPH
</p>
<p>By W. H. Riter
</p>
<p>I have respectfully asked what has become of those who drove
</p>
<p>the Saints from their homes; and the unvarying testimony has
</p>
<p>been that those who are alive are socially and politically dead. Mr.
</p>
<p>M. M. Morrill, an attorney in Nauvoo, brother of Senator Morrill,
</p>
<p>of Maine, who is an old inhabitant of the place, in reply to the above
</p>
<p>question said: "They are either dead, in the penitentiary, or gone
</p>
<p>to hell." Palma, the fiend who set the Temple on fire, is now a con-
</p>
<p>vict in the penitentiary at Fort Madison. The Rev. Thos. Brock-
</p>
<p>man, commander of the mob forces who expelled the remaining
</p>
<p>Saints from their homes, in September, 1846, afterwards ran for
</p>
<p>the office of county clerk for this county. He made his eminent
</p>
<p>services in expelling the Saints a radical point in his claims upon
</p>
<p>his party for election. He was defeated overwhelmingly and left
</p>
<p>the country in disgust. Before leaving, he made a valedictory ad-
</p>
<p>dress to the citizens of Carthage, in which he bitterly complained
</p>
<p>of the treatment he had received from the citizens of Hancock
</p>
<p>county in being ungrateful to him for his mighty services rendered
</p>
<p>in expelling their enemies. During his address he had the flag which
</p>
<p>waved over his myrmidons laying on the desk before him. He
</p>
<p>pathetically said, he wished to bequeath the flag to some citizen of
</p>
<p>Hancock county who would preserve it, and asked who would take
</p>
<p>the flag. No one made answer for sometime, finally a man, whose
</p>
<p>name I have forgotten, stepped forward and received that glorious
</p>
<p>flag (?) which had waved over fifteen hundred brave heads (?)
</p>
<p>who had succeeded in driving a few defenceless men, women and

<p>children from their homes.
</p>
<p>Brockman and Col. Williams are both dead, died enjoying the
</p>
<p>respect of no one as far as I can learn. Col. McCanly, one of the
</p>
<p>leaders of the mob still lives, but in a state of abject poverty and
</p>
<p>his faculties are close bordering on idiocy. Tom Sharp still lives;
</p>
<p>it is said his nose lengthens as he grows in years. The present citi-
</p>
<p>zens of Hancock county, as far as I can learn, deprecate the ex-
</p>
<p>pulsion of the Saints, and none of those engaged in the unholy act
</p>
<p>ever enjoyed any social respect afterwards  nay more, they were
</p>
<p>despised by their neighbors and former friends."

<p>THE END OF THE TRAITOR COLONEL GEORGE M. HINKLE
</p>
<p>By Edward W. Stevenson
</p>
<p>On the 30th of October, 1838, Neil Gillam was at the head of
</p>
<p>a mob who were disguised as wild Indians. They were painted,
</p>
<p>324 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>and Gillam himself was arrayed as an Indian chief. The mob had
</p>
<p>been burning houses and driving the Mormons' stock away from
</p>
<p>their owners, takmg prisoners. Colonel Hinkle ordered out a com-
</p>
<p>pany of militia, about 150 in number, to endeavor to learn the
</p>
<p>intentions of Gillam and others, who were camping on Log Creek,
</p>
<p>near Far West. I was one of those under Col. Hinkle and we all
</p>
<p>were on horseback. We soon learned that their intentions were
</p>
<p>hostile. A flag of truce in the hand of Charles C. Rich was shot
</p>
<p>at during the day, and our company was cut off from Far West by
</p>
<p>a line of battle being formed between us and our homes. Col.
</p>
<p>Hinkle returned from the front of our line with his military coat
</p>
<p>off, saying that there were hardly enough of us to allow a mouthful
</p>
<p>apiece for the numerous hosts before us. He seemed excited and
</p>
<p>fearfully frightened, and for this and other reasons I have always
</p>
<p>believed this accounted for his conduct on that occasion. We re-
</p>
<p>treated fifteen miles to Far West, arriving about the time the
</p>
<p>troops were nearing the city. They were marching with red flags,
</p>
<p>which were interspersed and mixed up with Gillam's command of
</p>
<p>painted faces. Our company coming into Far West on the gallop,
</p>
<p>created quite a sensation, as we were mistaken for the enemy
</p>
<p>coming in from two different points. We, however, soon proved
</p>
<p>ourselves to be friends, and were just in time to extend the line
</p>
<p>already formed in defense of the city. Our adversaries were in
</p>
<p>the ratio of about ten to one of us, which looked rather serious for
</p>
<p>a little handful of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
</p>
<p>day Saints.
</p>
<p>The Prophet came along after our arrival and said :
</p>
<p>"Fear them not. God is for us, and there are more for us than
</p>
<p>there are against us (meaning the hosts of heaven were on our
</p>
<p>side.) God and liberty is the watchword," said Joseph. "Fear
</p>
<p>them not, for their hearts are cold as cucumbers."
</p>
<p>Night was fast approaching and flags of truce were passing

</p>
<p>between the two lines, by which we learned that this formidable
</p>
<p>army was sent out by Governor Boggs with orders to exterminate
</p>
<p>us. It was finally concluded not to murder us that night, so the
</p>
<p>army withdrew until the next morning, when they intended to make
</p>
<p>a final end of Mormonism. They camped for the night on Goose
</p>
<p>Creek, one mile away from the city. Thus ended one of the most
</p>
<p>eventful days of our lives. It fell to my lot to stand guard that
</p>
<p>night, and the worst confusion and disorder ever witnessed by
</p>
<p>human beings existed in the enemy's camp. This, with unearthly
</p>
<p>yelling and howling, produced a real pandemonium very much
</p>
<p>resembling my idea of hell. A sort of breastwork was constructed
</p>
<p>during the night made principally of wagons, house logs, etc. A
</p>
<p>dark and dreary night was that. On the following day, October
</p>
<p>31st, we were preparing to meet death, if necessary, rather than
</p>
<p>surrender our religion to a mob. We trusted in the Lord, however,
</p>
<p>and a better way was prepared. Col. Hinkle had been communi-
</p>
<p>cating with the enemy during the day, and in the afternoon, Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith and others passed over the breast-works near where I and
</p>
<p>others were on duty. Col. Hinkle lead the party to meet the enemy,
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 325
</p>
<p>where he betrayed them into their hands. This treachery on his
</p>
<p>part turned out for the best, for God suffers offences to come, as in
</p>
<p>the case of Judas, "but woe to him by whom they come."
</p>
<p>On the following day, November 1st, 1838, w r e were marched
</p>
<p>into a hollow square just outside of the city, where we delivered
</p>
<p>up about 630 guns, grounded our arms, and advanced to the center
</p>
<p>of the square, where the small arms and swords were left in a pile.
</p>
<p>The late Bishop McRae gave six cuts with his sword and a pointer
</p>
<p>in the ground and left his sword sticking there. We were left
</p>
<p>without the means of self-defense and at the mercy of a conscience-
</p>
<p>less set of ignorant, prejudiced people, many of whom, like St.
</p>
<p>Paul before his conversion, acted as if they were doing God's
</p>
<p>service in destroying property and abusing the Mormons.
</p>
<p>General Wilson, who was one of the mobbers in Jackson county,
</p>
<p>was in company w T ith Joseph Smith soon after he was condemned
</p>
<p>to be shot. Joseph asked General Wilson what he had done that
</p>
<p>he should be treated with such indignity, stating that he had always
</p>
<p>been a supporter of the Constitution and of good government.
</p>
<p>Wilson's reply was: "I know it, and that is the reason I want to
</p>
<p>kill you, or have you killed."
</p>
<p>In the public square of Far West, General Clark said in part :
</p>
<p>"Yon must not think of staying here another season or of
</p>
<p>putting in crops; for, if you do, the citizens will be upon you. If I
</p>
<p>am called here again in case of non-compliance of a treaty made, do
</p>
<p>not think that I shall do as I have done now. You need not expect
</p>
<p>any mercy, but extermination. For I am determined the Governor's
</p>
<p>orders shall be executed."
</p>
<p>"As for your leaders, do not think, do not imagine for a
</p>
<p>moment, do not let it enter into your minds, that they shall be
</p>
<p>delivered and returned to you again for their fate is fixed, their die
</p>
<p>is cast, their doom is sealed. I am sorry, very sorry, gentlemen, to
</p>
<p>see so many intelligent men found in this situation. Oh, if I could

</p>
<p>invoke the Great Spirit, the unknown God, to rest upon and deliver
</p>
<p>you from that awful chain of superstition, and liberate you from
</p>
<p>those fetters of fanaticism ivith ivhich you are bound, that you no
</p>
<p>longer do homage to a man! My advice is that you become as other
</p>
<p>citizens, lest by a recurrence of these events you bring upon your-
</p>
<p>selves irretrievable ruin."
</p>
<p>It vividly recurs to my mind that at the closing of General
</p>
<p>Clark's hard talk, Col. G. M. Hinkle also spoke to the large body of
</p>
<p>Saints, saying :
</p>
<p>"I would advise you all to do as I have done, for I have got
</p>
<p>my hand out of the lion's mouth, and I intend to keep it out here-
</p>
<p>after/'
</p>
<p>It may not be out of place to relate a statement made to me
</p>
<p>by E. B. Tripp, who authorizes me to use his name, regarding
</p>
<p>George M. Hinkle, whose hand he said was out of the lion's mouth.
</p>
<p>Elder E. B. Tripp says :
</p>
<p>"In 1852, 1 lived in Wapelo, Louisa county, Iowa. G. M. Hinkle,
</p>
<p>a stranger to me, came into my drug store. He introduced himself
</p>
<p>to me, saying: 'This is Mr. Tripp, I understand. I hear that you
</p>
<p>326 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>are going to Utah, and I would like to have a private talk with you.
</p>
<p>I am the man who betrayed Joseph Smith and others into the hands
</p>
<p>of the mob in Missouri. I am a miserable man, and scarce know
</p>
<p>what to do ivith myself. I tuould be willing to lay down my life if
</p>
<p>this would atone for the sin I committed. What can I do, Mr. Tripp,
</p>
<p>for I knoiv Mormonism is true ?"
</p>
<p>This is the substance of the conversation as reported by Broth-
</p>
<p>er Tripp, who gave him some good advice before he parted with him.
</p>
<p>Thomas B. Marsh, then one of the Twelve Apostles, apostatized
</p>
<p>during this dark hour of Missouri persecution. I saw him and heard
</p>
<p>him speak then, and also when he came to Utah and was rebaptized.
</p>
<p>I heard him confess with deep regret, saying:
</p>
<p>"Look at my trembling limbs and see the fate of an apostate,
</p>
<p>for I am a wreck, but Mormonism is true, and I advise you not to
</p>
<p>do as I have done, in my apostasy."
</p>
<p>Gen. John C. Bennett, who once flourished in Nauvoo, aposta-
</p>
<p>tized because of his iniquities. He died in Polk City, Iowa, a miser-
</p>
<p>able wreck, debased and degraded. When I was in Iowa on a mis-
</p>
<p>sion I learned of a party who once had a rope around his neck and
</p>
<p>over a limb. At that time he barely escaped being hung up like a
</p>
<p>dog. Reminiscences of the Prophet Joseph, pp. 36-39.
</p>
<p>THE FATE OF JOHN C. BENNETT
</p>
<p>John C. Bennett made an affidavit before Daniel H. Wells,
</p>
<p>alderman of the City of Nauvoo, "that he never was taught any-
</p>
<p>thing in the least contrary to the strictest principles of the gospel,
</p>
<p>or of virtue, or of the laws of God or man, under any circumstances,
</p>
<p>or upon any occasion, either directly or indirectly, in word or in
</p>
<p>deed, by Joseph Smith." When he made this oath he professed to
</p>
<p>be anxious to do right. The affidavit was made on the 17th of
</p>
<p>May, 1842. On the 25th of that month he was notified that the
</p>
<p>First Presidency, Twelve and Bishops had withdrawn fellowship
</p>
<p>from him, and were about to publish him in the paper. He begged
</p>

</p>
<p>them not to publish him in the paper for his mother's sake ; he did
</p>
<p>this so humbly that the notice was withdrawn from the paper.
</p>
<p>The next day he attended a meeting at the Masonic Lodge Room,
</p>
<p>and acknowledged his wicked and licentious conduct; he cried like
</p>
<p>a child, and said he was worthy of the severest of chastisements,
</p>
<p>but he begged that he might be spared. His sorrow appeared so
</p>
<p>deep for the moment, or he pretended to have it, that Joseph plead
</p>
<p>for mercy, and he was forgiven still.
</p>
<p>After this he did not remain long in Nauvoo. As soon as he
</p>
<p>got off he commenced circulating every kind of slander and false-
</p>
<p>hood against Joseph and the Saints. According to his statements
</p>
<p>they were unfit to live. While he was professing to be a member
</p>
<p>of the Church, and to have great faith in the work, he wrote
</p>
<p>several fierce articles about the persecutions which the Saints had
</p>
<p>endured in Missouri. He did not publish his own name to these;
</p>
<p>but signed them "Joab, General in Israel." After he left Nauvoo,
</p>
<p>in writing against Joseph and the Church, he quoted from these
</p>
<p>articles. He did this to show the public what a treasonable, blood-
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 327
</p>
<p>thirsty people the "Mormons" were; but he took care not to tell
</p>
<p>them that he was the "Joab" who had written the articles.
</p>
<p>Bennett published a book filled with the blackest lies about
</p>
<p>Joseph and the Saints. This created a little excitement, which,
</p>
<p>however, did not last long. He was despised by every one who knew
</p>
<p>him, and those who did not know him, but only heard his stories
</p>
<p>or read his book, looked upon him as a traitor and bad man. For
</p>
<p>some years before his death he had fits, which were very violent;
</p>
<p>he also partly lost the use of his limbs and of his tongue. It was
</p>
<p>difficult for him to make himself understood. He dragged out a
</p>
<p>miserable existence, without a person scarcely to take the least
</p>
<p>interest in his fate, and died a few months ago without a person to
</p>
<p>mourn his departure. And yet there was a time, probably, when
</p>
<p>he, like many others before and since, thought that if he should
</p>
<p>apostatize, the work of God would totter and fall! This is the
</p>
<p>blindness of apostates  the trick of the devil to lead them to do
</p>
<p>his bidding. He laughs at their folly, and when they can be no
</p>
<p>longer used by him, he throws them aside and leaves them to their
</p>
<p>miserable fate. Juvenile Instructor, Vol. 3:111, July 15, 1868.

<p>THE MARTYRDOM PLANNED BY LEADING MEN
</p>
<p>OF THE NATION
</p>
<p>By Brigham Young
</p>
<p>When Joseph Smith rose in the majesty of his calling before
</p>
<p>God, he saw what we are now hearing of through dispatches re-
</p>
<p>ceived from week to week. * * * Joseph rose up and said: "I will
</p>
<p>save them, if they will let me." He stepped forth like a man
</p>
<p>and profferred his services to save the nation that is now break-
</p>
<p>ing; and he would have saved it, if they had permitted him.
</p>
<p>What did they bestow upon him in return? They made a martyr
</p>
<p>of him. **** They crowned him a martyr of Jesus. They performed
</p>
<p>an act that secures to him crowns of glory, immortality and eternal
</p>
<p>lives. They succeeded in shedding his blood and that of the Patri-

</p>
<p>arch Hyrum. They shed the blood of the innocent, and the nation
</p>
<p>said amen to it. Were they aware of it at the seat of government?
</p>
<p>I have no doubt they as well knew the plans for destroying the
</p>
<p>Prophet as did those in Carthage or in Warsaw, Illinois. It was
</p>
<p>planned by some of the leading men of the nation. I have said
</p>
<p>here once before, to the astonishment of many of our own country-
</p>
<p>men, that there was a delegate from each State in the nation when
</p>
<p>Joseph was killed. These delegates held their council. What were
</p>
<p>they afraid of? You and me? No. They were afraid of those
</p>
<p>eternal principles God has revealed from the heavens ; they trembled
</p>
<p>and quaked at the sound of them. Joseph would have saved the
</p>
<p>nation from ruin. ****
</p>
<p>I have heard Joseph say : "You will see the sorrows and misery
</p>
<p>of the world and the misery that will be upon this land, until you
</p>
<p>will turn away and pray that your eyes may not be obliged to
</p>
<p>look upon it." Said he, "There are men in this council that will
</p>
<p>328 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>live to see the affliction that will come upon this nation, until your
</p>
<p>hearts sink within you." He did not live here to see it, though
</p>
<p>he will see it. Can you endure the sight of it, No. Boast not over
</p>
<p>the misery of your fellow-men. God will fulfil his purposes."
</p>
<p>Journal of Discourses, 8:320-321, 325.
</p>
<p>I will tell you another prophecy of Joseph's, of which both
</p>
<p>Jews and Gentiles are my witnesses. Joseph said that the bones
</p>
<p>of hundreds of the Missouri and Illinois mobocrats, who drove the
</p>
<p>Saints from those States, should bleach on the plains, and their
</p>
<p>flesh should be meat for wolves. Are you witnesses to that, in
</p>
<p>coming over the plains; Yes, hundreds and hundreds of those
</p>
<p>characters that started to go to the gold mines, their flesh was
</p>
<p>meat for the wolves, and their bones are there bleaching today,
</p>
<p>so far as they have not been buried or entirely rotted away.
</p>
<p>Jouryial of Discourses, 8:357.
</p>
<p>RETRIBUTION TO THOSE WHO PERSECUTED
</p>
<p>It was prophesied by Joseph the Prophet that the bones of
</p>
<p>those who drove the Church from Missouri and killed men, women
</p>
<p>and children should bleach upon the plains. This has been fulfilled.
</p>
<p>Did they suffer more than the people of God whom they drove from
</p>
<p>their homes  from their firesides in winter  from their fathers and
</p>
<p>mothers and friends, and the land of their nativity? Yes, there is
</p>
<p>scarcely a comparison. Their sufferings in crossing the plains to
</p>
<p>the gold regions of California have been greater by far than ever
</p>
<p>the sufferings of the Saints have been in crossing the plains to
</p>
<p>Utah. These are facts that are present with us. The bones of those
</p>
<p>who drove the Saints from Independence, from Jackson County,
</p>
<p>then from Clay and Daviess Counties, and last of all from Caldwell
</p>

<p>THE DEVASTATION OF JACKSON COUNTY, MISSOURI
</p>
<p>By Junius F. Wells
</p>
<p>I had the pleasure, in the early part of this year (1902) to meet
</p>
<p>Hon. Leonidas M. Lawson, of New York City, formerly a resident
</p>
<p>of Clay County, Missouri. Mr. Lawson is a brother-in-law of General
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 329
</p>
<p>Doniphan, and one night, in the beautiful University Club, a night I
</p>
<p>shall long remember, he recounted to me many parts of the story
</p>
<p>here related. He said that his father had told him in his youth of
</p>
<p>the inhumanity of the Missourians' treatment of the Mormon people,
</p>
<p>and then he told me of his own visit to General Doniphan, in 1863;
</p>
<p>of their riding over Jackson County together, and of the incidents
</p>
<p>related in the following letter, which I requested him to write. Mr.
</p>
<p>Lawson is a man standing high in his profession, a lawyer of great
</p>
<p>ability, an orator known in Missouri, New York, and London, a man
</p>
<p>of world-wide travel and information, whose observations upon affairs
</p>
<p>and men are of recognized weight and value in the cosmopolitan circle
</p>
<p>of his acquaintance. It was a pleasure to hear him, without prejudice
</p>
<p>for or against the Mormons, narrate eloquently the circumstances
</p>
<p>which he has so briefly, but pointedly, set down in this communication:
</p>
<p>New York City, February 7, 1902.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Junius F. Wells, New York.
</p>
<p>My dear Sir: Responding to your request for a statement con-
</p>
<p>cerning the devastation of Jackson County, Mo., permit me to say:
</p>
<p>I am preparing a biographical sketch of General Alexander W.
</p>
<p>Doniphan. It will be remembered that General Doniphan com-
</p>
<p>manded the famous expedition, which during the Mexican War
</p>
<p>marched from Fort Leavenworth to Santa Fe, and thence to Chi-
</p>
<p>huahua, fighting enroute the Battle of Bracite and the Battle of
</p>
<p>Sacramento; in this latter engagement his little army of 1000
</p>
<p>Missourians was opposed by a Mexican army U000 strong. In the
</p>
<p>biography occurs the following interesting passage:
</p>
<p>'In the year 1863, I visited General A. W. Doniphan at his
</p>
<p>home in Jackson County, Mo. This was soon after the devastation
</p>
<p>of Jackson County, Mo., under what is known as "Order No. 11"
</p>
<p>This devastation was complete. Farms were everywhere destroyed,
</p>
<p>and the farm houses were burned. During this visit General Doni-
</p>
<p>phan related the following historical facts o,nd personal incidents:

</p>
<p>'About the year 1831-2, the Mormons settled in Jackson County,
</p>
<p>Mo., under the leadership of Joseph Smith. The people of Jackson
</p>
<p>County became dissatisfied with their presence, and forced them to
</p>
<p>leave; and they crossed the Missouri River and settled in the coun-
</p>
<p>ties of DeKalb, Caldwell and Ray. They founded the town of Far
</p>
<p>West, and began to prepare the foundation of a Temple. It was
</p>
<p>here that the trouble arose which culminated in the expulsion of the
</p>
<p>Mormons from the State of Missouri, according to the command of
</p>
<p>Governor Lilburn W. Boggs. This was known in Missouri annals
</p>
<p>as the Mormon War. There were many among those who obeyed
</p>
<p>the order of the Governor, in the State Militia, who believed that
</p>
<p>the movement against the Mormons was unjust and cruel, and that
</p>
<p>the excitement was kept up by those who coveted the homes, the
</p>
<p>barns and the fields of the Mormon people. The latter, during their
</p>
<p>residence in the State of Missouri, paid, in entry fees for the land
</p>
<p>they claimed, to the U. S. Government Land Office, more than
</p>
<p>$300,000.00 which for that period represented a tremendous inter-
</p>
<p>est. During their sojourn in Missouri the Mormons did not practice
</p>
<p>or teach polygamy, so that question did not enter into it.
</p>
<p>'Following the early excitement, Joseph Smith ivas indicted
</p>
<p>for treason against the State of Missouri, and General Doniphan
</p>
<p>330 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>was one of the counsel employed to defend him, he having shown
</p>
<p>a friendly interest in Smith, tvhom he considered very badly treated.
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith tuas placed in prison in Liberty, Missouri to await
</p>
<p>his trial. This place was the residence of General Doniphan. His
</p>
<p>partner in the practice of laiv was James H. Baldwin.
</p>
<p>'On one occasion General Doniphan caused the sheriff of the
</p>
<p>county to bring Joseph Smith from the prison to his law office, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of consultation about his defense. During Smith's
</p>
<p>presence in the office, a resident of Jackson County, Missouri, came
</p>
<p>in for the purpose of paying a fee which was due by him to the
</p>
<p>firm of Doniphan and Baldivin, and offered in payment a tract of
</p>
<p>land in Jackson County.
</p>
<p>'Doniphan told him that his partner, Mr. Baldwin, was absent
</p>
<p>at the moment, but as soon as he had an opportunity he would con-
</p>
<p>sult him and decide about the matter. When the Jackson County
</p>
<p>man retired, Joseph Smith, tuho had overheard the conversation,
</p>
<p>addressed General Doniphan about as folloivs:
</p>
<p>"Doniphan, I advise you not to take that Jackson County land
</p>
<p>in payment of the debt. God's ivrath hangs over Jackson County.
</p>
<p>God's people have been ruthlessly driven from it, and you will live
</p>
<p>to see the day ivhen it will be visited by fire and sivord. The Lord
</p>
<p>of Hosts ivill sweep it with the besom of destruction. The fields and
</p>
<p>farms and houses will be destroyed, and only the chimneys will be
</p>
<p>left to mark the desolation."
</p>
<p>"General Doniphan said to me that the devastation of Jackson
</p>
<p>County forcibly reminded him of this remarkable prediction of the
</p>
<p>Mormon prophet. Y ours sincerely,
</p>
<p>L. M. Lawson."
</p>
<p>There is a prediction of the Prophet Joseph, not before put into
</p>
<p>print, and history has recorded its complete fulfillment.
</p>
<p>As a remarkable evidence of its literal and exact fulfillment, I
</p>
<p>add the following self-explanatory and interesting letter from Judge

<p>A. Saxey, written in reply to a request for information upon the
</p>
<p>subject, and call attention to his use of the almost exact of Joseph's
</p>
<p>prophecy, though so far as I know, he has not even heard that such
</p>
<p>a prediction was ever made:
</p>
<p>Spanish Fork, Utah, August 25, 1902.
</p>
<p>Mr. Junius F. Wells, Salt Lake City, Utah.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir: Yours of August 22nd, received. I hardly know how
</p>
<p>to write in a letter concerning the subject you inquire about. How-
</p>
<p>ever, I will give you a little of ivhat I know, and if you can use it,
</p>
<p>all right.
</p>
<p>I enlisted in a Kansas regiment in 1861. During the winter of
</p>
<p>1861 and '62, my regiment was stationed at Kansas City, and we
</p>
<p>were around in Jackson County a great deal during the winter.
</p>
<p>Quantrill was operating in that locality, and ive were trying to
</p>
<p>catch him. At one time, we surrounded Independence, and arrested
</p>
<p>everyone in the town. I can testify that Jackson County contained
</p>
<p>more contemptible, mean, devilish rebels than any I came across
</p>
<p>in an experience of four years. I had quite a talk ivith a man 1
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 331
</p>
<p>arrested who lived on the Blue River, and who ivas there when the
</p>
<p>Saints were driven out, but that, I suppose, ivould be somewhat
</p>
<p>foreign to your inquiry.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1862, my regiment went south, and it was dur-
</p>
<p>ing that time that "Order No. 11" was issued, but I was back there
</p>
<p>again in 1864, during the Price raid, and saw the condition of the
</p>
<p>country. The duty of executing the order was committed to Col.
</p>
<p>W. R. Penick's regiment, and there is no doubt but that he carried
</p>
<p>it into effect, from the howl the Copperhead papers made at the
</p>
<p>time. I went down the Blue River. We found houses, barns, out-
</p>
<p>buildings, nearly all burned down, and nothing left standing but
</p>
<p>the chimneys, which had, according to the fashion of the time, been
</p>
<p>built on the outside of the buildings. I remember very well that the
</p>
<p>county looked a veritable desolation.
</p>
<p>I do not know that uyhat I have written will do you any good,
</p>
<p>if it will, you are welcome. Of course, I could tell a great deal more
</p>
<p>than I can write in a letter. Respectfully,
</p>
<p>A. Saxey.
</p>
<p>The practice of the guerilla bands of making stealthy, assassin-
</p>
<p>like, sudden attacks upon the Union troops, from ambush, as they
</p>
<p>were marching from point to point, and then disappearing, became
</p>
<p>so intolerable that extreme measures were resolved upon to stop
</p>
<p>it. These contemplated the destruction of the base of supplies of
</p>
<p>the marauding parties. It was found that the principal location
</p>
<p>was Jackson County, where forage for their horses and food for
</p>
<p>the men, and change of animals and equipment were being secretly
</p>
<p>furnished, as the opportunity and need of the renegade parties
</p>
<p>required. Women and children even were frequently discovered
</p>
<p>contributing to the sustenance and help of these parties. The whole
</p>
<p>county came to be regarded as a nest-bed of traitors and spies, a
</p>
<p>refuge for assassins and robbers, whose murderous and uncivilized
</p>
<p>warfare could not be combatted by the ordinary rules and practices

<p>of civilized war, and that must be put down by means that should
</p>
<p>be effective, however cruel and relentless. This determination led
</p>
<p>to the issuance of the celebrated "General Order No. 11." which has
</p>
<p>been more widely published and quoted, because of the manner and
</p>
<p>thoroughness of its execution, than almost any other order of the
</p>
<p>Civil War.

</p>
<p>THE JUDGMENTS OF GOD SHALL OVERTAKE THEM
</p>
<p>On the 1st of May, 1850, we said goodbye to the old Keokuk.
</p>
<p>Our outfit consisted of four wagons, heavily loaded, nine yoke of
</p>
<p>oxen, five cows, two mules and one horse. Richard Cook drove
</p>
<p>the wagon of Caroline; with his family our contingent was aug-
</p>
<p>mented to fifteen. It was a late and cold spring; the ground was
</p>
<p>very wet. We had much trouble to pull our wagons through the

</p>
<p>muddy roads. The wheels sometimes would sink down to the hub ;
</p>
<p>and occasionally we had to double the teams to get through the
</p>
<p>swamps toward Council Bluffs, Iowa. At length we reached the
</p>
<p>Missouri River and crossed it the 1st of June, 1850, landing at the
</p>
<p>south side of the Platte. There our company was organized with
</p>
<p>Milo Andrus for Captain. Our train of emigrants consisted of 56
</p>
<p>wagons and five captains of ten. President Orson Hyde organized
</p>
<p>us and his closing words were: "// you will strictly observe your
</p>
<p>prayers morning and evening, keep the Sabbath Day holy, faith-
</p>
<p>fully hold the name of God sacred, and be kind to each other and
</p>
<p>to your animals, you shall all go safely to the V 'alley r s." We arrived
</p>
<p>all well and happy to our destination the 28th of August, 1850,
</p>
<p>having had one death and one birth. The gold fever prompted many
</p>
<p>to go to California that summer, by way of the north side of the
</p>
<p>Platte, so that the feed for animals was all used up. For that reason
</p>
<p>President Hyde advised us to go along the south side. Some of the
</p>
<p>gold seekers did take the same route. The cholera broke out among
</p>
<p>them ; they were all around us, before and behind us, although we
</p>
<p>tried to keep away from them, and many of them died, but our
</p>
<p>company escaped.
</p>
<p>One afternoon our camp stopped earlier than usual. I stole
</p>
<p>away about two miles to the Bluffs, to see where those people came
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 333
</p>
<p>from who were swept out to such an alarming extent. Such a
</p>
<p>horrible scene as I beheld I hope never to see again. The graves
</p>
<p>of the cholera victims were there, with head-boards bearing their
</p>
<p>names, who were from Missouri; but the hyenas had dug open
</p>
<p>the graves, dragged the cadavers out and devoured the flesh from
</p>
<p>their bones ; the ravens had plucked out their eyes, and their bloody
</p>
<p>long skeletons lay stretched out on the ground. That awful sight
</p>
<p>shocked my feelings beyond expression. I did not take note of their
</p>
<p>names, unfortunately, but I remembered many were of the mobbers
</p>
<p>of Missouri, who had so cruelly treated our people. Then I recalled
</p>
<p>the prophecy of Joseph Smith: "You shall not die a natural death:
</p>
<p>the judgments of the Almighty shall overtake you: the wolves shall
</p>
<p>eat the flesh from your bones and the ravens shall pluck out your
</p>
<p>eyes" And I saw it literally fulfilled ; but our captain had forbidden
</p>
<p>us to go to their camps and I dared not mention what I had seen
</p>
<p>to anyone. I am perhaps the only witness who saw that prophecy
</p>
<p>fulfilled. This was between Fort Kearney and the crossing of the
</p>
<p>South Platte. Life of Thomas Steed, pp. 14-15.

<p>THE PROPHET'S FATHER HAD POWER TO BLESS
</p>
<p>AND TO CURSE
</p>
<p>By Perrigrine Sessions
</p>
<p>(Note: While visiting at the home of Sister Robert Scott, in
</p>
<p>Rock Springs, Wyoming, on October 13, 1935, Sister Scott dictated
</p>
<p>the following incident from the diary of her father Perrigrine
</p>
<p>Sessions.)
</p>
<p>In the year 1838, when on my way out of Missouri, near
</p>
<p>Palmyra, in company with Father Joseph Smith, the father of the
</p>
<p>Prophet Joseph, and Carlos Smith, his brother, we encountered a
</p>
<p>heavy snow storm. We halted at a farm house to buy corn and to
</p>
<p>stay all night. Father Smith asked the owner if we could camp
</p>
<p>there and buy feed for our animals. He asked : "Are you Mormons?"
</p>
<p>Father Smith answered: "Yes, we are." He became very angry

</p>
<p>and said: "Damn you, you can't stay on my property," and with
</p>
<p>many insulting words and threats we were driven out into the
</p>
<p>street. Here we stopped and gathered together in the falling snow.
</p>
<p>Slowly Father Smith removed his hat and with uplifted hands he
</p>
<p>prayed : "In the name of the Lord whom we serve, let that man be
</p>
<p>cursed in his basket and in his store, and let this man's name be
</p>
<p>cut off from under heaven." We all said, Amen.
</p>
<p>When I came to travel this same road two years later, this
</p>
<p>incident was brought fresh to my mind. For behold there was
</p>
<p>nothing to mark the spot but the ruins of his home burned to ashes ;
</p>
<p>his orchard broken down; his farm a picture of desolation; his
</p>
<p>wife and three children were burned to death in their home and he
</p>
<p>at this time was in close confinement for the insane. I saw the
</p>
<p>power of the priesthood manifested, for at the next farm we were
</p>
<p>received kindly and given all the comfort and assistance we needed
</p>
<p>and Father Smith left his blessing on this household as we departed.
</p>
<p>Here my eyes beheld the fulfillment of his words to the letter as
</p>
<p>334 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>there I looked upon a picture of prosperity and happiness. All this
</p>
<p>passed and the two neighbors were ignorant of the curse or the
</p>
<p>blessing placed upon them as we passed on.
</p>
<p>THE FATE OF MOBOCRATS
</p>
<p>The sad news reached us today of Brother Silas Beckwith
</p>
<p>being murdered and buried. This Beckwith was one of the Mormon
</p>
<p>Battalion in the Mexican war, and was, at the time of his death, a
</p>
<p>worthy member and teacher in the San Juan branch.
</p>
<p>I visited his widow and orphans, and spent some hours in the
</p>
<p>house of mourning. On my second visit I gained and wrote down
</p>
<p>the following statements pertaining to the history of Joseph Smith :
</p>
<p>Mrs. Eunice Corinthia Beckwith, formerly Mrs. Lawn (whose
</p>
<p>father's name was Joshua Twitchell), was the widow of John
</p>
<p>Lawn, captain of a company of Illinois militia, of McDonough
</p>
<p>County, who guarded Joseph and Hyrum Smith in Carthage jail
</p>
<p>until the morning of the day they were martyred, when himself
</p>
<p>and company were disbanded by order of Governor Ford, and
</p>
<p>started for home, leaving the prisoners in the hands of the Carthage
</p>
<p>Greys.
</p>
<p>On taking leave of the prisoners he gave his hand, received
</p>
<p>Joseph's blessing, and heard him say most solemnly: "Farewell,
</p>
<p>Captain Lawn ; when you and your men leave me my life guard is
</p>
<p>gone." Previous to this, however, Joseph had read to him the
</p>
<p>fifty-fifth Psalm, and told him to remember that chapter and read
</p>
<p>it to his friends when he arrived home. One of the Carthage Greys
</p>
<p>also read in reply the sixty-first Psalm.
</p>
<p>Captain Lawn and his troops had marched about twelve miles
</p>
<p>towards home when the news reached them of the martyrdom ! At
</p>
<p>this he exclaimed : "Oh that I had known of this massacre, so soon
</p>
<p>to transpire ! I would have remained, and, when the first ball was
</p>
<p>fired at the Smiths, I would have fired the second through the body
</p>
<p>of the villain who fired it or died in the attempt."

</p>
<p>A man named Townsend, living in Iowa, near Fort Madison,
</p>
<p>was one of the mob who assaulted and forced in the jail door. The
</p>
<p>pistol discharged by Joseph Smith wounded him in the arm, near
</p>
<p>the shoulder, and it continued to rot without healing until it was
</p>
<p>taken off, and even then it would not heal.
</p>
<p>About six months after he was shot Mrs. Lawn saw his arm
</p>
<p>and dressed it. He was then gradually rotting and dying with the
</p>
<p>wound. He staid overnight with Mrs. Lawn's father, and groaned
</p>
<p>through the night without sleeping. He asked the old gentleman
</p>
<p>what he thought of Joseph Smith being a prophet? He replied that
</p>
<p>he did not know. "Well," said Townsend, "I KNOW HE WAS A
</p>
<p>PROPHET OF GOD ! And, oh, that I had staid at home and minded
</p>
<p>my own business, and then I would not have lost my life and been
</p>
<p>tormented with a guilty conscience, and with this dreadful wound,
</p>
<p>which NONE CAN HEAL!" He died two or three months after-
</p>
<p>wards, having literally rotted alive!
</p>
<p>James Head, of McComb, was also one of the murderers at the
</p>
<p>Carthage jail; he was heard by Captain Lawn and others to boast
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 335
</p>
<p>of it afterwards, and Captain Lawn drew a pistol and chased him,
</p>
<p>but he ran away. He was always gloomy and troubled from the
</p>
<p>time he helped to murder the Smiths, and frequently declared that
</p>
<p>he saw the two martyrs always before him ! He had no peace.
</p>
<p>A colonel of the Missouri mob, who helped to drive, plunder and
</p>
<p>murder the Mormons, died in the hospital at Sacramento, 1849.
</p>
<p>Beckwith had the care of him ; he was eaten with worms  a large
</p>
<p>black-headed kind of maggot  which passed through him by myr-
</p>
<p>iads, seemingly a half pint at a time ! Before he died these maggots
</p>
<p>were crawling out of his mouth and nose ! He literally rotted alive !
</p>
<p>Even the flesh on his legs burst open and fell from the bones ! They
</p>
<p>gathered up the rotten mass in a blanket and buried him, without
</p>
<p>awaiting a coffin !
</p>
<p>A Mr. , one of the Missouri mob, died in the same hospital
</p>
<p>about the same time, and under the care of Mr. Beckwith. His face
</p>
<p>and jaw on one side literally rotted, and half of his face actually
</p>
<p>fell off! One eye rotted out, and half of his nose, mouth and jaw
</p>
<p>fell from the bones! The doctor scraped the bones, and unlocked
</p>
<p>and took out his jaw from the joint round to the center of the chin.
</p>
<p>The rot and maggots continued to eat till they ate through the
</p>
<p>large or jugular vein of his neck, and he bled to death ! He, as well
</p>
<p>as Townsend, stank so previous to their death, that they had to be
</p>
<p>placed in rooms by themselves, and it was almost impossible to
</p>
<p>endure their presence, and the flies could not be kept from blowing
</p>
<p>them while alive !
</p>
<p>These particulars, and many others, were related to me by
</p>
<p>Brother Beckwith previous to his death, and afterwards by his
</p>
<p>widow and father-in-law, and others who were conversant with
</p>
<p>them, and are believed to be correct.

<p>John Forssett died a short time after the murder was com-

<p>brothers, Tom, William and Joe, except the latter, who has paid a
</p>
<p>small portion of his penalty by losing his eyesight. Joe Nation is
</p>
<p>supposed to be the one who did the fatal shooting.

<p>FATE OF THE CANE CREEK, TENNESSEE, MURDERERS
</p>
<p>By Robert Price
</p>
<p>There are in the Southern States at the present time two
</p>
<p>Elders named Gibbs and Berry. These young men were babes in
</p>
<p>their mothers' arms when their fathers, together with two other
</p>
<p>members of the Church, were murdered in cold blood, at the head
</p>
<p>of Cane Creek, Tennessee. On Sunday morning, August 10, 1884,
</p>
<p>Elders J. H. Gibbs, William S. Berry and Henry Thompson met at
</p>
<p>the home of a family of Saints by the name of Condor, where they
</p>
<p>had purposed holding a meeting with Saints and friends in that
</p>
<p>district. They knew nothing of the murderous plot that had been
</p>
<p>concocted by a band of ruffians, who had chosen as their leader
</p>
<p>a professed minister of the Gospel of Christ, a pretended disciple
</p>
<p>of the meek and lowly Nazarene. In an unexpected moment a
</p>
<p>number of masked men rushed in upon the Saints, shot and killed
</p>
<p>Elders Gibbs and Berry, two members of the Condor family, and
</p>
<p>seriously wounded Sister Condor. Elder Thompson escaped into
</p>
<p>the woods, his life being saved by a lady who passed between him
</p>
<p>and his would-be assassin.
</p>
<p>Later Elder Brigham H. Roberts, disguised as a tramp, went
</p>
<p>to Tennessee, and succeeded in recovering the bodies of the mur-
</p>
<p>dered missionaries, and they were brought home to Utah and laid
</p>
<p>to rest among the people of God. I take the following extract from
</p>
<p>an editorial published in the Millennial Star (Vol. 46) at that time:
</p>
<p>"It is hard to conceive how a dozen or twenty beings in the human
</p>
<p>form could be found, in this enlightened age, and in that nation
</p>
<p>which boasts so much of its freedom and tolerance, so utterly
</p>
<p>depraved, so devoid of all the finer feelings which are supposed to
</p>
<p>distinguish the civilized man from the savage, as to deliberately

</p>
<p>combine for the perpetration of such a crime, even though their
</p>
<p>victims were ever so unworthy. But how much more difficult to
</p>
<p>reconcile the thought of their doing so when we know that there
</p>
<p>was not the slightest provocation for the deed; when we under-
</p>
<p>stand that the only fault they could possibly find with their victims
</p>
<p>was that they believed and taught a religion that was distasteful
</p>
<p>to them; when we learn that at least one of the assassins was a
</p>
<p>preacher of religion ; when we realize that they chose the Sabbath
</p>
<p>day for the awful tragedy, and swooped down and mercilessly
</p>
<p>butchered their victims when they had met for divine worship;
</p>
<p>Incredibly as these statements appear, they are true  only too
</p>
<p>true."
</p>
<p>I am reminded of this said event by Elder Soren Peterson,
</p>
<p>while attending the recent London conference. Elder Peterson
</p>
<p>stated that he followed the remains of one of the martyrs to their
</p>
<p>last resting place, about twenty-two years ago. Eleven years later,
</p>
<p>in August, 1895, he, in company with Elder E. S. Larson of Coal-
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 337
</p>
<p>ville, Utah, visited Cane Creek and preached in the log cabin in
</p>
<p>which the meeting was held prior to the tragedy. The Condor
</p>
<p>home had been burned down two months before, but they were told
</p>
<p>that the blood of the martyrs was there till that time, and that all
</p>
<p>efforts to erase it had been in vain. David Hinson, the leader of
</p>
<p>the mob, was killed by James R. Hutson, a half brother of the
</p>
<p>Condor boys, at the time of the tragedy. The murderers were per-
</p>
<p>mitted to go unpunished so far as the law of the land was con-
</p>
<p>cerned, but the vengeance of heaven overtook them. Elder Peterson
</p>
<p>was told by reliable people that Hinson's brother, one of the mob,
</p>
<p>got into trouble with a man who cut his flesh almost into shreds.
</p>
<p>So acute was his suffering that he plead with his friends to put
</p>
<p>him to death and thus end his pain. He said that the reason why
</p>
<p>he had to suffer thus was because he had assisted in putting to
</p>
<p>death two servants of the Lord. Before his death his flesh dropped
</p>
<p>from his bones. All the other members of that notorious gang died
</p>
<p>unnatural deaths. Four of them became raving maniacs, and died
</p>
<p>in lunatic asylums. Millennial Star, 68:662-63.

<p>THE CANE CREEK MASSACRE
</p>
<p>By Alfred Fuller
</p>
<p>(Dictated to the Compiler of this book on December 27, 1951, at
</p>
<p>Mesa, Arizona
</p>
<p>I was born in Harrisburg, Washington County, Utah, on the
</p>
<p>21st of October, 1871. My parents were Willis Darwin Fuller and
</p>
<p>Annie Campkin Fuller. I left home on the 27th of June, 1899, for
</p>
<p>a mission to the Southern States, and was assigned to the Middle
</p>
<p>Tennessee conference, in Hickman county. My companion on the
</p>
<p>following occasion was Elder David C. Shupe, a young man of
</p>
<p>twenty-two years of age. We visited the northern end of Hickman
</p>
<p>county, trading as we went, and as we approached a certain home,
</p>
<p>the man of the house saw us coming and came out of the house
</p>
<p>and said : "I know who you are ; you are Mormon Elders. Get your

</p>
<p>grips and come right in this house. You see that little church upon
</p>
<p>that ridge?" "Yes, sir," we replied. Said he: "Two Mormon Eld-
</p>
<p>ers came here by the name of John H. Gibbs and William S. Berry.
</p>
<p>They asked me if I thought it was possible to get permission to
</p>
<p>preach in that little white church. I told them there had never
</p>
<p>been a Mormon preach in it; that it was built as a union church,
</p>
<p>free to the use of all denominations except Mormons ; but you might
</p>
<p>try. I gave the Elders the names of the deacons who had the say
</p>
<p>of this church. They met the first deacon and asked him if he
</p>
<p>thought it would be out of order if the truth was once preached in
</p>
<p>that church, and he said: "No, I would like to hear the truth
</p>
<p>preached once in that church." Elder Gibbs said: "Well, if you
</p>
<p>will consent and come out you shall hear the gospel truths preached
</p>
<p>in their fulness in that church." The man said : "As far as I am
</p>
<p>concerned I give my consent but you must go and see the others."
</p>
<p>They called at the homes of the others but they were away from
</p>
<p>home, which, of course, gave the necessary permission.
</p>
<p>338 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>Our host who invited us in his home was a little bald-headed
</p>
<p>school teacher and a member of the Christian church. He said to
</p>
<p>us : "I used to hold prayer meetings for the Christian church mem-
</p>
<p>bers but since those Elders came here and preached that time I
</p>
<p>don't hold any prayer meetings. I told our minister that he was
</p>
<p>absolutely without any authority to preach or baptize or administer
</p>
<p>any ordinances of the gospel and he had no more authority than
</p>
<p>the Jews, Protestants or Catholics." Our host further stated:
</p>
<p>"Do you know, that little Elder Gibbs, if there is such a thing as an
</p>
<p>inspired man, he was inspired. He had that Bible from Genesis to
</p>
<p>Revelations on the tip of his tongue. They held six meetings in that
</p>
<p>little church and each meeting the crowd increased from meeting
</p>
<p>to meeting until the last meeting when they stood in the aisles. The
</p>
<p>Elders stayed with me every night. They had dozens of invitations
</p>
<p>to homes and I just stepped up when one would invite them to stay
</p>
<p>at their home and say, 'No, sir, I have invited them to stay with me
</p>
<p>during this meeting period/ He said, 'Do you know that just ten
</p>
<p>days after those Elders left my home they drifted into Lewis coun-
</p>
<p>ty on Cane Creek and there they were murdered/ "
</p>
<p>In going back to our headquarters, we strayed across the line
</p>
<p>into Lewis county which was out of our assigned territory, as we
</p>
<p>were desirous of meeting the man where the killing took place
</p>
<p>which was at the Condor home on Cane Creek. Brother Condor
</p>
<p>owned 80 acres of land and Cane Creek ran right through his land,
</p>
<p>where several nice pools were located that were suitable for bap-
</p>
<p>tismal purposes. Brother Condor had one son eighteen years of
</p>
<p>age and a step-son about nineteen or twenty years of age. The
</p>
<p>post office was two miles north of the Condor home and these boys
</p>
<p>went every day to the post office for the mail. It was rumored
</p>
<p>there that ten days away there would be four baptized on Cane
</p>
<p>Creek on the Condor farm. The postmaster would tell these boys
</p>
<p>that he heard men say that very morning that there was not going

</p>
<p>to be any baptisms on that date and at that place. They were not
</p>
<p>going to permit it. Each day the postmaster would tell the boys
</p>
<p>that ten or twelve men had said that "there will not be any baptisms.
</p>
<p>They were not going to stand for it. They were going to take those
</p>
<p>Elders and whip them with hickory whips until they couldn't stand
</p>
<p>up, and then haul them out of Lewis county on a wagon." These
</p>
<p>boys would say to the postmaster when these men made their brags,
</p>
<p>"that they had better dress their wives in mourning because they
</p>
<p>are not coming onto our property and take innocent men that have
</p>
<p>never done any one a bit of harm and mistreat them. No, when
</p>
<p>you hear them say that once more, you tell them that they had bet-
</p>
<p>ter be careful because this property belongs to us, and those Elders
</p>
<p>are right at home there. They are not molesting anybody." This
</p>
<p>went on for seven days. Each day the postmaster would hear more
</p>
<p>threats from this crowd, who would gather at the post office, and
</p>
<p>every one of them were drinking.
</p>
<p>Brother Condor told us that the leader of the mob held Baptist
</p>
<p>prayer meetings. This baptismal service was set for two o'clock
</p>
<p>on the specified day but at ten o'clock on that day about twelve
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 339
</p>
<p>men on horseback, all masked, rode up to the home. All wore guns
</p>
<p>and most of them had pistols also. They rode up to the gate which
</p>
<p>was about 100 feet from the house, tied their horses outside the
</p>
<p>fence, came inside the fence and the leader of the mob walked right
</p>
<p>into the house, the others remained standing in the yard. Brother
</p>
<p>Condor said he walked out of the house just as the leader of the
</p>
<p>mob walked into the house. There was a gun hanging on a rack
</p>
<p>on the wall. The leader of the mob took the gun off the rack
</p>
<p>which was across the room from the door, turned to the left in
</p>
<p>front of Elder Gibbs, pulled his pistol and shot Elder Gibbs twice.
</p>
<p>Elder Gibbs was sitting in a chair with a hymn book in his hands
</p>
<p>as they had been singing hymns that morning to Brother and Sister
</p>
<p>Condor. Both Elders were wonderful singers, Elder Gibbs hav-
</p>
<p>ing a fine tenor voice and Elder Berry a splendid bass voice. They
</p>
<p>were often asked by their congregations to sing one or more hymns
</p>
<p>after each meeting.
</p>
<p>The leader of the mob then walked out of the house. Elder
</p>
<p>Berry slammed the door as the leader of the mob went out. The
</p>
<p>mob could see down the alley way between the houses the son who
</p>
<p>was in the orchard 150 yards away, who came running to the house
</p>
<p>at the sound of the shots that killed Elder Gibbs. Not over a
</p>
<p>minute after Elder Gibbs was shot, the mob started shooting
</p>
<p>through the door at Elder Berry. About six shots hit him. The
</p>
<p>son ran upstairs to the window, picked up his gun, and fired one
</p>
<p>shot which struck the leader of the mob who fell dead just inside
</p>
<p>the gate. By this time the step-son had reached the window up-
</p>
<p>stairs when six shots hit both of them. Both boys fell right by the
</p>
<p>window. The mob then put their dead leader on the horse and
</p>
<p>rode away, after first tying him to the saddle. A stray bullet
</p>
<p>went through the door of the kitchen and hit Mrs. Condor in the
</p>
<p>hip, breaking her hip bone which rendered her a cripple for six-
</p>
<p>teen years.

<p>Brother Condor told us that for two years after the massacre,
</p>
<p>his red American blood boiled to think that his neighbors, twelve
</p>
<p>in number, would congregate to murder innocent people. Said he :
</p>
<p>"I knew every one of them by the horses they rode. The only con-
</p>
<p>solation I had was to kneel down and ask the Lord for strength
</p>
<p>that I might be able to overcome the feeling of taking the law into
</p>
<p>my own hands and waylay these men but every time I would ask
</p>
<p>the Lord to avenge my brothers. One night after two years had
</p>
<p>passed, the power of God rested upon me and it came to my mind
</p>
<p>that if these two boys had been in the house ready for the mob, he
</p>
<p>believed the boys would have killed all twelve of the mob before
</p>
<p>they could get away. If such had been the case, it would have been
</p>
<p>the greatest blight on the Church that could have happened because
</p>
<p>the law would have taken the two Elders, the two boys and myself
</p>
<p>to jail and we would have hanged for their death. But consolation
</p>
<p>came to me when I saw the members of the mob drifting toward
</p>
<p>hell. They were all drinking and visiting the taverns where there
</p>
<p>were prostitutes and as a result their wives divorced them because
</p>
<p>they were diseased, for the state law promptly permitted divorces
</p>
<p>on those grounds. About two years after the massacre two of
</p>
<p>340 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>these men were in a tavern playing cards and drinking. They
</p>
<p>carried their guns all the time. A quarrel came up in this card
</p>
<p>game and both raised at the same moment, pulled their guns and
</p>
<p>both guns cracked at once, shooting each other through the heart.
</p>
<p>All of these mobbers were in the depths of poverty and were vaga-
</p>
<p>bonds dressed in rags, and rode pony horses around the country.
</p>
<p>All were buried by the county in pauper graves and some of them
</p>
<p>died in the insane asylum."
</p>
<p>When we started to leave the home of Brother and Sister
</p>
<p>Condor, they followed us out of the home, with tears streaming
</p>
<p>down their faces, and remarked what a great spiritual feast they
</p>
<p>had had during our visit. Their joy was overwhelming as they had
</p>
<p>not seen an Elder for about five years. "Won't you promise to
</p>
<p>come back to us," they entreated, but our fields of labor did not
</p>
<p>permit us to return.

<p>THE GENERAL CAUSE OF APOSTASY FROM
</p>
<p>THE CHURCH
</p>
<p>By George Q. Cannon
</p>
<p>Oliver Cowdery, the man who was ordained with Joseph Smith
</p>
<p>Dy angels, and whom you would imagine would of all men in the
</p>
<p>Church, next to the Prophet himself, have been firm and steadfast,
</p>
<p>left the Church, and the Priesthood, gifts and powers that God gave
</p>
<p>to him were given to another. If this man could not stand, who
</p>
<p>can expect to stand in this Church? And all who knew his history
</p>
<p>know what the cause was. He indulged in impurity; he was un-
</p>
<p>virtuous. In consequence of this he lost the Spirit of God and fell
</p>
<p>into darkness, and was severed from the Church of Christ. And
</p>
<p>he is not alone. I might mention the names of a number who are
</p>
<p>distinguished in our history who met with the same fate. The
</p>
<p>Lord will not tolerate impurity. No matter what a man may know,
</p>
<p>or what testimony he may have, if he commits sin, unless he re-
</p>
<p>pents, the Lord will not bear with him. If he does not repent, the

<p>AN INTERVIEW WITH OLIVER COWDERY
</p>
<p>My father, Jacob Gates, while on his way to England, in 1849,
</p>
<p>stopped at the town of Richmond, where lived at that time Oliver
</p>
<p>Cowdery. Hearing that Oliver was in poor health, and wishing
</p>
<p>to renew old acquaintance, as they had been friends in earlier days,
</p>
<p>father called on him at his home. Their conversation, during the
</p>
<p>visit drifted to early Church history, and to their mutual experi-
</p>
<p>ences during the troublous times in Missouri and Illinois. Finally
</p>
<p>father put this question to him : "Oliver, I want you to tell me the
</p>
<p>whole truth about your testimony concerning the Book of Mormon
</p>
<p> the testimony sent forth to the world over your signature and
</p>
<p>found in the front of that book. Was your testimony based on a
</p>
<p>dream, was it the imagination of your mind, was it an illusion, a
</p>
<p>myth tell me truthfully?"
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 341
</p>
<p>To question him thus seemed to touch Oliver very deeply. He
</p>
<p>answered not a word, but arose from his easy chair, went to the
</p>
<p>book case, took down a Book of Mormon of the first edition, turned
</p>
<p>to the testimony of the Three Witnesses, and read in the most
</p>
<p>solemn manner the words to which he had subscribed his name,
</p>
<p>nearly twenty years before. Facing my father, he said: "Jacob,
</p>
<p>I want you to remember what I say to you. I am a dying man, and
</p>
<p>what would it profit me to tell you a lie? I know," said he, "that
</p>
<p>this Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God.
</p>
<p>My eyes saw, my ears heard, and my understanding was touched,
</p>
<p>and I know that whereof I testified is true. It was no dream, no
</p>
<p>vain imagination of the mind ; it was real."
</p>
<p>Then father asked him about the angel under whose hands
</p>
<p>he received the priesthood, to which he made answer thus : "Jacob,
</p>
<p>I felt the hand of the angel on my head as plainly as I could feel
</p>
<p>yours, and could hear his voice as I now hear yours."
</p>
<p>Then father asked the question : "If all that you tell me is true,
</p>
<p>why did you leave the Church?" Oliver made only this explanation ;
</p>
<p>said he, "When I left the Church, I felt wicked, I felt like shedding
</p>
<p>blood, but I have got all over that now."

<p>FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY
</p>
<p>"You will see the old man go down to the grave in disgrace.
</p>
<p>He has cast off his political friends, and they cast him off as a thing
</p>
<p>of naught, and he will become a hiss and a byword."

<p>The prophecy we have quoted, is extracted from a sermon de-
</p>
<p>livered by President Brigham Young in Great Salt Lake City, in the
</p>
<p>year 1861, and relates to James Buchanan, ex-President of the
</p>
<p>United States. The fulfilment of prophecy is a theme to which of

</p>
<p>late we have frequently alluded; but we have never witnessed a
</p>
<p>more speedy and direct fulfilment of the predictions of the servants
</p>
<p>of God than in the case of the ex-President.
</p>
<p>To convey a correct understanding to others  a proper real-
</p>
<p>ization of the judgments of God  we shall quote the testimony of
</p>
<p>those who have nothing in common with the Latter-day Saints,
</p>
<p>contained in the New York Tribune, and we have no reason to doubt
</p>
<p>the testimony offered. To enable all classes to better comprehend
</p>
<p>the great revolution which has taken place in the circumstances of
</p>
<p>the ex-President, it will be necessary to state, that only five short
</p>
<p>years have passed since he stood at the head of one of the most
</p>
<p>promising Republics the world ever saw, wielding a power inferior
</p>
<p>to that of no potentate or emperor upon the face of our globe. When
</p>
<p>we consider this, and contrast his present degradation with his
</p>
<p>former greatness, we are inclined to pity, did we not know that it
</p>
<p>is a just retribution for the sordid wretch who sold his honor for
</p>
<p>foreign gold, bartering the blood of innocence for a little of this
</p>
<p>world's honor, which he enjoyed only long enough to appreciate the
</p>
<p>342 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>height from which he has so suddenly fallen. "Vengeance is mine,
</p>
<p>saith the Lord, and I will repay." If the Utonians had had the
</p>
<p>punishing of James Buchanan, they never could have inflicted on
</p>
<p>him the excruciating torture which has been his, and under which
</p>
<p>he is still writhing, meted out to him, as it has been, by those very
</p>
<p>individuals to whose pampered appetites and whims he had pan-
</p>
<p>dered, braving the powers of heaven, and trampling under his feet
</p>
<p>every just law, both human and divine, to gratify the parasites who
</p>
<p>were sapping the life-blood of the Union. The American people
</p>
<p>think today it is the nation that has forsaken James Buchanan ; in
</p>
<p>one sense of the word this is true; but can they realize that they
</p>
<p>are merely instruments in the hands of God in carrying out His
</p>
<p>purposes?
</p>
<p>Why did the nation desert him? They offer us a reason, "The
</p>
<p>ex-President did not trust the people"; but he did trust them as
</p>
<p>much as it is possible for a wire-pulling politician, who is today
</p>
<p>buoyant with hope, and tomorrow lean and sunken almost to de-
</p>
<p>spair, to trust his fellowmen. No! it is the curse of an avenging
</p>
<p>God that rests down upon him, and many generations will pass
</p>
<p>before that silly old man can emerge from the punishment he so
</p>
<p>justly merits and is now enduring.
</p>
<p>The following sentence uttered by him previous to the desola-
</p>
<p>ting war which has partially subsided in the United States, is suf-
</p>
<p>ficient to cause his name to be stricken from the scrolls of liberty,
</p>
<p>and be forever denied a place among the sons of freedom 
</p>
<p>"Slavery is more sinned against than sinning." God gave all men
</p>
<p>their freedom, but "Man's inhumanity to man" has crushed mil-
</p>
<p>lions, not only in the United States, but on the continent of Europe,
</p>
<p>more especially in Catholic countries; and we can easily trace fur-
</p>
<p>ther east, and say that millions are held in bondage in free and
</p>
<p>enlightened England. It is, however, not our province to point out
</p>
<p>the failings and short-comings of any nation in this article, but to

<p>hold up to the world another proof that the kingdom of God is
</p>
<p>established on the earth, and that men can foretell the dealings of
</p>
<p>the Almighty with the wicked throughout the nations.
</p>
<p>Witness the heading of this article, and the following quota-
</p>
<p>tion from the New York Tribune  "The last five years must have
</p>
<p>been full of bitter days to James Buchanan. To live in silence, and
</p>
<p>retirement and obloquy,  his name the most detested of any name
</p>
<p>in America ; to sit in his home, with the years rapidly bending him
</p>
<p>to the grave, and feel that, after so much power and honor, and,
</p>
<p>above all, so many opportunities, he was the most unpopular of
</p>
<p>Americans,  to feel this and yet to know that he was partly the
</p>
<p>victim of fate, that after all he had been merely a whirling mariner
</p>
<p>in a hurricane  the weakest, most muddled, most distracted sea-
</p>
<p>man, it is true, that ever went out upon the salt seas ; and that for
</p>
<p>the life of him he could not tell whether the ship was on her keel
</p>
<p>or on her beam-ends  that his statesmanship was scribbling and
</p>
<p>praying, and that he meant to do what was best, even while doing
</p>
<p>the worst,  to sit and hear nothing but imprecations from a people
</p>
<p>he had served for fifty years ; to be cursed by mothers who had lost
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 343
</p>
<p>their children; to have no friends even among the people of the
</p>
<p>South, for whom he sacrificed all  this is a retribution more ter-
</p>
<p>rible than that of Belisarius wandering in poverty and blindness, or
</p>
<p>the discrowned Lear on the storm-beaten moor wielding the sceptre
</p>
<p>of straw."
</p>
<p>Here, then, we look upon James Buchanan sinking into a lone-
</p>
<p>ly grave  not even a wife or child to mourn over his forsaken bier 
</p>
<p>standing on the verge of eternity, with not a single ray to lighten
</p>
<p>his midnight journey; longing for death, and yet starting back in
</p>
<p>terror when the grim monster appears; wishing to rend the veil,
</p>
<p>and yet not daring to meet the calm, searching glance of his Cre-
</p>
<p>ator; dreading the doom which conscience in thunder-tones pro-
</p>
<p>claims for broken laws and mis-spent time  a thing for which we
</p>
<p>can have pity but which is far too contemptible to despise.

<p>FATE OF PERSECUTORS OF MISSIONARIES
</p>
<p>(Many dozens of such instances can be compiled and published.)
</p>
<p>Elder Bedson Eardley, while traveling in the Norwich con-
</p>
<p>ference, England, in June, 1875, held a camp meeting one Sunday
</p>
<p>near one of the large cities of his district. After the close of the
</p>
<p>services, seven repentant persons handed in their names and re-
</p>
<p>quested baptism. An appointment was accordingly made for the
</p>
<p>next evening, immediately after the close of a meeting for which
</p>
<p>arrangements had already been made.
</p>
<p>Agreeable to his promise, Brother Eardley proceeded the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing evening to the place chosen for the baptism. His converts
</p>
<p>were ready for him and he had just entered the stream, leading
</p>
<p>a man by the hand, when a mob came upon the scene with loud
</p>
<p>shouts and curses. A large, strong man, whom he subsequently
</p>
<p>learned was a well-to-do blacksmith, emerged from the crowd. He
</p>
<p>walked to the bank of the creek, which was about four feet above
</p>
<p>the water in which Brother Eardley was standing, and, with a

</p>
<p>heavy stick, dealt him a severe blow across the top of the head. So
</p>
<p>much force was exerted that it appeared as though the skull would
</p>
<p>certainly be crushed. But, strange to say, the Elder experienced
</p>
<p>not the slightest pain or inconvenience from the blow  the Lord
</p>
<p>had protected him. Notwithstanding the cruelty of the blow, he
</p>
<p>felt no desire to retaliate ; for the Spirit whispered, "The Lord will
</p>
<p>take care of him."
</p>
<p>The bitterness of this man did not cease, and it was finally
</p>
<p>predicted by an Elder of the Church that, as a punishment for his
</p>
<p>sins, he would be afflicted so that in his agony he would crawl
</p>
<p>along a wall and seek death but not find it. This prediction was
</p>
<p>very soon literally fulfilled : The man contracted an incurable dis-
</p>
<p>ease, and was seen for months crawling along by a wall, vainly
</p>
<p>seeking death ; and he expressed his belief that his affliction was a
</p>
<p>punishment for having so shamefully treated the "Mormon" Elder.

<p>NONE WILL PROSPER WHO FIGHT AGAINST
</p>
<p>MORMONISM
</p>
<p>By George Q. Cannon
</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact  and I wish you all to pay attention to
</p>
<p>it, if you have not already done so  that no man prospers who
</p>
<p>fights against this work. You let your minds reflect upon the days
</p>
<p>of the past in this Territory, and if you have read the history of
</p>
<p>the people and ask yourselves, "Where are the men who were
</p>
<p>distinguished at one time among their fellow-men, who have suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded in life, who have left a name and a fame behind them who
</p>
<p>have fought against this work?" I mean a name and a fame that
</p>
<p>are not beclouded. If their sun was bright, it has gone down in
</p>
<p>gloom, including Presidents of the United States, including judges,
</p>
<p>senators, congressmen, and others whom we have had in our own
</p>
<p>Territory. Where are they? Take it from the beginning, from
</p>
<p>Brocchus Day and Brandenbury, who came to this land. I have
</p>
<p>watched them closely. I have been familiar with them  men in
</p>
<p>Congress and men out of Congress, men of position in the Terri-
</p>
<p>tory, and men out of position in the Territory  and there is not one
</p>
<p>that I know of whose example I would like to follow or whose fate
</p>
<p>I would like to have. So it will be to the end. "No weapon that is
</p>
<p>formed against thee shall prosper ; and every tongue that shall rise

</p>
<p>against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn." This is the word
</p>
<p>of the Lord uttered thousands of years ago concerning His work
</p>
<p>in the last days. It has been fulfilled ; and it will be fulfilled. These
</p>
<p>are blessings that God has given to us, to be delivered, to be strength-
</p>
<p>ened, to be united, to have the love of one another. What is im-
</p>
<p>prisonment? What are trials and difficulties and troubles? What
</p>
<p>man is there who would shrink from trials or even death if he knew
</p>
<p>that he had the love of his f ellowmen, if he had their affection and
</p>
<p>their confidence? And this is what we have. We are banded to-
</p>
<p>gether by indissoluble ties ; they cannot be severed ; they are strong-
</p>
<p>er than steel. Yes, they are stronger than death.
</p>
<p>This people are solidified by the power of God, by the outpour-
</p>
<p>ing of the Holy Ghost. God has poured out this great love from
</p>
<p>heaven upon us. In every land where the Elders go and baptize the
</p>
<p>children of men, there is a spirit of love descends upon us who are
</p>
<p>baptized. The Elders have friends who would die for them. An

<p>the Church and the Spirit of God rests upon them, they uphold him
</p>
<p>and feel as though they would lay down their lives for him, so great
</p>
<p>is their love for the man who brings them the Gospel. Who of the
</p>
<p>Elders that have traveled that do not know this to be true? Who
</p>
<p>of the Saints that have been baptized abroad that cannot bear
</p>
<p>testimony to this throughout these mountains ?

<p>FATE OF RAIDERS OF L, D. S. HOMES
</p>
<p>During the days of the "underground" when so many of our
</p>
<p>leading men were compelled to leave home to avoid spending a
</p>
<p>term in the penitentiary, our home was under almost constant
</p>
<p>observation. There were four deputy marshals who were de-
</p>
<p>termined to "get" my father. Their names were Steele, Whetstone,
</p>
<p>Exum, and McClellan. All of these men hated our people and did
</p>
<p>everything they could to hurt and destroy us. I was but a small
</p>
<p>boy and was terrified to meet any one of them.
</p>
<p>As the years passed by I had occasion to observe what seemed
</p>
<p>to be retribution that was meted out to these men. Steele went
</p>
<p>blind and groped his way about Ogden for years, and apparently
</p>
<p>lived in poverty. He was an object of pity  a pitiable sight. Whet-
</p>
<p>stone was shot and killed in a saloon brawl at 2 or 3 o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning. What happened to Exum himself I don't know, but what
</p>
<p>happened to his son was perhaps as hard for him to bear as any-
</p>
<p>thing that might have happened to him. His son was a handsome
</p>
<p>fellow. He attended the same school I did. As I remember it, he
</p>
<p>was the only son of his father, and the apple of his father's eye.
</p>
<p>When he was about ten years old he contracted a disease that
</p>
<p>seemed to be beyond the ability of the doctors to control. He stopped
</p>
<p>growing, and turned a sickly yellow color. One leg became stiff
</p>
<p>as though there were no joint in it. That is as I remember him
</p>
<p>the last time I saw him.

<p>became of him. It would be interesting to know.

</p>
<p>PROPHETIC FATE OF STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS
</p>
<p>On the morning of November 28, 1839, he (Joseph Smith the
</p>
<p>Prophet) and Judge Higbee arrived at Washington, and on the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing day they went to the White House, the residence of the
</p>
<p>President of the United States. They were soon shown into an
</p>
<p>upper apartment, where they met President Van Buren and were
</p>
<p>introduced into his parlor. There they presented their letters of
</p>
<p>introduction to him. As soon as he had read one of them, he looked
</p>
<p>upon Brothers Joseph and Higbee with a kind of half frown, and
</p>
<p>said, "What can I do? I can do nothing for you ! If I do anything
</p>
<p>I shall come in contact with the whole State of Missouri." But the
</p>
<p>brethren were not to be thus intimidated ; they demanded a hearing
</p>
<p>and constitutional rights, when the President finally promised to
</p>
<p>reconsider what he had said, and observed that he felt to sympa-
</p>
<p>thize with the Saints because of their sufferings. * * *
</p>
<p>Van Buren did not make a favorable impression upon Joseph,
</p>
<p>who describes him as a small man with sandy complexion, ordinary
</p>
<p>features, a frowning brow and an ill proportioned body; "and to
</p>
<p>come directly to the point," he adds, "he is so much a fop or a fool
</p>

</p>
<p>(for he judged our case before he knew it), that we could find no
</p>
<p>place to put truth into him."
</p>
<p>After their interview with the President they visited the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of congress from Illinois, and delivered the letters of introduc-
</p>
<p>tion which they had for them. These members were generally dis-
</p>
<p>posed to favor Joseph and the Saints, and this was not without
</p>
<p>cause. The Saints who had moved to Illinois were numerous, and
</p>
<p>the men and party in whose favor their votes would be cast at an
</p>
<p>election would be sure to win, as the two great political parties in
</p>
<p>the State were about equally divided as to number at that time.
</p>
<p>The members of Congress knew this, and as politicians it was to
</p>
<p>their interest to do what they could for the Saints. Consequently
</p>
<p>they met together and decided, after discussing the subject, that a
</p>
<p>memorial and petition should be drawn up in a concise manner,
</p>
<p>and that Judge Young, who was senator from Illinois, should pre-
</p>
<p>sent the same to the Senate. It was expected that the matter would
</p>
<p>be referred to the proper committee with all the accompanying
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 347
</p>
<p>documents, and be printed. But all of Joseph's exertions, as well
</p>
<p>as the testimonies, affidavits and other documents which they laid
</p>
<p>before Congress, failed to have any effect. Neither the President,
</p>
<p>nor the Senate and House of Representatives would do anything
</p>
<p>to call the State of Missouri to account for the inhuman wrongs
</p>
<p>which her people had inflicted upon unoffending free-born Ameri-
</p>
<p>can citizens. The Church had appealed to governors and judges,
</p>
<p>and now, through its President, it appealed to the Chief Executive
</p>
<p>of the nation, and the Congress, in which every State in the Re-
</p>
<p>public was represented  the highest authority in the land. There
</p>
<p>was no redress to be obtained from them; nothing further could
</p>
<p>be done, therefore, but to leave them in the hands of the Lord, who,
</p>
<p>in his own due time, will plead the cause of His people.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to read Joseph's views respecting the men he
</p>
<p>was thrown in contact with at Washington. "For a general thing,"
</p>
<p>he said, "there is but little solidity and honorable deportment among
</p>
<p>those who are sent to represent the people; but a great deal of
</p>
<p>pomposity and show. * * * There is such an itching disposition to
</p>
<p>display their oratory on the most trivial occasion, and so much
</p>
<p>etiquette, bowing and scraping, twisting and turning to make a
</p>
<p>display of their witticisms, that it seems to us rather a display of
</p>
<p>folly and show, more than substance and gravity, such as becomes
</p>
<p>a great nation like ours. However, there are some exceptions."
</p>
<p>In the latter part of January, 1840, Joseph left Philadelphia
</p>
<p>accompanied by Brothers Rockwell, Higbee and Foster, and again
</p>
<p>visited Washington. Sidney Rigdon joined Joseph at Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>but was still sick, and had to be left there. On his second visit to
</p>
<p>the capitol Joseph had another interview^ with President Van Buren
</p>
<p>who treated him very insolently. He listened very reluctantly to
</p>
<p>what Joseph had to say, and in reply uttered that sentiment which
</p>
<p>has obtained such a deservedly widespread notoriety among the
</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints: "Gentlemen, your cause is just but I can do

<p>nothing for you : and if I take up for you I shall lose the vote of
</p>
<p>Missouri."
</p>
<p>Respecting this interview, Joseph remarks : "His whole course
</p>
<p>went to show that he was an office-seeker, that self-aggrandize-
</p>
<p>ment was his ruling passion, and that justice and righteousness
</p>
<p>were no part of his composition. I found him such a man as I
</p>
<p>could not conscientiously support at the head of our great Republic."
</p>
<p>Joseph also had an interview with John C. Calhoun, senator from
</p>
<p>South Carolina ; but his treatment of Joseph was such as very ill
</p>
<p>became his station. While conversing with him concerning the
</p>
<p>persecution of the Saints, this renowned statesman said: "It in-
</p>
<p>volves a nice question  the question of States rights ; it will not do
</p>
<p>to agitate it." Henry Clay, another prominent senator, whose as-
</p>
<p>sistance Joseph also sought, coldly remarked, in alluding to the
</p>
<p>Saints: "You had better go to Oregon. * * *"
</p>
<p>About four hundred and ninety-one persons held claims against
</p>
<p>Missouri. These Joseph had presented to Congress. These claims
</p>
<p>amounted, in all, to $1,381,044.51. But they were not all. There
</p>
<p>was a multitude of similar bills which were to be presented, and
</p>
<p>348 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>respecting which Joseph said: "If not settled immediately, they
</p>
<p>will ere long amount to a handsome sum, increasing by compound
</p>
<p>interest."
</p>
<p>Becoming satisfied that there was very little use for him to
</p>
<p>tarry to press the just claims of the Saints on the attention of the
</p>
<p>President and Congress, he left Washington in company with
</p>
<p>Brother 0. P. Rockwell and Dr. Foster, and started on the home-
</p>
<p>ward journey February 6, 1840.
</p>
<p>Brother Elias Higbee stayed at Washington to have further
</p>
<p>interviews with the congressional committee, and for several years
</p>
<p>he labored faithfully, introducing additional testimony concerning
</p>
<p>the Missouri persecution. The committee reported against Congress
</p>
<p>doing anything about the business ; and that redress could only be
</p>
<p>had in the Missouri courts and legislature.
</p>
<p>Wednesday, March 4, 1840, writes Joseph, "I arrived safely
</p>
<p>at Nauvoo, after a wearisome journey through alternate snows and
</p>
<p>mud, having witnessed many vexatious movements in government
</p>
<p>officers, whose sole object should be the peace and prosperity and
</p>
<p>happiness of the ivhole people; but instead of this, I discovered that
</p>
<p>popular clamor and personal aggrandizement were the ruling prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of those in authority; and my heart faints tvithin me when 1
</p>
<p>see, by the visions of the Almighty, the end of this nation, if she
</p>
<p>continues to disregard the cries and petitions of her virtuous
</p>
<p>citizens, as she has done, and is noiv doing. * * *
</p>
<p>In speaking about the refusal of the government to grant
</p>
<p>the Saints redress for the wrongs they had suffered, he says:
</p>
<p>"Since Congress has decided against us, the Lord has begun to
</p>
<p>vex the nation, and he will continue to do so, except they repent ;
</p>
<p>for they now stand guilty of murder, robbery and plunder, as a
</p>
<p>nation, because they have refused to protect their citizens and to
</p>
<p>execute justice according to their own Constitution."

</p>
<p>In passing through Carthage on his return from a preaching
</p>
<p>mission to Ramus, May 18, 1843, Joseph dined with Judge Stephen A.
</p>
<p>Douglas, who was there holding court. After dinner, Joseph, at the
</p>
<p>judge's request, occupied three hours in giving him a minute history
</p>
<p>of the persecutions of the Saints in Missouri. The judge listened
</p>
<p>attentively, and spoke warmly in condemnation of the conduct of
</p>
<p>Governor Lilburn W. Boggs and the authorities of Missouri, and said
</p>
<p>that any people who had acted as the mobs of Missouri had done
</p>
<p>ought to be punished. Joseph, in conclusion, said:
</p>
<p>"I prophecy, in the name of the Lord God of Israel, unless the
</p>
<p>United States redress the tvrongs committed upon the Saints in the
</p>
<p>State of Missouri and punish the crimes committed by officers,
</p>
<p>that in a few years the government tvill be utterly overthrown and
</p>
<p>ivasted, and there ivill not be so much as a potsherd left for their
</p>
<p>wickedness in permitting the murder of men, ivomen and children,
</p>
<p>and the wholesale plunder and extermination of thousands of her
</p>
<p>citizens to go unpunished, thereby perpetrating a foul and corroding
</p>
<p>blot upon the fair fame of this great republic, the very thought of

</p>
<p>which would have caused the high-minded and patriotic f tamers of
</p>
<p>the Constitution of the United States to hide their faces ivith shame.
</p>
<p>Judge, you will aspire to the Presidency of the United States, and
</p>
<p>if you ever turn your hand against me or the Latter-day Saints, you
</p>
<p>will feel the weight of the hand of the Almighty upon you; and you
</p>
<p>will live to see and know that I have testified the truth to you, for
</p>
<p>the conversation of this day will stick to you through life."

</p>
<p>ELDER B. H. ROBERTS' PRESENTATION OF FACTS
</p>
<p>This prophecy was first published in Utah, in the Deseret News
</p>
<p>of September 24, 1856 ; it was afterwards published in England, in
</p>
<p>the Millennial Star, February, 1859 (Vol. 21, No. 9). In both in-
</p>
<p>stances it is found in the History of Joseph Smith, then being pub-
</p>
<p>lished in sections in those periodicals. Stephen A. Douglas did aspire
</p>
<p>to the presidency of the United States, and was nominated for that
</p>
<p>office by the Democratic Convention, held in Charleston, on the
</p>
<p>23rd of June, 1860. When in the convention he was declared the
</p>
<p>regular nominee of the Democratic party, "the whole body rose to
</p>
<p>its feet, hats were waved in the air and many tossed aloft ; shouts,
</p>
<p>screams, and yells and every boisterous mode of expressing ap-
</p>
<p>probation and unanimity, were resorted to." (See Cooper's Ameri-
</p>
<p>can Politics, Book 1, p. 86.)
</p>
<p>When Mr. Douglas aspired to the presidency, no man in the
</p>
<p>history of American politics had more reason to hope for success.
</p>
<p>The political party of which he was the recognized leader, in the
</p>
<p>preceding presidential election had polled 174 electoral votes as
</p>
<p>against 122 cast by the other two parties which opposed it; and a
</p>
<p>popular vote of 1,838,169, as against 1,215,798 votes for the two
</p>
<p>parties opposing. It is a matter of history, however, that the Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic party in the election of 1860 was badly divided ; and fractions
</p>
<p>of it put candidates into the field with the following result: Mr.
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, candidate of the Republican party, was tri-

</p>
<p>umphantly elected. He received 180 electoral votes; Mr. Breckin-
</p>
<p>ridge received 72 electoral votes ; Mr. Bell, 39 ; and Mr. Douglas 12.
</p>
<p>"By a plurality count of the popular vote, Mr. Lincoln carried 18
</p>
<p>states; Mr. Breckinridge 11; Mr. Bell 3, and Mr. Douglas but 1!"
</p>
<p>(See tables in American Politics, Book -7, pp. 22, 26; also History
</p>
<p>of U. S. by Alexander H. Stephens, p. 559.) Twenty days less than
</p>
<p>one year after his nomination by the Charleston convention, while
</p>
<p>yet in the prime of manhood  forty-eight years of age  Mr. Doug-
</p>
<p>las died at his home in Chicago, a disappointed, not to say heart-
</p>
<p>broken man.
</p>
<p>Let us now search out the cause of his failure. Fourteen years
</p>
<p>after the interview containing the prophecy had been published in
</p>
<p>the Deseret News, Mr. Douglas was called upon to deliver a speech
</p>
<p>in Springfield, the capital of Illinois. His speech was delivered on
</p>
<p>the 12th of June, 1857; and published in the Missouri Republican
</p>
<p>of June 18th, 1857. It was a time of much excitement throughout
</p>
<p>the country concerning the Mormon Church in Utah. Falsehoods
</p>
<p>upon the posting winds seemed to have filled the air with the most
</p>
<p>350 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>outrageous calumny. Crimes the most repulsive  murders, rob-
</p>
<p>beries, rebellion, and high treason  were falsely charged against
</p>
<p>its leaders. It was well known that Mr. Douglas had been on
</p>
<p>terms of intimate friendship with the Prophet Joseph Smith; and
</p>
<p>was well acquainted with the other church leaders. He was there-
</p>
<p>fore looked upon as one competent to speak upon the "Mormon
</p>
<p>Question," and was invited to do so in the speech to which reference
</p>
<p>is here made. Mr. Douglas responded to the request. He grouped
</p>
<p>the charges against the Mormons which were then passing cur-
</p>
<p>rent, in the following manner:
</p>
<p>"First, that nine-tenths of the inhabitants are aliens by birth who have
</p>
<p>refused to become naturalized, or to take the oath of allegiance, or do any
</p>
<p>other act recognizing the government of the United States as a paramount
</p>
<p>authority in the territory (Utah).
</p>
<p>"Second, that the inhabitants, whether native or alien born, known as
</p>
<p>Mormons (and they constitute the whole people of the territory) are bound
</p>
<p>by horrible oaths, and terrible penalties, to recognize and maintain the au-
</p>
<p>thority of Brigham Young, and the government of which he is head, as
</p>
<p>paramount to that of the United States, in civil as well as in religious affairs;
</p>
<p>and they will in due time, and under the direction of their leaders, use all the
</p>
<p>means in their power to subvert the government of the United States and
</p>
<p>resist its authority.
</p>
<p>"Third, that the Mormon government, with Brigham Young at its head,
</p>
<p>is now forming alliance with Indian tribes in Utah and adjoining territories 
</p>
<p>stimulating the Indians to acts of hostility  and organizing bands of his own
</p>
<p>followers under the name of Danites or destroying angels, to prosecute a
</p>
<p>system of robbery and murders upon American citizens who support the au-
</p>
<p>thority of the United States, and denounce the infamous and disgusting prac-
</p>
<p>tices and institutions of the Mormon government."
</p>
<p>Mr. Douglas based his remarks upon these rumors against
</p>
<p>the saints in the course of which he said :
</p>
<p>"Let us have these facts in an official shape before the president and
</p>

</p>
<p>congress and the country will soon learn that, in the performance of the high
</p>
<p>and solemn duty devolving upon the executive and congress, there will be no
</p>
<p>vacillating or hesitating policy. It will be as prompt as the peal that follows
</p>
<p>the flash  as stern and unyielding as death. Should such a state of things
</p>
<p>actually exist as we are led to infer from the reports  and such information
</p>
<p>comes in an official shape  the knife must be applied to this pestiferous, dis-
</p>
<p>gusting cancer which is gnawing into the very vitals of the body politic. It
</p>
<p>must be cut out by the roots and seared over by the red hot iron of stern and
</p>
<p>unflinching law. * * * Should all efforts fail to bring them (the Mormons) to
</p>
<p>a sense of their duty, there is but one remedy left. Repeal the organic law of
</p>
<p>the territory, on the ground that they are alien enemies and outlaws, unfit
</p>
<p>to be citizens of a territory, much less ever to become citizens of one of the
</p>
<p>free and independent states of this confederacy. To protect them further in
</p>
<p>their treasonable, disgusting and bestial practices would be a disgrace to
</p>
<p>the country  a disgrace to humanity  a disgrace to civilization, and a dis-
</p>
<p>grace to the spirit of the age. Blot it out of the organized territories of the
</p>
<p>United States. What then? It will be regulated by the law of 1790, which has
</p>
<p>exclusive and sole jurisdiction over all the territory not incorporated under
</p>
<p>any organic or special law. By the provisions of this law, all crimes and mis-
</p>
<p>demeanors, committed on its soil, can be tried before the legal authorities of
</p>
<p>any state or territory to which the offenders shall be first brought to trial,
</p>
<p>and punished. Under that law persons have been arrested in Kansas, Nebraska
</p>
<p>and other territories, prior to their organization as territories, and hanged
</p>
<p>for their crimes. The law of 1790 has sole and exclusive jurisdiction where no
</p>
<p>other law of a local character exists, and by repealing the organic law of
</p>
<p>Utah, you give to the general government of the United States the whole and
</p>
<p>sole jurisdiction over the territory."
</p>
<p>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERINGS OF PERSECUTORS 351
</p>
<p>The speech of Mr. Douglas was of great interest and impor-
</p>
<p>tance to the people of Utah at that juncture. Mr. Douglas had it
</p>
<p>in his power to do them a great good. Because of his personal
</p>
<p>acquaintance with Joseph Smith and the great body of the Mor-
</p>
<p>mon people then in Utah, as well as their leaders (for he had
</p>
<p>known both leaders and people in Illinois, and those whom he had
</p>
<p>known in Illinois constituted the great bulk of the people in Utah,
</p>
<p>when he delivered that Springfield speech)  he knew that the re-
</p>
<p>ports carried to the east by vicious and corrupt men were not true.
</p>
<p>He knew that these reports, in the main, were but a rehash of the
</p>
<p>old exploded charges made against Joseph Smith and his follow-
</p>
<p>ers in Missouri and Illinois ; and he knew them to be false by many
</p>
<p>evidences furnished him by Joseph Smith in the interview of the
</p>
<p>18th of May, 1843, and by the Mormon people at sundry times dur-
</p>
<p>ing his association with them at Nauvoo. He had an opportunity
</p>
<p>to befriend the innocent ; to refute the calumnies cast upon a virtu-
</p>
<p>ous community; to speak a word in behalf of the oppressed; but
</p>
<p>the demagogue triumphed over the statesman, the politician over
</p>
<p>the humanitarian; and to avoid the popular censure which he
</p>
<p>feared befriending the Mormon people would bring to him, he
</p>
<p>turned his hand against them, with the result that he did not de-
</p>
<p>stroy them but sealed his own doom  in fulfillment of the words
</p>
<p>of the prophet, he felt the weight of the hand of the Almighty
</p>
<p>upon him.
</p>
<p>It was impossible for any merely human sagacity to foresee
</p>
<p>the events predicted in this prophecy. Stephen A. Douglas was
</p>
<p>a bright, but comparatively an unknown man at the time of the
</p>
<p>interview, in May, 1843. There is and can be no question about
</p>
<p>the prophecy preceding the event. It was published, as before
</p>
<p>stated, in the Deseret Neivs of the 24th of September, 1856 ; about
</p>
<p>one year before the Douglas speech at Springfield, in June, 1857 ;
</p>
<p>and about four years before Douglas was nominated for the presi-

</p>
<p>dency by the Charleston Democratic Convention.
</p>
<p>Moreover, a lengthy review of Mr. Douglas' speech was pub-
</p>
<p>lished in the editorial columns of the Deseret News in the issue of
</p>
<p>that paper for September 2nd, 1857, of which the following is the
</p>
<p>closing paragraph, addressed directly to Mr. Douglas :
</p>
<p>"In your last paragraph (of the Springfield speech) you say,
</p>
<p>'I have thus presented to you plainly and fairly my viezvs of the
</p>
<p>Utah question.' With at least equal plainness and far more fair-
</p>
<p>ness have your vieivs now been commented upon. And inasmuch
</p>
<p>as you ivere ivell acquainted ivith Joseph Smith and his people, also
</p>
<p>ivith the character of your maligners, and did know their allega-
</p>
<p>tions were false, but must bark with the dogs who ivere snapping at
</p>
<p>our heels, to let them know that you ivere a dog ivith them; and
</p>
<p>also that you may have a testimony of the truth of the assertion
</p>
<p>that you did know Joseph Smith and his people and the char-
</p>
<p>acter of their enemies, (and neither class have changed, only as the
</p>
<p>saints have grown better and their enemies worse) ; and also that
</p>
<p>you may thoroughly understand that you have voluntarily, know-
</p>
<p>ingly, and of choice sealed your damnation, and by your own chosen
</p>
<p>352 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>course have closed your chance for the Presidential chair through
</p>
<p>disobeying the counsel of Joseph, which you formerly sought and
</p>
<p>prospered by following, and that you in common with us may testify
</p>
<p>to all the world that Joseph was a true prophet, the following
</p>
<p>extract from the history of Joseph Smith is again printed for your
</p>
<p>benefit, and is kindly recommended to your careful perusal and
</p>
<p>most candid consideration." . .Here follows the interview with
</p>
<p>Judge Douglas.
</p>
<p>I have been careful to state in full all the circumstances con-
</p>
<p>nected with this remarkable prophecy in order that there might
</p>
<p>be no question in relation to the prophecy itself, that is, no ques-
</p>
<p>tion as to the prediction preceding the event, and its complete and
</p>
<p>miraculous fulfillment. And now I have reached the point for the
</p>
<p>argument.
</p>
<p>The prophecy is a fact. Its fulfillment is a fact. God glorious-
</p>
<p>ly fulfilled the prediction of His servant Joseph Smith, the prophet.
</p>
<p>Stephen A. Douglas did aspire to the presidency of the United
</p>
<p>States. He received the nomination for that high office from a
</p>
<p>great political party. But he had raised his hand against the
</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints, the people of the Prophet Joseph Smith; and
</p>
<p>as a consequence he did feel the iveight of the hand of the Almighty
</p>
<p>upon him; for all his hopes were blasted; he never reached the goal
</p>
<p>of his ambition; he failed miserably , and died wretchedly, ivhen
</p>
<p>his life had but reached high noon. Could anything be more clear
</p>
<p>than that Stephen A. Douglas felt the iveight of the hand of the
</p>
<p>Almighty upon him? But mark you, these calamities came upon
</p>
<p>him for striking the saints of God in Utah. It was for turning his
</p>
<p>hand against them that he ivas disappointed in his hopes, blasted
</p>
<p>in his expectations, and died heartbroken. And when the Almighty
</p>
<p>thus vindicated the predictions of his prophet upon the head of
</p>
<p>this great man, He also did something more  He acknowledged the
</p>
<p>saints in Utah as His people, the Church in Utah as His Church,

</p>
<p>and there is no escaping the conclusion.
</p>
<p>Under the date of November 27, 1860, Orson Hyde wrote to
</p>
<p>Judge Douglas, from Ephraim, Utah Territory, as follows :
</p>
<p>"Will the Judge now acknowledge that Joseph ivas a true
</p>
<p>Prophet? If he ivill not, does he recollect a certain conversation had
</p>
<p>with Mr. Smith, at the house of Sheriff Backenstos, in Carthage x
</p>
<p>Illinois, in the year 1843, in which Mr. Smith said to him, 'You will
</p>
<p>yet aspire to the Presidency of the United States. But if you ever
</p>
<p>raise your hand, or your voice against the Latter-day Saints, you
</p>
<p>shall never be President of the United States.'
</p>
<p>"Does Judge Douglas recollect that in a public speech delivered
</p>
<p>by him in the year 1857, at Springfield, Illinois, of comparing the
</p>
<p>Mormon community, then constituting the inhabitants of the Utah
</p>
<p>Territory, to a 'loathsome ulcer on the body politic/ and of recom-
</p>
<p>mending the knife to be applied to cut it out?
</p>
<p>"Among other things the Judge ivill doubtless recollect that I
</p>
<p>ivas present and heard the conversation between him and Joseph
</p>
<p>Smith, at Mr. Backenstos* residence in Carthage, before alluded to.
</p>
<p>"Now, Judge, ivhat think you about Joseph Smith and
</p>
<p>Mormonism?" Succession in the Presidency, By B. H. Roberts.
</p>
<p>Addenda
</p>
<p>Important Note: On pages 290-1, mention is made of the
</p>
<p>scourge of cholera among the camp. This is in fulfillment of the
</p>
<p>word of the Lord through Joseph, which is as follows :
</p>
<p>"While we were refreshing ourselves and teams about the
</p>
<p>middle of the day, (June 3), I got up on a wagon wheel, called
</p>
<p>the people together, and said that I would deliver a prophecy.
</p>
<p>After giving the brethren much good advice, exhorting them to
</p>
<p>faithfulness and humility, I said the Lord had revealed to me
</p>
<p>that a scourge would come upon the camp in consequence of the
</p>
<p>fractious and unruly spirits that appeared among them, and they
</p>
<p>should die like sheep with the rot; still, if they would repent and
</p>
<p>humble themselves before the Lord, the scourge, in a great meas-
</p>
<p>ure, might be turned away; but, as the Lord lives, the members
</p>
<p>of this camp will suffer for giving way to their unruly temper. * * *
</p>
<p>On the 2nd (July, 1834) I went down near Liberty, and visited
</p>
<p>the brethren. A considerable number of the camp met me at
</p>
<p>Lyman Wight's. I told them if they would humble themselves
</p>
<p>before the Lord and covenant to keep His commandments and
</p>
<p>obey my counsel, the plague should be stayed from that hour,
</p>
<p>and there should not be another case of the cholera among them.
</p>
<p>The brethren covenanted to that effect with uplifted hands, and
</p>
<p>the plague was stayed." d. H. C. 6:80, 120.
</p>
<p>THE SELF-INFLICTED FATE OF A MOBOCRAT
</p>
<p>"But the tempest of an immediate conflict seemed to be
</p>
<p>checked, and the Jackson mob, to the number of about fifteen,
</p>
<p>with Samuel C. Owens and James Campbell at their head, started
</p>
<p>for Independence, Jackson County, to raise an army sufficient to
</p>
<p>meet me before I could get into Clay County. Campbell swore as
</p>
<p>he adjusted the pistols in his holsters. The eagles and turkey
</p>

<p>after dark, and the angel of God saw fit to sink the boat about the
</p>
<p>middle of the river, and seven out of twelve that attempted to cross
</p>
<p>were drowned. Thus suddenly and justly went they to their own
</p>
<p>place by water. Campbell was among the missing. He floated
</p>
<p>down the river some four or five miles, and lodged upon a pile of
</p>
<p>driftwood, where the eagles, buzzards, ravens, crows and wild
</p>
<p>animals ate his flesh from his bones, to fulfill his own words, and

<p>left him a horrible looking skeleton of God's vengeance : which was

<p>saved his life only after floating four miles down the stream, where

<p>vengeance of God." instructor, Vol. 27.

</p>
<p>PROPHECIES FULFILLED AND YET FUTURE
</p>
<p>By Orson Pratt:
</p>
<p>Prussia ! the glory and pride of Germany ! Why are you thus
</p>
<p>disquieted? Why are your borders menaced with strong and
</p>
<p>powerful armies? Why are the fearful terrors of war already upon
</p>
<p>you? It is because you, through the wickedness of your rulers, and
</p>
<p>your unrighteous laws, rejected the great message which God sent
</p>
<p>to you by his faithful servants. You forbid them to deliver the
</p>
<p>glad tidings of the Gospel in your midst ; you ill-treated them, and
</p>
<p>banished them from your country. If you had repented and turned
</p>
<p>from all your sins, these great evils with which you are now
</p>
<p>threatened would have been averted; but alas! it is now too late;
</p>
<p>that which is decreed upon your devoted land must be fulfilled. As
</p>
<p>you have rejected the only message which will save you, or any
</p>
<p>other nation, God has rejected you, and your king and your nobles,
</p>
<p>and all who sit in high places ; and you shall be brought down and
</p>
<p>humbled ; and the days will shortly come that you will cease to be
</p>
<p>a kingdom ; and if you still persist to fight against God and cast
</p>
<p>out his servants, you shall be utterly overthrown.
</p>
<p>Austria ! the stronghold of Catholicism ! Why have you so
</p>
<p>framed your unholy laws, that the light of truth cannot penetrate
</p>
<p>your country? Why have you effectually shut out all religious
</p>
<p>liberty from the empire? Why do you imprison those who meet
</p>
<p>together to read the Bible? Why do you banish the servants of the
</p>
<p>Most High from your dominions, if they attempt to warn you of
</p>
<p>your iniquities? Do you vainly flatter yourselves, that God will
</p>
<p>not call you to an account? Do you suppose that you can measure
</p>
<p>arms with the Almighty? That you can, with impunity, reject so
</p>
<p>important a message as the one now sent from heaven? That you
</p>
<p>can forever revel in your filth, and glory in the abundance of your
</p>
<p>whoredoms? Your sins have reached the heavens! Your horrible
</p>
<p>abominations have come up before the face of Him who sits upon

<p>the throne, who holds the sword of justice in His own right hand,
</p>
<p>who disposes of kingdoms and empires according to His will, who
</p>
<p>executes fierce judgments upon the nations, and none can stay His
</p>
<p>arm. The great day has come, for mourning, bitter weeping, and
</p>
<p>sore lamentation throughout all your borders! The young, the
</p>
<p>middle-aged, the flower of your armies, the pride and boast of the
</p>
<p>empire, shall be trampled in the dust, and pass away ! Woes, fearful
</p>
<p>desolations, and raging pestilences, will sweep over your guilty
</p>
<p>provinces, and the end thereof shall be with consuming fire.
</p>
<p>Let Saxony be called a desolation, because she persecuted the
</p>
<p>Lord's servants, and banished the Saints from their midst. Let
</p>
<p>the kingdoms of Hanover, and Bavaria, and the minor states of
</p>
<p>Germany be seized with trembling; let their hearts be faint; let
</p>
<p>sorrow and mourning enter their habitations, and let the angel of
</p>
<p>death persecute them, because they have, for these many years,
</p>
<p>thrust the servants and prophets of God into their loathsome
</p>
<p>prisons, and turned a deaf ear to their humble warnings! There-
</p>
<p>fore, let their thrones be cast down, and their governments be brok-

<p>en to pieces. Lord, let not the cries of thine anointed ones come
</p>
<p>up before thee in vain. Send forth judgment unto victory. Let
</p>
<p>the nations who fight against thee, know that thou art God. Arise,
</p>
<p>Lord, and thresh the nations, as with a new, sharp threshing
</p>
<p>instrument, scatter them as chaff before the furious whirlwind;
</p>
<p>break them to pieces, as potter's vessels, dashed upon the rocks;
</p>
<p>and if they continue to harden their hearts against thy Gospel,
</p>
<p>blot them out from under heaven, and let them go quickly down
</p>
<p>into the pit among the uncircumcised of heart. But let thy king-
</p>
<p>dom, God, stand forever, and let thy dominion have no end.

<p>Millennial Star, 28:409-11. (1866.)

<p>By Heber C. Kimball:
</p>
<p>Will this land be a land of milk and honey? Yes. Missouri is
</p>
<p>cracked up to be the greatest honey country that there is on the
</p>
<p>earth; but it will not be many years before they cannot raise a
</p>
<p>spoonful in that land, nor in Illinois, nor in any other land where
</p>
<p>they fight against God. Mildew shall come upon their honey, their
</p>
<p>bees, and their crops; and famine and desolation shall come upon
</p>
<p>the nation like a whirlwind. j.d., 5:93.

<p>*****
</p>
<p>An army of Elders will be sent to the four quarters of the
</p>
<p>earth to search out the righteous and warn the wicked of what is
</p>
<p>coming. All kinds of religions will be started and miracles per-
</p>
<p>formed that will deceive the very elect if that were possible. Our
</p>
<p>sons and daughters must live pure lives so as to be prepared for
</p>
<p>what is coming.
</p>
<p>After a while the gentiles will gather by the thousands to this
</p>
<p>place, and Salt Lake City will be classed among the wicked cities
</p>
<p>of the world. A spirit of speculation and extravagance will take
</p>
<p>possession of the Saints, and the results will be financial bondage.
</p>
<p>Persecution comes next and all true Latter-day Saints will be
</p>
<p>tested to the limit. Many will apostatize and others will be still

<p>not knowing what to do. Darkness will cover the earth and gross
</p>
<p>darkness the minds of the people. The judgments of God will be
</p>
<p>poured out on the wicked to the extent that our Elders from far
</p>
<p>and near will be called home, or in other words the gospel will be
</p>
<p>taken from the Gentiles and later on carried to the Jews.
</p>
<p>The western boundary of the State of Missouri will be swept
</p>
<p>so clean of its inhabitants that as President Young tells us, when
</p>
<p>you return to that place, there will not be left so much as a yellow
</p>
<p>dog to wag his tail. Before that day comes, however, the Saints
</p>
<p>will be put to tests that will try the integrity of the best of them.
</p>
<p>The pressure will become so great that the more righteous among
</p>
<p>them will cry unto the Lord day and night until deliverance comes.
</p>
<p>Then the prophet and others will make their appearance and those
</p>
<p>who have remained faithful will be selected to return to Jackson
</p>
<p>County, Missouri, and take part in the upbuilding of that beautiful
</p>
<p>city, the New Jerusalem.

<p>356 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>By Brigham Young:
</p>
<p>I heard Joseph Smith say, nearly thirty years ago. 'They
</p>
<p>shall have mobbing to their hearts content, if they do not redress
</p>
<p>the wrongs of the Latter-day Saints. Mobs will not decrease, but
</p>
<p>will increase until the whole government becomes a mob, and
</p>
<p>eventually it will be State against State, city against city, neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood against neighborhood." Methodists against Methodists, and
</p>
<p>so on. Probably you remember reading not a week ago, an account
</p>
<p>of a conference being held in Baltimore, in the course of which
</p>
<p>they seceded from their fellow-churches in the free States. It will
</p>
<p>be the same with other denominations of professing Christians, and
</p>
<p>it will be Christian against Christian, and man against man, and
</p>
<p>those who will not take up the sword against their neighbors, must
</p>
<p>flee to Zion.
</p>
<p>We are blessed in these mountains; this is the best place on
</p>
<p>the earth for the Latter-day Saints. Search the history of all the
</p>
<p>nations and every geographical position on the face of the earth,
</p>
<p>and you cannot find another situation so well adapted for the Saints
</p>
<p>as are these mountains. Here is the place in which the Lord de-
</p>
<p>signed to hide His people. Be thankful for it; be true to your
</p>
<p>covenants, and be faithful, each and every one.
</p>
<p>I am thankful that we live to see this day, and have the
</p>
<p>privilege of assembling ourselves in these valleys. We are not
</p>
<p>now mingling in the turmoils of strife, warring and contention 
</p>
<p>that we would have been obliged to have mingled in, had not the
</p>
<p>Lord suffered us to have been driven to these mountains  one of
</p>
<p>the greatest blessings that could have been visited upon us. It has
</p>
<p>been designed, for many generations, to hide up the Saints in the
</p>
<p>last days, until the indignation of the Almighty be over. His wrath
</p>
<p>will be poured out upon the nations of the earth. We see the nations
</p>
<p>steadily driving along to the precipice. The Lord has spoken from
</p>
<p>the heavens, and He is about to fulfill the prophecies of His ancient

<p>and modern Prophets. He ivill bring the nations into judgment, and
</p>
<p>deal zuith them and make a full end of them. Do you wish to see it
</p>
<p>done today? Are you prepared for the crisis that will eventually
</p>
<p>come? No. The Deseret Neivs, Vol. 11, No. 9, May 1, 1861.
</p>
<p>By John Taylor:
</p>
<p>Were we surprised when the last terrible war took place here
</p>
<p>in the United States? No. Good Latter-day Saints were not, for
</p>
<p>they had been told about it. Joseph Smith had told them where it
</p>
<p>would start, that it should be a terrible time of bloodshed and that
</p>
<p>it should start in South Carolina. But I tell you today the end
</p>
<p>is not yet. You will see worse things than that, for God will lay
</p>
<p>his hand upon this nation, and they will feel it more terribly than
</p>
<p>even they have done before. There will be more bloodshed, more
</p>
<p>ruin, more devastation than ever they have seen before. Write it
</p>
<p>down ! You will see it come to pass ; it is only just starting in. And
</p>
<p>would you feel to rejoice? No; I would feel sorry. I knew very
</p>
<p>well myself when this last war w T as commencing and could have
</p>
<p>ADDENDA 357
</p>
<p>wept and did weep, over this nation; but there is yet to come a
</p>
<p>sound of war, trouble and distress, in which brother will be arrayed
</p>
<p>against brother, father against son, son against father, a scene of
</p>
<p>desolation and destruction that will permeate our land until it will
</p>
<p>be a vexation to hear the report thereof. Would you help to bring
</p>
<p>it about? No, I would not; I would stop it if I could. I would pour
</p>
<p>in the oil and the wine and balm and try to lead people in the right
</p>
<p>path that will be governed by it, but they won't. Our Elders would
</p>
<p>do the same, and we are sending them forth doing all that we can,
</p>
<p>selecting the very best men we can put our hands upon  men of
</p>
<p>faith, men of honor, men of integrity  to go forth to preach the
</p>
<p>Gospel to this nation and to other nations. /. d., Vol. 20:318.
</p>
<p>By the Prophet Joseph:
</p>
<p>Yet remember, if the Latter-day Saints are not restored to all
</p>
<p>their rights and paid for all their losses, according to the known
</p>
<p>rules of justice and judgment, reciprocation and common honesty
</p>
<p>among men, that God will come out of his hiding place, and vex
</p>
<p>this nation with a sore vexation; yea, the consuming wrath of an
</p>
<p>offended God shall smoke through the nation with as much distress
</p>
<p>and woe as independence has blazed through with pleasure and de-
</p>
<p>light ***
</p>
<p>From Letter of Joseph the Prophet to Senator John C. Calhoun. D.H.C., 6:158.
</p>
<p>By Jedediah M. Grant :
</p>
<p>One of the marked signs of the last days is the blindness of
</p>
<p>the people ; we are told they would have eyes and see not, and ears
</p>
<p>but hear not, and hearts but understand not. If in the days of
</p>
<p>Jesus this was true of the Jews and surrounding nations, it is
</p>
<p>doubly so now in relation to the nations with which we are ac-
</p>
<p>quainted.
</p>
<p>Though the fulfillment of the words of the prophets is clear
</p>
<p>and visible to us as the noonday sun in its splendor, yet the people
</p>
<p>of the world are blinded thereto ; they do not comprehend nor dis-

</p>
<p>cern the hand of the Lord. The Saints who live in the Spirit, walk
</p>
<p>by the Spirit, and are governed by the counsels of the Almighty,
</p>
<p>can see the working of the Lord, not only in our midst * * * but we
</p>
<p>let our minds stretch abroad to creation's utmost extent, and we
</p>
<p>see the hand of the Lord in all the events of the earth.
</p>
<p>We see it in the revolutions of our own continent; we see it
</p>
<p>in the scattering and scourging of the house of Israel ; in the fading
</p>
<p>away of nations, on the right and on the left. * * * We see it in the
</p>
<p>preparations of war, and the framing of treaties of peace among
</p>
<p>strong nations. The world is in commotion and the hearts of men
</p>
<p>fail them for fear of the impending storm that threatens to en-
</p>
<p>shroud all nations in its black mantle. Treaties of peace may be
</p>
<p>made, and war will stop for a season, but there are certain decrees
</p>
<p>of God, and certain bounds fixed, and laws and edicts passed the
</p>
<p>high courts of heaven beyond which the nations cannot pass ; and
</p>
<p>when the Almighty decrees the wicked shall slay the wicked, strong
</p>
<p>nations may interfere, peace conventions may become rife in the
</p>
<p>358 FATE OF JOSEPH SMITH'S PERSECUTORS
</p>
<p>world and exert their influence to sheath the sword of war, and
</p>
<p>make treaties of peace to calm the troubled surface of all Europe,
</p>
<p>to no effect ; the war cloud is still booming o'er the heavens, darken-
</p>
<p>ing the earth, and threatening the world with desolation.
</p>
<p>This is a fact the saints have known for many years  that
</p>
<p>the Gods in yonder heavens have something to do with these revolu-
</p>
<p>tions ; the angels, those holy beings who are sent from the heavens
</p>
<p>to the earth to minister in the destiny of nations, have something
</p>
<p>to do in these mighty revolutions and convulsions that shake cre-
</p>
<p>ation almost to its center.
</p>
<p>Consequently, when we see nation stirred up against nation,
</p>
<p>and on the other hand see other nations exerting a powerful in-
</p>
<p>fluence to bring about negotiations of peace, shall we say they can
</p>
<p>bring it about? Do we expect they can stay the onward course of
</p>
<p>War? The prophet of God has spoken it all, and we expect to see
</p>
<p>the work go on  and see all things fulfilled as the prophets have
</p>
<p>declared by the spirit of prophecy in them.
</p>
<p>Three days before the Prophet Joseph started for Carthage, I
</p>
<p>well remember his telling us we should see the fulfillment of the
</p>
<p>words of Jesus upon the earth, where He says the father shall be
</p>
<p>against the son, and the son against the father ; the mother against
</p>
<p>the daughter, and the daughter against the mother ; the mother-in-
</p>
<p>law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against
</p>
<p>the mother-in-law ; and when a man's enemies shall be those of his
</p>
<p>own household.
</p>
<p>The Prophet stood in his own house when he told several of us
</p>
<p>of the night the visions of heaven were opened to him, in which
</p>
<p>he saw the American continent drenched in blood, and he saw na-
</p>
<p>tion rising against nation. He also saw the father shed the blood
</p>
<p>of the son, and the son shed the blood of the father; the mother
</p>
<p>put to death the daughter, and the daughter the mother; and
</p>
<p>natural affection forsook the hearts of the wicked ; for he saw that
</p>
<p>the Spirit of God should be withdrawn from the inhabitants of the

<p>earth, in consequence of which there should be blood upon the face
</p>
<p>of the whole earth, except among the people of the Most High. The
</p>
<p>Prophet gazed upon the scene his vision represented, until his heart
</p>
<p>sickened and he besought the Lord to close it up again.

<p>MEMORIES OF CARTHAGE JAIL
</p>
<p>By Franklin D. Richards
</p>
<p>"On the noon of Tuesday, the 19th, we left for Jacksonville,
</p>
<p>215 miles from Chicago, and the next morning we reached Carthage,
</p>
<p>in Hancock County. It was to this point that our thoughts had
</p>
<p>long tended. And the moment that we reached the town we sought
</p>
<p>out the historical jail. It is now occupied as a dwelling house by
</p>
<p>James M. Browning, a respectable and courteous man, who has in
</p>
<p>his time held the office of county treasurer. Today it seems a place
</p>
<p>of peace. To the casual observer it would possess not even a pass-
</p>
<p>ing interest. But to us who held the knowledge of the mighty events
</p>
<p>which had transpired within its walls, of the dark cloud of sin which
</p>
<p>had rested upon it, and of the mighty martyrdom which had cried
</p>
<p>aloud to heaven and the ages from its bullet-torn frame  there was
</p>
<p>something so impressive in its every stone that our hearts were
</p>
<p>filled with solemnity, and our eyes with tears. We went into the
</p>
<p>room which had been the prison-place of God's servants previous to
</p>
<p>the murderous attack. We stood upon the self-same floor which
</p>
<p>was trodden by the feet of Joseph and Hyrum and John Taylor and
</p>
<p>Willard Richards on that cruel day of slaughter. We saw the hole
</p>
<p>in the door made by the bullet which gave Hyrum his mortal wound.
</p>
<p>We bowed over the spot where he fell exclaiming, "I am a dead
</p>
<p>man." With chastened feelings, we stood at the door-frame and
</p>
<p>recalled how President Taylor had interposed his body between the
</p>
<p>Prophet and his bloodthirsty assailants, and how he had struggled
</p>
<p>to beat back the guns of the murderers, while discharging a torrent
</p>
<p>of flames and lead. We leaned from that famous window from which
</p>
<p>the Prophet jumped or fell, and from which President Taylor was
</p>
<p>thrown wounded and stricken and tossed back by that providential
</p>
<p>bullet which struck his watch, shattered it, and cast him upon the
</p>
<p>floor. We thought of this wonderful interposition of almighty power
</p>
<p>which saved his life for the great purposes which God has since
</p>
<p>accomplished through him, and which are yet in store. We retraced

<p>our steps down that tragic stairway which had once been crowded
</p>
<p>with devils in human form, and sought the well where Joseph Smith,
</p>
<p>the Prophet of God, ended his earthly career. But it is now filled up.
</p>
<p>The spot, however, is easily discernible. It is now a dainty flower
</p>
<p>bed, bearing masses of pure and fragrant blossoms. It was sweet
</p>
<p>to see the spot so hallowed  this ground where Joseph lay stretched
</p>
<p>in death, "when the fiend approached with a knife to sever the
</p>
<p>head from his body, and was stopped by a flash of lightning from
</p>
<p>the heavens." With the remembrance of all these things upon us 
</p>
<p>recalling the blackness of that hour, the woes of our subsequent
</p>
<p>wrongs, and then looking at the wondrous condition of the Church
</p>
<p>today, we were lost in a wilderness of emotions. There was much
</p>
<p>sadness in this visit, and the memories which it called forth. But
</p>
<p>there was a compensating sensation of triumph in the thought of
</p>
<p>the utter powerlessness of mankind  even though calling murder
</p>
<p>and rapine to their aid, to war successfully against the cause which
</p>
<p>has within itself the seeds of divine progress."

<p>L.D.S. CHURCH HISTORIAN RECORDS LIGHT FROM HEAVEN
</p>
<p>by Andrew Jensen
</p>
<p>Joseph, seeing there was no safety in the room, turned calmly
</p>
<p>from the door, dropped his pistol on the floor and sprang into the
</p>
<p>same window from which Elder Taylor had attempted to leap,
</p>
<p>when two balls pierced him from the door, and one entered his right
</p>
<p>breast from without, and he fell outward, exclaiming, "0 Lord,
</p>
<p>my God!" He fell partly on his right shoulder and back, his head
</p>
<p>and neck reaching the ground a little before his feet, and he rolled
</p>
<p>instantly on his face.
</p>
<p>In the instant Joseph fell out of the window the cry was raised,
</p>
<p>"He's leaped the window!" and the painted murderers on the stairs
</p>
<p>and in the entry ran out,

<p>Among the murderers outside was a man, barefoot and bare-
</p>
<p>headed, without a coat, his shirt-sleeves rolled up above his elbows
</p>
<p>and his pants above his knees ; he lifted Joseph up and propped him
</p>
<p>against the south side of the well curb, which stood a few T feet from
</p>
<p>the jail. Colonel Levi Williams then ordered four men to shoot him.
</p>
<p>They stood about eight feet from the curb and fired simultaneously.
</p>
<p>A slight cringe of the body was noticed as the balls struck him, and
</p>
<p>he fell on his face.
</p>
<p>The ruffian who set him against the well-curb, then took a bowie-
</p>
<p>knife, with the evident intention of cutting off his head, for which,
</p>
<p>according to reports, a considerable sum of money had been offered
</p>
<p>by the mob. As he raised the knife, and was in the attitude of strik-
</p>
<p>ing, a light, so sudden and powerful, burst from the heavens upon
</p>
<p>the bloody scene (passing its vivid chain between Joseph and the
</p>
<p>murderers), that they were struck with terror. The arms of the
</p>
<p>ruffian that held the knife fell powerless; the muskets of the four
</p>
<p>who fired fell to the ground, and they all stood like marble statues,
</p>
<p>not having the power to move a single limb of their bodies.
</p>
<p>After shooting him, the murderers hurried off in a disorderly

<p>manner, as fast as they could. Colonel Williams shouted to some
</p>
<p>who had just commmenced their retreat, to come back and help to
</p>
<p>carry off the four men who were still paralyzed. They came and
</p>
<p>carried them away by main strength to the baggage wagons, and
</p>
<p>they all fled towards Warsaw.
