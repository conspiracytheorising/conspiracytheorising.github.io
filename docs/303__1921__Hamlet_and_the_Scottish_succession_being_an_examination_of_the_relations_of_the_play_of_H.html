<p>HAMLET AND THE
</p>
<p>SCOTTISH SUCCESSION
</p>
<p>(Being an Examination of the Relations of the Play
</p>
<p>OF Hamlet to the Scottish Succession and the
</p>
<p>Essex Conspiracy)
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>It is the purpose of the following essay to study the
</p>
<p>play of Hamlet from a somewhat fresh point of view by
</p>
<p>endeavouring to show its relation or possible relation to
</p>
<p>contemporary history.
</p>
<p>My attempt throughout has been to regard the play as
</p>
<p>it naturally would be regarded by an Elizabethan audience,
</p>
<p>for it seems to me that this particular angle of vision has
</p>
<p>hitherto been too little considered in our current criticism.
</p>
<p>We have not sufficiently reahsed, I think, that to consider
</p>
<p>the Elizabethan audience is our least indirect method of
</p>
<p>approach to Shakespeare himself. A dramatic poet
</p>
<p>cannot possibly ignore the mentality of his audience ;
</p>
<p>an epic poet may, if he pleases, write, as we know Milton
</p>
<p>actually did write, for posterity and for an audience " fit
</p>
<p>though few " ; but a dramatic poet who does genuinely
</p>
<p>produce his plays before a popular audience cannot
</p>
<p>possibly do anything of the kind. The mentality of his
</p>
<p>audience provides him with at least half of his material.
</p>
<p>It is through that mentality that his plays must be

<p>AI
</p>
<p>2 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>reviewed and considered ; it is to that mentality they must
</p>
<p>all appeal. If the dramatic poet wishes to discuss problems
</p>
<p>his task is immensely facilitated by selecting problems
</p>
<p>in which his audience are already interested ; if he wishes
</p>
<p>to awaken feelings of terror and pathos, as every true
</p>
<p>dramatist must, his task is immensely facilitated if he
</p>
<p>appeals to associations already existing in their minds.
</p>
<p>The mentality of his audience everywhere shapes and
</p>
<p>conditions his work as certainly as the work of a sculptor
</p>
<p>is shaped by the architecture and purpose of the building
</p>
<p>in which it stands. The sculpture of the Parthenon is
</p>
<p>not more certainly adapted to the purpose of the Par-
</p>
<p>thenon than are the plays of a true dramatist to the
</p>
<p>mentality of his audience.
</p>
<p>Now, in the case of Shakespeare, the mentality of the
</p>
<p>audience is doubly important, because there is no direct
</p>
<p>method of approach. Shakespeare himself has left no
</p>
<p>letters or prefaces which explain his work ; his contem-
</p>
<p>poraries have left no criticisms ; the notices we possess
</p>
<p>of his plays are extremely meagre and most of them
</p>
<p>limited, like those of Forman, to a mere reference to the
</p>
<p>subject of the play.
</p>
<p>Neither can we judge Shakespeare completely by the
</p>
<p>effect produced on our own minds; we, after all, are a
</p>
<p>remote posterity, and nothing is more certain than that
</p>
<p>he did not write for us. We ourselves may be quite
</p>
<p>adequate judges of the purely aesthetic effect of the plays ;
</p>
<p>but, in order to understand them fully, it is surely necessary
</p>
<p>to ask what their effect upon a contemporary audience
</p>
<p>would be Hkely to be and what such an audience would

</p>
<p>probably think they meant.
</p>
<p>Introduction 3
</p>
<p>The moment we attempt to place ourselves at the same
</p>
<p>angle of vision as an EHzabethan audience we see many
</p>
<p>things in a different light ; many problems solve them-
</p>
<p>selves quite simply ; but, on the other hand, many are
</p>
<p>suggested which do not occur to the modern reader, and
</p>
<p>which nevertheless surely demand solution if we are to
</p>
<p>comprehend Shakespeare fully and completely.
</p>
<p>I propose to give illustrations of both types of pro-
</p>
<p>blems, of those which solve themselves and of those which
</p>
<p>suggest themselves.
</p>
<p>Let us enquire, for instance, why Shakespeare selected
</p>
<p>the subject of Macbeth ? One reason is obvious. A
</p>
<p>Scottish king had recently succeeded to the throne and
</p>
<p>the choice of a Scottish theme was, in itself, a compU-
</p>
<p>ment to him. Then, again, Banquo was the ancestor of
</p>
<p>the Stuarts, and the subject of the play enables Shake-
</p>
<p>speare to depict Banquo in a favourable light.
</p>
<p>But is there any reason for the selection of Macbeth
</p>
<p>himself as a hero ?
</p>
<p>There is, I think, an exceedingly good one ; but it only
</p>
<p>becomes evident after a careful study of the ideas of the
</p>
<p>epoch.
</p>
<p>Macbeth was the person who fulfilled the Merlin pro-
</p>
<p>phecies and, by so doing, brought about the foundation
</p>
<p>of the British Empire. The Merlin prophecies, as inter-
</p>
<p>preted by the so-called Tudor bards, were to the effect
</p>
<p>that the ancient British line should once again succeed
</p>
<p>to the throne of England and that, when it did so succeed,
</p>
<p>the different British kingdoms should be united under
</p>
<p>one crown and the ancient Arthurian empire restored.

</p>
<p>Professor Gwynn Jones assures me that these Merlin
</p>
<p>4 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>prophecies had an important poHtical bearing in sixteenth-
</p>
<p>century Wales ; they certainly had in England, and they
</p>
<p>were celebrated by many poets, notably Spenser, Drayton,
</p>
<p>and Ben Jonson.
</p>
<p>Drayton's lines happen to be the most apposite for my
</p>
<p>purpose, so I quote them :
</p>
<p>" the ancient British race
</p>
<p>Shall come again to sit upon the sovereign place. . . .
</p>
<p>By Tudor, with fair winds from httle Britaine driven,
</p>
<p>To whom the goodly bay of Milford shall be given ;
</p>
<p>As thy wise prophets, Wales, foretold his wish'd arrive
</p>
<p>And how Lewellin's line in him should doubly thrive.
</p>
<p>For from his issue sent to Albany before.
</p>
<p>Where his neglected blood his virtue did restore
</p>
<p>He first unto himself in fair succession gained
</p>
<p>The Stewards nobler name ; and afterwards attained
</p>
<p>The royal Scottish wreath, upholding it in state.
</p>
<p>This stem, to Tudors joined . . .
</p>
<p>Suppressing every Plant, shall spread itself so wide
</p>
<p>As in his arms shall clip the Isle on every side.
</p>
<p>By whom three severed realms in one shall firmly stand
</p>
<p>As Britain-founding Brute first monarchised the Land." ^
</p>
<p>Selden's note on the above passage is : " About our
</p>
<p>Confessor's time, Macbeth, King of Scotland (moved
</p>
<p>by prediction, affirming that his line extinct, the posterity
</p>
<p>of Banquho, a noble thane of Loqhuabre, should attain
</p>
<p>and continue the Scottish reign) and, jealous of others,
</p>
<p>hoped  for greatness, murdered Banquho, but missed
</p>
<p>his design ; for one of the same posterity, Fleanch son
</p>
<p>to Banquho, privily fled to Gryfhth ap Llewelin (Drayton
</p>
<p>Polyolbion, Song V.), then Prince of Wales, and was there
</p>
<p>kindly received. To him and Nesta, the Prince's daughter,

</p>
<p>was issue one Walter. . . . The rest alludes to that :
</p>
<p>Cambria shall be glad, Cornwall shall flourish, and the
</p>
<p>Isle shall be styled with Brute's name and the name of
</p>
<p>strangers shall perish : as it is in Merhn's prophecies."
</p>
<p>We are now in a position to see what Macbeth really
</p>
<p>meant to the Elizabethans : he was the man who ful-
</p>
<p>filled the Merhn prophecies, and he fulfilled them by the
</p>
<p>very fact that he tried to evade them ; when Fleance,
</p>
<p>the son of the murdered Banquho, fled to Wales he inter-
</p>
<p>married with the ancient British line and thus brought
</p>
<p>its blood to the throne of Scotland.
</p>
<p>Now the Elizabethans always laid immense stress on
</p>
<p>this genealogy for their monarchs ; anyone who will
</p>
<p>refer to Camden's genealogy of the Tudors will see that
</p>
<p>he derives their line from Brutus the Trojan, and the
</p>
<p>Stuarts, as we have just seen from Drayton and Selden,
</p>
<p>were similarly derived through Fleance the son of
</p>
<p>Banquho.
</p>
<p>Now an Elizabethan audience would surely see in
</p>
<p>Macbeth the same theme as in the lines quoted from
</p>
<p>Drayton. We have the enormous stress laid on prophecy
</p>
<p>throughout the play, we have the question of the succession
</p>
<p>prominent in Macbeth's mind, we have the murder of
</p>
<p>Banquho and the flight of Fleance, we have the future
</p>
<p>shown to Macbeth with the progeny of this Fleance
</p>
<p>succeeding, and we have the vision of the unity of the
</p>
<p>British Isles in the procession of the kings who " two-
</p>
<p>fold balls and treble-sceptres carry " and whose lines
</p>
<p>" stretch out to the crack of doom."
</p>
<p>Macbeth has, then, the same theme as the passage

</p>
<p>already quoted from Drayton ; what they both deal
</p>
<p>6 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>with is the founding or, as they would have put it, the
</p>
<p>restoration of the British Empire.
</p>
<p>The main conception is exactly similar to those which
</p>
<p>occur in Greek tragedy, where the very attempt to evade
</p>
<p>prophecy brings about its fulfilment, and the theme is as
</p>
<p>intimately interwoven with British history in the widest
</p>
<p>and truest sense of the term as any theme selected by
</p>
<p>a Greek dramatist was interwoven with Greek history.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine any subject more appropriate
</p>
<p>to render before James I. ; he was the destined restorer
</p>
<p>of the ancient Arthurian empire, the man destined to
</p>
<p>unite England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland all under
</p>
<p>the same crown, as long ago prophesied by Merlin,
</p>
<p>and the play shows how the effort to avert the succes-
</p>
<p>sion from the line of Banquho led precisely to its
</p>
<p>fulfilment.^
</p>
<p>Or let me choose another illustration. Suppose we ask
</p>
<p>whether Shakespeare's Denmark, as depicted in Hamlet,
</p>
<p>is a real country or not and, if real, what country ! Every-
</p>
<p>one will admit that Denmark makes a singularly real and
</p>
<p>vivid impression upon the mind ; it is as real, in the
</p>
<p>dramatic sense, as any country we have ever known or
</p>
<p>heard of. But did Shakespeare invent it as a background
</p>
<p>for his melancholy prince, or was he describing any
</p>
<p>country he knew ? It certainly is not the Denmark of
</p>
<p>his source ; the Denmark of Saxo Grammaticus is an
</p>
<p>almost entirely barbaric country, savage and primitive
</p>
<p>to a degree ; even the Hamlet, the hero of the primitive
</p>
<p>story, cuts an enemy's body to pieces and boils it and
</p>
<p>outrages a woman, and yet he is the best person in

</p>
<p>the whole piece. Is Shakespeare's Denmark, then, an
</p>
<p>imaginary region created by himself ?
</p>
<p>Let us ask what an Ehzabethan audience would have
</p>
<p>made of it. I do not think there need be five minutes'
</p>
<p>delay about the answer to this question. An Elizabethan
</p>
<p>audience would almost certainly have thought Denmark
</p>
<p>a real country, and they would have believed it to be
</p>
<p>contemporary Scotland.
</p>
<p>The peculiar combination of circumstances and the
</p>
<p>peculiar type of manners depicted in Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>Denmark are, in the highest degree, distinctive and
</p>
<p>strange ; but they can every one be paralleled in the case
</p>
<p>of sixteenth-century Scotland.
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's Denmark, to begin with, is a country
</p>
<p>where feudal anarchy reigns ; there is no settled law and
</p>
<p>order : the crown is seized by a usurper and almost every
</p>
<p>principal personage  the elder Hamlet, the younger
</p>
<p>Hamlet, Polonius, Claudius, the Queen  ends either by
</p>
<p>a violent death or by assassination.
</p>
<p>So also was Scotland a feudal anarchy. So also were
</p>
<p>the powers of the crown in Scotland in continual danger
</p>
<p>of being seized by usurpers and insurgents as in the case
</p>
<p>of the elder Bothwell and the younger Bothwell : in
</p>
<p>Scotland also almost every monarch or prominent states-
</p>
<p>man did meet either with a tragic and premature death,
</p>
<p>or with a death by assassination. James V., Mary Queen
</p>
<p>of Scots, Darnley, Rizzio, Murray  these were only the
</p>
<p>most prominent among a number of tragedies : assassina-
</p>
<p>tion was, indeed, the recognised method by which a great
</p>
<p>noble removed a rival.

<p>Shakespeare has been blamed for the " holocaust of
</p>
<p>8 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>dead " in Hamlet ; but it is not one whit more remark
</p>
<p>able than the mass of assassinations in sixteenth-century
</p>
<p>Scottish history. The Enghsh of Shakespeare's day had
</p>
<p>a bitter prejudice against Scotland, and very largely on
</p>
<p>account of this anarchy.
</p>
<p>Yet Shakespeare's Denmark is no mere barbaric country ;
</p>
<p>it is distinguished by its love of education, its philo-
</p>
<p>sophical depth, and its power of thought and meditation.
</p>
<p>Of all Shakespeare's tragedies Hamlet is admittedly the
</p>
<p>most philosophic and the most profound ; this has no
</p>
<p>parallel whatever in the original saga, but it has a parallel
</p>
<p>in contemporary Scotland.
</p>
<p>Knox and his body of reformers had already commenced
</p>
<p>that educational revival which was to make Scotland one
</p>
<p>of the most admirably educated countries in Europe ;
</p>
<p>their intellectual interests were largely of a philosophical
</p>
<p>character.
</p>
<p>Now, it is the combination of these circumstances which is
</p>
<p>so peculiar, which is indeed unique, and it is precisely this
</p>
<p>pecuhar combination which appears in Shakespeare's Hamlet
</p>
<p>Moreover, it should be noted that Shakespeare's Denmark
</p>
<p>is quite manifestly a country where the Catholic faith and
</p>
<p>the Protestant exist side by side ; the ghost is certainly
</p>
<p>a Catholic, for he laments nothing more than the fact that
</p>
<p>he was not allowed absolution at his death, that he was
</p>
<p>" Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
</p>
<p>Unhousel'd, disappointed, unaneled,
</p>
<p>No reckoning made but sent to my account
</p>
<p>With all my imperfections on my head."
</p>
<p>On the other hand, Hamlet is just as plainly a Protestant :
</p>
<p>he has been a fellow-student with Horatio at Wittenberg,

</p>
<p>and it is to Wittenberg he wishes to return. Now Witten-
</p>
<p>berg, on account of its connection with Luther, was one
</p>
<p>of the most famous of Protestant Universities.
</p>
<p>This pecuHar combination is, once again, exactly
</p>
<p>paralleled in contemporary Scotland ; the queen's party
</p>
<p>were CathoHcs ; her opponents were the Protestant
</p>
<p>lords, and there was a specially close connection between
</p>
<p>Scotland and German Protestant Universities. Knox
</p>
<p>himself once had a congregation at Frankfort-on-the-
</p>
<p>Main,i and there were manjr other Scotch Protestants in
</p>
<p>different parts of Germany. " There was a whole Scoto-
</p>
<p>German school, among whom the Wedderburns were
</p>
<p>predominant."
</p>
<p>Again, Shakespeare's Denmark is a place where the
</p>
<p>king has been murdered and his wife has married the
</p>
<p>murderer. This also happened in sixteenth- century
</p>
<p>Scotland ; Darnley is almost invariably alluded to in
</p>
<p>contemporary documents (Buchanan's Oration and De-
</p>
<p>tection, for instance), as the '* king " ; the " king " had been
</p>
<p>murdered, and his wife had married the murderer.
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's Denmark also is a place where a councillor
</p>
<p>is murdered in the presence of a queen, and his body
</p>
<p>disposed of '' hugger-mugger " fashion by a staircase.
</p>
<p>This, also, had happened in contemporary Scotland in
</p>
<p>the case of Rizzio's murder.
</p>
<p>I shall show later that in both these cases the resemblances
</p>
<p>between the history and Shakespeare are much more close
</p>
<p>than any possible resemblances with the saga source.
</p>
<p>Moreover, Shakespeare's Denmark is a place where
</p>
<p>there is, apparently, no army at the king's disposal, and

<p>10 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>where, when discontented nobles desire the redress of
</p>
<p>grievances, they enter the palace at the head of an armed
</p>
<p>band, and threaten the king's person, as happens with
</p>
<p>Laertes and Claudius. This was positively the recognised
</p>
<p>method of conducting an opposition in sixteenth-century
</p>
<p>Scotland. When a powerful subject had a grievance, he
</p>
<p>did at once put himself at the head of an armed band,
</p>
<p>and either threaten the person of the king or attempt
</p>
<p>to seize upon the person of the king.
</p>
<p>Then, again, there is the love of strong drink v/hich is
</p>
<p>so marked a feature in Shakespeare's Denmark, and the
</p>
<p>drunken carousals. This also was characteristic of a
</p>
<p>certain conspicuous group in sixteenth-century Scotland ;
</p>
<p>Buchanan continually calls the elder Bothwell a drunken
</p>
<p>beast.i
</p>
<p>Moreover, the resemblance extends even to the smallest
</p>
<p>details. Shakespeare's Denmark shows both Italian
</p>
<p>and Danish names at court ; so did contemporary
</p>
<p>Scotland, there was a Guildenstern (like Shakespeare's),
</p>
<p>and a Francesco (like Shakespeare's), the latter being a
</p>
<p>friend of Rizzio's.
</p>
<p>Now it seems to me that, with all these resemblances
</p>
<p>quite obvious and on the surface, an EHzabethan audience
</p>
<p>would almost certainly assume either that Shakespeare
</p>
<p>was deliberately depicting contemporary Scotland, or, at
</p>
<p>the very least, that he was deliberately borrowing many
</p>
<p>of its distinctive traits. The resemblances range from the
</p>
<p>most inclusive circumstances to the smallest details 
</p>
<p>they embrace the peculiar combinations of feudal anarchy
</p>
<p>and philosophy, of strong drink and of students at German

<p>universities, and they even include a Danish Guildenstern
</p>
<p>and an Italian Francesco.
</p>
<p>And, further, is there anything strange in such a resem-
</p>
<p>blance ? Why should not Shakespeare wish to depict
</p>
<p>sixteenth-century Scotland ? It was a country in which
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's audience were intensely interested : it
</p>
<p>was the country which was just about to provide them
</p>
<p>with a king ; it was a country whose crown was to be
</p>
<p>intimately associated with theirs ; a study of its leading
</p>
<p>traits would be likely to interest Shakespeare's audience
</p>
<p>more than any other subject which, at that particular
</p>
<p>date, it would be possible for him to choose.
</p>
<p>Another example may be chosen from The Merchant
</p>
<p>oj Venice. It is very generally admitted that Shake-
</p>
<p>speare's portrait of a Jew villain is probably in part due
</p>
<p>to the great excitement caused by the trial of a Jew,
</p>
<p>Roderigo Lopez, for the attempted murder of the queen
</p>
<p>and Don Antonio : Lopez was executed in 1594.
</p>
<p>Shakespeare, in drawing the portrait of the Jew villain,
</p>
<p>was availing himself of what was just then a strong
</p>
<p>popular excitement against the Jews. So much is ad-
</p>
<p>mitted ! 1
</p>
<p>But surely the play suggests a good deal more. Antonio
</p>
<p>was a claimant to the throne of Portugal and, as
</p>
<p>the rival claimant was Philip II., Antonio became, on
</p>
<p>this account, a very popular person with the majority
</p>
<p>of the Elizabethans, who hated Philip and instinctively
</p>
<p>took the side of anyone opposed to him. Antonio had
</p>
<p>come to London, bringing with him exceedingly valuable
</p>
<p>jewels ; his purpose was to pledge these with the merchants

<p>of London, and so to procure the money for ships to
</p>
<p>fight PhiHp of Spain. The Essex and Southampton
</p>
<p>party  Shakespeare's patrons  were keenly in favour
</p>
<p>of a forward pohcy against Spain and consequently in
</p>
<p>favour of Antonio. On the other hand, Ehzabeth
</p>
<p>and Burleigh desired peace ; Antonio was allowed to
</p>
<p>pledge his jewels but, on one pretext or another, he was
</p>
<p>prevented from getting his ships. He was thus in the
</p>
<p>position of a ruined bankrupt, and popular feeling ran
</p>
<p>high in his favour.
</p>
<p>Essex started, on his own account, a system of espionage
</p>
<p>which was deUberately intended to rival that of Burleigh.
</p>
<p>His spies discovered evidence that there was a Spanish
</p>
<p>plot to poison the queen and Don Antonio by using the
</p>
<p>physician  Lopez, as an intermediary. Elizabeth, at
</p>
<p>first, refused wholly to credit the existence of such a plot
</p>
<p>and blamed Essex as a " rash and temerarious youth,"
</p>
<p>for bringing accusations against the innocent. Essex,
</p>
<p>however, persisted ; fresh evidence was procured, a public
</p>
<p>trial was ordered, and Lopez was condemned to death.
</p>
<p>Still the queen delayed, and it was three months before
</p>
<p>she could be induced to sign the death-warrant. Even
</p>
<p>then she exercised her prerogative so far as to allow the
</p>
<p>family of Lopez to retain a considerable portion of his wealth.
</p>
<p>Lopez had professed himself a Christian.
</p>
<p>As Naunton points out Elizabeth was regarded as a
</p>
<p>most merciful princess. We may remember that one
</p>
<p>of Spenser's names for her was "Mercilla."i Now this
</p>
<p>tendency to mercy seemed to the public to have been
</p>
<p>exercised too far in the Lopez affair.

</p>
<p>We might also observe that Don Antonio himself was
</p>
<p>partly Jewish; he was the son of a Jewess who had
</p>
<p>become converted to Christianity.
</p>
<p>Now, surely, we have here very remarkable parallels
</p>
<p>to Shakespeare's play ?
</p>
<p>We have Don Antonio who has been a very wealthy man
</p>
<p>but who has practically become a bankrupt through losses
</p>
<p>incurred over his own ships ; a Jew forms a plot against
</p>
<p>his Hfe and nearly succeeds, but it is discovered, and the
</p>
<p>Jew punished.
</p>
<p>So Shakespeare's hero is an Antonio ; he also has
</p>
<p>been wealthy, but is reduced, apparently, to bankruptcy
</p>
<p>by losses over his ships. So does a Jew attempt his hfe ;
</p>
<p>so is the plot frustrated.
</p>
<p>We have Elizabeth, who will not beheve in the guilt of
</p>
<p>the Jew, who makes every attempt to show him mercy,
</p>
<p>who delays almost intolerably over his trial, but who is
</p>
<p>compelled to give sentence in the end ; we have the fact
</p>
<p>that she was famous for mercy, and that one of her poetic
</p>
<p>names was " Mercilla."
</p>
<p>So Shakespeare gives us Portia, who will not believe in the
</p>
<p>guilt of the Jew, who gives him every possible opportunity,
</p>
<p>who identifies herself with mercy in the noblest of all poetic
</p>
<p>praises ; but who is compelled, finally, to give sentence.
</p>
<p>We have in the play, just as in the history, the fact that
</p>
<p>the fine upon the Jew's goods is remitted, and that they
</p>
<p>are allowed to pass to his children. Moreover, in the
</p>
<p>Hfe of Don Antonio, in the fact that his mother was a
</p>
<p>Jewess who married a Christian, we have a parallel to
</p>
<p>another most interesting episode in Shakespeare's play ;

</p>
<p>that of Lorenzo and Jessica.
</p>
<p>14 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Is it not probable that Shakespeare selected his material
</p>
<p>and chose his plot largely that his play might appeal to
</p>
<p>interests then paramount in the minds of his audience ?
</p>
<p>Surely nothing can be more plausible ?
</p>
<p>We have even, in Bassanio, a parallel to the situation
</p>
<p>of Essex himself ; he is the friend of Antonio ; he is the
</p>
<p>soldier, the man of noble birth but without fortune, who
</p>
<p>quite frankly approaches Portia to " repair his fortunes."
</p>
<p>So was Essex the friend of Don Antonio ; so had Essex
</p>
<p>hoped to profit by his ships, so was Essex a soldier, young
</p>
<p>and of noble birth, but poor ; so did he approach Elizabeth
</p>
<p>in the frank hope of mending his fortunes.
</p>
<p>We also observe that, if Shakespeare be really drawing
</p>
<p>parallels with history, many of the adverse criticisms
</p>
<p>on his play find at least their explanation.
</p>
<p>Thus there is simply no point in sentimentalising over
</p>
<p>his cruelty in compelling Shylock to become a Christian ;
</p>
<p>the actual historic Jew had professed Christianity and
</p>
<p>did profess it to the end. Neither need we blame him for
</p>
<p>allowing Portia to drag out the trial scene so intolerably
</p>
<p>and '* get on the nerves " of the spectators ; it was just
</p>
<p>precisely this delay which had " got on the nerves " of the
</p>
<p>Elizabethan public. Neither need we wonder that Shake-
</p>
<p>speare allows Portia to give judgment in the Duke's own
</p>
<p>court : it was with Elizabeth that the matter finally rested.
</p>
<p>Is it not easy to see that Shakespeare has taken his
</p>
<p>literary source and has dovetailed into it a great deal of
</p>
<p>history as well ? ^
</p>
<p>Another incident I will select is from Henry IV., Part II
</p>
<p> the famous incident of the repudiation of Falstaff.

</p>
<p>Introduction 15
</p>
<p>In scene after scene throughout the plays we have seen
</p>
<p>Henry rejoicing himself with the inimitable wit of Falstaff,
</p>
<p>treating him as his boon companion, and as one of his
</p>
<p>most intimate friends ; then, on his accession, he re-
</p>
<p>pudiates him pubUcly and orders him to be haled off
</p>
<p>to prison, for we hear the Chief Justice giving the order :
</p>
<p>" Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet." Is not this
</p>
<p>needlessly harsh and stern ? How often has this parti-
</p>
<p>ticular point been debated ! Some of Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>critics do accuse Henry of unnecessary harshness ; a
</p>
<p>number of others find a way out by protesting that it
</p>
<p>was essential for Henry to effect a complete severance
</p>
<p>from Falstaff. Do they think Shakespeare's hero-king
</p>
<p>such a moral weakling that he could not guard himself
</p>
<p>against the temptations of " sack and sugar " except by
</p>
<p>putting the tempter in prison ?
</p>
<p>The truth is that the passage, as it stands, is a perpetual
</p>
<p>puzzle to the modern reader who finds Falstaff a very
</p>
<p>fascinating personage, sympathises with him, and is
</p>
<p>convinced that Henry, whatever grounds he may have
</p>
<p>had for repudiating Falstaff, cannot have had any for
</p>
<p>imprisoning him.
</p>
<p>The explanation, I take it, is again historic. The
</p>
<p>kings of the house of Lancaster had an exceedingly bad
</p>
<p>title in point of law ; they won the all-powerful support
</p>
<p>of the Church only by engaging in a perpetual heresy-
</p>
<p>hunt ; hence the many Lollard trials of the reign of
</p>
<p>Henry V. Now we know that in the original version of
</p>
<p>the play, Falstaff was called Oldcastle, and Sir John
</p>
<p>Oldcastle was the greatest of all Lollard leaders.

</p>
<p>The fact of his imprisonment was simply a historic
</p>
<p>i6 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>fact, and the audience knew well enough the reasons for
</p>
<p>it ; the historic Henry had strained himself to the utmost
</p>
<p>in the effort to save his old friend from the ire of enraged
</p>
<p>ecclesiastics, and, even when he was imprisoned, had
</p>
<p>tried to persuade him to recant. How could the
</p>
<p>audience think Henry severe when they knew that the true
</p>
<p>offence was a political one, and that a continuance of the
</p>
<p>friendship on Henry's part would have brought down
</p>
<p>the dynasty ? Surely this sheds a different light on
</p>
<p>Henry ?
</p>
<p>It also throws light on other portions of the play.
</p>
<p>Falstaff repeatedly claims a great reputation for military
</p>
<p>skill, a European reputation in fact, for he says that he
</p>
<p>is '* Sir John to all Europe." Now a good many critics
</p>
<p>treat this as simple absurdity on his part, but it is perfectly
</p>
<p>accurate ; Oldcastle was acknowledged as one of the greatest
</p>
<p>soldiers of his day. Whether Shakespeare meant him to
</p>
<p>deserve his reputation or not is an entirely different point,
</p>
<p>but he certainly possessed it. Canon Ainger has shown
</p>
<p>that a great deal in the character of Falstaff can be ex-
</p>
<p>plained by the fact that the Elizabethan conception of
</p>
<p>him was that of a renegade Puritan, and it is surely equally
</p>
<p>appropriate to remember that he had the reputation
</p>
<p>of being a great soldier. That is the joke of the battle
</p>
<p>of Shrewsbury.^ That is precisely why he is able to
</p>
<p>claim, with any hope of credence, that he killed Hotspur,
</p>
<p>and that is preceisely why Sir John Colevile of the Dale
</p>
<p>surrenders to his reputation only. 2
</p>
<p>In all these cases the historic method helps us, I think,
</p>
<p>very markedly to understand the plays in question ;

</p>
<p>Introduction i^
</p>
<p>on the other hand, we are bound to admit that, if we
</p>
<p>study the pecuhar point of view of the EUzabethan mind,
</p>
<p>problems are often suggested where all might otherwise
</p>
<p>to the modern reader appear plain. It seems to me,
</p>
<p>however, that it is at least equally necessary to study the
</p>
<p>problems which thus arise. How can we be sure that
</p>
<p>we understand him fully if we ignore the manner in which
</p>
<p>his plays and his subjects were likely to affect contem-
</p>
<p>porary minds ? I will give two instances where important
</p>
<p>problems suggest themselves which have not, I think,
</p>
<p>as yet been resolved.
</p>
<p>Let us consider, for instance, the identity of Lear.
</p>
<p>Lear appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth as the king who
</p>
<p>founded the city of Leicester, and it is ultimately, though
</p>
<p>not directly, from Geoffrey of Monmouth that Shake-
</p>
<p>speare's version of the story is derived. Shakespeare
</p>
<p>has, however, altered the conclusion and linked the whole
</p>
<p>with an entirely different tale  the history of Gloucester
</p>
<p>and his sons  whose source is Sidney's Arcadia. Now
</p>
<p>Lear is not only a character in Geoffrey of Monmouth ;
</p>
<p>he is also an important figure in Welsh mythology where
</p>
<p>his daughter  Cordelia  has as rival wooers Modred
</p>
<p>and Gwynn ap Nudd, the prince of fairyland ; these
</p>
<p>two are doomed to fight for her every first of May until
</p>
<p>the Day of Judgment.
</p>
<p>In Irish mythology also Lear or Lir plays an important
</p>
<p>part, and his children are turned into wild swans.
</p>
<p>Now what is Lear's real identity ?
</p>
<p>Sir John Rhys states that Lir is a Celtic sea-god ;
</p>
<p>Mr Timothy Lewis tells me that he thinks this a mistake,
</p>
<p>that Lir is a noun used as an adjective and means the

</p>
<p>1 8 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Ligurian Sea only, but not any other : Lear or Lir really
</p>
<p>means the Ligures tribes ; there were a number of such
</p>
<p>personages in ancient Welsh ; they are called the fathers
</p>
<p>of the British race, and they really mean the invading
</p>
<p>tribes from the Continent.
</p>
<p>Now it may not be of importance to our Shakespearian
</p>
<p>study to know what Lear really and essentially is ; but
</p>
<p>it is surely of considerable importance to know what the
</p>
<p>Elizabethans thought he was.
</p>
<p>Was Lear a man or a god or a tribe ? This question
</p>
<p>is not even asked. The majority of critics are like
</p>
<p>Mr Bradley, they start with the assumption that Lear
</p>
<p>was an ancient British king, and they do not even discuss
</p>
<p>the possibility that the Elizabethans understood Lear as
</p>
<p>a mythologic figure and that Shakespeare himself may
</p>
<p>have meant him as something mythologic.
</p>
<p>Mr Bradley's omission to ask the question is the more
</p>
<p>curious because he himself admits that Lear produces
</p>
<p>on his mind the impression of being strangely remote
</p>
<p>from ordinary life ; the tale, as such, is extravagantly
</p>
<p>improbable and yet the drama is enormously great.
</p>
<p>" This world," says Mr Bradley, " is called Britain ;
</p>
<p>but we should no more look for it than for the place
</p>
<p>called Caucasus, where Prometheus was chained by
</p>
<p>Strength and Force and comforted by the daughters of
</p>
<p>Ocean."
</p>
<p>And elsewhere he says that he finds that he is often
</p>
<p>grouping the play in his own mind " with works like the
</p>
<p>Prometheus Vtnctus, and the Divine Comedy and even
</p>
<p>with the greatest symphonies of Beethoven and the statues

<p>Introduction 19
</p>
<p>In other words, the play makes an impression closely
</p>
<p>resembling that of mythologic symbolism. Very well !
</p>
<p>is it not possible that Shakespeare's audience would have
</p>
<p>conceived Lear as a figure in mythology ?
</p>
<p>Or consider Othello as another case where the EHza-
</p>
<p>bethan point of view very naturally suggests a problem.
</p>
<p>From Coleridge to Mr Bradley most of our critics assume
</p>
<p>that Othello is meant to be a noble character.
</p>
<p>Mr Bradley says : " This character is so noble, Othello's
</p>
<p>actions and feehng follow so inevitably from it  and
</p>
<p>his sufferings are so heartrending that he stirs I believe,
</p>
<p>in most readers, a passion of mingled love and pity which
</p>
<p>they feel for no other hero in Shakespeare."
</p>
<p>Now, it is impossible to deny that this " noble " person
</p>
<p>commits great crimes ; he murders an innocent and
</p>
<p>devoted wife, and plans the murder of a loyal friend ; it
</p>
<p>is quite true that Cassio's assassination is averted, but
</p>
<p>that is sheer accident ; it is not owing to any repentance
</p>
<p>in Othello, and Othello remains morally guilty of two
</p>
<p>murders, both of innocent people.
</p>
<p>These are undeniably great crimes ; still the whole
</p>
<p>tendency of our modern criticism is to lay all the stress
</p>
<p>upon lago's villainy and to regard Othello as being almost
</p>
<p>wholly a victim. But now let us make one enquiry !
</p>
<p>Such a subject is, in itself, an excellent dramatic subject,
</p>
<p>and it is easy enough to understand Shakespeare's choice.
</p>
<p>But why if it be really his intention to show us an innocent
</p>
<p>noble husband driven to the murder of an innocent wife,
</p>
<p>why does he commence with making his hero a Moor ?
</p>
<p>The audience of the sixteenth century had an intense

</p>
<p>prejudice against Moors, a prejudice at least as strong as
</p>
<p>20 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>an audience of to-day would have against Prussian
</p>
<p>officers.
</p>
<p>The Moors were, in the sixteenth century, the most
</p>
<p>formidable opponents of Christian Europe ; their valour
</p>
<p>had threatened its complete overthrow, and since they
</p>
<p>were heathen and formidable opponents at one and the
</p>
<p>same time, they were regarded as the accepted types of
</p>
<p>villainy. We see this in the second book of Spenser's
</p>
<p>Faerie Queene, where the three Saracens are the most
</p>
<p>formidable opponents of the knight Guyon ; we see it in
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's own Titus Andronicus where the Moor is
</p>
<p>represented as absolutely black, and also a villain of the
</p>
<p>most dreadful type.
</p>
<p>Even modern critics like Coleridge and Charles Lamb
</p>
<p>feel a distinct repulsion. Coleridge argues that Othello
</p>
<p>cannot have been really black, but must have been brown ;
</p>
<p>I need not repeat his arguments, for every one knows
</p>
<p>them, and they are all contradicted by the simple fact
</p>
<p>that Shakespeare makes the Moor Aaron absolutely
</p>
<p>black.
</p>
<p>Then, again, Charles Lamb says that he prefers Othello
</p>
<p>for reading rather than for representation on the stage,
</p>
<p>because on the stage his black face alienates the sympathy
</p>
<p>of the audience. Of course it does. But the prejudice
</p>
<p>excited in Charles Lamb's mind must have been as nothing
</p>
<p>compared to the prejudices excited in the minds of an
</p>
<p>Elizabethan audience for whom a Moor's black face w^as
</p>
<p>simply the accepted symbol for the villainy of a Moor's
</p>
<p>black soul.

</p>
<p>anything really comparable ! Try and imagine him
</p>
<p>Introduction 21
</p>
<p>representing a hero who murders an innocent wife and
</p>
<p>attempts the murder of an innocent friend ; supposing
</p>
<p>that, notwithstanding these dreadful facts, he wishes to
</p>
<p>awaken the utmost sympathy for the murderous hero.
</p>
<p>Will be begin by making his hero a Prussian officer ? Of
</p>
<p>course not ! Our dramatist knows perfectly well that
</p>
<p>his audience have a prejudice against Prussian officers
</p>
<p>of the intensest possible kind, that they will certainly,
</p>
<p>from the very outset, consider the hero a villain and that
</p>
<p>they will certainly, from the very outset, expect him to
</p>
<p>do something unjust and abominable. Surely no
</p>
<p>dramatist would so far stultify his own dramatic intention ?
</p>
<p>And yet even the case of the Prussian officer is not
</p>
<p>strong enough, for it does not include the colour bar.
</p>
<p>Imagine a Prussian officer who is also a negro, and imagine
</p>
<p>the play acted before an audience of Southern State
</p>
<p>Americans ! And that the parallel is really true and really
</p>
<p>just anyone can see by simply referring to Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>source. In Cinthio's novel the conclusion drawn is
</p>
<p>exactly the one that might have been expected ; the
</p>
<p>noble Venetian lady marries the Moor, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the prohibition of her parents, and the result is what
</p>
<p>might have been anticipated  a cruel murder.
</p>
<p>Now, how do our critics get out of this difficulty ?
</p>
<p>They never meet it fairly. They simply assume, like
</p>
<p>Mr Bradley, that Shakespeare was gloriously original,
</p>
<p>gloriously in advance of his age. This, when we consider
</p>
<p>the character of the viUainous Moor Aaron seems very
</p>
<p>doubtful ; but, even supposing Shakespeare were free
</p>
<p>from the prejudices of his age, was his mtdience free ?

</p>
<p>That is the real crux of the whole matter. Mr Bradley
</p>
<p>22 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>admits that even Coleridge could not rise to the " full
</p>
<p>glory " of Shakespeare's conception. How, then, does
</p>
<p>Mr Bradley think the Elizabethan audience could rise
</p>
<p>to it ? Were they less free from race prejudice than
</p>
<p>Coleridge, the devotee of the rights of man ?
</p>
<p>Moreover, the whole difficulty was so needless ! As-
</p>
<p>suming that all Shakespeare wished to do was to write
</p>
<p>a story of love and murderous jealousy, he could have
</p>
<p>easily found scores and scores of such tales which were
</p>
<p>intrinsically better material than Cinthio's novel. The
</p>
<p>one thing that is peculiar about Cinthio's novel is the fact
</p>
<p>that the hero is a Moor ; in other words, Shakespeare
</p>
<p>chose precisely the story which included the one thing
</p>
<p>likely to wreck his dramatic effect at the outset. Is this
</p>
<p>probable ?
</p>
<p>Is it not possible that Othello is really meant to be a
</p>
<p>villain, and that his great qualities are like the great
</p>
<p>qualities of Macbeth  things which do not prevent the
</p>
<p>rest of the man from being evil ?
</p>
<p>At any rate the difficulty should be fairly answered,
</p>
<p>and I submit that we cannot do this without a most
</p>
<p>careful historic study.
</p>
<p>Moreover, as soon as we take the Ehzabethan point of
</p>
<p>view, another question at once suggests itself. Are we
</p>
<p>justified in interpreting Shakespeare, as completely as
</p>
<p>we do, from a modern psychological standpoint ?
</p>
<p>It is quite true that every era which is interested in
</p>
<p>human nature must have its own method of psychology ;
</p>
<p>but this psychology also has its historical development
</p>
<p>and the method of one age differs considerably from the

</p>
<p>method of another.
</p>
<p>Introduction 23
</p>
<p>Let anyone who doubts this take the simplest of tests.
</p>
<p>Let him turn to Pope, who explains his own psychology
</p>
<p>in the Moral Essays, The Essay on Man, and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>The virtue of human life depends on a right balance
</p>
<p>between passion and reason and, according to him, the
</p>
<p>key to character is to be found in the '* ruHng passion " 
</p>
<p>to discover a man's ruling passion is to know him. Now,
</p>
<p>Pope's own method of character-drawing depends on
</p>
<p>his own psychology, and is to be explained by that
</p>
<p>psychology ; but it is quite obsolete for us. Who now
</p>
<p>thinks of the " ruling passion " as the key to a man's
</p>
<p>character ?
</p>
<p>But if the method of the Queen Anne period is so far
</p>
<p>obsolete, should we not expect the method of the Eliza-
</p>
<p>bethans to be more obsolete still ?
</p>
<p>Let us take an Elizabethan example in Ben Jonson's
</p>
<p>Comedy of Humours.
</p>
<p>This is how Mr Gregory Smith explains Jonson's psy-
</p>
<p>chology : ^ "In the older physiology the four major
</p>
<p>humours, corresponding with the four elements  formed
</p>
<p>according to their proportionate allowances in each body 
</p>
<p>the " temperament " or '* complexion " or " constitu-
</p>
<p>tion " of a man, and declared his character. Variations
</p>
<p>in the relative strength of these humours disclosed the
</p>
<p>individual differences. These differences might be great
</p>
<p>or small in respect of one or more of the contributing
</p>
<p>humours. By simple arithmetic it was easy to show
</p>
<p>that great odds were against any two men having the
</p>
<p>same formula of temperament ; and so the theory fitted
</p>
<p>itself comfortably to experience."

</p>
<p>^ Ben Jonson.
</p>
<p>24 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Now, this was the psychology of one of Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>own contemporaries. If Ben Jonson's psychology was,
</p>
<p>to our own thinking, as extraordinary as this, what was
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's psychology ? Surely we ought to explain
</p>
<p>his method ? Pope's interpretation of character depends
</p>
<p>upon the theory of the ruling passion, which he regards
</p>
<p>as the key to it. Ben Jonson's interpretation of character
</p>
<p>depends upon " humours." Both these methods are
</p>
<p>obsolete for us. Are our critics likely to be right when
</p>
<p>they represent Shakespeare almost entirely as if he were
</p>
<p>a modern psychologist writing plays, instead of novels.
</p>
<p>This is really what Mr Bradley does. He interprets
</p>
<p>Shakespeare from the psychological standpoint, but
</p>
<p>without once explaining what Shakespeare's psychology
</p>
<p>really was ; he assumes that it was like our own, but to
</p>
<p>do so is surely to throw Shakespeare out of the line of
</p>
<p>his historic development.
</p>
<p>There must have been differences. What were they ?
</p>
<p>Not even a genius like Shakespeare can anticipate a
</p>
<p>method three centuries ahead of his own, and even if he
</p>
<p>had possessed such a truly outstanding gift of prophecy,
</p>
<p>we are only once more " up against " our main problem,
</p>
<p>the mentality of the audience ; his audience could not
</p>
<p>possibly have understood him.
</p>
<p>The older editors of Shakespeare  Malone, for instance
</p>
<p> do often see historical parallels. It was Coleridge
</p>
<p>who set the fashion of treating Shakespeare mainly from
</p>
<p>a psychological standpoint ; this was natural enough,
</p>
<p>for Coleridge was himself mainly a psychologist, and as
</p>
<p>he himself admits, possessed very little historic sense ;

</p>
<p>we may add that, in addition, there was very httle
</p>
<p>Introduction 25
</p>
<p>historical material available. It is, however, somewhat
</p>
<p>surprising that, as the historical material became
</p>
<p>available, it was not more generally employed. Thus
</p>
<p>Mr Bradley (whom I quote so often, because he has
</p>
<p>carried this method to its farthest point), considers
</p>
<p>Shakespeare as almost entirely detached from his time
</p>
<p>and age ; the four great tragedies might almost have
</p>
<p>been written in the Age of Pericles or the period of
</p>
<p>the Romantic Revival for all the intimate and vital
</p>
<p>relation that Mr Bradley perceives between them and
</p>
<p>their own age.
</p>
<p>But is this probable ?
</p>
<p>We thus arrive at two very starthng conclusions.
</p>
<p>One is that Shakespeare, though perhaps more interested
</p>
<p>in human nature than any man who has ever hved, wrote
</p>
<p>with almost complete indifference to his own era ; and
</p>
<p>this in spite of the fact that we know the Ehzabethan
</p>
<p>stage was continually and closely associated with poUtics,
</p>
<p>and that Shakespeare's own company twice earned the
</p>
<p>displeasure of authority on account of Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>own plays, iwo'^ of which were certainl}^ represented as
</p>
<p>having important political bearings.
</p>
<p>The other is the equally startling conclusion that
</p>
<p>Shakespeare can be best interpreted by nineteenth-
</p>
<p>century psychology, not a sixteenth-century psychology
</p>
<p>(for that would probably have to be as obsolete as Ben
</p>
<p>Jonson's) ; but just precisely a nineteenth-century
</p>
<p>psychology.
</p>
<p>Surely these results are very curious ?
</p>
<p>But, it will be asked, if Shakespeare's greatest characters

</p>
<p>^ Henry IV. and Richard II.
</p>
<p>26 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>are not predominantly psychological, in our sense of
</p>
<p>the term, what can they be ?
</p>
<p>Let me take an illustration.
</p>
<p>Suppose we consider again Shakespeare's Lear, and
</p>
<p>compare it with four allied characters, four characters
</p>
<p>who have much in common with him, choosing two from
</p>
<p>ancient, and two from modern literature. Suppose we
</p>
<p>compare Lear with (Edipus and Priam on the one side, and
</p>
<p>on the other, with Turgenieff's Lear of the Steppes, and
</p>
<p>Balzac's Pere Goriot. With which group has Lear most in
</p>
<p>common ? To me it seems obvious that he has most in
</p>
<p>common with (Edipus and Priam. And Mr Bradley,
</p>
<p>when he compares Lear to the Prometheus Vinctus, is
</p>
<p>feeling the same effect that I feel. But (Edipus and
</p>
<p>Priam are characters in Greek mythology, whereas
</p>
<p>Turgenieff's Lear and Pere Goriot are the characters of
</p>
<p>modern psychological realists.
</p>
<p>Be it observed that it is not simply a question of genius,
</p>
<p>for the same hand which drew Lear also drew Nym, Pistol,
</p>
<p>and Bardolph ; but these latter belong quite plainly to
</p>
<p>the Comedy of Humours, they are psychology in the
</p>
<p>sixteenth-century {i.e. Jonsonian) sense of the term ;
</p>
<p>but they do not produce at all the same effect as Lear.
</p>
<p>What, it may again be asked, is the essential difference
</p>
<p>between mythology and psychology ? Well, it seems to
</p>
<p>me that there are two differences which go to the root
</p>
<p>of the matter !
</p>
<p>One is that the modern psychologist aims especially
</p>
<p>at the realistic portraits of individuals. He aims at
</p>
<p>giving you the sort of man you might meet anywhere, and
</p>
<p>Generated on 2014-09-09 20:12 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/loc.ark:/13960/t8bg36912
</p>

</p>
<p>this is what, when successful, he does. We all feel that
</p>
<p>Introduction 27
</p>
<p>Turgenieff' s Lear and Balzac's Pere Goriot are individuals
</p>
<p>whom the authors might actually have met, and probably
</p>
<p>did meet. They are people of common life.
</p>
<p>But do we feel that (Edipus and Priam are people of
</p>
<p>common hfe ? On the contrary. The poets wish to
</p>
<p>convey the impression that there is something in their
</p>
<p>heroes which is more than ordinary ; they are not merely
</p>
<p>ordinary individuals, they are something above and
</p>
<p>over. When Hermes visits Priam he compliments the
</p>
<p>old man on his great dignity and compares him to the
</p>
<p>immortal gods ; " divine Priam " is one of Homer's
</p>
<p>most constant epithets.
</p>
<p>Now, if Hermes had ever met Lear he might have paid
</p>
<p>him the same compliment. Surely there is something
</p>
<p>exceptional and almost superhuman in the greatest
</p>
<p>figures of Shakespeare ? Do they produce the effect
</p>
<p>of being ordinary or even extraordinary individuals ?
</p>
<p>Does history record any man quite as pathetic as Lear, or
</p>
<p>quite as interesting as Hamlet ? And even Lord Bacon
</p>
<p>does not seem as wise as Prospero. Read his biography,
</p>
<p>and place it side by side with Shakespeare's Prospero,
</p>
<p>and see.
</p>
<p>Has not Shakespeare himself hinted that his figures
</p>
<p>are partly mythologic and partly symbolic when he
</p>
<p>withdraws them so far from the everyday world. Why
</p>
<p>is Prospero placed in a magic island ? Why are Hamlet
</p>
<p>and Macbeth and Lear all withdrawn into a remote and
</p>
<p>almost legendary past ? Even Othello, who is much more
</p>
<p>Hke an ordinary human being, is still set apart as if he
</p>
<p>were a symbolic figure by his blackness.

</p>
<p>The second great difference between the mythologist
</p>
<p>28 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>and the psychologist is that the latter is not fundamentally
</p>
<p>historical, whereas the former is., The modern psy-
</p>
<p>chologist is pre-eminently an egoist and an individualist :
</p>
<p>he choses subjects mainly because they interest him,
</p>
<p>and all the importance they receive for others will be
</p>
<p>due to Jiis method of treatment. In other words, as
</p>
<p>Hazlitt says of Wordsworth, he does not wish to share
</p>
<p>his own importance even with his subject. Flaubert,
</p>
<p>for instance, chooses in Madame Bovary an unimportant
</p>
<p>and almost trivial heroine ; all the interest is lent by his
</p>
<p>method of treatment.
</p>
<p>The mj^thologist, on the other hand, deals with the
</p>
<p>matter which is traditional, which is a part of national
</p>
<p>history and which, as such, is already interesting to his
</p>
<p>audience as in the case of the Greek dramatists whose
</p>
<p>material is chosen from certain definite historic cycles.
</p>
<p>Now, in this respect, Shakespeare and his fellows seem
</p>
<p>to offer a curious half-way house. Some of their subjects
</p>
<p> such as Lear and Macbeth  are genuinely traditional
</p>
<p>in the Greek sense ; others  such as Othello  are derived
</p>
<p>from known sources but are not exactly traditional.
</p>
<p>Now, if Shakespeare be truly a psychologic realist, it is
</p>
<p>exceedingly difficult to see why he did not invent his own
</p>
<p>plots. To economise labour is the usual reply  he took
</p>
<p>what was to hand to save himself trouble. Yes ! But
</p>
<p>the method which he actually did adopt was one which
</p>
<p>saved him no labour whatever, not, at least, in the majority
</p>
<p>of cases.
</p>
<p>As anyone can see by comparing the two together,
</p>
<p>Shakespeare always reconstructs his source, and often
</p>

</p>
<p>alters it almost beyond recognition. In the case of Leai',
</p>
<p>Introduction 29
</p>
<p>for instance, the original story ended happily, so far,
</p>
<p>at any rate, as Lear himself was concerned ; the good
</p>
<p>daughter  Cordelia  restored him to his kingdom, and
</p>
<p>he reigned in peace until his death.
</p>
<p>This is the version as we find it in practically all the
</p>
<p>Elizabethan sources ; Geoffrey of Monmouth, Hohnshed,
</p>
<p>The Mirror jor Magistrates, Spenser's Faerie Queene,
</p>
<p>etc, etc.
</p>
<p>Moreover, in the original story, there was no Gloucester,
</p>
<p>no Edmund, no Edgar, all these figures come from a
</p>
<p>totally different source in Sidney's Arcadia, and they
</p>
<p>alter the whole bias of the plot. Why not recognise
</p>
<p>that the resulting story is really a new thing, and call it
</p>
<p>by a new name ?
</p>
<p>Surely we find ourselves here on the horns of a very
</p>
<p>curious dilemma ! Does Shakespeare choose the subject
</p>
<p>of King Lear, as Coleridge says he did, because it was
</p>
<p>already endeared to the minds of his audience ? Quite
</p>
<p>possibly !
</p>
<p>But, if so, why does he alter it so amazingly, for there
</p>
<p>is nothing, as a rule, which people more resent than an
</p>
<p>unfamiliar ending to a familiar tale ?
</p>
<p>Moreover, Geoffrey of Monmouth's Lear does not strip
</p>
<p>himself entirely ; he retains a certain portion of his
</p>
<p>kingdom for himself, and it is to gain this portion that
</p>
<p>Goneril and Regan make war upon him. Thus, in the
</p>
<p>original tale, Lear, Goneril and Regan are all of them
</p>
<p>more intelligible in their actions than they are in Shake-
</p>
<p>speare. But why take an improbable plot, and then
</p>
<p>proceed to make it still more improbable by your method

<p>of treatment ?
</p>
<p>30 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>The case is even more curious when we turn to compare
</p>
<p>Hamlet with its source.
</p>
<p>In the original Amleth saga there is no ghost, no Polonius,
</p>
<p>no Opheha, no Laertes ; the Polonius and Laertes story
</p>
<p>simply does not exist in the Amleth saga, and the ending
</p>
<p>is totally different, for the prince conquers his opponents,
</p>
<p>gets himself happily married to an EngUsh princess, and
</p>
<p>succeeds triumphantly to his father's throne. When he
</p>
<p>has killed his uncle he makes a speech to the assembled
</p>
<p>people : " It is I who have wiped off my country's
</p>
<p>shame ; I who have quenched my mother's dishonour ;
</p>
<p>I who have beaten back oppression ; I who have put
</p>
<p>to death the murderer ; I who have baffled the artful
</p>
<p>hand of my uncle with retorted arts. Were he Uving,
</p>
<p>each new day would have multiplied his crimes. I
</p>
<p>resented the wrong done to father and to fatherland :
</p>
<p>I slew him who was governing you outrageously,
</p>
<p>and more hardly than beseemed men. Acknowledge
</p>
<p>my service, honour my wit, give me the throne if I
</p>
<p>have earned it."
</p>
<p>Amleth makes a long speech to this effect, and the
</p>
<p>conclusion of the whole matter is :
</p>
<p>" Every heart had been moved while the young man
</p>
<p>thus spoke ; he affected some to compassion, and some
</p>
<p>even to tears. When the lamentation ceased, he was
</p>
<p>appointed king by general acclaim."
</p>
<p>Moreover, the character of the hero is quite different
</p>
<p>for the hero of the Amleth saga never hesitates over
</p>
<p>his vengeance, but pursues it with undeviating energy.
</p>
<p>It is just because he does show such a magnificent

<p>combination of energy and subtlety that the people
</p>
<p>Introduction 31
</p>
<p>choose him as king. In fact, we should hardly know
</p>
<p>that Hamlet was supposed to be drawn from the Amleth
</p>
<p>saga, were it not for the similarity of the names, and
</p>
<p>for the fact, that, in each case, the hero is a Prince of
</p>
<p>Denmark.
</p>
<p>Why retain the names when they mean so little ? Why
</p>
<p>not acknowledge that the story is new ?
</p>
<p>In the case of Hamlet, at any rate, I shall endeavour
</p>
<p>to answer the question in the following pages.
</p>
<p>I would sum up as follows :
</p>
<p>(i) Shakespeare wrote his plays for a definite audience
</p>
<p>at a definite point of time. We know the period at which
</p>
<p>the plays were written, and we know, within a few years,
</p>
<p>the dates of the greater number. It should, therefore, be
</p>
<p>possible to discover with more or less accuracy what
</p>
<p>the plays would mean for their intended audience, and
</p>
<p>we cannot be sure that we comprehend them fully until
</p>
<p>we study the point of view of this audience.
</p>
<p>(2) The point of view of an Elizabethan audience can
</p>
<p>only be understood by means of a careful study of the
</p>
<p>history of the time which should, therefore, be an integral
</p>
<p>part of the study of the plays.
</p>
<p>(3) It is possible that we interpret Shakespeare too
</p>
<p>purely from a psychological standpoint ; in any case,
</p>
<p>the psychology of the sixteenth century is bound to differ
</p>
<p>from that of the nineteenth century, and it is important
</p>
<p>to show in what its differences consist.
</p>
<p>I propose to apply this new method, as fully and as
</p>
<p>carefully as I can, in the case of Hamlet.
</p>
<p>My one aim throughout will be to get the point of view

<p>CHAPTER I
</p>
<p>RICHARD II. AND HAMLET
</p>
<p>The date of Hamlet is uncertain, but a careful examina-
</p>
<p>tion of the evidence suggests that Shakespeare's first
</p>
<p>sketch of the play was written in 1601, and that this was
</p>
<p>expanded into the final form in 1603-4. It seems likely
</p>
<p>that Shakespeare wrote his first draft in 1601, while the
</p>
<p>Lord Chamberlain's men were travelling because they
</p>
<p>were for the time being out of favour at Court on account
</p>
<p>of their connection with the Essex conspiracy ; this is
</p>
<p>apparently referred to in the allusion to the "inhibition
</p>
<p>of the players to perform in the city owing to the late
</p>
<p>innovation." ^
</p>
<p>The whole question of Richard II. is so closely bound
</p>
<p>up with that of Hamlet, that it is necessary to dwell upon
</p>
<p>it here at some length. It will show us, for one thing, how
</p>
<p>intimately Shakespeare's company and he himself were
</p>
<p>connected with poHtical matters through the medium
</p>
<p>of Shakespeare's own plays, and it will show us also how
</p>
<p>material which might in itself seem innocent was regularly
</p>
<p>adapted to political purposes.
</p>
<p>In the year 1596 the Pope published a bull empowering
</p>
<p>Ehzabeth's own subjects to depose her. The queen
</p>
<p>knew that there was much discontent with her policy ;
</p>
<p>Essex was an exceedingly popular and exceedingly gifted
</p>

</p>
<p>soldier, and his enemies insinuated to the queen that he
</p>
<p>aimed at deposing her, and seizing the crown for himself.
</p>
<p>Now Richard II. was a king who had been deposed, and
</p>
<p>the Essex partisans were suspected of using his fate as a
</p>
<p>kind of symbol of what Essex intended with Ehzabeth.
</p>
<p>The queen and her advisers revealed continual nervous-
</p>
<p>ness on this subject.
</p>
<p>On July nth, 1600,^ interrogations and notes were
</p>
<p>presented by Attorney-General Coke on Dr Haywarde's
</p>
<p>book on Richard II. in proof
</p>
<p>" that the Doctor selected a story 200 years old and published
</p>
<p>it last year intending the application of it to this time, the
</p>
<p>plot being that of a king who is taxed for misgovernment and
</p>
<p>his counsel for corrupt and covetous dealings for private
</p>
<p>ends ; the king is censured for conferring benefits on hated
</p>
<p>favourites, the nobles become discontented and the commons
</p>
<p>groan under continual taxation, whereupon the king is
</p>
<p>deposed and in the end murdered."
</p>
<p>Haywarde (it is stated) confessed that he had altered
</p>
<p>history in certain respects to suit his purposes ; as, for
</p>
<p>instance, having heard of a benevolence under Richard III.
</p>
<p>he transferred it to Richard II.
</p>
<p>July 2ist, 1600. Essex admitted his treason.
</p>
<p>"He permitted underhand that treasonable book of Henry IV.
</p>
<p>to be printed and published ; it being plainly deciphered, not
</p>
<p>only by the matter and by the epistle itself ; for what end
</p>
<p>and for whose behalf it was made, but also the Earl himself
</p>
<p>being so often present at the playing thereof - and with great
</p>
<p>applause giving countenance to it."
</p>
<p>January 22nd, 1601. The examination of Dr Haywarde
</p>
<p>showed how repeatedly he had altered his book.

</p>
<p>Haywarde's book was dedicated to Essex in terms
</p>
<p>which in themselves suggested suspicions : the dedication
</p>
<p>ran :

<p>" Roberto Comiti Essexise . . . Vicecomiti Herefordiae "

</p>
<p>The phrase about his future greatness was taken as
</p>
<p>referring to an expectation of the kingship.

<p>his traitorous faction ; then Tyrone and he were to join their
</p>
<p>forces and by destroying her Majesty Essex to be made King
</p>
<p>of England."
</p>
<p>The same book is once more made important evidence
</p>
<p>against Essex in the " Directions to Preachers " given on
</p>
<p>February 14th :
</p>
<p>" Two years since a history of Henry IV. was printed and
</p>
<p>published wherein all the complaints and slanders which
</p>
<p>have been given out by seditious traitors against the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, both in England and Ireland, are set down and falsely
</p>
<p>attributed to those times, thereby cunningly insinuating that
</p>
<p>the same abuses being now in this realm that were in the
</p>
<p>days of Richard II., the like course might be taken for
</p>
<p>redress. . . .
</p>
<p>"The Earl confessed that he kept the copy with him 14
</p>
<p>days, plotting how he might become another Henry IV. . . .
</p>
<p>" If he had not been prevented there had never been a

<p>rebellion in England since Richard II. more desperate and

<p>dangerous. ..."
</p>
<p>James Knowle said he had agreed with Tyrone that
</p>
<p>Tyrone should be king of Ireland and Essex of England.^
</p>
<p>Now, Shakespeare's company were almost as much

<p>involved as Dr Haywarde in the dispute over Richard II.,

</p>
<p>them 40 shillings more than their ordinary to do so.
</p>
<p>Examinate and his fellows had determined to play some

<p>other play, holding that of King Richard as being so old and
</p>
<p>so long out of use that they should have a small company at
</p>
<p>it, but at this request they were content to play it."
</p>
<p>Not only did they play it, but they went on playing it
</p>
<p>some forty times in all during the whole period of the
</p>
<p>trial and execution. Wyndham says in this connection :
</p>
<p>" Theatres were then, as newspapers are now, the cock-pits
</p>
<p>of religious and literary contention. . . .

</p>
<p>prevented the performance of Richard II., with his deposition
</p>
<p>and death some ' forty times ' in open streets and houses, as
</p>
<p>Elizabeth complained ; and indeed it is hard to account for
</p>
<p>the Queen's sustained irritation at this drama save on the
</p>
<p>ground of its close association with her past fears of Essex-
</p>
<p>Months after the Earl's execution she exclaimed to Lambard '
</p>
<p>' I am Richard the Second, know ye not that ? '
</p>
<p>" Shakespeare's colleagues, acting Shakespeare's plays, gave
</p>
<p>umbrage to Essex's political opponents in Henry I V., applauded
</p>
<p>his ambition in Henry V., and were accessories to his dis-
</p>
<p>loyalty in Richard II." ^
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's company having incurred the serious dis-

<p>pleasure of the queen, did not perform at Court, Christmas
</p>
<p>1601-2, and it was during the period of their disgrace that,

<p>and, apparently, were often used, as in the case of
</p>
<p>Richard 11. , with a direct political bearing.

<p>purposes.
</p>
<p>(3) That, in each case, the dramatic author involved
</p>
<p>was Shakespeare himself.
</p>
<p>Now, what was the reply of Essex's friends to the
</p>
<p>accusation that he had intended to emulate Henry of
</p>
<p>Lancaster and make himself King of England ? The
</p>
<p>answer was that Essex was an impassioned partisan of
</p>
<p>James I. and of the Scottish succession, and that he had
</p>
<p>fallen a martyr to the cause of James. Let us examine
</p>
<p>the political situation a little more closely in order to see
</p>
<p>how this came about. Let us endeavour to place ourselves
</p>
<p>in the exact position of an Elizabethan audience when
</p>
<p>the play of Hamlet was produced.
</p>
<p>During the last years of Elizabeth's reign the great
</p>
<p>problem of practical politics lay in the succession to the
</p>
<p>throne. The queen was visibly growing feeble ; she
</p>
<p>hated any mention of a successor ; but it was obvious
</p>
<p>that, in the ordinary course of nature, her life could
</p>
<p>not last much longer. The Tudor policy had been to
</p>
<p>concentrate power in the hands of the monarchy, and,
</p>
<p>therefore, the character of the so^'ereign was all powerful
</p>
<p>in determining the future of the realm.
</p>
<p>Foreign politics presented many points of extreme
</p>
<p>difficulty ; Spain was still a most powerful and dangerous

<p>foe, continually plotting new Armadas : there was a plot

</p>
<p>for a landing at Mi] ford Haven in the very year of the
</p>
<p>queen's death, 1603.^
</p>
<p>At no period in Enghsh history had the character of
</p>
<p>the monarch been more important, and in no single
</p>
<p>instance had the succession been so doubtful and men's
</p>
<p>minds so hopelessly distracted.
</p>
<p>James of Scotland was, undoubtedly, the person who
</p>
<p>had 'the best title to the crown, but there were many
</p>
<p>reasons against him ; he had been set aside, somewhat
</p>
<p>unaccountably, by the will of Henry VHI. in favour of
</p>
<p>a younger branch ; he was a Scot, and, as such, might
</p>
<p>be considered ineligible ; by English law no Scottish
</p>
<p>subject could inherit landed property in England, not
</p>
<p>even the smallest estate ; how then, the lawyers argued,
</p>
<p>could a Scot inherit the throne ? ^
</p>
<p>There was also a considerable amount of prejudice
</p>
<p>against Scotland simply as a country.
</p>
<p>" It is difficult," says Mr Martin Hume, " for Englishmen in
</p>
<p>these times to conceive the distrust and disHke then entertained
</p>
<p>for Scotchmen. They were, of course, foreigners and had for
</p>
<p>centuries been more or less closely allied to France, the
</p>
<p>secular enemy of England ; their country was poor and a
</p>
<p>large portion of it in semi-savagery." ^
</p>
<p>The Protestantism of Scotland was, naturally, a feature
</p>
<p>in its favour ; the English had vehemently taken the side
</p>
<p>of Murray and his Protestant lords as against the queen ;
</p>
<p>the English populace embraced the cause of Murray far
</p>
<p>more ardently than Elizabeth herself ; they espoused
</p>
<p>absolutely the cause of the Scottish lords, and when the

</p>
<p>Scottish lords commissioned the historian  Buchanan  ^to
</p>
<p>defend their actions, the English populace probably
</p>
<p>accepted as accurate every word of his terrific indictment.
</p>
<p>English sentiment was, on the whole, strongly in
</p>
<p>favour of James of Scotland ; he was the natural heir,
</p>
<p>and notwithstanding all prejudices against Scotland, there
</p>
<p>was an obvious and great advantage to be gained by
</p>
<p>uniting the whole island under one rule. The partisans
</p>
<p>of James very naturally pointed out the immense benefits
</p>
<p>that would accrue from the union of the crowns, and
</p>
<p>especially the great increase of safety to England herself.
</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that those plays of Shakespeare
</p>
<p>which are obviously connected with Essex are also plays
</p>
<p>which all lay stress on the unity of Britain. Thus, in
</p>
<p>Henry V., he pays an open and daring compliment to
</p>
<p>Essex,^ then in Ireland, and it is also in Henry V. that
</p>
<p>he introduces, obviously as symbols of national unity,
</p>
<p>the four soldiers drawn from the four quarters of Britain :
</p>
<p>Gower the Englishman, Fluellen the Welshman, Macmorris
</p>
<p>the Irishman, and Jamy the Scotchman. This would be
</p>
<p>absurdly impossible in the time of the actual Henry V. ;
</p>
<p>but it represents the exact ideal at which the partisans

</p>
<p>favour of James of Scotland ; but it could not be said to be
</p>
<p>unanimous ; there were the legal difficulties in the way, and
</p>
<p>a further difficulty lay in the character of James himself.
</p>
<p>James' character had, or seemed to have, many ad-
</p>
<p>mirable traits ; but it was a baffling and a difficult one.
</p>
<p>He had a great reputation for learning, and for interest
</p>
<p>in philosophy and theology ; he was mild and merciful
</p>
<p>by temperament, sternness and cruelty were far from
</p>
<p>him ; he hated bloodshed, and he was the least revengeful
</p>
<p>of men ; no trait in him was more marked than his
</p>
<p>reluctance to punish even when punishment seemed just
</p>
<p>and necessary, and most of the odium he incurred in hfc
</p>
<p>was on account of this very reluctance. His whole tone
</p>
<p>of mind was serious and reflective, and, though he was
</p>
<p>often coarse in his language, he was exempt from the
</p>
<p>grosser vices.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was totally unlike the Tudor
</p>
<p>sovereigns with their love of pleasure, their bonhomie,
</p>
<p>their frank willingness to mingle with all classes of their
</p>
<p>subjects. He was melancholy and retiring ; he had one
</p>
<p>confidant in the Earl of Mar, his fellow-pupil under
</p>
<p>Buchanan  in whom he seemed to repose implicit trust ;
</p>
<p>but to the majority of men he was inaccessible and difficult.
</p>
<p>He loved seclusion in a way almost incomprehensible to
</p>
<p>people accustomed to the bustling and vigorous tempera-
</p>
<p>ment of the Tudors.
</p>
<p>His political position was, and always had been, one of
</p>
<p>extraordinary difficulty ; with his father murdered, his
</p>
<p>mother in lifelong imprisonment, and his country full of
</p>
<p>factious, partisan nobles, there seems to have been no

</p>
<p>one, except possibly Mar, whom he could intimately
</p>
<p>42 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>trust. His weapons in these circumstances were a baffling
</p>
<p>subtlety, a habit of verbal fence, a passion for keeping
</p>
<p>his own counsel which went so far that he was at times
</p>
<p>suspected of insanity. His position made him a very-
</p>
<p>close student of men and manners, for his very existence
</p>
<p>depended on the care and accuracy of his judgment ;
</p>
<p>almost all his Stuart predecessors had met premature
</p>
<p>deaths, several by assassination, and he only escaped a
</p>
<p>similar fate by his reticence and subtlety, his genius for
</p>
<p>evasion. All his life he prided himself on his knowledge
</p>
<p>of human nature, his power of judging character at a
</p>
<p>glance, and so far as his youth was concerned, he had
</p>
<p>apparently exercised that knowledge with considerable
</p>
<p>skill ; at an}^ rate he preserved himself from a premature
</p>
<p>death which was more than any of his Stuart predecessors
</p>
<p>had done.
</p>
<p>His melancholy, his love of seclusion, his baffling
</p>
<p>subtlety, the occasional doubts of his sanity might all
</p>
<p>be explained by the difficulties of his position, and by
</p>
<p>the shifts to which he was put in extricating himself from
</p>
<p>such serious perils.
</p>
<p>His extraordinary carelessness and untidiness in dress,
</p>
<p>which revolted many observers, might possibly be set
</p>
<p>down to a similar cause.
</p>
<p>More serious defects, however, suggested themselves,
</p>
<p>the most fatal being, apparently, a singular vacillation
</p>
<p>and weakness of will. The Tudors had been, above all,
</p>
<p>strong and vigorous statesmen ; they were powerful
</p>
<p>rulers ; their will-power and determination ranked with
</p>
<p>their popularity among their chief assets. But James

</p>
<p>seemed incapable of strong and effective action ; he
</p>
<p>Richard II. and Hamlet 43
</p>
<p>allowed the younger Bothwell to usurp power and
</p>
<p>practically make himself the master of Scotland while
</p>
<p>he, James, stood aside in comparative retirement ; the
</p>
<p>younger Bothwell held him in a kind of duresse vile, and
</p>
<p>James made no effective protest.
</p>
<p>Anyone who will read the correspondence of Elizabeth
</p>
<p>and James will see how continually the queen reproaches
</p>
<p>him for these defects of character ; he knows very well,
</p>
<p>she maintains, that his subjects destroy his royal authority,
</p>
<p>and even plot against his life ; but he does not execute
</p>
<p>justice. It is right to be merciful; but when mercy
</p>
<p>shows itself as complaisance towards villains and
</p>
<p>scoundrels, then mercy itself becomes a weakness.
</p>
<p>It is his duty as a king to defend his realm against
</p>
<p>evil doers, to execute justice, and to punish rebels ; his
</p>
<p>realm is a mass of disorder; it proceeds from bad to
</p>
<p>worse, and it is his fault because he does not punish where
</p>
<p>punishment is due. So long as violence is allowed to
</p>
<p>flourish, there can be no security in a kingdom. Elizabeth
</p>
<p>reiterates these charges again and again, in different
</p>
<p>epistles and in various ways. And James hardly defends
</p>
<p>himself. He practically admits that the indictment is
</p>
<p>just ; he sees what he ought to do, but he cannot do it ;
</p>
<p>he knows very well that the times are out of joint, but
</p>
<p>he does not feel himself vigorous enough to set them
</p>
<p>right; he cannot assume the necessary severity. The
</p>
<p>queen accuses him continually of vacillation and delay ;
</p>
<p>he knows what he ought to do, why does he not do it ?
</p>
<p>And James can only reply by admitting the procrasti-
</p>
<p>nation and acknowledging the delay. From the Tudor

</p>
<p>point of view, this vacillation of will and this procrastina-
</p>
<p>44 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>tion were precisely the qualities most dangerous to a
</p>
<p>monarch and most likely to be fatal to his people.
</p>
<p>We, in these later days, inevitably consider James I.
</p>
<p>and VI. from what we know of his history on the English
</p>
<p>throne ; it is prosperity, as Bacon says, which really tries
</p>
<p>a man ; but the James who was known to the Elizabethans
</p>
<p>in the year 1601 was almost precisely the James described
</p>
<p>above ; there is not a single trait which has not complete
</p>
<p>warrant in the Scottish historians or in his own corres-
</p>
<p>pondence with Elizabeth.^
</p>
<p>We must also remember the fact that the Scottish
</p>
<p>monarch had a special connection with Denmark ; his
</p>
<p>queen  Anne  was a princess of Denmark ; he himself
</p>
<p>had brought her home in a romantic voyage ; there were
</p>
<p>Danes resident at the Scottish court. Moreover, the
</p>
<p>murderer of James' father, the elder Bothwell, had also
</p>
<p>taken refuge in Denmark and had ended his Ufe imprisoned
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>This, then, was the pohtical situation at the exact
</p>
<p>moment Hamlet was written : the whole future of the
</p>
<p>realm turned on the question of the succession and the
</p>
<p>character of the future monarch ; the most direct heir to
</p>
<p>the realm was a prince who was melancholy by tempera-
</p>
<p>ment, whose character seemed flawed by a vacillating
</p>
<p>will and a habit of procrastination ; on the other hand,
</p>
<p>he had an unexpected capacity for acting with decision
</p>
<p>in emergencies, as, for instance, in the Gowry con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ; he was one of the most learned princes in
</p>
<p>Europe, and he took an intense interest in philosophy and
</p>
<p>theology.

<p>Richard II. and Hamlet 45
</p>
<p>His whole situation was tragic and difficult : his father
</p>
<p>had been murdered, and his mother had married the
</p>
<p>murderer ; to the amazement of Europe he had allowed
</p>
<p>his royal authority to be usurped and his own person
</p>
<p>placed in jeopardy by a man of the same title and family
</p>
<p>as the usurper, a person who, to the excited imagination
</p>
<p>of the time, seemed almost like a reincarnation of the
</p>
<p>same evil genius who had ruined the mother.
</p>
<p>Let us now examine carefully the connection of
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's friends and patrons with the Scottish,
</p>
<p>prince. The nation, taken as a whole, seems to have
</p>
<p>profoundly mistrusted the Cecils, and Essex made himself
</p>
<p>the mouthpiece of this mistrust. It was known how
</p>
<p>completely Elizabeth trusted Burleigh and how great
</p>
<p>her confidence was ; but the Essex faction accused him
</p>
<p>of dishonest diplomacy, of spying, of eavesdropping,
</p>
<p>of " laying trains to entrap people " and many other
</p>
<p>objectionable practices. After the death of Burleigh
</p>
<p>Robert Cecil succeeded, and more than succeeded, to his
</p>
<p>father's ill-repute. One group of his enemies accused
</p>
<p>him of designing to marry the Lady Arabella Stuart,
</p>
<p>and seize the crown for himself in her name ; Essex,
</p>
<p>at his trial, declared that Robert Cecil was in collusion
</p>
<p>with the Spaniards and wished to dehver the crown to
</p>
<p>the Spanish Infanta; it is quite possible that Essex
</p>
<p>sincerely believed this, and that it was one of the motives
</p>
<p>for his action  at any rate, he said so upon his
</p>
<p>oath.
</p>
<p>It is obvious that the Essex conspiracy was aimed
</p>
<p>especially at Raleigh and Robert Cecil, and was essentially

<p>an endeavour to take the queen from their influence.
</p>
<p>46 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>With the details of this conspiracy, in so far as they affect
</p>
<p>Shakespeare, I will deal later. Here I onty wish to point
</p>
<p>out that Shakespeare himself had a double connection
</p>
<p>with it, once through his company and once through
</p>
<p>his friend and patron  Southampton.
</p>
<p>The Essex conspirators had, as we have seen, requested
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's company to perform the play of Richard II.,
</p>
<p>since, because it dealt with the deposition of a monarch,
</p>
<p>it was supposed to have a definite bearing on their
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>The attempt on the queen's person was made and
</p>
<p>failed ; Essex, the brilliant idol of the populace, was
</p>
<p>tried and executed ; Southampton, Shakespeare's patron
</p>
<p>and friend, was condemned to death, though afterwards
</p>
<p>reprieved, and at the time Hamlet was written he was
</p>
<p>still in the Tower.
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's company, as we have seen, were practically
</p>
<p>disgraced because of their sympathy with Essex. So
</p>
<p>general was this sympathy and so determined were the
</p>
<p>players to make capital of it on the stage, that for several
</p>
<p>years after the Essex conspiracy no plays dealing with
</p>
<p>any conspiracy were allowed at all, the authorities being
</p>
<p>firmly convinced that any conspiracy play, whatever its
</p>
<p>ostensible subject, would really allude to Essex.
</p>
<p>Now, in addition to these reasons  the popular sympathy
</p>
<p>with Essex, his own company's marked connection 
</p>
<p>Shakespeare had reasons of his own for taking the greatest
</p>
<p>interest in the Essex conspiracy. Southampton was
</p>
<p>certainly Shakespeare's most generous patron ; if, as
</p>
<p>seems plausible, he was also the hero of the sonnets, he

<p>was Shakespeare's best-beloved friend. As the result
</p>
<p>Richard II. and Hamlet 47
</p>
<p>of his connection with that conspiracy he was under
</p>
<p>sentence of death ; he was reprieved for the time being ;
</p>
<p>but, any day, the intrigues of Robert Cecil and his
</p>
<p>faction might destroy him.
</p>
<p>Such was the exact situation when Shakespeare's

<p>Hamlet was produced.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER II
</p>
<p>HAMLET AND THE DARNLEY MURDER
</p>
<p>The subject of Hamlet was sufficiently well known before
</p>
<p>Shakespeare treated of it. It is told in the Historia
</p>
<p>Danica of Saxo Grammaticus, who wrote about 1180-
</p>
<p>1208. It appeared translated into French in Belief orest's
</p>
<p>Histoires Tragiques in 1570. There is an English prose
</p>
<p>version, The Hystorie oj Hamhlet, which dates from 1608
</p>
<p>and is thus certainly later in date than the play, though
</p>
<p>possibly there were earlier versions which have been
</p>
<p>lost.
</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that a play on the subject existed
</p>
<p>as early as 1589, for Nash makes a plain reference to it in
</p>
<p>his preface to Greene's Menaphon (1587 or 1589), and
</p>
<p>Lodge in his Wit's Miser ie alludes to a ghost which cried
</p>
<p>like an oyster- wife, " Hamlet, revenge " :  play of Hamlet
</p>
<p>was also performed by the Lord Chamberlain's company
</p>
<p>in 1594. There is a general consensus of opinion that
</p>
<p>this early Hamlet cannot have been by Shakespeare,
</p>
<p>since Meres does not refer to it in his famous list given
</p>
<p>in the Palladis Tamia of 1598.
</p>
<p>The general consensus of opinion is that this early
</p>
<p>drama was probably by Kyd.
</p>
<p>Since Kyd's play has disappeared, it is totally im-
</p>
<p>possible to ascertain whether he did or did not use historical
</p>
<p>material as an element in that drama though, so far as

</p>
<p>Hamlet and the Darnley Murder 49
</p>
<p>concerns any material existing previous to 1589, he may
</p>
<p>quite well have done so, and I would call the reader's
</p>
<p>attention very carefully to the fact, for it may be signifi-
</p>
<p>cant, that the only historical parallels I find to known
</p>
<p>elements in the earlier Hamlet are all, as a matter of fact,
</p>
<p>anterior to this date. My method will be to compare
</p>
<p>the play with the Amleth story on the one side and the
</p>
<p>historical details on the other, and to show that the
</p>
<p>action of the play far more closely agrees with that of
</p>
<p>history than with that of the saga, and also that the
</p>
<p>main problems of the play are not the problems of the
</p>
<p>saga but are certainly those of the history.
</p>
<p>In Shakespeare's drama the queen is called Gertrude ;
</p>
<p>her first husband is Hamlet, like his son, and the murderous
</p>
<p>usurper is Claudius. In the saga, the queen is Geruth,
</p>
<p>her first husband is Horvendil, and his brother, who slays
</p>
<p>him, is Feng.
</p>
<p>What the saga says concerning the murder is the
</p>
<p>following :
</p>
<p>" Such great good fortune stung Feng with jealousy so
</p>
<p>that he resolved treacherously to waylay his brother  thus
</p>
<p>showing that goodness is not safe even from those of a man's
</p>
<p>own household. And behold, when a chance came to murder
</p>
<p>him, his bloody hand sated even the deadly passion of his
</p>
<p>soul. Then he took the wife of the brother he had butchered,
</p>
<p>capping unnatural murder with incest."
</p>
<p>Feng admits his brother's murder to the people ; but
</p>
<p>he invents a justification for his deed by saying that
</p>
<p>his brother had planned the murder of the queen 
</p>
<p>Gertrude. There was thus nothing secret about the
</p>
<p>murder which took place publicly, and which was ac-

</p>
<p>knowledged before the whole court. The prose Hy^tone
</p>
<p>50 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>of HamUet gives exactly the same version as Saxo
</p>
<p>Grammaticus ; it tells how the adulterer murdered his
</p>
<p>brother at a banquet, and then slandered the dead man
</p>
<p>by saying that he would have slain his wife ; "so,
</p>
<p>instead of pursuing him as a parricide and an incestuous
</p>
<p>person, all the courtiers admired and flattered him in his
</p>
<p>good fortune."
</p>
<p>We may now turn to Shakespeare and note how close
</p>
<p>are the known parallels to the history of James I.  the
</p>
<p>identical person in whom both Shakespeare and his
</p>
<p>audience had, at that moment, reason to take such a
</p>
<p>profound interest.
</p>
<p>To begin with, the device of having the murder told
</p>
<p>by a ghost has no parallel whatever in the saga source
</p>
<p>(there would be no motive for it) ; but it had a parallel
</p>
<p>in the Darnley murder for the Scottish ballad-makers
</p>
<p>had already hit on exactly that device. Thus, in Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh, 1567, there was published a ballad entitled The
</p>
<p>Testament and Tragedie of the umquhile King Henrie Stuart,
</p>
<p>oj gude memorie.
</p>
<p>In it, the unhappy ghost of the murderec^ king returns
</p>
<p>and laments :
</p>
<p>" Sum tyme scho ^ thocht I was sa amiabill,
</p>
<p>Sa perfect, plesand, and sa delectabill ;

<p>^ i.e. Mary.
</p>
<p>Hamlet and the Darnley Murder 51
</p>
<p>Then, further, the murder in the saga takes place, as
</p>
<p>we have seen, in an open and obvious way, and is fully
</p>
<p>acknowledged.
</p>
<p>In Shakespeare the ghost explains that his murder
</p>
<p>is secret and stealthy ^ :
</p>
<p>" Now, Hamlet, hear :
</p>
<p>'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
</p>
<p>A serpent stung me ; so the whole ear of Denmark
</p>
<p>Is by a forged process of my death
</p>
<p>Rankly abused :
</p>
<p>. . . Sleeping within my orchard,
</p>
<p>My custom always of the afternoon,
</p>
<p>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole

<p>With juice of cursed hebenon in a via),
</p>
<p>And in the porches of my ears did pour
</p>
<p>The leporous distilment ; . . .
</p>
<p>And a most instant tetter bark'd about.
</p>
<p>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
</p>
<p>All my smooth body."
</p>
<p>Now, the father of James 1. was finally murdered by
</p>
<p>means of, or at least concurrently with, a gunpowder
</p>
<p>explosion ; but it was very generally beheved that a
</p>
<p>previous attempt had been made to poison him.
</p>
<p>Burton ^ says :
</p>
<p>" Darnley was seized with a sudden and acute illness
</p>
<p>which broke out cutaneously. Poison was at first naturally
</p>
<p>suspected. The disease was speedily pronounced to be
</p>
<p>small-pox ; but it has been conjectured that it may have
</p>
<p>been one of those forms of contamination which had then
</p>
<p>begun to make their silent and mysterious visitation in this
</p>
<p>country, while the immediate cause by which they were
</p>
<p>communicated was yet unknown. From what occurred
</p>
<p>afterwards it became a current belief that he had been
</p>
<p>poisoned."

<p>The plot for his destruction with gunpowder was next

<p>attempted ; but it does not appear that he perished as

<p>a result of the explosion. Burton continues :

<p>" It seems that the intended victim with his page . . .

<p>Now here we surely have remarkable correspondences
</p>
<p>with the Shakespearian murder : we have the body of
</p>
<p>the victim covered with a " loathsome tetter " which is
</p>
<p>ascribed to the malign influence of poison ; we have the
</p>
<p>secret character of the murder itself, and we have the
</p>
<p>body of the victim found in an " orchard."
</p>
<p>Let us once again compare Shakespeare with a source
</p>
<p>which was certainly available both for himself and for
</p>
<p>his audience, Buchanan's Detection}
</p>
<p>" Ere he was passed a mile from Stirhng all the parts of
</p>
<p>his body were taken with such a sore ache, as it might easily
</p>
<p>appear that the same proceeded not of the force of any sickness
</p>
<p>but by plain treachery. The tokens of which treachery,
</p>
<p>certain black pimples, so soon as he was come to Glasgow,
</p>
<p>broke out all over his whole body with so great ache and
</p>
<p>such pain throughout his limbs, that he lingered out his life
</p>
<p>with very small hope of escape ; and yet all this while the
</p>
<p>queen would not suffer so much as a physician to come
</p>
<p>near him."
</p>
<p>Buchanan dwells on the same theme in his Oration,'^ also
</p>
<p>a source available alike to Shakespeare and Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>audience, and probably known very well to all of them :
</p>
<p>"It is certainly known that he was poisoned. . . . For

</p>
<p>hath he received much ? The thing itself, the Disease, the
</p>
<p>Pimples, the Savor do tell you. Even that much he received
</p>
<p>that brought Deformity, Forsooth, very Poison. Whatsoever
</p>
<p>it was that he received the same, the same was the Cause of
</p>
<p>his Deformity.

</p>

</p>
<p>... To whom is this Charge committed to seek out a new

<p>Medicine and curing for the King ? Forsooth to the King's
</p>
<p>Enemy, to the Queen's adulterer, the vilest of all two-footed
</p>
<p>beasts, whose house was in France defamed for poisoning
</p>
<p>and whose Servants were there for the same cause, some

<p>weigh and consider."
</p>
<p>We see here the immense stress which Buchanan lays
</p>
<p>on the secrecy of the murder, on the solitude of the
</p>
<p>unhappy victim at the time the poisoning took place,
</p>
<p>on the foulness produced in his body, the deformity, the
</p>
<p>pustules, etc., all of which agree closely with the murder
</p>
<p>of Hamlet's father, and, what is especially significant,
</p>
<p>not one of these details is to be found in either of the

<p>prose versions. In the so-called literary source, the
</p>
<p>murder is not secret, the victim is not alone, poison is
</p>
<p>54 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>not used, deformity is not caused. It is worthy of note
</p>
<p>that the very term the ghost uses in describing his con-
</p>
<p>dition, " leprous," had been appUed by contemporary
</p>
<p>writers to Darnley.
</p>
<p>A satirist called him "the leper," leprosy being con-
</p>
<p>founded with " la grosse verole." ^
</p>
<p>We may also observe that Buchanan insists that the
</p>
<p>method of poisoning was well known in France and Italy,
</p>
<p>and Hamlet himself compares his father's death to the
</p>
<p>Italian murder of Gonzago.
</p>
<p>Buchanan says : " There is no adulteress but the same
</p>
<p>is also a poisoner," and Hamlet has : " None wed the
</p>
<p>second but who killed the first." ^
</p>
<p>We may compare also Buchanan's own satire appended
</p>
<p>to his Latin version :
</p>
<p>" Et quem non potuit morientem auferre veneno
</p>
<p>Hunc fera, sulphureo pulvere tollit humo,
</p>

</p>
<p>Siccine Bothwellum poteras sme lege tenere ?
</p>
<p>Siccine Bothwelli poterant te flectere verba."
</p>
<p>This, again, has a close resemblance to the ghost's
</p>
<p>lament :
</p>
<p>" Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
</p>
<p>With witchcraft of his wit.
</p>
<p>O wicked wit and gifts that have the power
</p>
<p>So to seduce."

</p>
<p>vilest of all two-legged beasts," who has power to bend
</p>
<p>the queen with his words, and Shakespeare uses almost
</p>
<p>the same phrases.
</p>
<p>Another curious detail of the murder may be observed
</p>
<p>here. The ghost declares that he was murdered by
</p>
<p>poison  ^henbane  poured in his ear while he slept.
</p>
<p>Now, Mary's accusers,^ to heap calumny upon her, had
</p>
<p>accused her of conniving also at the murder of her
</p>
<p>first husband  Francis II. of France. That unhappy
</p>
<p>prince died from an abscess in the ear, but it was a
</p>
<p>common rumour that it was caused by poison inserted
</p>
<p>in the ear.
</p>
<p>Now, does it not look as if Shakespeare were combining
</p>
<p>in one most powerful and dramatic scene these three
</p>
<p>attempts all associated with Mary Queen of Scots : the
</p>
<p>poison in the ear from the reputed murder of Francis IL,
</p>
<p>the loathsomeness and vileness of the unhappy victim
</p>
<p>from the first attempt on Darnley, and the body of the
</p>
<p>victim found in the garden with the actual murder of
</p>
<p>Darnley ? Why not ? All these three attempts had
</p>
<p>already been associated together, one strengthening
</p>
<p>another, by the queen's accusers,^ and a dramatic poet
</p>
<p>very naturally desires to make his play as intense and
</p>
<p>moving as he can. The association, like the Darnley
</p>
<p>ghost, is already there. Why not use it ?
</p>
<p>There is, however, one important modification. At the
</p>
<p>time when Mary Queen of Scots was executed, she was
</p>
<p>regarded by the people of England with embittered hate,
</p>
<p>and it is more than probable that every word of Buchanan's

</p>
<p>56 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>terrific indictment was regarded as true. James had,
</p>
<p>however, a certain respect for the memory of his
</p>
<p>mother, and it is probable that anyone who desired
</p>
<p>to please him might be inclined to take a lenient view
</p>
<p>of Mary's connection with the crime. It has been
</p>
<p>possible even for modern historians to deny altogether
</p>
<p>or in part her connection with it, and her apologists of
</p>
<p>course (like Belleforest) did so in Shakespeare's own time.
</p>
<p>Now, this is very much what happens in Hamlet. In
</p>
<p>the saga there is no doubt whatever as to the queen's
</p>
<p>guilt ; she has not only committed adultery, she has
</p>
<p>connived at the murder, and acquiesced in the false
</p>
<p>statement invented to justify the deed. In Shakespeare,
</p>
<p>on the contrary, we have the subtlety and complexity
</p>
<p>of the history  nothing whatever is said to make it plain
</p>
<p>that the queen has knowingly acquiesced in her husband's
</p>
<p>murder. She may have done ; but though the ghost
</p>
<p>accuses her of adultery he does not say that she connived
</p>
<p>at the other crime. His attitude towards her is always
</p>
<p>tender and indulgent, and Darnley, we m.ay remember,
</p>
<p>to the last day of his recorded life sought the love of
</p>
<p>Mary, and pathetically believed in the possibility of a
</p>
<p>reconciliation with her. That is half the pathos of
</p>
<p>Darnley's fate, and it is certainly half the pathos of
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's ghost that he continues to love his erring
</p>
<p>wife in spite of all.
</p>
<p>As a reference to Buchanan will at once show, he lays
</p>
<p>enormous stress on the undiminished affection of the
</p>
<p>unhappy victim which survived even the attempt to
</p>
<p>poison him. " Why," asks Buchanan,^ '' did she thrust

</p>
<p>away from her the young Gentleman ... he being
</p>
<p>beautiful, near of her kin, of the Blood Royal and (that
</p>
<p>which is greatest), most entirely loving her."
</p>
<p>Again, both the ghost and Hamlet call attention to
</p>
<p>the fickleness of the queen. The ghost claims that he
</p>
<p>won her swiftly : he says his love
</p>
<p>" was of that dignity
</p>
<p>That it went hand in hand even with the vow
</p>
<p>I made to her in marriage."
</p>
<p>This, again, looks as if it were suggested by the rapid
</p>
<p>marriage of Mary and DarnJey after a brief acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance.
</p>
<p>Again, even before he has seen the ghost, Hamlet
</p>
<p>dwells on the fact that his mother used to show such
</p>
<p>an intense affection for his father; but forgot him so
</p>
<p>soon and declined upon one whose gifts were so far
</p>
<p>inferior.
</p>
<p>" Heaven and earth !
</p>
<p>Must I remember ? why, she would hang on him,
</p>
<p>As if increase of appetite had grown
</p>
<p>By what it fed on : and yet, with a month 
</p>
<p>. . . married with my uncle,
</p>
<p>My father's brother, but no more like my father
</p>
<p>Than I to Hercules . . .
</p>
<p>O most wicked speed, to post,
</p>
<p>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets." ^
</p>
<p>Now, this is precisely one of Buchanan's chief indict-
</p>
<p>ments against Mary, that she so vehemently loved her
</p>
<p>first husband, but so rapidly forgot him and married the
</p>
<p>second who was so immeasurably his inferior in person
</p>
<p>and charm.

<p>1 Act I., ii.
</p>
<p>58 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>These are some of the most apposite passages :
</p>
<p>" What if I ask again why she so extremely loved the young
</p>
<p>Man ? why she so hastily married him and so unmeasur-
</p>
<p>able honoured him ? Such are the natures of some
</p>
<p>women.
</p>
<p>"That husband therefore whom she lately wedded . . .
</p>
<p>without whom she could not endure, whom she scarcely
</p>
<p>durst suffer out of her sight, him she thrust forth."
</p>
<p>"... that adulterous partner, neither in birth nor in
</p>
<p>beauty nor in any honest quality was in any wise comparable
</p>
<p>with her disdained husband."
</p>
<p>" Bothwell was an Ape in purple."
</p>
<p>" Neither is the cause unknown why she did it. Even
</p>
<p>that the same filthy marriage with Bothwell might be
</p>
<p>accomplished."
</p>
<p>" One is divorced, another is coupled, and that in such
</p>
<p>posting speed, as they might have scant have hasted to
</p>
<p>furnish any triumph of some noble victory," ^
</p>
<p>Here, again, we have phrases which closely resemble
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's " posting to incestuous sheets."
</p>
<p>Both Hamlet and the ghost lay enormous stress on this
</p>
<p>indecent haste, and on the contrast between the two
</p>
<p>husbands :
</p>
<p>" A little month, or ere those shoes were old
</p>
<p>With which she follow'd my poor father's body.
</p>
<p>Like Niobe, all tears :  why she, even she, 
</p>
<p>O God ! a beast that wants discourse of reason
</p>
<p>Would have mourned longer . . .
</p>
<p>within a month
</p>
<p>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
</p>
<p>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes."
</p>
<p>We may observe also that this hasty marriage was
</p>
<p>held from the beginning to affect closely James himself.

<p>Hamlet and the Darnley Murder 59
</p>
<p>Burton quotes from the memoirs of Sir James Melville :
</p>
<p>" every good subject that loved the queen's honour and
</p>
<p>the prince's security had sad hearts and thought her majesty
</p>
<p>would be dishonoured and the prince in danger to be cut off
</p>
<p>by him who had slain his father."
</p>
<p>Now here, again, we have the atmosphere of Hamlet :
</p>
<p>the queen's disgraceful haste, the secrecy and suspicion and
</p>
<p>the peril of her son.
</p>
<p>Buchanan says ^ :
</p>
<p>" When of the forty days appointed for the mourning, scarce
</p>
<p>twelve were yet fully past . . . taking heart of grace unto
</p>
<p>her, and neglecting such trifles, she cometh to her own bias,
</p>
<p>and openly sheweth her own natural conditions."
</p>
<p>Buchanan dwells on the fact that before the marriage,
</p>
<p>Bothwell was accused of having committed fornication
</p>
<p>with his wife's own kinswoman . . . and the divorce
</p>
<p>with Lady Jane Bothwell was " posted forward."
</p>
<p>" And so at length within the eight days (from the time of
</p>
<p>the divorce commenced), she finished that unmatrimonial
</p>
<p>matriijiony, all good men so far detesting or at least grudgingly
</p>
<p>forejudging the unlucky end thereof.
</p>
<p>"... but Monsieur de Croce though he was earnestly desired
</p>
<p>could not with his honour be present at the feast."
</p>
<p>Buchanan makes out Bothwell to be a kind of specialist
</p>
<p>in adultery : " Bothwell had then alive two wives already,
</p>
<p>not yet divorced and the third neither lawfully married
</p>
<p>nor orderly divorced."
</p>
<p>" The deed," says Buchanan, " of itself is odious in a
</p>
<p>woman, it is monstrous in a wife, not only excessively loved
</p>
<p>but also most zealously honoured, it is incredible. And

</p>
<p>being committed against him . . . whose affection requires
</p>
<p>love . . . upon that young man in whom there is not so
</p>
<p>much as alleged any just cause of offence."
</p>
<p>Here, again, we may remember what Hamlet says of
</p>
<p>his father's affection for his mother :
</p>
<p>" he might not beteem the winds of heaven
</p>
<p>Visit her face too roughly."
</p>
<p>Throughout Shakespeare's drama enormous stress is
</p>
<p>laid on the difference in character and appearance between
</p>
<p>the two husbands. Now almost all the contemporary
</p>
<p>records stress this difference in the case of Damlcy and
</p>
<p>Bothwell.
</p>
<p>" He {i.e. Darnle^^) was a comel3' Prince of a fair and large
</p>
<p>stature of body, pleasant in countenance, affable to all men
</p>
<p>and devout, well-exercised in martial pastimes upon horse-
</p>
<p>back as any prince of that age." ^
</p>
<p>Compare Horatio's address to the ghost,-
</p>
<p>" What art thou that usurp 'st this time of night,
</p>
<p>Together with that fair and warlike form
</p>
<p>In which the majesty of buried Denmark
</p>
<p>Did sometimes march ? "
</p>
<p>And also the description of Marcellus :
</p>
<p>" With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch."
</p>
<p>In 1566 de Silva learned from Mauvissi^re that he
</p>
<p>(Darnley) mostly passed his time in warlike exercises,
</p>
<p>and was a good horseman. Causin speaks of him as
</p>
<p>" being accomplished with all excellent endowments
</p>
<p>both of body and of mind," ^

</p>
<p>^ Quoted by Hay Fleming,
</p>
<p>Hamlet and the Darnley Murder 6t
</p>
<p>Knox's continiiator thus describes him : " He was of a
</p>
<p>comely stature and none was hke unto liim within this
</p>
<p>island."
</p>
<p>Buchanan says in Mi's Detection (of Mary): " Siie long
</p>
<p>beheld . . . with greedy eyes his dead corl)S(^ the
</p>
<p>goodliest corpse of any gentleman that ev(T lived in this
</p>
<p>ago."
</p>
<p>Compare this with Horatio's speech : ^
</p>
<p>" J saw him once ; he was a goodly king,"
</p>
<p>and Hamlet's reply :
</p>
<p>" He was ii, man, tala- liiui lor .i.ll in all,
</p>
<p>I shall not look npon his like, af^.i.in."
</p>
<p>Again we note as somewhat curious the immense stress
</p>
<p>that is laid upon the armour of the ghost ; it makes him
</p>
<p>more digniiied and more warlike. So, also, Darjiley
</p>
<p>liad a fancy for appearing in full armour which some;
</p>
<p>persons thought an aff (fetation, and which his enemies
</p>
<p>ridiculed ; thus in 1565 he appeared in full armour at
</p>
<p>Mary's side in their brief war against the Lords of the
</p>
<p>Congregation ; it was, in that age at any rate, a real
</p>
<p>peculiarity.
</p>
<p>Bothwell, on the other hand, is persistently described
</p>
<p>by Buchanan and others as a needy adventurer, given to
</p>
<p>vices of a low cast : drunkenness and licentiousness.
</p>
<p>Buchanan says :
</p>
<p>" What was there in him Both well that was of a woman
</p>
<p>of any honest countenance to be desired, was there any
</p>
<p>gilt of eloquence or grace of beauty or virtue of mynd. . . .

<p>Act I., ii.
</p>
<p>62 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>As for his eloquence we need not speak . . . they that
</p>
<p>have heard him are not ignorant of his rude utterance
</p>
<p>and blockishness ... his enemies face he never durst
</p>
<p>abide ... by a thief, a notable coward, he was deadly
</p>
<p>wounded and thrown to the ground. ... He was brought
</p>
<p>up in the Bishop of Murray's palace ... in drunkenness
</p>
<p>and whoredoms, among vile ministries of dissolute mis-
</p>
<p>order. . . . Bothwell was a man in extreme poverty, doubtful
</p>
<p>whether he were more vile or more wicked. ... As for
</p>
<p>excessive and immoderate use of lechery, he therein no less
</p>
<p>sought to be famous than other men do shun dishonour and
</p>
<p>infamy."
</p>
<p>We have thus in Bothwell exactly the same type of
</p>
<p>character as that depicted in Claudius : Hamlet alludes
</p>
<p>with emphatic disgust to the heavy drinking of the king,
</p>
<p>he dwells on his licentiousness and points the bitter
</p>
<p>contrast between Claudius and his brother, exactly as
</p>
<p>Buchanan points the contrast between the hideousness
</p>
<p>and licentiousness of Bothwell and the beauty and state-
</p>
<p>liness of Darnley (Acts IH.-IV.).
</p>
<p>" See, what a grace was seated on this brow ;
</p>
<p>Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself, . . .
</p>
<p>This was your husband. Look you now, what
</p>
<p>follows ;
</p>
<p>Here is your husband ; like a mildewed ear
</p>
<p>Blasting his wholesome brother. . . .
</p>
<p>Ha ! have you eyes ?
</p>
<p>You cannot call it love."
</p>
<p>So Buchanan insists that the passion of Mary for
</p>
<p>Bothwell cannot properly have been called love, but only
</p>
<p>that insensate rage of lust which sometimes seizes upon
</p>
<p>women and blinds them to all that is base in character

<p>Hamlet and the Darnley Murder 63
</p>
<p>Hamlet accuses Claudius ^ of exactly the vices condemned
</p>
<p>in Bothwell : he speaks of killing him
</p>
<p>" When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage
</p>
<p>Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed,
</p>
<p>At gaming, swearing or about some act
</p>
<p>That has no relish of salvation in't."
</p>
<p>His drunkenness, of course, and its corrupting effect
</p>
<p>on the court is insisted on from the very beginning 2 :
</p>
<p>Hamlet says to Horatio :
</p>
<p>" what is your affair in Elsinore ?
</p>
<p>We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart."
</p>
<p>Bothwell's enemies had accused him of practising art
</p>
<p>magic, and both Mary's friends and enemies, including
</p>
<p>the hostile lords in their proclamations, averred that
</p>
<p>Bothw.ll had won her favour by unlawful means, philtres,
</p>
<p>witchcraft, or what we may call hypnotism.
</p>
<p>Shakespeare does not represent Hamlet as accusing
</p>
<p>Claudius of the Black Art, but he may be referring to
</p>
<p>these accusations when he makes the ghost accuse him
</p>
<p>of seducing the queen " with witchcraft of his wicked
</p>
<p>wit."
</p>
<p>I have already pointed out,^ that in Hamlet the
</p>
<p>ghost is a Cathohc, whereas his son is a Protestant,
</p>
<p>and this is another matter in which the play differs
</p>
<p>totally from the saga and corresponds closely with the
</p>
<p>history.

<p> Introduction. * Act I., ii.
</p>
<p>64 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>from Wittenberg, and Hamlet greets him as his " fellow-
</p>
<p>student " ; Hamlet also desires to return to Wittenberg,
</p>
<p>which Claudius does not wish to permit.
</p>
<p> " For your intent
</p>
<p>In going back to school in Wittenberg
</p>
<p>It is most retrograde to our desire." ^
</p>
<p>Nothing, of course, is said of any Wittenberg in the
</p>
<p>saga, and I am positive that any reader who cares to
</p>
<p>refer to Saxo Grammaticus will feel that the mention of
</p>
<p>any modern university would be singularly out of place
</p>
<p>in that barbarous production.
</p>
<p>But Wittenberg, on account of its association with
</p>
<p>Luther, was famous as one of the chief Protestant centres
</p>
<p>of Europe ; Scottish universities, as already pointed
</p>
<p>out, had in the sixteenth century a very close and intimate
</p>
<p>connection with German Protestant universities, and thus
</p>
<p>the mention of Wittenberg certainly suggests a Protestant
</p>
<p>connection for both Horatio and Hamlet.
</p>
<p>It is equally clear that the ghost is Catholic. He speaks
</p>
<p>of purgatory, and of himself as being condemned to its
</p>
<p>penalties 2 :
</p>
<p>" Doom'd for a certain time to, walk the night,
</p>
<p>And for the day confined to fast in fires,
</p>
<p>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
</p>
<p>Are burnt and purged away : "
</p>
<p>The ghost, be it noted, lays no claim to entire innocence
</p>
<p>of life ; he admits " foul crimes." In the whole cruel and
</p>
<p>bitter story of his murder the thing that grieves him

</p>
<p>most is that he had no opportunity for absolution and
</p>
<p>extreme unction.
</p>
<p>" Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
</p>
<p>Unhousel'd, disappointed, unaneled,
</p>
<p>No reckoning made, but sent to my account
</p>
<p>With all my imperfections on my head ;
</p>
<p>O horrible ! O horrible ! most horrible ! "
</p>
<p>Now here, again, we have an exact parallel with the
</p>
<p>history ; Darnley was a Catholic, he had committed
</p>
<p>" foul crimes," and he was cut off without the possibility
</p>
<p>of absolution and extreme unction. The son, James I.,
</p>
<p>was a Protestant and a very keen and eager student, a
</p>
<p>fact on which he greatly plumed himself, of Protestant
</p>
<p>theology.
</p>
<p>In the saga story there is, of course, no ghost. Its
</p>
<p>function would, indeed, be totally unnecessary as
</p>
<p>neither Amlcth nor anyone else has the least doubt
</p>
<p>as to the guilt of the king, who, as we have seen,
</p>
<p>acknowledged it.
</p>
<p>In the history, however, the guilt of the culprits certainly
</p>
<p>was doubtful ; Bothwell seized the supreme power ;
</p>
<p>he was not at first openly accused, but suspicions were
</p>
<p>rife against him. Burton says : " Those who dared not
</p>
<p>speak openly gave utterance in the dark, and midnight
</p>
<p>accusations were heard with mysterious awe. Sir William
</p>
<p>Drury tells Cecil of a man who went about crying :
</p>
<p>' Vengeance on those who . . . caused the shedding of
</p>
<p>innocent blood. O Lord ! open the heavens and pour
</p>
<p>down vengeance.' " ^

<p>E
</p>
<p>66 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Buchanan alludes to the same thing : people dared not
</p>
<p>openly accuse Bothwell of the offence,
</p>
<p>" specially as he himself was doer, judge, enquirer and
</p>
<p>examiner. Yet this fear which stopped the mouths of every
</p>
<p>man in particular could not restrain the multitude. Because
</p>
<p>both by books set out, by pictures and by cries in the dark
</p>
<p>night, it was so set out and handled that the doers of the
</p>
<p>mischievous fact might easily understand that those secrets
</p>
<p>of theirs were come abroad."
</p>
<p>Buchanan has also a curious tale of an apparition
</p>
<p>which came to the Earl of Athol and three of his
</p>
<p>friends on the night of the Darnley murder, wakened
</p>
<p>them out of their sleep, and apprised them of the crime.
</p>
<p>As we have also seen, there was a contemporary ballad
</p>
<p>which represented the ghost of Darnley as returning to
</p>
<p>tell his own pitiful tale.
</p>
<p>In the original prose story there was no voice crying
</p>
<p>out murder in the night and no apparition ; Shakespeare
</p>
<p>seems to have put them together, and dramatised them
</p>
<p>into the truly magnificent conception of the ghost of
</p>
<p>Hamlet's father.
</p>
<p>There was certainly a ghost in the earlier Hamlet
</p>
<p> the play ascribed to Kyd  but, as I have already
</p>
<p>remarked, we have no means of knowing whether Kyd
</p>
<p>was using historical sources or not.
</p>
<p>Other curious details in the ghost-scene are worthy of
</p>
<p>comment. Thus the ghost tells Hamlet that it is com-
</p>
<p>pelled to depart ; but, when Hamlet exacts the oath of
</p>
<p>silence from Horatio and the soldiers, the ghost reappears
</p>
<p>in the most extraordinary way he^ieath the ground, so that
</p>
<p>Hamlet refers to him as *' this fellow in the cellarage "

<p>and calls him " an old mole."
</p>
<p>Hamlet and the Darnley Murder 67
</p>
<p>Now it was the murder of Rizzio which steeled Mary's
</p>
<p>heart against her husband, and it was very generally
</p>
<p>believed that Mary took an oath to murder him over
</p>
<p>Rizzio's grave. The Lennox MSS. are the main authorities
</p>
<p>for this incident ; they aver that, when Darnley and
</p>
<p>Mary were escaping together through the vaults of
</p>
<p>Holyrood, Darnley paused and uttered remorseful words
</p>
<p>over Rizzio's new-made grave ; they aver that Mary,
</p>
<p>seeing the grave, said " it should go very hard with her
</p>
<p>but a fatter than Rizzio should lie anear him ere one
</p>
<p>twelvemonth was at an end." Moreover, on the evening
</p>
<p>preceding Darnley's death, Mary is said to have reminded
</p>
<p>him of this very incident :
</p>
<p>" Rizzio," says Mr Andrew Lang, " was buried in the chapel
</p>
<p>vaults. In their escape Mary and Darnley passed by his
</p>
<p>grave ; she is said to have declared that ' ere a year he should
</p>
<p>have a fatter by his side ! ' On the evening preceding Darnley's
</p>
<p>death she reminded him that it was a year since Rizzio's
</p>
<p>murder." ^
</p>
<p>Martin Hume speaks of the pretended reconciliation
</p>
<p>of the husband and wife :
</p>
<p>" In the course of their loving talk Mary dropped a sinister
</p>
<p>hint that just a year had passed since Rizzio's murder ;
</p>
<p>and, when she had gone, Darnley in the hearing of his pages,
</p>
<p>expressed his uneasiness that she had recollected it, for he at
</p>
<p>least had not forgotten her threat over Rizzio's grave." ^
</p>
<p>Buchanan ^ says :
</p>
<p>" One Sunday night she discovered herself, and fetching a
</p>
<p>deep sigh : ' O says she, this time twelve month was David
</p>
<p>' Mystery of Mary Stuart.

<p>Rizzio slain.' This it seems came from her heart ; for within
</p>
<p>a few days, the unfortunate young Man, as an Inferiae to
</p>
<p>the Ghost of a Fidler, was strangled in his Bed . . . and his
</p>
<p>Body thrown out into the garden"; and again "suddenly,
</p>
<p>without any Funeral Honour in the Night Time, by common
</p>
<p>Carriers of dead Bodies, upon a vile Bier, she caused him to
</p>
<p>be buried by David Rizzio."
</p>
<p>It was thus a definite belief of Shakespeare's age,
</p>
<p>as the quotations above clearly show, that the oath
</p>
<p>ensuring the murder of Darnley had been taken in
</p>
<p>the vaults of Holyrood over the grave of Rizzio, and
</p>
<p>that this oath was punctually and to the time
</p>
<p>fulfilled.
</p>
<p>Does it not look as if it were this that had suggested
</p>
<p>the scene when the ghost in his turn reminds Hamlet of
</p>
<p>his oath with the voice that comes from the " Cellarage."
</p>
<p>The whole incident was, to the last degree, gruesome and
</p>
<p>suggestive, and is it not most exceedingly plausible that
</p>
<p>a popular dramatist and a tragic dramatist would prefer
</p>
<p>to work upon the emotions that he knew to be existing
</p>
<p>in the minds of his audience ? This is why we cannot
</p>
<p>be assured that we understand Shakespeare fully unless
</p>
<p>we take into account the Elizabethan point of view, for
</p>
<p>the associations existing in their minds, and to which
</p>
<p>the dramatist would naturally appeal, do not exist in
</p>
<p>ours.
</p>
<p>Another resemblance to the Darnle}^ murder lies in the
</p>
<p>attitude of the queen who is always loyal to her second
</p>
<p>husband ; she will not leave him even for Hamlet's bitter
</p>
<p>rebukes, and she takes his part until the end.
</p>
<p>This, of course, was characteristic of Mary Queen of

<p>Scots, who could not be persuaded to renounce Bothwell.
</p>
<p>Hamlet and the Darnley Murder 69
</p>
<p>Throckmorton, in a letter to Elizabeth, July 1564,
</p>
<p>says :
</p>
<p>" The queen will not by any means be induced to lend her
</p>
<p>authority to prosecute the murder, nor will not consent by
</p>
<p>any persuasion to abandon the lord Bothwell for her husband,
</p>
<p>but avoweth constantly that she will live and die with him
</p>
<p>and sayeth that if it were put to her choice to relinquish her
</p>
<p>crown and kingdom for the lord Bothwell she would leave
</p>
<p>her kingdom and dignity to live as a simple damoiselle with
</p>
<p>him and that she will never consent that he shall fare worse
</p>
<p>or have more harm than herself."
</p>
<p>So Throckmorton says again to Elizabeth :
</p>
<p>" She will by no means yield to abandon Bothwell for her
</p>
<p>husband, nor rchnquish him ; which matter will do her most
</p>
<p>harm of all and hardneth these lords to great severity against
</p>
<p>her."
</p>
<p>So the Lords of Scotland communicate to Sir Nicholas
</p>
<p>Throckmorton, July 1567 :
</p>
<p>"We began to deal with her majesty, and to persuade her
</p>
<p>that, for her own honour, the safety of her son, the discharging
</p>
<p>of her conscience . . . she would be content to separate herself
</p>
<p>from that wicked man, to whom she was never lawfully joined,
</p>
<p>and with whom she could not remain without a manifest loss
</p>
<p>of honour . . . but all in vain."
</p>
<p>Throckmorton himself repeatedly states to Elizabeth
</p>
<p>that the Lords were willing to be lenient to Mary
</p>
<p>personally.
</p>
<p>" I have also persuaded herself to renounce Bothwell for her
</p>
<p>husband and to be contented to suffer a divorce to pass
</p>
<p>between them ; she hath sent me word that she will in no
</p>
<p>wise consent to it but will rather die."

</p>
<p>It is impossible not to see the likeness between this
</p>
<p>70 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>and Hamlet's expostulation with the queen,^ when he
</p>
<p>reproaches her with the dishonour she has brought upon
</p>
<p>herself, appeals to her conscience, and finally implores
</p>
<p>her to leave his uncle :
</p>
<p>" Good-night : but go not to mine uncle's bed ;
</p>
<p>. . . Refrain to-night,
</p>
<p>And that shall lend a kind of easiness
</p>
<p>To the next abstinence ; the next more easy."
</p>
<p>Once again there is no parallel whatever in the original
</p>
<p>prose source.
</p>
<p>One more curious detail may be added.
</p>
<p>Claudius, in Hamlet, is specially associated with three
</p>
<p>courtiers called respectively, Osric,^ Rosencrantz, and
</p>
<p>Guildenstern,^ and among the people who received the
</p>
<p>captured Both well in Denmark was a certain " Eric
</p>
<p>Rosencrantz." ^
</p>
<p>I have already pointed out that there was a Guildenstern
</p>
<p>at the court of Scotland.
</p>
<p>Before leaving, finally, the subject of the Darnley
</p>
<p>murder, it is important to remember that James I. and
</p>
<p>Bothwell were, from the outset, pitted against each other
</p>
<p>by their respective supporters. The prince, though only
</p>
<p>an infant, was legally represented as demanding vengeance
</p>
<p>for his murdered father, and Bothwell was very generally
</p>
<p>supposed to have designs upon his life.
</p>
<p>" Bothwell after his marriage to the queen," says Sir
</p>
<p>James Melville, "was very earnest to get the Prince in his
</p>
<p>hands but my Lord of Mar would not deliver him, praying
</p>
<p>me to help to save the Prince out of their hands who had

</p>
<p>CHAPTER III
</p>
<p>JAMES I. AND HAMLET
</p>
<p>And now I will turn to what has always been acknow-
</p>
<p>ledged as the crucial problem of the drama : the character
</p>
<p>of the hero himself, his melancholy and irresolution.
</p>
<p>The main problem of Hamlet always has been to determine
</p>
<p>why Hamlet does not act. He knows what he ought to
</p>
<p>do ; he himself realises it fully. .Why does he not com-
</p>
<p>plete his task ? Does he hesitate, as Goethe thinks,
</p>
<p>because of a fineness of nature too great for the coarseness
</p>
<p>of the task which is thrust upon him ? Does he hesitate,
</p>
<p>as he himself accuses himself, out of mere slothfulness ?
</p>
<p>Does he hesitate, as Coleridge suggests, because in him
</p>
<p>the powers of thought have so far outweighed the
</p>
<p>powers of action that he cannot act ? Does he hesitate
</p>
<p>because incipient insanity is sapping his intellect ? All
</p>
<p>these points of view have been advanced, have been
</p>
<p>discussed at length in volume after volume. Mr Brad-
</p>
<p>ley, in his Shakespearean Tragedy, has reviewed many
</p>
<p>of them with admirable cogency, and in Tlie Problem
</p>
<p>oj Hamlet Mr J. M. Robertson has shown that in
</p>
<p>his opinion the inconsistencies in the character of
</p>
<p>Hamlet cannot be really reconciled, which he explains
</p>
<p>by the fact that Shakespeare is working over material
</p>
<p>set for him by an early play.

<p>72
</p>
<p>James I. and Hamlet 73
</p>
<p>show how numerous these explanations are, and how
</p>
<p>very greatly they vary.
</p>
<p>My own suggestion would be that Hamlet was probably
</p>
<p>a great deal simpler for Shakespeare's audience to under-
</p>
<p>stand than it is for us ; they carried in all likelihood a
</p>
<p>commentary in their own minds which enabled them to
</p>
<p>comprehend it more easily than we can. Tolstoy has,
</p>
<p>in fact, accused Shakespeare of not being a great artist,-'-
</p>
<p>precisely because Hamlet is so difficult to understand ;
</p>
<p>now as Shakespeare was not only a great artist, but,
</p>
<p>also, as we know him to have been, a popular dramatist
</p>
<p>of intense appeal, the difficulty is probably one which
</p>
<p>exists mainly for later commentators and did not exist
</p>
<p>to the same extent for the original audience.
</p>
<p>My own explanation of the central theme of the play
</p>
<p>would be that Shakespeare was stating with unexampled
</p>
<p>force and cogency an historical problem which neither
</p>
<p>he nor any member of his audience possessed at that time
</p>
<p>the data for quite adequately solving. It is my purpose
</p>
<p>to show, however, that the problem was essentially
</p>
<p>historical and political. Let us first observe clearly one
</p>
<p>point ; there is not a hint or shadow of the main problem
</p>
<p>in the prose source.
</p>
<p>In Saxo Grammaticus and the Hystorie oj Hamblet
</p>
<p>alike the task before the hero is perfectly simple and
</p>
<p>the difficulties are all obvious and material. The hero
</p>
<p>desires to avenge his father's murder and he desires to
</p>
<p>gain for himself the crown which his uncle has usurped ;
</p>
<p>he pursues these aims with relentless determination and
</p>
<p>undeviating skill ; but, since he is isolated among enemies,

<p>74 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>he shams madness as a means of putting these enemies
</p>
<p>off the scent, and his madness takes the most grotesque
</p>
<p>and ridiculous form.
</p>
<p>Saxo says :
</p>
<p>" Every day he remained in his house utterly Hstless and
</p>
<p>unclean, flinging himself on the ground and bespattering his
</p>
<p>person with foul and filthy dirt. His discoloured face and
</p>
<p>visage smutched with slime denoted foolish and grotesque
</p>
<p>madness.
</p>
<p>"... He used at times to sit by the fire and rake the embers
</p>
<p>with his hands."
</p>
<p>The Hystorie 0} Hamblet is still more extravagant :
</p>
<p>" hee rent and tore his clothes, wallowing and lying in the
</p>
<p>dust and mire, his face all filthy and blacke, running through
</p>
<p>the streets like a man distraught, not speaking one word but
</p>
<p>such as seemed to proceed from madness and mere frenzy."
</p>
<p>We can see at once the enormous difference between
</p>
<p>this coarse and crude representation and the subtlety of
</p>
<p>Hamlet.
</p>
<p>Now let us compare the character of Hamlet carefully
</p>
<p>with what was, at that time, known of James I.
</p>
<p>There is, as already pointed out, the fact of education
</p>
<p>at a university specially associated with Protestant
</p>
<p>theology ; James himself was, of course, all his hfe
</p>
<p>famous as a Protestant theologian ; he took part in
</p>
<p>theological discussions, he presided at -"heological dis-
</p>
<p>cussions, and he showed marked ability in argument.
</p>
<p>Hamlet is the most philosophic and meditative of all
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's characters, and he shows a curious love of

</p>
<p>the darker side of nature.
</p>
<p>James I. and Hamlet 75
</p>
<p>Now James was the pupil of a distinguished scholar
</p>
<p> Buchanan ; he took all his life a great interest in
</p>
<p>philosophy, and he was, as his books show, especially
</p>
<p>fond of studying the darker side of nature.
</p>
<p>James was, in his early life at least, much isolated ;
</p>
<p>there was hardly anyone whom he really trusted except
</p>
<p>possibly Erskine of Mar, in whom he had immense con-
</p>
<p>fidence, and with whom he had been educated. So
</p>
<p>Shakespeare represents Hamlet as being lonely and
</p>
<p>isolated ; but as having one friend in whom he reposes
</p>
<p>perfect confidence and absolute trust  that one friend
</p>
<p>being his fellow-student  Horatio.
</p>
<p>This second Earl of Mar was the son of the first Earl
</p>
<p>who had rescued James in his infancy from the hands
</p>
<p>of Bothwell as recounted above ; this second Earl having
</p>
<p>been James' own fellow-student, it was to him that
</p>
<p>he entrusted the education of Prince Henry. We may
</p>
<p>also observe that Mar was in England at the time Hamlet
</p>
<p>was written ; he had been sent by James to confer with
</p>
<p>Essex ; when he arrived, however, he found that Essex
</p>
<p>had already been executed, and he chose his own line of
</p>
<p>action, his aim being to get his master's right to the
</p>
<p>succession estabhshed ; Elizabeth is said to have given
</p>
<p>him the promise he required.
</p>
<p>On March 25th, Tobie Matthew writes to Dudley
</p>
<p>Carleton :
</p>
<p>" The Earl of Mar is here, as ambassador out of Scotland,
</p>
<p>to congratulate the queen's deliverance, to desire that his
</p>
<p>master may be declared successor, and to act, as is conjectured,
</p>
<p>some greater business which is Hkely enough, for he is a man

</p>
<p>of extraordinary courage and place."
</p>
<p>76 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Now, when we remember that Mar was actually in
</p>
<p>England at the time Hamlet was composed, and that
</p>
<p>Shakespeare had ever}^ reason for furthering his mission,
</p>
<p>it does look as if he might have given hints for Horatio 
</p>
<p>the trusted friend and fellow-student.
</p>
<p>The most peculiar trait in Hamlet's character is his
</p>
<p>vacillation. He knows how he ought to act, yet he
</p>
<p>hesitates whenever action is necessary ; on the other
</p>
<p>hand, he has plenty of nerve in important crises ; when
</p>
<p>a crisis arrives he can act, and often does act, with quite
</p>
<p>exceptional strength and vigour.
</p>
<p>Professor Bradley analyses at some length this extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary contradiction ; he does not find Hamlet
</p>
<p>essentially the meditative, irresolute person whom
</p>
<p>Coleridge and Schlegel believe him to be ; he finds that
</p>
<p>he has a capacity for strong and vigorous action which
</p>
<p>is, however, lamed by his melancholy :
</p>
<p>" This state accounts for Hamlet's energy as well as for his
</p>
<p>lassitude, these quick decided actions of his being the out-
</p>
<p>come of a nature normally far from passive, now suddenly
</p>
<p>stimulated and producing healthy impulses which work
</p>
<p>themselves out before they have time to subside."
</p>
<p>Examples of this sudden vigorous action are, of course,
</p>
<p>Hamlet's behaviour in the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
</p>
<p>affair, also his conduct at the end of the play, etc., etc.
</p>
<p>Now, this curious baflling character, this hesitancy
</p>
<p>and delay combined with sudden vigour in emergencies,
</p>
<p>is just precisely the character of James L as it appeared
</p>
<p>to his contemporaries.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the best evidence on this point can be found

<p>in the correspondence of Elizabeth and James. We
</p>
<p>James I. a,ud Hamlet ']']
</p>
<p>there find Elizabeth, in letter after letter, taking almost
</p>
<p>precisely this view of James' character ; she advises him
</p>
<p>to be stern and to punish where punishment is due ; it
</p>
<p>is not, she declares, that she herself loves bloodshed or
</p>
<p>revenge ; but it is a monarch's duty both to himself
</p>
<p>and to his kingdom that he should punish rebelUous
</p>
<p>subjects. She warns James that the younger Both well
</p>
<p>(the nephew of his mother's husband), has repeatedly
</p>
<p>plotted against his life; he knows that Bothwell has so
</p>
<p>conspired ; he knows that his Hfe is endangered.
</p>
<p>Why does he not take adequate means to defend himself
</p>
<p>and his kingdom ? His delay is not so much mercy as
</p>
<p>slothfulness and sheer weakness of will. It is unkingly.
</p>
<p>He talks, but achieves nothing.
</p>
<p>Let me quote some highly significant examples :
</p>
<p>" If with my eyes I had not viewed these treasons I should
</p>
<p>be ashamed to write them you. And shall I tell you my
</p>
<p>thought herein ? I assure you, you are well worthy of such
</p>
<p>traitors, that, when you knew them and had them, you
</p>
<p>betrayed your own safety in favouring their lives. Good
</p>
<p>Lord ! who but yourself would have left such people to be
</p>
<p>able to do you wrong ? Give order with speed, that such
</p>
<p>scape not your correction." ^
</p>
<p>We may compare this with Hamlet's bitter self-
</p>
<p>reproaches : 2
</p>
<p>"I . . .
</p>
<p>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak.
</p>
<p>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
</p>

</p>
<p>it cannot be

<p>But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall

</p>
<p>Let us keep in mind all the time that there is not one
</p>
<p>word of this reproach or hesitation in Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>source. The hero of the saga story pits himself as
</p>
<p>directly as possible against the king ; he is delayed by
</p>
<p>external circumstances solely, never by his own fault ;
</p>
<p>indeed, the whole point of the tale lies in the courage
</p>
<p>and decision of the prince who pursues his plan with
</p>
<p>undeviating resolution in the midst of the most difficult
</p>
<p>circumstances, and we have no reason to assume any
</p>
<p>difference in the Hamlet of Kyd's play.
</p>
<p>Again let us quote Ehzabeth ^ :
</p>
<p>" I hope you will not be careless of such practises as hath
</p>
<p>passed from any of yours without your commission, specially
</p>
<p>such attempts as might ruin your realm and danger you.
</p>
<p>If any respect whatever make you neglect so expedient a
</p>
<p>work, I am afraid your careless hide will work your unlooked
</p>
<p>danger."
</p>
<p>Place this beside Hamlet ^ :
</p>
<p>" How all occasions do inform against me,
</p>
<p>And spur my dull revenge ! What is a man,
</p>
<p>If his chief good and market of his time
</p>

<p>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple

<p>Of thinking too precisely on the event, 
</p>
<p>A thought which, quarter'd, hath one part wisdom
</p>
<p>And ever three parts coward, I do not know

<p>Why yet I live to say ! ' This thing's to do, '
</p>
<p>Sith I have cause and will and strength and means

<p>To do't."

<p>1 Letter XXXV. 2 ^ct IV., iv.
</p>
<p>James I. and Hamlet 79
</p>
<p>Hamlet, in fact, is as candid with himself as Elizabeth
</p>
<p>is with James ; the mental malady which they are
</p>
<p>analysing appears to be of exactly the same type. The
</p>
<p>main outlines of James' character, as shown by his actions,
</p>
<p>were, of course, known to every one who followed public
</p>
<p>affairs ; Shakespeare was certainly no less keen a student
</p>
<p>of character than Elizabeth and the analysis which
</p>
<p>would be possible to her would be equally possible to
</p>
<p>the poet.
</p>
<p>Again we quote Elizabeth. The occasion of the next
</p>
<p>letter is described as follows by Mr Tytler :
</p>
<p>" Attacking the palace of Holyrood at the head of his
</p>
<p>desperate followers Bothwell had nearly surprised and made
</p>
<p>prisoners both the king and his chancellor. . . . An alarm
</p>
<p>was given, the king took refuge in one of the turrets, the
</p>
<p>chancellor barricaded his room and bravely beat off his
</p>
<p>assailants ; whilst the citizens of Edinburgh, headed by their
</p>
<p>provost, rushed into the outer court of the palace, and,
</p>
<p>cutting their way through the outer ranks of the borderers,
</p>
<p>compelled Bothwell to precipitate flight."
</p>
<p>Elizabeth's letter runs :
</p>
<p>" My dear brother. Though the hearing of your most
</p>
<p>dangerous peril be that thing that I most reverently render
</p>
<p>my most lowly thanks to God that you, by his mighty hand,
</p>
<p>hath scaped yet hath it been no other hazard than such as
</p>
<p>both hath been foreseen and foretold. ... I know not
</p>
<p>what to write, so little do I like to lose labour in vain ; for
</p>
<p>if I saw counsel avail or aught pursued in due time or season,
</p>
<p>I should think my time fortunately spent to make you reap
</p>
<p>the due fruit of ripe opportunity ; but I see you have no
</p>
<p>look to help your state nor to assure you from treason's
</p>
<p>leisure. You give too much respite to rid your harm or
</p>
<p>shorten other's haste. Well : I will pray for you that God

</p>
<p>will unseal your eyes that have too long been shut."
</p>
<p>8o Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Here, again, we have a situation very closely parallel
</p>
<p>to the one in Hamlet, and all these letters are connected,
</p>
<p>be it noted, with the younger Bothwell.
</p>
<p>The younger Bothwell had been practising against
</p>
<p>the life and liberty of James almost exactly as Claudius
</p>
<p>practised against the life of Hamlet ; but the most open
</p>
<p>practices, the most manifest insults, cannot sting James
</p>
<p>into action. Elizabeth is filled with wonder and horror
</p>
<p>that a monarch can submit to such insults.
</p>
<p>So Hamlet accuses himself of submission to insult : ^
</p>
<p>" Am I a coward ?
</p>
<p>Who calls me villain ? Breaks my pate across ?
</p>
<p>Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face ?
</p>
<p>Tweaks me by the nose ? gives me the lie i' the throat,
</p>
<p>As deep as to the lungs ? who does me this ?
</p>
<p>Ha!
</p>
<p>'Swoimds I should take it."
</p>
<p>After the conspiracy known as the "Spanish Blanks"
</p>
<p>Elizabeth writes to James :
</p>
<p>" If you do not rake it to the bottom, you will verify what
</p>
<p>many a wise man hath (viewing your proceedings) judged of
</p>
<p>your guiltiness of your own wrack. . . .
</p>
<p>" I have beheld of late, a strange dishonourable and
</p>
<p>dangerous pardon which, if it be true, j^ou have not only
</p>
<p>neglected yourself but wronged me ! "
</p>
<p>Another letter of vehement expostulation seems to
</p>
<p>belong to the year 1592 when James had been literally
</p>
<p>driven from place to place by the factious Bothwell 2 :
</p>
<p>" To redouble crimes so oft, I say, with your pardon, must

<p>1 Act II., ii. a Letter XLIV.
</p>
<p>James I. and Hamlet 8i
</p>
<p>first had received the condign reward ; for slacking of due
</p>
<p>correction engenders the bold minds for new crimes, ... I
</p>
<p>hear of so uncouth a way taken by some of your conventions,
</p>
<p>yea agreed to by your selfe that I must wonder how you will
</p>
<p>be clerk to such lessons.
</p>
<p>" . . . O Lord, what strange dreams hear I that would
</p>
<p>God they were so, for then at my waking I should find them
</p>
<p>fables. If you mean, therefore, to reign I exhort you to
</p>
<p>show yourself worthy of the place which never can be surely
</p>
<p>settled without a steady course held to make you loved and
</p>
<p>feared. I assure myself many have escaped your hands
</p>
<p>more for dread of your remissness than for love of the escaped ;
</p>
<p>so oft they see you cherishing some men for open crimes and
</p>
<p>so they mistrust more their revenge than your assurance. . . .
</p>
<p>And since it so likes your to demand my counsel, I find so
</p>
<p>many ways your state so unjoynted, that it needs a skilfuUer
</p>
<p>bone-setter than I to joyne each part in its right place."
</p>
<p>One may compare this with Hamlet's bitter cry ^ :
</p>
<p>" The time is out of joint : O cursed spite
</p>
<p>That ever I was born to set it right."
</p>
<p>In exactly the same way as Elizabeth piles up the
</p>
<p>indignities James has suffered, so Hamlet piles up those
</p>
<p>he endures himself ^ :
</p>
<p>" How stand I then,
</p>
<p>That have a father kill'd, a mother stain 'd.
</p>
<p>Excitements of my reason and my blood,
</p>
<p>And let all sleep ? while to my shame I see
</p>
<p>The imminent death of twenty thousand men.
</p>
<p>That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
</p>
<p>Go to their graves like beds."
</p>
<p>In another letter Elizabeth points out to him how his
</p>
<p>laxness has caused corruption in the whole state :
</p>
<p>"A long-rooted malady, falling to many relapses, argues,

</p>
<p>by reason that the body is so corrupt that it may never be
</p>
<p>sound. When great infections Ught on many it almost
</p>
<p>poisons the whole country." ^
</p>
<p>Compare this with Hamlet :
</p>
<p>" How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable
</p>
<p>Seem to me all the uses of this world !
</p>
<p>Fie on't ! ah fie ! 'tis an unweeded garden.
</p>
<p>That grows to seed ; things rank and gross in nature
</p>
<p>Possess it merely." ^
</p>
<p>Again Elizabeth says :
</p>
<p>" If the variableness of Scotch affairs had not inured me
</p>
<p>with too old a custom I should never leave wondering at
</p>
<p>such strange and uncouth actions ; but I have so oft with
</p>
<p>careful eyes foreseen the evil-coming harms and . . . see
</p>
<p>them either not beheved or not redressed that I grow weary
</p>
<p>of such fruitless labour. One while I receive a writ of oblivion
</p>
<p>and foregiveness, then a revocation, with new additions of
</p>
<p>later consideration ; sometimes, some you call traitors with
</p>
<p>proclaim, and anon, there must be no proof allowed, though
</p>
<p>never so apparent, against them."
</p>
<p>Here, again, we have the likeness to Hamlet. Hamlet
</p>
<p>has proof after proof of the king's guilt, yet always
</p>
<p>demands more and more and is never, apparently,
</p>
<p>satisfied.
</p>
<p>"What thank may they give your mercy," EUzabeth con-
</p>
<p>tinues, " when no crime is tried ? . . . And for Bothwell,
</p>
<p>Jesus ! Did ever any muse more than I, that you could so
</p>
<p>quietly put up so temerous, indigne, a fact, and yet by your
</p>
<p>hand receiving assurance that all was pardoned and finished,
</p>
<p>I refer me to my own letter what doom I gave thereof. And

<p>^ Quoted from Tytler, Answer LIII.
</p>
<p>James I. raid Hamlet 83
</p>
<p>Yet again (1593), James pardons Bothwell, and
</p>
<p>Elizabeth replies in the height of impatience and anger :
</p>
<p>" My Dear Brother  To sec so much, I rue my sight, that
</p>
<p>views the evident spectacle of a seduced king, abusing council
</p>
<p>and wry-guided kingdom. . . .
</p>
<p>" I doubt whether shame or sorrow have had the upper hand
</p>
<p>when I read your last lines to me. . . . Abuse not yourself
</p>
<p>so far. . . . Assure yourself no greater peril can ever befall
</p>
<p>you, nor any king else, than to take for payment evil accounts ;
</p>
<p>for they deride such and make their prey of your neglect.
</p>
<p>There is no prince alive, but if he show fear or yielding but
</p>
<p>he shall have tutors enough though he be out of minority.
</p>
<p>And when I remember what sore punishment these lewd
</p>
<p>traitors should have, then I read again, lest at first I mistook
</p>
<p>your mind ; but when the reviewing granted my lecture true,
</p>
<p>IvOrd ! what wonder grew in me, that you should correct
</p>
<p>them with benefits who deserve much severer correction. . . .
</p>
<p>Is it possible that you can swallow the taste of so bitter a
</p>
<p>drug more meet to purge you of them, than worthy of your
</p>
<p>kindly acceptance.
</p>
<p>" I never heard a more deriding scorn."
</p>
<p>Here, again, Elizabeth wonders at the disgraces and
</p>
<p>scorns to which James will submit just precisely as
</p>
<p>Hamlet wonders why he submits to such infamies and
</p>
<p>shames.
</p>
<p>Does it not look as if the mental malady in the two
</p>
<p>were identical ? Elizabeth and Shakespeare were both
</p>
<p>people of genius and they were analysing one and the
</p>
<p>same case.
</p>
<p>We may quote here an incident, no doubt among
</p>
<p>those alluded to by the queen, which seems to have an
</p>
<p>important bearing on Hamlet :
</p>
<p>" On 2ist July sentence of forfeiture was passed against

</p>
<p>hira (Bothwell) by parliament, all his property being con-
</p>
<p>84 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>fiscated, and his arms riven at the cross of Edinburgh. His
</p>
<p>friends thereupon determined to make a special effort upon
</p>
<p>his behalf. The Duke of Lennox and other noblemen secretly
</p>
<p>sympathised with him, on account of their jealousy of Maitland.
</p>
<p>On the evening of the 24th, after assembling their retainers
</p>
<p>in the neighbourhood of the palace, Bothwell in disguise was
</p>
<p>introduced into the king's chamber during his temporary
</p>
<p>absence. On returning, the king found Bothwell on his
</p>
<p>knees, with his drawn sword laid before him crying with a
</p>
<p>loud voice for pardon and mercy.
</p>
<p>" The king called out ' Treason ' ; the citizens of Edinburgh
</p>
<p>hurried in battle array into the inner court ; but the king,
</p>
<p>pacified by the assurances of those in attendance on him,
</p>
<p>commanded them to retire. Bothwell persisted that he
</p>
<p>did not come in * any manner of hostility, but in plain
</p>
<p>simplicity.'
</p>
<p>" To remove the king's manifest terror he offered to depart
</p>
<p>immediately and remain in banishment, or in any other part
</p>
<p>of the country till his day of trial.
</p>
<p>" The king permitted him to leave and an act of condonation
</p>
<p>and remission was passed in his favour but . . . the king
</p>
<p>remained ' in perpetual grief of mind,' affirming that he
</p>
<p>was virtually the captive of Bothwell and the other noblemen
</p>
<p>who had abetted him. . . .
</p>
<p>" On 14th August, he signed an agreement binding himself
</p>
<p>to pardon Bothwell and his adherents, and to restore them to
</p>
<p>their estates and honours, the agreement to be ratified by a
</p>
<p>parliament to be held in the following November ; but at a
</p>
<p>convention held at Stirling on 8tli September an attempt

<p>was made to modify the bargain, it being set forth as a con-

<p>the old unsatisfactory condition." ^

<p>to one of the most curious scenes in Hamlet. James has
</p>
<p>suffered all kinds of outrages and indignities from the
</p>
<p>1 Diet. Nat. Biog.
</p>
<p>James I. and Hamlet 85
</p>
<p>younger Bothwell who has plotted against his life ; at last
</p>
<p>he has Bothwell on his knees before him, and apparently
</p>
<p>at his mercy ; Bothwell implores pardon and James
</p>
<p>hears the prayer and spares him ; but he does not and
</p>
<p>cannot alter their real relations which, soon after, assume
</p>
<p>the same unsatisfactory character.
</p>
<p>So Hamlet finds Claudius upon his knees, at prayer
</p>
<p>and defenceless ; he has Claudius at his mercy and could
</p>
<p>destroy him ; he spares him for the time, making the
</p>
<p>excuse that he does not want to send his soul to heaven ;
</p>
<p>all the same he knows that Claudius plots against his
</p>
<p>life, and that he is practically helpless in his toils ; in no
</p>
<p>real sense are their relations altered.
</p>
<p>In 1595 Bothwell's position became desperate :
</p>
<p>" His association with the Catholic carls proved fatal.
</p>
<p>The king demanded his excommunication by the kirk and
</p>
<p>although Bothwell wrote to the clergy of Edinburgh offering
</p>
<p>to receive their correction for whatever offence he had com-
</p>
<p>mitted he was on iSth February excommunicated by the
</p>
<p>presbytery of Edinburgh at the king's command."
</p>
<p>It looks very much as if this incident had suggested
</p>
<p>Hamlet's determination to spare Claudius until he had
</p>
<p>achieved his religious ruin, until he finds him about some
</p>
<p>act " that has no relish of salvation in't " ; this incident
</p>
<p>has startled many of Shakespeare's commentators who
</p>
<p>cannot believe that Hamlet is stating his motive correctly
</p>
<p>because it would be " too horrible " ; but if Shake-
</p>
<p>speare is simply dramatising history, then all we can
</p>
<p>say is that the parallel is remarkably complete. James
</p>
<p>did find Bothwell on his knees and at his mercy ; he did

</p>
<p>spare him, and he spared him until the time when
</p>
<p>86 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Bothwell, at the king's request, was excommunicated
</p>
<p>and his rehgious ruin achieved.
</p>
<p>There is no trace of such an incident either in Saxo
</p>
<p>Grammaticus or in the Hystorie oj Hamhlet.
</p>
<p>Bothwell, one may note, had very often professed
</p>
<p>friendship towards the king, and had declared it im-
</p>
<p>possible to hate " where both benefits and blood compelled
</p>
<p>him to love." ^
</p>
<p>One may compare this with the bitter irony of Hamlet's :
</p>
<p>" A little more than kin and less than kind."
</p>
<p>Elizabeth, as we have seen from the letters already
</p>
<p>quoted, was continually pointing out to James that he
</p>
<p>did not do his duty by his kingdom; the younger
</p>
<p>Bothwell provided the most conspicuous example of
</p>
<p>this neglect, but there were many other instances. The
</p>
<p>final result is that James' realm goes from bad to worse.
</p>
<p>" Weeds in the fields, if they be suffered, will quickly over-
</p>
<p>grow the corn, but subjects being dandled, will make their
</p>
<p>own reigns and forlet another reign." -
</p>
<p>Compare this once again with Hamlet's cry :
</p>
<p>" How weary, stale, Hat and unprofitable
</p>
<p>Seem to me all the uses of this world !
</p>
<p>Fie on't : ah fie ! 'tis an unweeded garden.
</p>
<p>Grown to seed ; things rank and gross in nature
</p>
<p>Possess it merely."
</p>
<p>The resemblances between the situation dramatised
</p>
<p>in Hamlet and the situation revealed in the letters of
</p>
<p>Elizabeth arc so close that we might almost believe that
</p>
<p>Shakespeare had been leaning over the queen's shoulder
</p>
<p>while she wrote.

<p> Diet. Nat. Biog. 2 Letter LVII.
</p>
<p>James I. and Hamlet 87
</p>
<p>Surely the most obvious explanation of such coin-
</p>
<p>cidences is that they were analysing the same curious
</p>
<p>mentahty.
</p>
<p>In this connection I may refer to Mr Bradley, who
</p>
<p>points out that there is undoubtedly a large element of
</p>
<p>lethargy in the character of Hamlet :
</p>
<p>" We are bound to consider the evidence which the text
</p>
<p>supplies of this, though it is usual to ignore it. When
</p>
<p>Hamlet mentions, as one possible cause of his inaction, his
</p>
<p>' thinking too precisely on the event,' he mentions another
</p>
<p>' bestial oblivion,' and the thing against which he inveighs in
</p>
<p>the greater part of that soliloquy (IV., iv.) is not the excess
</p>
<p>and misuse of reason (which for him here and always is god-
</p>
<p>Uke) ; but his bestial oblivion or dullness, this letting all
</p>
<p>sleep, this allowing of heaven-sent reason to ' fust unused.'
</p>
<p>' What is a man.
</p>
<p>If his chief good and market of his time,
</p>
<p>Be but to sleep and feed ? a beast, no more.'
</p>
<p>" So, in the soliloquy (II., ii.) he accuses himself of being ' a
</p>
<p>dull and muddy-mettled rascal ' who ' peaks like John-a-
</p>
<p>dreams unpregnant of his cause,' dully indifferent to his
</p>
<p>cause. So, when the Ghost appears to him the second time,
</p>
<p>he accuses himself of being tardy and lapsed in time ; and
</p>
<p>the Ghost speaks of his purpose as being almost blunted and
</p>
<p>bids him not to forget." ^
</p>
<p>On the ordinary supposition that Hamlet is simply
</p>
<p>a psychological problem which happened to interest
</p>
<p>Shakespeare at the time, it has always been somewhat
</p>
<p>difficult to comprehend how the play could appeal to great
</p>
<p>popular audiences in the way it undoubtedly did, for it
</p>
<p>was one of the most frequently acted of all Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>tragedies.

<p>^ Shakespearean Tragedy.
</p>
<p>88 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Revenge tragedies were common, but they were, as
</p>
<p>a rule, sufficiently simple in their appeal. Now Mr
</p>
<p>Robertson divines, in Kyd's original Hamlet, almost
</p>
<p>exactly such a tragedy where the stress was laid, as it
</p>
<p>is in Saxo and in the Hystorie oj Hamhlet, mainly upon
</p>
<p>the motive of revenge.
</p>
<p>But the problem dramatised in Hamlet is one of
</p>
<p>singular subtlety and complexity ; it is the problem
</p>
<p>of a man who sees what he ought to do, and yet cannot
</p>
<p>do it ; who permits people to heap upon him outrage
</p>
<p>after outrage, insult upon insult, and yet does not punish
</p>
<p>even when he has the offender in his power ; it is the
</p>
<p>problem of one who is ready to give the benefit of every
</p>
<p>doubt, who cannot believe even in reiterated evidences
</p>
<p>of crime and who, even when he is convinced, still goes
</p>
<p>on pardoning.
</p>
<p>Is the incapacity for action due to the fineness of a
</p>
<p>too refined nature in its conflict with a coarse world ? Is
</p>
<p>it mere sloth and cowardice and a want of princely, nay,
</p>
<p>of human dignity ? Certainly Hamlet does not spare
</p>
<p>himself.
</p>
<p>Whatever the solution of the problem may be, there
</p>
<p>is no doubt that the problem itself is the central interest
</p>
<p>of Shakespeare's play, and that there is not a trace of
</p>
<p>it in the original story. In the Amleth Saga the hero
</p>
<p>has to employ devious methods to attain his purpose ;
</p>
<p>but in the purpose itself he never falters or wavers, and
</p>
<p>we have no reason to imagine that the hero of Kyd's
</p>
<p>play differed greatl}^ To make the incapacity for action
</p>
<p>the very centre of a tragedy was a startling innovation,

</p>
<p>and a most curious and subtle problem to bring before
</p>
<p>James I, and Hamlet 89
</p>
<p>a popular audience. But, if the problem were really
</p>
<p>historical, if the problem concerned the character of
</p>
<p>the man whose succession to the crown was just then the
</p>
<p>chief question of practical politics, if the problem con-
</p>
<p>cerned the character of their own future monarch upon
</p>
<p>whom all the destiny of England, the destiny of each
</p>
<p>member of the audience, essentially depended, we can
</p>
<p>understand at once why Shakespeare selected a subject
</p>
<p>so unusual, and why it so greatly fascinated both his
</p>
<p>audience and himself.
</p>
<p>At any rate, one thing is certain. Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>central problem does not, so far as we know, exist in
</p>
<p>any of his so-called sources ; it does exist in the history
</p>
<p> unmistakeable, definite and clear ; moreover, it was
</p>
<p>the precise historical problem which, at the exact
</p>
<p>moment Hamlet was written, was likely to interest
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's audience most.
</p>
<p>It may, of course, be only coincidence ; but this seems
</p>
<p>to me very improbable ; a great dramatist is not a person
</p>
<p>working in a void, independent of time and space ;
</p>
<p>every great dramatist has to deal with two materials :
</p>
<p>one is the stuff or substance of his own dramatic genius,
</p>
<p>the other is the mentality of his audience.
</p>
<p>It is and must be a main part of dramatic genius to
</p>
<p>utilise the susceptibilities and interests of the audience
</p>
<p>in the fullest way possible.
</p>
<p>Now, suppose that Shakespeare really desires to do
</p>
<p>this. His audience, just at that moment, are probably
</p>
<p>more interested in the question of the Scottish succession
</p>
<p>and the Essex conspiracy than in anything else upon

</p>
<p>earth. Suppose he wishes to avail himself of this
</p>
<p>go Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>interest and to dramatise Scottish history and the
</p>
<p>character of James.
</p>
<p>How will he set about it ?
</p>
<p>From the point of view of drama history is too diffuse ;
</p>
<p>its interest is distracted and dissipated.
</p>
<p>Thus the situation of James whose father has been
</p>
<p>murdered, and whose mother has married his father's
</p>
<p>murderer, this situation is, in itself, an intensely inter-
</p>
<p>esting one, the more so as the prince himself is claimed
</p>
<p>as " the avenger of his father " ; dramatically considered
</p>
<p>the situation has, however, one serious flaw  the flaw
</p>
<p>that the prince is an infant at the time, and cannot
</p>
<p>possibly pursue in person this " vengeance."
</p>
<p>Again, the whole of the relations between James and
</p>
<p>the younger Bothwell are singularly interesting as an
</p>
<p>illustration of the character of James  the doubts, the
</p>
<p>hesitancy, the reluctance to punish, the demanding ever
</p>
<p>fresh and fresh proofs, which proofs never satisfy, the
</p>
<p>refusal to be roused even by insults, even by manifest
</p>
<p>plots against his own life, all this is exceedingly inter-
</p>
<p>esting ; but it is really quite a different story from the
</p>
<p>story of his father's murder, and to put them both into
</p>
<p>a drama would be, quite inevitably, to diffuse and break
</p>
<p>the dramatic interest.
</p>
<p>It could not make a good play. An excellent drama
</p>
<p>can, however, be made by combining in one the parts
</p>
<p>played by the two Bothwells. There is nothing diffiicull
</p>
<p>in such a conception : the two belonged to the same
</p>
<p>family,! they were uncle and nephew, they held the
</p>
<p>1 The younger Bothwell on the mother's side ; on the father's he

</p>
<p>was a Stuart.
</p>
<p>James I. and Hamlet 91
</p>
<p>same title ; they were not very dissimilar in character ;
</p>
<p>even modern Scottish historians have remarked that the
</p>
<p>younger Bothwell seemed like a reincarnation of the elder.
</p>
<p>The device of putting the two in one is quite simple
</p>
<p>and obvious, and makes excellent drama : the crimes
</p>
<p>committed by Claudius are the crimes of the elder Bothwell
</p>
<p>which are far more striking and dramatic than the crimes
</p>
<p>of the younger Bothwell ; but the relation of Hamlet to
</p>
<p>Claudius is the relation of James to the younger Bothwell.
</p>
<p>Why not ? James was neglecting his duty to his
</p>
<p>kingdom just as thoroughly as Hamlet was neglecting
</p>
<p>his duty to his father, only the latter happens to be the
</p>
<p>thing which can, most effectively, be put upon the stage.
</p>
<p>Thus, instead of two stories with their interests diffused,
</p>
<p>we have one story with its interest enormously con-
</p>
<p>centrated. And there is this further advantage, that
</p>
<p>whereas no censorship would permit Shakespeare to
</p>
<p>dramatise Scottish history as it really occurred, the
</p>
<p>censorship could not prevent him from dramatising
</p>
<p>history, if he altered it to some extent, and called it
</p>
<p>Hamlet.
</p>
<p>This, it seems to me, is the essential part of the play,
</p>
<p>and this is the real reason why Shakespeare borrows a
</p>
<p>name and a situation and practically nothing else from
</p>
<p>the Amleth Saga.
</p>
<p>A similar method of construction is, we may point
</p>
<p>out, suggested by Shakespeare himself and in Hamlet
</p>
<p>also ; it is Hamlet's own method of dealing with the
</p>
<p>Gonzago story ; he selects a tale which resembles very
</p>
<p>closely indeed the actual details of his father's murder,

</p>
<p>he alters it to make it more like, and then, when the
</p>
<p>92 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>king is filled with horror and anger, Hamlet insists that
</p>
<p>** the story is extant and writ in choice Itahan."
</p>
<p>When we remember that this was exactly the method
</p>
<p>which Shakespeare and his company were in disgrace
</p>
<p>for employing in the case of Richard 11. , we must surely
</p>
<p>admit that our evidence is cumulative.
</p>
<p>There are many other resemblances to the character
</p>
<p>of James which may also be developed.
</p>
<p>Thus, as Professor Bradley has pointed out, the
</p>
<p>character of Hamlet, notwithstanding its curious
</p>
<p>hesitancy and indecision, shows a singular power of
</p>
<p>acting in sudden crises with vigour and strength ; it is
</p>
<p>as of a sudden emergency let loose a different strain in
</p>
<p>his nature ; thus, when he is on the voyage to England,
</p>
<p>he guesses the plan of the king against him, and sub-
</p>
<p>stitutes for his own name as the name of the person to
</p>
<p>be executed those of his two companions.
</p>
<p>The type of morality involved in this particular pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding has seriously shocked some critics ; but here
</p>
<p>we need only refer to it as proving Hamlet's capacity
</p>
<p>for swift action in emergency ; it is one of the few things
</p>
<p>that Shakespeare takes directly from the saga, and it
</p>
<p>has something about it of peculiar crudity but it serves
</p>
<p>to show that Shakespeare's full portrait of Hamlet in-
</p>
<p>cluded this power of swift action in emergency.
</p>
<p>Similar power of swift and decisive action is, of course,
</p>
<p>revealed in the final scene when Hamlet kills the king ;
</p>
<p>after all the seemingly endless delays he rushes to the
</p>
<p>point in a moment : ** Then venom, do thy work," and
</p>
<p>the work is done.

</p>
<p>Now this pecuUar contradiction, as we have seen.
</p>
<p>James I. and Hamlet 93
</p>
<p>was characteristic also of James, and was one of the
</p>
<p>things that most astonished his contemporaries.
</p>
<p>Burton says :
</p>
<p>" He was a very timid and irresolute man, and yet on
</p>
<p>more than one occasion he behaved with an amount of nerve
</p>
<p>and courage which the greatest of heroes could not have
</p>
<p>excelled. . . . People on the other side of the North Sea
</p>
<p>speak of his journey to bring home his wife as a thing which
</p>
<p>he surely would not have attempted had he known the perils
</p>
<p>of the coast of Norway in winter. Whether he knew what
</p>
<p>he incurred or not on that occasion, we have seen his con-
</p>
<p>duct on another ' when the peril was not of his own seeking.
</p>
<p>He held his own in the hand-to-hand struggle with young
</p>
<p>Ruthven. He reminded the young man of the presence he
</p>
<p>was in and the propriety of removing his liat. He corrected
</p>
<p>the mysterious man in armour when he was opening the
</p>
<p>wrong window. . . .
</p>
<p>Finally the struggle had taught him that his assailant wore
</p>
<p>secret armour, .so he told Ramsay to strike below it. It is
</p>
<p>known that men of a nervous temperament will, when at
</p>
<p>bay and desperate, become unconscious of their position,
</p>
<p>and act from a sort of mechanical influence, as if there were
</p>
<p>no danger near them. Are we so to account for these wonder-
</p>
<p>ful instances of presence of mind ? "
</p>
<p>Here, again, we have a historical trait exactly similar
</p>
<p>to a trait noticeable in Hamlet.
</p>
<p>Another curious trait in James's character was his
</p>
<p>indifference to dress. His mother had never been
</p>
<p>careless in this matter ; if not a lover of splendour in
</p>
<p>the same sense as Elizabeth, she had always been
</p>
<p>decorous and dignified and, on appropriate occasions,
</p>
<p>magnificent.
</p>
<p>James was singularly careless and unkingUke, to such

</p>
<p>94 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>an extent that he excited the derision of Enghsh visitors,
</p>
<p>and was jeered at for indecorum.
</p>
<p>Sir Anthony Weldon says :
</p>
<p>" In his diet, apparel and journeys he was very constant.
</p>
<p>In his apparel so constant as by his goodwill he would never
</p>
<p>change his clothes till almost worn out to rags . . . his
</p>
<p>fashion never ; inasmuch as one bringing to him ii hat of a
</p>
<p>Spanish block, he cast it from him, swearing he neither loved
</p>
<p>them nor their fashions. Another time, bringing him roses
</p>
<p>on his shoes, he asked them if they would make him a ruff-
</p>
<p>footed dove  one yard of sixpenny ribbon served that turn."
</p>
<p>Here, again, it is impossible not to see the likeness to
</p>
<p>Hamlet : Hamlet's indifference to dress and his scorn
</p>
<p>for the courtiers to whom it meaiis so much.
</p>
<p>Ophelia speaks of him as wearing disordered apparel ^ :
</p>
<p>" Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced ;
</p>
<p>No hat upon his head ; his stockings foul'd
</p>
<p>Ungarter'd and down-gyved to his ancle " ;
</p>
<p>and Hamlet shows the utmost contempt for Osric " the
</p>
<p>water-fly," and for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
</p>
<p>Other portions of Sir Anthony Weldon 's description
</p>
<p>may also be quoted :
</p>
<p>" He was veiy witty, and has as many ready, witty jests
</p>
<p>as any man living at which he would not smile himselfe, but
</p>
<p>deliver them in a grave and serious manner. . . .
</p>
<p>" He would make a great deal too bold with God in his passion
</p>
<p>both in cursing and swearing and one strain higher verging
</p>
<p>on blasphemy ; but would in his better temper sa}^ : ' He
</p>
<p>hoped God would not impute them as sins and lay them to
</p>
<p>his charge, seeing they proceeded from passion.' "
</p>
<p>" He was infinitely inclined to peace."
</p>
<p>" His chosen motto was : ' Beati pacifici.' "

</p>
<p>James I. and Hamlet 95
</p>
<p>Here, again, we have traits which closely resemble
</p>
<p>those of Hamlet. Hamlet's wit and his ready jests are
</p>
<p>shown in many scenes. At the same time he does deliver
</p>
<p>his jests in a grave and serious manner ; particularly
</p>
<p>in his relations to Polonius and to Osric and Guildenstern
</p>
<p>he is full of irony.
</p>
<p>We have several examples of his cursing with regard
</p>
<p>to the king ; he accuses himself/ of cursing like a whore
</p>
<p>or a scullion :
</p>
<p>" Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
</p>
<p>And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,

<p>A scullion ! "
</p>
<p>As examples of James' witty sayings Weldon quotes :
</p>
<p>" I wonder not so much that women paint themselves,
</p>
<p>as that when they are painted, men can love them."'
</p>
<p>We may compare Hamlet 2 : " God has given you one face
</p>
<p>and you make yourselves another."
</p>
<p>Again, James was a student ; he was particularly
</p>
<p>fond, as we have seen, of discoursing on theology and
</p>
<p>philosophy ; he was also in the habit of taking tablets
</p>
<p>wherever he went to make notes ; his tablets were always
</p>
<p>0:1 hand, and this was a marked pecuharity of his.
</p>
<p>Hamlet, also, has this peculiarity, and shows it in a
</p>
<p>most extraordinary manner ; he even carries his tablets
</p>
<p>with him in his interview with the ghost, and notes down
</p>
<p>the fact that
</p>
<p>' A man may smile and smile and be a villaui " ;
</p>
<p>it is surely the most extraordinary example recorded
</p>
<p>of the use of tablets and serves to show, at the least,

</p>
<p>96 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>that Hamlet must have been particularly addicted to their
</p>
<p>employment. In fact, it is difficult to see any motive for
</p>
<p>such a bizarre example except to show a personal trait.
</p>
<p>Hamlet is described by the queen as being " fat and
</p>
<p>scant of breath." James also was corpulent. " He was
</p>
<p>of middle stature," says Sir Anthony Weldon, " more
</p>
<p>corpulent through his clothes than in reality, his body
</p>
<p>yet fat enough."
</p>
<p>Hamlet is described as being thirty years of age,^
</p>
<p>for the sexton came to his office when young Hamlet
</p>
<p>was born and says : "I have been sexton here, man and
</p>
<p>boy, for thirty years."
</p>
<p>James was actually about thirty-three when Hamlet
</p>
<p>was produced ; it was the custom, however, to state
</p>
<p>age in round numbers, and we occasionally find James
</p>
<p>mentioned as being thirty years of age when he came
</p>
<p>to the thronc.2 This is almost the only case in Shake-
</p>
<p>speare where a defniite age is given to the hero, and it
</p>
<p>looks as if there were a reason for it.
</p>
<p>Again we observe Hamlet's curious methods of cir-
</p>
<p>cumventing people, of finding out their intentions by
</p>
<p>means of tricks ; this is revealed most plainty in the
</p>
<p>case of Polonius ; but the same thing happens with
</p>
<p>Osric, with Rosencrantz, and with Guildenstern, also
</p>
<p>with the king.
</p>
<p>This, again, was a trait characteristic of James :
</p>
<p>" If he had not that extreme timidity with which he has
</p>
<p>often been charged, he certainty shrank from facing dangers ;
</p>
<p>and this shrinking was allied in early life with a habit of

</p>
<p>cautious fencing with questioners, without much regard for
</p>
<p>truth, which was the natural outcome of his position among
</p>
<p>hostile parties." ^
</p>
<p>So Sir Anthony Wcldon says of him : "He was very
</p>
<p>crafty and cunning in petty things, as the circumventing
</p>
<p>any great man."
</p>
<p>This, surely, exactly resembles the position of Hamlet.
</p>
<p>Hamlet fences with Polonius, with the king, with Osric,
</p>
<p>with Rosencrantz, and certainly without much regard
</p>
<p>to the truth ; at the same time, it is justified to the mind
</p>
<p>of the audience by the manifest peril in which he stands
</p>
<p>and by the fact that the people who surround him are
</p>
<p>inimical and hostile, intent on betraying him ; the
</p>
<p>audience cordially approves of his trick of outwitting
</p>
<p>his enemies by verbal subtleties. Hamlet's policy delivers
</p>
<p>him from many perils, and James also earned the reward
</p>
<p>of a similar skill.
</p>
<p>"He was," says Burton, "the first monarch of his race
</p>
<p>since the Jameses began who was to be permitted to reach
</p>
<p>the natural duration of his days ; for though his grandfather
</p>
<p>was not slain, his end was hastened by violence. When we
</p>
<p>trace the genealogic line of his house, we find it inaugurated
</p>
<p>by the murder of his father and the ruin of his mother, ending
</p>
<p>on the scaffold. ..."
</p>
<p>Now the James whom Shakespeare's audience were
</p>
<p>contemplating as their future king was the very person
</p>
<p>involved in these tragedies ; he had survived until his
</p>
<p>thirties, after being threatened with the most serious
</p>
<p>perils from and, indeed, even before his birth ; he had
</p>
<p>survived mainly by the devotion of a few most faithful

<p>Ihal the character of Ihe Duke is allogelhc-r inieiior U)
</p>
<p>100 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>that of Hamlet, it is not nearly so noble or so attractive,
</p>
<p>and the other is that the character of the Duke is
</p>
<p>more like that of the historic James as we usually con-
</p>
<p>ceive the latter to have been. I have dwelt on this
</p>
<p>elsewhere.^
</p>
<p>Now, if Shakespeare takes the central conception of
</p>
<p>both these characters from the historic James, as he
</p>
<p>apparently does, the problem at once arises as to why
</p>
<p>these characters are in themselves so different.
</p>
<p>Now it appears to me that the answer to this is
</p>
<p>probably threefold. In the first place, Shakespeare, when
</p>
<p>he wrote Hamlet had not seen James I. ; at that date
</p>
<p>the Scottish king had not crossed the Border ; all that
</p>
<p>was known of him must have been eagerly canvassed ;
</p>
<p>but the man himself had never set foot in England.
</p>
<p>Before Shakespeare wrote Measure for Measure, both he
</p>
<p>and his audience had made the acquaintance of James,
</p>
<p>and had possibly found him less attractive on a nearer
</p>
<p>view. In the second place, Shakespeare quite probably
</p>
<p>intended Hamlet, in part at least, as a pamphlet in favour
</p>
<p>of the Scottish succession ; in such circumstances he
</p>
<p>would naturally do everything he could to invest the
</p>
<p>figure of the prince with glamour and with charm ;
</p>
<p>hence we have a philosophic and melancholy prince,
</p>
<p>seen against a background of dark crimes, a prince whose
</p>
<p>peace-loving nature makes him abhor the duty of blood-
</p>
<p>shed laid upon him, an enigmatic figure wayward and
</p>
<p>strange yet full of fascination.
</p>
<p>W^at are our prevailing feelings as we pursue the
</p>
<p>course of the play ? One of them surely is that we should

<p>James I. and Hamlet loi
</p>
<p>like to take Hamlet away from his surroundings which
</p>
<p>are unworthy of him, away from the Denmark which
</p>
<p>does not merit him, and introduce him to a nobler
</p>
<p>sphere.
</p>
<p>But is not this precisely and exactly the feeling which
</p>
<p>Shakespeare wished to create ? It is, at any rate,
</p>
<p>plausible.
</p>
<p>In the third place, and perhaps most important of
</p>
<p>all, I do not consider that Hamlet is solely a portrait
</p>
<p>of James I. ; it seems to me to contain much of Essex
</p>
<p>as Essex was in the last year of his hfe. I shall hope
</p>
<p>to demonstrate this later, and to show how those portions

<p>of the character which are psychologically inconsistent
</p>
<p>with the rest may have had their origin in this way.

<p>CHAPTER IV
</p>
<p>"the play within the play" and hamlet's voyage
</p>
<p>to england
</p>
<p>I WILL pass on to a consideration of what seem like further
</p>
<p>historical resemblances in the drama.
</p>
<p>After the Darnley murder, popular excitement showed
</p>
<p>itself in continually representing the scene of the murder,
</p>
<p>and thrusting these representations before the eyes of
</p>
<p>the people mainly concerned. The Lords of the Council
</p>
<p>exhibited a banner showing the two dead men  Darnley
</p>
<p>and his servant  beneath a tree, the little prince kneeling
</p>
<p>beside their bodies praying for vengeance, and a broken
</p>
<p>branch.
</p>
<p>Burton says :
</p>
<p>" A portion of the natural excitement of the time appears
</p>
<p>oddly enough to have expended itself in painting. Several
</p>
<p>representations seem to have been made of the discovery
</p>
<p>of the bodies, with more or less allegorical machinery ; and
</p>
<p>several other pictures made their appearance which, either
</p>
<p>through an allegoiy or an attempt to represent facts, gave
</p>
<p>shape to the feelings of their producers. Caricatures they
</p>
<p>could not be called, for they had a deadly earnest about them
</p>
<p>. . . they were deemed as signs of the times so important
</p>
<p>that some of them may now be found among the documents
</p>
<p>of the period. There is one in which an attempt is made to
</p>
<p>represent the whole scene of the murder . . . the shattered
</p>
<p>house, the Hotel of the Hamiltons beside it, the city gate
</p>
<p>and wall, the remnant of the old Kirk-of-the-Field, the bodies
</p>
<p>and the assembled crowd of citizens."

</p>
<p>" The Play Within the Play " 103
</p>
<p>The banner used by the Lords of the Council was
</p>
<p>employed at Carberry Hill as a kind of sacred symbol ;
</p>
<p>it was shown to Mary after her captivity, and produced
</p>
<p>a dreadful impression upon her.
</p>
<p>Lingard says :
</p>
<p>" An hour did not elapse before Mary learned that she
</p>
<p>was a captive in the hands of unfeeling adversaries. At her
</p>
<p>entrance into the city she was met by a mob in the highest
</p>
<p>state of excitement : her ears were assailed with reproaches
</p>
<p>and imprecations ; and before her eyes was waved a banner,
</p>
<p>representing the body of her late husband, and the prince her
</p>
<p>son on his knees exclaiming, " Revenge my cause, O Lord."
</p>
<p>. . . During the two and twenty hours that she was confined
</p>
<p>in her solitary prison, the unhappy queen abandoned herself
</p>
<p>to the terrors which her situation inspired. From the street
</p>
<p>she was repeatedly seen at the window almost in a state of
</p>
<p>nudity ; and was often heard to call on the citizens conjuring
</p>
<p>them to aid and deliver their sovereign from the cruelty of
</p>
<p>traitors."
</p>
<p>Here, again, we surely have a very close likeness to the
</p>
<p>"play within the play" motive of Hamlet. Hamlet
</p>
<p>desires to reconstruct the murder before the very eyes
</p>
<p>of the guilty king ; since the whole drama is a stage
</p>
<p>presentation also, how else could it be shown ? The
</p>
<p>idea is exactly and precisely the same as that of the
</p>
<p>Scottish banners and paintings ; that of constructing
</p>
<p>graphic representations of the murder and thrusting
</p>
<p>them before the eyes of the guilty parties. We may
</p>
<p>observe, also, that Hamlet's play is largely a dumb
</p>
<p>show.
</p>
<p>Hamlet cries, "The play's the thing wherein Fll catch
</p>
<p>the conscience of the king," and the Scottish accusers

</p>
<p>exhibited the dreadful scene on the banner in precisely
</p>
<p>104 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>this way, and with this motive, to the persons whose
</p>
<p>guilt was suspected but of whose participation they
</p>
<p>were not assured, and the result was precisely the same
</p>
<p>betrayal of grief and horror and anguish.
</p>
<p>Nothing hke this play scene appears in either Saxo
</p>
<p>Grammaticus or in the Hystorie oj Hamblei, though it may
</p>
<p>have done in Kyd's play ; but, as I have already pointed
</p>
<p>out, anything anterior to the supposed date of that play
</p>
<p>(1587 or 1589) may have been used by him as readily as
</p>
<p>by Shakespeare, and the Scottish parallel certainly might
</p>
<p>have been employed. If Shakespeare really wished to
</p>
<p>dramatise history it is difficult to see how he could have
</p>
<p>arranged the dramatisation better or more effectively, the
</p>
<p>essence being the scenic representation which forces the
</p>
<p>guilty to betray themselves.
</p>
<p>I do not think this is the only historical reference in
</p>
<p>the part of Hamlet which relates to the players ; but the
</p>
<p>rest will have its due study later.
</p>
<p>Another historic parallel to be found in Hamlet is his
</p>
<p>voyage to England. This, of course, occurs in the
</p>
<p>original saga, but Shakespeare has changed its conclusion.
</p>
<p>In Saxo, Hamlet is sent to England with a secret message
</p>
<p>to the king, desiring him to put Hamlet to death ; Hamlet,
</p>
<p>however, suspects the deceit, alters the message, and
</p>
<p>substitutes one desiring the king of England to give
</p>
<p>his daughter in marriage to the noble youth ; " Nor
</p>
<p>was he satisfied with removing from himself the sentence
</p>
<p>of death, and passing the peril on to others, but added
</p>
<p>an entreaty that the king of Britain would grant his
</p>
<p>daughter in marriage to a youth of great judgment whom

</p>
<p>he was sending them."
</p>
<p>" The Play Within the Play " 105
</p>
<p>In the Hystorie of Hamhlet, we have exactly the same
</p>
<p>situation. All takes effect as Hamlet has planned.
</p>
<p>The King, having witnessed many extraordinary ex-
</p>
<p>amples of Hamlet's wisdom, gives him his daughter and
</p>
<p>Hamlet returns to his own country, takes his revenge, and
</p>
<p>ultimately, of course, claims his British bride :
</p>
<p>" Then the king adored the wisdom of Amleth as though
</p>
<p>it were inspired and gave him his daughter to wife ; accepting
</p>
<p>his bare word as though it were a witness from the skies."
</p>
<p>Now, in the saga, the real purport of this journey to
</p>
<p>England is to get Hamlet married to an English princess ;
</p>
<p>Shakespeare removes this motive altogether, for his
</p>
<p>Hamlet does not marry, nevertheless he retains the
</p>
<p>voyage. There is thus a very curious effect produced.
</p>
<p>Hamlet, who knows the designs the king has against
</p>
<p>his life, who knows that he ought to pursue his task of
</p>
<p>vengeance and punishment, nevertheless allows himself
</p>
<p>to be hurried out of the kingdom on a voyage which he
</p>
<p>must have been aware was excessively dangerous, from
</p>
<p>which he might never have returned. As more than
</p>
<p>one critic has pointed out this is most unfair to his un-
</p>
<p>fortunate country ; he leaves it in the power of a villain
</p>
<p>while he allows himself to go, without any real necessity,
</p>
<p>on a most perilous expedition from which he is only saved
</p>
<p>by chance.
</p>
<p>The effect is a curious mingling of hesitancy and rash-
</p>
<p>ness which is one of the difficulties of Hamlet's character
</p>
<p>and of the play. The whole adventure is without the
</p>
<p>strong, obvious and clear motive given in the saga. Why
</p>
<p>is it retained ? The answer would seem to be " because

<p>there is a real historical parallel and because this historical
</p>
<p>io6 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>parallel did genuinely supply an important element in
</p>
<p>the character Shakespeare was studying."
</p>
<p>James had received the promise of Anne of Denmark
</p>
<p>as his bride ; the marriage by proxy was solemnised
</p>
<p>in August 1589. A brilliant little fleet was appointed
</p>
<p>for conveying the bride home to Scotland ; but it was
</p>
<p>driven by storms into a port of Norway ; James thereupon
</p>
<p>determined to set out himself to bring home his bride,
</p>
<p>and actually did so ; the voyage at that time of the year
</p>
<p>was exceedingly dangerous, and the king's return was
</p>
<p>long delayed by storms.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the younger Bothwell had been left
</p>
<p>to his own devices in the kingdom.
</p>
<p>Elizabeth blamed James as severely for his rashness
</p>
<p>in this episode as modern commentators have blamed
</p>
<p>Hamlet :
</p>
<p>" I do believe that God hath of his goodness more than your
</p>
<p>hide, prospered to good end your untimely and, if I dare tell
</p>
<p>you the truth, evil-seasoned journey, yet I may no longer stay
</p>
<p>but let you know. . . . And now to talk to you freely as paper
</p>
<p>may utter conceit. Accept my hourly care for your broken
</p>
<p>country, too, too much infected with the malady of strange
</p>
<p>humours and to receive no medicine so well compounded as
</p>
<p>if the owner make the mixture appropriated to the quality
</p>
<p>of the sickness. Know you my dear brother, for certain, that
</p>
<p>those ulcers that were too much skinned with the ' doulce-
</p>
<p>ness " of your applications were but falsely shaded and were
</p>
<p>filled within with much venom as hath burst out since your
</p>
<p>departure with most lewd offers to another Idng to enter
</p>
<p>your land."^

<p>Shakespeare has removed the clear, effective, and
</p>
<p>powerful motive which the voyage had in the saga. Yet

<p>he retains the incident. Why ? It certainly looks as
</p>
<p>if he had retained it as a temperamental trait because
</p>
<p>it shows a power of vigorous action in emergency with,
</p>
<p>at the same time, a certain rashness and weakness in the
</p>
<p>very circumstances which enable the vigour to be shown.
</p>
<p>It is interesting also to observe that the mysterious
</p>
<p>letters have a historical parallel in the affair known as
</p>
<p>the "Spanish blanks" which occurred shortly after
</p>
<p>James' voyage.
</p>
<p>Burton says :
</p>
<p>" In the same year  1592  occurred the incident called
</p>
<p>the " Spanish blanks " which disturbed the zealous Presby-
</p>
<p>terian party to an extent not easily realised by looking at
</p>
<p>the scanty materials by which it was produced. But in fact
</p>
<p>it was the mystery excited by imperfect evidence that created
</p>
<p>suspicion and terror. It was suspected that a man named
</p>
<p>Kerr, who was leaving Scotland by the West coast, had
</p>
<p>dangerous documents in his custody. The minister of Paisley,
</p>
<p>hearing of this, gathered some sturdy parishioners who
</p>
<p>seized and searched Kerr. They took from him eight papers
</p>
<p>called " the blanks." Each had upon it the concluding
</p>
<p>courtesies of a letter addressed to royalties. " De vostre
</p>
<p>majestic tres humble ct tres obesant servitor," and this was
</p>
<p>followed by one or more signatures."
</p>
<p>Otherwise these slips of paper had " no designation
</p>
<p>on the back, nor declaration of the causes for which they
</p>
<p>were sent, but blank and white paper on both sides except
</p>
<p>the said subscriptions." They were signed by the
</p>
<p>Catholic earls : Huntly, Errol, Angus, etc. The con-
</p>
<p>clusion arrived at was that the blanks were intended to
</p>
<p>be filled up by certain Jesuit emissaries and were, when
</p>
<p>so filled, to form an invitation to the king of Spain to

<p>send men to Scotland to assist in a Catholic rising.
</p>
<p>io8 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>James behaved in this affair according to his usual
</p>
<p>custom, and was particularly merciful to the offenders.
</p>
<p>Elizabeth, as her letters show, was greatly enraged, and
</p>
<p>once more demanded justice, but James punished no
</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>Now here, again, one notices a marked difference be-
</p>
<p>tween Shakespeare and his saga source. In the saga there
</p>
<p>is no question whatever of Amleth being on good terms
</p>
<p>with the king after the treacherous embassy ; having
</p>
<p>discovered the truth, Amleth returns to Denmark and
</p>
<p>proceeds at once to his revenge. He sets the banqueting
</p>
<p>hall on fire, burns most of the courtiers to death in their
</p>
<p>drunken sleep, and cuts off the head of the king in his
</p>
<p>own bedchamber.
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's ever-forgiving Hamlet, however, once
</p>
<p>more places himself on amiable terms with Claudius
</p>
<p>and, for the last time, attempts friendship ; exactly in
</p>
<p>the same way James once more forgave the Catholic earls
</p>
<p>and Bothwell.

<p>Once again we have a historic parallel.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER V
</p>
<p>POLONIUS, RIZZIO, AND BURLEIGH
</p>
<p>Other portions of Hamlet which appear to contain
</p>
<p>historical reminiscences are the scenes connected with
</p>
<p>Polonius.
</p>
<p>If the acconnt of the murder, for instance, be carefully
</p>
<p>compared with the saga on the one hand, and with Scottish
</p>
<p>history on the other, it will be found, I think, that it
</p>
<p>shows hardly any resemblances to the one but very close
</p>
<p>resemblances to the other.
</p>
<p>The saga reads :
</p>
<p>" Feng was purposely to absent himself, pretending affairs
</p>
<p>of great import. Amletli should be closeted alone with his
</p>
<p>mother in her chamber ; but a man should fust be com-
</p>
<p>missioned to place himself in a concealed part of the room
</p>
<p>and listen heedlully to what they talked about. For, if the
</p>
<p>son had any wits at all, he would not hesitate to speak out
</p>
<p>in the hearing of his mother or fear to trust himself to the
</p>
<p>fidelity of her who bore him. The speaker . . . zealously
</p>
<p>professed himself as the agent of the eavesdropping. Feng
</p>
<p>rejoiced at the scheme and departed on pretence of a long
</p>
<p>journey. Now he who had given this counsel repaired privily
</p>
<p>to the room where Amletli was shut up with his mother, and
</p>
<p>lay down skulking in the straw. But Amletli had his antidote
</p>
<p>for the treachery. Afraid of being heard by some eaves-
</p>
<p>dropper he at first resorted to his usual imbecile ways and
</p>
<p>crowed like a noisy cock, beating his arms together to
</p>
<p>mimic the flapping of wings. Then he mounted the straw
</p>
<p>and began to swing his body and jump again and again,

<p>no Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>wishing to try if aught lurked there in hiding. FeeUng a
</p>
<p>lump beneath his feet he drove his sword into the spot and
</p>
<p>impaled him who lay hid. Then he dragged him from his
</p>
<p>concealment and slew him. Then, cutting his body into
</p>
<p>morsels, he seethed it in boiling water and flung it through
</p>
<p>the mouth of an open sewer for the swine to eat, bestrewing
</p>
<p>the stinking mire with his helpless limbs. . . ,
</p>
<p>"When Feng returned nowhere could he find the man who
</p>
<p>had suggested the treacherous espial ; he searched for him
</p>
<p>long and carefully, but none said they had seen him any-
</p>
<p>where. Amleth, among others, was asked in jest if he had
</p>
<p>come across any trace of him, and replied that the man had
</p>
<p>gone to the sewer but had fallen to its bottom and been
</p>
<p>stifled by the floods of filth, and that then he had been
</p>
<p>devoured by the swine that came up all about the place. ^
</p>
<p>The Hysforie of Hamhlet gives substantially the same
</p>
<p>tale ; it says that Hamlet cut the body into pieces, boiled
</p>
<p>it, and then cast it into an open vault or privy, so that
</p>
<p>it might serve as food for the pigs.
</p>
<p>Now, here there is one point of resemblance with
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's Hamlet ; that is the motive given to the
</p>
<p>eavesdropper who is to report Hamlet's confidences
</p>
<p>to his mother, but all the rest is entirely unlike.
</p>
<p>What has Shakespeare's Hamlet in common with this
</p>
<p>grotesque clown who crows like a cock, and with this
</p>
<p>hideous barbarian who boils the body of his victim and
</p>
<p>then throws it through a sewer to the pigs ?
</p>
<p>Turn now to Scottish history and see what it says of
</p>
<p>the murder of Rizzio :
</p>
<p>Signor David became the queen's inseparable companion
</p>
<p>in the council room and the cabinet. At all hours of the day
</p>
<p>he was to be found with her in her apartments. . . . He

<p>^ Saxo Gramma ticus.
</p>
<p>Polonius, Rizzio and Burleigh iii
</p>
<p>was often alone with her until midnight. He had the control
</p>
<p>of all the business of the state. . . . Darnley went one night
</p>
<p>between twelve and one to the queen's room. Finding the
</p>
<p>door locked he knocked, but could get no answer . . . after
</p>
<p>a long time the Queen drew the bolt ... he entered and she
</p>
<p>appeared to be alone but, on searching, he found Rizzio half-
</p>
<p>dressed in a closet. . . . Darnley's word was not a good one,
</p>
<p>but that was what he said. . . . Darnley desired the dramatic
</p>
<p>revenge of killing Rizzio in the queen's presence. . . . The
</p>
<p>conspirators ascended the winding stairs from Darnley's
</p>
<p>room . . . Darnley entered . . . supper was on the table
</p>
<p>. . . the queen asked Darnley if he had supped." ^
</p>
<p>So the scene proceeds ; Rizzio calls loudly for help,
</p>
<p>but he is stabbed ; Darnley's dagger is left in the body
</p>
<p>so that he may be clearly incriminated, the body itself
</p>
<p>is dragged down a staircase and flung upon a chest. . . .
</p>
<p>The queen lamented bitterly for him : " Poor David !
</p>
<p>Good and faithful servant. May God have mercy on
</p>
<p>your soul."
</p>
<p>Afterwards, we may remember, Darnley was recon-
</p>
<p>ciled to the queen and showed or affected to show bitter
</p>
<p>repentance for his share in the murder. The Lords
</p>
<p>Politic sat for several days to consider the murder ;
</p>
<p>but, since they feared to accuse anyone, nothing was
</p>
<p>done.
</p>
<p>Now, here, we surely have far closer resemblances
</p>
<p>to the scene in Hamlet though, as in the other parallels,
</p>
<p>the scene is dramatised by isolating and concentrating ;
</p>
<p>two scenes are run into one, the scene where Darnley
</p>
<p>alone discovered (or said he discovered) Rizzio, and the
</p>
<p>scene of the murder.

</p>
<p>112 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>We have the discovery by the hero alone, we have
</p>
<p>the stabbing with the hero's weapon in the dead man's
</p>
<p>body. We have the queen's bitter lament for the " good
</p>
<p>old man " ^ and for the " rash and bloody deed." Hamlet
</p>
<p>disposes of the body " by a staircase," and the staircase
</p>
<p>played a principal part in the Rizzio murder.
</p>
<p>We may also observe that Hamlet's gruesome remark
</p>
<p>about Polonius being " at supper, not where he eats
</p>
<p>but where he is eaten," 2 seems like a macabre reference
</p>
<p>to the Rizzio murder where the victim also was found
</p>
<p>" at supper " ; the same may be said of the remark
</p>
<p>that " a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en
</p>
<p>at him," which, again, looks Irke a macabre reference
</p>
<p>to the wearisome and futile sittings of the " Lords
</p>
<p>Politic " in considering the murder. Any of these
</p>
<p>references might be accidental if it stood alone ; it is,
</p>
<p>as always, the combination which is the convincing
</p>
<p>thing.
</p>
<p>We may observe that the intimacy of Polonius with
</p>
<p>the queen is really close ; he is not, like the eavesdropper
</p>
<p>in the saga, a person with whom she has no intimate
</p>
<p>concern ; he is a genuinely trusted councillor.
</p>
<p>It may be said that the Rizzio murder belongs to
</p>
<p>Darnley and not to James I., but it had a close and
</p>
<p>vital connection with the group of historic events, and
</p>
<p>was in itself, a thing which probably determined the
</p>
<p>choice, magnificent dramatic material.
</p>
<p>We may also observe that the whole scene is, as it
</p>
<p>were, set apart in the play and stands detached from the
</p>
<p>main action. There is, again, the statement that Hamlet

</p>
<p>Polonius, Rizzio and Burleigh 113
</p>
<p>repents his deed, for, according to the queen " he weeps
</p>
<p>for what is done," and she, at any rate, desires to shield
</p>
<p>and protect him. All this is foreign to the saga, but
</p>
<p>does occur in the history. Darnley professed penitence
</p>
<p>and the queen did protect him. I may also point out
</p>
<p>that the other reference to the Rizzio murder occurred
</p>
<p>in the first scene where the ghost appeared to Hamlet,
</p>
<p>and in this scene with the queen the ghost appears
</p>
<p>again. There is, apparently, a logical and dramatic
</p>
<p>connection between the two.
</p>
<p>Moberley has a note on the lines :
</p>
<p>" Indeed this coimcillor
</p>
<p>Is now most still, most secret and most grave
</p>
<p>Who was in life a foolish prating knave."
</p>
<p>He observes that they arc almost exactly the same words
</p>
<p>used by the porter at Holyrood, when Rizzio's body
</p>
<p>was placed on a chest near his lodge.
</p>
<p>But we do not, I think, dispose of the historical
</p>
<p>resemblances in the character of Polonius by saying that
</p>
<p>his death resembles that of Rizzio's. It has more than
</p>
<p>once been pointed out that he shows a likeness to
</p>
<p>Burleigh, and this, also, appears to be true. We may
</p>
<p>observe that Burleigh died in the year 1598, shortly
</p>
<p>before Hamlet was produced ; he had died at the
</p>
<p>advanced age of seventy-eight, and was thought by many
</p>
<p>to have been in his dotage ; even Elizabeth in her wrath
</p>
<p>occasionally accused him of dotage.^
</p>
<p>Burleigh had been the bitter enemy of Shakespeare's
</p>

</p>
<p>patrons  Essex and Southampton, and it was generally
</p>
<p>believed that the Cecils between them had lured Essex
</p>
<p>to his ruin. The popular mind also ascribed to Burleigh
</p>
<p>enmity against the Scottish succession.
</p>
<p>Now, if Burleigh were the bitter enemy of Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>friends, if he were very generally unpopular and mis-
</p>
<p>trusted, if he were believed to be an enemy to the
</p>
<p>Scottish succession, Shakespeare might very naturally
</p>
<p>represent him as another of the main enemies of his
</p>
<p>philosophic prince, and that is what he appears to have
</p>
<p>done, for the resemblances between Burleigh and Polonius
</p>
<p>seem too great to be ascribed to any form of accident.
</p>
<p>In the first place we may note that the original form
</p>
<p>of the name was Corambis and not Polonius, and that
</p>
<p>Corambis does suggest Cecil and Burleigh.
</p>
<p>Polonius, throughout the play, stands isolated as the
</p>
<p>one person who does really enjoy the royal confidence;
</p>
<p>he is an old man, and no other councillor of equal rank
</p>
<p>anywhere appears. This corresponds almost precisely
</p>
<p>with the position held by Burleigh ; he had, for the greater
</p>
<p>part of his reign, been among Elizabeth's chief councillors,
</p>
<p>and the death of Walsingham and others left him isolated
</p>
<p>in her service, surviving almost all the men of his own
</p>
<p>generation.
</p>
<p>Cecil was a man of learning, and Polonius obviously
</p>
<p>desires to be esteemed as such. Cecil had been closely
</p>
<p>associated with some of the chief classical scholars of
</p>
<p>the day, Cheke for example, and Polonius makes a boast
</p>
<p>of his classical learning : ^ " Seneca cannot be too heavy,
</p>
<p>nor Plautus too light."

</p>
<p>Polonius, Rizzio and Burleigh 115
</p>
<p>Cecil, in his youth, had played a prominent part in
</p>
<p>Cambridge, and was proud to remain connected with the
</p>
<p>university, and Polonius also alludes to his life in the
</p>
<p>university and his taking part in the university plays. ^
</p>
<p>" I did enact Juhus Caesar ; I was killed i' the Capitol ;
</p>
<p>Brutus killed me."
</p>
<p>We may also remember, in this connection, that when
</p>
<p>William Cecil died, he was still Chancellor of the Uni-
</p>
<p>versity of Cambridge ; there can be no doubt both from
</p>
<p>Hamlet's question, and from his reply, that Polonius
</p>
<p>liked to associate himself with the university as Cecil did.
</p>
<p>Cecil had one romance, and one romance only, in his
</p>
<p>life, that was when he married a penniless bride  Mary
</p>
<p>Cheke, the sister of the great Greek scholar ; the marriage
</p>
<p>was vehemently opposed by his family, but Cecil es-
</p>
<p>poused her in secret.
</p>
<p>Now, according to his own account, Polonius also
</p>
<p>had experienced a romantic love-affair in his youth :
</p>
<p>'' truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love,
</p>
<p>very near this." 2
</p>
<p>This particular speech has nearly alwaj^s been con-
</p>
<p>sidered as a pure absurdity ; but it would be even more
</p>
<p>ironically amusing if the audience believed it literally
</p>
<p>true.
</p>
<p>Again, Burleigh's eldest son  Thomas Cecil  was a
</p>
<p>youth of very wayward life ; his licentiousness and
</p>
<p>irregularity occasioned his father great distress and,

</p>
<p>reports of his son's behaviour. So Polonius has a son
</p>
<p>Laertes  whom he suspects of irregular Ufe ; Polonius
</p>
<p>provides that his son, when he goes to Paris, shall be
</p>
<p>carefully watched, and that reports on his behaviour
</p>
<p>shall be prepared by Reynaldo.
</p>
<p>I will place side by side the parallels that seem to
</p>
<p>me most pertinent, pointing out first that there is no
</p>
<p>resemblance whatever in the saga source.
</p>
<p>" Amidst his manifold public anxieties Cecil had to bear
</p>
<p>his share of private trouble. . . . Thomas, his only son by
</p>
<p>his first marriage with Mary Cheke was now (1561) a young
</p>
<p>man of twenty, and in order that he might receive the polish
</p>
<p>fitting to the heir of a great personage, his father consulted
</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, the Ambassador in Paris, in the
</p>
<p>Spring of 1561, with the idea of sending him thither. A
</p>
<p>subsequent recommendation of Thomas Windebank, the
</p>
<p>young man's governor, to the effect that it would be well to
</p>
<p>accept Throgmorton 's offer, although Sir William Cecil was
</p>
<p>loath to trespass on his friend's hospitality, " in order that the
</p>
<p>youth might learn, not only at table but otherwise, according
</p>
<p>to his estate," leads us to the conclusion that Thomas Cecil
</p>
<p>had not hitherto been an apt scholar . . . from the first it
</p>
<p>was seen that the father was misgiving and anxious. Cecil
</p>
<p>was a reserved man, full of public affairs ; but this corre-
</p>
<p>spondence proves that he was also a man of deep family
</p>
<p>affections, and above all, that he regarded with horror the
</p>
<p>idea that any scandal should attach to his honoured name.
</p>
<p>In his first letter to his son he strikes the note of distrust. . . .
</p>
<p>" He wishes him God's blessing, but how he inclines himself
</p>
<p>to deserve it he knows not." None of his son's three letters,
</p>
<p>he explains, makes any mention of the expense he is incurring.
</p>
<p>... To Windebank the father is more outspoken. How
</p>
<p>are they spending their time, he asks, and heartily prays that
</p>

<p>Thomas seems to have done nothing of the sort ; for, in
</p>
<p>nearly every letter, Windebank urges Sir William to repeat
</p>
<p>Polonius, Rizzio and Burleigh 117
</p>
<p>his injunctions about prayer to his son. . . . But the scape-
</p>
<p>grace paid httle heed. . . . Rumour of his ill-behaviour
</p>
<p>reached Sir William, not at first from Windebank. In March
</p>
<p>1562 an angry and indignant letter went from Cecil to his
</p>
<p>son, reproaching him for his bad conduct. There was no
</p>
<p>amendment he said, and all who came to Paris gave him the
</p>
<p>character of "a dissolute, slothful, negligent and careless
</p>
<p>young man and the letter is signed ' your father of an un-
</p>
<p>worthy son.' "
</p>
<p>A week later Cecil writes : " Windebank, I am here
</p>
<p>used to pains and troubles, but none creep so near my
</p>
<p>heart as does this of my lewd son. . . . Good Windebank,
</p>
<p>consult my dear friend Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, to whom
</p>
<p>I have referred the whole. . . . If ye shall come with
</p>
<p>him (i.e. Thomas) to cover the shame, let it appear to
</p>
<p>be by reason of the troubles there." ^
</p>
<p>We may compare this with Hamlet ^ :
</p>
<p>Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
</p>
<p>Rey. I will, my lord.
</p>
<p>Pol. You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
</p>
<p>Before you visit him, to make inquire
</p>
<p>Of his behaviour.
</p>
<p>Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
</p>
<p>Pol. Marry, well said ; very well said. Look you, sir.
</p>
<p>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris ;
</p>
<p>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
</p>
<p>. . . and finding
</p>
<p>By this encompassment and drift of question
</p>
<p>That they do know my son, come you more nearer.
</p>
<p>Than your particular demands will touch it :
</p>
<p>. . . put on him
</p>
<p>What forgeries you please ; marry, none so rank
</p>
<p>As may dishonour him ; take heed of that ;

</p>
<p>As are companions noted and most known

<p>To youth and liberty.
</p>
<p>Rey. As gaming, my lord.
</p>
<p>Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
</p>
<p>Drabbing: you may go so far."
</p>
<p>Now, surely we notice here an essentially similar
</p>
<p>situation to the one given in Burleigh's life ; the father
</p>
<p>an immaculate, all-wise councillor at home, the spend-
</p>
<p>thrift son leading a licentious life in Paris, and anyone
</p>
<p>who knows the father encouraged to give reports on the
</p>
<p>son's behaviour which the father anticipates, with only
</p>
<p>too much justice, will almost certainly be evil reports.
</p>
<p>Cecil wrote a number of maxims for the guidance of
</p>
<p>his son, and these maxims show a remarkable likeness
</p>
<p>to those given by Polonius to Laertes.
</p>
<p>" If his own conduct was ruled," says Martin Hume, " as
</p>
<p>some of his actions were by the maxims which in middle age
</p>
<p>he had laid down for his favourite son, he must have been a
</p>
<p>marvel of prudence and wisdom. Like the usual recommenda-
</p>
<p>tions of age to youth, many of these precepts simply inculcate
</p>
<p>moderation, religion, virtue and other obviously good qualities ;
</p>
<p>but here and there Cecil's own philosophy of life comes out,
</p>
<p>and some of the reasons for his success are exhibited. " Let
</p>
<p>thy hospitality be moderate . . . rather plentiful than
</p>
<p>sparing, for I never knew any man grow poor by keeping an
</p>
<p>orderly table. . . . Beware thou spendest not more than
</p>
<p>three of four parts of thy revenue, and not above a third
</p>
<p>part of that in thy house."
</p>
<p>" Beware of being surety for thy best friends ; he that
</p>
<p>payeth another man's debts seeketh his own decay."
</p>
<p>" Be sure to keep some great man thy friend, but trouble
</p>
<p>him not with trifles ; compliment him often with many, yet

</p>
<p>small gifts."
</p>
<p>Polonius, Rizzio and Burleigh 119
</p>
<p>" Towards thy superiors be humble, yet generous ; with
</p>
<p>thine equals familiar yet respectful ; towards these inferiors
</p>
<p>show much humanity and some familiarity, as to bow the
</p>
<p>body, stretch forth the hand and to uncover the head."
</p>
<p>" Trust not any man with thy life, credit or estate, for it is
</p>
<p>mere folly for a man to entrust himself to his friend."
</p>
<p>We may compare with this Polonius ^ :
</p>
<p>" Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar.
</p>
<p>Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried.
</p>
<p>Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel ;
</p>
<p>But do not dull thy psalm with entertainment.
</p>
<p>Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
</p>
<p>Of entrance to a quarrel ; but being in,
</p>
<p>Bear't, that the opposed may beware of thee.
</p>
<p>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.
</p>
<p>' ' Neither a borrower nor a lender be.
</p>
<p>For loan oft loses both itself and friend.
</p>
<p>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry."
</p>
<p>Martin Hume sums up Burleigh's proverbs by saying :
</p>
<p>" Such maxims as these evidently enshrine much of his own
</p>
<p>temper, and throughout his career he rarely seems to have
</p>
<p>violated them. His was a selfish and ungenerous gospel,
</p>
<p>but a prudent and circumspect one."
</p>
<p>Exactly the same might be said of Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>Polonius. This particular fact, that the maxims of
</p>
<p>Polonius strongly resemble those of Burleigh was
</p>
<p>pointed out by George Russell French in 1869.
</p>
<p>Again, one observes the omnipresence of Polonius ;

</p>
<p>keeps everything in his own hands. This was certainly
</p>
<p>true also of Cecil, who had a passion for detail :
</p>
<p>" Everything seemed to pass through his hands. No matter
</p>
<p>was too small or too large to claim attention. His household
</p>
<p>biographer says of him that he worked incessantly, except
</p>
<p>at meal times when he unbent and chatted wittily to his
</p>
<p>friends, but never of business." ^
</p>
<p>Cecil had a peculiar method of drawing up documents
</p>
<p>touching matters of state : thus he would consider all
</p>
<p>the reasons for and against a particular action, stating
</p>
<p>its advantages and disadvantages in the most elaborate
</p>
<p>way and with meticulous care of detail. It is in just
</p>
<p>the same close and elaborate way that Polonius displays
</p>
<p>his ideas before the king. Everything is surveyed, not
</p>
<p>a detail omitted.^
</p>
<p>" He repulsed  a short tale to make . . .
</p>
<p>Fell into a sadness, then into a fast.
</p>
<p>Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness.
</p>
<p>Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension.
</p>
<p>Into the madness wherein now he raves.
</p>
<p>And all we mourn for."
</p>
<p>This is an admirable satire on the type of man who,
</p>
<p>like Cecil, prides himself on the logical, methodical de-
</p>
<p>velopment of detail.
</p>
<p>Cecil was emphatically a man of peace ; in politics
</p>
<p>it was his great aim to keep out of war ; in private life
</p>
<p>he disUked the idea of a military career for his son
</p>
<p>Thomas, and he was a person with whom everybody
</p>
<p>found it very difficult to quarrel ; he kept the peace
</p>
<p>with Leicester, and with Essex in spite of infinite pro-

<p>vocation .; Essex, especially, was given to taunting and
</p>
<p>tormenting him ; but, when Cecil was unable to avoid
</p>
<p>a quarrel in any other way, he was accustomed to
</p>
<p>develop a timely fit of gout, and retire to his own house.
</p>
<p>We see this same trait in Polonius who carefully
</p>
<p>advises Laertes against quarrels : " Beware of entrance
</p>
<p>to a quarrel," and who will put up with almost every-
</p>
<p>thing from Hamlet in order to avoid an overt dispute,
</p>
<p>even, as Cecil did from Essex, with the most contemptuous
</p>
<p>mocking.
</p>
<p>Cecil employed spying and eavesdropping as poHtical
</p>
<p>weapons to a quite amazing extent :
</p>
<p>" Spies and secret agents paid by him were in every court
</p>
<p>and in every camp . . . the EngHsh Catholic nobles were
</p>
<p>closely watched and for a month every line the Spanish
</p>
<p>ambassador wrote was conveyed to Cecil by Borghese. Once,
</p>
<p>early in May, the bishop's courier with important letters for
</p>
<p>the Duchess of Parma, was stopped two miles beyond Graves-
</p>
<p>end by pretended highwaymen who were really gentlemen
</p>
<p>(the brothers Cobham) in Cecil's pay, and the man was
</p>
<p>detained while the letters were sent to the Secretary to be
</p>
<p>deciphered and copied." ^
</p>
<p>The Dictionary of National Biography states the matter
</p>
<p>thus :
</p>
<p>" His life began to be threatened ; assassins were bribed
</p>
<p>to slay him and the queen : the murder of both or either, it
</p>
<p>was taught, would be something more glorious than mere
</p>
<p>justifiable homicide. Against the new doctrine and its
</p>
<p>desperate disciples it seemed to Cecil that extraordinary
</p>
<p>precautions were needed, and for the next twenty years he
</p>
<p>kept a small army of spies and informers in his pay who were
</p>
<p>his detective police, and he used it without scruple to get

<p>information when it was needed, to keep watch upon the
</p>
<p>sayings and doings of suspected characters at home and
</p>
<p>abroad. They were a vile band, and the employment of
</p>
<p>such instruments could not but bring some measure of dis-
</p>
<p>honour upon their employer."
</p>
<p>Intercepted letters and the employment of spies were,
</p>
<p>then, a quite conspicuous and notorious part of Cecil's
</p>
<p>statecraft, and they are certainly made especially
</p>
<p>characteristic of Shakespeare's Polonius. Polonius
</p>
<p>intercepts the letters from Hamlet to his daughter ;
</p>
<p>he appropriates Hamlet's most intimate correspondence,
</p>
<p>carries it to the king, and discusses it without a moment's
</p>
<p>shame or hesitation : he and the king play the eaves-
</p>
<p>dropper during Hamlet's interview with Ophelia : he
</p>
<p>himself spies upon Hamlet's interview with his mother.
</p>
<p>It is impossible not to see that these things are made
</p>
<p>both futile and hateful in Polonius, and they were precisely
</p>
<p>the things that were detested in Cecil.
</p>
<p>It is also worthy of note that Burleigh took the utmost
</p>
<p>care not to conduct marriage projects for his daughter
</p>
<p>in a way that might suggest he was using her to further
</p>
<p>his own interests.
</p>
<p>" How careful he was to avoid all cause for doubt is seen
</p>
<p>by his answer to Lord Shrewsbury's offer of his son as a
</p>
<p>husband for one of Burleigh's daughters. . . . The match
</p>
<p>proposed was a good one and the Lord Treasurer  a new
</p>
<p>noble  was flattered and pleased by the offer." ^
</p>
<p>He refused it, however, because Shrewsbury was in
</p>
<p>charge of the Queen of Scots, and he feared the suspicion
</p>
<p>of intrigues.
</p>

<p>of Essex in 1573 on behalf of his son ; but this also was
</p>
<p>declined."
</p>
<p>Cecil, in fact, was always particularly careful not to
</p>
<p>let Elizabeth or anyone else think that ambition for
</p>
<p>his daughter could tempt him into unwise poHtical
</p>
<p>plans.
</p>
<p>In exactly the same way we find Polonius guarding
</p>
<p>himself against any suspicion that he may have en-
</p>
<p>couraged Hamlet's advances to Ophelia. " The
</p>
<p>king asks ^ : " How hath she received his love ? " and
</p>
<p>Polonius enquires, " What do you think of me ? "
</p>
<p>The king replies : " As of a man faithful and honour-
</p>
<p>able " ; Polonius proceeds to explain that, such being
</p>
<p>the case, he could not possibly have encouraged the
</p>
<p>love between Hamlet and his daughter ; but he had
</p>
<p>informed the latter that she must " lock herself " from
</p>
<p>the prince.
</p>
<p>There is a further curious parallel in the fact that
</p>
<p>when Cecil's daughter  Elizabeth  married De Vere,
</p>
<p>Earl of Oxford  the husband turned sulky, separated
</p>
<p>himself from his wife, and declared that it was Cecil's
</p>
<p>fault for influencing his wife against him.
</p>
<p>" A few days later Burghley had reason to be still more
</p>
<p>angry with Oxford himself, though with his reverence for
</p>
<p>rank he appears to have treated him with inexhaustible
</p>
<p>patience and forbearance. . . . Oxford declined to meet his
</p>
<p>wife or to hold any communication with her ; Burghley
</p>
<p>reasoned, remonstrated, and besought in vain. Oxford was
</p>
<p>sulky and intractable. His wife, he said, had been influenced
</p>
<p>by her parents against him and he would have nothing more
</p>
<p>to do with her."

</p>
<p>124 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>So, also, in the drama we find Polonius interfering
</p>
<p>between his daughter and her lover, we find his machina-
</p>
<p>tions so successful that Hamlet turns sulky, and is
</p>
<p>alienated from Ophelia for good.
</p>
<p>Other significant details may be observed.
</p>
<p>Cecil was a new man, and nothing annoyed him more
</p>
<p>than to have the fact called to his attention. " The
</p>
<p>most artful of his enemies, Father Persons, well knew the
</p>
<p>weak point in his armour, and wounded him to the quick
</p>
<p>in his books, in which he pretended to show that the
</p>
<p>Lord Treasurer was of base origin, his father a tavern-
</p>
<p>keeper, and he himself a bell-ringer. We have seen in
</p>
<p>a former case that attacks upon his ancestry almost
</p>
<p>alone aroused Lord Burleigh's anger." \,
</p>
<p>Hamlet, we may remember, taunts Polonius with
</p>
<p>following a base trade, with being a fishmonger ; Polonius
</p>
<p>repudiates the idea with scorn, to which Hamlet retorts :
</p>
<p>" Then, I would you were so honest a man." 2
</p>
<p>There is probably more than one meaning here, but
</p>
<p>the most obvious is a taunt at a low origin.
</p>
<p>Again Ophelia sings songs of lamentation one of which
</p>
<p>seems obviously intended for her father. "He is dead
</p>
<p>and gone " ; she confuses him with a religious man : "his
</p>
<p>cockle hat and staff And his sandal shoon." ^
</p>
<p>Towards the end of Burleigh's life there was, apparently,
</p>
<p>a standing jest about him in the character of a religious
</p>
<p>man, a hermit.
</p>
<p>Thus, Martin Hume refers to the queen's visit to
</p>
<p>Theobalds, and to a letter presented by a man dressed
</p>
<p>as a hermit ; the letter reminded her that the last time

</p>
<p>she came " his founder, upon a strange conceit, to feed
</p>
<p>his own humour, had placed the hermit contrary to his
</p>
<p>profession in his house, whilst he (Burghley) had retired
</p>
<p>to the hermit's poor cell."
</p>
<p>Yet more curious parallels may be quoted. In a
</p>
<p>strange letter to Essex, Lord Henry Howard exults that
</p>
<p>" the dromedary that would have won the favour of the
</p>
<p>Queen of Sabez is almost enraged " (meaning Burleigh by
</p>
<p>the dromedary), and asks the earl whether " he cannot
</p>
<p>drag out the old leviathan and his cub" (meaning the
</p>
<p>two Cecils). We may surely compare this with Hamlet's
</p>
<p>conversation with Polonius :
</p>
<p>Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a
</p>
<p>camel ?
</p>
<p>Pol. By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
</p>
<p>Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
</p>
<p>Pol. It is backed like a weasel.
</p>
<p>Ham. Or like a whale ?
</p>
<p>Pol. Very like a whale. ^
</p>
<p>When we remember that Shakespeare would, in all
</p>
<p>human probability, have had access to the Essex corre-
</p>
<p>spondence shown by Essex himself, we can see the point
</p>
<p>still more strongly.
</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to show, how, in the corre-
</p>
<p>spondence of the time, such as that of Standen and
</p>
<p>Anthony Bacon, Burleigh is continually alluded to with
</p>
<p>contempt. Thus Standen writes to Anthony Bacon,
</p>
<p>March 1595, that the queen paid no heed to Burleigh,
</p>
<p>when he protested against the expedition to Cadiz :
</p>
<p>" When she saw it booted not to stay him, she said he
</p>
<p>was a ' froward old fool.' "

</p>
<p>126 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Anthony, even in his correspondence with Lady Anne
</p>
<p>Bacon, refers to Burleigh continually as " the old man."
</p>
<p>This is the general tone of Hamlet to Polonius.
</p>
<p>Burleigh seems to have done his utmost to conciHate
</p>
<p>Essex, and Anthony Bacon speaks of Burleigh's humili-
</p>
<p>ation with pleasure : " Our Earl hath made the old
</p>
<p>Fox to crouch and whine." The humiUation of Burleigh
</p>
<p>by his scornful rival was, indeed, one of the standing
</p>
<p>jests of the court.
</p>
<p>I may also quote in this connection Jonson's estimate
</p>
<p>of the character of Polonius :
</p>
<p>" Polonius is a man bred in courts, exercised in business,
</p>
<p>stored with observation, confident in his knowledge, proud
</p>
<p>of his eloquence and declining into dotage, . . . This idea
</p>
<p>of dotage encroaching upon wisdom will solve all the pheno-
</p>
<p>mena of the character of Polonius."
</p>
<p>Now, it does not seem to me possible that an Eliza-
</p>
<p>bethan audience could overlook the resemblances between
</p>
<p>Polonius and Burleigh, they are at once so wide and all-
</p>
<p>embracing and so minute and detailed.
</p>
<p>We have the fact that each is a councillor, almost
</p>
<p>supreme in his ofhce, isolated in his generation with no
</p>
<p>person of equal authority near him. Each has a passion
</p>
<p>for detail, for personal management, for analysing
</p>
<p>matters with the minutest care. Each has the habit of
</p>
<p>giving worldly-wise maxims to a son, maxims which are
</p>
<p>full of prudence but totally lacking in generosity and
</p>
<p>unselfishness, maxims which are sometimes almost word
</p>
<p>for word the same. Each has a spendthrift son, who goes

<p>the same reverence for rank, the same interest in the
</p>
<p>university and university life, the same assumption of
</p>
<p>classical scholarship, the same dishke of quarrels, the
</p>
<p>same willingness to bear insults rather than resent them.
</p>
<p>Each is insulted by being compared to various animals,
</p>
<p>a camel, a weasel, and a whale, on one side, a dromedary,
</p>
<p>a fox and a whale on the other. Each is made a public
</p>
<p>butt by a brilliant young man, by Hamlet in the one case,
</p>
<p>and by the Earl of Essex in the other.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to see how Shakespeare could have got
</p>
<p>more resemblances into the brief space at his disposal.
</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that the Cecils were the bitter
</p>
<p>enemies of Essex and his party, that it was the son of
</p>
<p>Burleigh who has supposed to have triumphed over
</p>
<p>and destroyed the unhappy Essex, and we have a motive
</p>
<p>for Shakespeare's satire of the most powerful and cogent
</p>
<p>kind.
</p>
<p>It does not seem to me particularly difficult to see
</p>
<p>what Shakespeare's method is. Burleigh was just pre-

<p>cisely one of the characters who would interest his 
</p>
<p>128 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's  audience most, and who really did
</p>
<p>present a magnificent subject for study. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, from the dramatic point of view, Burleigh had one
</p>
<p>immense disadvantage : that nothing in particular had
</p>
<p>ever happened to him, and that he died quite respectably
</p>
<p>and tranquilly in his bed. The murder of Rizzio was,
</p>
<p>however, one of the most dramatic events in recorded
</p>
<p>history ; Shakespeare, therefore, combines the character
</p>
<p>of Burleigh with the end of Rizzio. The dramatic motive
</p>
<p>for doing so is just as clear and definite as the dramatic
</p>
<p>motive for combining the parts of the two Bothwells
</p>
<p>in one, and calling them both Claudius.
</p>
<p>We have, of course, a real parallel between Rizzio and
</p>
<p>Cecil ; both were men put in a position of supreme trust
</p>
<p>and wielding immense power by secret and underhand
</p>
<p>methods ; both were regarded as unprincipled and in-
</p>
<p>triguers, and both were objects of detestation and disHke.

</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI
</p>
<p>OPHELIA
</p>
<p>I WILL turn now to another portion of the play : that
</p>
<p>connected with OpheHa. Let us note at the outset
</p>
<p>three things :
</p>
<p>(i) That there is an obvious dramatic motive for
</p>
<p>adding this love story to the play.
</p>
<p>(2) That it can hardly have any relation to the history
</p>
<p>of James I.
</p>
<p>(3) That it cannot fairly be said to be suggested by
</p>
<p>the saga source. I will deal with these points in order.
</p>
<p>(i) The dramatic motive for the addition of Ophelia's
</p>
<p>story is plain enough ; it adds greatly to the interest
</p>
<p>of Hamlet as a play, and to the interest of the prince
</p>
<p>himself as a character. Just as the addition of the
</p>
<p>story of Marguerite to that of Faust increases the value
</p>
<p>of the drama by adding pathos and tenderness to some-
</p>
<p>thing that would otherwise be too purely intellectual,
</p>
<p>so does the addition of Ophelia's story increase by its
</p>
<p>pathos the value of Hamlet.
</p>
<p>(2) Apparently, also, this portion of the play has
</p>
<p>nothing whatever to do with James I. James married,
</p>
<p>as most princes marry, in the same conventional and
</p>
<p>well-accepted way, and the only romantic circumstance
</p>
<p>connected with his marriage was the voyage to bring his
</p>
<p>bride home to Scotland, which has already been discussed.

<p>I 3-9
</p>
<p>130 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>(3) Neither does the saga give much suggestion. Saxo
</p>
<p>recounts how Amleth's enemies attempt to employ a
</p>
<p>certain woman as a decoy ; they plan that she shall entice
</p>
<p>the prince, who is pretending madness, to make love to
</p>
<p>her, and so obtain possession of his secrets ; Amleth,
</p>
<p>however, is forewarned by a friend who fastens a piece
</p>
<p>of straw to a horse-fly, and sends it past the place where
</p>
<p>Amleth lurks. Amleth detects the meaning of this
</p>
<p>somewhat fantastic device ; he drags the woman off
</p>
<p>into a remote covert where he violates her, but without
</p>
<p>revealing anything or betraying himself in any way at
</p>
<p>all. She is so deeply ashamed that she herself denies
</p>
<p>any connection between them, and the trap thus proves
</p>
<p>of no avail.
</p>
<p>The Hystorie of Hamhlet smooths out some of the
</p>
<p>worst absurdities from this narrative and says that the
</p>
<p>lady had " from her infancy loved and favoured him,"
</p>
<p>but here also she is a mere decoy to vice, outwitted and
</p>
<p>rejected.
</p>
<p>It is obvious that we are miles away from the
</p>
<p>story of Ophelia and Hamlet with all its romance and
</p>
<p>subtlety. What seems plausible is that the woman in
</p>
<p>the saga was the mere starting-point, and that all the
</p>
<p>rest is the poet's own creation. But here, again, let
</p>
<p>us refer to our standard criterion  the Elizabethan
</p>
<p>audience. Let us remember that the point from which
</p>
<p>we started was the Essex conspiracy and the Essex trial
</p>
<p>with which the subject of the Scottish succession was
</p>
<p>inseparably bound up.
</p>
<p>Would the audience think the story of Ophelia had

</p>
<p>anything to do with the Essex trial ?
</p>
<p>Ophelia 131
</p>
<p>I can only say that I feel pretty sure they would, for
</p>
<p>it shows features which have the most marked resemblances
</p>
<p>to the stories of the two heroines connected with that
</p>
<p>trial : Elizabeth Vernon, the wife of Southampton, and
</p>
<p>Lady Essex.
</p>
<p>If Shakespeare started from this point he would most
</p>
<p>certainly find there the suggestion for his love-story.
</p>
<p>We may quote a letter from Rowland White :
</p>
<p>" My lord of Southampton doth with too much familiarity
</p>
<p>court the fair Mistress Vernon, while his friends, observing
</p>
<p>the Queen's humours towards my Lord of Essex, do what
</p>
<p>they can to bring her to favour him, but in vain."
</p>
<p>Southampton's love for Elizabeth Vernon cost him the
</p>
<p>favour of the queen ; nothing would induce Elizabeth
</p>
<p>to consent to his marriage. From this time (1595)
</p>
<p>onwards Southampton's high spirit was incessantly
</p>
<p>galled; he was kept apart from the woman he loved,
</p>
<p>ordered to absent himself from Court, and continually
</p>
<p>checked in his pubUc career.
</p>
<p>We may quote the following extracts from Rowland
</p>
<p>White's letters January 14th, 1598 :
</p>
<p>" I hear my Lord of Southampton goes with Mr Secretary
</p>
<p>to France, and so onward on his travels, which course of his
</p>
<p>doth extremely grieve his mistress, that passes her time in
</p>
<p>weeping and lamenting."
</p>
<p>And again on February ist :
</p>
<p>" My Lord of Southampton is much troubled by her Majesty's
</p>
<p>strangest usage of him. Somebody hath played unfriendly

</p>
<p>parts with him. Mr Secretary hath procured him license to
</p>
<p>132 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>travel. His fair mistress doth wash her fairest face with
</p>
<p>many tears. / pray God his going away bring her to no such
</p>
<p>infirmity which is as it were hereditary to her name." February
</p>
<p>1 2th, " My Lord of Southamption is gone and hath left behind
</p>
<p>him a fair gentlewoman that hath almost wept out her fairest
</p>
<p>eyes."
</p>
<p>Shortly after Elizabeth Vernon was ordered away
</p>
<p>from Court, Chamberlain writes :
</p>
<p>" Mrs Vernon is from the Court and lies at Essex House.
</p>
<p>Some say she hath taken a venue under her girdle and swells
</p>
<p>upon it ; yet she complains not oi foul play but says My Lord
</p>
<p>of Southampton will justify it, and it is bruited underhand
</p>
<p>that he was lately here four days in great secret of purpose
</p>
<p>to marry her and effected it accordingly."
</p>
<p>The secret marriage seems to have taken place in 1598,
</p>
<p>and the queen, possibly getting to hear of it, was totally
</p>
<p>alienated from Southampton.
</p>
<p>In 1599, Essex went to Ireland ; that Shakespeare
</p>
<p>watched this venture with interest and hoped for
</p>
<p>a successful issue is proved by the open and daring
</p>
<p>reference to it in Henry V. Southampton accompanied
</p>
<p>Essex, and was made his General of Horse, but the queen
</p>
<p>commanded Essex to revoke the appointment. Soath-
</p>
<p>ampton returned to London, and continued to give great
</p>
<p>offence by absenting himself from Court and frequenting
</p>
<p>plays instead. White writes on October 19th : " My
</p>
<p>Lord Southampton and Lord Rutland come not to Court,
</p>
<p>they pass away the time in London merely in going to
</p>
<p>plays every day.*'
</p>
<p>The offence in this lay, of course, in the connection
</p>
<p>the stage was invariably supposed to have with politics.

</p>
<p>Both Essex and Southampton repeatedly offended
</p>
<p>Ophelia 133
</p>
<p>the queen by the connection they had with plays and
</p>
<p>players, just as Hamlet offended the king by his con-
</p>
<p>nection with plays and players ; if Elizabethan dramas
</p>
<p>in general, and Shakespeare's in particular, were always
</p>
<p>dealing with purely imaginary events and characters
</p>
<p>where would be the cause for the annoyance ?
</p>
<p>The candid truth is, all our evidence goes to show that
</p>
<p>the dramatists in general, and Shakespeare quite as much
</p>
<p>as the others, offended as Hamlet did in the Gonzago
</p>
<p>play.
</p>
<p>Southampton, as we have already pointed out, in
</p>
<p>disgrace at the Court, joined in the rash and foolish Essex
</p>
<p>conspiracy. Like Essex, he was condemned to death,
</p>
<p>but the sentence was commuted to perpetual imprison-
</p>
<p>ment ; this was the situation in which he lay at the time
</p>
<p>Hamlet was written, and Southampton's only hope lay
</p>
<p>in the accession of James I. ; as the Essex conspiracy
</p>
<p>was supposed to be in his favour, James might naturally
</p>
<p>be expected to set Southampton free and, as a matter
</p>
<p>of fact, it was one of the first things he did on his progress
</p>
<p>in April 1603. Chamberlain says :
</p>
<p>" the loth of this month the Earl of Southampton was
</p>
<p>delivered out of the Tower, and the King looked upon him
</p>
<p>with a smihng countenance. . . . These bountiful beginnings
</p>
<p>raise all men's spirits and put them in great hopes."
</p>
<p>Now, we can surely see a certain resemblance between
</p>
<p>these events and the love-story of Hamlet and OpheUa.
</p>
<p>There is, to begin with, the wooing with too much
</p>
<p>jamiliarity.

</p>
<p>Polonius and Laertes both complain to Ophelia that
</p>
<p>134 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>she is laying her honour too much open to suspicion.
</p>
<p>Laertes says :
</p>
<p>" weigh what loss your honour may sustain
</p>
<p>If with too credent ear you Hst his songs,
</p>
<p>Or lose your heart, or 3^our chaste treasure open
</p>
<p>To his unmaster'd importunity." ^
</p>
<p>Polonius adds :
</p>
<p>'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
</p>
<p>Given private time to you ; and you yourself
</p>
<p>Have of your audience been most free and bounteous . . .
</p>
<p>You do not understand yourself so clearly
</p>
<p>As it behoves my daughter and your honour."
</p>
<p>Elizabeth Vernon, when her honour was called in
</p>
<p>question, justified herself and her lover by declaring
</p>
<p>that he had pledged her his word ; so Ophelia justifies
</p>
<p>herself and Hamlet :
</p>
<p>" He hath importuned me with love
</p>
<p>In honourable fashion . . .
</p>
<p>And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
</p>
<p>With almost all the holy vows of heaven."
</p>
<p>Elizabeth Vernon is separated from her lover, and so
</p>
<p>is Ophelia :
</p>
<p>. . . " This is for all :
</p>
<p>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
</p>
<p>Have you so slander any moment leisure
</p>
<p>As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet."
</p>
<p>EUzabeth Vernon's love affair was made a court affair
</p>
<p>and a matter of state interference; it was discussed by
</p>
<p>everyone in a way calculated to cause agony to a sensitive
</p>
<p>soul : so is Ophelia's.
</p>
<p>Since marriage was made impossible by this cruel
</p>
<p>interference there was a very strong suspicion that

<p>1 Act I., iii.
</p>
<p>Ophelia 135
</p>
<p>Elizabeth Vernon had been seduced ; her lover went
</p>
<p>away, and in his absence she was in the deepest distress
</p>
<p>and in danger of insanity. All these things unite to
</p>
<p>make pathetic the story of Ophelia : she is under the
</p>
<p>shadow of disgrace ; Hamlet's language to her in the
</p>
<p>play scene is of the coarsest and most imprudent kind,
</p>
<p>and such as would destroy her reputation in the ears of
</p>
<p>anyone overhearing it ; the songs she herself sings in her
</p>
<p>madness suggest the same thing. Does it not look as
</p>
<p>if Shakespeare were simply carrying a step farther, and
</p>
<p>making a degree more pathetic, the events already
</p>
<p>suggested to him by his friend's story ? At any rate,
</p>
<p>the play is here, also, far and away closer to contemporary
</p>
<p>events that it is to its so-called sources.
</p>
<p>Southampton, certainly the poet's generous patron,
</p>
<p>quite possibly his best-beloved friend, was even then in
</p>
<p>the Tower, his neck in jeopardy on account of the peril
</p>
<p>brought about by this very love-story. He and his
</p>
<p>mistress were regarded as innocent unhappy beings,
</p>
<p>exasperated into disgrace by the needless persecution
</p>
<p>of a true love.
</p>
<p>Could anything be more plausible than that Shake-
</p>
<p>speare would himself be deeply and profoundly moved
</p>
<p>by their fate, and would desire to awaken sympathy
</p>
<p>with them if he could ? And, if to show his sympathy
</p>
<p>also perfects his wonderful drama, why not ?
</p>
<p>Moreover, the unity which he must consider first and
</p>
<p>foremost, is already a unity in the minds of his audience,
</p>
<p>for all these things were bound up in the most intimate
</p>
<p>and vital way with the questions of the Essex conspiracy

</p>
<p>and the Scottish Succession.
</p>
<p>136 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>With regard to the relations between Hamlet and
</p>
<p>Ophelia there can be little doubt, I think, that
</p>
<p>Shakespeare means them to be substantially innocent
</p>
<p>since they are depicted with so much sympathy ;
</p>
<p>but whether they were meant to be innocent in the
</p>
<p>literal sense of the word is quite another question.
</p>
<p>We must not allow ourselves to be misled by Victorian
</p>
<p>prudery.
</p>
<p>The suspicions of Laertes and Polonius might be ex-
</p>
<p>plained to be due to their own foulness of mind ; but
</p>
<p>Hamlet suggests the same thing by his language in the
</p>
<p>play scene, and so does Ophelia in her songs  all these
</p>
<p>things taken together imply a conclusion other than that
</p>
<p>of innocence.
</p>
<p>May it not be an essential part of Hamlet's tragedy
</p>
<p>that he and the woman he loves have genuinely yielded
</p>
<p>to temptation ?
</p>
<p>In this connection I may quote Tieck :
</p>
<p>" How much of fine observation is there in what is said of
</p>
<p>Ophelia in Goethe's ' Wilhelm Meister ' : But, if I do not
</p>
<p>entirely misunderstand Shakespeare, the poet has meant to
</p>
<p>intimate throughout the piece that the poor girl, in the
</p>
<p>ardour of her passion for the fair prince, has yielded all to
</p>
<p>him. The hints and warnings of Laertes come too late. It
</p>
<p>is tender and worthy of the great poet to leave the relation
</p>
<p>of Hamlet and Ophelia, like much else in the piece, a riddle ;
</p>
<p>but it is from this point of view alone that Hamlet's behaviour,
</p>
<p>his bitterness and Ophelia's suffering and madness, find
</p>
<p>connection and consistency."
</p>
<p>" At the acting of the play before the court, Ophelia has
</p>
<p>to endure all sorts of coarseness from Hamlet before all the
</p>
<p>courtiers ; he treats her without that respect which she
</p>

</p>
<p>appears to him to have long before forfeited."
</p>
<p>Ophelia 137
</p>
<p>I cannot help adding that our modern habit of senti-
</p>
<p>mental interpretation interferes with Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>tragedy ; if the worst happened to Ophelia it does not
</p>
<p>make her tragedy less, but only more poignant ; it makes
</p>
<p>her as overwhelmingly pathetic as Marguerite in Faust.
</p>
<p>In this connection I may point out that many critics
</p>
<p>have been puzzled by the fact that Hamlet's love for
</p>
<p>Ophelia seems to be obvious only in certain scenes of the
</p>
<p>play and not in others.
</p>
<p>Furnivall goes so far as to think that the Hamlet who
</p>
<p>was at first depicted as the lover of Opheha was very
</p>
<p>different and not as mature as the later Hamlet :
</p>
<p>" I look on it as certain that when Shakespeare began the j
</p>
<p>play he conceived Hamlet as quite a young man. But, as the |
</p>
<p>play grew, as greater weight of reflection, of insight into
</p>
<p>character, of knowledge of life, etc., was wanted, Shakespeare
</p>
<p>necessarily and naturally made Hamlet a formed man ; and
</p>
<p>by the time that he got to the grave-digger's scene, told us
</p>
<p>the prince was thirty  the right age for him, but not his age
</p>
<p>when Laertes and Polonius warned Ophelia against his blood
</p>
<p>that burned in youthful fancy for her  " a toy in the blood."
</p>
<p>The two parts of the play are inconsistent on this main point
</p>
<p>in Hamlet's state."
</p>
<p>Now, this is exactly my own point of view, only I
</p>
<p>think the discrepancy arises from the fact that Shake-
</p>
<p>speare is drawing his Hamlet from more than one original,
</p>
<p>that the character is, in fact, a composite, and that all
</p>
<p>the parts of the composite are not consistent.
</p>
<p>Another point to be noted, is that Hamlet never refers
</p>
<p>to Opheha in his soliloquies ; in these soliloquies he
</p>
<p>shows himself a good deal of a misogynist and his misogyny

</p>
<p>appears to be largely due to his mother's misconduct.
</p>
<p>138 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>but he never refers either to OpheUa's love for him, or
</p>
<p>to his for her ; in fact, he forgets all about her during
</p>
<p>the greater part of the play. This is very curious if he
</p>
<p>really cared for her so deeply.
</p>
<p>Another detail to observe lies in one of the songs sung
</p>
<p>by Ophelia ; it is a lascivious song, and concerns the
</p>
<p>meeting of two lovers as Valentines and their licentious
</p>
<p>union ; Nash wrote for Southampton a lascivious poem

<p>entitled " The Choosing of Valentines " which deals with

</p>
<p>HAMLET AND ESSEX
</p>
<p>I WILL return now to the point from which I started 
</p>
<p>the Essex trial  for it seems to me obvious that the
</p>
<p>character of Hamlet and the experiences of Hamlet
</p>
<p>include, also, a good deal suggested by Essex.
</p>
<p>Essex, we may remember, had a side of his character
</p>
<p>which was deeply studious and by nature he was a
</p>
<p>student and a soldier far more than a courtier. Francis
</p>
<p>Bacon advised him to appear " bookish and contem-
</p>
<p>plative." ^ In his Apology addressed to Anthony Bacon,
</p>
<p>Essex says :
</p>
<p>" For my infection in nature, it was indifferent to books
</p>
<p>and arms and was more inflamed with the love of know-
</p>
<p>ledge than with the love of fame. . . . Witness your rarely
</p>
<p>qualified brother . . . and my bookishness from my very
</p>
<p>childhood."
</p>
<p>Wotton, in his Reliquice, gives testimony to the same
</p>
<p>effect :
</p>
<p>"It is certain that he (Leicester) drew him (Essex) first
</p>
<p>into the fatal circle from a kind of resolved privateness
</p>
<p>at his house at Lampsie in South Wales when, after the
</p>
<p>academical life, he had taken such a taste for the rural as I
</p>
<p>have heard him say ... he could have well bent his mind
</p>
<p>to a retired course."

<p>^ Abbot, Bacon and Essex.
</p>
<p>140 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Now, here we surely see the parallel with Hamlet in
</p>
<p>the studious nature which loves retirement, and wishes
</p>
<p>to avoid the court and to live in seclusion after the
</p>
<p>university course.
</p>
<p>" Essex," says Mr Abbott, "sorely needed guidance, and,
</p>
<p>unlike many of the guideless, he knew that he needed it.
</p>
<p>Like Hamlet he was and knew that he was too liable to be
</p>
<p>* passion's slave ' and he longed for some calm, steadfast
</p>
<p>and philosophic Horatio. . . . Physically and mentally Essex
</p>
<p>was as unstable as Hamlet ... at one time outshining
</p>
<p>all his peers in the glory of the tilt-yard, at the next, sulking
</p>
<p>in solitude at Wanstead ; now the Queen's chief councillor
</p>
<p>and sole depositary of all state secrets, now again forswearing
</p>
<p>all work, neglecting all his own interests and even those of
</p>
<p>his friends ; at one moment exulting ... at another ex-
</p>
<p>claiming ' Vanitas vanitatum ' and despairing even of honour
</p>
<p>and safety. . . . His instabihty more often injured himself
</p>
<p>than his friends."
</p>
<p>Just as Essex had come reluctantly to Court from
</p>
<p>his studies, so he often desired to retire from it, and at
</p>
<p>times did so. In a letter to Lady Anne Bacon, the
</p>
<p>Earl complains : '* I live in a place where I am hourly
</p>
<p>compassed against and practised upon."
</p>
<p>Anthony Bacon accuses Cecil of tampering with his
</p>
<p>correspondence, and Essex feels ill at ease amid all this
</p>
<p>intrigue, and once more resorts to his old expedient of
</p>
<p>absenting himself from Court.
</p>
<p>" Essex," says Mr Abbott, '' was during the last years
</p>
<p>of his life, continually suffering from melancholy."
</p>
<p>Essex, also, seemed at times on the verge of insanity.
</p>
<p>" The Earl is crazed," writes Chamberlain, " but whether

</p>
<p>more in mind or body, is doubtful."
</p>
<p>Hamlet and Essex 141
</p>
<p>At his trial Essex was accused by Robert Cecil of
</p>
<p>ambition, and of aspiring to the Crown :
</p>
<p>" I have said the King of Scots was a competitor ; and
</p>
<p>you I have said are a Competitor ; you would depose the
</p>
<p>Queen, you would be King of England, and call a Parliament."
</p>
<p>Essex, in his reply, dwelt on his lack of ambition :
</p>
<p>" I have laboured and by my prayers to God earnestly
</p>
<p>desired that I might be armed with patience to endure all
</p>
<p>afflictions. . . . God which knoweth the secrets of all hearts
</p>
<p>knows that I never sought the Crown of England, nor ever
</p>
<p>wished to be a higher degree than that of subject."
</p>
<p>Now, I have already pointed out, that in the original
</p>
<p>saga, one of Hamlet's chief motives was his desire to gain
</p>
<p>the crown for himself ; in Shakespeare's play this is
</p>
<p>entirely omitted, and the hero is characterised by a
</p>
<p>complete lack of ambition, very curious in his situation,
</p>
<p>but explicable enough if Shakespeare is taking hints
</p>
<p>from somebody against whom ambition had been made
</p>
<p>a criminal charge.
</p>
<p>Speaking of the last two years of Essex's life, Mr Abbott
</p>
<p>says :
</p>
<p>" There can be no question at all that, rightly or wrongly,
</p>
<p>Essex believed that his enemies around the Queen's person
</p>
<p>were plotting the betrayal of his country as well as the ruin
</p>
<p>of himself and also that in his moods of depression and melan-
</p>
<p>choly, he thought his life to be in immediate danger."
</p>
<p>" He was at this time given to fits of gloom and despair."
</p>
<p>Harrington says of him in such a mood *' the man's
</p>
<p>soul tosseth to and fro like a troubled sea."
</p>
<p>" His irresolution," says Mr Abbott again, " bordered

</p>
<p>on the fitfulness of insanity."
</p>
<p>142 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Now here, once more, we surely have remarkable
</p>
<p>parallels to Hamlet : in the last part of the play we have
</p>
<p>Hamlet's feeling that his enemies are plotting his death,
</p>
<p>and will certainly achieve it : we have his premonition,
</p>
<p>*' But thou wouldst not think, how ill all's here about my
</p>
<p>heart." i
</p>
<p>The mind " tossing like a troubled sea," reminds us
</p>
<p>of Hamlet's own metaphor " to take arms against a sea
</p>
<p>of troubles, And by opposing end them." 2
</p>
<p>Essex, in fact, in the last year of his life, was, as Mr
</p>
<p>Abbott so justly points out, startlingly Uke Hamlet :
</p>
<p>he was irresolute almost to the point of insanity, he was
</p>
<p>surrounded by cunning enemies who plotted against his
</p>
<p>life, he had a premonition of disaster.
</p>
<p>Essex, moreover, suffered from a misery so great that
</p>
<p>he often longed for death. Thus he said at his trial :
</p>
<p>" I will not (I protest to God) speak to save my life ; for
</p>
<p>those that persecute it against me, shall do me a good turn
</p>
<p>to rid me of much misery and themselves of fear."
</p>
<p>We may compare this with Hamlet.^
</p>
<p>" To die : to sleep ;
</p>
<p>No more ; and by a sleep to say we end
</p>
<p>The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
</p>
<p>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
</p>
<p>Devoutly to be wished."
</p>
<p>Essex, on being condemned, said, as he had often done
</p>
<p>during his trial : '* My own life I do not value," but he
</p>
<p>besought mercy for the Earl of Southampton.

</p>
<p>Hamlet and Essex 143
</p>
<p>We may compare Hamlet, " I do not set my life at a
</p>
<p>pin's fee," ^
</p>
<p>Again Essex said, " I protest I do crave her Majesty's
</p>
<p>mercy with all humility ; yet I had rather die than live
</p>
<p>in misery."
</p>
<p>We have Hamlet's ^ :
</p>
<p>" For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
</p>
<p>The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, . . .
</p>
<p>When he himself might his quietus make
</p>
<p>With a bare bodkin."
</p>
<p>Essex, on hearing his sentence, said : " My Lord, I
</p>
<p>am not at all dismayed to receive this sentence, for death
</p>
<p>is far more cheerful to me than life ; and I shall die as
</p>
<p>cheerful a death as ever man did."
</p>
<p>Essex, in fact, showed emphatically during the last
</p>
<p>period of his life, the world-weariness and the life- weariness
</p>
<p>which we associate so markedly with Hamlet.
</p>
<p>John Chamberlain, writing February 21st, 1600- 1,
</p>
<p>says :
</p>
<p>" The Earl of Essex announced that he was driven to do
</p>
<p>what he did for safety of his life. . , . This was the summe
</p>
<p>of his answer, but delivered with such bravery and so many
</p>
<p>words that a man might easily perceive that, as he had ever
</p>
<p>lived popularly, so his chief care was to have a good opinion
</p>
<p>in the people's minds now at parting."
</p>
<p>We may compare this with Hamlet's intense anxiety
</p>
<p>not to leave after him ** a wounded name," and his in-
</p>
<p>junction to Horatio to " tell my story." ^

</p>
<p>144 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Malone pointed out long ago that Shakespeare in
</p>
<p>writing the last words of Horatio's farewell :
</p>
<p>" Now cracks a noble heart  Good night, sweet prince,
</p>
<p>And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,"
</p>
<p>had in his mind the last words of Essex in his prayer
</p>
<p>on the scaffold: "And when my soul and body shall
</p>
<p>part, send thy blessed angels to he near unto me which may
</p>
<p>convey it to the joys of heaven.'' We may also note that
</p>
<p>shortly after the execution there was a ballad published,
</p>
<p>entitled Essex' Last Good-night. It is a rough and doggerel
</p>
<p>production and every verse ends with the refrain of
</p>
<p>''goodnight."
</p>
<p>" He never yet hurt Mother's son,
</p>
<p>His quarrel still maintains the right,
</p>
<p>Which the tears my face down run
</p>
<p>\\Tien I think on his last Good-Night."
</p>
<p>" And life shall make amends for all
</p>
<p>For Essex bids the world 'Good-Night.' "
</p>
<p>It looks as if Shakespeare were remembering and
</p>
<p>reminding his audience of both.
</p>
<p>The whole part of Hamlet which is concerned with the
</p>
<p>players seems to me to have, in all probability, a great
</p>
<p>deal to do with Essex.
</p>
<p>Both Essex and Southampton gave repeated offence
</p>
<p>to the queen by the way in which they associated them-
</p>
<p>selves with actors and stage plays.
</p>
<p>Mr Ingram says :
</p>
<p>" At that time the Stage, to a great extent, possessed the
</p>
<p>influence which in a later age passed to the Press. Having

<p>no daily journals or other accessible means of rapid and general
</p>
<p>Hamlet and Essex 145
</p>
<p>communication on topics of common interest, the public
</p>
<p>looked to and found what it wanted in the Stage. The play
</p>
<p>supphed references to the political, religious and social events
</p>
<p>of the day. Writers and players found their profit in respond-
</p>
<p>ing to the popular feeling of their audience, and although
</p>
<p>many times fine and imprisonment rewarded their attempt
</p>
<p>to meddle with matters of state, they persisted in their
</p>
<p>efforts." 1
</p>
<p>Now it has already been pointed out that Shake-
</p>
<p>speare's company had the closest possible connection
</p>
<p>with the Essex trial through their repeated performance
</p>
<p>of Richard II., and that his connection with the play
</p>
<p>told heavily against Essex at the trial itself since the
</p>
<p>deposition scene and the death were taken as being an
</p>
<p>earnest of what he intended to do with the queen.
</p>
<p>The reader will also remember that one of the chief
</p>
<p>counts in the indictment against Essex was his patronage
</p>
<p>of Haywarde's book on Henry IV., which was supposed
</p>
<p>to contain numerous references to Elizabeth's favouritism
</p>
<p>and other objectionable features of her reign.
</p>
<p>Now surely we can see here many parallels with
</p>
<p>Hamlet. We see Hamlet treating the players with the
</p>
<p>utmost courtesy, on terms of familiarity with them,
</p>
<p>interested in their art, giving them instructions and
</p>
<p>consulting with them as to the plays they are to perform ;
</p>
<p>his connection with them is regarded \vith great suspicion
</p>
<p>by Polonius and the king (exactly as the queen objected
</p>
<p>to Essex an Scuthampton having a connection with
</p>
<p>the players), and with justice, for Hamlet does use them
</p>
<p>for political purposes exactly as Essex had used them for
</p>
<p>political purposes.

<p>K
</p>
<p>146 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Hamlet's method of dealing with the Gonzago play is
</p>
<p>exactly the method which Shakespeare had been accused
</p>
<p>of employing both in Henry IV. and Richard II. It
</p>
<p>seems to me, as I have said before, exceedingly prob-
</p>
<p>able that it was the method he used in dealing with
</p>
<p>Hamlet. He selects a story which shows a considerable
</p>
<p>likeness to the murder of his father, he accentuates that
</p>
<p>likeness, and makes it more pointed, and then, when the
</p>
<p>king is naturally full of indignation, he leaps to his feet and
</p>
<p>cries that "the story is extant," and "in choice Italian."
</p>
<p>This is probably the exact method by which Shakespeare
</p>
<p>and his fellows evaded the censor.
</p>
<p>Hamlet himself describes the players, as " the abstract
</p>
<p>and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you
</p>
<p>were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while
</p>
<p>you live." 1 Now, in what sense could they be "the abs-
</p>
<p>tract and brief chronicles of the time," if their plays
</p>
<p>dealt with bronze-age Britain, with ancient Denmark
</p>
<p>and remote Illyria, and with nothing else.
</p>
<p>Moreover, if this were the case, why should the Star
</p>
<p>Chamber concern itself so closely with both dramatists
</p>
<p>and actors. The truth is that we have overwhelm-
</p>
<p>ing evidence for the political influence of the stage,
</p>
<p>and Shakespeare and Shakespeare's company were as
</p>
<p>deeply involved as anyone.
</p>
<p>In the case of Hamlet his meddling with the Gonzago
</p>
<p>play is the thing that excites the suspicion of the king,
</p>
<p>which never afterwards slumbered ; he places his neck
</p>
<p>in jeopardy, and ultimately brings his fate upon him
</p>
<p>through this play. In exactly the same way did Essex

<p>1 Act II., ii.
</p>
<p>Hamlet and Essex 147
</p>
<p>place his neck in jeopardy, and help to bring suspicion
</p>
<p>upon himself (as his trial shows) by his connection with
</p>
<p>Richard II.
</p>
<p>All this part of Hamlet is quite obviously full of topical
</p>
<p>allusions, for Shakespeare even makes a reference to the
</p>
<p>boys, the '* little eyases " who supplanted himself and
</p>
<p>his company in the favour of the court when they were
</p>
<p>disgraced on account of this very affair.
</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that Shakespeare brings his
</p>
<p>own company in here. Hamlet asks : " What players
</p>
<p>are they ? "
</p>
<p>Ros. Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
</p>
<p>tragedians of the city.
</p>
<p>Ham. How chances it they travel ? their residence, both
</p>
<p>in reputation and profit, was better both ways,
</p>
<p>Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
</p>
<p>late innovation.
</p>
<p>Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I
</p>
<p>was in the city ? are they so followed ?
</p>
<p>Ros. No, indeed, they are not.
</p>
<p>Ham. How comes it ? do they grow rusty ?
</p>
<p>Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace ;
</p>
<p>but tliere is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry
</p>
<p>out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped
</p>
<p>for't."
</p>
<p>Now, this is one of the passages quite definitely accepted
</p>
<p>by Mr Boas and others as referring to Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>own company, and one of the passages they mainly rely
</p>
<p>upon in estimating the date of the play. But, if Shake-
</p>
<p>speare inserts his company like this into the very middle
</p>
<p>of Hamlet, what is there to prevent him from inserting
</p>
<p>also the method of himself and his company into the

</p>
<p>midst of Hamlet, and explaining it in the Gonzago play ?
</p>
<p>148 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Can we, as a matter of fact, imagine a better method of
</p>
<p>doing it, and of suggesting that Hamlet is full of historical
</p>
<p>parallels even though the story is extant already as a
</p>
<p>play.
</p>
<p>Another portion of Hamlet which seems to me to
</p>
<p>contain, in all probability, reference to Essex, is the
</p>
<p>Laertes story. There is certainly no parallel whatever
</p>
<p>to this in the original saga, but there is in the last years
</p>
<p>of the Hfe of Essex.
</p>
<p>Laertes is cunningly used by Claudius as a rival to
</p>
<p>Hamlet; he tries to destroy them by pitting them one
</p>
<p>against the other.
</p>
<p>It was in exactly the same way that Raleigh had been
</p>
<p>pitted against Essex. Mr Innes ^ says :
</p>
<p>" Old Lord Burleigh died, and a considerable portion of
</p>
<p>the story of the Queen's last years is really the story of the
</p>
<p>crafty intriguing by which Robert Cecil first urged Essex to
</p>
<p>the ruin on which he was ready enough to rush, and then laid
</p>
<p>his mines for the destruction of Raleigh while carefully
</p>
<p>avoiding the odium in both cases."
</p>
<p>Essex repeatedly stated at the time of his abortive
</p>
<p>attempt, and also during his trial, that he believed
</p>
<p>his life in danger, and that Raleigh and others had been
</p>
<p>appointed to assassinate him.
</p>
<p>Anthony Weldon states that the destruction of Essex
</p>
<p>was always counted against Robert Cecil :
</p>
<p>" Sir Robert Cecil was a very wise man, but much hated
</p>
<p>in England by reason of the fresh bleeding of that unusually
</p>
<p>beloved Earl of Essex."

<p>1 "Walter Raleigh" (in Ten Tudor Statesmen).
</p>
<p>Hamlet and Essex 149
</p>
<p>At the Essex trial Masham deposed, February loth,
</p>
<p>1601 :
</p>
<p>" I heard that Lord Essex should have been murdered,
</p>
<p>and was come guarded into London for safety. ... I met a
</p>
<p>servant of Lady Essex who told me that Cobham and Raleigh
</p>
<p>would have murdered my lord that night. . . . My lord
</p>
<p>came forth himself and declared to the people that he should
</p>
<p>have been murdered and came to them for safety. ..."
</p>
<p>So, in Hamlet, Claudius tries to employ Laertes to get
</p>
<p>rid of Hamlet in order to avoid the odium himself ; the
</p>
<p>method to be employed is that of an " envenomed foil " ;
</p>
<p>now, venom is, of course, an ever-recurring metaphor
</p>
<p>for slander, and stabbing was the exact method of death
</p>
<p>expected by Essex himself.
</p>
<p>On March 3rd, 1601, the deposition of Masham was
</p>
<p>confirmed by that of Dr Fletcher : Mr Temple said that
</p>
<p>the Earl was waylaid by Sir Walter Raleigh and his
</p>
<p>company of ruffians, and that if he went {i.e. to court),
</p>
<p>he should certainly be martyred. That he (Temple)
</p>
<p>acquainted me and others of my Lord's friends with it,
</p>
<p>that they might know how he was pursued by his enemies,
</p>
<p>meaning Sir Walter Raleigh and his company.
</p>
<p>We may remember in this connection that Raleigh
</p>
<p>was present at the death of Essex, but, for fear lest
</p>
<p>he might be accused of triumphing over him he with-
</p>
<p>drew to some distance, and saw it from the armoury
</p>
<p>only.
</p>
<p>Raleigh is said to have shed tears of compassion.
</p>
<p>During all the remainder of his life he was concerned
</p>
<p>to excuse himself from complicity.

</p>
<p>Even at his death (1618), it was the charge against
</p>
<p>150 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>him that he thought most grievous ; on the scaffold
</p>
<p>Raleigh entreated everyone to believe
</p>
<p>" that he had not been instrumental in causing the death of
</p>
<p>the Earl of Essex nor had he rejoiced thereat, as had been
</p>
<p>imported to him. On the contrary he had regretted it more
</p>
<p>than his own sins."
</p>
<p>Here, again, it is impossible not to see the parallel
</p>
<p>with Hamlet.
</p>
<p>Hamlet was written when it was still believed that
</p>
<p>Raleigh had been instrumental in the destruction of
</p>
<p>Essex ; but it was also believed that his deed was scarcely
</p>
<p>consummated before he had felt remorse. This is the
</p>
<p>exact situation of Laertes, who realises too late how he
</p>
<p>has been practised upon :
</p>
<p>" Hamlet ; Hamlet, thou art slain ;
</p>
<p>No medicine in the world can do thee good :
</p>
<p>In thee there is not half an hour of life,
</p>
<p>The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
</p>
<p>Unbated and envenomed."
</p>
<p>Sir Anthony Weldon states that it was resentment
</p>
<p>for the death of Essex which caused James, on his
</p>
<p>accession, to be so hard on Raleigh.
</p>
<p>It is probable also that the grave-digging scene owes
</p>
<p>something to the execution of Essex. It certainly owes
</p>
<p>nothing to the original saga ; in the saga Amleth returns
</p>
<p>from Britain to Jutland, and finds the court celebrating
</p>
<p>his own funeral :
</p>
<p>" Covered with filth, he entered the banquet room where
</p>
<p>obsequies were being held and struck all men utterly aghast,

</p>
<p>rumour having falsely noised about his death.
</p>
<p>Hamlet and Essex 151
</p>
<p>Before the court can recover from its astonishment
</p>
<p>Amleth gets the better of them all, and burns them to
</p>
<p>death in the banqueting hall. This is also the situation in
</p>
<p>the Historie of Hamblet.
</p>
<p>It seems possible that this feigned funeral of Hamlet
</p>
<p>may have suggested the real funeral of Ophelia; but
</p>
<p>the conception of the grave-diggers owes much more
</p>
<p>to contemporary events. Essex was so generally be-
</p>
<p>loved that the ordinary executioner refused his task; a
</p>
<p>stranger had to be found to behead the Earl, and the
</p>
<p>man bungled his task and performed it horribly ; the
</p>
<p>anger of the populace against him was so great that he
</p>
<p>dared not appear in the streets of London for fear of
</p>
<p>being lynched.
</p>
<p>Edmond Howes's continuation of Stow's Chronicle sta.ies ;
</p>
<p>"The 25 of February, being Ash-wednesday, about 8. of
</p>
<p>the clocke in the morning was the sentence of death executed
</p>
<p>upon Robert Devereux earle of Essex, within the Tower of
</p>
<p>London. . . . The hangman was beaten as hee returned
</p>
<p>thence, so that the sheriffes of London were called to assist
</p>
<p>and rescue him from such as would have murthered him."
</p>
<p>Now in Hamlet the chief point of the grave-digging
</p>
<p>scene is the way in which the ** knave " insults the remains
</p>
<p>of the dead, and the immense helplessness of the dead
</p>
<p>before these insults. The '' knave " cares nothing for
</p>
<p>the skulls, " he jowls " one to the ground as "if it were
</p>
<p>Cain's jawbone that did the first murder." He knocks
</p>
<p>another about the mazzard with his spade. It has been
</p>
<p>usual to explain the incident of Yori :k's skull as referring
</p>
<p>to the recent death of Tarleton, the great comedian of

</p>
<p>Shakespeare's company : it may be so ; but it is much
</p>
<p>152 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>more probable that the mcident refers to Essex ; Tarleton
</p>
<p>was certainly not executed, and no one has ever told us
</p>
<p>that his dead body was insulted, whereas Yorick's skull
</p>
<p>must be severed from his body, since Hamlet takes it
</p>
<p>in his hands. Moreover, Yorick's skull is certainly in-
</p>
<p>sulted ; as acted on the stage the clown usually strikes
</p>
<p>it as he strikes the others. Yorick is described as the
</p>
<p>" king's jester," " a fellow of infinite jest," " of most
</p>
<p>excellent fancy " ; and Essex had been one of the most
</p>
<p>brilhant and the wittiest of all the courtiers.
</p>
<p>Take, moreover, the language in which Hamlet
</p>
<p>addresses the skull when he says : " Get you to my lady's
</p>
<p>chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
</p>
<p>favour she must come ; make her laugh at that."
</p>
<p>This surely has no suggestion of Tarleton ; but it is
</p>
<p>most gruesome and terrible if it apphes to Essex ; it
</p>
<p>reminds us of the famous incident when, on his return
</p>
<p>from Ireland, Essex rushed into the presence of his
</p>
<p>queen, and found her at her toilet  probably dishevelled
</p>
<p>and painting, an incident which was supposed to have
</p>
<p>had a most untoward effect upon his fate. An imagina-
</p>
<p>tion worthy of Dante to make the skull of the victim
</p>
<p>interrupt once again at the toilette !
</p>
<p>Here, also, we probably find the reason for comparing
</p>
<p>the skull to that of Alexander's. Where would be the
</p>
<p>point of comparing Tarleton's skull to Alexander's, or
</p>
<p>his dust to that of " imperious Caesar " ; but there is
</p>
<p>real point in comparing that of Essex, for Essex had been
</p>
<p>one of the most daring and brilliant soldiers of his day.
</p>
<p>The exploit of Essex against Cadiz was a most brilliant

</p>
<p>feat of arms in which, like Alexander, he had ventured
</p>
<p>Hamlet and Essex 153
</p>
<p>almost single-handed, into a hostile city ; like Alexander,
</p>
<p>Essex had travelled widely, and met his enemies in distant
</p>
<p>lands and, like him, he too perished in his youth. Rash-
</p>
<p>ness was the quality of both, rashness and brilliance
</p>
<p>and an early death. Hamlet compares Yorick's skull
</p>
<p>to Alexander's : " Dost thou think Alexander looked o'
</p>
<p>this fashion i' the earth?" and again, "Why may not
</p>
<p>imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he
</p>
<p>find it stopping a bung-hole."
</p>
<p>"Essex," says Mr Abbott, "was acknowledged, though on
</p>
<p>insufficient grounds no doubt, to be the ablest general in
</p>
<p>England ; it was precisely because he was acknowledged to
</p>
<p>be the ablest general that he was sent to Ireland."
</p>
<p>We may compare, also, the contemporary pamphlet,
</p>
<p>Honour in Perfection, by G. M., usually attributed to
</p>
<p>Gervase Marklam, which deals with the house of Essex :
</p>
<p>" The noble world is but a Theatre of Renoune, the Tongues
</p>
<p>of all people make up but the Trumpet which speaks them,
</p>
<p>and it is Eternitie itself which shall keep them unto ever-
</p>
<p>lasting memorie,"
</p>
<p>Moreover, Essex himself had been haunted by the
</p>
<p>dread of ignominy to his body if he died the death of
</p>
<p>a traitor, and had repeatedly spoken of it ; even before
</p>
<p>he came into open revolt he had been conscious of
</p>
<p>exposure to low-minded insults.
</p>
<p>I quote the most pertinent extracts ; thus, in a letter
</p>
<p>written to the queen dated May 20th, 1600, Essex says
</p>
<p>of himself that he feels
</p>
<p>" as if I were thrown into a corner like a dead carcass, I am

<p>upon earth. The tavern-haunter speaks of me what he lists.
</p>
<p>Already they print me and make me speak to the world, and
</p>
<p>shortly they will print me in what forms they list upon the
</p>
<p>stage." ^
</p>
<p>Now, surely we have here remarkable parallels to
</p>
<p>the grave-digging scene ; Yorick's skull is thrown into
</p>
<p>a corner, it is " gnawed upon " by the vilest of creatures ;
</p>
<p>the clown is a tavern-haunter, for he sends his boy for
</p>
<p>a " stoup of liquor " even over his work, thus bringing the
</p>
<p>dead insulted bodies into the closest connection with
</p>
<p>the tavern.
</p>
<p>Moreover, as we see, Essex was confident that he would
</p>
<p>be represented on the stage and, if so, why might not
</p>
<p>Shakespeare represent him and defend him ?
</p>
<p>Shakespeare might have seen this very letter before
</p>
<p>it was sent ; there is no reason why he should not.
</p>
<p>On receiving sentence, Essex said :
</p>
<p>" And I think it fitting that my poor quarters, which have
</p>
<p>done her Majesty true service in divers parts of the world,
</p>
<p>should now at last be sacrificed and disposed of at her Majesty's
</p>
<p>pleasure."
</p>
<p>Compare this with Hamlet's bitter irony :
</p>
<p>" Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,
</p>
<p>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away." ^
</p>
<p>We may compare the declaration of the treasons
</p>
<p>uttered by a certain Abraham Colfe referring to Essex ^ :
</p>
<p>" He commended a great general of the wars lately dead
</p>
<p>whom he called Veri Dux, extolling most highly his infancy,

<p>young years, and man's age, his embracing of learned men

</p>
<p>and warriors, who all followed him without pay. He named
</p>
<p>the journey to Cadiz, his forwardness there and felicity, and
</p>
<p>how men looked on his returning " tanquam in solem oc-
</p>
<p>cidentum." . . . After his coming home he was " pessime
</p>
<p>tractatus, quia cum esset imperator imperata non fecerit, " . . .
</p>
<p>His virtue which drew upon him the envy of great personages
</p>
<p>was the cause of his overthrow.
</p>
<p>"... His enemies accused him of aspiring to a kingdom. . . .
</p>
<p>He showed how the executioners had three strokes at his
</p>
<p>head, that his very enemies could not choose but weep when
</p>
<p>they saw his head cut off. . . . His conclusion was. "You
</p>
<p>have heard of the life and death of a worthy general."
</p>
<p>Surely, we have here the same train of thought as in
</p>
<p>Shakespeare ; the insulted dead, the shamed and humili-
</p>
<p>ated dust and the " great general," so great that he is
</p>
<p>compared to an emperor and the leader of his country.
</p>
<p>History does not record that the dust of Alexander
</p>
<p>" stopped a bung-hole," or that the dust of Ceesar
</p>
<p>" patched a hole to expel the winter's flaw " ; but pro-
</p>
<p>found humiUation certainly happened to the dust of
</p>
<p>Essex.
</p>
<p>Remember that the execution of Essex was still the
</p>
<p>grief of the whole country when Hamlet was played, and
</p>
<p>let us ask ourselves what Shakespeare's audience would
</p>
<p>be likely to think.
</p>
<p>Another point to notice is that, before his death, Essex
</p>
<p>most passionately desired reconciliation with those whom
</p>
<p>he had esteemed his enemies. He professed to bear no
</p>
<p>malice to Lord Cobham and Sir Walter Raleigh and, as
</p>
<p>already quoted,^ the latter is said to have shed tears when
</p>
<p>he witnessed the execution of Essex.

</p>
<p>We may compare the reconciliation of Hamlet and
</p>
<p>Laertes.
</p>
<p>" Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet ;
</p>
<p>Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
</p>
<p>Nor thine on me,"
</p>
<p>and Hamlet's reply :
</p>
<p>" Heaven make thee free of it." ^
</p>
<p>Laertes is stabbed by the " envenomed foil " prepared
</p>
<p>for Hamlet, and, as he himself says :
</p>
<p>" I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery."
</p>
<p>So was Raleigh destroyed by the same methods of slander
</p>
<p>which he had himself employed against Essex.
</p>
<p>I turn now to an incident which has always puzzled
</p>
<p>commentators : the fight between Hamlet and Laertes
</p>
<p>in the grave.
</p>
<p>Campbell points out that Hamlet's love for Ophelia
</p>
<p>only seems to occur in certain portions of the play and
</p>
<p>that, for instance, the burial scene seems to show an
</p>
<p>almost complete absence of it :
</p>
<p>" Had it been in the mind of Shakespeare to show Hamlet in
</p>
<p>the agony of hopeless despair he must at that moment have
</p>
<p>been, had Ophelia been all in all to hhn ... is there in all
</p>
<p>his writings so utter a failure in the attempt to give vent to
</p>
<p>an overwhelming passion ? ... It seems not a little un-
</p>
<p>accountable that Hamlet should have been so slightly affected
</p>
<p>by her death."
</p>
<p>Campbell points out that Hamlet's real motive in
</p>
<p>leaping into the grave appears to be, not love for Ophelia

<p>Hamlet and Essex 157
</p>
<p>at all, but rivalry with Laertes  a very different passion.
</p>
<p>Campbell continues :
</p>
<p>" When Hamlet leaps into the grave do we see in that
</p>
<p>any power of love ? I am sorry to confess that to me the
</p>
<p>whole of that scene is merely painful. It is anger with
</p>
<p>Laertes, not love for OpheHa, that makes Hamlet leap into
</p>
<p>the grave. Laertes' conduct, he tells us afterwards, put hun
</p>
<p>into a towering passion  a state of mind which it is not easy
</p>
<p>to reconcile with any kind of sorrow for the dead Ophelia.
</p>
<p>But had he been attempting to describe the behaviour of an
</p>
<p>impassioned lover at the grave of his beloved I should be
</p>
<p>compelled to feel that he had not merely departed from
</p>
<p>nature, but that he had offered her the most profane violation
</p>
<p>and insult."
</p>
<p>It seems to me that this fight in the grave may perhaps
</p>
<p>be best interpreted as symbolic. The whole Elizabethan
</p>
<p>age was passing away ; its glories were decaying and
</p>
<p>most of its great men were already dead ; of those who
</p>
<p>remained, the most distinguished  Essex and Raleigh 
</p>
<p>were flying at each other's throats, eager to destroy each
</p>
<p>other ; their queen was the shadow of herself, anyone
</p>
<p>knew she might die at any moment, and it was precisely
</p>
<p>over the question of her succession that the most violent
</p>
<p>quarrels broke out. The clown when first asked for
</p>
<p>whom the grave was made replies that it is for no man or
</p>
<p>no woman neither, and a little later on explains : " One
</p>
<p>that was a woman, sir, but, rest her soul, she's dead."
</p>
<p>It may be meant to symbolise the burial of a whole age.
</p>
<p>Hamlet and Laertes both profess that their motive for
</p>
<p>the quarrel in the grave is their love for Ophelia, and
</p>
<p>they '' outface " each other in their professions of affection

</p>
<p>to her, the result being this disgraceful insult to her
</p>
<p>158 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>memory. Surely if it is meant as a symbol it is terribly
</p>
<p>appropriate, the last great Elizabethans destroying each
</p>
<p>other over the very body of their mistress, all the time
</p>
<p>professing their love, and a crafty enemy taking advan-
</p>
<p>tage of their quarrel to destroy them both. I can see no
</p>
<p>reason why Shakespeare should not introduce, at least, an
</p>
<p>element of symbolism into his plays ; the greatest of his
</p>
<p>predecessors  Spenser  wrote a poem which is one mass
</p>
<p>of symbolism ; symbolism was one of the chief methods
</p>
<p>in the religious drama which preceded Shakespeare's,
</p>
<p>and in one of his chief dramatic predecessors  Lyly.
</p>
<p>Another scene which may possibly have been suggested
</p>
<p>by the Essex story is the casket scene between Hamlet
</p>
<p>and Ophelia when Ophelia returns the casket of his
</p>
<p>letters, declaring that they were love letters, and Hamlet
</p>
<p>is immediately enraged, and suspects her honesty.
</p>
<p>We learn from the State Papers} that the Countess of
</p>
<p>Essex had been used as an instrument to betray her
</p>
<p>husband. In June 1601, there was a long examination
</p>
<p>in the Star Chamber concerning a casket of letters which
</p>
<p>the Countess of Essex had entrusted to a certain Jane
</p>
<p>Daniells who had also been her gentlewoman.
</p>
<p>" Jane's husband stole a number of the letters to have
</p>
<p>them copied. , . .
</p>
<p>" The countess was greatly afraid that the Earl would be
</p>
<p>angry with her for suffering his long and passionate love-letters
</p>
<p>to be spread abroad . . . she swore they were not dangerous.
</p>
<p>. . . Daniells demanded three thousand pounds to give them
</p>
<p>back and the Countess was forced to sell her jewels. . . .
</p>
<p>" At the time of the Earl's arraignment he pretended that

</p>
<p>the aforementioned letters had been stolen and counterfeited
</p>
<p>by his adversaries. . . .
</p>
<p>" The Court, pitying the Countess, . . , cleared her from all
</p>
<p>suspicion of any ill intention towards her late husband."
</p>
<p>Here, again, wc surely have close parallels. Hamlet's
</p>
<p>love-letters to Ophelia are intercepted and stolen;
</p>
<p>Hamlet asserts that he never gave her anything, while
</p>
<p>she asserts that he did, but that the gifts were love-letters
</p>
<p>and jewels; moreover, this very casket scene is used
</p>
<p>as a means to decoy Hamlet into the hands of his enemies,
</p>
<p>and Ophelia is the innocent and unwilling instrument,
</p>
<p>overwhelmed with distress by Hamlet's anger.
</p>
<p>The parallel is, once again, suspiciously close, and this
</p>
<p>also is a scene which has no parallel whatever in the
</p>
<p>so-called literary source.
</p>
<p>We may observe that OpheUa's description of her
</p>
<p>lover stands out sharply from the Hamlet of much of
</p>
<p>the play, the Hamlet who resembles James I., though
</p>
<p>OpheUa's description of her lover would serve admir-
</p>
<p>ably for the Earl of Essex. She expressly tells us that
</p>
<p>the Hamlet she had loved was both a " courtier " and
</p>
<p>" a soldier."
</p>
<p>" O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown !

<p>The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword :
</p>
<p>The expectancy and rose of the fair state.
</p>
<p>The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
</p>
<p>The observed of all observers, quite, quite, down ! "
</p>
<p>When was the Hamlet of the rest of the play a soldier ?
</p>
<p>Does he not expressly dislike bloodshed ?

</p>
<p>How can he have been a courtier when he so ex-
</p>
<p>i6o Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>pressly despises all the tricks of courtiers ? How can
</p>
<p>he have been the " glass of fashion," and the " mould

<p>of form," when he thoroughly despised dress and
</p>
<p>habiliments ?
</p>
<p>How can he have been the " observed of all ob-

<p>the privacy of study ? How can he have been " un-
</p>
<p>matched in form and feature ' ' when, according to his
</p>
<p>own mother, he was " fat and scant of breath."
</p>
<p>Ophelia's lover is so different from the Hamlet of
</p>
<p>most of the play as to suggest that he really was a
</p>
<p>different person, which is confirmed by the fact that
</p>
<p>this Hamlet forgets all about her, and never even refers
</p>
<p>to her in his soliloquies.
</p>
<p>Mr Bradley gives an admirable summary of this curious
</p>
<p>indifference from which I quote a portion :
</p>
<p>(i) How is it that, in his first soliloquy, Hamlet makes
</p>
<p>no reference whatever to Ophelia ?
</p>
<p>(2) How is it that, in his second soliloquy, on the
</p>
<p>departure of the ghost, he again says nothing about her ?
</p>
<p>(5) In what way are Hamlet's insults to Ophelia at
</p>
<p>the play scene necessary either to his purpose of con-
</p>
<p>vincing her of his insanity or to his purpose of revenge ?
</p>
<p>(6) How is it that neither when he kills Polonius,
</p>
<p>nor afterwards, does he reflect that he has killed
</p>
<p>OpheHa's father, or what the effect on Opheha is likely
</p>
<p>to be?

</p>
<p>Ophelia, and at his death he says nothing of her.
</p>
<p>It seems to me that these facts are practically impossible
</p>
<p>to explain if Hamlet is to be interpreted as psychology ;
</p>
<p>but if it is to be interpreted as mainly historical they
</p>
<p>are simple enough. We may compare with Ophelia's
</p>
<p>description of her lover, the description of Essex appended
</p>
<p>to the account of his trial in 1649 :
</p>
<p>" There sleeps great Essex, darling of Mankind,
</p>
<p>Fair Honour's lamp, foul envie's prey, Art's fame.
</p>
<p>Nature's pride, Virtue's bulwark, lure of Mind,
</p>
<p>Wisdom's flower, Valour's tower, Fortune's Shame,
</p>
<p>England's Sun, Belgia's light, France's star, Spain's thunder
</p>
<p>Lisbon's lightning, Ireland's cloud, the whole world's
</p>
<p>wonder."
</p>
<p>Here we have all the characteristics of Ophelia's lover :
</p>
<p>we have the courtier, the soldier and the scholar, the
</p>
<p>model for the whole world, and the flower of beauty
</p>
<p>as well.
</p>
<p>There still remains for remark one portion of the death-
</p>
<p>scene of Hamlet ; that concerning the arrival of Fortin-
</p>
<p>bras as heir to the kingdom, accompanied by his army.
</p>
<p>There is nothing whatever to explain this either in Saxo
</p>
<p>Grammaticus or in the Hystorie of Hamblet ; there could
</p>
<p>not be, as in both these accounts Hamlet himself takes
</p>
<p>the crown. Neither is there anything whatever in
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's Hamlet which explains why Fortinbras
</p>
<p>should be the heir. At the beginning of the play we
</p>
<p>are told by Horatio that Fortinbras lays claim to " certain

</p>
<p>lands" which his father had lost to the elder Hamlet,
</p>
<p>and was, therefore, threatening Denmark with war,^ but
</p>
<p>Horatio never suggests that Fortinbras is, in any sense
</p>
<p>whatever, the heir of Denmark. Why should he be?
</p>
<p>He belongs to Norway, and not a hint is given us as to
</p>
<p>any legal or dynastic claim he may have on Denmark.
</p>
<p>Yet, in the last scene, Hamlet acknowledges him as his
</p>
<p>true successor.
</p>
<p>Surely all this is very strange. The clue seems to me
</p>
<p>to be found once again in historical events.
</p>
<p>It seems to have been an essential part of the Essex
</p>
<p>plot that James should be ready to support his claim
</p>
<p>to the succession by force of arms.
</p>
<p>Mr John Bruce says 2 :
</p>
<p>" It seems clear that Essex had been in correspondence
</p>
<p>with James ever since 1598. . . . Montjoy in the depth of
</p>
<p>his solicitude, . . . sent his Scottish Majesty a ' project,'
</p>
<p>the effect of which was that James should prepare an army,
</p>
<p>should march at the head of it to the borders and there ful-
</p>
<p>minate a demand to the English government of an open
</p>
<p>declaration to the right of the succession, should support the
</p>
<p>demand by sending an ambassador into England, and of
</p>
<p>course, although not so stated, if his demand were refused,
</p>
<p>should cross the borders as an invader. ..."
</p>
<p>James was greatly grieved by the fate of Essex, and
</p>
<p>termed him his martyr. As early as November 1599,
</p>
<p>when under the influence of Essex, James procured to
</p>
<p>be suggested to his principal nobility of Scotland, that
</p>
<p>they should enter into a league or " Band " for the pre-
</p>
<p>servation of his person and the pursuit of his right to

<p>the crowns of England and Ireland. Such an engagement
</p>
<p>was willingly entered into. . . .
</p>
<p>He also solicited from his parliament ... a liberal
</p>
<p>grant for warlike purposes in reference to the succession.
</p>
<p>"He was not certain," he told them, "how soon he
</p>
<p>should have to use arms ; but whenever it should be, he
</p>
<p>knew his right and would venture crown and all for
</p>
<p>it. . . . The ' Band ' of the nobles was sufficiently well-
</p>
<p>known in England."
</p>
<p>I have already quoted Malone to the effect that the
</p>
<p>last words of Horatio over Hamlet are the dying words
</p>
<p>of Essex. Let us refer to the last words of Hamlet
</p>
<p>himself :
</p>
<p>" I cannot live to hear the news from England ;
</p>
<p>But I do prophesy the election lights
</p>
<p>On Fortinbras : he has my dying voice ;
</p>
<p>So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less.
</p>
<p>Which have solicited. The rest is silence."
</p>
<p>Surely it would be hardly possible to dramatise the
</p>
<p>situation more closely ? We have the heir who belongs
</p>
<p>to another kingdom altogether a more northern one
</p>
<p>who is entering to make good his right at the head of his
</p>
<p>army. We must remember that, when Hamlet was
</p>
<p>written, it was still thought that such an armed in-
</p>
<p>tervention might be necessary. Hamlet cannot live, as
</p>
<p>Essex could not live, to " hear the news from England " ;
</p>
<p>but he prophesies that the "election" will light on
</p>
<p>Fortinbras and, in any case, he gives his " dying voice "
</p>
<p>for him. Fortinbras commands that Hamlet's body
</p>
<p>shall be placed " on a stage," a curious detail in itself,

<p>CHAPTER VIII
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION
</p>
<p>And now, what is our main conclusion to be ? It seems
</p>
<p>to me absolutely certain that the historical analogues
</p>
<p>exist ; that they are important, numerous, detailed and
</p>
<p>undeniable. There are, however, three possible ex-
</p>
<p>planations as to how they get in the play :
</p>
<p>(i) We may say that they belong to the " atmo-
</p>
<p>sphere " of the time and get in unconsciously.
</p>
<p>Shakespeare sees these things around him, and
</p>
<p>without knowing it, incorporates them in his
</p>
<p>drama.
</p>
<p>(2) Shakespeare is writing a literary drama in which
</p>
<p>he incorporates a certain amount of contem-
</p>
<p>porary history deliberately and of set purpose.
</p>
<p>(3) Shakespeare is writing what is practically a piece
</p>
<p>of mythology ; it consists mainly of contem-
</p>
<p>porary history only fitted in to a dramatic
</p>
<p>frame.
</p>
<p>Now, it appears to me that (i) may be rejected ab-
</p>
<p>solutely : the historical resemblances are so important
</p>
<p>on the one hand, so numerous, detailed and close on the
</p>
<p>other, that it does not seem to me they can have got in
</p>
<p>by any form of accident ; when we reflect, moreover,
</p>
<p>that they were all events of immediate interest the sup-
</p>
<p>position is practically impossible

</p>
<p>1 66 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>To me the only choice lies between (2) and (3). I
</p>
<p>leave it to each reader to decide as to which alternative
</p>
<p>seems the more likely.
</p>
<p>One thing seems, at any rate, absolutely certain, that
</p>
<p>Shakespeare is using a large element of contemporary
</p>
<p>history in Hamlet.
</p>
<p>It appears to me that in the total construction of the
</p>
<p>play, the literary source is comparatively unimportant,
</p>
<p>and the historical source exceedingly important.
</p>
<p>All the things that give us the essence of the Shake-
</p>
<p>spearean drama are really historical ; the secret murder,
</p>
<p>the use of poison, the voice of accusation heard in the
</p>
<p>night, the graphic representation reproducing the murder,
</p>
<p>the crucial character of Hamlet himself with his hesitancy
</p>
<p>and his reluctance to punish  the centre of the whole
</p>
<p> the character of Claudius and his attitude towards
</p>
<p>Hamlet, the murder of Polonius, the character of Polonius,
</p>
<p>Hamlet's relation to the Players, the treatment of the
</p>
<p>Play which brings Hamlet's own neck into jeopardy,
</p>
<p>the love-story of Ophelia, the casket motive, the madness
</p>
<p>motive, the rivalry between Hamlet and Laertes, the
</p>
<p>way in which they are pitted against each other so that
</p>
<p>both may be destroyed, the grave-digger's scene, the fight
</p>
<p>in the grave, the entrance of Fortinbras  for all these
</p>
<p>no analogues can be found in the saga source (either
</p>
<p>Saxo or Belief orest), and very minute and close analogues
</p>
<p>can be found in the contemporary history of most
</p>
<p>immediate interest.
</p>
<p>The Essex conspiracy and the Scottish succession
</p>
<p>were the questions of burning interest at the time, any

</p>
<p>audience would be certain to feel their appeal and
</p>
<p>Conclusion 167
</p>
<p>Shakespeare himself, as I have shown, had a double reason
</p>
<p>for a strong personal interest.
</p>
<p>These events involved the fate of his dramatic company
</p>
<p>which was compromised by its connection with the
</p>
<p>Essex conspiracy and involved the fate of the man who
</p>
<p>was certainly his patron and possibly his dearest friend
</p>
<p> Southampton  and who was even then in danger of
</p>
<p>death. Shakespeare desired to write about these
</p>
<p>subjects, and he did write about them, only he called
</p>
<p>them something else.
</p>
<p>We have good reasons for believing that this method
</p>
<p>was fairly often followed.
</p>
<p>(i) The authorities continually suspected the players
</p>
<p>of introducing political motives into their plays.
</p>
<p>(2) Dr Haywarde was accused of having turned
</p>
<p>Henry IV. into a contemporary parallel.
</p>
<p>(3) Shakespeare's company were accused of having
</p>
<p>done the same thing in Richard 11. ; Shakespeare's own
</p>
<p>play.
</p>
<p>(4) Shakespeare himself has shown us in Hamlet's
</p>
<p>treatment of the Gonzago play both how it could be
</p>
<p>done, and how dangerous it was to do it.
</p>
<p>It seems to me that Shakespeare selected the Amleth
</p>
<p>saga in almost precisely the spirit in which Hamlet
</p>
<p>selected the Gonzago story. The Amleth story was
</p>
<p>sufficiently well-known to be excellent as a disguise, it
</p>
<p>was sufficiently remote to place no restrictions upon his
</p>
<p>handling, he was free to modify it as much as he chose,
</p>
<p>and he did modify it till there was hardly any of the
</p>
<p>original left.

</p>
<p>It is not, I think, in the least difficult to see how
</p>
<p>i68 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Shakespeare would naturally arrive at such a method
</p>
<p>of construction.
</p>
<p>We cannot, I think, postulate with certainty many
</p>
<p>things concerning him, but there are two we do certainly
</p>
<p>know : one is that he was a man intensely interested
</p>
<p>in human nature as such, from the statecraft of kings
</p>
<p>and princes down to the ways of ostlers baiting their
</p>
<p>horses at an inn ; the second is that, as shown by such
</p>
<p>passages as the speech of Henry V. before Agincourt and
</p>
<p>the dying speech of John of Gaunt in Richard 11. , Shake-
</p>
<p>speare must have been an intensely patriotic Englishman.
</p>
<p>Such a man would naturally commence his career
</p>
<p>by attempting to dramatise history, a course which would
</p>
<p>gratify at once his love of reality and his patriotism.
</p>
<p>This is exactly what Shakespeare did in the long series
</p>
<p>of the historical dramas.
</p>
<p>However, in the course of writing these dramas, he
</p>
<p>must have discovered that the choice of historical material
</p>
<p>unduly fettered his genius. Even in the historical dramas
</p>
<p>themselves Shakespeare is impelled to take great liberties
</p>
<p>both with chronology and with character.
</p>
<p>Thus he alters considerably the age of Harry Percy
</p>
<p>to make him more clearly a rival to Prince Hal. In
</p>
<p>the second part of Henry IV., also, the chronology is very
</p>
<p>curiously changed so as to convey the impression that
</p>
<p>the events occupy very much less space of time than they
</p>
<p>actually did occupy.^ The space of eight years must elapse
</p>
<p>between the different portions of Act IV., but the impres-
</p>
<p>sion given by the play is certainly that of a few days only.

</p>
<p>Conclusion 169
</p>
<p>Nor is chronology the only difficulty. In history,
</p>
<p>the interest is too much diffused and is dissipated over
</p>
<p>too large a number of characters and incidents ; it is
</p>
<p>distracted instead of being concentrated, and Shake-
</p>
<p>speare continually allows the dramatic stress to fall where
</p>
<p>the historic stress does not fall or would not naturally
</p>
<p>fall.
</p>
<p>Moreover, it is possible that even here he allows himself
</p>
<p>to be deflected or, at least, influenced by contemporary
</p>
<p>events. Why, for example, is Falconbridge the real
</p>
<p>hero of King John ?
</p>
<p>This is hardly true to the history of that reign even
</p>
<p>as the Elizabethans conceived it.
</p>
<p>It has often been suggested that the prominence given
</p>
<p>to Falconbridge owes something to Shakespeare's sym-
</p>
<p>pathy for Sir John Perrot. Perrot, also, was the illegiti-
</p>
<p>mate son of a king, a soldier, a patriot, a man whose
</p>
<p>blunt speech got him into trouble.
</p>
<p>In 1592 he was tried for high treason, and condemned
</p>
<p>to death, though his death in the Tower forestalled his
</p>
<p>execution.
</p>
<p>This may, or may not, be the true motive for the
</p>
<p>prominence given to Falconbridge; but whatever the
</p>
<p>motive, there can be no doubt that Shakespeare lays the
</p>
<p>dramatic stress where the historic stress would not
</p>
<p>naturally fall.
</p>
<p>In the two parts of Henry IV., the same tendency is
</p>
<p>accentuated, for there is no doubt that the dramatic stress
</p>
<p>falls upon the character of Falstaff who certainly did
</p>
<p>not bear the historic stress ; if we change the name to

</p>
<p>Oldcastle, the prominence given is less extraordinary,
</p>
<p>170 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>though still remarkable. Even here, it is probable that
</p>
<p>the desire to annoy Cobham, the Puritan persecutor of
</p>
<p>the stage and one of Essex's chief enemies, was a leading
</p>
<p>motive. At any rate, Cobham took it so ; he complained,
</p>
<p>the name was altered, and Shakespeare inserted an
</p>
<p>apology to the effect, " Oldcastle died a martyr, and this
</p>
<p>is not the man."
</p>
<p>Both here and in the case of Falconbridge, it seems
</p>
<p>probable that we have contemporary events influencing
</p>
<p>even the case of the definitely historical dramas and
</p>
<p>producing a deflection of the historic stress. This was
</p>
<p>certainly the method the authorities suspected both in
</p>
<p>Henry IV. and in Richard II.
</p>
<p>And now let us ask what a dramatist who arrived
</p>
<p>at this point in his artistic development would be likely
</p>
<p>to do ? He has an immense love for reality, he wishes
</p>
<p>to describe real life as it is actually lived ; his audience
</p>
<p>take an intense interest in the personaHties and poHtics
</p>
<p>of the time, and having no newspapers, are particularly
</p>
<p>anxious to see them discussed upon the stage ; also the
</p>
<p>poet is patriotic, and wishes to deal with questions of
</p>
<p>national importance. On the other hand, h6 has dis-
</p>
<p>covered that history, as it is actually Hved, is not really
</p>
<p>a good subject for dramatic treatment because its interest
</p>
<p>is too much diffused and its subject is too inelastic. Even
</p>
<p>if it were good material, which it is not, there remains
</p>
<p>the unvarying difficulty of the censorship which forbids
</p>
<p>him to make political references and has already, in
</p>
<p>Henry IV. and Richard II., protested against his doing
</p>
<p>so.

</p>
<p>The obvious expedient is surely to take historic material,
</p>
<p>Conclusion 171
</p>
<p>preferably those contemporary events in which he and
</p>
<p>his audience are most interested, and to alter them until
</p>
<p>they become good dramatic material, concentrating the
</p>
<p>interest, missing out all that cannot be got into a dramatic
</p>
<p>frame or which is irrelevant.
</p>
<p>In this way a really excellent drama could be built
</p>
<p>up, only it would not be historic in the ordinary
</p>
<p>sense of the term ; the poet might, therefore, call it by
</p>
<p>another name ; in that case he would gain two great
</p>
<p>advantages.
</p>
<p>(i) He would be able to modify the history as much
</p>
<p>as necessary to suit his artistic purpose. (2) He would
</p>
<p>be able to deal with contemporary events without falling
</p>
<p>under the ban of the censorship.
</p>
<p>If this plan were followed, the first necessity would,
</p>
<p>of course, be to choose a novel or story whose outHne
</p>
<p>resembled the one desired, and then to modify it freely
</p>
<p>just as Dr Haywarde was accused of doing in the case
</p>
<p>of Henry IV., and just as Hamlet did in the Gonzago
</p>
<p>play. 
</p>
<p>As we have seen, it was a main count in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment against Essex that he had allowed and connived
</p>
<p>at this method of procedure, both in Haywarde's history
</p>
<p>and in Shakespeare's play of Richard II. Essex and
</p>
<p>Southampton, like Hamlet, both damaged themselves
</p>
<p>by their political association with players.
</p>
<p>Shakespeare has the strongest political motive for
</p>
<p>treating history in this fashion ; he has also the strongest
</p>
<p>artistic motive, for a man naturally writes with more
</p>
<p>passion and fervour on subjects which interest him

</p>
<p>profoundly. Let us summarise briefly the way in which
</p>
<p>172 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>we have found political history to be used as material
</p>
<p>in the case of Hamlet.
</p>
<p>(i) At the period when Hamlet was written, the two
</p>
<p>great subjects of universal interest were the question of
</p>
<p>the Scottish succession and the fate of the Essex
</p>
<p>conspirators ; moreover, these two subjects were so
</p>
<p>intimately connected that they formed but one in the
</p>
<p>popular mind and, therefore, in treating them as
</p>
<p>one, Shakespeare would be simply working to a unity
</p>
<p>already existing in the minds of his audience. The fate
</p>
<p>of Essex and the fate of James have been blent in one
</p>
<p>destiny, and Shakspeare sees that, by blending
</p>
<p>them in one play, he can make a really magnificent
</p>
<p>drama.
</p>
<p>(2) Shakespeare himself is particularly and passionately
</p>
<p>interested in both these subjects, not only as every
</p>
<p>patriotic Englishman must be interested in the fate of
</p>
<p>his country, but because the fate of his dramatic company
</p>
<p>has been involved in that of the Essex conspirators and
</p>
<p>because his best beloved friend is even then in danger
</p>
<p>of death.
</p>
<p>(3) This theme, as it stands, cannot be treated under
</p>
<p>actual names, partly because it will only become dramatic
</p>
<p>if concentrated, and partly because the censorship will
</p>
<p>intervene if real names are employed.
</p>
<p>(4) Shakespeare evades both difficulties by choosing
</p>
<p>as a disguise, the story of Hamlet ; this enables him to
</p>
<p>concentrate the history and so turn it into magnificent
</p>
<p>dramatic material and it enables him, also, to evade
</p>
<p>the censorship.

</p>
<p>for two or more historic personages.
</p>
<p>(6) Hamlet is mainly James I., but there are certainly
</p>
<p>large elements in his character and story taken from
</p>
<p>Essex, and probably some from Southampton. It is
</p>
<p>only the "melancholy" Essex of the last fatal years
</p>
<p>who could thus be combined with the more sombre James,
</p>
<p>and even so the character has been found by many
</p>
<p>eminent critics to be not psychologically consistent, and
</p>
<p>by almost all critics to be particularly difficult to in-
</p>
<p>terpret as a unity.
</p>
<p>(7) Claudius, in the murder portion of the story, re-
</p>
<p>presents the elder Bothwell, in his relations to Hamlet
</p>
<p>the younger Bothwell ; his attitude towards Laertes
</p>
<p>and Hamlet is that of Robert Cecil towards Raleigh and
</p>
<p>Essex. His character is largely that of the elder
</p>
<p>Bothwell as drawn by Buchanan, but with added elements
</p>
<p>of subtlety and treachery. Here again, the blending of
</p>
<p>the two subjects works into a unity.
</p>
<p>(8) Polonius, in most of the relations of his life, is a
</p>
<p>minute and careful study of Burleigh, but his end is
</p>
<p>the dramatic end of Rizzio. Here again, the two subjects
</p>
<p>are blent into a unity.
</p>
<p>(9) The play has two sources : the Amleth saga and
</p>
<p>contemporary history, of which the latter is by far the
</p>
<p>more important. The intense vibrating, passionate
</p>
<p>interest of the play is probably due to the fact that
</p>
<p>the subject was, of all possible subjects, the one most
</p>
<p>near to the poet and his audience, its eminently
</p>
<p>artistic form is due to the fact that the poet has

</p>
<p>moulded his material as much as he pleased, and that
</p>
<p>174 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>his guiding principle has always been the artistic and
</p>
<p>dramatic effect.
</p>
<p>If the account given above of Hamlet be really correct,
</p>
<p>then the play is mythology rather than psychology, or,
</p>
<p>perhaps, it would be fairer to define it as mythology
</p>
<p>on its way towards psychology. For a variety of reasons
</p>
<p>this seems to me inherently plausible. To interpret
</p>
<p>Shakespeare almost exactly as if he were nineteenth-
</p>
<p>century psychology is surely to thrust him out of his
</p>
<p>place in the order of development. The psychology
</p>
<p>of the sixteenth century cannot exactly resemble ours,
</p>
<p>and must have some points of difference. Why not this
</p>
<p>resemblance to mythology ?
</p>
<p>In the second place, as even such a thorough-going
</p>
<p>psychologist as Mr Bradley admits, some, at any rate,
</p>
<p>of Shakespeare's plays do produce very much the effect
</p>
<p>of ancient mythology. It seems to me that this effect
</p>
<p>is characteristic of a good many ; that Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>Hamlet, his Lear, his Prospero, can hold their own even
</p>
<p>beside Achilles and Priam, CEdipus, Arthur, and MerHn.
</p>
<p>They are as universal and as romantic.
</p>
<p>Now, we know that the great mythologic figures were,
</p>
<p>in all probabiHty, created in some such way as the one
</p>
<p>suggested above. They were not copied by the poets
</p>
<p>from individuals, still less were they pure fiction ; they
</p>
<p>probably represent accretions round some historic centre.
</p>
<p>Every student of early history knows the facility with
</p>
<p>which two or more historic figures become grouped in
</p>
<p>one, especially when they belong to the same family, or
</p>
<p>have the same name, or perform similar exploits.

</p>
<p>Now, this mythologic method was quite well known
</p>
<p>Conclusion 175
</p>
<p>to Shakespeare's predecessors and contemporaries. As
</p>
<p>I have shown elsewhere,^ Shakespeare's greatest con-
</p>
<p>temporary  Spenser  writes what is practically a kind
</p>
<p>of mythology. He repeatedly 2 states that fairyland is
</p>
<p>really England, and that The Faerie Queene really stands
</p>
<p>for his own age and time. I think most readers will
</p>
<p>agree with me that The Faerie Queene looks even less
</p>
<p>like contemporary history than do Shakespeare's plays,
</p>
<p>yet we have the repeated assurance of its own author
</p>
<p>that it is.
</p>
<p>Now, Spenser certainly seems to use the method I
</p>
<p>have described above : that of historic accretions grouped
</p>
<p>around some central figure. This is most obvious in
</p>
<p>Book v., where we are able to see with perfect plainness
</p>
<p>that Artegall must represent both Arthur, Lord Grey of
</p>
<p>Wilton, and also Leicester, for he performs both Grey's
</p>
<p>exploits in Ireland and Leicester's in the Low Countries.
</p>
<p>I have also endeavoured to show that the same principle
</p>
<p>applies with regard to the other characters ; that Duessa
</p>
<p>is both Mary Tudor and Mary, Queen of Scots, that Una
</p>
<p>represents sometimes the experiences of Anne Boleyn,
</p>
<p>sometimes those of EHzabeth.
</p>
<p>Nor is the mythological method confined to Spenser !
</p>
<p>A somewhat similar method is employed by Lyly, one
</p>
<p>of the dramatic predecessors who influenced Shakespeare
</p>
<p>most. Lyly writes plays which are ostensibly classical
</p>
<p>mythology, but which are in reality a kind of court
</p>
<p>allegory ; they represent contemporary characters, and
</p>
<p>contemporary politics in a classic disguise.

<p>176 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Have we not been inclined to forget too readily how
</p>
<p>much of the mediaeval mind still remains in the Eliza-
</p>
<p>bethans ? Why should not Shakespeare have a share
</p>
<p>of that which is so prominent both in Spenser and in
</p>
<p>Lyly?
</p>
<p>Yet, again, pointing in the direction I have indicated,
</p>
<p>is the example of Plutarch, who was almost a lay Bible
</p>
<p>to the Elizabethans.
</p>
<p>He would direct Shakespeare's attention not to the
</p>
<p>study of imaginary characters, constructed on a psy-
</p>
<p>chological basis, but to the study of real characters of
</p>
<p>actual statesmen, with all their idiosyncrasies and peculi-
</p>
<p>arities, and the mere idea of parallel lives grouped in pairs
</p>
<p>would suggest a grouping of such characters as the elder
</p>
<p>and the younger Bothwell, of Rizzio and Polonius, and
</p>
<p>also help towards the main conception  the parallel
</p>
<p>of Amleth and James I.
</p>
<p>It would be, I think, unfair to say that Hamlet is the
</p>
<p>portrait of anyone ; he is more subtle, more interesting,
</p>
<p>more many-sided than any human being ever has been
</p>
<p>or could be. Shakespeare has taken from the story of
</p>
<p>James I. all that was most tragic and most pathetic, and
</p>
<p>from his character all that was most enigmatic, most
</p>
<p>attractive, and most interesting. He has taken from
</p>
<p>the story of James the Orestes-like central theme : the
</p>
<p>theme of the man whose father has been murdered, and
</p>
<p>whose mother has married the murderer. Shakespeare
</p>
<p>has also taken from James the central traits of Hamlet's
</p>
<p>character ; the hatred of bloodshed, the irresolution,
</p>
<p>the philosophic mind, the fear of action, the hesitation

</p>
<p>to punish which is half weakness and half generosity.
</p>
<p>Conclusion 177
</p>
<p>Only in Shakespeare the interest is concentrated as
</p>
<p>it is not in the history. In the history it was the elder
</p>
<p>Bothwell who murdered James's father and the younger
</p>
<p>Bothwell who held James in a kind of duresse vile, and
</p>
<p>threatened his life. By the simple expedient of com-
</p>
<p>bining in one the parts of the two Bothwells, Shakespeare
</p>
<p>gains dramatic unity and an enormous concentration of
</p>
<p>interest. The tragic motive of the father's murder is
</p>
<p>now brought into the closest possible relation with the
</p>
<p>tragic motive of the son's hesitancy and irresolution,
</p>
<p>and the two together make a drama of the most powerful
</p>
<p>and moving kind. What the story gains is what the
</p>
<p>stage so emphatically demands : compression and
</p>
<p>unity.
</p>
<p>But this is not enough !
</p>
<p>The tale of James I. is not finished and not complete ;
</p>
<p>nothing is rounded off. But the tragedy can be com-
</p>
<p>pleted by uniting with it the tragedy of Essex, which,
</p>
<p>as we have said, is already one theme with it in the
</p>
<p>minds of the audience. By uniting the tragedy of Essex,
</p>
<p>Shakespeare gains a whole group more of most dramatic
</p>
<p>and interesting themes : the longing for seclusion and
</p>
<p>study, the desire to retire from Court, yet remaining
</p>
<p>obediently at the express wish and desire of the Queen,
</p>
<p>even the suit of " inky blackness " is reminiscent of
</p>
<p>the mourning of Essex as the populace had last seen
</p>
<p>him at his trial and execution. The feeling of profound
</p>
<p>melancholy, the longing for death, resembles that of
</p>
<p>Essex in his later years, so does the rivalry with Laertes,
</p>
<p>the sense of fatality and doom, it is in the terrible
</p>
<p>death which befell Essex that we have the clue to

</p>
<p>178 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>Hamlet's shrinking from disfigurement and defilement
</p>
<p>after death.
</p>
<p>It is from this source that we get the generosity and
</p>
<p>kindness of Hamlet's relation to the players, his tampering
</p>
<p>with the play and the ill influence this has on his own
</p>
<p>fate. It is because of this that we have the lack of am-
</p>
<p>bition and the dying voice given to Fortinbras ; these
</p>
<p>resemblances are pointed by giving us in the death-
</p>
<p>scene a quotation from the dying words of Essex. It
</p>
<p>is from this source, doubtless, that we have the element
</p>
<p>of the courtier and the soldier, the winning charm of
</p>
<p>personality which we are told have been prominent in
</p>
<p>Hamlet, for the last thing Fortinbras says of him is that
</p>
<p>he must have *' the soldier's music and the rites of war."
</p>
<p>If Hamlet were only the philosophic prince why this
</p>
<p>funeral, and why the body prominent on a stage to be
</p>
<p>seen of all the people ?
</p>
<p>But the drama is still incomplete ! There is no love-
</p>
<p>story to add pathos. Now, here again, Shakespeare
</p>
<p>takes a motive which he may well have found in the
</p>
<p>drama of Essex, the motive of the innocent and loving
</p>
<p>woman cruelly used as a decoy, the motive of the stolen
</p>
<p>love-letters, stolen to injure the lover, but yet found to
</p>
<p>be love-letters, and nothing more, the motive of the
</p>
<p>bitter grief and wretchedness of the unhappy woman.
</p>
<p>Possibly there is something added from the tale of
</p>
<p>Southampton which is so intimately bound up with that
</p>
<p>of Essex.
</p>
<p>Opheha sings a lament for " bonny sweet Robin,"
</p>
<p>and this is the precise title Essex received from his mother

</p>
<p>and others.
</p>
<p>Conclusion I79
</p>
<p>The same method is employed with the other characters
</p>
<p>in the play. Burleigh was only recently dead. He had
</p>
<p>been the great opponent of Essex, he had plotted or was
</p>
<p>beUeved to have plotted against him, he had once
</p>
<p>refused the marriage of Essex and his daughter ; Essex
</p>
<p>had certainly made Burleigh his butt often and
</p>
<p>repeatedly, and had taunted him recklessly and to the
</p>
<p>amusement -of the whole Court; Burleigh, moreover,
</p>
<p>was supposed to have been the secret enemy of James,
</p>
<p>and was accused of tampering with the succession in
</p>
<p>favour of Spain. Burleigh, then, is the main original
</p>
<p>of Polonius, but he died peaceably in his bed, and such
</p>
<p>an ending is not really dramatic. Shakespeare gives
</p>
<p>us, therefore, the dramatic and dreadful death of Rizzio,
</p>
<p>and points the resemblance once again, as in the case
</p>
<p>of Essex, by an almost exact quotation.
</p>
<p>' Claudius is the two Bothwells ; he is most closely
</p>
<p>drawn from the elder, and apparently, from Buchanan's
</p>
<p>picture of him, he has the drunkenness, lechery, adultery,
</p>
<p>incest, \aolence, meanness, cowardice, and personal
</p>
<p>hideousness which Buchanan declares to have characterised
</p>
<p>Bothwell.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these facts, he exercised a curious
</p>
<p>and unaccountable fascination upon a queen who was
</p>
<p>already a wedded wife; neither Shakespeare nor
</p>
<p>Buchanan explain how, if he really was as they describe
</p>
<p>him, he contrived to fascinate the queen. Every word
</p>
<p>of Hamlet's terrific indictment of him is probably to
</p>
<p>be taken as true.
</p>
<p>One may further ask: "Has Hamlet a political
</p>
<p>motive ? " It is, of course, quite unnecessary to assume

<p>M*
</p>
<p>i8o Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>this ; the dramatic purpose, the mere desire to hold up,
</p>
<p>as Hamlet puts it, " the mirror to nature," " to show
</p>
<p>virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very
</p>
<p>age and body of the time his form and pressure," this
</p>
<p>in itself is motive more than sufficient.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it does seem possible that Hamlet may
</p>
<p>have, in addition to its purely artistic motive, a political
</p>
<p>motive also : that motive being simply the endeavour
</p>
<p>to excite as much sympathy as possible for the Essex
</p>
<p>conspirators, and for the Scottish succession, since it
</p>
<p>really was the accession of James which set Southampton
</p>
<p>free from the Tower, and restored Shakespeare's company
</p>
<p>once more to the favour of a monarch ; also it is more
</p>
<p>than probable that Shakespeare thought the Scottish
</p>
<p>succession would deliver the whole country from sub-
</p>
<p>servience to Spain.
</p>
<p>In so far as Hamlet is James I., it seems to me that
</p>
<p>Shakespeare means to excite in us the desire to withdraw
</p>
<p>Hamlet from the Denmark which cannot appreciate
</p>
<p>him, and to give him a wider and a finer sphere. We
</p>
<p>know that James himself welcomed with all his heart
</p>
<p>his release from Scotland with its many restrictions,
</p>
<p>its many perils, and its necessity for endless subter-
</p>
<p>fuges, and welcomed the greater freedom of the English
</p>
<p>throne.
</p>
<p>In so far as Hamlet is Essex, the political motive is
</p>
<p>to stress his own unwillingness for the life of courts and
</p>
<p>of ambition, his noble unsuspiciousness and the generous,
</p>
<p>but misplaced confidence which led him to his doom ;

<p>Conclusion i8i
</p>
<p>pathos of his fate. Hamlet in death is singularly anxious
</p>
<p>as Essex was anxious that his memory shall be cleared,
</p>
<p>and the circumstances are admitted to be strange and
</p>
<p>doubtful.
</p>
<p>Now, if the method of construction be the one ex-
</p>
<p>plained above, we can hardly expect to find a psychologic
</p>
<p>unity in Hamlet, and I submit that, as a matter of fact,
</p>
<p>we do not.
</p>
<p>Take, for instance, Hudson's argument :
</p>
<p>" In plain terms, Hamlet is mad, deranged, not indeed in
</p>
<p>all his faculties nor perhaps in any of them continuously ;
</p>
<p>that is, the derangement is partial and occasional ; paroxysms
</p>
<p>of wildness and fury alternating with intervals of serenity
</p>
<p>and composure.
</p>
<p>' ' Now the reality of his madness is what the literary critics
</p>
<p>have been strangely and unwisely reluctant to admit ; partly
</p>
<p>because they thought it discreditable to the hero's intellect,
</p>
<p>and partly because they did not understand the exceeding
</p>
<p>versatility and multiformity of that disease.
</p>
<p>" And one natural effect of the disease as we see it in him
</p>
<p>is, that the several parts of his behaviour have no apparent
</p>
<p>kindred or fellowship with each other ; it makes him full of
</p>
<p>abrupt changes and contradictions ; his action when the
</p>
<p>paroxysm is upon him being palpably inconsistent with his
</p>
<p>action when properly himself. Hence, some have held him
</p>
<p>to be many varieties of character in one, so that different
</p>
<p>minds take very different impressions of him, and even the
</p>
<p>same mind at different times. And as the critics have
</p>
<p>supposed that amid all his changes there must be a constant
</p>
<p>principle, and as they could not discover that principle, they
</p>
<p>have therefore referred it to some unknown depth in his
</p>
<p>being, whereas in madness the constant principle is either
</p>
<p>wholly paralysed or else more or less subject to fits of paralysis ;
</p>
<p>which latter is the case with Hamlet. Accordingly insane

<p>people are commonly said to be not themselves but beside
</p>
<p>themselves."
</p>
<p>i82 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>A reference to a Variorum Edition will show that all the
</p>
<p>aUenists take the same point of view, and consider Hamlet
</p>
<p>mad because he shows a " disharmonic psychology."
</p>
<p>Now, it is exceedingly difficult to see how so many
</p>
<p>eminent critics could have taken such different views of
</p>
<p>Hamlet's character had it really been a psychological
</p>
<p>unity.
</p>
<p>I do not think the case could be better summed up than
</p>
<p>in Hudson's words : 
</p>
<p>"The several parts of his behaviour have no apparent
</p>
<p>kindred or fellowship with each other. . . . Hence some have
</p>
<p>held him to be many varieties of character in one."
</p>
<p>Now, this is precisely the effect that would be produced
</p>
<p>in a mythological figure if Shakespeare were drawing
</p>
<p>from more than one character at the same time, and if
</p>
<p>these characters were such as not to amalgamate com-
</p>
<p>pletely into a unity. The same " disharmonic psycho-
</p>
<p>logy," has been found by many critics in Lear and Macbeth,
</p>
<p>and by some in Othello.
</p>
<p>The final conclusion I arrive at is that it is not
</p>
<p>advisable to think our study of Shakespeare's plays
</p>
<p>complete without careful reference to the history of his

<p>James prided himself on being the destined restorer

<p>of the Arthurian empire. He offended both his Parha-

<p>ments by styhng himself, without the consent of either,
</p>
<p>King of Great Britain, and he desired, as Selden puts it,
</p>
<p>to get rid of the very names of strangers {i.e. Scotland
</p>
<p>and England). Masson says in his edition of the Register

<p>creditable to King James than the strength of his passion
</p>
<p>for such a union of the two kingdoms and peoples as

<p>might fitly follow the union of the two crowns. The

<p>" He will stay a few days in Berwick in order to arrange
</p>
<p>the form of the union of the two crowns. It is said that
</p>
<p>he is disposed to abandon the titles of England and
</p>
<p>Scotland and to call himself King of Great Britain, and
</p>
<p>like that famous and ancient King Arthur to embrace
</p>
<p>under one name the whole circuit of one thousand seven
</p>
<p>hundred miles, which includes the United Kingdom now
</p>
<p>possessed by his Majesty, in that one island."
</p>
<p>APPENDIX B
</p>
<p>The following is interesting as a commentary upon
</p>
<p>The Merchant oj Venice.
</p>
<p>It is an extract from the Burleigh papers, a portion of
</p>
<p>what appears to be an actual proclamation entitled :
</p>
<p>" An Account of Dr Lopez' Treason, 1593-4."
</p>
<p>" Doctor Roger Lopez, a Portugall borne ... he did
</p>
<p>use always the means of certain choice persons picked
</p>
<p>out by himself, in whom he reposed special trust, whereof
</p>
<p>a Portugall called Manuel Andrada was one, a man some-
</p>
<p>time attending on the King Don Antonio, both as their
</p>
<p>countrymen say, of one tribe and kindred. This Andrada,
</p>
<p>by letters intercepted, was discovered to have practised
</p>
<p>the death of the said Don Antonio."
</p>
<p>[Andrada travels a great deal, to Spain and elsewhere.]
</p>
<p>" He (Lopez) most wickedly did undertake a most

</p>
<p>heinous purpose and resolution to take away the Hfe of
</p>
<p>her most gracious Majesty by poison that had honoured
</p>
<p>him, a base fellow otherwise, with princely favour, rewards
</p>
<p>and good opinion.
</p>
<p>"... The precious life of our sovereign sacred Princess,
</p>
<p>upon whose life so many lives depend, should have been
</p>
<p>sold. Her life, I say, that giveth life to many, loath to
</p>
<p>take away the Hfe of any, though by Law convicted ;
</p>
<p>a sweet Lady, wonderfully incKning to Mercy, most loving
</p>
<p>to all Strangers ; I may truly say, ' Decus et deliciae
</p>
<p>mundi ' the Jewel of the World. . . . This Stranger,
</p>
<p>made a denizen in the land, her sworn servant, would
</p>
<p>betray her beloved and dear life. . . . For the King of
</p>
<p>Spain, they say, so long as her Majesty liveth, distrusteth
</p>
<p>in the success of his intended purposes. . . .
</p>
<p>" Now like wary Merchants (for their letters were written
</p>
<p>in style of Merchants), that these letters might be conveyed
</p>
<p>with more safety they communicated."
</p>
<p>The document goes on to state how Elizabeth was
</p>
<p>referred to under the disguise of the Pearl : " Indeed this
</p>
<p>Pearl they mean though brought forth in a northern
</p>
<p>climate, yet far surmounting all the Oriental Pearles and
</p>
<p>Jewells, which the East or any other parts of the world
</p>
<p>ever had or hath."
</p>
<p>Now here we surely have remarkable parallels to
</p>
<p>Shakespeare's play ; there is first the disguise of the
</p>
<p>conspirators as merchants which suggests at once Shake-
</p>
<p>speare's title and general scheme. Then we have the
</p>
<p>praise of Ehzabeth as the jewel of the world, far surpassing

</p>
<p>all others, as Bassanio praises Portia (L i.), and we have
</p>
<p>i86 Hamlet and the Scottish Succession
</p>
<p>the enthusiastic praise of her mercy ; we have the plot
</p>
<p>of the ahen Jew ; we have the fact that the Jew employs
</p>
<p>to travel for him one of his own tribe exactly as Shylock
</p>
<p>employs Tubal.
</p>
<p>Further close parallels  as, for example, that Don
</p>
<p>Antonio becomes a bankrupt, that he has to borrow money
</p>
<p>from the Jew Lopez even to pay for his clothes, that his
</p>
<p>vessels are lost, one by one or in groups, by fire, ship-
</p>
<p>wreck, etc., in what seems an unprecedented run of ill-
</p>
<p>luck  can be found in the State Papers, 1593-4.
</p>
<p>If the above proclamation were actually placarded on
</p>
<p>the walls of London (as it probably was) when Shake-
</p>
<p>speare's play was performed, the main significance of the

<p>drama would have been immediately apparent to all.
