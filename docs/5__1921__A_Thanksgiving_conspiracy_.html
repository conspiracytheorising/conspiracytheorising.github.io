</p>

</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Now, you don't need to argue with me. I
</p>
<p>guess I'm master here and what I say is the law {raps on
</p>
<p>floor with cane).
</p>
<p>Fred  But, Grandfather, the idea of not observing
</p>
<p>Thanksgiving day.
</p>
<p>Ada  Why, I think it's dreadful.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole Oh, you do ! Well, I don't. It's a silly cus-
</p>
<p>tom and I'm tired of it. Get up a big dinner  all foolish-
</p>
<p>ness ! Give thanks  bah, I've nothing to give thanks for.
</p>
<p>I don't want to hear any more about Thanksgiving plans.
</p>
<p>Ada  Well, Grandfather, don't you think 
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  I don't think anything and I don't want to
</p>
<p>hear anything.
</p>
<p>Fred  But can't we 
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole {rapping with cane)  Be still, sir. This
</p>

<p>A THANKSGIVING CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>BiMP  Did you ring, sir?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  I did. I want you to carry my things to the
</p>
<p>Hbrary where I can sit in peace.
</p>
<p>BiMP  Very good, sir. {He picks up a hook, a paper and
</p>
<p>the footstool and follows Mr. Cole off stage. Cole walks
</p>
<p>with short, limping steps, using his cane).
</p>
<p>Ada  ^Oh, dear, won't it be horrid not to have a Thanks-
</p>
<p>giving dinner and some company ?
</p>
<p>Fred  Say, he's the Hmit. He gets worse all the time.
</p>
<p>Enter Bimp (with letter on tray).
</p>
<p>BiMP  A letter, sir. I think it must be for you, sir,
</p>
<p>since the writing looks so^  well, like a young lady's, sir..
</p>
<p>Fred {taking letter)  This having the same narne as
</p>
<p>Grandfather and not knowing whether mail is for him or
</p>
<p>me makes me tired {gazes at letter). I suppose I can open
</p>
<p>this, don't you think so, Bimp?
</p>
<p>Bimp  Yes, sir, I should say so, from its looks {hows and
</p>
<p>goes off).
</p>
<p>Ada  Oh, open it and see who it's from.
</p>
<p>Fred {opens and looks through letter)  Well, Fl'l de-
</p>
<p>clare! Listen to this {reads aloud). "Dear Cousin: I
</p>
<p>shall pass through your city on a trip I am taking and have
</p>
<p>decided to stop and spend Thanksgiving with you. I know
</p>
<p>we'll have a splendid time getting acquainted and I hope
</p>
<p>you'll be glad to see me. Your cousin, Sallie Evans."
</p>
<p>Now, WHO is Sallie Evans?

<p>A THANKSGIVING CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Ada  Oh, one of the cousins we've never seen. You
</p>
<p>know we have a. lot of them. But if she is to be here for
</p>
<p>Thanksgiving we've just GOT to have a good dinner. Per-
</p>
<p>haps Grandfather will change his mind now she is coming.
</p>
<p>Fred  Change his mind  he isn't that kind.
</p>
<p>Enter Mrs. Hale
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hale  Oh, now, isn't your Grandfather in here?
</p>
<p>I was wanting to speak to him about Thanksgiving.
</p>
<p>Ada  He's in the library. Mrs. Hale, isn't it dreadful
</p>
<p>that he says we can't observe Thanksgiving  can't even
</p>
<p>have a good dinner.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hale  My, my, now, aint that a shame, an' me such
</p>
<p>a fine hand to get up splendid Thanksgiving dinners (shakes
</p>
<p>head). An' he's so set in his ways, too, I don't know what
</p>
<p>we'll do.
</p>
<p>Fred  Set in his ways  I'll say he's more set than the
</p>
<p>Plymouth Rock.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hale  He says to me that we're not to have a
</p>
<p>turkey nor pun'kin pie, nor even cranberry sauce. My, my,
</p>
<p>now, to think of such a thing.
</p>
<p>Fred  An' I just got a letter that a cousin we've never
</p>
<p>seen will be here. What CAN be done?
</p>
<p>Enter Bimp
</p>
<p>BiMP {to Ada)  If you please, Miss, your Grandfather
</p>
<p>says you're to practice your music well, for you're tO' take
</p>
<p>your lesson this week same as usual, Miss.

<p>A THANKSGIVING CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Ada  Oh, I won't take a lesson on Thanksgiving day, so !
</p>
<p>Fred  Say, something's got to be done.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hale {shaking head sadly)  I don't know what.
</p>
<p>It's dreadful, now, not to keep Thanksgiving but v/hen your
</p>
<p>Gran pa says so it has to be so. He's so set in his ways,
</p>
<p>an' I'm the one to know, being his housekeeper for ten
</p>
<p>years.
</p>
<p>BiMP  He's .more set than a settin' hen that wants to set.
</p>
<p>I guess we'll have to give in to 'im, sir.
</p>
<p>Fred  But say  you know Grandfather's a great hand to
</p>
<p>make bargains. I have a plan I believe we can work.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hale  I don't like to go against your Gran'pa, what
</p>
<p>with me bein' in his service ten years, but I DO love to git
</p>
<p>up Thanksgivin' dinners, an' with the young lady comin'
</p>
<p>I'll help you if I can.
</p>
<p>BiMP  It's myself would like some good roast turkey an'
</p>
<p>all the fixin's ; an' hurrah for Thanksgivin' says I an' 'spe-
</p>
<p>cially the feast, so I'll help you if I can, sir (bows to Fred),
</p>
<p>Fred  Let's go out where we can talk. Grandfather
</p>
<p>might come in here (all exeunt).
</p>
<p>Enter Mr. Cole (zvalking slozvly)
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole (dropping heavily into easy chair)  Oh, they've
</p>
<p>gone  well, 'I can have it quiet to read (picks up magazine).
</p>
<p>I'll read a story. (Reads aloud)  "In the home of Judge

<p>while from the kitchen floated savory odors of the coming
</p>
<p>feast. Judge Graham, with a smile of content sat waiting
</p>
<p>for his Thanksgiving guests who  " bah ! a Thanksgiving
</p>
<p>story {throws hook across room) I'm sick of all this Thanks-

<p>giving trash.
</p>

<p>Ada  Just think, Grandpa, she is coming to visit us 
</p>
<p>Fred had a letter. Do you suppose she is about our age?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Probably. You must have a lot of cousins
</p>
<p>about that age.
</p>
<p>Ada  And Grandpa, she Is to be here Thanksgiving day.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Thanksgiving day, eh? Well, she can take
</p>
<p>pot luck with the rest of us. We're not keeping Thanks-
</p>
<p>giving this year.
</p>
<p>Ada  Not with our company and all we have to be thank-
</p>
<p>ful for?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole {rapping zvith cane)  I have nothing to be
</p>
<p>thankful for.
</p>
<p>Fred  Say, Grandfather, I'd like to make a bargain with
</p>
<p>you.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Eh  what's that? A bargain? Well, what

<p>Fred  You think you have nothing to be thankful for?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole {rapping angrily with cane)  I have told

<p>you so.
</p>
<p>Fred  Well, if we hear you say five times that you are^
</p>
<p>thankful 
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  You'll not hear me say I'm thankful.
</p>
<p>Fred  But if we DO hear you say you're thankful may
</p>
<p>we have a good Thanksgiving dinner?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole {rapping with cane) -^Y on may.

<p>Mr. Cole  ^'It's a bargain. If I say I'm thankful five

<p>isn't it? Lovely Thanksgiving weather we're having. Just

<p>Mr. Cole  Is that so ? I'm not thankful,  nothing to be

<p>thankful for.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ames  Oh, yes, indeed, every one has much to be

<p>thankfulfor. Now I called to see, Mr. Cole, if we couldn't
</p>
<p>interest you in the big Thanksgiving dinner we are going

<p>to give the poor people of the town.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  No, you can't.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ames  We want to serve dinner a good Thanks-

<p>giving dinner  to several hundred people. Now I am sure,
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole, you will be glad to give us a good donation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  I'll not give a cent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ames  Oh, I'm sure you'll give us a nice gift  say,
</p>
<p>twenty-five dollars.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Not a cent! I'm thankful, sir, that I know

<p>Ada  A grand Thanksgiving she will have (wipes eyes).

<p>Enter Miss Sallie
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie (briskly)  The butler told me to come
</p>
<p>right in (goes to Mr. C. zvith hands outstretched). How
</p>
<p>DO you do? I'm SO glad to see you (he looks at her in
</p>
<p>surprise). Why, I don't believe you know me. Didn't you
</p>
<p>get my letter?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Letter? No. (Fred throws up hands and

<p>gasps).
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie  Well, I'm your cousin Sallie Evans and
</p>
<p>I've stopped to spend Thanksgiving with you (Fred falls

<p>back into one chair and Ada into another in surprise).
</p>

<p>grow old. You're real well, aren't you cousin?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole {straightens up proudly)  I'm glad to see you.
</p>
<p>Yes, I'm thankful to say that I'm still pretty young and spry.
</p>
<p>Fred (jumping up)  Oh, five times! That's five times

<p>(claps hands).
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole (happily)  I doii't care if it's fifty times.
</p>
<p>Ada  But is it a bargain?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Of course it's a bargain. Get out of this now

</p>
<p>Miss Sallie  What queer-acting young folks. Who are

</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  My grandchildren. They're just excited a

<p>little, that's all.
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie  I'm so VERY glad to be here (takes off
</p>
<p>hat and coat and lays them down. She and Mr. C. sit close
</p>
<p>together). I know we're going to have just the LOVELI-
</p>
<p>EST visit together. I can remember what an interesting
</p>
<p>talker you were when you visited us  though of course I
</p>
<p>was very young then. I told your wife, dear cousin Lottie.
</p>
<p>that you were one of the m.ost entertaining men I ever knew.

</p>
<p>Miss Sallie  Oh, a nice, big, lovely turkey ! How grand.
</p>
<p>I DO so like turkey for Thanksgiving, cousin Fred. Are
</p>
<p>you going to buy him?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Certainly (zmves hand). You and Mrs. Hale
</p>
<p>fix that up. We want the best of everything for our Thanks-

</p>
<p>Bix  All right, sir (exit).
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie  I can see this is going to be the best
</p>
<p>Thanksgiving I've spent in years. And I have a great deal

<p>Ames  It's a good idea and it's going to be a good din-

<p>ner. All we need is the money to buy food.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Oh, yes, the money. Well, put m.e down for
</p>
<p>twenty-five dollars, I like to help these things along.
</p>
<p>Ames  Thank you very much indeed (exit).
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie  Oh, how LOVELY to be so generous
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole (beaming at her)  It's nothing when I have so
</p>
<p>much to be thankful for.
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie  It is LOVELY, Cousin, to sit here and
</p>
<p>visit but I brought my maid with me and I better see how
</p>
<p>she is getting on. The housekeeper took her to a room
</p>
<p>(she rises).
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  Yes, and we must go see if Mrs. Hale is pre-
</p>
<p>paring everything we want for our Thanksgiving feast (rises
</p>
<p>and takes cane).
</p>
<p>Sallie  Oh, do you have to use a cane?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole  No, no  merely a notion (he puts cane down,
</p>
<p>straightens up, offers her his arm and they g-o happily off, he
</p>
<p>limping slightly).
</p>
<p>Enter Kate
</p>
<p>Kate (looking around disdainfully)  I don't like it here
</p>
<p> not the least little tiny bit. It is too dull  the only men
</p>
<p>folks I've had a glimpse of are an OLD man and a green
</p>
<p>looking boy about fifteen years old  what do you think of
</p>
<p>that? I'd like to know how I'm going to have anv good

<p>time. Ugh, such a foolish place to stop for Thanksgiving

<p>isn't he nice? Not so handsome as the ice-man back home

<p>Bimp  What can I do for you, Miss ?

<p>Kate  W'y, talk to me. Do you suppose 1 like to stand

<p>around by myself with no one to talk to ? {Bimp runs and
