<p>THE THIAL.
</p>
<p>TiiE assassination of Abraham Lincoln was a military crime.
</p>
<p>AVhilo actually in command of the national forces, lie was killed in
</p>
<p>a city whicli was bis headquarters, strongly fortified and garrisoned,
</p>
<p>with a military governor, and a jirovost^marshal whoso patrols were
</p>
<p>abroad day and night arresting all persons found violating the
</p>
<p>" rdles and articles of war." Not only was the murdered com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-chief, to use the words of the Constitution, " iVi actual
</p>
<p>service in time of war," but it was a tune of "public danger,"
</p>
<p>in which the assassins were constitutionally excluded from any
</p>
<p>right to a trial in the civil coui-ts. Peace had not then been con-
</p>
<p>quered; there was a powerful enemy in arms, to whom " aid and
</p>
<p>comfort " could be given ; the leader of the Rebellion was still at
</p>
<p>large ; many loyal men were becoming disheartened by the conscrip-
</p>
<p>tion, and by the prolonged expenditure of blood and treasure ; and
</p>
<p>there are good reasons for believing that the rebel authorities,
</p>
<p>having traversed all the stages of crime, confidently hoped by this
</p>
<p>assassination to inaugurate anarchy at the North, and to thus
</p>
<p>prepare the way for a dictator. Fortunately for the cause of
</p>
<p>freedom throughout the world, the Government of the United
</p>
<p>States proved its sovereign strength by not even halting in its
</p>
<p>onward mai-ch, as the assassins struck down its head, and cruelly
</p>
<p>assaulted one of its principal officers. IMajestically moving on in
</p>
<p>accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the Government
</p>
<p>at once asserted its supreme power by providiug for the apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion and the trial of those who had conspned to commit the Great
</p>
<p>Crime, so infamous in name, and so impotent in effect.
</p>
<p>Before the martyr-president had ceased to live, Mr. Secretary
</p>
<p>Stanton directed a seai-ch for the recognized assassin, and an inves-
</p>
<p>tigation into the circumstances (connected with the perpetration of

<p>the bloody deed. The next day, in a letter to the Hon. Charles
</p>
<p>Francis Adams, ISIr. Stanton said, " The murderer of the President
</p>
<p>Las been discovered, and evidence obtained that these horrible crimes
</p>
<p>were committed in execution of a conspiracy deliberately planned
</p>
<p>and set on foot by rebels, under pretence of avenging the South
</p>
<p>and aiding the rebel cause." Subsequently the Secrotaiy of War
</p>
<p>announced, in an official bulletin, that all persons who had har-
</p>
<p>bored or secreted Booth, Atzerodt, or Ilerold, or who had aided or
</p>
<p>assisted their escape, should bo "subject to trial before a military
</p>
<p>commission ; and the punishment is death." The bulletin concluded
</p>
<p>by saying, " Let the stain of innocent blood be removed from the
</p>
<p>land by the arrest and punishment of the murderers ! All good
</p>
<p>citizens are exhorted to aid pubUc justice on this occasion. Every
</p>
<p>man should consider his own innocence charged with this solemn
</p>
<p>duty, and rest neither night nor day till it is accomplished."
</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton faithfully performed his share of this work ;
</p>
<p>and he was ably soeoudcd by the Provost Marshal of the War
</p>
<p>Depai-tmcnt, Colonel L. C. Baker. The discovery by Fouehc of
</p>
<p>the celebrated French conspiracy, headed by Pichegru, for the
</p>
<p>assassination of the first Emperor Napoleon, has been regarded as
</p>
<p>the greatest triumph of detective-police skill on record ; but it will
</p>
<p>be ecUpscd by Colonel Baker's report of his operations. It was
</p>
<p>not long lifter the commission of the Great Crime before he was
</p>
<p>thoroughly conversant with the associations and habits of the chief
</p>
<p>actor's" acquaintances in Washington, Baltimore, Blontreal, and
</p>
<p>other cities. Some were promptly arrested ; a careful espionage
</p>
<p>was established over others ; confidential agents were sent for and
</p>
<p>wide, some of them in disguise; the magnetic telegraph and the
</p>
<p>photographer's camera were called into the service for the trans-
</p>
<p>mission of intelligence, and for the multipUcation of portraits for
</p>
<p>identification ; and it was not long before the proofs of a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>organized at Richmond and perfected in Canada, were ovovwhclming.
</p>
<p>The finger of an avenging Providence appears to have tracked tho
</p>
<p>principal conspirators, and to have furnished abundant proofs that

<p>Judge Advocate General Holt is a loyal Kentuckian, who lias
</p>
<p>rcndei'oil signal pnlitical scrviees to the Union sineo tlic comnieneo-
</p>
<p>nicnt of tbo lu'licllion. After Laving acted as Judge Advocate at
</p>
<p>the trial of General Fitz John Porter, be was invited to organize
</p>
<p>the " Bureau of Military Justice," established by Act of Congress,
</p>
<p>and was commissioned as Judge Advocate General, a position for
</p>
<p>which be is eminently fitted. Familiar in a marked degi-ce with
</p>
<p>military law, with a quick and keen intellect, unwearied industiy,
</p>
<p>and an impressive style of oratoiy. General Holt is an inflexibly
</p>
<p>upright administrator of justice; yet tlie humanities have a largo
</p>
<p>place in his heart. lie is tall, with an imposing presence, gray hair,
</p>
<p>and a manner which not only imposes respect, but wins admiration.
</p>
<p>Hon. John A. Bingham, a member of the House of Ecpresen-
</p>
<p>tativcs, from Ohio, has had some exiierienco as a Judge Advocate,
</p>
<p>and enjoys a high reputation as a criminal lawyer. W^vAq Judge
</p>
<p>Holt is calm and contemplative. Judge Bingham is energetic and
</p>
<p>impulsive; watching the movements of opposing counsel, unravel-
</p>
<p>ling the tangled skeins of testimony, and eviscerating truth from
</p>
<p>masses of conflicting evidence.
</p>
<p>Colonel II. L. Burnett, the second Assistant Judge Advocate, is
</p>
<p>a young officer, who prepared and conducted the trial for treason
</p>
<p>at Indianapolis, which disclosed the plans for establishing a North-
</p>
<p>western Confederacy ; and also the trial of the Chicago conspii-a-
</p>
<p>tors against tlie Union. The first-named case occupied in its trial
</p>
<p>three months and two days ; and the latter, four months. The
</p>
<p>great abOity displayed by Colonel Burnett in the prosecution of
</p>
<p>these cases commended him to Mr. Secretary Stanton, by whose
</p>
<p>order he was summoned here, and sjDocially assigned to duty in
</p>
<p>connection with Judge Holt. He was the executive officer, so to
</p>
<p>speak, of the trial ; seeing that the witnesses were in readiness, and
</p>
<p>infusing into the proceedings order, industry, and promptness.
</p>
<p>Before the Commission assembled, President Johnson, after
</p>
<p>consultation with his Cabinet, is.sued the following proclamation,
</p>
<p>oft'ering large rewards for five named individuals reported to him

<p>ANDREW JOHNSON.
</p>
<p>By the President :
</p>
<p>W. Hunter, Acting Secretary of State.
</p>
<p>8 TJJ^ TKIAL.
</p>
<p>The persons arrested as conspirators wore at first confined on
</p>
<p>board of tlio monitors, anchored off the Washington Navy Yard ;
</p>
<p>whence they were removed to the building originally used as the
</p>
<p>Penitentiary of the District of Columbia, now within the limits
</p>
<p>of the United-States Arsenal, on Greeuleaf's Point. This is at
</p>
<p>the junction of the Potomac and the Anacostia, or Ea.storn Branch ;
</p>
<p>and, as the channels of the two rivers run near the shores, the tract
</p>
<p>of land was purchased, when Washington was first laid out as a
</p>
<p>metropolis, by a Mr. Greenleaf. He hoped that it would become
</p>
<p>the business portion of the future city, which GLMieral AVashington
</p>
<p>expected would be the tide-water depot of the (heat West, by
</p>
<p>the improvement of the Potomac River as a channel of transmon-
</p>
<p>tane transportation. Jlr. Greenleaf's " gi'eat expectatioas " were
</p>
<p>not realized ; and he became so involved, that several houses which
</p>
<p>he erected and nearly completed actually fell gradually to pieces,
</p>
<p>and were carried away for lire- wood. The name of " Greenleaf's
</p>
<p>Point," however, remains.
</p>
<p>The extremity of the point has been used a.s a United-States
</p>
<p>arsenal since the last war with Great Brit;iin. When the British
</p>
<p>troops occupied the metropolis, the retreating Americans undertook
</p>
<p>to conceal a hu-ge quantity of powder in a dry well, and then burned
</p>
<p>the buildings. The next day, a detachment of two hundred British
</p>
<p>grcn;ulicrs, with several officers, was sent by General Ross to com-
</p>
<p>plete the work of destruction ; and, by some accident, a lighted
</p>
<p>port-fire was thrown into the dry well which contained the powder.
</p>
<p>An explosion took place, killing and wounding many of the inva-
</p>
<p>ders, and precipitating the retreat from the capital, as the British
</p>
<p>thought that a mine had been purposely fired.
</p>
<p>Soon afterwards. Colonel Bomford, of the engineer-corps, com-
</p>
<p>menced the erection of the present substantial arsenal-buildings,
</p>
<p>which include a museum of weapons and of artillery, many of
</p>
<p>them trophies of the Revolutionary, English, and Mexi>>an wars.
</p>
<p>The workshops have gradually been increased ; and, since the break-
</p>
<p>in'Mjut of the war for the suppression of the Kolicllion, it has been

</p>
<p>an important depot for llcld-arliUery, muskets, and ammunition.
</p>
<p>The old Penitentiary was erected in 1S36, but has since been
</p>
<p>enlarged and improved. It is on the northern side of the old
</p>
<p>TnE TRIAL. 9
</p>
<p>Arsenal, toward Pennsylvania Avenue, from which it is over a mile
</p>
<p>distant ; Four and a Half Street running directly from the City
</p>
<p>Hall and Court House, across the avenue, down to the old Peni-
</p>
<p>tentiary gate. At the breaking-out of the Rcliellion, however, it
</p>
<p>was found imperatively necessary to enlarge the arsenal-grounds ;
</p>
<p>and their limits were extended quite a distance toward Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania Avenue, including the Penitentiary. The convicts were
</p>
<p>taken to Albany, N.Y., where they were incarcerated; and all
</p>
<p>adult criminals who have subsequently been convicted have also
</p>
<p>been sent here. Juvenile oSenders are sentenced to confinement
</p>
<p>in the House of Refuge at Baltimore.
</p>
<p>Brevet Major-General Hartranft, the special provost-marshal de-
</p>
<p>tailed for the trial, had placed under his orders a brigade of vol-
</p>
<p>unteers, and a detachment of the "N'oteran llcserve Corps. Strong
</p>
<p>guai-ds were so posted as to render the rescue or escape of the pris-
</p>
<p>oners impossible ; and there was in addition a detective force who ex-
</p>
<p>ercised a watchful surveillance. Each prisoner was manacled, and
</p>
<p>confined in a separate coll, attended by a guard ; and the heads of
</p>
<p>the male prisoners were enveloped in nmfllers, as one of them, while
</p>
<p>on board of the monitor, had endeavored to commit suicide by dash-
</p>
<p>ing out his brains.
</p>
<p>A large room in the north-east corner of the third story of the
</p>
<p>old Penitentiary, near the cells in which the prisoners were con-
</p>
<p>fined, was fitted up for the trial. It is about thirty by forty-five feet
</p>
<p>squai'e, with a ceiling about eleven feet high, supported by three
</p>
<p>wooden pillars. Four windows, with heavy iron gratings, afforded
</p>
<p>tolerable ventilation ; and there are two ante-rooms for the accommo-
</p>
<p>dation of the court and of the witnesses. The room was wbite-
</p>
<p>waslied and painted for the occasion, a prisoner's dock was con-
</p>
<p>structed along the western side, the floor was covered with cocoa-nut
</p>
<p>matting, and the tables and chairs were new. Gas was introduced,
</p>
<p>in case the court should protract its sittings until after dark.

<p>Brevet Ci)loncl C. H. Tompkins, U. S. A.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel David R. Clendenin, Eighth Illinois Cavalry.
</p>
<p>Brigadier-General Joseph Holt, Judge Advocate and lleeorder,
</p>
<p>assisted by Judge Advocates Burnett and Bingham.
</p>
<p>The members of the Court, who were all in full uniform, took
</p>
<p>their seats around a large table parallel with the north side of the
</p>
<p>room; General Hunter, the President, sitting at the eastern end.
</p>
<p>General Hunter has had much experience as a member of courts-
</p>
<p>martial, and is an admh-able presiding officer, giving the most care-
</p>
<p>ful attention to every word spoken by the witnesses ; and, when
</p>
<p>the Judge Advocate and the prisoner's counsel differ on any ques-
</p>
<p>tion, the" General has the uncommon faculty of holding his judg-
</p>
<p>ment in perfect abeyance until he has heard both sides, and then
</p>
<p>forming it with inflexible firmness. At the right of General Hunter
</p>
<p>git Generals Wallace and Ekin, with Colonel Tompkins; at his left sit
</p>
<p>Generals Kautz, Foster, Harris, and Howe, with Colonel Clendenin.
</p>
<p>At the foot of the table at which the Court sat was another, occu-
</p>
<p>pied by Judge Advocate General Holt, with his assistants, Hon.
</p>
<p>Mr. Binghanfand Colonel Burnett. On this table, as the trial pro-
</p>
<p>gressed, were deposited the weapons identified by witnesses, the ma-
</p>
<p>chine used by the Rebel War Department as a key to communications
</p>
<p>written in cipher, the articles found on the dead assassin's person,
</p>
<p>with a mass of law-books, notes of testimony, &c.
</p>
<p>In the centre of the room was a stand for witnesses, who were re-
</p>
<p>quired to face the Court while being examined ; although many of
</p>
<p>them would persist in turning towaids the prisoners' counsel whde
</p>

<p>General Hunter.
</p>
<p>Behind the witness-stand, and parallel with the southern s.de of
</p>
<p>the room, was a long table, whicb was occupied by reporters and
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.  11
</p>
<p>correspondents during the public sessions of the Court. At the
</p>
<p>foot of tbis table sat the counsel for the prisoners after they had
</p>
<p>been introduced.
</p>
<p>The prisoner's "dock" was a platform raised about one foot
</p>
<p>from the floor, and about four feet broad, with a strong railing in
</p>
<p>front of it. Along this "Jock" sat the prisoners. Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>had the left-hand corner to herself; a passage-way to the door lead-
</p>
<p>ing to the cells intervening between her and the seven male pris-
</p>
<p>oners, who sat sandwiched with six soldiers who wore the light-blue
</p>
<p>unifoi-m of the Veteran Reserve Corps. Dr. Mudd wore hand-
</p>
<p>tufis connected with chains; but the " bracelets" of the other male
</p>
<p>prisoners were joined by wide bars of u-on ten inches long, which
</p>
<p>kept their hands apart. All of the prisoners, including IMrs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt, wore anklets connected by short chains, which hamper their
</p>
<p>walk ; and heavy iron balls were also attached by chains to the limbs
</p>
<p>of Payne and Atzerodt, attendants carrymg them as they go to and
</p>
<p>from then- cells. As the prisoners entered and loft the room, their
</p>
<p>fetters clanking at every step, they formed an unpressivc procession.
</p>
<p>As seen by the Coui-t and the gentlemen of the press, they sat
</p>
<p>in the following order : 
</p>
<p>Samuel Arnold, a young Baltimorean, had a rather intelligent
</p>
<p>face, with curly brown hair and restless dark eyes. He was a
</p>
<p>schoolmate of the President's assassin ; and, at the breaking-out of
</p>
<p>the llebcllion, he joined the rebel army. An original conspirator,
</p>
<p>his courage failed liim ; and he went some weeks before the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation to Fortress Monroe, where he was clerk to a sutler when
</p>
<p>aiTcsted.
</p>
<p>Samuel A. Mudd, M.D., was the most inoffensive and decent in
</p>
<p>appearance of all the prisoners. He was about forty years of age,
</p>
<p>rather tall, and quite thin, with sharp features, a high bald forehead,
</p>
<p>astute blue eyes, compressed pale lips, and sandy hair, whiskers, and
</p>
<p>mustache. lie took a deep interest in the testimony, often promptr
</p>
<p>ing his counsel during the cross-examinations.
</p>
<p>Edward Spanglcr was a middle-aged man, with a largo, unintelli-

</p>
<p>gent-looking face, evidently swollen by an intemperate use of ardent
</p>
<p>spirits, a low forehead, anxious-looking gray eyes, and brown hair.
</p>
<p>He was born in the interior of Pennsylvania, where be has respectable
</p>
<p>12 TITE^ TniAL.
</p>
<p>connections; nml, after having been employed at Ford's Tbeatro in
</p>
<p>Baltimore as a stage-carpenter, came to Washington with Mr. Ford
</p>
<p>when he built the house in which 5Ir. Lincoln was assassinated.
</p>
<p>Doleful as Flpangler looked when in Court, the guards declared that
</p>
<p>he was the most loquacious and jovial of the prisoners when in his
</p>
<p>cell.
</p>
<p>Blichael O'Lauglilin, like Arnold, was a Baltimore friend of the
</p>
<p>principal assassin, and at one time a soldier in the rebel army. He
</p>
<p>was a rather small, delicate-looking man, with rather pleasing
</p>
<p>features, uneasy black eyes, bushy black hair, a heavy black mus-
</p>
<p>tache and imperial, and a most anxious expression of countenance,
</p>
<p>shaded by a sad, remorseful look.
</p>
<p>George B. Atzerodt was a type of those Teutonic Dugald Dal-
</p>
<p>gettys who have taken an active part in the war for the suppression
</p>
<p>of the Kchcllion,  sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the
</p>
<p>other, as bounties, or chances to pillage, were presented. He wa.s
</p>
<p>bom in Germany, but was raised and lived among the " poor white
</p>
<p>trash " in Charles County, Bid. ; working as a blacksmith until the
</p>
<p>war broke out, when ho became a blockade-runner. He was a short,
</p>
<p>thick-set, round-shouldered, brawny-armed man, with a stupid ex-
</p>
<p>pression, high cheek-bones, a sallow complexion, small grayish-blue
</p>
<p>eyes, tangled light-brown hair, and straggling sandy whiskers and
</p>
<p>mustache. Ho apparently manifested a stoicid indifference to what
</p>
<p>was going on in the Court, although an occasional cat-like glance
</p>
<p>would reveal his anxiety concerning himself. Evidently crafty,
</p>
<p>cowardly, and mercenary, his own safety was evidently the all-absorb-
</p>
<p>ing subject of his thoughts.
</p>
<p>Lewis Payne was the observed of all observei-s, as he sat motion-
</p>
<p>less and impcrturbed, defiantly returning each gaze at his remarka-
</p>
<p>ble fixce and person. He was very tall, with an athletic, gladiatorial
</p>
<p>frame ; the tight knit shirt which was his only upper garment dis-
</p>
<p>closinf the massive robustness of animal manhood in its most stal-
</p>
<p>wart type. Neither intellect nor intelligence was discernible in his
</p>
<p>unflinching dark gray eyes, low forehead, massive jaws, compressed

</p>
<p>full lips, small nose with large nostrils, and stolid, remorseless ex-
</p>
<p>pression. His dark hair hung over his forehead, his face was beard-
</p>
<p>less, and Ms hands were not those of a man who had been accustomed

</p>
<p>to labor. Report said that ho was a Kontuckian by bh-th, and one of
</p>
<p>a family of notorious desperadoes ; one of his brothers having been
</p>
<p>such a depraved criminal, that the rebels hung him. But, for weeks
</p>
<p>after the trial commenced, all that was certainly known of him was,
</p>
<p>that he was the ruffian who made the ferocious series of assaults on
</p>
<p>Secretary Seward and his family.
</p>
<p>David E. Herold was a doltish,' insignificant-looking young man,
</p>
<p>not much over one and twenty years of age, with a slender frame,
</p>
<p>and irresolute, cowardly appearance. lie liad a narrow forehead, a
</p>
<p>somewhat Israolitish nose, small dark hazel eyes, thick black hair,
</p>
<p>and an incipient mustache which occupied much of his attention.
</p>
<p>Few would imagine that any villain would select such a contempti-
</p>
<p>ble-looking fellow as an accomplice.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Mai-y E. Surratt, who was a belle in her youth, has borno
</p>
<p>her five and forty years or more bravely ; and, when she raised her
</p>
<p>veil in court that some witness might identify her, she exposed rather
</p>
<p>pleasing features, with dark gray eyes and brown hair. "While
</p>
<p>some of the spectators could see upon her foce a haunting revelation
</p>
<p>of some tragic sorrow resembling that which Guide's art has stamped
</p>
<p>ujion the features of Beatrice Cenci, others declared that she was
</p>
<p>evidently the devoted mother of an attached family, of jjIous senti-
</p>
<p>ments, and evidently deserving the recommendations so lavishly given
</p>
<p>of her by her religious advisers. Whether she was guilty or innocent,
</p>
<p>it was easy to perceive that she desired to make a favorable impression
</p>
<p>upon the court, and to inspire feelings of pity. Those who had
</p>
<p>hunted up her antecedents ascertained that she received a good edu-
</p>
<p>cation, and was married to Surratt about the year 183.5 ; the youn"
</p>
<p>couple settling on a farm near Washington, which he had inherited.
</p>
<p>After they had lived there, their house was set on fire by one of their
</p>
<p>slaves, who seemed to have been infuriated by the cruel treatment to
</p>
<p>which he had been subjected. Surratt afterwards made some money
</p>
<p>as a contractor on a Virginia railroad, and, on his return to Jlary-
</p>
<p>land, purchased the place afterwards known as Surratt's, where he
</p>
<p>established a tavern, and was appointed postmaster. He sympa-

<p>thized with secession; and, before his death, one of his sons, Isaac,
</p>
<p>went South, and 'joined the rebel army. After Surratt's death, his

<p>Each of the prisoners pleaded " Not guilty " to the charges and

<p>specifications. They were then permitted to designate such counsel

<p>as they desired to employ.
</p>
<p>Before adjourning, the Commission agreed upon the rules by which
</p>
<p>it would be governed. It was determined on to exclude all persons
</p>
<p>except those officially engaged in the trials, and to swear them to
</p>
<p>secrecy. The testimony, when written out by the phouographers,
</p>
<p>was to be placed in the hands of the Judge Advocate General, wiio
</p>
<p>was to designate such portions of it as he might think could be pub-
</p>
<p>lished without injury to the interests of the Government. This ac-
</p>
<p>tion of secrecy was based upon the fact that the developments of the
</p>
<p>trial would implicate many parties not under arrest, who might escape
</p>
<p>should publicity be given to the proceedings. It was also asserted
</p>
<p>that several witnesses were in great trepidation, fearing that they

</p>
<p>A'. When we came back from Pennsylvania, after the battle of
</p>
<p>THE TUT A L. 21
</p>
<p>Gettysburg, I was ordered with another engineer-lieutenant, who
</p>
<p>was very sick, to convey him to his home at Staunton, in the Val-
</p>
<p>ley of Mrginia ; and from there I took my way back to find the
</p>
<p>army a"-aiii ; and near Ilarrisonburg, twenty-five miles from Staun-
</p>
<p>tcm, at Swift Run Gap, I was overtaken by three citizens, with
</p>
<p>whom I got better acquainted after having ridden a while with
</p>
<p>tlicm ; and T found them out to belong to Maryland. The name
</p>
<p>of one was Booth, and the other one's name was Shepherd.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember the features of Booth 'i
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember the features of all of them.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at that photograph. [Handing to the witness a photo-
</p>
<p>gi-aph of J. Wilkes Booth.]
</p>
<p>A. There is a resemblance ; but the face was fuller.
</p>
<p>Q. You think it is the same person, but he had a fuller face
</p>
<p>than this ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe it is.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you learn at that time that it was John Wilkes Booth,
</p>
<p>the actor?
</p>
<p>A. I heard the other gentlemen call him Booth. I thought
</p>
<p>first it was a nickname ; but afterwards I found out that it was
</p>
<p>Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. How far did you ride with those persons?
</p>
<p>A. We staid at the tavern at the foot of the mountain until the
</p>
<p>next day. There I got better acquainted with them.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were you together? How many hours do you
</p>
<p>suppose ?
</p>
<p>A. Eighteen or twenty hours.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any free conversations in regard to public af-
</p>
<p>fairs while you were with him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what Booth said to you in regard to any con-
</p>
<p>templated purpose of attack upon the President of the United
</p>
<p>States ? State all that he said.
</p>
<p>A. I was asked by Booth, and by those others too, what I

</p>
<p>thouglit of the probable success of the Confederacy ; aud I told
</p>
<p>them, that, after .such a chase <is wo had tlien got from Gettysburg,
</p>
<p>I believed it looked rather gloomy. And then Booth told me, " That
</p>
<p>"Z-J. THE TllIAL.
</p>
<p>is nonsense : if we only act oui- part right, the Confederacy will
</p>
<p>gain their inilopendence ; old Abo Lincoln must go up the s])out,
</p>
<p>and the Confederacy will gain their independence anyhow." That
</p>
<p>was the expression at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you understand by the expression, be "must go
</p>
<p>up the spout," from all that Booth said?
</p>
<p>A. It was a common csprcs.sion, meaning he must be killed.
</p>
<p>That I understood always.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state under what circumstances that would become
</p>
<p>necessary ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho SMd so soon as the Confederacy wm near giving out, so
</p>
<p>soon as they were neaily whipped, that must bo dune ; that would
</p>
<p>be the final resource to gain the independence of the Confederacy.
</p>
<p>Q. Did the citizens who were with him engage in conversat ion ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sii\
</p>
<p>Q. Did they seem to assent to his sentiments ?
</p>
<p>A. Certainly.
</p>
<p>Q. Did not Booth know that you were a Confederate soldier?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. They asked, when they overtook me on tlie road,
</p>
<p>where I was gomg to. I told th^m I belonged to General Edward
</p>
<p>Johnson's staff, and was going to the army, coming from Staunton.
</p>
<p>Q. At what pomt did you arrive together ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know the name of the place : it is near the foot of
</p>
<p>the Swift Run Gap.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you meet there a number of Confederate officers  I
</p>
<p>speak of the end of your ride  with the Stonewall Brigade ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, su'. That was about three or four days afterwards.
</p>
<p>They went from me the nest day. My horse could not keep up
</p>
<p>with the other horses : they were splendidly mounted, and my
</p>
<p>horse was newly broken down ; so they went on. Three or four
</p>
<p>days afterwards, I was called to some of the regimental camps, and
</p>
<p>told that some strangers, fliends of mine, wanted to see me. I
</p>
<p>did not know who it was. Wien I came to camp, I found those
</p>
<p>three citizens, and was introduced by Captain Randolph personally,

</p>
<p>formally to Booth and Stephens.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that the Stonewall Brigade?
</p>
<p>A. It was the camp of the Second Vu-ginia Regiment.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 23
</p>
<p>Q. Do you or do you not know whotlier there was a scwet
</p>
<p>meeting of rebel officers on that occasion V
</p>
<p>A. That evening there was a secret meeting, where I was not
</p>
<p>admitted.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they state to you the purpose bf that meeting, and wiiat
</p>
<p>conclusion they reached ?
</p>
<p>A. Some oiBcer afterwards, who was about the meeting, stated
</p>
<p>to me what was the purpose of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Booth in that meeting ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe so. They were all in together.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he state to you was the determination and purpose
</p>
<p>of that meeting?
</p>
<p>A. The purpose of the meeting was, as I was informed after-
</p>
<p>wards, to send certain ofiBcers on detached service to Canada and
</p>
<p>the borders, and to deliver prisoners, to lay Northern cities in ash-
</p>
<p>es, and finally to get after the members of the Cabinet, and kill
</p>
<p>the President. That was the main purpose. I heard that more
</p>
<p>than a thousand times, but never so much as at the time when I
</p>
<p>was informed it was the purpose of the meeting. I always consid-
</p>
<p>ered it connnon braggadocio before.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the name of the officer who gave you this account
</p>
<p>of the proceedings of the meeting ?
</p>
<p>A. Lieutenant Cockerill.
</p>
<p>Q. To what portion of the service did he belong, do you know ?
</p>
<p>A. To the Second Virginia Regiment, I believe, and the same
</p>
<p>company that Captain Beall belonged to,  the captain who was
</p>
<p>executed at Governor's Island.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any thing said as to what part Captain Beall  the
</p>
<p>one afterwards executed  was to play Lu these movements at the
</p>
<p>North ?
</p>
<p>A. Cockerill told mo Beall was on detached service, and we
</p>
<p>would hear of him.
</p>
<p>Q. Cockerill was a member of that meeting, I understood you
</p>
<p>to say ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you, while there, sec Booth and Cockerill associated to-
</p>
<p>gether ?
</p>
<p>24 THE TniM.
</p>
<p>A. I (lid nnt see tlieiii particularly. I saw tliem all in a crowd
</p>
<p>together.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Booth associating with all the officers ?
</p>
<p>A. He was associating with a gi-eat many of tbcm.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know of any other secret association or meeting,
</p>
<p>having similar objects, at any time in the service with which you
</p>
<p>have been conuceted ?
</p>
<p>A. I heard of the existence of secret orders for certain pur-
</p>
<p>poses to assist the Confederacy. I licard one name \ery frequent-
</p>
<p>ly called, the name of one order, the "Golden Circle;" and sev-
</p>
<p>eral times I heard the name of the " Sons of Liberty."
</p>
<p>Q. How many years do you state you were in the Confederate
</p>
<p>service 1
</p>
<p>A. Not quite three years.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether, during the last year or two, since the reverses
</p>
<p>of the Confederacy have commenced, it has not been freely and
</p>
<p>frequently spoken of in the rebel service as an object finally to be
</p>
<p>accomplished,  the assassination of the President of the United
</p>
<p>States?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I heard that veiy often.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you not heard it spoken of freely in the streets of
</p>
<p>Richmond, among those connected with the Eebel Government ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. About what time ? When is the latest you can now recall
</p>
<p>having heard declarations of that sort at Richmond ?
</p>
<p>A. At the time after the battle of Chancellorsville, when I do
</p>
<p>not know what general it was, but believe it was General Kilpat-
</p>
<p>riek, who was on a raid near Richmond,  at that time I heard it.
</p>
<p>I was in Richmond on a furlough at the same time.
</p>
<p>Q. Whenever and wherever spoken of, do I understand you to
</p>
<p>say that this sentiment of the necessity of the assassination of the
</p>
<p>President of the United States was generally assented to in the ser-
</p>
<p>vice?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

</p>
<p>Q. The " detached sei-vice " of which you speak, on which
</p>
<p>these parties were to be sent, you say related to Canada and the
</p>
<p>destruction of tlie Nortljern cities along the Canada frontier ?
</p>
<p>THE T n I A L. 25
</p>
<p>A. It was outside of the Coufederate lines,  either here in the
</p>
<p>Northern cities or in Canada.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you understand that the " detached senico " was to be
</p>
<p>perfoi-med m tliat dii-eotion along the Canada frontier and in our
</p>
<p>Northern cities 'I
</p>
<p>A. This " detached service " was a nickname in the Confeder-
</p>
<p>ate army for such purposes.
</p>
<p>Q. It meant that sort of warfare ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, SU-.
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke of laying the Northern cities in ashes. Di<l you
</p>
<p>understand that that was the mode in which that waifare was to be
</p>
<p>conducted, by firing our cities ?
</p>
<p>^ A.^ Yes, sir: by firing the cities down and getting the people
</p>
<p>dissatisfied with the war, and by that means to bring forward a rev-
</p>
<p>olution amongst the people in the North. That was the purpose.
</p>
<p>No cross-examination.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate offered in evidence, without objection, the
</p>
<p>photograph of J. Wilkes Booth, shown to the witness Van Stein-
</p>
<p>aoker. It is attached to this record, and marked Exhibit No. 1.

<p>Q. Will you state whether or not in the month of November last

<p>you wore riding in the railroad cars of New-York City, the Third-

<p>Avenue cars, and whether you observed that there were two men in
</p>
<p>the cars that attracted your attention, one of whom, on leavmg the
</p>
<p>cars, dropped a letter which you picked up ?
</p>
<p>A. I was going down to the city. There were two gentlemen in
</p>
<p>the car. Whether they were in or not when I got in I am not con-
</p>
<p>fident. I overheard their conversation : they were talking most
</p>
<p>earnestly. One of them said he would leave for Washington The day

</p>
<p>that iii^lit. Thoy left the car : tho man tliat was sitting near mo
</p>
<p>pusbcffhis hat forward, ami with that pushorl his whiskers at tho
</p>
<p>same time; they were false whiskers. The front-face was much
</p>
<p>darker than it was under tho whiskers.
</p>
<p>Q. Was ho a young man V
</p>
<p>A. Ho was young.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you would recognize his features again?
</p>
<p>A. I think I should.
</p>
<p>Q. [E.'ihibiting to the witness tho photograjih of Booth, E.xhibit
</p>
<p>No. 1.] Look at that, and say whether it recalls him to you.
</p>
<p>A. The face is the same : he had a scar on his right cheek.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it on the cheek, or nock ?
</p>
<p>A. It was something like a bite, near the jawbone.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you judge from his conversation that he was a man of
</p>
<p>education and culture ?
</p>
<p>A. He was a man of education, and tho other was not. The
</p>
<p>other's name was Johnson.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you observe his hands ? Did he seem to have been a
</p>
<p>man who had led a life of ease or not ?
</p>
<p>A. Tho hand that was ungloved was very beautiful : tho other
</p>
<p>hand had a gauntlet on. They exchanged letters in the cai-s. The
</p>
<p>one who had false whiskers put back the letters in his pocket ; and
</p>
<p>I saw a pistol in his belt.
</p>
<p>Q. Did any of the conversation fall on your ears ? Were you
</p>
<p>able to hear it ?
</p>
<p>A. I overheard him say he would leave for Washington tho day
</p>
<p> after to-morrow.
</p>
<p>Q. That is the one who had the ungloved hand and false whis-
</p>
<p>kers?
</p>
<p>A. Yes ; and the other was very angry because it had not fallen
</p>
<p>on him to go to Washington : he had been sent for to some place by
</p>
<p>a messenger.
</p>
<p>Q. You say he seemed very an,gry because it had not fallen to
</p>
<p>his lot to go to Wa<hina;ton instead of the other V

<p>A. Yes, sir. I had letters of my own to post at the Nassau-street

</p>
<p>cri. Jly dancliter said that I had dropped one of ray letters. She
</p>
<p>picked sometliiiig up, and gave it to me. When I wont down (o the
</p>
<p>broker's, where I was going with some gold, I went to take out ray
</p>
<p>pocket-book, and I saw an envelope with two letters in it. I
</p>
<p>thought it of importance because of the conversation.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you certain it is the envelope with the letters dropped by
</p>
<p>one of these men ?
</p>
<p>A. It must iiavc been, because I saw them exchange letters, and
</p>
<p>there was no one else at that seat.
</p>
<p>Q. AVas it picked up at the point where they were sitting ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, just at the end of my dress.
</p>
<p>Q. Would you recognize the envelope if you were to see it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting an envelope Ts-ith two letters.] Look at that, and
</p>
<p>see if it is the same envelope and letter.
</p>
<p>A. It is the same.
</p>
<p>Q. Were both letters in that envelope as you now have them ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>The letters were then presented and read to the Commission, as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>Dear Louis,  The time has at last come that wo have all so
</p>
<p>wished for, and upon you every thing depends. As it was decided
</p>
<p>before you left, we were to east lots. Accordingly, we did so ; and
</p>
<p>you are to be the Charlotte Corday of tlie nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>When you remember the fearful, solemn vow that was taken by
</p>
<p>us, you will feel there is no drawback. Abe must die, and now.
</p>
<p>You can choose your weapons,  the cup, the hvfe, the bullet.
</p>
<p>The cup failed us once, and might again. Johnson, who will give
</p>
<p>this, has been like an enraged demon since the meeting, because it
</p>
<p>has not fallen upon him to rid the world of the monster. He says
</p>
<p>the blood of his gray-haired father and his noble brother call upon
</p>
<p>him for revenge, and revenge he will have : if he cannot wreak it
</p>
<p>upon the fountain-head, he will upon some of the blood-thirsty gen-
</p>
<p>erals. Butler would suit him. As our plans were all concocted

<p>Dearest Husband, Why do you not come home '; You left

</p>
<p>Q. Do you know John H. Sun-att, of this city?

<p>of Mississippi, who was Secretary of the Interior under the Admin-
</p>
<p>istration of President Buchanan ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 35
</p>
<p>A. I saw Mr. Thompson, Sir. Clay, Blr. Tucker, and several
</p>
<p>others. They were pointed out to me ; but I was not acquainted
</p>
<p>with those gentlemen.
</p>
<p>Q. You mean Clement C. Clay of Alabama, formerly United-
</p>
<p>States senator V
</p>
<p>A. That was the man. I mean him. I presume he was the
</p>
<p>man. He was pointed out to me as that person.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have conversations with Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : I spoke to him. I asked him what he was doing
</p>
<p>there. I asked him, "Are you going to play here?" knowinn'
</p>
<p>that he was an actor. He said, "No, he was not." Said I, " What
</p>
<p>are you going to do ? " Said he, "I just came hero on a visit, a
</p>
<p>pleasure-trip. I saw in the papers afterwards that he had been try-
</p>
<p>ing to make an engagement with Buckland, of the Theatre Koyal
</p>
<p>there ; but I do not believe it.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you saw him talking to Clay, Sanders, Holcomb,
</p>
<p>and Thompson ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe I did. I am not very positive that I saw him talk-
</p>
<p>ing to those parties ; but I did see him talk to Sanders. That I
</p>
<p>can swear to, becau.se I was standing up against a pillar in the
</p>
<p>hotel ; and it was right in the hotel. Sanders was loaning against
</p>
<p>a pillar, and Booth standing in front of him.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you have seen the others with Sanders ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I do not know that I saw them there standing
</p>
<p>talking to Sanders that day ; but I have seen those other men with
</p>
<p>Sanders at different times talking to him.
</p>
<p>Q. And with Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I will not say that. I saw Booth talking to Sanders, though .
</p>
<p>Of that I am positive, because those two wore standing together
</p>
<p>when I came up. I just came from the post-office, which is opposite
</p>
<p>the hotel. I came over, and saw them talking there. I was sur-
</p>
<p>prised to see him ; and that is what made me take particular notice
</p>
<p>of it. I thought, as a matter of course, he came there to play.
</p>
<p>Q. When was the next time you saw Booth ?

</p>
<p>A. The nest time I saw Booth was on the steps of the Kirkwood
</p>
<p>House, in this city, the night of the 14th of April, a few minutes
</p>
<p>before five, or between five and six o'clock.
</p>
<p>30 THE rniAL.
</p>
<p>Q. What occurred then ?
</p>
<p>A. He was going into the hotel. I was standing talking to a
</p>
<p>young man named Callan, I think, who works in one of the departs
</p>
<p>ments : he was formerly a sergeant of cavali-y, I think. I said to
</p>
<p>Callan, " I would like to go up to \Villard's Llotcl, and sec if wo
</p>
<p>can see General Grant." I had never seen him. Said I, " Will
</p>
<p>you come, and go along? " He said, " No : I have got an engage-
</p>
<p>ment to be here at five o'clock to meet some person." So I did
</p>
<p>not go, but went into the hotel, saying, " I wonder what time it is
</p>
<p>now : it must be time for your friend to come, if he is coming." I
</p>
<p>went in, and found it was five, or a few minutes of it ; and said I,
</p>
<p>"I guess you can go now: that engagement is up." He said,
</p>
<p>" No : I will wait a little longer." Just then. Booth passed me,
</p>
<p>going into the hotel, and turned round and spoke to me. I asked
</p>
<p>him when he came from Canada ; for I did not know he had left
</p>
<p>there. He said ho had been back some time, and was going to stay
</p>
<p>here some time, and would see me again. I asked, " Are you going
</p>
<p>to play hero again?" Said he, "No: I am not going to play
</p>
<p>again : I am in tlie oil business." I laughed and joked at that; it
</p>
<p>being a common joke to talk about the oil business. A few min-
</p>
<p>utes afterwards, I saw him coming down street on horseback, on
</p>
<p>a bay horse. I took particular notice what kind of a looking rig he
</p>
<p>had on the horse. I do not know what made me do it. The next
</p>
<p>I saw of him I heard the speech, and saw him jump out of the box
</p>
<p>at the theatre ; and, when he fell, he fell on one hand and one knee,
</p>
<p>and I recognized him. He fell with his face towards the audience.
</p>
<p>I said, " He is John Wilkes Booth, and he has shot the President ! "
</p>
<p>I made that remark right there. That is the last ever I saw of him,
</p>
<p>when he was running across the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you are certain you saw him and Sanders drinking
</p>
<p>together, as well as talking ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, I did : I am siu-e of it. Sanders says he never
</p>
<p>saw him ; but Sanders tells a lie, because ho did see him. I saw
</p>
<p>him talking to him.

<p>Cross-examined by Mb. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you resided in this city?
</p>
<p>A. I have been off and on here for a year or two. I was for-

</p>
<p>merly an ofiBeer in the army. Fourth JIaiyland Kcgiment, as lieuten-
</p>
<p>ant in Company E. I was in the employ of Adams's Express Com-
</p>
<p>pany a great many years, and worked with them in Washington for
</p>
<p>some time.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with any of the prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of.
</p>
<p>Q. You are not acquainted with John II. Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. No, su- : I never saw him in my life, to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Why did you say it was John Wilkes Booth, and that ho
</p>
<p>had shot the President ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not know Mr. Lincoln had been .shot ; Ijut it flashed
</p>
<p>on my mind, when Booth jumped out of that box, that he had done
</p>
<p>such a thing, because I knew the President was in the box : I saw
</p>
<p>him go in, and I heard the pistol-shot, and the words, " Sic semper
</p>
<p>tyrannis;" and I knew from my schoolboy knowledge that was the
</p>
<p>motto of the State of Virginia.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. You say Booth shouted, " Sic semper tyrannis " ?
</p>
<p>A. I heard the words in the box. I think it was Booth said
</p>
<p>that. I heard the words before I saw the man.
</p>
<p>Q. Had he his knife in his hand as he went across the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. He had.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he make any remark as he crossed the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. It is said he did ; but I did not notice it. The excitement
</p>
<p>was so great, that I did not notice it. I can safely swear that I did
</p>
<p>not hear any remark ; at least, I cannot call to mind that I did.

<p>Buchanan's Administration ?
</p>
<p>38 TnE TltlAL.
</p>
<p>A. I mot hiiu once : thut wus wlien the amiy was lying opposite
</p>
<p>Vicksburg, at what is called Millikcn's Bend and Young's Point.
</p>
<p>A little Loat was discovered combg up on the opposite shore, appa-
</p>
<p>rently surreptitiously, trying to avoid detection ; and a little tug was
</p>
<p>sent out from the navy to pick it up. AVhen they got to it, they
</p>
<p>found a little white flag sticking out of the stem of the row-boat,
</p>
<p>and Jacob Thompson in it. They brought him to Admiral Porter's
</p>
<p>flag-ship ; and I was sent for, and met him. I do not recollect now
</p>
<p>the ostensible business he had. There seemed to be nothing impor-
</p>
<p>tant at all in the visit ; but he pretended to be under a flag of
</p>
<p>truce, and therefore he had to be allowed to go back a"-ain.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say whether it was in January or February, 1863.
</p>
<p>. It was the first flag of truce we had, though.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he profess to be, and seem to be, in the military service
</p>
<p>of the rebels ?
</p>
<p>A. He said he had been ofifered a commission,  any thing that
</p>
<p>he wanted ; but, knowing that he was not a military man, he pre-
</p>
<p>ferred having something more like a civil appointment, and he had
</p>
<p>taken the place of an inspector-general in the rebel service.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he then hold that position ?
</p>
<p>A. That was what he said ; that he was an inspector-general, or
</p>
<p>assistant inspector-general, with the rank of lieutenantKJolonel, I
</p>
<p>think he said.
</p>
<p>Q. The MiUtary Department of Washington, as it is spoken of
</p>
<p>in military parlance, embraces the city of Washington, does it not ?
</p>
<p>and did it not during the past year ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And all the defences of the city ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and on the other side of the river, and Alexandria.
</p>
<p>Q. It embraces all the fortifications on both sides ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. I have in my hand a copy of your commission as lieutenant-
</p>
<p>general of tlic armies of the Unitoil States, bearing date the 4th day

<p>Cross-examined by BIr. Aikex :
</p>
<p>Q. Are you awai'c that the civil courts are in operation in this

<p>city, all of them ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How far towards Baltimore does the Department of Washing-
</p>
<p>ton extend ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not say exactly to what point. Any troops that
</p>
<p>belong to General Augur's command, however, that he sends out to
</p>
<p>any point, would necessarily remain under his command. He com-
</p>
<p>mands the Department of Washington.
</p>
<p>Q. Is any portion of the State of Maryland in the Department
</p>
<p>of Washington ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes, sir! Martial law, I believe, extends to all the ter-
</p>
<p>ritory south of the railroad that runs across from Annapolis, running
</p>
<p>south to the Potomac and the Chesapeake.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined liy IMu. Ewino :
</p>
<p>Q. By virtue of what order does martial law extend south of
</p>
<p>Annapolis ?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw the order. It is just simply an understanding.
</p>
<p>Q. It is just an understanding ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; just an understanding that it does exist.
</p>
<p>Q. You have never seen any order V
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And do not know that such an order exists ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have never seen the order.

</p>
<p>Q. Were you acquainted with J. Wilkes Booth in his lifetime ?
</p>
<p>A. I
</p>
<p>was.
</p>
<p>40 THE TlilAL.
</p>
<p>Q. What relation did you sustain to him ? Were you his agent ?
</p>
<p>A. I was his business agent, really.
</p>
<p>Q. In what region of country, and in connection with wliat
</p>
<p>business '?
</p>
<p>A. I was principally in the oil region. I did snino little busi-
</p>
<p>ness for iiim in the city of Boston, but very little, which was
</p>
<p>entirely closed up before I left there.
</p>
<p>Q. Wiiat was the character of liis interest there in the oil region ?
</p>
<p>A. lie owned a third undivided interest, at first, in a lease of
</p>
<p>thi-ee and a half acres on the Alleghany River, near Franklin.
</p>
<p>Q. For which he paid how much ?
</p>
<p>A. It was bought by means of contracting to pay off the old
</p>
<p>debts of that lease, and carry on the work. Afterward the land
</p>
<p>interest was bought, he furnishing one-half of the purchase-money
</p>
<p>of the land-interest, and owning one undivided third as before
</p>
<p>stated.
</p>
<p>Q. How much did he pay ?
</p>
<p>A. The land-interest cost $4,000. He paid $2,000,  one-
</p>
<p>half of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he maie any other investments on which he paid
</p>
<p>money '?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the total amount of them ?
</p>
<p>A. He purchased, for $1,000, an interest in an association there
</p>
<p>owning an undivided thirtieth of 'a tract.
</p>
<p>Q. What other purchases did he make ?
</p>
<p>A. That is all that he ever absolutely purchased. There was
</p>
<p>money spent in carrying on the expenses of this lease previous to
</p>
<p>his purchase of the land-interest. At the time of the purchase of
</p>
<p>the land-interest, the work was stopped, and there were no more
</p>
<p>expenses.
</p>
<p>Q. These interests of which you speak were all that he possessed
</p>
<p>in the oil region ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : all that he ever possessed in Venango, to my knowl-

<p>edge.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ever realize any thing from them ?
</p>
<p>A. Not a dollar.
</p>
<p>Til E T n I A I..
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>Q. They were a total loss ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, as far as he was concerned.
</p>
<p>Q. When (lid this occur ? In what year?
</p>
<p>A. The first interest he acquired in any way was either in De-
</p>
<p>cember, 1863, or January, 18(34 : I cannot say as to the dale. It
</p>
<p>was only from his report to me that I knew of it. My first knowl-
</p>
<p>cdso of it was in May, 1864. I accompanied him to the oil
</p>
<p>regions in June, 1864, for the purpose of taking charge of his
</p>
<p>business there.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you given the total amount of the investment that
</p>
<p>Booth made ? What do you consider the total amount ?
</p>
<p>A. The whole amount invested by him in this Alleghany-River
</p>
<p>property, in every way, was about $5,000. I cannot give the
</p>
<p>exact figures in dollars and cents.
</p>
<p>Q. And the other investment was about $1,000 ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Making $6,000 in all ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And that you know to have been a total loss to him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; that is, it was transferred. His business was en-
</p>
<p>tirely closed out there in the latter part of September, 1864 : I
</p>
<p>think, on the '27th of September.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it placed in your hands as trustee ? or to whom was it
</p>
<p>transfen-cd ?
</p>
<p>A. There were three owners, as I have told you. He held an
</p>
<p>undivided thu-d. The three owners all decided to place the prop-
</p>
<p>erty in my hands as trustee to hold for them. It was so mentioned
</p>
<p>in the deed, and their several names were mentioned in the deed.
</p>
<p>Immediately upon the execution of that deed, he asked me to make
</p>
<p>a deed conveying his interest away, which I did in accordance with
</p>
<p>hLs instructions. Those deeds were properly executed, conveying
</p>
<p>his whole interest away in that way. At the same time, this other
</p>
<p>interest in a different portion of the county, on a diiferent stream,

<p>for which he had paid $1,000, he also transfen-ed, which was done
</p>
<p>by a diiferent process, by assignment on the receipt which he held
</p>
<p>for his interest.
</p>
<p>Q. This was all done last fall ? 
</p>
<p>i*
</p>
<p>42 THE rniAL.
</p>
<p>A. It was done in September : I think, tlie 27th or 28th of the
</p>
<p>month. I cannot bo exact as to the date. It was done the day he
</p>
<p>left Franklin, the last time I ever saw him.
</p>
<p>Q. Were the conveyances without compensation or voluntary
</p>
<p>gifts?
</p>
<p>A. One was made to his brother, Junius Brutus Booth, which
</p>
<p>was without compensation ; but a consideration was mentioned in
</p>
<p>the deed.
</p>
<p>Q. But there was none in fact ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; none in fact. The other was to me, and the same
</p>
<p>consideration was mentioned ; but it was done in consideration of
</p>
<p>my services, for which I have never received any other pay.
</p>
<p>Q. There was nothing paid him at all on either of them ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not a dollar : and ho paid all the expenses of the
</p>
<p>transfer and the conveyances.
</p>
<p>Samuel P. Jones (blind),
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you resided in Richmond at any time during the war ?
</p>
<p>A. I have.
</p>
<p>Q. State any conversations you may have heard there, to which
</p>
<p>officers of the Eebel Government were parties, in regard to the con-
</p>
<p>templated assassination of the President of the United States.
</p>
<p>A. The nearest I know any thing to that point among the officers
</p>
<p>there is their common conversation in camp, as I would go about
</p>
<p>amongst them ; and their conversations would be of this nature : That
</p>
<p>all suspicious persons, or those kind of people they were not certain
</p>
<p>were of their way of thinking, they would hush up as soon as they
</p>
<p>came near them. But, after I found out what I could learn in ref-
</p>
<p>erence to these things, they were desperately anxious that any such
</p>
<p>as this should be accompli.'^hcd.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state any particular occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. In a general way, I have beard sums offi;rcd, to be paid with

<p>a Confederate sum, for any person or persons to go North and assas-
</p>
<p>sinate the President.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 43
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember any occasion when any such ofTors were
</p>
<p>made, or any amount named, and by what kind of officers ?
</p>
<p>A. At this moment, I cannot tell you the particulai- names of
</p>
<p>shoulder-straps, &c.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you rcmombor any occasion,  some dinner occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. I can tell you this. I heard a citizen make the remark once,
</p>
<p>that ho would give from his private purse $10,000, in addition to
</p>
<p>the Confederate amount, tohave the President assassinated,  to bring
</p>
<p>him to Richmond, dead or alive, for proof.
</p>
<p>Q. What was meant by that phrase, " In addition to the Confed-
</p>
<p>erate amount" ?
</p>
<p>A. I know nothing about that, any more than the way they
</p>
<p>would express it. I should judge, from drawing an inference, that
</p>
<p>there was any amount offered by the Government, in that trashy pa-
</p>
<p>per, to assassinate any officials that were hindering their cause ; and
</p>
<p>even I have heai'd it down as low as a private or citizen. For m-
</p>
<p>stance, if it is not digressing from the purpose, I know of a Ken-
</p>
<p>tuckian, but cannot tell you the name now, that was putting up at
</p>
<p>the Exchange Hotel, or otherwise Ballard House (they belong to
</p>
<p>the same property, and are connected by a bridge over Franklin
</p>
<p>Street) . He was arrested under suspicion of being a spy. I can tell
</p>
<p>you the name now : his name was Webster, if I remember rightly.
</p>
<p>I always supposed, from what I understood, that he came down to
</p>
<p>buy goods ; but they took him as a spy, and hung him. Whether
</p>
<p>it was in reference to this assassination, I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that it was a subject of general con-
</p>
<p>versation among the rebel officers ?
</p>
<p>A. It was. The rebel officers, as they would be sitting around
</p>
<p>their tent-doors, would be conversing on such a subject a great deal.
</p>
<p>They would be saying they would like to see his head brought there,
</p>
<p>dead or alive, and they should think it could be done ; and I have
</p>
<p>heard such things stated as that they had certain persons undertak-
</p>
<p>ing it.

</p>
<p>44 THE rniAL.
</p>
<p>By tlio Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Your profession is that of an actor ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you known J. Wilkes Booth a good many years ?
</p>
<p>A. 1 liavo known liini about ton or eleven years,  since I first
</p>
<p>met liim.
</p>
<p>Q. Quite intimately, I suppose?
</p>
<p>A. For about six or seven years, intimately.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you recall a conversation which you are supposed to have
</p>
<p>had with him, in November last, in New York?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What time in the month was it ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was in November that I had a conversation with
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. What time in November? State about the period of time.
</p>
<p>A. I cannot think of the exact date ; but it was in the early por-
</p>
<p>tion of November. One day we were in conversation, and I asked
</p>
<p>him why he was not acting; and he told me that he did not intend to
</p>
<p>act in this portion of the country again ; that ho had taken iiis
</p>
<p>wardrobe to Canada, and intended to run the blockade.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you meet him after tliat, and have some conversation
</p>
<p>with him in regard to oil speculations? or was it at the same time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. The nest time I met him was about the time we
</p>
<p>were to play " Julius Caesar," which we did play on the 25th of No-
</p>
<p>vember ; and it was either on the 24th or 25th that he asked me to
</p>
<p>take a wallv with him, or asked if I know some costumers where ho
</p>
<p>might got some dresses for his character in that play ; and I asked
</p>
<p>him where his own wardrobe was.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that in the city of New York ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes. I never had any conversation with him relative to this
</p>
<p>affair out of New York. lie said it was still in Canada, in charfo
</p>
<p>of a friend, I think ho said, named Martin. I will not be posi-
</p>
<p>tive ; but I think he said it was in Montreal. He did not say any
</p>
<p>thing to me at all about the oil business then, that I remember,

</p>
<p>Q. Did ho not ask you how you would like to go into the oil
</p>
<p>business with him ?
</p>
<p>A. Not in the oil business. He never mentioned that.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 45
</p>
<p>Q. He told you he had a big speculation on hand ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q Did he ask you to go in wUli him ?
</p>
<p>A Yes sir I met hiiu. anil he was talking with some friends,
</p>
<p>and 'they were joking with hin, ahout the affair. I met him on
</p>
<p>Broadway After he left them, he said ho had a better speculation
</p>
<p>than that on hand, and one they would not laugh at. Some time
</p>
<p>after that I met him again, and he again talked of this spceulation,
</p>
<p>and aked me how I would like to go in with him. I told hmi I was
</p>
<p>without means ; that I could not : and he said it did not matter ; he
</p>
<p>always liked me, and would furnish the means. Ihe next time i
</p>
<p>heard from him, he was iu Washington.
</p>
<p>Q. State the whole of the conversation in which he urged you to
</p>
<p>eo into this speculation in New York. _ _
</p>
<p>A As well as I can remember, I will tell you from beginmng
</p>
<p>to end ^ He left me then in Now York ; and I received several let-
</p>
<p>ters from him from Washington, telling me he was speculating in
</p>
<p>farms in Lower Maryland and Virginia, and still telhng me that 1
</p>
<p>mu^t join him ; that it was sure to coin money ; that I must go in
</p>
<p>with him. I paid very little attention to it. Then, about the latter
</p>
<p>part of December or early in January, - 1 will not be po.sit.ve which
</p>
<p>it wa but late iu December or early in January,  he came to New
</p>
<p>York ' and came to n.y house. I then lived at No. 45, Grove Street.
</p>
<p>He asked me to take a walk with him. I did so. We went
</p>
<p>out and went to a saloon known as the House of Lords, on Houston
</p>
<p>Street We remained there a considerable time  I suppose an hour
</p>
<p>_ eatin^ and drinking. He had often mentioned this affair, that is,
</p>
<p>his speculation, but would never say what it was. If I would ask
</p>
<p>him what it was, he would say he would tell me by and by. ^ e
</p>
<p>left there, and went to another saloon, under the Eevere House, and
</p>
<p>ate some oysters. We tlien stai-ted up Broadway. I thought it
</p>
<p>was time to go home, and my way was down Bleeker Street, that
</p>
<p>is up Broadway from the corner of Houston ; and I had to turn
</p>
<p> down Bleeker Street to get to Grove Street. I bade him good-night

</p>
<p>He asked me to walk a piece farther up the street with him, and I
</p>
<p>did so I walked a square ; that is, to Fourth Street, or nest
</p>
<p>Street. He asked me to walk up there with hhn, and I did so. He
</p>
<p>46 TUE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>asked me to walk up Fourth Street because Broadway was crowded :
</p>
<p>bo said Fourth Street was not so full of people as Broadway, and he
</p>
<p>wanted to tell me about that speculation. 1 walked up there with
</p>
<p>him ; and, when we got into an unfrequented portion of the street, he
</p>
<p>stopped, and told mo then that he was in a large conspiracy to cap-
</p>
<p>ture the heads of the Government (including the President), and
</p>
<p>take them to Richmond. I asked him if that was what he wished me
</p>
<p>to go in. He said it was. I told him I could not do it ; that it was
</p>
<p>an impossibility ; only to think of my family. Ue said he had two or
</p>
<p>three thousand dollars that he could leave them. I still said I could
</p>
<p>not do it. He urged it, and talked with me for, I suppose, twenty
</p>
<p>minutes or half an hour ; and I still refused. He then told me that
</p>
<p>at least I would not betray him, and said I dare not. Ho said he
</p>
<p>could implicate me in the affair, anyhow. He said that the party
</p>
<p>were sworn together, and that, if I attempted to betray them, I would
</p>
<p>be hunted down through life ; and talked some more aliout the affair.
</p>
<p>I cannot remember it now ; but still urging me, saying I had better
</p>
<p>go in. I told him no, and bade him good-night ; and I went home.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he indicate to you what part he wished you to play in
</p>
<p>carrying out this conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he say ?
</p>
<p>A. That I was to open the back door of the theatre at a sig-
</p>
<p>nal.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he indicate at what theatre this was to occur ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : he told me Ford's Theatre ; because it must be some
</p>
<p>one acquainted or connected with the theatre who could take part
</p>
<p>in it.
</p>
<p>Q. Ford's Theatre in Washington ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he urge you upon the ground that it was an easy affaii",
</p>
<p>and that you would have very little to do ?
</p>
<p>A. Y'es : he said that. That was all I would have to do, he said.
</p>
<p>He said the thing was sure to succeed.

</p>
<p>Q. Wliat preparations did he say, if any, had been made toward
</p>
<p>the conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>A. He told me that every thing was in readiness ; that it was
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 47
</p>
<p>sure to succeed, for there wore parties oti the other side ready to co-
</p>
<p>operate with thoni.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you understand from biin that the Kebel Government was
</p>
<p>sanctioning what he was doing ?
</p>
<p>A. He never told me that.
</p>
<p>Q. What do you moan by parties on the other side ?
</p>
<p>A. I imagined that they were on the other side ; but he did not
</p>
<p>say who they were. I moan they were those people. He said on
</p>
<p>the other side.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he mention the probable number of persons engaged in
</p>
<p>the conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>A. He said there were from fifty to a hundred : he said that when
</p>
<p>he first mentioned the affair to me.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he write to you V
</p>
<p>A. He wrote about this speculation, and then he wrote to mo
</p>
<p>again : that must have been in January.
</p>
<p>y. Have you those letters ?
</p>
<p>A. I never kept my letters. Every Sunday I devote to answer-
</p>
<p>ing my correspondents, and generally de.-troy their letters then.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he or not make you any remittance with a view of enaUing
</p>
<p>you to come to Washington ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes, sir! After I had declined going,  had refused him,
</p>
<p> I got a letter from him stating that I must come. This was the
</p>
<p>letter in which he told mo it was sure to succeed. I wrote back
</p>
<p>that it was impossible ; I would not come. Then, by return mail,
</p>
<p>I think, I got anotlicr letter, with fifty dollars enclosed, sayinn; I
</p>
<p>must come, and must be sure to be there by Saturday night. 1 did
</p>
<p>not go. I had not been out of New York since last summer.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you remenber the time you received the last letter, with
</p>
<p>the fifty dollars in it ?
</p>
<p>A. That was in January, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. You say he said he had one thousand dollars to leave to your
</p>
<p>family ?
</p>
<p>A. That was before, at the first interview.

</p>
<p>4iJ TUF. TIUAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Did ho speak of having plenty of funds for the purpose 1
</p>
<p>A. Not in his letter.
</p>
<p>Q. Did ho in his conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. In his conversation after he came to New York again.
</p>
<p>Q. Wliat did he .say then ?
</p>
<p>A. When he came to New York he called on mo again, and
</p>
<p>asked me to take a walk with him ; and I did so. He told me that
</p>
<p>he had been trying to get another party to join him, named John
</p>
<p>Matthews; and when he told him wliat ho wanted to do, that the man
</p>
<p>was very much frightened, mdecd, and would not join him ; and he
</p>
<p>said he would not have cared if he had sacrificed Mm. I told him
</p>
<p>I did not think it was right to speak in that manner. He said no :
</p>
<p>he was a coward, and was not fit to live. Ho then asked mo again
</p>
<p>to join him : he told me I must do so. Ho said that there was
</p>
<p>plenty of money in the affair ; that, if I would do it, I would never
</p>
<p>want again as long as I lived ; that I would never want for money.
</p>
<p>He said that the President and some of the heads of the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment came to the theatre very frequently during Jlr. Forrest's
</p>
<p>eno-ao-eraents. I still urged him not to mention the aliair to me ; to
</p>
<p>thkik of my poor family. He said he would provide for my going
</p>
<p>with him. I stiU refused. He said he would ruin me in the pro-
</p>
<p>fession if I did not go. I told him I could not help that, and
</p>
<p>begged of him not to mention the affair to me. When he found I
</p>
<p>would not go, he said he honored my mother, and respected my
</p>
<p>wife, and he was sorry he had mentioned this affiiir to me, and told
</p>
<p>me to make my mind easy ; he would trouble me about it no more.
</p>
<p>I then returned him the money he sent me. He said he would not
</p>
<p>allow me to do so ; but that he was very short of funds,  so very
</p>
<p>short, that either himself or some of the party must go to Kichmoud
</p>
<p>to obtain means to carry out their designs.
</p>
<p>Q. Ho said, however, that there was plenty of money iu the
</p>
<p>enterprise ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>lation to Mr. Johnson appearing here as counsel for Mre. Surratt,
</p>
<p>or either of the prisoners, I have a note from one of the membci-s
</p>
<p>of the Court : 
</p>
<p>"Mr. President,  I feci it to be my duty to object to the
</p>
<p>admission of Mr. Rcverdy Johnson as a counsel before this Court,
</p>
<p>on the ground that he does not recognize the moral obligation of
</p>
<p>an oath that is designed as a test of loyalty, or to enforce the
</p>
<p>obligation of loyalty to the Government of the United States ; and,
</p>
<p>in support of this objection, have the honor to refer the members of
</p>
<p>the Court to his opinions on this subject, published in a letter over
</p>
<p>his signature, pending the adoption of the new constitution of
</p>
<p>Maryland, in 1864."
</p>
<p>]Mr. JonNSON. May I ask who the member of the Court is
</p>
<p>that makes that objection ?
</p>
<p>The President. Yes, sir : it is General Harris ; and, if he had
</p>
<p>not made it, I should have made it myself.
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson. I do not object to it at all. The Court will
</p>
<p>decide if I am to be tried.
</p>
<p>The President. The Court wiU be cleared.
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson. I hope I shall be heard.
</p>
<p>Gen. Ekin. I think it can be decided without clearing the
</p>
<p>Court.
</p>
<p>Gen. Wallace. I move that Mr. Johnson be heard.
</p>
<p>The President and others. Certainly.
</p>
<p>Me. Johnson. Is the opinion hero to which the objection
</p>
<p>refers ?
</p>
<p>The President. I believe it is not.

<p>Mr. Johnson. Mr. President and Gentlemen,  It is difficult
</p>
<p>to speak of this objection, and speak as I feel, without having the
</p>
<p>opinion before me. That opinion cannot bo tortured by any reason-

<p>THE TRIAL. 53
</p>
<p>able man into any such conclusion. It is an utter misapprehension
</p>
<p>of my meaning, and an utter misapprehension of the terms of that
</p>
<p>opinion. There is no member of this Court, including the President,
</p>
<p>and the member that objects, who recognizes tho obUgation of an
</p>
<p>oath more absolutely than I do ; and there is nothing in my life,
</p>
<p>from its commencement to the present time, which would induce me
</p>
<p>for a moment to avoid a comparison in all moral respects between
</p>
<p>myself and any member of this Court. In this Rebellion, which has
</p>
<p>broken down so many moral principles, it has been my pride to
</p>
<p>stand by the Government from the beginning to the present moment,
</p>
<p>to take every obligation which the Government has thought it neces-
</p>
<p>sary to impose, and to do my duty faithfully in every department
</p>
<p>of the public service, as well as in my individual capacity. If such
</p>
<p>an objection was made in the Senate of the United States, where I
</p>
<p>am known, I forbear to say how it would be treated, because I
</p>
<p>know the terms in whieli it would be decided. I have lived too
</p>
<p>long, gone through too many trials, rendered the country such ser-
</p>
<p>vices as my abilities enabled me, and the confidence of the people
</p>
<p>in whose midst I am has given mo the opportunity, to tolerate for a
</p>
<p>moment  come from whom it may  such an aspersion upon my
</p>
<p>moral character. I am glad it is made now, when I have arrived
</p>
<p>at that period of life when it would be unfit to notice it in any other
</p>
<p>way.
</p>
<p>But I repeat, there is not one word of truth in the construction
</p>
<p>which has been given to that opinion. I have it not by me ; but I
</p>
<p>recollect substantially what it is. The convention called to frame a
</p>
<p>new constitution for the State was called under tho authority of an
</p>
<p>act of tho Legislature of Maryland, and under that alone. By that
</p>
<p>legislation, their proceedings were to be submitted to the then legal
</p>
<p>voters of the State. The convention thouglit that they were author-
</p>
<p>ized themselves, not only to impose, as an authority to vote, what
</p>
<p>was not imposed by the then existing constitution and laws, but to
</p>
<p>admit to vote those who were prohibited from voting by such con-
</p>
<p>stitution and laws ; and I said, in common with the whole bar of

<p>the State (and with what the bar throughout the Union would have
</p>
<p>said if thoy had been consulted), that, to that extent, they had
</p>
<p>usui'ped the authority under which alone they were authorized to
</p>
<p>54 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>meet ; and that, so far, the proceeding was a nullity. They had
</p>
<p>prescribed this oath ; and all that the opinion said, or was intended
</p>
<p>to say, was, that to take the oath voluntarily was not a craven sub-
</p>
<p>mission to usurped authority, Ijut was noccssaiy, in order to enable
</p>
<p>the citizen to protect his right* under the then constitution; and that
</p>
<p>there was no moral harm in taking an oath which the convention
</p>
<p>had no authority to impose. I mean it as no reflection to any
</p>
<p>member of this Court when I say, that, upon a question of that
</p>
<p>description, I feel myself at least as able to form a correct opiuiou
</p>
<p>as any one of the gentlemen around this table.
</p>
<p>I am here at the instance of that lady [pointing to 5Irs. Surratt],
</p>
<p>whom I never saw until yesterday, and. never hoard of, .she being a
</p>
<p>Blaryland lady ; and thinking that I could bo of service to her, and
</p>
<p>protesting, as she has done, her innocence to me,  of the facts I
</p>
<p>know nothing,  because I deemed it right, I deemed it due to the
</p>
<p>character of the profession to which I belong, and whicli is not in-
</p>
<p>ferior to the noble profession of which you arc members, that she
</p>
<p>should not go undefended. I knew I was to do it voluntarily,
</p>
<p>without compensation : the law prohibits mo from receiving eompon- .
</p>
<p>sation; but if it did not, understanding her condition, I should never
</p>
<p>have dreamed of refusing upon the gi'ound of her inabihty to make
</p>
<p>compensation.
</p>
<p>I am here no volunteer, gentlemen. I am here to do whatever
</p>
<p>the evidence will justify mo in doing in protecting this lady from
</p>
<p>the charge upon which she is now being tried for her life. I am
</p>
<p>here detesting from the veiy bottom of my heart evei-y one con-
</p>
<p>cerned in this nefarious plot, carried out with such fiendish malice,
</p>
<p>as much as any member of this Court ; and I am not here to pro-
</p>
<p>tect any one whom, when the evidence is offered, I shall deem to have
</p>
<p>been guilty, even her.
</p>
<p>The Court, therefore, or the honorable member of the Court
</p>
<p>who thinks proper, or thinks it his duty, to make this objection,
</p>
<p>and the President who said that ho should have thought it his duty
</p>
<p>to make the objection if no member of the Court had done it, arc

<p>to understand that I am not pleading hero for any thing personal

<p>the Court to decide ; and I have no right to suppose they will not

<p>decide as they shall see to be best. It" it shall bo such a decision as
</p>
<p>the President seems himself to bo disposed to make, I can take
</p>
<p>care of myself in the future.
</p>
<p>Gex. Harris. Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Commis-
</p>
<p>sion,  I tnist it is not necessary that I should assure you, or the
</p>
<p>gentleman to whom I felt it my duty to object as a counsellor be-
</p>
<p>fore this Court, that I desire above all things not to do injustice to
</p>
<p>any man. Neither, I hope, need I assure you, that, in doing what I
</p>
<p>felt it to be my duty to do, I have not been influenced by any personal
</p>
<p>considerations. Although I have never had the pleasure of the
</p>
<p>personal acquaintance of the gentleman to whom T objected, I have
</p>
<p>known him long as an eminent public man of our country ; and I
</p>
<p>must say that my impressions of him have been of a very ftivorable
</p>
<p>character. But in regard to the matter of the objection, if my
</p>
<p>recollection seiTCS me ariglit, I must contend that it is well found-
</p>
<p>ed. It is due to the gentleman and to the members of the Court,
</p>
<p>however, that I should say that I have made this objection simply
</p>
<p>from a recollection of the letter alluded to, which I read, perhaps,
</p>
<p>near a. year ago, and of the effects of that letter upon the vote of his
</p>
<p>State.
</p>
<p>Now, if I understand the remarks of the gentleman in explana-
</p>
<p>tion, I cannot see that they remove the ditHculty : they do not from
</p>
<p>my mind at least. I understand him to say that the doctrine which
</p>
<p>he taught to the people of his State was, that because the conven-
</p>
<p>tion had framed an oath, and requu-ed the taking of that oath as a
</p>
<p>quaUfication for the right of suffrage, which oath was unconstitu-
</p>
<p>tional and illegal in his opinion, therefore it had no moral binduig
</p>
<p>force, and that people might take it, and then go and vote without
</p>
<p>any regard to the subjcctrmatter of that oath.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jounson. If you suppose I have said so, general, you are
</p>
<p>under a misapprehension. I have not said any such thing.
</p>
<p>Gen. Harris. That is my understanding of the gentleman's

</p>
<p>Mk. I). F. MuKi'UY, ono of the otlioial reporters of tlie Commis-
</p>
<p>sion, then read from his short^hand notes that portion of Mr. John-
</p>
<p>son's remarks relative to tlio action of the Slarylaud Convention,
</p>
<p>and the opinion given by him as to the oath prescribed by it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Joilnson (to tho reporter). That is right.
</p>
<p>Gen. HAUnis. Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Cotirl, 
</p>
<p>If that language does not justify my conclusion, I confess I am unable
</p>
<p>to understand the Engli.sh language. I wish the gentleman to un-
</p>
<p>derstand, that, in regard to his ability to determine a legal ((uostiou,
</p>
<p>I do not intend to enter into any controversy. He remarked to
</p>
<p>tho Court, rather boastingly, that he, perhaps, was as able as any
</p>
<p>other man, or considered himself so, to judge in regard to a legal
</p>
<p>point. That is not the matter in question. It is a question of
</p>
<p>ethics ; it is tho morality of the thing ; tho moral oliligation of
</p>
<p>an oath voluntarily taken, which, if I understand that language,
</p>
<p>he taught bis people might be set aside, and considered as having
</p>
<p>no force or binding obligation on them. Ho taught them that the
</p>
<p>convention had transcended its authority, had done something that
</p>
<p>it had no right to do, was requiring as a qualilication for the exer-
</p>
<p>cise of the right of suffrage something that it had no right to re(|uire,
</p>
<p>and that, consequently, they might voluntiuily take this oath in order
</p>
<p>simply to entitle them to vote, without considering it as having any
</p>
<p>moral binding force m it ; and I am much mistaken in my recollection
</p>
<p>of the history of tho times and the effect of that opinion on the vote
</p>
<p>of his State if it was not so considered, and if a largo number of
</p>
<p>the people of his State did not cast their suffrage under that eth-
</p>
<p>ical doctrine taught to them by the gentleman to whom I have ob-
</p>
<p>jected. But, as I was about to remark a while ago, I .should bo
</p>
<p>very sorry indeed to do injustice to the gentleman or to any other
</p>
<p>man ; and, having made my objection simply from my recollection
</p>
<p>of this letter, it is perhaps duo to the gentleman and to tho mem-
</p>
<p>bers of tho Court that the letter should lie submitteil to the scru-

</p>
<p>tiny of the Court before making their decision. I may be wrong :
</p>
<p>if so, none will be more ready than myself to acknowledge that
</p>
<p>fact.
</p>
<p>THE T R I A h. 57
</p>
<p>Mr. JoiiNf30f. Mr. Presidmit,  I do not propose to make an
</p>
<p>esteudeil reply to the honorable member's construction of my re-
</p>
<p>marks, but only to say a word or two. As to my "boastini,'," in
</p>
<p>a boasting manner asserting my competence to decide a (Question of
</p>
<p>law as well as any man, the honorable member is mistaken. I said
</p>
<p>that I thought I was as capable of deciding questions of that sort
</p>
<p>as any member of this Coui-t ; they not being lawyers, as I pre-
</p>
<p>sume.
</p>
<p>Now, the honorable member seems to suppose, that because in
</p>
<p>that opinion to which reference is made, according to my recollec-
</p>
<p>tion of it, I said there was no harm in taking an oath, that meant
</p>
<p>to toll the people of Maryland that there would be no harm in
</p>
<p>breaking it after it was taken. We learn something every day ;
</p>
<p>and, if that is the coiToet interpretation of the words, I am better
</p>
<p>informed now than I was when I used them. I said to the Court,
</p>
<p>and I repeat it, that I had no idea of using them for any such pur-
</p>
<p>pose; that, according to my interpretation of them, they admit of no
</p>
<p>such constrviction ; and that ought to be sufacient. When gentle-
</p>
<p>men are dealing with gentlemen, even if the words were liable, by
</p>
<p>any thing but what I must be permitted to call hypercriticism, to
</p>
<p>such interpretations as the honorable memljor has thought proper
</p>
<p>to give, I submit, that, amongst gentlemen (and I hope I may not
</p>
<p>be considered as boasting when I say that in that capacity I am
</p>
<p>the equal of every member of this Court), when I say that the
</p>
<p>words were not used for any such design, a gentleman to whom
</p>
<p>the explanation is given would not be disposed to hold that they
</p>
<p>were, in point of fact, used with that design.
</p>
<p>Now, as to the eftcct upon the people of Maryland. I do not
</p>
<p>know where the honorable member is from. He is not a citizen of
</p>
<p>our State, I suppose.
</p>
<p>Gex. IIarris. I am a citizen of West Virginia, sir.
</p>
<p>Mb. Jounson. Very well : that is not a citizen of Mai-yland.
</p>
<p>Gen. Harris. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson. I was about to say that, whoever supposes

</p>
<p>and I hope that he will sooner or later, if ho is under that imi)res-
</p>
<p>sion, come to a different conclusion hereafter  that the people of
</p>
<p>Maryland can be induced by an individual opinion to take an oath
</p>
<p>58 TTI E TTl I A L.
</p>
<p>with a view to violate it, is under a great misapproliension,  a very
</p>
<p>great misapprehension. We had in this controversy, much to my '
</p>
<p>regret, hundreds and hundreds of our citizens who left our borders
</p>
<p>and partisiputcd in this Ivubellion ; but huntlreds and hundreds of
</p>
<p>those who remain have proved true to their flag, and evidenced
</p>
<p>their loyalty upon the battle-field with their blood and their lives ;
</p>
<p>and in the relation in which I stand to the people of JIaryland,
</p>
<p>who are supposed to be capable of being influenced to do an im-
</p>
<p>moral act by tho opinion of any one man, I may be permitted to
</p>
<p>say, that they are tho equals patriotically of the people of West-
</p>
<p>em Virginia.
</p>
<p>There were other topics involved in the constitution which in-
</p>
<p>fluenced the vote of those who voted against it, to which it is
</p>
<p>unnecessary and useless here to refer ; but I deny, and deny expli-
</p>
<p>citly, that there was a single man who voted because of that
</p>
<p>opinion, taking the oath with a view to vote, intending thereafter
</p>
<p>to violate that obligation.
</p>
<p>15ut, as a legal question, it is something new to me that the
</p>
<p>objection, if it was well founded in fact, is well founded in law. Are
</p>
<p>the members of the Court to measure the moral character of every
</p>
<p>counsel who may appeal- before them? Is that their function?
</p>
<p>AVhat if it is bad ? What if it is known to be bad ? I mention it
</p>
<p>only by way of supposition ; for I scorn it as applymg to myself.
</p>
<p>What if it is bad ? What influence has that upon the Court, by
</p>
<p>which then- judgments could be led astray ? His client may sufter
</p>
<p>from the possible prejudice wliich the fact may create in the
</p>
<p>minds of tho Court ; but how can the Court sufter ? Who gives
</p>
<p>to the Court the jurisdiction to decide upon the moral character of
</p>
<p>the counsel who may appear before them? Who makes them the
</p>
<p>arbiters of the public moraUty and professional morality ? What
</p>
<p>authority have they, under theii- commission, to rule me out, or to
</p>
<p>rule any other counsel out, upon the ground, above all, that he
</p>
<p>does not recognize tlie validity of an oath, even if they believed it?
</p>
<p>But I put myself upon uo such ground as that, Mr. President

<p>and gentlemen. I claim again, and in no boasting spu-it, but as

<p>patriotic servu-o,  I claim, in all moral respects, to bo the equal

<p>THE TRIAL. 59
</p>
<p>of cvei7 member of this tribunal. They may dispose of the ques-
</p>
<p>tion as they please : it will not touch me.
</p>
<p>Gen. H.uiKis. Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Court,  I
</p>
<p>will be<^ your iiuUilgeuce but for a moment. I am sure the Court
</p>
<p>did not understand me as intending to cast any reflection upon the
</p>
<p>people of Jlarylaud, either in regard to loyalty or morality, nor in
</p>
<p>regard to patriotism ; for I k)iow, and am proud to say, that the
</p>
<p>State of Maryland has a good record in this great contest through
</p>
<p>which our country has just passed. But whilst that Ls true, as it
</p>
<p>is true of my State (and I am proud to make the assertion), it is
</p>
<p>equally true of Maryland as it is of my own State (and I am sorry
</p>
<p>to say it is true), that a portion of the people stand in a very
</p>
<p>different attitude, and have made for themselves a tenible rec-
</p>
<p>ord.
</p>
<p>And the circumstances of this case were rather peculiar. They
</p>
<p>were about to vote on an alteration in the fundamental law of the
</p>
<p>State, on the adoption of a new constitution which made some radical
</p>
<p>changes in regard to the social status or condition of the people of
</p>
<p>Maryland : the institution of slavery was about to be blotted out
</p>
<p>fi-ora the fundamental law of the land. That was the proposition ;
</p>
<p>and it was an unfortunate foot, that that portion of the citizens of
</p>
<p>Maryland who were immediately interested in that proposed change
</p>
<p>were, as a general thing, the disloyal portion ; and it was in refer-
</p>
<p> encc to the effect which the opinion expressed by the honorable
</p>
<p>gentleman in the letter referred to had upon that vote, upon the
</p>
<p>action of that portion of the people, that my objection was in part
</p>
<p>founded : for it did seem that they understood it, as I understood
</p>
<p>it, as ignoring the moral obligation of that oath.
</p>
<p>Now, one word in regard to the question of the right of this
</p>
<p>Court to inquire into the moral character of counsel. As an
</p>
<p>abstract question, we do not propose to do any such thing : we have
</p>
<p>no such right. I do not know whether the honorable gentleman
</p>
<p>is aware of the fact, that the order constituting this commission gives
</p>
<p>it power to make rules aud regulations for its proceedings ; and one

</p>
<p>of the mles thus made allows the accused to have counsel; and one
</p>
<p>of the provisions in regard to that matter is, that gentlemen appear-
</p>
<p>ing as counsel shall submit to the Court a certilicate of having taken
</p>
<p>00 TUF. TniAL.
</p>
<p>the oath of loyalty, or, in default of that, must take the oath in the
</p>
<p>presence of the Coui't.
</p>
<p>ThL<, tiiuii, is a qualification which puts it entirely in the power
</p>
<p>of the Court, and makes it competent to decide tlu.s ([uestion,
</p>
<p>because that oath brings up the very question of loyalty and the
</p>
<p>obligation of an oath ; and hero is a special question in reference to
</p>
<p>the opinions of a man, a gentleman of the bar, who may bo pro-
</p>
<p>posed as counsel. If it appears that he ignores the moral obligation
</p>
<p>of an oath of that character, we defeat the very provision of the
</p>
<p>order by admitting such a man as counsel. It defeats the very end
</p>
<p>in view. I contend, therefore, that it is competent to the Court,
</p>
<p>and proper for me ae a member of the Court, to make an objection
</p>
<p>of that character. Then the only question is, whether, in point of
</p>
<p>fact, the objection is well founded.
</p>
<p>The gentleman disclaims any intention to inculcate such a doc-
</p>
<p>trine as that to which I have taken exception ; and I am glad to
</p>
<p>give him the benefit of that disclaimer. It is a tacit admission that
</p>
<p>the language of that letter may have been unguarded ; that it may
</p>
<p>have had an cftect that it was not intended to have, and that eflcct
</p>
<p>was an injurious one ; and, if so, it was not in accordance with the
</p>
<p>intention of his mind in writing the letter. That, of course, is an
</p>
<p>explanation that ought to be .satisfactory in regard to the moral
</p>
<p>question ; but it was a very unfortunate thing if the gentleman
</p>
<p>wrote a letter of such a character that it was so terribly miscon-
</p>
<p>strued by the people of his State. If that was not the intention of
</p>
<p>the writer, then, as a question of ethics, we must exonerate him.
</p>
<p>We are bound to take his present explanation. He disavows
</p>
<p>having had any such intention, and claims for himself a moral
</p>
<p>character which he is not ashamed to put up in comparison with that
</p>
<p>of any member of the Court. It was not my purpose to measure
</p>
<p>characters at all ; but it was simply my purpose to bring forward,
</p>
<p>whi(^h I did conscientiously,  I felt it to be my duty,  I could not
</p>
<p>do any thing else,  an objection founded on the understanding that
</p>
<p>I had of the letter referred to. I was sorry to have to do it. I

<p>did it in no spirit of pereonal ill-will or bad feeling. I was sorry
</p>
<p>that I felt it to bo my duty to do such a thing ; but I could not

<p>do any thing else with the impressions I had on my mind,
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>01
</p>
<p>The gentleman, as an honorable gentleman, will understand what
</p>
<p>I mean )iy this. IIo inulerstauas, according to his own estimation
</p>
<p>of his o\TO character, what tlio force of conscientious convictions
</p>
<p>must be ; and that if a man acts from principle in every act of his
</p>
<p>Ufe, if ho intends to be governed by moral principle, it will occa-
</p>
<p>sionally impose upon him some unpleasant duties, as it has upon
</p>
<p>me in the present case. The disavowd by the gentleman of any
</p>
<p>such intention I am bound to take. I know nothing of the history
</p>
<p>of the gentleman that would for a moment incline me not to take
</p>
<p>his exptanation and his disavowal. It is satisfactory to me ; but it
</p>
<p>is, I must insist, a tacit admission that there was some ground for
</p>
<p>the view upon which my objection was founded.
</p>
<p>Mr. Joilnson. Mr. President, a word more. The admission I
</p>
<p>made was certainly not intended to imply at all that the honorable
</p>
<p>member hhnself, except upon grounds that he supposed to be suffi-
</p>
<p>cient, had made the objection. He has not seen the opinion, as he
</p>
<p>gays,'for a good while, or perhaps never saw it ; but, if he under-
</p>
<p>stood me as admitting that the people of ^Maryland so construed it,
</p>
<p>he has misunderstood me. I have no idea that they did so construe
</p>
<p>it ; but, as he is satisfied with my statement that it was not my
</p>
<p>pui-pose to inculcate any such doctrine, that ends it.
</p>
<p>All that I propose to say, if he will not conclude it in that way,
</p>
<p>is, that the order under which you are assembled gives you, in my
</p>
<p>cJse, no authority to refuse me admission, because you have no
</p>
<p>authority to administer the oath to me. I have taken the oath in
</p>
<p>the Senate of the United States,  the very oath that you aro
</p>
<p>administering ; I have taken it in the Circuit Court of the United
</p>
<p>States ; I have taken it in the Supreme Court of the United States ;
</p>
<p>and I 'am a practitioner in all the courts of the United States in
</p>
<p>nearly all the States ; and it would be a little singular if one who
</p>
<p>has a right to appear before the supreme judicial tribunal of the
</p>
<p>land, and who has a right to appear before one of the legislative
</p>
<p>departments of the Government, whoso law creates armies, and

</p>
<p>The President. iMr. Johnson has made an intimation in regard
</p>
<p>VOL. I. "
</p>
<p>62 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>to holding members of this Court personally responsible for their
</p>
<p>action .
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson. I made no such intimation : did not intend it.
</p>
<p>The Pkksident. Then I shall say nothing more, sir.
</p>
<p>]Mk. Johnson. I had no idea of it. I said I was too old to feel
</p>
<p>such things, if I ever would.
</p>
<p>The President. I was going to say that I hoped the day had
</p>
<p>passed when free men from the North were to be Imllicd and
</p>
<p>insulted by the humbug chivalry ; and that, for my own part, I
</p>
<p>hold myself personally responsible for every thing I do here. The
</p>
<p>Court will be cleared.
</p>
<p>The Commission was thereupon cleared for deliberation ; and, on
</p>
<p>re-opening, the Judge Advocate read the following paper : 
</p>
<p>"Mr. President,  I desire to withdraw my objection to the
</p>
<p>admission of Mr. Reverdy Johnson as counsel before this Court,
</p>
<p>on the ground that his disclaimer of any intention to inculcate the
</p>
<p>doctrine that the moral obligation of an oath might, under certain
</p>
<p>circumstances, be disregarded, or under any circumstances, is, to my
</p>
<p>mind, a satisfactory removal of the grounds of the objection.
</p>
<p>" T. M. Harris, Brigadier-General."
</p>
<p>]Mr. Jounson. I have not brought with me my certificate of
</p>
<p>having taken this oath ; but I will take the oath prescribed.
</p>
<p>Gen. Wallace. I suppose it is within the knowledge of every
</p>
<p>member of the Commission that Sir. Senator Johnson has taken
</p>
<p>this oath in the Senate of the United States. I therefore suggest
</p>
<p>that the requirement of his taking the oath here be dispensed with.
</p>
<p>The suggestion was' acquiesced in nem. con.
</p>
<p>JIr. Johnson. I appear, then, as counsel for Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate then proceeded to continue the calling of
</p>
<p>witnesses on the part of the Government.
</p>
<p>John Lee,
</p>

<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 63
</p>
<p>Q. Do you belong to the military police force of this city?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether at any time you examined in the
</p>
<p>Kirkwood House the room of the prisoner, Atzcrodt ?
</p>
<p>A. I was ordered there by jMajor O'Beirae, with the rest of
</p>
<p>'his force. I was chief of his force. Ho told nic to go to the top
</p>
<p>part of the building, and see how the house was situated, whether
</p>
<p>any person could get in there or not. I wont and made the exam-
</p>
<p>ination, and told him the house could very easily be got into from
</p>
<p>the roof and from a stairway that went up fi-om the back-yard to
</p>
<p>the top of the building, which would leave you to go anywhere
</p>
<p>you wanted in the buikbng. I told the major of these eircumstan-
</p>
<p>,ces : he was in quite a hurry at that time ; in fact, everybody was
</p>
<p>in a gi-eat deal of hurry.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that?
</p>
<p>A. On the night of the 15th of April. I then went out into
</p>
<p>the bar-room ; andr while I was there, a friend came up to me, I say
</p>
<p>a friend, because it was a man whom I see about the streets every
</p>
<p>day. He said there was rather a suspicious-looking man there who
</p>
<p>had taken a room the day previous, and that I had better go and
</p>
<p>look at the book. I went, and found the name, as near as I could
</p>
<p>make it out,- it was written very badly, G. A. Atzerodt. It
</p>
<p>was written very badly : in fact, nobody could make it out until I
</p>
<p>went to the book. The proprietor of the house could not make
</p>
<p>it out.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you go to the room which it was indicated on the regis-
</p>
<p>ter he had taken ?
</p>
<p>A. I then went up stairs to the room. I saw one of the clerks
</p>
<p>or men attached to the house, and asked him to go up to the room
</p>
<p>with me, saying that I should hke to go and see it. I went up
</p>
<p>stairs to the room. The door was locked. The man said that ho
</p>
<p>thought the party who had taken the room had earned the key
</p>
<p>away with him. I did not altogether like the appeai-ance of things ;
</p>
<p>so I went down to one of the proprietors, and asked him if he had

</p>
<p>any objections to going up to the room, and if ho could get a key
</p>
<p>to fit the door. He said he had not one that would. I went up
</p>
<p>Btairs again to the room, tried aU the keys, and could not got one
</p>
<p>64 THE T II I A L.
</p>
<p>to fit. I then asked liiin if I haJ liis permission to buret the door.
</p>
<p>He said ho liad w) olijcction ; and I burst open tlie duoi', aud wuut
</p>
<p>into the room. There was a coat hanging on the wall.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a blaclc coat uiarlced No. 9.] Is this it?
</p>
<p>A. This black coat was hanging up on the wall, on the left-hand
</p>
<p>side as you go in tlic door. This is tlic coat.
</p>
<p>[The coat was oti'orcd in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>The witness proceeded : The coat was hanging on the wall, and
</p>
<p>ri^ht opposite was the bedstead. I went towards the I)cd, and, un-
</p>
<p>derneath tlio pillow or bolster, found a pistol all loaded and capped.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness a pistol, loaded and capped, mai-ked
</p>
<p>No. 2.] Is that it?
</p>
<p>A. It is.
</p>
<p>[The pistol was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. Did you find any thing else in the room ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I then went down stairs and tried to find Major
</p>
<p>O'Beirno, my superior, the Provost Marshal of the Board of En-
</p>
<p>rolment : I saw him, and came up stairs ag;iin with him ; but it was
</p>
<p>dai-k, and we came down again, and he went olF, leaving me to in-
</p>
<p>vestigate the matter. I then went to the proprietor, who gave mo
</p>
<p>the number of the room, and we went up together. I then took
</p>
<p>the coat down. I found in the pocket of the coat two books, which
</p>
<p>are numbered No. 4 and No. 6. The numbers on these .oi-tides
</p>
<p>were affixed by me. One book shows an account with the Outiirio
</p>
<p>Bank for $455.
</p>
<p>[The book was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>[The other book, containing a map, was also received in evi-
</p>
<p>dence.]
</p>
<p>I then put ray hand in the pocket again, and took out a white
</p>
<p>handkerchief with " Mary R. E. Booth " on it. It is tiumbered 7.
</p>
<p>[The hankerchief was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>I then pulled out the white handkerchief nuu-kcd No. 0, and had
</p>
<p>a go^d deal of difficulty \n. tiying to make out the name on it ; but
</p>
<p>I think it is F. M. or E. A. Nelson.

<p>There was hi the bank-book- an envelope, with the frank of the
</p>
<p>Hon. John Conness. There -was a paii- of new gauntlets, marked
</p>
<p>No. 20.
</p>
<p>[The gauntlets were offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>There was also a colored handkerchief, numbered 10.
</p>
<p>[The handkerchief was offered in Qj,-idcncc without objec-
</p>
<p>tion.]
</p>
<p>There was also three boxes of Colt's cartridges, numbered 11,
</p>
<p>12, and 13.
</p>
<p>[The boxes of cartridges were offered in evidence without objec-
</p>
<p>tion.]
</p>
<p>I found also a piece of licorice and a tooth-brush.
</p>
<p>[These articles were offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. Is the wilting on the cover of the bank-book just as you
</p>
<p>found it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir: "J. W. Booth, 53;" and on the inside of the
</p>
<p>book was written : 
</p>
<p>" Mr. J. Wilkes Booth, in account with the Ontario Bank,
</p>
<p>Canada.
</p>
<p>Dr. 18G-1. Cr.
</p>
<p>Oct. 27. By Dep. $455."
</p>
<p>I then got also this spur, No. 5.
</p>
<p>[The spur was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Also a pair of socks, No. 14 ; two collars, Nos. 16 and 17.
</p>
<p>[These articles were offered in e\'idence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember the number of the room V
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : No. 120, the next floor above where Vice-Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Johnson was at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he right over Vice-President Johnson's room ?
</p>
<p>A. On the next floor above, going up, and through an entry,
</p>
<p>and then a little off on one side. I then went round the room,
</p>
<p>took up the carpet, examined iwidcr the carpet, wash-stand, and bu-
</p>
<p>reau, and in the stove : I got out all the cinders and a.shos ; and I

<p>made a thorough search of eveiy thing in the room. I then went
</p>
<p>to the bed, took up the covering piece by piece, and felt all through

</p>
<p>Q. You did not yourself sec the occupant of the room ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. He had come there the day before, you understood ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the cle^k employed in the house says he would
</p>
<p>recognize the man who was there if he saw him.
</p>
<p>Q. What is his name ? .
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. What is your bu.sincss ?
</p>
<p>A. I am chief of the detective force of the Board of Enrol-
</p>
<p>ment of the District of Columbia. Major O'Beiruc is the Provost
</p>
<p>Marshal of the Board.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you followed the business ?
</p>
<p>A. I have been in the secfet service ever since I left New
</p>
<p>York, at the commencement of the war, in the Ninety-fifth New-
</p>
<p>York Volunteers.
</p>
<p>Q. IIow long have you been a detective here in Washington ?
</p>
<p>A. Ever since the burning of Aquia-Creek Village. I left
</p>
<p>Aquia Creek and came here, and was then detailed from my regi-
</p>
<p>ment to Colonel Baker's force, and staid with hmi until the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of War gave me a dischai-ge ; and I then went from that to the
</p>
<p>Provost Marshal's office of the District of Columbia, and have
</p>
<p>been there to the present time.
</p>
<p>Q. You have been discharged as detective already by the Sec-
</p>
<p>retary of War, you say ?
</p>
<p>A. Not as detective, but as a volunteer in the Ninety-fifth New-
</p>
<p>York Volunteers.
</p>
<p>Q. You mentioned a conversation with some one m reference to
</p>
<p>a suspicious person at the Kirkwood House '?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know who the person was ?

</p>
<p>A. He was employed in that house ; but I cannot tell you his
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you see him in the house ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 67
</p>
<p>A. On the first floor of the house, in the front ef the building.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he a clerk ?
</p>
<p>A. I tlo not know whether he was a night watchman or clerk ;
</p>
<p>either one or the other, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. What was his precise language to you ?
</p>
<p>A. He said to me that there was avery suspicious, bad-looking,
</p>
<p>villanous-looking fellow came into the place there, and took a room
</p>
<p>in the house, and he did not like the appearance of him ; that I
</p>
<p>had better look after him. I think that was it.
</p>
<p>Q. When did he say the person had come into the house and
</p>
<p>taken a room ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was the day before.
</p>
<p>Q. You are not positive : you cannot say for certain ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I cannot say for certain. I could not be positive
</p>
<p>about it ; but I think, to the best of my knowledge, it was the day
</p>
<p>before. 
</p>
<p>Q. Did he describa to you the appearance of this suspicious-look-
</p>
<p>ing person "?
</p>
<p>A. He did.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you repeat the description ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I could describe it as he described it to me.
</p>
<p>I do not recollect. I think, though, that he said he had a gray
</p>
<p>coat on.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever, to your knowledge, seen this Atzerodt?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I ever have. I have seen almost every-
</p>
<p>body that has been about Washington knocking around.
</p>
<p>Q. But you have never seen him?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I ever saw him to know him by name.
</p>
<p>I do not say tiiat I have not or that I have. I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. What first brought you to the Kirkwood House to speak with
</p>
<p>this clerk?
</p>
<p>A. I was home, eating my supper ; and one of my men, Jlr. Cun-
</p>
<p>ningham, came over to me. I came out of my house just after eating
</p>
<p>my supper, ami met him half-way on the; block. He said, " You are

</p>
<p>wanted immediately down at the Kirkwood House." I went down
</p>
<p>to the Kirkwood House, and there met Major O'Bcirne ; and I found
</p>
<p>that the men were detailed there  they were just making the
</p>
<p>68 THE TniAL.
</p>
<p>arrangements  to protect tbe person of the Vice-President at the
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>Q. Now describe the appearance of the man who gave you the
</p>
<p>inforiuatiun that there was a suspicious person tliere.
</p>
<p>A. A man about your build, as near as I know of.
</p>
<p>Q. Does he looli like I do ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : he may be a little heavier than you. I think he is near
</p>
<p>about your height.
</p>
<p>Q. How old does he look about to be ?
</p>
<p>A. Somewheres in the neighborhood of your age.
</p>
<p>Q. What is my age?
</p>
<p>A. I should take you to be about thirty.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know his name?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Describe accurately the relative position of Mr. Johnson's
</p>
<p>room, if you know, ami the room where you say you found this
</p>
<p>coat.
</p>
<p>A. In the Kirkwood House, you go right up the main entrance
</p>
<p>into the office, and the stairway goes right up. As you turu the
</p>
<p>stau-way, you go right up straight half-way till you get to the second
</p>
<p>story, and you file left, and then go on up the stairs and to the right
</p>
<p>hand : after you get up, you foce the parlors. IMr. Johnson's room
</p>
<p>was right opposite the parlors ; but you cannot go into them by being
</p>
<p>directly opposite them there. You go up a little farther to reach
</p>
<p>the parlor doors on the same passage ; then there is a little recess
</p>
<p>that runs into a window that looks out on Twelfth Street.
</p>
<p>Q. How many doors is it from Mr. Johnson's door to the door
</p>
<p>of the room where you found these things ?
</p>
<p>* A. I do not know. It is on the floor above. You face Mr.
</p>
<p>Johnson's room door as you go in, and come to a stairs leading to
</p>

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 71

<p>in, and all three went out together, and had a private conversation in

</p>
<p>and made marks on it with a pencil. I should not consider it writr
</p>
<p>ing, but more in the dii-ection of roads or lines. Surratt and Booth
</p>
<p>anil Dr. Bludd were at that time seated round the tabic,  a centre-
</p>
<p>table,  in the centre of the room.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the marks ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I just saw the motion of the pencil. Booth also
</p>
<p>came to me, and stated that he wished to purchase Dr. Mudd's ftu-m.
</p>
<p>Dr. IMudd had previously stated to me that he did not care about
</p>
<p>soiling his farm to Booth, because Booth was not going to give him
</p>
<p>enough.
</p>
<p>Q,. But you did not hear a word spoken yourself in regard to the
</p>
<p>farm in their conference 1
</p>

</p>
<p>conversation ?

</p>
<p>Booth in the parlor ; but Booth has taken Surratt out of the room
</p>
<p>and taken him up-stairs, and engaged in private conversation in rooms
</p>
<p>up-stairs. Booth would sometimes, when there, engage in a gen-
</p>
<p>eral sort of conversation, and would then say, " John, can you go
</p>
<p>up-stairs, and spare me a word? " They would go up-stairs, and en-
</p>
<p>gage in private conversation, which would sometimes last two or three

<p>Pennsylvania Avenue about the time that Booth played the part of
</p>
<p>Peseara, in "The Apostate." Booth had given Surratt two com-
</p>
<p>phmentaiy tickets on that occasion ; and we went down, and met

</p>
<p>as far as the corner of Tenth and E Streets ; and, on turnin"'
</p>
<p>round, Sui-ratt noticed that Atzerodt and Ilerold did not follow
</p>
<p>him, and told me to go back. I went back, and found Atzerodt
</p>
<p>and Ilerold in a restaurant adjoining the theatre, talking very confi-
</p>
<p>dentially with Booth ; and, on my approaching them, they sepa-
</p>
<p>rated, and Booth said, " Mr. Weichmann, will you not come and
</p>
<p>take a drink?" And we approached the counter, and took a
</p>
<p>drink ; and Booth introduced me to a gentleman there whoso name
</p>
<p>I do not remember, but whose face I have seen very frequently
</p>
<p>around town here. We left the restaurant, and joined the other two
</p>
<p>gentlemen on E Street, and then went to Kloman's and had some
</p>
<p>oysters. We there separated ; Jlr. John 11. Surratt and myself

<p>not. Then we both left, and went as far as the post-office. I had

<p>dollars instead, and I should hire a buggy. He spoke about the
</p>
<p>horses that he had kept at Brooks's stable ; and I remarked to him,

<p>false mustache on the table in my room. I took the mustache,

<p>and threw it into a little toilet-box I had on the table. This man
</p>
<p>Payne searched around the table, and inquired for his mustache. I
</p>
<p>was sitting on the chair, and did not say any thing. I have re-

<p>her son. Her son was a schoolmate of mine. He had boon at col-
</p>
<p>lege with me for three years ; and, when I went there, it was to ex-
</p>
<p>change the usual civilities, and I always oxpericneed the utmost
</p>
<p>kindness and courtesy.

</p>
<p>times he would be three or four weeks at a time in the country.

<p>A. Yes, sir : he would bo seated at the same table.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he frequently in your room, and you in his?
</p>
<p>A. He partook of the same room, shared my bed with me, slept
</p>
<p>with me.
</p>
<p>Q. And during the whole of that period you never heard him
</p>
<p>intimate that it was his purpose, or that there was a purpose, to as-
</p>
<p>sassinate the President ?
</p>
<p>A. Never, sir.

</p>
<p>body else, during the whole period from November until the assassi-

</p>
<p>tears ; and the president approached him, and told him not to weep ;
</p>
<p>that his conduct had been so excellent during the three years he had
</p>
<p>been there, that he would always be remembered by those who had

</p>
<p>occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. We arrived at the village about half-past twelve o'clock ; but
</p>
<p>Mr. Nothe was not there. She told Sir. Nott, the bar-keeper, to
</p>
<p>send a messenger for him ; and he immediately sent a mounted mes-
</p>
<p>senger to Mr. Nothe. In the mean time, BIrs. Surratt, and myself
</p>
<p>went to Captain Gwynn's place, about three miles lower down, and
</p>
<p>remained there about two hours, taking dinner. Mrs. Surratt stated
</p>
<p>that she would like to Iiavo Captain Gwynn return with her ; and

<p>THE TPTAL. 89
</p>
<p>Q. What I asked was, whether there was any drinkinc; in the

</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. But he did leave there the nest day ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he left the next day. His leaving was owing to
</p>
<p>the arrival of Mr. Surratt at that time, as near as I could judge.

<p>He said he wanted to see John ; and, as soon as he saw John, ho
</p>
<p>left.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not hoar from IMrs. Surratt, or any of the family,
</p>
<p>that she had told Jolin be could not stay there V
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not at that time. I beard Miss Anna and Mrs.

<p>Surratt afterwards say, that they did not care about having liira
</p>
<p>brought to the house.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that before the assassination ?

<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What rea.son did they give for not wishing him brought to
</p>
<p>the house ?
</p>
<p>A. The way Miss Anna Surratt expressed it, she said she did
</p>
<p>not care about having such sticks brought to the house ; that they
</p>
<p>were not company for her.
</p>
<p>Q. He never did go there afterwards, that you know of?

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. It was about a modium-sized mustache. It was not a very
</p>
<p>small ouo, nor was it what I would call a very largo one.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it so largo that it would entirely change the appearance
</p>
<p>of the wearer ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You think it was '?
</p>
<p>A. I think so.
</p>
<p>Q. You took that off the table where you found it ; and you put
</p>
<p>it in your own bos, wh(!ro you had your paints V
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I j)ut it first in my toiletrbox, a box standing on
</p>
<p>the table ; and afterwards removed it from that box, and put it in
</p>
<p>a box of paints which was in my trank.
</p>
<p>Q. And you have kept it ever since 1
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When he came home, as I understood you, he seemed to be
</p>
<p>feeling for something; said he had lost something. Did ho not
</p>
<p>ask for the mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sur : he said, " MTaero is my mustache ? "
</p>
<p>Q. Why did you not give it to him V It was not yours.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : it was not mine.
</p>
<p>Q. Why did you not give it to him ? Did you suspect him at
</p>
<p>that time of intending any thing wronc ?
</p>
<p>A. I thought it rather queer that a Baptist preacher should use
</p>
<p>a mustache ; and I did not care about having false mustaches
</p>
<p>lying around on my table.
</p>
<p>Q. But you locked it up ?
</p>
<p>A. I know I locked it up.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you intend to do with it ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not intend to do any thing witii it. I took it, and ex-
</p>
<p>hibited it to some of the clerks in the oflice the day afterwards, and
</p>
<p>was foohng with it. I put on a pan- of spectacles and the mustache,
</p>
<p>and was making fun of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Your only reason for not giring it to him, when he said it

</p>
<p>was his, was, that you thought it was singular that a Baptist
</p>
<p>preacher should be fooling with a mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, SU-; and I did not want a false mustache about my
</p>
<p>room.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 91
</p>
<p>Q. It would not have been about your room if you bad given it
</p>
<p>to him, would it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. That would have taken it out of your room ; but, to koop it
</p>
<p>out of your room, you locked it up in a box, and kept the box with
</p>
<p>you?
</p>
<p>A. Then, again, I thought no honest person had any reason to
</p>
<p>wear a false mustache.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you describe to the Com-t young Surratt, his height and
</p>
<p>general appearance ?
</p>
<p>A. He is about six feet high, with a veiy prominent forehead, a
</p>
<p>very large nose, with his eyes sunken. He has a goatee, and very
</p>
<p>long hair of a liglit color.

<p>A. One of these plaid shawls.
</p>
<p>Q. He went to Richmond, you say, some time towards the latter
</p>
<p>part of jMarch ; and, when he got back hero, the fact of the fall of
</p>
<p>Eichmond had reached here, and you saw in his possession some
</p>
<p>twenty-dollar pieces ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw nine or eleven twenty-dollar gold-pieces.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he tell you from whom he got them ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not make any inquiries.
</p>
<p>Q. He told you, however, that he had seen Jefferson Davis and
</p>
<p>Benjamin. Did you understand Bsnjamin to be the man who was
</p>
<p>acting as Secretary of State there ? Did he refer to him as an
</p>
<p>official of the Eebel Government ?
</p>
<p>A. He merely said he had seea Benjamin and Davis, and they
</p>
<p>had told him that Rielnnond would not be evacuated. That is the

<p>sixty dollars in greenbacks for them. Sir. Holahau also saw the

<p>A. I saw the heading in the letter. jMrs. Surratt permitted me
</p>
<p>to read the letter.
</p>
<p>Q. State what the letter contained.
</p>
<p>A. The letter was written in general terms. He stated that lie
</p>
<p>was much pleased with the city of Montreal ; that he was much
</p>
<p>pleased with the French cathedral there ; that ho had bought a

<p>French pea-jacket, for which be paid ten dollars in silver ; that

<p>\-iously occupied by a Congressman. He walked around the room,
</p>
<p>put his hand on the shelf, and pulled out some Congrossionnl docu-
</p>
<p>ments; and ho made the remark, " What a good read I shall have
</p>
<p>when I am left to myself! "
</p>
<p>T u E T n r A L. 95
</p>
<p>Q. You are certain that it was after the Congressional holiday
</p>
<p>vacation ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any other means of knowing that it was after the
</p>
<p>1st of January ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any means of knowing that it was after Christ-
</p>
<p>mas?
</p>
<p>A. Merely by the fact of its being after the Congressional hol-
</p>
<p>idays, and this member had not returned. The other Congressmen
</p>
<p>had nearly all returned ; and ho was one whose return had been
</p>
<p>delayed for some time, it api)ears.
</p>
<p>Q. How do you know tluit 'I
</p>
<p>A. As near as I can understand, the Congressional holidays last
</p>
<p>for about a week, or perhaps two weeks.
</p>
<p>Q. Who said any thing about the member not having returned ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know who the member was ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not. There were the books lying on the table,
</p>
<p> Congressional documents ; and the room had been previously
</p>
<p>occupied, so Booth said, by a member of Congress.
</p>
<p>Q. How do you know that the members had pretty much all
</p>
<p>returned ?
</p>
<p>A. Because Congress was in session at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. How do you happen to recoUoct that it was in session at the
</p>
<p>time of this interview ?
</p>
<p>A. I have no particular way of recollecting it, except according
</p>
<p>to my memory. I do not recollect it by any external facts.
</p>
<p>Q. How does the interview connect itself in your mind with the
</p>
<p>session of Congress, so that you are able to say that Congress was
</p>
<p>in session at tlie time ?
</p>
<p>A. Merely because Mr. Booth got out of his chair, and went to
</p>
<p>this table ; and he took some documents oft" the top of tlie desk,

</p>
<p>and said he, "Congressional documents! Wiat a good read I
</p>
<p>shall have when I am left to myself!" Booth said tlie room luul
</p>
<p>been previously occupied by a member of Congress. It was the
</p>
<p>96 THE TltlAL.
</p>
<p>very first Jay of Booth's arrival in the city, and of his taking pos-
</p>
<p>session of that room.
</p>
<p>Q. It was the first day of his arrival in the city ?
</p>
<p>A. So I understood.
</p>
<p>Q. And the first day he had taken possession of that room ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : so I understood from him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Booth say any thing about the member of Congress
</p>
<p>being absent from the city on vacation ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect that it was after the Congressional holiday
</p>
<p>as distinctly as you recollect any part of the conver.sation ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect that fiict as distinctly as I do recollect the
</p>
<p>conversation about the purchase of the farm.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you no memorandum of your own that would enable
</p>
<p>you to fix the date ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. The date could be probably fixed by a reference
</p>
<p>to the register at the Pennsylvania House. Dr. Mudd had rooms
</p>
<p>at the Pennsylvania House at that time.
</p>
<p>Q. On what street was it that you met Dr. Mudd?
</p>
<p>A. I mot him on Seventh Street, directly opposite Odd Fel-
</p>
<p>lows' Hall.
</p>
<p>Q. What did Dr. Mudd say in explanation of the introduction ?
</p>
<p>Any thing ?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing that I can remember. Mr. Surratt introduced him
</p>
<p>to nie, and he introduced Booth to both of us ; and then Booth in-
</p>
<p>vited us down to the National Hotel.
</p>
<p>Q. Which introduction came first ?
</p>
<p>A. The introduction of Dr. Mudd by Sir. Surratt to me came
</p>
<p>first.
</p>
<p>Q. And did Booth immediately invite you all to his room ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. A\Tiat was said by Booth, if any thing, wliy you should go
</p>
<p>to his room V

</p>
<p> A. Nothing that I remember.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not give any reason for wishing you to go ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : he did not give any reason to me. In going down
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 97
</p>
<p>Seventh Street, Mr. Surratt took Dr. Mudd's arm, and I walked
</p>
<p>with Bootb.
</p>
<p>Q. You went directly to Booth's room ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long, in all, did you stay there?
</p>
<p>A. That I cannot say exactly. I suppose the conversation
</p>
<p>must have lasted about three-quarters of an hour.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that Dr. JMudd -(vrote something on a piece of
</p>
<p>paper ?
</p>
<p>A. I say that Booth took an envelope out of his pocket, and
</p>
<p>took a pencil } and he drew, as it were, lines ou the back of tliis
</p>
<p>envelope ; and Jlr. Surratt and Dr. JIudd were looking at him
</p>
<p>whilst he was doing it ; and they were engaged in deep conversa-
</p>
<p>tion,  private conversation : it was scarcely audible.
</p>
<p>Q. You were in the room at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How close were you to them ?
</p>
<p>A. I was as close to them as that gentleman sitting at the far
</p>
<p>window is to me. [Pointing to Judge Advocate General Holt, 
</p>
<p>a distance of about eight feet.]
</p>
<p>Q. What was the conversation about ?
</p>
<p>A. That I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. You said it was " scarcely audible : " was it not, in pai-t,
</p>
<p>audible ?
</p>
<p>A. It was an indistinct murmur.
</p>
<p>Q. You heard none of it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I heard none of the conversation.
</p>
<p>Q. Which one went out with Dr. Mudd fii-st?
</p>
<p>A. Bootb.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were they out together ?
</p>
<p>A. As near as I can judge, not more than five or eight min-

</p>
<p>utes.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did they go ?
</p>
<p>A. They went into a passage right along the room,  a dark pas-
</p>
<p>sage,  a passage that leads to the front of the room there.
</p>
<p>98 THE TIt/AL.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know that they stopped there ?
</p>
<p>A. That I do not know, bcoausc the door closed after them.
</p>
<p>Q. You mean simply that the door opened on to this passage?
</p>
<p>A. The door opened on to tliis passage ; and, from their move-
</p>
<p>ments, I should judge that they roiniuned outside.
</p>
<p>Q. What makes you think so ?
</p>
<p>A. Because I did not licar any retreating footsteps.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you listen to hear retreating footsteps ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I listened. If they had gone down stairs, a per-
</p>
<p>son would have naturally supposed that a noise would have been
</p>
<p>made with theii- feet ; and then, again, they did not take their
</p>
<p>hats.
</p>
<p>Q. How far were they from the stairs '?
</p>
<p>A. That I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. After they returned, how long was it before Surratt went
</p>
<p>out?
</p>
<p>A. Surratt went out almost immediately after their return.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did the three stay out then together?
</p>
<p>A. They must have staid out about the same length of time
</p>
<p>as at the fii'st interview.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure that Booth was with them when they went out
</p>
<p>the second time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Dr. Sludd say nothing as to how he came to introduce
</p>
<p>Booth to Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Which one of them was it that said the business be-
</p>
<p>tween Booth and Sludd was, that Booth wanted to buy Mudd's
</p>
<p>farm ?
</p>
<p>A. Dr. Sludd came and apologized to me for his private inter-
</p>
<p>view ; and he himself said that the business was, that Mr. Booth
</p>
<p>wanted to purchase his f;irm, and that Booth was not willing to
</p>
<p>offer him a sullicicntly high price, and that he did not care about

<p>T H E Tl! [ A L. 99

</p>
<p>was this Dr. Samuel Mudd, I cannot say.

</p>
<p>the house ?
</p>

<p>Q. Do 3'ou know whether, in fact, ho did visit tlie house, have
</p>
<p>you any reason to sujipose that he ilid, during the time you were
</p>
<p>there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did Mrs. Surratt formerly live ?
</p>
<p>A. She lived at Surrattsville.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that on the road to Bryantown ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say whether it is on the road to Bryantown or not,
</p>
<p>because I have never boon at Bryantown, and I am not sufficient-
</p>
<p>ly acquainted with roads in the country there to give the informa-
</p>
<p>tion. I have never been any farther than Piscataway.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether it is on the road to the place where
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd lives ?
</p>
<p>A. There are several ways of arriving at Dr. Mudd's place.

<p>Piscataway, called the Port Tobacco lload ; and that would lead to
</p>
<p>bis house.
</p>
<p>Q. How far is Dr. Sludd's house from this city?

</p>
<p>Q. You heard the name of Mudd mentioned in the family ?

<p>vania House, where Dr. Jludd had rooms. Wu all went into the
</p>
<p>sitting-room ; and Dr. JIudd came and sat down with me, and we
</p>
<p>talked about the war. He expressed the opinion that the war
</p>
<p>would soon come to an end, and spoke like a Union man. Booth
</p>
<p>was speaking to Surratt. Booth then bade us good-niglit, and
</p>
<p>went out ; and then Sun-att and I hade Dr. Mudd good-night, and
</p>
<p>he remained there, and left the nest mornin'r.
</p>
<p>Q. He left the next morning ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho said he was going to leave the next morning. Whether
</p>
<p>he loft or not, I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time was it that you separated ?
</p>
<p>A. It must have been about h.alf-past ten o'clock in the evening.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Booth talking when he was drawing those hues that

<p>talking.

<p>Q. Are you sure they were looking at what Booth was mai-k-
</p>
<p>ing with his pencil V or were they simply attending to what Booth
</p>
<p>was saying, their eyes resting on the paper ? Did you observe it
</p>
<p>close enough to swear as to that ?
</p>
<p>A. They looked at the envelope, and they looked at the motions
</p>
<p>of the pencil : I could swear to that.
</p>
<p>Q. Their eyes were on the envelope ?

<p>Q. How large was the room?
</p>
<p>A. I have no moans of arriving at that.
</p>
<p>Q. About how largo ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think the room was about half the size of this one.
</p>
<p>By running a partition across this room, you would about get the
</p>
<p>size of that room.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean half as large as this whole room ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. By drawing a partition across the room here, near
</p>
<p>the middle pillar, you might get an idea of the true proportion of it,
</p>
<p>so as to give an idea of the size of tlie room.
</p>
<p>Q. In what part of the room was tlie table ?
</p>
<p>A. The table was in the centre.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stone :

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. At a sort of serenade there,  a musical party ?
</p>
<p>A. It was at the time of the election of the county officers. There
</p>
<p>was a band that had gone down from the city to serenade the officers
</p>
<p>who had been elected ; and this band stopped during the night at
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt's on going down, and serenaded us, and, on returning
</p>
<p>in the morning, again stopped at the door and serenaded us ; and it
</p>
<p>was on tiiat occasion that .John Surratt introduced Herold to me.
</p>
<p>Herold was with this party.
</p>
<p>Q. You saw him, you say, once in Mrs. Surratt's house after she
</p>
<p>moved to the city ?

<p>E Streets, Surratt turned round, and saw that the other two were not

<p>following ; and he told me to go hack and find them. I went back,
</p>
<p>and found them in the restaurant, engaged in close conversation with
</p>
<p>Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. They had met Booth in the restaurant ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. On my approaching them. Booth asked me to go

<p>ter, and Mr. Booth introduced a man to nie, whose name I do not

</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd and Booth.

</p>
<p>kindness or friendship ?
</p>
<p>A. I thought it was an act of friendship at the time. I had
</p>
<p>been told that Booth was in the habit of keeping a buggy at Brooks's
</p>
<p>stable ; and, on going to the hotel that morning, I said to Booth, " I
</p>
<p>am come with an order for that buggy that Mre. Surratt asked you
</p>
<p>for last evening." Said he, " I have sold my buggy ; but hero is ten
</p>
<p>dollars, anil you can go and hire one." I never told Mrs. Surratt that.

<p>THE TRIAL. 113
</p>
<p>A. I went in the office at twelve o'clock tliat day.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him register his name ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What reason have you for supposing that the person you liavo
</p>
<p>just now identified was the person who wrote his name in this place
</p>
<p>on the register ? You did not see him write it V
</p>
<p>A. He came to the counter, and pointed to his name on the regis-
</p>
<p>ter, and asked mo if any one had called to see him.
</p>
<p>Q. \\Tien was that V
</p>
<p>A. On Friday, between twelve and one o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you answer ?

</p>
<p>was between sis and seven o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether he slept there that night ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think he did. I called the chambermaid, and asked
</p>
<p>if she had been in the room. She said she had not been in there
</p>
<p>that day : she had been unable to get in, because she could not find
</p>
<p>the key.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever obtained that key ?
</p>
<p>A. I have never seen it since.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any conversation with a detective, in the course
</p>
<p>of the evening of the 15th, in reference to a suspicious person at the
</p>
<p>Kirkwood House ?
</p>
<p>A. Tiiat was the day after the murder. I think probably I had ;
</p>
<p>but I do not recollect any particular conversation in regard to it.
</p>
<p>We were talking of it pretty nearly all the time, though.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember going with a detective to the room ?

<p>A. Yes : I went to the room with Mr. Loo.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Atzerodt had espresscd any predilection
</p>
<p>in the choice of rooms, or for the particular No. 126 ?

</p>
<p>114 THE TltlAL.
</p>
<p>A. I was not there when he was roomed, and cannot say any
</p>
<p>thing alinut that.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you inspect with the detective the different articles that
</p>
<p>were in the pockets of the coat ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I saw them as Blr. Lee took them out.
</p>
<p>Q. Arc you prepared to identify the pistol that you saw on that
</p>
<p>occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I could identify the particular one. It was
</p>
<p>quite a large pistol.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you describe it ? Was it a Derringer or revolver ?
</p>
<p>A. It was a large pistol, such as cavalry officers wear.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it loaded or not ?
</p>
<p>A. It was loaded and capped.
</p>
<p>Q. How were the barrels, rectangular or round on the inside ?

<p>A. I think it was round,  single-barrelled, with chambers.
</p>
<p>Q. Would you be able to recognize the books that were found in
</p>
<p>that room ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I could recognize the book that had the name of J.
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth on the inside.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you descriljc the knife you saw there 1
</p>
<p>A. It was a sheath-knife, similar to the one lying on the table.
</p>
<p>[ Pointmg to the bowie-knife identified by the witness, John Lee.]
</p>
<p>Q. You cannot swear as to the identity of it ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate then called John M. Lloyd as a witness.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken applied to the Commission to postpone the examina-
</p>
<p>tion of John M. Lloyd until Blonday nest, when Mr. Johnson, the
</p>
<p>senior counsel for Mrs. Mai-y E. Surratt, one of the accused, would
</p>
<p>be present, he having left the court^room to-day ; as the testimony of
</p>
<p>the witness now called would be of the gravest importance as affect-
</p>
<p>ing Slary E. Surratt.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate objected to the application for delay. Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt had now two counsels present.

<p>John M. Llotd,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the proseration, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. I have been residing at Mrs, Surratt's tavern, Surrattsville.
</p>
<p>Q. In what business are you engaged there ?
</p>
<p>A. Hotel-keeping and farming.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you acquainted with John IT. Surratt.
</p>
<p>A. I have had a very small acquaintance with him since about
</p>
<p>the 1st of December last ; not much previous to that.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Herold ?
</p>
<p>A. I know Herold. He has been in my house several times.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Atzcrodt ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, some five or six weeks before
</p>
<p>the assassination of the President, any or all of these men about
</p>
<p>whom I have inquired came to your house ?
</p>
<p>A. They were there.
</p>
<p>Q. All three together ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : John H. Surratt, Herold, and Atzerodt were there to-
</p>
<p>gether.
</p>
<p>Q. What did they bring to your house? and what did they do
</p>
<p>there ?
</p>
<p>A. When they drove up there in the morning, John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>and Atzerodt came first : they went from ray house, and went towards
</p>
<p>T. B.,  a post-ofiice kept about five miles below there. Tiiey had
</p>
<p>not been gone more than half an hour when they returned with
</p>
<p>Herold : then the three were together,  Herold, Surratt, and At-
</p>
<p>zerodt.
</p>
<p>Q. What did they bring to your house ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw nothing until they all three came into the bar-room. I
</p>
<p>noticed one of tlie buggies  the one I supposed Herold was driving

<p>or went down in  standing at the front gate. All three of them,
</p>
<p>when they came into the bar-room, diank, I think ; and then John
</p>
<p>Surratt called me into the front parlor, and on the sofa were two
</p>
<p>116 Till-: TlilAL.
</p>
<p>carbines with ammunition. I think he told rae they were car-
</p>
<p>bines.
</p>
<p>Q. Any thing bcsiJcs the earbines and ammunition ?
</p>
<p>A. There was a rope, and ahso a monkey-wrench.
</p>
<p>Q. How long a rope ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot tell. It was in a coil,  a right smart bundle, 
</p>
<p>probably sixteen or twenty feet.
</p>
<p>Q. Were those articles left at your house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. SuiTatt asked lue to take care of them, to conceal
</p>
<p>the carbines. I told him there was no place there to conceal them,
</p>
<p>and I did not wish to keep such things in the house.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that he asked you to conceal those articles for
</p>
<p>him?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he asked me to conceal them. I told him there
</p>
<p>was no place to conceal them. He then carried me into a room that
</p>
<p>I had never been in, which was just immediately above the store-
</p>
<p>room, as it were in the back l)uilding of the house. I had never
</p>
<p>been in that room previous to that time. He showed me where I
</p>
<p>could put them underneath the joists of the house,  the joists of
</p>
<p>the second iloor of the main building. This little unfinished room will
</p>
<p>admit of any thing between the joists.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they put in that place ?
</p>
<p>A. They were put in there according to his directions.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they concealed in that condition 1
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I put them in there. I stated to Colonel Wells,
</p>
<p>thi'ough mistake, that Surratt put them there ; but I put them in
</p>
<p>there myself I carried the arms up myself.
</p>
<p>Q. How much ammunition was there 1
</p>
<p>A. One cartridge-box.
</p>
<p>Q. For what purpose, and for how long, did he ask you to keep
</p>
<p>those articles ?
</p>
<p>A. I am very positive that he said he would call for them in a
</p>
<p>few days. He said he just wanted them to stay for a few days, and

<p>he would call for them.
</p>
<p>Q. What kind of carbines were they ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not examine them : they had covers over them.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, on the iMonday or Tuesday
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 117
</p>
<p>preceding the assassination of the President, Mrs. Snrratt camo to
</p>
<p>youi- house ?
</p>
<p>A. I was coming to Washington, and I met Mrs. SuiTatt at
</p>
<p>Uuiontown on the Monday previous.
</p>
<p>Q. Did she say any thing to you iu regard to those carbines ?
</p>
<p>A. When she first broached the subject to me, I did not know
</p>
<p>what she had reference to : then she came out plainer ; and I am
</p>
<p>quite positive she asked mo about the "shooting-irons." I am
</p>
<p>quite positive about that, but not altogether positive. I think she
</p>
<p>named " shooting-irons," or .something to call my attention to those
</p>
<p>tilings; for I had almost forgotten about their _ being there. I told
</p>
<p>her that they wore hid away far back ; that I was afraid the house
</p>
<p>would be searched, and they were shoved far back. She told me to
</p>
<p>get them out ready : they would be wanted soon.
</p>
<p>Q. Was her question to you, first, whether they were still there?
</p>
<p>or what was it?
</p>
<p>A. Really, I cannot recollect the first question she put to me. I
</p>
<p>could not do it to save my life.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it so indistinct, that you did not understand what was
</p>
<p>meant ?
</p>
<p>A. It was put in a manner as if slio wanted to draw my attention
</p>
<p>to something so that anybody else could not understand. Finally
</p>
<p>she came out bolder with it.
</p>
<p>Q. And said they would bo wanted soon ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And then she said they would bo wanted soon ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I told her at the same time that I had an idea of
</p>
<p>having them buried ; that I was very unca.sy about having them
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state now whether or not, on the evening of the
</p>
<p>night on which the President was assassinated, Mrs. Surratt came to
</p>
<p>your house with Jlr. ^Vcichmann ?
</p>
<p>A. I went to Marlboro" on that day to attend a trial there in court;

</p>
<p>and in the evening it was probably late when I got home. I found
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt there when I got hotne. I should judge it was about
</p>
<p>five o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. ^Vhat did she say to you ?
</p>
<p>118 THE ritlAL.
</p>
<p>A. She met me out by the wood-pile as I drove in, having fish
</p>
<p>and oysters in the buggy ; and she told nic to have tlioso shooting-irons
</p>
<p>ready that night,  there would be some parties call for them.
</p>
<p>Q. Did she ask you to get any thing else ready for those parties
</p>
<p>besides the shooting-irons ?
</p>
<p>A. She gave me something wi-nppod up in a piece of paper. I
</p>
<p>did not know what it was till I took it up stairs ; and then I found
</p>
<p>it to be a field-glass.
</p>
<p>Q. Did she ask you to "have any whiskey prepared for them ?
</p>
<p>A. She did.
</p>
<p>Q. '^Tiat did she ^ay about that?
</p>
<p>A. She said to get two bottles of whiskey also.
</p>
<p>Q. And said they were to be called for that night ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : they were to be called for that night.
</p>
<p>Q. State now whether they were called for that night by Booth
</p>
<p>and Ilerold.
</p>
<p>A. The carbines and ammunition were called for that night ;
</p>
<p>but the whiskey was not. They drank what whiskey they wanted
</p>
<p>out of the bottle, and did not cany any bottles of whiskey with
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Q. 'WTien they came there, did they ask for the carbines ?
</p>
<p>A. They did not ask for the carbines. Booth tlid not come in :
</p>
<p>Herold came in.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time was that ?
</p>
<p>A. Just about midnight, I think, on Friday night : not over a
</p>
<p>quarter-past twelve o'clock. I did not know Booth ; the pei-son
</p>
<p>was a stranger to me ; he remained on his hcirse. Ilerold came
</p>
<p>into the house and got a bottle of whiskey, and took it out to hun ;
</p>
<p>and Herold drank some out of a glass, I think, before he went out.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember in what terms Booth asked you for that
</p>
<p>whiskey ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he did not ask for the whiskey. He might possibly
</p>
<p>have asked for something to drink ; but he called for the carbines

<p>in such teiTDS that I understood what he wanted. He told mc,
</p>
<p>" Lloyd, for God's sake, make haste and get those things 1" He
</p>
<p>might have included whiskey and all for what I know.
</p>
<p>Q. He had not before that said to you what "those things"
</p>
<p>were?
</p>
<p>TBE TRIAL. 119
</p>
<p>A. He had not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did ho not seem, from the manner of his langiiage, to sxip-
</p>
<p>pose that you akcady understood what ho called for 1
</p>
<p>A. From the way he spoke, he must have becu apprised that I
</p>
<p>already knew what I was to give him.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you say ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not make any reply, but went up stairs and got them.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not give him all the articles,  the field-glass and
</p>
<p>the monkey-wrench and the rope ?
</p>
<p>A. No : the rope and monkey-wi-ench were not what I was told
</p>
<p>to give him. I gave him such things as I was told to give by iMrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt.
</p>
<p>Q. She told you to give hun the cai-bines and whiskey and
</p>
<p>field-glass ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and the whiskey they did not take with them.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did they remain at your house ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think they wore over five minutes.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they take one or both of the carbines '?
</p>
<p>A. Only one.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they explain why the other was not taken ?
</p>
<p>A. Booth said that he could not take his, because his leg was
</p>
<p>broken.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he take a driids also ?
</p>
<p>A. He dranli while he was sitting out on his horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Herold carry the bottle out to him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they say any thing in regard to the assassination as they
</p>
<p>rode away?
</p>
<p>A. Just as they were about leaving, the man who was with
</p>
<p>Herold [Booth] said, " I will tell you some news if you want to
</p>
<p>hoar it," or something to that ofieot. I said, " I am not particular:
</p>
<p>use your own choice about telKng news."  " Well," said he, " I
</p>
<p>am pretty certain that we have assassinated the President and Seere-

<p>taij Sewiu-d." I think that was his language as well as I can
</p>
<p>recollect : " We have assassinated " or " killed the President and
</p>
<p>Secretary Seward."
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say that in Herold's presence ?
</p>
<p>1^0 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I am not positive now whether Ilerold was present at the
</p>
<p>lime he said that, or whctlicr he was across the street. Ilorold
</p>
<p>rode across the street towards the stable. I was so much excited
</p>
<p>and unnerved at it, that I did not know whether it was said in
</p>
<p>Ilcrold's presence or not. Ilerold, as soon as he rode back to
</p>
<p>where wo were, got right between mo and this other man, and rode
</p>
<p>off.
</p>
<p>Q. What hour the next morning was the news of the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of the President received there ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose between eight and nine o'clock the next morning.
</p>
<p>I think it was about nine o'clock ; but I am not sure.
</p>
<p>Q. As the news spread, was it spoken of always that Booth was
</p>
<p>the assassin ? Was his name used ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was. I think on several occasions I heard it used
</p>
<p>there as being the one.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Dr. Bludd during the day.
</p>
<p>A. I never saw Dr. Samuel Mudd : I am not acquainted with
</p>
<p>hun. I have a slight acquaintance with Dr. George Mudd.
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that Ilcrold's language was, "For
</p>
<p>God's sake, make haste and get those things ! "
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that was what Uerold said to me first.
</p>
<p>Q. And you wont straight and got the cai-bines ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; supposing they were the parties IMrs. Surratt had
</p>
<p>referred to. She did not mention any names. She did not say
</p>
<p>who was to come.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did you rent this house of Mrs Surratt?
</p>
<p>A. As well as I can remember now, without any thing to go by,
</p>
<p>I think it was about the 1st of December last.
</p>
<p>Q. Has she been there quite frequently since that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Sirs. Surratt has been there right often. Sometimes I would
</p>
<p>be at home, sometimes not. I do not know how often she has
</p>
<p>been there, but frequently.

</p>
<p>Q. Did you know any thing of a pistol or gun being there ?
</p>
<p>A. I I:ncw of a broken gun being there  a doublo-barrellod
</p>
<p>gun  in the back room. It was there some time ; and John
</p>
<p>Surratt took it away.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you keep a bar ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you detail the first conversation you had with Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt on the first of the last two occasions that you saw her? I
</p>
<p>refer to the time you met her at Uniontown.
</p>
<p>A. The conversation that ensued there was this : "We had passed
</p>
<p>each other somewhat; and I did not recognize Mrs. Surratt, and I
</p>
<p>do not know that she recognized me. I was coming to Washington;
</p>
<p>and she was going down to my place, I supposed. I stopped? and
</p>
<p>so did she. I then got out, and went to her buggy. It had been
</p>
<p>raining, and was very muddy. She spoke to me in a manner
</p>
<p>trying to draw my attention to those things, the carbines, but so
</p>
<p>that I did not understand.
</p>
<p>Q. The word " carbine " was not mentioned ?
</p>
<p>A. No. She finally came out, and, I am quite positive, but
</p>
<p>cannot be detemined about it that she said "shooting-irons,"
</p>
<p>asked me in relation to them.
</p>
<p>Q. Had she asked you any question in reference to the soldiers
</p>
<p>about those premises previous to this ?
</p>
<p>A. I had told her that I expected the place would be searched,
</p>
<p>I think, at that time ; but I am not positive whether it was not pre-
</p>
<p>\-ious to that. I think it was at that tune a conversation ensued as
</p>
<p>to the place being searched by soldiers.
</p>
<p>Q. Immediately after this remark in regard to the soldiera, did
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt speak of the " shooting-ii-ons " ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say now whether it was before or after that remark.
</p>
<p>It was during the conversation that ensued. It was a very quick
</p>
<p>and hasty conversation; and, consequently, I cannot remember

<p>distinctly whether it was before or after.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you swear on your oath that Mrs. Surratt mentioned the
</p>
<p>word " shooting-irons " to you at all?
</p>
<p>A. I am very positive she did.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you certain ?

</p>
<p>122' THE TltlAL.
</p>
<p>A. I am very positive that she named " shooting-irons " on both
</p>
<p>occasions,  not so positive as to the first as I am about the last : I
</p>
<p>know she did on the last occasion.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time in the -day did you meet Mrs. Sui'ratt on
</p>
<p>Friday ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not meet Mrs. Surratt on Friday at all.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not see her ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw her, but did not meet her. I was at Jlarlboro' thai
</p>
<p>day ; and, when I aiTived home, I found ]\Irs. Surratt there.
</p>
<p>Q. What time in the evening was that ?
</p>
<p>A. In the neighborhood of five o'clock, or thereabouts : I do
</p>
<p>not know exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did Mrs. Surratt remain at your house after your
</p>
<p>return ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think she was there over ten minutes then.
</p>
<p>Q. Now state again the conversation that occurred between you
</p>
<p>and Sirs. Surratt during those ton minutes.
</p>
<p>A. I was not in Mrs. Surratt's company during all those ten
</p>
<p>minutes. When I first drove up to the kitchen or wood-yard with
</p>
<p>fish and oysters in the buggy, Mrs. Surratt came out to where I
</p>
<p>was. The first thing .she said to me was, " Talk about the Devil,
</p>
<p>and his imps will appear," or something to that eficct. I said, " I
</p>
<p>was not aware that I was a devil before."  "Well," said she,
</p>
<p>" Mr. Lloyd, T want you to liavo those shooting-irons ready : there
</p>
<p>will be parties here to-uight who vrill call for them."' At the same
</p>
<p>time, she gave me something wi-appod u[) in a newspaper. I did not
</p>
<p>undo it until I got up stairs.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you undo it immediately after you got up stairs ?
</p>
<p>A. As soon as I got up stairs and saw what it was.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you lay it down, and leave the package anywhere before
</p>
<p>it was undone 'i
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I undid it when I laid it out of my hands.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you positive again that Jlrs. Surratt told you, at that

<p>tune, that shooting-irons would be called for tliat night 1
</p>
<p>A. I am very positive.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time in the evening did you state that you had this
</p>
<p>conversation with Mrs. SuiTatt ?
</p>
<p>THE TIllAL. j.j.j
</p>
<p>A. I juJge it was in the neigliborhooil of five o'clock. I Inve
</p>
<p>nothing to go by particularly, without goiug to the house. I took
</p>
<p>no pai-ticular pains to see. It might have been a little later than
</p>
<p>five o'clock.
</p>
<p>_ Q. Did she say to you that some things would be caUed for that
</p>
<p>uight?
</p>
<p>A. She told me to have those shooting-irons ready ; there would
</p>
<p>be parties call for them that night. That was the langua-o she
</p>
<p>made use of; and she gave mo this other thing to give to whoever
</p>
<p>called.
</p>
<p>Q. Were any other remarks made with reference to it?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing more. I earned the fish and oysters into the house 
</p>
<p>and the conversation ensued while I was at work carrying them in.
</p>
<p>That IS about all the conversation I had with Mrs. Sun-att. I went
</p>
<p>into the bar. Mrs. Surratt then requested me to fix her bug-^y for
</p>
<p>her. The front spring-bolts were broken. The spring had become
</p>
<p>detached from the axle. I tied them with some cord, and that waa
</p>
<p>the only fixing I could give them.
</p>
<p>Q. Were any other persons present at this interview?
</p>
<p>A. Mrs. Oflutt was there. I do not know whether she heard
</p>
<p>the conversation or not. She was in the yard, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. This conversation occurred in the yard ?
</p>
<p>A. It occurred in the yard.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Mrs. Oflutt within hearing distance?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose so : I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Is Mrs. Ofl!utt a neighbor of yours ?
</p>
<p>A. She is a sister-in-law of mine.
</p>
<p>Q. What is her given name ?
</p>
<p>A. Emma Oifutt. She is now very low, very sick in bed : so
</p>
<p>Captam Cunnmgham told me to-day.
</p>
<p>Q. Were those shooting-ii-ons called for that night?
</p>
<p>A. They were.
</p>
<p>Q. Who called for them ?

</p>
<p>A. She did.

<p>124 THE TIUAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Why did you not do it?
</p>
<p>A. I gave the field-glass ; but they did not tate the whiskey
</p>
<p>with tliem.
</p>
<p>Q. When were you first interrogated, after this occurrence, in
</p>
<p>regard to what was said at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I gave tlio full information, all the particulars of the infor-
</p>
<p>mation, to Colonel WelLs, on the Saturday week following. I gave
</p>
<p>part of the information to Lieutenant Lovett and Captain Cunning-
</p>
<p>ham some time during the middle of the week, but did not detail
</p>
<p>all this minute conversation.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that the first time you detailed the conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. It was the first tune that I gave the full convereation between
</p>
<p>us.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you given any part of the conversation to any one
</p>
<p>before ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; no part of the conversation.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you related any of these circumstances to any person ?
</p>
<p>A. I only told Lieutenant Lovett and Captain Cunningham that
</p>
<p>it was through the Sarratts I got myself into the difficulty : if they
</p>
<p>had never brought me on there, I never would have got myself
</p>
<p>into difficulty, or words to that effect.
</p>
<p>Q. Were Captain Cunningliam and Lieutenant Lovett present
</p>
<p>together? Did you toll them both together?
</p>
<p>A. They were both present : they were then going from Mr.
</p>
<p>Eoby's to my house, which was close by.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where they are stationed ?
</p>
<p>A. They wore here to-day.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure that was all you told them?
</p>
<p>A. I am quite sure that was all I told them at that time. I
</p>
<p>told Captain Cunningham further about it afterwards.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recall the name of any other person to whom you
</p>
<p>detailed any of these occurrences?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember.

<p>Q. Did you talk with 3Irs. Offutt iu regard to them ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I did ; but I will not be quite positive
</p>
<p>about it. I do not think I did, because the time was .so short. Tho
</p>
<p>soldiers were coming thers, and I had to be in the bar-room all Fri-

<p>day ; ami I do not think I saw Mrs. Offiitt fiom the time I got up,

<p>only at meal-tiraos, except once.
</p>
<p>Q. How soon after Ilorohl and Booth left you did you learn
</p>
<p>positively of the a.s.?assination of the President ?
</p>
<p>A. I learned it from them.
</p>
<p>Q. But how soon did you learn it positively from other parties?

</p>
<p>soldiers came down through our place next morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have a conversation with the soldiers in regard to it ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not have much conversation with them in regard to it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any conversation ?

<p>A. I only deplored the circumstances ; that was all.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you toll them any thing of the circumstance of Booth
</p>
<p>and Herold having been at your place ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not ; and I am only sorry that I did not. There' is
</p>
<p>where I blame myself: it is the only difficulty I labor under.
</p>
<p>Q. What day did you tell Captain Cunningham and Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Lovett ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not altogether prepared to state positively whether it
</p>
<p>was on tho Wednesday following or not. I went down after my
</p>
<p>wife, who was in Charles County, on Monday or Tuesday. On my
</p>
<p>return home, I was arrested on the road. I think it was Wednes-
</p>
<p>day I told them.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any information from Mrs. Surratt as to what
</p>
<p>those things were that were left in your charge ?
</p>
<p>A. She spoke of those " shooting-u-ons ; " that is all.

<p>arrived from Marlboro' when I first saw her that day.

<p>Q. Did Mrs. Sun-att hand any package to you ?

</p>

<p>A. I have a wife.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you a son?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any person to work for you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; a colored man and a colored boy : and there was
</p>
<p>a woman there sometimes who used to live with IMrs. Surratt ; but
</p>
<p>she was not there on this occasion.
</p>
<p>Q. Were the colored man, woman, and boy, all or cither of

</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not to my knowledge. I do not remember that

</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether the soldiers who first came out to the
</p>
<p>house in the morning knew that it was Booth who had killed the
</p>
<p>President ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not suppose that they knew it more than I did ; only
</p>
<p>that they heard so.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they bring the report from the city ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe they brought the report, so far as I could get hold
</p>
<p>of it.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. How long was it before the assassination that the three gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen to whom you rofoiTed came to your house ?
</p>
<p>A. I judge, as well as my memory will serve me, that it was
</p>
<p>five or six weeks before the occurrence.
</p>
<p>Q. Had they one or two buggies 1
</p>
<p>A. Two buggies : there was a man in each buggy, and a man ou
</p>
<p>horseback.
</p>
<p>Q. ^Vho were in the buggies ?
</p>
<p>A. John Surratt and Dave Herold, I think, were in the bug-
</p>
<p>gies. Atzerodt was on horseback.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they all arrive together ?
</p>
<p>A. They all came up together, and at a very fast gait up the
</p>
<p>road. I saw tlicm when they came up.
</p>
<p>Q. Two of them passed on ?
</p>
<p>A. No : all came up to the house, and stopped the horses and
</p>
<p>buggies. One of them stopped right at the front-yard gate ; and the
</p>
<p>other stopped about the corner, as well as I remember. I thought

<p>nothing much of it at the time, and cannot locate them distinctly :
</p>
<p>only I noticed the one at the front gate with the sorrel horse ; and
</p>
<p>128 TBE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>the other, I think, was about the corner. I paid no material atten-
</p>
<p>tion to them.
</p>
<p>Q. W[\o went on down the road towards the place called T. B. ?
</p>
<p>A. That morning, when they fu'st came down, John Surratt and
</p>
<p>Atzerodt. When they first came down from, as I supposed, Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, or up this way, they stopped at my house, and started
</p>
<p>towards T. B.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Ilerold with them then ?
</p>
<p>A. Herold came back with them. After they were gone half
</p>
<p>an hour, aU thi-ee returned.
</p>
<p>Q. Herold did not come to your house that morning ?
</p>
<p>A. No : he was there the night before.
</p>
<p>Q. Had ho gone down the country ?
</p>
<p>A. He told me that night that he had to go down to T. B.
</p>
<p>Q. When Atzerodt and Sm-ratt came and remained a whUe, they
</p>
<p>went on down towai-ds T. B. ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; down that direction.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were they gone 1
</p>
<p>A. Not over half an hour before they returned again.
</p>
<p>Q. Who handed the carbines to you ?
</p>
<p>A. When they came into the bar, after being there a few min-
</p>
<p>utes, John Surratt told me he wanted to see me ; and he took me
</p>
<p>to the front piu'lor ; and on the sofa in the front parlor these car-
</p>
<p>bines and things were lying.
</p>
<p>Q. Then Mr. Surratt was the one who gave the arms into your
</p>
<p>charge ?
</p>
<p>A. ]\Ir. Surratt was the one who requested me to receive them
</p>
<p>for him.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know which buggy brought them up ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see the arras taken out of the buggies at all ; I
</p>
<p>did not see any thing of qny arms until they wore shown to mo on
</p>
<p>the sofa : but, from the position of Herold's buggy, I supposed he
</p>
<p>was the one who brouglit them.

</p>
<p>Q. Your only reason for supposuig they came from Herold's

<p>whereas the other buggy was at the corner ?

<p>A. That is all.

<p>TBE TRIAL. 129
</p>
<p>Q. What became of that rope?
</p>
<p>A. The rope was not taken away. It was put into the store-
</p>
<p>room with the monkey-wrench, and, I suppose, remained there, un-
</p>
<p>less they have got it away since. I told the colonel at the Old
</p>
<p>Capitol of it ; and I suppose he sent down for it, but I do not know.
</p>
<p>It was left tliere.
</p>
<p>Q. At that time you had no conversation either with Atzerodt
</p>
<p>or Herold about the ai-ms : it was entirely with Mr. Sun-att ?
</p>
<p>A. With Mr. Surratt altogether.
</p>
<p>Q. I think the roads cross at your house ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not suppose it is more than seventy or seventy-five
</p>
<p>yards below the house where the roads cross.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Booth and Horold when they left the house,
</p>
<p>after they got the carbines, on the night of the assassination ? !
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Which road did thoy take !
</p>
<p>A. They took the road towards T. B.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they both start off together ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Herold came from towards the stable, and came
</p>
<p>between me and the man who was on the light-colored horse ; and
</p>
<p>they rode right off at a pretty rapid gait.
</p>
<p>Q. You cannot say whether it was in Herold's presence that
</p>
<p>Booth announced to you that he had assassinated the President ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not positive whether it was in his presence or not, be-
</p>
<p>cause he rode across the street.
</p>
<p>Q. Did any one say any thing to you about the rope and the
</p>
<p>wrench afterwards ?
</p>
<p>A. I think not until I told it myself,
</p>
<p>Q. Had you seen Herold pass there that day, before the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation, on the same day ?
</p>
<p>A. I had not. I had not seen Mr. Herold for some time before
</p>
<p>that.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you think you were arrested on Tuesday ?

</p>
<p>Q. Did Herold that night take a drink at the bar?
</p>
<p>A. He did.
</p>
<p>Q. And carried a bottle out to Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he bring the bottle back to you ?
</p>
<p>A. He brought the bottle back into the house.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he pay for the drink he took ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho remarked to me, " I owe you a couple of dollars;" and
</p>
<p>said he, " Here." I looked at it when it got light next morning, and
</p>
<p>found it to be one dollar, which just about paid for the bottle of
</p>
<p>liquor they pretty nearly drank.
</p>
<p>Q. He gave you the dollar ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>Q. Was it light enough for you to observe the kind of horses
</p>
<p>they rode ?
</p>
<p>A. The moon was shining.
</p>
<p>Q. What kind of horses were tlicy ?
</p>
<p>A. One I took to be a gray horse. It was a light-colored horse,
</p>
<p>almost a white horse. I supposed it to be a gray horse, in the moon-
</p>
<p>light. The other was a bay horse. The light horse was a large
</p>
<p>honse,  I suppose, some sixteen hands high : the other was not so
</p>
<p>large.
</p>
<p>Q. Which rode the light horse ?
</p>
<p>A. The one who broke his leg was on the light horse : Herold
</p>
<p>was riding the bay.
</p>
<p>Q. You say, that, although Mrs. Offutt was in the yard where the
</p>
<p>conversation took place between you and Mrs. Surratt, you ai-e not
</p>
<p>certain that she was near enough to hear it ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not positive whether she was or not.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it in a low tone of voice that Mrs. Surratt spoke to you ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, not very: not very loud, either,  loud enough to
</p>
<p>hear.

<p>and Herold ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 131
</p>
<p>A. He came to my place, I judge, about five or six weeks be-
</p>
<p>fore, in company with Surratt.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know him before ?
</p>
<p>A. He bad been in my place several times before.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any conversation with him on this occasion ?

<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you known Atzorodt by any nick-name,  "Port
</p>
<p>Tobacco " ?
</p>
<p>A. I heard him called that. I used to call him "Bliserable ; "
</p>
<p>and then I called him, for a long time, "Stranger." I did not know
</p>
<p>his name very well. I do not think I had been acquainted with him
</p>
<p>over two montlis before the assassination.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Dosteb :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know bis name to bo Atzerodt when he was down
</p>
<p>there ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not know bis name to be Atzerodt, until, I suppose,
</p>

</p>
<p>er knew his full name.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewino :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner Arnold, the one in the comer ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know him.

</p>
<p>could not carry it.
</p>
<p>132 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. You never brought but one down ?
</p>
<p>A. That is all.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you those carbines convenient when they came ?
</p>
<p>A. They were in my bed-chamber.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you bring them down ?
</p>
<p>A. Not till they came.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you bring them from the store-room in which they
</p>
<p>were originally placed ?
</p>
<p>A. No gi'eat while after Sirs. Surratt left, according to her orders
</p>
<p>to get them out, and have them ready.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. The same evening ?
</p>
<p>A. The same night.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. You say that you had them in your bed-chamber when they
</p>
<p>called ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you give them the carbines before or after they told you
</p>
<p>they had killed the President ?
</p>
<p>A. They were given to them before. They never told me about
</p>
<p>killing the President until they were about riding off.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any colored servants about your establishment ?
</p>
<p>A. Two there generally ; and a man who used to Hve with Jlr.
</p>
<p>Sui-ratt used to stay there also.
</p>
<p>Q. Were any of those about the yard when they called ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose the old colored man was there in his room.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know that he saw them ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you retired ?
</p>
<p>A. I had been to bed and asleep.
</p>
<p>Q. They waked you up ?
</p>
<p>A. I woke up just as the clock struck " twelve." I went to
</p>
<p>bed between eight and nine o'clock, I judge. I was right smart ir

<p>for liquor on that evening, and after night I got more so ; and I went
</p>
<p>to bed very cai-ly, and slept very sound until twelve o'clock. At
</p>
<p>twelve o'clock, I roused up.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 133
</p>
<p>Q. Between the Saturday and the next Tuesday, had you not a
</p>
<p>great many inquiries made you about suspicious characters passin"
</p>
<p>that way ?
</p>
<p>A. All the inquiries I had, pretty much, were on Saturdny.
</p>
<p>They were not many, although a good many soldiers came there.
</p>
<p>There were so many persons about the establishment, that they would
</p>
<p>ask others almost as quick as they would me. On Sunday morn-
</p>
<p>ing, I took a walk around an old neighbor's place with him. In
</p>
<p>the evening, when I came back, there was a crowd of persons who
</p>
<p>occupied my attention pretty much home all the time, until I drove
</p>
<p>them out of the house, and locked the doors. They got pretty hin-h.
</p>
<p>I was not troubled that night any more until the soldiers came, and
</p>
<p>searched the place that night.
</p>
<p>Q. What account did you give when asked ?
</p>
<p>A. When they a.skcd mo if I bad seen two men pass that wav in
</p>
<p>the morning, I told them I had not. That is the only thing I blame
</p>
<p>myself about. If I had given the information that was asked of me,
</p>
<p>I should have been perfectly free as regards it. That is the only
</p>
<p>thing I am sorry that I did not do.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any conversation with Jlrs. Offutt m regard to
</p>
<p>the package after Mrs. Surratt went away ?
</p>
<p>A. I think, but I will not bo positive about that, I told Mrs.
</p>
<p>Ofilitt that it was a field-glass.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mrs. OfFutt have any thing to say to you about a pack-
</p>
<p>ago after Mrs. Surratt went away ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know, indeed. I cannot remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Did she tell you that Mrs. Surratt gave her a package ?
</p>
<p>A. She did not.
</p>
<p>Q. How large is the yard in front of your house ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose that from the front of the house to the gate is
</p>
<p>about as far as from here, where I am standing, to the door coming
</p>
<p>into this room.

</p>
<p><f her buggy, I bade her good-by.

</p>
<p>Q. Where were you standing when you had the conversation
</p>
<p>with her last ?
</p>
<p>A. Which conversation have you reference to ?
</p>
<p>Q. The Olio in which she made the remark about tlio " shootinjr-
</p>
<p>irons."
</p>
<p>A. I was standing then near the wood-pile, in tho back yard ;
</p>
<p>the kitchen-yard, we call it.
</p>
<p>On motion, tho Commission adjourned until Jloiiday morning,
</p>
<p>May 15, at ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>Monday, Slay 15, 1805.
</p>
<p>The Court again met on Monday, and proceeded with the exami-
</p>
<p>nation.
</p>
<p>Edward Spangler, who has hitherto had no counsel, was this day
</p>
<p>added to the list of those for whom 3Ir. Ewing appears ; and, as the
</p>
<p>other prisoners had severally done before, he asked leave to with-
</p>
<p>draw for the time his plea of " Not guilty," heretofore filed, so that he
</p>
<p>might ple.^d to tho jurisdiction of tho Court. He said, through his
</p>
<p>counsel, that he had not heretofore had counsel to advise him as to
</p>
<p>the pleas which it would be expedient for him to make.
</p>
<p>The application was granted ; and thereupon, through his counsel,
</p>
<p>he presented the plea that the Court had no jurisdiction in this pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding against him, because, he says, he has not been in tlie military
</p>
<p>service of the United States. And, for further plea, he said that
</p>
<p>loyal civil courts, in which all the offences charged arc triable, exist,
</p>
<p>and are in full and free operation, in all tho places where the several
</p>
<p>offences charged arc alleged to have been committed.
</p>
<p>And further, that this Court has no jurisdiction in the matter of
</p>
<p>the alleged conspiracy, so far as it is charged to have been a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to murder Abraham Lincoln, late I'resident of the United
</p>
<p>States, and William H. Seward, Secretary of State. The same
</p>
<p>plea is made in reference to the charge of murdering tho late Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, &c, because the oSi'nces were alleged to have been commit-
</p>
<p>ted in tho city of Washington, in which arc loyal civil courts in full

<p>operation, in which all such offences are triable.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 135
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate presented a replication in answer to the
</p>
<p>special pica, aiEniiing the jurisdiction of the Court ; and the Court,
</p>
<p>as in other cases, overruled the plea.
</p>
<p>The same prisoner then, as others had done, applied for a sepa-
</p>
<p>rate trial, for the reason that ho believes his defence will be greatly
</p>
<p>prejudiced by a joint trial.
</p>
<p>The Commission overruled the application for a severance ; and
</p>
<p>Spanglcr renewed his plea of " Not guilty " to the specification of
</p>
<p>the charge and to the charge.
</p>
<p>Michael O'Laughlin, through his counsel, pui-sued the same course
</p>
<p>with the same result.
</p>
<p>LoDis J. Weichmann
</p>
<p>was recalled by leave of the Court, and cross-examined.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. In your testimony, you mentioned, that, as Dr. Mudd and
</p>
<p>Booth were walking up Seventh Street, you and Surratt were walk-
</p>
<p>ino- down ; and Dr. jMudd called out to Surratt, and Surratt turned
</p>
<p>round. Were you and Booth on the same side of the street "i
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Then you had passed each other?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : we had passed each other before Mudd recognized
</p>
<p>Surratt ; and I said, " John, .ome one is calling you ; " and he turned
</p>
<p>round, and recognized Dr. Bludd.
</p>
<p>Q. By whom have you heard Dr. Samuel JIudd spoken of in the
</p>
<p>Surratt Family before this meeting ?
</p>
<p>A. Miss Surratt has spoken of him. She was educated at Bry-
</p>
<p>antown ; and I think she was acquainted with the jMudd Family.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure that she spoke of Dr. Samuel Mudd 1
</p>
<p>A. I have heard the name mentioned in the house ; but, whether
</p>
<p>it was she who mentioned it, I cannot positively say. I have heard
</p>
<p>the name of Dr. Samuel Mudd and of Dr. George JIudd mentioned
</p>
<p>in the house.
</p>
<p>Q. You think it was she who mentioned the name ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and I also heard a IMiss Angela Mudd mentioned.
</p>
<p>These are the only Mudds I ever heard spoken of.
</p>
<p>136 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Dr. Samuel JIudd lives near Bryan-
</p>
<p>town?
</p>
<p>A. I have hoard it said, in Charles County ; but in what particu-
</p>
<p>lar portion of the county he resides, I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Is Bryantown in Charles County?
</p>
<p>A. I could hai-dly tell that : I think it is. I have never been
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Johnson :
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say on Saturday that you wont with Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt the first time to Surrattsville, on the Tuesday before tho
</p>
<p>assassination, in a buggy with her. Do you recollect whether you
</p>
<p>Stopped on your way to Surrattsville ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Where?
</p>
<p>A. We stopped on two or three different occasions.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you stop at Uniontown ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know the name of the particular town. I do not
</p>
<p>know where Uniontown is.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you stop at a vdlage ?
</p>
<p>A. We stopped on the road : I do not remember any particular
</p>
<p>village that could be seen.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know INIr. Lloyd ?
</p>
<p>A. I have met him three times.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know him as the keeper of the hotel at Surratts-
</p>
<p>vUle?
</p>
<p>A. I knew him as the man who had rented Jlrs. Surratt's house
</p>
<p>from her, because I copied off tlio instrument.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect seeing him by tho buggy at any time on
</p>
<p>your way between Washington and Surrattsville on that Tuesday ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : we met his carriage. Ilis carriage drove past ours ;
</p>
<p>and Mrs. Surratt called after Mr. Lloyd ; and Mr. Lloyd got out
</p>
<p>and approached the buggy ; and Mrs. Surratt -put her head out, and
</p>
<p>had a conversation with him.

</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Any thing about shooting-irons?
</p>
<p>A. There was nothing mcntionod at all about shooting-irons. STrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt spoke to Mrs. OfFutt about this man Howell. Jlrs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt was in the carriage : she said she was going to see him, and see
</p>
<p>if ho would not take the oath of allegiance and get released, and
</p>
<p>that she was going to apply to General Augur and Judge Turner
</p>
<p>for the purpose.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was the interview between BIr. Lloyd and Mrs.
</p>
<p>Sun-att on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. That I could not say exactly : I do not think it was over five
</p>
<p>or eight minutes. I do not carry a watch myself, and I had no precise
</p>
<p>means of judging.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say at first that you did not hoar the
</p>
<p>whole of this conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not hear the conversation between Mr. Lloyd and Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt, but between Mrs. Surratt and Mrs. Offutt, who was at some
</p>
<p>distance in the carriage.
</p>
<p>Q. It is the conversation between Mrs. Surratt and Mr. Lloyd
</p>
<p>that we are talking of. You could not hear that?
</p>
<p>A. I could not hear it.
</p>
<p>Bj Mr. Johnson :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you reecoUoct whether it was raining?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think it was raining at the particular time. It was
</p>
<p>a murky day, a very cloudy day ; but I could not say whether it
</p>
<p>was raining or not : I did not remember that.
</p>
<p>John W. Lloyd recalled by leave of the Court.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :

<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness two carbines.] Are these the
</p>
<p>carbines that John II. Surratt left at your house ?

</p>
<p>A. Tbey were brought in with covers. One of these has a cover
</p>
<p>138 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>on : it looks liko the cover tliiit was ou them. These look like the
</p>
<p>carbines that were brouglit there.
</p>
<p>Q. You dill not see them witli the cover off?
</p>
<p>A. I took the cover off one ; and the peculiar kind of breech at-
</p>
<p>tracted my attention. I never saw one like it before. Both the
</p>
<p>carbines left at my house had covers. I did not examine both of
</p>
<p>them : I only slipped the cover off one, and looked at it.
</p>
<p>The witness added, 
</p>
<p>I desire to make a statement, if the Court will permit mo. I
</p>
<p>said, on Saturday, that it was on Blonday that I met 3Irs. Surratt at
</p>
<p>Uniontown. I got the days confounded by being summoned to Court
</p>
<p>on two Mondays in succession. The first Jlonday I was summoned
</p>
<p>to Court, I did not go, but came to Washington ; and I was under
</p>
<p>the impression that it was on that Jlonday I met Jlrs. Surratt : but
</p>
<p>in fact, on the Monday that I said here I met Mrs. Surratt, I went
</p>
<p>to Court ; and, consequently, it was on Tuesday that I met her at
</p>
<p>Uniontown. I say so now on reflection. In the last of my exami-
</p>
<p>nation, in stating with regard to the bundle Mrs. Surratt gave me, 1 did
</p>
<p>not exactly recollect, but was pretty positive that I carried it directly
</p>
<p>up stairs ; but I cannot say now that I am positive. I carried it up
</p>
<p>stairs. The whole thing was very hurried ; and I had licjuor at the
</p>
<p>time, so that I cannot distinctly recollect : but I think it likely that
</p>
<p>I laid it upon a safe in the dining-room, and that is my impression.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. You are sure it was the same package you examined after-
</p>
<p>wards ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was the same.
</p>
<p>Q. And it was a field-glass ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. The same one you handed to Hcrold ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

</p>
<p>should like to ask one question. Do I understand you as stating
</p>
<p>that you were in liquor at the time you had the conversation with
</p>
<p>Mrs. Sui-ratt?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 139
</p>
<p>A. I was somewhat in liquor at tlie time that I was in conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with Mrs. Surratt, as I said on Saturday.
</p>
<p>Q. On that account, you do not feel able to give clear testimony?
</p>
<p>Is that the explanation you want to make?
</p>
<p>A. I wanted to explain that I was not positive whether the pack-
</p>
<p>age was carried up' stairs or not. It was a hurried piece of busi-
</p>
<p>ness with me, and, consequently, I did not reflect over it.
</p>
<p>BLuiY Van Tine,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : at 420, D Street.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you keep rooms to rent ?
</p>
<p>A. I do.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you look at the prisoners at the bar here, and state
</p>
<p>whether, in the month of February last, you saw any one of them,
</p>
<p>and which one ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I see two gentlemen who had rooms at my house.
</p>
<p>Q. Which two ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Arnold and Mr. O'Laughlin.
</p>
<p>Q. What time in February last was it ?
</p>
<p>A. As near as I can recollect, it was on the 10th of February
</p>
<p>they came. I could not be positive as to the day ; but I think it was
</p>
<p>the 10th.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I know him by coming to the house to see the gentlemen who
</p>
<p>had rooms there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he or not come very often to see the prisoners, O'Laugh-
</p>
<p>lin and Arnold ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. Would he remain a good while in conversation with them ?
</p>
<p>A. Not as a general thing, I believe ; but he was admitted in

<p>the room, and I saw nothing farther of them.
</p>
<p>Q. Did these prisoners leave the city, and return several times ?
</p>
<p>140 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : thoy frequently left on Saturday for Baltimore, as
</p>
<p>I understood, their homes.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Booth accompanied thera or not ?
</p>
<p>A. I think not.
</p>
<p>Q. "Were these interviews between Booth and them alone, or was
</p>
<p>Booth accompanied by other persons ?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw any one in company with them.
</p>
<p>Q. They told you themselves that his name was J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, did thoy ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : Jlr. Arnold did. I inquired who he was. He
</p>
<p>told me his name was J. Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he call for them frequently, and find them out?
</p>
<p>A. Sometimes.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he, or not, manifest much anxiety to see them on the.se
</p>
<p>occasions ?
</p>
<p>A. Frequently, when they were away : sometunes he came two
</p>
<p>or three times before thoy returned. He generally appeared very
</p>
<p>anxious for their rctura.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he leave messages for thera ?
</p>
<p>A. Sometimes he requested, that, if they returned before he called
</p>
<p>again, they should come to the stable ; or he sometimes left a note,
</p>
<p>going into the room, and writing a note.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you look at that photograph [Exhibit No. 1], and see if
</p>
<p>you recognize it as that of the man you call Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; T think so : but I cannot see very well without my
</p>
<p>glasses. [Puts on her spectacles.] I should not call it a good like-
</p>
<p>ness. I think him a better-looking man than that is ; but I should
</p>
<p>think it was the man I saw ; but it is a poor likeness of him.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember the last time Booth played in the city,
</p>
<p>about the 18th or 20th of Jlarch ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : somewhere about that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did these prisoners bring you complimentary tickets from
</p>
<p>Booth on that occasion ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I expressed a wish to see him ; and Mr. O'Laugh-
</p>
<p>lin gave me the tickets.
</p>
<p>(J. Dirt ho seem to be more confidential and intimate with one of
</p>
<p>these prisoners than with the other ?
</p>
<p>THE TJIIAL. 141
</p>
<p>A. Sometimes ho would inquire for one, sometimes the other ;
</p>
<p>though T think he more frequently inquired for O'Laughlin.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see any arms in their rooms ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw a pistol ouee ; only once.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remeniher at any time seeing a man call, a very rough-
</p>
<p>looking person, a lahoring man or mechanic?
</p>
<p>A. Not a laboring man. A man used to come sometimes there,
</p>
<p>and I think he pai-sed one night with them ; but I am not certain.
</p>
<p>By his leaving the room very early one morning, I thought so ; but
</p>
<p>he might have come in with them, and gone out early in the
</p>
<p>morning. I never heard his name. I should know him if I saw
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you give a description of him ?
</p>
<p>A. Not what you call a gentleman in appearance, but a very
</p>
<p>respectable-looking mechanic.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you describe him at all ?
</p>
<p>A. Not very minutely. His skin was hardened, as of a man
</p>
<p>who had been exposed to weather ; and he had sandy whiskers.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recognize him among these prisoners?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they represent themselves to have any business transac-
</p>
<p>tions with Booth ; and if so, of what character ?
</p>
<p>A. They said they were in the oil trade ; but they did not say
</p>
<p>they were connected with him in it. They merely said they were
</p>
<p>in the oil business.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they seem to have an extensive correspondence? Did
</p>
<p>many letters come to them ?
</p>
<p>A. Not a great many : some letters came.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did they generally come from, if you noticed ?
</p>
<p>A. I never noticed : I merely took the letters in, and laid them
</p>
<p>down.
</p>
<p>Q. They wore addressed to the names you gave now, O'Laugh-
</p>
<p>Im and Arnold ?

</p>
<p>A. Sometimes to one, sometimes to the other.
</p>
<p>Q. You say Booth came there frequently, by day and night?
</p>
<p>A. Not in the night frequently. I do not know that I ever saw
</p>
<p>him at night. He might have come without my seeing him. It was
</p>
<p>142 T H E T II I A L.
</p>
<p>the winter season, when I sit back ; and persons might come into the
</p>
<p>other part of the house without my seeing them.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know whether, when they went out at nights and
</p>
<p>staid late, they were with Booth or not ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You have not seen them since the time they left your house ?
</p>
<p>A. Never till the present time.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that about the 20th of JIarch ?
</p>
<p>A. I think that it was the 3IouJay after Booth played : on Satur-
</p>
<p>day they left.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see Booth riding out with either of these men ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not think I ever did. I cannot say positively
</p>
<p>whether I did or not. I would not like to .say on my oath that I
</p>
<p>saw that, though he frequently came to the house in a can-iage and
</p>
<p>inquired for them ; but I never saw them riding, that I recollect.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Me. Cox :
</p>
<p>Q. Can you state with certainty whether these gentlemen said
</p>
<p>they were then in the oil business, or had been ?
</p>
<p>A. That tljoy were then in the oil business.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that dm-ing the first part of then- stay, or at what time
</p>
<p>during their occupation of your room 1
</p>
<p>A. I think they had been there two or three weeks.
</p>
<p>Q. They had been there two or three ^eeks when they told you
</p>
<p>that?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Jlr. Arnold told me.
</p>
<p>Q. That would bring it to the beginning of JIarch ?
</p>
<p>A. Somewhere about that.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they say any thing to you when they went away about
</p>
<p>where they were going to ?
</p>
<p>A. Pennsylvania, I understood.
</p>
<p>Q. They said they were going to Pennsylvania when they left
</p>
<p>your house ?
</p>
<p>A. I'^es, sir.

<p>Q. Did they say any thing to you about having abandoned the
</p>
<p>oil business ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I had very little conversation with them at any time.
</p>
<p>THE TlilAL. 143
</p>
<p>Q. Were they much in their room, or moving about?
</p>
<p>A. They did not stay a groat deal in the room.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they occupy it regularly at night ?
</p>
<p>A. They were out some nights all night.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you fix the 20th of March with certainty as the day they
</p>
<p>left?
</p>
<p>A. If you could ascertain what night Booth played. I know it
</p>
<p>was the Monday following.
</p>
<p>Q-. 'N'^Tiat was he playing ?
</p>
<p>A. Pescara.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not speak with certainty of any one else visiting them
</p>
<p>besides Mr. Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. No, su: : not any one else that I know. Persons might have
</p>
<p>often gone into the room, and we not see or know them.
</p>
<p>Q. The only person you remember is a respectable-looking me-
</p>
<p>chanic, whom you do not identify as one of the prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. That was all ; and he is not present. I should know him if I
</p>
<p>was to see him anywhere.
</p>
<p>Q. When were Booth's visits most frequent,  during the month
</p>
<p>of February, or the latter part of their stay in March ?
</p>
<p>A. I think pretty much the same all through the time they were
</p>
<p>there. He was a constant visitor.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not think his visits fell off in point of frequency
</p>
<p>towards the close of the stay ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you present at any conversation between them at any
</p>
<p>time 1
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You never heard any of their conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was their room up stairs ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : they had the back parlor. The doors were always
</p>
<p>closed ; and it was none of my business to piy into the conversation

</p>
<p>Billy Williams,
</p>
<p>(colored,) a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn,
</p>
<p>testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether you are acquainted with
</p>
<p>the prisoners O'Laughlin and Arnold? Look at thera, and see if
</p>
<p>you have ever met with them before.
</p>
<p>A. I know Blr. O'Laughlin, and I know Mr. Arnold by sight.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever met with them before t
</p>
<p>A. I have met Sir. O'Laughlin.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you meet with him ?
</p>
<p>A. I met Mr. O'Laughlin when I carried the letters to him and
</p>
<p>gave them to him at the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was that theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. In Baltimore.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that ?
</p>
<p>A. It was in JIarch ; but I do not know what time.
</p>
<p>Q. This last Mai'chV
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. From whom did you carry letters to him ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. J. Wilkes Booth, the actor 1
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you carry them to O'Laughhn alone, or to him and to
</p>
<p>Arnold ?
</p>
<p>A. I carried one to Jlr. Arnold ; and I gave it to a lady there at
</p>
<p>the door, and she said she would send them up. I then went off. I
</p>
<p>was in a hurry.
</p>
<p>JIu. Cox. Unless that is followed up by something on the part
</p>
<p>of O'Laughlin, I hardly think it competent evidence,  the carry-
</p>
<p>ing of a letter to him.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you delivered the letter at the boarding-house of
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. When I carried the letters,  there were two,  I
</p>
<p>was going by Bamum's at the tune ; and Mr. Booth came down the
</p>
<p>THE riilAL. 145
</p>
<p>steps, and asked me if I would take it. I told bim- 1 had to go to
</p>
<p>the country ; liut he said it would not take any time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he tell you where O'Laughliu lived V
</p>
<p>A. In Exeter Street, he told mo.
</p>
<p>Q: He told you it was for O'Laugblin ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever carry a letter to the prisoner Arnold ?
</p>
<p>A. I earned a letter up there : I do not know who it was for.
</p>
<p>Q. Who gave it to you ?
</p>
<p>A. I gave it to a lady.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was it from ?
</p>
<p>A. IMr. Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state to you whom it was for ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. He just told mo,  ho called me Bill,  said he,
</p>
<p>" Here is a letter ; and I want you to carry it up to this number."
</p>
<p>I went up with it. I did not know where the number was, I did
</p>
<p>not know that I was' on the right street ; and I asked a lady who was
</p>
<p>coming out of a door whore was the number, and she told mo on that
</p>
<p>side ; and I went down there.
</p>
<p>Q. And delivered the letter ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not know for whom it was ?
</p>
<p>A. No, SU-.
</p>
<p>Q. You said that Booth did not tell you for whom it was ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : ho told me just to can-y it to the number tliat was
</p>
<p>on it. There was a colored follow with me ; and I asked him to look
</p>
<p>at it, and sec what it was, as I could not read writing.
</p>
<p>Q. Were there more than one ?
</p>
<p>A. Two.
</p>
<p>Q. To Arnold?
</p>
<p>A. Two letters I had to carry,  one up town, and one down
</p>
<p>town.

</p>
<p>A. lie tolil me. I knew the name. I bad almost forgotten it;
</p>
<p>but I had to go to tho theatre, and I went there, and saw O'Laugh-
</p>
<p>Un there ; and I told hhn he had saved me a smart deal of trouble,
</p>
<p>and handed it to him.
</p>
<p>Q. He told you it was for Arnold, did ho?
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewino. I certainly object to that.
</p>
<p>The JnDGE Advocate. Tho theory is, that these men were co-
</p>
<p>conspirators ; and, if that is established, their declarations are certain-
</p>
<p>ly evidence against each other.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewinq. I object to that question as it is put down ; and I
</p>
<p>should like to have my objection entered.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q I asked you for whom O'Laughlin said the letter was ?
</p>
<p>A. I said, when I carried the letter to him, " Mr. O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>here is a letter Jlr. Booth gave to me ; " and I handed it to him.
</p>
<p>That is all I know. When Uv. Booth told me I had to carry the
</p>
<p>letter, I said, " Certainly, I will carry it; but I will take my own
</p>
<p>time ;' " and he gave me it to carry, and I thought no more of it.
</p>
<p>Q.' Booth told you this letter was for O'Laughlin, did be ?
</p>
<p>A Ygs sir.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. I must object to the whole of this evidence. I made
</p>
<p>the objection a short time ago, in the expectation that it would be fol-
</p>
<p>lowed up by some evidence of the act of O'Laughlin on the rccc.pt
</p>
<p>of tho letter. Nothing of that sort is produced.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. He states that O'Laughlin received the
</p>
<p>letter. ,
</p>
<p>Mr Cox. Yes, sir ; but that is not sufficient. I object to the
</p>
<p>whole of the evidence of the dehvery of this note to O'Laughlm ; and
</p>
<p>I desire, if the objection is sustained, that it bo struck out of the
</p>
<p>record. ...
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. K the Court please, it is snnply going
</p>
<p>to establish the intmiacy of these men, their close personal vclai.uns
</p>
<p>with each other, as evidenced by their correspondence ; and I tbmk,

</p>
<p>in that point of view, it is clearly competent. We have presented
</p>
<p>them as vi.sitlng each other constantly. Now we present them a-s
</p>
<p>coresponding with each other constantly. Both facts go to establish
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>147
</p>
<p>an intimacy which is in accordance with the tlieoiy of the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion; which is, (hat they arc co-conspiratoi-s.
</p>
<p>The Peesidext. What was the objection of counsel ?
</p>
<p>31k. Cox. I object to any evidence of the acts of Booth himself.
</p>
<p>Tlio act of sending a note to an individual, no matter what may be
</p>
<p>tiio contents of that note, would bo no evidence against that in<livid-
</p>
<p>ual, unless the contents were accepted and acted upon by him. The
</p>
<p>mere fact of intimacy alone is an innocent fact on the part of the ac-
</p>
<p>cused, and therefore is not evidence, I think, of a conspiracy. I
</p>
<p>therefore object to it in the first place as an act of Booth to which
</p>
<p>the defendant is nut a party at all. Ue could not help recoivin.^ a
</p>
<p>letter from Booth. The act of receiving a letter was an entirely in-
</p>
<p>nocent one. I object furthermore, that, even if it tends to show
</p>
<p>intimacy, it does not tend to prove the guilt of the party of the
</p>
<p>charge now made against him.
</p>
<p>_ The Judge xicvocAiE. We have established that intimacy clearly
</p>
<p>m their association in Washington. We are .simply following them
</p>
<p>to Baltimore, and showing that there they were in correspondence
</p>
<p>with each other. It is a fact of the same order ; and, althouMi it may
</p>
<p>not have the same force with the other fact, its tendency certainly is
</p>
<p>m the same du-ection. Wo do not offer the contents of the letter.
</p>
<p>We offer the fact of their correspondence with each other.
</p>
<p>The Court overruled the objection.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cox :
</p>
<p>Q. I did not understand you to state when that note was
</p>
<p>carried.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not know when it was cai-ried. I did not think
</p>
<p>any thing about it.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not recollect the date ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sii- : it was in March, I am pretty sure.
</p>
<p>Q. You are sure it was in March last ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

</p>
<p>Q. What makes you certain of that?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was that time, because I heard Tom Johnson  I
</p>
<p>had never taken much notice of the months -he said it was in
</p>
<p>March ; but I do not know what.

</p>
<p>Q. ^Miat another person told you will not do. Is there nothing
</p>
<p>that you recollect that fixes it in your mind certainly 1
</p>
<p>A. I am almost sure it was in Jlartli.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it in the beginning, or late in the month ?
</p>
<p>A. It was in the middle, I think, or nearly the last, because I
</p>
<p>had something to get for customers ; and it put me back in my
</p>
<p>business, and I could get nothing. It was cold then.
</p>
<p>Q. You said Uooth gave you this note at the door of Barnum's
</p>
<p>Hotel in Baltimore ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I was coming along; and, just as I was coming up
</p>
<p>about to the saloon underneath Bai-num's, he a.sked me to carry the
</p>
<p>letter. I told him that I could not do it ; that I had to go to
</p>
<p>the country. He said it would take me no time, and I carried
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Q. You took them where ?
</p>
<p>A. One in Fayette Street ; but I did not know the number, for
</p>
<p>I had to look for it.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that the house of O'Laughlin?
</p>
<p>A. That was up town. The other was in Old Town that I had
</p>

<p>anived there ?
</p>
<p>A. After arriving in Baltimore, we went down Baltimore Street,
</p>
<p>and up as far as High Street, and down High Street to the comer
</p>
<p>of Fayette ; whore I asked him to walk down as far a.s the store with
</p>
<p>me, to let them know that I had an-ived in town again. From there
</p>
<p>he asked me if I would not go over as far as a Sir. Iloifmann's house
</p>
<p>to see his wife. IMr. Hoffmann was lying sick in Washington here
</p>
<p>at the time with rliouraatism. Wc wont over as for as HofTmann's
</p>
<p>wife's house, and saw her. Jfr. O'Laughlin had some communica-
</p>
<p>tion to make to her from her husband, who was lying here sick.
</p>
<p>Then we came down, and wont to Blr. O'Laughlin's house. He
</p>
<p>asked mc if I would walk that far. In going down to his house, we
</p>
<p>met his brother-in-law on the way ; and he walked along with us.
</p>
<p>He told Sir. O'Laughlin that there had been parties there that
</p>
<p>morning looking for him. Sir. O'Laughlin went into the house,
</p>
<p>and asked me if I would remain there, and then came out and
</p>
<p>invited me to come in. I went in, and sat in the parlor while he
</p>
<p>went up stairs to see his mother : he rcuiained a few minutes, and
</p>
<p>then came down, and said he was not going to stay-home that night.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he manifest much excitement about the assassination of
</p>
<p>the President 1
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say as he did. He did not appear to be anyways
</p>
<p>excited much to mo, only wlion he heard there were parties after hiin ;
</p>
<p>and his brothor-in-law, I suppose it was, made the remark that they
</p>
<p>were after him because of his known intimacy with Booth, having
</p>
<p>been acquainted with him, and boon in the habit of going with liim,

</p>
<p>Q. Mr. O'Laughlin went up stairs to sec Iiim ?
</p>
<p>A. He wont up stairs, and I went to the rear of the buildin"- :
</p>
<p>at least, I was told that he went up stairs ; I did not see him go up.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know whether he actually saw Booth or not?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. But in about an hour's time, I think you stated, he rejoined
</p>
<p>you at the Liehau House 'I
</p>
<p>A. We remained in the hotel  ]Mr. Henderson and myself 
</p>
<p>for, I should say, three-quarters of an hour, waiting for him, and
</p>
<p>thought he was up stairs ; and, not coming down, Henderson con-
</p>
<p>cluded to go out. As he went out, he had some cards wi-itten by
</p>
<p>the card-wi;iter there, and said he would call for them in about ten
</p>
<p>minutes. We then went out, and walked down the avenue as far,
</p>
<p>I think, as this Liehau House, to see if Mike  Mr. O'Laugb'in 
</p>
<p>had been down there ; and, he not being there, we returned back,
</p>
<p>and got the cards ; and the card-writer asked mo what was his name,
</p>
<p>and wrote me a sample card at the same time, and wrote it wong,
</p>
<p>and afterwards corrected it. Mr. Murphy, in the mean time, had
</p>
<p>joined us on the avenue ; and I forgot who it was that proposed to
</p>
<p>send cards up to Mr. Booth's room for Sir. O'Laughlin, so that, if
</p>
<p>he was in there, ho might take it as a liint to come down, that we
</p>
<p>were tired of waiting. The cai-ds were returned down, that there
</p>
<p>was nobody in the room.
</p>
<p>Q. Where were the cards put then ? Were thoy loft at the
</p>
<p>bar?
</p>
<p>A. They were left at the bar.
</p>
<p>Q. Or at the clerk's office ?
</p>
<p>A. At the desk of the clerk.
</p>
<p>Q. And, in about an hour's time, ho rejoined you at the Liehau
</p>
<p>House ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long during that day was ho in your company ?

<p>between twelve and two o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where Wall and Stephens's dry-goods and
</p>
<p>clothing store is ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it over that store that you dined ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say that it was. I think it was farther up on the
</p>
<p>avenue. I have seen it several times ; but I never took notice of
</p>
<p>what store it was over.
</p>
<p>Q. You dined at two o'clock. At what time did you get through
</p>
<p>dinner ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think it took over an hour, getting it ready and
</p>
<p>so on.
</p>
<p>Q. That would bo about three o'clock ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think, maybe, wc got througli dinner and all be-
</p>
<p>tween those two hours. I could not say correctly.
</p>
<p>Q. After dinner, where did you go ?
</p>
<p>A. We went around the town again to different places.

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I cannot say that we went to any particular place.
</p>
<p>Q. Was O'Laughlin with you during all the time ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say whether O'Laughlin was with mo later; that
</p>
<p>is, after dinner. We hart boon drinking pretty freely all uf us ; but
</p>
<p>I recollect, between four and five o'clock I should think it was,
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin went with mo to a friend's house of mine.
</p>
<p>Q. To pay a visit ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I was not acquainted in town very well, and did

<p>with me to help to find a place.

</p>
<p>ond dinner ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say positively as to that. He might have been in

<p>company with us; but I think we separated; that is, O'LaughUn
</p>
<p>and Henderson went one way, or me and Jlichael went together :
</p>
<p>I cannot say which.
</p>
<p>Q. You arc not certain whether O'Laughlin went with you or
</p>
<p>Henderson ?

</p>
<p>about four o'clock, and went to this lady's house.
</p>
<p>Q. At six o'clock, where did you go ?
</p>
<p>A. We took the cars : the place was down near the depot ; but
</p>
<p>we went out the other side of the town to hunt it, and found that
</p>
<p>the numbers ran down that way.
</p>
<p>Q. It was on D Street, near the Baltimore Depot, where you
</p>
<p>paid the visit ?

</p>
<p>found there by iMurphy and Henderson.
</p>
<p>Q. How late were you there 'I
</p>
<p>A. We staid there around that place until about seven or eight
</p>
<p>o'clock, I guess; when we went back to Welch's, and had supper.
</p>
<p>I know that we were in Welch's at the time the procession passed
</p>
<p>up the avenue of Navy- Yard men. I do not boUcve Mr. Murphy
</p>
<p>went up to supper : I think O'Laughlin, Henderson, and I went
</p>
<p>and had supper.

<p>During this visit, state what his conduct was.
</p>
<p>A. His conduct was the same as I usually saw him,  jovial
</p>
<p>and jolly as any of the rest of the crowd.
</p>
<p>Q. In good spirits ?
</p>
<p>160 Tiin rniAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : lie was particularly so coming down in the cars
</p>
<p>with us that Thursday evening.
</p>
<p>Q. No nervousness ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. I will ask you wheth6r you were anywhere near Willard's
</p>
<p>Hotel during Friday or Friday evening ? Did you go as far up
</p>
<p>town as that ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect passing there.
</p>
<p>Q. Wliat induced you to stay later than Friday afternoon ?
</p>
<p>A. I guess it was the lir[Uor we had alioard.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Lieutenant Henderson press you all to stay ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate BiNC.nAM objected to the question,
</p>
<p>as an attempt to bring in the declaration of a third party.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox stated that he proposed to show not merely the declara-
</p>
<p>tion of a third party, but the action of the accused, and those who
</p>
<p>were with hkn, based on those declarations.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. You have stated that probably the liquor that you drank
</p>
<p>kept you down here in Wasliington. I will ask you if any thing
</p>
<p>else kept you here ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say that there was any thing else.
</p>
<p>Q. State what time in the morning you went up to Baltimore.
</p>
<p>A. We did start to go in the morning train, at eleven o'clock, I
</p>
<p>believe, on Saturday morning. We went as fiir as the depot, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson went and got the tickets : but Jlr. Henderson
</p>
<p>finally concluded that he thought he would stay over until the
</p>
<p>afternoon ; but, if we all pressed on him going up. he would go.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Lauchlin was wanting to go up ; and I told Jlr. Hender-
</p>
<p>son, " If you press on Mike's staying, he will stay until the after-
</p>
<p>noon." So we all concluded to stay until the next train, at three
</p>
<p>o'clock in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>Q. And then you went up at three o'clock in the afternoon ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>THE TRIAL. 161
</p>
<p>Q. And then you went to his house, and he went up stairs, you
</p>
<p>supposed, to see his mother ; and, on returning, ho said ho would
</p>
<p>not stay at homo that night ? Did he tell you why ?
</p>
<p>A. The remark ho made was, that he would not like to be ax-
</p>
<p>rcsted in the house ; that it would be the death of his mother.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you part with hiin ?
</p>
<p>A. His brother-in-law went along with us up as far as the comer
</p>
<p>of Fayette and Exeter Streets ; and we stopped there, and had a
</p>
<p>conversation. I told Mr. O'Laughlin that I thought it best for him
</p>
<p>to stay home until the parties who were looking after him would
</p>
<p>come again ; but he said, " No : it would be the death of his mother
</p>
<p>if he was taken in the house." So then he asked me to go up town
</p>
<p>with him ; and we went up as far as the corner of Calvert and
</p>
<p>Fayette Sti-eets, at Bamum's Hotel there, where he got a hack,
</p>
<p>and we drove up town in it. I accompanied him as far as sorao
</p>
<p>street up town,  I do not recoUect the street,  where he got
</p>
<p>out, and I returned home.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :

<p>Metropolitan Hotel on Thursday night, the 13th of April 1

</p>
<p>Q. At what hour ?

</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean one or two o'clock on Friday morning ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is the time we went to bod.
</p>
<p>Q. Where had he been daring the previous part of the night ?
</p>
<p>A. After having supped, we went up to see the illuminations :
</p>
<p>we went a considerable piece up the avenue ; returned back ; and,
</p>
<p>on the invitation of Mr. Henderson, wo went into the Canterbury
</p>
<p>Music Hall.

</p>
<p>A. I did.

</p>
<p>speaker of the party, and the third party was the attentive listener.

<p>164 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>I addressed O'Laugblin first, Laving kuown Lim more familiarly
</p>
<p>than Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Did tliey suspend the conference while you were present ?
</p>
<p>A. O'Laugblin called me to one side, and told me Booth was
</p>
<p>busily engaged with his friend, or was talking privately.
</p>
<p>Q. "Was the tone very low ?
</p>
<p>A. It was.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen that person since ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you give a description of him ?
</p>
<p>A. I should judge he was a man about my own height ; and his
</p>
<p>hair, if I remember coiTCctly, was a kind of curly : he had on at the
</p>
<p>time a slouch hat, and was in a stooping position, as though talking
</p>
<p>to Booth in a low tone, or very attentively listening to Booth's con-
</p>
<p>versation. I thought it ill manners to put my ear towards them, and
</p>
<p>pay any further attention to them.
</p>
<p>Q. Is he one of these persons ?
</p>
<p>A. In the present dress of the prisoners, I would not swear
</p>
<p>against a man's life. I do not recognize the man here.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you an opinion that either of them is the man ?
</p>
<p>A. I feel it my duty to detect the man ; but it is a delicate
</p>
<p>question,  a man's life,  let him be who he may. [After look-
</p>
<p>ing at the prisoners.] No, sir : I wiU not swear that the man is
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Q. I am not sure whether you are the person. It is a person of
</p>
<p>your name, I behevc, who is reported to have seen Booth and Her-
</p>
<p>old on the night after the assassination. Are you the person 1
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not know the man Herold. I saw Booth but
</p>
<p>once afterwards.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by ]Mr. Co.k :
</p>
<p>Q. You say you saw this conference between Booth and 0'-

<p>where it was on the avenue.

</p>
<p>Q. You cannot speak with any certainty about the date, except
</p>
<p>that you think it was nigh on to April ?

<p>A. If I had the assistance of the passes I obtained since I was

<p>at Camp Stonemau, I could toll you exactly : I canhot state posi-
</p>
<p>tively the date.
</p>
<p>Q. Did I understand you to say that O'Laughlin made a remark
</p>
<p>about Booth being engaged with hLs friend ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho did : he called mo aside, and said they were engan-ed in
</p>
<p>conversation.
</p>
<p>Q. In making that remark, did you not ask him to propose to
</p>
<p>Mr. Booth to take a di-ink ? and did he not reply, that Booth was
</p>
<p>busy with his friend 1
</p>
<p>A. I may have done so.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think, on reflection, that you did ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not anyways stingy. I presume I may have done so.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not that which induced the remark, that Booth was
</p>
<p>engaged with a friend ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see the interior of Mr. O'Lauglilin's mind.
</p>
<p>I cannot tell.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not that remark of his an answer to your invitation to
</p>
<p>him to ask Mr. Booth to take a drlidi V
</p>
<p>A. According to the art of language, it may have been. I can-
</p>
<p>not tell what the remai-k was made for.

<p>THE TRIAL. 171
</p>
<p>at liis fatlier's house : I had seen him out guuiiiiig. He gi-ew

</p>
<p>on the 14th of April?

</p>
<p>been a trotting-race or something of that kind across the river.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you describe his appearance?
</p>
<p>A. I will as near as I can. He was a light-complected man,
</p>
<p>with rather singular colored hair : it is not red ; it is not white ;
</p>
<p>it is a kind of sandy ; and it was cut rounded, so as to He down low
</p>
<p>on his collar, and a little heavy.

</p>
<p>be that.

</p>
<p>A. That I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Q. What is the shape of bis forehead ?
</p>
<p>A. That could not be seen ; and I do not know, because he had
</p>
<p>a hat on, and I was not picking him out particularly-: I was only
</p>
<p>looking at him as ho passed, admiring the style of his clothes, and
</p>
<p>my attention was taken to his spur. His pantaloons were a httle
</p>
<p>short, and the tremendous size of the rowel that was in the spur
</p>
<p>attracted my attention.
</p>
<p>Q. You observed the rowel and the clothes that were passing
</p>
<p>more than you did the man's face V
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say that I dwelt on his face at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Dow large a man is Surratt'? I do not mean his height

<p>now.

</p>
<p>o'clock that Jay. Ho luid been in tlie habit of riding a sorrel liorse,
</p>
<p>and he came to get it ; but that horse was engaged, and I could not
</p>
<p>let him have i(.
</p>
<p>(j. What kind of a hort^e did you lot him have ?
</p>
<p>A. A small bay mai'C, about fourteen or fourteen and a half
</p>
<p>hands high.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did he obtain that mare?
</p>
<p>A. About four or half-past four o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the mare returned to you?
</p>
<p>A. I have never seen her since.
</p>
<p>Q. What description would you give of her besides that you have
</p>
<p>mentioned? Was there any thing peculiar about her mane and
</p>
<p>tail?
</p>
<p>A. She was a little rubbed behind. She was a mare that I should
</p>
<p>call about fourteen or fourteen and a half hands high, as well as I
</p>
<p>can remember ; blood, bay, black legs, black mane and tail. I think
</p>
<p>the off front foot had white spots : you could not call it a white leg.
</p>
<p>She had a star in the forehead.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he in the habit of hiring horses there ?
</p>
<p>A. About a month or six weeks before the assassination of the
</p>
<p>President, ho called at my stable, and said he wanted a saddle-horse.
</p>
<p>He was then in company with young Surratt.
</p>
<p>Q. John H. Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. I think that is his name : they called him " John." Booth
</p>
<p>asked for the proprietor : I told him I was the man. lie said he
</p>
<p>wanted a good saddle-horse. Said I, " I am your man : I can let
</p>
<p>you have him."  " Have you a good one ? " he asked ; and I said,
</p>
<p>"Yes." He said, "I should like to have him : I want to take a
</p>
<p>ride." Said I, "Before you get him, you will have to give me
</p>
<p>reference, or security : you are a stranger to me." He said to me,
</p>
<p>" If you don't know me, you have heard of me : I am J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth." Said I, " If you are J. Wilkes Booth, I will let you have
</p>
<p>a horse ; but I don't know whether you are J. Wilkes Booth or not

<p>yet." Mr. Surratt s[)oke up, and said, "This is 3Ir. J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, Mr. Pumphreys : he and I are going to take a little ride ;
</p>
<p>and I will see to it that you are paid for the horse." I let him have

<p>the horse : the price was paid.

<p>THE TRIAL. 175
</p>
<p>Q. WLen was that ?
</p>
<p>A. It was a month or six weeks before the assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the photograph of J. Willies Booth,
</p>
<p>Exhibit No. 1.] Look at that photograph, and see if you recognize
</p>
<p>it as J. Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>A. That is thcL man.
</p>
<p>Q. On that Friday, did he ask for any thing besides the horse and
</p>
<p>saddle ? Did he ask for any thing to hitch or tie the horse ?
</p>
<p>A. On the Friday that he came in the afternoon for the saddle-
</p>
<p>horse, he asked me to give him a tie-rein to hitch the horse ; and I
</p>
<p>told him not to hitch the horse, as she was in the habit of breaking
</p>
<p>the bridle. A gentleman had had her a day or two before ; and he
</p>
<p>had hitched her, and she broke the bridle. I told him that ; and be
</p>
<p>said that he wanted to tie bcr while he siopped at a restaurant and
</p>
<p>got a drink. '" Well/' said I, " get a bo}' at the restaurant to hold
</p>
<p>her." He said he could not get a boy. " Oh," said I, " you can
</p>
<p>find plenty of boot-black boys about the street to hold your horse."
</p>
<p>Then said he, "I am going to Grover's Theatre to write a letter ;
</p>
<p>and there is no necessity of tying her there ; for there is a stable in
</p>
<p>the back part of the alley, and I will put her there." Then he
</p>
<p>asked me where was the best place to take a ride to. I told him,
</p>
<p>" You have been some time around here, and you ought to know."
</p>
<p>He asked, " How is Crystal Spring?" I said, "A very good place ;
</p>
<p>but it is rather early for that."  " Well," said he, "I will go there
</p>
<p>after I get through writing a letter at Grover's Theatre." He left
</p>
<p>o o r>
</p>
<p>then, riding off on the mare ; and I have never seen Booth since.

<p>high ; sandy hair, and a very light goatee I think he wore ; his eyes

</p>
<p>A. I think he had on a gray suit : I am not certain as to the

</p>
<p>called for some water. I did not give him water right off: it is
</p>
<p>customary to give water, but I did not give him water right off;
</p>
<p>and he called for some water, and I gave him some water. He put
</p>
<p>the money on the counter, and went right out.
</p>

</p>
<p>Sergeant Joseph M. Dfe,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being dnily sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, on the evening of the 14th of April
</p>
<p>last, you were in front of Ford's Theatre, and at what hour you
</p>
<p>were there.
</p>
<p>A. I was sitting in front of Ford's Theatre about half-past nine
</p>
<p>o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you observe several persons, whose appearance excited
</p>
<p>your suspicions, conferring together upon the pavement in front of
</p>
<p>the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Describe their appearance, and what they did.
</p>
<p>A. The first appearance was an elegantly dressed gentleman, who
</p>
<p>came out of the passage, and commenced conversing with a ruffianly-
</p>
<p>looking fellow. Then there was another one appeared, and the
</p>
<p>three conversed together. After they -had conversed together, it
</p>
<p>was drawing near the second act. The one that appeared to be the
</p>
<p>leader of them, the well-dressed one, said, " I think he will come
</p>
<p>out now J " referring to the President, I supposed.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the President's carriage standing there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. One of them had been standing out, lookijig at
</p>
<p>the carriage on the curbstone, while I was sitting there, and then
</p>
<p>went back. They watched a while, and the rush came down : many
</p>
<p>gentlemen came out, and went in and had a drink in the saloon bo-
</p>
<p>low. Then, after they went up, the best-dressed gentleman stepped
</p>
<p>into the saloon himself, remained there long enough to get a drink,
</p>
<p>and came out in a style as if he was becoming intoxicated. He
</p>
<p>stejiped up and whispered to this ruffian (that is, the miscrablest-
</p>
<p>looking one of the three), and stepped into the passage,  tlio pas-
</p>
<p>sage that leads to the stage there from the street, Then the small-
</p>
<p>est one stepped up and called the time, just as the best-dressed

<p>gentleman appeared again, from the clock in the vestibule. Tlien
</p>
<p>he stMted up the street and remained there a while, and came down
</p>
<p>again, and called the time again. Then I began to think there
</p>
<p>VOL. I. 16
</p>
<p>182 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>was something going on, and looked towards this man as he called
</p>
<p>the time. Presently he went up again, and came down then, and
</p>
<p>called the time again. Then I began to think there was something
</p>
<p>going on, and looked towards the man as he culled the time. Pres-
</p>
<p>ently he went up again, and then came down and called the time
</p>
<p>louder. I think it was ten minutes after ten that he called out then.
</p>
<p>Q. Was ho announcing it to the other two ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : then he started on a fast walk up the .street ; and
</p>
<p>the best-dressed one among them started into the theatre, and went
</p>
<p>inside. I was invited by Sergeant Cooper to have some oysters ; and
</p>
<p>we had barely time to get in the saloon and get seated, and order
</p>
<p>the oysters, when a man came running in, and said the President
</p>
<p>was shot.
</p>
<p>Q. Would you recognize that well-dressed person from his photo-
</p>
<p>gi'aph if you were to see it now ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting Booth's photograph. Exhibit No. 1.] Look at
</p>
<p>that photograph.
</p>
<p>A. That was the man ; but his mustache was heavier and his
</p>
<p>hair longer than in this picture.
</p>
<p>Q. But do you recognize the features \
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : this is the man ; these are his features exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. What restaurant did that man go into to drink ?
</p>
<p>A. The restaurant just below the theatre, towards the avenue.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he go in alone ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he went in alone.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you give a more particular description of the ruffianly-
</p>
<p>looking man whom you saw V What was his size ? and what was
</p>
<p>it that gave him such a ruffianly appearance '' Was it his
</p>
<p>dress?
</p>
<p>A. He was not as well dressed as the rest of them.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he shabbily dressed or dirtily dressed ?
</p>
<p>A. His clothes had been worn a considerable time ; and he had

</p>
<p>a bloated appearance.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he a stout man 1
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and a rough face.
</p>
<p>Q. Which way did he go ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 183
</p>
<p>A. He remained there at the passage, and the other one started
</p>
<p>up the street.
</p>
<p>Q. The time was announced to the other two men three times by
</p>
<p>him, was it '?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : three times.
</p>
<p>Q. The last, you think, was ten minutes after ten ?
</p>
<p>A. The last time he called out was ten minutes after ten.
</p>
<p>Q. Immediately on announcing that, did Booth leave, and go
</p>
<p>into the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho whispered to the ruifian, and started in.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at these prisoners, and see whether you recognize any of
</p>
<p>them as either of the persons present on that occasion.
</p>
<p>A. If that man [pointing to Edward Spangler] had a mustache,
</p>
<p>it would be just the appearance of the face exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean that the rough-looking man was like him, ex-
</p>
<p>cept that he had a mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes. sir. He was standing at the entrance of the passage ;
</p>
<p>but I think he had a mustache,  a heavy one. It was rather dark
</p>
<p>back there : the gas-light did not shine very much on it ; but I saw
</p>
<p>the mustache.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to state that the call was made from the
</p>
<p>clock in the hall of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Ho stepped up there, and called the time right in
</p>
<p>front of the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you tell at what time the other calls were made ? You
</p>
<p>have stated that the last was at ten minutes past ten.
</p>
<p>A. They were all between half-past nine and ten minutes after
</p>
<p>ten.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you could recognize either of the other per-
</p>
<p>sons ?
</p>
<p>A. The one that called the time was a very neat gentleman, well
</p>
<p>dressed ; and ho had a mustache.

</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not you saw hiui on the evening of
</p>
<p>the 14th of April, at what hour, and what occuiTcd in connection
</p>
<p>with it?
</p>
<p>A. I should judge it was about ten o'clock that he came there to
</p>
<p>the theatre, walked in, and walked out again ; and he returned, I
</p>
<p>judge, in about two or three minutes. He came to mc, and asked mo
</p>
<p>what time it was. I told him to step into the lobby that leads out
</p>
<p>into the street, and he could soe. He stepped out, and walked in
</p>
<p>again, and stepped into the door that leads to the parquette and dress-
</p>
<p>cu'cle, and returned immediately ; came out, and went up the stair-
</p>
<p>way to the dress-circle. The last I saw of him was, he alighted on
</p>
<p>the stage from the box, running across the stage with a knife in his
</p>
<p>hand. He was uttering some sentence ; but I could not understand
</p>
<p>it well at the time : I was too far back from him, at the front door.
</p>
<p>Q. lie went into the President's box, did he ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not say.
</p>
<p>Q. He was on that side of the dress-circle ?
</p>
<p>A. I was down below, underneath. The dress-circle extends
</p>
<p>over my doorway, so that I could not see.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mb. Ewinq :
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner, Edward Spangler ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; knowing him at the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. You have known him ?
</p>
<p>A. I have known him to bo there at the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him enter or come out of the front of the theatre
</p>
<p>during the play ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. State the position of your box. Is it that you would be likely
</p>
<p>to see any persons who entered from the front of the theatre '!
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : every person has to pass me on entering the thea-
</p>
<p>tre ; that is, in the lower part, for the parquette, dress-circle, and

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>Q. If this man Spangler had gone in from the street, entering at
</p>
<p>the front of the theatre, would you have seen him ?
</p>

<p>Q. Would you have been pretty sure to see him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he could not have passed me without my seeing
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you eertain he did not pass, then?
</p>
<p>A. I am perfectly satisfied that he was not in the front part of

<p>A. Not to my recollection.

<p>horse,  a small bay mare. Mr. Maddox was standing aside of
</p>
<p>him, with his hand on the horse's mane, talking. I stood on the
</p>
<p>190 TItE TIllAL.
</p>
<p>porch a minute; and Booth looked round, and said, "See what
</p>
<p>a nice horse I have got!" As I stepped out near hira, he said,
</p>
<p>" Now, watch : he can run justliiie a cat ! " and struck liis spurs into
</p>
<p>the horse, and off lio went down the street. I did not see him any
</p>
<p>more until that night,  somewhere near ten o'clock, I should think.
</p>
<p>Along in the afternoon, ahout one o'clock, Hany Ford came into my
</p>
<p>place, and said to me, "Your favorite, General Grant, is going to be
</p>
<p>in the theatre to-night ; and, if you want to see him, you iiad better go
</p>
<p>and get a seat." I wont and secured a seat directly opposite the
</p>
<p>President's bos, in the front of the dress-circle. He showed me the
</p>
<p>box that he said the President was to be in ; and I got those seats
</p>
<p>directly opposite. I saw the President and his family when they
</p>
<p>came in, and some gentlemen in plain clothes with thera. I did not
</p>
<p>recognize him ; but I knew from the appearance of the man that it
</p>
<p>was not Grant. I supposed that probably Grant had remained out-
</p>
<p>side, so as not to create any excitement in the theatre, and would
</p>
<p>come in alone, and* come in the box ; and I made up my mind that I
</p>
<p>would see him before he went in ; and I watched every one that
</p>
<p>passed around on that side of the dres.'^-circle towards this box.
</p>
<p>Somewhere near ten o'clock, I should think it was (it was tlio
</p>
<p>second scene in the third act of the play they were playing, " Our
</p>
<p>American Cousin "), I saw Booth pass along near the box, and then
</p>
<p>stop, and lean against the wall. lie stood there a moment. Some-
</p>
<p>thing dii-ected my attention on the stage ; and I looked back and saw
</p>
<p>him step down one step, put his hands to the door, and his knee
</p>
<p>against it, and push the door open,  the first door that goes into the
</p>
<p>box. I did not see any more of him until I saw him make a rush
</p>
<p>for the railings that ran around the box, to jump over. I saw him
</p>
<p>put his left hand on the railing, and he seemed to strike back with
</p>
<p>the right with a knife. I could see the knife gleam, and that mo-
</p>
<p>ment ho was over the box. The President sat in the left-hand cor-
</p>
<p>ner of the box, and Miss Harris in the right-hand corner. Mrs.
</p>
<p>Lincoln sat to the riglit of the President, as I am sitting hero. Then

<p>the "-entleraan iu citizen's clothes, whom I learned afterwards was
</p>
<p>Major Rathbone, sat back almost in the corner of the box. The
</p>
<p>President, at the time he was shot, was sitting in this position: he
</p>
<p>was leaning his hand on the rail, and was looking down at a person

</p>
<p>in (lie orchestra,  not looking on the stage. He had the flag that
</p>
<p>decorated the box pulled around, and was looking between the post
</p>
<p>and the flag. As the person lit on the stage, just as he jumped
</p>
<p>over, I saw it was Booth. I saw the flash of the pistol back right
</p>
<p>in the box. As he struck on the stage, he rose and exclaimed,
</p>
<p>"Sic semper tyrannis ! " and ran right directly across the stage to
</p>
<p>the opposite door, where the actors come in. I did not see any
</p>
<p>thing more of him that evening. I got out as quick as I could. I
</p>
<p>had a little girl with me, who lived on E Street. As I understood
</p>
<p>General Grant was to be at the theatre that night, I took her with
</p>
<p>me to see him. I got her home as quick as I could, and then ran
</p>
<p>down Ninth Street to D, and through D to the police station ; went
</p>
<p>up stau-s, and told the Superintendent of Police, Mr. Webb. I then
</p>
<p>ran up Tenth Street to the house where the President was. Some
</p>
<p>one told mo that General Augur was up there, or Colonel Wells.
</p>
<p>Colonel Wells was standing out on the step of Mr. Peterson's house.
</p>
<p>I told him I had seen it all, and knew the man that jumped out of
</p>
<p>the box. He told the guard to pass mo through ; and I went in and
</p>
<p>stated it to him. I then went over the street, and went to bod. In
</p>
<p>the morning, when I got up, I saw Mr. Gifford ; and he said to me,
</p>
<p>" You made a hell of a statement about what you saw last night.
</p>
<p>How could you see the flash of the jjistol, when the ball was shot
</p>
<p>through the door? " I said to him, " Mr. GiflTord, that pistol never
</p>
<p>exploded in any place but in the box : I saw the flash." Said he,
</p>
<p>" Oh, hell ! the ball was shot tlirough the door ; and how could you
</p>
<p>see it?" I studied about it all day. On Sunday morning. Miss
</p>
<p>Harris came down, and her father. Senator Harris, and Judge Oliii
</p>
<p>and Judge Cartter ; and I went into the theatre with them. We had
</p>
<p>a great deal of difficulty in getting the theatre open. Maddox and
</p>
<p>GiflTord were in the theatre, but would not open the door. I sent a
</p>
<p>young man through my back way, and he broke a window in ; and
</p>
<p>then IMaddox came to the front door, opened the theatre, and let us in.
</p>
<p>We got a candle and examined this hole, where Mr. Gifford said the

</p>
<p>ball was shot through. It looked to me like as if it had been bored
</p>
<p>by a small gimlet, and then cut around the edge with ft knife ; and
</p>
<p>in several places it was scratched down as if with a knife. This
</p>
<p>thing had bothered me all night on Saturday night ; and, after this
</p>
<p>192 THE TUIAL.
</p>
<p>examination, I was satislioJ that I saw the flash of the pistol. Mr.
</p>
<p>Gifford's accusing me of making tliis statement bothered me all night.
</p>
<p>I saw him on Monda}', and said to him, " Mr. Giffiird, you are a
</p>
<p>very smart man ! You know that ball was not shot tlirough the
</p>
<p>board." Said be, "I have understood since that it was cut
</p>
<p>through." Said I, " Did you not know it was cut through ? " Said
</p>
<p>ho, " No : how did I know any thing about it? " and walked away,
</p>
<p>and left me.
</p>
<p>Q. Is Giflford the chief carpenter of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he had charge of the theatre altogether. He was
</p>
<p>chief carpenter, and then he had the management of the theatre :
</p>
<p>he bad full charge of it; at least, I always understood so. I
</p>
<p>recollect, that, when Richmond was surrendered, I mentioned to him,
</p>
<p>"Have you not got any flags in the theatre?" He said to me,
</p>
<p>" I'es, I have : I guess there is a flag about." I said to him,
</p>
<p>" Why do you not run it out on that roof?" and he said, " There is
</p>
<p>a rope : is not that enough ? " Said I, " You are a hell of a man :
</p>
<p>you ought to be in the old Capitol," and walked away, and left him.
</p>
<p>He did not like me anyhow.
</p>
<p>Q. The President's box was on the south side of the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he always had that box every time I ever saw him
</p>
<p>at the theatre.
</p>
<p>i\. Did you hoar any other exclamation besides " Sic semper
</p>
<p>tijrannis ' ' ?
</p>
<p>A. I heard some one halloo out of the box,  I do not know that
</p>
<p>it was him ; I suppose it was, though ; it must have boon, 
</p>
<p>" Reveno-e for the South ! " just as be was putting his foot over this
</p>
<p>railin"-. There was a post there, and the President was right in
</p>
<p>the corner ; and he jumped iu between the President and the post.
</p>
<p>Just as he went over the box, I saw the President raise his head ;
</p>
<p>and then it hung back, and I saw Mrs. Lincoln catch him on the
</p>
<p>arm. I was satisfied then that he was hurt. By that time. Booth
</p>
<p>was across the stage.

</p>
<p>Q. Did Booth's spm- catch in the flag?
</p>
<p>A. His spur caught in the flag that was stretched around the
</p>
<p>box. There was also a flag decorating this post. His spur caught
</p>
<p>in the blue part of it. I thought it waa a State flag at first, by tlie
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 193
</p>
<p>looks of it ; but I saw afterwards, when I examined it, that it was
</p>
<p>the blue part of the American flag. As he went over, his spur
</p>
<p>caught in the moukling that ran round the edge of the box, and
</p>
<p>also iu this flag, and tore a piece of the flag as he struck on the
</p>
<p>stage ; and it was dragged half-way across the stage on his spur.
</p>
<p>I saw that the spur was on his light heel.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you observe that hole closely, to see whether it had been
</p>
<p>freshly cut ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I could not tell. It looked as though it was just
</p>
<p>done. Miss Hams remarked that morning, " There is one thing I
</p>
<p>want to examine : I am satisfied there was a bar across the door
</p>
<p>when I jumped off my seat and called for assistance." We went
</p>
<p>and looked ; and there was a square hole cut in the wall, just big
</p>
<p>enough to let in a bar, and this ran across to the door. The door
</p>
<p>stands in a kind of an angle ; and, this bar being placed in the wall,
</p>
<p>the other end came against the door, and you could not open it.
</p>
<p>That had been I'ut with a penknife, as it looked to me. There was
</p>
<p>a scratch down the wall.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you observe the character of the spur at all ? or did
</p>
<p>he move too rapidly for that '?
</p>
<p>A. I could not observe that. The way I noticed the spur was,
</p>
<p>when I saw the flag pulled down, I watched to see what it was
</p>
<p>caught to as he went over the edge of the box.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not see him after he disappeared behind the scenes?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not see him afterwards. He ran right across
</p>
<p>the sta<^. I was up in the dress-circle, and he ran out the side
</p>
<p>door. A young man named Hawk was the only one on the stage
</p>
<p>at the time. As he wont over, he had the knife raised, the handle
</p>
<p>up, and the blade down.
</p>
<p>Q. He went out on the opposite corner of the stage from the
</p>
<p>President's box ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he ran right straight across the stage.

<p>Q. Do you know Edward Spangler, the prisoner at the bax?
</p>
<p>A. I know Mr. Spangler.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him that night ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect seeing him that night at all. I was in tho
</p>
<p>theatre all the night. I went in, I think, at about twenty minutes
</p>
<p>to eight o'clock. I wanted to be there before the party came there ;

<p>Q. Do you know him well 'i

<p>A. Yes, sir : he worked at the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see him wear a mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I ever did. I do not recollect ever seeing

<p>him wear a mustache. He never wore any mustache, I think, since
</p>
<p>I have been there.

<p>A. Yes, SU-.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you describe what you .saw on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. I was sitting in a chair in tlie aisle leading by the wall
</p>
<p>toward the door of the President's .box on the night of the murder,
</p>
<p>when a man came and disturbed me in my scat, causing me to push
</p>
<p>the chair forward to permit him to pass, and who then stopped about
</p>
<p>three feet from where I was sitting, and leisurely took a survey of the
</p>
<p>house. I looked at him, because ho happened to be in my line of
</p>
<p>sight. He took a small pack of visiting cards from his pocket ;
</p>
<p>and, selecting one and replacing the others, stood a second, perhaps,

</p>
<p>and close the door,  the door of the lobby leading to the box.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see liim after the pistol was fired ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I saw the body of a man descend from the front
</p>
<p>of the box towards the stage. He was hid from my sight for a
</p>
<p>moment by the heads of those who sat in the front row of the dress-
</p>
<p>circle : but in another moment he re-appeared, and strode across the
</p>
<p>stage towards the entrance on the other side ; and, as he passed, I
</p>
<p>saw the gloaming blade of a dagger in his right hand. He disap-
</p>
<p>peared behind the scenes in a moment, and I saw him no more.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a large weapon that he held in his hand ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. The blade I should suppose to be five or six
</p>
<p>inches in length, from the length of the gleam I saw.
</p>
<p>Q. You stated that that was Booth, as I understood you ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not say so.
</p>
<p>Q. I thought you said you knew him ?
</p>
<p>A. I do know him ; but I did not recognize that man as Booth,
</p>
<p>not having seen his face fully.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not see his face ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not fully.

<p>my residence at the comer of Fifteenth and H Streets, and joined
</p>
<p>the President and Mrs. Lincoln, and went with them, in their car-
</p>
<p>riage, to Ford's Theatre in Tenth Street. On reaching the theatre,

<p>when the pre.^ence of the President became known, the actors

</p>
<p>stoppetl playing; the band struck up "Hail to the Chief!" the
</p>
<p>audience rose, and received him with vociferous cheering. The
</p>
<p>party proceeded along in the rear of the dress-circle, and entered
</p>
<p>the box that had been set apart for their reception. On entering
</p>
<p>the box, there was a large ann-ehair that was placed nearest the
</p>
<p>audience, farthest from the stage, which the President took, and
</p>
<p>occupied during the whole of the evening, with one exception, when
</p>
<p>he got up and put on his coat, and returned and sat down again.
</p>
<p>When the second scene of the third act was being performed, and
</p>
<p>while I was intently observing the proceedings upon the stage,
</p>
<p>with my back towards the door. I hoard the discharge of a pistol
</p>
<p>behind me, and, looking round, saw, through the smoke, a man
</p>
<p>between the door and the President. At the same time, I heard
</p>
<p>him shout some word, which I thought was "Freedom!" I
</p>
<p>instantly sprang towards him, and seized him. He wrested himself
</p>
<p>fi-om my grasp, and made a violent thrust at my breast with a large
</p>
<p>knife. I parried the blow by striking it up, and received a wound
</p>
<p>several inches deep in my loft arm, between the elbow and the
</p>
<p>shoulder. The oritice of the wound was about an inch and a half
</p>
<p>in length, and extended upwards towards the shoulder several inches.
</p>
<p>The man rushed to the front of the box ; and I endeavored to seize
</p>
<p>him again, but only caught his clothes as he was leaping over the
</p>
<p>railing of the box. The clothes, as I believe, were torn in the
</p>
<p>attempt to seize him. As he went over upon the stage, I cried out
</p>
<p>with a loud voice, " Stop that man ! " I then turned to the Pres-
</p>
<p>ident. His position was not changed : liis head was slightly bent
</p>
<p>forward, and his eyes were closed. I saw that he was unconscious,
</p>
<p>and, supposing him mortally wounded, rushed to the door for the
</p>
<p>purpose of calling medical aid. On reaching the outer door of the
</p>
<p>passage-way, I found it barred by a heavy piece of plank, one end
</p>
<p>of whtch was secured in the wall, and the other resting against the
</p>
<p>door. It had been so securely fastened, that it required consider-
</p>
<p>able force to remove it. Tliis wedge or bar was about four feet

<p>from the floor. Persons upon the outside were beating against the
</p>
<p>door for the purpose of entering. I removed the bar, and the door
</p>
<p>was opened. Several persons who represented themselves as sur-
</p>
<p>geons were allowed to enter. I saw there Colonel Crawford, ai\d

</p>
<p>requested him to prevent othov persons from entering tlio box. I
</p>
<p>then returned to the box, and found the surgeons examining the
</p>
<p>President's person. " They hud not yet discovered the wound. As
</p>
<p>soon as it was discovered, it was determined to remove him from the
</p>
<p>theatre. He was carried out ; and T then proceeded to assist Mrs.
</p>
<p>Lincobi, who was intensely excited, to leave the theatre. On
</p>
<p>reaching the head of the stairs, I requested Jlajor Potter to aid me
</p>
<p>in assisting Mrs. Lincoln across the street to the house whore the
</p>
<p>President was being conveyed. The wound which I had received
</p>
<p>had been bleeding very profusely ; and on reaching the house, feel-
</p>
<p>ing very taint from the loss of lilood, I seated myself in the hall,
</p>
<p>and soon after ftiinted away, and was laid upon the floor. Upon
</p>
<p>the return of consciousness, I was taken to my residence. In a
</p>
<p>review of the transactiims, it is ray confident belief tbat tbe time
</p>
<p>which elapsed between the discharge of the pistol and the time when
</p>
<p>the assassin leaped from the box did not exceed thirty seconds.
</p>
<p>Neither jMrs. Lincoln nor Miss Harris had left their seats.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not know Booth yourself, did you 1
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you would recognize him from a photograph ?
</p>
<p>A. I should be unable to do so as being the man in that box. I
</p>
<p>myself have seen him on the stage some time since.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. What distance was the assassin from the President when you
</p>
<p>first saw him after hearing the report ?
</p>
<p>A. The distance from the door to where the President was sitting,
</p>
<p>to the best of my recollection, was about four or five feet ; and this
</p>
<p>man was standing between the door and the President.
</p>
<p>By the Judge AdvocatB :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you look at that knife [exhibiting a knife to the witness],
</p>
<p>and say if it appears to you to be such a one as he used ? I believe
</p>
<p>the blood is still on the blade.
</p>
<p>A. I think this knife might have made a wound similar to the
</p>
<p>gleam.

<p>Q. Did you notice how the blade was held in the hand of the

<p>assassin when he held it ?
</p>
<p>A. The blade was held in a horizontal position, I should thin'.c ;
</p>
<p>and the nature of the wound would indicate it. It came with a

<p>William M^iteers, Jdn.,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you belong to the orchestra of Ford's Theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you there on the night of the assassination of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State what you saw of him.
</p>
<p>A. I had some business on the stage with our stage-manager that
</p>
<p>ni^ht in regard to a national song that I had composed ; and I went
</p>
<p>to see in what costume they were going to sing it in, as it was the
</p>
<p>afterpiece. I went up on the stage and talked with the stage-mana-
</p>
<p>ger a little while ; and he told nic tliat they would sing it in the cos-
</p>
<p>tume they wore in the piece. After that was over, I went to return
</p>
<p>under the stage, where my orchestra was, and went very leisurely
</p>
<p>along ; and I heard the report of a pistol just as I was in the act of 
</p>
<p>goinu- under the stage. I stood with astonishmeut to think why they
</p>
<p>should fire a pistol off in " Our American Cousin," as I had never
</p>
<p>heard of such a thing before. As I turned around, I heard a confu-
</p>
<p>sion, and met this man [Booth] running towards me, with his head
</p>
<p>down. I stood completely pai-alyzed at the time. I did not know
</p>
<p>what was the matter. As he ran, I could not get out of his way ; so

<p>the third enU-ance down to the second. The scene saved nie. As
</p>
<p>I turned, I got a side-view of him ; and I saw it was John. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth. Ho then made a rush fertile door, and out lie went. After
</p>
<p>that was over, I returned on the stage ; and I heard then that
</p>
<p>the President was killed ; and I saw him in the box, apparently
</p>
<p>dead.
</p>
<p>Q. Which way did he go out of the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. Out of the baek door.
</p>
<p>Cross-exaniined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner Edward Spangler?
</p>
<p>A. I have known him over since I have been in the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him that night ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not recollect of seeing him that night. I only
</p>
<p>happened to go on the stage in that act that night to see the stage-
</p>
<p>manager, 5Ir. Wright.
</p>
<p>Q. Which side of the stage did you go on 1
</p>
<p>A. The right-hand side, facing the audience.
</p>
<p>Q. That was the side farthest from the President's box?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the position of this man Spangler? What place
</p>
<p>had he on the stage, if any ?
</p>
<p>A. His position ought to have been at the scene, if it should be
</p>
<p>chan"-ed, right in the centre of the stage. His business there is to
</p>
<p>change the scenes ; and he ought to have been there, either at the
</p>
<p>win", or right behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>Q. On which side ?
</p>
<p>A. I really do not know. There are two that shift the scenes ;
</p>
<p>but I do not know which position he had there.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know which side was his position ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether the passage through which Booth
</p>
<p> passed out of the door is obstructed generally.

</p>
<p>A. Sometimes there are a great many scenes there, so that you
</p>
<p>cannot pass. During some of the pieces while Mr. Forrest was
</p>
<p>there, there were a great many scenes put up against the wall, and
</p>
<p>generally there are a lot of tools lying close by this door ; but on that
</p>
<p>200 TUE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>night every thing seemed to bo clear. I met nobody there that night
</p>
<p>that I met John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. AVas there a necessity for many shiftings of the scenes in kho
</p>
<p>play that night ?
</p>
<p>A. There was a very long wait in that scene. I think it was
</p>
<p>the time Asa Trenchard was to meet Mary Jleredith, anil projjose to
</p>
<p>her. After he docs that, they both go off; and the scene changes
</p>
<p>there. I do not think it wanted many minutes until the scene
</p>
<p>changed.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a time in the scene, and such a scene, where the stage
</p>
<p>and that passage-way would probably, in the ordinary course of
</p>
<p>things, have born obstructed ?
</p>
<p>A. A little, by sonic of the scene-shifters. They might have
</p>
<p>been there, and the actors : some of them had to go on the next
</p>
<p>scene, which required their presence.
</p>
<p>Q. Where is the actors' room ?
</p>
<p>A. The actors' room is to the right, facing the audience as you
</p>
<p>go up the stairs ; the green-room is about two yards from the stage ;
</p>
<p>there is a wall partition that separated the stage and the green-room ;
</p>
<p>and then there is the stars' room, on the first floor ; and up stairs
</p>
<p>are the dressing-rooms for the actors.
</p>
<p>Q. The green-room is the place where the actors wait before going
</p>
<p>on the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : they are called from this room to prepare to go on
</p>
<p>the stage about five minutes or sometimes two minutes before they
</p>
<p>go on the stage ; and they sit down there and wait for the call-boy to
</p>
<p>call them and go on in the respective scenes.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Booth pass between the scenes and the green-room ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How wide is that passage between the scenes and the green-
</p>
<p>room?
</p>
<p>A. I should judge it to be about as wide as this railing (about
</p>
<p>four feet) . The door faces right on the stage. There is another

</p>
<p>scene that comes to separate it ; but this leaves the door from the
</p>
<p>scene. You look from the scenes to the dressing-room. Here is
</p>
<p>a scene, and there also ; and from here there is a prompter's desk,
</p>
<p>and this scene is open from the door that leads into the dressing-
</p>
<p>TBE TRIAL. 201
</p>
<p>room. Then there is an open space that leads right on to the stage,
</p>
<p>ami nothing to obstruct the passage.
</p>
<p>Q. I mean from the tloor out of which he passed ?
</p>
<p>A. It is not so large as the dressing-room door there ; and there
</p>
<p>are some scenes there that obstruct the passage for anybody. Where
</p>
<p>we go down under the stage, there is a little box made, where the
</p>
<p>carpenters put their tools on sometimes. You have to stoop as you go
</p>
<p>under to get to the orchestra, and there is only a little narrow pas-
</p>
<p>sage as you get out of this door. It is narrower, about two yards,
</p>
<p>liefore you get to the door than before.
</p>
<p>Q. And, in passing from where Booth leaped on the stage to where
</p>
<p>he made his exit, he would leave the green-room to the left?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. As he would pass between the scenes and the green-
</p>
<p>room ?
</p>
<p>A. No : he would pass the green-room door. There is a parti-
</p>
<p>tion that separates the green-room. You have to go in alwut two
</p>
<p>yards after leaving this door to get into the green-room ; and, when
</p>
<p>that is shut, the stage is all open.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see Spangler wear a mustache?
</p>
<p>A. No. I have seen him as ho appears now. I do not recol-
</p>
<p>lect ever seeing him wear a mustache.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have )-ou known him ?
</p>
<p>A. Ever since Ford's Theatre was opened. I played there when
</p>
<p>it first opened.
</p>
<p>Q. How long?
</p>
<p>A. That is going on two years now.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state if there is not a side way by which the theatre
</p>
<p>can bo entered without passing through the door ; passing between
</p>
<p>the saloon and the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of
</p>
<p>Q. Can not it be entered from the street in that way, going in

</p>
<p>the hack way ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of. There is only one little passage, where
</p>
<p>the actors and the orchestra get in, that leads out of the saloon.
</p>
<p>202 TBK TRIAL.
</p>
<p>There is a dnnr that leads into the saloon, and from this
</p>
<p>leads into the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. That is used by the actors and persons connected with the
</p>
<p>theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. It was used when tlie theatre first opened, so that
</p>
<p>the actors could go out, without being observed, to get a drinli
</p>
<p>sometimes. This little door leads into the bar-room.
</p>
<p>Q. Is there a passage-way from the rear of the theatre to the front
</p>
<p>without passing through that front door ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of.
</p>
<p>By the CocKT :
</p>
<p>Q. When you met Booth on the stage, as he was passing out,
</p>
<p>could you sec the door where he went out ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any door-keeper standing around there that you
</p>
<p>saw?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see one.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the door open?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think it was, because, as I turned round when I heard
</p>
<p>the report of the pistol (I was astonished that a pistol should be
</p>
<p>fired off in that place), I looked at the door, because the door was
</p>
<p>only a yard from me.
</p>
<p>Q. There was nothing to obstruct his passage out ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : nothing.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not tliat an unusual state of things?
</p>
<p>A. It seemed strange to me.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not unusual ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any check at the door? or was it open bo-
</p>
<p>fore?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. When he gave me the blow that knocked me down
</p>
<p>in the scene, and when I came to and got a side-view of him, it
</p>
<p>seemed to me that he made one plunge at the door; and, as soon as

<p>he made the plunge, he was out.
</p>
<p>Q. The door opens out?
</p>
<p>A. I think it opens inward on the stage.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 203
</p>
<p>Q. Was it your impression that the door was opened for him ? or
</p>
<p>did he open it himself ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not liuow.
</p>
<p>Q. What was your impression ?
</p>
<p>A. It seems to me I tried it myself, the day I went to rehearsal,
</p>
<p>to get a hold of the door, because it surprised me that he made
</p>
<p>a jump, and went out of the door.
</p>
<p>Q. There was no delay ; but he passed right out ?
</p>
<p>A. There was no delay. From the jump he made, ho went right
</p>
<p>out.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it your impression that some one assisted hun to get out
</p>
<p>by opening the door ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not say. I tried the door to see if the knob would
</p>
<p>come that way. I did not see anybody, only him, go out.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Do the scenes stand at this moment just as they were left at
</p>
<p>that time "? or have they been changed ?
</p>
<p>A. I really do not know.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say there was no way for any person getting out from
</p>
<p>the rear of the theatre, except out of the front entrance ?
</p>
<p>A. You have to come to the front, without you go to the alley,
</p>
<p>and come in the front.
</p>
<p>Brooke Stablek recalled.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court, whether, since you left here, you
</p>
<p>have been to the stable and examined that horse ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir,
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recognize that animal as the same horse ?
</p>
<p>A. It is the same  a one-eyed bay horse  that Atzerodt took
</p>
<p>away on the 31st of JIarch, and brought back again for sale some
</p>
<p>days afterwards. It is the same horse.

</p>
<p>came up there until the President was shot?
</p>
<p>A. From the time he brought the horse there until the President
</p>
<p>was shot, I think was about three-quarters of an hour. I saw Booth

<p>that time until the President was shot, I think, was throe-quarters
</p>
<p>of an hour.

<p>A. John Peanuts held him : he was lying on a bench holding
</p>
<p>the horse when I noticed him. I was at tho window pretty nearly
</p>
<p>all the time from the time Booth brought the horse until he went
</p>
<p>away. Every time I looked out the window, John Peanuts was
</p>
<p>lying on the bench, holding the horse. I did not see any one else
</p>
<p>hold him.

</p>
<p>whether he was at the door.

<p>but I do not recollect his ever wearing a mustache.
</p>
<p>Q. How was his face about that time,  smooth shaved as it is

<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. How did you get from the rear to the front of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. There was a side-entrance to go out to the front on the left-
</p>
<p>hand side of the theatre,  a little alley-way.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not go through the front door ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Booth in fi-ont of the theatre ?

<p>A. I saw him that afternoon, between four and five o'clock, I
</p>
<p>think, in the restam-ant, next door. I went in to look for James
</p>
<p>MadJox ; and I found several there drinking,  Booth, Nod Span-
</p>
<p>gler, Jim JIaddos, Peanuts, and a young gentleman by the name
</p>
<p>of John Mouldey, I think. Bladdox asked me if I would not take
</p>
<p>a drink. I said yes, and wont up and took a glass of ale.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Booth in front of the theatre when you were
</p>
<p>out on the pavement that night ?
</p>
<p>A. No : I did not see liim after he rode up there until after the
</p>
<p>assassination.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. How close were you to Booth and Spangler when Booth said

<p>those words to him on entering the theatre from the door 1
</p>
<p>A. About as far as I am fi-om you [a distance of about eight
</p>
<p>feet].
</p>
<p>Q. IIow far was Spangler from him ?

</p>
<p>Q. Did Booth sec you ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. Ho went right behind the scenes after
</p>
<p>that.
</p>
<p>Q. Could he have seen you from whore ho was standing?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes !
</p>
<p>Q. Was there anybody else by but you ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not take notice at that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not Spanglor in liquor that night ?
</p>
<p>A. That I canuot say : I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you often see him in liquor ?

</p>
<p>drunk, and when not.
</p>
<p>Q. Was ho not habitually pretty well soaked?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know, indeed.
</p>
<p>By the Court.

<p>that night ?

<p>By the Judge Advocate :

</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate suggested to the Court the propriety of a
</p>
<p>Tun rniAL. '223
</p>
<p>wit to Fonl's Tbeatre. Testimony having bouu givuu iu rulatioa
</p>
<p>to the mm-<ier, and the condition of affiiivs at and in the rear of the
</p>
<p>theatre, it would, perhaps, be more satisfactory to the Court to make
</p>
<p>a personal inspection of the premises.
</p>
<p>The suggestion was acquiesced in ; and the Commission adjourned
</p>
<p>to meet informally at the theatre at half-past nine o'clock on Tuesday
</p>
<p>morning.
</p>
<p>Tuesday, May 16, 1865.
</p>
<p>The Commission met infomally at the theatre at half-past nino
</p>
<p>o'clock ; and, after an inspection of the promises by the members
</p>
<p>of the tribunal and the counsel concerned in the case, proceeded to
</p>
<p>the Penitentiary building, in which its ses.sions are held.
</p>
<p>The roll was called ; and, all the members being present, the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing proceedings took place : 
</p>
<p>The President. One of the members of the Court has moved
</p>
<p>that the reading of the record be dispensed with, inasmuch as the
</p>
<p>counsel on the part of the prisoners are furnished with an official
</p>
<p>copy of the record, and have an opportunity of examining it during
</p>
<p>the intoiTals between the meetings of the Court, and can object to
</p>
<p>any thing that is incorrect when they come into Court, if they find
</p>
<p>any thing incorrect.
</p>
<p>CoL. Tompkins. Besides, it is very accurately pubUshed in the
</p>
<p>morning papers.
</p>
<p>Mk. Ewing. If the Court will allow me, I will state that the
</p>
<p>reporters are not able to furnish us immediately with an official
</p>
<p>copy of the record ; it is behind-hand always a day or more : but
</p>
<p>inasmuch as the record is published quite accurately in the " Intel-
</p>
<p>ligencer," and in fact published, I think, from the notes of the
</p>
<p>reporters, if the Court would allow us the privilege at any time,
</p>
<p>even though it be not the day after the examination of a witness,
</p>
<p>in case we discover an en-or, to ask that the witness be recalled, it
</p>
<p>would be satisfactory, so far as I am concerned.
</p>
<p>Gem. Katjtz. That can be done at any time. Under any cir-

</p>
<p>cumstances, a witness may be recalled.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. If the arrangement proposed is made, it will be
</p>
<p>224 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>necessary for the Judge Advonate to detain witnesses for, say, two
</p>
<p>days after their examination, so that we may have time to read the
</p>
<p>testimony as pubhshed in the paper, or as furnished us by the
</p>
<p>reporters. We have not been furnislicd yet with the last of yester-
</p>
<p>day's proceedings, nor has that portion been published in the
</p>
<p>paper.
</p>
<p>The Pkesident. T should tliink a detention of one day would
</p>
<p>be ample.
</p>
<p>Mk. Ewing. If the witnesses who were examined yesterday
</p>
<p>were detained until after the Court meets to-morrow, I think that
</p>
<p>would be sufficient. The evidence of the last witnesses examined
</p>
<p>yesterday will probably bo published in the " Intelhgencer "
</p>
<p>to-nion'ow.
</p>
<p>The Pkesibest. Has the Judge Advocate any objection to that
</p>
<p>arrangement ?
</p>
<p>The JuBGE Advocate (Gen. Holt). I do not wish to em-
</p>
<p>barrass the Court, certainly, by any suggestions of mine. I am
</p>
<p>as anxious for the despatch of business as anybody can be ; but, if
</p>
<p>this precedent is now established, it will be, I think, not only the
</p>
<p>first one which has been set in the military service, but the first in
</p>
<p>the civil service. I never, in my whole life, have been in connec-
</p>
<p>tion with any court, the proceedings of which were not read over in
</p>
<p>the hearing of the court itself, before they wore declared by the
</p>
<p>court to beaccurate and complete. Although I have as much con-
</p>
<p>fidence in the accuracy of our reportere as anybody can have, I
</p>
<p>think it would be a dangerous example to set ; and I would rather
</p>
<p>see it in any case that has arisen in the miUtary service of the
</p>
<p>country than in this, where there are so many lives at stake, and
</p>
<p>where it is so vastly important, not only that there should be strict
</p>
<p>accuracy, but that the country should feel assured that it is so, and
</p>
<p>that all the precautions necessary to secure that result have been
</p>
<p>resorted to. If it shall be known hereafter, in connection with this
</p>
<p>trial, that the Court departed from the usages of the service, and

</p>
<p>did not even have its own reconl road over, but trusted simply to
</p>
<p>the reporters for accuracy, it might go very far to shake the confi-
</p>
<p>dence of the ccmntry in the accuracy of these reports, and would
</p>
<p>certainly leave an opening for criticism.

<p>Gen. Foster. I tliink the reading should be proceeded with
</p>
<p>every morning for the purpose of corcction, if any correction should
</p>
<p>be necessary.
</p>
<p>The President. I am very much inclined, after hearing the
</p>
<p>opinion of the Judge Advocate General, to change my first impres-
</p>
<p>sion on the subject ; and I will vote against the proposition, though I
</p>
<p>thought favorably of it at first.
</p>
<p>The motion was then withdrawn ; and the record was read and
</p>
<p>approved.

</p>
<p>asked nic if I knew any thing about horses ; and I told him I knew
</p>
<p>a little about them. Then he asked me if I would not attend to
</p>
<p>Booth's horse ; and he gave me the job.

<p>234 r/ZB TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Mrs. INIaky Ann Turner,
</p>

</p>
<p>A. I reside in the rear of Ford's Theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. How f:ir from it ?
</p>
<p>A. As far as from here to where that gentleman sits over there,
</p>
<p>or may bo a little farther [pointing to one of the counsel for the
</p>
<p>accused, a distance of about eight feet].
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know John Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I knew him when I saw him.
</p>
<p>Q. . Will you state what you saw of him on the afternoon of the
</p>
<p>14th of April last ?
</p>
<p>A. That afternoon I saw him, I think, to the best of my recollec-
</p>
<p>tion, between three and four o'ckick, standing in the back door of '
</p>
<p>Ford's Theatre, with a lady by his side. I did not take any partic-
</p>
<p>ular notice of him at that time ; but I turaed from the door, and I
</p>
<p>saw no more of him, until, to the best of my recollection, between
</p>
<p>seven and eight, or near about eight o'clock that night, when he
</p>
<p>brought a horse up to the back door, opened the door, and called
</p>
<p>for a^man by the name of " Ned " three times, to the best of my
</p>
<p>recollection, not more than three times. This " Ned " came to him ;
</p>
<p>and I heard him say to "Ned" in a low voice, "Tell Maddox to
</p>
<p>come here." I then saw IMaddox come. He [Booth] said some-
</p>
<p>tMng in a very low voice to this Maddox ; and T saw Maddox reach
</p>
<p>out his hand and take the horse, but where "Ned" went I cannot
</p>
<p>tell. This Booth went on into the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him or hear him when ho came out after the
</p>
<p>assassination of the President ?
</p>
<p>A. I only heard the horse going very rapidly out of the alley j
</p>
<p>and I ran immediately to my door and opened it, but he was gone :
</p>
<p>I did not .see him at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see, the man named " Ned," of whom you speak?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did you see him 1
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 235
</p>
<p>A. I rashed to the door immediately : the crowd came out, and
</p>
<p>this time this man " Ned " came out of the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Wliieh of those men in the dock is it ?
</p>
<p>A. There he sits, with darli shirt and darlc coat on [pointing to the
</p>
<p>accused, Edward Spangler].
</p>
<p>Q. Spangler, you mean?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : Ned Spangler. And said I to him, " 5Ir. Ned, you
</p>
<p>know that man Booth called you ? " Said he, " No, I know noth-
</p>
<p>ing about it ; " and then he went down the alley.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that all that occurred between you and him 1
</p>
<p>A. That was all that was said between me and him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by 3Ir. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. How far is your house from the back door of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. 5Iy front door fronts to the back of the theatre. It comes
</p>
<p>out into the open alley, which leads up to the door. There is an-
</p>
<p>other house between mine and the theatre. The two houses are ad-
</p>
<p>joining ; and my house stands as far from the door of the tlieatre as
</p>
<p>from here to the post [about twenty-two feet]. I think it would
</p>
<p>allow that space for the two houses.
</p>
<p>Q.  Dill you see where Spangler went after he called Maddox ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not see where Spangler went after he called
</p>
<p>Jladdos.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he go off?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember whether he went off or not. I did not
</p>
<p>see him any more.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him go in to call Jladdos ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he turned from the door to call Maddox.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear him call him ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not hear him call 3Iaddos.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler come out again ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember whether he came out or not : I do not
</p>
<p>think I did see him come out.

<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>236 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state where you live in this city ?
</p>
<p>A. I live hctwecn E and F and Ninth and Tenth Streets.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you live near Ford's Theatre?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : right hack of the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Does your house adjoin that of Jlrs. Turner, who has just

<p>testified ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : my house and hora are adjoinmg

<p>A. Yes, sir: I knew hira by sight.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him on the afternoon or night of the 14th of
</p>
<p>April last 1
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I saw him in the morning.
</p>
<p>Q. State what you saw.
</p>
<p>A. I saw him down there by the stable ; and he went out of the
</p>
<p>alley, and I did not sec hira again until between two and three
</p>
<p>o'clock in the afternoon, when I saw him standing in the back theatre-
</p>
<p>door, in the alley that leads out back. He and a lady were stand-
</p>
<p>ing together, talking. I stood in my gate, and I looked right wish-
</p>
<p>ful at hira. Ho and this lady were pointing up and down the alley
</p>
<p>as if they were talking in their conversation about the alley, as it
</p>
<p>seemed to me ; and they stood there a considerable while. After
</p>
<p>that, they both turned into the theatre together. I never saw any
</p>
<p>more until at night. I went up stairs pretty early ; and, when I went
</p>
<p>up stairs, there was a carriage drove up the alley, and after that I
</p>
<p>heard a horse step down in the alley again. I looked out of the win-
</p>
<p>dow ; and it seemed as if the gentleman was leading this horse down
</p>
<p>the alloy. He did not get any farther than the end of the alley,
</p>
<p>and in a few minutes he returned back again. I still looked out
</p>
<p>to see who it was. He came up to the theatre-door, this gentleman
</p>
<p>did, with the horse by the bridle. He pushed the door open, and
</p>
<p>said something in a low tone ; and then in a loud voice ho called,
</p>
<p>" Ned," four tunes. There was a colored man up at the window ;
</p>
<p>and he' said, " Jlr. Ned, Mr. Booth calls you." That is the way

</p>
<p>I came to know it was !Mr. Booth. It was dark, and I could not
</p>
<p>see his face. When Mr. Ned came, Booth said to him in a low
</p>
<p>tone, " Tell Maddox to come here." Then Mr. Ned went back, and
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 237
</p>
<p>Maddox came out. Thoy said something to each other ; but I could
</p>
<p>not understand from my window what the words were. After that,
</p>
<p>Mr. Bladdos took hold of this horse. It seems it was between him
</p>
<p>and ^Ir. Ned. lie had this horse. Ho carried it from before my
</p>
<p>door, right at the corner of my house, around to where the work-
</p>
<p>bench was : that stood at the right side of the house. I could not
</p>
<p>see the horse ; but they both returned back into the theatre again.
</p>
<p>This man that carried the horse up went in the door too. The
</p>
<p>horse stood out there a considerable while. It kept up a great deal
</p>
<p>of stamping on the stones; and I said, " I wonder what is the mat-
</p>
<p>ter with that horse," it kept stamping so. After a while I saw this
</p>
<p>person have a hold of the horse, and he kept the horse walking back-
</p>
<p>wards and forwards. I suppose the horse was there completely an
</p>
<p>hour and a half altogether : then I saw the door open ; I did not
</p>
<p>see any person passing backwards and forwards ; and, in about tea
</p>
<p>minutes after that, I saw this man [Booth] come out of the door
</p>
<p>with something in his liand glittering. I did not know what it was ;
</p>
<p>but still I thought some person ran out of the theatre, and jumped on
</p>
<p>the horse. He had come out of the theatre-door so quick, that it
</p>
<p>seemed like as if he but touched that horse, and it was gone
</p>
<p>like a flash of lightning. I thought to myself " That horse must
</p>
<p>surely have run off with that gentleman." Presently I saw a rush
</p>
<p>out of that door, and heard the people saying, " Which way did he
</p>
<p>go ?" and " Which way did he go?" and still I did not know
</p>
<p>what was the matter. I asked a gentleman what was the matter ;
</p>
<p>and he said the President was shot. " Why ! " said I : " who shot
</p>
<p>him? " Said he, " That man who went out on the horse : did you
</p>
<p>see him?" I said I saw him when he first came out. That was
</p>
<p>the last time I saw him to know him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Spangler at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I saw Mr. Spangler after that. After that I came
</p>
<p>down stairs, and was at the door talking. I went up to the tlioatre-
</p>
<p>door ; and I saw IMr. Spangler when he came out of the door. Some
</p>
<p>one said, "Did you see that man?" I said to Mr. Spangler,

</p>
<p>very well by sight.
</p>

<p>the alley there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : it did not seem like as if he held it all the time ;
</p>
<p>but he took hold of the horse, and it seemed as if he had him a lit-
</p>
<p>tle while, and he moved him out of my sight ; and then I saw him
</p>
<p>return, and go into the theatre. This gentleman had on a hght
</p>
<p>coat.
</p>
<p>Q. Then who held the horse when he wont in the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see, because it was carried around from my door;
</p>
<p>and I could not see it out of my window. It was carried around the
</p>
<p>house like, out of sight : but then, when it was in a commotion, it
</p>
<p>seemed as if there was a man had it, but I could not tell wlio he was.
</p>
<p>Q. When the horse was moving up and down, it seemed as if a
</p>
<p>man had it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : as if a man was keeping it in motion all the time.
</p>
<p>Q. Marching it up and down to keep it from fretting and stamp-
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was making a great deal of noise, stamping its

</p>
<p>ward all the tune.

<p>THE TRIAL. 239
</p>
<p>Q. Mr. Spanglor just came to the door; and Booth said to him,
</p>
<p>" Tell Mr. JIadJox to come out " ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And then Spangler went in, did he?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he went in ; and then it seemed as if ho eamo out
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure he came out again ?
</p>
<p>A. It seems to me like as if ho came out again. Whether he
</p>
<p>came out or not, I am not certain ; but I know he came to the door
</p>
<p>when BIr. Booth called.
</p>
<p>Q. But you are not certain that he came out again ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I am not certain whether ho came out again or no ;
</p>
<p>but I know he came out to the door when Booth called him, and he
</p>
<p>told him to toll Maddox to come out ; and Bladdox came out to this
</p>
<p>Mr. Booth, and had some conversation with him ; but I could not
</p>
<p>hear what it was.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was it from the time that Booth rode up there until
</p>
<p>the people said ho had shot the President ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose it was about an hour  not quite an hour  from
</p>
<p>the time ho came up there to the time they said the President was
</p>
<p>shot. I think it was almost an hour ; but I do not think it was quite
</p>
<p>an hour.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the man who held the horse at the time Booth
</p>
<p>ran out and rode away on him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I saw the man, but I could not tell who the man
</p>
<p>was. I know a man had hold of the horse when Booth came out,
</p>
<p>because, when ho came- out, he was walking the horse up and down ;
</p>
<p>and it seemed as if, the minute ho touched the horse, the horse was
</p>
<p>gone. I was looking down the alloy to see which way he went ; and
</p>
<p>when I looked back again, I did not see anybody.
</p>
<p>Q. Did that man look like Mr. Maddox ?
</p>
<p>A. He looked very much like Mr. Bladdox to me. I know BIr.
</p>
<p>Jladdnx. He wears a light coat, and this man seemed as if ho had
</p>
<p>a light coat on. It was pretty dark there that night : I could not

<p>see distinctly from my window ; but the coat he had on seemed
</p>
<p>as if it was light.
</p>
<p>240 'fut: TJtiAi.
</p>
<p>Q. How far was ho from you when you say you thought it was
</p>
<p>Mr. Maddos?
</p>
<p>A. Ho was right near the door.
</p>
<p>Q. How far from where you were ?
</p>
<p>A. About as far as from here to that window, or a little farther
</p>
<p>[about fifteen feet].
</p>
<p>Q. Whereabouts was the horse just at the time when Booth ran
</p>
<p>out the door ?
</p>
<p>A. Standing right at the door.
</p>
<p>Q. And this man with the light coat on was standing right by
</p>
<p>him?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say whether he was standing by him, because I was
</p>
<p>looking at the man when he rushed out the door so ; and every thing
</p>
<p>was in such a twinkling of an eye, that I could not say distinctly
</p>
<p>that it was the man with the light coat on : but I know there was a
</p>
<p>man holding the horse all the time, as far as I could see.
</p>
<p>Q. It was not Mr. Spangler that was holding him?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. It seems to me, it was between all three of
</p>
<p>them. They all three seemed to be out there with the horse appar-
</p>
<p>ently. I knew j\lr. Ned came out to the door, and then INIr. Mad-
</p>
<p>dox came out, and then it seemed as if Mr. Ned came out again.
</p>
<p>Q. But you are not certain that he did come out again?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I am not very certain of that ; but I know there were
</p>
<p>three men in it altogether.
</p>
<p>Q. That is, three men connected with it in some way?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : three men connected with it in some way.
</p>
<p>Q. But you cannot say that you saw Mr. Spangler except when
</p>
<p>he came out of the door, and Booth told him to call Maddox ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I cannot say for certain ; but I know one of the
</p>
<p>men had on a light coat.
</p>
<p>Q. That was the one that was holding the horse?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>THE T E I A L. 241
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state if you are tbo private secretary of the
</p>
<p>President ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I am.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you with him on the 14th of April last ?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a card to the witness.] What knowledge, if
</p>
<p>any, have you of that card having been sent to him by John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Between the hours of four and five o'clock in the' afternoon, I
</p>
<p>left Vice-President Johnson's room in the Capitol, and went to the
</p>
<p>Kirkwood House, where I was boarding with him. Upon entering,
</p>
<p>I went up to the office, as was my custom ; and I saw a card in luy
</p>
<p>box. Vice-President Johnson's box and mine were adjoining :
</p>
<p>mine was G7, his was G8. In 67 I noticed a card. The clerk of
</p>
<p>the hotel, Mr. Jones, handed it to me. This I recognize as
</p>
<p>the card.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you read what is on it ?
</p>
<p>A. " Don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth." It was iu my box.
</p>
<p>[The card was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know any thing about the handwriting of Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You had no acquaintance whatever with J. Wilkes Booth,
</p>
<p>had you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I had known him when he was playing in Nash-
</p>
<p>ville, Tenn. I met him there several times. That was the only
</p>
<p>acquaintance that I had with him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you understand the card as sent to the President, or to
</p>
<p>yourself?
</p>
<p>A. At the time, I attached no importance to it. I had known
</p>
<p>him in Nashville ; and, seeing the card, I made the remark, when
</p>
<p>it was handed to me by the clerk, " It is from Booth : is he playing
</p>
<p>here '{ " I had some idea of going to see him. I thought, perhaps,

</p>
<p>he might have called upon me, having known me ; but, when his
</p>
<p>name was connected with this affair, I looked upon it differently.
</p>
<p>It was a very common mistake in the office to put the cards intended

</p>
<p>Cross-examined by JIk. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state, if you know, at what hoiir the Vice-President
</p>
<p>was in his room that day ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot do so with accuracy. I really do not know at what
</p>
<p>hours he was there. IIo was at the Capitol, I think, for the greater
</p>
<p>part of the forenoon of that day,  that is my impression,  and
</p>
<p>was at dinner at five o'clock. I do not think he was out afterwards.
</p>
<p>I was out myself, and did not return till after this occurrence at the
</p>
<p>theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know at what time he left his room in the morning ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. You know he returned about five o'clock ?
</p>
<p>A. He was there at five o'clock ; but I cannot state at what
</p>
<p>hour he returned. He was there at dinner; and wo generally
</p>
<p>dined at about five o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. You say he was in his room for the balance of the evening ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is my impression.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you in his room in the course of the evening ?
</p>
<p>A. I was there, I think, i^p to six or seven o'clock ; and T was
</p>
<p>not there afterwards until about eleven o'clock. It was after the
</p>
<p>assassination that I returned. I was out that evening.

<p>this city ?

<p>THE TRIAL. 243
</p>
<p>Q. Which one is it ?
</p>
<p>A. There he is [pointing to Michael O'Laughlin].
</p>
<p>Q. Can you state under wliat circumstances you saw him, and
</p>
<p>at what hour, and what occurred ?
</p>
<p>A. I was at the house of the Secretary of War about half-past
</p>
<p>ten o'clock, I should judge. I had beeu on duty at the War
</p>
<p>Department, and left there at ten o'clock, after the illumination was
</p>
<p>over, and walked up to the Secretary's house. On the steps were
</p>
<p>General Grant, Jlrs. Grant, the Secretary, General Barnes and his
</p>
<p>wife, Mr. Knapp and his wife, Miss Lucy Stanton, Mr. David
</p>
<p>Stanton, and two or three small children. There was a band there
</p>
<p>playing at the house. I was talking to Mrs. Grant and to the
</p>
<p>General. They were standing on the upper steps. They set off
</p>
<p>some fireworks in the square opposite; and I stepped down a httlo
</p>
<p>to allow the cliildren to see them. I got down on the step, I think,
</p>
<p>next to the last one, leaning against the railing; and this man
</p>
<p>[O'Laughlin] came up to me, I suppose after I had been there ten
</p>
<p>minutes, probably, and he said, "Is Stanton in?" Said I, "I
</p>
<p>suppose you mean the Secretary ? " He said, " Yes." I think he
</p>
<p>made the remark, " I am a lawyer in town : I know him very well."
</p>
<p>I was under the impression ho was under the influence of liquor. I
</p>
<p>told him I did not think he could see him then ; and he walked to
</p>
<p>the other side of the stops, and stood there probably five minutes.
</p>
<p>I still staid there, I suppose, for about five minutes ; and he walked
</p>
<p>over to me again, mid said, " Is Mr. Stanton in?" and then ho said,
</p>
<p>" Escu.se me : I thought you were the officer on duty here." Said
</p>
<p>I, " There is no officer on duty here." He then walked on to the
</p>
<p>other side of the steps, and walked inside of the hall, the alcove,
</p>
<p>and stood on the inside step. I saw him standing there; and I
</p>
<p>walked over to Mr. David Stanton, and said, " Do you know that
</p>
<p>man ? " He said he did not. I said to him, " He says ho knows
</p>
<p>the Secretary very well ; but he is under the influence of liquor,
</p>
<p>and you had better bring him out." ]\Ir. David Stanton walked
</p>
<p>up to him, talked to him a few momeuts, and then took him down

<p>the steps. He went ofl', and I did not notice him again.
</p>
<p>Q. Did ho say any thing about General Grant ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not. General Grant, I think, had gone into the
</p>
<p>244 THE TltlAL.
</p>
<p>parlor at the timo. I am not certain about tbat ; but tbat is my
</p>
<p>impression.
</p>
<p>Q. He was looking in to see tbe Secretary from his position,
</p>
<p>was lie?
</p>
<p>A. I tbinlv tbe Secretary stood on tbe steps outside, and this
</p>
<p>man stood bebiud tbe Secretary ; and from wbere be stood be could
</p>
<p>see into the parlor. On tbe left-band side of the hall, going in, is
</p>
<p>the library ; on tbe other side is the parlor-door. Ho stood on the
</p>
<p>side next to tbe library ; and, in that position, ho could have looked
</p>
<p>into the parlor, and seen who was in there, tbi-ough the door. The
</p>
<p>whole house was illuminated and lighted up.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you feel perfectly certain, or not, that tbe prisoner
</p>
<p>O'Laugbliu is the man you saw ?
</p>
<p>A. I feel perfectly certain.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cox :
</p>
<p>Q. Was it moonlight or dark on tbat evening?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot toll : I do not recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there a crowd there surrounding the Secretary's house
</p>
<p>at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : quite a large crowd.
</p>
<p>Q. Close up to tlie steps?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : all around.
</p>
<p>Q. And ho mingled with tbe crowd, or close to them ?
</p>
<p>A. I did nut notice any thing at all about him until he walked
</p>
<p>up on the steps and spoke to me. I paid no attention to it what-
</p>
<p>ever ; and, after he wont out again, I saw him no more.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not go inside of the ball while be was there ?
</p>
<p>A. Not while be was there.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say that Secretary Stanton was on the
</p>
<p>upper step at tbat time ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he pass by him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : be wont to the right of them. I am certain tbat
</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton was on the upper side at the time, talking to

<p>THE TRIAL. 045
</p>
<p>A. Secretary Stanton was on tbe left-hand side ; and tlio man
</p>
<p>went up on the right-hand side, and went in, and took a place on
</p>
<p>the step on the loft-hand side.
</p>
<p>Q. Plow was ho dressed ?
</p>
<p>A. He had on a black slouch hat, a black frock-coat, and a
</p>
<p>black pair of pants : as to his vest I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Q. That was while tlio fireworks wore going on, you stated?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : there were fireworks after that.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever seen that man before ?
</p>
<p>A. I never had.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen him since ?

</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. It was the hour of half-past ten, I think you said ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, it was half-past ten. I was on duty at the "War
</p>
<p>Department that night ; and, after the lights were put out, I walked
</p>
<p>up to the house. I suppose I had been there ten or fifteen minutes.
</p>
<p>Q. You cannot remember whether it was a dark nisjht or moon-
</p>
<p>light?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot. It is my impression that it was a moonlight night;
</p>
<p>but I did not take any particular notice.

<p>Q. Do you rocDgnize liim here?
</p>
<p>A. It is that man sitting bacli there [pointing to the prisoner
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin].
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether you saw him on the 13th of April
</p>
<p>last ? and if so, where, and under what circumstances ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw him on the night of the illumination  I suppose it
</p>
<p>was the night General Grant came from the front  at Secretaiy
</p>
<p>Stanton's house.
</p>
<p>Q. What occurred there between you and him? What was
</p>
<p>said ?
</p>
<p>A. I was standing on the steps, looking at the illumination;
</p>
<p>and this man [O'Laughlin] approached me, and asked me if General
</p>
<p>Grant was in. I told him he was. He said he wished to see him.
</p>
<p>Said I, " This is no occasion for you to see him. If you wish to
</p>
<p>see him, step out on the pavement, or on the stone where the car-
</p>
<p>riage stops, and you can see him."
</p>
<p>Q. What time of night was it ?
</p>
<p>A. I should judge it was about nine o'clock : it may have been
</p>
<p>a little after nine.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that all that oceuiTcd between you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not go in the house, or attempt to go in ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he on the steps of Mr. Stanton's house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sii' : I was standing on the top step.
</p>
<p>Q. AV^as he on the top step also ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he was on the steps, I should judge about two
</p>
<p>steps below me ; which brought him, I believe, about the third step
</p>
<p>from the pavement.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he leave the steps while you were there ?
</p>
<p>A. He left the step after I spoke to him. He was talking ; but
</p>
<p>I did not understand what he was saying. He walked off away
</p>
<p>from the step towards the tree-box. He seemed to reflect over

<p>A. I do not think I had : not to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you see him the next time ?
</p>
<p>A. I next saw him in prison ; I think, in this building, or the
</p>
<p>one adjoining.
</p>
<p>Q. How long ago ?
</p>
<p>A. That was last Sunday week.
</p>
<p>Q. You came here to see if it was the same man ?
</p>
<p>A. When I first started to come down here, I did not know the
</p>
<p>object of my coming down.
</p>
<p>Q. Wlio did you come with 1
</p>
<p>A. I was accompanied by Jlajor Eckert and JIajor Knox.
</p>
<p>Wlien I came down here, I did not know what I had to come
</p>
<p>down for. I inquired of Major Eckert if I had to come in the
</p>
<p>building, when in front of the house ; and the major told me to
</p>
<p>come in. Then, when I was inside the building, I was told to
</p>
<p>stop a moment at the door. I was up, I should judge, about two
</p>
<p>steps in the second story ; and even then I did not know what I
</p>
<p>came down for, until Major Eckert called me in : but, the moment
</p>
<p>I looked around the room and saw the man, I thought to myself,
</p>
<p>" I see the olijeet of my coming down."
</p>
<p>Q. Those ai-e the only two occasions on which you recollect ever
</p>
<p>having seen him ?
</p>
<p>A. Tho.se are the only times with the exception of this time.
</p>
<p>Q. What made you think it was the same man ? Was there
</p>
<p>any thing peculiar about his appearance ?

</p>
<p>A. The first time I saw him it was very light, and he had on a
</p>
<p>dark suit of clothes, with a heavy mustache, black, and an imperial ;
</p>
<p>248 TUB TRIAL.
</p>
<p>and tlie way I took so much notice of him was, while I was speak-
</p>
<p>ing to him he was standing a httle lower down, and I was looking
</p>
<p>right in hi.5 foce at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. What kind of a hat had he on ?
</p>
<p>A. A bhirk hat.
</p>
<p>Q. What kind?
</p>
<p>A. A dark slouch hat, not very high, a little low, something
</p>
<p>like the one on the table there.
</p>
<p>Q. How was ho dressed ?
</p>
<p>A. In dark clothes.
</p>
<p>Q. What sort of a coat had he on,  a dress-coat or a frock-
</p>
<p>coat?
</p>
<p>A. A dress-coat.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the color of his pantaloons ?
</p>
<p>A. They were dark : I could not say exactly whether they were
</p>
<p>black or dark-brown. They wore dark, though.
</p>
<p>Q. What size was he ?
</p>
<p>A. I should judge he was my size. While he was standing
</p>
<p>there, ho might seem to be a little lower, because he was standing
</p>
<p>about two steps below me. I should judge hun to be about five
</p>
<p>feet four or five inches.
</p>
<p>Q. That you think was at nine o'clock ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think it was about nine o'clock : it might have been
</p>
<p>after.
</p>
<p>Q. Had a crowd come to^serenade the Secretary?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : there were four or five bands there at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the Secretary on the steps at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; the Secretary was inside in the parlor with General
</p>
<p>Grant.
</p>
<p>Q. They had not come out then ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : they had not been out then.
</p>
<p>Q. There was nobody on the steps but you ?
</p>
<p>A. Nobody but myself.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the crowd close up to the steps ?

<p>A. The crowd was pretty close ; right up to the lower step.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the front door open at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; both doors were open : the front door was open,
</p>

<p>the gas was full lit all around.

<p>Dk. Robert Kino Stone,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court if you are a practising physician in thia
</p>
<p>city.
</p>
<p>A. I am.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you or not the physician of the late President of the
</p>
<p>United States ?
</p>
<p>A. I was his family physician.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you wore called to see him on the even-
</p>
<p>ing of his assassination, and the examination which you made, and
</p>
<p>the result.
</p>
<p>^ A. I was sent for by Mrs. Lincoln immediately after the assas-
</p>
<p>sination. I arrived there in a very few moments, and found that
</p>
<p>the President had been removed from the theatre to the house of a
</p>
<p>gentleman living directly opposite the theatre ; had been carried
</p>
<p>into tlio back room of the -residence, and was there placed upon a
</p>
<p>bed : found a number of gentlemen, citizens, around him ; and,
</p>
<p>among otJicrs, two assistant surgeons of the array, who had brought
</p>
<p>him over from the theatre, and had attended to him. They imme-
</p>
<p>diately gave over the ca.se to my care, knowing my relations to the
</p>
<p>family. I proceeded then to examine him, and instantly found
</p>
<p>that the President had received a gun-shot wound in the back part
</p>
<p>of the left side of his head, into which I carried immediately my
</p>
<p>finger. I at once informed those around that the case was a hope-
</p>
<p>less one ; that the President would die ; that there was no positive
</p>
<p>hmit to the duration of his life ; that his vital tenacity was very
</p>
<p>strong, and he would resist as long as any man could ; but that
</p>
<p>death certamly would soon close the scene. I remained with him,
</p>
<p>doing whatever was in my power, assisted by my friends, to aid

<p>him : but, of cour.se, nothing could be done ; and he died the next
</p>
<p>250 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>morning at about half-past seven o'clock. It was about a (quarter-
</p>
<p>past ten that I roaclicil liim.
</p>
<p>Q. He died from that wound ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you extract the ball ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. The next day, previous to the process of embalm-
</p>
<p>ment, with some medical friends, Dr. Curtis and Dr. Woodward of
</p>
<p>the ai'ray, and in the presence, also, of Surgeon-General Dr. Barnes,
</p>
<p>the examination was made. We traced the wound through the
</p>
<p>brain ; and the ball was found in the anterior part of the same side
</p>
<p>of the brain, the left side,  a large ball, resembling those balls
</p>
<p>which are shot from the pistol known as the Derringer,  an unusu-
</p>
<p>ally large ball ; that is, a larger ball than those used in tin; ordi-
</p>
<p>nary pocket revolvers.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a leaden ball ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : a hand-made ball, from which the top on the little
</p>
<p>end had been cut by liand. Tlio ball was flattened somewhat, im-
</p>
<p>pressed in its passage through the skull ; and a portion had been cut
</p>
<p>oflT in going through the bone. I marked the ball with the initials
</p>
<p>of the late President, and sealed it in the presence of the Secretary
</p>
<p>of War in his office.  sealed it witli my private seal, and indorsed
</p>
<p>it with my name. The Secretary enelo.sed it in another envelope,
</p>
<p>which he indorsed in like manner, and sealed with his private
</p>
<p>seal. It is still in his custody ; and ho ordered it to be placed
</p>
<p>among the archives of his department.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the liall slightly flattened ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, .sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the pistol ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not. I may state that I marked the ball
</p>
<p>with the initials of the I'resident, "A. L.," so that I could recog-
</p>
<p>nize it instantly.
</p>
<p>Q. [E.\hibiting a ball to the witness.] Look at tliat ball, and
</p>
<p>tell the Court whether it is the one which you extracted from the
</p>
<p>head of the President.

<p>A. It is. I recognize the mark I put upon it with my penknife,

</p>
<p>The ball was flattened, as I described it to the Court.
</p>
<p>[The ball was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. You know nothing in regard to the pistol ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I never saw it.
</p>
<p>Seegeant Silas T. Cobb,
</p>
<p>a witness for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as fol-
</p>
<p>lows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, on the night of the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of the President, you were on duty at what is called, I believe,
</p>
<p>the Navy -Yard Bridge ?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember to have seen two men passing rapidly on
</p>
<p>horseback that night ? and if you did so, at what hour was it ?
</p>
<p>A. There were three men approached me rapidly on horseback ;
</p>
<p>and two of them passed.
</p>
<p>Q. At what hour ?
</p>
<p>A. Between half past ten and eleven o'clock in the evening.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you challenge them ?
</p>
<p>^ A. The sentry challenged them ; and I advanced then to recog-
</p>
<p>nize them.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you recognize them 'l
</p>
<p>A. I satisfied myself that two of them were proper persons to
</p>
<p>pass, and passed them.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recognize either of those persons among the prisoners
</p>
<p>here 'i
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you describe cither of those men, or both of them ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I could describe them.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you would recognize them, or either of them,
</p>
<p>by a photograph ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I would.

<p>252 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>The Witness. That man passed first.
</p>
<p>Q. Mono?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. I thought you said the three were together ?
</p>
<p>A. No, fir : I did not. I said that two of them passed me ;
</p>
<p>but they were not together.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any conversatioa with him as he passed ?
</p>
<p>A. I had, for some three or four minutes.
</p>
<p>Q. What name did he give ?
</p>
<p>A. lie gave me his name as Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he say ? Any thing special beyond the desire to
</p>
<p>pass?
</p>
<p>A. I asked him, " Who are you, sir? " He said, " My name
</p>
<p>is Booth." Then I asked him where from ; and he made answer
</p>
<p>from the city. Said I, " Where are you going? " and said he, " I
</p>
<p>am going home." I asked him where his home was. He said it
</p>
<p>was in Charles. I understood, by that, that he meant Charles
</p>
<p>County. I asked him what town, and he said he did not live in any
</p>
<p>town. Said I, " You must live in some town." Said he, " I live
</p>
<p>close to Bcantown ; but I do not live in the town." I asked him
</p>
<p>why he was out so late ; if he did not know the rules, that persons
</p>
<p>were not allowed to pass after nine o'clock. He said it was new to
</p>
<p>him ; that he had somewhere to go, and it was a dark night, and he
</p>
<p>thousrht ho would have the moon. The moon rose that night about that
</p>
<p>time. I thought he was a proper person to pass, and I passed -him.
</p>
<p>Q. How long after him was it that the other two men came ?
</p>
<p>A. The next one came, I should think, in from five to seven, or
</p>
<p>perhaps ten minutes at the outside, not later.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they seem to be riding rapidly or leisurely ?
</p>
<p>A. The second one that came did not seem to bo riding so rap-
</p>
<p>idly, or his horse did not show .signs of it so much, as the first one.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he say to you ?
</p>
<p>A. I asked him who he was, and he said his name was Smith,
</p>
<p>and that he was going home ; that ho lived at White Plains. I

</p>
<p>asked him how it was that he was out so late. Ho made use of a
</p>
<p>rather indelicate cxpres.sion, and said he had been in bad company.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that a large or small man ?
</p>
<p>THE TJtIAL. 253
</p>
<p>A. Ho was a small-pized man, not a large man.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have a good view of his face '! Was there a liglit ?
</p>
<p>A. I did. I brought him up before the guard-house door, so that
</p>
<p>the li^ht shone full in his face and on his horse.
</p>
<p>o
</p>
<p>Q. How would he compare in size with the last man on the row
</p>
<p>in the prisoner's dock ? [David E. Herold, who stood up for identi-
</p>
<p>fication.]
</p>
<p>A. He is very near the size, but I should think taller, although
</p>
<p>I could not tell it on the horse ; and he had a lighter complexion than
</p>
<p>that man.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you allow him to pass after that explanation ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What became of the other man ?
</p>
<p>A. The other man I turned back. He did not seem to have
</p>
<p>any business on the other side that I considered sufficient to pass
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he on horseback also ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he seem to be the companion of these other men?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they come up together ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : they were some distance apart.
</p>
<p>Q. Did this man make any inquiry as to Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. He made inquiry after a roan horse,  not after Booth,  a
</p>
<p>man passing on a roan horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Which man did ? the small man that you describe, or the one
</p>
<p>that you turned back V
</p>
<p>A. The one I turned back.
</p>
<p>Q. Did the small man make any inquiry in regard to another
</p>
<p>horseman that had passed ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : none whatever.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the color of the horse of the second one ?
</p>
<p>A. The second one was a roan horse.

<p>254 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>of half racking, or something like that. The horse did not move
</p>
<p>like a trotting horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice the horse of Booth, his size and color?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you describe the animal?
</p>
<p>A. Ho was a small-sized horse ; rather an undersized horse, I
</p>
<p>should think ; a very bright bay, smooth, shiny skin; and looked as
</p>
<p>though he had just had a short burst,  a short push,  and seemed
</p>
<p>restive and uneasy, much more so than the rider.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a horse or a mare ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not tell : I did not take pai'ticular notice.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Did the rider have any spurs on ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not notice particularly about his spurs. I did not notice
</p>
<p>that he had spurs. I confined my attention more to his face and
</p>
<p>general appearance.
</p>
<p>By the JuDQE Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say that the first one had spurs on ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that he had : I could not swear to it.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that the second man that passed was
</p>
<p>on a light horse ?
</p>
<p>A. A roan horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he not taken as a lightcolored horse, nearly white ? Did
</p>
<p>he not appear so ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I think it was a roan.
</p>
<p>Q. A light roan?
</p>
<p>A. He was a light roan. He had some dark spots on him ; but
</p>
<p>he was easily distinguished as a roan horse in the light.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he a large-sized horse ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; about a medium-sized horse: he carried his head
</p>
<p>down ; he did not carry his head up.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think he would be easily distinguished as a roan horse
</p>
<p>by moonlight ?

<p>Q. What time did the moon rise that night ?

<p>eleven and'twelve o'clock, I think.

<p>By the Jddge Advoc.\te :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether you were on the road between Wash-
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. Will you state if you met one or more horsemen, and at what
</p>
<p>hour, and under what circumstances ?
</p>
<p>A. I met two, about eleven o'clock, riding very fast.
</p>
<p>Q. In what direction ?
</p>
<p>A. They wore going towards Marlboro'. I met them at Good-
</p>
<p>Hope Hill. The first one was alone ; and then there was one about
</p>
<p>half a mile behind him, I suppose.
</p>
<p>Q. Both riding rapidly ?
</p>
<p>A. Very fast.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they say any thing to you ?
</p>
<p>A. The first one stopped me, and asked me the road to Marlboro'.
</p>
<p>He first asked me if there was a horseman passed ahead ; and then
</p>
<p>ho asked me the road to Marlboro', if it did not turn to the right. I
</p>
<p>told him to keep the straight road.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see his horse and its color?
</p>
<p>A. The first one was a dark horse; I think, a bay.
</p>
<p>Q. What did the other one say?
</p>
<p>A. The other one said nothing to me. I think I heard him ask

</p>
<p>or them. I never answered him.
</p>
<p>Q. How far was ho behind the other?
</p>
<p>A. About half a mile, I reckon : I .suppose it was that.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the appearance of his horse ? Did you notice the

<p>color ?
</p>
<p>A. It was a roan horse ; a light hor.se, a roan, or an iron-gray.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the man a large or small one V

<p>A. I never noticed the man particularly.

<p>Q. How far from this city was it that you met them ?

<p>or three miles from the city ; half-way up the hill.

<p>Q. That was the one that inquired the way to Marlboro' ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>Q. How long was it before the other one came along ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not suppose it was over five or ten minutes : I do not
</p>
<p>know exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you say the second one inquired of you?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know whether he inquired of me or the teamsters ;
</p>
<p>but I heard him ask whether a horseman had passed ahead or not.
</p>
<p>I did not answer, though.
</p>
<p>Q. The road forks at Good Hope,  one turning to the right,and
</p>
<p>the other to the left. Were you this side of the forks ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I was. I do not know where they fork. I am not
</p>
<p>acquainted with the road much. I have never travelled it but two
</p>
<p>or three times, and the first time was in tlic night.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the foremost man riding at a rapid gait ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he was riding very fast. Both of them wore riding

</p>
<p>.A. Oh, yes, sir ! I had got off the hill entirely.
</p>
<p>Q. You could not give the first man the direction he asked for ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. Ho asked me the road to Jlarlboro'. He asked me
</p>
<p>if it did not turn to the right. I told him no ; it kept a straight
</p>
<p>road.

<p>William T. Kent,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Jitdge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a pistol to the witness.] Will you state whether
</p>
<p>or not the pistol which you now have before you was picked up by
</p>
<p>you in the box of the President on the night of his assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : this is the pistol.
</p>
<p>Q. What is it,  a Derringer pistol ?
</p>
<p>A. A Derringer I believe is the name of it. I know that was
</p>
<p>the name of it, because it is marked on it.
</p>
<p>[The pistol was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. How long after the President was shot did you pick it up?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know exactly how long. About throe minutes after
</p>
<p>the President was shot, I went into the box. There were two other
</p>
<p>persons there then ; and a surgeon, apparently, asked me for a knife
</p>
<p>to cut open the President's clothes. I haniled him mine, and with
</p>
<p>it he cut the President's clothes open. I then went out of the thea-
</p>
<p>tre, and went down to call my room-mate ; and I missed my night-
</p>
<p>key, and. tliinking that I had dropped my night-key in pulling out
</p>
<p>my knife, I hurried back to the theatre ; and when I went into the
</p>
<p>box, and was searching around for it on the floor, I knocked my foot
</p>
<p>against the pistol, and, stooping down, I picked it up. I held it up,
</p>
<p>and cried out, " I have found the pistol ! " Some persons told me
</p>
<p>to give it to the police ; but a gentleman, representing himself as the
</p>
<p>agent of the Associated Press, came to me, and told me he was the
</p>
<p>agent of the Associated Press ; and I handed it to him, and gave him
</p>
<p>my name at the same time. The next morning, I went round to
</p>
<p>the police station, and I identified it there.

</p>
<p>Q. State all the inquiries which were addressed to him by your-
</p>
<p>self or other members of your party, and what he said.
</p>
<p>A. We first asked whether there had been any strangers at his
</p>
<p>house, and he said there were. In the first place, he did not seem to
</p>
<p>care about giving any satisfaction ; and then he went on to state
</p>
<p>that on Saturday morning, at daybreak, two strangers had come to
</p>
<p>his place : one of them rapped at the door, and the other sat on a
</p>
<p>horse ; and he went down and opened the door, and went out with
</p>
<p>the young man, and helped the otlier off the horse into the house ; that
</p>
<p>one of them had a broken leg, and he went to work to set the leg.
</p>
<p>I asked him who the man was. Ho said be did not know. He
</p>
<p>said he was a stranger to him. I asked him what kind of looking
</p>
<p>man tlio other was. He said ho was a young man about seventeeu
</p>
<p>or eiglitcen.

<p>A. He said they remained there for a short time. This was the
</p>
<p>first conversation that I had with him.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 259
</p>
<p>Q. You say a short time. Do you mean, by tbat, that they went
</p>
<p>away in the course of the morning ? What did he state as to that ?

<p>A. That is what I understood him.

<p>A. This was on Tuesday, the 18th of April.

</p>
<p>ho say on that subject ?

</p>
<p>Sunday, I think ; that he had heard it at church.
</p>
<p>Q. What distance is his house from Washington ?
</p>
<p>A. By the way of Bryantown, it would be about thirty miles, I
</p>
<p>suppose.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it upon one of the highways of the country, an open road ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : it is off the road, I suppose, a quarter of a mile.
</p>
<p>Q. A quarter of a mile from one of the principal roads and
</p>
<p>thoroughfares ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the road runs from Bryantown.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any considerable conversation with him in re-
</p>
<p>gard to the assassination of the President ?
</p>
<p>A. We did not talk much about that : I was making inquiries
</p>
<p>about these men more than any thing else.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were you at his house ?
</p>
<p>A. Probably an hour.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he continue to the last, until you left, to make the same
</p>
<p>representation, that those men were entire strangers to him?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. 
</p>
<p>Q. That he knew nothing of thom ?
</p>

</p>
<p>called for a razor ; and he furnished him with a razor and some soap
</p>
<p>and water, and he shaved his mustache off there. I asked him if
</p>
<p>be had any other beard : he said yes ; he had a long pair of whiskers.
</p>
<p>Q. And tbat they both loft there on tbat morning ?
</p>
<p>A. I understood that in that conversation.

</p>
<p>Q. Did you untlerstanJ him to say they were Loth mounted when

</p>
<p>Q. And that the lame man went off on the crutches ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he said he had had a pair of crutches made for him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say that he showed him across or into the swamp ?
</p>
<p>A. He said he showed him across the swamp, so I understood.
</p>
<p>I was perfectly satisfied, then, that this party was Booth and Herold.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you arrive at that conclusion from the description given
</p>
<p>of the men ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state to you for what purpose these men had gone into
</p>
<p>the swamp ?
</p>
<p>A. He said that they were going towards Allen's Fresh.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state for what purpose he supposed the lame man liad
</p>
<p>shaved off his mustache ?

<p>that were along with me made a remark that it looked suspicious,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Mudd also said then that it did look suspicious.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether you had a subsequent interview with
</p>
<p>the prisoner Dr. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I had.
</p>
<p>Q. How long after the one of which you have spoken ?

</p>
<p>me the boot.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he say in regard to the boot ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 261
</p>
<p>A. lie said he had to cut it off the man's leg ia order to set the
</p>
<p>leg. I turned down the top of the boot, and saw some writing on the
</p>
<p>inside,  saw the name "J. Willces " written in it. I called his
</p>
<p>attention to it ; and he said he had not taken notice of that before.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a boot.] Is that the boot ?
</p>
<p>A. It is.
</p>
<p>[The boot was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. Did he at that time still insist that they were strangers to him ?
</p>
<p>or did ho profess now to know either of them ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : not at that time. He still said they were strangers.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he at any subsequent time admit to you that ho knew
</p>
<p>Booth?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he subsequently said he was satisfied that it was
</p>
<p>Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state why he was so satisfied ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that ?
</p>
<p>A. That was on Friday, the same day. I made the remark to
</p>
<p>him that his wife said she had not seen their whiskers back discon-
</p>
<p>nected from the face. I suppose he was satisfied then.
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you that he said quite distinctly, and insisted on
</p>
<p>it, that he had not known this man Booth before ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he or not, in any subsequent conversation in regard to
</p>
<p>this man Booth, admit that he knew hira ?
</p>
<p>A. After I left, we got our horses ; and, going on the main road,
</p>
<p>I told one of the men to show him Booth's photograph. The man
</p>
<p>hold it up to him ; and he said that it did not look like Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. [E-thibiting to the witness Booth's photograph. Exhibit No.
</p>
<p>1.] Is that the same kind of photograph you exhibited?
</p>
<p>A. The same. The photograph we showed may have had Booth's
</p>
<p>name writ.ten or printed on it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Dr. Mudd say it was not like him, or was like him ?

<p>Q. Where?
</p>
<p>A. At cbmch, I tbink he said.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not state that he had ever met Booth in this city ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. On being questioned by one of the other men he
</p>
<p>stated that ho was along with Booth in the country, looking up some
</p>
<p>land; and that he was along with him when he bought ahorse of
</p>
<p>Squire Gardner.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state the time?

</p>
<p>Q. You say that Dr. Mudd gave you a description of those two
</p>
<p>persons ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he said one was quite a young man.
</p>
<p>Q. What further did he say 1
</p>
<p>A. He said the other one had whiskers on,  lar<re chin-whis-
</p>
<p>kers. "
</p>
<p>Q. What did he say about the resemblance between the iiboto-
</p>
<p>grapb and this other one? Did he not say the upper part of the
</p>
<p>face resembled the photograph ?
</p>
<p>A. He said, in the first place, it did not look like Booth; and
</p>
<p>then he said it looked like bim across the eyes.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you tell him about your tracking Booth from Washington ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think, that, up to that time, I had mentioned Berth's
</p>
<p>name at all. It was not my business to tell bim who I was
</p>
<p>after.
</p>
<p>Q. The second time you went, Dr. Mudd was wlicrc ?
</p>
<p>A. He was out to some place : his wife sent after him.

</p>
<p>Q. Did not Dr. IMudd tell you, that, since you bad been there
</p>
<p>before, tlie boot h:ul been found V
</p>
<p>A. Not uutil we were in there a few minutes.
</p>
<p>Q. But he volunteered the statement, that the boot had been
</p>
<p>found since you were there before 1
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he said something to his wife ; and she went up and
</p>
<p>brought it down.
</p>
<p>Q. But did he not say, that, since you were there before, the boot
</p>
<p>had been found ?
</p>
<p>A. He said that after one of the men told him that we would
</p>
<p>have to search the house : one of the special officers said that.

<p>Q. Are you sure he did not state what I have asked you until
</p>
<p>after that was said ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He said he had shown those men the way across the swamp ?
</p>
<p>A. So I understood.

</p>
<p>Q. Is there a swamp immediately in the rear of his house ?

</p>
<p>house.
</p>
<p>Q. State, if you please, what else he said in describing those
</p>
<p>persons.
</p>
<p>A. I asked him if that might not have boon a false whisker ?
</p>
<p>He said he did not know. The reason I asked him was, his wife had
</p>
<p>said that the whisker became detached when he got down to the foot
</p>
<p>of the stairs. It seemed Booth had been up staiis. The doctor
</p>
<p>never told me he had Booth up stairs.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not say where he had been ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho told me he was on the sofa and lounge.
</p>
<p>Q. And when you asked the doctor how long these two men had
</p>
<p>staid, he said they did not stay long ?

</p>
<p>Q. What did he say ?

<p>A. I did not ask him if he had charged any thing. I asked
</p>
<p>him if the men had much money about them. He said they had
</p>
<p>considerable gi-eenbacks. I then asked him if tliey had arms about
</p>
<p>them. He said, " This injured man "  he did not say Booth 
</p>
<p>" had a pair of revolvers."
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say any thing about being paid for setting the leg?
</p>
<p>A. I did not ask him that. I did not ask him what he charged,
</p>
<p>nor any thing else ; but he went on to say it was customary for men
</p>
<p>to make a charge to strangers.

</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure it was not before he got to the house that he
</p>
<p>told you, that, since you were there before, a boot had been found
</p>
<p>up stairs ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he told me that in the house,  not outside.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not tell you there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there not a citizen with him at that time,  Mr.

<p>Hardy?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : no citizen that I know of.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there not one with liim ?
</p>
<p>A. There was a citizen stood in the door after he went in the
</p>
<p>house ; went in the front room : I did not pay any attention much
</p>
<p>to the citizen.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know who that was ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Dr. ]Mudd come to the house alone? Was he alone
</p>
<p>when you met him first as he was coming to the house ?
</p>
<p>A. There was a citizen walkmg with him, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it this man you spoke of who subsequently stood up Iiy
</p>
<p>the door?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. When you went to Dr. Mudd the first time, did you have

</p>
<p>Q. As soon as you asked if two strangers had been there, he
</p>
<p>told you they liad ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : ho was made awaie, I suijpose, of what we were
</p>
<p>after, by a friend of his.
</p>
<p>Q. Whatfi-iend?
</p>
<p>A. Dr. Mudd. They compeUed him to go from Biyantown
</p>
<p>along with us.
</p>
<p>Q. Wien you a.skcd him the que.slion, ho told you at onee that
</p>
<p>there had been two strangers there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he seemed voiy much excited, and got as pale as
</p>
<p>a sheet of paper when he was asked about it, but admitted it, 
</p>
<p>that there had been two strangers there.
</p>
<p>Q. Then you asked him to describe them, and he did give you
</p>
<p>the description V
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he gave the description.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Dr. Mudd present then, sir ?
</p>
<p>A. He was present part of the time ?
</p>
<p>Q. Between the time, though, of your asking him if two strangers
</p>
<p>had been there, and his reply to you, he had not left your prese'nce
</p>
<p>at all, had he ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sii- : he had spoken to the other doctor previous to that,
</p>
<p>though.
</p>
<p>Q. Who did he say introduced Booth to him at church last
</p>
<p>faU?
</p>
<p>A. A man named Johnson, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. He told you he was introduced to Booth at church by tliis
</p>
<p>man Johnson ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. He did not tell me that in the first place. Ho
</p>
<p>didn't know Booth at all.
</p>
<p>Q. This wa,s in the interview on Friday ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you a.sk him at the fii-st interview, on Tuesday, whether

</p>
<p>Q. But when, on the second interview, you mentioned Booth,
</p>
<p>he told you ho had been introduced to Booth last full ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not mention it until we were on horseback. I do not
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>267
</p>
<p>think he mentioned it until I had arrested him. I had mentioned
</p>
<p>Booth's name to the other doctor, thouoh.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that the doctor seemed to bo very much excited and
</p>
<p>alarmed ?
</p>
<p>A. He seemed to turn veiy pale, and blue about the Ups, like
</p>
<p>a man that is frightened at something.
</p>
<p>Q. Like what ?
</p>
<p>A. Like a man that might bo frightened at something he had
</p>
<p>done. I do not mean to say that he was afraid of us.
</p>
<p>Q. I suppose all you can say is, that he looked frightened and
</p>
<p>alarmed. Did he mention, in connection with his acquaintance
</p>
<p>with Booth, or the introduction he received to Booth last faU a man
</p>
<p>by the name of Thompson ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I am aware. Perhaps it might have been Tliomp-
</p>
<p>son, and not Johnson, that gave him the introduction. I min-ht
</p>
<p>have been that much mistaken in the name. I understood it tobe
</p>
<p>Johnson : it might have been Thompson.
</p>
<p>By the Jddge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. You state that Dr. Mudd appeared very much frightened.
</p>
<p>Had you or not addressed any threat to him of any kind ? 
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I was in citizen's clothes at the time. I addressed
</p>
<p>no threat to him.
</p>
<p>Q. The alarm, then, was not in consequence of any thing vou
</p>
<p>said or did to him ? > a j
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. He seemed very anions also. I got the boot
</p>
<p>out. Some of the other men .said the name of Booth was scratched
</p>
<p>out ; and I insisted upon it the name of Booth had never been
</p>
<p>written.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bixgiiam :
</p>
<p>Q. Who insisted that the name of Booth had never been
</p>
<p>Written ?
</p>
<p>A. I merely suggested that it had never been written there.

<p>Q. Who were with you in the pursuit on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>268 nil-: trial.
</p>
<p>A. Three special officers  Simon Callaghan, Joshua Lloyd,
</p>
<p>and William Williams  and some cavalry.
</p>
<p>Q. You say Dr. Mudd stated, when you asked if the men were
</p>
<p>armed, that one of them, the man with a broken leg, had a brace
</p>
<p>of revolvers ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say any thing about the other having a carbine ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say any thing about either of them having a knife ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you understand him to say that this brace of revolvers
</p>
<p>were the only weapons they had V  the party ?
</p>
<p>A. The injured man had a pair of revolvers. I had more con-
</p>
<p>versation with other parties in this house than I had with him (Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd) , because he seemed reserved. He did not seem to care much
</p>
<p>about giving mo information.
</p>
<p>Q. State what his manner was. Was it frank or evasive ?
</p>
<p>A. Very evasive. He seemed reserved in every thing.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not speak of these men having any other weapons
</p>
<p>than the brace of pistols of which you have spoken ?
</p>
<p>A. Not to me : because, when he answered that question, I turned
</p>
<p>around, and spoke to his wife ; and one of the others, one of the
</p>
<p>special officers, spoke to him about the other [weapons],
</p>
<p>Q. Which of the special officers?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was William Williams, if I am not mistaken.
</p>
<p>Q. Did I understand you to say that Dr. Mudd stated that he
</p>
<p>did not hear the news of the assassination of the President until
</p>
<p>Sunday, at church ?
</p>
<p>A. It was on Sunday morning, at church, as I understood him.
</p>
<p>Q. At the time he spoke of having heard uf the assassination
</p>
<p>of the President ou Sunday, did ho mention the name of the
</p>
<p>assassin 1
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>Q. Did not Dr. Mudd say that he only heard the circumstances
</p>
<p>of the assassination on Sunday 1
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 269
</p>
<p>A. I understood him to say tliat ho only hoard it on Sunday
</p>
<p>morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was present when he said that ?
</p>
<p>A. I think these other officers were iirosent.
</p>
<p>Q. At what interview was that V  the last one, or the first one ?
</p>
<p>A. That was the first one, on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not speak about his having heen at diurch, and heard
</p>
<p>the details of the assassination on Sunday morning ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect that he did. There was very little talk
</p>
<p>about the details. We hold very little conversation about the
</p>
<p>matter of the President ; in fact, I was thinking about what I was
</p>
<p>attending to at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not very closely attend to what he did say in regard
</p>
<p>to that ?
</p>
<p>A. Not in regard to that. I know I made the remark at the
</p>
<p>time to one of the officers, that he must have known it, because the
</p>
<p>cavalry was close to his house on Saturday ; and everybody in that
</p>
<p>neighborhood knew it on Saturday.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you certain that Dr. Jludd said any thing himself about
</p>
<p>those men going in the direction of Allen's Fresh V
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I am positive of that.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he mention it in connection with their going to the Rev.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wilmcr's?
</p>
<p>A. He s;ud they inquu-ed for Sir. Wilmcr's, and he took them
</p>
<p>to the swamp ; and they were going across the swamp towards Mr.
</p>
<p>Wihner's.
</p>
<p>Q. They inrjuired for Wilmcr's?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I went to Mr. Wilmcr's, and searched his house,
</p>
<p> a thing I did not like to do. I was satisfied before I searched
</p>
<p>it tliat there was nothing there, because I knew the man by repu-
</p>
<p>tation. I was satisfied it was only a blind to throw us that way.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether, in going from Dr. Bludd's to Mr.
</p>
<p>Wihner's by the shortest route, you would or would not cross the
</p>
<p>swamp ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : you can get that way across the swamp, because I
</p>
<p>went through it half a dozen times after that. It is not a very nice
</p>
<p>job, though.

<p>270 TDE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you follow the track of these men,  Booth and this
</p>
<p>man who was with him ?
</p>
<p>A. I tniclced thorn as far as I could.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you track them into the swamp and across it ?
</p>
<p>A. We went into the swamp, and scoured the swamp all over
</p>
<p>and across it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you find the tracks on the other side ?
</p>
<p>A. We found some tracks,  not imy track that would lead us
</p>
<p>to think it was this party.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. When you reached Mudd's house on Tuesday morning after
</p>
<p>the assassination, was it generally understood there that Booth was
</p>
<p>the man who assassinated the President ?
</p>
<p>A. Every person understood so around Biyantown, and along
</p>
<p>the way ; even the darkies knew it.
</p>
<p>Q. That was the common understanding along there,  that
</p>
<p>Booth was the man ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I was told by the darkies afterwards that they
</p>
<p>heard a gentleman say it was Booth was there, and that he had his
</p>
<p>leg broken.
</p>
<p>Q. Is there a telogi-aph down in that region of country ?
</p>
<p>A. The only telegiaph there that I know is the one that runs
</p>
<p>to Point Lookout. I do not know the exact distance to that
</p>
<p>place.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know the tclegraph-offiee nearest to that
</p>
<p>place ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. There was one established to Port Tobacco, went
</p>
<p>all the way down through. That is in connection with Port
</p>
<p>Tobacco. But if any person had seen these men, and wanted to
</p>
<p>give information, he had not far to go : they could have gone out
</p>
<p>to the road, and seen the cavalry all along the road.
</p>
<p>Q. 'WTiat is the distance from Washington to SuiTattsville ?
</p>
<p>A. About ten miles, I should judge.
</p>
<p>Q. What is the distance from Surrattsvillo to Dr. JIudd's?

<p>A. The way we fii-st went, it is about twenty miles. It is about
</p>
<p>sixteen miles to Bryantown, and about four or four and a half
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 271
</p>
<p>miles from Bryantown to Dr. Mudd's. But, going back tlie sec-
</p>
<p>ond time, I went across the countiy.
</p>
<p>Q. In going to Dr. Jludd's, did you go through SmTatts\'iIIe ?
</p>
<p>I A. Yes, sir : there is a road runs from Port Tobacco. You can
</p>
<p>go to it in that way,  two or three ditterent roads.
</p>
<p>Q. It is about twenty miles, then, beyond SuiTattsvillo to Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd's?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; that is, by way of Bryantown. I did not inquire
</p>
<p>the distances. I just found where the places were, and pitched
</p>
<p>ahead.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. I would ask permission of the Court to ask the
</p>
<p>witness a few questions, but not in reference to any thing asked
</p>
<p>in the examination in chief I do this simply to economize the
</p>
<p>time of the Court, and save calling him again.
</p>
<p>The Court having granted the permission requested, 
</p>
<p>By Mk. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with ]Mr. Lloyd, who keeps a hotel at
</p>
<p>Surrattsville ?
</p>
<p>A. I arrested him on the 18th of April. That was the first
</p>
<p>acquaintance I had with him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he make any statement to you at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : not at that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he subsequently ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did you arrest him ?
</p>
<p>A. On Tuesday, the 18th.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you take him ?
</p>
<p>A. I sent him back under a guard of cavalry to Roby's Post
</p>
<p>Oflice, where I had estalihshod a prison or guard-bouse.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there an examination made of jMr. Lloyd at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, SU-.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you present at any subsequent period when an esanli-
</p>
<p>nafion was made?

</p>
<p>of his connection with the affair ?

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate objected to the question. To lay a prop-
</p>
<p>er foundation for such a question, wliich is evidently designed to
</p>
<p>impoafii or contradict the witness Lloyd, that witness must first be
</p>
<p>interrogated as to the time, the place, and the words used. No
</p>
<p>such questions had boon put to Lloyd; and this question was
</p>
<p>therefore incompetent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken responded, that while there was no foundation for
</p>
<p>impeachniont, j-et, as the witness Lloyd had testified to having
</p>
<p>made remarks to Lieutenant Lovett and others on the occasion re-
</p>
<p>ferred to, those remai-ks were part of a transaction that occurred
</p>
<p>there ; and this witness was asked for his knowledge of that part
</p>
<p>of what occuiTed, but without any reference to what IMi-. Lloyd
</p>
<p>has said.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. The declarations of
</p>
<p>Lloyd are inadmissible for any purpose whatever at the instance of
</p>
<p>anybody, save for impeachment ; and they cannot be introduced
</p>
<p>to impeach, except under tlie rule stated by the Judge Advocate
</p>
<p>General ; to wit, ho nuist first bo asked if he said what is proposed
</p>
<p>to be proved, what lie said, and where and why he said it. There
</p>
<p>is no such foundation laid here.
</p>
<p>Mk. Aiken waived the question.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewino :
</p>
<p>Q. From whom did you first hear that there were two men who

<p>staid at Dr. Mudd's house?
</p>
<p>A. I heard it from a soldier.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know his name ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : Lieutenant Dana.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Dr. Mudd say any thing to you about it?
</p>
<p>A. When I sent for him, he did.
</p>
<p>Q. Then you heard it from Dr. George Bludd ?

<p>A. Friday, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He did, though, seem to be excited and alarmed on Tuesday;
</p>
<p>did he not ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think he was nmch alarmed on Tuesday, sir. Ho
</p>
<p>did not appear to be much excited.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he under arrest while this conversation took plape?
</p>
<p>Had he been actually arrested on Friday ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he was arrested directly that he came to the house.
</p>
<p>Q. Who made the arrest ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that any one in particular made it,  Lieuten-
</p>
<p>ant Lovett, I suppose : he being a commisioned officer, we submitted

<p>Q. You are sure that the arrest was made before this conversa-
</p>
<p>tion was held on Friday ?

<p>directly that we got hold of the boot, we made up oui- minds to arrest

<p>Q- Can you speak positively on that point,  whether he was

<p>A. I cannot speak positively of the lieutenant. I cannot say

<p>THE TRIAL. ogj
</p>
<p>what Lieutenant Lovctt said ; for I was out of the house part of the
</p>
<p>time, searching out-houses.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you present when any one arrested him, and notified him
</p>
<p>that he was under arrest ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say which one it was ; but I think it was Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Lovett.
</p>
<p>. Q. Were you present ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I was. I was sitting on the steps, I think, at that
</p>
<p>tune.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember what the terms of the arrest were ; whether
</p>
<p>he was ordered to report to Bryantown or not ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot state exactly what.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he placed under guard ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : wo did not place liim under any guard. He rode
</p>
<p>in between two detective officers, sometimes between me and another,
</p>
<p>and sometimes between the others.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any thing said about the razor on that Friday ?
</p>
<p>A. He brought the razor down himself, sir, and gave it to Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant Lovett : that is all I can say about the razor. I cannot say
</p>
<p>that I would know it if I saw it now. I paid no attention to it.

</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear any thing said by the doctor about how Booth's

<p>leg Was broken ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I think he said, if I am not mistaken, it was by the
</p>
<p>fall of a horse ; that a horse fell upon him. I had very little con-
</p>
<p>versation with him at all.

<p>By the Judge Advocate :

<p>Q. State to the Coui-t whether or not, some time durino' the week
</p>
<p>282 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>subsequent to the assassination of the President, you had an inter-
</p>
<p>view with the jiiisoner Dr. INIndd.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I had an interview with him, I think, on the 21st
</p>
<p>of April ; wliich was Friday.
</p>
<p>Q. State what he then said in regard to the men who called at
</p>
<p>his house on the Saturday morning after the assassination.
</p>
<p>A. I had three definite conversations with him.
</p>
<p>Q. State them, if you please.
</p>
<p>A. The first conversation, I think, occurred about noon, or a
</p>
<p>little after noon, on Friday. I sent and had the doctor brought to
</p>
<p>my hoadquai'tcrs, and took his statement. It was taken in writing.
</p>
<p>He said to me 
</p>
<p>Mr. EwiNG objected to any oral statement of what Dr. Mudd said,
</p>
<p>if tbe writing could be produced.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate exhibited to the witness a written paper,
</p>
<p>and asked, 
</p>
<p>Q. Look at that paper, and see if it contains the statement wliich
</p>
<p>he then made.
</p>
<p>A. This is a copy of one of the statements he made.
</p>
<p>Q. Which one V
</p>
<p>A. My impression is that this is the statement made at the sec-
</p>
<p>ond interview.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you a copy of the first statement?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I should state, that, in the first interview, the state-
</p>
<p>ment he made was not put in writing : but I think the second one
</p>
<p>was put in writing ; and the third one, I think, was not put in
</p>
<p>writing.
</p>
<p>Q. Now state what he said on the first occasion, which was not
</p>
<p>reduced to writing.
</p>
<p>A. Ho commenced by remarking, that on Saturday morning, about
</p>
<p>four o'clock, he was aroused by a loud knock at his door : he was
</p>
<p>surprised at the loudness of the knock, and inquired who could bo
</p>
<p>there. Receiving some answer, he looked, I think, from the win-
</p>
<p>dow, or went to llic door, and saw standing in his front yard one

</p>
<p>person holding two horses, and a second person sitting on one of the
</p>
<p>horses that he was holding. He described the appearance of the
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 283
</p>
<p>person ; saiil that lie seemed to be a young man, very talkative, and
</p>
<p>fluent in his speech. He said that the person on horseback had
</p>
<p>broken his leg, and desired medical attoudanco. He [the doctor]
</p>
<p>assisted in bringing the person that was on horseback into his house,
</p>
<p>and laying him upon the sofa in the pai'lor ; that after he had taken
</p>
<p>him in, and ho had lain on the sofa for some time, he was then car-
</p>
<p>ried up stairs, and put on a bed in what he called his front room ;
</p>
<p>that he then proceeded to examine the leg, and discovered that the
</p>
<p>front bone, the outer bone, was broken nearly at right angles across
</p>
<p>the limb, about two inches above the instep. It was not a com-
</p>
<p>pound fracture : it seemed as slight a breaking as oould possibly be,
</p>
<p>in his judgment. He said that the patient complained of pain in
</p>
<p>his back. He examined, and found no apparent cause for the pain,
</p>
<p>unless it might have been from his falling from a horse, as he said
</p>
<p>be had fallen. He said that he then dressed the limb as well as he
</p>
<p>was able to do it with the limited facilities he bad, and called a
</p>
<p>young man, a biretl servant,  a white servant, I think,  to make
</p>
<p>a crutch for him. The crutch was made. Breakfast was then pre-
</p>
<p>pai-ed ; and the younger of the two persons, the one who was not
</p>
<p>injured, was invited to breakfast, and took breakfast with them.
</p>
<p>He said, that, after breakfast, he observed the condition of his patient;
</p>
<p>that he seemed much debilitated ; pale to such an extent that ho
</p>
<p>was unable to tell what his complexion might have been, and hesi-
</p>
<p>tated whether to say that the skin was light or dark. After break-
</p>
<p>fast, the young man made .some remark in relation to procuring a
</p>
<p>conveyance to take his friend away. Ho said, that, in the mean time,
</p>
<p>he had been about giving some direction^ to his farm servants. I
</p>
<p>think he said they remained about the house until after dinner ; and
</p>
<p>some time after dinner he started with the young man to go down
</p>
<p>and see if a carriage could be procured at his father'.s house ; that,
</p>
<p>on the way, the young man did not stop at his [Dr. Mudd's] father's
</p>
<p>house, but he called his brother, the younger Mudd, found that the
</p>
<p>carriage could not be procured, and then rode on to join the young
</p>
<p>man who had gone ahead, and overtook him, and rode into the pines,

</p>
<p>not get his fi-icnd off in some way. The doctor said that he then
</p>
<p>went to the town, or near the town, I think; saw some friends or
</p>
<p>some patients, and rcturuod to his liousc ; that, as he came liac-lj to
</p>
<p>the house, he saw the person that he afterwards sappo.sed to be Horold
</p>
<p>passing to the left of the house, and towards thi; Iiarn or the stable;
</p>
<p>that he did not see the other person at all after he left him at the
</p>
<p>house, which was about one o'clock, I think. I should say here
</p>
<p>that he said he thought he returned to the house about four o'clock
</p>
<p>in tlio afternoon. I asked him then if he knew who the person was.
</p>
<p>He said that he did not recognize him. Speaking of the wounded
</p>
<p>man, ho said he did not recognize him. I then exhibited what was
</p>
<p>said to be a photograph of Booth; and he said, that, from the photo-
</p>
<p>graph, ho could not recognize him. He said, however, in answer to
</p>
<p>another question, that he met Booth some time in November. I
</p>
<p>think he said he was introduced by Mr. Thompson, a son-in-law of
</p>
<p>Dr. Queen, to Booth. I think he said the introduction took place
</p>
<p>first at tlio chapel or church on Sunday morning ; that, after the in-
</p>
<p>troduction had passed between them, Thompson said, " Booth wants
</p>
<p>to buy farming-lands ; " and they had some little conversation on the
</p>
<p>subject of lands ; and then Booth asked the question, whether there
</p>
<p>were any desirable horses that could be bought in that neighborhood
</p>
<p>cheaply ; that be mentioned the name of a neighbor of his who had
</p>
<p>some horses that were good travellere ; and that he remained with
</p>
<p>him that night, I think, and next morning purchased one of those
</p>
<p>horses.
</p>
<p>I asked him in that connection if he could now recognize the per-
</p>
<p>son that he had treated as the same person to whom he was intro-
</p>
<p>duced as Booth. He said he could. I asked him if he had seen
</p>
<p>Booth at any time after the introduction in November, and prior to
</p>
<p>bis arriving there the Saturday morning; and he said he had not. I
</p>
<p>asked him if he knew Herold ; and lie said he did not, and did not
</p>
<p>k-now that he had ever seen him ; that Herold mentioned the names
</p>
<p>of several persons living in that neighborhood whose acquaintance he
</p>
<p>had made,  a merchant by the name of 3Ioore, and some other

<p>persons there. I asked him then, if he had any suspicion of the chai^

<p>acter of either of these persons. He said he had not, but that he

<p>first thought there was something strange about them, when, shoitly

<p>TBB TRIAL. 285
</p>
<p>after breakfast, tbo younger man came down ami asked for a razor,
</p>
<p>and said his friend wished to shave himself; and that he went up
</p>
<p>stairs shortly afterwards, and noticed that the person he supposed to
</p>
<p>be Bootli had shaved off his mustache. He said, in answer to the
</p>
<p>question whether the man had a beard or not, that his impression
</p>
<p>was that he had a long, heavy beard, and, referring to my own, said
</p>
<p>that he thought it was longer than mine, but that he could not ob-
</p>
<p>serve him accurately enough to determine whether it was a natural
</p>
<p>or artificial beard ; that he kept a shawl about his neck, and seemed
</p>
<p>to conceal iutt'ntionally the lower part of his face. I asked him
</p>
<p>then, if he at this time had heard of the murder of the President.
</p>
<p>He said he had not. I think, however, he remarked to me in one
</p>
<p>of these interviews, that he heard of that for the first time either on
</p>
<p>Sunday morning, or late in the evening of Saturday. I think 
</p>
<p>so my impression is  that in any event it was after the persons had
</p>
<p>left his house.
</p>
<p>I then, getting the best description I could of the locality from
</p>
<p>him, went to the house of the doctor myself ; and I asked him what
</p>
<p>these persons said in relation to the route they wore to take. He
</p>
<p>said that Herold, the younger of them,  he passed by that name
</p>
<p>after the first explanations were over,  asked him the direct route
</p>
<p>to Piney Chapel, Dr. Wilmer's, saying that he was acquainted with
</p>
<p>Dr. Wihiior. He described the main travelled road, which leads to
</p>
<p>the right of his house, and was then asked if there was not a shorter
</p>
<p>or nearer road. He said, " Yes: there is a road across the swamp
</p>
<p>that is about a mile nearer, I think." He said it was five miles from
</p>
<p>his house to Piney Chapel by the dii-ect road, and four miles by the
</p>
<p>marsh, and undertook to give him (as he said) a description by
</p>
<p>which tlu>y could go by the nearer route. He said that the direc-
</p>
<p>tions were these : They were to pass down by his barn, inclining to
</p>
<p>the left, and then pass straight forward in a new direction across the
</p>
<p>marsh ; and that, on passing across the marsh, they would come to a
</p>
<p>hill. Keeping over the hill, they would come in sight of the roof of a
</p>
<p>barn ; and, letting down one or two fences, they would reach the direct

<p>they took, and followed the direction that he pointed out. I then

<p>286 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>went with Dr. Mudd ; asked him if bo could show me the tracks of
</p>
<p>the horses, the bay mare that ho described more partieuUirly. lie
</p>
<p>jjointed tlie track out to me : 1 took that track with him, and followed
</p>
<p>it fur a long way into the marsh, across the marsh on to a hill, where
</p>
<p>they turned scjum-e to the lefl, instead of going straight over the hill
</p>
<p>on to a piece of ploughed ground, and across the ploughed ground ;
</p>
<p>and there the trail was lost, because the ground had been ploughed
</p>
<p>around it. I believe that embraces the substance of the conversation
</p>
<p>between Dr Mudd and myself.
</p>
<p>Q. That embraces all that occurred in the several interviews ?
</p>
<p>A. There ai-e other detached things that occun-ed. For instance,
</p>
<p>the first time that I saw Mm, I did not know that a boot had been
</p>
<p>left at his house ; but the boot was brought in, and lie then said to
</p>
<p>me that his attention had been that morning called to the fact that the
</p>
<p>boot was left there; and he described the boot, and undertook to tell
</p>
<p>me how he had cut it to take the foot out.
</p>
<p>Q.- I understand you to say that Dr. Mudd stated distinctly
</p>
<p>that he had not seen Booth since that introduction in November
</p>
<p>last?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : until the Saturday morning when he arrived at his
</p>
<p>house.
</p>
<p>Q. And that lie did not recognize him?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : he said he did not recognize him at first; but, ou
</p>
<p>reflection, he knew it was the same person.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mn. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Did Dr. Mudd seem unwilling to give you this information ?
</p>
<p>A. Dr. Mudd's manner was so very extraordinary, tliat I scai'ccly
</p>
<p>know how to describe it. I will undertake, if you desire me, to do
</p>
<p>it as well as I can.
</p>
<p>Q. I wish you would.
</p>
<p>A. He did not seem unwilling to answer a direct question that I
</p>
<p>asked ; but I discovered almost immediately, that, unless I did ask
</p>
<p>the direct question, important facts were omitted.
</p>
<p>Q. Was lie alarmed ?

</p>
<p>A. Ho did seem very much embarrassed.
</p>
<p>Q. And alarmed?
</p>
<p>THE TJIIAL. 287
</p>
<p>A. I should think, not alarmed at the first or second interview;
</p>
<p>but I think, that, at the third interview, he was, frora some statements
</p>
<p>that I made to him.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time on Friday was the lii'st interview 1
</p>
<p>A. It was not far from mid-day : it might have been a little be-
</p>
<p>fore or after noon.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was it after Lieutenant Lovett had gone for Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot remember that : I am not quite certain. I do not
</p>
<p>think I sent Lieutenant Lovett to Dr. Jludd. Lieutenant Lovett
</p>
<p>had come from Washington by one route, and I had taken another
</p>
<p>one; and, as soon as I arrived at Bryantown, I sent for Dr. Mudd. I
</p>
<p>am not quite certain whether Lieutenant Lovett was sent by me at
</p>
<p>that time or not.
</p>
<p>Q. That was about noon on the Friday after the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. I think the day was Friday. I am a little indistinct as to the
</p>
<p>day ; but I think it was Friday. I think it was the 21st.
</p>
<p>Q. At that interview, there was no written statement made?
</p>
<p>A. Not at the first interview. I should say here that we kept
</p>
<p>talking for several hours. I deemed it of so much importance, that
</p>
<p>I kept talking with liim for a long time,  tried to get the facts ;
</p>
<p>and, after I thought I had a general statement of facts, I had it taken
</p>
<p>down in wiiting.'
</p>
<p>Q. Then you had him state it over ?
</p>
<p>A. There were at least a dozen interviews between us. I had
</p>
<p>him state it over.
</p>
<p>Q. When was the last interview ?
</p>
<p>A. The last interview was on Sunday, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have more than one interview on Friday ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes, sir ! He was in my presence almost the entire time
</p>
<p>for five or sis hours, talking here and talking there fi'om time to
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>Q. You said, that, at the last interview, he was very much alarmed
</p>
<p>from some statements that you made to him. What were the state-

</p>
<p>ments you made to him ?
</p>
<p>A. I said that it seemed to me he was concealing the facts, and
</p>
<p>that I did not know whether he understood that that was the strouK-
</p>
<p>288 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>est evidence of his guilt that could be produced at that time, and
</p>
<p>might endanger his safety.
</p>
<p>Q. When was it that you went off with Dr. Mudd, and he took
</p>
<p>you along the route that those two men took from his house ?
</p>
<p>A. One Sunday morning. I am quite confident of that.
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke of their going the direct route toward Parson
</p>
<p>WUmer's, or Piney Chapel V
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Parson Wilmer's is at Piney Chapel ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : within three or four hundred yards of the chapel.
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke of the tracks leading in the direct route towards
</p>
<p>Piney Chapel until they abruptly turned offV
</p>
<p>A. Tliere is no road. They took the direction pointed out by
</p>
<p>the doctor untU they came to the hill, with this exception : the
</p>
<p>marsh there is filled full of holes and bad places. I discovered
</p>
<p>from the tracks, as I thought, that they had got lost there ; and the
</p>
<p>reason was, that they had gone to the right to avoid a bad place,
</p>
<p>and then come back, and changed directions in that way untU they
</p>
<p>had lost the general dii-ectiou.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that the doctor said to you that he hoard of the as-
</p>
<p>sassination of the President either on Sunday morning, or late on
</p>
<p>the evening of Saturday.
</p>
<p>A. 3Iy impression is that he told nie he had "not hoai-d of it
</p>
<p>before Saturday evening or Sunday morning. I am rather inclined
</p>
<p>to the opinion that it was Saturday evening.
</p>
<p>Q. You think ho said " Saturday evening " ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he did.
</p>
<p>; Q. Did he mention how he heard it, and where ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I cannot say that he did. I have an indistinct im-
</p>
<p>pression on the sulijeet, though it is not worth much. It is that
</p>
<p>somebody brought the news from town,  from Bi-yantowu ; but
</p>
<p>I am not sure of that.
</p>
<p>Q. Or was it that he heard it at the town ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not sure whether he said that he heard it at the town,

</p>
<p>or that somebody from the town brought the news to him : I am
</p>
<p>inclined to think, the latter ; because I was told what expressions he
</p>
<p>made at church the next Sunday morning.
</p>
<p>THE TltlAL. 289
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say when it was that Thompson introduced him to
</p>
<p>Booth,  in what month ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho said it was in the foil ; and I think ho said it was about
</p>
<p>Novemljer.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say whether it was before daybreak that those two
</p>
<p>persons came to his house ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho said it was about daybreak,  about four o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ask him whether they paid him any thing for setting
</p>
<p>the leg ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not ask him that question myself; but it was asked, I
</p>
<p>remember, by some person.
</p>
<p>Q. What statement did he make ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he said twenty-five dollars.
</p>
<p>Q. That they paid him twenty-five dollars for setting the leg ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, I think so. I think that statement was made to
</p>
<p>one of the men who were with me, but not to me directly.
</p>
<p>Q. Did not Dr. Samuel Mudd say to you that he told Dr.
</p>
<p>George Mudd that there had been two suspicious men at his
</p>
<p>house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not say to you that he told that on Saturday evening?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot remember. I think not.
</p>
<p>Q. On Sunday morning 1
</p>
<p>A. No, sur. I think it was later than that ; but it is possible it
</p>
<p>was on Sunday, though I am not at all distinct as to it.
</p>
<p>Q. I mean to ask if he did not, in some one of your interviews,
</p>
<p>tell you that he had told that on Sunday to Dr. George Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. My impression is that he said ho told it to Dr. George Jludd
</p>
<p>on Blonday ; though I am not sure but that it was on Sunday.
</p>
<p>Q. You recollect distinctly his having said that he told Dr.
</p>
<p>George Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : he said that he told Dr. George IMudd ; and he said it
</p>
<p>in this connection : I said to him, " One of the strongest circum-
</p>
<p>stances against you is, that you have failed to give eai-ly informa-

</p>
<p>Q. Did he examine tbe likeness of Booth in your presence ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the pliotograpli.
</p>
<p>Q. Ho recognized that as a likeness of tlic man to whom he had
</p>
<p>been introduced ?
</p>
<p>A. My impression is, that ho said, that, from the photograph, ho
</p>
<p>could not recognize him.
</p>
<p>Q. As the man to whom ho had been introduced ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not say, that, from the photograph, he could not re-
</p>
<p>cognize it as the man who had his leg broken ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I think he said ho would not liavo known Jlr.
</p>
<p>Booth from the photograph. I think that was what he said ; and
</p>
<p>he said also, I think, that he did not recognize the man when he
</p>
<p>first saw him ; but, on reflection, he knew it was JL-. Booth, the
</p>
<p>person to whom he had been introduced.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not say to you tliat tliat was like a likeness which he
</p>
<p>had already seen of Booth, witli his name marked under it ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember that.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there not intense excitement in the town amono- the
</p>
<p>soldiers and the people ?
</p>
<p>A. The soldiers were not particularly excited. The people were
</p>
<p>generally excited. The soldiers were very active. The town was
</p>
<p>full of soldiers and people coming and going all the while.
</p>
<p>Q. There was a state of angry and excited feeling, was there
</p>
<p>not?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know tliat there was any angry feeling exhibited ;
</p>
<p>but there was an excited state of feeling undoubtedly.

<p>Q. Can you state what time Dr. Mudd professed to have recog-
</p>
<p>nized Booth as the man to whom he had been introduced V Was it
</p>
<p>during their stay at his house, or after they left ?
</p>
<p>A. It was during their stay at tlio house.

<p>Booth before he left.

<p>A. Yes, sir : his expression was, that he did not reeoguize him
</p>
<p>at first ; but, on reflecting, he remembered him as the person. I
</p>
<p>think that was about the expression.
</p>
<p>THE TltlAL. 291
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say that Dr. Jluacl's statomont was, that, when ho
</p>
<p>went to the door, there was a man standing, holding two horses, one
</p>
<p>of which had a man sitting on him ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not quite sure whether he said there was a man hold-
</p>
<p>ing two horses, or whether there was one horse there, and he was
</p>
<p>hokling one horse with the man on it. He was certainly holding
</p>
<p>one horee ; but, whether he said the man was holding the other
</p>
<p>horse too, I cannot be positive.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you at his house ?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. Could he ride near enough to the door to knock ?
</p>
<p>A. No. The doctor pointed out to me a cedar-tree at which
</p>
<p>they were standing ; and I should say it was certainly twenty
</p>
<p>paces.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he speak to you of one of the parties leaving on foot on
</p>
<p>crutches ?
</p>
<p>A. He said, that, as he came up,  he was going away from
</p>
<p>the house toward his fiu-m-hands,  he saw one of them hobblii
</p>
<p>through the yard. I think that was his expression.
</p>
<p>Q. \Vliat did he say became of the other horse ?
</p>
<p>A. Herold had been ritling the bay horse ; and Herold was
</p>
<p>going off on the bay horse : the roan horse was in the stable, as he
</p>
<p>supposed.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he find the horse at his house ?
</p>
<p>^ A. Not at that time, but subsequently. Both horses were at
</p>
<p>his house, and put into the stable.
</p>
<p>Q. But did those two men go away, and leave one horse ?
</p>
<p>A. Oil, no ! Booth was hobbling around from the house to the
</p>
<p>stable, which was perhaps a hundred yards from the house ; aud,
</p>
<p>as you get to the stable, you are lost to view from the house.
</p>
<p>Q. \\Tioro they took Booth's horse away?
</p>
<p>A. That was the unpression, though he said he did not see them
</p>

<p>292 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewinq :
</p>
<p>Q. Please state, as near as you can, Dr. JIudd's exact words
</p>
<p>wben he spoke of the reflection and recollecting, believing it was
</p>
<p>Booth who had been at his house.
</p>
<p>A. Do you wish me to state all that he said ?
</p>
<p>Q. All relating to that point.
</p>
<p>A. On showing hiui the photograph, he said that ho should not
</p>
<p>have recollected the man fnim the j)hotograph ; and he -said that he
</p>
<p>did not know him or remember him when he first saw him ; but
</p>
<p>that, on reflection, he remembered that he was the man who was
</p>
<p>introduced to him in November last, or in the fall.
</p>
<p>Q. Those were the words ?
</p>
<p>A. I will not quite say that they were the exact words, but as
</p>
<p>nearly as I can give them.
</p>
<p>Q. There was nothing but that in his conversation on that point,
</p>
<p>was there ?
</p>
<p>A. That was the substance of it. Of course it was .said many
</p>
<p>times over, and varied somewhat ; but that was the general tenor of
</p>
<p>what he said on that subject.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not say whether this reflection, on which he would
</p>
<p>recognize the man with the broken leg as the one to whom be bad
</p>
<p>been formerly introduced, was reflection after the man left or not ?
</p>
<p>A. It was, as I understood.
</p>
<p>Q. But he did not say ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he did say. He left the impression very cleai-ly on
</p>
<p>my mind that it was before the man left.
</p>
<p>Q. But you are unable to say that he said that ?
</p>
<p>A. Certainly. I am not able to say that he mentioned the pre-
</p>
<p>cise time when the reflection occurred to him, in so many words ;
</p>
<p>but I know what impression the general scope and tenor of his lan-
</p>
<p>guage left on that subject. He gave as a reason for not remember-
</p>
<p>ing him at first, that the man was very much worn and debilitated ;
</p>
<p>and he said that he seemed to make an elTort to keep the lower
</p>
<p>part of his face disguised ; aud that when ho came to think, reflect,

</p>
<p>he remembered that it was the man to whom ho was introduced.
</p>
<p>He did not, however, I think, say to me that that reflection or that
</p>
<p>memory came to him at any particulai- moment.
</p>
<p>THE THIAL. 293
</p>
<p>^ Q. Did lie speak of this disguise as having been thrown off or
</p>
<p>discontinued during the man's stay in the house ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not as ha-i-ing been discontinued. Of course the
</p>
<p>opening light of the day, the shaving of the foco, and the fact that
</p>
<p>he sometimes slept and then woke, gave the doctor, as ho passed
</p>
<p>into the room, better opportunities. That was the impression left
</p>
<p>on my mind. I do not think he said any thing to indicate that he,
</p>
<p>at any time, entii-ely threw off his attempt to disguise.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not say that he reflected that it was Booth during
</p>
<p>the time Booth was at his house ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I think I have said that he did not say that in so
</p>
<p>many words.
</p>
<p>By the CocET :
</p>
<p>Q. Did he, in any of his conversation, attempt to account to you
</p>
<p>for the fact that he had denied, in the first instance, any persons
</p>
<p>having been at his house ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remeinl)er that it was ever brought to my notice
</p>
<p>that ho did deny that a person had been to his house. He did not
</p>
<p>deny it to me, certainly.
</p>
<p>The Commission then adjourned until to-morrow (Wednesday)
</p>
<p>morning, 3Iay 17, at ten o'clock, a.m.
</p>
<p>Wednesday, May 17, 1865.
</p>
<p>The Commission again assembled ; and, when the record of yester-
</p>
<p>day had been read and approved. General Harris ro.so, and said, 
</p>
<p>I have in my hand a letter of the Hon. Reverdy John.son', on
</p>
<p>which my objection to him as counsel before this Court was founded ;
</p>
<p>and whilst I think the honorable gentleman ought to be very thank-
</p>
<p>flil to me for having made an occasion for him to disclaim before the
</p>
<p>country any obliquity of intention in writing that letter, yet in view
</p>
<p>of his age, and public relations to the country and to his State, I feel
</p>
<p>that it is due to myself and the Court that I should ask to have this
</p>
<p>letter made a part of the records of this Court.
</p>
<p>The President. There is no objection in my mind ; and I think
</p>
<p>it would be well for the Judge Advocate to read it.

</p>
<p>William Williams,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, having been duly sworn, testified
</p>
<p>as follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether or not, after the assa.'^si-
</p>
<p>nation of the Prciident, you were, with others, engaged in making
</p>
<p>pui-suit after the assassin "?

</p>
<p>Surrattsville, in company with some cavalry.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, in the course of that pursuit,
</p>

</p>
<p>A. We wont thereon Tuesday, the 18th of April. On arriving
</p>
<p>there. Dr. MudJ was not at homo ; but Mrs. Mudd told us she
</p>
<p>would send for him where he was in the neighborhood. She sent
</p>
<p>for him, and the doctor airived. We asked him if any strangers
</p>
<p>had been that way, and he said there had not been. On question-
</p>
<p>ing him about two men being at his house, one with a broken leg, he
</p>
<p>denied that any persons had been there. Some of the officers then
</p>
<p>spolce to him ; and T could not hear all. I merely asked him if any
</p>
<p>strangers had been there at that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you mention the time when you supposed the strangers
</p>
<p>had been there,  the day ?
</p>
<p>A. We did in the first visit.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any further conversation with him at a later
</p>
<p>period ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : not on our first visit.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say that he denied altogether that there had been any
</p>
<p>strangers there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>

</p>
<p>the man with the broken loj; ?
</p>
<p>TUE TRIAL. 295
</p>
<p>A. I believe it was one of the other officers.
</p>
<p>Q. Dill you bear Di-. JIudd reply to that remark ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not positive what his re])ly was. I know bo made a
</p>
<p>reply to it ; but I am not positive what it was.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he, ou that occasion, state to you when he learned for the
</p>
<p>first time of the assassination of the President ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. To the best of my knowledge, be stated that bo
</p>
<p>learned it at church on Sunday morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he eonver.se freely with you? Was his manner frank,
</p>
<p>or was it evasive 'i
</p>
<p>A. He seemed to be a little uneasy. He did not seem to be
</p>
<p>wilbng tfl give us any information, without being asked directly.
</p>
<p>Q. AVhen did you see him the second time?
</p>
<p>A. On Friday, the 21st.
</p>
<p>Q. State what occurred then.
</p>
<p>A. We went there for the purpose of arresting Dr. Mudd. On
</p>
<p>arriving there, BIrs. Mudd was there. She said the doctor was not
</p>
<p>at home ; but ho was in the neighborhood, and she would send for
</p>
<p>him. She sent for him. On his arriving in the house. Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Lovett, I believe, asked him a question first. I then asked him
</p>
<p>concerning those two men who had been at his house previously, one
</p>
<p>with a broken leg. He then said they had been there. Some of
</p>
<p>the other officers then asked him questions. I asked him also if the
</p>
<p>men at his house were not Booth and Herold. He said they were
</p>
<p>not. He said that he know Booth ; that he was introduced to
</p>
<p>Booth last fall, by a man by the name of Tliompson, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. And that was not Booth who was at his house?
</p>
<p>A. He said so. After we arrested hkn, on our way to Bryan-
</p>
<p>town, I showed him Booth's picture, and asked bun if that looked
</p>
<p>like the man who had his leg broken. After looking at the picture
</p>
<p>a little while, he first said it did not ; he did not rememlier the fea-
</p>
<p>tures : but, after a while, he said it looked something like Booth
</p>
<p>across the eyes. I informed Mrs. Mudd that we had to search the
</p>
<p>bouse. That was on the second visit. Slie then said

</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing : You will not say what Jlrs. Mudd said.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate : Any thing that was said in Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd's presence is admissible.
</p>
<p>296 THE TISIAL.
</p>
<p>A. This was said in Dr. I^Imlirs jircsciico, to tbe best of iny
</p>
<p>knowledge : I believe he was in tbe parlor. She said thatr^one of
</p>
<p>tlie men, tbe m;in with the broken leg, had left the boot in bed.
</p>
<p>This was when I informed her we had to search tbe bouse. She
</p>
<p>then went and brought the boot down. It was a long riding-boot,
</p>
<p>with the maker's name, Broadway, N.Y., marked inside, and
</p>
<p>"J. Wilkes." The boot was cut some ten inches from the in-
</p>
<p>step.
</p>
<p>Q. Did the prisoner, Dr. Mudd, state to you that he had set the
</p>
<p>leg of that man ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did be say they remained at bis house?
</p>
<p>A. He stated to me that they left about between three and four
</p>
<p>in the afternoon of Saturday.
</p>
<p>Q. Did ho .state at what hour they arrived 1
</p>
<p>A. Before daybreak.
</p>
<p>Q. Did ho state how they left,  whether on horseback or en
</p>
<p>foot ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho said that they went away afoot.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you understand her to say that iu his presence ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you understand her as speaking of one or both of thorn ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe it was Dr. Mudd who said tbe wounded man went
</p>
<p>away on crutches he had made for him by one of bis men.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Me. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Was Lieutenant Lovett present ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He was there both on Tuesday and Friday ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He was present at all the conversations you bad with Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; but I might have had some little conversation with
</p>
<p>Dr. JIudd going towards Bryantown, concerning the doctor, that
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Lovett did not bear.

</p>
<p>tions aliout the boot ?
</p>
<p>A. She was standing in the door of tho pailor and hall-way, I
</p>
<p>believe.
</p>
<p>Q. 'WTiere was Dr. JIudd then ?  in the parlor ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : to the best of my knowledge, be was sitting in the
</p>
<p>parlor on a chair.
</p>
<p>Q. Could ho hear what Blrs. Mudd said ?
</p>
<p>A. I judged he could : be was not farther from her than where
</p>
<p>you are sitting. [About nine feet.]
</p>
<p>Q. She was tho fii-st one who mentioned about the boot to you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I told her we were compelled to search the bouse.
</p>
<p>She then said that the man who had his leg broken left a boot in bed.
</p>
<p>Q. And she went up stairs, and brought it down to you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : we requested her to bring it down ; and she went
</p>
<p>up stairs and brought it down.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it on the Tuesday or tho Friday that he tnld you that
</p>
<p>the first knowledge he had of the assassination of the President he
</p>
<p>derived at church on the Sunday before ?
</p>
<p>A. It was on Friday, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any question asked him whether he had, or had not,
</p>
<p>heard of the assassination of the President on Tuesday ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not ; and it was not asked, unless some of the other
</p>
<p>officers did.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember that any one asked him that iu your
</p>
<p>presence ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. You were all together in one room ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or Lieutenant Lovett ask hira whether two stran-
</p>
<p>gers had been at his hou.se at any time previous ?
</p>
<p>A. I asked him ; and Lieutenant Ijovett asked him also, I be-
</p>
<p>lieve. I know that I a.skcd Dr. Jludd that question.
</p>

</p>
<p>A. T would not be positive as to that.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the reply that ho made to you the same that he made to
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Lovett ?
</p>
<p>298 THE rniAL.
</p>
<p>A. I think it was.
</p>
<p>Q. You fcL'l ccinGJent of tbat?
</p>
<p>A. His .reply on Tuesday to me was, tbat there had not lieen ;
</p>
<p>and I think it was tlic same reply ho made to Lieutenant Lovett.
</p>
<p>Q. If his reply to Lieutenant L;)vett had been different, as you
</p>
<p>were all together, you would have noticed the difference, would
</p>
<p>you not ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I would, because I did not hear the reply
</p>
<p>that he made to Lieutenant Lovett.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember, on the Friday examination, who asked
</p>
<p>him first, yourself or Lieutenant Lovett 'i '
</p>
<p>A. I think it was Lieutenant Lovett.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember whether he asked him whether two stran-
</p>
<p>gers had been there, or whether Booth and IlerolJ had been there ?
</p>
<p>A. " Two strangers," I think he said.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he answer to that on Friday?
</p>
<p>A. The question that I asked him was, if two .strangers had been
</p>
<p>there, one with a broken leg. That was on Friday. Dr. JIudd
</p>
<p>then said that they had been ; that he had set a man's leg ; that two
</p>
<p>men came there at daybreak, one a young man apparently seventeen
</p>
<p>or eighteen years of age ; and that they came to his door, and
</p>
<p>knocked at the door, and the doctor looked out of the window up
</p>
<p>stairs, and asked them who they wore. I believe their reply was,
</p>
<p>that they were friends, and they wanted to get in. Dr. JIudd then
</p>
<p>came down stairs, and, with the assistance of the young man, got
</p>
<p>the wounded man off his horse into the parlor, and examined his leg
</p>
<p>on the sofa.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ask him on Friday to describe the two strangers ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What description did he give ?
</p>
<p>A. He said one of them was about seventeen or eighteen years
</p>
<p>of age,  quite a young man. The other had a mustache and
</p>
<p>whiskers ; pretty long chin-whiskers. I asked him if he thought
</p>
<p>the whiskers were natural whiskers. Ho said he could not tell.

<p>A. I will not bo positive now wUetlior be did or not.

</p>
<p>A. I tbink be said tbat the injured man had a sbawl around bis
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. Did be describe to you tbo j-oungor man ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not ronioniber liis saying any thing about bis dress.
</p>
<p>Q. His height or general appearance ?
</p>
<p>A He said that he was a smooth-faced young man, about seven-
</p>
<p>teen or eighteen years of ago, as far as I can remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he, on tbat occasion, point out to you the direction by
</p>
<p>which they had left bis house ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho said, that, on leaving there, they asked liim the road to
</p>
<p>Parson Wilmer's, and tbat he had shown them the way down to
</p>
<p>the swamp. There is a swamp, situated, I should judge, a thousand
</p>
<p>yards back of bis bouse.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine for the horses' tracks ? Did be point out
</p>
<p>to you the road thoy had travelled away from his bouse ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : we examined the swamp all through from there to
</p>
<p>Parson Wilmer's.
</p>
<p>Q. iVnd did you find horses' tracks in the direction he pointed
</p>
<p>out to you ?
</p>
<p>A. We found horses' tracks ; but there were teams goino- that
</p>
<p>way. We found a road, and horses' tracks on the road ; but I did
</p>
<p>not come to any conclusion tbat they were the tracks of the horses
</p>
<p>these men bad. I did not pay any attention to going to Parson
</p>
<p>Wilmer's in the first place, because I thought it was to throw us off
</p>
<p>the track. The men did not go to Parson Wibner's.
</p>
<p>Q. But did you find horses' tracks on the road he pointed out
</p>
<p>to you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. This road across the swamp is not a much travelled road ?
</p>
<p>A. I judge not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did any of you, or you yom-self, go immediately from his
</p>
<p>house across the swamp ?

<p>A. After leaving Dr. jMudd at Bryautown,  it was on Friday,
</p>
<p> we came right back, and then went to go tbi-ough the swamp
</p>
<p>from there to Pai-son Wilmer's.

<p>300 TUE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Dill you not go across the swamp on Tuesday also ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You followed that road ?
</p>
<p>A. We followed the road as far as we could, and through the
</p>
<p>swamp there. Wc did not exactly keep to the road altogther. We
</p>
<p>looked all through the swamp.
</p>
<p>Q. You followed the road that Dr. JIudd pointed out to you on
</p>
<p>Tuesday also, did you not ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : we wont down that road. Wc did not keep on
</p>
<p>the road, though : wo divided ourselves in the swamp, and went
</p>
<p>through the swamp different roads.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you one of the party that went to Rev. Jlr. Wilmer's
</p>
<p>house ?
</p>
<p>A. Y^, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. \A'hat time did you get there ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was on Thursday, or Tuesday night : I will not be
</p>
<p>positive. I think it was late in the evening we got there.
</p>
<p>Q. You are positive it was one or the other of those times ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was.
</p>
<p>Q. Thi.s was in pursuance of what Dr. JIudd told you ? You
</p>
<p>went to AVilmer'a in consequence of his having told you that they
</p>

<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not you are acquainted with
</p>
<p>the prisoner Dr. Mudd.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>

</p>
<p>assassination of the President ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what inquiries were made of him there con-
</p>
<p>nected with your pureuit of the murderers, and what his replies
</p>
<p>were?
</p>
<p>A. We went there, I think, on the forenoon of Tuesday, the 18th.
</p>
<p>We went through Bryantown to his house. We went there, and
</p>
<p>we made inquiries if there were any two men passed there on
</p>
<p>Saturday morning : that was the Saturday after the assassination.
</p>
<p>He said, "No." Then we asked him more particularly if there were
</p>
<p>two men came there, one of them having his leg fractured. He
</p>
<p>said, "Yes." We asked him about what time. He said at four or
</p>
<p>half-past four o'clock on Saturday morning ; that they came to his
</p>
<p>door, and made a rap at the door ; that he was a little alarmed at
</p>
<p>the noise, and he came down stairs and let them in. I believe I
</p>
<p>understood him to say that he and the other person assisted the man
</p>
<p>with the fractured leg into the house ; and Tie attended to the frac-
</p>
<p>ture as well as he possibly could. He said he did not have much

<p>the sofa for a while, aiul, after that, was taken into one of the rooms
</p>
<p>up stairs, and remained there until between three and five o'clock
</p>
<p>in the afternoon of Saturday, and then they left there; and I
</p>
<p>believe he said that he went part of the way with them ; but, pre-
</p>
<p>vious to this, he went looking for a buggy with the other man to
</p>
<p>have him taken away, and could not find any. He then went with

</p>
<p>Allen's Fresh, and also inquired the way to the Rev. Dr. Wilmer's

<p>to show them the road. That is what I understood him to say.

</p>
<p>A. We went there for the purpose of arresting him, and searchinc
</p>
<p>his house. When we went there, he was not in ; and his wife sent
</p>
<p>for him. AATaen he came there, we infonned him that we would
</p>
<p>have to search his house. His wife then went up stairs, and
</p>
<p>brought a boot down staii-s. We esamiuod the Iwot, and found
</p>
<p>the words, "J. Wilkes" mai-kcd on the inside of the leg of it.
</p>
<p>She also brought a razor down stairs, whicJi one of our pai-(y took
</p>
<p>in charge.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you again repeat the inquiry then, whether he knew
</p>
<p>who these persons were 'i

<p>Cavalry, Company C. On the 29th of June last, I was wounded ;
</p>
<p>and I remained out of .cryicc until the 25th of October. I went

<p>A. No, the Blonday week following that we saw the wagon
</p>
<p>there. There were three of us together,  Lieutenant Buggies, a
</p>
<p>THE TlilAL. 309
</p>
<p>young man named BainbriJge, anil myself,  all on our way to
</p>
<p>Caroline County. We rode down to the wharf : but, just before we
</p>
<p>got to the wagon, we saw a man get out of the wagon,  apparently
</p>
<p>a young man ; and it seemed to us as if he put his hand in his
</p>
<p>bosom. We rode on down, did not pay any attention to it, passed
</p>
<p>by him, and went down on the wharf. I do not remember whether
</p>
<p>we hailed the ferry-boat or not. Anyhow, while standing there,
</p>
<p>this young man got out of the wagon, and came towards where we
</p>
<p>were, and asked us what command we belonged to. Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Ruggles spoke up, and said, " We belong to Mosby's command."
</p>
<p>I made no Jeply then myself at all. I do not remember whether
</p>
<p>there was any thing else said or not. Anyhow, he said, " If I am
</p>
<p>not inquisitive, can I ask where you are going? " I spoke up, and
</p>
<p>replied, "That is a secret where we are going." I did not say
</p>
<p>any thing more then, that I remember. We went back on the
</p>
<p>wharf again ;" and then a man got out of the wagon, and one of us
</p>
<p>(which one it was I do not know) asked him what command he
</p>
<p>belonged to. He said he belonged to A. P. Hill's corps ; that
</p>
<p>there were two of them by the name of Boyd. He said his brother
</p>
<p>had been wounded down below Petersburg, and asked if we would
</p>
<p>take him out of the lines. We did not say then where we were
</p>
<p>going. I do not remember now what was said then, if any thing
</p>
<p>was. Anyhow, Herold asked us to go and take a diink. None
</p>
<p>of our boys drank any thing ; and we declined. We rode up to-

<p>wards the house there. I got down, carried my horse in the stable,
</p>
<p>and tied him ; and the other two boys tied their horses near the
</p>
<p>shed. We all sat down there ; and Herold, after sitting down there,
</p>
<p>talking some time or a little while,  it was a very short time, 
</p>
<p>touched me on the shoulder, and said he wanted to speak to me ;
</p>
<p>carried mo down to the wharf, and he said, " I suppose you are
</p>
<p>raising a command to go South? " I did not know why he thought
</p>
<p>that. He said he would like to go along with us. I did not say
</p>
<p>any thing. After talking a little while, I said, " I cannot go with
</p>
<p>any man that I do not know any tiling about." He seemed very

<p>much agitated ; and then remarked, when we got down on the wharf,
</p>
<p>" We are- the assassinators of the President." I was so much con-
</p>
<p>founded, that I did not make any reply then, that I remember.
</p>
<p>310 THE Tn I AL.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Ruggles was very near, watering his horse; and I
</p>
<p>called to him, and he came there ; and either Ilerold or myself
</p>
<p>remarked to Lieutenant Ruggles that thoy were the assassinators of
</p>
<p>the President. Booth then came up ; and Ilerold introduced him-
</p>
<p>self to us, and then introduced Booth. Booth, I remember, had
</p>
<p>on his hand " J. W. B." We went back thou to the house, and
</p>
<p>sat there some time on the steps. Then we went across the river.
</p>
<p>Booth was riding Euggles's horse. Ilerold was walking. When
</p>
<p>wc got on the other side of the river, before they got out of the
</p>
<p>boat, I got out on my horse, and rode up to Port Royal, went into
</p>
<p>a house, and saw a lady. lie passed his name off t us first as
</p>
<p>Boyd, and said he wanted to pass under that assumed name.
</p>
<p>I asked her if she could take in a wounded Confederate soldier
</p>
<p> just as he represented himself to me  for two or three days.
</p>
<p>She at first consented. Then afterwards she said she could not.
</p>
<p>I walked across the street to Blr. Catlitt's ; but he was not at home.
</p>
<p>We then went on up to Mr. Garrett's ; and there we lefl Booth.
</p>
<p>Herold and all of us went on up the road then to within a few
</p>
<p>miles of Bowling Green. BainbriJge and Ilerold went to Mrs.
</p>
<p>Clark's; and Ruggles and myself, to Bowling Green. The nest day
</p>
<p>Herold returned to Garrett's, or that way ; and that was the last
</p>
<p>I saw of him.
</p>
<p>Q. Herold introduced Booth to you as his brother, by the name
</p>
<p>of Boyd, did he?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he afterwards change the name ?
</p>
<p>A. He afterwards told us that his name was Herold, and Booth's
</p>
<p>name was Booth. They kept the same name, Boyd, though.
</p>
<p>Q. Do I understand you to say that both tliese men, Herold and
</p>
<p>Booth, went to Garrett's ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. Herold did not go in ; but Bainbridge and Herold
</p>
<p>staid at the gate, and Ruggles and Booth and myself rode up to-
</p>
<p>gether. Wo loft Booth there, and thou came out to the gate, and
</p>
<p>met Herold and Bainbridge, and went up the road together.

</p>
<p>Q. You did not meet either of them afterwards '?.
</p>
<p>A. I mot with Ilerold afterwards ; with Booth I did not. Herold
</p>
<p>came uj) to Bowling Green the next day, and spent the day, and had
</p>
<p>THE TlilAL. 311
</p>
<p>dinner, ami camo clown that evening ; and that was the last I saw of
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where Ilerohl went from Bowling Green?
</p>
<p>A. I ilo not know. That was the last I saw of him. The next
</p>
<p>(lay, on Wednesday, he left at, I suppose, half-past two or three
</p>
<p>o'clock. Tiiat was the last I saw of him, except the niglit they wore
</p>
<p>caught, when I went down there ; and I saw him the next morning.
</p>
<p>Q. When you saw Harold the next morning, he was in the custody
</p>
<p>of the officers ; was he not 1
</p>
<p>A. He was.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or not, before this declaration that they were the as-
</p>
<p>sassinators of the President, make known that you wore in the Con-
</p>
<p>federate service?
</p>
<p>A. They saw that, because we were all dressed in Confederate
</p>
<p>uniform. I had just returned from Fauquier County, where I had
</p>
<p>been with Mosby's command in hopes of getting to my own regiment
</p>
<p>after the fall of Richmond. Wo had not then heard of the surrender
</p>
<p>of General Lee.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. This young man Herold wanted to aid Booth in getting farther
</p>
<p>South?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. That of course we could not do, because we had
</p>
<p>no facilities : at least, we did not do it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not seem to be a good deal disappointed when you
</p>
<p>could not do it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, su: : I think he seemed to be disappointed after wo made
</p>
<p>known to him what our object was,  that we were going over on a
</p>
<p>visit.
</p>
<p>Q. 'Was Booth present when you were talking with Herold ?
</p>
<p>A. Nut when Herold first told me that they were the assassinators
</p>
<p>of tlie President : Booth was not present then. Booth came up a
</p>
<p>few moments afterwards with Bainbridge, I think, or probably a little
</p>
<p>ahead of him, perhaps behind him ; I do not remember wliicli.
</p>
<p>Q. Did not Herold appear to be a good deal agitated?

</p>
<p>A. Booth remarlied that ho would not have done it.

<p>Q. Would not have done what?

<p>A. Would not have told. Booth said he did not intend telling.

<p>Q. Herold did teU V
</p>
<p>A. Herold had told when Booth came up.
</p>
<p>Q. Herold did not toll you that ho had killed the President ?
</p>
<p>A. No. He said, "Wo are the assassinators of the President ; "
</p>
<p>and then I think he said, " Yonder is the assassinator ! " pointing

<p>back to where Booth was standing.

<p>Q. You thiuk he may have used the word " we ; " but that he

<p>pected to find somebody else.
</p>
<p>Q. Go on, and tell your story in youi' own way.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 313
</p>
<p>A. I went into a room in a liotel at Bowling Green, and found these
</p>
<p>two men in bed. As I went in, one of them began to get up in the
</p>
<p>bed. I said to him, " Is your name Jctt? " lie said, " Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>Said I, " Get up : I want you ! " lie got up, and I told him to put on
</p>
<p>his clothes. He put on his pants, and came out to where I was in the
</p>
<p>front part of the room. I asked him, " Where are the two men
</p>
<p>who came with you across the river at Port Royal ? " I was sitting
</p>
<p>on a chair. He came up towards me, and said, " Can I see you
</p>
<p>alone?" I said, " Yes, sir : you can." Lieutenant Baker and
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Doherty were with me. I asked them to go out of the
</p>
<p>room. After they were gone, he reached out his hand to mc, and
</p>
<p>said, " I know who you want ; and I will tell you where they can be
</p>
<p>found." Said I, " That's what I want to know." Said he, " They
</p>
<p>are on the road to Port Royal, about three miles this side of that."
</p>
<p>" At whose house are they ? " I asked. " Mr. Garrett's," he re-
</p>
<p>plied : "I will go there with you, and show whore they are now ;
</p>
<p>and you can get them." I said, " Have you a horse ? "  " Yes,
</p>
<p>sir."  " Get it, and get ready to go ! " I said to him, " You say
</p>
<p>they are on the road to Port Royal ? "  " Yes, sir. ' ' I said to him,
</p>
<p>" I have just come from there." He stopped a moment, and seemed
</p>
<p>to be considerably embarrassed. Said he, " I thought you came
</p>
<p>from Richmond : if you have come that way, you have come past
</p>
<p>them. I cannot tell you whether they are there now or not." I said
</p>
<p>it did not make any difference : wo would go back and see. Ho got
</p>
<p>up ; had his horse saddled. We gathered the party around the house
</p>
<p>together ; went back to Mr. Garrett's house. Just before we got to
</p>
<p>the house, Jett, riding with mo, said, " We are very near now to
</p>
<p>where we go through : let us stop here, and look around." He and
</p>
<p>I rode on together. I rode, in the first place, alone forward to find
</p>
<p>the gate that went through to the house, and rode about as far as I
</p>
<p>understood him to say it was, and did not see any opening. There
</p>
<p>was a hedge, or rather a bushy fence, along the side of the road. I
</p>
<p>turned around, and went back to him ; and I told him I did not see
</p>
<p>any gate,  at any rate, within the distance ho named. Then we

<p>rode on, I should think three hundred yards farther, and then stopped
</p>
<p>again. Then we went  Lieutenant Baker and myself  to find it.
</p>
<p>Wo opened that gate, and went through. I sent Lieutenant Baker to

</p>
<p>open another, and I went liack for the cavalry ; and we rode rapidly
</p>
<p>up (o the house and barn, and stationed the men around the house and
</p>
<p>quarters. I went to the house, and found Lieutenant Baker at the
</p>
<p>door, telling somebody to strike a light, and come out. I think the
</p>
<p>door was open when I got there. Tlie first individual wc saw wa.s an
</p>
<p>old man, whose name was said to bo Garrett. I said to him, " AVIicro
</p>
<p>are the two men who stopped here at your house? ''  "They have
</p>
<p>gone."  "Gone where?"  "Gone to the woods."  "Well, sir,
</p>
<p>whereabouts in the woods have they gone?" lie then commenced
</p>
<p>to tell me that they came there without his consent ; that he did not
</p>
<p>want thorn to stay. I said to him, "I do not want any long story
</p>
<p>out of you : I just want to know where these men have gone." lie
</p>
<p>commenced over again to toll me ; and I turned to the door, and said
</p>
<p>to one of the men, " Bring in a lariat rope here, and I will put that
</p>
<p>man up to the top of one of those locust-trees." Ho did not seem
</p>
<p>inclinod to toll. One of his .sons then came in, and said, " Don't
</p>
<p>hurt tlio old man : he is scared. I will tell you where the men are
</p>
<p>you wantto find." Said I, " That is what I want to know : where
</p>
<p>are thoy?" Ho said, "In the barn." We then left the house
</p>
<p>immediately, and wont to the barn, and stationed the remaining part
</p>
<p>of the men. As soon as I went to the barn, I heard somebody walk-
</p>
<p>ing around inside on the hay. I stationed the men around it. There
</p>
<p>were two Garretts : by that time another one had come from some-
</p>
<p>where; and Lieutenant Baker said to one of the Garretts, "You
</p>
<p>must go in the barn, and get the arms from those men." I think he
</p>
<p>made some objection to it : I do not know certainly. Baker said,
</p>
<p>" Thoy know you, and you can go in." Baker said to the men inside,
</p>
<p>" We are going to send this man, on whose promises you are, in to
</p>
<p>got your arras ; and you must come out, and deliver yourselves up."
</p>
<p>I do not think there was any thing more said. Garrett went in ; and
</p>
<p>he came out very soon, and said, ' This man says, ' Danm you ! you
</p>
<p>have betrayed me ! ' and threatened to shoot me." I said to him,
</p>
<p>" How do you know ho was going to shoot you ? " Said he, " He
</p>
<p>reached down to tho hay behind him to got his revolver, and I came

</p>
<p>out." I then directed Lieutenant Baker to toll them, that, if thoy
</p>
<p>would come out iuid deliver themselves up, very well ; if not, in five
</p>
<p>minutes we would sot tho barn on fire. Booth replied, " Who are
</p>
<p>TBE TlllAL. 315
</p>
<p>you? what do you want ? wbom do you want ? " Lieutenant Balcer
</p>
<p>said, " Wo want 3'ou, and we know who yon are. Give upyouranns,
</p>
<p>and come out ! " I say Booth : I presume it was him. He replied,
</p>
<p>" Let us have a little time to consider it." Lieutenant Baker .said,
</p>
<p>"Very well; " and .some ten or fifteen minutes probably intervened
</p>
<p>licf ween that time and any thing further being said. He asked again,
</p>
<p>"Wlio ai-oyou? and what do you want?" I said to Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Baker, " Do not by any remark made to him allow hira to know who
</p>
<p>wo arc : you need not tell him who we are. If ho thinks we are
</p>
<p>rebels, or thinks we are his friends, we will take ad\-antage of it.
</p>
<p>AVe will not lie to him about it ; but wc need not answer any question
</p>
<p>that has any reference to that subject, but simply insist on his comin<r
</p>
<p>out, if he will." The reply was made to him, " It don't make any
</p>
<p>difference who we are : we know who you are, and we want you. We
</p>
<p>want to take you prisoners." Said he, " This is a hard case : it may
</p>
<p>be I am to bo taken by my friends." Some time in the conversation
</p>
<p>he said, " Captain, I know you to bo a bravo man, and I believe
</p>
<p>you to be honorable : I- am a cripple. I have got but one leg : if
</p>
<p>you will withdraw your men in ' line ' one hundred yards from the
</p>
<p>door, I will come out and fight you." Lieutenant Baker replied,
</p>
<p>that we did not come there to fight ; we simply came there to maka
</p>
<p>him a prisoner: we did not want any fight with him. Once more
</p>
<p>after this he said, " If you'll take your men fifty yards from the
</p>
<p>door, I'll come out and fight you. Give me a chance for my life 1 "
</p>
<p>The same reply was made to him. His answer to that was, in a
</p>
<p>singularly theatrical voice, " Well, my brave boys, prepare a stretch-
</p>
<p>er for me ! "
</p>
<p>Some time passed before any further conversation was held with
</p>
<p>him. In the mean time, I requested one of the Garretts to pile some
</p>
<p>brush up against the corner of the barn, pine-boughs. Ho put
</p>
<p>some up there, and after a while came to me, and said, " This man
</p>
<p>inside says, that, if I put any more brush in there, he will put a ball
</p>
<p>through me."  "Very well," said I: "you need not go there
</p>
<p>again." After a while, ]3ooth said, " There's a man in here wants

<p>to come out." Lieutenant Baker said, " Very well : let him hand
</p>
<p>his arms out, and come out." Some talk, considerable, passed in
</p>
<p>the bai-n : some of it wa.s he:u-d, some not. One of the expressions

<p>316 TnE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>made use of liy Booth to Ilerold, who was in the barn, was, " You
</p>
<p>damned coward ! will j'ou leave mo now ? Go, go ! I would not
</p>
<p>have you stay with me." Some conversation ensued between them,
</p>
<p>which I sup])osed had reference to the bringing-out of the arms,
</p>
<p>which was one of the conditions on which Herohl was to come out.
</p>
<p>It was not heard : we couhl simply hear them talking. IIo came to
</p>
<p>the door, and said, " Let mo out ! " Lieutenant Baker said to him,
</p>
<p>" Hand out your arms !" The reply was, " I have none." He
</p>
<p>said, " You earned a carbine ; and you must hand it out." Booth
</p>
<p>replied, " The arms are mine ; and I have got them." Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Baker said, " This man carried a carbine ; and he must hand it out."
</p>
<p>Booth said, " Uiwn the word and honor of a gentleman, he has no
</p>
<p>arms : the arms are mine, and I have got thera." I stood by the
</p>
<p>side of the lieutenant, and said to him, " Never mind the arms : if
</p>
<p>we can get one of the men out, let us do it, and wait no longer."
</p>
<p>The door was opened. He stuck out his hands : Lieutenant Baker
</p>
<p>took hold of him, brought him out, and passed him to the rear. I
</p>
<p>went around to the corner of the barn, pulled some hay out, twisted
</p>
<p>up a little rope about six inches long, set fire to it, and stuck it back
</p>
<p>through on top of the hay. It was loose, broken-up hay, that had
</p>
<p>been ^ I thought so from seeing it afterwards when I went in the
</p>
<p>barn  trodden upon the barn-floor. It was trodden down ; was
</p>
<p>very light ; and it blazed very rapidly,  lit right up at once. I put
</p>
<p>my eye up to the crack next to the one the fire was put through, and
</p>
<p>looked in ; and I heard something drop on the floor, which I supposed
</p>
<p>to be Booth's crutch. He turned around towards me. When I first
</p>
<p>got a glimpse of him, he stood with his back partly to me, turning
</p>
<p>towards the front door. He came back within five feet of the corner
</p>
<p>of the barn. The only thing I noticed he had in his hands when he
</p>
<p>came was a carbine. He came back, and looked along the cracks
</p>
<p>one after another rapidly. He could not see any thing. He looked
</p>
<p>at the fire; and, from the expression of his face, I am satisfied he
</p>
<p>looked to see if he could put it out, and was sati.?fipd that ho could
</p>
<p>not do it, it was burning so much. He dropped his arm, relaxed

<p>his muscles, and turned around, and started for the door for the front
</p>
<p>of the burn. I ran around to the other side ; and, when about half
</p>
<p>roiind, 1 heard the report of a pistol. I went right to the door and
</p>
<p>THE TlilAL. 317
</p>
<p>went in, and found Lieutenant Baker looking at liim, or holding hiui,
</p>
<p>raising him up, I do not know which. I said to him, " lie shot
</p>
<p>himself." Said^he, "No, he did not, either." Said I, " Where-
</p>
<p>about is ho shot?  in the head or neck?" I raised him then,
</p>
<p>and looked on the right side of the neck. I saw a place where the
</p>
<p>blood was running out. Said I, "Yes, sir: he shot himself."
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Baker replied very earnestly, that he did not. I said to
</p>
<p>him, " Let us carry him out of here : this will soon be burning."
</p>
<p>We took him up, and carried him out on to the grass underneath the
</p>
<p>locust-trees, a little way from the door. I went back into the barn
</p>
<p>immediately to see if the fire could be put down, and tried somewhat
</p>
<p>mypclf to put it down ; but I could not, it was burning so fast ; and
</p>
<p>there was no water, and nothing to help with. I turned ai-ound, aud
</p>
<p>went back. Before this, I supposed him to be dead. Ho had all
</p>
<p>the appearance of a dead man ; but, when I got back to him, his eyes
</p>
<p>and mouth wore moving. I called immediately for some water, and
</p>
<p>put it on his face ; and he somewhat revived, and attempted to speak.
</p>
<p>I put my car down close to his mouth, and he made several efforts ;
</p>
<p>and finally I understood him to say, "Tell mother, I die for my
</p>
<p>country." I said to him, " Is that what you say? " repeating it to
</p>
<p>hmi. He said, "Yes." They carried him from up there to the
</p>
<p>porch of Mr. Garrett's house, and laid him on an old straw bed or
</p>
<p>tick or something. At that time he revived considerably. He could
</p>
<p>then talk so as to be intelligibly understood, in a whisper : he could
</p>
<p>not speak above a whisper. He wanted water : we gave it to him.
</p>
<p>He wanted to be turned on his face. I said to him, " You cannot
</p>
<p>lie on your face ; " and he wanted to be turned on his side. We
</p>
<p>turned him upon his side throe times, I think ; but he could not lie
</p>
<p>with any comfort, and wanted to bo turned immediately back. He
</p>
<p>asked rao to put my hand on his throat, and press down, which I did;
</p>
<p>and ho said " Harder." And I pressed down as hard as I thought
</p>
<p>necessary ; and he made very strong exertions to cough, but was un-
</p>
<p>able to do so,  no muscular exertion could be made. I supposed
</p>
<p>ho thought .something was in his throat; and I said to him, " Open

</p>
<p>which he did. I said to him, " There is no blood in your throat :
</p>
<p>it has not gone through any part of it there." He repeated two or

</p>
<p>318 rUE TIIIAL.
</p>
<p>throe times, " Kill me, kill me ! " The reply was miule to liiin,
</p>
<p>"We don't want to kill you : we want you to get well." I then took
</p>
<p>what things were in his pockets, and lied them up in a piece of pa-
</p>
<p>per. Ho was not then quite dead. He would ^ once, perhaps,
</p>
<p>in five minutes  gasp : his heart would almost die out; and then it
</p>
<p>would commence, and, by a few rapid heats, would make a slight
</p>
<p>motion again. I left the body and the prisoner Herold in charge
</p>
<p>of Lieutenant Baker. I told him to wait an hour if he was not dead ;
</p>
<p>if he recovered, to wait there, and send over to Belle Plain for a. sur-
</p>
<p>geon fiom one of the gunships ; and, if he died in the space of an
</p>
<p>hour, to get the best conveyance he could, and bring him on, dead or
</p>
<p>alive.
</p>
<p>Q. You left before he died ?
</p>
<p>A. No : I staid there some ten minutes after this was said ; and
</p>
<p>the doctor who was there said he was dead.
</p>
<p>Q. I suppose you have seen the dead body since ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. [Eshibiting to the witness a knife numbered 28.] State if
</p>
<p>that is the weapon you took from him.
</p>
<p>A. I did not take it from him myself ; but that is the knife. I
</p>
<p>saw it taken.
</p>
<p>Q. It was taken by others with you 1
</p>
<p>A. Yes, SU-.
</p>
<p>Q. [Eshibiting to the witness a pan: of pistols.] Do you recog-
</p>
<p>nize these pistols as having been taken from him ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not examine the pistols with any care. I have no
</p>
<p>means of knowing that these are the identical ones ; but they were
</p>
<p>similar to these.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness a bolt, a holster, and a knife.]
</p>
<p>Do you recognize those '.'
</p>
<p>A. That is the belt and holster, and that is the knife taken from

</p>
<p>Q. [Exliiliting a spur.] Is that the spur ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot swear that it is positivel}' : I tiu-ncrl tlio spur over
</p>
<p>to Mr. Stanton ; and, if that is the spur that has been in his depart-
</p>
<p>ment, its history can be easily traced.
</p>
<p>Q. There was a spur ?
</p>
<p>A. There was a spur vei-y siraikir to that : I judge that to be the
</p>
<p>one ; but I cannot say so with certainty.
</p>
<p>[These articles were offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a carbine to the witness.] Is that the carbine
</p>
<p>you took there "?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that what is called a Spencer rifle ?
</p>
<p>A. A Sjicncor carbine. It is a cavalry weapon ; and it has a
</p>
<p>mai'k on the breech by which I know it.
</p>
<p>Q. Were these weapons loaded ?
</p>
<p>A. The carbine was loaded at the time, and the pistols were
</p>
<p>loaded. In 5Ir. Secretary Stanton's office, I unloaded this carbiue
</p>
<p>myself. Ilere are the cartridges that were taken out of it.
</p>
<p>Q. How many balls were in it ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not count them.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it fully charged V
</p>
<p>A. I should think it was. I believe there was one in the barrel,
</p>
<p>and the chamber was full.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting bills of exchange.] Examine these bills of ex-
</p>
<p>change, and see whether they are the same that you took from the
</p>
<p>person of Booth or not.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : they are. I put the initials of my name on them
</p>
<p>at tlio time ; but they are partly rul)bcd out : still they can be scon.

</p>
<p>Q. In what State and county was the house of Garrett, where
</p>
<p>Booth was captured and killed ?
</p>
<p>A. I think, Caroline County. It is in the State of Virginia, three
</p>
<p>miles south, or nearly so, from Port Royal, on the road to Bowling
</p>
<p>Green.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you or not recognize the prisoner Herold as the man that
</p>
<p>you took out of the barn on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. I do. [Pointing out David E. Herold.]
</p>
<p>Q. What articles did you take from Herold ? Any thing ?
</p>
<p>A. A little piece of a map of the State of Virginia, and a part of
</p>
<p>the Chesapeake Bay on it.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember whether that map embraced the region of
</p>
<p>country whore they were ?
</p>
<p>A. It did. It embraced that region of country known in Virginia
</p>
<p>as the " Northern Neck."
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a map prepared in pencil ?
</p>
<p>A. No, .sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a regular map ?
</p>
<p>A. Part of an old school map ; a map that had originally been
</p>
<p>five or six inches square.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a map.] Is that it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is it.
</p>
<p>Q. That embraces the region of country in which they were cap-
</p>
<p>tured ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. That is the only property I found on Herold.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at this pocket-compass. [Exhibiting a pocket-com-

</p>
<p> Cross-examined by Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. You did not find any arms on Ilcrold ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He seemed to have some conversation in the barn with Booth
</p>
<p>before lie came out ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you judge the nature of that conversation ? Did Ilcr-
</p>
<p>old .seem to be willing to surrender himself?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know any thing about it ; only the remark made
</p>
<p>by Booth to Herold.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not hear any other part of the conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. In that remark, Booth gpoke hai-shly to Herold,  called him
</p>
<p>a coward ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When the question was raised about Herold's delivering up
</p>
<p>the arms before he came out, I understood you to say that Booth re-
</p>
<p>plied that the arms were all his ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the interval that they wore together there in the
</p>
<p>barn, after you first notified thorn, before Herold came and surren-
</p>
<p>dered himself? What time do you suppose elapsed.?
</p>
<p>A. I think I looked as soon as I could conveniently ; and I
</p>
<p>believe wo got to the barn about two o'clock in the mornin"-.
</p>
<p>Booth was shot, and carried out on the grass ; so that there was
</p>
<p>time to look at the watch,  about fifteen minutes after tlu-ee : that
</p>
<p>would have been an hour and a quarter.
</p>
<p>Q. He was carried out almost immediately after he was shot, I
</p>
<p>presume ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : there was no time between it scarcely.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear Booth say any thing about Herold, besides
</p>
<p>what you have already stated? Do you remember hearing him

<p>Bay that Herold was not to blame ? Can you remember any thing ?
</p>
<p>A. I have an indistinct recollection of something of that kind.
</p>
<p>3'J2 THE T ni A L.
</p>
<p>I will toll you, as nearly .is I can, wliat it was. He said, " Tlere
</p>
<p>is a man in here who wants to go out," ami I think ho added,
</p>
<p>"who had niithiug to do with it."
</p>
<p>Q. That was, as near as you could rcmeniher, about the sul>
</p>
<p>stance of his remark ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think that is, as near as I can recollect now,
</p>
<p>what was said.
</p>
<p>Q. And, after that, Herold did come out ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you remember any thing else ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever seen Booth before ?
</p>
<p>A. I had seen him.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you able from any knowledge thus acquired to reeftg-
</p>
<p>nize him as the same person ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I think that I saw him, and remarked his resem-
</p>
<p>blance to his lirother ; and inquired who it was. I had often soon
</p>
<p>his brother, Edwin Booth, play in the theatre, and was told this
</p>
<p>was a brother of his.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you scon him in this city ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sii-.
</p>
<p>Q. And you were satisfied it was the same man?

</p>
<p>you arrived at the house.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>323
</p>
<p>A. Wlion we rode up to the house, my commanding officer.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Dohertj, as we were standing in the road, rode up to
</p>
<p>me, and told me that Booth was in that house, saying, " I want
</p>
<p>you to deploy the men right and left around the hoirJe, and see
</p>
<p>that no -one escapes." That was done: the men wore deployed
</p>
<p>around the house. After making inriuiries at the house, it was
</p>
<p>found that Booth was not in the house, but in tlio barn. A
</p>
<p>guard was then left upon the house, and the main portion of the
</p>
<p>men thrown around the barn, closely investing it, with orders to
</p>
<p>aUow uo one to escape, but previously being cautioned to see that
</p>
<p>our arms were in readiness for use. After being ordered to sur-
</p>
<p>render, and told that the barn would be fired in five minutes if he
</p>
<p>did not do so, Booth made many replies. lu the first place, he
</p>
<p>wanted to know who we took him for. He said that his leg was
</p>
<p>broken, and what did we want with him ? and ho was told that it
</p>
<p>made no difference. His name was not mentioned at all in the
</p>
<p>whole afiair; not giving them satisfaction to know whether we
</p>
<p>know who they were or not, any further than he was told tliat they
</p>
<p>must sun-ender, and give themselves up as prisoners. He wanted
</p>
<p>to know where we would take them if they would give themselves
</p>
<p>up as prisoners. He received no satisfaction, but was told that
</p>
<p>he must surrender unconditionally, or else the barn would be fired.
</p>
<p>The parley ksted much longer than the time first set ; probably I
</p>
<p>should think, a full half-hour. I could not say whether it was ex-
</p>
<p>actly that time, more or less ; but it was time for many words to and
</p>
<p>fro : he was positively declaring that he would not surrender. At
</p>
<p>one time be made the remark, " Well, my brave boys, you can
</p>
<p>projiarc a stretcher for me ; " and at another time, " Well, captain,
</p>
<p>make quick work of it; shoot me through the heart ! " or words to
</p>
<p>that effect; and thereby I knew that he was perfectly desperate,
</p>
<p>and did not expect that he would surrender. After a while, we
</p>
<p>heard the whispering of another person, although he [Booth] had
</p>
<p>previously declared that there was but one there, himself, who

</p>
<p>proved to be the prisoner Herold. Although we could not distin-'
</p>
<p>guish the words, his object seemed to be to persuade Booth to sur-
</p>
<p>render. After hearing him, probably, a while, he sang out, " Cer-
</p>
<p>tainly ! " seeming to disdain to do it himself. Said he, " Cap., there
</p>
<p>324 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>is a man in horo who wants to surrender migTity had." Then I
</p>
<p>snppnso words followed inside that we could not hear. Perhaps
</p>
<p>Herold thought ho had better stand hy him, or something to that
</p>
<p>effect. Then Booth said, "Oh! go out, and save yourself, my hoy,
</p>
<p>if you can : " and then he said, " I declare before my IMakor that
</p>
<p>this man here is innocent of any crime whatever ; " seeming willing
</p>
<p>to take all the blame on himself, and trying to clear Herold. They
</p>
<p>were then told, that, if both would not suiTcnder, the surrender of
</p>
<p>one of them woidd be accepted ; and he was told to hand out
</p>
<p>his amis. Herold deelai-ed that he had no arms ; and Booth de-
</p>
<p>clared that the arms all belonged to him ; that the other man was
</p>
<p>unarmed. Ho was finally taken out without his arms. Immedi-
</p>
<p>ately after Herold being taken out, the detective, 3Ir. Conger, came
</p>
<p>from that side of the barn where he had been taken out, around to
</p>
<p>the side where I was, and, passing me, set fire to the hay through
</p>
<p>one of the cracks of the boards, at the end of the same side of the
</p>
<p>barn where I was, a little to my right. I had previously said to
</p>
<p>Mr. Conger, though, and also to my commanding officer, that the
</p>
<p>position in which I stood left me in front of a large crack,  yqu
</p>
<p>might put your hand through it ; and I knew that Booth could
</p>
<p>distinguish me and others through these cracks in the barn, and
</p>
<p>could pick us off if he chose to do so. In fact, he made a remark
</p>
<p>to that effect at one time. Said he, " Cap., I could have picked
</p>
<p>off three or four of your men already if I wi.?hcd to do so. Draw
</p>
<p>your men off fifty yards, and I will come out," or such words.
</p>
<p>Ho used such words many times. Wlicn the fire was fir-^lit, which
</p>
<p>was almost immediately after Herold was taken out of the barn,
</p>
<p>as the flame rose, he was seen. We could then distinguLsh him,
</p>
<p>apparently, I think, about the middle of the bam, turning towards
</p>
<p>the fire, either to put the fire out, or else to shoot the one who
</p>
<p>started it, I did not know which ; but he was then coming right
</p>
<p>towards mc, as it wore, a little to my right,  a full front breast
</p>
<p>view. I covild have shot him then much easier than the time I
</p>
<p>afterwards did ; but as long as he was there, making no demonstra-

</p>
<p>tion to hurt any one, I did not shoot him, but kept my eye upon
</p>
<p>him steadily. Finding the fire gaining upon him, he tinned to the
</p>
<p>other side of the barn, and got towai-ds where the door was; and.
</p>
<p>TBE TRIAL. 325
</p>
<p>as he got there, I saw him make a movement upwards the floor. I
</p>
<p>supposed he was going to fight his way out. One of the men who
</p>
<p>was watching toUl mo that he aimed the carbine at him. He was
</p>
<p>taking aim with the carbine, but at whom I could not say. My
</p>
<p>mind was upon him attentively to see that he did no harm ; and,
</p>
<p>when I became impressed that it was time, I shot him. I took
</p>
<p>steady aim on my ai-m, and shot him through a large crack in the
</p>
<p>barn. When he was brought out, I found tliat the wound was
</p>
<p>made in the neck a little back of the eaj, and came out a little
</p>
<p>higher up on the other side of the head. He lived, I should think,
</p>
<p>until about seven o'clock that morning : I could not say whether
</p>
<p>after or before, but near seven o'clock, one way or the other ; per-
</p>
<p>haps two or three hours after he was shot. I did not myself hear
</p>
<p>him speak a word after he was shot, except a cry or shout as he
</p>
<p>fell. Others, who were near him, and watching him constantly,
</p>
<p>said that he did utter the words which were published. I did not
</p>
<p>hear him speak a word audibly after I shot him.
</p>
<p>Q. What time did he die ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was about seven o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not you recognize the prisoner
</p>
<p>Herold as the man you took out of the bam ?
</p>
<p>A. That is the man. [Pointing to David E. Herold, one of
</p>
<p>the prisoners.]
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know Booth before ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I had never seen him before ; but I was perfectly
</p>
<p>satisfied from his first remarks that it was him ; for my commanding
</p>
<p>officer told me, while on the boat coming down to Belle Plain, that
</p>
<p>his leg was broken ; and, when ho was summoned to surrender, his
</p>
<p>first reply was that his leg was broken, and he was alone. I knew
</p>
<p>also from his desperate replies that he would not be taken alive,
</p>
<p>and such remarks, that it was Booth. I knew that nt) other man
</p>
<p>would act in such a way.

<p>Q. And upon Booth refusing to surrender, he seemed, you
</p>
<p>judged, to desire to stiiy with him V
</p>
<p>A. I rather tliouglit so.
</p>
<p>Q. It was after that that Booth made the declaration that you
</p>
<p>have mentioned ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot certainly say whether it was after or before ; but I
</p>
<p>I am very positive that ho made the declaration that the man with
</p>
<p>him was innocent of any crime whatever j that he declared it be-
</p>
<p>fore his Maker, usin^ those words. I wish to state here, as im.-
</p>
<p>proper motives have been imputed to me for the act I did, that I
</p>
<p>twice oflered to my commanding officer. Lieutenant Doherty, and
</p>
<p>once to Mr. Conger, to go in the barn and take the man, sayin"
</p>
<p>that I was not afraid to go in and take him ; it was less dangerous
</p>
<p>to go in and fight him than to stand before a crack, exposed to his
</p>
<p>fire, where I could not see him, although he could see me : but I
</p>
<p>was not sent in. Immediately when the fire was lit, our positions
</p>
<p>were reversed : I could see him, but he could not see me. It was
</p>
<p>not through fear at all that I shot him, but because it was my im-
</p>
<p>pression that it was time the man was shot ; for I thought he would
</p>
<p>do harm to our men in tiying to fight his way through that den if
</p>
<p>I did not.

</p>
<p>Q. What was he doing at the stable then?
</p>
<p>A. He came to the stablo with another gentleman, on the 3d of
</p>
<p>TnE thial. 307
</p>
<p>April, between six and seven o'clock, witli two horses, and inquired
</p>
<p>for Jlr. Najlor. I told him that Mr. Niiylor was out, and asked
</p>
<p>Lira what did they want particular. He said tliey wanted to put up
</p>
<p>the horses there at the stable. I told him I attended to that busi-
</p>
<p>ness. They came in ; and I ordered the horses down into the stal)le
</p>
<p>to bo put in. Tlie other gentleman that was with Atzcrodt told uie
</p>
<p>that he was going to Philadelphia, and that he would leave the sale
</p>
<p>of his horse to Atzcrodt. I have never seen that man since. Atze-
</p>
<p>rodt kept the horses at the stable. He sold one of thorn to Tiionip-
</p>
<p>son, the stage-contractor. He kept the brown horse at the stable
</p>
<p>until the 12th of the month. On the 12th of April, he took the
</p>
<p>horse away. I did not see them afterwards until one o'clock on the
</p>
<p>14th of April, when he came into the stable witli a dark-bay mare.
</p>
<p>I asked him what he had done with the brown horse ; and he told
</p>
<p>me that he had sold him in Montgomery County, with the saddle
</p>
<p>and bridle, and had bought this mare, saddle, and bridle. He then
</p>
<p>told me to put up that mare in the stable ; and I did so.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you describe the appearance of that horse? Was he
</p>
<p>blind of one eye ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir-. He was a very heavy, common work-horse, blind
</p>
<p>of one eye.
</p>
<p>Q. What color?
</p>
<p>A. A dark-brown horse, with a heavy tail,- the mane was not
</p>
<p>very heavy,  and with heavy fetlocks down to the feet.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that the horse he brought back with the marc on the
</p>
<p>12th of April ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : that was the horse he took away on the 12th.
</p>
<p>Q. Proceed with your statement.
</p>
<p>A. I went to supper at half-past six o'clock on the 14th ; and,
</p>
<p>when I came back from supper, the colored boys had this mare right
</p>
<p>at the carriage-house door, with a saddle and bridle on her. He
</p>
<p>paid the colored boys fifty cents for her keeping. He said that was
</p>
<p>light, and I told him yes. Said- he, "If I stay until morning,
</p>
<p>how much are you going to charge me again v '"  " Only fifty cenis

</p>
<p>more," said I. He went out, and staid out about three-quarters of
</p>
<p>an hour, and returned back again with the same mare. He told me
</p>
<p>not to take the saddle or bridle off that mare untU ten o'clock, and
</p>
<p>328 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>to keep the stable open for him. I toU him yes : I would be there
</p>
<p>at that time myself. At ten o'clock, he came after the mare. Ke
</p>
<p>asked me to have something to diink with him. I told him I had
</p>
<p>no objection ; and he and I went down to the Union Hotel, at tho
</p>
<p>corner of Thirteen and a Half and E Streets. He asked mc what I
</p>
<p>would have. I tolil him I would have a glass of beer. He took
</p>
<p>some whiskey. Returning to the stable again, he said to me, " If
</p>
<p>this thing happens to-night, you will hear of a present." He seemed
</p>
<p>to me as if he was about half tight ; and I did not pay much atten-
</p>
<p>tion to him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say that you would hear of a present, or hear of tho
</p>
<p>President ?
</p>
<p>A. Of a present.
</p>
<p>Q. That is, that you would get a present ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : something that way. I was not paying much
</p>
<p>attention to him. We then went back to the stable toirether, and
</p>
<p>ho mounted the mare. I said, " I would not like to ride that mare
</p>
<p>through the city in the night; for she looks so skittish-looking."
</p>
<p>" Well," said he, " she is good upon the retreat." I then said to
</p>
<p>him, " Your accquaintance is staying out very late with our horse."
</p>
<p>That was Horold. " Oh ! " .said he, " he will be back after a while."
</p>
<p>I watched him then until he went down E Street, passed Tliirtcon
</p>
<p>and a Half Street ; and I followed him down. I saw him go in the
</p>
<p>Kirkwood House. I watched until he came out, and mounted tho
</p>
<p>mare again. He went along D Street, and turned on Tenth Street,
</p>
<p>to the left of D Street and Tenth. I returned back to the stable
</p>
<p>again. I did not go into the office, but staid at the carriago-
</p>
<p>house door. I was thinking about liini living so far away, anil the
</p>
<p>horse I had hired to Herold ; and I had a suspicion of the party,
</p>
<p>that they were taking the horse away. I went across E Street again,
</p>
<p>and went up Fourteenth Street until I camo upon Pcnnsylvani:i
</p>
<p>Avenue close to Willard's; and then I saw Hoi-oM riding tho roan
</p>
<p>horse belonging to Mr. Naylor that I had hired him. Tho horse
</p>
<p>seemed as if he wanted to go to the stable. I tliought, if I could

<p>get close enough to him, that I would take tho horse from him ; but
</p>
<p>I expect he knew me by the light of the gas,  the lamp ut \V'il!aid'3
</p>
<p>corner. He began to move tho horse away a little. Said I, " Vou
</p>
<p>TBE TRIAL. 329
</p>
<p>get off that horse now ! you have had that horse out long cnovigh."
</p>
<p>He put spurs into the horse, and went up Fourteenth Street. I
</p>
<p>kept sight of him until he turned to the east of F Street. I then
</p>
<p>returned to the stable for a saddle and bridle and horse myself. I
</p>
<p>got a horse, and went along the avenue until I came to Thirteenth
</p>
<p>Street ; went up Thirteenth Street to E, along E until I came to
</p>
<p>Ninth, and turned down Ninth Street to Pennsylvania Avenue
</p>
<p>again. I went along the avenue to the south side of the Capitol. . I
</p>
<p>there met a gentleman coming down ; and I asked him if he saw
</p>
<p>any men going up there, riding on horseback. lie said yes, and
</p>
<p>that they were riding very fast. I did not ask him any more ques-
</p>
<p>tions. I followed on until I got to the Navy- Yard Bridge ; and the
</p>
<p>guard there halted me, and called for the sergeant of the guard of
</p>
<p>the heavy artillery, and he came out. I asked him if a roan horse
</p>
<p>had crossed that bridge, giving him a description of the horse, sad-
</p>
<p>dle, and biidle, and the man that was riding the horse. He said,
</p>
<p>"Yes: he has gone across the bridge." Said I, "Did he stay
</p>
<p>long here?" He replied, "He said that he was waiting for an
</p>
<p>acquaintance of his that was coming on ; but he did not wait ; and
</p>
<p>another man came riding a bay horse or a bay mare, I do not know
</p>
<p>which, right after him." Said I to the sergeant, " Did he tell you
</p>
<p>his name?"  "Yes," said he: "he said his name was Smith."
</p>
<p>I asked the sergeant if I could cross the bridge after them. He
</p>
<p>said, " Yes : you can cross the bridge ; but you cannot return back."
</p>
<p>I said, " If that is so, I will not go." So I turned around, and
</p>
<p>came back to the city again. Wlien I came to Third Street, I
</p>
<p>looked at my watch, and it wanted ten minutes to twelve. I rode
</p>
<p>pretty fast going down to the Navy Yard ; but I rode slow coming
</p>
<p>back. I went along E Street until I got to Fourteenth Street, and
</p>
<p>inquired of the foreman at Murphy's stable, by the name of Dor-
</p>
<p>sey, whether this roan horse had been put up there. Ho said, " No."
</p>
<p>But said he, " You had better keep in ; for President Lincoln is
</p>
<p>shot, and Secretary Seward is almost dead." I thou returnoil to
</p>
<p>the stiible, put up the horse, came outside of the office-window, and

<p>sat down there : it was half-past one o'clock. There were people

<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>inz
</p>
<p>of Atzcrodt leaving tlio stable so late at night, and Ilcrold liavi
</p>
<p>the horse, I had a suspicion of the party. I went across E Street
</p>
<p>again into Fourteenth Street, and asked a cavalry sergeant if they
</p>
<p>had picked up any horses. He told me that they had ])icked up
</p>
<p>some horses, and for me to go down to the police-office on Tenth
</p>
<p>Street. So I wont down Tenth Street to the ]iolice-office, and met
</p>
<p>with a detective there by the name of Charley Stone, and called him
</p>
<p>to one side, and asked him if they had picked up any horses of such
</p>
<p>a description. He told me there were some horses up at General
</p>
<p>Augur's headquarters, and asked me who 1 hired the horse to ; and
</p>
<p>I told him. I told him the time he left the stable. He then asked
</p>
<p>me to go along with him to General Augur's office. We went there
</p>
<p>together ; and, when wo wont into the office. General Augur asked
</p>
<p>mo if I knew the man that I hired the horse to. I told him I did.
</p>
<p>I gave him the name of Ilerold, his description, and his age, as far
</p>
<p>as I could judge, and told him that I had pursued him to the Navy-
</p>
<p>Yard Bridge. There was a saddle and bridle lying right close to his
</p>
<p>de.xk in the office, and that was Atzerodt's saddle and bridle; for he
</p>
<p>came for his horse many days while the colored boys were at dinner,
</p>
<p>and I would saddle and bridle the horse for him. General Aun-ur
</p>
<p>asked what kind of a horse had that saddle and bridle on. I told
</p>
<p>him a big, brown horse, bhnd of one eye ; a heavy horse, with a
</p>
<p>heavy tail ; a kind of a pachig horse. He asked me did I know
</p>
<p>that man's [Atzerodt's] name. I told him that 1 did not know his
</p>
<p>name, but I had it at the office. He sent the detective, Charley Stone,
</p>
<p>with me down to the office ; and I wont into the office, and got his
</p>
<p>name right upon one of our cai-ds, and brought it up, and gave it to
</p>
<p>the general.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a saddle and bridle to the witness.] Will you
</p>
<p>look at that saddle and bridle, and see if they are the same that
</p>
<p>belonged to the horse that iVtzerodt rode on that night ?

<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>[The saddle and bridle were offered in evidence without olyectioa.]
</p>
<p>Q. Did he call that night precisely at ten ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he came to the minute of ton.
</p>
<p>Q. You kept the horse, saddle, and bridle waiting for him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember whether ho made any remark about
</p>
<p>something strange or wonderful likely to happen that night,  if he
</p>
<p>said any thing on that subject?
</p>
<p>A. He told me, " If this thing happens to-night, you will hear
</p>
<p>of a present."
</p>
<p>Q. Had you been talking about any thing before that ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; but he seemed very excited-looking : nothing more
</p>
<p>than that.
</p>
<p>Q. When you last saw him, was he going up Tenth Street?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it iu the dii-ection of Ford's Theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sii-.
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke of Herold having a horse from your stable ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he hii-od a horse from me.
</p>
<p>Q. When did he hire that horse ?
</p>
<p>A. On the 14th of April.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time in the day?
</p>
<p>A. I guess it wanted about a quarter to one o'oiock.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he hire it for any given time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he engaged the horse, and told me to keep it for
</p>
<p>him ; that he would be after it at four o'clock. He did not come
</p>
<p>for the horse until a quarter-past four ; and he a.sked me how mu(-h
</p>
<p>I would charge for the hire of the horse. I told hiiu five dollars.
</p>
<p>Ho wanted him for four dollars. I told him he could not have it
</p>
<p>for that. He knew this horse, and inquired for it. I went down

<p>to the stable with him ; and I told him to take a mare that was in

<p>the stable, but he would not have her. I then tukl hmi I would
</p>
<p>give him the other horse. He then wanted to see the saddles and
</p>
<p>bridles. I showed him a saddle, and he said it was too small.
</p>
<p>332 TBE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Then I showed hhii another saddle. That suited very well, only
</p>
<p>that it had not the kind of stirnips he wanted. The slirnips were
</p>
<p>covered with leather ; and ho wanted a pair of English .steel stirrups.
</p>
<p>He then wanted to see the bridles. I took him into the office, and
</p>
<p>showed him the bridles ; and ho picked out a double-reined brid e.
</p>
<p>Before he mounted the horse, ho asked me how lato ho could slay
</p>
<p>out with the horse. I told him he could stay out no later than
</p>
<p>eight o'clock, or nine at the farthest. Afterwards I became very
</p>
<p>uneasy about the horse, and wanted to .see about it before I closed
</p>
<p>up the .stable ; and that is how I got to see Atzerodt and Ilerold.
</p>
<p>Q. At what Lour did you see Herold riding that night?
</p>
<p>A. It was about twenty-five minutes past ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. From what direction was he moving ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho seemed as if he was coming down from the Treasuiy upon
</p>
<p>the avenue ; and I met him close to Willaid's, on the avenue.
</p>
<p>Q. And he was going what way ?
</p>
<p>A. He was passing Fourteenth Street. Tlie horse was pulling
</p>
<p>to get to the stable ; for he was a horse very well acquainted with
</p>
<p>the stable. I suppose Herold knew me ; and he turned the horse
</p>
<p>round, and I hallooed to him to get off that horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he move off pretty rapidly?
</p>
<p>A. He put spurs to the horse, and went, as fast as the horse
</p>
<p>could go, up Fourteenth Street.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean North ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : North Fourteenth Street.
</p>
<p>Q. You say iio knew that horse ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he a fast horse ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho was not a v'eiy fast horse. Ho was a lady's saddle-
</p>
<p>horse. He was all the time used as a lady's saddle-horse ; and any
</p>
<p>one could ride him, he was so gentle and nice.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he trot, or pace ?
</p>
<p>A. A single foot-rack. He would trot if you would let ihe
</p>
<p>bridle-rein go slack.

</p>
<p>to the .stable  I believe it was the 5th or Gth of April  inquiring
</p>
<p>for this man Atzerodt, but did not inquire for him by name. Uc

</p>
<p>April, when this happened, as near as I can remember.
</p>

</p>
<p>A. I had just come in the house myself, and went to my room.
</p>
<p>About five minutes afterwards, a servant came up with a fivc-<lollar
</p>
<p>bill, and told me, " There is a man come in with Atzerodt, who
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 343
</p>
<p>wants lodging, and wants to pay for it." So I went down, and gave
</p>
<p>the man his change. I had an uneasiness about the thing myself,
</p>
<p> thought there was something wrong.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they take a room together ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Atzerodt aslied for his old room ; and I told him
</p>
<p>it was occupied. I told him he would have to go with this gentle-
</p>
<p>man. So I gave the man his change,  this Thomas,  and told
</p>
<p>the servant to show him to his room ; and Atzerodt was going to
</p>
<p>follow him. Said I, "Atzerodt, you have not registered." Said
</p>
<p>he, " Do you want my name 1 " Said I, " Certainly." He hesitated
</p>
<p>some, but stepped back and registered, and went to his room. That
</p>
<p>was the last I saw of him.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you describe the appearance of that man who was with
</p>
<p>Mm?
</p>
<p>A. He was a man about five feet seven or eight inches high ;
</p>
<p>and his weight was about one hundred and forty pounds, I should
</p>
<p>judge.
</p>
<p>Q. How was he dressed ?
</p>
<p>A. Poorly dressed, and in dark. His pants were worn through
</p>
<p>at the back, near the heels. I took notice of that as he walked out
</p>
<p>of the door to go to his room. He was quite dark-complexioned,
</p>
<p>and very much weather-beaten. He had dark hair.
</p>
<p>Q. Had he the appearance of a laboring man ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the appearance of a laboring man.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you express an opinion as to whether the clothes in
</p>
<p>which he was dressed were such as he would probably ordinarily
</p>
<p>wear, or were assumed as a disguise? Have you an opinion on
</p>
<p>that subject ?
</p>
<p>A. I judged them to be more of a disguise. I think it was a
</p>
<p>broadcloth coat he had on ; very much worn, though.
</p>
<p>Q. The whole appearance, you say, was shabby ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What name did he assume ?
</p>
<p>A. Sara Thomas.

<p>344 THE Tit I A L.
</p>
<p>there, and I had given the servant orders to get her a carriage to
</p>
<p>take her to the raiboad depot for the G.15 train. She had left

</p>
<p>Q. Did Atzerodt remain ?
</p>
<p>A. Atzerodt left shortly afterwards, and he walked towards
</p>
<p>Sixth Street. As the servant came back from getting the carriage,
</p>
<p>he met Atzerodt, and said to him, " Atzerodt, what brings you out
</p>
<p>so early this morning? "  " Well," said he, " I have got business."
</p>
<p>These were all the words.
</p>
<p>Q. In what direction was he going ?
</p>
<p>A. Towards Sixth Street ; that is, west from my house.
</p>
<p>Q. Had ho paid his bill ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He left without paying?

<p>A. Yes, sir : there he sits [pointing to George A. Atzerodt].
</p>
<p>Q. Is this the first time you have seen him since ?
</p>
<p>A. It is.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the manner of these men that night ? Did you
</p>
<p>observe any tiling unusual,  any excitement about them ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : there was no excitement about them. This man
</p>
<p>Thomas stared at me. He kept a close eye on me as I came
</p>
<p>in.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they have any conversation with each other in your
</p>
<p>presence ?

<p>TUB TRTAL. 345
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ask for both ? How diil they happen to have the
</p>
<p>same room ?
</p>
<p>A. IIo just asked for himself. Atzcrodt was lying on the scttoo
</p>
<p>in the corner of the room as I camo in ; and Thomas was standing
</p>
<p>at the counter, at the register.
</p>
<p>Q. How did it happen, then, that they went to tlio same
</p>
<p>room?
</p>
<p>A. Atzcrodt asked for his old room. I told him that was occu-
</p>
<p>pied, and he would have to go in with this man. The room that he
</p>
<p>was in was a large room,  a room with sis beds in. There were
</p>
<p>other parties in it before these men went there.
</p>

</p>
<p>I did not see that.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you observe whether the other man, Thomas as he called
</p>
<p>himself, was armed ?

<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. You say he stared at you very much. Did he make any
</p>
<p>remark to you ?
</p>
<p>A. All that he said to me was that ho was a poor writer.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he enter his name himself?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see that ; but I judge that his name was entered
</p>
<p>when I came into the room.
</p>
<p>Q. Y'ou say Atzcrodt was in the habit of stopping at your hotel.
</p>
<p>Had he, on any previous occasion, hesitated to register his name
</p>
<p>when taking rooms there ?

<p>He had just bought it ; and ho came in, and made the remark that
</p>
<p>he had just bought it ; and I told him I wished I had known that
</p>
<p>ho wanted one, for I could have sold him one that I had,  a new
</p>
<p>one, whicli I had traded a small one for, and I had no use for it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he exhibit the revolver to you?
</p>
<p>A. It was put in my care,  handed in to the office.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think j-ou would recognize it if you saw it again?
</p>
<p>A. I think I would.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting the revolver identified by John Lee, as found in
</p>
<p>a room at the Kirkwood House.] Is that it?
</p>
<p>A. I would not bo certain. I do not think it is the same one ;
</p>
<p>but it is something similar.

</p>
<p>Q. You mentioned before that Atzerodt bad, previous to this last
</p>
<p>visit, had arms in his possession ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw them once : that was when he handed them into the

<p>oflBee there.
</p>
<p>Q. And you kept them for him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, until he called for them.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you or could you not recognize them again ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not swear to them.
</p>
<p>Q. What were the arms ?
</p>
<p>A. A largo revolver,  something similar to the one shown me.
</p>
<p>Q. What else?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing else that I saw.

<p>Q. You have mentioned that Atzerodt boasted, that, on some day,
</p>
<p>ho would have enough gold and silver to keep him all his life.

<p>preceded it ?
</p>
<p>A. I came into the room. He was drinking at the time. Ho
</p>
<p>asked me to take a drink. I took a drink. He paid the bill ; and
</p>
<p>then he said, " Greenawalt, I am pretty near broke; but I have

<p>always got friends enough to give me as much money as will see me
</p>
<p>through."
</p>

</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did any one of the company bave gold and silver there ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I remember, and not that I saw. I have had half
</p>
<p>348 TUE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>a dollar in my pocket, and I might liavo had that out; but I do not
</p>

<p>A. I had taken a drink : I was not in liquor.
</p>
<p>Q. Do I understand you to say that you do not remember saying
</p>
<p>that you had bought gold and silver that morning ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember that I did. When Mr. Bailey left my
</p>
<p>house, he wanted to pay his stage-fare; and I bought some eight or
</p>
<p>nine two and a half dollar gold-pieces ; and I do not remember the
</p>
<p>exact amount of silver, but some seven dollars, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. What brought the conversation to gold and silver?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I ever bad any conversation about gold
</p>
<p>and silver. There was only the remark of Atzerodt : there was no
</p>
<p>other conversation about it.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you not before been talking about money in some shape?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I had not been talking with him at all until I en-
</p>
<p>tered the room. He asked me to drink.
</p>
<p>Q. Had any one else, to your knowledge, been talking with him
</p>
<p>about money ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>Q. You mentioned a man by the name of Thomas as having
</p>
<p>come to your house on the morning of this Saturday, between two
</p>
<p>and three o'clock, in company with Atzerodt. Did they seem to be
</p>
<p>intimate ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you take them to be previously acquainted ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not tell in regard to that. They came to my house.
</p>
<p>Q. You can tell what you took them to be. Did you take them
</p>
<p>to be acquaintances, or strangers ?
</p>
<p>A. I thought they were in company by the way they came
</p>
<p>there.

</p>
<p>Q. Did they look as though they had known one another previ-
</p>
<p>ously ? or had met one another on the street, and just happened to
</p>
<p>come to your house together ?
</p>
<p>THE TltlAL. 349
</p>
<p>A. I judged that they were acquainted.
</p>
<p>Q. You say this man exhibited signs of disguise. What were
</p>
<p>they?
</p>
<p>A. He had on broadcloth clothing. It did not look like working
</p>
<p>clothinK; and it was well worn:  not laborinn; man's clothing.
</p>
<p>Q. His clothing was well worn and broadcloth; and that made
</p>
<p>you think he was in disguise ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, i'ir.
</p>
<p>Q. You have also mentioned that Atzerodt hesitated to register
</p>
<p>his name. In what shape did he hesitate 1
</p>
<p>A. " Well," said ho, " do you wish my name ? " I said, " Cer-
</p>
<p>tainly." He stood back ; and then ho walked forward and stopped,
</p>
<p>and then followed it up, and put down his name.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it an unusual thing for men to hesitate, when they come
</p>
<p>there at two or three o'clock in the morninj;, to register then- names ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not been receiving any guests at that hour. I never
</p>
<p>had any one to hesitate about registering.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say he would not like to do it 1
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he seem sleepy ?
</p>
<p>A. No, he did not, to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he seem in liquor ?
</p>
<p>A. No : he was not in liquor.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he seem wide awake ?
</p>
<p>A. He did.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recognize among the prisoners at the bar the stranger
</p>
<p>by the name of Thomas ?
</p>
<p>A. There [pointing to Edward Spangler] is a man who resembles
</p>
<p>him somewhat. It appears to me he is not as dark. He has not got
</p>
<p>the board on he had then. His hair was longer, and, I think,
</p>
<p>darker. I could not bo positive as to that man.
</p>
<p>Q. His hair was longer and darker ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and cut down half over his ears. I think he was
</p>
<p>heavier.

</p>
<p>A. He left aljout tbat time, as I understand
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have a conversation with Atzerodt about wLere he
</p>
<p>was going in the morning ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not have any conversation with him that morn-
</p>
<p>ing, no more than I asked him whether he had got baclt. That was
</p>
<p>all the conversation that I passed with him, except that I asked
</p>
<p>him to register.
</p>
<p>Q. After he registered, and while he was registering, he remarked
</p>
<p>that he was a poor writer ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : Thomas made that remark.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the coat identified by John Lee as
</p>
<p>having been found in the room at the Kirkwood House.] Look at

<p>that coat. Do you remember ever having seen that in the possession
</p>
<p>of Atzerodt?

<p>A. I never did.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mk. Ewing :

<p>Q. Was the board on the side of the face close ?
</p>
<p>A. His beard came front, and was cut down from the mustache
</p>
<p>up; but it was either that way or whiskers all around. I know he
</p>
<p>had whiskers in front.
</p>
<p>Q. Wliat sort of a hat did he wear ?
</p>
<p>A. A dark slouch hat,
</p>

</p>
<p>A. The servant told me they came in together.

</p>
<p>Q. Will you state, if you please, the exact color of the hair and
</p>
<p>beard of Thomas ?

</p>
<p>A. I told him he would have to. That was my work. I would

</p>
<p>the best I could do for him.

<p>near the middle of the room ; and he was sittmg on one side of
</p>
<p>the room, as well as I recollect.

<p>Q. You said, as I understood you, that you had heard that Gen-

<p>Q. And that he then answered? What was his precise answer ?

<p>A. We heard it, and wo got to talking about it.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not this the answer : " A man must have followed Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Grant to have killed him " ?
</p>
<p>A. Not exactly ; it was not spoken in that way : but, if the
</p>
<p>man who was to follow hmi had foUowed him, it was likely he
</p>
<p>might have killed him.
</p>
<p>Q. IIi.s evident moaning, as far as you understand it, was, that
</p>
<p>General Grant, to have been killed, must have been followed V
</p>
<p>A. To be sure : I should suppose so.

<p>A. On the 19th, I was sent for to camp by Captain Townsend,

<p>scout. I detailed them ; and we got ready, and left camp about
</p>
<p>fifteen minutes before ten. I proceeded to Mr. Purdon's house to
</p>
<p>take him as a guide to Mr. Richter's house. He went with me to
</p>
<p>the house, stop])ing a short piece in the rear until I saw the prisoner
</p>
<p>was there. I knocked at the door ; and Riehter a.sked me twice there
</p>
<p>who came, before he would let me in. I told him to come and see.
</p>
<p>AVhcn he came to the door, I asked him if there was a man there
</p>
<p>by the name of Atwood. lie said no ; that there was no one there ;
</p>
<p>that he had been there, but had gone to Frederick, or the neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood of Frederick. I then told him that I was going to search the
</p>
<p>house. He then told me that his cousin was up stairs in bed. His
</p>
<p>wife spoke up, and said, that, as for that, there wore three there. He
</p>
<p>got a light, and I took two men with me, and went up to the room,
</p>
<p>where he was lying on the front of the bed. I asked him his name,
</p>
<p>and he gave me a fictitious name,  a name that I did not
</p>
<p>understand.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you recall it now ?

<p>and there he was examined hy Jlajor E. R. Artman.

<p>Q. Did he ask you on the way why you had arrested him?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I asked him, just before I left Germantown, if he
</p>
<p>had left Washington shortly, and he told me no ; and then I asked
</p>
<p>him if he had not something to do with the assassination. He said
</p>
<p>no. After the major examined him, he ordered me to go to the
</p>
<p>Relay Hsuse with them, and report him there to General Tyler ; and
</p>
<p>then he sent me to Washington with him.
</p>
<p>Q. When you asked him about having had any thing to do with
</p>
<p>the assassination, it was some time after the arrest ? Had you taken
</p>
<p>him before the ofiicer at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>362 THE TlilAL.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. When was that sale made 1
</p>
<p>A. In the latter part of November : I cannot arrive at the day
</p>
<p>exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. How far is your uncle's from Dr. Mudd's ?
</p>
<p>A. A very short distance : I do not think it is over a quarter of
</p>
<p>a mile. I cannot state the distance positively ; but it is very short.
</p>
<p>By the Coukt :
</p>
<p>Q. Were you present at your uncle's when Dr. Mudd came with
</p>
<p>Booth to buy that horse ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see them come ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they come in a carriage, or on horseback ?
</p>
<p>A. I think they were on horseback.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they both leave together after the horse was purchased ?
</p>
<p>A. I think thoy did.
</p>
<p>Q. Who purchased the horse, and made the agreement for him ?
</p>
<p>A. Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Dr. Mudd take any part in that purchase 1
</p>
<p>A. None whatever that I know of.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he look at the horse before the purchase was made ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think he did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he give his opinion and advice on the horse to Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he seem to take an interest in that purchase ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I think not. I did not notice any thing of the sort.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it your impression that he came there as a friend of
</p>
<p>Booth, or that ho happened along accidentally with him ?
</p>
<p>A. Indeed, I am not able to say.
</p>
<p>Q. The question is. What is your impression ?
</p>
<p>A. Dr. Mudd was aware that my uncle had horses for sale ; and
</p>
<p>porhaps he brought him there, thinking that he could purchase a
</p>
<p>luirso there.

</p>
<p>Q. Was that your impression, that Dr. Mudd brought Booth
</p>
<p>there to purchase the horse ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAt. 363
</p>
<p>A. I never formed any opinion in regard to that. It is a tiling
</p>
<p>I never thought of.
</p>
<p>Q. He looked at the horse, and examined him with Booth,
</p>
<p>did he ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Dr. Mudd knew the horse well ; had known him
</p>
<p>for some years previous : he was a very old horse.
</p>
<p>By 3Ir. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. And did Booth take away the horse then ?
</p>
<p>A. Booth requested my uncle to send the horse to Bryantown
</p>
<p>the next morning ; and I took the horse myself the nest morning
</p>
<p>to Bryantown. He requested him to be sent to Montgomery's
</p>
<p>stable, in Bryantown.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear Booth describe what sort of a horse he wanted,
</p>
<p> a farming-horse, or a saddle-horse?
</p>
<p>A. I think he said something about looking at lands in tho
</p>
<p>lower part of Maryland, and said ho wanted a horse to run in a
</p>
<p>light buggy. I recollect that distinctly. My uncle told him he
</p>
<p>had but one horse that he could recommend as a buggy horse, and
</p>
<p>that ho could not spare it, as he wanted it for his own use. He
</p>
<p>told him then that he would send him a young mare. Booth said
</p>
<p>a mare would not suit him. Then my uncle told him that he had an
</p>
<p>old saddle-horse that he would sell him, if the horse would suit
</p>
<p>him. Booth examined the horse, and said he thought that horse
</p>
<p>would suit him ; that he only wanted a horse for one year; and he
</p>
<p>bought the horse, and paid for him, and requested him to be sent
</p>
<p>to Montgomery's stables, at Bryantown, the next morning ; and I
</p>
<p>took tho horse down myself the next morning to him.
</p>
<p>Q. Dr. Mudd took no more interest in the purchase of the horse
</p>
<p>than any other spectator, I suppose ?
</p>
<p>A. None whatever. I did not perceive that Dr. Mudd took
</p>
<p>any interest whatever in the purchase of the horse. 
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say your uncle had three horses for sale
</p>
<p>at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : two of them were mares. Booth selected this one

</p>
<p>364 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that Booth spoke of buying land in
</p>
<p>the lower part of Maryland ?
</p>
<p>A. I think, if I am not mistaken, he said he wanted a horse
</p>
<p>to run in a light buggy, to travel over the lower counties of Mary-
</p>
<p>land, to look at the lands ; that he desired to buy some land.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where Booth staid that night?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you find him next morning ?
</p>
<p>A. At Montgomery's tavern, in Biyantown ; where I delivered
</p>
<p>the horse to him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he and Dr. Mudd go away together from your uncle's ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they go in the direction of Dr. Mudd's home?
</p>
<p>A. I think they did.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember what day of the week this was ?
</p>
<p>A. If I am not mistaken, it was on Jlonday ; but I will not be
</p>
<p>positive.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you been at church the preceding Sunday ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Booth at church there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Was Booth in the habit of staying at Dr. Mudd's when he
</p>
<p>was in that neighborhood ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that he was ever in the neighborhood before.
</p>
<p>It was the last time I ever saw Booth.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see or hear of his being in the neighborhood
</p>
<p>before or since ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I did hear that he was in the neighborhood of Bry-
</p>
<p>antown some time before that.
</p>
<p>Q. IIow long Ijcfore that ?

<p>tbe world to keep dates : it was some time previous to that, though,
</p>
<p>I think.
</p>
<p>Q. You never saw or heard of his being there since ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I never saw or heard of the man since, until I saw
</p>
<p>his name in the papers after the assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear of his being at Dr. Mudd's before or
</p>
<p>since ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you live with your uncle ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And you say that is about a quarter of a mile from Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd's house ?
</p>
<p>A. Within half a mile : I suppose hardly more than a quarter
</p>
<p>of a mile. The farms are adjoining.
</p>
<p>Q. I suppose, then, you see Dr. Mudd almost every day ?
</p>
<p>A. I very often see Dr. Mudd ; sometimes every day, some-
</p>
<p>times two or three times a week.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant John J. Taffey,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you or not knowledge of a dark-bay horse, blind of
</p>
<p>one eye, now at Major-General Augur's stables, in this city, at the
</p>
<p>comer of Seventeenth and I Streets ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know about its being there ; but a horse answering
</p>
<p>to the description was seen by me on the night of the 14th or
</p>
<p>the morning of the 15th of April last. I was going to the hos-
</p>
<p>pital, where I am on duty. I saw a horse standing at Lincoln
</p>
<p>Branch Barracks, about three-quarters of a mile east of the Capi-
</p>
<p>tol. I ordered the guard to stop it ; and I put a guard around
</p>
<p>it, and kept it there until a cavalry picket was thrown out, and I
</p>
<p>reported at the office of the picket. He requested me to take it
</p>
<p>down to the old Capitol Prison, where the headquarters of this pick-
</p>
<p>et were. I then reported to Captain Lord, having the horse ; and

</p>
<p>8bb THE rniAL.
</p>
<p>took it there with Captain Lansing, of the Thirteenth New- York
</p>
<p>Cavalry. Thoy took the saddle off, and took the horse away.
</p>
<p>Q. Would you recoguize the saddle now ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I should. I rode on it.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness the saddle, which is Exhibit No.
</p>
<p>39.] Look at that saddle, and say if it is the one.
</p>
<p>A. I should think that was the saddle : I know the stirrups.
</p>
<p>Q. Describe the horse.
</p>
<p>A. A large brown horse. Alwut the blindness of the eye, I
</p>
<p>did not notice that until I got to General Augur's headquarters,
</p>
<p>when the men spoke of it. I then found the horse to be blind of
</p>
<p>one eye.
</p>
<p>Q. Had the horse saddle and bridle on when you saw him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the sweat was pouring off him, and the sweat was
</p>
<p>on the giound,  a regular puddle of water.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he standing still ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the sentinel at the hospital had stopped him.
</p>
<p>Q. And that was between twelve and one'clock?
</p>
<p>A. About tliat time : it may have been a little after one.
</p>
<p>Q. In what direction is that from here ?
</p>
<p>A. Directly east of the Capitol, abut three-fourths of a mile.
</p>
<p>Q. Were there any indications fi'om the horse that he had proba-
</p>
<p>bly fallen in the flight V
</p>
<p>A. When I rode him down, he seemed to be a little lame : that
</p>
<p>was all I noticed.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. State where that road leads to out of Washington.
</p>
<p>A. It is a sort of by-road that leads to Camp Barry : it turns
</p>
<p>north after it gets to the branch barracks towards Camp Bai-ry to
</p>
<p>the Bladensburg Road.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it on the main Bladensburg Road ?
</p>
<p>A. No : not on the main road. I do not know the name of
</p>
<p>the street ; but it is between East Capitol Street and the Bladens-
</p>
<p>burg Road.

</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. WTaat is the distance from the Lincoln Hospital to the Navy-
</p>
<p>Yai-d Bridge ?
</p>

</p>
<p>is fully a mile.

<p>370 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at the original despatch, and see whose writing it is. la
</p>
<p>it Booth's handwritins '
</p>
<p>A. It is.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether on or about, or probably a little after,
</p>
<p>the 4th (if Jlaicli last, 3'ou had an interview in your room with J.
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth, John H. Surratt, and Payne, the prisoner at the
</p>
<p>bar?
</p>
<p>A. I will state, that, as near as I recollect, it was after the 4th
</p>
<p>of March : it was the second time that Payne visited the house. I
</p>
<p>returned from my office one day at half-past four o'clock : I went to
</p>
<p>my room, and rang the bell for Dan, the negro servant, and told him
</p>
<p>to bring me some water, and inquired at the same time where John
</p>
<p>had gone. He told me JIassa John had ridden out about two o'clock
</p>
<p>in the afternoon, with six others, on horseback ; that he had left the
</p>
<p>front of the house with sLx others on horseback about half-past two
</p>
<p>o'clock. On going down to dinner, I found Mrs. Surratt in the
</p>
<p>passage. She was weeping bitterly, and I was endeavoring to con-
</p>
<p>sole her. She said, " John is gone away: go down to dinner, and
</p>
<p>make the best of your dinner you can." She went out. After dinner,
</p>
<p>I went to my room, sat down, and commenced reading: and about
</p>
<p>half-past sis o'clock Surratt came' again, and was very much excited;
</p>
<p>in fact, rushed into the room. He had a revolver in his hand,
</p>
<p> one of Sharpe's revolvers, a four-barrelled revolver, a small one ;
</p>
<p>you could carry it in your vest-pocket,  and he appeared to be
</p>
<p>very much excited. I said, " John, what is the matter? why are
</p>
<p>you so much excited ? " Said he, " I will shoot any one that comes
</p>
<p>into this room ; my prospect is gone, my hopes are blighted ; I want
</p>
<p>something to do ; can you get me a clerkship ? " In about ten
</p>
<p>minutes after, the prisoner Payne came into the room. He was also
</p>
<p>very much excited ; and I noticed he had a pistol. About fifteen
</p>
<p>minutes afterwards, Booth came into the room ; and Booth was so ex-
</p>
<p>cited, that he walked around the room three or four times very fran-
</p>
<p>tically, and did not notice me. He had a whip in his hand, and I
</p>
<p>spoke to him ; and he recognized me, and said, " I did not see you."

</p>
<p>The three then went up stairs into the back room, in what I call the
</p>
<p>third story, and must have remained there about thirty minutes,
</p>
<p>when they left the house together. On Surratt's returning home, I
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 371
</p>
<p>asked him where he had left his friend Payne. He said Payne had
</p>
<p>gone to Baltimore. I asked bini where John Willjcs Booth had
</p>
<p>gone. He said Booth had gone to New Yorli. This is all that I
</p>
<p>rememher of that circumstance ; and some two weeks after, Sun-att,
</p>
<p>when passing the post-office, went to the post-office, and inquired
</p>
<p>for a letter that was sent to him under the name of James Sturdey;
</p>
<p>and I asked him why a letter was sent to him under a false name,
</p>
<p>and he said he had particular reasons for it.
</p>
<p>Q. What day was that ?
</p>
<p>A. It must have been about two weeks after that affaii-.
</p>
<p>Q. The latter end of IMarch ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it must have been before the 20th of March. The
</p>
<p>letter was signed " Wood ; " and the writer stated that he was at the
</p>
<p>Kevere House in New York, and that he was looking for something
</p>
<p>to do, and that he would probably go to some boarding-house in
</p>
<p>Grand Street : I think it was West Grand Street. That was the
</p>
<p>whole substance of the letter.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you say you were familiar with Booth's handwriting, or
</p>
<p>simply with his signature ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen his autograph on the hotel register and also at
</p>
<p>tiie house.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a note.] Here is a note signed by R. D. Wat-
</p>
<p>son. Will you look at it, and see whether that is Booth's handwrit-
</p>
<p>ing or not V
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I would not recognize that as Booth's handwriting.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any remark made at all in their excited conversa-
</p>
<p>tion as to where they had all been riding ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : they were very guarded indeed. Payne made no
</p>
<p>remark at all. The only remarks that were made were those excited
</p>
<p>remarks by Surratt.
</p>
<p>Q. Surratt had been riding, and you say Booth had a whip in
</p>
<p>his hand ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Payne appear to have gone with them also ?

<p>A. Yes, sir : he was much excited. In fact, I asked the negro
</p>
<p>servant that afternoon to tell me who the seven were. He said one
</p>
<p>was Massa John, the other Booth ; and then he said Port Tobacco,
</p>
<p>372 THE TltTAL.
</p>
<p>and then that man who was stopping at the house, whom I recog-
</p>
<p>nized as Payne.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean bj Port Tobacco the prisoner Atzerodt ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. What time in tlie day did you meet Mr. Lloyd on his way to
</p>
<p>Washington at Uniontown V
</p>
<p>A. It must have been about ten o'clock in the morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hoar any of the conversation that passed at that time
</p>
<p>between him and Mrs. Surratt V
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I leaned back in my buggy ; and Mrs. Surratt leaned
</p>
<p>sideways in the buggy, and whispered, as it were, in Mr. Lloyd's
</p>
<p>ear.
</p>
<p>Q. Did she state any thing to you afterwards of what the conver-
</p>
<p>sation was about ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. The only conversation that I heanl at that particu-
</p>
<p>lar time was between her and Mrs. Offutt. She was talking about
</p>
<p>the man Howell.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocte Bingham. I object. There is noth-
</p>
<p>ing of that in the case.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Johnson :
</p>
<p>Q. Was it at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : after the conversation between Lloyd and herself.
</p>
<p>Q. On the same .spot 't Had she moved off?
</p>
<p>A. No : Mrs. Offutt was in the carriage ; and of course, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Offutt being in the carriage, she was obliged to speak much louder
</p>
<p>to her.
</p>
<p>By Mk. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. You stated, I think, that you did not learn any thing of the
</p>
<p>contents of those packages ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : they were wrapped up in paper, and appeared to
</p>
<p>me three or four saucers rolled up ; and the package was dcpo.'^itcd
</p>
<p>in the bottom of the carriage. I took it at that time to be a package
</p>
<p>of saucers.

</p>
<p>By ]\Ir. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect when Booth played in the " Apostate " the
</p>
<p>part of Pcscara ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he played at that time for the benefit of John Mc-
</p>
<p>Cullough. It must have been about the 24th of March, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not this occasion of their return from the ride the day
</p>
<p>before or the day after he played in the " Apostate " 1
</p>
<p>A. That I cannot say. It must have been after the 4th of
</p>
<p>March. This man PajTie was stopping at the house at the time ;
</p>
<p>and, when he came to the house, he made some excuse to Mrs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt, saying he would have liked to have been here before the 4th of
</p>
<p>March, but he could not get here by the 4th of March ; and, by thft
</p>
<p>circumstance, I recollect that it was after the 4th of jMarch. Wheth-
</p>
<p>er it was before or after the day that Booth played Pescara in
</p>
<p>the " Apostate " I could not say, because I am not positive as to
</p>
<p>the date.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you go to see that play ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Booth gave a pass to Surratt for two ; and he asked
</p>
<p>Surratt whether I would go. Surratt said he thought not ; but,
</p>
<p>when Surratt asked me, I did go. It was a written pass ; and the
</p>
<p>doorkeeper at first refused admission on the pass.
</p>
<p>Q. State, to the best of your recollection, whether this occasion
</p>
<p>was before or after Booth played in the " Apostate."
</p>
<p>A. To the best of my recollection, it was before.
</p>
<p>Q. About how long before ?
</p>
<p>A. As near as I can recollect, two weeks before that time. '
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any means of ascertaining ?
</p>
<p>A. No : only I know that it was after the 4th of March, from the
</p>
<p>remark Payne made when he visited the house the second time.
</p>
<p>Q. You cannot state positively whether it was before or after he
</p>
<p>played in the " Apostate " 'I
</p>
<p>A. I should not like to state positively.

<p>374 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>ratt in company with John Surratt : will you state what time tliat
</p>
<p>was?
</p>
<p>A. I stated that when these cu'cumstances happened, of their
</p>
<p>ride, Surratt came home first, and in about ten minutes Payne came
</p>
<p>into the room. Surratt came into my room first, and had his con-
</p>
<p>versation ; and then Payne came in, and was much excited.
</p>
<p>Q. What date was that ?
</p>
<p>A. It was after the 4th of March. I could not give the precise
</p>
<p>date.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that visit of Payne exclusive of the other two visits you
</p>
<p>mentioned in your testimony the other day ?
</p>
<p>A. It was during the last,  the second visit of Payne.
</p>
<p>Q. During the time, he claimed to be, as you say, a Baptist
</p>
<p>preacher ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was during his long stay in the house, when he
</p>
<p>stopped three days.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. How did you learn any thing with reference to the antece-
</p>
<p>dents of Mrs. Slater ?
</p>
<p>A. It was told to me by Mrs. Surratt herself.
</p>
<p>Q. What did Mrs. Surratt tell you ?
</p>
<p>A. Sirs. Surratt told me that she came to the house in company
</p>
<p>with this man Howell ; that she was a North-Carolinian, I believe,
</p>
<p>and that she spoke French ; and that she was a blockade-runner, or
</p>
<p>bearer of despatches.
</p>
<p>Q. Where were you at the time Mrs. Surratt told you this?
</p>
<p>A. I was in the house, in the dininjr-room.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you certain, beyond all doubt, that Mrs. Surratt ever told
</p>
<p>you Mrs. Slater was a blockade-runner ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever seen Mrs. Slater at the house of Blrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>before that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I myself saw Mrs. Slater at the house only once. I learned
</p>
<p>she had been to the house twice.

<p>THE TRIAL. 375
</p>
<p>Q. How long was she there ?
</p>
<p>A. She remained there one night.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any conversation with her yourself?
</p>
<p>A. She drove up to the door in a buggy : the bell rang, and
</p>
<p>there was a young man in the buggy with her. Mrs. Surratt told
</p>
<p>me to go out and take her trunk. That is all the conversation
</p>
<p>I had with her. She had a mask down,  one of the short masks
</p>
<p>ladies wear. They call them masks, I believe : thoy are not veils.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean to say Jlrs. Slater wore a mask V
</p>
<p>A. What ladies call a mask.
</p>
<p>Q. What was it made of?
</p>
<p>A. Crape. Thoy do not cover the entire face : they come down
</p>
<p>to the chin, and I believe the ladies call them masks.
</p>
<p>By the Cotikt :
</p>
<p>Q. Arc they of this texture ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. A thin, short veil, that just covers the face ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, su:. I believe the name for them is masks.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. There is nothing peculiar about them from ordinary veils ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. At the time you say she told you she was a blockade-runner,
</p>
<p>did she tell you of her being a North-Carolinian, and speaking
</p>
<p>French ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you in the house at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I was in the house at that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any one present besides yourself?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I remember.
</p>

<p>376 TBB TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the exact language BIrs. Surratt used to you in giv-
</p>
<p>ing you this information '?
</p>
<p>A. Slio stated that this woman was from North Carolina, and
</p>
<p>that, if she got into any trouble, there was no danger, because she
</p>
<p>could imniodiatoly apply to the French consul, speaking French as
</p>
<p>sh(j did. That is about the only language that I remember.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Cl.<.mpitt :
</p>
<p>Q. When John Surratt returned to the house in a state of excite-
</p>
<p>ment, did he tell you the occasion of it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : he .showed nie his pistol, and said he would .shoot
</p>
<p>any man that came into the room. I said, " John, why are you so
</p>
<p>excited? why don't you settle down like a sensible youn"- man? "
</p>
<p>Said he, " My hopes are gone, my prospects blighted : can't you
</p>
<p>got rae something to do ? can't you get me a clerkship? " These
</p>
<p>were his precise words. I looked at him, and laughed at him, and
</p>
<p>told him he was foolish.
</p>
<p>Q. You remarked that Sirs. Surratt was weeping bitterly : did
</p>
<p>she state the cause ?
</p>
<p>A. She merely said, " Go down, and make the best of the dinner
</p>
<p>you can. John is gone away." John, when he returned to me,
</p>
<p>said he had three pairs of drawers. From that I thought he was
</p>
<p>going to take a long ride.

<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. By whom were you called on first to give your testimony in
</p>
<p>this case ?
</p>
<p>A. I was called on by the War Dep.irtment.

<p>Q. What member of the War Department ?
</p>
<p>A. I was called on by Judge Advocate Burnett, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you arrested ?
</p>
<p>A. I surrendered myself up on Saturday morning at ei^ht o'clock
</p>
<p>to Superintendent Richards, of the Metropolitan Police force. I
</p>
<p>stated to him what I knew of Payne, Atzerodt, and Herold visiting
</p>
<p>the house. I stated also what I knew of John Surratt ; that I saw
</p>
<p>these men in private conversation.

<p>Q. Were any threats ever made to you by any officer of the
</p>
<p>Government in case you did not divulge ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : no throats at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Any inducements V
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : no inducements at all. I road in the paper tliat
</p>
<p>morning the description of the assassin of Secretary Seward. He
</p>
<p>was described as a man who wore a long gi-ay coat. I had seen At-
</p>
<p>zerodt wear a long gray coat ; and I went to a stable on G Street,
</p>
<p>and told the man there I thought it was Atzerodt. We went down
</p>
<p>towards Tenth Street, and I met a gentleman by the name of Holahan,
</p>
<p>and he also communicated bis suspicions to me. The gentleman and
</p>
<p>I returned to breakfast, and took breakfast ; but, at half-past eight
</p>
<p>o'clock, we gave ourselves up to Superintendent Richards, of the
</p>
<p>Bletropolitan Police force. I told Officer IMcDevitt about this man
</p>
<p>Payne, and where he had been stopping. I also told him of Atze-
</p>
<p>rodt, and I also told of Herold. Officer McDovitt put me in his
</p>
<p>charge, and said, " You will go with me." We then went to General
</p>
<p>Piucker's office ; and General Piuckor gave us an order for ahorse. We
</p>
<p>went to Captain Tompkins ; and there I met a man who has some-
</p>
<p>thing to do with a stable at the corner of Thirteenth and E Streets,
</p>
<p>and he said to me that a man had been to him that afternoon hiring
</p>
<p>a horse. I asked Wm if he would give me his description. lie de-
</p>
<p>scribed him as small, black eyebrows, and with a laugh on his
</p>
<p>face all the time; and I asked him his name, and he said Herold.
</p>
<p>Then I told Officer !MoDevitt we should go for the horse ; and we
</p>
<p>went, and we searched Mr. Herold's house, and procured photo-
</p>
<p>graphs ; and Officer McDcvitt also procured a photograph of Booth at
</p>
<p>that time ; and Jlr. Holahan, who was in our company, went and
</p>
<p>procured a photograpli of Surratt. I also stated to Officer McDev-
</p>
<p>itt that I kuew that Herold had been in the habit of riding in Blary-
</p>
<p>land ; he had groat many acquaintances there ; and that I thought,
</p>
<p>if they would take any road, they would probably take this road
</p>
<p>through Maryland ; that, after the deed had been committed, there
</p>
<p>land.

</p>
<p>yom- surrendering yourself to Superintendent Richards and going
</p>
<p>to the oflSco of Colonel Burnett, that you were fearful of an arrest?
</p>
<p>A. I myself had a great deal to fear. Being in this Iiouse
</p>
<p>where these people were, I knew that I would bo brought into public
</p>
<p>notice.
</p>
<p>Q. I am not asking what you had to fear 
</p>
<p>Assistant Jcdge Advoc.ite Bingham. You have asked him the
</p>
<p>question : you must allow him to answer it.
</p>
<p>The "Witness. But as far as myself was concerned, as being
</p>
<p>cognizant of any tiling of this kind, I had no fears at all; for I was
</p>
<p>not cognizant. When I surrendered inysclf to the Government, I
</p>
<p>surrendered myself because I thought it was my duty. It was hard
</p>
<p>for me to do so, situated as I was with Mrs. Surratt and her family,
</p>
<p>and with John Sun-att ; but it was my duty, and my duty I have
</p>
<p>always regarded it since.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you, at any time during the year 1803, board at a hotel
</p>
<p>called the Reynolds Iiouse ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you become acquainted there with a gentleman who went
</p>
<p>by the name of St. Marie ?
</p>
<p>A. I became acquainted with that gentleman, Henry de St. Marie.
</p>
<p>I will state that some time in 1863, about Easter, I met St. Marie
</p>
<p>at a village in Maryland called EUangowan. This Marie was intro-
</p>
<p>duced to me there by a clergyman by the name of WilUam JIahony.
</p>
<p>He was teaching school at that time, He was a gentleman that
</p>
<p>spoke French, ItaUan, and English fluently; and his manners were
</p>
<p>very fascinating indeed. Ho s;ud that he had come from Jlontreal,
</p>
<p>and that he had been unfortunate in this country ; that he had lost
</p>
<p>some five or six thousand dollars, the proceeds of his farm. He
</p>
<p>stated that he had sold his farm in Canada. He stated that he had
</p>
<p>come to New York, and that ho had embarked on a vessel for the
</p>
<p>purpose of going to South America. He said this vessel was cap-
</p>
<p>tured, and ho was thrown into Fort JIcHenry. He was released from

<p>Fort McHenry, so he said, by the agency of the French consul.
</p>
<p>Destitute of means at that time, he was obhgod to seek some occu-
</p>
<p>pation ; and he met with a farmer in Baltimore, who told him to <n^
</p>
<p>TnS TRIAL. 379
</p>
<p>on his farm, and lie would give him employment. The farmer took
</p>
<p>bim to bis place ; and his occupation, he said, for three weeks, was
</p>
<p>to feed the horses and cows morning and evening. There was a
</p>
<p>young lad}^ I knew at that time who was travelling through that
</p>
<p>porlion of the country for the purpose of collecting money enough
</p>
<p>for the purchase of a melodeon for the church at Ellangowan ; and she
</p>
<p>mot this man St. IMarie, was introduced to him, and she saw that bo
</p>
<p>was a person of education; and she, in her turn, had bim introduced
</p>
<p>to the Rev. Mr. Mahony . Mr. Mabony took him as his teacher ; but St.
</p>
<p>JIarie stated that he did not receive sufficient compensation, and that
</p>
<p>be would like to leave the place. I told him I would do for him all
</p>
<p>I could as soon as I returnc'd to Washington. I was enjiagcd at
</p>
<p>that time in teaching myself. On my return to Washington,  I
</p>
<p>bad been back hardly two weeks,  when returning to my room one
</p>
<p>day, I found St. Jlarie seated there, lie stated that ho was deter-
</p>
<p>mined to remain in Washington, and I should get bim something to
</p>
<p>do anyhow. I applied to Father Wiget, President of Gonzaga Col-
</p>
<p>lege, on F Street, between Ninth and Tenth ; and I recommended
</p>
<p>this gentleman as a good, honest man. I told him he was educated,
</p>
<p>and that he would be of service to him. Father Wiget employed
</p>
<p>bim ; and he had hardly been there two weeks before a vacancy oc-
</p>
<p>curred in my school, and St. Marie 
</p>
<p>AssisT.iNT Judge Advocate Bingham. There is no occasion for
</p>
<p>any further statement on that matter.

<p>By Mr. Aibcen :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you pay his board at the Eeynolds House, or become re-
</p>
<p>sponsible for it ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question,
</p>
<p>and it was waived.
</p>
<p>By JIr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state to you at any time that there was no aristocracy
</p>
<p>at the North, and that be wished to go South?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I object to that. It is
</p>

<p>Me. Aiken. I will vary my question.
</p>
<p>380 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Dill be state, that, if he could not get there in any other way,
</p>
<p>he would join a Federal regiment, and desert ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Jodge Advocate Bingham objected to the question,
</p>
<p>and it wns waived.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Keynolds reported any of bis treasona-
</p>
<p>ble talk and language at that time to the War Department ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question.
</p>
<p>Mk. Aiken stated that this question was but the prelude to a
</p>
<p>series of questions which be proposed to put to the witness for the
</p>
<p>purpose of extracting from liis own lips certain treasonable practices,
</p>
<p>sayings, and professions of his own, for the purijose of impairing bis
</p>
<p>credibility as a witness, and relieving much of the weight of bis testi-
</p>
<p>mony against his [Mr. Aiken's] ebent.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate BiNGiiAMreplied, that, if the counsel
</p>
<p>chose to put a question to the witness about bis own conduct, that
</p>
<p>would lie another thing ; but the question now asked was, whether
</p>
<p>Eeynolds, whom be understood to be a police-oiEcer, had reported
</p>
<p>treasonable practices of St. Marie to the War Department. That
</p>
<p>was a wholly immaterial issue in every way : it was not evidence,
</p>
<p>and therefore should not be admitted before the Court. If the
</p>
<p>counsel chose to ask the witness whether he himself was guilty of
</p>
<p>any treason against his country and Government, nobody would ob-
</p>
<p>ject to it.
</p>
<p>The. Coukt sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Mb. Aiken. As long as the Judge Advocate has informed us
</p>
<p>that be will not object to any questions that may be asked the witness
</p>
<p>as to bis own treasonable conduct, I will ask this question : 
</p>
<p>Q. Did you give notice to St. Marie that he would probably be
</p>
<p>an-ested by the Government?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I bad no time to give notice to St. IMarie. St. Ma-
</p>
<p>rie taught school for me for two weeks ; and be rose one morning
</p>
<p>early, and left. I will state that be afterwards enlisted in a Dela-
</p>
<p>ware regiment as a soldier, and was taken prisoner, and was lodged
</p>
<p>in Castle Thunder. I saw that myself in a paper.

</p>
<p>Q. Are you a clerk in the War Department?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 381
</p>
<p>A. I have been.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you agree, while a clerk in the War Department, to com-
</p>
<p>raunicato to any one of the prisoners at the bar any information you
</p>
<p>mi^ht obtain from that department ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Or any of the secrets of the department ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with a Mr. Howell ?
</p>
<p>A. I have met him at IMrs. Surratt's house.
</p>
<p>Q. What was Howell's first name ?
</p>
<p>A. When he was at the house, he gave the name of Spencer.
</p>
<p>They refused to tell me his right name when he was at the house.
</p>
<p>I afterwards learned from John Surratt that his name was Augustus
</p>
<p>Howell.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you intimate with him while at Mrs. Surratt's house ?
</p>
<p>A. I was introduced to him. I never spoke about giving him
</p>
<p>any information at all : on the contrary, I spoke with a clerk in
</p>
<p>our office. Captain Glcason ; and I said to him, " There is a block-
</p>
<p>ade-runner at Mrs. Surratt's house : shall I have him delivered
</p>
<p>up ? " I agitated the question myself for three days, and decided
</p>
<p>in favor of Surratt. I thought it would be the only time the man
</p>
<p>might be there, and let him go in God's name.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever have any conversation with Howell with refer-
</p>
<p>ence to going South yourself ?
</p>
<p>A. I told him that I would like to be South. I had been a
</p>
<p>student of divinity myself; and I was studying for the diocese of
</p>
<p>Richmond. I told him I would like to be in Richmond for that
</p>
<p>purpose.  for the purpose of continuing my studies.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ofl'er to make any arrangements for you in Richmond
</p>
<p>to get you a place there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it your purpose, in wishing to go to Richmond, to con-
</p>
<p>tinue your theological studies ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>By Mk. Cl.impitt :
</p>
<p>Q. Why had you a greater desire to continue your studies in
</p>
<p>Riclunond than in the North ?
</p>
<p>382 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingh-vm. I object to that ques-
</p>
<p>tion. It is wholly immaterial what reasons he had for that.
</p>
<p>]\Ir. Clampitt. It is important, and concerns the res gesta of
</p>
<p>the case.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Binqium. Supposing he should
</p>
<p>give an answer, how would you dispose of it ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cumpitt. By further testimony that we may adduce
</p>
<p>hereafter. It may be a connecting link.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You cannot do that in
</p>
<p>that way, as you understand very well. If you had asked him for
</p>
<p>his declarations, I could understand it ; but this is an attempt to
</p>
<p>get at the interior motive of the witness, which you cannot do
</p>
<p>unless you can obtain the power of Omnipotence.
</p>
<p>The question was waived.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Did this man Howell, while you were a clerk in the War
</p>
<p>Department, teach you a ciplicr ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, su- : he showed me an alphabet.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the purpose of his showing you that cipher, as you
</p>
<p>understood it at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. He had no particulai- purpose at all : he stated no particular
</p>
<p>purpose.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not for the purpose of corresponding with you from
</p>
<p>Richmond ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : we made no arrangements alwut conospondina at
</p>
<p>all. The cipher-alphabet was in my bos, and no doubt was found
</p>
<p>there. I once wrote a poem of Longfellow's in it ; and that was the
</p>
<p>only use I made of it. T showed that poem, written in that par-
</p>
<p>ticular cipher, to Jlr. Cruiksliank, a clerk in the War Department.
</p>
<p>Ho was in the habit of making puns and enigmas himself ; and I
</p>
<p>told him that I would give him an enigma which he could not
</p>
<p>make out.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that all the use you ever made of the cipher ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I never had a word of correspondence with How-

</p>
<p>ell ; and I never saw him a second time until I saw him a prisoner.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 383
</p>
<p>Q. Was any objection ever made by any of these prisoners at
</p>
<p>the bar to your being present at any of their conversations ?
</p>
<p>A. Not any objection that I heard ; but they always withdrew
</p>
<p>thcinsolves. 'When Surratt was in the parlor, and Booth would
</p>
<p>call, Surratt and Booth would perhaps converse with me five or
</p>
<p>ten minutes ; and then I noticed that Jolin would tap or nudo-o
</p>
<p>Booth, or eke Booth would nudge Surratt ; and then they would
</p>
<p>go out of the parlor, and stay up stairs for two or three houi-s. I
</p>
<p>had not a word of private conversation with them which I would
</p>
<p>not be willing to have the world hear.
</p>
<p>Q. Had not Howell just returned from Richmond when he
</p>
<p>taught you that cipher?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I believe he came from New York.
</p>
<p>Assistant Jodge Advocate Bcrnett. Will the counsel not
</p>
<p>assume what has not been testified to ? The testimony of the wit-
</p>
<p>ness was, not tliat ho taught him the cipher, but that he showed
</p>
<p>him the cipher. Whether the witness figured it out himself after-
</p>
<p>wards, or learned it from somebody else, is another question.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Howell give you the key of that cipher, or teach it
</p>
<p>to you?
</p>
<p>A. He showed me the cipher : he showed me the alphabet, and
</p>
<p>showed me how to use it.
</p>
<p>Q. Then he taught it to you, did he not ?
</p>
<p>A. I mado no use of it whatever, except in that particular case,
</p>
<p>when I showed it to Mr. Criiikshank, in the War Department.
</p>
<p>Q. That is haidly an answer to my question. He taught you
</p>
<p>the cipher, did he not ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. According to the best of your recollection, how soon was that
</p>
<p>after his return to Richmond ?
</p>
<p>A. He had returned from New York ; and he did not tell me
</p>
<p>when he had come from Richmond, because it was the first and
</p>
<p>only time I over saw the man in my life. He was well acquainted
</p>
<p>with Mrs. Surratt ; and his nickname around the house was Spen-

</p>
<p>cer. He had been in the house a day and a half before I ever
</p>
<p>met him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he tell you that that was a cipher used in Richmond ?
</p>
<p>384 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You state that all the prisoners at tbe bar ^yere free and
</p>
<p>unreserved in your presence in their conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. They spoke in my presence on general topics, and so on ;
</p>
<p>but, on their private business, they never spoke to me.
</p>
<p>Q. Do I understand you as stating to the Court, that, in all
</p>
<p>your conversation with them, you never learned of any intended
</p>
<p>treasonable purpose or act or conspiracy of theirs ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You never did ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And you were not suspicious of any thing of the sort ?
</p>
<p>A. I would have been the last man in the world to suspect
</p>
<p>John Sun-att, my schoolmate, of the murder of the President of
</p>
<p>the United States.
</p>
<p>Q. You state that your suspicions were aroused at one time by
</p>
<p>something you saw at Mrs. Surratt's ?
</p>
<p>A. ]My suspicions were aroused by John Surratt and this man
</p>
<p>Payne and Booth coming to the house. ]\Iy suspicions again were
</p>
<p>aroused by their fiequent private conversations. My suspicions
</p>
<p>were aroused by seeing Payne and Surratt playing on the bed with
</p>
<p>bowie-knives. Jly suspicions were again aroused by finding a false
</p>
<p>mustache in my room.
</p>
<p>Q. Your suspicions were not aroused by the fact that Payne
</p>
<p>came back with three pairs of drawers on, as you stated?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : that was Surratt. I thought he was going to take
</p>
<p>a long ride into the country, and that, perhaps, he was going
</p>
<p>South.
</p>
<p>Q. Then, if your suspicions were aroused on all these different
</p>
<p>occasions whit'h you have mentioned, and you had reason to believe
</p>
<p>that something was in the wind that was improper, did you commu-
</p>
<p>nicate any of them to the War Department ?
</p>
<p>A. 5Iy suspicions were not of a fixed or settled character. I
</p>
<p>did not know what they intended to do. I made a confidant of

</p>
<p>Captain Gleason, in the War Department. I told him that Booth
</p>
<p>was a secesh sympathizer : I mentioned snatches of conversation
</p>
<p>that I would hear from these parties ; and I asked him, " Captain,
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 385
</p>
<p>what do you think of all this?" Wo oven talked over several
</p>
<p>things which they could do. I asked him whether they could be
</p>
<p>boai-ers of despatches or bluekadu-vuimers. At one time I saw in
</p>
<p>the paper the capture of President Lincoln fully discussed ; and I
</p>
<p>remarked to Captain Gleason, " Captain, do you think any party
</p>
<p>could attempt the capture of President Lmcoln ? " lie laughed
</p>
<p>and hooted at the idea.
</p>
<p>Q. You did boai-, then, that the capture of President Lincoln
</p>
<p>was contemplated ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not hear it : it was a casual remark of mine. I saw
</p>
<p>the thing freely discussed in the papers. If you will read the
</p>
<p>" New- York Tribune" of March 19, you will find the details men-
</p>
<p>tioned there. It was merely a casual remark that I mentioned to
</p>
<p>Captain Gleason at the time. This happened before this horseback
</p>
<p>ride ; and, after these pai'ties had been out riding, I remarked to
</p>
<p>Captain Gleason, the next morning, that Sun-att had come back ;
</p>
<p>and I tnld him the very expressions Surratt had used ; and I
</p>
<p>told him, that, to all appearances, what they had been after had
</p>
<p>been a failure, and that I was glad, and that I thought Surratt
</p>
<p>would be recalled to a sense of his duties.
</p>
<p>Q. You stated that what you thought they had been after had
</p>
<p>failed?
</p>
<p>A. Not what I thought they had been after. I did not think,
</p>
<p>even, that the capture of President Lincoln was contemplated. It
</p>
<p>was a casual remark of mine. I had been seeing the subject
</p>
<p>freely discussed in the papers ; and, as I said before, I would have
</p>
<p>thought John Surratt the last man in the world to have contem-
</p>
<p>plated such a thing.
</p>
<p>Q. How came you to connect the discussion which you read in
</p>
<p>the papers with any of these parties, and have your suspicions
</p>
<p>aroused against them ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I object to the ques-
</p>
<p>tion. It is no matter how the man's mental processes worked.
</p>
<p>We cannot inquue into that.

<p>Mr. Aiken. It will be recollected that yesterday, in the ques-
</p>
<p>VOL. I. 33
</p>
<p>386 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>tions from the Court to one of the witnesses, he was asked what his
</p>
<p>impressions were, and it was not objected to.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate BrxonAM. Tlie question is now,
</p>
<p>how he came to form certain conclusions. We cannot fry a ques-
</p>
<p>tion of that sort. No court on earth could do it. It is a thing we
</p>
<p>cannot understand, nor anybody else ; and perb.aps the witness him-
</p>
<p>self, at this time of day, would not be able to state what controlled
</p>
<p>liis mental operations at that time.
</p>
<p>Mk. AiEtEN. I insist on my question.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Adtocate Bixgeam. The witness has already
</p>
<p>gone on and told all he can tell, and given declarations ; and now
</p>
<p>he is asked to state how he came to connect them with the news-
</p>
<p>paper article. Of what use is that to anybody ? I object to it as
</p>
<p>a wholly immaterial and irrelevant question. No matter how the
</p>
<p>witness answers, it can throw no light on the subject in favor of or
</p>
<p>against the prisoners.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. But the Judge Advocate is aware that the witness
</p>
<p>did not tell all he wished to know in the examination in chief, and,
</p>
<p>in his rc-oxamination, went into matter not brought out in the exam-
</p>
<p>ination in chief, or in the cross-examination, which was not objected
</p>
<p>to either by us.
</p>
<p>The Court sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you understand yourself as being on intimate personal
</p>
<p>relations with the prisoners at the bar ?
</p>
<p>A. Not intimate ]icrsonal relations. I met them merely because
</p>
<p>I was boarding at Mrs. Surratt's house. I have never been on
</p>
<p>personal relations with the man Pajme, nor have I been on personal
</p>
<p>relations with Atzerodt. I never had a word of correspondence with
</p>
<p>either of them. I mot Atzerodt and Payne, and went to the theatre
</p>
<p>with him [Atzerodt]. I looked upon him, as everyone in the house
</p>
<p>looked upon him, in fact, as a good-hearted countryman.
</p>
<p>Q. But you were a room-mate of Surratt's?
</p>
<p>A. John Surratt has been my companion for seven years now.
</p>
<p>Q. And did you still profess to be a friend and confidant of his

</p>
<p>at the time you were giving this information to the War Dcpai-tment
</p>
<p>that you speak of?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 387
</p>
<p>A. I was a friend so far as lie himself was concerned ; but, when
</p>
<p>my suspicions were aroused as to the danger to the Government in
</p>
<p>any particular, I preferred the Government to John Surratt. I did
</p>
<p>not know what ho was contemplating. He said he was going to
</p>
<p>engage in cotton speculations ; ho was going to engage in oil.
</p>
<p>Q. If you did not know what he was contemplating, how could
</p>
<p>you forfeit youi' friendship to him ? What is the rationale of that
</p>
<p>proceeding V
</p>
<p>A. I never forfeited my friendship to him : he forfeited his
</p>
<p>fi-icndship to me.
</p>
<p>Q. Not by engaging in the cotton speculation ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : by placing me in the position in which I now am, 
</p>
<p>testifying against him.
</p>
<p>Q. But you could not, of course, have been aware that you
</p>
<p>would be placed in any such position ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I was more of a friend to him than lie was to me.
</p>
<p>I knew that he permitted a blockade-runner at the house without
</p>
<p>informing upon him, because I was his friend. I thought of it for
</p>
<p>thice days.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. I do not know that we have any thing further to
</p>
<p>ask fi'om the witness in cross-examination. Wo propose to make
</p>
<p>him our own witness at a subsequent stage of the trial. We are
</p>
<p>not very tender of him, at any rate.
</p>
<p>A member of the Court desiring an explanation of the last
</p>
<p>remark, 
</p>
<p>Me. Aiken said, Tlie remark, so far as the witness is concerned,
</p>
<p>in the way in which it was made, was made simply with reference to
</p>
<p>his time that we were occupying, and the [ihysical fatigue which he
</p>
<p>may bo undergoing,  no more in the world.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke of a pubUcation in the " Tribune " of March 19
</p>
<p>in regard to a jilot to captiue the President ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

</p>
<p>Q. Cannot you, by connecting that publication with this ride
</p>
<p>388 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>which you said these parties had in the country, fix more closely
</p>
<p>the time ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know where they rode to.
</p>
<p>Q. I do not ask that. Cannot you, by connecting that publican
</p>
<p>tion in the " Tribune," which you saw, with the parties coming in
</p>
<p>on that occasion from the ride, now inform the Court whether it was
</p>
<p>before or after that puljlication of JIarch 19 ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was after.
</p>
<p>Q. It was after the publication of March 19?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Then it must have been about the time of Booth's playing
</p>
<p>Pescara in the " Apostate " ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I will also state that I saw in the " Republican,"
</p>
<p>some time in February, tliat the a.ssassination of President Lincoln
</p>
<p>was contemplated ; and Surratt once made the remark to me, that, if
</p>
<p>he succeeded in his cotton speculation, his country would love him
</p>
<p>forever, and that his name would go down green to posterity.
</p>
<p>Q. You think this occa.sion, when they ap])eared to have come
</p>
<p>in from a ride in the country, was after the publication of March 19
</p>
<p>in the " New- York Tribune " ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, su\
</p>
<p>Q. Was it very shortly after ?
</p>
<p>A. It was between JIarch 19 and the time Booth played.
</p>
<p>Q. The understanding is that Booth played on the 18th of
</p>
<p>March?
</p>
<p>A. I think he played Pescara on the 2Gth of JIarch. It
</p>
<p>was after this publication that I saw it. I did not connect the cap-
</p>
<p>ture of President Lincoln with those parties at all. Wlien I made
</p>
<p>that remark to Captain Gloason at the War Department, it was mei-ely
</p>
<p>a casual remark. I said to him, " Captain, do you suppose anybody
</p>

</p>
<p>Lincoln could be captured?" lie laughed at the idea ; he hooted
</p>
<p>it ; and he said, not in a city guarded as Washington was. It was
</p>
<p>merely a casual remark of mine ; it was merely a thought.

<p>Q. Was that remark to Ca])tain Glcason after these parties came
</p>
<p>in apparently from a ride in the country ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was the morning after I stated to Captain Gleason
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 389
</p>
<p>that SuiTatt's mysterious and incomprehensible business had failed ;
</p>
<p>and I said, " Captain, let us think it over, and let us thinli of some-
</p>
<p>thing thut it coulil have been." We mentioned a variety of things,
</p>
<p> blocljade-ruuuing, bearing despatches ; and we then thought of
</p>
<p>breaking open the old Capitol Prison : but all those ideas vanished ;
</p>
<p>we struck nothing ; and so the thing has rested. I will state, that,
</p>
<p>since that ride, my suspicions were not so much aroused as before,
</p>
<p>because Payne has not been to the house since ; and Atzerodt, to
</p>
<p>my knowledge, had not been to the house since the 2d of April.
</p>
<p>The only one that visited the house dui'ing that time was this man
</p>
<p>Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner Arnold ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I never saw him.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whore St. Charles College is?
</p>
<p>A. St. Charles College is in Iloward County, Md., about live
</p>
<p>miles from Ellicott's Mills.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it not in Charles County ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : it is in Howard County.
</p>
<p>Q. You have stated that you first met the prisoner, Dr. Samuel
</p>
<p>Mudd, on Seventh Street, opposite Odd Fellows Hall 'i
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whereabouts on H Street Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>lived. Was it nearer Seventh Street, or nearer to Sixth Street ?
</p>
<p>A. It was next to Sixth.
</p>
<p>Q. The next door to Sixth Street?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was the first house on H Street from Sixth Street.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not the Pennsylvania House,
</p>
<p>at which Dr. Mudd stopped, and the National Hotel, at which Booth
</p>
<p>stopped, are not both between Four and a Half and Sixth Streets.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Then the point where you met Dr. Samuel Mudd on Seventh
</p>
<p>Street would not be in the route between either the National Hotel
</p>
<p>or the Pennsylvania House and ]Mrs. Surratt's residence?

<p>A. I should think it was the most direct route to the National

</p>
<p>Q. You do not understand my question. Is the point on Seventh
</p>
<p>Street, at which you tnct Dr. Mudd that morning, on the direct route
</p>
<p>between the Pennsylvania Hotel and Mrs. Surratt's?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>Q. State what you know about it.
</p>
<p>A. In passing down F Street on the morning after the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion, I had just crossed Eighth Street, going towards Ninth, when I
</p>
<p>saw a colored woman pick up something in the gutter. She was
</p>
<p>about ten feet from me ; and, when I got to her, I asked her what it
</p>
<p>was ; and she gave a knife to me in a sheath. I examined it. A
</p>
<p>lady in the third-story window of the house next to where Creaser
</p>
<p>keeps a shoe-store said she saw this in the gutter, and sent the col-
</p>
<p>ored woman down to get it ; but she did not want it to come into

<p>James L. McPeail,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not, in a conversation you had
</p>
<p>with the prisoner Atzcrodt, he said, that, on tlie night of the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation of tlio President, he had thrown his knife away in the streets
</p>
<p>of Washington.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he did.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. I object to that question.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. Waat is the objection ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Dosteu. The objection is, that it will involve a confession
</p>
<p>made (if made at all) under duress.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate (to the witness). I ask you, then, under
</p>
<p>what circumstances the statement was made ; and the Court will
</p>
<p>determine whether it was under duress or not.
</p>
<p>A. I received an intimation, coming from Mr. Atzcrodt, that ho
</p>
<p>desired to see me : that was all.
</p>
<p>Q. You went to see him accordingly?

<p>THE TRIAL. 397
</p>
<p>By Mr. Dostek :
</p>
<p>Q. Was he not in irons at tlie time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he was in a coll in the prison, and in irons.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. I respectfully submit that a confession made under
</p>
<p>such circumstances is not admissible ; because it was made under
</p>
<p>duress, which put the mind of the prisoner in a state of fear.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I think nothing is clearer than that, if
</p>
<p>there was neither threat nor promise, the fact that the man was in
</p>
<p>prison, or even in irons, docs not affect the question of his mental
</p>
<p>liberty. A man's hmbs may be chained, and his mind be perfectly
</p>
<p>free to speak the truth, or to conceal it, if he chooses.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster, in support of Ms objection, quoted from the case of
</p>
<p>Commonwealth vs. Mosler (4 Barr's Reports, 265), to the effect
</p>
<p>that a confession to an oflBcer, as well as to a private person, must
</p>
<p>be unattended with any inducement of hope or fear, and must be
</p>
<p>founded on no question calculated to entrap the prisoner ; and re-
</p>
<p>ferred also to 1 Leech, 263 ; 2 East's Pleas of the Crown ; 2 Rus-
</p>
<p>sell on Crimes, 644 ; 1 Washing-ton's Circuit-Court Reports, 625 ;
</p>
<p>1 Chitty's Criminal Law, 85; 1 Greeuloaf on Evidence, 214;
</p>
<p>2 Starkie, 36.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate admitted the law to be as stated in the au-
</p>
<p>thorities cited.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. Is not a statement made by a man in irons one
</p>
<p>made under duress? I claim that the prisoner was under the influ-
</p>
<p>ence of fear when he made that confession, and, without that influ-
</p>
<p>ence, would not have made it.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I think it is due to the witness that he
</p>
<p>should be allowed to state precisely under what circumstances this
</p>
<p>confession was made; and, if there is a trace of fear or hope or incite-
</p>

</p>
<p>visit the prison. It was repeatedly stated to me that Atzerodt
</p>
<p>wished to see me, and that another prisoner did ; and I visited the
</p>
<p>prison after consultation with the Secretary of War, who gave me a
</p>
<p>pass, for the purpose of gratifying the prisoner. There was no
</p>
<p>threat : on the contrary, I told him I could make no promises to
</p>
<p>him ; I had nothing to say to him whatever ; if he had any thing to
</p>
<p>say to me, say it. That was all ; and I tried to get away from Um.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. What is your profession or business ?
</p>
<p>A. I am acting under the War Department in Maryland. I
</p>
<p>Lave been during the war.
</p>
<p>Q. In what capacity?
</p>
<p>A. Provost-marshal of the State. Bly commission reads, " The
</p>
<p>police and loyalty of the State."
</p>
<p>Q. Did he know that you were provost-marshal ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he did.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Was not this conversation on a gunboat ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I saw him on the gunboat.
</p>
<p>Q. TVhcrc was it?
</p>
<p>A. In the cell of this prison. I saw him first on the gunboat. I
</p>
<p>will further state that the brother-in-law of Atzerodt is on my force,
</p>
<p>and the brother of Atzerodt has been temporarily on it ; and they
</p>
<p>were repeatedly after me to go to see Atzerodt, and the Secretary
</p>
<p>of War was acquainted with the same fact. I had no desire, as I
</p>
<p>said before, to see him : I merely went to accommodate them.
</p>
<p>I asked him not a single question as to a confession. I said simply,
</p>
<p>" "ttTiat you have to say, say it ; for I want to go : I cannot stay."
</p>
<p>The Commission overruled the objection.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. The question was answered, and the
</p>
<p>answer will stand as recorded.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Was his statement, that he had thrown away his knife, all he
</p>
<p>said?
</p>
<p>to me.

</p>
<p>fore I spoke to him.

<p>on the 14th of April, ami remained in Richmond until the 21st of

<p>A. It was picked up either in the building or immediately about
</p>
<p>the building, or was handed mc by some soldier, who had picked it
</p>
<p>up among the rubbish, as I went about the rooms. There were one
</p>
<p>or two periwns with me. We would stoop down, and handle over
</p>
<p>the papers, and, as we judged any thing important, put it in the
</p>
<p>pocket ; and in some instances the orderly in attendance  for I had
</p>
<p>a permit from the provost-marshal  would say, " This is something
</p>
<p>good ; " put it in my pocket : and, having thus collected quite a num-
</p>
<p>ber of things, they were thrown into a common receptacle, which
</p>
<p>finally became a box. We transferred the papers to a box, and they
</p>
<p>were forwarded to Chicago.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that one of the papers?

<p>His ExccUency Jtffwson Davis, President C. S. A.
</p>
<p>Sir,  When Senator Johnson of Missouii and myself waited on
</p>
<p>406 THE T ni A L.
</p>
<p>you a few days since in relation to the prospnct of annoying and
</p>
<p>harassing the enemy by means of burning their shipping, towns, &c.,
</p>
<p>&e., there were several remarks made by you upon the subject, that
</p>
<p>I was not fully prepared to answer, but which, upon subsequent con-
</p>
<p>ference witli parties proposing the enterprise, I find cannot apply as
</p>
<p>obj(;ctions to the scheme.
</p>
<p>1 . The combustible material consists of several preparations, and
</p>
<p>not one alone; and can be used without exposing the party usin"'
</p>
<p>them to the least danger of detection whatever. The preparations
</p>
<p>are not in the hands of McDaniel, but are in the hands of Professor
</p>
<p>MeCullough, and are known but to him and one other party, as I
</p>
<p>understand.
</p>
<p>2. There is no necessity for sending persons in the railiLiry ser-
</p>
<p>vice into the enemy's country ; but the work may be done by agents,
</p>
<p>and, in most cases, by persons ignorant of the facts, and therefore in-
</p>
<p>nocent agents.
</p>
<p>I have seen enough of the effects that can be produced to satisfy
</p>
<p>me that in most cases, without any danger to the parties engaged,
</p>
<p>and in others but very slight, we can, 1. Burn every ves.*el that
</p>
<p>leaves a foreign port for the United States. 2. We can burn every
</p>
<p>transport that leaves the harbor of New York or other Northern
</p>
<p>port with supplies for the armies of the enemy in the South. 3.
</p>
<p>Burn every transport and gunboat on the Jlississippi Eiver, as well
</p>
<p>as devastate the country of the enemy, and fill his people with ter-
</p>
<p>ror and consternation. I am not alone in this opinion ; but many
</p>
<p>other gentlemen are as fully and thoroughly impressed with the con-
</p>
<p>viction as I am. I believe we have the means at our command, if
</p>
<p>promptly appropriated and energetically applied, {o demoralize the
</p>
<p>Northern people in a very short time. For the purpose of satisfying
</p>
<p>your mind upon the subject, I respectfully but earnestly rccpiest
</p>
<p>that you will have an interview with General Harris, formerly a
</p>
<p>member of Congress from Missouri, who, I think, is able, from con-
</p>
<p>clusive proofs, to convince you that what I have suggested is perfectly
</p>
<p>feasible and practicable.

</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as

<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not you are acquainted with
</p>
<p>the handwriting of Jefferson Davis.
</p>
<p>A. I was, eight years ago, when he was Secretary of War. I
</p>
<p>was requisition-clerk ; and he had to sign all the requisitions that
</p>
<p>came before me every day.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you look at the indorsement upon the paper signed "J.
</p>
<p>D.," and just read by Mr. Potts, and state whether or not you re-
</p>
<p>gard it as in the handwriting of Jefferson Davis ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think it was.
</p>
<p>Q. You had ample opportunities of becoming acquainted with his
</p>
<p>handwriting ?
</p>
<p>A. Very good : I had from ten to twenty-five signatures of his
</p>
<p>before me every day, sometimes signed in my presence, but not al-
</p>
<p>ways so.

</p>
<p>A. He was professor of chemistry at Princeton College ; he was a
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 409
</p>
<p>professor of mathematics at Jefferson College, Penn., where I grad-
</p>
<p>uated ; and about 1839 or 1840, if my recollection serves mc, ho
</p>
<p>was assayor of the mint at Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whore he has been during the present Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. From information that I consider reliable, he has been at
</p>
<p>Richmond, in the service of the Confederates. I may say that his
</p>
<p>father was one of the comptrollers of the Treasury in Washington.
</p>
<p>I think name was Hugh MeCullough ; the same name as the present
</p>
<p>secretary.
</p>
<p>Q. This MeCullough had some distinction as a chemist ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; considerable. Perhaps more in that than any
</p>
<p>thing else.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it in that capacity that he has been in the service of the
</p>
<p>Confederates, as you understand ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.
</p>
<p>A. B. Olin,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Judge, will you state to the Court whether or not, on the
</p>
<p>morning of the 15th of April, you visited Ford's Theatre, and in-
</p>
<p>spected the President's box, as it is called there ?
</p>
<p>A. Sunday following, the 16th, I first visited the theatre. The
</p>
<p>assassination was on the evening of the 14th; and on the 15th I
</p>
<p>was engaged in taking depositions.
</p>
<p>Q. WiU you state the examination which you made, and the
</p>
<p>condition in which you found the box and doors and locks ?
</p>
<p>A. My attention was called to the incision into the wall that was
</p>
<p>prepared to receive the brace that fitted into the corner of the pan-
</p>
<p>el of the door. The brace was not there.
</p>
<p>Q. That is the outer door you speak of?
</p>
<p>A. The door entering the alley-way into the box which crossed
</p>
<p>the alley at an angle with the wall ; and a brace fitted against the wall
</p>
<p>to the corner of the door fastens the door very securely. I discov-

</p>
<p>ered that, and looked for the remains of the plastering that had
</p>
<p>been cut firom the wall to make this incision. That was all, so far
</p>

</p>
<p>410 THE TlilAL.
</p>
<p>as I cnuld observe, carefully removcil from a little carpet, where it
</p>
<p>must have fallen as it was cut by some sharp instrument. Tliat
</p>
<p>plastering was all carefully removed.
</p>
<p>It was said to mo that the pistol was discharged through the
</p>
<p>panel of the door. The passage-way is somewhat dark ; and 1 pro-
</p>
<p>cured a light, and examined very carefully the hole bored through
</p>
<p>the door. I discovered at once that that hole was made by some
</p>
<p>small instrument in the first place, and was, a.s I supposed, cut out
</p>
<p>then by a sharp instmment Uke a penknife ; and you can see, by
</p>
<p>placing a light near the door,  if I am not very much mistaken, I
</p>
<p>thought I saw,  marks of a shai-p-cutting knife, cleaning out every
</p>
<p>obstacle to looking through that hole in the door. I then discovered
</p>
<p>also that the clasp that fastens the bolt of the first door,  this
</p>
<p>would be a double box on some occasions, there is a movable parti-
</p>
<p>tion fitted to it,  on the clasp that receives the lock of that door,
</p>
<p>the upper screw holding the clasp had been loosened in such a way,
</p>
<p>that when the door was locked, by putting ray forefinger against the
</p>
<p>door, and pushing it, I could push the door open.
</p>
<p>I seated myself as near as I could ascertain the position of the
</p>
<p>chair in which the President .sat that evening ; for I procured, to
</p>
<p>accompany me. Miss Harris, who, I understood, was in the box on
</p>
<p>that occasion ; and she located the chair as nearly as she recollect-
</p>
<p>ed it to have been placed on the evening. And in seating myself
</p>
<p>in the chair, closing that door, and letting a person place his eye
</p>
<p>very near that hole, close to the door, the range would be about
</p>
<p>from one to the other, striking my head about midway from the
</p>
<p>base to the crown.
</p>
<p>I directed my attention principally, at that early stage of the in-
</p>
<p>vestigation, to ascertaining more particularly the precise period of
</p>
<p>the occurrence, as there was some uncertainty at that time whether
</p>
<p>the attack upon Jlr. Seward's family, and the assassination of the
</p>
<p>President, was the result of the act of some one person or more
</p>
<p>persons ; and I directed my attention in the first place more partic-
</p>
<p>ularly to ascertaining the precise period of time as nearly as I
</p>
<p>tions.

<p>could when this occurred. I continued to make some examina-
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine the conditions of the locks on the doors?
</p>
<p>THE TlilAL. 411
</p>
<p>A. I (lid. I examined the condition of the locks. The lock
</p>
<p>played readily.
</p>
<p>Q. A hasp, or catch ?
</p>
<p>A. As I before observed, the eatoli of one door, the first door
</p>
<p>that would enter into the first box as you passed into the box from
</p>
<p>this alloy-way, the upper screw holding the hasp was loosened in
</p>
<p>such a way, that it could be pressed upon with the finger when the
</p>
<p>door was locked, and the hasp would fall back. I also examined
</p>
<p>to see if I could discover the chips that must have been made by
</p>
<p>boring and cutting out this small hole ; but they had appai-ently
</p>
<p>been removed. I discovered nothing of them.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the bar ? or had it been lost ?
</p>
<p>A. It had been removed by some one. You could see the in-
</p>
<p>dentation upon the door, in the panel of tlie door, where some brace
</p>
<p>might have been made from the wall to the door. That indenta-
</p>
<p>tion there is perceptible ; and the brace was so fixed in, that it
</p>
<p>would be very difficult to remove it from the outside. I do not
</p>
<p>think it could be done without breaking the door down. The more
</p>
<p>pressure that was made from the dress-circle of the theatre upon
</p>
<p>that bar, the firmer it would have been held in its place : but it
</p>
<p>was securely fastened in its place ; for it rested on that hole in the
</p>
<p>wall and the panel of the door.
</p>
<p>Q. Did it bear the appearance of having been recently made ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. It was a freshly cut hole. The wood was as fresh
</p>
<p>as it would have been the instant it was cut, apparently, to the ob-
</p>
<p>servation.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you describe the chair ?
</p>
<p>A. It is a largo, high-backed arm-chair, and satin cushions.
</p>
<p>Q. A rocking-chair?
</p>
<p>A. I think, not a rocking-chair. From nearly opposite the place
</p>
<p>where the President's head might have rested against the chair, I
</p>
<p>think I could discover, although it was red, the marks of several
</p>
<p>drops of blood.

</p>
<p>A. They are in operation ; at least, they were before I adjourned

</p>
<p>By BIr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you be kind enough to state whether the civil courts
</p>
<p>are supposed to sit by the consent of, and in order to carry out the
</p>
<p>will of, (joiioral Grant?
</p>
<p>A. I really do not know how anybody supposes that. He has
</p>
<p>given me no information on that subject.
</p>
<p>Major Henry R. Rathbone
</p>
<p>recalled.
</p>
<p>By the Jddge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. After the shot had been fired, did you go to the outer door
</p>
<p>of the President's box, and examine how it was closed '(
</p>
<p>A. I did, sir, for the purpose of calling medical aid.
</p>
<p>Q. In what condition did you find it ?
</p>
<p>A. I found the door barred, so that the people who were knock-
</p>
<p>ing on the outside could not gain an entrance.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you make an attempt to remove the bar?
</p>
<p>A. I did, sir ; and removed it with difficulty.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that after you had received the stab from the assassin ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a bar to the witness.] Is that blood on that
</p>
<p>wooden bar from your arm ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not able to say that ; but my wound was bleeding free-
</p>
<p>ly at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. In what condition did you find the bar ?
</p>
<p>A. The bar was securely fastened in the wall, and appeared to
</p>
<p>be resting against th(! moulding of tho door. I tliink it ci5uld not
</p>
<p>have been jostled out by any pushing from tho outside.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice particularly the chair in which the President
</p>
<p>sat ? What was its character ?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing, except that it was a large, easy-chair, covered.with
</p>
<p>damask cloth.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know whether it had I'ookcrs or not?

</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Is that the bar the door was closed with ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not able to say.

<p>Q. Was it similar to that ?

<p>Isaac Jaquette,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a bar to the witness.] Will you please state to
</p>
<p>the Court whether or not you found that bar in Ford's Theatre,
</p>
<p>and under what circumstances, and where ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Soon after the President was can-led out, I went
</p>
<p>to the box with several others ; and this bar was lying inside of
</p>
<p>the first door going into the box,  lying on the floor. I picked
</p>
<p>it up. I staid around there some time, and then carried it out.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you take it home with you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. There has been a piece sawed off, has there not ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. There was an officer stopping at the same board-
</p>
<p>ing-house where I was ; and he wanted a piece of it. I sawed a
</p>
<p>piece off ; but he concluded not to take it afterwards.
</p>
<p>Q. These spots upon it are blood ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they fresh at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. They looked fresh at the time.
</p>
<p>[The bar was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Joe Sijims (colored)
</p>
<p>recalled for the prosecution.

<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not you have been working at
</p>
<p>Ford's Theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I have worked at Sir. Ford's Theatre for two
</p>
<p>years.

<p>414 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you there oa the evening of the day on the night of
</p>
<p>which the President was assassinated 1
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the persons engaged in decorating the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's box that afternoon V
</p>
<p>A. IMr. Hurry Ford and another geutleinuu, 1 ilo not know his
</p>
<p>name exactly, were up there fixing up the box. Mr. Hany Ford
</p>
<p>told me to go up to hi.s bed-room, and get a rocking<-hair out, and
</p>
<p>brin" it down, and put it in the President's box. I did so, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to his orders. When I carried the chair into the private box,
</p>
<p>and set it down, Mr. Harry Ford said, " You can go down ; that is
</p>
<p>all I want ; " and I immediately passed down the stairs.
</p>
<p>Q. You carried it into the box yourself, did you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. He told me to bring it out of his sleeping-room,
</p>
<p>and put it into the private box.
</p>
<p>Q. Had it ever been there before?
</p>
<p>A. Not this season.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a rocking-chair ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How was the back, high or low ?
</p>
<p>A. It was a chair with a high back to it.
</p>
<p>Q. And cushioned?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Edward Spangler, there on that
</p>
<p>occasion 1
</p>
<p>A. Not at that time. There was no one in the box at that time
</p>
<p>but Mr. Harry Ford and the other gentleman that was helping to
</p>
<p>fix it. IIo had started to go down when he told mo to go after the
</p>
<p>chair.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Spangler on the stage that aflcmoou when you were
</p>
<p>bringing the chair?
</p>
<p>A. IMr. Spangler was obliged to bo there : he was there all the
</p>
<p>time.

<p>A. He was there that afternoon. He was obliged to be there.
</p>
<p>There was no other place for him. He worked there altogether, the

</p>
<p>same as I did ; and liad no calling away, only when he went to his
</p>
<p>boarding-house.
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that ho was in there when the chair
</p>
<p>was put in the box '!
</p>
<p>A. I did not see Mr. Spangler in the private box. I carried it
</p>
<p>up; but I did not say Mr. Spangler was in there.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he on the stage at the time, do you know?
</p>
<p>A. He might have been ou the stage, or somewhere about the
</p>
<p>building.
</p>
<p>"S-
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Evying :
</p>
<p>Q. You say Mr. Spangler might have been on the stage then ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not see him then ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not see him. I did not notice particular.
</p>
<p>When Mr. Harry Ford told me to go up in his room, and bring
</p>
<p>down the chair, of course I went, not noticing particular, which I
</p>
<p>hardly ever did. I have been there so long at work, that I hardly
</p>
<p>ever notice persons so particular; but this Mr. Spangler had no
</p>
<p>other calling away in the week, only right at the theatre, on the
</p>
<p>stage, except when called up to his boarding-house.
</p>
<p>Q. You say ho had no "other caUing away." You mean that
</p>
<p>was all the business he was engaged in '!
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that was his business.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know whether he might not have had something
</p>
<p>to call him away from the theatre just at that time, do you'?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was this other gentleman that was in the box with Mr.
</p>
<p>Harry Ford ?
</p>
<p>A. I think his name is Mr. Buckingham : I may be mistaken.
</p>
<p>Q. 'W^as he employed about the theatre '!
</p>
<p>A. He stood at the door at nights to take the tickets when the
</p>
<p>people came in. Ho was doorkeeper in front of the house.

</p>
<p>Q. Wbat liour in tho aflfrnoon was it?

<p>A. It was a little after three o'clock, I think. T did not notice
</p>
<p>the time particuhu-ly : it might have been later, auJ it might have
</p>
<p>been sooner.
</p>
<p>Q. Mr. Ford called you to come up to the box, did he?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I was doing something somewhere around the
</p>
<p>building; and he called me, and told me to go to his room, and bring
</p>
<p>down that large rocking-chair out of his sleeping-room, and put it in

<p>the private box. I did so, according to Ms order.
</p>
<p>Q. Where were you when he called you ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know exactly where I was,  whether I was out in
</p>
<p>the alley, or whether I was up on the flies ; but I was somewhere
</p>
<p>about the building, I kuow, when he called me.
</p>
<p>Q. You were near enough to hear when called?
</p>
<p>A. I had come in from carrying bills. I carried the bills out
</p>
<p>eveiy day, so that the people could see what was going to be played ;
</p>
<p>and I came back that evening, and was about to take my meal, 
</p>
<p>was going to eat up on the flies,  when he called me. He called
</p>
<p>me down, and told me to go up to his room, and get tho chair.
</p>
<p>Q. You took your meals up on the flies, did you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I used to take my meals there, of coui-se.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did you generally take that meal ?
</p>
<p>A. I generally took it whenever I could. AVheu I came in the
</p>
<p>mornings, I would take out the bills ; and that would kee|) mu some-
</p>
<p>times until three o'clock, and sometimes longer ; and, whenever I
</p>
<p>would come back, I would eat.
</p>
<p>Q. And you were eating when ho called you?
</p>
<p>A. When he called me to bring the chair, I put down my meal,
</p>
<p>and went and got the chair for him, and put it in the private box.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Jlr. Spangler as you went to the box at all ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not see Jlr. Spangler. I did not see him
</p>
<p>when I went to the box, neither did I see him when I came away
</p>
<p>from the private box.
</p>
<p>Q. Describe that chair.

</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a letter to the witness.] Will you state to the

</p>
<p>The letter was read, as follows : 
</p>
<p>HooKSTOWN, Balto. Co., March 27, 1865.
</p>
<p>Dear Joiin,  Was business so important that you could not
</p>
<p>remain in Balto. till I saw you? I came in as soon as I could, hut
</p>
<p>found you had gone to W n. I called also to see Jlike, but
</p>
<p>learned from his mother he had gone out with you, and had not
</p>
<p>returned. I concluded, therefore, he had gone with you. How
</p>
<p>inconsiderate you have been ! Wlien I left you, you stated we
</p>
<p>would not meet in a month or so : therefore I made application
</p>
<p>for employment, an answer to which I shall receive during week.
</p>
<p>I told my parents I had ceased with you. Can I, then, under
</p>
<p>existing circumstances, come as you request ? You know full well
</p>
<p>that the Gr 1 suspicions something is going on there : therefore
</p>
<p>the undertaking is becoming more complicated. Why not, for the
</p>
<p>present, desist, for various reasons, which, if you look into, you can
</p>
<p>readily see, without my making any mention thereof? You nor
</p>
<p>any one can censure me for my present course. You have been

<p>its cause ; for how can I now come after telling them I had left you ?
</p>
<p>Suspicion rests upon mo now from ni}' whole family, and even parties
</p>
<p>in the county. I will bo compelled to leave home anyhow, and
</p>
<p>how soon I care not. None, no, not one, were more in for the en-

<p>terprise than myself, and to-day wouM be there, had you not done

</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the letter.] Will you look at this

<p>letter, and state to the Court whether it is m his handwriting or not ?
</p>
<p>Me. Cox. Before you look at that letter, I will ask you how you
</p>
<p>became acquaiuted with the handwriting of I\Ir. Arnold?
</p>
<p>A. I am acquainted with it from the fact of his having made an
</p>
<p>instrument, and placed it in my hands.
</p>
<p>The witness, after examining the letter, said, " That has some-
</p>
<p>what the appearance of it ; rather a little heavier, I think, in some

</p>
<p>Q. When did he write it ?
</p>
<p>A. On Tuesday, the 18th of April.
</p>
<p>Q. Whore did he write it ?
</p>
<p>A. Ho wrote it in the back-room, in Marshal McPhail's office.
</p>
<p>Q. Where?
</p>
<p>A. Fayette Street, No. 40, between North and Ilolliday.
</p>
<p>Q. What became of the paper ?
</p>
<p>A. The paper was handed by me to the marshal, on his arriving
</p>
<p>from Washington. I do not know what became of it afterwards,
</p>
<p>other than that I was informed that it was delivered to the Secretary
</p>
<p>of War.
</p>
<p>Q. To what marshal?
</p>
<p>A. To Jlarshal James L. McPhail.
</p>
<p>Q. Tliat was a paper purporting to state all that he knew in

<p>regard to this affaur ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>James L. McPhail
</p>
<p>recalled for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the letter.] Will you state wheth-
</p>
<p>er or not you are acquainted with the handwriting of the prisoner
</p>
<p>Samuel Arnold?
</p>
<p>A. Only by receiving a letter of his from Ms father, dated the
</p>
<p>12th. This looks similar to the writing of that letter.
</p>
<p>Q. Did that letter purport to be written by him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; written and dated the 12th of April, at Fortress
</p>
<p>Monroe. That letter was in the hands of Mr. Wharton.
</p>
<p>Q. In whoso handwriting is the indorsement on the back of tliat

</p>
<p>A. This direction, "J. Wilkos Booth," I should think, was in

<p>M. Samuel Arnold's handwriting.

</p>
<p>Q. You looked at the handwriting ?

</p>
<p>Littleton P. D. Newman,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the handwriting of the prisoner
</p>
<p>Samuel Arnold?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I am not. I never saw it.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know him '?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, some time last fall, you were
</p>
<p>present when he received a letter in which money was enclosed ?
</p>
<p>and, if the letter was exhibited to you, state its character, as far as
</p>
<p>you know.
</p>
<p>A. On the 9th, 10th, or 12th of September, Mr- Arnold had
</p>
<p>been heljiing us to thresh wheat at a neighbor's ; and there was a let-
</p>
<p>ter brought to him. In that letter there was either a twenty or a
</p>
<p>fifty dollar note : I am not positive which. He read the letter, and
</p>
<p>remarked that he was flush, or had money, or something of that
</p>
<p>character. After having read the letter, ho handed it over to me ;
</p>
<p>and I read some half a dozen lines, possibly,  not more. I did not
</p>
<p>understand it ; it was very ambiguous in its language ; and I handed
</p>
<p>it back to him, and asked him what it meant. He remarked that
</p>
<p>something big would take place one of these days, or be seen in the
</p>
<p>paper, or something to that effect. That was about all that
</p>
<p>occurred.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the name signed to the letter?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember whether I looked at that at all.

<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, some days after the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of the President, you arrested the prisoner Sanmcl Arnold,
</p>
<p>and where ?
</p>
<p>A. On the morning of the 17th of April, Mr. Voltaire Russell
</p>
<p>and myself arrested him at Fortress Jlonroe.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you find any arras in his possession ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. We took him iu the room back of the store, where
</p>
<p>he slept. We there searched his person and his carpet-hag. Out
</p>
<p>of the carpet-bag we got a pistol. He said he had another pistol,
</p>
<p>and a knife also, at his f;ither's place in the country, near the Hooks-
</p>
<p>towu Road.
</p>
<p>Q. What kind of pistol did you find in his possession ?
</p>
<p>A. Something like a Colt's pjstol.
</p>
<p>Q. lie said he had left another pistol and a knife at his fother's ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not say he had left the pistol and the knife at
</p>
<p>Hookstown ?
</p>
<p>A. At his fiithcr's place.
</p>
<p>Q. At Hookstown 'i
</p>
<p>A. Near Hookstown.
</p>
<p>Q. What else did he say to you at that time?
</p>
<p>A. He made a statement verbally to us at Fortress Monroe.
</p>
<p>Before we left Baltimore, a letter was given to us by his father to
</p>
<p>give him when we should arrest him. We handed him the letter,
</p>
<p>and he read it. I inquued of him if he was going to do as tlicy
</p>
<p>asked him to do ; and he said he was. He then gave us a statement
</p>
<p>and the names of certain men connected with a plan for the abduc-
</p>
<p>tion of Abraham Lincoln.

<p>Assistant Jddge Advocate Bingh.vm. I think we did not ask
</p>
<p>for any thing of this sort. What is this question about ?

</p>
<p>as a part of that confession relative to the pistol and knife, I under-
</p>
<p>stand Sir. Ewing to injjist ou these statements.

<p>TBE TlilAL. 425
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. I presume any tbirig relating to the otber piisoners
</p>
<p>will not be allowed to be given in evidence.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate [to the counsel for the accused]. That is
</p>
<p>a question which you must adjust among yourselves, gentlemen.
</p>
<p>Me. Ewing. I will ask the witness tbe^ question, what else
</p>
<p>Arnold stated in that conversation. Does the Judge Advocate
</p>
<p>object to the question ?
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I do not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone. We object, may it please the Court, to the con-
</p>
<p>fession of any one of tlio accused being offered in eviilcnce as against
</p>
<p>cither of the other accused ; to allowing the declarations of one of
</p>
<p>the accused to be used against any of the other accused, when he
</p>
<p>himself is not a competent witness to be placed in the box. In
</p>
<p>other words, we object that the declarations of Arnold cannot be
</p>
<p>used to convict the other seven, or any of them. Blere declarations
</p>
<p>made by him  and made, perhaps, for the purpose of shoving the
</p>

</p>
<p>JIr. Ewing. The objection having just been formally presented,
</p>
<p>I should like to make a remark or two to the Court on the subject.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate asked what Arnold said about ai-ms ; and the
</p>
<p>witness said that he answered, that he had another pistol and a knife
</p>
<p>at his father's house near Hookstown. I asked what further he said ;
</p>
<p>and think the whole of his statement then made is admissible, as it
</p>
<p>goes to account for his possession of the arms, and explains the pos-
</p>
<p>session. It is very true, that the confession of one of the accused
</p>
<p>in a conspiracy or alleged conspiracy, after the conspiracy has been
</p>
<p>either executed or abandoned, is not admissible,  that is, will not
</p>
<p>be considered by the Court in weighing the question of the guilt or
</p>
<p>innocence of those who are associated with him in the charge ; but
</p>
<p>that is a rule of law which should not be so applied as to cut off one
</p>
<p>of the accused from giving in evidence any statement which he made
</p>
<p>accompanying such an uicident as his confession of the possession of

</p>
<p>tion which the counsel takes is an'objcetion which I admit to be well
</p>
<p>talccii to that extent, but not to the extent of excluding his confes-
</p>
<p>sion from being given in evidence in vindication of Arnold. It is
</p>
<p>well taken to exclude whatever confession Arnold made at the time
</p>
<p>from being weighed by the Court when they come to consider the
</p>
<p>case of those who are* associated with him in the charges : that is,
</p>
<p>counsel should state their objection when they come to argue the
</p>
<p>case as presented, and ask the Court, in making up its judgment
</p>
<p>from the evidence as to the guilt or innocence of the others who are
</p>
<p>bcluded with Arnold in the charge, to exclude Arnold's confession,
</p>
<p>and not allow it to have any weight in their minds as against others.
</p>
<p>That I conceive to be the true law of the case.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. If it please the Court, I do not suppose anybody
</p>
<p>objects to any explanation, any additional statement made by the
</p>
<p>accused, Arnold, which may tend to explain his possession of the
</p>
<p>arms found on his person, or in his possession, to exonerate him-
</p>
<p>self I think that is proper testimony, and is fairly admissible ;
</p>
<p>but that may be admitted without admitting any thing which refers
</p>
<p>to other parties. It is admitted by the counsel who has just re-
</p>
<p>sumed his seat, that any confession made after the termination of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, or its execution or abandonment by one of the original
</p>
<p>conspirators, would not be competent evidence against any other of
</p>
<p>the parties accused. That is conceded to be the law. He main-
</p>
<p>tains, however, that this Court ought to admit the evidence, and
</p>
<p>exclude it from their consideration ; Irat I take it, that is not the
</p>
<p>rule which governs courts-martial, as it certainly docs not govern
</p>
<p>any other courts in the consideration of evidence. ^Tiatevcr is not
</p>
<p>competent evidence is not allowed to go to a jury at all ; it is ex-
</p>
<p>cluded from their consideration entirely : and I take it for granted
</p>
<p>that this Court, having to determine both the law (under the gui-
</p>
<p>dance and advice of the learned Judge Advocate) and the facts of
</p>
<p>the case, will discard entirely from the record all evidence which is
</p>
<p>clearly inadmissible, and which ought not to be weighed adversely
</p>
<p>to a prisoner ; because it is impossible for any man, in the nature

</p>
<p>although it may be incompetent and illegal evidence. I submit
</p>
<p>therefore to the Court, with'great confidence, that this evidence, so
</p>
<p>far as it relates to any other or others of the accused, ought to be
</p>
<p>entirely excluded. It can be done without depriving the accused,
</p>
<p>Arnold, of the benefit of any exculpatory explanation which accom-
</p>
<p>panies his admission of the possession of these arms.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I desire to say in con- 
</p>
<p>nection with this matter, that, while there can be no dispute about
</p>
<p>the law on the hypothesis assumed by the gentleman who first spoke
</p>
<p>here, the evidence before this Coui-t already in the case  I do not
</p>
<p>desire to say any thing particularly about the letter of Herold in
</p>
<p>this connection, but to speak generally of the evidence  shows
</p>
<p>very well that it is an open question, at all events, whether this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was executed on the day of this man's arrest ; and there-
</p>
<p>fore, in settling this point now of the admission of this man's declara-
</p>
<p>tions, the Court cannot bo expected to decide that the conspiracy
</p>
<p>had been either executed or abandoned on that day. There is tes-
</p>
<p>timony here as to certain other persons that were to be the victims
</p>
<p>of this conspnacy ; and it had not yet executed its declared pur-
</p>
<p>pose. There is evidence tending to show that certain of the con-
</p>
<p>spirators attempted to execute their purposes, but have not yet
</p>
<p>succeeded; and what further evidence may be. disclosed hereafter,
</p>
<p>touching their pursuit of this same conspiracy after the date of this
</p>
<p>an-est, it is not necessary now for me to speak of I make this re-
</p>
<p>mark at this time to notify the Court, that, in this stage of the
</p>
<p>cause, they cannot assume any such thing as is assumed here,  that
</p>
<p>this conspiracy has been either abandoned on the one hand, or exe-
</p>
<p>cuted on the other ; and therefore this question, as it stands before
</p>
<p>the Court, is simply this : Whether the declaration of this party,
</p>
<p>made at the same time,  for his declaration at any other time can-
</p>
<p>not be admitted,  whetlicr the declaration made at the same time
</p>
<p> a portion of which, it seems, was called out by the Judge Advo-
</p>
<p>cate General  shall be wholly given to the Court. The Judge

<p>that the whole of that declaration may go to the Court without ob-

<p>to the admissibility or non-admissibility of the whole of the declara-

</p>
<p>tion of Arnold made at that conversation, and at that one time and
</p>
<p>place. 
</p>
<p>Mil. Cox. The Court will allow me a .single word. I think the
</p>
<p>learned Judge Advocate will agree with me, that it is only declara-
</p>
<p>tions made by a conspirator in the course of the prosecution of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and accompanying acts which arc jjrosecutcd in jmrsu-
</p>
<p>anco of the (conspiracy, which arc admitted in e\idencc against
</p>
<p>alleged co-conspirators. If a conspiracy be once proved, or sufficient
</p>
<p>prima-facie evidence of that be allowed once to go to the Court,
</p>
<p>on which they might found judgment that the conspiracy was
</p>
<p>proven, then the declarations of any one of these conspirators,
</p>
<p>made accompanying an act done in the prosecution of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, would be receivable as evidence against his co-conspirators;
</p>
<p>but wliether the conspiracy be abandoned or executed, or whether
</p>
<p>a confession be made not in the prosecution of the con.-^jjiraoy, and
</p>
<p>accompanying any act, but independently of that, it is clearly not
</p>
<p>admissible against others of the accused parties.
</p>
<p>Assistant JuncE Advocate BixonAM. That is true, as a con-
</p>
<p>eral thing : but the difficulty about it is, that the conversation may
</p>
<p>disclose something further in connection with the conspiracy, on
</p>
<p>which the others may have acted ; and, in that way, it becomes evi-
</p>
<p>dence. Their very action on it aftenvards is a confirmation of the
</p>
<p>whole thing ; so that, any way you view it, I see no objection to the
</p>
<p>question,
</p>
<p>Mr, Ewing. I asked what he said at that time with the expec-
</p>
<p>tation, of eliciting from the witness a statement made ))y Arnold,
</p>
<p>either a partial or a full statement, as to the connection with the
</p>
<p>alleged conspiracy ; and I claim that that properly comes in if the
</p>
<p>statement was made at that time, because the Judge Advocate, in
</p>
<p>the charges and by the evidence, has sought to associate him with
</p>
<p>the conspiracy ; and one of the links of the association is these arms
</p>
<p>there. Therefore it seemed to mo that any statement he made at
</p>
<p>that time and place with reference to his connection with the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy is legitimate. If the Court will allow mo, I will read a

<p>short paragraph from l{oscoc's Criminal Evidence, page 53 : 
</p>
<p>" Where a confession by one prisoner is given in evidence which
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 4l>y
</p>
<p>implicates the other prisoners by name, a doubt arises as to the pro-
</p>
<p>priety of suflcring those names to he mentioned to the juiy. On
</p>
<p>one circuit, the practice has been to omit their names (Fletcher's
</p>
<p>Case, 4 0. & P., 250) ; but it has been ruled by Littledale, J.,
</p>
<p>in several cases, that the names must be given, \^^lere it was ob-
</p>
<p>jected, on behalf of a prisoner whose name was thus introduced,
</p>
<p>that the witness ought to be directed to omit his name, and merely
</p>
<p>say another person, Littledale, J., said, ' The witness must men-
</p>
<p>tion the name. He is to tell us what the prisoner said ; and,
</p>
<p>if he left out the name, he would not do so. He did not say
</p>
<p>another person; and the witness must give us the conversation
</p>
<p>just as it occurred : but I shall tell the juiy that it is not evidence
</p>
<p>against the other prisoner.' (Hearne's Case, 4 C. & P., 215;
</p>
<p>Clewe's Case, id. 255.) "
</p>
<p>This paragraph evidently contemplates only confessions intro-
</p>
<p>duced by the prosecution ; but if the com-se of the examination
</p>
<p>has been such as to make it the right of a prisoner to introduce a
</p>
<p>confession or statement, made at a particular moment, on his own
</p>
<p>behalf, he has just as much right to introduce the confession, even
</p>
<p>though there be others associated with him in the charge, as the
</p>
<p>prosecution would have the right to introduce his confession if the
</p>
<p>prosecution saw fit to do so.
</p>
<p>The President, after consultation with the members of the Com-
</p>
<p>mission, announced that the objection was overruled.
</p>
<p>The question was repeated to the witness ; and he answered as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>A. About three or four weeks previous to his going to Fortress
</p>
<p>Monroe, three weeks say, he was at a meeting hold at the Lichau
</p>
<p>House in this city.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say it is the same conversation, and the
</p>
<p>same time, tliat he told you about the pistols on his flithor's farm ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. He stated that there was a meeting held there. I
</p>
<p>asked him who attended. He gave me the names of them ; he
</p>
<p>gave the names of J. W. Booth, M. O'Laughlin, G. W. Atzerodt,

</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bcbnett :
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say whether he was present at that meeting,  he
</p>
<p>and these other men ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sij'. I asked him if he ever corresponded with Booth ?
</p>
<p>At first, he said he did not. Then I mentioned the letter that was in
</p>
<p>the " Sunday American " of the IGtli of April, published in Balti-
</p>
<p>more, where it gave a statement of a letter captured in Mr. Booth's
</p>
<p>trunk, or found iu IMr. Booth's trunk. Then I mentioned over to
</p>
<p>him how that letter read, and that it was dated Hookstown, and
</p>
<p>mailed at Hookstown ; and then he said that he wrote that letter.
</p>
<p>We imprisoned him there that day until evening, when we brought
</p>
<p>him into Baltimore.
</p>
<p>By BIe'. Ewino :
</p>
<p>Q. Wliat else did he say ?
</p>
<p>A. I asked him in the conversation if Wilkes Booth was ac-
</p>
<p>quainted in St. Mary's or Charlej County. lie said that be had
</p>
<p>letters of introduction to Dr. Mudd and Dr. Queen. I asked him
</p>
<p>who he got the letters from. He said he did not know. We pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to Baltimore with bini, and tuok him to the oflSce of iMr.
</p>
<p>McPhail, Provost Marshal. There he asked for a pen and ink and
</p>
<p>paper.
</p>
<p>The Assistant Jcdge Advocate Binoeam. You need not state
</p>
<p>any thing about that : that was at another time.

<p>Booth got angry at him at something he said. JL'. Arnold said, if
</p>
<p>THE TltlAL. 431
</p>
<p>the thing was not done that week that he was there, he would with-
</p>
<p>draw ; and Wilkes Booth got angrj at him, and said he ought to bo
</p>
<p>shot for expressing himself in that way ; and he observed that two
</p>
<p>could play at that game. Tliat was about the substance of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not say that Booth threatened to shoot him V
</p>
<p>A. He said he had said enough for him to shoot him, or some-
</p>
<p>thing hke that. I do not remember the words exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not say that he withdrew from the arrangement?
</p>
<p>A. He said he withdrew then, and went and accepted a position
</p>
<p>at Fortress Monroe with John W. Wharton.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state to you the exact date when the meeting at
</p>
<p>Washington was held ?
</p>
<p>A. He may have. I do not remember that he did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state to you whether he had seen Booth since or not ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect that he did state to me when he last saw
</p>
<p>him, or whether he had seen him since that last meetin"-.
</p>
<p>Q. But he stated that he had nothing more to do with the
</p>
<p>conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocte Bingham objected to the question.
</p>
<p>A. He stated, as I said before, that he would withdraw, or would
</p>
<p>not have any connection with the business, if it was not done that
</p>
<p>week.
</p>
<p>Q. And that Booth said he would be justified in shooting him
</p>
<p>for expressing himself in that way ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Anil then he said he would withdraw ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember whetlier he said that or not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did not Arnold after that say to you, that, after Booth said
</p>
<p>that in reply to him, he did withdraw ?
</p>
<p>A. I will state again, he may have said so ; but I do not remem-
</p>
<p>ber it.
</p>
<p>Q. He said to you, then, that, after that time, he bad nothing fur-
</p>
<p>ther to do with the conspiracy 'i
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : be said that.

</p>
<p>Q. Did he say at wbat time he accepted it ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was on the first of April, or last day of Jlareh : I
</p>
<p>am not certain.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not say that this interview was at Grautier's, instead
</p>
<p>of the Lichau House ?
</p>
<p>A. It was a singular name to me ; and I might be mistaken as to
</p>
<p>the name. I thought it was the Lichau House. lie spoke of the
</p>
<p>Lichau House in our conversation ; and I think ho said it was at the
</p>
<p>Licbau House. It happened on Pennsylvania Avenue, between
</p>
<p>Sixth and Pour and a Half Streets, as well as I recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say any thing to you as to what had been the purpose
</p>
<p>of the parties up to the time he withdrew from the arrangement, the
</p>
<p>conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he said the purpose, when he was a member of it,
</p>
<p>was to abduct or kidnap the President, and to take him South for
</p>
<p>the purpose of making this Government have an exchange of pris-
</p>
<p>oners, or something to that amount. I asked him also what he was
</p>
<p>to do in it ; what his part was. I think he said he was to catch him
</p>
<p>when he was thrown out of the box.

<p>letter to Booth, as to Booth's importuning him to continue in the

<p>plot?
</p>
<p>A. There was a good deal of talk between us; and I cannot rec-
</p>
<p>ollect every thing.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you recollect of his telling you that ? Do you not recol-
</p>
<p>lect of his saying that Booth went to his father's house twice, in Bal-
</p>
<p>timore, to fitid him after that, in order to get him to go on with the

</p>
<p>A. I asked Arnold wliore ho got the arras. lie said that Booth
</p>
<p>furnished the arms for all the men.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not say to you, that, when be left the conspiracy, Booth
</p>
<p>finally told him to sell the arms ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He was alluding then to what arms ?
</p>
<p>A. Arnold told mo ho asked Booth what he should do with the
</p>
<p>arms. Booth told him to take them and do any thing with them.
</p>
<p>sell them if he chose.
</p>
<p>Q. What arms was ha speaking of then ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not seen the pistol yet. The pistol and knife were in
</p>
<p>the carpet-sack ; and, when he went down to Fortress Slonroe, he said
</p>
<p>Ire took the pistol down there to sell. The other arms I did not see
</p>
<p>until they were brought to the office.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not understand him as referring to the arms out at
</p>
<p>his father's bouse as well as to this pistol ?
</p>
<p>A. No. Ho said that Booth told him to sell the arms if he ehoso ;
</p>
<p>and he told me that the one we got in his carpet-bag he took to For-
</p>
<p>tress Monroe to sell.
</p>
<p>Q. And that there was a knife and pistol of the same arms at bis
</p>
<p>father's?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You understood that the knife and pistol at his father's be-

</p>
<p>March.
</p>
<p>Q. You say the doctor did not seem to be angry or excited ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : at the time, I did not think so.
</p>
<p>Q. What was said after Mr. Downing's return ?
</p>
<p>A. I had juado a propo.'iition to Mr. Downing. I a.slced him, if
</p>
<p>he had taken the oath of allegiance, would be consider it binding.
</p>
<p>He said he would not consider such an oath as that binding on him-
</p>
<p>self; but be was loyal to the Government as he had taken it, but bo
</p>
<p>did not consider it binding upon hira.
</p>

<p>A. It is impossible for nie to say. I cannot judge of a man

<p>wbctlior he is in earnest or not : fioin the language lie used, I should
</p>
<p>think so,  to talk of the rresideut being ass;issluatcd.

<p>THE TRIAL. 439
</p>
<p>Q. Did you think at the time that he was in earnest?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I diil not think any such thing could ever come to
</p>
<p>pass. I thought the President was well guarded. I thought it was
</p>
<p>a want of sense on his part saying it.
</p>
<p>Q. It made no particular impression on you at the time?
</p>
<p>A. When he remarked that every Union man in the State of
</p>
<p>Mai-yland would be killed, I remarked that I was not the least afraid
</p>
<p>of Jeff, Davis and the whole Confederate army combined together,
</p>
<p>for my part.
</p>
<p>Q. It made no serious impression upon you at the time, did it?
</p>
<p>You never supposed such a thing was coming to pass ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I never did.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not dream of it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, su- : I never dreamed of such a thing coming to pass ;
</p>
<p>and I was really surprised when I first heard it after that.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you repeat what you last said V
</p>
<p>A. After Dr. Mudd said this, I went home, and remarked there
</p>
<p>what Dr. JIudd had said ; and they all laughed at the idea of such
</p>
<p>a thing. The thing was what everybody said would never come to
</p>
<p>pass, and that it was a want of sense on his part in saying such a
</p>
<p>thing.
</p>
<p>Q. You laughed when you heard it ''.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I laughed at it, to think the man had no more sense.
</p>
<p>I did not think any thing of it at the time at all of ever seeing it
</p>
<p>come to pass.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Dr. Mudd, when he said that, look to you as if he really
</p>
<p>thought so himself?
</p>
<p>A. I could not say whether he thought so.
</p>
<p>Q. What impression diil he make upn you ?
</p>
<p>A. At first, when he commenced, when he first said it, I thought
</p>
<p>he meant it.
</p>
<p>Q. When he first said it, you really thought he meant, that, in six
</p>
<p>or seven weeks, the President, and all the Cabinet, and every Union
</p>
<p>man in all Jlaryland, would be killed.

<p>A. When he first said that, I thought he meant it ; but after a
</p>
<p>day or two I thought, if Dr. IMudd said that, he certainly coulil not
</p>
<p>Lave meant it at the time ; but after the President was killed, after
</p>
<p>440 'J' HE Tltl.lL.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln was really assassinated, I thougbt he really meant it,
</p>
<p>after hearing of Booth being at his house.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not tell you how the President and Cabinet and these
</p>
<p>Union men were to be killed V
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : he did not.
</p>
<p>Q. If you had ever supposed that there was any conspiracy to
</p>
<p>kill the President, or to kill any Union man in reality, would you
</p>
<p>"not have given immediate information of it V
</p>
<p>A. Certainly; and I (lid give information of what Dr. MudJ
</p>
<p>said ; but everybody laughed at the idea of such a thing.
</p>
<p>Q. Who dill you give that information to ?
</p>
<p>A. Most everybody I saw. But everybody laughed at the idea
</p>
<p>of such a thing, and at his saying it.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you name any one that you gave the information to ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Who?
</p>
<p>A. I told my brother, Dr. John C. Thomas; I told several
</p>
<p>others about it,  Mr. Watson,  good Union men; and I told
</p>
<p>a good many persons in Woodville.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you mention one in Woodville to whom you told it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I told old Mr. Peter Wood. He said it was not
</p>
<p>the words of a man of sense ; but, after the President was killed, he
</p>
<p>said 
</p>
<p>Q. Did you give any information of this declaration to any one
</p>
<p>in authority V
</p>
<p>A. I wrote to Colonel Holland about it, but never received any
</p>
<p>answer from him.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you write to Colonel Holland?
</p>
<p>A. About a week after he said it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you get no answer from the colonel ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; and I came to the C(iniliision that Colonel Holland
</p>
<p>never received my letter. If ho had, he would have answered it.
</p>

<p>A. No, sir : never.
</p>
<p>Q. You arc positive on that question ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And that the conversation that you have detailed is all that
</p>
<p>occurred substantially?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Who left the house first,  you or Dr. Sludd?
</p>
<p>A. I believe wc both left principally at the same time.
</p>
<p>Q. You both went away together ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I went home ; and ho went to his house, I guess.
</p>
<p>Q. Why did you come to the conclusion that Colonel Holland
</p>
<p>never received your letter?
</p>
<p>A. I had written to him several times, and never received any
</p>
<p>answer ; and I concluilcd they nmst have miscamcd in some way.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever written to him before ?

</p>
<p>Q. Do you know what be went out for ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : as soon as he came in, we started.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not have any further conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, not at all : only I asked him there if ho was a man
</p>
<p>that had taken the oath. I said, " You are a man who took the
</p>
<p>oath : do you not con.sider it binding? " He said no; he did not
</p>
<p>consider it binding : if a man was compelled to take an oath, it was
</p>
<p>not binding. I told hiui no man was going to kill him : tliere was

<p>no compulsion to make him take the oath. He said he thought it

<p>was compulsion.

</p>
<p>ended, and the Rebellion would bo " squashed."
</p>
<p>Q. What else had been said bofciro that"?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing else. That was all the particulars.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you not been talking about other things?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When Mr. Downing came in, did not Dr. Mudd say any thing
</p>
<p>about what had been said while he was out ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : ho did not say a word. I just got up. and asked
</p>
<p>Mr. Downing one or two questions,  if he had taken the oath ; and
</p>
<p>he said he had talcen the oath, and he said lie was no more loyal
</p>
<p>than before,  he always was a loyal man ; that his feeling was for
</p>
<p>State rights ; but still he did not consider that oath as binding upon
</p>
<p>any person.
</p>
<p>Q. IIow came you to ask Mr. Downing whether ho had taken the
</p>
<p>oath ?
</p>
<p>A. Becanise I told Dr. Mudd, a man like him, that had taken the
</p>
<p>oath 
</p>
<p>Q. Was that Dr. Mudd or Mr. Downing?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Downing, as I have stated ; but then I had said to Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd, before that, that he had taken the oatli. and lie ought not to
</p>
<p>have said such things about the President, and so on, in .such a
</p>
<p>way. Ho said he did not consider the oath worth a chow of tobacco.
</p>
<p>Q. How came you to ask Jlr. Downing whether he had taken
</p>
<p>the oath?
</p>
<p>A. Prom some expressions of Dr. Bludd. I wanted to seo
</p>
<p>whether Downing considered it binding. I considered it binding
</p>
<p>upon any person as much so as any oath ; but he said it was not.
</p>
<p>As ho used to bo a justice of the peace, I wanted to hear what ho
</p>
<p>thought about it; and he said he did not consider it binding.

<p>of the house handed us a carpet-bag, in which we found a piece of
</p>
<p>rope, which I measured afterwards, and found to contain eighty-
</p>
<p>one feet ; and the twist was very carefully taken out. There wa.-^
</p>
<p>nothing else in the carpetrbag, except some blank paper and a dirty
</p>
<p>shirtHjollar. When we inquii-cd for his trunk, wo were told he
</p>
<p>kept it at the theatre.

</p>
<p>the ITtli of April since, between nine and ten o'clock, in company
</p>
<p>with two military detectives.

</p>
<p>he stopped, was with his brother-in-luw in Exgter Street, No. 57.
</p>
<p>456 TUB TlilAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ask liim why he was there, instead of at his boarding-
</p>
<p>liouse ?
</p>
<p>A. I (lid. Ho said, that, when he arrived in town on Saturday,
</p>
<p>ho was told that the officers had been looking for him ; and that
</p>
<p>he went away to a friend of his, and stopped on Saturday and
</p>
<p>Sunday night.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ask you for what ho was arrested ?
</p>
<p>A. He seemed to understand what it was for.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ask you no question in regard to it ?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing that occurs to my mind at present.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cox :
</p>
<p>Q. Did the brother-in-law of the prisoner send for you, or go for
</p>
<p>you to arrest him ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingdam objected to the question.
</p>
<p>IMr. Cox. Tlie object is to show that the prisoner Toluntarily
</p>
<p>surrendered huiiself by sending for the officer.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. The brother-in-law is
</p>
<p>not the prisoner; and I object. The proposition is to show a
</p>
<p>declaration of the prisoner on his own motion, and at another time
</p>
<p>and place.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. The evidence offered on the part of the prosecution
</p>
<p>was designed to show that OLaughlin was avoiding the arrest.
</p>
<p>In cross-examination, I desire to show that the arrest was made at
</p>
<p>the instance of the brother-in-law ; and I propose to follow that
</p>
<p>hereafter by proof that the prisoner himself sent his brother-in-law
</p>
<p>to communicate his whereabouts to the officer. I think that is
</p>
<p>legitimate ou cross-examination.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bixouam. It is not cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion : it is new matter altogether. AVe have not otlered any evidence
</p>
<p>of what the prisoner said to his brother-in-law : this witness's testi-
</p>
<p>nionj' was as to what the prisoner said to him. It is in proof already
</p>
<p>by one of his associates, that he said ho was not going to be taken
</p>
<p>at home, but was going to change his boarding-place. Now, it is
</p>
<p>j)roi)oscd to prove declarations of the jirisoncr im his own motion,

<p>at iuiothcr time and pkice, through his brutlicr-in-law.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 457
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. Not exactly that. The object of the prosecution,
</p>
<p>I .suppose, in the examination of this witnc.s.s, was to show that
</p>
<p>O'Laughliu was avoiding arrest, by showing that he was found at
</p>
<p>another place than his lodgings. One witness for the Government
</p>
<p>has ah-eady testified tliat the prisoner gave as a reason for leaving
</p>
<p>his lodgings, that, if he was arrested there, it would bo the death
</p>
<p>of his mother; and, this witness having testified that he was found
</p>
<p>elsewhere, I desire to ask him, on cross-esamination, whether ho
</p>
<p>went there to find Mm at the instance of the prisoner's brother-in-
</p>
<p>law.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. It is the declaration of
</p>
<p>a third person. That is what I object to now.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. It is not the declaration of a fact that I offer, but
</p>
<p>of an act done by the brother-in-law, on which the officer acted.
</p>
<p>The Commission overruled the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. [By 3IR. Cox.] Now state if Mr. Maulsby came after you
</p>
<p>to make the arrest.
</p>
<p>A. jMr. Maulsby I am well acquainted with. Ho was recom-
</p>
<p>mended to me on Sunday evening, as being a good Union man,
</p>
<p>and that I could put implicit confidence in him. lie knew I was
</p>
<p>looking for m. O'LaughHn. I then told him that I wished him
</p>
<p>to assist me in getthig him. He said any thing he could do to
</p>
<p>assist me he would ; and, if he got any infonnation as to his where-
</p>
<p>abouts, he would inform me. That was Sunday evening. On
</p>
<p>Slonday morning he came to me, and told me, that, if I wmild go
</p>
<p>with him, he thought ho could find O'Laughliu. I went with him
</p>
<p>in company to the house in which I got him.
</p>
<p>Q. You were asked whether the prisoner made any remark
</p>
<p>about the assassination. Did he say any thing about having received
</p>
<p>information that the detectives had been at his house V
</p>
<p>A. I think he said, when he got to his brother-in-law's house on
</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon, he heard they had been there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he protest his innocence of the crime V
</p>
<p>A. Ilesaid he knew nothing of the alfair whatever.

</p>
<p>have participated in it, because he was in company with other per-
</p>

</p>
<p>stay in Washington by parties who were there with him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say why ho loft home after being advised that the
</p>
<p>detectives had been there after him ?

<p>A. I do not remember that ho said so.
</p>
<p>James J. Giffoed,

</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Jodoe Advocate :

</p>
<p>A. I was the builder of it.

</p>
<p>day?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not look at it that day. I was not in it.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know who decorated that box on that occasion V
</p>
<p>A. I saw Mr. Harry Clay Ford in the box, putting flags out.
</p>
<p>Q. Who else?
</p>
<p>A. At one time I saw SIi". Raybolt, I think, with him : I am
</p>
<p>not certain.
</p>
<p>Q. Anybody else?

</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Spanglcr in the box at any time
</p>
<p>during that day ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sii- : I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you observe a large rocking-chair which was in the
</p>
<p>President's box in the theatre on the 14th of April ?
</p>
<p>A. I observed it afterwai-ds : I did not take notice of it on the
</p>
<p>14th.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you see it ?
</p>
<p>A, I saw it on Satm-day, the 15tb.
</p>
<p>Q. Where?
</p>
<p>A. In the box.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know when it was placed in the box ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Nor by whom?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether it had ever been there before ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think it had this season. I saw it there last
</p>
<p>season.
</p>
<p>Q. To whom did it belong ? and where had it come from ?
</p>
<p>A. It belonged to Mr. John T. Ford. It was part of a set of
</p>
<p>furniture,  two sofas and two higli-backed chairs, one with rockers

<p>and one with castors. I have sometimes seen the one with castors
</p>
<p>in the box this season ; but I never saw the rocking-chair in it.

</p>
<p>460 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : except on Sunday and Monday, when I came away
</p>
<p>fi'om there ?
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know who took it away ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know wlicther the scenes of the theatre remain as
</p>
<p>they were the moment of the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. I set a scene for a gentleman there to take a view for the
</p>
<p>Secretary of War. At tlie time I left the theatre, the scene was
</p>
<p>then set as it was the night of the assassination. The liack flats in
</p>
<p>the three back grooves had been pushed off. I do not know whether
</p>
<p>they were pushed back since. They had been pushed off so as to
</p>
<p>give a view for the occupants of the side box. I pushed them off
</p>
<p>the bos to assist in making the pictures.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you examined the condition of the locks on the doors
</p>
<p>of that box?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine the wall where there is a mortise made ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you examine that first?
</p>
<p>A. I think I first saw it on the Monday morning after the
</p>
<p>assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. You had not seen it before ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I was trying to find out where the door had been
</p>
<p>closed, when I first saw it. The Secretary of War came down to
</p>
<p>the theatre, and examined the box ; and he told me to bring a stick,
</p>
<p>and fit it in the door. I found that a stick about three feet six
</p>
<p>inches long, if pressed against it, would keep the door from openin"
</p>
<p>on the outside ; but, if they had shook it, the strip would have
</p>
<p>dropped.
</p>
<p>Q. When had you been in that box last before the 14th of
</p>
<p>April?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot tell positively what time I was in there. I judge
</p>
<p>I was in there a week before.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think, if the mortise had been there then, you would

</p>
<p>have observed it?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I should thiuk so. I am generally particular in
</p>
<p>TBE TRIAL. 461
</p>
<p>looking around to see that the place ia clean, and see that tlio chairs
</p>
<p>are in their places, and the same number of chairs there.
</p>
<p>Q. Had it the appearance of being very recently made?
</p>
<p>A. It looked so to me.
</p>
<p>Q. With^what instrument do you think it was probably made?
</p>
<p>A. I should think it was made with a knife, fi-om the looks of it.
</p>
<p>It looks as if it had been scraped down.
</p>
<p>Q. It would require a good dead of time to make it with a knife,
</p>
<p>would it not ? It is quite a large mortise "?
</p>
<p>A. It would require a man some ten or fifteen minutes, I should
</p>
<p>judge. After the plaster on the outside was broken, it would be
</p>
<p>easy to get the inside off. The facing of the plastering, when it is
</p>
<p>faced over with the trowel, is hard, pressed.
</p>
<p>Q. If the three doors that open into that place were all closed, it
</p>
<p>would be entirely dark there, would it not?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not think, therefore, that one or more of those doors
</p>
<p>must have been open when this mortise was being made ?
</p>
<p>A. It miglit have been so. It would have required some sort of
</p>
<p>light, I should think, if they had the strip.
</p>
<p>Q. Would not such an operation made with an open door be
</p>
<p>likely to attract the attention of persons connected with the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. If they used a knife, it would not : if they used a chisel or
</p>
<p>hammer, it would make a sound.
</p>
<p>Q. What were the duties of the prisoner Spangler in connection
</p>
<p>with tliat theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. He worked on the stage, making scenery, fixing up the
</p>
<p>scenes, and working them at night.
</p>
<p>Q. Did the decoration of this box come within the range of his
</p>
<p>jiuties ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : there is a gentleman there by the name of Raybolt,
</p>
<p>who is an upholsterer. It was his duty to have decorated the box ;
</p>
<p>but ho had a stiff neck, he .said.
</p>
<p>Q. That he had, on that evening, a stiff neck?

<p>A. Yes, sir ; and he got Mr. Clay Ford to do it for him,  so
</p>
<p>he told me afterwards. I asked him if I did not see him in the box;
</p>
<p>and he said, " Yes; but I did not decorate it."

<p>462 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Where were you at the moment of the assassination of the
</p>
<p>President ?
</p>
<p>A. I was standing about ten feet firom tho centre, where the big
</p>
<p>lamp is, just at the edge of the platform.
</p>
<p>Q. On the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Where?
</p>
<p>A. In front of the house.
</p>
<p>Q. Outside?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I had come out of the front of the house. I had
</p>
<p>been in the front of the house, I suppose, maybe three or four
</p>
<p>minutes.
</p>
<p>Q. You mean the front part of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you been behind the scenes?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long before ?
</p>
<p>A. I had been behind there, I suppose, maybe about twenty
</p>
<p>minutes before.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Spangler while you were there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was he doing ?
</p>
<p>A. He was on the left-hand side. I came out aa tho curtain
</p>
<p>went up. He was waiting for his business to change tho
</p>
<p>scene.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it, or is it not, a usual thing for the passage-way which leads
</p>
<p>to the back door, while a piece is being played, to be entirely free
</p>
<p>for persons to pass ?
</p>
<p>A. The passage on each side, outside of tho entrances, is always
</p>
<p>kept free,  it is a small stage,  so that the actors can pass from the-
</p>
<p>dressing-room down underneath the stage, and come up on the other
</p>
<p>side. The entrances are always more or less filled with tables, chairs,
</p>
<p>and set-pieces. It depends jJtogether on the business tliey are doing,
</p>
<p> whether it is a heavy piece or a light piece. Sometimes they have

</p>
<p>pieces with a great many ,-^ets in ; and then the entrances arc gener-
</p>
<p>ally jammed, but around the scenes is always kept open. At times,
</p>
<p>when there is a lai-ge number of people on, they are crowded with
</p>
<p>THE TIIIAL. 463
</p>
<p>people, but not with set-stuff or chairs or tables, or any thing of that,
</p>
<p>kind.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen the bar wliich was found there?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : the night after the assassination, the police went up
</p>
<p>there ; but I did not go up until Saturday morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say that you do not know who made the mortise for
</p>
<p>the bar that you spoke of?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I do not.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to thowitness a plan of the theatre.] Will you
</p>
<p>examine that plat carefully, and state whether it is or is not an ap-
</p>
<p>proximately correct plat of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. The lines in the orchestra are not con-oct. They are all
</p>
<p>curved lines : these are straight lines.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting another plan of the theatre to the witness.] Ex-
</p>
<p>amine this map, and state if you think it to be correct.
</p>
<p>A. The fi-ont hne of this plan is not correct. The side line on
</p>
<p>the south side is not correct.
</p>
<p>Q. State iu what it is incorrect.
</p>
<p>A. This hne on the stage curves out. It is just the reverse of
</p>
<p>what the gentleman who drew this has intended for it. Then, on the
</p>
<p>south side, there is a projection of about three feet. The stage is that
</p>
<p>much narrower on that side than it is on the other, and that much
</p>
<p>narrower than the fi-ont of the house.
</p>
<p>Q. State what other defects, if any, you see in that map.
</p>
<p>A. The fronts of the private boxes are straight : in this they have
</p>
<p>got a .sweep. On the centre of the cast wall there is a very large
</p>
<p>opening, some fourteen feet, which is not marked here at all. Those
</p>
<p>are all the defects I see in it at present. I do not know what is the
</p>
<p>meaning of these lines on one side unless they are intended for packs
</p>
<p>of scenes. The scenes are as they were when I left it. There are
</p>
<p>three packs here.
</p>
<p>Q. They appear to represent the scenes as they were when you
</p>
<p>last saw them ?

<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>4G4 THE rniAL..
</p>
<p>, Q. State whether, in other respects, the map is substantially cor-
</p>
<p>rect in your opinion.
</p>
<p>A. It shows the grooves ami thi; entrances all correctly. The
</p>
<p>only difference in that respect is, that tiiey have made the first en-
</p>
<p>trance a little smaller, in proportion to the others, in laying them
</p>
<p>down. I do not know the scale of this drawing, and therefore can-
</p>
<p>not tell.
</p>
<p>[The map was offered in evidence without objection!]
</p>
<p>Q. How wide is the first entrance?
</p>
<p>A. About four feet six inches.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that the entrance by which Bootlk passed off from the stage
</p>
<p>behind the scenes ?
</p>
<p>A. That is the way they told mo he passed : that is the entrance
</p>
<p>he must have gone through.
</p>
<p>Q. How wide is the passage-way that he passed through going to
</p>
<p>the outer door 1
</p>
<p>A. I judge it is about from two feet eight inches to three feet ;
</p>
<p>in some places a little wider, and in some a little narrower. It is
</p>
<p>not a reimlar straight entrance.
</p>
<p>Q. Now tell the Court as to whether that passage-way is ob-
</p>
<p>structed during the plays ordinarily.
</p>
<p>A. Never, except by people when they have a large company
</p>
<p>on the small stage. There are never any chairs or tables or scenery
</p>
<p>put in the way there, so that they can have free access to go under
</p>
<p>the stage, and come up on the other side.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it not also necessary to keep the passage-way clear in
</p>
<p>order to allow the actors and actresses to pass without obstruction
</p>
<p>from the green-room and the dressing-rooms on to the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is what it is intended for.
</p>
<p>Q. How is the small liack door usually kept?
</p>
<p>A. It is always left open until the performance is over ; and then
</p>
<p>it is locked until morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean that the door is swung open, or left unlocked
</p>
<p>merely ?

<p>A. It is left unlocked. Tlic only door that is locked is the door
</p>
<p>leading from the stage to the front of the house on the side under-
</p>
<p>neath the box where the President was assassinated.
</p>
<p>TBE TRIAL. 465
</p>
<p>Q. State what position upon the stage Mr. Spangler had during
</p>
<p>a performance.
</p>
<p>A. His business was on the left hand of the stajre,  the right
</p>
<p>hand from the audience,  to run the flats, as we call them, on that
</p>
<p>side.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that the side the President's box was on ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State at what times during the performance you were on the
</p>
<p>stage that night.
</p>
<p>A. I was on the stage until the curtain went up at each act.
</p>
<p>Wlien the curtain was down, I would go around on to the sta"-e to
</p>
<p>see that every thing was right, and then go out again.
</p>
<p>Q. State at what times during that evening, when you came oa
</p>
<p>the stage between the acts, you saw Jlr. Spann-ler.
</p>
<p>A. I could not state the time. I should judge, the last time I
</p>
<p>saw him was at about half-past nine o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you saw him each time you came on the sta^e.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I saw him each time.
</p>
<p>Q. He was your subordinate, I believe ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State where you were during that play, when you were not on
</p>
<p>the stage.
</p>
<p>A. I was in the front of the house. I walked down to D and
</p>
<p>Tenth Streets, to look at a big lamp I had put up there, while the
</p>
<p>first act was going on. I walked up to the next corner. Tenth and
</p>
<p>F Streets, and took a glass of ale, and stood and talked a moment
</p>
<p>or two, during the second act. During the third act, I did not leave
</p>
<p>the house at all.
</p>
<p>Q. You were then in front of the theatre a part of the time be-
</p>
<p>tween the second and third acts ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How much of the time ?
</p>
<p>A. I was on the stage between the acts.

</p>
<p>A. During the performance of the second act, I was in front, I
</p>
<p>think, to the best of my knowledge.
</p>
<p>466 TDE TlilAL.
</p>
<p>Q. All the time?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : not ;ill tlio time.
</p>
<p>Q. How much of the time ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I would walk in, and maybe stay fire or
</p>
<p>ten minutes, and then walk out again.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you saw the prisoner Spanglcr at any
</p>
<p>time during that play in front of the theatre.
</p>
<p>A. I did not see him in front of the theatre. I do not think he
</p>
<p>could have been there in front of the theatre without my knowing it,
</p>
<p>because the scenes would have gone wrong if be had left the stage
</p>
<p>any length of time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see Spangler wear a mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : he has never worn one since I have known him.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know how he was dressed that evening?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not. I did not take particular notice.
</p>
<p>Q. How was he ordinarily dressed during that period ?
</p>
<p>A. Just about the same as he is now, as far as I have seen.
</p>
<p>Lately, during the last four or five weeks, he has been wearing the
</p>
<p>clothes he has on now.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not the play of the " American Cousin " a play in which
</p>
<p>the scenes were shifted a good deal ?
</p>
<p>A. They were what we call " plain-sailing," running-on scenes.
</p>
<p>There is but one set-scene in the piece.
</p>
<p>Q. There was not much shifting, then ?
</p>
<p>A. In one act, the most of the scenes arc changed : but that is in
</p>
<p>the first groove ; and therefore it only takes two men to change them
</p>
<p>until we get to two, and then it takes four men.
</p>
<p>Q. Were the scenes shifted much in the play ?
</p>
<p>. A. I believe there arc some fire or six scenes in each act. I do
</p>
<p>not know  I cannot call to mind now  how many scenes are in
</p>
<p>each act.
</p>
<p>Q. Then Spangler's presence there would have been indispensa-
</p>
<p>ble to the performance ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. If he had not been there, his scene would not have

<p>THE TRIAL. 467
</p>
<p>A. Kitterspaugb  I think that is the name  was with him at
</p>
<p>that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear Booth call Spangler that night ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was Spangler's connection with Booth? what had he
</p>
<p>to do with him ?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing that I know of, further than friendly. Everybody
</p>
<p>about the house was friendly with him.
</p>
<p>Q. With Booth?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; actors and all : they wore all friendly with him.
</p>
<p>Ho had such a very winning way, that it made every person like him.
</p>
<p>Ho was a good-natured and jovial kind of man. The people about
</p>
<p>the house, as far as I knew, all liked him.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he not very much in the habit of frequenting the
</p>
<p>theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Sometimes I have seen him there for a week ; and then he
</p>
<p>would go off, and I would not see him for a couple of wcoks. Then
</p>
<p>ho would come again for a week, perhaps ; and after that I would
</p>
<p>not see him for a couple of weeks or ten days, or something of that
</p>
<p>sort.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not have access to the theatre as one of the emphyis
</p>
<p>would have?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And had access by the back entrance ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. At any time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; at any time, except when the door was locked.
</p>
<p>Q. At any time when an cmploijc of the theatre might go in ?
</p>
<p>A. When the house was open, ho had free access all through the
</p>
<p>houtio.
</p>
<p>Q. Day and night ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; except when the house was locked up, and the
</p>
<p>watchman was there : he had no access to it then.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not Spangler a sort of a dnidgo for Booth ?

<p>A. He appeared so. He used to go down, and help him to hitch
</p>
<p>his horse up, and such things, I am told : I have seen him once or
</p>
<p>twice hitching the horse up myself.

<p>468 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that hole in tlio wall cut into the brick?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I believe not. To the best of my knowledge, it was
</p>
<p>not : it was only cut into the plaster, I should judge, about an inch
</p>
<p>or an inch and an eighth.
</p>
<p>Q. You say it miglit have been done with a penknife ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think it might have been done with a penknife.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness the wooden bar heretofore offered
</p>
<p>in evidoncu, marked Exhibit No. 44.] Will you examine that stick,
</p>
<p>and state whether you saw any sticks like that about the theatre
</p>
<p>about that time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, I did not. This is the first time I have seen any thing
</p>
<p>of this kind.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether those nails in the end would probalily have
</p>
<p>been put in there for any purpose connected with the fastening of
</p>
<p>the door ?
</p>
<p>A. They might have been put in there to keep it from slipping
</p>
<p>down,  one end against the wall, and the other with the bevelled
</p>
<p>edge against the moulding of the door.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether the nails in that end [a detached piece which
</p>
<p>had been sawed off the wooden bar] would probably have been put
</p>
<p>in for any purpose connected with that object.
</p>
<p>A. I do not know what they could have been done for.
</p>
<p>Q. You think they could not, in any way, have facilitated that
</p>
<p>object ?
</p>
<p>A. They might have. If this strip was too short, this block
</p>
<p>would fit in behind there, so as to make an abutment for it.
</p>
<p>Q. But that was a part of the stick : it was on the stick, and
</p>
<p>was sawed off by a curiosity-hunter. Would these nails have been
</p>
<p>put in there for any purpose connected with the fastening of the
</p>
<p>door?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir: I see no use for them there. This bevelled edge
</p>
<p>would keep it from slipping do\vn the door ; and, the other end being
</p>
<p>in the mortise, it would not require any thing to keep it from slipping
</p>
<p>down.

<p>on tbe door of the President's box came to be loose ?

<p>Q. Will you look at the prisoners at tbe bar, and see if you recog-
</p>
<p>nize either of them as having seen them before ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not see any there that I know. If I have
</p>
<p>seen any, I have seen that man [pointing to Lewis Payne, one
</p>
<p>of the accused]. I think I have seen him ; but I cannot say whether
</p>
<p>I did or not. If I did, he does not present the appearance that I
</p>
<p>have seen.
</p>
<p>Q. I do not speak of his dress ; but look at bis features, and see
</p>
<p>whether you recognize him as tbe same person.
</p>
<p>A. I think I have seen that man : I think his features are famil-
</p>
<p>iar to me ; but I could not say for certain.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the person of whom you speak a boarder in your bouse ?
</p>
<p>A. Tbe one that is alluded to, perhaps, was a boarder in my

<p>Ho was two weeks in our house.

<p>Q. You keep the Herndon House, do you ?

<p>occurred.

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>Q. At what hour did he leave ?

<p>A. About four o'clock. We have dinner at half-past four ; and

<p>this gentleman came into the sitting-room, and said ho was gnino-
</p>
<p>away, and wanted to settle liis bill ; and ho wished to have dinnoi-
</p>
<p>before the regular dinner. So I gave orders for the dinner to be cut

</p>
<p>o'clock. I do not know the time exactly ; but I know it was in the
</p>
<p>forenoon.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he come alone, or with others ?

<p>without paying any further attention to him, leaving them at the
</p>
<p>table with several others.
</p>
<p>Q. Had anybody else spoken to you for a room for this man
</p>
<p>before he camo V
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; never to my knowledge. So many have spoken to
</p>
<p>me on different occasions for rooms, that I could not recollect any par-
</p>
<p>ticular one. Some one may have done so ; but so many have applied,
</p>
<p>that I could not recollect any particular one.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember whether John H. Surratt and Miss Ward,
</p>
<p>or either of them, called at your house, and spoke for a room for this
</p>
<p>man?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw or heard of this man until this circumstance.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Sir. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court where the Herndon House is sit-
</p>
<p>uated ?
</p>
<p>A. On the corner of Ninth and F Streets, opposite the Patent
</p>
<p>Office, cat-a-cornered.
</p>
<p>William H. Bell (colored),
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, on the 14th of April last, you
</p>
<p>were living in the house of Mr. Seward, Secretary of State ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I was.
</p>
<p>Q. In what capacity were you ?  at the door ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you look at these persons at the bar, and see whether
</p>
<p>you recognize either of them ?
</p>
<p>A. There is the man that I recognize [pointing to Lewis
</p>
<p>Payne, one of the accused].
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not come to the house of Mr. Seward on the night of

<p>trance into the house ?
</p>
<p>472 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. It was my night on that night ; and the Isell rang, and I went
</p>
<p>to the door ; an<l this man [Payne] came in. Ho had a little pack-
</p>
<p>age ill his hand ; and he said it was medicine for Mr. Seward, from
</p>
<p>Dr. Verdi, and that he was sent there by Dr. Verdi to direct him
</p>
<p>how to take it ; and he said ho must go up. I told him he could not
</p>
<p>go up. Then he repeated the words over, and was a good while
</p>
<p>talking to me there in the hall about he must go up, he must see
</p>
<p>him, he must see him. I told him he could not see him ; that it
</p>
<p>was against my orders to let any one go up ; that if he would give
</p>
<p>me the medicine, and tell me the diroction.s, I would take it up, and
</p>
<p>tell Mr. Seward how to take it. That would not do ; and he walked
</p>
<p>up the hall towards the steps. I had spoken pretty rough to him,
</p>
<p>and then I asked him to excuse me when I found out that he would
</p>
<p>go up. He said, " Oh, I know that, I know that : that is all right,
</p>
<p>sir! " When I found out that he would go up, I got up on the
</p>
<p>steps, and went up in front of him. The reason I asked him to ex-
</p>
<p>cuse me was, that I thought ])erliaps he might be sent by Dr. Ver-
</p>
<p>di ; and he might go up, and tell Mr. Seward that I would not let
</p>
<p>him go up, or something of that kind. When he went up, he walked
</p>
<p>pretty heavy. I asked him not to walk so heavy. Ho met Mr.
</p>
<p>Frederick Seward on the steps this side of his father's room, and had
</p>
<p>some conversation with him up there in the hall.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear their conversation ? If you did, state it.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. He told Jlr. Frederick that he wanted to sec Mr.
</p>
<p>Seward. Mr. Frederick went into the room, and came out and told
</p>
<p>him that he could not .see him ; that his father was asleep at that
</p>
<p>time ; and to give him the medicine, and he would take it in to him.
</p>
<p>That would not do : he must see Sir. Seward, he must see him ! 
</p>
<p>he said it just in that way. Mr. Frederick said, " You cannot see
</p>
<p>him." He kept on talking to Jlr. Frederick, saying that he must
</p>
<p>see him; and then Mr. Frederick said, " I am the proprietor hero, and
</p>
<p>his son : if you cannot leave your message with me, you cannot
</p>
<p>leave it at all." Then he had a little more talk there for a while,
</p>
<p>and stood with the little package in his hand. It was just about

</p>
<p>the size of that little liox there [pointing to a small box on the
</p>
<p>table]. INIr. Frederick would not Ictliiui sec Sir. Seward no way
</p>
<p>at all ; and then he started towards the step, and said, " Well, if I
</p>
<p>TBE TniAL. 473
</p>
<p>cannot see him "  And then he mumbled some words that I did
</p>
<p>not understand, and started to come down. I started in front of
</p>
<p>him. I got down about three stops, I guess, when I turned around
</p>
<p>to him, and said, " Don't walk so heavy." Then, by the time I
</p>
<p>turned around to make anothcf step, he had jumped back, and struck
</p>
<p>Jlr. Frederick. By the time I could look back, Mr. Frederick was
</p>
<p>foiling : he threw up his hands, and fell back in his sister's room ;
</p>
<p>that is two doors this side of Mr. Seward's room. Then I ran down
</p>
<p>stairs, and out to the front door, hallooing " Murder !" and then ran
</p>
<p>down to General Augur's headijuarters. I did not see the guard,
</p>
<p>and ran back again. By that time, there were three soldiers who
</p>
<p>had run out of the building, and were following me. When I o-ot
</p>
<p>half-way back to the house, turning the corner there, I saw this man
</p>
<p>run out, and get on his horse. He had on a light overcoat and
</p>
<p>brown hat ; but he had not his hat on when he came out and got on
</p>
<p>bis horse. I did not see his horse when he came to the house, and
</p>
<p>did not know he had a horse until I saw him get on it. I hallooed
</p>
<p>to the soldiers, " There he is, going on a horse ! " They slacked
</p>
<p>their running, and ran out into the street, and did not run any more
</p>
<p>until he got on his horse and started off. I followed him up as far
</p>
<p>as I Street and Fifteen and a Half Street ; and he turned right out
</p>
<p>into Vermont Avenue.
</p>
<p>Q. You lost sight of him there, did you ?
</p>
<p>A. I lost sight of him there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see with what he struck Mr: Fi-edcrick Seward ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not exactly see it; but, whatever it was, it appeared to
</p>
<p>me to be round, and to be mounted all over with silver. It was that
</p>
<p>long [about ten or twelve inches]. I bad taken it to be a knifo
</p>
<p>afterwards ; but they all said he struck him with a pistol : but that I
</p>
<p>cannot tell.
</p>
<p>Q. How many times did he strike him ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw him raise his hand twice. I did not wait to see how
</p>
<p>many times after he hit him. He hit him twice before I could turn
</p>
<p>around, and while I was looking at him ; and then I ran down stairs.

</p>
<p>474 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. When he jumped back again, he just said, "You"  and
</p>
<p>commenced hitting him over the head. That is all I understood him
</p>
<p>to say. I came down stairs when I saw him hit hiui ; but 1 hardly
</p>
<p>missed him from behind me until I heard him sa}' that word.
</p>
<p>Q. Dr. Verdi was Mr. Seward's fatally physician, was he ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he said ho had a package of medicine from him,
</p>
<p>and was sent there to give JL-. Seward that medicine, an<l direct him
</p>
<p>bow to take it ; and he must see him. He talked very rough to me
</p>
<p>in the first place when he came in.
</p>
<p>Q. Did ho abuse you for not letting him in 1
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : he did not say much out of the way ; only he said he
</p>
<p>must see Mr. Seward ; and walking very slowly all the time, listening
</p>
<p>to what I had to say. I told him I would not let him up ; but, if
</p>
<p>he had any package of medicine for Mr. Seward, I would take it up,
</p>
<p>and tell him how to take it. But that would not do : he must see
</p>
<p>him. He had his right hand in his coat-pocket, and his medicine in
</p>
<p>his left hand.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever seen this man about the door before ?

</p>
<p>A. I did not see his horse at all then.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him 'when mounting on that horse ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw him run out of the door, and get on his horse.
</p>
<p>Q. How far did he ride from you when nearest to you ?
</p>
<p>A. I must have been behind him, as far as from here to that
</p>
<p>door [about twenty feet], until he got to I Street.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you by the Ught see the color and appearance of the
</p>
<p>horse ?
</p>
<p>A. His horse was a bay horse. I saw that when he started off
</p>
<p>from the tree-box ; and I was behind all the way to I Street.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a stout or small animal ?

<p>THE TRIAL. 477
</p>
<p>A. They sent a man up to my room where I was ; and he asked
</p>
<p>me to get up. I asked him what he wanted.
</p>
<p>Q. What time of day was that ?
</p>
<p>A. It was in the night, between two and three o'clock : I did
</p>
<p>not notice the time particularly. I asked him what he wanted. He
</p>
<p>said Mr. Webster wanted me. I had been getting up every night
</p>
<p>at all hours since the thing happened ; and I told him to ask Mr.
</p>
<p>Webster to come up to my room ; that I was tired of getting up of
</p>
<p>nights. I had been out two or three times. AMien I got up and
</p>
<p>came down, and saw Mr. Webster, he told me he wanted me to go
</p>
<p>down to General Augur's headquarters. I went down there. They
</p>
<p>asked me if the light was very bright in the hall at the time this man
</p>
<p>came in. I said it was not very bright, because the light in our
</p>
<p>hall does not go up very high,  it is only a little light ; but it was
</p>
<p>bright enough to read liy : you could see good all over ; but it was
</p>
<p>Tiot like the light they had in the room down there. A gentleman
</p>
<p>asked me what kind of hair he bad, and what kind of a looking man
</p>
<p>he was. I told him as near as I could.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was that gentleman ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know him ; but I saw him here a httle while ago, 
</p>
<p>a colonel, with large whiskers and a mustache.
</p>
<p>Q. He asked you to describe him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you say ?
</p>
<p>A. I told him ho had black hair, a thin lip, very fine voice, very
</p>
<p>tall, and broad across the shoulders, I took him to be. I told him
</p>
<p>as near as I could all about him. There were twenty or thu-ty gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen in the room at the time ; and he asked me if there was any one
</p>
<p>there had hair like him. I told him, " No, sir : not one had hair
</p>
<p>like him." Then he asked me if there was any one there looked
</p>
<p>like him ; and I told him there was not.
</p>
<p>Q. That was at General Augur's ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : after he got through with mo, he said, " I will bring
</p>
<p>a man in here, and show him to you." There were two rooms be-

</p>
<p>behind the desk, .so that he should not see me if ho came in. Tlien
</p>
<p>they opened the middle door ; and a good many came walking in that

<p>478 THE TlilAL.
</p>
<p>door together. I walked right up to this man, raised my hands and
</p>
<p>put my finger right here [on the lip], and told him I knew him :
</p>
<p>that was the man.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you been shown any other man before that ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Who else ?  do you know ?
</p>
<p>A. I (lid not know tlie men.
</p>
<p>Q. How many were shown you before ?
</p>
<p>A. Two.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they look any way like this man 1
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How did they look ?
</p>
<p>A. One had a mustache, and one had whiskers under the chin.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they as tall as this man [Payne] is ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Neither of them ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You were not shown anybody looking at all like this man ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any thing else happened then at General Augur's V
</p>
<p>A. That is all.
</p>
<p>Q. You went off then back to Mr. Sewai'd's ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you at that time heard of any reward for the apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion of the supposed assassin of Mr. Seward ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I heard that there was a reward for different ones ;
</p>
<p>but I did not hear, and have not heard yet, that there was a reward
</p>
<p>for him.
</p>
<p>Q. You heard, then, of rewards offered for the apprehension of
</p>
<p>some ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes ! I saw the bills posted up on the street. I saw a
</p>
<p>bill posted up the very next morning, offering a reward of $10,000
</p>
<p>from General Augur's headquarters ; but I did not see any for him

<p>alone like there was for the rest of them.
