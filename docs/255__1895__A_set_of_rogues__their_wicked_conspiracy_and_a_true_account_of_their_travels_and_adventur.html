<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>Of my companions and our adversities, and in particular from our
</p>
<p>getting into the stocks at Tottenham Cross to our being robbed at
</p>
<p>Edmonton.
</p>
<p>THERE being no plays to be acted at the "Red Bull,"
</p>
<p>because of the Plague, and the players all cast adrift for
</p>
<p>want of employment, certain of us, to wit, Jack Dawson
</p>
<p>and his daughter Moll, Ned Herring, and myself, clubbed
</p>
<p>our monies together to buy a store of dresses, painted
</p>
<p>cloths, and the like, with a cart and horse to carry them,
</p>
<p>and thus provided set forth to travel the country and turn
</p>
<p>an honest penny, in those parts where the terror of pesti-
</p>
<p>lence had not yet turned men's stomachs against the pleas-
</p>
<p>ures of life. And here, at our setting out, let me show
</p>
<p>what kind of company we were. First, then, for our
</p>
<p>master, Jack Dawson, who on no occasion was to be given
</p>
<p>a second place; he was a hale, jolly fellow, who would eat
</p>
<p>a pound of beef for his breakfast (when he could get it),
</p>
<p>and make nothing of half a gallon of ale therewith, a very
</p>
<p>masterful man, but kindly withal, and pleasant to look at
</p>
<p>when not contraried, with never a line of care in his face,
</p>
<p>though turned of fifty. He played our humorous parts, but
</p>
<p>he had a sweet voice for singing of ditties, and could fetch
</p>
<p>a tear as readily as a laugh, and he was also exceeding

</p>
<p>nimble at a dance, which was the strangest thing in the
</p>
<p>world, considering his great girth. Wife he had none,
</p>
<p>but Moll Dawson was his daughter, who was a most
</p>
<p>sprightly, merry little wench, but no miracle for beauty,
</p>
<p>being neither child nor woman at this time; surprisingly
</p>
<p>thin, as if her frame had grown out of proportion with her
</p>
<p>flesh, so that her body looked all arms and legs, and her
</p>
<p>head all mouth and eyes, with a great towzled mass of
</p>
<p>chestnut hair, which (off the stage) was as often as not half
</p>
<p>tumbled over her shoulder. But a quicker little baggage
</p>
<p>at mimicry (she would play any part, from an urchin of ten
</p>
<p>to a crone of fourscore), or a livelier at dancing of Brantles
</p>
<p>or the single Coranto never was, I do think, and as merry
</p>
<p>as a grig. Of Ned Herring I need only here say that he
</p>
<p>was the most tearing villain imaginable on the stage, and off
</p>
<p>it the most civil-spoken, honest-seeming young gentleman.
</p>
<p>Nor need I trouble to give a very lengthy description of
</p>
<p>myself; what my character was will appear hereafter, and
</p>
<p>as for my looks, the less I say about them, the better. Be-
</p>
<p>ing something of a scholar and a poet, I had nearly died of
</p>
<p>starvation, when Jack Dawson gave me a footing on the
</p>
<p>stage, where I would play the part of a hero in one act, a
</p>
<p>lacquey in the second, and a merry Andrew in the third,
</p>
<p>scraping a tune on my fiddle to fill up the intermedios.
</p>
<p>We had designed to return to London as soon as the
</p>
<p>Plague abated, unless we were favoured with extraordinary
</p>
<p>good fortune, and so, when we heard that the sickness was
</p>
<p>certainly past, and the citizens recovering of their panic,
</p>
<p>we (being by this time heartily sick of our venture, which
</p>
<p>at the best gave us but beggarly recompense) set about to

</p>
<p>retrace our steps with cheerful expectations of better times.
</p>
<p>WE SET FIRE TO A BARN. 3
</p>
<p>But coming to Oxford, we there learned that a prodigious
</p>
<p>fire had burnt all London down, from the Tower to Lud-
</p>
<p>gate, so that if we were there, we should find no house to
</p>
<p>play in. This lay us flat in our hopes, and set us again
</p>
<p>to our vagabond enterprise; and so for six months more
</p>
<p>we scoured the country in a most miserable plight, the
</p>
<p>roads being exceedingly foul, and folks more humoured of
</p>
<p>nights to drowse in their chimnies than to sit in a draughty
</p>
<p>barn and witness our performances; and then, about the
</p>
<p>middle of February we, in a kind of desperation, got back
</p>
<p>again to London, only to find that we must go forth again,
</p>
<p>the town still lying in ruins, and no one disposed to any
</p>
<p>kind of amusement, except in high places, where such
</p>
<p>actors as we were held in contempt. So we, with our
</p>
<p>hearts in our boots, as one may say, set out again to seek
</p>
<p>our fortunes on the Cambridge road, and here, with no
</p>
<p>better luck than elsewhere, for at Tottenham Cross we had
</p>
<p>the mischance to set fire to the barn wherein we were play-
</p>
<p>ing, by a candle falling in some loose straw, whereby we
</p>
<p>did injury to the extent of some shilling or two, for which
</p>
<p>the farmer would have us pay a pound, and Jack Dawson
</p>
<p>stoutly refusing to satisfy his demand he sends for the con-
</p>
<p>stable, who locks us all up in the cage that night, to take
</p>
<p>us before the magistrate in the morning. And we found
</p>
<p>to our cost that this magistrate had as little justice as
</p>
<p>mercy in his composition ; for though he lent a patient ear
</p>
<p>to the farmer's case, he would not listen to Jack Dawson' s
</p>
<p>argument, which was good enough, being to the effect that
</p>
<p>we had not as much as a pound amongst us, and that he
</p>
<p>would rather be hanged than pay it if he had; and when

</p>
<p>4 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>urged that, since the damage was not done by any design
</p>
<p>of ours, it must be regarded as a visitation of Providence,
</p>
<p>he says : " Very good. If it be the will of Providence that
</p>
<p>one should be scourged, I take it as the Divine purpose
</p>
<p>that I should finish the business by scourging the other";
</p>
<p>and therewith he orders the constable to take what money
</p>
<p>we have from our pockets and clap us in the stocks till sun-
</p>
<p>down for payment of the difference. So in the stocks we
</p>
<p>three poor men were stuck for six mortal hours, which was
</p>
<p>a wicked, cruel thing indeed, with the wind blowing a sort
</p>
<p>of rainy snow about our ears; and there I do think we must
</p>
<p>have perished of cold and vexation but that our little Moll
</p>
<p>brought us a sheet for a cover, and tired not in giving us
</p>
<p>kind words of comfort.
</p>
<p>At five o'clock the constable unlocked us from our vile
</p>
<p>confinement, and I do believe we should have fallen upon
</p>
<p>him and done him a mischief for his pains there and then,
</p>
<p>but that we were all frozen as stiff as stones with sitting in
</p>
<p>the cold so long, and indeed it was some time ere we could
</p>
<p>move our limbs at all. However, with much ado, we
</p>
<p>hobbled on at the tail of our cart, all three very bitter, but
</p>
<p>especially Ned Herring, who cursed most horridly and as I
</p>
<p>had never heard him curse off the stage, saying he would
</p>
<p>rather have stayed in London to carry links for the gentry
</p>
<p>than join us again in this damnable adventure, etc. And
</p>
<p>that which incensed him the more was the merriment of
</p>
<p>our Moll, who, seated on the side of the cart, could do
</p>
<p>nothing better than make sport of our discontent. But there
</p>
<p>was no malice in her laughter, which, if it sprang not from
</p>
<p>sheer love of mischief, arose maybe from overflowing joy

</p>
<p>VERY MERRY AT EDMONTON. 5
</p>
<p>Coming at dusk to Edmonton, and finding a fine new
</p>
<p>inn there, called the "Bell," Jack Dawson leads the cart
</p>
<p>into the yard, we following without a word of demur, and,
</p>
<p>after putting up our trap, into the warm parlour we go, and
</p>
<p>call for supper as boldly as you please. Then, when we
</p>
<p>had eaten and drunk till we could no more, all to bed like
</p>
<p>princes, which, after a night in the cage and a day in the
</p>
<p>stocks, did seem like a very paradise. But how we were
</p>
<p>to pay for this entertainment not one 9f us knew, nor did
</p>
<p>we greatly care, being made quite reckless by our necessi-
</p>
<p>ties. It was the next morning, when we met together at
</p>
<p>breakfast, that our faces betrayed some compunctions; but
</p>
<p>these did not prevent us eating prodigiously. " For," whis-
</p>
<p>pers Ned Herring, " if we are to be hanged, it may as well
</p>
<p>be for a sheep as a lamb." However, Jack Dawson, get-
</p>
<p>ting on the right side of the landlord, who seemed a very
</p>
<p>honest, decent man for an innkeeper, agreed with him that
</p>
<p>we should give a performance that night in a cart-shed very
</p>
<p>proper to our purpose, giving him half of our taking in
</p>
<p>payment of our entertainment. This did Jack, thinking
</p>
<p>from our late ill-luck we should get at the most a dozen
</p>
<p>people in the sixpenny benches, and a score standing at
</p>
<p>twopence a head. But it turned out, as the cunning land-
</p>
<p>lord had foreseen, that our hanger was packed close to
</p>
<p>the very door, in consequence of great numbers coming to
</p>
<p>the town in the afternoon to see a bull baited, so that when
</p>
<p>Jack Dawson closed the doors and came behind our scene
</p>
<p>to dress for his part, he told us he had as good as five
</p>
<p>pounds in his pocket. With that to cheer us we played
</p>
<p>our tragedy of "The Broken Heart " very merrily, and after

</p>
<p>that, changing our dresses in a twinkling, Jack Dawson,
</p>
<p>O A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>disguised as a wild man, and Moll as a wood nymph, came
</p>
<p>on to the stage to dance a pastoral, whilst I, in the fashion
</p>
<p>of a satyr, stood on one side plying the fiddle to their foot-
</p>
<p>ing. Then, all being done, Jack thanks the company for
</p>
<p>their indulgence, and bids 'em good-night.
</p>
<p>And now, before all the company are yet out of the
</p>
<p>place, and while Jack Dawson is wiping the sweat from
</p>
<p>his face, comes the landlord, and asks pretty bluntly to be
</p>
<p>paid his share of our earnings.
</p>
<p>"Well," says Jack, in a huff, "I see no reason for any
</p>
<p>such haste; but if you will give me time to put on my
</p>
<p>breeches, you shall be paid all the same." And therewith
</p>
<p>he takes down his trunks from the nail where they hung.
</p>
<p>And first giving them a doubtful shake, as seeming lighter
</p>
<p>than he expected, and hearing no chink of money, he
</p>
<p>thrusts his hand into one pocket, and then into the other,
</p>
<p>and cries in dismay: "Heaven's mercy upon us; we are
</p>
<p>robbed ! Every penny of our money is gone ! "
</p>
<p>" Can you think of nothing better than such an idle story
</p>
<p>as that?" says the landlord. "There hath been none be-
</p>
<p>hind this sheet but yourselves all the night."
</p>
<p>We could make no reply to this, but stood gaping at each
</p>
<p>other in a maze for some seconds; then Jack Dawson, re-
</p>
<p>covering his wits, turns him round, and looking about,
</p>
<p>cries: "Why, where's Ned Herring?"
</p>
<p>"If you mean him as was killed in your play," says the
</p>
<p>landlord, "I'll answer for it he's not far off; for, to my
</p>
<p>knowledge, he was in the house drinking with a man while
</p>
<p>you were a-dancing of your antics like a fool. And I only
</p>
<p>hope you may be as honest a man as he, for he paid for

</p>
<p>his liquor like a gentleman."
</p>
<p>SCURVY BEHAVIOUR OF NED HERRING. /
</p>
<p>That settled the question, for we knew the constable had
</p>
<p>left never a penny in his pocket when he clapt us in the
</p>
<p>stocks.
</p>
<p>"Well," says Jack, "he has our money, as you may
</p>
<p>prove by searching us, and if you have faith in him 'tis all
</p>
<p>as one, and you may rest easy for your reckoning being
</p>
<p>paid against his return."
</p>
<p>The landlord went off, vowing he would take the law of
</p>
<p>us if he were not paid by the morning; and we, as soon
</p>
<p>as we had shuffled on our clothes, away to hunt for Ned,
</p>
<p>thinking that maybe he had made off with the money to
</p>
<p>avoid paying half to the landlord, and hoping always that,
</p>
<p>though he might play the rogue with him, he would deal
</p>
<p>honestly by us. But we could find no trace of him, though
</p>
<p>we visited every alehouse in the town, and so back we go,
</p>
<p>crestfallen, to the Bell, to beg the innkeeper to give us a
</p>
<p>night's lodging and a crust of bread on the speculation
</p>
<p>that Ned would come back and settle our accounts; but he
</p>
<p>would not listen to our prayers, and so, hungry and thirsty,
</p>
<p>and miserable beyond expression, we were fain to make
</p>
<p>up with a loft over the stables, where, thanks to a good
</p>
<p>store of sweet hay, we soon forgot our troubles in sleep,
</p>
<p>but not before we had concerted to get away in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing betimes to escape another day in the stocks.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, before the break of day, we were afoot,
</p>
<p>and after noiselessly packing our effects in the cart in the
</p>
<p>misty grey light, Jack Dawson goes in the stable to harness
</p>
<p>our nag, while I as silently take down the heavy bar that
</p>
<p>fastened the yard gate. But while I was yet fumbling at
</p>
<p>the bolts, and all of a shake for fear of being caught in the

<p>act, Jack Dawson comes to me, with Moll holding of his

</p>
<p>hand, as she would when our troubles were great, and says
</p>
<p>in a tone of despair :
</p>
<p>" Give over, Kit. We are all undone again. For our
</p>
<p>harness is stole, and there's never another I can take in its
</p>
<p>place."
</p>
<p>While we were at this stumble, out comes our landlord
</p>
<p>to make sport of us. " Have you found your money yet,
</p>
<p>friends? " says he, with a sneer.
</p>
<p>"No," says Jack, savagely, "and our money is not all
</p>
<p>that we have lost, for some villain has filched our nag's
</p>
<p>harness, and I warrant you know who he is."
</p>
<p>"Why, to be sure," returns the other, "the same friend
</p>
<p>may have taken it who has gone astray with your other
</p>
<p>belongings; but, be that as it may, I'll answer for it when
</p>
<p>your money is found your harness will be forthcoming, and
</p>
<p>not before."
</p>
<p>"Come, Master," says I, "have you no more heart than
</p>
<p>to make merry at the mischances of three poor wretches
</p>
<p>such as we? "
</p>
<p>"Aye," says he, "when you can show that you deserve
</p>
<p>better treatment."
</p>
<p>"Done," says Jack. "I'll show you that as quickly as
</p>
<p>you please." With that he whips off his cap, and flinging
</p>
<p>it on the ground, cries: "Off with your jacket, man, and
</p>
<p>let us prove by such means as Heaven has given all which
</p>
<p>is the honester of us two. And so he squares himself up
</p>
<p>to fight; but the innkeeper, though as big a man as he, be-
</p>
<p>ing of a spongy constitution, showed no relish for this
</p>
<p>mode of argument, and turning his back on us with a shake
</p>
<p>of the head, said he was very well satisfied of his own hon-

</p>
<p>the law would give us, adding slyly, as he turned at the
</p>
<p>door, that he could recommend us a magistrate of his ac-
</p>
<p>quaintance, naming him who had set us in the stocks at
</p>
<p>Tottenham Cross.
</p>
<p>The very hint of this put us again in a quake, and now,
</p>
<p>the snow beginning to fall pretty heavily, we went into
</p>
<p>the shed to cast about as to what on earth we should do
</p>
<p>next. There we sat, glum and silent, watching idly the
</p>
<p>big flakes of snow fluttering down from the leaden sky, for
</p>
<p>not one of us could imagine a way out of this hobble.
</p>
<p>"Holy Mother!" cries Jack at length, springing up in
</p>
<p>a passion, " we cannot sit here and starve of cold and hun-
</p>
<p>ger. Cuddle up to my arm, Moll, and do you bring your
</p>
<p>fiddle, Kit, and let us try our luck a-begging in alehouses."
</p>
<p>And so we trudged out into the driving snow, that
</p>
<p>blinded us as we walked, bow our heads as we might, and
</p>
<p>tried one alehouse after the other, but all to no purpose,
</p>
<p>the parlours being empty because of the early hour, and
</p>
<p>the snow keeping folks within doors; only, about midday,
</p>
<p>some carters, who had pulled up at an inn, took pity on us,
</p>
<p>and gave us a mug of penny ale and half a loaf, and that
</p>
<p>was all the food we had the whole miserable day. Then
</p>
<p>at dusk, wet-footed and fagged out in mind and body, we
</p>
<p>trudged back to the Bell, thinking to get back into the loft
</p>
<p>and bury ourselves in the sweet hay for warmth and com-
</p>
<p>fort. But coming hither, we found our nag turned out of
</p>
<p>the stable and the door locked, so that we were thrown
</p>
<p>quite into despair by the loss of this last poor hope, and
</p>
<p>poor Moll, turning her face away from us, burst out a-
</p>
<p>crying she who all day had set us a brave example by

</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>Of our first acquaintance with the Senor Don Sanchez del Castillo de
</p>
<p>Castelana, and his brave entertaining of us.
</p>
<p>I WAS taking a turn or two outside the shed, for the
</p>
<p>sight of Jack Dawson hugging poor Moll to his breast and
</p>
<p>trying to soothe her bodily misery with gentle words was
</p>
<p>more than I could bear, when a drawer coming across
</p>
<p>from the inn told me that a gentleman in the Cherry room
</p>
<p>would have us come to him. I gave him a civil answer
</p>
<p>and carried this message to my friends. Moll, who had
</p>
<p>staunched her tears and was smiling piteously, though her
</p>
<p>sobs, like those of a child, still shook her thin frame, and
</p>
<p>her father both looked at me in blank doubt as fearing
</p>
<p>some trap for our further discomfiture.
</p>
<p>"Nay," says Jack, stoutly. "Fate can serve us no worse
</p>
<p>within doors than without, so let us in and face this gentle-
</p>
<p>man, whoever he is."
</p>
<p>So in we go, and all sodden and bedrabbled as we were,
</p>
<p>went to follow the drawer upstairs, when the landlady cried
</p>
<p>out she would not have us go into her Cherry room in that
</p>
<p>pickle, to soil her best furniture and disgrace her house, and
</p>
<p>bade the fellow carry us into the kitchen to take off our
</p>
<p>cloaks and change our boots for slip-shoes, adding that if
</p>
<p>we had any respect for ourselves, we should trim our hair
</p>
<p>and wash the grime off our faces. So we enter the kitchen,
</p>
<p>nothing loath, where a couple of pullets browning on the

<p>SURPRISING GOOD FORTUNE. II
</p>
<p>spit, kettles bubbling on the fire, and a pasty drawing from
</p>
<p>the oven, filled the air with delicious odours that nearly
</p>
<p>drove us mad for envy ; and to think that these good
</p>
<p>things were to tempt the appetite of some one who never
</p>
<p>hungered, while we, famishing for want, had not even a crust
</p>
<p>to appease our cravings ! But it was some comfort to
</p>
<p>plunge our blue, numbed fingers into a tub of hot water and
</p>
<p>feel the life blood creeping back into our hearts. The
</p>
<p>paint we had put on our cheeks the night before was
</p>
<p>streaked all over our faces by the snow, so that we did look
</p>
<p>the veriest scarecrows imaginable ; but after washing our
</p>
<p>heads well and stroking our hair into order with a comb
</p>
<p>Mistress Cook lent us, we looked not so bad. And thus
</p>
<p>changed, and with dry shoes to our feet, we at length went
</p>
<p>upstairs, all full of wondering expectation, and were led into
</p>
<p>the Cherry room, which seemed to us a very palace, being
</p>
<p>lit with half a dozen candles (and they of wax) and filled
</p>
<p>with a warm glow by the blazing logs on the hearth reflected
</p>
<p>in the cherry hangings. And there in the midst was a table
</p>
<p>laid for supper with a wondrous white cloth, glasses to drink
</p>
<p>from, and silver forks all set out most bravely.
</p>
<p>" His worship will be down ere long," says the drawer,
</p>
<p>and with that he makes a pretence of building up the fire,
</p>
<p>being warned thereto very like by the landlady, with an eye
</p>
<p>to the safety of her silver.
</p>
<p>"Can you tell me his worship's name, friend ? " I whispered,
</p>
<p>my mind turning at once to his worship of Tottenham
</p>
<p>Cross.
</p>
<p>" Not I, were you to pay me," says he. " 'Tis that out-
</p>
<p>landish and uncommon. But for sure he is some great

<p>foreign grandee."
</p>
<p>12 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>He could tell us no more, so we stood there all together,
</p>
<p>wondering, till presently the door opens, and a tall, lean
</p>
<p>gentleman enters, with a high front, very finely dressed in
</p>
<p>linen stockings, a long-waisted coat, and embroidered waist-
</p>
<p>coat, and rich lace at his cuffs and throat. He wore no
</p>
<p>peruke, but his own hair, cut quite close to his head, with a
</p>
<p>pointed beard and a pair of long moustachios twisting up
</p>
<p>almost to his ears ; but his appearance was the more
</p>
<p>striking by reason of his beard and moustachios being quite
</p>
<p>black, while the hair on his head was white as silver. He
</p>
<p>had dark brows also, that overhung very rich black eyes ;
</p>
<p>his nose was long and hooked, and his skin, which was of a
</p>
<p>very dark complexion, was closely lined with wrinkles about
</p>
<p>the eyes, while a deep furrow lay betwixt his brows. He
</p>
<p>carried his head very high, and was majestic and gracious
</p>
<p>in all his movements, not one of which (as it seemed to
</p>
<p>me) was made but of forethought and purpose. I should
</p>
<p>say his age was about sixty, though his step and carriage
</p>
<p>were of a younger man. To my eyes he appeared a very
</p>
<p>handsome and a pleasing, amiable gentleman. But, Lord,
</p>
<p>what can you conclude of a man at a single glance, when
</p>
<p>every line in his face (of which he had a score and more)
</p>
<p>has each its history of varying passions, known only to
</p>
<p>himself, and secret phases of his life !
</p>
<p>He saluted us with a most noble bow, and dismissed the
</p>
<p>drawer with a word in an undertone. Then turning again
</p>
<p>to us, he said : " I had the pleasure of seeing you act last
</p>
<p>night, and dance," he adds with a slight inclination of his
</p>
<p>head to Moll. "Naturally, I wish to be better acquainted
</p>
<p>with you. Will it please you to dine with me? "

</p>
<p>I could not have been more dumbfounded had an angel
</p>
<p>ENTERTAINED LIKE PRINCES. 13
</p>
<p>asked me to step into heaven ; but Dawson was quick
</p>
<p>enough to say something.
</p>
<p>" That will we," cries he, " and God bless your worship for
</p>
<p>taking pity on us, for I doubt not you have heard of our
</p>
<p>troubles."
</p>
<p>The other bowed his head and set a chair at the end of
</p>
<p>the table for Moll, which she took with a pretty curtsey, but
</p>
<p>saying never a word, for glee did seem to choke us all.
</p>
<p>And being seated, she cast her eyes on the bread hungrily,
</p>
<p>as if she would fain begin at once, but she had the good
</p>
<p>manners to restrain herself. Then his worship (as we called
</p>
<p>him), having shown us the chairs on either side, seated
</p>
<p>himself last of all, at the head of the table, facing our Moll,
</p>
<p>whom whenever he might without discourtesy, he regarded
</p>
<p>with most scrutinising glances from first to last. Then the
</p>
<p>door flinging open, two drawers brought in those same fat
</p>
<p>pullets we had seen browning before the fire, and also the
</p>
<p>pasty, with abundance of other good cheer, at which Moll,
</p>
<p>with a little cry of delight, whispers to me :
</p>
<p>" 'Tis like a dream. Do speak to me, Kit, or I must think
</p>
<p>'twill all fade away presently and leave us in the snow."
</p>
<p>Then I, finding my tongue, begged his worship would
</p>
<p>pardon us if our manners were more uncouth than the
</p>
<p>society to which he was accustomed.
</p>
<p>" Nay," says Dawson. " Your worship will like us none
</p>
<p>the worse, I warrant, for seeing what we are and aping none."
</p>
<p>Finding himself thus beworshipped on both hands, our
</p>
<p>good friend says :
</p>
<p>" You may call me Sefior. I am a Spaniard. Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez del Castillo de Castelana." And then to turn the

<p>subject, he adds : " I have seen you play twice."
</p>
<p>14 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>" Aye, Senor, and I should have known you again if by
</p>
<p>nothing but this piece of generosity," replies Dawson, with
</p>
<p>his cheek full of pasty, " for I remember both times you set
</p>
<p>down a piece and would take no change."
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez hunched his shoulders cavalierly, as if such
</p>
<p>trifles were nought to him ; but indeed throughout his man-
</p>
<p>ner was most high and noble.
</p>
<p>And now, being fairly settled down to our repast, we said
</p>
<p>no more of any moment that I can recall to mind till we
</p>
<p>had done (which was not until nought remained of the
</p>
<p>pullets and the pasty but a few bones and the bare dish),
</p>
<p>and we were drawn round the fire at Don Sanchez's
</p>
<p>invitation. Then the drawers, having cleared the tables,
</p>
<p>brought up a huge bowl of hot spiced wine, a dish of
</p>
<p>tobacco, and some pipes. The Don then offered us to
</p>
<p>smoke some cigarros, but we, not understanding them, took
</p>
<p>instead our homely pipes, and each with a beaker of hot
</p>
<p>wine to his hand sat roasting before the fire, scarce saying a
</p>
<p>word, the Don being silent because his humour was of the re-
</p>
<p>flective grave kind (with all his courtesies he never smiled,
</p>
<p>as if such demonstrations were unbecoming to his dignity),
</p>
<p>and we from repletion and a feeling of wondrous content-
</p>
<p>ment and repose. And another thing served to keep us still,
</p>
<p>which was that our Moll, sitting beside her father, almost at
</p>
<p>once fell asleep, her head lying against his shoulder as he
</p>
<p>sat with his arm about her waist. As at the table, Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez had seated himself where he could best observe her,
</p>
<p>and now he scarcely once took his eyes off her, which were
</p>
<p>half closed as if in speculation. At length, taking the cigarro
</p>
<p>from his lips, he says softly to Jack Dawson, so .as not to

</p>
<p>arouse Moll :
</p>
<p>"WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER?" 15
</p>
<p>" Your daughter."
</p>
<p>Jack nods for an answer, and looking down on her face
</p>
<p>with pride and tenderness, he put back with the stem of his
</p>
<p>pipe a little curl that had strayed over her eyes. She was
</p>
<p>not amiss for looks thus, with her long eyelashes lying like
</p>
<p>a fringe upon her cheeks, her lips open, showing her good
</p>
<p>white teeth, and the glow of the firelight upon her face ;
</p>
<p>but her attitude and the innocent, happy expression of her
</p>
<p>features made up a picture which seemed to me mighty
</p>
<p>pretty.
</p>
<p>"Where is her mother?" asks Don Sanchez, presently ;
</p>
<p>and Dawson, without taking his eyes from Moll's face, lifts
</p>
<p>his pipe upwards, while his big thick lips fell a- trembling.
</p>
<p>Maybe, he was thinking of his poor Betty as he looked at
</p>
<p>the child's face.
</p>
<p>"Has she no other relatives?" asks the Don, in the
</p>
<p>same quiet tone ; and Jack shakes his head, still looking
</p>
<p>down, and answers lowly :
</p>
<p>" Only me."
</p>
<p>Then after another pause the Don asks :
</p>
<p>" What will become of her? "
</p>
<p>And that thought also must have been in Jack Davvson's
</p>
<p>mind ; for without seeming surprised by the question, which
</p>
<p>appeared a strange one, he answers reverently, but with
</p>
<p>a shake in his hoarse voice, " Almighty God knows."
</p>
<p>This stilled us all for the moment, and then Don Sanchez,
</p>
<p>seeing that these reflections threw a gloom upon us, turned
</p>
<p>to me, sitting next him, and asked if I would give him some
</p>
<p>account of my history, whereupon I briefly told him how
</p>
<p>three years ago Jack Dawson had lifted me out of the mire,

</p>
<p>and how since then we had lived in brotherhood. "And,"
</p>
<p>l6 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>says I in conclusion, " we will continue with the favour of
</p>
<p>Providence to live so, sharing good and ill fortune alike to
</p>
<p>the end, so much we do love one another."
</p>
<p>To this Jack Dawson nods assent.
</p>
<p>"And your other fellow, what of him?" asked Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez.
</p>
<p>I replied that Ned Herring was but a fair-weather friend,
</p>
<p>who had joined fortunes with us to get out of London and
</p>
<p>escape the Plague, and how having robbed us, we were like
</p>
<p>never to see his face again.
</p>
<p>"And well for him if we do not," cries Dawson, rousing
</p>
<p>up " for by the Lord, if I clap eyes on him, though it be a
</p>
<p>score of years hence, he shan't escape the most horrid beating
</p>
<p>ever man outlived ! "
</p>
<p>The Don nodded his satisfaction at this, and then Moll,
</p>
<p>awaking with the sudden outburst of her father's voice, gives
</p>
<p>first a gape, then a shiver, and looking about her with an air
</p>
<p>of wonder, smiles as her eye fell on the Don. Whereon,
</p>
<p>still as solemn as any judge, he pulls the bell, and the maid,
</p>
<p>coming to the room with a rushlight, he bids her take the
</p>
<p>poor weary child to bed, and the best there is in the house,
</p>
<p>which I think did delight Dawson not less than his Moll to
</p>
<p>hear.
</p>
<p>Then Moll gives her father a kiss, and me another
</p>
<p>according to her wont, and drops a civil curtsey to Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez.
</p>
<p>" Give me thy hand, child," says he ; and having it, he
</p>
<p>lifts it to his lips and kisses it as if she had been the finest
</p>
<p>lady in the land.
</p>
<p>She being gone, the Don calls for a second bowl of spiced

<p>half-hour of comfort, stretch our legs out afresh before the

<p>fire. Then Don Sanchez, lighting another cigarro, and setting
</p>
<p>his chair towards us, says as he takes his knee up betwixt
</p>
<p>his long, thin fingers :

</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>Of that design which Don Sanchez opened to us at the BelL
</p>
<p>WE pulled our pipes from our mouths, Dawson and I, and
</p>
<p>stretched our ears very eager to know what this business
</p>
<p>was the Don had to propound, and he, after drawing two or
</p>
<p>three mouthfuls of smoke, which he expelled through his
</p>
<p>nostrils in a most surprising unnatural manner, says in
</p>
<p>excellent good English, but speaking mighty slow and
</p>
<p>giving every letter its worth :
</p>
<p>" What do you go to do to-morrow? "
</p>
<p>" The Lord only knows," answers Jack, and Don Sanchez,
</p>
<p>lifting his eyebrows as if he considers this no answer at all,
</p>
<p>he continues : " We cannot go hence without our stage
</p>
<p>things ; and if we could, I see not how we are to act our
</p>
<p>play, now that our villain is gone, with a plague to him ! I
</p>
<p>doubt but we must sell all that we have for the few shillings
</p>
<p>they will fetch to get us out of this hobble."
</p>
<p>" With our landlord's permission," remarks Don Sanchez,
</p>
<p>dryly.
</p>
<p>" Permission ! " cries Dawson, in a passion. " I ask no
</p>
<p>man's permission to do what I please with my own."
</p>
<p>" Suppose he claims these things in payment of the money
</p>
<p>you owe him. What then? " asks the Don.
</p>
<p>" We never thought of that, Kit," says Dawson, turning
</p>
<p>to me in a pucker. " But 'tis likely enough he has, for I
</p>
<p>observed he was mighty careless whether we found our thief

<p>VERY PROPERLY REPROVED. IQ
</p>
<p>or not. That's it, sure enough. We have nought to hope.
</p>
<p>All's lost ! "
</p>
<p>With that he drops his elbows on his knees, and stares
</p>
<p>into the fire with a most desponding countenance, being in
</p>
<p>that stage of liquor when a man must either laugh or weep.
</p>
<p>"Come, Jack," says I. "You are not used to yield like
</p>
<p>this. Let us make the best of a bad lot, and face the worst
</p>
<p>like men. Though we trudge hence with nothing but the
</p>
<p>rags on our backs, we shall be no worse off to-morrow than
</p>
<p>we were this morning."
</p>
<p>"Why, that's true enough!" cries he, plucking up his
</p>
<p>courage. " Let the thieving rascal take our poor nag and
</p>
<p>our things for his payment, and much good may they do him.
</p>
<p>We will wipe this out of our memory the moment we leave
</p>
<p>his cursed inn behind us."
</p>
<p>It seemed to me that this would not greatly advance us,
</p>
<p>and maybe Don Sanchez thought the same, for he presently
</p>
<p>asks :
</p>
<p>"And what then?"
</p>
<p>"Why, Sefior," replies Dawson, "we will face each new
</p>
<p>buffet as it comes, and make a good fight of it till we're
</p>
<p>beat. A man may die but once."
</p>
<p>"You think only of yourselves," says the Don, very
</p>
<p>quietly.
</p>
<p>" And pray, saving your Sefior's presence, who else should
</p>
<p>we think of ? "
</p>
<p>" The child above," answers the Don, a little more sternly
</p>
<p>than he had yet spoken. " Is a young creature like that to
</p>
<p>bear the buffets you are so bold to meet? Can you offer
</p>
<p>her no shelter from the wind and rain but such as chance

</p>
<p>2O A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>to protect her against the evils that lie in the path of friend-
</p>
<p>less maids?"
</p>
<p>" God forgive me," says Jack, humbly. And then we
</p>
<p>could say nothing, for thinking what might befall Moll if
</p>
<p>we should be parted, but sat there under the keen eye of
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez, looking helplessly into the fire. And there
</p>
<p>was no sound until Jack's pipe, slipping from his hand, fell
</p>
<p>and broke in pieces upon the hearth. Then rousing himself
</p>
<p>up and turning to Don Sanchez, he says :
</p>
<p>" The Lord help her, Sefior, if we find no good friend to
</p>
<p>lend us a few shillings for our present wants."
</p>
<p>"Good friends are few," says the Don, "and they who
</p>
<p>lend need some better security for repayment than chance.
</p>
<p>For my own part, I would as soon fling straws to a drowning
</p>
<p>man as attempt to save you and that child from ruin by set-
</p>
<p>ting you on your feet to-day only to fall again to-morrow."
</p>
<p>" If that be so, Sefior," says I, " you had some larger view
</p>
<p>in mind than that of offering temporary relief to our misery
</p>
<p>when you gave us a supper and Moll a bed for the night."
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez assented with a grave inclination of his
</p>
<p>head, and going to the door opened it sharply, listened
</p>
<p>awhile, and then closing it softly, returned and stood before
</p>
<p>us with folded arms. Then, in a low voice, not to be heard
</p>
<p>beyond the room, he questioned us very particularly as to
</p>
<p>our relations with other men, the length of time we had
</p>
<p>been wandering about the country, and especially about the
</p>
<p>tractability of Moll. And, being satisfied with our replies,
</p>
<p>above all, with Jack's saying that Moll would jump out
</p>
<p>of window at his bidding, without a thought to the conse-
</p>
<p>quences, he says :

<p>" There's a comedy we might play to some advantage if
</p>
<p>DON SANCHEZ OPENS HIS SCHEME. 21
</p>
<p>you were minded to take the parts I give you and act them
</p>
<p>as I direct."
</p>
<p>" With all my heart," cries Dawson. " I'll play any part
</p>
<p>you choose ; and as to the directing, you're welcome to that,
</p>
<p>for I've had my fill of it. If you can make terms with our
</p>
<p>landlord, those things in the yard shall be yours, and for our
</p>
<p>payment I'm willing to trust to your honour's generosity."
</p>
<p>" As regards payment," says the Don, " I can speak
</p>
<p>precisely. We shall gain fifty thousand pounds by our
</p>
<p>performance."
</p>
<p>" Fifty thousand pounds," says Jack, as if in doubt
</p>
<p>whether he had heard aright. Don Sanchez bent his
</p>
<p>head, without stirring a line in his face.
</p>
<p>Dawson took up his beaker slowly, and looked in it, to
</p>
<p>make sure that he was none the worse for drink, then, after
</p>
<p>emptying it, to steady his wits, he says again :
</p>
<p>"Fifty thousand pounds."
</p>
<p>" Fifty thousand pounds, if not more ; and that there be
</p>
<p>no jealousies one of the other, it shall be divided fairly
</p>
<p>amongst us, as much for your friend as for you, for the
</p>
<p>child as for me."
</p>
<p>"Pray God, this part be no more than I can compass,"
</p>
<p>says Jack, devoutly.
</p>
<p>" You may learn it in a few hours at least, your first act."
</p>
<p>"And mine?" says I, entering for the first time into the
</p>
<p>dialogue.
</p>
<p>The Don hunched his shoulders, lifting his eyebrows, and
</p>
<p>sending two streams of smoke from his nose.
</p>
<p>" I scarce know what part to give you, yet," says he.
</p>
<p>" To be honest, you are not wanted at all in the play."

</p>
<p>stoutly; "if it be but to bring in a letter that I am deter-
</p>
<p>mined on. Kit stood by us in ill fortune, and he shall share
</p>
<p>better, or I'll have none of it, nor Moll neither. I'll answer
</p>
<p>for her."
</p>
<p>" There must be no discontent among us," says the Don,
</p>
<p>meaning thereby, as I think, that he had included me in his
</p>
<p>stratagem for fear I might mar it from envy. "The girl's
</p>
<p>part is that which gives me most concern and had I not
</p>
<p>faith in my own judgment "
</p>
<p>" Set your mind at ease on that score," cried Jack. " I
</p>
<p>warrant our Moll shall learn her part in a couple of days
</p>
<p>or so."
</p>
<p>" If she learn it in a twelvemonth, 'twill be time enough."
</p>
<p>" A twelvemonth," said Jack, going to his beaker again,
</p>
<p>for understanding. " Well, all's as one, so that we can get
</p>
<p>something in advance of our payment, to keep us through
</p>
<p>such a prodigious study."
</p>
<p>"I will charge myself with your expenses," says Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez ; and then, turning to me, he asks if I have any
</p>
<p>objection to urge.
</p>
<p>" I take it, Senor, that you speak in metaphor," says I ;
</p>
<p>" and that this ' comedy ' is nought but a stratagem for
</p>
<p>getting hold of a fortune that doesn't belong to us."
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez calmly assented, as if this had been the
</p>
<p>most innocent design in the world.
</p>
<p>" Hang me," cries Dawson, " if I thought it was anything
</p>
<p>but a whimsey of your honour's."
</p>
<p>" I should like to know if we may carry out this stratagem
</p>
<p>honestly," says I.
</p>
<p>" Aye," cries Jack. " I'll not agree for cutting of throats

</p>
<p>BETWIXT TWO FIRES. 23
</p>
<p>" I can tell you no more than this," says the Don. "The
</p>
<p>fortune we may take is now in the hands of a man who has
</p>
<p>no more right to it than we have."
</p>
<p>" If that's so," says Jack, "I'm with you, Senor. For I'd
</p>
<p>as lief bustle a thief out of his gains as say my prayers, any
</p>
<p>day, and liefer."
</p>
<p>" Still," says I, " the money must of right belong to some
</p>
<p>one."
</p>
<p>" We will say that the money belongs to a child of the
</p>
<p>same age as Moll."
</p>
<p>"Then it comes to this, Sefior," says I, bluntly. "We
</p>
<p>are to rob that child of fifty thousand pounds."
</p>
<p>" When you speak of robbing," says the Don, drawing
</p>
<p>himself up with much dignity, " you forget that I am to
</p>
<p>play a part in this stratagem I, Don Sanchez del Castillo
</p>
<p>de Castelafia."
</p>
<p>" Fie, Kit, han't you any manners ? " cries Dick. " What's
</p>
<p>all this talk of a child? Hasn't the Senor told us we are
</p>
<p>but to bustle a cheat?"
</p>
<p>" But I would know what is to become of this child, if
</p>
<p>we take her fortune, though it be withheld from her by
</p>
<p>another," says I, being exceeding obstinate and persistent
</p>
<p>in my liquor.
</p>
<p>" I shall prove to your conviction," says the Don, " that
</p>
<p>the child will be no worse off, if we take this money, than
</p>
<p>if we leave it in the hands of that rascally steward. But I
</p>
<p>see," adds he, contemptuously, " that for all your brotherly
</p>

</p>
<p>24 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>"Aye, and be hanged to you, Kit !" cries Dawson.
</p>
<p>"Tell me, Mr. Poet," continues Don Sanchez, "do you
</p>
<p>consider this steward who defrauds that child of a fortune
</p>
<p>is more unfeeling than you who, for a sickly qualm of
</p>
<p>conscience, would let slip this chance of making Molly an
</p>
<p>honest woman? "
</p>
<p>"Aye, answer that, Kit," adds Jack, striking his mug on
</p>
<p>the table.
</p>
<p>" I'll answer you to-morrow morning, Senor," says I.
</p>
<p>" And whether I fall in with the scheme or not is all as one,
</p>
<p>since my help is not needed ; for if it be to Moll's good, I'll
</p>
<p>bid you farewell, and you shall see me never again."
</p>
<p>"Spoken like a man !" says Don Sanchez, "and a wise
</p>
<p>one to boot. An enterprise of this nature is not to be
</p>
<p>undertaken without reflection, like the smoking of a pipe.
</p>
<p>If you put your foot forward, it must be with the under-
</p>
<p>standing that you cannot go back. I must have that assur-
</p>
<p>ance, for I shall be hundreds of pounds out of pocket ere I
</p>
<p>can get any return for my venture."
</p>
<p>" Have no fear of me or of Moll turning tail at a scare-
</p>
<p>crow," says Jack, adding with a sneer, "we are no poets."
</p>
<p>"Reflect upon it. Argue it out with your friend here,
</p>
<p>whose scruples do not displease me, and let me know your

<p>determination when the last word is said. Business carries
</p>
<p>me to London to-morrow ; but you shall meet me at night,
</p>
<p>and we will close the business aye or nay ere supper."
</p>
<p>With that he opens the door and gives us our congee,
</p>
<p>the most noble in the world ; but not offering to give us a
</p>
<p>bed, we are forced to go out of doors and grope our way

</p>
<p>our leaving a good fire. And I believe the shrewd Spaniard
</p>
<p>had put us to this pinch as a foretaste of the misery we
</p>
<p>must endure if we rejected his design, and so to shape our
</p>
<p>inclinations to his.
</p>
<p>Happily, the landlord, coming out with a lantern, and
</p>
<p>finding us by the chattering of our teeth, was moved by the
</p>
<p>consideration shown us by Don Sanchez to relax his sever-
</p>
<p>ity ; and so, unlocking the stable door, he bade us get up
</p>
<p>into the loft, which we did, blessing him as if he had been
</p>
<p>the best Christian in the world. And then, having buried
</p>
<p>ourselves in hay, Jack Dawson and I fell to arguing the
</p>
<p>matter in question, I sticking to my scruples (partly from
</p>
<p>vanity), and he stoutly holding t'other side ; and I, being
</p>
<p>warmed by my own eloquence, and he not less heated by
</p>
<p>liquor (having taken best part of the last bowl to his
</p>
<p>share), we ran it pretty high, so that at one point Jack
</p>
<p>was for lighting a candle end he had in his pocket and
</p>
<p>fighting it out like men. But, little by little, we cooled
</p>
<p>down, and towards morning, each giving way something, we
</p>
<p>came to the conclusion that we would have Don Sanchez
</p>
<p>show us the steward, that we might know the truth of his
</p>
<p>story (which I misdoubted, seeing that it was but a roguish
</p>
<p>kind of game at best that he would have us take part in),
</p>
<p>and that if we found all things as he represented them, then
</p>
<p>we would accept his offer. And also we resolved to be
</p>
<p>down betimes and let him know our determination before
</p>
<p>he set out for London, to the end that we might not be
</p>
<p>left fasting all the day. But herein we miscalculated the
</p>
<p>potency of liquor and a comfortable bed of hay, for 'twas
</p>
<p>nine o'clock before either of us winked an eye, and when

</p>
<p>full hour, and so no prospect of breaking our fast till night-
</p>
<p>fall.
</p>
<p>Presently comes Moll, all fresh and pink from the house,
</p>
<p>and falls to exclaiming upon the joy of sleeping betwixt
</p>
<p>clean sheets in a feather bed, and could speak of nothing
</p>
<p>else, saying she would give all the world to sleep so well
</p>
<p>every day of her life.
</p>
<p>"Eh," whispers her father in my ear, "you see how
</p>
<p>luxuries do tempt the poor child, and what kind of a bed
</p>
<p>she is like to lie in if our hopes miscarry."
</p>
<p>On which, still holding to my scruples, I says to Moll :
</p>
<p>" Tis easy to say you would give the world, Moll, but I
</p>
<p>know full well you would give nothing for all the comfort
</p>
<p>possible that was not your own."
</p>
<p>" Nay," says she, crossing her hands on her breast, and
</p>
<p>casting up her eyes with the look of a saint, " what are all
</p>
<p>the fruits of the earth to her who cannot take them with an
</p>
<p>easy conscience ? Honesty is dearer to me than the bread
</p>
<p>of life."
</p>
<p>Then, as Jack and I are looking at each other ruefully in
</p>
<p>the face at this dash to our knavish project, she bursts into
</p>
<p>a merry peal of laughter, like a set of Christmas bells chiming,
</p>
<p>whereupon we, turning about to find the cause of her mer-
</p>
<p>riment, she pulls another demure face, and, slowly lifting her
</p>
<p>skirt, shows us a white napkin tied about her waist, stuffed
</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.
</p>
<p>Of the several parts that we are appointed to play.
</p>
<p>FINDING a sheltered secret corner, we made a very hasty
</p>
<p>breakfast of these stolen dainties, and since we had not the
</p>
<p>heart to restore them to our innkeeper, so we had not the
</p>
<p>face to chide Moll for her larceny, but made light of the
</p>
<p>business and ate with great content and some mirth.
</p>
<p>A drizzly rain falling and turning the snow into slush, we
</p>
<p>kept under the shelter of the shed, and this giving us scope
</p>
<p>for the reflection Don Sanchez had counselled, my com-
</p>
<p>punctions were greatly shaken by the consideration of our
</p>
<p>present position and the prospect of worse. When I thought
</p>
<p>of our breakfast that Moll had stolen, and how willingly we
</p>
<p>would all have eaten a dinner got by the same means, I had
</p>
<p>to acknowledge that certainly we were all thieves at heart ;
</p>
<p>and this conclusion, together with sitting all day doing noth-
</p>
<p>ing in the raw cold, did make the design of Don Sanchez
</p>
<p>seem much less heinous to me than it appeared the night
</p>
<p>before, when I was warm and not exceedingly sober, and
</p>
<p>indeed towards dusk I came to regard it as no bad thing
</p>
<p>at all.
</p>
<p>About six comes back our Don on a fine horse, and
</p>
<p>receives our salutations with a cool nod we standing there
</p>
<p>of a row, looking our sweetest, like hungry dogs in expecta-
</p>
<p>tion of a bone. Then in he goes to the house without a
</p>
<p>word, and now my worst fear was that he had thought better

</p>
<p>of his offer and would abandon it. So there we hang about
</p>
<p>the best part of an hour, now thinking the Don would pres-
</p>
<p>ently send for us, and then growing to despair of everything
</p>
<p>but to be left in the cold forgotten ; but in the end comes
</p>
<p>Master Landlord to tell us his worship in the Cherry room
</p>
<p>would see us. So, after the same formalities of cleansing
</p>
<p>ourselves as the night afore, upstairs we go at the heels of a
</p>
<p>drawer, carrying a roast pig, which to our senses was more
</p>
<p>delightful than any bunch of flowers.
</p>
<p>With a gesture of his hands, after saluting us with great
</p>
<p>dignity, Don Sanchez bade us take our places at the table
</p>
<p>and with never a word of question as to our decision ; but
</p>
<p>that was scarce necessary, for it needed no subtle observa-
</p>
<p>tion to perceive that we would accept any conditions to get
</p>
<p>our share of that roast pig. This supper differed not greatly
</p>
<p>from the former, save that our Moll was taken with a kind
</p>
<p>of tickling at the throat which presently attracted our
</p>
<p>notice.
</p>
<p>"What ails you, Molly, my dear?" asks Jack. "Has a
</p>
<p>bit of crackling gone down the wrong way?"
</p>
<p>She put it off as if she would have us take no notice of it,
</p>
<p>but it grew worse and worse towards the end of the meal,
</p>
<p>and became a most horrid, tearing cough, which she did so
</p>
<p>natural as to deceive us all and put us in great concern, and
</p>
<p>especially Don Sanchez, who declared she must have taken
</p>
<p>a cold by being exposed all day to the damp weather.
</p>
<p>" If I have," says she, very prettily, after wiping the tears
</p>
<p>from her eyes upon another fit, " 'tis surely a most ungrate-
</p>
<p>ful return for the kindness with which you sheltered me last
</p>
<p>night, Senor."

<p>MOLL BUSTLES THE DON. 2Q
</p>
<p>poor child," replies the Don, ringing the bell. Then, the
</p>
<p>maid coming, he bids her warm a bed and prepare a hot
</p>
<p>posset against Moll was tucked up in the blankets. " And,"
</p>
<p>says he, turning to Moll, " you shall not rise till noon, my
</p>
<p>dear ; your breakfast shall be brought to you in your room,
</p>
<p>where a fire shall be made, and such treatment shown you
</p>
<p>as if you were my own child."
</p>
<p>" Oh ! what have I done that you should be so gentle to
</p>
<p>me ? " exclaims Moll, smothering another cough. And with
</p>
<p>that she reaches out her leg under the table and fetches me
</p>
<p>a kick of the shin, looking all the while as pitiful and inno-
</p>
<p>cent as any painted picture.
</p>
<p>"Would it be well to fetch in a doctor?" says Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez, when Moll was gone barking upstairs. " The child
</p>
<p>looks delicate, though she eats with a fairly good appetite."
</p>
<p>" 'Tis nothing serious," replies Jack, who had doubt-
</p>
<p>less received the same hint from Moll she had given me.
</p>
<p>" I warrant she will be mended in a day or so, with proper
</p>
<p>care. 'Tis a kind of family complaint. I am taken that
</p>
<p>way at times," and with that he rasps his throat as a hint
</p>
<p>that he would be none the worse for sleeping a night
</p>
<p>between sheets.
</p>
<p>This was carrying the matter too far, and I thought it
</p>
<p>had certainly undone us ; for stopping short, with a sta^v,
</p>
<p>in crossing the room, he turns and looks first at Dawson,
</p>
<p>then at me, with anything but a pleasant look in his eyes as
</p>
<p>finding his dignity hurt, to be thus bustled by a mere child.
</p>
<p>Then his dark eyebrows unbending with the reflection,
</p>
<p>maybe, that it was so much the better to his purpose that
</p>
<p>Moll could so act as to deceive him, he seats himself

<p>gravely, and replies to Jack :
</p>
<p>3O A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>"Your family wit may get you a night's lodging, but I
</p>
<p>doubt if you will ever merit it so well as your daughter."
</p>
<p>"Well," says Jack, with a laugh, "what wit we have
</p>
<p>amongst us we are resolved to employ in your honour's
</p>
<p>service, so that you show us this steward-fellow is a rascal
</p>
<p>that deserves to be bounced, and we do no great injury to
</p>
<p>any one else."
</p>
<p>" Good," says Don Sanchez. " We will proceed to that
</p>
<p>without delay. And now, as we have no matter to discuss,
</p>
<p>and must be afoot early to-morrow, I will ring for a light to
</p>
<p>take you to bed."
</p>
<p>So we up presently to a good snug room with a bed to
</p>
<p>each of us fit for a prince. And there, with the blankets
</p>
<p>drawn up to our ears, we fell blessing our stars that we were
</p>
<p>now fairly out of our straits, and after that to discussing
</p>
<p>whether we should consult Moll's inclination to this busi-
</p>
<p>ness. First, Dawson was for telling her plump out all about
</p>
<p>our project, saying that being so young she had no con-
</p>
<p>science to speak of, and would like nothing better than to
</p>
<p>take part in any piece of mischief. But against this I pro-
</p>
<p>tested, seeing that it would be dangerous to our design to
</p>
<p>let her know so much (she having a woman's tongue in her
</p>
<p>head), and also of a bad tendency to make her, as it were,
</p>
<p>u "the very beginning of her life, a knowing active party to
</p>
<p>what looked like nothing more nor less than a piece of
</p>
<p>knavery. Therefore I proposed we should, when necessary,
</p>
<p>tell her just so much of our plan as was expedient, and no
</p>
<p>more. And this agreeing mightily with Jack's natural turn
</p>
<p>for taking of short cuts out of difficulties, he fell in with my
</p>
<p>views at once, and so, bidding God bless me, he lays the

</p>
<p>MOLL STILL VERY DELICATE. 31
</p>
<p>In the morning we found the Don just as kind to us
</p>
<p>as the day before he had been careless, and so made us
</p>
<p>eat breakfast with him, to our great content. Also, he sent
</p>
<p>a maid up to Moll to enquire of her health, and if she could
</p>
<p>eat anything from our table, to which the baggage sends reply
</p>
<p>that she feels a little easier this morning and could fancy
</p>
<p>a dish of black puddings. These delicacies her father car-
</p>
<p>ried to her, being charged by the Don to tell her that we
</p>
<p>should be gone for a couple of days, and that in our absence
</p>
<p>she might command whatever she felt was necessary to her
</p>
<p>complete recovery against our return. Then I told Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez how we had resolved to tell Moll no more of our
</p>
<p>purpose than was necessary for the moment, which pleased
</p>
<p>him, I thought, mightily, he saying that our success or fail-
</p>
<p>ure depended upon secrecy as much as anything, for which
</p>
<p>reason he had kept us in the dark as much as ever it
</p>
<p>was possible.
</p>
<p>About eight o'clock three saddle nags were brought to the
</p>
<p>door, and we, mounting, set out for London, where we ar-
</p>
<p>rived about ten, the roads being fairly passable save in the
</p>
<p>marshy parts about Shoreditch, where the mire was knee-
</p>
<p>deep; so to Gracious Street, and there leaving our nags at the
</p>
<p>Turk inn, we walked down to the Bridge stairs, and thence
</p>
<p>with a pair of oars to Greenwich. Here, after our tedious
</p>
<p>chilly voyage, we were not ill-pleased to see the inside of an
</p>
<p>inn once more, and Don Sanchez, taking us to the King's
</p>
<p>posting-house, orders a fire to be lighted in a private room,
</p>
<p>and the best there was in the larder to be served us in the
</p>
<p>warm parlour. While we were at our trenchers Don San-
</p>
<p>chez says :

<p>" At two o'clock two men are coming hither to see me.
</p>
<p>32 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>One is a master mariner named Robert Evans, the other a
</p>
<p>merchant adventurer of his acquaintance whom I have not
</p>
<p>yet seen. Now you are to mark these two men well, note
</p>
<p>all they say and their manner of speaking, for to-morrow you
</p>
<p>will have to personate these characters before one who
</p>
<p>would be only too glad to find you at fault."
</p>
<p>" Very good, Sefior," says Dawson ; " but which of these
</p>
<p>parts am I to play? "
</p>
<p>" That you may decide when you have seen the men, but
</p>
<p>I should say from my knowledge of Robert Evans that you
</p>
<p>may best represent his character. For in your parts to-day
</p>
<p>you are to be John and Christopher Knight, two needy
</p>
<p>cousins of Lady Godwin, whose husband, Sir Richard
</p>
<p>Godwin, was lost at sea seven years ago. I doubt if you
</p>
<p>will have to do anything in these characters beyond looking
</p>
<p>eager and answering merely yes and no to such questions as
</p>
<p>I may put."
</p>
<p>Thus primed, we went presently to the sitting-room above,
</p>
<p>and the drawer shortly after coming to say that two gentle-
</p>
<p>men desired to see Don Sanchez, Jack and I seated our-
</p>
<p>selves side by side at a becoming distance from the Don,
</p>
<p>holding our hats on our knees as humbly as may be. Then
</p>
<p>in comes a rude, dirty fellow with a patch over one eye and a
</p>
<p>most peculiar bearish gait, dressed in a tarred coat, with a
</p>
<p>wool shawl about his neck, followed by a shrewd- visaged little
</p>
<p>gentleman in a plain cloth suit, but of very good substance,
</p>
<p>he looking just as trim and well-mannered as t'other was
</p>
<p>uncouth and rude.
</p>
<p>"Well, here am I," says Evans (whom we knew at once
</p>
<p>for the master mariner), flinging his hat and shawl in a

<p>STRANGE COMPANY AT GREENWICH. 33
</p>
<p>Mr. Hopkins, the merchant I spoke on yesterday ; and who
</p>
<p>be these?" turning about to fix us with his one blue eye.
</p>
<p>" Two gentlemen related to Mrs. Godwin, and very anx-
</p>
<p>ious for her return," replies the Don.
</p>
<p>" Then we being met friends all, let's have up a bottle and
</p>
<p>heave off on this here business without more ado," says
</p>
<p>Evans ; and with that he seats himself in the Don's chair,
</p>
<p>pokes up the fire with his boots, and spits on the hearth.
</p>
<p>The Don graciously places a chair for Mr. Hopkins,
</p>
<p>rings the bell, and seats himself. Then after a few civilities
</p>
<p>while the bottle was being opened and our glasses filled, he
</p>
<p>says :
</p>
<p>" You have doubtless heard from Robert Evans the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of our coming hither, Mr. Hopkins."
</p>
<p>"Roughly," replies Mr. Hopkins, with a dry little cough.
</p>
<p>" But I should be glad to have the particulars from you, that
</p>
<p>I may judge more clearly of my responsibilities in this
</p>
<p>undertaking."
</p>
<p>" Oh, Lord ! " exclaims Evans, in disgust. " Here give

<p>us a pipe of tobacco if we're to warp out half a day ere we

</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez puts us in the way of robbing with an easy conscience.
</p>
<p>PROMISING to make his story as short as he possibly
</p>
<p>could, Don Sanchez began :
</p>
<p>" On the coming of our present king to his throne, Sir
</p>
<p>Richard Godwin was recalled from Italy, whither he had
</p>
<p>been sent as embassador by the Protector. He sailed from
</p>
<p>Livorno with his wife and his daughter Judith, a child of
</p>
<p>nine years old at that time, in the Seahawk. "
</p>
<p>"I remember her," says Evans, "as stout a ship as ever
</p>
<p>was put to sea."
</p>
<p>" On the second night of her voyage the Seahawk became
</p>
<p>parted from her convoy, and the next day she was pursued
</p>
<p>and overtaken by a pair of Barbary pirates, to whom she
</p>
<p>gave battle."
</p>
<p>" Aye, and I'd have done the same," cries Evans, " though
</p>
<p>they had been a score."
</p>
<p>" After a long and bloody fight," continues Don Sanchez,
</p>
<p>" the corsairs succeeded in boarding the Seahawk and over-
</p>
<p>coming the remnant of her company."
</p>
<p>" Poor hearts ! would I had been there to help 'em," says
</p>
<p>Evans.
</p>
<p>" Exasperated by the obstinate resistance of these English
</p>
<p>and their own losses, the pirates would grant no mercy, but
</p>
<p>tying the living to the dead they cast all overboard save Mrs.
</p>
<p>Godwin and her daughter. Her lot was even worse ; for her

<p>HISTORY OF MRS. GODWIN. 35
</p>
<p>wounded husband, Sir Richard, was snatched from her arms
</p>
<p>and flung into the sea before her eyes, and he sank crying
</p>
<p>farewell to her."
</p>
<p>" These Turks have no hearts in their bellies, you must
</p>
<p>understand," explains Evans. "And nought but venom in
</p>
<p>their veins."
</p>
<p>"The Seahawk was taken to Alger, and there Mrs.
</p>
<p>Godwin and her daughter were sold for slaves in the public
</p>
<p>market-place."
</p>
<p>" I have seen 'em sold by the score there," says Evans,
</p>
<p>" and fetch but an onion a head."
</p>
<p>" By good fortune the mother and daughter were bought by
</p>
<p>Sidi ben Moula, a rich old merchant who was smitten by the
</p>
<p>pretty, delicate looks of Judith, whom he thenceforth treated
</p>
<p>as if she had been his own child. In this condition they
</p>
<p>lived with greater happiness than falls to the lot of most
</p>
<p>slaves, until the beginning of last year, when Sidi died, and
</p>
<p>his possessions fell to his brother, Bare ben Moula. Then
</p>
<p>Mrs. Godwin appeals to Bare for her liberty and to be
</p>
<p>sent home to her country, saying that what price (in reason)
</p>
<p>he chooses to set upon their heads she will pay from her
</p>
<p>estate in England a thing which she had proposed before
</p>
<p>to Sidi, but he would not hear of it because of his love for
</p>
<p>Judith and his needing no greater fortune than he had.
</p>
<p>But this Bare, though he would be very well content, being
</p>
<p>also an old man, to have his household managed by Mrs.
</p>
<p>Godwin and to adopt Judith as his child, being of a more
</p>
<p>avaricious turn than his brother, at length consents to it, on
</p>
<p>condition that her ransoms be paid before she quits Barbary.
</p>
<p>And so, casting about how this may be done, Mrs. Godwin

</p>
<p>to Palma in the Baleares, and to him she entrusts two let-
</p>
<p>ters." Here Don Sanchez pulls two folded sheets of vellum
</p>
<p>from his pocket, and presenting one to me, he says:
</p>
<p>" Mayhap you recognise this hand, Mr. Knight."
</p>
<p>And I, seeing the signature Elizabeth Godwin, answers
</p>
<p>quickly enough : " Aye, 'tis my dear cousin Bess, her own
</p>
<p>hand."
</p>
<p>" This," says the Don, handing the other to Evans, " you
</p>
<p>may understand."
</p>
<p>" I can make out 'tis writ in the Moorish style," says
</p>
<p>Evans, " but the meaning of it I know not, for I can't tell
</p>
<p>great A from a bull's foot though it be in printed English."
</p>
<p>" Tis an undertaking on the part of Bare ben Moula,"
</p>
<p>says the Don, " to deliver up at Dellys in Barbary the per-
</p>
<p>sons of Mrs. Godwin and her daughter against the payment
</p>
<p>of five thousand gold ducats within one year. The other
</p>
<p>writing tells its own story."
</p>
<p>Mr. Hopkins took the first sheet from me and read it
</p>
<p>aloud. It was addressed to Mr. Richard Godwin, Hurst
</p>
<p>Court, Chislehurst in Kent, and after giving such particulars
</p>
<p>of her past as we had already heard from Don Sanchez, she
</p>
<p>writes thus : " And now, my dear nephew, as I doubt not
</p>
<p>you (as the nearest of my kindred to my dear husband after
</p>
<p>us two poor relicts) have taken possession of his estate in
</p>
<p>the belief we were all lost in our voyage from Italy, I do
</p>
<p>pray you for the love of God and of mercy to deliver us
</p>
<p>from our bondage by sending hither a ship with the money
</p>
<p>for our ransoms forthwith, and be assured by this that I shall

<p>am your most hopeful, trusting, and loving aunt, Elizabeth
</p>
<p>Godwin."
</p>
<p>" Very well, sir," says Mr. Hopkins, returning the letter.
</p>
<p>"You have been to Chislehurst."
</p>
<p>" I have," answers the Don, " and there I find the estate
</p>
<p>in the hands of a most curious Puritanical steward, whose
</p>
<p>honesty is rather in the letter than the spirit. For though
</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that not one penny's value of the
</p>
<p>estate has been misemployed since it has been in his hands,
</p>
<p>yet will he give nothing no, not a maravedi to the redemp-
</p>
<p>tion of his mistress, saying that the letter is addressed to
</p>
<p>Richard Godwin and not to him, etc., and that he hath no
</p>
<p>power to pay out monies for this purpose, even though he
</p>
<p>believed the facts I have laid before him which for his
</p>
<p>own ends doubtless he fains to misdoubt."
</p>
<p>" As a trader, sir," says Mr. Hopkins, " I cannot blame
</p>
<p>his conduct in that respect. For should the venture fall
</p>
<p>through, the next heir might call upon him to repay out of
</p>
<p>his own pocket all that he had put into this enterprise. But
</p>
<p>this Mr. Richard Godwin, what of him? "
</p>
<p>" He is nowhere to be found. The only relatives I have
</p>
<p>been able to discover are these two gentlemen."

<p>our soiled clothes, " are not, I venture to think, in a position
</p>
<p>to pay their cousin's ransom."
</p>
<p>"Alas, no, sir," says Jack. "We are but two poor shop-
</p>
<p>keepers of London undone by the great fire."
</p>
<p>" Well now, sir," says Mr. Hopkins, fetching an inkpot,

<p>conclude that you wish me to adventure upon the redemp-
</p>
<p>tion of these two ladies in Barbary, upon the hazard of
</p>
<p>being repaid by Mrs. Godwin when she recovers her estate."
</p>
<p>And the Don making him a reverence, he continues, " We
</p>
<p>must first learn the extent of our liabilities. What sum is
</p>
<p>to be paid to Bare ben Moula? "
</p>
<p>" Five thousand gold ducats about two thousand pounds
</p>
<p>English."
</p>
<p>"Two thousand," says Mr. Hopkins, writing. "Then,
</p>
<p>Robert Evans, what charge is yours for fetching the ladies
</p>
<p>fromDellys?"
</p>
<p>" Master Hopkins, I have said fifteen hundred pounds,"
</p>
<p>says he, " and I won't go from my word though all laugh at
</p>
<p>me for a madman."
</p>
<p>" That seems a great deal of money," says Mr. Hop-
</p>
<p>kins.
</p>
<p>" Well, if you think fifteen hundred pounds too much for
</p>
<p>my carcase and a ship of twenty men, you can go seek a
</p>
<p>cheaper market elsewhere."
</p>
<p>" You think there is very small likelihood of coming back
</p>
<p>alive?"
</p>
<p>" Why, comrade, 'tis as if you should go into a den of
</p>
<p>lions and hope to get out whole ; for though I have the
</p>
<p>Duke's pass, these Moors are no fitter to be trusted than a
</p>
<p>sackful of serpents. 'Tis ten to one our ship be taken,
</p>
<p>and we fools all sold into slavery."
</p>
<p>" Ten to one," says Mr. Hopkins ; " that is to say, you
</p>
<p>would make this voyage for the tenth part of what you ask
</p>
<p>were you sure of returning safe."

<p>"I would go as far anywhere outside the straits for an

<p>hundred pounds with a lighter heart."
</p>
<p>HOPKINS AND EVANS RELISH LITTLE THE VENTURE. 39
</p>
<p>Mr. Hopkins nods his head, and setting down some
</p>
<p>figures on his paper, says :
</p>
<p>" The bare outlay in hard money amounts to thirty-five
</p>
<p>hundred pounds. Reckoning the risk at Robert Evans' own
</p>
<p>valuation (which I take to be a very low one), I must see
</p>
<p>reasonable prospect of winning thirty-five thousand pounds
</p>
<p>by my hazard."
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Godwin's estate I know to be worth double that
</p>
<p>amount."
</p>
<p>"But who will promise me that return?" asks Mr.
</p>
<p>Hopkins. " Not you ? " (The Don shook his head.) " Not
</p>
<p>you?" (turning to us, with the same result). "Not Mrs.
</p>
<p>Godwin, for we have no means of communicating with her.
</p>
<p>Not the steward you have shown me that. Who then
</p>
<p>remains but this Richard Godwin who cannot be found?
</p>
<p>If," adds he, getting up from his seat, " you can find Richard
</p>
<p>Godwin, put him in possession of the estate, and obtain
</p>
<p>from him a reasonable promise that this sum shall be paid
</p>
<p>on the return of Mrs. Godwin, I may feel disposed to con-
</p>
<p>sider your proposal more seriously. But till then I can do
</p>
<p>nothing."
</p>
<p>" Likewise, masters all," says Evans, fetching his hat and
</p>
<p>shawl from the corner, " I can't wait for a blue moon ; and if
</p>
<p>so be we don't sign articles in a week, I'm off of my bar-
</p>
<p>gain, and mighty glad to get out of it so cheap."
</p>
<p>"You see," says Don Sanchez, when they were gone out
</p>
<p>of the room, " how impossible it is that Mrs. Godwin and
</p>
<p>her daughter shall be redeemed from captivity. To-morrow
</p>
<p>I shall show you what kind of a fellow the steward is that
</p>
<p>he should have the handling of this fortune rather than we."

</p>
<p>Then presently, with an indifferent, careless air, as if 'twas
</p>
<p>4O A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>nought, he gives us a purse and bids us go out in the town
</p>
<p>to furnish ourselves with what disguise was necessary to our
</p>
<p>purpose. Therewith Dawson gets him some seaman's old
</p>
<p>clothes at a Jew's, and I a very neat, presentable suit of
</p>
<p>cloth, etc., and the rest of the money we take back to Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez without taking so much as a penny for our other
</p>
<p>uses ; but he, doing all things very magnificent, would have
</p>
<p>none of it, but bade us keep it against our other necessities.
</p>
<p>And now having his money in our pockets, we felt 'twould
</p>
<p>be more dishonest to go back from this business than to go
</p>
<p>forward with it, lead us whither it might.
</p>
<p>Next morning off we go betimes, Jack more like Robert
</p>
<p>Evans than his mother's son, and I a most seeming substan-
</p>
<p>tial man (so that the very stable lad took off his hat to
</p>
<p>me), and on very good horses a long ride to Chislehurst.
</p>
<p>And there coming to a monstrous fine park, Don Sanchez
</p>
<p>stayed us before the gates, and bidding us look up a broad
</p>
<p>avenue of great oaks to a most surprising brave house, he
</p>
<p>told us this was Hurst Court, and we might have it for our
</p>
<p>own within a year if we were so minded.
</p>
<p>Hence, at no great distance we reach a square plain
</p>
<p>house, the windows all barred with stout iron, and the most
</p>
<p>like a prison I did ever see. Here Don Sanchez ringing a
</p>
<p>bell, a little grating in the door is opened, and after some
</p>
<p>parley we are admitted by a sturdy fellow carrying a cudgel
</p>
<p>in his hand. So we into a cold room, with not a spark
</p>
<p>of fire on the hearth but a few ashes, no hangings to the
</p>
<p>windows, nor any ornament or comfort at all, but only a
</p>
<p>table and half a dozen wooden stools, and a number of
</p>
<p>shelves against the wall full of account books and papers

</p>
<p>protected by a grating of stout wire secured with sundry
</p>
<p>WE COME TO CHISLEHURST. 41
</p>
<p>padlocks. And here, behind a tableful of papers, sat our
</p>
<p>steward, Simon Stout-in-faith, a most withered, lean old
</p>
<p>man, clothed all in leather, wearing no wig but his own rusty
</p>
<p>grey hair falling lank on his shoulders, with a sour face of a
</p>
<p>very jaundiced complexion, and pale eyes that seemed to
</p>
<p>swim in a yellowish rheum, which he was for ever a-mopping
</p>
<p>with a rag.
</p>
<p>"I am come, Mr. Steward," says Don Sanchez, "to con-
</p>
<p>clude the business we were upon last week."
</p>
<p>"Aye," cries Dawson, for all the world in the manner of
</p>
<p>Evans, " but ere we get to this dry matter let's have a bottle
</p>
<p>to ease the way, for this riding of horseback has parched up
</p>
<p>my vitals confoundedly."
</p>
<p>" If thou art athirst," says Simon, " Peter shall fetch thee
</p>
<p>a jug of water from the well ; but other liquor have we none
</p>
<p>in this house."
</p>
<p>" Let Peter drown in your well," says Dawson, with an
</p>
<p>oath ; " I'll have none of it. Let's get this matter done and
</p>
<p>away, for I'd as lief sit in a leaky hold as in this here place
</p>
<p>for comfort."
</p>
<p>" Here," says Don Sanchez, " is a master mariner who is
</p>
<p>prepared to risk his life, and here a merchant adventurer of
</p>
<p>London who will hazard his money, to redeem your mistress
</p>
<p>and her daughter from slavery."
</p>
<p>" Praise the Lord, Peter," says the steward. Whereupon
</p>
<p>the sturdy fellow with the cudgel fell upon his knees, as like-
</p>
<p>wise did Simon, and both in a snuffling voice render thanks
</p>
<p>to Heaven in words which I do not think it proper to write
</p>
<p>here. Then, being done, they get up, and the steward, hav-
</p>
<p>ing dried his eyes, says :

</p>
<p>"So far our prayers have been answered. Put me in
</p>
<p>42 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>mind, friend Peter, that to-night we pray these worthy men
</p>
<p>prosper in their design."
</p>
<p>" If they succeed," says Don Sanchez, " it will cost your
</p>
<p>mistress five-and-thirty thousand pounds."
</p>
<p>The steward clutched at the table as if at the fortune
</p>
<p>about to turn from him ; his jaw fell, and he stared at Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez in bewilderment, then getting the face to speak, he
</p>
<p>gasps out, " Thirty-five thousand pounds ! " and still in a
</p>
<p>maze asks : "Art thou in thy right senses, friend? "
</p>
<p>The Don hunches his shoulders and turns tome. Where-
</p>
<p>upon I lay forth in pretty much the same words as Mr. Hop-
</p>
<p>kins used, the risk of the venture, etc., to all which this
</p>
<p>Simon listened with starting eyes and gaping mouth.
</p>
<p>"Thirty-five thousand pounds!" he says again; "why,
</p>
<p>friend, 'tis half of all I have made of the estate by a life of
</p>
<p>thrift and care and earnest seeking."
</p>
<p>" 'Tis in your power, Simon," says Don Sanchez, " to
</p>
<p>spare your mistress this terrible charge, for which your fine
</p>
<p>park must be felled, your farms cut up, and your economies
</p>
<p>be scattered. The master here will fetch your mistress
</p>
<p>home for fifteen hundred pounds."
</p>
<p>"Why, even that is an extortion."
</p>
<p>" Nay," says Jack, " if you think fifteen hundred pounds
</p>
<p>too much for my carcase and a ship of twenty men, you
</p>
<p>may seek a cheaper market and welcome, for I've no
</p>
<p>stomach to risk my life and property for less."
</p>
<p>" To the fifteen hundred pounds you must add the ransom
</p>
<p>of two thousand pounds. Thus Mrs. Godwin and her
</p>
<p>daughter may be redeemed for thirty-five hundred pounds
</p>
<p>to her saving of thirty-one thousand five hundred pounds,"

<p>says the Don.
</p>
<p>SIMON AS ROGUISH AS ANY. 43
</p>
<p>And here Dawson and I were secretly struck by his
</p>
<p>honesty in not seeking to affright the steward from an
</p>
<p>honest course, but rather tempting him to it by playing upon
</p>
<p>his parsimony and avarice.
</p>
<p>"Three thousand five hundred," says Simon, putting it
</p>
<p>down in writing, that he might the better realise his position.
</p>
<p>" But you say, friend merchant, that the risk is as ten to one
</p>
<p>against seeing thy money again."
</p>
<p>" I will run the risk for thirty-one thousand pounds, and
</p>
<p>no less," says I.
</p>
<p>" But if it may be done for a tenth part, how then? "
</p>
<p>" Why, 'tis your risk, sir, and not mine," says I.
</p>
<p>" Yea, yea, my risk. And you tell me, friend sailor, that
</p>
<p>you stand in danger of being plundered by these infidels."
</p>
<p>" Aye, more like than not."
</p>
<p>" Why, then we may count half the estate gone ; and the
</p>
<p>peril is to be run again, and thus all cast away for nought."
</p>
<p>In this manner did Simon halt betwixt two ways like one
</p>
<p>distracted, but only he did mingle a mass of sacred words
</p>
<p>with his arguments which seemed to me nought but
</p>
<p>profanity, his sole concern being the gain of money. Then
</p>
<p>he falls to the old excuses Don Sanchez had told us of,
</p>
<p>saying he had no money of his own, and offering to show his
</p>
<p>books that we might see he had taken not one penny beyond
</p>
<p>his bare expenses from the estate, save his yearly wage, and
</p>
<p>that no more than Sir Richard had given him in his lifetime.
</p>
<p>And on Don Sanchez showing Mrs. Godwin's letter as a
</p>
<p>fitting authority to draw out this money for her use, he first
</p>
<p>feigns to doubt her hand, and then says he : " If an acci-
</p>
<p>dent befalls these two women ere they return to justify

</p>
<p>me, how shall I answer to the next heir for this outlay?
</p>
<p>44 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>Verily " (clasping his hands) " I am as one standing in
</p>
<p>darkness, and I dare not move until I am better enlightened ;
</p>
<p>so prithee, friend, give me' time to commune with my con-
</p>
<p>science."
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez hunches up his shoulders and turns to us.
</p>
<p>"Why, look here, Master," says Dawson. " I can't see as
</p>
<p>you need much enlightenment to answer yes or no to a fair
</p>
<p>offer, and as for me, I'm not going to hang in a hedge for a
</p>
<p>blue moon. So if you won't clap hands on the bargain with-
</p>
<p>out more ado, I throw this business overboard and shall
</p>
<p>count I've done the best day's work of my life in getting out
</p>
<p>of the affair."
</p>
<p>Then I made as if I would willingly draw out of my share
</p>
<p>in the project.
</p>
<p>" My friends," says Simon, " there can be scarce any hope
</p>
<p>at all if thou wilt not hazard thy money for such a prodi-
</p>
<p>gious advantage." Then turning to Peter as his last hope,
</p>
<p>he asks in despair, " What shall we do, my brother? "
</p>
<p>"We can keep on a-praying, friend Simon," replies Peter,
</p>
<p>in a snivelling voice.
</p>
<p>"A blessed thought!" exclaims the steward in glee.
</p>
<p>" Surely that is more righteous than to lay faith in our own
</p>
<p>vain effort. So do thou, friend " (turning to me), "put thy
</p>
<p>money to this use, for I will none."
</p>
<p>"I cannot do that, sir," says I, "without an assurance that
</p>
<p>Mrs. Godwin's estate will bear this charge."
</p>
<p>With wondrous alacrity Simon fetches a book with a plan
</p>
<p>of the estate, whereby he showed us that not a holding on
</p>
<p>the estate was untenanted, not a single tenant in arrear with
</p>
<p>his rent, and that the value of the property with all deduc-

</p>
<p>tions made was sixty-five thousand pounds.
</p>
<p>COUNT OURSELVES MIGHTY HONEST. 4$
</p>
<p>"Very good sir," says I. "Now you must give me a
</p>
<p>written note, stating what you have shown, with your
</p>
<p>sanction to my making this venture on Mrs. Godwin's
</p>
<p>behalf, that I may justify my claim hereafter."
</p>
<p>But this Simon stoutly refused to do, saying his con-
</p>
<p>science would not allow him to sign any bond (clearly with
</p>
<p>the hope that he might in the end shuffle out of paying
</p>
<p>anything at all) , until Don Sanchez, losing patience, declared
</p>
<p>he would certainly hunt all London through to find that Mr.
</p>
<p>Richard Godwin, who was the next of kin, hinting that he
</p>
<p>would certainly give us such sanction as we required if only
</p>
<p>to prove his right to the succession should our venture fail.
</p>
<p>This put the steward to a new taking ; but the Don hold-
</p>
<p>ing firm, he at length agreed to give us this note, upon Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez writing another affirming that he had seen Mrs.
</p>
<p>Godwin and her daughter in Barbary, and was going forth to
</p>
<p>fetch them, that should Mr. Richard Godwin come to claim
</p>
<p>the estate he might be justly put off.
</p>
<p>And so this business ended to our great satisfaction, we
</p>
<p>saying to ourselves that we had done all that man could to
</p>
<p>redeem the captives, and that it would be no harm at all to
</p>
<p>put a cheat upon the miserly steward. Whether we were
</p>
<p>any way more honest than he in shaping our conduct accord-
</p>
<p>ing to our inclinations is a question which troubled us then

<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>Moll is cast to play the part of a fine lady ; doubtful promise for
</p>
<p>this undertaking.
</p>
<p>ON our way back to Greenwich we stayed at an inn by
</p>
<p>the road to refresh ourselves, and there, having a snug par-
</p>
<p>lour to ourselves, and being seated about a fine cheese with
</p>
<p>each a full measure of ale, Don Sanchez asks us if we are
</p>
<p>satisfied with our undertaking.
</p>
<p>"Aye, that we are," replies Dawson, mightily pleased as
</p>
<p>usual to be a-feasting. " We desire nothing better than to
</p>
<p>serve your honour faithfully in all ways, and are ready to put
</p>
<p>our hands to any bond you may choose to draw up."
</p>
<p>" Can you show me the man," asks the Don, lifting his
</p>
<p>eyebrows contemptuously, " who ever kept a treaty he was
</p>
<p>minded to break ? Men are honest enough when nought's
</p>
<p>to be gained by breaking faith. Are you both agreed to
</p>
<p>this course?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, Senor," says I, "and my only compunction now is
</p>
<p>that I can do so little to forward this business."
</p>
<p>" Why, so far as I can see into it," says Dawson, " one of
</p>
<p>us must be cast for old Mrs. Godwin, if Moll is to be her
</p>
<p>daughter, and you're fitter to play the part than I, for I
</p>
<p>take it this old gentlewoman should be of a more delicate,
</p>
<p>sickly composition than mine."
</p>
<p>" We will suppose that Mrs. Godwin is dead," says the
</p>
<p>Don, gravely.

</p>
<p>THIEVING NOT SO EASY AS IT SEEMS. 47
</p>
<p>" Aye, to be sure ; that simplifies the thing mightily. But
</p>
<p>pray, Senor, what parts are we to play?"
</p>
<p>" The parts you have played to-day. You go with me to
</p>
<p>fetch Judith Godwin from Barbary."
</p>
<p>"This hangs together and ought to play well ; eh, Kit? "
</p>
<p>I asked Don Sanchez how long, fti the ordinary course of
</p>
<p>things an expedition of this kind would take.
</p>
<p>" That depends upon accidents of many kinds," answers
</p>
<p>he. "We may very well stretch it out best part of a year."
</p>
<p>" A year," says Jack, scratching his ear ruefully, for I
</p>
<p>believe he had counted upon coming to live like a lord in a
</p>
<p>few weeks. " And what on earth are we to do in the mean-
</p>
<p>while?"
</p>
<p>" Teach Moll," answers the Don.
</p>
<p>" She can read anything print or scrip," says Jack, proudly,
</p>
<p>" and write her own name."
</p>
<p>"Judith Godwin," says the Don, reflectively, " lived two
</p>
<p>years in Italy. She would certainly remember some words
</p>
<p>of Italian. Consider this : it is not sufficient merely to
</p>
<p>obtain possession of the Godwin estate ; it must be held
</p>
<p>against the jealous opposition of that shrewd steward and
</p>
<p>of the presumptive heir, Mr. Richard Godwin, who may
</p>
<p>come forward at any time."
</p>
<p>" You're in the right, Senor. Well, there's Kit knows the
</p>
<p>language and can teach her a smattering of the Italian, I
</p>
<p>warrant, in no time."
</p>
<p>" Judith would probably know something of music," pur-
</p>
<p>sues the Don.
</p>
<p>" Why, Moll can play Kit's fiddle as well as he."
</p>
<p>" But, above all," continues the Don, as taking no heed

<p>of this tribute to Moll's abilities, " Judith Godwin must be

</p>
<p>able to read and write the Moorish character and speak the
</p>
<p>tongue readily, answer aptly as to their ways and habits, and
</p>
<p>to do these things beyond suspect. Moll must live with
</p>
<p>these people for some months."
</p>
<p>" God have mercy on us ! " cries Jack. " Your honour is
</p>
<p>not for taking us to Barbary."
</p>
<p>" No," answers the Don, dryly, passing his long ringers
</p>
<p>with some significance over the many seams in his long
</p>
<p>face, " but we must go where the Moors are to be found, on
</p>
<p>the hither side of the straits."
</p>
<p>" Well," says Dawson, " all's as one whither we go in
</p>

<p>nothing more for our Moll to learn, I suppose, Senor."
</p>
<p>" It will not be amiss to teach her the manners of a lady,"
</p>
<p>replies the Don, rising and knitting his brows together
</p>
<p>unpleasantly, "and especially to keep her feet under her
</p>
<p>chair at table."
</p>
<p>With this he rings the bell for our reckoning, and so ends
</p>
<p>our discussion, neither Dawson nor I having a word to say
</p>
<p>in answer to this last hit, which .showed us pretty plainly
</p>
<p>that in reaching round with her long leg for our shins, Moll
</p>
<p>had caught the Don's shanks a kick that night she was seized
</p>
<p>with a cough.
</p>
<p>So to horse again and a long jog back to Greenwich,
</p>
<p>where Dawson and I would fain have rested the night
</p>
<p>(being unused to the saddle and very raw with our journey),
</p>
<p>but the Don would not for prudence, and therefore, after
</p>
<p>changing our clothes, we make a shift to mount once more,
</p>
<p>and thence another long horrid jolt to Edmonton very
</p>
<p>painfully.

<p>and pitch dark, we were greatly surprised that we could
</p>
<p>make no one hear to take our horses, and further, having
</p>
<p>turned the brutes into the stable ourselves, to find never
</p>
<p>a soul in the common room or parlour, so that the place
</p>
<p>seemed quite forsaken. But hearing a loud guffaw of
</p>
<p>laughter from below, we go downstairs to the kitchen,
</p>
<p>which we could scarce enter for the crowd in the doorway.
</p>
<p>And here all darkness, save for a sheet hung at the further
</p>
<p>end, and lit from behind, on which a kind of phantasmagory
</p>
<p>play of Jack and the Giant was being acted by shadow
</p>
<p>characters cut out of paper, the performer being hid by
</p>
<p>a board that served as a stage for the puppets. And who
</p>
<p>should this performer be but our Moll, as we knew by her
</p>
<p>voice, and most admirably she did it, setting all in a roar
</p>
<p>one minute with some merry joke, and enchanting 'em the
</p>
<p>next with a pretty song for the maid in distress.
</p>
<p>We learnt afterwards that Moll, who could never rest
</p>
<p>still two minutes together, but must for ever be a- doing some-
</p>
<p>thing new, had cut out her images and devised the show
</p>
<p>to entertain the servants in the kitchen, and that the guests
</p>
<p>above hearing their merriment had come down in time to
</p>
<p>get the fag end, which pleased them so vastly that they
</p>
<p>would have her play it all over again.
</p>
<p>"This may undo us," says Don Sanchez, in a low voice
</p>
<p>of displeasure, drawing us away. " Here are a dozen visi-
</p>
<p>tors who will presently be examining Moll as a marvel.
</p>
<p>Who can say but that one of them may know her again
</p>
<p>hereafter to our confusion ? We must be seen together no
</p>
<p>more than is necessary, until we are out of this country. I
</p>
<p>shall leave here in the morning, and you will meet me next
</p>
<p>at the Turk, in Gracious Street, to-morrow afternoon."

<p>Therewith he goes up to his room, leaving us to shift for
</p>
<p>ourselves; and we into the parlour to warm our feet at
</p>
<p>the fire till we may be served with some victuals, both very
</p>
<p>silent and surly, being still sore, and as tired as any dogs
</p>
<p>with our day's jolting.
</p>
<p>While we are in this mood, Moll, having finished her play,
</p>
<p>comes to us in amazing high spirits, and all aglow with
</p>
<p>pleasure shows us a handful of silver given her by the
</p>
<p>gentry ; then, pulling up a chair betwixt us, she asks us a
</p>
<p>dozen questions of a string as to where we have been, what
</p>
<p>we have done, etc., since we left her. Getting no answer,
</p>
<p>she presently stops, looks first at one, then at the other, and
</p>
<p>bursting into a fit of laughter, cries : " Why, what ails you
</p>
<p>both to be so grumpy?"
</p>
<p>" In the first place, Moll," says Jack, " I'll have you to
</p>
<p>know that I am your father, and will not be spoken to save
</p>
<p>with becoming respect."
</p>
<p>" Why, I did but ask you where you have been."
</p>
<p>" Children of your age should not ask questions, but do
</p>
<p>as they're bid, and there's an end of it."
</p>
<p>" La, I'm not to ask any questions. Is there nothing else
</p>
<p>I am not to do?"
</p>
<p>" Yes ; I'll not have you playing of Galimaufray to cook
</p>
<p>wenches and such stuff. I'll have you behave with more
</p>
<p>decency. Take your feet off the hearth, and put 'em under

<p>your chair. Let me have no more of these galanty-shows.

<p>Why, 'twill be said I cannot give you a basin of porridge,

</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.
</p>
<p>Of our journey through France to a very horrid pass in the Pyraneans.
</p>
<p>SKIPPING over many unimportant particulars of our leav-
</p>
<p>ing Edmonton, of our rinding Don Sanchez at the Turk
</p>
<p>in Gracious Street, of our going thence (the next day) to
</p>
<p>Gravesend, of our preparation there for voyage, I come now
</p>
<p>to our embarking, the loth March, in the Rose, for Bor-
</p>
<p>deaux in France. Nor shall I dwell long on that journey,
</p>
<p>neither, which was exceedingly long and painful, by reason
</p>
<p>of our nearing the equinoctials, which dashed us from our
</p>
<p>course to that degree that it was the 26th before we reached
</p>
<p>our port and cast anchor in still water. And all those days
</p>
<p>we were prostrated with sickness, and especially Jack Daw-
</p>
<p>son, because of his full habit, so that he declared he would
</p>
<p>rather ride a-horseback to the end of the earth than go
</p>
<p>another mile on sea.
</p>
<p>We stayed in Bordeaux, which is a noble town, but dirty,
</p>
<p>four days to refresh ourselves, and here the Don lodged us
</p>
<p>in a fine inn and fed us on the best; and also he made us
</p>
<p>buy new clothes and linen (which we sadly needed after
</p>
<p>the pickle we had lain in a fortnight) and cast away our
</p>
<p>old; but no more than was necessary, saying 'twould be
</p>
<p>better to furnish ourselves with fresh linen as we needed it,
</p>
<p>than carry baggage, etc. "And let all you buy be good
</p>
<p>goods," says he, "for in this country a man is valued at

</p>
<p>what he seems, and the innkeepers do go in such fear of
</p>
<p>their seigneurs that they will charge him less for entertain-
</p>
<p>ment than if he were a mean fellow who could ill afford to
</p>
<p>pay."
</p>
<p>So not to displease him we dressed ourselves in the
</p>
<p>French fashion, more richly than ever we had been clad in
</p>
<p>our lives, and especially Moll did profit by this occasion
</p>
<p>to furnish herself like any duchess; so that Dawson and I
</p>
<p>drew lots to decide which of us should present the bill to
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez, thinking he would certainly take exception
</p>
<p>to our extravagance; but he did not so much as raise his
</p>
<p>eyebrows at the total, but paid it without ever a glance at
</p>
<p>the items. Nay, when Moll presents herself in her new
</p>
<p>equipment, he makes her a low reverence and pays her a
</p>
<p>most handsome compliment, but in his serious humour and
</p>
<p>without a smile. He himself wore a new suit all of black,
</p>
<p>not so fine as ours, but very noble and becoming, by reason
</p>
<p>of his easy, graceful manner and his majestic, high carriage.
</p>
<p>On the last day of March we set forth for Toulouse. At
</p>
<p>our starting Don Sanchez bade Moll ride by his side, and
</p>
<p>so we, not being bid, fell behind; and, feeling awkward
</p>
<p>in our new clothes, we might very well have been taken for
</p>
<p>their servants, or a pair of ill-bred friends at the best, for
</p>
<p>our Moll carried herself not a whit less magnificent than
</p>
<p>the Don, to the admiration of all who looked at her.
</p>
<p>To see these grand airs of hers charmed Jack Dawson.
</p>
<p>"You see, Kit," whispers he, "what an apt scholar the
</p>
<p>minx is, and what an obedient, dutiful, good girl. One
</p>
<p>word from me is as good as six months' schooling, for all
</p>
<p>this comes of that lecture I gave her the last night we were

<p>at Edmonton."
</p>
<p>54 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>I would not deny him the satisfaction of this belief, but
</p>
<p>I felt pretty sure that had she been riding betwixt us in
</p>
<p>her old gown, instead of beside the Don as his daughter,
</p>
<p>all her father's preaching would not have stayed her from
</p>
<p>behaving herself like an orange wench.
</p>
<p>We journey by easy stages ten days through Toulouse,
</p>
<p>on the road to Perpignan, and being favoured with remark-
</p>
<p>ably fine weather, a blue sky, and a bright sun above us, and
</p>
<p>at every turn something strange or beautiful to admire, no
</p>
<p>pleasure jaunt in the world could have been more delight-
</p>
<p>ful. At every inn (which here they call hotels) we found
</p>
<p>good beds, good food, excellent wine, and were treated
</p>
<p>like princes, so that Dawson and I would gladly have given
</p>
<p>up our promise of a fortune to have lived in this manner
</p>
<p>to the end of our days. But Don Sanchez professed to
</p>
<p>hold all on this side of the Pyrenese Mountains in great
</p>
<p>contempt, saying these hotels were as nothing to the Span-
</p>
<p>ish posadas, that the people here would rob you if they
</p>
<p>dared, whereas, on t'other side, not a Spaniard would take
</p>
<p>so much as the hair of your horse's tail, though he were at
</p>
<p>the last extremity, that the food was not fit for aught but a
</p>
<p>Frenchman, and so forth. And our Moll, catching this
</p>
<p>humour, did also turn up her nose at everything she was
</p>
<p>offered, and would send away a bottle of wine from the
</p>
<p>table because 'twas not ripe enough, though but a few
</p>
<p>weeks before she had been drinking penny ale with a relish,
</p>
<p>and that as sour as verjuice. And, indeed, she did carry
</p>
<p>it mighty high and artificial, wherever respect and humility
</p>
<p>were to be commanded. But it was pretty to see how she
</p>
<p>would unbend and become her natural self where her heart

</p>
<p>was touched by some tender sentiment. How she would
</p>
<p>COME INTO THE PYRENESE. 55
</p>
<p>empty her pockets to give to any one with a piteous tale,
</p>
<p>how she would get from her horse to pluck wild-flowers by
</p>
<p>the roadside, and how, one day, overtaking a poor woman
</p>
<p>carrying a child painfully on her back, she must have the
</p>
<p>little one up on her lap and carry it till we reached the
</p>
<p>hamlet where the woman lived, etc. On the fifteenth day
</p>
<p>we stayed at St. Denys, and going thence the next morning,
</p>
<p>had travelled but a couple of hours when we were caught
</p>
<p>in a violent storm of hailstones as big as peas, that was
</p>
<p>swept with incredible force by a wind rushing through a
</p>
<p>deep ravine in the mountains, so that 'twas as much as we
</p>
<p>could make headway through it and gain a village which
</p>
<p>lay but a little distance from us. And here we were forced
</p>
<p>to stay all day by another storm of rain, that followed the
</p>
<p>hail and continued till nightfall. Many others besides our-
</p>
<p>selves were compelled to seek refuge at our inn, and
</p>
<p>amongst them a company of Spanish muleteers, for it seems
</p>
<p>we were come to a pass leading through the mountains into
</p>
<p>Spain. These were the first Spaniards we had yet seen
</p>
<p>(save the Don), and for all we had heard to their credit,
</p>
<p>we could not admire them greatly, being a low-browed,
</p>
<p>coarse-featured, ragged crew, and more picturesque than
</p>
<p>cleanly, besides stinking intolerably of garlic. By night-
</p>
<p>fall there was more company than the inn could accommo-
</p>
<p>date; nevertheless, in respect to our quality, we were given
</p>
<p>the best rooms in the house to ourselves.
</p>
<p>About eight o'clock, as we were about to sit down to sup-
</p>
<p>per, our innkeeper's wife comes in to tell us that a Spanish
</p>
<p>grandee is below, who has been travelling for hours in the
</p>
<p>storm, and then she asked very humbly if our excellencies

<p>will permit her to lay him a bed in our room when we have

</p>
<p>done with it, as she can bestow him nowhere else (the
</p>
<p>muleteers filling her house to the very cock loft), and has
</p>
<p>not the heart to send him on to St. Denys in this pitiless
</p>
<p>driving rain. To this Don Sanchez replies, that a Spanish
</p>
<p>gentleman is welcome to all we can offer him, and there-
</p>
<p>with sends down a mighty civil message, begging his com-
</p>
<p>pany at our table.
</p>
<p>Moll has just time to whip on a piece of finery, and we
</p>
<p>to put on our best manners, when the landlady returns,
</p>
<p>followed by a stout, robust Spaniard, in an old coat several
</p>
<p>times too small for him, whom she introduced as Sefior
</p>
<p>Don Lopez de Calvados.
</p>
<p>Don Lopez makes us a reverence, and then, with his
</p>
<p>shoulders up to his ears and like gestures, gives us an
</p>
<p>harangue at some length, but this being in Spanish, is as
</p>
<p>heathen Greek to our ears. However, Don Sanchez ex-
</p>
<p>plains that our visitor is excusing his appearance as being
</p>
<p>forced to change his wet clothes for what the innkeeper
</p>
<p>can lend him, and so we, grinning to express our amia-
</p>
<p>bility, all sit down to table and set to Moll with her
</p>
<p>most finicking, delicate airs and graces, and Dawson and
</p>
<p>I silent as frogs, with understanding nothing of the Dons'
</p>
<p>conversation. This, we learn from Don Sanchez after sup-
</p>
<p>per, has turned chiefly on the best means of crossing into
</p>
<p>Spain, from which it appears there are two passes through
</p>
<p>the mountains, both leading to the same town, but one
</p>
<p>more circuitous than the other. Don Lopez has come by
</p>
<p>the latter, because the former is used by the muleteers,
</p>
<p>who are not always the most pleasant companions one can
</p>
<p>have in a dangerous road; and for this reason he recom-

<p>mends us to take his way, especially as we have a young

<p>lady with us, which will be the more practicable, as the
</p>
<p>same guides who conducted him will be only too glad to
</p>
<p>serve us on their return the next morning. To this propo-
</p>
<p>sition we very readily agree, and supper being ended, Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez sends for the guides, two hardy mountaineers, who
</p>
<p>very readily agree to take us this way the next morning, if
</p>
<p>the weather permits. And so we all, wishing Don Lopez a
</p>
<p>good-night, to our several chambers.
</p>
<p>I was awoke in the middle of the night, as it seemed to
</p>
<p>me, by a great commotion below of Spanish shouting and
</p>
<p>roaring with much jingling of bells; and looking out of
</p>
<p>window I perceived lanterns hanging here and there in the
</p>
<p>courtyard, and the muleteers packing their goods to depart,
</p>
<p>with a fine clear sky full of stars overhead. And scarce
</p>
<p>had I turned into my warm bed again, thanking God I was
</p>
<p>no muleteer, when in comes the Don with a candle, to say
</p>
<p>the guide will have us moving at once if we would reach
</p>
<p>Ravellos (our Spanish town) before night. So I to Daw-
</p>
<p>son's chamber, and he to Moll's, and in a little while we
</p>
<p>all shivering down to the great kitchen, where is never a
</p>
<p>muleteer left, but only a great stench of garlic, to eat a
</p>
<p>mess of soup, very hot and comforting. And after that
</p>
<p>out into the dark (there being as yet but a faint flush of
</p>
<p>green and primrose colour over towards the east), where
</p>
<p>four fresh mules (which Don Sanchez overnight had bar-
</p>
<p>gained to exchange against our horses, as being the only
</p>
<p>kind of cattle fit for this service) are waiting for us with
</p>
<p>other two mules, belonging to our guides, all very curiously
</p>
<p>trapped out with a network of wool and little jingling
</p>
<p>bells. Then when Don Sanchez had solemnly debated

<p>whether we should not awake Don Lopez to say farewell,

</p>
<p>and we had persuaded him that it would be kinder to let
</p>
<p>him sleep on, we mounted into our high, fantastic saddles,
</p>
<p>and set out towards the mountains, our guides leading, and
</p>
<p>we following close upon their heels as our mules could get,
</p>
<p>but by no guidance of ours, though we held the reins, for
</p>
<p>these creatures are very sagacious and so pertinacious and
</p>
<p>opiniastre that I believe though you pulled their heads off
</p>
<p>they would yet go their own way.
</p>
<p>Our road at first lay across a rising plain, very wild and
</p>
<p>scrubby, as I imagine, by the frequent deviations of our
</p>
<p>beast, and then through a forest of cork oaks, which keep
</p>
<p>their leaves all the year through, and here, by reason of
</p>
<p>the great shade, we went, not knowing whither, as if blind-
</p>
<p>fold, only we were conscious of being on rough, rising
</p>
<p>ground, by the jolting of our mules and the clatter of their
</p>
<p>hoofs upon stones; but after a wearisome, long spell of this
</p>
<p>business, the trees growing more scattered and a thin grey
</p>
<p>light creeping through, we could make out that we were all
</p>
<p>together, which was some comfort. From these oaks, we
</p>
<p>passed into a wood of chestnuts, and still going up and up,
</p>
<p>but by such devious, unseen ways, that I think no man,
</p>
<p>stranger to these parts, could pick it out for himself in
</p>
<p>broad daylight, we came thence into a great stretch of pine
</p>
<p>trees, with great rocks scattered amongst them, as if some
</p>
<p>mountain had been blown up and fallen in a huge shower
</p>
<p>of fragments.
</p>
<p>And so, still for ever toiling and scambling upwards, we
</p>
<p>found ourselves about seven o'clock, as I should judge by
</p>
<p>the light beyond the trees and upon the side of the moun-
</p>
<p>tain, with the whole champaign laid out like a carpet under

<p>us on one side, prodigious slopes of rock on either hand,
</p>
<p>A MOST HORRID JOURNEY. 59
</p>
<p>with only a shrub or a twisted fir here and there, and on
</p>
<p>the further side a horrid stark ravine with a cascade of water
</p>
<p>thundering down in its midst, and a peak rising beyond,
</p>
<p>covered with snow, which glittered in the sunlight like a
</p>
<p>monstrous heap of white salt.
</p>
<p>After resting at this point half an hour to breathe our
</p>
<p>mules, the guides got into their saddles, and we did like-
</p>
<p>wise, and so on again along the side of the ravine, only

<p>not of a cluster as heretofore, but one behind the other in
</p>
<p>a long line, the mules falling into this order of themselves
</p>
<p>as if they had travelled the path an hundred times; but
</p>
<p>there was no means of going otherwise, the path being
</p>
<p>atrociously narrow and steep, and only fit for wild goats,
</p>
<p>there being no landrail, coping, or anything in the world
</p>
<p>to stay one from being hurled down a thousand feet, and
</p>
<p>the mountain sides so inclined that 'twas a miracle the
</p>
<p>mules could find foothold and keep their balance. From
</p>
<p>the bottom of the ravine came a constant roar of falling
</p>
<p>water, though we could spy it only now and then leaping
</p>
<p>down from one chasm to another; and more than once our
</p>
<p>guides would cry to us to stop (and that where our mules
</p>
<p>had to keep shifting their feet to get a hold) while some
</p>
<p>huge boulder, loosened by the night's rain, flew down
</p>
<p>across our path in terrific bounds from the heights above,
</p>
<p>making the very mountain tremble with the shock. Not
</p>
<p>a word spoke we ; nay, we had scarce courage at times to
</p>
<p>draw breath, for two hours and more of this fearful passage,
</p>
<p>with no encouragement from our guides save that one of
</p>
<p>them did coolly take out a knife and peel an onion as
</p>
<p>though he had been on a level, broad road; and then,

</p>
<p>reaching a flat space, we came to a stand again before an
</p>
<p>60 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>ascent that promised to be worse than that we had done.
</p>
<p>Here we got down, Moll clinging to our hands and looking
</p>
<p>around her with large, frighted eyes.
</p>
<p>"Shall we soon be there? " she asked.
</p>
<p>And the Don, putting this question in Spanish to the
</p>
<p>guides, they pointed upwards to a gap filled with snow,
</p>
<p>and answered that was the highest point. This was some
</p>
<p>consolation, though we could not regard the rugged way
</p>
<p>that lay betwixt us and that without quaking. Indeed, I
</p>
<p>thought that even Don Sanchez, despite the calm, unmoved
</p>
<p>countenance he ever kept, did look about him with a cer-
</p>
<p>tain kind of uneasiness. However, taking example from
</p>
<p>our guides, we unloosed our saddle bags, and laid out our
</p>
<p>store of victuals with a hogskin of wine which rekindled
</p>
<p>our spirits prodigiously.
</p>
<p>While we were at this repast, our guides, starting as if
</p>
<p>they had caught a sound (though we heard none save the
</p>
<p>horrid bursting of water), looked down, and one of them,
</p>
<p>clapping two dirty fingers in his mouth, made a shrill
</p>
<p>whistle. Then we, looking down, presently spied two
</p>
<p>mules far below on the path we had come, but at such a
</p>
<p>distance that we could scarce make out whether they were
</p>
<p>mounted or not.
</p>
<p>"Who are they?" asks Don Sanchez, sternly, as I man-
</p>
<p>aged to understand.
</p>
<p>"Friends," replies one of the fellows, with a grin that

<p>seemed to lay his face in two halves.

</p>
<p>How we were entertained in the mountains, and stand in a fair way
</p>
<p>to have our throats cut.
</p>
<p>" WE will go on when you are ready," says Don Sanchez,
</p>
<p>turning to us.
</p>
<p>" Aye," growled Jack in my ear, " with all my heart.
</p>
<p>For if these friends be of the same kidney as Don Lopez,
</p>
<p>we may be persuaded to take a better road, which God for-
</p>
<p>bid if this be a sample of their preference."
</p>
<p>So being in our saddles forth we set once more and on
</p>
<p>a path no easier than before, but worse like a very house-
</p>
<p>top for steepness, without a tinge of any living thing for
</p>
<p>succour if one fell, but only sharp, jagged rocks, and that
</p>
<p>which now added to our peril was here and there a patch of
</p>
<p>snow, so that the mules must cock their ears and feel their
</p>
<p>way before advancing a step, now halting for dread, and
</p>
<p>now scuttling on with their tails betwixt their legs as the
</p>
<p>stones rolled under them.
</p>
<p>But the longest road hath an end, and so at length reach-
</p>
<p>ing that gap we had seen from below, to our great content
</p>
<p>we beheld through an angle in the mountain a tract of open
</p>
<p>country below, looking mighty green and sweet in the dis-
</p>
<p>tance. And at the sight of this, Moll clapt her hands
</p>
<p>and cried out with joy; indeed, we were all as mad as
</p>
<p>children with the thought that our task was half done.
</p>
<p>Only the Don kept his gravity. But turning to Moll, he

</p>
<p>stretches out his hand towards the plain and says with
</p>
<p>prodigious pride, " My country ! "
</p>
<p>And now we began the descent, which was actually more
</p>
<p>perilous than the ascent, but we made light of it, being very
</p>
<p>much enlivened by the high mountain air and the relief
</p>
<p>from dread uncertainty, shouting out our reflections one to
</p>
<p>another as we jolted down the rugged path.
</p>
<p>"After all, Jack," says I to him at the top of my voice,
</p>
<p>being in advance and next to Don Sanchez ; " after all, Don
</p>
<p>Lopez was not such a bad friend to us."
</p>
<p>Upon which, the Don, stopping his mule at the risk of
</p>
<p>being cast down the abyss, turns in his saddle, and says :
</p>
<p>" Fellow, Don Lopez is a Spaniard. A Castilian of noble
</p>
<p>birth " but here his mule deciding that this was no fit place
</p>
<p>for halting, bundled onward at a trot to overtake the guides,
</p>
<p>and obliged his rider to turn his attention to other matters.
</p>
<p>By the look of the sun it must have been about two in the
</p>
<p>afternoon when, rounding a great bluff of rock, we came
</p>
<p>upon a kind of tableland which commanded a wide view of
</p>
<p>the plain below, most dazzling to our eyes after the gloomy
</p>
<p>recesses of the pass ; and here we found trees growing and
</p>
<p>some rude attempt at cultivation, but all very poor and
</p>
<p>stunted, being still very high and exposed to the bleak winds
</p>
<p>issuing from the gorges.
</p>
<p>Our guides, throwing themselves on the ground, repaired
</p>
<p>once more to their store of onions, and we, nothing loath to
</p>
<p>follow their examples, opened our saddle bags, and with our
</p>
<p>cold meat and the hogskin of wine made another good repast
</p>
<p>and very merry. And the Don, falling into discourse with
</p>
<p>the guides, pointed out to us a little white patch on the plain

<p>below, and told us that was Ravellos, where we should find
</p>
<p>SIGNS OF TRIBULATION IN STORE. 63
</p>
<p>one of the best posadas in the world, which added to our
</p>
<p>satisfaction. " But " says he, " 'tis yet four hours' march
</p>
<p>ere we reach it, so we had best be packing quickly."
</p>
<p>Thereupon we finished our meal in haste, the guides still
</p>
<p>lying on the ground eating onions, and when we were pre-
</p>
<p>pared to start they still lay there and would not budge.
</p>
<p>On this ensued another discussion, very indignant and
</p>
<p>passionate on the part of Don Sanchez, and as cool and
</p>
<p>phlegmatic on the side of the guides, the upshot of which
</p>
<p>was, as we learned from Don, that these rascals maintained
</p>
<p>they had fulfilled their bargain in bringing us over into Spain,
</p>
<p>but as to carrying us to Ravellos they would by no means
</p>
<p>do that without the permission of their zefe, who was one
</p>
<p>of those they had whistled to from our last halting place,
</p>
<p>and whom they were now staying for.
</p>
<p>Then, beginning to quake a bit at the strangeness of this
</p>
<p>treatment, we looked about us to see if we might venture to
</p>
<p>continue our journey alone. But Lord ! one might as easily
</p>
<p>have found a needle in a bundle of hay as a path amidst this
</p>
<p>labyrinth of rocks and horrid fissures that environed us ; and
</p>
<p>this was so obvious that the guides, though not yet paid for
</p>
<p>their service, made no attempt to follow or to stay us, as
</p>
<p>knowing full well we must come back in despair. So there
</p>
<p>was no choice but to wait the coming up of the zefe, the
</p>
<p>Don standing with his legs astride and his arms folded, with
</p>
<p>a very storm of passion in his face, in readiness to confront
</p>
<p>the tardy zefe with his reproaches for this delay and the
</p>
<p>affront offered to himself, we casting our eye longingly down
</p>
<p>at Ravellos, and the guides silently munching their onions.
</p>
<p>Thus we waited until the fine ear of our guides catching a

</p>
<p>sound, they rose to their feet muttering the word " zefe,"
</p>
<p>64 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>and pull off their hats as two men mounted on mules tricked
</p>
<p>out like our own, came round the corner and pulled up
</p>
<p>before us. But what was our surprise to see that the fore-
</p>
<p>most of these fellows was none other than the Don Lopez
</p>
<p>de Calvados we had entertained to supper the night before,
</p>
<p>and of whose noble family Don Sanchez had been prating so
</p>
<p>highly, and not a thread better dressed than when we saw
</p>
<p>him last, and full as dirty. That which gave us most uneasi-
</p>
<p>ness, however, was to observe that each of these " friends "
</p>
<p>carried an ugly kind of musket slung across his back, and a
</p>
<p>most unpleasant long sheath knife in his waist cloth.
</p>
<p>Not a word says our Don Sanchez, but feigning still to
</p>
<p>believe him a man of quality, he returns the other Don's salu-
</p>
<p>tation with all the ceremony possible. Then Don Lopez,
</p>
<p>smiling from ear to ear, begs us (as I learnt afterwards) to
</p>
<p>pardon him for keeping us waiting, which had not happened,
</p>
<p>he assures us, if we had not suffered him to oversleep himself.
</p>
<p>He then informs us that we are now upon his domain, and
</p>
<p>begs us to accept such hospitality as his Castillo will furnish,
</p>
<p>in return for our entertainment of last night. To this Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez replies with a thousand thanks that we are anxious
</p>
<p>to reach Ravellos before nightfall, and that, therefore, we
</p>
<p>will be going at once if it is all the same to him. With
</p>
<p>more bowing and scraping Don Lopez amiably but firmly
</p>
<p>declines to accept any refusal of his offer or to talk of
</p>
<p>business before his debt of gratitude is paid. With that
</p>
<p>he gives a sign to our guides, who at once lead off our
</p>
<p>mules at a brisk trot, leaving us to follow on foot with
</p>
<p>Don Lopez and his companion, whom he introduces as
</p>
<p>Don Ruiz del Puerto, as arrant a cut-throat rascal to

</p>
<p>ENTERTAINED TO OUR DISCOMFORT. 65
</p>
<p>So we with very dismal forebodings trudge on, having no
</p>
<p>other course to take, Don Sanchez, to make the best of it,
</p>
<p>warranting that no harm shall come to us while we are under
</p>
<p>the hospitable protection of a Spaniard, but to no great effect
</p>
<p>our faith being already shaken in his valuation of Spaniards.
</p>
<p>Quitting the tableland, ten minutes of leaping and
</p>
<p>scrambling brought us to a collection of miserable huts
</p>
<p>built all higgledy-piggledy along the edge of a torrent,
</p>
<p>overtopped by a square building of more consequence,
</p>
<p>built of grey stone and roofed with slate shingles, but with
</p>
<p>nothing but ill-shaped holes for windows ; and this, Don
</p>
<p>Lopez with some pride told us was his castillo. A ragged
</p>
<p>crew of women and children, apprised of our coming by the
</p>
<p>guide, maybe, trooped out of the village to meet us and
</p>
<p>hailed our approach with shouts of joy, " for all the world
</p>
<p>like a pack of hounds at the sight of their keeper with a
</p>
<p>dish of bones," whispers Jack Dawson in my ear ominously.
</p>
<p>But it was curious to see how they did all fall back in two
</p>
<p>lines, those that had hats taking them off as Don Lopez
</p>
<p>passed, he bowing to them right and left, like any prince
</p>
<p>in his progress.
</p>
<p>So we up to the castillo, where all the men of the
</p>
<p>village are assembled and all armed like Don Lopez, and
</p>
<p>they greet us with cries of " Hola ! " and throwing up of
</p>
<p>hats. They making way for us with salutations on both sides,
</p>
<p>we enter the castillo, where we find one great ill-paved room
</p>
<p>with a step-ladder on one side leading to the floor above, but
</p>
<p>no furniture save a table and some benches of wood, all
</p>
<p>black and shining with grease and dirt. But indeed the
</p>
<p>walls, the ceiling, and all else about us was beyond every-
</p>
<p>thing for blackness, and this was easily to be understood,

<p>66 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>for a wench coming in with a cauldron lights a faggot of
</p>
<p>wood in a corner, where was no chimney to carry off the
</p>
<p>smoke, but only a hole in the wall with a kind of eaves over
</p>
<p>it, so that presently the place was so filled with the fumes
</p>
<p>'twas difficult to see across it.
</p>
<p>Don Lopez (always as gracious as a cat with a milk-
</p>
<p>maid) asks Moll through Don Sanchez if she would like to
</p>
<p>make her toilette, while dinner is preparing, and at this
</p>
<p>offer all of us jump choosing anything for a change ; so he
</p>
<p>takes us up the step-ladder to the floor above, which differs
</p>
<p>from that below in being cut up into half a dozen pieces by
</p>
<p>some low partition of planks nailed loosely together like
</p>
<p>cribs for cattle, with some litter of dry leaves and hay in
</p>
<p>each, but in other respects being just as naked and grimy,
</p>
<p>with a cloud of smoke coming up through the chinks in the
</p>
<p>floor.
</p>
<p>"You will have the sole use of these chambers during
</p>
<p>your stay," says Don Lopez, " and for your better assurance
</p>
<p>you can draw the ladder up after you on retiring for the
</p>
<p>night."
</p>
<p>But for the gravity of our situation and prospects I could
</p>
<p>have burst out laughing when Don Sanchez gave us the
</p>
<p>translation of this promise, for the idea of regarding these
</p>
<p>pens as chambers was not less ludicrous than the air of
</p>
<p>pride with which Don Lopez bestowed the privilege of
</p>
<p>using 'em upon us.
</p>
<p>Don Lopez left us, promising to send a maid with the
</p>
<p>necessary appointments for Moll's toilette.
</p>
<p>"A plague of all this finery ! " growled Dawson. "How
</p>
<p>long may it be, think you, Senor, ere we can quit this palace

<p>and get to one of those posadas you promised us? "
</p>
<p>NO RELISH FOR OUR MEAT. 6/
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez hunched his shoulders for all reply and
</p>
<p>turned away to hide his mortification. And now a girl
</p>
<p>comes up with a biggin of water on her head, a broken
</p>
<p>comb in her hand, and a ragged cloth on her arm that
</p>
<p>looked as if it had never been washed since it left the
</p>
<p>loom, and sets them down on a bench, with a grin at Moll ;
</p>
<p>but she, though not over-nice, turns away with a pout of
</p>
<p>disgust, and then we to get a breath of fresh air to a hole
</p>
<p>in the wall on the windward side, where we stand all dumb
</p>
<p>with disappointment and dread until we are called down to
</p>
<p>dinner. But before going down Don Sanchez warns us to
</p>
<p>stand on our best behaviour, as these Spaniards, for all their
</p>
<p>rude seeming, were of a particularly punctilious, ticklish dis-
</p>
<p>position, and that we might come badly out of this business
</p>
<p>if we happened to displease them.
</p>
<p>" I cannot see reason in that, Sefior," says Dawson ; " for
</p>
<p>the less we please 'em, the sooner they are likely to send us
</p>
<p>hence, and so the better for us."
</p>
<p>"As you please," replies the Don, "but my warning is to
</p>
<p>your advantage."
</p>
<p>Down we go, and there stands Don Lopez with a dozen
</p>
<p>choice friends, all the raggedest, dirty villains in the world ;
</p>
<p>and they saluting us, we return their civility with a very
</p>
<p>fair pretence and take the seats offered us they standing
</p>
<p>until we are set. Then they sit down, and each man lugs
</p>
<p>out a knife from his waist-cloth. The cauldron, filled with
</p>
<p>a mess of kid stewed in a multitude of onions, is fetched
</p>
<p>from the fire, and, being set upon a smooth board, is slid
</p>
<p>down the table to our host, who, after picking out some tit-
</p>
<p>bits for us, serves himself, and so slides it back, each man

<p>in turn picking out a morsel on the end of his knife. Bear-
</p>
<p>68 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>ing in mind Don Sanchez's warning, we do our best to eat
</p>
<p>of this dish ; but, Heaven knows ! with little relish, and
</p>
<p>mighty glad when the cauldron is empty and that part of
</p>
<p>the performance ended. Then the bones being swept from
</p>
<p>the table, a huge skin of wine is set before Don Lopez, and
</p>
<p>he serves us each with about a quart in an odd-shaped ves-
</p>
<p>sel with a spout, which Don Sanchez and his countrymen
</p>
<p>use by holding it above their heads and letting the wine
</p>
<p>spurt into their mouths ; but we, being unused to this fashion,
</p>
<p>preferred rather to suck it out of the spout, which seemed
</p>
<p>to them as odd a mode as theirs was to us. However, bet-
</p>
<p>ter wine, drink it how you may, there is none than the wine
</p>
<p>of these parts, and this reconciling us considerably to our
</p>
<p>condition, we listened with content to their singing of dit-
</p>
<p>ties, which they did very well for such rude fellows, to the
</p>
<p>music of a guitar and a tambourine. And so when our pots
</p>
<p>came to be replenished a second time, we were all mighty
</p>
<p>merry and agreeable save Jack Dawson, who never could
</p>
<p>take his liquor like any other man, but must fall into some
</p>
<p>extravagant humour, and he, I perceived, regarded some
</p>
<p>of the company with a very sour, jealous eye because, being
</p>
<p>warmed with drink, they fell to casting glances at Moll with
</p>
<p>a certain dregee of familiarity. Especially there was one
</p>
<p>fellow with a hook nose, who stirred his bile exceedingly,
</p>
<p>sitting with his elbows on the table and his jaws in his
</p>
<p>hands, and would scarcely shift his eyes from Moll. And
</p>
<p>since he could not make his displeasure understood in
</p>
<p>words, and so give vent to it and be done, Jack sat there in
</p>
<p>sullen silence watching for an opportunity to show his resent-
</p>
<p>ment in some other fashion. The other saw this well enough,

<p>like two dogs ready to fly at each other's throats. At length,

<p>as if to reach for his wine pot, and stretching across the
</p>
<p>table, chucks Moll under the chin with his grimy ringers.
</p>
<p>At this Jack flinging out his great fist with all the force of
</p>
<p>contained passion, catches the other right in the middle of
</p>
<p>the face, with such effect that the fellow flies clean back
</p>
<p>over his bench, his head striking the pavement with a crash.

<p>to be taken in the flank, he swings his stool ready to dash

<p>Seeing their fellow laid out for dead on the floor, with
</p>
<p>his hook nose smashed most horridly into his face, the
</p>
<p>others had no stomach to meet the same fate, but with their
</p>
<p>Spanish cunning began to spread out that so they might
</p>
<p>attack us on all sides ; and surely this had done our business
</p>
<p>but that Don Lopez, flinging himself before us with his knife
</p>
<p>raised high, cries out at the top of his voice, " Rekbah ! "
</p>
<p>a word of their own language, I am told, taken from the
</p>
<p>Moorish, and signifying that whosoever shall outrage the laws
</p>
<p>of hospitality under his roof shall be his enemy to the death.
</p>
<p>And at this word every man stood still as if by inchantment,
</p>
<p>and let fall his weapon. Then in the same high voice he
</p>
<p>gives them an harangue, showing them that Dawson was in
</p>
<p>the right to avenge an insult offered his daughter, and the
</p>
<p>other justly served for his offence to us. " For his offence
</p>
<p>to me as the host of these strangers," adds he, "Jose shall
</p>
<p>answer to me hereafter if he live ; if he be dead, his body

<p>shall be flung to the vultures of the gorge, and his name be

<p>never uttered again beneath this roof."
</p>
<p>" I bear no grudges, not I," says Dawson, when Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez gave him the English of this. " If he live, let his
</p>
<p>nose be set ; and if dead, let him be buried decently in a
</p>
<p>churchyard. But hark ye, Sefior, lest we fall out again and
</p>
<p>come out worse the next bout, do pray ask his worship if
</p>
<p>we may not be accommodated with a guide to take us on
</p>
<p>our way at once. We have yet two hours of daylight before
</p>
<p>us, there's not a cloud in the sky, and with such a moon as
</p>
<p>we had the night before last, we may get on well enough."
</p>
<p>Poor Moll, who was all of a shake with the terror of
</p>
<p>another catastrophe, added her prayers to Dawson's, and
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez with a profusion of civilities laid the proposal
</p>
<p>before Don Lopez, who, though professing the utmost regret
</p>
<p>to lose us so soon, consented to gratify our wish, adding
</p>
<p>that his mules were so well accustomed to the road that
</p>
<p>they could make the journey as well in the dark as in broad
</p>
<p>day.
</p>
<p>" Well, then," says Dawson, when this was told us, " let us
</p>
<p>settle the business at once, and be off."
</p>
<p>And now, when Don Sanchez proposed to pay for the
</p>
<p>service of our guides, it was curious to see how every rascal
</p>
<p>at the table craned forward to watch the upshot. Don
</p>
<p>Lopez makes a pretence of leaving the payment to Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez's generosity ; and he, not behindhand in courtesy,
</p>
<p>lugs out his purse and begs the other to pay himself.
</p>
<p>Whereupon, with more apologies, Don Lopez empties the
</p>
<p>money on the table and carefully counts it, and there being
</p>
<p>but about a score of gold pieces and some silver, he shakes

</p>
<p>/2 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>reproachful tone of remonstrance, to which our Don replies
</p>
<p>by turning all the trifles out of his pocket, one after the
</p>
<p>other, to prove that he has no money.
</p>
<p>" I thought as much," growls Jack in my ear. " A pretty
</p>
<p>nest of hornets we're fallen into."
</p>
<p>The company, seeing there was no more to be got out of
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez, began to murmur and cast their eyes at us ;
</p>
<p>whereupon Dawson, seeing how the land lay, stands up and
</p>
<p>empties his pockets on the table, and I likewise ; but be-
</p>
<p>twixt us there was no more than some French pennies and
</p>
<p>a few odds and ends of no value at all. Fetching a deep
</p>
<p>sigh, Don Lopez takes all these possessions into a heap
</p>
<p>before him, and tells Don Sanchez that he cannot believe
</p>
<p>persons of our quality could travel with so little, that he feels
</p>
<p>convinced Don Sanchez must have dropped a purse on the
</p>
<p>way, and that until it is found he can on no account allow
</p>
<p>us to leave the neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>" This comes of being so mighty fine ! " says Dawson,
</p>
<p>when Don Sanchez had explained matters. " Had we trav-
</p>
<p>elled as became our condition, this brigand would never
</p>
<p>have ensnared us hither. And if they won't believe your
</p>
<p>story, Senor, I can't blame 'em ; for I would have sworn you
</p>
<p>had a thousand pounds to your hand."
</p>
<p>"Do you reproach me for my generosity?" asks the Don.
</p>
<p>" Nay, Master, I love you for being free with your money
</p>
<p>while you have it, but 'tis a queer kind of generosity to
</p>
<p>bring us into these parts with no means of taking us back
</p>
<p>again. Hows'ever, we'll say no more about that if we get
</p>
<p>out of this cursed smoke-hole ; and as we are like to come

<p>WE ARE PUT ON OUR METTLE. 73
</p>
<p>and acquaint them that we are no gentle folk, but only three
</p>
<p>poor English mountebanks brought hither on a wild goose
</p>
<p>chase."
</p>
<p>This was a bitter pill for Don Sanchez to swallow ; how-
</p>
<p>ever, seeing no other cure for our ills, he gulped it down
</p>
<p>with the best face he could put on it. But from the
</p>
<p>mockery and laughter of all who heard him, 'twas plain to
</p>
<p>see they would not believe a word of his story.
</p>
<p>"What would you have me do now?" asks the Don,
</p>
<p>turning to us when the clamour had subsided, and he told
</p>
<p>us how he had tried to persuade them we were dancers he
</p>
<p>was taking for a show to the fair at Barcelona, which they,
</p>
<p>by our looks, would not believe, and especially that a man
</p>
<p>of such build as Jack Dawson could foot it, even to please
</p>
<p>such heavy people as the English.
</p>
<p>" What ! " cries Jack. " I can't dance ! We will pretty
</p>
<p>soon put them to another complexion if they do but give
</p>
<p>us space and a fair trial. You can strum a guitar, Kit, for
</p>
<p>I've heard you. And Moll, my chick, do you dash the
</p>
<p>tears from your cheek and pluck up courage to show these
</p>
<p>Portugals what an English lass can do."
</p>
<p>The brigands agreeing to this trial, the table is shoved
</p>
<p>back to give us a space in the best light, and our judges
</p>
<p>seat themselves conveniently. Moll brushes her eyes (to a
</p>
<p>little murmur of sympathy, as I thought), and I, striking
</p>
<p>out the tune, Jack, with all the magnificence of a king, takes
</p>
<p>her hand and leads her out to a French pavan; and sure
</p>
<p>no one in the world ever stepped it more gracefully than
</p>
<p>our poor little Moll (now put upon her mettle), nor more
</p>
<p>lightly than Dawson, so that every rascal in our audience

<p>74 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>" Hola ! " when it was done. And this warming us, we
</p>
<p>gave 'em next an Italian coranto, and after that, an English
</p>
<p>pillow dance ; and, in good faith, had they all been our
</p>
<p>dearest friends, these dirty fellows could not have gone
</p>
<p>more mad with delight. And then Moll and her father
</p>
<p>sitting down to fetch their breath, a dispute arose among
</p>
<p>the brigands which we were at a loss to understand, until
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez explained that a certain number would have
</p>
<p>it we were real dancers, but that another party, with Don
</p>
<p>Lopez, maintained these were but court dances, which
</p>
<p>only proved the more we were of high quality to be thus
</p>
<p>accomplished.
</p>
<p>" We'll convince 'em yet, Moll, with a pox of their doubts,"
</p>
<p>cries Dawson, starting to his feet again. " Tell 'em we will
</p>
<p>give 'em a stage dance of a nymph and a wild man, Senor,
</p>
<p>with an excuse for our having no costume but this. Play us
</p>
<p>our pastoral, Kit. And sing you your ditty of * Broken
</p>
<p>Heart,' Moll, in the right place, that I may get my wind for
</p>
<p>the last caper."
</p>
<p>Moll nods, and with ready wit takes the ribbon from her
</p>
<p>head, letting her pretty hair tumble all about her shoulders,
</p>
<p>and then whipping up her long skirt, tucks one end under
</p>
<p>her girdle, thereby making a very dainty show of pink lining
</p>
<p>against the dark stuff, and also giving more play for her feet.
</p>
<p>And so thus they dance their pastoral, Don Sanchez taking
</p>
<p>a tambourine and tapping it lightly to the measure, up to
</p>
<p>Moll's song, which so ravished these hardy, stony men by
</p>
<p>the pathetic sweetness of her voice, for they could under-
</p>
<p>stand nothing save by her expression, that they would not
</p>
<p>let the dance go on until she had sung it through again. To

<p>THE DON AND I PLUMED OF OUR FINE FEATHERS. /5
</p>
<p>and flings out his last steps with such vigour and agility as
</p>
<p>to quite astound all.
</p>
<p>And now the show being ended, and not one but is
</p>
<p>a-crying of " Hola ! " and " Animo ! " Moll snatches the tam-
</p>
<p>bourine from Don Sanchez's hand, and stepping before Don
</p>
<p>Lopez drops him a curtsey, and offers it for her reward.
</p>
<p>At this Don Lopez, glancing at the money on the table by
</p>
<p>his side, and looking round for sanction to his company
</p>
<p>(which they did give him without one voice of opposition),
</p>
<p>he takes up two of the gold pieces and drops them on the
</p>
<p>parchment. Thus did our Moll, by one clever hit, draw an
</p>
<p>acknowledgment from them that we were indeed no fine
</p>
<p>folks, but mere players, which point they might have stum-
</p>
<p>bled over in their cooler moments.
</p>
<p>But we were not quit yet ; for on Don Sanchez's begging
</p>
<p>that we should now be set upon our road to Ravellos, the
</p>
<p>other replies that though he will do us this service with
</p>
<p>great pleasure, yet he cannot permit us to encounter the
</p>
<p>danger again of being taken for persons of quality. " Fine
</p>
<p>dress," says he, "may be necessary to the Senor and his
</p>
<p>daughter for their court dances, and they are heartily wel-
</p>
<p>come to them for the pleasure they have given us, but for
</p>
<p>you and the musician who plays but indifferent well, meaner
</p>
<p>garb is more suitable ; and so you will be good enough to
</p>
<p>step upstairs, the pair of you, and change your clothing for
</p>
<p>such as we can furnish from our store."
</p>
<p>And upstairs we were forced to go, Don Sanchez and I,
</p>
<p>and there being stripped we were given such dirty foul rags
</p>
<p>and so grotesque, that when we came down, Jack Dawson
</p>
<p>and Moll fell a-laughing at us, as though they would burst.

</p>
<p>And, in truth, we made a most ludicrous spectacle, espe-
</p>
<p>? A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>cially the Don, whom hitherto we had seen only in the
</p>
<p>neatest and most noble of clothes, looking more like a
</p>
<p>couple of scarecrows than living men.
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez neither smiled nor frowned at this treat-
</p>
<p>ment, taking this misfortune with the resignation of a phi-
</p>
<p>losopher; only to quiet Dawson's merriment he told him
</p>
<p>that in the clothes taken from him was sewed up a bond for
</p>
<p>two hundred pounds, but whether this was true or not I
</p>
<p>cannot tell.
</p>
<p>And now, to bring an end to this adventure, we were
</p>
<p>taken down the intricate passes of the mountain in the
</p>
<p>moonlight, as many of the gang as could find mules coming
</p>
<p>with us for escort, and brought at last to the main road,
</p>
<p>where we were left with nought but what we stood in (save
</p>
<p>Moll's two pieces) , the robbers bidding us their adios with
</p>
<p>all the courtesy imaginable. But even then, robbed of all
</p>
<p>he had even to the clothes of his back, Don Sanchez's pride
</p>
<p>was unshaken, for he bade us note that the very thieves in
</p>
<p>Spain were gentlemen.
</p>
<p>As we trudged along the road toward Ravellos, we fell
</p>
<p>debating on our case, as what we should do next, etc., Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez promising that we should have redress for our ill-
</p>
<p>treatment, that his name alone would procure us a supply of
</p>
<p>money for our requirements, etc., to my great content. But
</p>
<p>Dawson was of another mind.

</p>
<p>shall you, Moll, my dear ; so make up your mind to lay aside
</p>
<p>your fine airs and hold up your nose no longer as if you
</p>
<p>were too good for your father."
</p>
<p>" Why, surely, Jack," says I, " you would not quit us and
</p>
<p>go from your bargain."
</p>
<p>"Not I, and you should know me well enough, Kit, to
</p>
<p>have no doubt on that score. But 'tis no part of our bar-
</p>
<p>gain that we should bustle anybody but Simon the
</p>
<p>steward."
</p>
<p>" We have four hundred miles to go ere we reach Elche,"
</p>
<p>says Don Sanchez. " Can you tell me how we are to get
</p>
<p>there without money ? "
</p>
<p>" Aye, that I can, and I warrant my plan as good as your
</p>
<p>honour's. How many tens are there in four hundred, Kit ? "
</p>
<p>" Forty."
</p>
<p>" Well, we can walk ten miles a day on level ground, and
</p>
<p>so may do this journey in six weeks or thereabouts, which is
</p>
<p>no such great matter, seeing we are not to be back in Eng-
</p>
<p>land afore next year. We can buy a guitar and a tabor out
</p>
<p>of Moll's pieces ; with them we can give a show wherever
</p>
<p>we stay for the night, and if honest men do but pay us half
</p>
<p>as much as the thieves of this country, we may fare pretty
</p>
<p>well."
</p>
<p>" I confess," says Don Sanchez, " your scheme is the best,
</p>
<p>and I would myself have proposed it but that I can do so
</p>
<p>little for my share."
</p>
<p>"Why, what odds does that make, Senor?" cries Jack.

<p>CHAPTER X.
</p>
<p>Of our merry journeying to Alicante.
</p>
<p>WE turned into the first posada we came to a poor,
</p>
<p>mean sort of an inn and general shop, to be sure, but we
</p>
<p>were in no condition to cavil about trifles, being fagged
</p>
<p>out with our journey and the adventures of the day, and
</p>
<p>only too happy to find a house of entertainment still open.
</p>
<p>So after a dish of sausages with very good wine, we to our
</p>
<p>beds and an end to the torment of fleas I had endured from
</p>
<p>the moment I changed my French habit for Spanish rags.
</p>
<p>The next morning, when we had eaten a meal of goats'
</p>
<p>milk and bread and paid our reckoning, which amounted
</p>
<p>to a few rials and no more, Don Sanchez and I, taking
</p>
<p>what rested of Moll's two pieces, went forth into the town
</p>
<p>and there bought two plain suits of clothes for ourselves in
</p>
<p>the mode of the country, and (according to his desire)
</p>
<p>another of the same cut for Dawson, together with a little
</p>
<p>jacket and petticoat for Moll. And these expenditures left
</p>
<p>us but just enough to buy a good guitar and a tambourine
</p>
<p>indeed, we should not have got them at all but that Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez higgled and bargained like any Jew, which he
</p>
<p>could do with a very good face now that he was dressed
</p>
<p>so beggarly. Then back to our posada, where in our room
</p>
<p>Jack and I were mighty merry in putting on our new
</p>
<p>clothes; but going below we find Moll still dressed in her
</p>
<p>finery, and sulking before the petticoat and jacket we had

</p>
<p>bought for her, which she would not put on by any persuasion
</p>
<p>until her father fell into a passion of anger. And the sight
</p>
<p>of him fuming in a short jacket barely covering his loins,
</p>
<p>and a pair of breeches so tight the seams would scarce hold
</p>
<p>together, so tickled her sense of humour that she fell into a
</p>
<p>long fit of laughter, and this ending her sulks she went up-
</p>
<p>stairs with a good grace and returned in her hated petticoat,
</p>
<p>carrying her fine dress in a bundle. But I never yet knew the
</p>
<p>time when this sly baggage would not please herself for all
</p>
<p>her seeming yielding to others, and we were yet to have more
</p>
<p>pain from her than she from us in respect of that skirt.
</p>
<p>For ere we had got half way through the town she, dawd-
</p>
<p>ling behind to look first in this shop and then in that, gave
</p>
<p>us the slip, so that we were best part of an hour hunting
</p>
<p>the streets up and down in the utmost anxiety. Then as
</p>
<p>we were sweating with our exercise and trouble, lol she
</p>
<p>steps out of a shop as calm as you please in a petticoat and
</p>
<p>jacket of her own fancy (and ten times more handsome
</p>
<p>than our purchase), a red shawl tied about her waist, and a
</p>
<p>little round hat with a bright red bob in it, set on one
</p>
<p>side of her head, and all as smart as a carrot.
</p>
<p>" Da ! " says she, " where have you been running all this
</p>
<p>time?"
</p>
<p>And we, betwixt joy at finding her and anger at her im-
</p>
<p>pudence, could say nothing ; and yet we were fain to admire
</p>
<p>her audacity too. But how, not knowing one word of the
</p>
<p>language, she had made her wants known was a mystery, and
</p>
<p>how she had obtained this finery was another, seeing that we
</p>
<p>had spent all there was of her two pieces. Certainly she had
</p>
<p>not changed her French gown and things for them, for these
</p>
<p>in a cumbrous bundle had her father been carrying up and

<p>" If you han't stole 'em," says Dawson, finding his tongue
</p>
<p>at last, " where did you find the money to pay for those trap-
</p>
<p>pings, slut?"
</p>
<p>" In my pocket, sir," says she, with a curtsey, " where you
</p>
<p>might have found yours had you not emptied it so readily for
</p>
<p>the robbers yesterday. And I fancy," adds she slyly, " I may
</p>
<p>still find some left to offer you a dinner at midday if you will
</p>
<p>accept of it."
</p>
<p>This hint disposed us to make light of our grievance against

<p>her, and we went out of Ravellos very well satisfied to know
</p>
<p>that our next meal depended not solely upon chance. And
</p>
<p>this, together with the bright sunlight and the sweet invigo-
</p>
<p>rating morning air, did beget in us a spirit of happy careless-
</p>
<p>ness, in keeping with the smiling gay aspect of the country
</p>
<p>about us.
</p>
<p>It was strange to see how easily Moll fell into our happy-
</p>
<p>go-lucky humour, she, who had been as stately as any Roman
</p>
<p>queen in her long gown, being now, in her short coloured
</p>
<p>petticoat, as frolicsome and familiar as a country wench at a
</p>
<p>fair; but indeed she was a born actress and could accommo-
</p>
<p>date herself as well to one condition as another with the mere
</p>
<p>change of clothes. But I think this state was more to her
</p>
<p>real taste than the other, as putting no restraint upon her
</p>
<p>impulses and giving free play to her healthy, exuberant mirth.
</p>
<p>Her very step was a kind of dance, and she must needs fall
</p>
<p>a-carolling of songs like a lark when it flies. Then she would
</p>
<p>have us rehearse our old songs to our new music. So, sling-
</p>
<p>ing my guitar in front of me, I put it in tune, and Jack ties his
</p>
<p>bundle to his back that he may try his hand at the tambour-
</p>
<p>ine. And so we march along singing and playing as if to a

</p>
<p>other fell out of tune, the most mad, light-hearted fools in
</p>
<p>the world; but I speak not of Don Sanchez, who, feel what
</p>
<p>he might, never relaxed his high bearing or unbent his serious
</p>
<p>countenance.
</p>
<p>One thing I remember of him on this journey. Hav-
</p>
<p>ing gone about five miles, we sat us down on a bridge to
</p>
<p>rest a while, and there the Don left us to go a little way up
</p>
<p>the course of the stream that flowed beneath, and he came
</p>
<p>back with a posey of sweet jonquils set off with a delicate
</p>
<p>kind of fern very pretty, and this he presents to Moll with
</p>
<p>a gracious little speech, which act, it seemed to me, was to
</p>
<p>let her know that he respected her still as a young gentle-
</p>
<p>woman in spite of her short petticoat, and Moll was not dull
</p>
<p>to the compliment neither; for, after the first cry of delight
</p>
<p>in seeing these natural dainty flowers (she loving such
</p>
<p>things beyond all else in the world), she bethought her to
</p>
<p>make him a curtsey and reply to his speech with another as
</p>
<p>good and well turned, as she set them in her waist scarf.
</p>
<p>Also I remember on this road we saw oranges and lemons
</p>
<p>growing for the first time, but full a mile after Moll had
</p>
<p>first caught their wondrous perfume in the air. And these
</p>
<p>trees, which are about the size of a crab tree, grew in
</p>
<p>close groves on either side of the road, with no manner of
</p>
<p>fence to protect them, so that any one is lief to pluck what
</p>
<p>he may without let, so plentiful are they, and curious to
</p>
<p>see how fruit and blossom grow together on the same bush,
</p>
<p>the lemons, as I hear, giving four crops in the year, and
</p>
<p>more delicious, full, and juicy than any to be bought in
</p>
<p>England at six to the groat.
</p>
<p>We got a dinner of bread and cheese (very high) at a

</p>
<p>kind, but excellent good wine with dried figs and walnuts,
</p>
<p>which is the natural food of this country, where one may go
</p>
<p>a week without touching flesh and yet feel as strong and
</p>
<p>hearty at the end. And here very merry, Jack in his per-
</p>
<p>tinacious, stubborn spirit declaring he would drink his wine
</p>
<p>in the custom of the country or none at all, and so lifting up
</p>
<p>the spouted mug at arm's length he squirts the liquor all
</p>
<p>over his face, down his new clothes and everywhere
</p>
<p>but into his mouth, before he could arrive to do it
</p>
<p>like Don Sanchez; but getting into the trick of it, he so
</p>
<p>mighty proud of his achievement that he must drink pot
</p>
<p>after pot until he got as drunk as any lord. So after that,
</p>
<p>finding a retired place, it being midday and prodigious
</p>
<p>hot (though only now in mid-April), we lay down under
</p>
<p>the orange trees and slept a long hour, to our great refresh-
</p>
<p>ment. Dawson on waking remembered nothing of his
</p>
<p>being drunk, and felt not one penny the worse for it.
</p>
<p>And so on another long stretch through sweet country,
</p>
<p>with here and there a glimpse of the Mediterranean, in the
</p>
<p>distance, of a surprising blueness, before we reached
</p>
<p>another town, and that on the top of a high hill. But it
</p>
<p>seems that all the towns in these parts (save those armed
</p>
<p>with fortresses) are thus built for security against the
</p>
<p>pirates, who ravage the seaboard of this continent inces-
</p>
<p>santly from end to end. And for this reason the roads
</p>
<p>leading up to the town are made very narrow, tortuous, and
</p>
<p>difficult, with watch-towers in places, and many points
</p>
<p>where a few armed men lying in ambush may overwhelm
</p>
<p>an enemy ten times as strong. The towns themselves are
</p>
<p>fortified with gates, the streets extremely narrow and

<p>crooked, and the houses massed all together with secret

</p>
<p>passages one to another, and a network of little alleys lead-
</p>
<p>ing whither only the inhabitants knew, so that if an enemy
</p>
<p>do get into them 'tis ten to one he will never come out alive.
</p>
<p>It being market day in this town, here Jack and his
</p>
<p>daughter gave a show of dancing, first in their French
</p>
<p>suits, which were vastly admired, and after in their
</p>
<p>Spanish clothes; but then they were asked to dance a
</p>
<p>fandango, which they could not. However, we fared
</p>
<p>very well, getting the value of five shillings in little
</p>
<p>moneys, and the innkeepers would take nothing for our
</p>
<p>entertainment, because of the custom we had brought his
</p>
<p>house, which we considered very handsome on his part.
</p>
<p>We set out again the next morning, but having shown
</p>
<p>how we passed the first day I need not dwell upon those
</p>
<p>which followed before we reached Barcelona, there being
</p>
<p>nothing of any great importance to tell. Only Moll was
</p>
<p>now all agog to learn the Spanish dances, and I cannot
</p>
<p>easily forget how, after much coaxing and wheedling on
</p>
<p>her part, she at length persuaded Don Sanchez to show her
</p>
<p>a fandango; for, surely, nothing in the world was ever
</p>
<p>more comic than this stately Don, without any music, and
</p>
<p>in the middle of the high road, cutting capers, with a
</p>
<p>countenance as solemn as any person at a burying. No
</p>
<p>one could be more quick to observe the ludicrous than he,
</p>
<p>nor more careful to avoid ridicule; therefore it said much
</p>
<p>for Moll's cajolery, or for the love he bore her even at this
</p>
<p>time, to thus expose himself to Dawson's rude mirth and
</p>
<p>mine in order to please her.
</p>
<p>We reached Barcelona the 25th of April, and there we
</p>
<p>stayed till the ist of May, for Moll would go no further

<p>before she had learnt a bolero and a fandango which
</p>
<p>THE SPANIARDS A GENEROUS NATURAL PEOPLE. 85
</p>
<p>dances we saw danced at a little theatre excellently well,
</p>
<p>but in a style quite different to ours, and the women very
</p>
<p>fat and plain. And though Moll, being but a slight slip of
</p>
<p>a lass, in whom the warmer passions were unbegotten,
</p>
<p>could not give the bolero the voluptuous fervour of the
</p>
<p>Spanish dancers, yet in agility and in pretty innocent grace
</p>
<p>she did surpass them all to nought, which was abundantly
</p>
<p>proved when she danced it in our posada before a court
</p>
<p>full of Spaniards, for there they were like mad over her,
</p>
<p>casting their silk handkerchiefs at her feet in homage, and
</p>
<p>filling Jack's tambourine three times over with cigarros and
</p>
<p>a plentiful scattering of rials. And I believe, had we stayed
</p>
<p>there, we might have made more money than ever we
</p>
<p>wanted at that time though not so much as Don Sanchez
</p>
<p>had set his mind on; wherefore he would have us jogging
</p>
<p>again as soon as Moll could be brought to it.
</p>
<p>From Barcelona, we journeyed a month to Valencia,
</p>
<p>growing more indolent with our easier circumstances, and
</p>
<p>sometimes trudging no more than five or six miles in a day.
</p>
<p>And we were, I think, the happiest, idlest set of vagabonds
</p>
<p>in existence. But, indeed, in this country there is not
</p>
<p>that spur to exertion which is for ever goading us in this.
</p>
<p>The sun fills one's heart with content, and for one's other
</p>
<p>wants a few halfpence a day will suffice, and if you have
</p>
<p>them not 'tis no such great matter. For these people are
</p>
<p>exceeding kind and hospitable; they will give you a meas-
</p>
<p>ure of wine if you are thirsty, as we would give a mug of
</p>
<p>water, and the poorest man will not sit down to table with-
</p>
<p>out making you an offer to share what he has. Wherever
</p>
<p>we went we were well received, and in those poor villages

<p>where they had no money to give they would pay us for our

<p>86 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>show in kind, one giving us bed, another board, and filling
</p>
<p>our wallets ere we left 'em with the best they could afford.
</p>
<p>'Twas our habit to walk a few miles before dinner, to
</p>
<p>sleep in the shade during the heat of the day, and to reach
</p>
<p>a town (if possible) by the fall of the sun. There would
</p>
<p>we spend half the night in jollity, and lie abed late in the
</p>
<p>morning. The inns and big houses in these parts are built
</p>
<p>in the form of squares, enclosing an open court with a
</p>
<p>sort of arcade all round, and mostly with a grape-vine running
</p>
<p>over the sunnier side, and in this space we used to give our
</p>
<p>performance, by the light of oil lamps hung here and there
</p>
<p>conveniently, with the addition, maybe, of moonlight re-
</p>
<p>flected from one of the white walls. Here any one was free
</p>
<p>to enter, we making no charge, but taking only what they
</p>
<p>would freely give. And this treatment engenders a feeling
</p>
<p>of kindness on both sides (very different to our sentiment
</p>
<p>at home, where we players as often as not dread the audi-
</p>
<p>ence as a kind of enemy, ready to tear us to pieces if we
</p>
<p>fail to please), and ours was as great a pleasure to amuse
</p>
<p>as theirs to be amused. I can recall to mind nothing of
</p>
<p>any moment occurring on this journey, save that we spent
</p>
<p>some time every day in perfecting our Spanish dances, I
</p>
<p>getting to play the tunes correctly, which at first I made
</p>
<p>sad bungling of, and Dawson in learning of his steps. Also,
</p>
<p>he and Moll acquired the use of a kind of clappers, called
</p>
<p>costagnettes, which they play with their hands in these
</p>
<p>fandangos and boleros, with a very pleasing effect.
</p>
<p>At Valencia we stayed a week and three days, lingering
</p>
<p>more than was necessary, in order to see a bull-fight. And
</p>
<p>this pastime they do not as we with dogs, but with men,

<p>and the bull quite free, and, save for the needless killing

</p>
<p>of horses, I think this a very noble exercise, being a fair
</p>
<p>trial of human address against brute force. And 'tis not
</p>
<p>nearly so beastly as seeing a prize fought by men, and not
</p>
<p>more cruel, I take it, than the shooting of birds and hares
</p>
<p>for sport, seeing that the agony of death is no greater for a
</p>
<p>sturdy bull than for a timid coney, and hath this advantage,
</p>
<p>that the bull, when exhausted, is despatched quickly,
</p>
<p>whereas the bird or hare may just escape capture, to die a
</p>
<p>miserable long death with a shattered limb.
</p>
<p>From Valencia we travelled five weeks (growing, I think,
</p>
<p>more lazy every day), over very hilly country to Alicante,
</p>
<p>a seaport town very strongly protected by a castle on a
</p>
<p>great rock, armed with guns of brass and iron, so that the
</p>
<p>pirates dare never venture near. And here I fully thought
</p>
<p>we were to dawdle away another week at the least, this
</p>
<p>being a very populous and lively city, promising much
</p>
<p>entertainment. For Moll, when not playing herself, was
</p>
<p>mad to see others play, and she did really govern, with her
</p>
<p>subtle wiles and winning smiles, more than her father, for
</p>
<p>all his masterful spirit, or Don Sanchez with his stern
</p>
<p>authority. But seeing two or three English ships in the
</p>
<p>port, the Don deemed it advisable that we should push on
</p>
<p>at once for Elche, and, to our great astonishment, Moll
</p>
<p>consented to our speedy going without demur, though why,
</p>
<p>we could not then discover,' but did soon after, as I shall

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI.
</p>
<p>Of our first coming to Elche and the strangeness of that city.
</p>
<p>BEING resolved to our purpose overnight, we set out fairly
</p>
<p>early in the morning for Elche, which lies half a dozen leagues
</p>
<p>or thereabouts to the west of Alicante. Our way lay through
</p>
<p>gardens of oranges and spreading vineyards, which flourish
</p>
<p>exceedingly in this part, being protected from unkind winds
</p>
<p>by high mountains against the north and east; and here
</p>
<p>you shall picture us on the white, dusty road, Moll leading
</p>
<p>the way a dozen yards in advance, a tambourine slung on
</p>
<p>her back with streaming ribbons of many colours, taking two
</p>
<p>or three steps on one foot, and then two or three steps on
</p>
<p>t'other, with a Spanish twist of her hips at each turn, swing-
</p>
<p>ing her arms as she claps her costagnettes to the air of a
</p>
<p>song she had picked up at Barcelona, and we three men
</p>
<p>plodding behind, the Don with a guitar across his back,
</p>
<p>Dawson with our bundle of clothes, and I with a wallet of
</p>
<p>provisions hanging o' one side and a skin of wine on the
</p>
<p>other and all as white as any millers with the dust of Moll's
</p>
<p>dancing.
</p>
<p>" It might be as well," says Don Sanchez, in his solemn,
</p>
<p>deliberate manner, " if Mistress Moll were advised to prac-
</p>
<p>tise her steps in our rear."
</p>
<p>" Aye, Sefior," replied Dawson, " I've been of the same
</p>
<p>mind these last ten minutes. But with your consent, Don

</p>
<p>Sanchez, I'll put her to a more serious exercise."
</p>
<p>SERIOUS DISCOURSE OF JACK DAWSON. 89
</p>
<p>The Don consenting with a bov Jack continues :
</p>
<p>" You may have observed that I haven't opened my lips
</p>
<p>since we left the town, and the reason thereof is that I've
</p>
<p>been turning over in my mind whether, having come thus
</p>
<p>far, it would not be advisable to let my Moll know of our
</p>
<p>project. Because, if she should refuse, the sooner we con-
</p>
<p>sider some other plan, the better, seeing that now she is in
</p>
<p>good case and as careless as a bird on the bough, and she
</p>
<p>is less tractable to our purposes than when she felt the pinch
</p>
<p>of hunger and cold and would have jumped at anything for
</p>
<p>a bit of comfort."
</p>
<p>" Does she not know of our design? " asks the Don, lift-
</p>
<p>ing his eyebrows.
</p>
<p>" No more than the man in the moon, Seiior," answers
</p>
<p>Jack. " For, though Kit and I may have discoursed of it at
</p>
<p>odd times, we have been mighty careful to shut our mouths
</p>
<p>or talk of a fine day at her approach."
</p>
<p>" Very good," says Don Sanchez. " You are her father."
</p>
<p>" And she shall know it," says Jack, with resolution, and
</p>
<p>taking a stride or two in advance he calls to her to give over
</p>
<p>dancing and come to him.
</p>
<p>" Have you forgot your breeding," he asks as she turns
</p>
<p>and waits for him, " that you have no more respect for your
</p>
<p>elders than to choke 'em with dust along of your shuffling? "
</p>
<p>"What a thoughtless thing am I ! " cries she, in a voice of
</p>
<p>contrition. " Why, you're floured as white as a shade ! "
</p>
<p>Then taking up a corner of her waist-shawl, she gently
</p>
<p>rubs away the dust from the tip of his nose, so that it stood
</p>
<p>out glowing red from his face like a cherry through a hole
</p>
<p>in a pie-crust, at which she claps her hands and rings out a

</p>
<p>peal of laughter.
</p>
<p>9O A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>" I counted to make a lady of you, Moll," says Jack, in
</p>
<p>sorrow, " but I see plainly you will ever be a fool, and so
</p>
<p>'tis to no purpose to speak seriously."
</p>
<p>" Surely, father, I have ever been what you wish me to be,"
</p>
<p>answers she, demurely, curious now to know what he would
</p>
<p>be telling her.
</p>
<p>" Then do you put them plaguy clappers away, and listen
</p>
<p>to me patiently," says he.
</p>
<p>Moll puts her hands behind her, and drawing a long lip
</p>
<p>and casting round eyes at us over her shoulder, walks along
</p>
<p>very slowly by her father's side, while he broaches the
</p>
<p>matter to her. And this he did with some difficulty (for 'tis
</p>
<p>no easy thing to make a roguish plot look innocent), as we
</p>
<p>could see by his shifting his bundle from one shoulder to
</p>
<p>the other now and again, scratching his ear and the like ;
</p>
<p>but what he said, we, walking a pace or two behind, could
</p>
<p>not catch, he dropping to a very low tone as if ashamed to
</p>
<p>hear his own voice. To all he has to tell she listens very
</p>
<p>attentively, but in the end she says something which causes
</p>
<p>him to stop dead short and turn upon her gaping like a pig.
</p>
<p>" What ! " he cries as we came up. "You knew all this
</p>
<p>two months ago? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, father," answers she, primly, "quite two months."
</p>
<p>" And pray who told you? " he asks.
</p>
<p>" No one, father, since you forbade me to ask questions.
</p>
<p>But though I may be dumb to oblige you, I can't be deaf.
</p>
<p>Kit and you are for ever a-talking of it."
</p>
<p>"Maybe, child," says Dawson, mightily nettled. "Maybe
</p>
<p>you know why we left Alicante this morning."
</p>
<p>" I should be dull indeed if I didn't," answers she. " And

<p>if you hadn't said when we saw the ships that we might meet
</p>
<p>MOLL AS RIPE FOR KNAVERY AS ANY. QI
</p>
<p>more Englishmen in the town than we might care to know
</p>
<p>hereafter, why, well, maybe we should have been in
</p>
<p>Alicante now."
</p>
<p>" By denying yourself that satisfaction," says Don Sanchez,
</p>
<p>" we may conclude that the future we are making for you is
</p>
<p>not unacceptable."
</p>
<p>Moll stopped and says with some passion :
</p>
<p>" I would turn back now and go over those mountains the
</p>
<p>way we came to ride through France in my fine gown like a
</p>
<p>lady."
</p>
<p>" Brava ! bravamente ! " says the Don, in a low voice, as
</p>
<p>she steps on in front of us, holding her head high with the
</p>
<p>recollection of her former state.
</p>
<p>" She was ever like that," whispers Dawson, with pride.
</p>
<p>"We could never get her to play a mean part willingly;
</p>
<p>could we, Kit? She was for ever wanting the part of a
</p>
<p>queen writ for her."
</p>
<p>The next day about sundown, coming to a little eminence,
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez points out a dark patch of forest lying betwixt
</p>
<p>us and the mountains, and says :
</p>
<p>"That is Elche, the place where we are to stay some
</p>
<p>months."
</p>
<p>We could make out no houses at all, but he told us the

<p>Algerine or Spaniard, but each was free to come and go as
</p>
<p>he pleased, etc., and this did somewhat reassure us, though
</p>
<p>we had all been more content to see our destination on the
</p>
<p>crest of a high hill.
</p>
<p>From this point we came in less than half an hour to
</p>
<p>Santa Pola, a small village, but very bustling, for here the
</p>
<p>cart-road from Alicante ends, all transport of commodities
</p>
<p>betwixt this and Elche being done on mules ; so here great
</p>
<p>commotion of carriers setting down and taking up merchan-
</p>
<p>dise, and the way choked with carts and mules and a very
</p>
<p>babel of tongues, there being Moors here as well as Span-
</p>
<p>iards, and all shouting their highest to be the better under-
</p>
<p>stood of each other. These were the first Moors we had
</p>
<p>seen, but they did not encourage us with great hopes of
</p>
<p>more intimate acquaintance, wearing nothing but a kind of
</p>
<p>long, ragged shirt to their heels, with a hood for their heads
</p>
<p>in place of a hat, and all mighty foul with grease and dirt.
</p>
<p>Being astir betimes the next morning, we reached Elche
</p>
<p>before midday, and here we seemed to be in another world,
</p>
<p>for this region is no more like Spain than Spain is like our
</p>
<p>own country. Entering the forest, we found ourselves en-
</p>
<p>compassed on all sides by prodigious high palm trees, which
</p>
<p>hitherto we had seen only singly here and there, cultivated
</p>
<p>as curiosities. And noble trees they are, standing eighty to
</p>
<p>a hundred feet high, with never a branch, but only a great
</p>
<p>spreading crown of leaves, with strings of dates hanging
</p>
<p>down from their midst. Beneath, in marshy places, grew
</p>
<p>sugar-canes as high as any haystack; and elsewhere were
</p>
<p>patches of rice, which grows like corn with us, but thrives
</p>
<p>well in the shade, curiously watered by artificial streams of

</p>
<p>water. And for hedges to their property, these Moors have
</p>
<p>ELCHE A MOST CURIOUS TOWN. 93
</p>
<p>agaves, with great spiky leaves which no man can penetrate,
</p>
<p>and other strange plants, whereof I will mention only one,
</p>
<p>they call the fig of Barbary, which is no fig at all, but a
</p>
<p>thing having large, fleshy leaves, growing one out of the
</p>
<p>other, with fruit and flower sprouting out of the edges, and
</p>
<p>all monstrous prickly. To garnish and beautify this formi-
</p>
<p>dable defence, nature had cast over all a network of creeping
</p>
<p>herbs with most extraordinary flowers, delightful both to see
</p>
<p>and smell, but why so prickly, no man can say.
</p>
<p>"Surely, this must be paradise," cries Moll, staying to
</p>
<p>look around her.
</p>
<p>And we were of the same thinking, until we came to the
</p>
<p>town, which, as I have said, lies in the midst of this forest,
</p>
<p>and then all our hopes and expectations were dashed to the
</p>
<p>ground. For we had looked to find a city in keeping with
</p>
<p>these surroundings, of fairy palaces and stately mansions ;
</p>
<p>in place whereof was nought but a wilderness of mean, low,
</p>
<p>squalid houses, with meandering, ill-paved alleys, and all past
</p>
<p>everything for unsavoury smells, heaps of refuse lying be-
</p>
<p>fore every door, stark naked brats of children screaming
</p>
<p>everywhere, and a pack of famished dogs snapping at our
</p>
<p>heels.
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez leads the way, we following, with rueful
</p>
<p>looks one at the other, till we reach the market-place, and
</p>
<p>there he takes us into a house of entertainment, where a
</p>
<p>dozen Moors are squatting on their haunches in groups
</p>
<p>about sundry bowls of a smoking mess, called cuscusson,
</p>
<p>which is a kind of paste with a little butter in it and a store
</p>
<p>of spices. Their manner of eating it is simple enough :
</p>
<p>each man dips his hand in the pot, takes out a handful,

</p>
<p>he eats it with all the gusto in the world. For our repast
</p>
<p>we were served with a joint of roast mutton, and this being
</p>
<p>cut up, we had to take up in our hands and eat like any
</p>
<p>savages, their religion denying these Moors anything but
</p>
<p>the bare necessities of life. Also, their law forbids the
</p>
<p>drinking of wine, which did most upset Jack Dawson, he
</p>
<p>having for drink with his meat nothing but the choice of
</p>
<p>water and sour milk ; but which he liked least I know not,
</p>
<p>for he would touch neither, saying he would rather go dry
</p>
<p>any day than be poisoned with such liquor.
</p>
<p>Whilst we were at our meal, a good many Moors came
</p>
<p>in to stare at us, as at a raree show, and especially at Moll,
</p>
<p>whose bright clothes and loose hair excited their curiosity,
</p>
<p>for their women do rarely go abroad, except they be old,
</p>
<p>and wear only long dirty white robes, muffling the lower
</p>
<p>part of their faces. None of them smiled, and it is notice-
</p>
<p>able that these people, like our own Don, do never laugh,
</p>
<p>taking such demonstration as a sign of weak understanding
</p>
<p>and foolishness, but watching all our actions very intently.
</p>
<p>And presently an old Moor, with a white beard and more
</p>
<p>cleanly dressed than the rest, pushing the crowd aside to
</p>
<p>see what was forward, recognised Don Sanchez, who at
</p>
<p>once rose to his feet ; we, not to be behind him in good
</p>
<p>manners, rising also.
</p>
<p>"May Baba," says the old Moor; and repeating this
</p>
<p>phrase thrice (which is a sure sign of hearty welcome), he
</p>
<p>claps the Don's hand, without shaking it, and lays his own
</p>
<p>upon his breast, the Don doing likewise. Then Don San-
</p>
<p>chez, introducing us as we understood by his gestures, the
</p>
<p>old Moor bends his head gravely, putting his right hand

</p>
<p>two foremost fingers laid across his lips, we replying as best
</p>
<p>we could with a bowing and scraping. These formalities
</p>
<p>concluded, the Don and the old Moor walk apart, and we
</p>
<p>squat down again to our mutton bones.
</p>
<p>After a lengthy discussion the old Moor goes, and Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez, having paid the reckoning, leads us out of the
</p>
<p>town by many crooked alleys and cross-passages ; he speak-
</p>
<p>ing never a word, and we asking no questions, but marvelling
</p>
<p>exceedingly what is to happen next. And, following a wall
</p>
<p>overhung by great palms, we turn a corner, and find there
</p>
<p>our old Moor standing beside an open door with a key in
</p>
<p>his hand. The old Moor gives the key into Don Sanchez's
</p>
<p>hand, and with a very formal salutation, leaves us.
</p>
<p>Then following the Don through the doorway, we find
</p>
<p>ourselves in a spacious garden, but quite wild for neglect ;
</p>
<p>flower and weed and fruit all mingling madly together, but
</p>
<p>very beautiful to my eye, nevertheless, for the abundance
</p>
<p>of colour, the richness of the vegetables, and the graceful
</p>
<p>forms of the adjacent palms.
</p>
<p>A house stood in the midst of this wilderness, and thither
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez picked his way, we at his heels still too amazed
</p>
<p>to speak. Beside the house was a well with a little wall
</p>
<p>about it, and seating himself on this, Don Sanchez opens
</p>
<p>his lips for the first time.
</p>
<p>" My friend, Sidi ben Ahmed, has offered me the use of
</p>
<p>this place as long as we choose to stay here," says he. " Go
</p>

</p>
<p>CHAPTER X,I.
</p>
<p>Hcnv Don Sanchez very honestly offers to free us of our bargain if ive
</p>
<p>will ; but we will not.
</p>
<p>THE house, like nearly all Moo-ish houses of this class,
</p>
<p>was simply one large and lofty room, with a domed ceiling
</p>
<p>built of very thick masonry, to resist the heat of the sun.
</p>
<p>There was neither window nor chimney, the door serving
</p>
<p>to admit light and air, and let out the smoke if a fire were
</p>
<p>lighted within. One half of this chamber was dug out to
</p>
<p>a depth of a couple of feet, for the accommodation of cattle
</p>
<p>(the litter being thrown into the hollow as it is needed, and
</p>
<p>nought removed till it reaches the level of the other floor),
</p>
<p>and above this, about eight feet from the ground and four
</p>
<p>from the roof, was a kind of shelf (the breadth and length
</p>
<p>of that half), for the storage of fodder and a sleeping-place
</p>
<p>for the inhabitants, with no kind of partition, or any issue
</p>
<p>for the foul air from the cattle below.
</p>
<p>"Are we to live a year in this hutch?'' asks Moll, in
</p>
<p>affright.
</p>
<p>"Have done with your chatter, Moll!" answers Jack,
</p>
<p>testily. "Don't you see I'm a-thinking? Heaven knows
</p>
<p>there's enough to swallow without any bugbears of your
</p>
<p>raising."
</p>
<p>With that, having finished his inspection of the interior,
</p>
<p>he goes out and looks at it outside.
</p>
<p>"Well," says Don Sanchez, "what think you of the
</p>
<p>house?"

<p>ENTER INTO MOST SERIOUS DISCUSSION. Q/
</p>
<p>"Why, Senor, 'tis no worse as I can see than any other
</p>
<p>in these parts, and hath this advantage, which they have
</p>
<p>not, of being in a sweet air. With a bit of contrivance we
</p>
<p>could make a shift to live here well enough. We should not
</p>
<p>do amiss neither for furniture, seeing that 'tis the custom of
</p>
<p>the country to eat off the floor and sit upon nothing. A pot
</p>
<p>to cook victuals in is about all we need in that way. But
</p>
<p>how we are to get anything to .cook in it is one mystery,
</p>
<p>and " (clacking his tongue) "what we are going to drink is
</p>
<p>another, neither of which I can fathom. For, look you,
</p>
<p>Senor, if one may judge of men's characters by their faces
</p>
<p>or of their means by their habitations, we may dance our
</p>
<p>legs off ere ever these Moors will bestow a penny piece
</p>
<p>upon us, and as for their sour milk, I'd as lief drink hem-
</p>
<p>lock, and liefer. Now, if this town had been as we counted
</p>
<p>on, like Barcelona, all had gone as merry as a marriage
</p>
<p>bell, for then might we have gained enough to keep us in
</p>
<p>jollity as long as you please; but here, if we die not of
</p>
<p>the colicks in a week, 'twill be to perish of starvation in a
</p>
<p>fortnight. What say you, Kit? "
</p>
<p>I was forced to admit that I had never seen a town less
</p>
<p>likely to afford a subsistence than this.
</p>
<p>Then Don Sanchez, having heard us with great patience,
</p>
<p>and waited a minute to see if we could raise any further
</p>
<p>objections, answers us in measured tones.
</p>
<p>"I doubt not," says he, "that with a little ingenuity you
</p>
<p>may make the house habitable and this wilderness agreea-
</p>
<p>ble. My friend, Sidi ben Ahmed, has offered to provide
</p>
<p>us with what commodities are necessary to that end. I
</p>
<p>agree with you that it would be impossible to earn the
</p>
<p>meanest livelihood here by dancing; it would not be ad-

</p>
<p>visable if we could. For that reason, my knowledge of
</p>
<p>various tongues making me very serviceable to Sidi ben
</p>
<p>Ahmed (who is the most considerable merchant of this
</p>
<p>town), I have accepted an office in his house. This will
</p>
<p>enable me to keep my engagement with you. You will
</p>
<p>live at my charge, as I promised, and you shall want for
</p>
<p>nothing in reason. If the Moors drink no wine them-
</p>
<p>selves, they make excellent for those who will, and you
</p>
<p>shall not be stinted in that particular."
</p>
<p>"Come, this sounds fair enough," cries Dawson. "But
</p>
<p>pray, Senor, are we to do nothing for our keep? "
</p>
<p>"Nothing beyond what we came here to do," replies he,
</p>
<p>with a meaning glance at Moll.
</p>
<p>"What!" cries poor Moll, in pain. "We are to dance
</p>
<p>no more ! "
</p>
<p>The Don shook his head gravely; and, remembering the
</p>
<p>jolly, vagabond, careless, adventurous life we had led these
</p>
<p>past two months and more, with a thousand pleasant inci-
</p>
<p>dents of our happy junketings, we were all downcast at the
</p>
<p>prospect of living in this place though a paradise for
</p>
<p>a year without change.
</p>
<p>"Though I promised you no more than I offer," says the
</p>
<p>Don, "yet if this prospect displease you, we will cry quits
</p>
<p>and part here. Nay," adds he, taking a purse from his
</p>
<p>pocket, " I will give you the means to return to Alicante,
</p>
<p>where you may live as better pleases you."
</p>
<p>It seemed to me that there was an unfeigned carelessness
</p>
<p>in his manner, as if he would as lief as not throw up this
</p>
<p>hazardous enterprise for some other more sure undertaking.
</p>
<p>And, indeed, I believe he was then balancing another

</p>
<p>alternative in his mind.
</p>
<p>WE WILL NOT GO FROM OUR BARGAIN. 99
</p>
<p>At this generous offer Moll dashed away the tears that
</p>
<p>had sprung to her eyes, brightening up wonderfully, but
</p>
<p>then, casting her eyes upon the Don, her face fell again as
</p>
<p>at the thought of leaving him. For we all admired him,
</p>
<p>and she prodigiously, for his great reserve and many good
</p>
<p>qualities which commanded respect, and this feeling was
</p>
<p>tinged in her case, I believe, with a kind of growing
</p>
<p>affection.
</p>
<p>Seeing this sentiment in her eyes, the Don was clearly
</p>
<p>touched by it, and so, laying his hand gently on her shoul-
</p>
<p>der, he says :
</p>
<p>" My poor child, remember you the ugly old women we
</p>
<p>saw dancing at Barcelona? They were not more than
</p>
<p>forty; what will they be like in a few years? Who will
</p>
<p>tolerate them ? who love them ? Is that the end you choose
</p>
<p>for your own life that the estate to which our little prin-
</p>
<p>cess shall fall?"
</p>
<p>"No, no, no!" cries she, in a passion, clenching her
</p>
<p>little hands and throwing up her head in disdain.
</p>
<p>"And no, no, no, say I," cries Dawson. "Were our
</p>
<p>case ten times as bad, I'd not go back from my word. As
</p>
<p>it is, we are not to be pitied, and I warrant ere long we
</p>
<p>make ourselves to be envied. Come, Kit, rouse you out of
</p>
<p>your lethargies, and let us consult how we may improve our
</p>
<p>condition here; and do you, Senor, pray order us a little
</p>
<p>of that same excellent wine you spoke of, if it be but a
</p>
<p>pint, when you feel disposed that way."
</p>
<p>The Don inclined his head, but lingered, talking to Moll
</p>
<p>very gravely, and yet tenderly, for some while, Dawson
</p>
<p>and I going into the house to see what we could make of

</p>
<p>it; and then, telling us we should see him no more till the
</p>
<p>IOO A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>next day, he left us. But for some time after he was gone
</p>
<p>Moll sat on the side of the well, very pensive and wistful,
</p>
<p>as one to whom the future was opened for the first
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>Anon comes a banging at our garden gate, which Moll had
</p>
<p>closed behind the Don; and, going to it, we find a Moor-
</p>
<p>ish boy with a barrow charged with many things. We
</p>
<p>could not understand a word he said, but Dawson decided
</p>
<p>these chattels were sent us by the Don, by perceiving a
</p>
<p>huge hogskin of wine, for which he thanked God and
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez an hundred times over. So these commodi-
</p>
<p>ties we carried up to the house, marvelling greatly at the
</p>
<p>Don's forethought and generosity, for here were a score of
</p>
<p>things over and above those we had already found ourselves
</p>
<p>lacking; namely, earthen pipkins and wooden vessels, a
</p>
<p>bag of charcoal, a box of carpenters' tools (which did
</p>
<p>greatly like Dawson, he having been bred a carpenter in
</p>
<p>his youth), instruments for gardening (to my pleasure, as
</p>
<p>I have ever had a taste for such employment), some very
</p>
<p>fine Moorish blankets, etc. So when the barrow was dis-
</p>
<p>charged, Dawson gives the lad some rials out of his pocket,
</p>
<p>which pleased him also mightily.
</p>
<p>Then, first of all, Dawson unties the leg of the hogskin,
</p>
<p>and draws off a quart of wine, very carefully securing the
</p>
<p>leg after, and this we drank to our great refreshment; and
</p>
<p>next Moll, being awoke from her dreams and eager to be
</p>
<p>doing, sets herself to sort out our goods, such as belong to
</p>
<p>us (as tools, etc.), on one side, and such as belong to her
</p>
<p>(as pipkins and the rest) on the other. Leaving her to
</p>
<p>this employment, Dawson and I, armed with a knife and

</p>
<p>stacked in one corner of the garden, and sorting out those
</p>
<p>most proper to our purpose, we lopped them all of an equal
</p>
<p>length, and shouldering as many as we could carried them
</p>
<p>up to our house. Here we found Moll mighty jubilant in
</p>
<p>having got her work done, and admirably she had done it,
</p>
<p>to be sure. For, having found a long recess in the wall,
</p>
<p>she had brushed it out clean with a whisp of herbs, and
</p>
<p>stored up her crocks according to their size, very artificial,
</p>
<p>with a dish of oranges plucked from the tree at our door
</p>
<p>on one side, and a dish of almonds on the other, a pipkin
</p>
<p>standing betwixt 'em with a handsome posey of roses in it.
</p>
<p>She had spread a mat on the floor, and folded up our fine
</p>
<p>blankets to serve for cushions; and all that did not belong
</p>
<p>to her she had bundled out of sight into that hollowed side
</p>
<p>I have mentioned as being intended for cattle.
</p>
<p>After we had sufficiently admired the performance, she
</p>
<p>told us she had a mind to give us a supper of broth.
</p>
<p>"But," says she, "the Don has forgotten that we must eat,
</p>
<p>and hath sent us neither bread nor flesh nor salt."
</p>
<p>This put us to a stumble, for how to get these things we
</p>
<p>knew not; but Moll declared she would get all she needed
</p>
<p>if we could only find the money.
</p>
<p>"Why, how?" asks Jack. "You know not their gib-
</p>
<p>berish."
</p>
<p>"That may be," answers she, "but I warrant the same
</p>
<p>language that bought me this petticoat will get us a supper."
</p>
<p>So we gave her what money we had, and she went off
</p>
<p>a-marketing, with as much confidence as if she were a born
</p>
<p>Barbary Moor. Then Jack falls to thanking God for bless-
</p>
<p>ing him with such a daughter, at the same time taking

<p>" Plague take the careless baggage ! she has spilled all
</p>
<p>our nails, and here's an hour's work to pick 'em up ! "
</p>
<p>This accident was repaired, however, and Moll's trans-
</p>
<p>gression forgotten when she returned with an old woman
</p>
<p>carrying her purchases. Then were we forced to admire
</p>
<p>her skill in this business, for she had bought all that was
</p>
<p>needful for a couple of meals, and yet had spent but half
</p>
<p>our money. Now arose the difficult question how to make
</p>
<p>a fire, and this Jack left us to settle by our own devices, he
</p>
<p>returning to his own occupation. Moll resolved we should
</p>
<p>do our cooking outside the house, so here we built up a
</p>
<p>kind of grate with stones; and, contriving to strike a spark
</p>
<p>with the back of a jack-knife and a stone, upon a heap of
</p>
<p>dried leaves, we presently blew up a fine flame, and feeding
</p>
<p>this with the ends of cane we had cut and some charcoal,
</p>
<p>we at last got a royal fire on which to set our pot of mutton.
</p>
<p>And into this pot we put rice and a multitude of herbs from
</p>
<p>the garden, which by the taste we thought might serve to
</p>
<p>make a savoury mess. And, indeed, when it began to boil,
</p>
<p>the odour was so agreeable that we would have Jack come
</p>
<p>out to smell it. And he having praised it very highly, we
</p>
<p>in return went in to look at his handiwork and praise that.
</p>
<p>This we could do very heartily and without hypocrisy, for
</p>
<p>he had worked well and made a rare good job, having
</p>
<p>built a very seemly partition across the room, by nailing
</p>
<p>of the canes perpendicularly to that kind of floor that hung
</p>
<p>over the hollowed portion, thus making us now three rooms
</p>
<p>out of one. At one end he had left an opening to enter

<p>that stood there, and these canes were set not so close
</p>
<p>together but that air and light could pass betwixt them, and
</p>
<p>yet from the outer side no eye could see within, which
</p>
<p>was very commodious. Also upon the floor above, he had
</p>
<p>found sundry bundles of soft dried leaves, and these, opened
</p>
<p>out upon the surface of both chambers, made a very sweet,
</p>
<p>convenient bed upon which to lie. Then Dawson offering
</p>
<p>Moll her choice, she took the upper floor for her chamber,
</p>
<p>leaving us two the lower; and so, it being near sundown
</p>
<p>by this time, we to our supper in the sweet, cool air of
</p>
<p>evening, all mightily content with one another, and not
</p>
<p>less satisfied with our stew, which was indeed most savoury
</p>
<p>and palatable. This done, we took a turn round our little
</p>
<p>domain, admiring the many strange and wonderful things
</p>
<p>that grew there (especially the figs, which, though yet
</p>
<p>green, were wondrous pleasant to eat) ; and I laying out my
</p>
<p>plans for the morrow, how to get this wilderness into order,
</p>
<p>tear out the worthless herbs, dig the soil, etc., Dawson' s
</p>
<p>thoughts running on the building of an outhouse for the
</p>
<p>accommodation of our wine, tools, and such like, and
</p>
<p>Moll meditating on dishes to give us for our repasts. And
</p>
<p>at length, when these divers subjects were no more to be
</p>
<p>discussed, we turned into our dormitories, and fell asleep

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII.
</p>
<p>A brief summary of those twelve months we spent at Elche.
</p>
<p>THE surprising activity with which we attacked our domes-
</p>
<p>tic business at Elche lasted about two days and a half,
</p>
<p>Dawson labouring at his shed, I at the cultivation of the
</p>
<p>garden, and Moll quitting her cooking and household affairs,
</p>
<p>as occasion permitted, to lend a helping hand first to her
</p>
<p>father and then to me. And as man, when this fever of
</p>
<p>enterprise is upon him, must for ever be seeking to add to
</p>
<p>his cares, we persuaded Don Sanchez to let us have two
</p>
<p>she-goats to stall in the shed and consume our waste herb-
</p>
<p>age, that we might have milk and get butter, which they do
</p>
<p>in these parts by shaking the cream in a skin bag (a method
</p>
<p>that seems simple enough till you have been shaking the
</p>
<p>bag for twenty minutes in vain on a sultry morning) with-
</p>
<p>out cost. But the novelty of the thing wearing off, our
</p>
<p>eagerness rapidly subsided, and so about the third day (as
</p>
<p>I say) , the heat being prodigious, we toiled with no spirit at all.
</p>
<p>Dawson was the first to speak his mind. Says he, com-
</p>
<p>ing to me whilst I was still sweating over my shovel :
</p>
<p>" I've done it, but hang me if I do more. There's a
</p>
<p>good piece of work worth thirty shillings of any man's
</p>
<p>money, but who'll give me a thank ye for it when we leave
</p>
<p>here next year? "
</p>
<p>And then he can find nothing better to do than fall
</p>
<p>a-commenting on my labours, saying there was but precious

</p>
<p>little to show for my efforts, that had he been in my place
</p>
<p>he would have ordered matters otherwise, and begun dig-
</p>
<p>ging t'other end, wagering that I should give up my job
</p>
<p>before it was quarter done, etc., all which was mighty dis-
</p>
<p>couraging and the more unpleasant because I felt there was
</p>
<p>a good deal of truth in what he said.
</p>
<p>Consequently, I felt a certain malicious enjoyment the
</p>
<p>next morning upon finding that the goats had burst out one
</p>
<p>side of his famous shed, and got loose into the garden, which
</p>
<p>enabled me to wonder that two such feeble creatures could
</p>
<p>undo such a good thirty shillings' worth of work, etc. But
</p>
<p>ere I was done galling him, I myself was mortified exceed-
</p>
<p>ingly to find these mischievous brutes had torn up all the
</p>
<p>plants I had set by the trees in the shade as worthy of culti-
</p>
<p>vation, which gave Jack a chance for jibing at me. But
</p>
<p>that which embittered us as much as anything was to have
</p>
<p>Moll holding her sides for laughter at our attempts to catch
</p>
<p>these two devilish goats, which to our cost we found were
</p>
<p>not so feeble, after all ; for getting one up in a corner, she
</p>
<p>raises herself up on her hind legs and brings her skull down
</p>
<p>with such a smack on my knee that I truly thought she had
</p>
<p>broke my cramp-bone, whilst t'other, taking Dawson in the
</p>
<p>ankles with her horns, as he was reaching forward to lay
</p>
<p>hold of her, lay him sprawling in our little stream of water.
</p>
<p>Nor do I think we should ever have captured them, but
</p>
<p>that, giving over our endeavours from sheer fatigue, they of
</p>
<p>their own accord sauntered into the shed for shelter from
</p>
<p>the sun, where Moll clapt to the door upon them, and set
</p>
<p>her back against the gap in the side, until her father came
</p>
<p>with a hammer and some stout nails to secure the planks.

</p>
<p>So for the rest of that day Jack and I lay on our backs in
</p>
<p>IO6 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>the shade, doing nothing, but exceedingly sore one against
</p>
<p>the other for these mischances.
</p>
<p>But our heart burnings ended not there ; for coming in to
</p>
<p>supper at sundown, Moll has nothing to offer us but dry
</p>
<p>bread and a dish of dates, which, though it be the common
</p>
<p>supper of the Moors in this place, was little enough to our
</p>
<p>satisfaction, as Dawson told her in pretty round terms, ask-
</p>
<p>ing her what she was good for if not to give us a meal fit for
</p>
<p>Christians, etc., and stating very explicitly what he would
</p>
<p>have her prepare for our dinner next day. Moll takes her
</p>
<p>upbraiding very humbly (which was ever a bad sign), and
</p>
<p>promises to be more careful of our comfort in the future.
</p>
<p>And so ended that day.
</p>
<p>The next morning Dawson and I make no attempt at
</p>
<p>work, but after breakfast, by common accord, stretch us
</p>
<p>out under the palms to meditate ; and there about half past
</p>
<p>ten, Don Sanchez, coming round to pay us a visit, finds us
</p>
<p>both sound asleep. A sudden exclamation from him aroused
</p>
<p>us, and as we stumbled to our feet, staring about us, we
</p>
<p>perceived Moll coming from the house, but so disfigured
</p>
<p>with smuts of charcoal all over her face and hands, we scarce
</p>
<p>knew her.
</p>
<p>" God's mercy ! " cries the Don. " What on earth have
</p>
<p>you been doing, child?"
</p>
<p>To which Moll replies with a curtsey :
</p>
<p>" I am learning to be a cook- wench, Senor, at my father's
</p>
<p>desire."
</p>
<p>"You are here," answers the Don, with a frown, " to learn
</p>
<p>to be a lady. If a cook- wench is necessary, you shall have
</p>
<p>one" (this to us), "and anything else that my means may

</p>
<p>ments ; but observe," adds he, turning on his heel, " we may
</p>
<p>have to stay here another twelvemonth, if my economies
</p>
<p>are not sufficient by the end of the first year to take us
</p>
<p>hence."
</p>
<p>This hint brought us to our senses very quickly, and over-
</p>
<p>taking him ere he reached our garden gate, Dawson and I
</p>
<p>assured the Don we had no need of any servant, and would
</p>
<p>be careful that Moll henceforth did no menial office ; that
</p>
<p>we would tax his generosity no more than we could help,
</p>
<p>etc., to our great humiliation when we came to reflect on
</p>
<p>our conduct.
</p>
<p>Thenceforth Dawson charged himself with the internal
</p>
<p>economy of the house, and I with that part which concerned
</p>
<p>the custody and care of the goats, the cultivation of pot-
</p>
<p>herbs and with such instruction of Moll in the Italian tongue
</p>
<p>as I could command. But to tell the truth, we neither of
</p>
<p>us did one stroke of work beyond what was absolutely nec-
</p>
<p>essary, and especially Dawson, being past everything for
</p>
<p>indolence, did so order his part that from having two dishes
</p>
<p>of flesh a day, we came, ere long, to getting but one mess a
</p>
<p>week; he forcing himself and us to be content with dates
</p>
<p>and bread for our repasts, rather than give himself the
</p>
<p>trouble of boiling a pot. Beyond browsing my goats,
</p>
<p>drawing their milk (the making of butter I quickly re-
</p>
<p>nounced), and watering my garden night and morn (which
</p>
<p>is done by throwing water from the little stream broadcast
</p>
<p>with a shovel on either side), I did no more than Dawson,
</p>
<p>but joined him in yawning the day away, for which my sole
</p>
<p>excuse is the great heat of this region, which doth beget
</p>
<p>most slothful humours in those matured in cooler climes.

<p>With Moll, however, the case was otherwise; for she,
</p>
<p>IO8 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>being young and of an exceeding vivacious, active dispo-
</p>
<p>sition, must for ever be doing of something, and lucky for us
</p>
<p>when it was not some mischievous trick at our expense as
</p>
<p>letting the goats loose, shaking lemons down on our heads
</p>
<p>as we lay asleep beneath it, and the like. Being greatly
</p>
<p>smitten with the appearance of the Moorish women (who,
</p>
<p>though they are not permitted to wander about at will like
</p>
<p>our women, are yet suffered to fetch water from the public
</p>
<p>fountains), she surprised us one morning by coming forth
</p>
<p>dressed in their mode. And this dress, which seems to be
</p>
<p>nought but a long sheet wound loosely twice or thrice about
</p>
<p>the body, buckled on the shoulder, with holes for the arms
</p>
<p>to be put through in the manner of the old Greeks, became
</p>
<p>her surprisingly ; and we noticed then for the first time that
</p>
<p>her arms were rounder and fuller than when we had last
</p>
<p>seen them bare. Then, to get the graceful, noble bearing
</p>
<p>of the Moors, she practised day after day carrying a
</p>
<p>pitcher of water on her head as they do, until she could do
</p>
<p>this with perfect ease and sureness. In this habit the Don,
</p>
<p>who was mightily pleased with her looks, took her to the
</p>
<p>house of his friend and employer, Sidi ben Ahmed, where
</p>
<p>she ingratiated herself so greatly with the women of his
</p>
<p>household that they would have her come to them again
</p>
<p>the next day, and after that the next, indeed, thenceforth
</p>
<p>she spent far more of her time with these new friends than
</p>
<p>with us. And here, from the necessity of making herself
</p>
<p>understood, together with an excellent memory and a
</p>
<p>natural aptitude, she learned to speak the Moorish tongue
</p>
<p>in a marvellously short space of time. Dawson and I were
</p>
<p>frequently asked to accompany Moll, and we went twice to

</p>
<p>this house, which, though nothing at all to look at outside,
</p>
<p>UNCOMMON INDOLENT, BUT DISSATISFIED. IOQ
</p>
<p>was very magnificently furnished within, and the entertain-
</p>
<p>ment most noble. But Lord ! 'twas the most tedious, weari-
</p>
<p>some business for us, who could make out never a word of
</p>
<p>the civil speeches offered us without the aid of Don Sanchez
</p>
<p>and Moll, and then could think of no witty response, but
</p>
<p>could only sit there grinning like Gog and Magog. Still, it
</p>
<p>gave us vast pleasure to see how Moll carried herself with
</p>
<p>this company, talking as freely as they, yet holding herself
</p>
<p>with the dignity of an equal, and delighting all by her
</p>
<p>vivacity and sly, pretty ways.
</p>
<p>I think no country in Europe can be richer than this
</p>
<p>Elche in fruits and vegetation, more beautiful in its sur-
</p>
<p>rounding aspects of plain and mountain, more blessed with
</p>
<p>constant, glorious sunlight ; and the effect of these charms
</p>
<p>upon the quick, receptive spirit of our Molly was like a
</p>
<p>gentle May upon a nightingale, so that the days were all too
</p>
<p>short for her enjoyment, and she must need vent her happi-
</p>
<p>ness in song; but on us they made no more impression
</p>
<p>than on two owls in a tower, nay, if anything they did add to
</p>
<p>that weariness which arose from our lack of occupation.
</p>
<p>For here was no contrast in our lives, one day being as like
</p>
<p>another as two peas in a pod, and having no sort of adver-
</p>
<p>sities to give savour to our ease, we found existence the
</p>
<p>most flat, insipid, dull thing possible. I remember how, on
</p>
<p>Christmas day, Dawson did cry out against the warm sun-
</p>
<p>shine as a thing contrary to nature, wishing he might stand
</p>
<p>up to his knees in snow in a whistling wind, and taking up
</p>
<p>the crock Moll had filled with roses (which here bloom
</p>
<p>more fully in the depth of winter than with us in the height
</p>
<p>of summer) , he flung it out of the door with a curse for an

<p>unchristian thing to have in the house on such a day.
</p>
<p>HO A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>As soon as the year had turned, we began to count the
</p>
<p>days to our departure, and thenceforth we could think of
</p>
<p>nought but what we would do with our fortune when we got
</p>
<p>it ; and, the evenings being long, we would set the bag of
</p>
<p>wine betwixt us after our supper of dates, and sit there for
</p>
<p>hours discussing our several projects. Moll being with us
</p>
<p>(for in these parts no womankind may be abroad after
</p>
<p>sundown), she would take part in these debates with as
</p>
<p>much gusto as we. For though she was not wearied of
</p>
<p>her life here as we were, yet she was possessed of a very
</p>
<p>stirring spirit of adventure, and her quick imagination fur-
</p>
<p>nished endless visions of lively pleasures and sumptuous
</p>
<p>living. We agreed that we would live together, and share
</p>
<p>everything in common as one family, but not in such an
</p>
<p>outlandish spot as Chislehurst. That estate we would have
</p>
<p>nothing to do with ; but, selling it at once, have in its
</p>
<p>place two houses, one city house in the Cheap, and a
</p>
<p>country house not further from town than Bednal Green,
</p>
<p>or Clerkenwell at the outside, to the end that when we
</p>
<p>were fatigued with the pleasures of the town, we might,
</p>
<p>by an easy journey, resort to the tranquillity of rural life,
</p>
<p>Dawson declaring what wines he would have laid down in
</p>
<p>our cellars, I what books should furnish our library, and
</p>
<p>Moll what dresses she would wear (not less than one for
</p>
<p>every month of the year), what coaches and horses we
</p>
<p>should keep, what liveries our servants should wear, what
</p>
<p>entertainments we would give, and so forth. Don Sanchez
</p>
<p>was not excluded from our deliberations; indeed, he en-
</p>
<p>couraged us greatly by approving of all our plans, only
</p>
<p>stipulating that we would guard one room for him in each

</p>
<p>of our houses, that he might feel at home in our society
</p>
<p>DISCOURSE OF RETURNING TO ENGLAND. Ill
</p>
<p>whenever he chanced to be in our neighbourhood. In all
</p>
<p>these arguments, there was never one word of question
</p>
<p>from any of us as to the honesty of our design. We had
</p>
<p>settled that, once and for all, before starting on this expedi-
</p>
<p>tion ; and since then, little by little, we had come to regard
</p>
<p>the Godwin estate as a natural gift, as freely to be taken
</p>
<p>as a blackberry from the hedge. Nay, I believe Dawson
</p>
<p>and I would have contested our right to it by reason of
</p>
<p>the pains we were taking to possess it.
</p>
<p>And now, being in the month of June, and our year of
</p>
<p>exile (as it liked us to call it) nigh at an end, Dawson one
</p>
<p>night put the question to Don Sanchez, which had kept
</p>
<p>us fluttering in painful suspense these past six months,
</p>
<p>whether he had saved sufficient by his labours, to enable
</p>
<p>us to return to England ere long.
</p>
<p>" Yes," says he, gravely, at which we did all heave one
</p>
<p>long sigh of relief, " I learn that a convoy of English ships
</p>
<p>is about to sail from Alicante in the beginning of July, and
</p>
<p>if we are happy enough to find a favourable opportunity,
</p>
<p>we will certainly embark in one of them."
</p>
<p>"Pray, Senor," says I, "what may that opportunity be;
</p>
<p>for 'tis but two days' march hence to Alicante, and we
</p>
<p>may do it with a light foot in one."
</p>
<p>"The opportunity I speak of," answers he, "is the arrival,
</p>
<p>from Algeria, of a company of pirates, whose good service
</p>
<p>I hope to engage in putting us aboard an English ship
</p>
<p>under a flag of truce as redeemed slaves from Barbary."
</p>
<p>" Pirates ! " cry we, in a low breath.
</p>
<p>"What, Senor!" adds Dawson, "are we to trust our-
</p>
<p>selves to the mercy and honesty of Barbary pirates on the

</p>
<p>112 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>" I would rather trust to their honesty," answers the Don,
</p>
<p>dropping his voice that he might not be heard by Moll,
</p>
<p>who was leading home the goats, " than to the mercy of an
</p>
<p>English judge, if we should be brought to trial with insuffi-
</p>
<p>cient evidence to support our story."
</p>
<p>Jack and I stared at each other aghast at this talk of
</p>
<p>trial, which had never once entered into our reckoning of
</p>
<p>probabilities.
</p>
<p>"If I know aught of my fellow-men," continues .the Don,
</p>
<p>surely and slow, " that grasping steward will not yield up
</p>
<p>his trust before he has made searching enquiry into Moll's
</p>
<p>claim, act she her part never so well. We cannot refuse
</p>
<p>to give him the name of the ship that brought us home, and,
</p>
<p>learning that we embarked at Alicante, jealous suspicion
</p>
<p>may lead him to seek further information there ; with what
</p>
<p>result?"
</p>
<p>" Why, we may be blown with a vengeance, if he come
</p>
<p>ferreting so nigh as that," says Dawson, "and we are like
</p>
<p>to rot in gaol for our pains."
</p>
<p>"You may choose to run that risk; I will not," says the
</p>

</p>
<p>"Nor I either," says Dawson, "and God forgive me for
</p>
<p>overlooking such a peril to my Moll. But, do tell me
</p>
<p>plainly, Senor, granting these pirates be the most honest
</p>
<p>thieves in the world, is there no other risk to fear? "
</p>
<p>The Don hunched his shoulders.
</p>
<p>" Life itself is a game," says he, " in which the meanest
</p>
<p>stroke may not be won without some risk ; but, played as I
</p>
<p>direct, the odds are" in our favour. Picked up at sea from

</p>
<p>the south) , " where no man in England dare venture to
</p>
<p>seek it?"
</p>
<p>"Why, to be sure," says Dawson; "that way all hangs
</p>
<p>together to a nicety. For only a wizard could dream of
</p>
<p>coming hither for our undoing."
</p>
<p>"For the rest," continues the Don, thoughtfully, "there
</p>
<p>is little to fear. Judith Godwin has eyes the colour of
</p>
<p>Moll's, and in all else Simon must expect to find a change
</p>
<p>since he last saw his master's daughter. They were in Italy
</p>
<p>three years. That would make Judith a lisping child when
</p>
<p>she left England. He must look to find her altered. Why,"
</p>
<p>adds he, in a more gentle voice, as if moved by some inner
</p>
<p>feeling of affection and admiration, nodding towards Moll,
</p>
<p>" see how she has changed in this little while. I should not
</p>
<p>know her for the raw, half-starved spindle of a thing she
</p>
<p>was when I saw her first playing in the barn at Tottenham
</p>
<p>Cross."
</p>
<p>Looking at her now (browsing the goats amongst my most
</p>
<p>cherished herbs) , I was struck also by this fact, which, living
</p>
<p>with her day by day, had slipped my observation somewhat.
</p>
<p>She was no longer a gaunt, ungainly child, but a young
</p>
<p>woman, well proportioned, with a rounded cheek and chin,
</p>
<p>brown tinted by the sun, and, to my mind, more beautiful
</p>
<p>than any of their vaunted Moorish women. But, indeed,
</p>
<p>in this country all things do mature quickly ; and 'twas less
</p>
<p>surprising in her case because her growth had been checked
</p>
<p>before by privation and hardship, whereas since our coming

<p>CHAPTER XIV.
</p>
<p>Of our coming to London (T.vith incidents by the way}, and of the great
</p>
<p>address whereby Moll confounds Simon, the steward.
</p>
<p>ON the third day of July, all things falling in pat with
</p>
<p>the Don's design, we bade farewell to Elche, Dawson and
</p>
<p>I with no sort of regret, but Moll in tears at parting from
</p>
<p>those friends she had grown to love very heartily. And
</p>
<p>these friends would each have her take away something for
</p>
<p>a keepsake, such as rings to wear on her arms and on her
</p>
<p>ankles (as is the Moorish fashion), silk shawls, etc., so
</p>
<p>that she had quite a large present of finery to carry away;
</p>
<p>but we had nothing whatever but the clothes we stood in,
</p>
<p>and they of the scantiest, being simply long shirts and
</p>
<p>"bernouses" such as common Moors wear. For the wise
</p>
<p>Don would let us take nought that might betray our sojourn
</p>
<p>in Spain, making us even change our boots for wooden
</p>
<p>sandals, he himself being arrayed no better than we. Nor
</p>
<p>was this the only change insisted on by our governor; for
</p>
<p>on Dawson bidding Moll in a surly tone to give over a
</p>
<p>shedding of tears, Don Sanchez turns upon him, and says
</p>
<p>he:
</p>
<p>" It is time to rehearse the parts we are to play. From
</p>
<p>this day forth your daughter is Mistress Judith Godwin,
</p>
<p>you are Captain Robert Evans, and you" (to me), "Mr.
</p>
<p>Hopkins, the merchant. Let us each play our part with
</p>
<p>care, that we do not betray ourselves by a slip in a moment
</p>
<p>of unforeseen danger."

</p>
<p>SET US ALL ABOARD AN ALGERINE. 11$
</p>
<p>"You are in the right, Senor," answers Jack, "for I doubt
</p>
<p>it must be a hard task to forget that Mistress Judith is my
</p>
<p>daughter, as it is for a loving father to hold from chiding
</p>
<p>of his own flesh and blood; so I pray you, Madam" (to
</p>
<p>Moll), "bear that in mind and vex me no more."
</p>
<p>We lay this lesson seriously to heart, Dawson and I, for
</p>
<p>the Don's hint that we might end our career in gaol did
</p>
<p>still rankle woundily in our minds. And so very soberly
</p>
<p>we went out of the forest of Elche in the night on mules
</p>
<p>lent us by Sidi ben Ahmed, with a long cavalcade of mules
</p>
<p>charged with merchandise for embarking on board the
</p>
<p>pirates' vessel, and an escort of some half-dozen fierce-
</p>
<p>looking corsairs armed with long firelocks and a great
</p>
<p>store of awesome crooked knives stuck in their waist-cloths.
</p>
<p>After journeying across the plain, we came about mid-
</p>
<p>day to the seaboard, and there we spied, lying in a shel-
</p>
<p>tered bay, a long galley with three masts, each dressed with
</p>
<p>a single cross-spar for carrying a leg-of-mutton sail, and on
</p>
<p>the shore a couple of ship's boats with a company of men
</p>
<p>waiting to transport our goods and us aboard. And here
</p>
<p>our hearts quaked a bit at the thought of trusting ourselves
</p>
<p>in the hands of these same murderous-looking pirates.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when our time came we got us into their boat,
</p>
<p>recommending ourselves very heartily to God's mercy, and
</p>
<p>so were rowed out to the galley, where we were very civilly
</p>
<p>received by an old Moor with a white beard, who seemed
</p>
<p>well acquainted with Don Sanchez. Then the merchan-
</p>
<p>dise being all aboard, and the anchor up, the men went to
</p>
<p>their oars, a dozen of each side, and rowed us out of the
</p>
<p>bay until, catching a little wind of air, the sails were run

</p>
<p>up, and we put out to sea very bravely.
</p>
<p>Il6 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>"Senor," says Dawson, "I know not how I am to play
</p>
<p>this part of a sea-captain when we are sent on board an
</p>
<p>English ship, for if they ask me any questions on this
</p>
<p>business of navigating, I am done for a certainty."
</p>
<p>"Rest easy on that score, Evans," replies the Don.
</p>
<p>" I will answer for you, for I see very clearly by your com-
</p>
<p>plexion that you will soon be past answering them
</p>
<p>yourself."
</p>
<p>And this forecast was quickly verified; for ere the galley
</p>
<p>had dipped a dozen times to the waves, poor Dawson was
</p>
<p>laid low with a most horrid sickness like any dying man.
</p>
<p>By sundown we sighted the island of Maggiore, and in
</p>
<p>the roads there we cast anchor for the night, setting sail
</p>
<p>again at daybreak; and in this latitude we beat up and
</p>
<p>down a day and a night without seeing any sail, but on the
</p>
<p>morning of the third day a fleet of five big ships appeared
</p>
<p>to the eastward, and shifting our course we bore down
</p>
<p>upon them with amazing swiftness. Then when we were
</p>
<p>near enough to the foremast to see her English flag and the
</p>
<p>men aboard standing to their deck guns for a defence, our
</p>
<p>old Moor fires a gun in the air, takes in his sails, and runs
</p>
<p>up a great white flag for a sign of peace. And now with
</p>
<p>shrewd haste a boat was lowered, and we were set in it with
</p>
<p>a pair of oars, and the old pirate bidding us farewell in his
</p>
<p>tongue, clapt on all sail and stood out before the wind,
</p>
<p>leaving us there to shift for ourselves. Don Sanchez took
</p>
<p>one oar, and I t'other, Dawson lying in the bottom and
</p>
<p>not able to move a hand to save his life, and Moll held
</p>
<p>the tiller, and so we pulled with all our force, crying out
</p>
<p>now and then for fear we should not be seen, till by God's

</p>
<p>providence we came alongside the Talbot of London, and
</p>
<p>ARE TAKEN ABOARD OF AN ENGLISH SHIP. I \J
</p>
<p>were presently hoisted aboard without mishap. Then the
</p>
<p>captain of the Talbot and his officers gathering about us
</p>
<p>were mighty curious to know our story, and Don Sanchez
</p>
<p>very briefly told how we had gone in the Red Rose of Bris-
</p>
<p>tol to redeem two ladies from slavery; how we had found
</p>
<p>but one of these ladies living (at this Moll buries her face in
</p>
<p>her hands as if stricken with grief); how, on the eve of our
</p>
<p>departure, some of our crew in a drunken frolic had
</p>
<p>drowned a Turk of Alger, for which we were condemned
</p>
<p>by their court to pay an indemnity far and away beyond
</p>
<p>our means; how they then made this a pretext to seize our
</p>
<p>things, though we were properly furnished with the Duke's
</p>
<p>pass, and hold our men in bond; and how having plun-
</p>
<p>dered us of all we had, and seeing there was no more to be
</p>
<p>got, they did offer us our freedom for a written quittance
</p>
<p>of all they had taken for their justification if ever they
</p>
<p>should be brought to court; and finally, how, accepting of
</p>
<p>these conditions, we were shipped aboard their galley with
</p>
<p>nothing in the world but a few trifles, begged by Mistress
</p>
<p>Judith in remembrance of her mother.
</p>
<p>This story was accepted without any demur; nay, Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Ballcock, being one of those men who must ever appear
</p>
<p>to know all things, supported it in many doubtful par-
</p>
<p>ticulars, saying that he remembered the Rose of Bristol
</p>
<p>quite well; that he himself had seen a whole ship's
</p>
<p>crew sold into slavery for no greater offence than breaking
</p>
<p>a mosque window; that the Duke's pass counted for noth-
</p>
<p>ing with these Turks; that he knew the galley we were
</p>
<p>brought in as well as he knew Paul's Church, having
</p>
<p>chased it a dozen times, yet never got within gunshot for

</p>
<p>her swift sailing, etc., which did much content us to hear.
</p>
<p>Il8 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>But the officers were mighty curious to know what ailed
</p>
<p>Captain Robert Evans (meaning Dawson), fearing he
</p>
<p>might be ill of the plague; however, on the Don's vowing
</p>
<p>that he was only sick of a surfeit, Captain Ballcock de-
</p>
<p>clared he had guessed it the moment he clapt eyes on him,
</p>
<p>as he himself had been taken of the same complaint with
</p>
<p>only eating a dish of pease pudding. Nevertheless, he
</p>
<p>ordered the sick man to be laid in a part of the ship
</p>
<p>furthest from his quarters, and so great was the dread of
</p>
<p>pestilence aboard that (as his sickness continued) not a
</p>
<p>soul would venture near him during the whole voyage
</p>
<p>except ourselves, which also fell in very well with our
</p>
<p>wishes. And so after a fairly prosperous voyage we came
</p>
<p>up the Thames to Chatham, the third day of August.
</p>
<p>We had been provided with some rough seamen's clothes
</p>
<p>for our better covering on the voyage ; but now, being
</p>
<p>landed, and lodged in the Crown inn at Chatham, Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez would have the captain take them all back.
</p>
<p>" But," says he, " if you will do us yet another favour,
</p>
<p>Captain, will you suffer one of your men to carry a letter to
</p>
<p>Mistress Godwin's steward at Chislehurst, that he may come
</p>
<p>hither to relieve us from our present straits ? "
</p>
<p>"Aye," answers he, "I will take the letter gladly, myself;
</p>
<p>for nothing pleases me better than a ramble in the country
</p>
<p>where I was born and bred."
</p>
<p>So Moll writes a letter at once to Simon, bidding him
</p>
<p>come at once to her relief; and Captain Ballcock, after
</p>
<p>carefully enquiring his way to this place he knew so well
</p>
<p>(as he would have us believe) , starts off with it, accompanied
</p>
<p>by his boatswain, a good-natured kind of lick-spittle, who

</p>
<p>never failed to back up his captain's assertions, which again
</p>
<p>ALL MATTERS FALL PAT TO OUR PURPOSE. I IQ
</p>
<p>was to our great advantage ; for Simon would thus learn
</p>
<p>our story from his lips, and find no room to doubt its
</p>
<p>veracity.
</p>
<p>As soon as these two were out of the house, Dawson, who
</p>
<p>had been carried from the ship and laid in bed, though as
</p>
<p>hale since we passed the Godwins as ever he was in his
</p>
<p>life before, sprang up, and declared he would go to bed no
</p>
<p>more, for all the fortunes in the world, till he had supped
</p>
<p>on roast pork and onions, this being a dish he greatly
</p>
<p>loved, but not to be had at Elche, because the Moors by
</p>
<p>their religion forbid the use of swine's flesh, and seeing
</p>
<p>him very determined on this head, Don Sanchez ordered a
</p>
<p>leg of pork to be served in our chamber, whereof Dawson
</p>
<p>did eat such a prodigious quantity, and drank therewith
</p>
<p>such a vast quantity of strong ale (which he protested was
</p>
<p>the only liquor an Englishman could drink with any satis-
</p>
<p>faction), that in the night he was seized with most severe
</p>
<p>cramp in his stomach. This gave us the occasion to send
</p>
<p>for a doctor in the morning, who, learning that Jack had
</p>
<p>been ill ever since we left Barbary, and not understand-
</p>
<p>ing his present complaint, pulled a very long face, and,
</p>
<p>declaring his case was very critical, bled him copiously,
</p>
<p>forbade him to leave his bed for another fortnight, and sent
</p>
<p>him in half a dozen bottles of physic. About midday he
</p>
<p>returns, and, finding his patient no better, administers a
</p>
<p>bolus ; and while we are all standing about the bed, and
</p>
<p>Dawson the colour of death, and groaning, betwixt the
</p>
<p>nausea of the drug he had swallowed and the cramp in
</p>
<p>his inwards, in comes our Captain Ballcock and the little
</p>
<p>steward.

<p>" There ! " cries he, turning on Simon, " did not I tell you
</p>
<p>120 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>that my old friend Evans lay at death's door with the treat-
</p>
<p>ment he hath received of these Barbary pirates? Now
</p>
<p>will you be putting us off with your doubts and your question-
</p>
<p>ings? Shall I have up my ship's company to testify to the
</p>
<p>truth of my history? Look you, Madam," (to Moll), "we
</p>
<p>had all the trouble in the world to make this steward of
</p>
<p>yours do your bidding ; but he should have come though we
</p>
<p>had to bring him by the neck and heels, and a pox to him
</p>
<p>saving your presence."
</p>
<p>"But this is not Simon," says Moll, with a pretty air of
</p>
<p>innocence. " I seem to remember Simon a bigger man
</p>
<p>than he."
</p>
<p>" You must consider, Madam," says Don Sanchez, " that
</p>
<p>then you were very small, scarce higher than his waist,
</p>
<p>maybe, and so you would have to look up into his face."
</p>
<p>" I did not think of that. And are you really Simon,
</p>
<p>who used to scold me for plucking fruit?"
</p>
<p>"Yea, verily," answers he. "Doubt it not, for thou also
</p>
<p>hast changed beyond conception. And so it hath come to
</p>
<p>pass ! " he adds, staring round at us in our Moorish garb
</p>
<p>like one bewildered. "And thou art my mistress now"
</p>
<p>(turning again to Moll) .
</p>
<p>" Alas ! " says she, bowing her head and covering her
</p>
<p>eyes with her hand.
</p>
<p>" Han't I told you so, unbelieving Jew Quaker ! " growls
</p>
<p>Captain Ballcock, in exasperation. " Why will you plague
</p>
<p>the unhappy lady with her loss ? "
</p>
<p>" We will leave Evans to repose," says Moll, brushing her
</p>
<p>eyes and turning to the door. " You will save his life, Doc-
</p>
<p>tor, for he has given me mine."

</p>
<p>could make him whole, and so, leaving him with poor
</p>
<p>groaning Dawson, we went into the next chamber. And
</p>
<p>there Captain Ballcock was for taking his leave ; but Moll,
</p>
<p>detaining him, says :
</p>
<p>" We owe you something more than gratitude we have
</p>
<p>put you to much expense."
</p>
<p>" Nay," cries he. "I will take nought for doing a com-
</p>
<p>mon act of mercy."
</p>
<p>" You shall not be denied the joy of generosity," says she,
</p>
<p>with a sweet grace. " But you must suffer me to give your
</p>
<p>ship's company some token of my gratitude." Then turn-
</p>
<p>ing to Simon with an air of authority, she says, " Simon, I
</p>
<p>have no money."
</p>
<p>The poor man fumbled in his pocket, and bringing out
</p>
<p>a purse, laid it open, showing some four or five pieces of sil-
</p>
<p>ver and one of gold, which he hastily covered with his hand.
</p>
<p>" I see you have not enough," says Moll, and taking up
</p>
<p>a pen she quickly wrote some words on a piece of paper,
</p>
<p>signing it " Judith Godwin." Then showing it to Simon,
</p>
<p>she says, " You will pay this when it is presented to you,"
</p>
<p>and therewith she folds it and places it in the captain's
</p>
<p>hand, bidding him farewell in a pretty speech.
</p>
<p>" A hundred pounds ! a hundred pounds ! " gasps Simon,
</p>
<p>under his breath, in an agony and clutching up his purse to
</p>
<p>his breast.
</p>
<p>" I am astonished," says Moll, returning from the door,
</p>
<p>and addressing Simon, with a frown upon her brow, " that
</p>
<p>you are not better furnished to supply my wants, knowing
</p>
<p>by my letter how I stand."

</p>
<p>"What is this?" cries she, emptying the contents upon
</p>
<p>the table. " Tis nothing. Here is barely sufficient to pay
</p>
<p>for our accommodation in this inn. Where is the money
</p>
<p>to discharge my debt to these friends who have lost all
</p>
<p>in saving me? You were given timely notice of their
</p>
<p>purpose."
</p>
<p>" Prithee, be patient with me, gentle mistress. Tis true,
</p>
<p>I knew of their intent, but they were to have returned
</p>
<p>in six months, and when they came not at the end of the
</p>
<p>year I did truly give up all for lost ; and so I made a fresh
</p>
<p>investment of thy fortune, laying it out all in life bonds
</p>
<p>and houses, to great worldly advantage, as thou shalt see in
</p>
<p>good time. Ere long I may get in some rents "
</p>
<p>" And in the meanwhile are we to stay in this plight to

<p>beg for charity?" asks Moll, indignantly.

<p>"Nay, mistress. Doubtless for your present wants this

<p>"We have lost all," says I, "Evans his ship, and I the

<p>" And I every maravedi I possessed," adds the Don.
</p>
<p>"And had they not," cries Moll, "were they possessed
</p>
<p>now of all they had, think you that I with an estate, as I am
</p>
<p>told, of sixty thousand pounds would add to the debt I owe
</p>
<p>them by one single penny ! "
</p>
<p>" If I may speak in your steward's defence, Madam," says
</p>
<p>I, humbly, " I would point out that the richest estate is not
</p>
<p>always readily converted into money. 'Tis like a rich jewel
</p>
<p>which the owner, though he be starving, must hold till he

<p>"With landed property the case is even more difficult.
</p>
<p>Tenants cannot be forced to pay rent before it is due, nor
</p>
<p>can their messuages be sold over their heads. And possibly
</p>
<p>all your capital is invested in land "
</p>
<p>" Every farthing that could be scraped together," says
</p>
<p>Simon, "and not a rood of it but is leased to substantial

</p>
<p>"Nevertheless," says I, "there are means of raising money

<p>must be raised at once, I know an honest, a fairly honest,
</p>
<p>goldsmith in Lombard Street who will lend at the market

<p>rate."
</p>
<p>"These gentlemen," answers Moll, turning to us, "may
</p>
<p>not choose to wait, and I will not incommode them for my
</p>
<p>own convenience."
</p>
<p>" Something for our present need we must have, Madam,"
</p>
<p>says the Don, with a significant glance at his outlandish dress ;
</p>
<p>"but those wants supplied, /am content to wait."
</p>
<p>"And you, sir?" says Moll to me.
</p>
<p>"With a hundred or two," says I, taking Don Sanchez's
</p>
<p>hint, " we may do very well till Michaelmas."
</p>
<p>"Be reasonable, gentlemen," implores Simon, mopping
</p>
<p>his eyes, which ran afresh at this demand. " Tis but some

<p>five or six weeks to Michaelmas ; surely fifty pounds "

</p>
<p>"Will three hundred content you, gentlemen? Consider,

<p>pressing than yours."
</p>
<p>" He is a good, honest, simple man, and I think we may

</p>
<p>"That may be contrived to our common satisfaction, I

<p>hope," says Moll, with a gracious smile. " I owe you half

<p>me, " you can examine my steward's accounts for your own
</p>
<p>satisfaction, and counsel me, mayhap, upon the conduct of
</p>
<p>my affairs, knowing so much upon matters of business that
</p>
<p>are incomprehensible to a simple, inexperienced maid.
</p>
<p>Then, should you find aught amiss in my steward's books,
</p>
<p>anything to shake your confidence in his management, you
</p>
<p>will, in justice to your friends, in kindness to me, speak
</p>
<p>your mind openly, that instant reformation may be made."
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez and I expressed our agreement to this pro-
</p>
<p>posal, and Moll, turning to the poor, unhappy steward, says
</p>
<p>in her high tone of authority :
</p>
<p>"You hear how this matter is ordered, Simon. Take up
</p>
<p>that purse for your own uses. Go into the town and send
</p>
<p>such tradesmen hither as may supply us with proper cloth-
</p>
<p>ing. Then to your goldsmith in Lombard Street and bring
</p>
<p>me back six hundred pounds."
</p>
<p>" Six hundred pounds ! " cries he, hardly above his
</p>
<p>breath, and with a pause between each word as if to gain
</p>
<p>strength to speak 'em.
</p>
<p>" Six hundred. Three for these gentlemen and three for

<p>rny own needs ; when that is done, hasten to Chislehurst
</p>
<p>and prepare my house ; and, as you value my favour, see
</p>
<p>that nothing is wanting when I come there."
</p>
<p>And here, lest it should be thought that Moll could not
</p>
<p>possibly play her part so admirably in this business, despite
</p>
<p>the many secret instructions given by the longheaded Don, I
</p>
<p>do protest that I have set down no more than I recollect,
</p>
<p>and that without exaggeration. Further, it must be ob-

</p>
<p>Lay our hands on six hundred pounds and quarter ourselves in
</p>
<p>Hurst Court, but stand in a fair way to be undone by Dawson, his
</p>
<p>folly.
</p>
<p>THE next day comes Simon with a bag of six hundred
</p>
<p>pounds, which he tells over with infinite care, groaning
</p>
<p>and mopping his eyes betwixt each four or five pieces with
</p>
<p>a most rueful visage, so that it seemed he was weeping over
</p>
<p>this great expenditure, and then he goes to prepare the
</p>
<p>Court and get servants against Moll's arrival. By the
</p>
<p>end of the week, being furnished with suitable clothing
</p>
<p>and equipment, Moll and Don Sanchez leave us, though
</p>
<p>Dawson was now as hale and hearty as ever he had been,
</p>
<p>we being persuaded to rest at Chatham yet another week, to
</p>
<p>give countenance to Jack's late distemper, and also that we
</p>
<p>might appear less like a gang of thieves.
</p>
<p>Before going, Don Sanchez warned us that very likely
</p>
<p>Simon would pay us a visit suddenly, to satisfy any doubts
</p>
<p>that might yet crop up in his suspicious mind; and so, to
</p>
<p>be prepared for him, I got in a good store of paper and
</p>
<p>books, such as a merchant might require in seeking to re-
</p>
<p>establish himself in business, and Dawson held himself in
</p>
<p>readiness to do his share of this knavish business.
</p>
<p>Sure enough, about three days after this, the drawer, who
</p>
<p>had been instructed to admit no one to my chamber with-
</p>
<p>out my consent, comes up to say that the little old man

</p>
<p>in leather, with the weak eyes, would see me; so I bade him
</p>
<p>in a high voice bid Mr. Simon step up, and setting myself
</p>
<p>before my table of paper, engage in writing a letter (already
</p>
<p>half writ), while Dawson slips out into the next room.
</p>
<p>"Take a seat, Mr. Steward," says I, when Simon entered,
</p>
<p>cap in hand, and casting a very prying, curious look
</p>
<p>around. "I must keep you a minute or two"; and so I
</p>
<p>feign to be mighty busy, and give him scope for observation.
</p>
<p>"Well, sir," says I, finishing my letter with a flourish,
</p>
<p>and setting it aside. "How do you fare? "
</p>
<p>He raised his hands, and dropped them like so much
</p>
<p>lead on his knees, casting up his eyes and giving a doleful
</p>
<p>shake of his head for a reply.
</p>
<p>" Nothing is amiss at the Court, I pray your lady Mis-
</p>
<p>tress Godwin is well? "
</p>
<p>"I know not, friend," says he. "She hath taken my
</p>
<p>keys, denied me entrance to her house, and left me no
</p>
<p>privilege of my office save the use of the lodge house.
</p>
<p>Thus am I treated like a faithless servant, after toiling
</p>
<p>night and day all these years, and for her advantage, rather
</p>
<p>than mine own."
</p>
<p>"That has to be proved, Mr. Steward," says I, severely;
</p>
<p>" for you must admit that up to this present she has had no
</p>
<p>reason to love you, seeing that, had her fate been left in
</p>
<p>your hands, she would now be in Barbary, and like to end
</p>
<p>her days there. How, then, can she think but that you had
</p>
<p>some selfish, wicked end in denying her the service we, who
</p>
<p>are strangers, have rendered her?"

<p>DISCOURSE OF SIMON. I2Q
</p>
<p>"We will say no more on that head, but you may rest
</p>
<p>assured on my promise knowing as I do the noble, gen-
</p>
<p>erous nature of your mistress that if she has done you
</p>
<p>wrong in suspecting you of base purpose, she will be the
</p>
<p>first to admit her fault and offer you reparation."
</p>
<p>" I seek no reparation, no reward, nothing in the world
</p>
<p>but the right to cherish this estate," cries he, in passion;
</p>
<p>and, upon my looking at him very curiously, as not under-
</p>
<p>standing the motive of such devotion, he continues : " Thee
</p>
<p>canst not believe me, and yet truly I am neither a liar nor
</p>
<p>a madman. What do others toil for? A wife children
</p>
<p>friends the gratification of ambition or lust ! I have
</p>
<p>no kith or kin, no ambition, no lust; but this estate is
</p>
<p>wife, child, everything, to me. 'Tis like some work of
</p>
<p>vanity, a carved image that a man may give his whole
</p>
<p>life to making, and yet die content if he achieves but some
</p>
<p>approach to the creation of his soul. I have made this
</p>
<p>estate out of nothing; it hath grown larger and larger,
</p>
<p>richer and more rich, in answer to my skill; why should I
</p>
<p>not love it, and put my whole heart in the accomplishment
</p>
<p>of my design, with the same devotion that you admire in
</p>
<p>the maker of graven images? "
</p>
<p>Despite his natural infirmities, Simon delivered this
</p>
<p>astonishing rhapsody with a certain sort of vehemence that
</p>
<p>made it eloquent; and indeed, strange as his passion was,
</p>
<p>I could not deny that it was as reasonable in its way as any
</p>
<p>nobler act of self-sacrifice.
</p>
<p>"I begin to understand you, Mr. Steward," says I.
</p>

<p>peril of being torn from his child, render me this estate to

</p>
<p>men of no conscience, to whom this Spanish Don would
</p>
<p>deliver it for the speedy satisfaction of his greed."
</p>
<p>"Nay, my claim's as great as his," says I, "and my
</p>
<p>affairs more pressing" (with a glance at my papers). "I
</p>
<p>am undone, my credit lost, my occupation gone."
</p>
<p>" Thee shalt be paid to the last farthing. Examine my
</p>
<p>books, enquire into the value of my securities, and thee
</p>
<p>wilt find full assurance."
</p>
<p>"Well, one of these days mayhap," says I, as if to put
</p>
<p>him off.
</p>
<p>"Nay, come at once, I implore thee; for until I am
</p>
<p>justified to my mistress, I stand like one betwixt life and
</p>
<p>death."
</p>
<p>"For one thing," says I, still shuffling, "I can do noth-
</p>
<p>ing, nor you either, to the payment of our just claim,
</p>
<p>before the inheritance is safely settled upon Mistress
</p>
<p>Godwin."
</p>
<p>"That shall be done forthwith. I understand the intri-

</p>
<p>and then his pocket), "to get a seal, with ten times the

</p>
<p>"I'll promise nothing," says I. "Our poor Captain

<p>Evans is still a prisoner in his room."
</p>
<p>"Aye," says Dawson, coming in from the next room, in

<p>his nightgown, seeming very feeble and weak despite his

</p>
<p>SET OUT FOR CHISLEHURST. 13!
</p>
<p>"Thee shalt have it truly; wait but a little while, good
</p>
<p>friend, a little while."
</p>
<p>"Wait a little while and founder altogether, eh? I know
</p>
<p>you land sharks, and would I'd been born with a smack of
</p>
<p>your cunning; then had I never gone of this venture, and
</p>
<p>lost my ship and twoscore men, that money'll ne'er re-
</p>
<p>place. Look at me, a sheer hulk and no more, and all
</p>
<p>through lending ear to one prayer and another. I doubt
</p>
<p>you're minded to turn your back on poor old Bob Evans,
</p>
<p>as t' others have, Mr. Hopkins, and why not? The poor
</p>
<p>old man's worth nothing, and cannot help himself." With
</p>
<p>this he fell a-snivelling like any girl.
</p>
<p>"I vow I'll not quit you, Evans, till you're hale again."
</p>
<p>"Bring him with thee o' Saturday," urged Simon.
</p>
<p>"Surely, my mistress can never have the heart to refuse
</p>
<p>you shelter at the Court, who owes her life to ye. Come
</p>
<p>and stay there till thy wage be paid, friend Evans."
</p>
<p>" What ! would ye make an honest sailor play bum-bailiff,
</p>
<p>and stick in a house, willy nilly, till money's found ? Plague
</p>
<p>of your dry land ! Give me a pitching ship and a rolling
</p>
<p>sea, and a gale whistling in my shrouds. Oh, my reins,
</p>
<p>my reins ! give me a paper of tobacco, Mr. Hopkins, and a
</p>
<p>pipe to soothe this agony, or I shall grow desperate ! "
</p>
<p>I left the room as if to satisfy this desire, and Simon
</p>
<p>followed, imploring me still to come on Saturday to Chisle-
</p>
<p>hurst; and I at length got rid of him by promising to come
</p>
<p>as soon as Evans could be left or induced to accompany me.
</p>
<p>I persuaded Dawson, very much against his gree, to
</p>
<p>delay our going until Monday, the better to hoodwink old
</p>
<p>Simon; and on that day we set out for Chislehurst, both

</p>
<p>I in a very proper, seemly sort of cloth, and with more
</p>
<p>guineas in our pockets than ever before we had possessed
</p>
<p>shillings. And a very merry journey this was; for Dawson,
</p>
<p>finding himself once more at liberty, and hearty as a lark
</p>
<p>after his long confinement and under no constraint, was
</p>
<p>like a boy let loose from school. Carolling at the top of
</p>
<p>his voice, playing mad pranks with all who passed us on
</p>
<p>the road, and staying at every inn to drink twopenny ale,
</p>
<p>so that I feared he would certainly fall ill of drinking, as he
</p>
<p>had before of eating; but the exercise of riding, the fresh,
</p>
<p>wholesome air, and half an hour's doze in a spinney, did
</p>
<p>settle his liquor, and so he reached Hurst Court quite
</p>
<p>sober, thanks be to Heaven, though very gay. And there
</p>
<p>we had need of all our self-command, to conceal our joy
</p>
<p>in finding those gates open to us, which we had looked
</p>
<p>through so fondly when we were last here, and to spy Moll,
</p>
<p>in a stately gown, on the fine terrace before this noble
</p>
<p>house, carrying herself as if she had lived here all her life,
</p>
<p>and Don Sanchez walking very deferential by her side.
</p>
<p>Especially Dawson could scarce bring himself to speak to
</p>
<p>her in an uncouth, surly manner, as befitted his character,
</p>
<p>and no sooner were we entered the house but he whips Moll
</p>
<p>behind a door, and falls a-hugging and kissing her like any
</p>
<p>sly young lover.
</p>
<p>Whilst he was giving way to these extravagances, which
</p>
<p>Moll had not the heart to rebuff, for in her full, warm
</p>
<p>heart she was as overjoyed to see him there as he her,
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez and I paced up and down the spacious hall,
</p>

<p>where), and the Don mighty sombre and grave (as foresee-
</p>
<p>ing an evil outcome of this business), so that he would
</p>
<p>make no answer to my civilities save by dumb gestures,
</p>
<p>showing he was highly displeased. But truly 'twas enough
</p>
<p>to set us all crazy, but he, with joy, to be in possession of
</p>
<p>all these riches and think that we had landed at Chatham
</p>
<p>scarce a fortnight before without decent clothes to our
</p>
<p>backs, and now, but for the success of our design, might
</p>
<p>be the penniless strolling vagabonds we were when Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez lighted on us.
</p>
<p>Presently Moll came out from the side room with her
</p>
<p>father, her hair all tumbled, and as rosy as a peach, and
</p>
<p>she would have us visit the house from top to bottom,
</p>
<p>showing us the rooms set apart for us, her own chamber,
</p>
<p>the state room, the dining-hall, the store closets for plate
</p>
<p>and linen, etc., all prodigious fine and in most excellent
</p>
<p>condition; for the scrupulous minute care of old Simon
</p>
<p>had suffered nothing to fall out of repair, the rooms being
</p>
<p>kept well aired, the pictures, tapestries, and magnificent
</p>
<p>furniture all preserved fresh with linen covers and the like.
</p>
<p>From the hall she led us out on to the terrace to survey
</p>
<p>the park and the gardens about the house, and here, as
</p>
<p>within doors, all was in most admirable keeping, with no
</p>
<p>wild growth or runaweeds anywhere, nor any sign of
</p>
<p>neglect. But I observed, as an indication of the steward's
</p>
<p>thrifty, unpoetic mind, that the garden beds were planted
</p>
<p>with onions and such marketable produce, in place of flowers,
</p>
<p>and that instead of deer grazing upon the green slopes of
</p>
<p>the park there was only such profitable cattle as sheep,
</p>
<p>cows, etc. And at the sight of all this abundance of good

<p>Moll's waist.
</p>
<p>Then the Don, who had followed us up and down stairs,
</p>
<p>speaking never one word till this, says, "We may count

<p>Prosper as well as any thieves may; but Dauuson greatly tormented.
</p>
<p>THE next morning I went to Simon at his lodge house,
</p>
<p>having writ him a note overnight to prepare him for my
</p>
<p>visit, and there I found him, with all his books and papers
</p>
<p>ready for my examination. So to it we set, casting up
</p>
<p>figures, comparing accounts, and so forth, best part of the
</p>
<p>day, and in the end I came away convinced that he was
</p>
<p>the most scrupulous, honest steward ever man had. And,
</p>
<p>truly, it appeared that by his prudent investments and
</p>
<p>careful management he had trebled the value of the estate,
</p>
<p>and more, in the last ten years. He showed me, also, that
</p>
<p>in all his valuations he had set off a large sum for loss by
</p>
<p>accident of fire, war, etc., so that actually at the present
</p>
<p>moment the estate, which he reckoned at seventy-five thou-
</p>
<p>sand pounds, was worth at the least one hundred and
</p>
<p>twenty-five thousand. But for better assurance on this
</p>
<p>head, I spent the remainder of the week in visiting the
</p>
<p>farms, messuages, etc., on his rent roll, and found them all
</p>
<p>in excellent condition, and held by good substantial men,
</p>
<p>nothing in any particular but what he represented it.
</p>
<p>Reporting on these matters privily to Don Sanchez and
</p>
<p>Dawson, I asked the Don what we should now be doing.
</p>
<p>"Two ways lie before us," says he, lighting a cigarro.
</p>

</p>
<p>securities, sell them for what they wiU fetch, and get out
</p>
<p>of the country as quickly as possible. If the securities be
</p>
<p>worth one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds, we
</p>
<p>may" (puff) "possibly" (puff) "get forty thousand for
</p>
<p>them" (puff), "about a third of their value not more.
</p>
<p>That yields us ten thousand apiece. On ten thousand
</p>
<p>pounds a man may live like a prince in Spain. The
</p>
<p>other way is to make a friend of Simon by restoring him
</p>
<p>to his office, suffer him to treble the worth of the estate
</p>
<p>again in the next ten years, and live like kings " (puff) " in
</p>
<p>England."
</p>
<p>"Pray, which way do you incline, Senor?" says I.
</p>
<p>"Being a Spaniard," answers he, gravely, "I should
</p>
<p>prefer to live like a prince in Spain."
</p>
<p>"That would not I," says Dawson, stoutly. "A year and
</p>
<p>a half of Elche have cured me of all fondness for foreign
</p>
<p>parts. Besides, 'tis a beggarly, scurvy thing to fly one's
</p>
<p>country, as if we had done some unhandsome, dishonest
</p>
<p>trick. If I faced an Englishman, I should never dare look
</p>
<p>him straight in the eyes again. What say you, Mr. Hop-
</p>
<p>kins? "
</p>
<p>"Why, Evans," says I, "you know my will without tell-
</p>
<p>ing. I will not, of my own accord, go from your choice,
</p>
<p>which way you will."
</p>
<p>"Since we owe everything to Mistress Judith," observes
</p>
<p>the Don, " and as she is no longer a child, ought not her
</p>
<p>wishes to be consulted? "
</p>
<p>"No," says Jack, very decidedly, and then, lowering his
</p>
<p>voice, he adds, " for was she Judith Godwin ten times told,
</p>
<p>and as old as my grandmother into the bargain, she is still

</p>
<p>BEGIN TO TELL OUR UNHATCHED CHICKS. 137
</p>
<p>as you say, we owe her everything, then I count 'twould be
</p>
<p>a mean, dirty return to make her live out of England and
</p>
<p>feel she has a sneaking coward for a father."
</p>
<p>"As you please," says the Don. "Give me ten thou-
</p>
<p>sand of the sum you are to be paid at Michaelmas, and
</p>
<p>you are welcome to all the rest."
</p>
<p>"You mean that, Senor," cries Jack, seizing the Don's
</p>
<p>hand and raising his left.
</p>
<p>" By the Holy Mother," answers Don Sanchez, in Spanish.
</p>
<p>"Done! " cries Dawson, bringing his hand down with a
</p>
<p>smack on the Don's palm. "Nay, I always believed you
</p>
<p>was the most generous man living. Ten from t'other.
</p>
<p>Master Hopkins," says he, turning to me, "what does that
</p>
<p>leave us?"
</p>
<p>"More than a hundred thousand ! "
</p>
<p>"The Lord be praised for evermore! " cries Jack.
</p>
<p>Upon this, Moll, by the advice of Don Sanchez, sends
</p>
<p>for Simon, and telling him she is satisfied with the account
</p>
<p>I have given of his stewardship, offers him the further con-
</p>
<p>trol of her affairs, subject at all times to her decision on
</p>
<p>any question concerning her convenience, and reserving to
</p>
<p>herself the sole government of her household, the ordering
</p>
<p>of her home, lands, etc. And Simon grasping eagerly at
</p>
<p>this proposal, she then gives him the promise of one thou-
</p>
<p>sand pounds for his past services, and doubles the wages
</p>
<p>due to him under his contract with Sir R. Godwin.
</p>
<p>"Give me what it may please thee to bestow that way,"
</p>
<p>cries he. " All shall be laid out to enrich this property.
</p>
<p>I have no other use for money, no other worldly end in life
</p>
<p>but that."

</p>
<p>thanks for my good offices, vowing I should be paid my
</p>
<p>claim by Michaelmas, if it were in the power of man to
</p>
<p>raise so vast a sum in such short space.
</p>
<p>Surely, thinks I, there was never a more strange, origi-
</p>
<p>nal creature than this, yet it do seem to me that there is
</p>
<p>no man but his passion must appear a madness to others.
</p>
<p>I must speak now of Moll, her admirable carriage and
</p>
<p>sober conduct in these new circumstances, which would
</p>
<p>have turned the heads of most others. Never once to my
</p>
<p>knowledge did she lose her self-possession, on the most
</p>
<p>trying occasion, and this was due, not alone to her own
</p>
<p>shrewd wit and understanding, but to the subtle intelli-
</p>
<p>gence of Don Sanchez, who in the character of an old and
</p>
<p>trusty friend was ever by her side, watchful of her interest
</p>
<p>(and his own), ready at any moment to drop in her ear a
</p>
<p>quiet word of warning or counsel. By his advice she had
</p>
<p>taken into her service a most commendable, proper old
</p>
<p>gentlewoman, one Mrs. Margery Butterby, who, as being
</p>
<p>the widow of a country parson, was very orderly in all
</p>
<p>things, and particularly nice in the proprieties. This
</p>
<p>notable good soul was of a cheery, chatty disposition, of
</p>
<p>very pleasing manners, and a genteel appearance, and so,
</p>
<p>though holding but the part of housekeeper, she served as
</p>
<p>an agreeable companion and a respectable guardian, whose
</p>
<p>mere presence in the house silenced any question that
</p>
<p>might have arisen from the fact of three men living under
</p>
<p>the same roof with the young and beautiful mistress of
</p>
<p>Hurst Court. Moreover, she served us as a very useful
</p>
<p>kind of mouthpiece; for all those marvellous stories of her
</p>
<p>life in Barbary, of the pirates we had encountered in re-

<p>deeming her from the Turk, etc., with which Moll would

</p>
<p>beguile away any tedious half-hour, for the mere amuse-
</p>
<p>ment of creating Mrs. Butterby's wonder and surprise,
</p>
<p>as one will tell stories of fairies to children, this good
</p>
<p>woman repeated with many additions of her own concern-
</p>
<p>ing ourselves, which, to reflect credit on herself, were all
</p>
<p>to our advantage. This was the more fitting, because the
</p>
<p>news spreading that the lost heiress had returned to Hurst
</p>
<p>Court excited curiosity far and wide, and it was not long
</p>
<p>before families in the surrounding seats, who had known
</p>
<p>Sir R. Godwin in bygone times, called to see his daughter.
</p>
<p>And here Moll's wit was taxed to the utmost, for those
</p>
<p>who had known Judith Godwin as an infant expected that
</p>
<p>she should remember some incident stored in their recol-
</p>
<p>lection; but she was ever equal to the occasion, feign-
</p>
<p>ing a pretty doubting innocence at first, then suddenly
</p>
<p>asking this lady if she had not worn a cherry dress with a
</p>
<p>beautiful stomacher at the time, or that gentleman if he
</p>
<p>had not given her a gold piece for a token, and it generally
</p>
<p>happened these shrewd shafts hit their mark: the lady,
</p>
<p>though she might have forgotten her gown, remembering
</p>
<p>she had a very becoming stomacher; the gentleman be-
</p>
<p>lieving that he did give her a lucky penny, and so forth,
</p>
<p>from very vanity. Then Moll's lofty carriage and her
</p>
<p>beauty would remind them of their dear lost friend, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Godwin, in the heyday of her youth, and all agreed in
</p>
<p>admiring her beyond anything. And though Moll, from
</p>
<p>her lack of knowledge, made many slips, and would now
</p>
<p>and then say things uncustomary to women of breeding,
</p>
<p>yet these were easily attributed to her living so long in a
</p>
<p>barbarous country, and were as readily glanced over. In-

<p>deed, nothing could surpass Moll's artificial conduct on

</p>
<p>these occasions. She would lard her conversation with
</p>
<p>those scraps of Italian she learnt from me, and sometimes,
</p>
<p>affecting to have forgot her own tongue, she would stumble
</p>
<p>at a word, and turning to Don Sanchez, ask him the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish of some Moorish phrase. Then one day, there being
</p>
<p>quite a dozen visitors in her state room, she brings down
</p>
<p>her Moorish dress and those baubles given her by friends
</p>
<p>at Elche, to show the ladies, much to the general astonish-
</p>
<p>ment and wonder; then, being prayed to dress herself in
</p>
<p>these clothes, she with some hesitation of modesty consents,
</p>
<p>and after a short absence from the room returns in this
</p>
<p>costume, looking lovelier than ever I had before seen,
</p>
<p>with the rings about her shapely bare arms and on her
</p>
<p>ankles, and thus arrayed she brings me a guitar, and to
</p>
<p>my strumming sings a Moorish song, swaying her arms
</p>
<p>above her head and turning gracefully in their fashion, so
</p>
<p>that all were in an ecstasy with this strange performance.
</p>
<p>And the talk spreading, the number of visitors grew apace,
</p>
<p>as bees will flock to honey, and yielding to their
</p>
<p>urgent entreaties, she would often repeat this piece of
</p>
<p>business, and always with a most winning grace, that
</p>
<p>charmed every one. But she was most a favourite of gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen and elderly ladies; for the younger ones she did
</p>
<p>certainly put their noses out of joint, since none could at
</p>
<p>all compare with her in beauty nor in manner, either, for
</p>
<p>she had neither the awkward shyness of some nor the bold-
</p>
<p>ness of others, but contrived ever to steer neatly betwixt
</p>
<p>the two extremes by her natural self-possession and fear-
</p>
<p>lessness.

<p>were Sir Harry Upton and his lady (living in the Grays),
</p>
<p>DISCOURSE OF TAKING MOLL TO COURT. 14!
</p>
<p>and they, being about to go to London for the winter, did
</p>
<p>press Moll very hard to go with them, that she might be
</p>
<p>presented to the king; and, truth to tell, they would not
</p>
<p>have had to ask her twice had she been governed only
</p>
<p>by her own inclination. For she was mad to go, that
</p>
<p>audacious spirit of adventure still working very strong in
</p>
<p>her, and she, like a winning gamester, must for ever be
</p>
<p>playing for higher and higher stakes. But we, who had
</p>
<p>heard enough of his excellent but lawless Majesty's court
</p>
<p>to fear the fate of any impulsive, beauteous young woman
</p>
<p>that came within his sway, were quite against this. Even
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez, who was no innocent, did persuade her from
</p>
<p>it with good strong argument, showing that, despite his
</p>
<p>worldliness, he did really love her as much as 'twas in his
</p>
<p>withered heart to love any one. As for Dawson, he declared
</p>
<p>he would sooner see his Moll in her winding-sheet than
</p>
<p>in the king's company, adding that 'twould be time enough
</p>
<p>for her to think of going to court when she had a husband
</p>
<p>to keep her out of mischief. And so she refused this offer
</p>
<p>(but with secret tears, I believe). "But," says she to her
</p>
<p>father, " if I'm not to have my own way till I'm married,
</p>
<p>I shall get me a husband as soon as I can."
</p>
<p>And it seemed that she would not have to look far nor
</p>
<p>wait long for one neither. Before a month was passed, at
</p>
<p>least half a dozen young sparks were courting her, they
</p>
<p>being attracted, not only by her wit and beauty, but by the
</p>
<p>report of her wealth, it being known to all how Simon
</p>
<p>had enriched the estate. And 'twas this abundance of
</p>
<p>suitors which prevented Moll from choosing any one in
</p>
<p>particular, else had there been but one, I believe the

<p>business would have been settled very quickly. For now

<p>142 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>she was in the very flush of life, and the blood that flowed
</p>
<p>in her veins was of no lukewarm kind.
</p>
<p>But here (that I may keep all my strings in harmony)
</p>
<p>I must quit Moll for a space to tell of her father. That
</p>
<p>first hint of the Don's bringing him to his senses somewhat
</p>
<p>(like a dash of cold water), and the exuberance of his
</p>
<p>joy subsiding, he quickly became more circumspect in his
</p>
<p>behaviour, and fell into the part he had to play. And the
</p>
<p>hard, trying, sorrowful part that was, neither he nor I had
</p>
<p>foreseen. For now was he compelled for the first time
</p>
<p>in his life, at any length, to live apart from his daughter,
</p>
<p>to refrain from embracing her when they met in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing, to speak to her in a rough, churlish sort when his heart,
</p>
<p>maybe, was overflowing with love, and to reconcile him-
</p>
<p>self to a cool, indifferent behaviour on her side, when his
</p>
<p>very soul was yearning for gentle, tender warmth. And
</p>
<p>these natural cravings of affection were rather strengthened
</p>
<p>than stilled by repression, as one's hunger by starving. To
</p>
<p>add to this, he now saw his Moll more bewitching than
</p>
<p>ever she was before, the evidence of her wit and under-
</p>
<p>standing stimulating that admiration which he dared not
</p>
<p>express. He beheld her loved and courted openly by all,
</p>
<p>whilst he who had deeper feeling for her than any, and
</p>
<p>more right to caress her, must at each moment stifle his
</p>
<p>desires and lay fetters on his inclinations, which constraint,
</p>
<p>like chains binding down a stout, thriving oak, did eat and
</p>
<p>corrode into his being, so that he did live most of these
</p>
<p>days in a veritable torment. Yet, for Moll's sake, was he
</p>
<p>very stubborn in his resolution; and, when he could no
</p>
<p>longer endure to stand indifferently by while others were

<p>enjoying her sprightly conversation, he would go up to
</p>
<p>DAWSON GREATLY TORTURED. 143
</p>
<p>his chamber and pace to and fro, like some she-lion parted
</p>
<p>from her cub.
</p>
<p>These sufferings were not unperceived by Moll, who also
</p>
<p>had strong feeling to repress, and therefore could compre-
</p>
<p>hend her father's torture, and she would often seize an
</p>
<p>opportunity, nay, run great risk of discovery, to hie her
</p>
<p>secretly to his room, there to throw herself in his arms and
</p>
<p>strain him to her heart, covering his great face with tender
</p>
<p>kisses, and whispering words of hope and good cheer (with
</p>
<p>the tears on her cheek) . And one day when Jack seemed
</p>
<p>more than usual downhearted, she offered him to give up
</p>
<p>everything and return to her old ways, if he would. But
</p>
<p>this spurring his courage, he declared he would live in hell
</p>
<p>rather than she should fall from her high estate, and become
</p>
<p>a mere vagabond wench again, adding that 'twas but the first
</p>
<p>effort gave him so much pain, that with practice 'twould all
</p>
<p>be as nothing ; that such sweet kisses as hers once a week
</p>
<p>did amply compensate him for his fast, etc. Then her tears
</p>
<p>being brushed away, she would quit him with noiseless step
</p>
<p>and all precautions, and maybe five minutes afterwards,
</p>
<p>whilst Jack was sitting pensive at his window pondering
</p>
<p>her sweetness and love, he would hear her laughing lightly

<p>How Dawson for MoWs good parts company with us, and goes away
</p>
<p>a lonely man,
</p>
<p>ON the eve of Michaelmas day old Simon returned from
</p>
<p>London, whither he had gone two days before, to raise the
</p>
<p>money he had promised ; and calling upon him in the
</p>
<p>afternoon I found him seated at his table, with a most woe-
</p>
<p>begone look in his face, and his eyes streaming more
</p>
<p>copiously than usual. And with most abject humility he
</p>
<p>told me that doing the utmost that lay in his power, he had
</p>
<p>not been able to persuade his goldsmith to lend more than
</p>
<p>ten thousand pounds on the title deeds. Nor had he got
</p>
<p>that, he declared, but that the goldsmith knew him for an
</p>
<p>honest and trustworthy man whom he would credit beyond
</p>
<p>any other in the world ; for the seal not yet being given to
</p>
<p>Judith Godwin's succession, there was always peril of dis-
</p>
<p>pute and lawsuits which might make these papers of no
</p>
<p>value at all (the king's ministers vying one with another to
</p>
<p>please their master by bringing money rightly or wrongly
</p>
<p>into the treasury), and this, indeed, may have been true
</p>
<p>enough.

<p>" But," says he, " all will go well if thee wilt have but a
</p>
<p>little patience for a while. To-morrow my rents will come
</p>
<p>in, and I will exact to the last farthing; and there is a
</p>
<p>parcel of land I may sell, mayhap, for instant payment,

</p>
<p>I will do it rather than put thee to greater incommodity ;
</p>
<p>and so, ere the end of the week, thee mayst safely count
</p>
<p>on having yet another three thousand, which together makes
</p>
<p>nigh upon half the sum promised. And this, dear good
</p>
<p>friend," adds he, slyly, " thee mayst well take on account
</p>
<p>of thine own share, and none dispute thy right, for 'tis
</p>
<p>thy money hath done all. And from what I see of him,
</p>
<p>smoking of pipes in the public way and drinking with any
</p>
<p>low fellows in alehouses, this Captain Evans is but a paltry,
</p>
<p>mean man who may be easily put off with a pound or two
</p>
<p>to squander in his pleasures ; and as for the Spanish grandee,
</p>
<p>he do seem so content to be with our mistress that I doubt
</p>
<p>he needs no pretext for quitting her, added to which, being
</p>
<p>of a haughty, proud nature, he should scorn to claim his

<p>own, to the prejudice of a merchant who hath nought but

<p>friend, to lay this matter before my mistress in such a way
</p>
<p>that she may not be wroth with me."
</p>
<p>I told him I would do all he could expect of me in
</p>
<p>reason, but bade him understand that his cb/ance of for-
</p>
<p>giveness for having broke his first engagement depended
</p>
<p>greatly upon his exactitude in keeping the second, and that
</p>
<p>he might count on little mercy from us if the other three
</p>
<p>thousand were not forthcoming as he promised So I took
</p>
<p>the money and gave him a quittance for it, signing it with
</p>
<p>my false name, James Hopkins, but, reflecting on this when
</p>
<p>I left him, I wished I had not. For I clearly perceived
</p>
<p>that by this forgery I laid myself open to very grievous con-
</p>
<p>sequences ; moreover, taking of this solid money, disguise it
</p>
<p>how I would, appeared to me nothing short of downright

<p>robbery, be it whose it might. In short, being now plunged
</p>
<p>146 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>up to my neck in this business, I felt like a foolish lad who
</p>
<p>hath waded beyond his depth in a rapid current, hoping I
</p>
<p>might somehow get out of it safely, but with very little
</p>
<p>expectation. However, the sight of all this gold told up in
</p>
<p>scores upon the table in our closed room served to quiet
</p>
<p>these qualms considerably. Nevertheless, I was not dis-
</p>
<p>pleased to remember our bargain with Don Sanchez, feeling
</p>
<p>that I should breathe more freely when he had taken this
</p>
<p>store of gold out of my hands, etc. Thus did my mind
</p>
<p>waver this way and that, like a weather-cock to the blowing
</p>
<p>of contrary winds.
</p>
<p>'Twas this day that Moll (as I have said) dressed herself
</p>
<p>in her Moorish clothes for the entertainment of her new
</p>
<p>friends, and Dawson, hearing her voice, yet not daring to go
</p>
<p>into the state room where she was, must needs linger on the
</p>
<p>stairs listening to her song, and craning his neck to catch
</p>
<p>a glimpse of her through the open door below. Here he
</p>
<p>stands in a sort of ravishment, sucking in her sweet voice,
</p>
<p>and the sounds of delight with which her guests paid tribute
</p>
<p>to her performance, feeding his passion which, like some
</p>
<p>fire, grew more fierce by feeding, till he was well-nigh beside
</p>
<p>himself. Presently, out comes Moll from her state room,
</p>
<p>all glowing with exercise, flushed with pleasure, a rich colour
</p>
<p>in her cheek, and wild fire in her eyes, looking more witch-
</p>
<p>ing than any siren. Swiftly she crosses the hall, and runs
</p>
<p>up the stairs to gain her chamber and reclothe herself, but
</p>
<p>half way up Dawson stops her, and clasping her about,
</p>
<p>cries hoarsely in a transport :
</p>
<p>" Thou art my own Moll my own sweet Moll ! "
</p>
<p>adding, as she would break from him to go her way, " Nay,

</p>
<p>DAWSON ; HIS INDISCRETION. 147
</p>
<p>Then she, hesitating a moment betwixt prudence and her
</p>
<p>warmer feelings, suddenly yields to the impulse of her
</p>
<p>heart (her head also being turned maybe with success and
</p>
<p>delight), and flinging her arms about his neck gives him a
</p>
<p>hearty kiss, and then bursts away with a light laugh.
</p>
<p>Jack watches her out of sight, and then, when the
</p>
<p>moment of escape is past, he looks below to see if there be
</p>
<p>any danger, and there he spies Don Sanchez, regarding him
</p>
<p>from the open door, where he stands, as if to guard it.
</p>
<p>Without a sign the Don turns on his heel and goes back
</p>
<p>into the room, while Dawson, with a miserable hangdog
</p>
<p>look, comes to me in my chamber, where I am counting the
</p>
<p>gold, and confesses his folly with a shamed face, cursing
</p>
<p>himself freely for his indiscretion, which at this rate must
</p>
<p>ruin all ere long.
</p>
<p>This was no great surprise to me, for I myself had seen
</p>
<p>him many a time clip his dear daughter's hand, when he
</p>
<p>thought no one was by, and, more than once, the name of
</p>
<p>Moll had slipped out when he should have spoken of Mis-
</p>
<p>tress Judith.
</p>
<p>These accidents threw us both into a very grave humour,
</p>
<p>and especially I was tormented with the reflection that a
</p>
<p>forgery could be proved against me, if things came to the
</p>
<p>worst. The danger thereof was not slight ; for though all
</p>
<p>in the house loved Moll dearly and would willingly do her
</p>
<p>no hurt, yet the servants, should they notice how Mistress
</p>
<p>Judith stood with Captain Evans, must needs be prating,
</p>
<p>and there a mischief would begin, to end only the Lord
</p>
<p>knows where ! Thereupon, I thought it as well to preach
</p>
<p>Jack a sermon, and caution him to greater prudence ; and

<p>this he took in amazing good part not bidding me tend

</p>
<p>my own business as he might at another time, but assenting
</p>
<p>very submissively to all my hints of disaster, and thanking
</p>
<p>me in the end for speaking my mind so freely. Then, see-
</p>
<p>ing him so sadly downcast, I (to give a sweetmeat after a
</p>
<p>bitter draught) bade him take the matter not too much to
</p>
<p>heart, promising that, with a little practice, he would soon
</p>
<p>acquire a habit of self-restraint, and so all would go well.
</p>
<p>But he made no response, save by shaking of his head
</p>
<p>sorrowfully, and would not be comforted.
</p>
<p>When all were abed that night, we three men met in my
</p>
<p>chamber, where I had set the bags of money on the table,
</p>
<p>together with a dish of tobacco and a bottle of wine for our
</p>
<p>refreshment, and then the Don, having lit him a cigarro, and
</p>
<p>we our pipes, with full glasses beside us, I proposed we
</p>
<p>should talk of our affairs, to which Don Sanchez consented
</p>
<p>with a solemn inclination of his head. But ere I began, I
</p>
<p>observed with a pang of foreboding, that Jack, who usually
</p>
<p>had emptied his glass ere others had sipped theirs, did now
</p>
<p>leave his untouched, and after the first pull or two at his
</p>
<p>pipe, he cast it on the hearth as though it were foul to his
</p>
<p>taste. Taking no open notice of this, I showed Don San-
</p>
<p>chez the gold, and related all that had passed between
</p>
<p>Simon and me.
</p>
<p>" Happily, Sefior," says I, in conclusion, " here is just the
</p>
<p>sum you generously offered to accept for your share, and
</p>
<p>we give it you with a free heart, Evans and I being willing
</p>
<p>to wait for what may be forthcoming."
</p>
<p>" Is it your wish both, that I take this?" says he, laying
</p>
<p>his hand on the money and looking from me to Dawson.
</p>
<p>" Aye," says he, " 'tis but a tithe of what is left to us, and

</p>
<p>" Very good," says the Don. " I will carry it to London
</p>
<p>to-morrow."
</p>
<p>" But surely, Sefior," says I, " you will not quit us so soon."
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez rolls his cigarro in his lips, looking me straight
</p>
<p>in the face and somewhat sternly, and asks me quietly if I
</p>
<p>have ever found him lacking in loyalty and friendship.
</p>
<p>" In truth, never, Sefior."
</p>
<p>" Then why should you imagine I mean to quit you now
</p>
<p>when you have more need of a friend in this house " (with a
</p>
<p>sideward glance as towards Moll's chamber) " than ever you
</p>
<p>before had? " Then, turning towards Jack, he says, " What
</p>
<p>are you going to do, Captain Evans? "
</p>
<p>Dawson pauses, as if to snatch one last moment for con-
</p>
<p>sideration, and then, nodding at me, " You'll not leave my
</p>
<p>Moll, Kit?" says he, with no attempt to disguise names.
</p>
<p>" Why should I leave her ; are we not as brothers, you and
</p>
<p>I?"
</p>
<p>"Aye, I'd trust you with my life," answers he, " and more
</p>
<p>than that, with my Moll ! If you were her uncle, she
</p>
<p>couldn't love you more, Kit. And you will stand by her,
</p>
<p>too, Senor?"
</p>
<p>The Don bowed his head.
</p>
<p>"Then when you leave, to-morrow, I'll go with you to
</p>
<p>London," says Jack.
</p>
<p>" I shall return the next day," says Don Sanchez, with
</p>
<p>significance.
</p>
<p>" And I shall not, God help me ! " says Jack, bitterly.
</p>
<p>" Give me your hand," says the Don ; but I could speak
</p>
<p>never a word, and sat staring at Jack, in a maze.
</p>
<p>" We'll say nought of this to her," continues Jack ; " there

</p>
<p>shall seem that I have gone with you for company, and
</p>
<p>have fallen in with old comrades who would keep me for
</p>
<p>a carousing."
</p>
<p>"But with out friends alone what shall you do there
</p>
<p>in London?" says I, heart-stricken at the thought of his
</p>
<p>desolation. The Don answers for Jack.
</p>
<p>"Make the best of his lot with a stout heart, like any
</p>
<p>other brave man," says he. " There are natural hardships
</p>
<p>which every man must bear in his time, and this is one
</p>
<p>of them." Then lowering his voice, he adds, "Unless you
</p>
<p>would have her die an old maid, she and her father must
</p>
<p>part sooner or later."
</p>
<p>" Why, that's true, and yet, Master," says Jack, " I would
</p>
<p>have you know that I'm not so brave but I would see her
</p>
<p>now and then."
</p>
<p>" That may be ordered readily enough," says the Don.
</p>
<p>" Then do you tell her, Senor, I have but gone a-junketing,
</p>
<p>and she may look to see me again when my frolic's over."
</p>
<p>The Don closed his eyes as one in dubitation, and then
</p>
<p>says, lifting his eyebrows : " She is a clever woman shrewd
</p>
<p>beyond any I have ever known ; then why treat her as you
</p>
<p>would a foolish child? You must let me tell her the truth
</p>
<p>when I come back, and I warrant it will not break her heart,
</p>
<p>much as she loves you."
</p>
<p>" As you will," says t'other. " 'Twill be all as one to me,"
</p>
<p>with a sigh.
</p>
<p>"This falls out well in all ways," continues the Don,
</p>
<p>turning to me. " You will tell Simon, whose suspicion we
</p>
<p>have most to fear, that we have handed over four thousand
</p>
<p>of those pieces to Captain Evans as being most in need, we

</p>
<p>paid. That will account for Evans going away, and give us
</p>
<p>a pretext for staying here."
</p>
<p>" I'll visit him myself, if you will," says Jack, " and wring
</p>
<p>his hand to show my gratitude. I warrant I'll make him
</p>
<p>wince, such a grip will I give him. And I'll talk of nothing
</p>
<p>else but seas and winds, and the manner of ship I'll have
</p>
<p>for his money."
</p>
<p>The following morning before Moll was stirring, Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez and Dawson set forth on their journey, and I going
</p>
<p>with them beyond the park gates to the bend of the road,
</p>
<p>we took leave of each other with a great show of cheerful-
</p>
<p>ness on both sides. But Lord ! my heart lay in my breast
</p>
<p>like any lump of lead, and when Jack turned his back on
</p>
<p>me, the tears sprang up in my eyes as though indeed this
</p>
<p>was my brother and I was never to see him more. And
</p>
<p>long after he was out of sight I sat on the bank by the
</p>
<p>roadside, sick with pain to think of his sorrow in going
</p>
<p>forth like this, without one last loving word of parting from
</p>
<p>his dear Moll, to find no home in London, no friend to

<p>cheer him, and he the most companionable man in the

<p>CHAPTER XVTII.
</p>
<p>Of our getting a painter into the Court, with whom our Moll falls
</p>
<p>straightivay in love.
</p>
<p>BEING somewhat of a coward, I essayed to put Moll off
</p>
<p>with a story of her father having gone a- frolicking with
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez, leaving it to the Don to break the truth to
</p>
<p>her on his return. And a sorry, bungling business I made
</p>
<p>of it, to be sure. For, looking me straight in the eyes,
</p>
<p>whenever I dared lift them, she did seem to perceive that
</p>
<p>I was lying, from the very first, which so disconcerted me,
</p>
<p>though she interrupted me by never a word, that I could
</p>
<p>scarce stammer to the end of my tale. Then, without ask-
</p>
<p>ing a single question, or once breaking her painful silence,
</p>
<p>she laid her face in her hands, her shoulders shook, and the
</p>
<p>tears ran out between her fingers, and fell upon her lap.
</p>
<p>" I know, I know," says she, putting me away, when I
</p>
<p>attempted to speak. " He has gone away for my sake, and
</p>
<p>will come back no more ; and 'tis all my fault, that I could
</p>
<p>not play my part better."
</p>
<p>Then, what words of comfort I could find, I offered her ;
</p>
<p>but she would not be consoled, and shut herself up in her
</p>
<p>room all that morning. Nevertheless, she ate more heartily
</p>
<p>than I at dinner, and fresh visitors coming in the afternoon,
</p>
<p>she entertained them as though no grief lay at her heart.
</p>
<p>Indeed, she recovered of this cruel blow much easier than
</p>
<p>I looked for ; and but that she would at times sit pensive,
</p>
<p>with melancholy, wistful eyes, and rise from her seat with

<p>MOLL QUICKLY RECONCILED. 153
</p>
<p>a troubled sigh, one would have said, at the end of the week,
</p>
<p>that she had ceased to feel for her father. But this was not
</p>
<p>so (albeit wounds heal quickly in the young and healthful),
</p>
<p>for I believe that they who weep the least do ache the most.
</p>
<p>Then, for her further excuse (if it be needed), Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez brought back good tidings of her father, how he
</p>
<p>was neatly lodged near the Cherry garden, where he could
</p>
<p>hear the birds all day and the fiddles all night, with abun-
</p>
<p>dance of good entertainment, etc. To confirm which, she
</p>
<p>got a letter from him, three^ days later, very loving and
</p>
<p>cheerful, telling how, his landlord being a carpenter, he did
</p>
<p>amuse himself mightily at his old trade in the workshop,
</p>
<p>and was all agog for learning to turn wood in a lathe,
</p>
<p>promising that he would make her a set of egg-cups against
</p>
<p>her birthday, please God. Added to this, the number of
</p>
<p>her friends multiplying apace, every day brought some new
</p>
<p>occupation to her thoughts ; also, having now those three
</p>
<p>thousand pounds old Simon had promised us, Moll set
</p>
<p>herself to spending of them as quickly as possible, by fur-
</p>
<p>nishing herself with all sorts of rich gowns and appoint-
</p>
<p>ments, which is as pretty a diversion of melancholy from a
</p>
<p>young woman's thoughts as any. And so I think I need
</p>
<p>dwell no longer on this head.
</p>
<p>About the beginning of October, Simon comes, cap in
</p>
<p>hand, and very humble, to the Court to crave Moll's con-
</p>
<p>sent to his setting some men with guns in her park at night,
</p>
<p>to lie in ambush for poachers, telling how they had shot one
</p>
<p>man in the act last spring, and had hanged another the year
</p>
<p>before for stealing of a sheep ; adding that a stranger had
</p>
<p>been seen loitering in the neighbourhood, who, he doubted

</p>
<p>"What makes you think that?" asks Moll.
</p>
<p>"He has been seen lingering about here these three
</p>
<p>days," answers Simon. "Yet to my knowledge he hath not
</p>
<p>slept at either of the village inns. Moreover, he hath the
</p>
<p>look of a desperate, starving rascal, ripe for such work."
</p>
<p>" I will have no man killed for his misfortunes."
</p>
<p>" Gentle mistress, suffer me to point out that if thee lets
</p>
<p>one man steal with impunity, others, now innocent, are
</p>
<p>thereby encouraged to sin, and thus thy mercy tends to
</p>
<p>greater cruelty."
</p>
<p>" No man shall be killed on my land, there is my
</p>
<p>answer," says Moll, with passion. " If you take this poor,
</p>
<p>starved creature, it shall be without doing him bodily hurt.
</p>
<p>You shall answer for it else."
</p>
<p>" Not a bone shall be broken, mistress. Tis enough if
</p>
<p>we carry him before Justice Martin, a godly, upright man,
</p>
<p>and a scourge to evil-doers."
</p>
<p>" Nay, you shall not do that, neither, till I have heard his
</p>
<p>case," says Moll. " 'Tis for me to decide whether he has
</p>
<p>injured me or not, and I'll suffer none to take my place."
</p>
<p>Promising obedience, Simon withdrew before any further
</p>
<p>restrictions might be put upon him ; but Moll's mind was
</p>
<p>much disturbed all day by fear of mischief being done de-
</p>
<p>spite her commands, and at night she would have me take
</p>
<p>her round the park to see all well. Maybe, she thought that
</p>
<p>her own father, stealing hither to see her privily, might foil
</p>
<p>a victim to Simon's ambushed hirelings. But we found no
</p>
<p>one, though Simon had certainly hidden these fellows some-
</p>
<p>where in the thickets.
</p>
<p>Whilst we were at table next morning, we heard a great

<p>commotion in the hall; and Mrs. Butterby coming in a

</p>
<p>mighty pucker, told how the robber had been taken in the
</p>
<p>park, and how Simon had brought him to the house in
</p>
<p>obedience to her lady's command.
</p>
<p>" But do, pray, have a care of yourself, my dear lady," says
</p>
<p>she ; " for this hardy villain hath struck Mr. Simon in the
</p>
<p>face and made most desperate resistance ; and Heaven pro-
</p>
<p>tect us from such wicked outlaws as have the villany to
</p>
<p>show themselves in broad daylight ! "
</p>
<p>Moll, smiling, said she would rather face a lion in the
</p>
<p>day than a mouse by night, and so bade the captive to be
</p>
<p>brought before her.
</p>
<p>Then in comes Simon, with a stout band over one eye,
</p>
<p>followed by two sturdy fellows holding their prisoner betwixt
</p>
<p>them. And this was a very passionate man, as was evidenced
</p>
<p>by the looks of fury he cast from side to side upon his cap-
</p>
<p>tors as they dragged him this way and that to make a show
</p>
<p>of their power, but not ill-looking. In his struggles he had
</p>
<p>lost his hat, and his threadbare coat and shirt were torn
</p>
<p>open, laying bare his neck and showing a very fair white
</p>
<p>skin and a good beard of light curling hair. There was
</p>
<p>nought mean or vile in his face, but rather it seemed to me
</p>
<p>a noble countenance, though woefully wasted, so that at a
</p>
<p>glance one might perceive he was no born rascal, but likely
</p>
<p>enough some ruined man of better sort driven to unlawful
</p>
<p>ways by his distress. He was of a fair height, but gaunt
</p>
<p>beyond everything, and so feeble that after one effort to
</p>
<p>free his arms his chin sank upon his breast as if his forces
</p>
<p>were all spent.
</p>
<p>Seeing this, Moll bade the fellows unbind him, telling
</p>
<p>them sharply they might see there was no need of such

<p>reverence to Moll, but with little gratitude in his look, and
</p>
<p>places himself at the end of the table facing us, who are at
</p>
<p>the other end, Moll sitting betwixt Don Sanchez and me.
</p>
<p>And there, setting his hands for support upon the board, he
</p>
<p>holds his head up pretty proudly, waiting for what might
</p>
<p>come.
</p>
<p>" Who are you? " asks Moll, in a tone of authority.
</p>
<p>He waits a moment, as if deliberating with himself whether
</p>
<p>to speak fairly or not, then, being still sore with his ill-treat-
</p>
<p>ment, and angered to be questioned thus by a mere girl
</p>
<p>(he, as I take it, being a man of thirty or thereabouts), he
</p>
<p>answers :
</p>
<p>" I do not choose to tell. Who I am, what I am, con-
</p>
<p>cerns you no more than who and what you are concerns me,
</p>
<p>and less since I may justly demand by what right these fel-
</p>
<p>lows, whom I take to be your servants, have thus laid hands
</p>
<p>on me."
</p>
<p>" How do you answer this? " asks Moll, turning to Simon.
</p>
<p>Then Simon told very precisely, as if he were before a
</p>
<p>magistrate, how this man, having been seen lingering about
</p>
<p>the Court several days, and being without home or occupa-
</p>
<p>tion, had been suspected of felonious purposes ; how, there-
</p>
<p>fore, he had set a watch to lay wait for him ; how that morn-
</p>
<p>ing they had entrapped him standing within a covert of the
</p>
<p>park regarding the house ; how he had refused to give his
</p>
<p>name or any excuse for his being there, and how he had
</p>
<p>made most desperate attempt to escape when they had lain
</p>
<p>hands on him.
</p>
<p>" Is this true? " asks Moll of the prisoner.

</p>
<p>"Yes," says he.
</p>
<p>MOLLS GENTLE SPEECH. 1 57
</p>
<p>Moll regards him with incredulous eyes a moment, then,
</p>
<p>turning to Simon, " What arms had he for this purpose that
</p>
<p>you speak of ? " says she.
</p>
<p>"None, mistress; but 'twould be a dread villain verily
</p>
<p>who would carry the engines of his trade abroad in daylight
</p>
<p>to betray him." And then he told how 'tis the habit of
</p>
<p>these poachers to reconnoitre their ground by day, and keep
</p>
<p>their nets, guns, etc., concealed in some thicket or hollow
</p>
<p>tree convenient for their purpose. " But," adds he, " we
</p>
<p>may clearly prove a trespass against him, which is a pun-
</p>
<p>ishable offence, and this assault upon me, whereof I have
</p>
<p>evidence, shall also count for something with Justice Martin,
</p>
<p>and so the wicked shall yet come by their deserts." And
</p>
<p>with that he gives his fellows a wink with his one eye to
</p>
<p>carry off their quarry.
</p>
<p>"Stay," says Moll, "I would be further convinced "
</p>
<p>" If he be an honest man, let him show thee his hand,"
</p>
<p>says Simon.
</p>
<p>The man innocently enough stretches out his palm towards
</p>
<p>us, not perceiving Simon's end.
</p>
<p>"There ! " cries Simon. "What said I? Is that a hand
</p>
<p>that ever did a day's honest work? "
</p>
<p>" 'Tis no worse than mine," says Moll, regarding the
</p>
<p>hand which in truth was exceeding smooth and well formed.
</p>
<p>" Come," adds she, still more kindly, " you see I am no
</p>
<p>harsh judge. I would not deny a fellow-creature the
</p>
<p>pleasure that is not grudged the coney that runs across my
</p>
<p>lawn. Tell me you were there but to gratify a passing
</p>
<p>caprice, and I'll forgive you as freely as I'll believe you."
</p>
<p>This gentle appeal seemed to move the young man

<p>greatly, and he made as if he would do more than was
</p>
<p>158 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>demanded of him, and make that free confession which he
</p>
<p>had refused to force. But ere a word could leave his
</p>
<p>parted lips a deadly shade passed over his face, his knees
</p>
<p>gave under him, and staggering to save himself, he fell to the
</p>
<p>ground in a swoon.
</p>
<p>Then, whilst all we men stood fixed in wonderment, Moll,
</p>
<p>with the quick, helpful impulse of her womanhood, ran
</p>
<p>swiftly from her place to his side, and dropping on her
</p>
<p>knees cried for water to be brought her.
</p>
<p>" Dead of hunger," says Don Sanchez, in my ear. " Fetch
</p>
<p>a flask of brandy."
</p>
<p>And then, laying hold of Simon by the shoulder, he
</p>
<p>pointed significantly to the open door. This hint Simon
</p>
<p>was not slow to take, and when I returned from the buttery
</p>
<p>with a case of strong waters, I found no one in the room but
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez, and Moll with the fainting man's head upon
</p>
<p>her lap, bathing his temples gently. Life had not come
</p>
<p>back, and the young man's face looked very handsome in
</p>
<p>death, the curls pushed back from his brow, and his long
</p>
<p>features still and colourless like a carved marble.
</p>
<p>Then with a " lack-a-day " and " alas," in bustles Mrs.
</p>
<p>Butterby with a bottle of cordial in one hand and a bunch
</p>
<p>of burning feathers in the other.
</p>
<p>" Fling that rubbish in the chimney," says the Don. " I
</p>
<p>know this malady well enough," and pouring some hoi-
</p>
<p>lands in a cup he put it to the dead man's parted lips.
</p>
<p>In a few moments he breathed again, and hearing Moll's
</p>
<p>cry of joy, he opened his eyes as one waking from a dream
</p>
<p>and turned his head to learn what had happened. Then
</p>
<p>finding his head in Moll's lap and her small, soft, cool hand

</p>
<p>upon his brow, a smile played over his wasted face. And
</p>
<p>THE STRICKEN MAN RECOVERS HIS LIFE. 159
</p>
<p>well, indeed, might he smile to see that young figure of
</p>
<p>justice turned to the living image of tender mercy.
</p>
<p>Perceiving him out of danger, and recovering her own wits
</p>
<p>at the same time, Mrs. Butterby cries : " Lord ! Madam, do
</p>
<p>let me call a maid to take your place ; for, dear heart ! you
</p>
<p>have quite spoiled your new gown with this mess of water,
</p>
<p>and all for such a paltry fellow as this ! "
</p>
<p>Truly, it must have seemed to her understanding an out-
</p>
<p>rageous thing that a lady of her mistress' degree should be
</p>
<p>nursing such a ragged rascal ; but to me, knowing Moll's
</p>
<p>helpful, impulsive disposition, 'twas no such extraordinary
</p>
<p>matter, for she at such a moment could not entertain those
</p>
<p>feelings which might have restrained a lady of more refined
</p>
<p>breeding.
</p>
<p>The pretty speech of Mrs. Butterby, reaching the fallen
</p>
<p>man's ear, seemed instantly to quicken his spirits, and, cast-
</p>
<p>ing off his lethargic humour, he quickly staggered to his feet,
</p>
<p>while we raised Moll. Then, resting one hand upon the
</p>
<p>table for support, he craved her pardon for giving so much
</p>
<p>trouble, but in a very faint, weak voice.
</p>
<p>"I would have done as much for a dog," says Moll.
</p>
<p>" My friends will render you what further services are fit ;
</p>
<p>and, if it appears that you have been unjustly used (as I do
</p>
<p>think you have), be sure you shall have reparation."
</p>
<p>" I ask no more," says he, " than to be treated as I may
</p>
<p>merit in your esteem."
</p>
<p>" Justice shall be done," says Don Sanchez, in his stern
</p>
<p>voice, and with that he conducts Moll to the door.
</p>
<p>But Moll was not content with this promise of justice.
</p>
<p>For the quality of mercy begetteth love, so that one cannot

</p>
<p>greater compassion and leniency by making one better con-
</p>
<p>tent with oneself, and therefore more indulgent to others.
</p>
<p>And so, when she had left the room, she sends in her maid
</p>
<p>to fetch me, and taking me aside says with vivacity :
</p>
<p>" I will have no punishment made upon that man."
</p>
<p>" Nay," says I, " but if 'tis proved that his intent was to
</p>
<p>rob you "
</p>
<p>" What then ! " says she. " Hath he not as much right
</p>
<p>to this estate as we ? And are we one whit the better than
</p>
<p>he, save in the more fortunate issue of our designs ? Under-
</p>
<p>stand me," adds she, with passion ; " I will have nothing
</p>
<p>added to his unhappiness."
</p>
<p>I found the young man seated at the table, and Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez gravely setting food before him. But he would
</p>
<p>take nothing but bread, and that he ate as though it were
</p>
<p>the sweetest meat in all the world. I lead the Don to the
</p>
<p>window, and there, in an undertone, told him of Moll's
</p>
<p>decision ; and, whether her tone of supreme authority
</p>
<p>amused him or not, I cannot say, because of his impassive
</p>
<p>humour, but he answered me with a serious inclination of
</p>
<p>his head, and then we fell speaking of other matters in our
</p>
<p>usual tone, until the young man, having satisfied the cravings
</p>
<p>of nature, spoke :
</p>
<p>"When you are at liberty, gentlemen," says he, "to

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX.
</p>
<p>Of the business appointed to the painter, and how he set about the same.
</p>
<p>THE young man had risen and was standing by the table
</p>
<p>when we turned from the window; he seemed greatly re-
</p>
<p>freshed, his face had lost its livid hue of passion and
</p>
<p>death, and looked the better for a tinge of colour. He
</p>
<p>met our regard boldly, yet with no braggart, insolent air,
</p>
<p>but the composure of a brave man facing his trial with
</p>
<p>a consciousness of right upon his side.
</p>
<p>"I would ask you," says the Don, seating himself on
</p>
<p>t'other side the table, "why you refused to do that
</p>
<p>before?"
</p>
<p>"Sir," answers he, "I have lost everything in the world
</p>
<p>save some small modicum of pride, which, being all I have,
</p>
<p>I do cherish, maybe, unduly. And so, when these unman-
</p>
<p>nerly hinds took me by the throat, calling on me to tell my
</p>
<p>name and business, this spirit within me flaring up, I could
</p>
<p>not answer with the humility of a villain seeking to slink
</p>
<p>out of danger by submissive excuses."
</p>
<p>"Be seated," says the Don, accepting this explanation
</p>
<p>with a bow. " How may we call you? "
</p>
<p>"In Venice," replies the other, with some hesitation,
</p>
<p>"I was called Dario a name given me by my fellow-
</p>
<p>scholars because my English name was not to their taste."
</p>
<p>"Enough," says the Don. "I can understand a man of
</p>
<p>better fortune, as I perceive you have been, wishing in
</p>
<p>such a position as this to retain his incognito. There are

<p>1 62 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>no parks in Venice, to my knowledge, but surely, sir, you
</p>
<p>would not enter a palazzo there uninvited without some
</p>
<p>reasonable pretext."
</p>
<p>" It would be sufficient that in such a house as this I
</p>
<p>thought I might find some employment for a painter."
</p>
<p>"You are a painter? " says I.
</p>
<p>"A poor one, as you see," replies Dario, with a signifi-
</p>
<p>cant glance at his clothes.
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez turned to me, hunching his shoulders.
</p>
<p>"'Tis clear," says he, "that Signor Dario has been
</p>
<p>grossly abused by our lady's over-zealous steward. You
</p>
<p>have but to tell us, sir, what reparation we can make
</p>
<p>you."
</p>
<p>"I'll not refuse it," answers Dario, eagerly. "You
</p>
<p>shall grant me permission to prove the honesty of my
</p>
<p>story and something more than that. Somewhere
</p>
<p>here," adds he, glancing around him, "I'd leave a tribute
</p>
<p>to the grace of that dear lady who brought me back to life."
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez assents with a bow to this proposal, but
</p>
<p>with a rueful glance at the rich panels of the wall, as fear-
</p>
<p>ing this painter might be as poor in talent as in his clothes
</p>
<p>the latter reflecting discredit on the former and would
</p>
<p>disfigure the handsome walls with some rude daub.
</p>
<p>"Ah!" cries Dario, casting his eye upon the ceiling,
</p>
<p>which was plastered in the Italian mode and embellished
</p>
<p>with a poor design of cherubs and clouds, " this ceiling is
</p>
<p>ill done. I could paint a fresco that would less disgrace
</p>
<p>the room."
</p>
<p>"You will need materials," says the Don, laying his
</p>
<p>purse upon the table. " When you return with them, you

</p>
<p>may rely upon having our lady's consent to your wishes."
</p>
<p>DARIO NO OUTLAW, BUT A POOR PAINTER. 163
</p>
<p>The painter took the purse with a bow of acknowledgment,
</p>
<p>and no more hesitation than one gentleman would show in
</p>
<p>receiving an obligation from another, and presently left us.
</p>
<p>"Shall we see him again, think ye, Senor?" I asked
</p>
<p>when we were left to ourselves.
</p>
<p>He nodded, but with such a reflective, sombre air, that
</p>
<p>I was impelled to ask him if he lacked confidence in the
</p>
<p>story told us by the painter.
</p>
<p>"His story may be true enough, but whether Signor
</p>
<p>Dario be an honest man or not is another matter. A
</p>
<p>painter's but a man. A ruined gentleman will accommodate
</p>
<p>his principles to circumstances " (with a side glance that
</p>
<p>seemed to say, "I am a ruined gentleman") "and my
</p>
<p>mind would be easier if I knew by what curious accident
</p>
<p>a painter in need should find himself in the heart of Kent,
</p>
<p>and why fixing on this house to seek employment he should
</p>
<p>linger to the point of starvation before he can pluck up
</p>
<p>courage to ask a simple question. We must keep our eyes
</p>
<p>open, Mr. Hopkins, and," adds he, dropping his voice,
</p>
<p>"our mouths shut."
</p>
<p>I could not sleep that night for thinking of house-
</p>
<p>breakings and bloody struggles for dear life; for 'tis a
</p>
<p>matter of common report that this sort of robbers, ere they
</p>
<p>make attack, do contrive to get one of their number into
</p>
<p>the house that he may learn where good goods are stowed,
</p>
<p>which part is easiest of attack, etc.
</p>
<p>I know not whether these quakings were shared by the
</p>
<p>Don, but certainly our misgivings never entered Moll's little
</p>
<p>head. Nay, rather, her romantic disposition did lead her
</p>
<p>(when she heard our narration) to conceive that this mys-

</p>
<p>terious Dario might be some wandering genius, whose work
</p>
<p>164 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>upon our ceiling would make the Court for ever glorious.
</p>
<p>And while in this humour she bade me go to Simon, whose
</p>
<p>presence she would not tolerate in her house, and make
</p>
<p>him acquainted with her high displeasure, and further-
</p>
<p>more, to command that he should make satisfactory apol-
</p>
<p>ogy to Dario upon his return. So to him I went, and he
</p>
<p>wringing his hands in anguish deplored that his best
</p>
<p>endeavours to serve his mistress served only to incense her
</p>
<p>the more against him. But for his apology he declared
</p>
<p>that has been made the moment he heard of the gentleman's
</p>
<p>release, at the same time that he restored to him his hat
</p>
<p>and a pocket-book which had fallen from his pocket.
</p>
<p>This did somewhat reassure me, knowing full well that
</p>
<p>Simon would not have given up this book without first
</p>
<p>acquainting himself with its contents, and urging that had
</p>
<p>there been anything in it to incriminate him, he had cer-
</p>
<p>tainly laid it before his mistress for his own justification.
</p>
<p>A couple of days after this, as Don Sanchez and I were
</p>
<p>discoursing in the great avenue, Dario presents himself,
</p>
<p>looking all the better for a decent suit of clothes and a
</p>
<p>more prosperous condition, and Moll joining us at that
</p>
<p>moment, he makes her a very handsome obeisance and
</p>
<p>standing uncovered before her, begs to know if it is her
</p>
<p>will that he should paint the ceiling of her dining-hall.
</p>
<p>As he spoke, the colour rose on his cheek, and a shaft
</p>
<p>of sunlight falling on his curling hair, which shone with
</p>
<p>the lustre of health, made him look as comely a man as
</p>
<p>ever I did see, and a good five years younger than when he
</p>
<p>stood before us in the extremity of distress.
</p>
<p>"Sir," says Moll, "were you my debtor as much as I am

<p>yours, I could not ask for better payment."
</p>
<p>MOLL'S ROMANTIC FANCIES UPSET. 165
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez put an end to this pretty exchange of cour-
</p>
<p>tesies which maybe he considered overmuch as between
</p>
<p>a lady of Moll's degree and one who might turn out to be
</p>
<p>no more than an indifferent painter at the best by pro-
</p>
<p>posing that Dario should point out what disposition he
</p>
<p>would have made for his convenience in working. So he
</p>
<p>went within doors, and there Dario gave orders to our gar-
</p>
<p>dener, who was a handy sort of Jack-of-all-trades, what
</p>
<p>pieces of furniture should be removed, how the walls and
</p>
<p>floor should be protected, and how a scaffold should be set
</p>
<p>up for him to work on. And the gardener promising to
</p>
<p>carry out all these instructions in the course of the day,
</p>
<p>Dario took his leave of us in a very polished style, saying
</p>
<p>he would begin his business the next morning betimes.
</p>
<p>Sure enough, we were awoke next day by a scraping
</p>
<p>below, and coming down, we found our painter in a scull-
</p>
<p>cap and a smock that covered him to his heels, upon his
</p>
<p>scaffold, preparing the ceiling in a very workmanlike man-
</p>
<p>ner. And to see him then, with his face and beard thickly
</p>
<p>crusted over with a mess of dry plaster and paint, did I
</p>
<p>think somewhat dispel those fanciful illusions which our
</p>
<p>Moll had fostered she, doubtless, expecting to find him
</p>
<p>in a very graceful attitude and beautiful to look at, cre-
</p>
<p>ating a picture as if by inchantment. Her mortification
</p>
<p>was increased later in the day when, we having invited him
</p>
<p>on her insistence to dine at our table, he declined (civilly
</p>
<p>enough), saying he had brought his repast with him, and
</p>
<p>we presently found him seated astride one of his planks
</p>
<p>with a pocket knife in one hand and a thumb-piece of
</p>
<p>bread and bacon in the other, which he seemed to be eating

</p>
<p>with all the relish in the world.
</p>
<p>l66 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>" Why, he is nought but a common labourer," says Moll,
</p>
<p>disgusted to see him regaling himself in this fashion, as
</p>
<p>we returned to our room. " A pretty picture we are like to
</p>
<p>get for all this mess and inconvenience ! "
</p>
<p>And her idol being broken (as it were), and all her foncl
</p>
<p>fancies dashed, she would not as much as look at him again
</p>
<p>nor go anigh the room, to be reminded of her folly.
</p>
<p>However, on the third day Dario sent to ask if she would
</p>
<p>survey his outlines and decide whether the design pleased
</p>
<p>her or not. For this purpose he had pushed aside his
</p>
<p>scaffold, and here we saw a perspective done on the ceiling
</p>
<p>in charcoal, representing a vaulted roof with an opening to
</p>
<p>the sky in the middle, surrounded by a little balcony with
</p>
<p>trailing plants running over it, and flowers peeping out
</p>
<p>betwixt the balusters. And this, though very rough, was
</p>
<p>most artificial, making the room look twice its height, and
</p>
<p>the most admirable, masterly drawing that I did ever see.
</p>
<p>And now Moll, who had prepared a courteous speech to
</p>
<p>cover the contempt she expected to feel for the work, could
</p>
<p>say nought for astonishment, but stood casting her eyes
</p>
<p>round at the work like one in a maze.
</p>
<p>" If you would prefer an allegory of figures," says Dario,
</p>
<p>misconceiving her silence.
</p>
<p>" Nay," answers she, " I would have nothing altered.
</p>
<p>Tis wonderful how such effect can be made with mere lines
</p>
<p>of black. I can scarce believe the ceiling is flat." And then
</p>
<p>she drops her eyes upon Dario, regarding him with wonder,
</p>
<p>as if doubting that such a dirty-looking man could have
</p>
<p>worked this miracle.
</p>
<p>" You must have seen better designs in Rome," says he.

<p>At this I took alarm, not thinking for the moment that he
</p>

</p>
<p>might have picked up some particulars of Judith Godwin's
</p>
<p>history from Mrs. Butterby, or the curious servants who
</p>
<p>were ever prying in the room.
</p>
<p>" Tis so long ago," says Moll, readily.
</p>
<p>" I think I have seen something like it in the Holy City,"
</p>
<p>observes the Don, critically.
</p>
<p>" Probably. Nothing has been left undone in Rome
</p>
<p>I am told. It has not been my good fortune to get so far."
</p>
<p>This was good news j for otherwise he might have put
</p>
<p>some posers to Moll, which she had found it hard to
</p>
<p>answer without betraying her ignorance.
</p>
<p>Having Moll's approval, Dario set to work forthwith to
</p>
<p>colour his perspective ; and this he did with the sure firm
</p>
<p>hand of one who understands his business, and with such
</p>
<p>nice judgment, that no builder, whose design is ordered by
</p>
<p>fixed rule and line, could accomplish his work with greater
</p>
<p>truth and justice. He made it to appear that the lower
</p>
<p>part of his vaulted roof was wainscoted in the style of the
</p>
<p>walls, and to such perfection that 'twould have puzzled
</p>
<p>a conjurer to decide where the oaken panels ended and
</p>
<p>the painted ones began.
</p>
<p>And now Moll suffers her fancies to run wild again, and
</p>
<p>could not sufficiently marvel over this poor painter and his
</p>
<p>work, of which she would discourse to such lengths, that
</p>
<p>both the Don and I at times had some ado to stifle our
</p>
<p>yawns. She would have it that he was no common man,
</p>
<p>but some great genius, compelled by misfortune or the per-
</p>
<p>secution of rivals, to wander abroad in disguise, taking for
</p>
<p>evidence the very facts which had lately led her to condemn
</p>
<p>him, pointing out that, whereas those young gentlemen who

<p>courted her so persistently did endeavour, on all occasions,
</p>
<p>1 68 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>to make their estate and natural parts appear greater than
</p>
<p>they were, this Dario did not, proving that he had no such
</p>
<p>need of fictitious advancement, and could well afford to let
</p>
<p>the world judge of his worth by his works, etc. This point
</p>
<p>we did not contest, only we were very well content to
</p>
<p>observe that he introduced no one into the house, had no
</p>
<p>friends in the village (to our knowledge), and that nought
</p>
<p>was lacking from our store of plate.
</p>
<p>She never tired of watching him at his work having the
</p>
<p>hardihood to mount upon the scaffold where he stood, and
</p>
<p>there she would sit by the hour on a little stool, chatting like
</p>
<p>any magpie, when the nature of his occupation allowed his
</p>
<p>thoughts to wander, silent as a mouse when she perceived
</p>
<p>that his mind was absorbed in travail ready at any
</p>
<p>moment to fetch this or hold t'other, and seizing every
</p>
<p>opportunity to serve him. Indeed, I believe she would
</p>
<p>gladly have helped him shift the heavy planks, when he
</p>
<p>would have their position altered, had he permitted her this
</p>
<p>rough usage of her delicate hands. One day, when he was
</p>
<p>about to begin the foliage upon his balcony, he brought in
</p>
<p>a spray of ivy for a model ; then Moll told him she knew
</p>
<p>where much better was to be found, and would have him
</p>
<p>go with her to see it. And she, coming back from this
</p>
<p>expedition, with her arms full of briony and herbage, richly
</p>
<p>tinted by the first frost, I perceived that there was a new
</p>
<p>kind of beauty in her face, a radiance of great happiness
</p>
<p>and satisfaction which I had never seen there before.
</p>
<p>Here was herbage enough for a week, but she must have
</p>
<p>fresh the next morning, and thenceforth every day they
</p>
<p>would go out ere the sun was high, hunting for new models.

</p>
<p>though commonly disposed to lie abed late in the morning,
</p>
<p>must have been up by daybreak. And, despite her admira-
</p>
<p>tion of Dario's simplicity in dress, she showed no inclina-
</p>
<p>tion to follow his example in this particular; but, on the
</p>
<p>contrary, took more pains in adorning her person at this
</p>
<p>time than ever she had done before ; and as she would
</p>
<p>dress her hair no two mornings alike, so she would change
</p>
<p>the fashion of her dress with the same inconstancy until the
</p>
<p>sly hussy discovered which did most please Dario's taste;
</p>
<p>then a word of approval from him, nay, a glance, would suf-
</p>
<p>fice to fix her choice until she found that his admiration
</p>
<p>needed rekindling. And so, as if her own imagination was
</p>
<p>not sufficiently forcible, she would talk of nothing with her
</p>
<p>friends but the newest fashions at court, with the result that
</p>
<p>her maids were for ever a-brewing some new wash for her
</p>
<p>face (which she considered too brown), compounding
</p>
<p>charms to remove a little mole she had in the nape of
</p>
<p>her neck, cutting up one gown to make another, and so
</p>
<p>forth. One day she presented herself with a black patch at
</p>
<p>the corner of her lip, and having seen nought of this fashion
</p>
<p>before, I cried out in alarm :
</p>
<p>" Lord, child ! have you injured your face with that mess
</p>
<p>Betty was stewing yesterday?"
</p>
<p>" What an absurd, old-fashioned creature you are ! " an-
</p>
<p>swers she, testily. " Don't you know that 'tis the mode
</p>
<p>now for ladies to wear spots? Signor Dario," adds she,
</p>
<p>her eyes lighting up, " finds it mighty becoming."
</p>
<p>When I saw her thus disfiguring her pretty face (as I
</p>
<p>considered it then, though I came to admire this embellish-
</p>
<p>ment later on) to please Signor Dario, I began to ask

<p>CHAPTER XX.
</p>
<p>Of MoWs ill humour and what befel thereby.
</p>
<p>FEELING, in the absence of Dawson, that I stood in the
</p>
<p>position of a guardian to his daughter, and was responsible
</p>
<p>for her welfare, my mind grew very uneasy about the conse-
</p>
<p>quences of her extravagant admiration for the painter ; and,
</p>
<p>knowing that Don Sanchez, despite his phlegmatic humour,
</p>
<p>loved Moll very sincerely at heart, I took him aside one day,
</p>
<p>and asked him if he had observed nothing particular in Moll's
</p>
<p>behaviour of late.
</p>
<p>" One would be blind," says he, "not to see that she is
</p>
<p>enamoured of Dario, if that's what you mean."
</p>
<p>I admitted that my suspicions inclined that way, and, ex-
</p>
<p>plaining my concern on her behalf, I asked him what he
</p>
<p>would do in my place.
</p>
<p>" In my country," says he, " matters never would have
</p>
<p>been suffered to go so far, and Mistress Judith would have
</p>
<p>been shut up a prisoner in her room these past three weeks.
</p>
<p>But I doubt if our maidens are any the safer or better for
</p>
<p>such treatment, and I am quite sure that such treatment
</p>
<p>would be worse than useless for an English girl, and espe-
</p>
<p>cially such an one as this. For, guard her how you might,
</p>
<p>she would assuredly find means to break her prison, and
</p>
<p>then no course is open to her but to throw herself in the
</p>
<p>arms of the man she loves, trusting to mere accident whether
</p>
<p>he abuses her devotion or not. You might as well strive to

<p>SOUND ADVICE BUT UNPALATABLE. 171
</p>
<p>catch the wind and hold it as stay and stem the course of
</p>
<p>youthful passion."
</p>
<p>"Aye, Senor," says I, "this may be all very true. But
</p>
<p>what should you do in my place? "
</p>
<p>" Nothing," says he.
</p>
<p>This was a piece of advice which set me scratching my
</p>
<p>head in dubitation.
</p>
<p>"Beware," continues he, " how you suggest the thing you
</p>
<p>fear to one who needs but a hint to act. I have great faith
</p>
<p>in the natural modesty of women (and I do think no child
</p>
<p>more innocent than Mistress Judith), which, though it blind
</p>
<p>them to their danger, does, at the same time, safeguard them
</p>
<p>against secret and illicit courses of more fatal consequences.
</p>
<p>Let her discourse with him, openly, since it pleases her. In
</p>
<p>another fortnight or so Dario's work will be finished, he
</p>
<p>will go away, our young lady will shed secret tears and be
</p>
<p>downcast for a week. Then another swain will please her,
</p>
<p>and she'll smile again. That, as I take it, will be the natural
</p>
<p>order of events, unless," adds he, " that natural order is dis-
</p>
<p>turbed by some external influence."
</p>
<p>Maugre this sage advice, my concern being unabated, I
</p>
<p>would step pretty frequently into the room where these young
</p>
<p>people were, as if to see how the work was going forward,
</p>
<p>and with such a quick step that had any interchange of
</p>
<p>amorous sentiments existed, I must at one time or another
</p>
<p>have discovered it. But I never detected any sign of this
</p>
<p>no bashful silence, no sudden confusion, or covert inter-
</p>
<p>change of glances. Sometimes they would be chatting
</p>
<p>lightly, at others both would be standing silent, she, maybe,
</p>
<p>holding a bunch of leaves with untiring steadfastness, for

</p>
<p>him to copy. But I observed that she was exceedingly
</p>
<p>172 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>jealous of his society, and no matter how glibly she was talking
</p>
<p>when I entered, or how indifferent the subject, she would
</p>
<p>quickly become silent, showing me very plainly by her man-
</p>
<p>ner that she would vastly prefer my room to my company.
</p>
<p>Still, I was not displeased when I perceived this fresco
</p>
<p>drawing near to its completion.
</p>
<p>"You are getting on apace," says I, very cheerfully one
</p>
<p>day. " I reckon you will soon have done."
</p>
<p>"Yes," answers he, "in a week I shall have nought to do
</p>
<p>but to pack up my tools and go."
</p>
<p>There was an accent of sorrow in his voice, despite him-
</p>
<p>self, which did not escape me nor Moll neither, for I saw
</p>
<p>her cast her eyes upon his face, as if to read if there were
</p>
<p>sadness there. But she said never a word.
</p>
<p>However, in the afternoon she comes to me, and says she :
</p>
<p>" I am resolved I will have all the rooms in the house
</p>
<p>plastered, if Signer Dario will consent to paint them."
</p>
<p>" All the rooms ! " says I, in alarm. " Surely you have
</p>
<p>not counted the cost of what you propose."
</p>
<p>" I suppose I have enough to keep my house in suitable
</p>
<p>condition."
</p>
<p>" Without doubt, though I expect such work as Signer
</p>
<p>Dario's must command a high price."
</p>
<p>"All I ask of you, then," says she, "is to bid my steward
</p>
<p>have five thousand pounds ready for my uses, and within
</p>
<p>a week, lest I should need it suddenly. Should he raise
</p>
<p>objections "
</p>
<p>" As assuredly he will," says I, who knew the crafty,
</p>
<p>subtle character of old Simon full well by this time. " A
</p>
<p>thousand objections, and not one you can pick a hole in."

<p>"Then show him this and tell him I accept Mr. Good-
</p>
<p>MORE MONEY TO BE STOLE. 1/3
</p>
<p>man's offer unless he can find more profitable means of
</p>
<p>raising money."
</p>
<p>With that she puts in my hand a letter she had that morn-
</p>
<p>ing received from one Henry Goodman, a tenant, who
</p>
<p>having heard that she had disposed of a farm to his neigh-
</p>
<p>bour, now humbly prayed she would do him the same
</p>
<p>good turn by selling him the land he rented, and for which
</p>
<p>he was prepared to pay down in ready money the sum of
</p>
<p>five thousand pounds.
</p>
<p>Armed with this letter, I sought Simon and delivered Moll's
</p>
<p>message. As I expected, the wily old man had good excuses
</p>
<p>ready for not complying with this request, showing me the
</p>
<p>pains he had taken to get the king's seal, his failures to move
</p>
<p>the king's officers, and the refusal of his goldsmith to furnish
</p>
<p>further supplies before the deed of succession was passed.
</p>
<p>" These objections are all very just," says I, " so I see no
</p>
<p>way of pleasing our lady but by selling Mr. Goodman's farm,
</p>
<p>which she will have done at once if there be no alternative."
</p>
<p>So I give him the letter, which he can scarce read for
</p>
<p>trembling with anguish.
</p>
<p>" What," cries he, coming to the end, " I am to sell this
</p>
<p>land which I bought for nine hundred pounds and is now
</p>
<p>worth six thousand? I would rather my mistress had bid
</p>
<p>me have the last teeth torn from my head."
</p>
<p>" We must have money," says I.
</p>
<p>" Thee shalt have it in good time. Evans hath been paid,
</p>
<p>and thy debt shall be discharged ; fear not."
</p>
<p>" I spoke as representing our lady ; for ourselves we are
</p>
<p>content to wait her better convenience." And I told him
</p>
<p>how his mistress would lay out her money in embellishing

</p>
<p>think so much good money should be wasted in such
</p>
<p>vanities.
</p>
<p>" But," says he, " this work must take time, and one pays
</p>
<p>for nothing ere 'tis done. By quarter day our rents will be
</p>
<p>coming in again "
</p>
<p>" No," says I, cutting him short, " the money must be
</p>
<p>found at once, or be assured that your lady will take the
</p>
<p>management of her affairs out of your hands."
</p>
<p>This raised a fresh outcry and more lamentations, but in
</p>
<p>the end he promised to procure the money by collecting
</p>
<p>his rents in advance, if his mistress would refuse Mr. Good-
</p>
<p>man's offer and wait three weeks; and on Moll's behalf I
</p>
<p>agreed to these terms.
</p>
<p>A few days after this, we were called into the dining-hall
</p>
<p>to see the finished ceiling, which truly deserved all the
</p>
<p>praise we could bestow upon it, and more. For now that
</p>
<p>the sky appeared through the opening, with a little pearly
</p>
<p>cloud creeping across it, the verdure and flowers falling
</p>
<p>over the marble coping, and the sunlight falling on one side
</p>
<p>and throwing t'other into shade, the illusion was complete,
</p>
<p>so that one could scarcely have been more astonished had
</p>
<p>a leaf fallen from the hanging flowers or a face looked over
</p>
<p>the balcony. In short, 'twas prodigious.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the painter, looking up at his work with
</p>
<p>half -closed, critical eyes, seemed dissatisfied, and asking
</p>
<p>us if we found nothing lacking, we (not to appear behind-
</p>
<p>hand in judgment) agreed that on one side there was a
</p>
<p>vacant place which might yet be adorned to advantage.
</p>
<p>"Yes," says he, "I see what is wanted and will supply
</p>
<p>it. That," adds he, gently turning to Moll, "will give me

<p>still another day."
</p>
<p>MOLL DISPUTES WITH DARIO. 1/5
</p>
<p>"Why, what charm can you add that is not there? " asks
</p>
<p>she.
</p>
<p>"Something," says he, in a low voice, "which I must
</p>
<p>see whenever I do cast my eyes heavenwards."
</p>
<p>And now Moll, big with her purpose, which she had
</p>
<p>hitherto withheld from Dario, begs him to come into her
</p>
<p>state room, and there she told how she would have this
</p>
<p>ceiling plastered over and painted, like her dining-hall, if
</p>
<p>he would undertake to do it.
</p>
<p>Dario casts his eye round the room and over the ceil-
</p>
<p>ing, and then, shaking his head, says : " If I were in your
</p>
<p>place, I would alter nothing here."
</p>
<p>"But I will have it altered," says she, nettled, because
</p>
<p>he did not leap at once at her offer, which was made rather
</p>
<p>to prolong their communion than to obtain a picture.
</p>
<p>"I detest these old-fashioned beams of wood."
</p>
<p>" They are in keeping with the character of the room. I
</p>
<p>think," adds he, looking round him again with renewed
</p>
<p>admiration, "I think I have never seen a more perfect
</p>
<p>example of English art."
</p>
<p>"What of that," cries she, "if it pleases me to have it
</p>
<p>otherwise? "
</p>
<p>"Nothing," returns he, calmly. "You have as just a
</p>
<p>right to stand by your opinion as I by mine."
</p>
<p>"And am I to understand that you will rather hold by
</p>
<p>your opinion than give me pleasure? "
</p>
<p>"I pray you, do not press me to discourtesy," says he.
</p>
<p>"Nay, but I would have a plain answer to my question,"
</p>
<p>says she, haughtily.
</p>
<p>"Then," says he, angering in his turn, "I must tell you

<p>that I would as soon chip an antique statue to suit the
</p>
<p>1/6 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>taste of a French modiste as disfigure the work of him who
</p>
<p>designed this room."
</p>
<p>Now, whether Moll took this to be a reflection on her
</p>
<p>own figure, which had grown marvellous slim in the waist
</p>
<p>since she had her new stays from London, or not, I will
</p>
<p>not say; but certainly this response did exasperate her be-
</p>
<p>yond all endurance (as we could see by her blanched cheek
</p>
<p>and flashing eye); so, dismissing him with a deep curtsey,
</p>
<p>she turns on her heel without another word.
</p>
<p>This foolish business, which was not very creditable to
</p>
<p>our Moll's good sense (though I think she acted no worse
</p>
<p>than other maids in her condition, for I have observed
</p>
<p>that young people do usually lose their heads at the same
</p>
<p>time that they lose their hearts), this foolish scene, I say,
</p>
<p>I would gladly omit from my history, but that it completely
</p>
<p>changed our destiny; for had these two parted with fair
</p>
<p>words, we should probably have seen no more of Dario, and
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez's prognostic had been realised. Such trifles
</p>
<p>as these do influence our career as greatly as more serious
</p>
<p>accidents, our lives being a fabric of events that hang
</p>
<p>together by the slenderest threads.
</p>
<p>Unmoved from his design by Moll's displeasure, Dario
</p>
<p>replaced his scaffold before he left that day, and the next
</p>
<p>morning he came to put the last touch upon his work.
</p>
<p>Moll, being still in dudgeon, would not go near him, but
</p>
<p>sat brooding in a corner of her state room, ready, as I
</p>
<p>perceived, to fly out in passion at any one who gave her the
</p>
<p>occasion. Perceiving this, Don Sanchez prudently went
</p>
<p>forth for a walk after dinner; but I, seeing that some one
</p>
<p>must settle accounts with the painter for his work, stayed
</p>
<p>at home. And when I observed that he was collecting his

</p>
<p>"My dear," says I, "I believe Dario is preparing to
</p>
<p>leave us."
</p>
<p>"My congratulations to him," says she, "for 'tis evident
</p>
<p>he is weary of being here."
</p>
<p>"Nay, won't you come in and see his work now 'tis fin-

<p>"No; I have no desire to see it. If I have lost my taste
</p>
<p>for Italian art, 'tis through no fault of his."
</p>
<p>"You will see him, surely, before he goes."
</p>
<p>"No; I will not give him another opportunity to presume
</p>
<p>upon my kindness."
</p>
<p>"Why, to be sure," says I, like a fool, "you have been
</p>
<p>a little over- familiar."
</p>
<p>"Indeed," says she, firing up like a cracker. "Then I
</p>
<p>think 'twould have been kinder of you to give me a hint of
</p>
<p>it beforehand. However, 'tis a very good excuse for treat-
</p>
<p>ing him otherwise now."
</p>
<p>"Well, he must be paid for his work, at any rate."
</p>
<p>" Assuredly. If you have not money enough, I will fetch
</p>
<p>it from my closet."
</p>
<p>" I have it ready, and here is a purse for the purpose.
</p>
<p>The question is, how much to put in it. I should think
</p>
<p>such a perspective as that could not be handsomely paid
</p>
<p>under fifty guineas."
</p>
<p>" Then you will give him a hundred, and say that I am
</p>
<p>exceedingly obliged to him."
</p>
<p>I put this sum in the purse and went out into the hall
</p>
<p>where Dario was waiting, with his basket of brushes beside
</p>
<p>him. In a poor, bungling, stammering fashion, I deliv-
</p>
<p>ered Moll's message, and made the best excuse I could for

</p>
<p>He waited a moment or two after I had spoken, and
</p>
<p>then, says he, in a low voice :
</p>
<p>"Is that all?"
</p>
<p>"Nay," says I, offering the purse, "we do beg you to
</p>
<p>take this as "
</p>
<p>He stopped me, pushing my hand aside.
</p>
<p>"I have taken a purse from Don Sanchez," says he.
</p>
<p>"There was more in it than I needed there are still
</p>
<p>some pieces left. But as I would not affront him by offer-
</p>
<p>ing to return them, so I beg you will equally respect my
</p>
<p>feelings. I undertook the task in gratitude, and it hath
</p>
<p>been a work of love all through, well paid for by the hap-
</p>
<p>piness that I have found here."
</p>
<p>He stood musing a little while, as if he were debating
</p>
<p>with himself whether he should seek to overcome Moll's
</p>
<p>resentment or not. Then, raising his head quickly, he says :
</p>
<p>" 'Tis best so, maybe. Farewell, sir " (giving me his
</p>
<p>hand). "Tell her," adds he, as we stand hand in hand at
</p>
<p>the door, " that I can never forget her kindness, and will
</p>
<p>ever pray for her happiness."
</p>
<p>I found the door ajar and Moll pacing the room very
</p>
<p>white, when I returned. She checked me the moment I
</p>
<p>essayed to deliver Dario's message.
</p>
<p>"You can save your breath," says she, passionately.
</p>
<p>"I've heard every word."
</p>
<p>"More shame for you," says I, in a passion, casting my
</p>
<p>purse on the table. " 'Tis infamous to treat an honest gen-
</p>
<p>tleman thus, and silly besides. Come, dear," altering my
</p>
<p>tone, "do let me run and fetch him back."
</p>

</p>
<p>MOLL'S PRIDE OVERCOME. i/9
</p>
<p>I saw 'twas impossible to move her whilst she was in this
</p>
<p>mood, for she had something of her father's obstinate,
</p>
<p>stubborn disposition, and did yet hope to bring Dario back
</p>
<p>to her feet, like a spaniel, by harsh treatment. But he
</p>
<p>came no more, though a palette he had overlooked could
</p>
<p>have given him the excuse, and for very vexation with Moll
</p>
<p>I was glad he did not.
</p>
<p>He had not removed the scaffold, but when I went upon
</p>
<p>it to see what else he had put into his painting, the fading
</p>
<p>light only allowed me to make out a figure that seemed to
</p>
<p>be leaning over the balcony.
</p>
<p>Moll would not go in there, though I warrant she was
</p>
<p>dying of curiosity; and soon after supper, which she could
</p>
<p>scarce force herself to touch, she went up to her own cham-
</p>
<p>ber, wishing us a very distant, formal good-night, and
</p>
<p>keeping her passionate, angry countenance.
</p>
<p>But the next morning, ere I was dressed, she knocked at
</p>
<p>my door, and, opening it, I found her with swollen eyes
</p>
<p>and tears running down her cheeks.
</p>
<p>" Come down," says she, betwixt her sobs, and catching
</p>
<p>my hand in hers. " Come down and see."
</p>
<p>So we went downstairs together, I wondering what now
</p>
<p>had happened, and so into the dining-hall. And there I
</p>
<p>found the scaffold pushed aside, and the ceiling open to
</p>
<p>view. Then looking up, I perceived that the figure bending
</p>
<p>over the balcony bore Moll's own face, with a most sweet,
</p>
<p>compassionate expression in it as she looked down, such as
</p>
<p>I had observed when she bent over Dario, having brought
</p>
<p>him back to life. And this, thinks I, remembering his
</p>
<p>words, this is what he must ever see when he looks heaven-

<p>CHAPTER XXI.
</p>
<p>Of the strange things told us by the wise woman.
</p>
<p>" TELL me I am wicked ; tell me I'm a fool," says Moll,
</p>
<p>clinging to my arm.
</p>
<p>But I had no feeling now but pity and forgiveness, and so
</p>
<p>could only try to comfort her, saying we would make amends
</p>
<p>to Dario when we saw him next.
</p>
<p>" I will go to him," says she. " For nought in the world
</p>
<p>would I have him yield to such a heartless fool as I am. I
</p>
<p>know where he lodges."
</p>
<p>" Well, when we have eaten "
</p>
<p>" Nay ; we must go this moment. I cannot be at peace
</p>
<p>till I have asked him to forgive. Come with me, or I must
</p>
<p>go alone."
</p>
<p>Yielding to her desire without further ado, I fetched my
</p>
<p>hat and cloak, and, she doing likewise, we sallied out forth-
</p>
<p>with. Taking the side path by which Dario came and went
</p>
<p>habitually, we reached a little wicket gate, opening from the
</p>
<p>path upon the highway ; and here, seeing a man mending
</p>
<p>the road, we asked him where we should find Anne Fitch,
</p>
<p>as she was called, with whom the painter lodged. Pointing
</p>
<p>to a neat cottage that stood by the wayside, within a stone's
</p>
<p>throw, he told us the "wise woman " lived there. We crossed
</p>
<p>over and knocked at the door, and a voice within bidding
</p>
<p>us come in, we did so.
</p>
<p>There was a very sweet, pleasant smell in the room from

<p>ANNE FITCH, A WISE WOMAN. l8l
</p>
<p>the herbs that hung in little parcels from the beams, for this
</p>
<p>Anne Fitch was greatly skilled in the use of simples, and
</p>
<p>had no equal for curing fevers and the like in all the coun-
</p>
<p>try round. (But, besides this, it was said she could look
</p>
<p>into the future and forecast events truer than any Egyp-
</p>
<p>tian.) There was a chair by the table, on which was an
</p>
<p>empty bowl and some broken bread ; but the wise woman
</p>
<p>sat in the chimney corner, bending over the hearth, though
</p>
<p>the fire had burnt out, and not an ember glowed. And a
</p>
<p>strange little elf she looked, being very wizen and small, with
</p>
<p>one shoulder higher than the other, and a face full of pain.
</p>
<p>When I told her our business, for Moll was too greatly
</p>
<p>moved to speak, the old woman pointed to the adjoining
</p>
<p>room.
</p>
<p>" He is gone ! " cries Moll, going to the open door, and
</p>
<p>peering within.
</p>
<p>" Yes," answers Anne Fitch. " Alas ! "
</p>
<p>"When did he go?" asks Moll.
</p>
<p>" An hour since," answers the other.
</p>
<p>"Whither is he gone?"
</p>
<p>" I am no witch."
</p>
<p>" At least, you know which way he went."
</p>
<p>" I have not stirred from here since I gave him his last
</p>
<p>meal."
</p>
<p>Moll sank into the empty chair, and bowed her head in
</p>
<p>silence.
</p>
<p>Anne Fitch, whose keen eyes had never strayed from
</p>
<p>Moll since she first entered the room, seeming as if they
</p>
<p>would penetrate to the most secret recesses of her heart,
</p>
<p>with that shrewd perception which is common to many

</p>
<p>ment of their other faculties, rises from her settle in the
</p>
<p>chimney, and coming to the table, beside Moll, says :
</p>
<p>" I am no witch, I say ; yet I could tell you things would
</p>
<p>make you think I am."
</p>
<p>" I want to know nothing further," answers she, dolefully,
</p>
<p>" save where he is."
</p>
<p>"Would you not know whether you shall ever see him
</p>
<p>again, or not ? "
</p>
<p>" Oh ! If you can tell me that ! " cries Moll, quickly.
</p>
<p>" I may." Then, turning to me, the wise woman asks to
</p>
<p>look at my hand, and on my demurring, she says she must
</p>
<p>know whether I am a friend or an enemy, ere she speaks
</p>
<p>before me. So, on that, I give my hand, and she ex-
</p>
<p>amines it.
</p>
<p>"You call yourself James Hopkins," says she.
</p>
<p>" Why, every one within a mile knows that," says I.
</p>
<p>"Aye," answers she, fixing her piercing eye on my face;
</p>
<p>" but every one knows not that some call you Kit."
</p>
<p>This fairly staggered me for a moment.
</p>
<p>" How do you answer that? " she asks, observing my con-
</p>
<p>fusion.
</p>
<p>"Why," says I, recovering my presence of mind, "'tis
</p>
<p>most extraordinary, to be sure, that you should read this, for
</p>
<p>save one or two familiars, none know that my second name
</p>
<p>is Christopher."
</p>
<p>" A fairly honest hand," says she, looking at my hand
</p>
<p>again. " Weak in some things, but a faithful friend. You
</p>
<p>may be trusted."
</p>
<p>And so she drops my hand and takes up Moll's.
</p>
<p>" 'Tis strange," says she. " You call yourself Judith, yet

</p>
<p>here I see your name writ Moll."
</p>
<p>THE WISE WOMAN DO SET US A QUESTIONING. 183
</p>
<p>Poor Moll, sick with a night of sorrow and terrified by the
</p>
<p>wise woman's divining powers, could make no answer ; but
</p>
<p>soon Fitch, taking less heed of her tremble than of mine, re-
</p>
<p>gards her hand again.
</p>
<p>" How were you called in Barbary ? " asks she.
</p>
<p>This question betraying a flaw in the wise woman's per-
</p>
<p>ception, gave Moll courage, and she answered readily
</p>
<p>enough that she was called " Lala Mollah " which was
</p>
<p>true, " Lala " being the Moorish for lady, and " Mollah " the
</p>
<p>name her friends in Elche had called her as being more
</p>
<p>agreeable to their ear than the shorter English name.
</p>
<p>"Mollah Moll!" says Anne Fitch, as if communing
</p>
<p>with herself. "That may well be." Then, following a line
</p>
<p>in Moll's hand, she adds, " You will love but once, child."
</p>
<p>" What is my sweetheart's name ? " whispers Moll, the
</p>
<p>colour springing in her face.
</p>
<p>" You have not heard it yet," replies the other, upon which
</p>
<p>Moll pulls her hand away impatiently. " But you have seen
</p>
<p>him," continues the wise woman, " and his is the third hand
</p>
<p>in which I have read another name."
</p>
<p>"Tell me now if I shall see him again," cries Moll,
</p>
<p>eagerly offering her hand again, and as quickly as she
</p>
<p>had before withdrawn it.
</p>
<p>" That depends upon yourself," returns the other. " The
</p>
<p>line is a deep one. Would you give him all you have ? "
</p>
<p>Moll bends her head low in silence, to conceal her hot
</p>
<p>face.
</p>
<p>" 'Tis nothing to be ashamed of," says the old woman, in
</p>
<p>a strangely gentle tone. " 'Tis better to love once than often ;
</p>
<p>better to give your whole heart than part. Were I young and

</p>
<p>man. For he is good and generous and exceeding kind.
</p>
<p>Look you, he hath lived here but a few weeks, and I feel for
</p>
<p>him, grieve for him, like a mother. Oh, I am no witch,"
</p>
<p>adds she, wiping a tear from her cheek, " only a crooked old
</p>
<p>woman with the gift of seeing what is open to all who will
</p>
<p>read, and a heart that quickens still at a kind word or a
</p>
<p>gentle thought." (Moll's hand had closed upon hers at that
</p>
<p>first sight of her grief.) "For your names," continues she,
</p>
<p>recovering her composure, " I learnt from one of your maids
</p>
<p>who came hither for news of her sweetheart, that the sea
</p>
<p>captain who was with you did sometimes let them slip. I
</p>
<p>was paid to learn this."
</p>
<p>" Not by him," says Moll.
</p>
<p>" No ; by your steward Simon."
</p>
<p>" He paid for that ! " says I, incredulous, knowing Simon's
</p>
<p>reluctance to spend money.
</p>
<p>" Aye, and a good price, too. It seems you call heavily
</p>
<p>upon him for money, and do threaten to cut up your estate
</p>
<p>and sell the land he prizes as his life."
</p>
<p>"That is quite true," says I.
</p>
<p>" Moreover, he greatly fears that he will be cast from his
</p>
<p>office, when your title to it is made good. For that reason
</p>
<p>he would move heaven and earth to stay your succession by
</p>
<p>casting doubts upon your claim. And to this end he has
</p>
<p>by all the means at his command tried to provoke your
</p>
<p>cousin to contest your right."
</p>
<p>" My cousin ! " cries Moll.
</p>
<p>" Richard Godwin."
</p>
<p>"My cousin Richard why, where is he?"
</p>
<p>"Gone," says the old woman, pointing to the broken

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.
</p>
<p>How Moll and Mr. Godwin come together and declare their hearts*
</p>
<p>passion, and how I carry these tidings to Dawson.
</p>
<p>"WHAT!" cries Moll, starting to her feet. " He whom
</p>
<p>I have treated thus is " and here she checked herself, as
</p>
<p>if recoiling (and for the first time) from false pretence in
</p>
<p>a matter so near her heart.
</p>
<p>" He is your cousin, Richard Godwin," says the wise
</p>
<p>woman. "Simon knew this from the first; for there were
</p>
<p>letters showing it in the pocket-book he found after the
</p>
<p>struggle in the park ; but for his own ends he kept that
</p>
<p>knowledge secret, until it fitted his ends to speak. Why
</p>
<p>your cousin did not reveal himself to you may be more
</p>
<p>readily conceived by you than 'twas by me."
</p>
<p>" Why, 'tis clear enough," says Moll. " Pressed by his
</p>
<p>necessities, he came hither to claim assistance of his kins-
</p>
<p>man ; but finding he was dead and none here but me, his
</p>
<p>pride did shrink from begging of a mere maid that which he
</p>
<p>might with justice have demanded from a man. And then,
</p>
<p>for shame at being handled like a rogue "
</p>
<p>Surely there is something in the blood of a gentleman
</p>
<p>that tempers his spirit to a degree scarcely to be compre-
</p>
<p>hended by men of meaner birth, thinks I.
</p>
<p>" When did Simon urge him to dispute my rights ? " asks
</p>
<p>Moll.

<p>look he had some treacherous business in hand, and, match-
</p>
<p>ing my stealth with his, I found means to overhear him,
</p>
<p>creeping from thicket to thicket, as noiseless as a snake, to
</p>
<p>where they stood ; for, be assured, I should not otherwise
</p>
<p>have learnt one word of this."
</p>
<p>"How did he receive these hints at my ill doing?" asks
</p>
<p>Moll.
</p>
<p>" Patiently, till the tale was told ; then, taking your steward
</p>
<p>by the throat with sudden passion, he cries : ' Why should I
</p>
<p>not strangle you, rascal ? Twould be a service to humanity.
</p>
<p>What have I done to deserve your love, or this lady your
</p>
<p>hate ? Nothing. You would pit us one against the other
</p>
<p>merely to keep your hold upon these lands, and gratify your
</p>
<p>insensate love of possession. Go, get you gone, beast ! '
</p>
<p>cries he, flinging him off; ' 'tis punishment enough for you
</p>
<p>to live and know you've failed. For, had you proved your
</p>
<p>case to my conviction, I'd not stir a hand against this lady,
</p>
<p>be she who she may. Nay,' adds he, with greater fury, ' I
</p>
<p>will not stay where my loyalty and better judgment may be
</p>
<p>affected by the contagion of a vile suspicion. Away while
</p>
<p>you may ; my fingers itch to be revenged on you for sunder-
</p>
<p>ing me from one who should have been my closest, dearest
</p>
<p>friend.' "
</p>
<p>Moll claps her hands together with a cry of joy and pain
</p>
<p>mingled, even as the smile played upon her lips whilst tears
</p>
<p>filled her eyes.
</p>

</p>
<p>SET OUT IN PURSUIT OF MR. GODWIN. l/
</p>
<p>"That mayjbe done if you take horse," says Anne Fitch,
</p>
<p>" for he travels afoot."
</p>
<p>" But which way shall we turn ? "
</p>
<p>"The way that any man would take, seeking to dispel
</p>
<p>a useless sorrow," answers the wise woman; "the way to
</p>
<p>London."
</p>
<p>"God bless you !" cries Moll, clasping the withered old
</p>
<p>woman to her heaving breast and kissing her. Then the
</p>
<p>next moment she would be gone, bidding me get horses for
</p>
<p>our pursuit.
</p>
<p>So, as quickly as I might, I procured a couple of nags,
</p>
<p>and we set out, leaving a message for Don Sanchez, who was
</p>
<p>not yet astir. And we should have gone empty, but that
</p>
<p>while the horses were a-preparing (and Moll, despite her
</p>
<p>mighty haste at this business too), I took the precaution to
</p>
<p>put some store of victuals in a saddle bag.
</p>
<p>Reckoning that Mr. Godwin (as I must henceforth call
</p>
<p>him) had been set out two hours or thereabouts, I considered
</p>
<p>that we might overtake him in about three at an easy amble.
</p>
<p>But Moll was in no mood for ambling, and no sooner were
</p>
<p>we started than she put her nag to a gallop and kept up this
</p>
<p>reckless pace up hill and down dale, I trailing behind and
</p>
<p>expecting every minute to be cast and get my neck broke,
</p>
<p>until her horse was spent and would answer no more to
</p>
<p>the whip. Then I begged her for mercy's sake to take the
</p>
<p>hill we were coming to at a walk, and break her fast.
</p>
<p>"For," says I, "another such half-hour as the last on an
</p>
<p>empty stomach will do my business, and you will have
</p>
<p>another dead man to bring back to life, which will advance
</p>
<p>your journey nothing, and so more haste, less speed."

<p>we ate a rare good meal and very merry, and indeed it was
</p>
<p>a pleasure now to look at her as great as the pain had been
</p>
<p>to see her so unhappy a few hours before. For the exercise
</p>
<p>had brought a flood of rich colour into her face, and a lively
</p>
<p>hope sparkled in her eyes, and the sound of her voice was
</p>
<p>like any peal of marriage bells for gaiety. Yet now and
</p>
<p>then her tongue would falter, and she would strain a- wistful
</p>
<p>glance along the road before us as fearing she did hope too
</p>
<p>much. However, coming to an inn, we made enquiry, and
</p>
<p>learnt that a man such as we described had surely passed
</p>
<p>the house barely an hour gone, and one adding that he
</p>
<p>carried a basket on his stick, we felt this must be our painter
</p>
<p>for certain.
</p>
<p>Thence on again at another tear (as if we were flying
</p>
<p>from our reckoning) until, turning a bend of the road at the
</p>
<p>foot of a hill, she suddenly drew rein with a shrill cry. And
</p>
<p>coming up, I perceived close by our side Mr. Godwin,
</p>
<p>seated upon the bridge that crossed a stream, with his
</p>
<p>wallet beside him.
</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet and caught in an instant the rein
</p>
<p>that had fallen from Moll's hand, for the commotion in her
</p>
<p>heart at seeing him so suddenly had stopped the current of
</p>
<p>her veins, and she was deadly pale.
</p>
<p>" Take me, take me ! " cries she, stretching forth her arms,
</p>
<p>with a faint voice. "Take me, or I must fall," and slipping
</p>
<p>from her saddle she sank into his open, ready arms.
</p>
<p>" Help ! " says Mr. Godwin, quickly, and in terror.
</p>
<p>"Nay," says she; "I am better 'tis nothing. But,"
</p>
<p>adds she, smiling at him, " you may hold me yet a little
</p>
<p>longer."

</p>
<p>The fervid look in his eyes, as he gazed down at her sweet
</p>
<p>PRETTY SPEECHES. 189
</p>
<p>pale face, seemed to say : " Would I could hold you here
</p>
<p>for ever, sweetheart."
</p>
<p>" Rest her here," says I, pointing to the little wall of the
</p>
<p>bridge, and he, complying (not too willingly), withdrew his
</p>
<p>arm from her waist, with a sigh.
</p>
<p>And now the colour coming back to her cheek, Moll
</p>
<p>turns to him, and says :
</p>
<p>" I thought you would have come again. And since one
</p>
<p>of us must ask to be forgiven, lo ! here am I come to ask
</p>
<p>your pardon."
</p>
<p>"Why, what is there to pardon, Madam? " says he.
</p>
<p>" Only a girl's folly, which unforgiven must seem some-
</p>
<p>thing worse."
</p>
<p>"Your utmost folly," says he, " is to have been over-kind
</p>
<p>to a poor painter. And if that be an offence, 'tis my mis-
</p>
<p>fortune to be no more offended."
</p>
<p>"Have I been over-kind?" says Moll, abashed, as hav-
</p>
<p>ing unwittingly passed the bounds of maiden modesty.
</p>
<p>" As nature will be over-bounteous in one season, strewing
</p>
<p>so many flowers in our path that we do underprize them till
</p>
<p>they are lost, and all the world seems stricken with wintry
</p>
<p>desolation."
</p>
<p>" Yet, if I have said or done anything unbecoming to my
</p>
<p>sex "
</p>
<p>" Nothing womanly is unbecoming to a woman," returns
</p>
<p>he. "And, praised be God, some still live who have not
</p>
<p>learned to conceal their nature under a mask of fashion. If
</p>
<p>this be due less to your natural free disposition than to an
</p>
<p>ignorance of our enlightened modish arts, then could I find
</p>
<p>it in my heart to rejoice that you have lived a captive in

<p>Barbary."
</p>
<p>A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>They had been looking into each other's eyes with the
</p>
<p>delight of reading there the love that filled their hearts, but
</p>
<p>now Moll bent her head as if she could no longer bear that
</p>
<p>searching regard, and unable to make response to his pretty
</p>
<p>speech, sat twining her fingers in her lap, silent, with pain
</p>
<p>and pleasure fluttering over her downcast face. And at this
</p>
<p>time I do think she was as near as may be on the -point of
</p>
<p>confessing she had been no Barbary slave, rather than
</p>
<p>deceive the man who loved her, and profit by his faith in
</p>
<p>her, which had certainly undone us all ; but in her passion,
</p>
<p>a woman considered the welfare of her father and best
</p>
<p>friends very lightly ; nay, she will not value her own body
</p>
<p>and soul at two straws, but is ready to yield up everything
</p>
<p>for one dear smile.
</p>
<p>A full minute Mr. Godwin sat gazing at Moll's pretty,
</p>
<p>blushing, half-hid face (as if for his last solace), and then,
</p>
<p>rising slowly from the little parapet, he says :
</p>
<p>" Had I been more generous, I should have spared you
</p>
<p>this long morning ride. So you have something to forgive,
</p>
<p>and we may cry quits ! " Then, stretching forth his hand,
</p>
<p>he adds, " Farewell."
</p>
<p>" Stay," cries Moll, springing to her feet, as fearing to lose
</p>
<p>him suddenly again, " I have not eased myself of the burden
</p>
<p>that lay uppermost. Oh ! " cries she, passionately, casting
</p>
<p>off all reserve, " I know all ; who you are, and why you first
</p>
<p>came hither, and I am here to offer you the half of all I have."
</p>
<p>"Half, sweet cousin?" answers he, taking her two hands
</p>
<p>in his.
</p>
<p>" Aye ; for if I had not come to claim it, all would have
</p>
<p>been yours by right. And 'tis no more than fair that, owing

</p>
<p>so much to Fortune, I should offer you the half."
</p>
<p>TWO HEARTS DO MELT IN ONE. IQI
</p>
<p>"Suppose that half will not suffice me, dear?" says he.
</p>
<p>" Why, then I'll give you all," answers she ; " houses,
</p>
<p>gardens, everything."
</p>
<p>" Then what will you do, coz? "
</p>
<p>"Go hence, as you were going but just now," answers she,
</p>
<p>trembling.
</p>
<p>" Why, that's as if you took the diamond from its setting,
</p>
<p>and left me nothing but the foil," says he. " Oh, I would
</p>
<p>order it another way : give me the gem, and let who 'will
</p>
<p>take what remains. Unless these little hands are mine to
</p>
<p>hold for ever, I will take nothing from them."
</p>
<p>"They are thine, dear love," cries she, in a transport,
</p>
<p>flinging them about his neck, " and my heart as well."
</p>
<p>At this conjuncture I thought it advisable to steal softly
</p>
<p>away to the bend of the road ; for surely any one coming
</p>
<p>this way by accident, and finding them locked together
</p>
<p>thus in tender embrace on the king's highway, would have
</p>
<p>fallen to some gross conclusion, not understanding their
</p>
<p>circumstances, and so might have offended their delicacy
</p>
<p>by some rude jest. And I had not parted myself here a
</p>
<p>couple of minutes, ere I spied a team of four stout horses
</p>
<p>coming over the brow of the hill, drawing the stage waggon
</p>
<p>behind them which plies betwixt Sevenoaks and London.
</p>
<p>This prompting me to a happy notion, I returned to the
</p>
<p>happy, smiling pair, who were now seated again upon the
</p>
<p>bridge, hand in hand, and says I :
</p>
<p>"My dear friends, for so I think I may now count
</p>
<p>you, sir, as well as my Mistress Judith here, the waggon is
</p>
<p>coming down the hill, by which I had intended to go to
</p>
<p>London this morning upon some pressing business. And

<p>so, Madam, if your cousin will take my horse and conduct
</p>
<p>IQ2 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>you back to the Court, I will profit by this occasion and bid
</p>
<p>you farewell for the present."
</p>
<p>This proposal was received with evident satisfaction on
</p>
<p>their part, for there was clearly no further thought of part-
</p>
<p>ing ; only Moll, alarmed for the proprieties, did beg her
</p>
<p>lover to lift her on her horse instantly. Nevertheless, when
</p>
<p>she was in her saddle, they must linger yet, he to. kiss her
</p>
<p>hands, and she to bend down and yield her cheek to his lips,
</p>
<p>though the sound of the coming waggon was close at hand.
</p>
<p>Scarcely less delighted than they with this surprising
</p>
<p>strange turn of events, I left 'em there with bright, smiling
</p>
<p>faces, and journeyed on to London, and there taking a pair of
</p>
<p>oars at the Bridge to Greenwich, all eagerness to give these
</p>
<p>joyful tidings to my old friend, Jack Dawson. I found him
</p>
<p>in his workroom, before a lathe, and sprinkled from head
</p>
<p>to toe with chips, mighty proud of a bed-post he was a-turn-
</p>
<p>ing. And it did my heart good to see him looking stout
</p>
<p>and hearty, profitably occupied in this business, instead of
</p>
<p>soaking in an alehouse (as I feared at one time he would)
</p>
<p>to dull his care ; but he was ever a stout, brave fellow, who
</p>
<p>would rather fight than give in any day. A better man
</p>
<p>never lived, nor a more honest circumstances permitting.
</p>
<p>His joy at seeing me was past everything ; but his first
</p>
<p>thought after our hearty greeting was of his daughter.
</p>
<p>" My Moll," says he, " my dear girl ; you han't brought
</p>
<p>her to add to my joy? She's not slinking behind a door to
</p>
<p>fright me with delight, hey?"
</p>
<p>" No," says I ; "but I've brought you great news of her."
</p>
<p>"And good, I'll swear, Kit, for there's not a sad line in
</p>
<p>your face. Stay, comrade, wait till I've shook these chips

<p>off and we are seated in my parlour, for I do love to have a

<p>pipe of tobacco and a mug of ale beside me in times of
</p>
<p>pleasure. You can talk of indifferent things, though, for
</p>
<p>Lord ! I do love to hear the sound of your voice again."
</p>
<p>I told him how the ceiling of our dining-hall had been
</p>
<p>painted.
</p>
<p>" Aye," says he. " I have heard of that ; for my dear
</p>
<p>girl hath writ about that and nought else in her letters ;
</p>
<p>and though I've no great fancy for such matters, yet I doubt
</p>
<p>not it is mighty fine by her long-winded praises of it. Come,
</p>
<p>Kit, let us in here and get to something fresher."
</p>
<p>So we into his parlour, which was a neat, cheerful
</p>
<p>room, with a fine view of the river, and there being duly
</p>
<p>furnished with a mighty mug of ale and clean pipes, he bids
</p>
<p>me give him my news, and I tell him how Moll had fallen
</p>
<p>over head and ears in love with the painter, and he with her,
</p>
<p>and how that very morning they had come together and
</p>
<p>laid open their hearts' desire one to the other, with the
</p>
<p>result (as I believed) that they would be married as soon
</p>
<p>as they could get a parson to do their business.
</p>
<p>" This is brave news indeed," cries he, " and easeth me
</p>
<p>beyond comprehension, for I could see clearly enough she
</p>
<p>was smitten with this painter, by her writing of nothing else ;
</p>
<p>and seeing she could not get at his true name and condi-
</p>
<p>tion, I felt some qualms as to how the matter might end.
</p>
<p>But do tell me, Kit, is he an honest, wholesome sort of
</p>
<p>man?"
</p>
<p>" As honest as the day," says I, " and a nobler, handsomer
</p>
<p>man never breathed."
</p>
<p>" God be praised for all things," says he, devoutly. " Tell
</p>
<p>me he's an Englishman, Kit as Moll did seem to think he
</p>
<p>was, spite his foreign name and my joy's complete."

</p>
<p>"As true-born an Englishman as you are," says I.
</p>
<p>" Lord love him for it ! " cries he.
</p>
<p>Then coming down to particulars, I related the events of
</p>
<p>the past few days pretty much as I have writ them here,
</p>
<p>showing in the end how Mr. Godwin would have gone away,
</p>
<p>unknown rather than profit by his claim as Sir Richard God-
</p>
<p>win's kinsman, even though Moll should be no better than
</p>
<p>old Simon would have him believe, upon which he cries,
</p>
<p>" Lord love him for it, say I again ! Let us drink to their
</p>
<p>health. Drink deep, Kit, for I've a fancy that no man shall
</p>
<p>put his lips to this mug after us."
</p>
<p>So I drank heartily, and he, emptying the jug, flung it
</p>
<p>behind the chimney, with another fervent ejaculation of
</p>
<p>gratitude. Then a shade of sorrow falling on his face as he
</p>
<p>lay it in his hand, his elbow resting on the table :
</p>
<p>" I'd give best half of the years I've got to live," says he,
</p>
<p>"to see 'em together, and grasp Mr. Godwin's hand in mine.
</p>
<p>But I'll not be tempted to it, for I perceive clearly enough
</p>
<p>by what you tell me that my wayward tongue and weakness
</p>
<p>have been undoing us all, and ruining my dear Moll's chance
</p>
<p>of happiness. But tell me, Kit " (straightening himself up),
</p>
<p>" how think you this marriage will touch our affairs ? "
</p>
<p>" Only to better them. For henceforth our prosperity is
</p>
<p>assured, which otherwise might have lacked security."
</p>
<p>" Aye, to be sure, for now shall we be all in one family
</p>
<p>with these Godwins, and this cousin, profiting by the estate
</p>
<p>as much as Moll, will never begrudge her giving us a hun-
</p>

<p>" But something your word must mean. Come, out with
</p>
<p>it, Kit."
</p>
<p>" Well," says I, " since this fondness has possessed her, I
</p>
<p>have observed a greater compunction to telling of lies than
</p>
<p>she was wont to have."
</p>
<p>" Tis my fault," answers he, sadly. " She gets this lean-
</p>
<p>ing to honesty from me."
</p>
<p>"This very morning," continues I, "she was, I truly
</p>
<p>believe, of two minds whether she should not confess to her
</p>
<p>sweetheart that she was not his cousin."
</p>
<p>" For all the world my case ! " cries he, slapping the
</p>
<p>table. " If I could only have five minutes in secret with
</p>
<p>the dear girl, I would give her a hint that should make her
</p>
<p>profit by my folly." And then he tells me how, in the hey-
</p>
<p>day of courtship and the flush of confiding love, he did con-
</p>
<p>fess to his wife that he had carried gallantry somewhat too
</p>
<p>far with Sukey Taylor, and might have added a good half
</p>
<p>dozen other names beside hers but for her sudden outcry ;
</p>
<p>and how, though she might very well have suspected other
</p>
<p>amours, she did never reproach him therewith, but was for
</p>
<p>ever to her dying day a-flinging Sukey Taylor in his teeth,

</p>
<p>"Not secretly," says I. "But there is no reason why
</p>
<p>you should not visit her openly. Nay, it will create less
</p>
<p>surprise than if you stay away. For what could be more
</p>
<p>natural than your coming to the Court on your return from
</p>
<p>a voyage to see the lady you risked so much to save?"
</p>
<p>" Now God bless you for a good, true friend ! " cries he,

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez proposes a very artful way to make Mr, Godwin a party
</p>
<p>to our knavery, etc.
</p>
<p>I RETURNED to Hurst Court the following day in the
</p>
<p>forenoon, and there I found Mr. Godwin, with Moll cling-
</p>
<p>ing to his arm, in an upper room commanding a view of
</p>
<p>the northern slopes, discussing their future, and Moll told
</p>
<p>me with glee how this room was to be her husband's work-
</p>
<p>room, where he would paint pictures for the admiration of
</p>
<p>all the world, saying that he would not (nor would she have
</p>
<p>him) renounce his calling to lead the idle life of a country
</p>
<p>gentleman.
</p>
<p>" If the world admire my pictures, the world shall pay
</p>
<p>to have them," says he, with a smile; then turning to her he
</p>
<p>adds very tenderly : " I will owe all my happiness to you,
</p>
<p>sweetheart; yet guard my independence in more material
</p>
<p>matters. No mercenary question shall ever cast suspicion
</p>
<p>on my love."
</p>
<p>Seeing I was not wanted here, I left them to settle their
</p>
<p>prospectives, and sought Don Sanchez, whom I found
</p>
<p>reading in a room below, seated in a comfortable chair
</p>
<p>before a good fire of apple logs. To please me, he shut up
</p>
<p>his book and agreed to take a stroll in the park while
</p>
<p>dinner was a-dressing. So we clap on our hats and cloaks
</p>
<p>and set forth, talking of indifferent matters till we are

<p>dent Don did ever prefer to holes and corners for secret
</p>
<p>conference), and then he told me how Moll and Mr. Godwin
</p>
<p>had already decided they would be married in three weeks.
</p>
<p>"Three weeks? " says I. " I would it were to be done in
</p>
<p>three days." To which desire the Don coincides with
</p>
<p>sundry grave nods, and then tells me how Moll would have
</p>
<p>herself cried in church, for all to know, and that nothing
</p>
<p>may be wanting to her husband's dignity.
</p>
<p>"After all," says I, "three weeks is no such great matter.
</p>
<p>And now, Senor, do tell me what you think of all this."
</p>
<p>" If you had had the ordering of your own destiny, you
</p>
<p>could not have contrived it better, " answers he. " 'Tis a most
</p>
<p>excellent game, and you cannot fail to win if " (here he
</p>
<p>pauses to blow his nose) " if the cards are played properly."
</p>
<p>This somehow brought Dawson into my thoughts, and I
</p>
<p>told the Don of my visit to him, and how he did purpose
</p>
<p>to come down to see Moll ; whereat the Don, stopping
</p>
<p>short, looked at me very curiously with his eyebrows
</p>
<p>raised, but saying nothing.
</p>
<p>" 'Tis no more than natural that a father should want to
</p>
<p>see what kind of man is to be his daughter's husband,"
</p>
<p>says I, in excuse, " and if he w/7/come, what are we to do? "
</p>
<p>" I know what I should do in your place, Mr. Hopkins,"
</p>
<p>says he, quietly.
</p>
<p>"Pray, Senor, what is that?"

<p>we three men were seated before the fire, I asked Mr. God-
</p>
<p>SERIOUS DISCOURSE WITH MR. GODWIN.
</p>
<p>win if he would permit me to speak upon a matter which
</p>
<p>concerned his happiness no less than his cousin Judith's.
</p>
<p>"Nay, sir," replies he, "I do pray you to be open with
</p>
<p>me, for otherwise I must consider myself unworthy of your
</p>
<p>friendship."
</p>
<p>"Well, sir," says I, "my mind is somewhat concerned
</p>
<p>on account of what you said this morning; namely, that no
</p>
<p>pecuniary question shall ever be discussed betwixt you and
</p>
<p>your wife, and that you will owe nothing to her but happi-
</p>
<p>ness. This, together with your purpose of painting pic-
</p>
<p>tures to sell, means, I take it, that you will leave your wife
</p>
<p>absolute mistress of her present fortune."
</p>
<p>"That is the case exactly, Mr. Hopkins," says he. "I
</p>
<p>am not indifferent to the world's esteem, and I would give
</p>
<p>no one reason to suspect that I had married my dear cousin
</p>
<p>to possess her fortune."
</p>
<p>" Nevertheless, sir, you would not have it thought that she
</p>
<p>begrudged you an equal share of her possessions. Your
</p>
<p>position will necessitate a certain outlay. To maintain
</p>
<p>your wife's dignity and your own, you must dress well,
</p>
<p>mount a good horse, be liberal in hospitality, give largely
</p>
<p>to those in need, and so forth. With all due respect to
</p>
<p>your genius in painting, I can scarcely think that art will
</p>
<p>furnish you at once with supplies necessary to meet all
</p>
<p>these demands."
</p>
<p>"All this is very true, Mr. Hopkins," says he, after a little
</p>
<p>reflection; "to tell the truth, I have lived so long in want
</p>
<p>that poverty has become my second nature, and so these
</p>
<p>matters have not entered into my calculations. Pray, sir,
</p>
<p>continue."

</p>
<p>anticipate your needs; and hence at some future moment
</p>
<p>this question of supplies must arise unless they are dis-
</p>
<p>posed of before your marriage."
</p>
<p>" If that could be done, Mr. Hopkins," says he, hopefully.
</p>
<p>"It may be done, sir, very easily. With your cousin's
</p>
<p>consent and yours, I, as her elected guardian, at this time
</p>
<p>will have a deed drawn up to be signed by you and her,
</p>
<p>settling one-half the estate upon you, and the other on your
</p>
<p>cousin. This will make you not her debtor, but her bene-
</p>
<p>factor; for without this deed, all that is now hers becomes
</p>
<p>yours by legal right upon your marriage, and she could not
</p>
<p>justly give away a shilling without your permission. And
</p>
<p>thus you assure to her the same independence that you
</p>
<p>yourself would maintain."
</p>
<p>"Very good," says Don Sanchez, in a sonorous voice of
</p>
<p>approval, as he lies back in his high chair, his eyes closed,
</p>
<p>and a cigarro in the corner of his mouth.
</p>
<p>"I thank you with all my heart, Mr. Hopkins," says Mr.
</p>
<p>Godwin, warmly. " I entreat you have this deed drawn up
</p>
<p>if it be my wife's wish."
</p>
<p>" You may count with certainty on that," says I ; " for if my
</p>
<p>arguments lacked power, I have but to say 'tis your desire,
</p>
<p>and 'twould be done though it took the last penny from her."
</p>
<p>He made no reply to this, but bending forward he gazed
</p>
<p>into the fire, with a rapture in his face, pressing one hand
</p>
<p>within the other as if it were his sweetheart's.
</p>
<p>"In the meantime," says I, "if you have necessity for a
</p>
<p>hundred or two in advance, you have but to give me your
</p>
<p>note of hand."
</p>
<p>"Can you do me this service?" cries he, eagerly.

</p>
<p>"I believe I can supply you to the extent of six or
</p>
<p>seven."
</p>
<p>"All that you can," says he; "for besides a pressing need
</p>
<p>that will take me to London to-morrow, I owe something
</p>
<p>to a friend here that I would fain discharge."
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez waived his hand cavalierly, though I do
</p>
<p>believe the subtle Spaniard had hinted at this business as
</p>
<p>much for his own ends as for our assurance.
</p>
<p>"I will have it ready against we meet in the morning,"
</p>
<p>says I.
</p>
<p>"You are so certain of her sanction?" he asks in de-
</p>
<p>light, as if he could not too much assure himself of Moll's
</p>
<p>devotion.
</p>
<p>"She has been guided by me in all matters relating to
</p>
<p>her estate, and will be in this, I am convinced. But here's
</p>
<p>another question, sir, which, while we are about business,
</p>
<p>might be discussed with advantage. My rule here is nearly
</p>
<p>at an end. Have you decided who shall govern the estate
</p>
<p>when I am gone? "
</p>
<p>" Only that when I have authority that rascal Simon shall
</p>
<p>be turned from his office, neck and crop. He loves me as

<p>little as he loves his mistress, that he would set us by the

<p>ears for his own advantage."
</p>
<p>"An honest man, nevertheless in his peculiar way,"
</p>
<p>observes the Don.
</p>
<p>"Honest!" cries Mr. Godwin, hotly. "He honest who
</p>
<p>would have suffered Judith to die in Barbary ! He shall go."

</p>
<p>"With all respect to your cousin's abilities, I cannot
</p>
<p>think her qualified for this office."
</p>
<p>"Surely another steward can be found."
</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly," says I. "But surely, sir, you'd not trust
</p>
<p>all to him without some supervision. Large sums of
</p>
<p>money must pass through his hands, and this must prove
</p>
<p>a great temptation to dishonest practices. 'Twould not
</p>
<p>be fair to any man."
</p>
<p>"This is true," says he. "And yet from natural disincli-
</p>
<p>nation, ignorance, and other reasons, I would keep out of
</p>
<p>it." Then after some reflection he adds, "My cousin has
</p>
<p>told me how you have lost all your fortune in saving her,
</p>
<p>and that 'tis not yet possible to repay you. May I ask,
</p>
<p>sir, without offence, if you have any occupation for your
</p>
<p>time when you leave us? "
</p>
<p>" I went to London when I left you to see what might be
</p>
<p>done; but a merchant without money is like a carpenter
</p>
<p>without tools."
</p>
<p>"Then, sir, till your debt is discharged, or you can find
</p>
<p>some more pleasant and profitable engagement, would you
</p>
<p>not consent to govern these affairs ? I do not ask you to
</p>
<p>stay here, though assuredly you will ever be a, welcome
</p>
<p>guest; but if you would have one of the houses on the
</p>
<p>estate or come hither from time to time as it might fit your
</p>
<p>other purposes, and take this office as a matter of business,
</p>
<p>I should regard it as a most generous, friendly kindness
</p>
<p>on your part."
</p>
<p>I promised him with some demur, and yet with the
</p>
<p>civility his offer demanded, to consider of this; and so
</p>
<p>our debate ended, and I went to bed, very well content with

</p>
<p>pounds more, and do otherwise play the part of rascal to perfection.
</p>
<p>I GOT together six hundred pounds (out of the sum left
</p>
<p>us after paying Don Sanchez his ten thousand), and deliv-
</p>
<p>ered 'em to Mr. Godwin against his note of hand, telling
</p>
<p>him at the same time that, having slept upon his proposal,
</p>
<p>I was resolved to be his steward for three months, with
</p>
<p>freedom on both sides to alter our position, according to
</p>
<p>our convenience, at the end of that time, and would serve
</p>
<p>him and his lady to the best of my power. Thanking me
</p>
<p>very heartily for my friendly service to him (though, God
</p>
<p>knows, with little reason), he presently left us. And Moll,
</p>
<p>coming back from taking tender leave of him at her gates,
</p>
<p>appeared very downcast and pensive. However, after
</p>
<p>moping an hour in her chamber, she comes to me in her
</p>
<p>hood, and begs I will take her a walk to dispel her va-
</p>
<p>pours. So we out across the common, it being a fine,
</p>
<p>brisk, dry morning and the ground hard with a frost.
</p>
<p>Here, being secure from observation, I showed her how I
</p>
<p>had settled matters with Mr. Godwin, dividing the estate in
</p>
<p>such a manner as would enable her to draw what funds she
</p>
<p>pleased, without let, hindrance, or any inconvenient question.
</p>
<p>At this she draws a deep sigh, fixing her eyes sadly
</p>
<p>enough on the perspective, as if she were thinking rather
</p>
<p>of her absent lover than the business in hand. Somewhat

<p>nettled to find she prized my efforts on her behalf so lightly,
</p>
<p>I proceeded to show her the advantages of this arrange-
</p>
<p>ment, adding that, to make her property the surer, I had
</p>
<p>consented to manage both her affairs and Mr. Godwin's
</p>
<p>when they were married.
</p>
<p>"And so," says I, in conclusion, "you may have what
</p>
<p>money you want, and dispose of it as you will, .and I'll
</p>
<p>answer for it Mr. Godwin shall never be a penny the wiser."
</p>
<p>"Do what you find is necessary," says she, with passion.
</p>
<p>"But for mercy's sake say no more on this matter to me.
</p>
<p>For all these hints do stab my heart like sharp knives."
</p>
<p>Not reading rightly the cause of her petulance, I was at
</p>
<p>first disposed to resent it; but, reflecting that a maiden is
</p>
<p>no more responsible for her tongue than a donkey for his
</p>
<p>heels in this season of life (but both must be for ever a-fly-
</p>
<p>ing out at some one when parted from the object of their
</p>
<p>affections), I held my peace; and so we walked on in sullen
</p>
<p>silence for a space; then, turning suddenly upon me, she
</p>
<p>cries in a trembling voice :
</p>
<p>"Won't you say something to me? Can't you see that I
</p>
<p>am unhappy? "
</p>
<p>And now, seeing her eyes full of tears, her lips quiver-
</p>
<p>ing, and her face drawn with pain, my heart melted in a
</p>
<p>moment; so, taking her arm under mine and pressing it to
</p>
<p>my side, I bade her be of good cheer, for her lover would
</p>
<p>return in a clay or two at the outside.
</p>
<p>"No, not of him, not of him," she entreats. "Talk
</p>
<p>to me of indifferent things."
</p>
<p>So, thinking to turn her thoughts to another furrow, I
</p>
<p>told her how I had been to visit her father at Green-

</p>
<p>"My father," says she, stopping short. "Oh, what a
</p>
<p>heartless, selfish creature am I ! I have not thought of him
</p>
<p>in my happiness. Nay, had he been dead I could not
</p>
<p>have forgot him more. You saw him is he well? "
</p>
<p>" As hearty as you could wish, and full of love for you,
</p>
<p>and rejoiced beyond measure to know you are to marry a
</p>
<p>brave, honest gentleman." Then I told how we had drunk
</p>
<p>to their health, and how her father had smashed his mug
</p>
<p>for a fancy. And this bringing a smile to her cheek, I
</p>
<p>went on to tell how he craved to see Mr. Godwin and grip
</p>
<p>his hand.
</p>
<p>"Oh, if he could see what a noble, handsome man my
</p>
<p>Richard is! " cries she. "I do think my heart would ache
</p>
<p>for pride."
</p>
<p>"Why, so it shall," says I, "for your father does intend
</p>
<p>to come hither before long."
</p>
<p>" He is coming to see my dear husband ! " says she, her
</p>
<p>face aglow with joy.
</p>
<p>" Aye, but he does promise to be most circumspect, and
</p>
<p>appear as if, returning from a voyage, he had come but to
</p>
<p>see how you fare, and will stay no longer than is reason-
</p>
<p>ably civil."
</p>
<p>"Only that," says she, her countenance falling again,
</p>
<p>"we are to hide our love, pretend indifference, behave
</p>
<p>towards this dear father as if he were nought to me but a
</p>
<p>friend."
</p>
<p>"My dear," says I, "'tis no new part you have to play."
</p>
<p>"I know it," she answers hotly, "but that makes it only
</p>
<p>the worse."
</p>
<p>"Well, what would you?"

</p>
<p>moments' silence o' both sides, "Oh, if I were really
</p>
<p>Judith Godwin! "
</p>
<p>"If you were she, you'd be in Barbary now, and have
</p>
<p>neither father nor lover; is that what you want?" says I,
</p>
<p>with some impatience.
</p>
<p>"Bear with me," says she, with a humility as strange in
</p>
<p>her as these new-born scruples of conscience.
</p>
<p>"You may be sure of this, my dear," says I, in a gentler
</p>
<p>tone, " if you were anything but what you are, Mr. Godwin
</p>
<p>would not marry you."
</p>
<p>"Why, then, not tell him what I am? " asks she, boldly.
</p>
<p>"That means that you would be to-morrow what you're

<p>not to-day."

<p>" If he told me he had done wrong, I could forgive him,

<p>"Oh, no, no, no!" cries she.

<p>of a noble, honest gentleman, the joy of raising him from
</p>

</p>
<p>"Oh, say no more," cries she, in passion. "I know not
</p>
<p>what madness possessed me to overlook such consequences.
</p>
<p>I kiss you for bringing me to my senses " (with that she
</p>
<p>catches up my hand and presses her lips to it again and
</p>
<p>again). "Look in my face," cries she, "and if you find
</p>
<p>a lurking vestige of irresolution there, I'll tear it out."
</p>
<p>Indeed, I could see nothing but set determination in her
</p>
<p>countenance, a most hard expression of fixed resolve, that
</p>
<p>seemed to age her by ten years, astonishing me not less
</p>
<p>than those other phases in her rapidly developing character.
</p>
<p>"Now," says she, quickly, and with not a note of her
</p>
<p>repining tone, "what was that you spoke of lately, you
</p>
<p>are to be our steward? "
</p>
<p>"Yes," says I, "for Mr. Godwin has declared most firmly
</p>
<p>that the moment he has authority he will cast Simon out
</p>
<p>for his disloyalty."
</p>
<p>"I will not leave that ungrateful duty to him," says she.
</p>
<p>"Take me to this wretch at once, and choose the shortest

<p>path."
</p>
<p>I led her back across the common, and coming to
</p>
<p>Simon's lodge, she herself knocked loudly at the door.
</p>
<p>Seeing who it was through his little grating, Simon
</p>
<p>quickly opens the door, and with fawning humility entreats
</p>
<p>her to step into his poor room, and there he stands, cring-
</p>
<p>ing and mopping his eyes, in dreadful apprehension, as

<p>having doubtless gathered from some about the house how

<p>2O8 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>Perceiving how the land lay, and finding himself thus
</p>
<p>beset, old Simon falls to his usual artifices, turning this way
</p>
<p>and that, like a rat in a pit, to find some hole for escape.
</p>
<p>First he feigns to misunderstand, then, clapping his hands
</p>
<p>in his pockets, he knows not where he can have laid them;
</p>
<p>after that fancies he must have given them to his man.
</p>
<p>Peter, who is gone out of an errand, etc. ; until Moll,
</p>
<p>losing patience, cut him short by declaring the loss of the
</p>
<p>keys unimportant, as doubtless a locksmith could be found
</p>
<p>to open his boxes and drawers without 'em.
</p>
<p>"My chief requirement is," adds she, "that you leave
</p>
<p>this house forthwith, and return no more."
</p>
<p>Upon this, finding further evasion impossible, the old
</p>
<p>man turns to bay, and asks upon what grounds she would
</p>
<p>dismiss him without writ or warrant.
</p>
<p>"Tis sufficient," returns she, "that this house is mine,
</p>
<p>and that I will not have you a day longer for my tenant or
</p>
<p>my servant. If you dispute my claim, as I am told you
</p>
<p>do, you may take what lawful means you please to dis-
</p>
<p>possess me of my estate, and at the same time redress what
</p>
<p>wrong is done you."
</p>
<p>Seeing his secret treachery discovered, Simon falls now to
</p>
<p>his whining arts, telling once more of his constant toil to
</p>
<p>enrich her, his thrift and self-denial ; nay, he even carries it
</p>
<p>so far as to show that he did but incite Mr. Godwin to dis-
</p>
<p>pute her title to the estate, that thereby her claim should be
</p>
<p>justified before the law to the obtaining of her succession
</p>
<p>without further delay, and at the expense of her cousin,
</p>
<p>which did surpass anything I had ever heard of for artful-
</p>
<p>ness. But this only incensed Moll the more.

</p>
<p>force."
</p>
<p>He stood some moments in deliberation, and then he
</p>
<p>says, with a certain dignity unusual to him, " I will go."
</p>
<p>Then he casts his eye slowly round the room, with a linger-
</p>
<p>ing regard for his piles of documents and precious boxes of
</p>
<p>title deeds, as if he were bidding a last farewell to all that

<p>was dear to him on earth, and grotesque as his appearance

<p>might be, there was yet something pathetic in it. But even
</p>
<p>at this moment his ruling passion prevailed.
</p>
<p>"There is no need," says he, "to burst these goodly
</p>
<p>locks by force. I do bethink me the keys are here " (open-
</p>
<p>ing a drawer, and laying them upon the table). Then
</p>
<p>dropping his head, he goes slowly to the door, but there he
</p>
<p>turns, lifting his head and fixing his rheumy eyes on Moll.
</p>
<p>" I will take nothing from this house, not even the chattels
</p>
<p>that belong to me, bought from the mean wage I have
</p>
<p>allowed myself. So shalt thou judge of my honesty. They
</p>
<p>shall stand here till I return, for that I shall return I am as
</p>
<p>fully persuaded as that a just God doth dispose of his
</p>
<p>creatures. Thee hast might on thy side, woman, but
</p>
<p>whether thee hast right as well, shall yet be proven not
</p>
<p>by the laws of man, which are an invention of the devil to
</p>
<p>fatten rogues upon the substance of fools, but by the law of
</p>
<p>Heaven, to which I do appeal with all my soul " (lifting
</p>
<p>high his shaking hands). "Morning and night I will pray
</p>
<p>that God shall smite with heavy hand which of us two hath
</p>
<p>most wronged the other. Offer the same prayer if thee
</p>
<p>darest."

<p>2IO A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>I do confess that this parting shot went home to my con-
</p>
<p>science, and troubled my mind considerably ; for feeling that
</p>
<p>he was in the right of it as regarded our relative honesty, I
</p>
<p>was constrained to think that his prophecy might come true
</p>
<p>also to our shame and undoing. But Moll was afflicted with
</p>
<p>no such qualms, her spirit being very combative and high,
</p>
<p>and her conscience (such as it was) being hardened by our
</p>
<p>late discussion to resist sharper slaps than this. Nay, main-
</p>
<p>taining that Simon must be dishonest by the proof we had
</p>
<p>of his hypocrisy and double dealing, she would have me
</p>
<p>enter upon my office at once by sending letters to all her
</p>
<p>tenants, warning them to pay no rent to any one lately in
</p>
<p>her service, but only to me ; and these letters (which kept
</p>
<p>my pen going all that afternoon) she signed with the name
</p>
<p>of Judith Godwin, which seemed to me a very bold, danger-
</p>
<p>ous piece of business ; but she would have it so, and did her
</p>
<p>signature with a strong hand and a flourish of loops beneath
</p>
<p>like any queen.
</p>
<p>Nor was this all ; for the next morning she would have me
</p>
<p>go to that Mr. Goodman, who had offered to buy her farm
</p>
<p>for ready money, and get what I could from him, seeing
</p>
<p>that she must furnish herself with fresh gowns and make other
</p>
<p>outlay for her coming marriage. So to him I go, and after
</p>
<p>much haggling (having learnt from Simon that the land was
</p>
<p>worth more than he offered for it), I brought him to give
</p>
<p>six thousand pounds instead of five, and this was clearly
</p>
<p>better business on his side than on mine at that, for that
</p>
<p>the bargain might not slip from his hands he would have me
</p>
<p>take three thousand pounds down as a handsell, leaving the
</p>
<p>rest to be paid when the deed of transference was drawn up.

</p>
<p>And now as I jogged home with all this gold chinking in
</p>
<p>AM CONVINCED OF MY ROGUERY. 211
</p>
<p>my pockets, I did feel that I had thrust my head fairly into
</p>
<p>a halter, and no chance left of drawing it out. Look at it
</p>
<p>how I might, this business wore a most curst aspect, to be
</p>
<p>sure ; nor could I regard myself as anything but a thorough-
</p>
<p>paced rogue.
</p>
<p>" For," thinks I, " if old Simon's prayer be answered,
</p>
<p>what will become of this poor Mr. Goodman? His title
</p>
<p>deeds will be wrested from him, for they are but stolen
</p>
<p>goods he is paying for, and thus an innocent, honest man
</p>
<p>will be utterly ruined. And for doing this villany I may
</p>
<p>count myself lucky if my heels save my neck."
</p>
<p>With this weight on my mind, I resolved to be very
</p>
<p>watchful and careful of my safety, and before I fell asleep
</p>
<p>that night I had devised a dozen schemes for making good
</p>
<p>my escape as soon as I perceived danger ; nevertheless, I
</p>
<p>could dream of nothing but prisons, scourgings, etc., and in
</p>
<p>every vision I perceived old Simon in his leather skull-cap
</p>
<p>sitting on the top of Tyburn tree, with his handkercher

<p>A table of various accidents,
</p>
<p>As your guide, showing you an exhibition of paintings,
</p>
<p>will linger over the first room, and then pass the second in
</p>
<p>hurried review to come the quicker to a third of greater
</p>
<p>interest, so I, having dwelt, may be, at undue length upon
</p>
<p>some secondary passages in this history, must economise my
</p>
<p>space by touching lightly on the events that came immediately
</p>
<p>before Moll's marriage, and so get to those more moving ac-
</p>
<p>cidents which followed. Here, therefore, will I transcribe
</p>
<p>certain notes (forming a brief chronicle) from that secret
</p>
<p>journal which, for the clearer understanding of my position,
</p>
<p>I began to keep the day I took possession of Simon's lodge
</p>
<p>and entered upon my new office.
</p>
<p>December 8. Very busy all this forenoon setting my new
</p>
<p>house in order, conveying, with the help of the gardener,
</p>
<p>all those domestic and personal goods that belong to Simon
</p>
<p>into the attick ; but Lord ! so few these things, and they so
</p>
<p>patched and worn, that altogether they are not worth ten
</p>
<p>shillings of anybody's money. I find the house wondrous
</p>
<p>neat and clean in every part, but so comfortless and prison-
</p>
<p>like, that I look forward with little relish to living here when
</p>
<p>the time comes for me to leave the Court. After this to
</p>
<p>examining books, papers, etc., and the more closely I look

</p>
<p>into these, the more assured I am that never was any servant
</p>
<p>THE DON GREATLY MISDOUBTS OUR WISDOM. 213
</p>
<p>more scrupulous, exact, and honest in his master's service
</p>
<p>than this old steward, which puts me to the hope that I may
</p>
<p>be only half as faithful to my trust as he, but I do fear I
</p>
<p>shall not.
</p>
<p>Conversing privily with Don Sanchez after dinner, he gave
</p>
<p>me his opinion that we had done a very unwise thing in turn-
</p>
<p>ing out old Simon, showing how by a little skill I might have
</p>
<p>persuaded Moll to leave this business to Mr. Godwin as
</p>
<p>the proper ruler of her estate ; how by such delay Mr.
</p>
<p>Godwin's resentment would have abated and he willing to
</p>
<p>listen to good argument in the steward's favour ; how then we
</p>
<p>should have made Simon more eager than ever to serve us
</p>
<p>in order to condone his late offence, and how by abusing
</p>
<p>our opportunities we had changed this useful servant to a
</p>
<p>dangerous enemy whose sole endeavour must be to undo
</p>
<p>us and recover his former position, etc. ... " Why, what
</p>
<p>have we to fear of this miserable old man?" says I. "Un-
</p>
<p>less he fetch Mrs. Godwin from Barbary, he cannot disprove
</p>
<p>Moll's right to the estate, and what else can he do ? "
</p>
<p>" There's the mischief of it," answers he. " Tis because
</p>
<p>you know not how he may attack you that you have no
</p>
<p>means of defending yourself. 'Tis ever the unseen trifle
</p>
<p>in our path which trips us up." And dismissing this part
</p>
<p>of the subject with a hunch of his shoulders, he advises
</p>
<p>me seriously to sell as many more farms as I may for
</p>
<p>ready money, and keep it in some secret convenient cor-
</p>
<p>ner where I may lay hands on it at a moment's warning.
</p>
<p>This discourse coming atop of a night's ill rest, depressed
</p>
<p>my mind to such a degree that I could take no interest in
</p>
<p>my work, but sat there in my naked room with my accounts

<p>before me, and no spirit to cast 'em up. Nor was I much
</p>
<p>214 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>happier when I gave up work and returned to the Court. For,
</p>
<p>besides having to wait an hour later than usual for dinner,
</p>
<p>Moll's treatment of me was none of the best, she being
</p>
<p>particularly perverse and contrary, for having dressed
</p>
<p>herself in her best in expectation of her lover's return, and
</p>
<p>he not coming when at last she permitted supper to be
</p>
<p>dished. We were scarcely seated, however, when she
</p>
<p>springs up with a cry of joy and runs from the room, crying
</p>
<p>she hears her Richard's step, which was indeed true, though
</p>
<p>we had heard nothing more pleasant than the rattle of our
</p>
<p>plates. Presently they come in, all radiant with happiness,
</p>
<p>hand in hand, and thenceforth nought but sweetness and
</p>
<p>mirth on the part of Mistress Moll, who before had been all
</p>
<p>frown and pout. At supper Mr. Godwin tells us how his
</p>
<p>sweetheart hath certainly dispelled the clouds that have
</p>
<p>hung so long over him, he having heard in London that
</p>
<p>Sir Peter Lely, on seeing one of his pieces, desires to see
</p>
<p>him at Hatfield (where he is painting) on good business,
</p>
<p>and to Hatfield he will go to discharge this matter before
</p>
<p>his marriage ; which joyeth Moll less than me, I being
</p>
<p>pleased to see he is still of the same, stout disposition to
</p>
<p>live an active life. In the evening he gives Moll a very
</p>
<p>beautiful ring for a troth token, which transports her with
</p>
<p>joy, so that she cannot enough caress her lover or this toy,
</p>
<p>but falls first to kissing one and then t'other in a rapture.
</p>
<p>In return, she gives him a ring from her finger. " Tis too
</p>
<p>small for my finger, love," says he ; " but I will wear it
</p>
<p>against my heart as long as it beats." After that he finds
</p>
<p>another case and puts it in Moll's hand, and she, opening it,
</p>
<p>fetches her breath quickly and can say nothing for amaze-

<p>ment ; then, turning it in the light, she regards it with wink-

</p>
<p>ing eyes, as if dazzled by some fierce brilliancy. And so
</p>
<p>closing the case as if it were too much for her, she lays her
</p>
<p>face upon Mr. Godwin's breast, he having his arm about
</p>
<p>her, murmuring some inarticulate words of passionate love.
</p>
<p>Recovering her energies presently, she starts up, and putting
</p>
<p>the case in her lover's hand, she bids him put on his gift,
</p>
<p>therewith pulling down her kerchief to expose her beautiful
</p>
<p>bare^eck, whereupon he draws from the box a diamond
</p>
<p>collar and clasps it about her throat with a pretty speech.
</p>
<p>And truly this was a gift worthy of a princess, the most
</p>
<p>beautiful bauble I have ever seen, and must have cost him
</p>
<p>all he had of me to the last shilling.
</p>
<p>December 10. Finding amongst Simon's quittances a bill
</p>
<p>for law expenses of one John Pearson, attorney, at Maid-
</p>
<p>stone, I concluded this must be the most trustworthy man
</p>
<p>of his kind in the country ; and so set forth early this morn-
</p>
<p>ing to seek him, a tedious, long journey, and the roads
</p>
<p>exceedingly foul. By good luck I found Mr. Pearson at
</p>
<p>home, a very civil, shrewd man, as I think. Having laid
</p>
<p>my business before him, he tells me there will be no diffi-
</p>
<p>culty in dividing the estate according to the wish of Mr.
</p>
<p>Godwin and Moll, which may be done by a simple deed of
</p>
<p>agreement ; and this he promises to draw up, and send to
</p>
<p>us for signature in a couple of days. But to get the seal to
</p>
<p>Moll's succession will not be such an easy matter, and, unless
</p>
<p>we are willing to give seven or eight hundred pounds in
</p>
<p>fees, we may be kept waiting a year, with the chance of
</p>
<p>being put to greater expense to prove our right ; for he tells
</p>
<p>me the court and all about it are so corrupt that no minis-
</p>
<p>ter is valued if he do not, by straight or crooked ways, draw

<p>money into the treasury, and that they will rather impede
</p>
<p>2l6 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>than aid the course of justice if it be to the king's interest,
</p>
<p>and that none will stir a hand to the advantage of any one
</p>
<p>but the king, unless it be secretly to his own, etc. And,
</p>
<p>though he will say nothing against Simon, save (by way of
</p>
<p>hint) that all men must be counted honest till they are
</p>
<p>proved guilty, yet he do apprehend he will do all in his
</p>
<p>power to obstruct the granting of this seal, which it is only
</p>
<p>reasonable to suppose he will. So, to close this discussion,
</p>
<p>I agree he shall spend as much as one thousand pounds
</p>
<p>in bribery, and he thinks we may certainly look to have it
</p>
<p>in a month at that price. Home late, and very sore.
</p>
<p>December n. Much astonished this morning on going
</p>
<p>to my house to find all changed within as if by inchantment
</p>
<p>fine hangings to my windows, handsome furniture in every
</p>
<p>room, all arranged in due order (with a pair of pictures in my
</p>
<p>parlour), the linen press stocked with all that is needful and
</p>
<p>more, and even the cellar well garnished with wines, etc.
</p>
<p>And truly thus embellished my house looks no longer like a
</p>
<p>prison, but as cheerful and pleasant a dwelling-place as the
</p>
<p>heart of man could desire (in moderation) , and better than
</p>
<p>any I have yet dreamt of possessing. And 'twas easy to
</p>
<p>guess whose hands had worked this transformation, even had
</p>
<p>I not recognised certain pieces of furniture as coming from
</p>
<p>the Court, for 'twas of a piece with Moll's loving and play-
</p>
<p>ful spirit to prepare this surprise for me while I was gone
</p>
<p>yesterday to Maidstone. I am resolved I will sleep here
</p>
<p>henceforth, there being two bedrooms all properly fur-
</p>
<p>nished, as being more in keeping with my new position.

</p>
<p>his best shore-going manners on. And when Moll very
</p>
<p>graciously offers him her hand, he whips out a red hand-
</p>
<p>kercher and lays it over her hand before kissing it, which
</p>
<p>was a piece of ceremony he must have observed at Green-
</p>
<p>wich, as also many odd phrases and sea expressions with
</p>
<p>which he garnished his conversation.
</p>
<p>" Captain Evans," says Moll, taking her lover's hand,
</p>
<p>" this is Mr. Godwin, my cousin, and soon to be my hus-
</p>
<p>band."
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin holds forth his hand, but ere he would take
</p>
<p>it, Dawson looks him full in the face a good minute ; then,
</p>
<p>taking it in his great grimy hand, and grasping it firmly,
</p>
<p>" Master," says Jack, " I see thou art an honest man, and
</p>
<p>none lives who hath ever sold me tar for pitch, be he never
</p>
<p>so double-faced, and so I wish you joy of your sweet wife.
</p>
<p>As for you, Mistress " (turning to Moll) " who have ever been
</p>
<p>kind to me beyond my deserts, I do wish you all the happi-
</p>
<p>ness in the world, and I count all my hardships well paid
</p>
<p>in bringing you safely to this anchorage. For sure I would
</p>
<p>sooner you were still Lala Mollah and a slave in Barbary
</p>
<p>than the Queen of Chiney and ill-mated ; and so Lord love
</p>
<p>the both of you !"
</p>
<p>After staying a couple of hours with us, he was for going
</p>
<p>(but not before he had given us the instructive history of
</p>
<p>the torment he had endured, by telling his wife, in an un-
</p>
<p>guarded moment, of his gallantries with Sukey Taylor), nor
</p>
<p>would he be persuaded to sleep at the Court and leave next
</p>
<p>day, maintaining that whilst he had never a penny in the
</p>
<p>world he could very honestly accept Moll's hospitality,
</p>
<p>but that now being well-to-do, thanks to her bounty, he

<p>blessed Heaven he had sufficient good breeding, and
</p>
<p>2l8 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>valued himself well enough not to take advantage of her
</p>
<p>beneficence. However, hearing I had a house of my own,
</p>
<p>and could offer him a bed, he willingly agreed to be my
</p>
<p>guest for the night, regarding me as one of his own quality.
</p>
<p>We stayed to sup at the Court, where he entertained us
</p>
<p>with a lengthy account of his late voyage, and how being
</p>
<p>taken in a tempest, his masts had all been swept by the
</p>
<p>board, and his craft so damaged that 'twas as much as she
</p>
<p>would hold together till he brought her into Falmouth, where
</p>
<p>she must lie a-repairing a good two months ere he could
</p>
<p>again venture to sea in her. And this story he told with
</p>
<p>such an abundance of detail and so many nautical partic-
</p>
<p>ulars, that no one in the world could have dreamt he was
</p>
<p>lying.
</p>
<p>He explained to me later on that he had refused to lie at
</p>
<p>the Court, for fear a glass or two after supper might lead his
</p>
<p>tongue astray, telling me that he had touched nothing but
</p>
<p>penny ale all his long journey from London, for fear of
</p>
<p>losing his head ; and on my asking why he had fabricated
</p>
<p>that long history of shipwreck he vowed I had put him to it
</p>
<p>by saying I had a house of my own where he could lie ;
</p>
<p>" For," says he, " my ship being laid up will furnish me
</p>
<p>with a very good excuse for coming to spend a day or two
</p>
<p>with you now and then. So may I get another glimpse of
</p>
<p>my own dear Moll, and see her in the fulness of her joy."
</p>
<p>He could not sufficiently cry up the excellence of Mr.
</p>
<p>Godwin, his noble bearing, his frank, honest countenance,
</p>
<p>his tenderness for Moll, etc., and he did truly shed tears of
</p>
<p>gratitude to think that now, whatever befell him, her wel-
</p>
<p>fare and happiness were assured; but this was when he had

</p>
<p>which usually preceded boisterous hilarity when he was in

<p>his cups.
</p>
<p>And whilst I am speaking of bottles, it will not be amiss
</p>
<p>to note here, for my future warning, a grave imprudence
</p>
<p>of mine, which I discovered on leaving the room to seek
</p>
<p>more wine. On the flame of my candle blowing aside, I
</p>
<p>perceived that I had left my door unfastened, so that it
</p>
<p>now stood ajar. And, truly, this was as culpable a piece
</p>
<p>of oversight as I could well have committed; for here, had

</p>
<p>How Moll Dawson was married to Mr. Richard Godwin; brief
</p>
<p>account of attendant circumstances.
</p>
<p>December 14. Dawson left us this morning. In part-
</p>
<p>ing, Mr. Godwin graciously begged him to come to his
</p>
<p>wedding feast on Christmas day, they having fixed upon
</p>
<p>Christmas eve to be married, and Dawson promised he
</p>
<p>would; but he did assure me afterwards, as we were walk-
</p>
<p>ing along the road to meet the stage waggon, that he would
</p>
<p>certainly feign some reason for not coming. "For," says
</p>
<p>he, "I am not so foolhardy as to jeopardise my Moll's hap-
</p>
<p>piness for the pleasure this feast would give me. Nay,
</p>
<p>Kit, I do think 'twould break my heart indeed, if anything
</p>
<p>of my doing should mar my Moll's happiness." And I
</p>
<p>was very well pleased to find him in this humour, promising
</p>
<p>him that we would make amends for his abstinence on this
</p>
<p>occasion by cracking many a bottle to Moll's joy when we
</p>
<p>could come together again secretly at my house. In the
</p>
<p>afternoon Mr. Pearson's clerk brought the deed of agree-
</p>
<p>ment for the settlement of the estate upon Moll and Mr.
</p>
<p>Godwin, which they signed, and so that is finished as we
</p>
<p>would have it. This clerk tells me his master hath already
</p>
<p>gone to London about getting the seal. So all things look
</p>
<p>mighty prosperous.

<p>December 77. Fearing to displease Sir Peter Lely by
</p>
<p>longer delay, Mr. Godwin set out for Hatfield Tuesday,

</p>
<p>we that is, Moll, Don Sanchez, and I going with him
</p>
<p>as far as the borough, where Moll had a thousand things to
</p>
<p>buy against her wedding. And here we found great activ-
</p>
<p>ity of commerce, and many shops filled with excellent good
</p>
<p>goods, more than ever there were before the great fire
</p>
<p>drove out so many tradesmen from the city. Here Moll
</p>
<p>spends her money royally, buying whatever catches her eye
</p>
<p>that is rich and beautiful, not only for her own personal
</p>
<p>adornment, but for the embellishment of her house (as
</p>
<p>hangings, damasks, toys, etc.), yet always with a consider-
</p>
<p>ation of Mr. Godwin's taste, so that I think she would not
</p>
<p>buy a pair of stockings but she must ask herself whether he
</p>
<p>would admire 'em. And the more she had, the more
</p>
<p>eager she grew to have, buying by candle-light, which was
</p>
<p>an imprudence, and making no sort of bargain, but giving
</p>
<p>all the shopkeepers asked for their wares, which, to be
</p>
<p>sure, was another piece of recklessness. This business
</p>
<p>seemed to me the most wearisome in the world, but it
</p>
<p>served only to increase her energies, and she would not be
</p>
<p>persuaded to desist until, the shops closing, she could lay
</p>
<p>out no more money that night. Supped very well (but
</p>
<p>mighty late) at the Tabard inn, where we lay all night.
</p>
<p>And the next morning, Moll's fever still unabated, we set
</p>
<p>out again a-shopping, and no rest until we caught the stage
</p>
<p>(and that by a miracle) at four; and so home, dead beat.
</p>
<p>December 18. Moll mad all day because the carrier hath
</p>
<p>brought but half her purchases, and they not what she
</p>
<p>wanted. By the evening waggon come three seamstresses
</p>
<p>she engaged yesterday morning, and they are to stay in the
</p>
<p>house till all is finished; but as yet nothing for them to do,

</p>
<p>which is less grievous to them than to poor Moll, who, I
</p>
<p>222 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>believe, would set 'em working all night for fear she shall
</p>
<p>not be fitted against her wedding.
</p>
<p>December 19. Thank God, the carrier brought all our
</p>
<p>packages this morning, and they being all undone and laid
</p>
<p>out, there is no sitting down anywhere with comfort, but
</p>
<p>all confusion, and no regularity anywhere, so I was content
</p>
<p>to get my meals in the kitchen the best I could. And here
</p>
<p>I do perceive the wisdom of Don Sanchez, who did not
</p>
<p>return with us from London, and does intend (he told me)
</p>
<p>to stay there till the wedding eve.
</p>
<p>December 20. Moll, bit by a new maggot, tells me this
</p>
<p>morning she will have a great feast on Christmas day, and
</p>
<p>bids me order matters accordingly. She will have a whole
</p>
<p>ox roasted before the house by midday, and barrels of strong
</p>
<p>ale set up, that there may be meat and drink for all who
</p>
<p>choose to take it; and at four she will have a supper of
</p>
<p>geese, Jturkeys, and plum puddings for all her tenants, their
</p>
<p>wives and sweethearts, with fiddles afterwards for dancing,
</p>
<p>etc. Lord knows how we shall come out of this madness;
</p>
<p>but I have got the innkeeper (a busy, capable man) to help
</p>
<p>me, and he does assure me all will go well enough, and I
</p>
<p>pray he be right.
</p>
<p>December 21. Sick with fears that all must end ill.
</p>
<p>For the place is a very Babel for tradesmen and work-
</p>
<p>people bringing in goods, and knowing not where to set
</p>
<p>them, servants hurrying this way and that, one charged
</p>
<p>with a dozen geese, another with silk petticoats, jostling
</p>
<p>each other, laughing, quarrelling, and no sort of progress,
</p>
<p>as it seems, anywhere, but all tumult and disorder.

</p>
<p>us, and finding it must eat up all that money we had of
</p>
<p>poor Mr. Goodman, and make a deep hole in our quarter's
</p>
<p>rents besides, I fell a speculating whether our tenants
</p>
<p>would pay me with the same punctuality they have used to
</p>
<p>pay old Simon, with grievous fears to the contrary. For,
</p>
<p>assuredly, Simon hath not been idle these past days, and
</p>
<p>will do us an ill turn if he can, by throwing doubts before
</p>
<p>these same tenants whether they should pay or not before
</p>
<p>Moll's succession is made sure. And I have good reason
</p>
<p>to fear they will not, for I observed yesterday when I called
</p>
<p>upon Farmer Giles to invite him to our feast, he seemed
</p>
<p>very jerky and ill at ease, which perplexed me greatly,
</p>
<p>until, on quitting, I perceived through a door that stood
</p>
<p>ajar old Simon seated in a side room. And 'tis but natural
</p>
<p>that if they find prudent excuse for withholding their rents
</p>
<p>they will keep their money in pocket, which will pinch us
</p>
<p>smartly when our bills come to be paid. Yet I conceived
</p>
<p>that this feast would incline our tenants to regard us kindly;
</p>
<p>but, on the other hand, thinks I, supposing they regard this
</p>
<p>as a snare, and do avoid us altogether ! Then shall we be
</p>
<p>nipped another way; for, having no one to eat our feast
</p>
<p>but a few idle rogues, who would get beef and ale for noth-
</p>
<p>ing, we shall but lay ourselves open to mockery, and get
</p>
<p>further into discredit. Thus, betwixt one fear and another,
</p>
<p>I lay like a toad under a harrow, all night, in a mortal sweat
</p>
<p>and perturbation of spirit.
</p>
<p>Nor has this day done much to allay my apprehension.
</p>
<p>For at the Court all is still at sixes and sevens, none of a
</p>
<p>very cheerful spirit, but all mighty anxious, save Moll, who
</p>
<p>throughout has kept a high, bold spirit. And she does de-

</p>
<p>place before her lover comes to-morrow. And, truly, I
</p>
<p>pray they may, but do think they will not. For such a
</p>
<p>mighty business as this should have been begun a full month
</p>
<p>back. But she will not endure me in the house (though
</p>
<p>God knows I am as willing as any to help), saying that I
</p>
<p>do hinder all, and damp their spirit for work with my
</p>
<p>gloomy countenance, which is no more than the truth, I
</p>
<p>fear. The sky very overcast, with wind in the south and
</p>
<p>the air very muggy, mild, and close, so that I do apprehend
</p>
<p>our geese will be all stinking before they are eat. And if
</p>
<p>it pour of rain on Christmas day how will the ox be roast,
</p>
<p>and what sort of company can we expect? This puts me
</p>
<p>to another taking for dread of a new fiasco.
</p>
<p>December 23. Going to the Court about midday, I was
</p>
<p>dumbfounded to find no sign of the disorder that pre-
</p>
<p>vailed there yesterday, but all swept and garnished, and
</p>
<p>Moll in a brave new gown seated at her fireside, reading a
</p>
<p>book with the utmost tranquillity, though I suspect she
</p>
<p>did assume something in this to increase my astonishment.
</p>
<p>She was largely diverted by my amazement, and made very
</p>
<p>light of her achievement; but she admitted that all had
</p>
<p>worked till daybreak, and she had slept but two hours since.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, no one could have looked fresher and brighter
</p>
<p>than she, so healthy and vigorous are her natural parts.
</p>
<p>About one comes Mr. Godwin to cap her happiness and
</p>
<p>give fresh glory to her beauty. And sure a handsomer
</p>
<p>or better mated couple never was, Mr. Godwin's shapely
</p>
<p>figure being now set off to advantage by a very noble cloth-
</p>
<p>ing, as becoming his condition. With him came also by
</p>
<p>the morning stage Don Sanchez, mighty fine in a new

</p>
<p>coat. And seeing the brave show they made at table, I
</p>
<p>was much humbled to think I had gone to no expense in
</p>
<p>this particular. But I was yet more mortified when Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez presents Moll with a handsome set of jewels for a
</p>
<p>wedding gift, to see that I had nothing in the world to
</p>
<p>offer her, having as yet taken not a penny of her money,
</p>
<p>save for the use of others and my bare necessities. Moll,
</p>
<p>however, was too full of happiness to note this omission on
</p>
<p>my part; she could think of no one now but her dear hus-
</p>
<p>band, and I counted for nothing.
</p>
<p>However, this little chagrin was no more than a little
</p>
<p>cloud on a summer's day, which harms no one and is
</p>
<p>quickly dispelled by generous heat; and the tender affec-
</p>
<p>tion of these two for each other did impart a glow of hap-
</p>
<p>piness to my heart. 'Tis strange to think how all things
</p>
<p>to-night look bright and hopeful, which yesterday were
</p>
<p>gloomy and awesome. Even the weather hath changed to
</p>
<p>keep in harmony with our condition. A fresh wind sprang
</p>
<p>up from the north this morning, and to-night every star
</p>
<p>shines out sharp and clear through the frosty air, promis-
</p>
<p>ing well for to-morrow and our Christmas feast. And
</p>
<p>smelling of the geese, I do now find them all as sweet as
</p>
<p>nuts, which contents me mightily, and so I shall go to bed
</p>
<p>this night blessing God for all things.
</p>
<p>December 24. Now this blessed day hath ended, and
</p>
<p>Moll is sure and safely bound to Mr. Godwin in wedlock,
</p>
<p>thanks to Providence. Woke at daybreak and joyed to
</p>
<p>find all white without and covered with rime, sparkling
</p>
<p>like diamonds as the sun rose red and jolly above the firs;
</p>
<p>and so I thought our dear Moll's life must sparkle as she
</p>
<p>looked out on this, which is like to be the brightest, happi-

</p>
<p>est day of her life. Dressed in my best with great care,
</p>
<p>and put on the favour of white ribbons given me by Moll's
</p>
<p>woman last night, and so very well pleased with my looks,
</p>
<p>to the Court, where Moll is still a-dressing, but Mr. Godwin
</p>
<p>and Don Sanchez, nobly arrayed, conversing before the
</p>
<p>fire. And here a great bowpot on the table (which Mr.
</p>
<p>Godwin had made to come from London this morning) of
</p>
<p>the most wondrous flowers I have ever seen at this time of
</p>
<p>the year, so that I could not believe them real at first, but
</p>
<p>they are indeed living; and Mr. Godwin tells me they are
</p>
<p>raised in houses of glass very artificially heated. Presently
</p>
<p>comes in Moll with her maids, she looking like any pearl,
</p>
<p>in a shining gown of white satin decked with rich lace, the
</p>
<p>collar of diamonds glittering about her white throat, her
</p>
<p>face suffused with happy blushes and past everything for
</p>
<p>sprightly beauty. Mr. Godwin offers his bowpot and takes
</p>
<p>her into his arms, and there for a moment she lay with
</p>
<p>closed eyes and a pallor spreading over her cheek as if this
</p>
<p>joy were more than her heart could bear; but recovering
</p>
<p>quickly, she was again all lively smiles and radiance.
</p>
<p>Then comes a letter, brought by the night carrier, from
</p>
<p>her father (a most dirty, ill-written scrawl signed Robert
</p>
<p>Evans with his mark), praying he may be excused, as his
</p>
<p>masts are to be stepped o' Wednesday, and he must take
</p>
<p>the occasion of a ketch leaving Dartford for Falmouth this
</p>
<p>day, and at the same time begging her acceptance of a
</p>
<p>canister of China tea (which is, I learn, become a fashion-
</p>
<p>able dish in London) as a marriage offering. Soon after
</p>
<p>this a maid runs in to say the church bells are a-ringing; so
</p>
<p>out we go into the crisp, fresh air, with not a damp place

<p>maids next, carrying her train, and the Don and I closing
</p>
<p>the procession, very stately. In the churchyard stand two
</p>
<p>rows of village maids with baskets to strew rosemary and
</p>
<p>sweet herbs in our path, and within the church a brave
</p>
<p>show of gentlefolks, friends and neighbours, to honour the
</p>
<p>wedding.
</p>
<p>But here was I put to a most horrid quaking the moment
</p>
<p>I passed the door, to perceive old Simon standing fore-
</p>
<p>most in the throng about the altar, in his leather cap
</p>
<p>(which he would not remove for clerk or sexton, but
</p>
<p>threatened them, as I am told, with the law if they lay a
</p>
<p>ringer on him). And seeing him there, I must needs con-
</p>
<p>clude that he intended to do us an ill turn, for his face
</p>
<p>wore the most wicked, cruel, malicious look that ever thirst
</p>
<p>of vengeance could impart. Indeed, I expected nothing
</p>
<p>less than that he would forbid the marriage on such
</p>
<p>grounds as we had too good reason to fear; and with this
</p>
<p>dread I regarded Moll, who also could not fail to see him.
</p>
<p>Her face whitened as she looked at him, but her step never
</p>
<p>faltered, and this peril seemed but to fortify her courage
</p>
<p>and resolution; and indeed I do think by her high bearing
</p>
<p>and the defiance in her eye as she held her lover's arm
</p>
<p>that she was fully prepared to make good answer if he chal-
</p>
<p>lenged her right to marry Mr. Godwin. But (the Lord be
</p>
<p>thanked ! ) he did not put her to this trial, only he stood
</p>
<p>there like a thing of evil omen to mar the joy of this day
</p>
<p>with fearful foreboding.
</p>
<p>I can say nothing about the ceremony, for all my atten-
</p>
<p>tion was fixed upon this hideous Simon, and I had no
</p>
<p>relief until 'twas safely ended and Moll's friends pressed

</p>
<p>did I feel really at ease until we were back again at the
</p>
<p>Court, and seated to a fine dinner, with all the friends who
</p>
<p>would join us, whereof there were as many as could sit
</p>
<p>comfortably to the long table. This feast was very joyous
</p>
<p>and merry, and except that the parson would be facetious
</p>
<p>over his bottle, nothing unseemingly or immodest was
</p>
<p>said. So we stayed at table in exceeding good fellowship
</p>
<p>till the candles were lit, and then the parson, being very
</p>
<p>drunk, we made a pretext of carrying him home to break
</p>
<p>up our company and leave the happy couple to their
</p>
<p>joy.
</p>
<p>December 26. Down betimes yesterday morning to find
</p>
<p>the sky still clear, the air brisk and dry, and ample prom-
</p>
<p>ise of a fair day. To the Court, and there perceive the
</p>
<p>great ox spitted on a stout fir pole, and the fire just kind-
</p>
<p>ling; John the gardener setting up the barrels of beer, and a
</p>
<p>famous crowd of boys and beggars already standing before
</p>
<p>the gates. And there they might have stayed till their
</p>
<p>dinner was cooked, ere I had let them in, but Moll com-
</p>
<p>ing down from the house with her husband, and seeing
</p>
<p>this shivering crew, their pinched cheeks yellow and their
</p>
<p>noses blue with cold, and so famished with hunger they
</p>
<p>could scarce find strength to cry, "God bless you, merry
</p>
<p>gentlefolks!" she would have them taste at once some of
</p>
<p>that happiness with which her heart was overflowing, and
</p>
<p>so did with her own hands unbolt the gates and set them
</p>
<p>wide, bidding the halting wretches come in and warm
</p>
<p>themselves. Not content with this, she sends up to the
</p>
<p>house for loaves and gives every one a hunch of bread
</p>
<p>and a mug of ale to stay his empty stomach. And Lord,

<p>'twas a pleasure to see these poor folks' joy how they

</p>
<p>spread their hands out to the flames; how they cockered
</p>
<p>up the fire here and there to brown their ox equally, with
</p>
<p>all hands now and then to turn him on the spit; how they
</p>
<p>would set their bread to catch the dropping gravy; and
</p>
<p>how they would lift their noses to catch the savoury whiffs
</p>
<p>that came from the roasting beef.
</p>
<p>This is all very well, thinks I, but how about our geese
</p>
<p>and turkeys? will our tenants come, or shall we find that
</p>
<p>Simon hath spoilt their appetite, and so be left with
</p>
<p>nought but starved beggars for our company? However,
</p>
<p>before four o'clock an end was put to these doubts, for
</p>
<p>some in waggons, others on horse, with their wives or
</p>
<p>sweethearts on pillions behind, clasping their men tight,
</p>
<p>and the rest afoot, all came that were asked by me, and
</p>
<p>more, and pretty jolly already with ale on the road, and a
</p>
<p>great store of mistletoe amongst them for their further
</p>
<p>merriment. And what pleased me as much as anything
</p>
<p>was to find all mighty civil to Moll nearly all offering
</p>
<p>her a Christmas box of fresh eggs, honey, and such homely
</p>
<p>produce, which she received with the most pretty, winning
</p>
<p>grace, that went home to every heart, so that the hardest
</p>
<p>faces were softened with a glow of contentment and admi-
</p>
<p>ration. Then down we sat to table, Moll at one end and
</p>
<p>her husband beside her; Don Sanchez and I at t'other;
</p>
<p>and all the rest packed as close as sprats in a barrel; but
</p>
<p>every lad squeezing closer to his lass to make room for his
</p>
<p>neighbour, we found room for all and not a sour look any-
</p>
<p>where. Dear heart! what appetites they had, yet would
</p>
<p>waste nothing, but picked every one his bone properly

<p>geese), and great cheering when the puddings and flap-

</p>
<p>dragons came in all aflame, and all as merry as grigs
</p>
<p>flinging of lighted plums at each other, but most mannerly
</p>
<p>not to fling any at Moll or us. Then more shouting for
</p>
<p>joy when the bowls of wassail and posset come in, and all
</p>
<p>standing to give three times three for their new mistress
</p>
<p>and her husband. Hearing of which, the beggars without
</p>
<p>(now tired of dancing about the embers) troop up to the
</p>
<p>door and give three times three as well, and end with cry-
</p>
<p>ing joy and long life to the wedded pair. When this
</p>
<p>tumult was ended and the door shut, Mr. Godwin gave a
</p>
<p>short oration, thanking our tenants for their company and
</p>
<p>good wishes; and then he told them how his dear wife
</p>
<p>and he, wishing others to share their joy and remember
</p>
<p>this day, had resolved to forgive every tenant one-half of
</p>
<p>his quarter's rent. "And so, Mr. Hopkins," says he,
</p>
<p>addressing me, "you will think of this to-morrow."
</p>
<p>At first I was disposed to begrudge this munificence
</p>
<p>thinking of my accounts and the bills I should have to
</p>
<p>pay ere rent day came again; but on second thoughts it re-
</p>
<p>joiced me much as being a counterblast to anything Simon
</p>
<p>could do against us. For no tenant, thinks I, will be fool
</p>
<p>enough to withold payment when he may get his quittance
</p>
<p>to-morrow for half its value. And herein was I not mis-
</p>
<p>taking; for to-day every tenant hath paid with a cheerful
</p>
<p>countenance. So that this is very good business, and I
</p>
<p>am not in any way astonished to find that our subtle
</p>
<p>Spaniard was at the bottom of it, for indeed it was Don
</p>
<p>Sanchez who (knowing my fears on this head and thinking
</p>
<p>them well-grounded) suggested this act of generosity to
</p>
<p>Moll, which she, in her fulness of heart, seized on at once.

</p>
<p>December 27. Don Sanchez took leave of us this day, he
</p>
<p>setting forth for Spain to-morrow, with the hope to reach
</p>
<p>his friends there, for their great feast of the New Year.
</p>
<p>And we are all mighty sorry to lose him ; for not only hath
</p>
<p>he been a rare good friend to us, but also he is a most
</p>
<p>seemly gentleman (to keep us in countenance), and a very
</p>
<p>good staunch and reliable companion. But this comprises
</p>
<p>not all our loss, he having, as I confess, more wit in his little
</p>
<p>finger than we in all our bodies, and being ever ready with an
</p>
<p>expedient in the hour of need ; and I know not why, but I
</p>
<p>look on his going as a sign of coming evil ; nor am I greatly
</p>
<p>comforted by his telling me privily that when we want him
</p>
<p>he shall be found by a letter sent to the Albego Puerto del
</p>
<p>Sole, Toledo, in Spain. And I pray Heaven we have no
</p>
<p>occasion to write to him.
</p>
<p>To-night at supper I find Moll all cock-a-hoop with a
</p>
<p>new delight, by reason of her dear husband offering to take
</p>
<p>her to London for a month to visit the theatres and other
</p>
<p>diversions, which put me to a new quirk for fear Moll should
</p>
<p>be known by any of our former playhouse companions. But
</p>
<p>this I now perceive is a very absurd fear ; for no one in the
</p>
<p>world who had seen Moll three years ago a half-starved,
</p>
<p>long-legged, raw child could recognise her now, a beauti-
</p>
<p>ful, well-proportioned young woman in her fine clothes ; and
</p>
<p>so my mind is at ease on this head. When Moll was retired,
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin asked if I could let him have a few hundreds
</p>
<p>upon his account, and I answered very willingly he shall.

</p>
<p>must abide by a month of very dull, gloomy days.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXVII.
</p>
<p>Of the great change in Moll, and the likely explanation thereof.
</p>
<p>A WEEK before the promised month was up, Moll and her
</p>
<p>husband came back to the Court, and lest I should imagine
</p>
<p>that her pleasures had been curtailed by his caprice, she was
</p>
<p>at great pains to convince me that he had yielded to her
</p>
<p>insistence in this matter, declaring she was sick of theatres,
</p>
<p>ridottos, masquerades, and sight-seeing, and had sighed
</p>
<p>to be home ere she had been in London a week. This
</p>
<p>surprised me exceedingly, knowing how passionate fond
</p>
<p>she had ever been of the playhouse and diversions of any
</p>
<p>kind, and remembering how eager she was to go to town
</p>
<p>with her husband ; and I perceived there was more signifi-
</p>
<p>cance in the present distaste for diversion than she would
</p>
<p>have known. And I observed further (when the joy of
</p>
<p>return and ordering her household subsided) that she her-
</p>
<p>self had changed in these past three weeks, more than was
</p>
<p>to be expected in so short a time. For, though she seemed
</p>
<p>to love her husband more than ever she had loved him as
</p>
<p>her lover, and could not be happy two minutes out of his
</p>
<p>company, 'twas not that glad, joyous love of the earlier days,
</p>
<p>but a yearning, clinging passion, that made me sad to see ;
</p>
<p>for I could not look upon the strained, anxious tenderness
</p>
<p>in her young face without bethinking me of my poor sister,
</p>
<p>as she knelt praying by her babe's cot for God to spare its
</p>
<p>frail life.

</p>
<p>Yet her husband never looked more hearty and strong,
</p>
<p>and every look and word of his bespoke increasing love.
</p>
<p>The change in her was not unperceived by him, and often
</p>
<p>he would look down into her wistful, craving eyes as if he
</p>
<p>would ask of her, "What is it, love? tell me all." And she,
</p>
<p>as understanding this appeal, would answer nothing, but
</p>
<p>only shake her head, still gazing into his kind eyes as if she
</p>
<p>would have him believe she had nought to tell.
</p>
<p>These things made me very thoughtful and urgent to find
</p>
<p>some satisfactory explanation. To be sure, thinks I, mar-
</p>
<p>riage is but the beginning of a woman's real life, and so one
</p>
<p>may not reasonably expect her to be what she was as a
</p>
<p>thoughtless child. And 'tis no less natural that a young
</p>
<p>wife should love to be alone with her husband, rather than
</p>
<p>in the midst of people who must distract his thoughts from
</p>
<p>her ; as also it is right and proper she should wish to be in
</p>
<p>her own home, directing her domestic affairs and tending to
</p>
<p>her husband showing him withal she is a good and thought-
</p>
<p>ful housewife. But why these pensive tristful looks, now she
</p>
<p>hath her heart's desire? Then, finding I must seek some
</p>
<p>better explanation of her case, I bethought me she must
</p>
<p>have had a very hard, difficult task in London to conceal
</p>
<p>from one, who was now a part of herself, her knowledge
</p>
<p>of so many things it was unbefitting she should reveal.
</p>
<p>At the playhouse she must feign astonishment at all she
</p>
<p>saw, as having never visited one before, and keep con-
</p>
<p>stant guard upon herself lest some word slipped her lips
</p>
<p>to reveal her acquaintance with the players and their art.
</p>
<p>At the ridotto she must equally feign ignorance of modish
</p>
<p>dancing she whose nimble feet had tripped to every

</p>
<p>measure since she could stand alone. There was scarcely
</p>
<p>MOLL RETURNS, MUCH CHANGED. 235
</p>
<p>a subject on which she would dare to speak without deliber-
</p>
<p>ation, and she must check her old habit of singing and be
</p>
<p>silent, lest she fall by hazard to humming some known tune.
</p>
<p>Truly, under such continuous strain (which none but such
</p>
<p>a trained actress could maintain for a single day) her spirit
</p>
<p>must have wearied. And if this part was hard to play in
</p>
<p>public, where we are all, I take it, actors of some sort and
</p>
<p>on the alert to sustain the character we would have our own,
</p>
<p>how much more difficult must it be in private when we
</p>
<p>drop our disguise and lay our hearts open to those we love !
</p>
<p>And here, as it seemed to me, I did hit rightly at the true
</p>
<p>cause of her present secret distress ; for at home as abroad
</p>
<p>she must still be acting a part, weighing her words, guarding
</p>
<p>her acts for ever to be hiding of something from her dear-
</p>
<p>est friend ever denying him that confidence he appealed
</p>
<p>for ever keeping a cruel, biting bond upon the most gen-
</p>
<p>erous impulse of her heart, closing that heart when it was
</p>
<p>bursting to open to her dear mate.
</p>
<p>Soon after their return Mr. Godwin set to work paint-
</p>
<p>ing the head of a Sybil, which the Lord of Hatfield House
</p>
<p>had commanded, on the recommendation of Sir Peter Lely,
</p>
<p>taking Anne Fitch for his model, and she sitting in that
</p>
<p>room of the Court house he had prepared for his work-
</p>
<p>shop. Here he would be at it every day, as long as there
</p>
<p>was light for his purpose, Moll, near at hand, watching
</p>
<p>him, ready to chat or hold her peace, according to his incli-
</p>
<p>nation just as she had done when he was a-painting of
</p>
<p>the ceiling, only that now her regard was more intent upon
</p>
<p>him than his work, and when he turned to look at her,
</p>
<p>'twas with interchange of undisguised love in their fond eyes.

<p>made not half a dozen stitches or turned a single page in
</p>
<p>the whole day, for he was the sole occupation of her mind ;
</p>
<p>the living book, ever yielding her sweet thoughts.
</p>
<p>This persevering, patient toil on his part did at first
</p>
<p>engender in my mind suspicion that some doubting thoughts
</p>
<p>urged him to assume his independence against any accident
</p>
<p>that might befall the estate ; but now I believe 'twas noth-
</p>
<p>ing but a love of work and of his art, and that his mind
</p>
<p>was free from any taint of misgiving, as regards his wife's
</p>
<p>honesty. 'Tis likely enough, that spite her caution, many
</p>
<p>a word and sign escaped Moll, which an enemy would have
</p>
<p>quickly seized on to prove her culpable ; but we do never
</p>
<p>see the faults of those we love (or, seeing them, have ready
</p>
<p>at a moment excuse to prove them no faults at all), and
</p>
<p>at this time Mr. Godwin's heart was so full of love, there
</p>
<p>was no place for other feeling. Venom from a rose had

<p>seemed to him more possible than evil, from one so natural,

<p>sweet, and beautiful as Moll.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXVIII.
</p>
<p>Moll plays us a mad prank for the last time in her life.
</p>
<p>ABOUT once in a fortnight I contrived to go to London for
</p>
<p>a couple of days on some pretext of business, and best part
</p>
<p>of this time I spent with Dawson. And the first visit I paid
</p>
<p>him after the return of Moll and her husband, telling him
</p>
<p>of their complete happiness, Moll's increasing womanly
</p>
<p>beauty, and the prosperous aspect of our affairs (for I had
</p>
<p>that day positive assurance our seal would be obtained
</p>
<p>within a month), I concluded by asking if his mast might
</p>
<p>not now be stepped, and he be in a position to come to
</p>
<p>Chislehurst and see her as he had before.
</p>
<p>" No, Kit, thanking ye kindly," says he, after fighting it
</p>
<p>out with himself in silence a minute or two, " better not. I
</p>
<p>am getting in a manner used to this solitude, and bar two or
</p>
<p>three days a week when I feel a bit hangdog and hipped
</p>
<p>a-thinking there's not much in this world for an old fellow
</p>
<p>to live for when he's lost his child, I am pretty well content.
</p>
<p>It would only undo me. If you had a child your own
</p>
<p>flesh and blood part of your life a child that had been
</p>
<p>to you what my sweet Moll hath been to me, you would com-
</p>
<p>prehend better how I feel. To pretend indifference when
</p>
<p>you're longing to hug her to your heart, to talk of fair
</p>
<p>weather and foul when you're thinking of old times, and
</p>
<p>then to bow and scrape and go away without a single desire
</p>
<p>of your aching heart satisfied, 'tis more than a man with

</p>
<p>a spark of warmth in his soul can bear." And then he pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to give a dozen other reasons for declining the tempt-
</p>
<p>ing bait, the sum of all proving to my conviction that he
</p>
<p>was dying to see Moll, and I feared he would soon be doing
</p>
<p>by stealth that which it were much safer he should do
</p>
<p>openly.
</p>
<p>About a week after this I got a letter from him, asking me
</p>
<p>to come again as soon as I might, he having cut his hand with
</p>
<p>a chisel, " so that I cannot work my lathe, and having nothing
</p>
<p>to occupy my mind, do plague myself beyond endurance."
</p>
<p>Much concerned for my old friend, I lose no time in re-
</p>
<p>pairing to Greenwich, where I find him sitting idle before his
</p>
<p>lathe, with an arm hanging in a handkerchief, and his face
</p>
<p>very yellow ; but this, I think, was of drinking too much ale.
</p>
<p>And here he fell speedily discoursing of Moll, saying he
</p>
<p>could not sleep of nights for thinking of the pranks she
</p>
<p>used to play us, our merry vagabond life together in Spain ere
</p>
<p>we got to Elche, etc., and how he missed her now more than
</p>
<p>ever he did before. After that, as I anticipated, he came in a
</p>
<p>shuffling, roundabout way (as one ashamed to own his weak-
</p>
<p>ness) to hinting at seeing Moll by stealth, declaring he
</p>
<p>would rather see her for two minutes now and again
</p>
<p>peering through a bush, though she should never cast a
</p>
<p>glance his way, than have her treat him as if she were not
</p>
<p>his child and ceased to feel any love for him. But seeing
</p>
<p>the peril of such ways, I would by no means consent to his
</p>
<p>hanging about the Court like a thief, and told him plainly
</p>
<p>that unless he would undo us all and ruin Moll, he must
</p>
<p>come openly as before or not at all.
</p>
<p>Without further demur he consents to be guided by me,

</p>
<p>and then, very eagerly, asks when it will be proper for him
</p>
<p>A FORESHADOWING. 239
</p>
<p>to come ; and we agree that if he come in a week's time,
</p>
<p>there will be no thought in anybody's mind of our having
</p>
<p>conspired to this end.
</p>
<p>As the fates would have it, Mr. Godwin finished his paint-
</p>
<p>ing on the Saturday following (the most wonderful piece of
</p>
<p>its kind I ever saw, or any one else, in my belief) , and being
</p>
<p>justly proud of his work and anxious Sir Peter Lely should
</p>
<p>see it soon, he resolved he would carry it to Hatfield on
</p>
<p>Monday. Moll, who was prouder of her husband's piece
</p>
<p>than if it were of her own doing, was not less eager it should
</p>
<p>be seen ; yet the thought that she must lose him for four days
</p>
<p>(for this journey could not well be accomplished in less
</p>
<p>time) cast down her spirits exceedingly. 'Twas painful to
</p>
<p>see her efforts to be cheerful despite of herself. And, see-
</p>
<p>ing how incapable she was of concealing her real feeling from
</p>
<p>him whom she would cheer, she at length confessed to him
</p>
<p>her trouble. " I would have you go, and yet I'd have you
</p>
<p>stay, love," says she.
</p>
<p>" Tis but a little while we shall be parted," says he.
</p>
<p>"A little while?" says she, trembling and wringing one
</p>
<p>hand within the other. " It seems to me as if we were part-
</p>
<p>ing for ever."
</p>
<p>"Why, then," returns he, laughing, "we will not part at
</p>
<p>all. You shall come with me, chuck. What should prevent
</p>
<p>you?"
</p>
<p>She starts with joy at this, then looks at him incredulous
</p>
<p>for a moment, and so her countenance falling again, she
</p>
<p>shakes her head as thinking, I take it, that if it were advis-
</p>
<p>able she should go with him, he would have proposed it
</p>
<p>before.

<p>" No," says she, " 'twas an idle fancy, and I'll not yield to
</p>
<p>24O A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>it. I shall become a burden, rather than a helpmate, if you
</p>
<p>cannot stir from home without me. Nay," adds she, when
</p>
<p>he would override this objection, "you must not tempt
</p>
<p>me to be weak, but rather aid me to do that which I feel
</p>
<p>right."
</p>
<p>And she would not be persuaded from this resolution, but
</p>
<p>bore herself most bravely, even to the moment when she
</p>
<p>and her husband clasped each for the last time in a farewell
</p>
<p>embrace.
</p>
<p>She stood where he had left her for some moments after
</p>
<p>he was gone. Suddenly she ran a few paces with parted
</p>
<p>lips and outstretched hands, as if she would call him back ;
</p>
<p>then, as sharply she halts, clasping her hands, and so
</p>
<p>presently turns back, looking across her shoulder, with such
</p>
<p>terror in her white face, that I do think her strong imagi-
</p>
<p>nation figured some accusing spirits, threatening the end of
</p>
<p>all her joys.
</p>
<p>I followed her into the house, but there I learnt from
</p>
<p>Mrs. Butterby that her mistress was gone to her own
</p>
<p>chamber.
</p>
<p>As I was sitting in my office in the afternoon, Jack
</p>
<p>Dawson came to me in his seaman's dress, his hand still
</p>
<p>wrapped up, but his face more healthful for his long ride
</p>
<p>and cheerful thoughts.
</p>
<p>" Why, this could not have fallen out better," says I,
</p>
<p>when we had exchanged greetings ; " for Moll is all alone,
</p>
<p>and down in the dumps by reason of her husband having
</p>
<p>left her this morning on business, that will hold him absent
</p>
<p>for three or four days. We will go up presently and have
</p>
<p>supper with her."

</p>
<p>resolved I won't go there till to-morrow, for this is no hour
</p>
<p>to be a-calling on ladies, and her husband being away 'twill
</p>
<p>look as if we had ordered it of purpose. Besides, if Moll's
</p>
<p>in trouble, how am I to pretend I know nothing of the mat-
</p>
<p>ter and care less, and this Mother Butterby and a parcel of
</p>
<p>sly, observant servants about to surprise one at any moment ?
</p>
<p>Say no more 'tis useless for I won't be persuaded
</p>
<p>against my judgment."
</p>
<p>"As you will," says I.
</p>
<p>"There's another reason, if other's needed," says he,
</p>
<p>"and that's this plaguey thirst of mine, which seizes me
</p>
<p>when I'm doleful or joyful, with a force there's no resisting.
</p>
<p>And chiefly it seizes me in the later part of the day ; there-
</p>
<p>fore, I'd have you take me to the Court to-morrow morning
</p>
<p>betimes, ere it's at its worst. My throat's like any limekiln
</p>
<p>for dryness now ; so do pray, Kit, fasten the door snug, and
</p>
<p>give me a mug of ale."
</p>
<p>This ended our discussion; but, as it was necessary I
</p>
<p>should give some reason for not supping with Moll, I left
</p>
<p>Dawson with a bottle, and went up to the house to find Moll.
</p>
<p>There I learnt that she was still in her chamber, and sleep-
</p>
<p>ing, as Mrs. Butterby believed ; so I bade the good woman
</p>
<p>tell her mistress when she awoke that Captain Evans had
</p>
<p>come to spend the night with me, and he would call to
</p>
<p>pay her his devoirs the next morning.

<p>quence of events, I must depart from my train of present
</p>
<p>observation to speak from after-knowledge.
</p>
<p>I have said that when Moll started forward, as if to over-
</p>
<p>take her husband, she suddenly stopped as if confronted by
</p>
<p>some menacing spectre. And this indeed was the case ;

</p>
<p>for at that moment there appeared to her heated imag-
</p>
<p>ination (for no living soul was there) a little, bent old
</p>
<p>woman, clothed in a single white garment of Moorish
</p>
<p>fashion, and Moll knew that she was Mrs. Godwin (though
</p>
<p>seeing her now for the first time), come from Barbary to
</p>
<p>claim her own, and separate Moll from the husband she
</p>
<p>had won by fraud.
</p>
<p>She stood there (says Moll) within her gates, with raised
</p>
<p>hand and a most bitter, unforgiving look upon her wasted
</p>
<p>face, barring the way by which Moll might regain her hus-
</p>
<p>band ; and as the poor wife halted, trembling in dreadful
</p>
<p>awe, the old woman advanced with the sure foot of right
</p>
<p>and justice. What reproach she had to make, what male-
</p>
<p>diction to pronounce, Moll dared not stay to hear, but turn-
</p>
<p>ing her back fled to the house, where, gaining her chamber,
</p>
<p>she locked the door, and flung herself upon her husband's
</p>
<p>bed ; and in this last dear refuge, shutting her eyes, clasping
</p>
<p>her ears, as if by dulling her senses to escape the phantom,
</p>
<p>she lay in a convulsion of terror for the mere dread that
</p>
<p>such a thing might be.
</p>
<p>Then, at the thought that she might never again be en-
</p>
<p>folded here in her husband's arms, an agony of grief suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded her fit of maddening fear, and she wept till her
</p>
<p>mind grew calm from sheer exhaustion. And so, little by
</p>
<p>little, as her courage revived, she began to reason with her-
</p>
<p>self as how 'twas the least likely thing in the world that if
</p>
<p>Mrs. Godwin were in England, she should come to the
</p>
<p>Court unattended and in her Moorish clothes ; and then,
</p>
<p>seeing the folly of abandoning herself to a foolish fancy,
</p>
<p>she rose, washed the tears from her face, and set herself

</p>
<p>to find some occupation to distract her thoughts. And
</p>
<p>MOLL'S LAST PRANK. 243
</p>
<p>what employment is nearer to her thoughts or dearer to
</p>
<p>her heart than making things straight for her husband ; so
</p>
<p>she goes into the next room where he worked, and falls to
</p>
<p>washing his brushes, cleaning his paint-board, and putting
</p>
<p>all things in order against his return, that he may lose no
</p>
<p>time in setting to work at another picture. And at dinner
</p>
<p>time, finding her face still disfigured with her late emotions
</p>
<p>and ashamed of her late folly, she bids her maid bring a
</p>
<p>snack to her room, under the pretence that she feels unwell.
</p>
<p>This meal she eats, still working in her husband's room ; for
</p>
<p>one improvement prompting another, she finds plenty to do
</p>
<p>there : now bethinking her that the hangings of her own pri-
</p>
<p>vate room (being handsomer) will look better on these walls,
</p>
<p>whereas t'others are more fit for hers, where they are less
</p>
<p>seen ; that this corner looks naked, and will look better for
</p>
<p>her little French table standing there, with a china image
</p>
<p>atop, and so forth. Thus, then, did she devote her time till
</p>
<p>sundown, whereabouts Mrs. Butterby raps at her door to
</p>
<p>know if she will have a cup of warm caudle to comfort her,
</p>
<p>at the same time telling her that Mr. Hopkins will not sup
</p>
<p>with her, as he has Captain Evans for his guest at the lodge.
</p>
<p>And now Moll, by that natural succession of extremes
</p>
<p>which seems to be a governing law of nature (as the flow
</p>
<p>the ebb, the calm the storm, day the night, etc.), was not
</p>
<p>less elated than she had been depressed in the early part
</p>
<p>of the day, but still, I take it, in a nervous, excitable
</p>
<p>condition. And hearing her father, whom she has not seen
</p>
<p>so long, is here, a thousand mad projects enter her lively
</p>
<p>imagination. So, when Mrs. Butterby, after the refusal of
</p>
<p>her warm caudle, proposes she shall bring Madam a tray

<p>a merry thought, asks, in a feeble voice, what there is in
</p>
<p>the larder.
</p>
<p>"Why, Madam," says Mrs. Butterby, from the outside,
</p>
<p>" there's the partridges you did not eat at breakfast, there's
</p>
<p>a cold pigeon pasty and a nice fresh ham, and a lovely
</p>
<p>hasty pudding I made with my own hands, in the pot."
</p>
<p>" Bring 'em all," says Moll, in the same aching voice ;
</p>
<p>"and I'll pick what tempts me."
</p>
<p>Therewith, she silently slips the bolt back, whips on her
</p>
<p>nightgown, and whips into bed.
</p>
<p>Presently, up comes Mrs. Butterby, carrying a wax candle,
</p>
<p>followed by a couple of maids charged with all the pro-
</p>
<p>visions Moll had commanded. Having permission to enter,
</p>
<p>the good woman sets down her candle, puts on her glasses,
</p>
<p>and, coming to the bedside, says she can see very well by
</p>
<p>her poor looks, that her dear mistress has got a disorder
</p>
<p>of the biliaries on her, and prays Heaven it may not turn
</p>
<p>to something worse.
</p>
<p>" Nay," says Moll, very faintly, " I shall be well again
</p>
<p>when I am relieved of this headache, and if I can only fall
</p>
<p>asleep, as I feel disposed to, you will see me to-morrow
</p>

</p>
<p>"and so, I pray you, order that no one shall come near my

</p>
<p>the door behind them as if 'twere of gingerbread ; and no
</p>
<p>sooner are they gone than Moll, big with her mad design,
</p>
<p>nips out of bed, strips off her nightgown, and finding noth-
</p>
<p>ing more convenient for her purpose, puts the ham, pasty,
</p>
<p>and partridges in a clean pillow-slip. This done, she puts
</p>
<p>on her cloak and hood, and having with great caution set
</p>
<p>the door open and seen all safe and quiet below, she takes
</p>
<p>up her bag of victuals, blows out the candle, and as silent as
</p>
<p>any mouse makes her way to the little private staircase at
</p>
<p>the end of the stairs. And now, with less fear of encounter-
</p>
<p>ing Mrs. Godwin than Black Bogey, she feels her way down
</p>
<p>the dark, narrow staircase, reaches the lower door, unbolts
</p>
<p>it, and steps out on the path at the back of the house.
</p>
<p>There is still a faint twilight, and this enables her to find
</p>
<p>her way to the wicket gate opposite Anne Fitch's cottage.
</p>
<p>Not a soul is to be seen ; and so, with her hood drawn well
</p>
<p>over her head, she speeds on, and in five minutes reaches
</p>
<p>my house. Here finding the door fastened, she gives a
</p>
<p>couple of knocks, and on my opening she asks meekly in
</p>
<p>a feigned voice, which for the life of me I should not have
</p>
<p>known for hers, if I am minded to buy a couple of par-
</p>

<p>"Let me see 'em, good woman," says I.
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," answers she, meekly, putting her pillow-slip
</p>
<p>in my hand, which perplexed me vastly by its weight and
</p>
<p>bulk.

<p>Moll shuts the door and shoots the bolt, then tripping
</p>
<p>behind me into the light she casts back her hood and flings
</p>
<p>her arms round her father's neck with a peal of joyful
</p>
<p>laughter.
</p>
<p>"What!" cries I. "Why, what can have brought you

<p>" Why, I knew you'd have nothing to give my poor old

<p>feigned voice, as she emptied the ham, pasty, and par-
</p>
<p>tridges all higgledy-piggledy out of the slip on to the table.

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXIX.
</p>
<p>Of the subtile means whereby Simon leads Mr. Godwin to doubt
</p>
<p>his wife.
</p>
<p>AGAIN must I draw upon matter of after-knowledge to
</p>
<p>show you how all things came to pass on this fatal night.
</p>
<p>When Mr. Godwin reached London, he went to Sir Peter
</p>
<p>Lely's house in Lincoln's Inn, to know if he was still at
</p>
<p>Hatfield, and there learning he was gone hence to Hamp-
</p>
<p>ton, and no one answering for certainty when he would
</p>
<p>return, Mr. Godwin, seeing that he might linger in London
</p>
<p>for days to no purpose, and bethinking him how pale and
</p>
<p>sorrowful his dear wife was when they parted, concludes to
</p>
<p>leave his picture at Sir Peter Lely's and post back to Chisle-
</p>
<p>hurst, counting to give his wife a happy surprise.
</p>
<p>About eight o'clock he reaches the Court, to find all
</p>
<p>shut and barred by the prudent housekeeper, who, on letting
</p>
<p>him in (with many exclamations of joy and wonder), falls
</p>
<p>presently to sighing and shaking her head, as she tells how
</p>
<p>her mistress has lain abed since dinner, and is sick of the
</p>
<p>biliaries.
</p>
<p>In great concern, Mr. Godwin takes the candle from
</p>
<p>Mrs. Butterby's hand, and hastes up to his wife's room.
</p>
<p>Opening the door softly, he enters, to find the bed tumbled,
</p>
<p>indeed, but empty. He calls her in a soft voice, going
</p>
<p>into the next room, and, getting no reply, nor finding her
</p>
<p>there, he calls again, more loudly, and there is no response.
</p>
<p>Then, as he stands irresolute and amazed, he hears a knock

</p>
<p>at the door below, and concluding that 'tis his wife, who
</p>
<p>has had occasion to go out, seeking fresh air for her com-
</p>
<p>fort maybe, he runs swiftly down and opens, ere a servant
</p>
<p>can answer the call. And there he is faced, not by sweet
</p>
<p>Moll, but the jaundiced, wicked old Simon, gasping and
</p>
<p>panting for breath.
</p>
<p>"Dost thee know," says he, fetching his breath at every
</p>
<p>other word, "dost thee know where the woman thy wife is?"
</p>
<p>"Where is she?" cries Mr. Godwin, in quick alarm,
</p>
<p>thinking by this fellow' s sweating haste that some accident
</p>
<p>had befallen his dear wife.
</p>
<p>"I will show thee where she is; aye, and what she is,"
</p>
<p>gasps the old man, and then, clasping his hands, he adds,
</p>
<p>"Verily, the Lord hath heard my prayers and delivered
</p>
<p>mine enemies into my hand."
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin, who had stepped aside to catch up his hat
</p>
<p>from the table, where he had flung it on entering, stopped
</p>
<p>short, hearing this fervent note of praise, and turning
</p>
<p>about, with misgivings of Simon's purpose, cries:
</p>
<p>"What are your enemies to me? "
</p>
<p>"Everything," cries Simon. "Mine enemies are thine,
</p>
<p>for as they have cheated me so have they cheated thee."
</p>
<p>"Enough of this," cries Mr. Godwin. "Tell me where
</p>
<p>my wife is, and be done with it."
</p>
<p>" I say I will show thee where she is and what she is."
</p>
<p>"Tell me where she is," cries Mr. Godwin, with passion.
</p>
<p>"That is my secret, and too precious to throw away."
</p>
<p>"I comprehend you, now," says Mr. Godwin, bethink-
</p>
<p>ing him of the fellow's greed. "You shall be paid. Tell
</p>
<p>me where she is and name your price."

</p>
<p>be secret, to catch them in this trap, and give no opening
</p>
<p>for escape. Oh, I know them; they are as serpents, that
</p>
<p>slip through a man's fingers and turn to bite. They shall
</p>
<p>not serve me so again. Promise "
</p>
<p>"Nothing. Think you I'm of your own base kind, to
</p>
<p>deal with you in treachery? You had my answer before,
</p>
<p>when you would poison my mind, rascal. But," adds he,
</p>
<p>with fury, "you shall tell me where my wife is."
</p>
<p>"I would. tear the tongue from my throat ere it should
</p>
<p>undo the work of Providence. If they escape the present
</p>
<p>vengeance of Heaven, thee shalt answer for it, not I. Yet
</p>
<p>I will give thee a clue to find this woman who hath fooled
</p>
<p>thee. Seek her where there are thieves and drunkards to
</p>
<p>mock at thy simplicity, to jeer at their easy gull, for I say
</p>
<p>again thy wife never was in Barbary, but playing the farded,

<p>wanton "
</p>
<p>The patience with which Mr. Godwin had harkened to
</p>
<p>this tirade, doubting by his passion that Simon was stark
</p>
<p>mad, gave way before this vile aspersion on his wife, and
</p>
<p>clutching the old man by the throat he flung him across the
</p>
<p>threshold and shut the door upon him.
</p>
<p>But where was his wife ? That question was still upper-
</p>
<p>most in his thoughts. His sole misgiving was that acci-
</p>
<p>dent had befallen her, and that somewhere in the house he
</p>
<p>should find her lying cold and insensible.
</p>
<p>With this terror in his mind, he ran again upstairs. On
</p>
<p>the landing he was met by Mrs. Butterby, who (prudent
</p>
<p>soul), at the first hint of misconduct on her mistress's part,
</p>
<p>had bundled the gaping servants up to their rooms.
</p>
<p>"Mercy on us, dear master!" says she. "Where can

</p>
<p>for I locked all up, as she bade me when we carried up her
</p>
<p>supper, and had the key in my pocket when you knocked.
</p>
<p>' See the house safe, ' says she, poor soul, with a voice could
</p>
<p>scarce be heared, 'and let no one disturb me, for I do
</p>
<p>feel most heavy with sleep.' "
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin passed into his wife's room and then into
</p>
<p>the next, looking about him in distraction.
</p>
<p>"Lord! here's the sweet thing's nightgown," exclaims
</p>
<p>Mrs. Butterby, from the next room, whither she had followed
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin. "But dear heart o' me, where's the ham
</p>
<p>gone?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin, entering from the next room, looked at her
</p>
<p>as doubting whether he or all the world had taken leave of
</p>
<p>their wits.
</p>
<p>"And the pigeon pasty? " added Mrs. Butterby, regarding
</p>
<p>the table laid out beside her mistress's bed.
</p>
<p>"And the cold partridge," adds she, in redoubled as-
</p>
<p>tonishment. "Why, here's nought left but my pudding,
</p>
<p>and that as cold as a stone."
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin, with the candle flaring in his hand, passed
</p>
<p>hastily by her, too wrought by fear to regard either the
</p>
<p>ludicrous or incomprehensible side of Mrs. Butterby 's
</p>
<p>consternation; and so, going down the corridor away from
</p>
<p>the stairs, he comes to the door of the little back stairs,
</p>
<p>standing wide open, and seeming to bid him descend. He
</p>
<p>goes quickly down, yet trembling with fear that he may
</p>
<p>find her at the bottom, broken by a fall; but all he dis-
</p>
<p>covers is the bolt drawn and the door ajar. As he pushes
</p>
<p>it open a gust of wind blows out the light, and here he
</p>
<p>stood in the darkness, eager to be doing, yet knowing not

</p>
<p>which way to turn or how to act.
</p>
<p>SIMON WILL BE HEARD. 25!
</p>
<p>Clearly, his wife had gone out by this door, and so far
</p>
<p>this gave support to Simon's statement that he knew where
</p>
<p>she was; and with this a flame was kindled within him
</p>
<p>that seemed to sear his very soul. If Simon spoke truth
</p>
<p>in one particular, why should he lie in others? Why had
</p>
<p>his wife refused to go with him to Hatfield? Why had she
</p>
<p>bid no one come near her room? Why had she gone forth
</p>
<p>by this secret stair, alone? Then, cursing himself for the
</p>
<p>unnamed suspicion that could thus, though but for a
</p>
<p>moment, disfigure the fair image that he worshipped, he
</p>
<p>asked himself why his wife should not be free to follow a
</p>
<p>caprice. But where was she? Ever that question surged
</p>
<p>upwards in the tumult of his thoughts. Where should he
</p>
<p>seek her? Suddenly it struck him that I might help him
</p>
<p>to find her, and acting instantly upon this hope he made his
</p>
<p>way in breathless haste to the road, and so towards my lodge.
</p>
<p>Ere he has gone a hundred yards, Simon steps out of the
</p>
<p>shadow, and stands before him like a shade in the dimness.
</p>
<p>"I crave thy pardon, Master," says he, humbly. "I
</p>
<p>spoke like a fool in my passion."
</p>
<p>" If you will have my pardon, tell me where to find my
</p>
<p>wife; if not, stand aside," answers Mr. Godwin.
</p>
<p>" Wilt thee hear me speak for two minutes if I promise
</p>
<p>to tell thee where she is and suffer thee to find her how
</p>
<p>thee willst. 'Twill save thee time."
</p>
<p>" Speak," says Mr. Godwin.
</p>
<p>"Thy wife is there," says Simon, under his breath,
</p>
<p>pointing towards my house. " She is revelling with Hop-
</p>
<p>kins and Captain Evans, men that she did tramp the

<p>country with as vagabond players, ere the Spaniard taught

<p>Simon, with eager haste. "Why do men lie? for their
</p>
<p>own profit. What profit have I in lying, when I pray thee
</p>
<p>to put my word to the proof and not take it on trust, with
</p>
<p>the certainty of punishment even if the proof be doubtful.
</p>
<p>Thee believest this woman is what she pretends to be; what
</p>
<p>does that show? your simplicity, not hers. How would
</p>
<p>women trick their husbands without such skill to blind
</p>
<p>them by a pretence of love and virtue? "
</p>
<p>"Say no more," cries Mr. Godwin, hoarsely, "or I may
</p>
<p>strangle you before you pass trial. Go your devilish way,
</p>
<p>I'll follow."
</p>
<p>" Now God be praised for this ! " cries Simon. " Softly,
</p>
<p>softly ! " adds he, creeping in the shade of the bank towards
</p>
<p>the house.
</p>
<p>But ere he has gone a dozen paces Mr. Godwin repents
</p>
<p>him again, with shame in his heart, and stopping, says:

<p>"Then thee doubtest my word no longer," whispers
</p>
<p>Simon, quickly. " 'Tis fear that makest thee halt, the
</p>
<p>fear of finding thy wife a wanton and a trickster."
</p>
<p>" No, no, by God ! "
</p>
<p>" If that be so, then art thee bound to prove her innocent,
</p>
<p>that I may not say to all the world, thee mightest have put
</p>
<p>her honour to the test and dared not choosing rather to
</p>
<p>cheat thyself and be cheated by her, than know thyself dis-
</p>
<p>honoured. If thee dost truly love this woman and believe her
</p>
<p>guiltless, then for her honour must thee put me not her
</p>
<p>to this trial."
</p>
<p>"No madman could reason like this," says Mr. Godwin.

</p>
<p>How we are discovered and utterly undone.
</p>
<p>" WHAT ! " cries Dawson, catching his daughter in his arms
</p>
<p>and hugging her to his breast, when the first shock of sur-
</p>
<p>prise was past. " My own sweet Moll come hither to
</p>
<p>warm her old father's heart?"
</p>
<p>"And my own," says she, tenderly, "which I fear hath
</p>
<p>grown a little wanting in love for ye since I have been mated.
</p>
<p>But, though my dear Dick draws so deeply from my well of
</p>
<p>affection, there is still somewhere down here " (clapping
</p>
<p>her hand upon her heart) " a source that first sprang for you
</p>
<p>and can never dry."
</p>
<p>"Aye, and 'tis a proof," says he, "your coming here
</p>
<p>where we may speak and act without restraint, though it be
</p>
<p>but for five minutes."
</p>
<p>" Five minutes ! " cries she, springing up with her natural
</p>
<p>vivacity, " why, I'll not leave you before the morning, unless
</p>
<p>you weary of me." And then with infinite relish and sly
</p>
<p>humour, she told of her device for leaving the Court without
</p>
<p>suspicion.
</p>
<p>I do confess I was at first greatly alarmed for the safe
</p>
<p>issue of this escapade ; but she assuring me 'twas a dirty
</p>
<p>night, and she had passed no one on the road, I felt a little
</p>
<p>reassured. To be sure, thinks I, Mr. Godwin by some
</p>
<p>accident may return, but finding her gone, and hearing
</p>
<p>Captain Evans keeps me to my house, he must conclude

</p>
<p>she has come hither, and think no harm of her for that
</p>
<p>neither seeing we are old friends and sobered with years,
</p>
<p>for 'tis the most natural thing in the world that, feeling
</p>
<p>lonely and dejected for the loss of her husband, she should
</p>
<p>seek such harmless diversion as may be had in our society.
</p>
<p>However, for the sake of appearances I thought it would
</p>
<p>be wise to get this provision of ham and birds out of sight,
</p>
<p>for fear of misadventure, and also I took instant precaution
</p>
<p>to turn the key in my street door. Being but two men, and
</p>
<p>neither of us over-nice in the formalities, I had set a cheese,
</p>
<p>a loaf, and a bottle betwixt us on the bare table of my
</p>
<p>office room, for each to serve himself as he would ; but I
</p>
<p>now proposed that, having a lady in our company, we
</p>
<p>should pay more regard to the decencies by going upstairs
</p>
<p>to my parlour, and there laying a tablecloth and napkins for
</p>
<p>our repast.
</p>
<p>"Aye, certainly!" cries Moll, who had grown mighty
</p>
<p>fastidious in these particulars since she had been mistress
</p>
<p>of Hurst Court ; " this dirty table would spoil the best appe-
</p>
<p>tite in the world."
</p>
<p>So I carried a faggot and some apple logs upstairs, and
</p>
<p>soon had a brave fire leaping up the chimney, by which
</p>
<p>time Moll and her father, with abundant mirth, had set
</p>
<p>forth our victuals on a clean white cloth, and to each of
</p>
<p>us a clean plate, knife, and fork, most proper. Then, all
</p>
<p>things being to our hand, we sat down and made a most
</p>
<p>hearty meal of Mrs. Butterby's good cheer, and all three of
</p>
<p>us as merry as grigs, with not a shadow of misgiving.
</p>
<p>There had seemed something piteous to me in that appeal
</p>
<p>of Moll's, that she might be herself for this night ; and indeed

<p>I marvelled now how she could have so trained her natural

</p>
<p>disposition to an artificial manner, and did no longer won-
</p>
<p>der at the look of fatigue and weariness in her face on her
</p>
<p>return to London. For the old reckless, careless, daredevil
</p>
<p>spirit was still alive in her, as I could plainly see now that
</p>
<p>she abandoned herself entirely to the free sway of impulse ;
</p>
<p>the old twinkle of mirth and mischief was in her eyes ; she
</p>
<p>was no longer a fine lady, but a merry vagabond again, and
</p>
<p>when she laughed 'twas with her hands clasping her sides,
</p>
<p>her head thrown back, and all her white teeth gleaming in
</p>
<p>the light.
</p>
<p>" Now," says I, when at length our meal was finished, " I
</p>
<p>will clear the table."
</p>
<p>" Hoop ! " cries she, catching up the corners of the table-
</p>
<p>cloth, and flinging them over the fragments ; " 'tis done.
</p>
<p>Let us draw round the fire, and tell old tales. Here's a
</p>
<p>pipe, dear dad ; I love the smell of tobacco ; and you" (to
</p>
<p>me) " do fetch me a pipkin, that I may brew a good drink
</p>
<p>to keep our tongues going."
</p>
<p>About the time this drink was brewed, Simon, leading Mr.
</p>
<p>Godwin by a circuitous way, came through the garden to the
</p>
<p>back of the house, where was a door, which I had never
</p>
<p>opened for lack of a key td fit the lock. This key was now
</p>
<p>in Simon's hand, and putting it with infinite care into the
</p>
<p>hole, he softly turned it in the wards. Then, with the like
</p>
<p>precaution, he lifts the latch and gently thrusts the door
</p>
<p>open, listening at every inch to catch the sounds within.
</p>
<p>At length 'tis opened wide ; and so, turning his face to
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin, who waits behind, sick with mingled shame
</p>
<p>and creeping dread, he beckons him to follow.
</p>
<p>Above, Dawson was singing at the top of his voice, a sea-

<p>song he had learnt of a mariner at the inn he frequented at
</p>
<p>WE ARE CONFOUNDED. 257
</p>
<p>Greenwich, with a troll at the end, taken up by Moll and
</p>
<p>me. And to hear his wife's voice bearing part in this rude
</p>
<p>song, made Mr. Godwin's heart to sink within him. Under
</p>
<p>cover of this noise, Simon mounted the stairs without hesita-
</p>
<p>tion, Mr. Godwin following at his heels, in a kind of sick
</p>
<p>bewilderment. 'Twas pitch dark up there, and Simon,
</p>
<p>stretching forth his hands to know if Mr. Godwin was by,
</p>
<p>touched his hand, which was deadly cold and quivering ; for
</p>
<p>here at the door he was seized with a sweating faintness,
</p>
<p>which so sapped his vigour that he was forced to hold by
</p>
<p>the wall to save himself from falling.
</p>
<p>" Art thee ready? " asks Simon ; but he can get no answer,
</p>
<p>for Mr. Godwin's energies, quickened by a word from with-
</p>
<p>in like a jaded beast by the sting of a whip, is straining his
</p>
<p>ears to catch what is passing within. And what hears he ?
</p>
<p>The song is ended, and Dawson cries :
</p>
<p>" You han't lost your old knack of catching a tune, Moll.
</p>
<p>Come hither, wench, and sit upon my knee, for I do love ye
</p>
<p>more than ever. Give me a buss, chuck ; this fine husband
</p>
<p>of thine shall not have all thy sweetness to himself."
</p>
<p>At this moment, Simon, having lifted the latch under his
</p>
<p>thumb, pushes wide open the door, and there through the
</p>
<p>thick cloud of tobacco smoke Mr. Godwin sees the table in
</p>
<p>disorder, the white cloth flung back over the remnants of
</p>
<p>our repast and stained with a patch of liquor from an over-
</p>
<p>turned mug, a smutty pipkin set upon the board beside a
</p>
<p>dish of tobacco, and a broken pipe me sitting o' one side
</p>
<p>the hearth heavy and drowsy with too much good cheer, and
</p>
<p>on t'other side his young wife, sitting on Dawson's knee, with
</p>
<p>one arm about his neck, and he in his uncouth seaman's

<p>garb, with a pipe in one hand, the other about Moll's waist,

</p>
<p>wild beast, he springs forward and clutches at a knife that
</p>
<p>lies ready to his hand upon the board, and this cry is
</p>
<p>answered with a shriek from Moll as she starts to her
</p>
<p>feet.
</p>
<p>"Who is this drunken villain?" he cries, stretching the
</p>
<p>knife in his hand towards Dawson.
</p>
<p>And Moll, flinging herself betwixt the knife and Dawson,
</p>
<p>with fear for his life, and yet with some dignity in her voice
</p>
<p>and gesture, answers swiftly :

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXI.
</p>
<p>MoWs conscience is quickened by grief and humiliation beyond the
</p>
<p>ordinary.
</p>
<p>" STAND aside, Moll," cries Dawson, stepping to the fore,
</p>
<p>and facing Mr. Godwin. " This is my crime, and I will answer
</p>
<p>for it with my blood. Here is my breast " (tearing open his
</p>
<p>jerkin). "Strike, for I alone have done you wrong, this
</p>
<p>child of mine being but an instrument to my purpose."
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin's hand fell by his side, and the knife slipped
</p>
<p>from his fingers.
</p>
<p>" Speak," says he, thickly, after a moment of horrible
</p>
<p>silence broken only by the sound of the knife striking the
</p>
<p>floor. " If this is your daughter, if she has lied to me,
</p>
<p>what in God's name is the truth? Who are you, I ask? "
</p>
<p>"John Dawson, a player," answers he, seeing the time is
</p>
<p>past for lying.
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin makes no response, but turns his eyes upon
</p>
<p>Moll, who stands before him with bowed head and clasped
</p>
<p>hands, wrung to her innermost fibre with shame, remorse,
</p>
<p>and awful dread, and for a terrible space I heard nothing
</p>
<p>but the deep, painful breathing of this poor, overwrought man.
</p>
<p>"You are my wife," says he, at length. " Follow me,"
</p>
<p>and with that he turns about and goes from the room.
</p>
<p>Then Moll, without a look at us, without a word, her face
</p>
<p>ghastly pale and drawn with agony, with faltering steps,
</p>
<p>obeys, catching at table and chair, as she passes, for support.

<p>26O A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>Dawson made a step forward, as if he would have over-
</p>
<p>taken her ; but I withheld him, shaking my head, and
</p>
<p>himself seeing 'twas in vain, he dropped into a chair, and,
</p>
<p>spreading his arms upon the table, hides his face in them
</p>
<p>with a groan of despair.
</p>
<p>Moll totters down the dark stairs, and finds her husband
</p>
<p>standing in the doorway, his figure revealed against the
</p>
<p>patch of grey light beyond, for the moon was risen, though
</p>
<p>veiled by a thick pall of cloud. He sees, as she comes to
</p>
<p>his side, that she has neither cloak nor hood to protect her
</p>
<p>from the winter wind, and in silence he takes off his own
</p>
<p>cloak and lays it on her shoulder. At this act of mercy a
</p>
<p>ray of hope animates Moll's numbed soul, and she catches
</p>
<p>at her husband's hand to press it to her lips, yet can find
</p>
<p>never a word to express her gratitude. But his hand is cold
</p>
<p>as ice, and he draws it away from her firmly, with obvious
</p>
<p>repugnance. There was no love in this little act of giving
</p>
<p>her his cloak ; 'twas but the outcome of that chivalry in
</p>
<p>gentlemen which doth exact lenience even to an enemy.
</p>
<p>So he goes on his way, she following like a whipped dog
</p>
<p>at his heels, till they reach the Court gates, and these being
</p>
<p>fast locked, on a little further, to the wicket gate. And
</p>
<p>there, as Mr. Godwin is about to enter, there confronts him
</p>
<p>Peter, that sturdy Puritan hireling of old Simon's.
</p>
<p>" Thee canst not enter here, friend," says he, in his cant-
</p>
<p>ing voice, as he sets his foot against the gate.
</p>
<p>" Know you who I am ? " asks Mr. Godwin.
</p>
<p>" Yea, friend ; and I know who thy woman is also. I
</p>
<p>am bidden by friend Simon, the true and faithful steward of
</p>
<p>Mistress Godwin in Barbary, to defend her house and lands

<p>respect of their degree ; and, with the Lord's help," adds
</p>
<p>he, showing a stout cudgel, " that will I do, friend."
</p>
<p>" Tis true, fellow," returns Mr. Godwin. " I have no
</p>
<p>right to enter here."
</p>
<p>And then, turning about, he stands irresolute, as not
</p>
<p>knowing whither he shall go to find shelter for his wife.
</p>
<p>For very shame, he does not take her to the village inn, to
</p>
<p>be questioned by gaping servants and landlord, who, ere
</p>
<p>long, must catch the flying news of her shameful condition
</p>
<p>and overthrow. A faint light in the lattice of Anne Fitch's
</p>
<p>cottage catches his eye, and he crosses to her door, still
</p>
<p>humbly followed by poor Moll. There he finds the thumb-
</p>
<p>piece gone from the latch, to him a well-known sign that
</p>
<p>Mother Fitch has gone out a-nursing ; so, pulling the hid-
</p>
<p>den string he wots of, he lifts the latch within, and the door
</p>
<p>opens to his hand. A rush is burning in a cup of oil upon the
</p>
<p>table, casting a feeble glimmer round the empty room. He
</p>
<p>closes the door when Moll has entered, sets a chair before the
</p>
<p>hearth, and rakes the embers together to give her warmth.
</p>
<p>" Forgive me, oh, forgive me ! " cries Moll, casting herself at
</p>
<p>his feet as he turns, and clasping his knees to her stricken heart.
</p>
<p>" Forgive you ! " says he, bitterly. " Forgive you for
</p>
<p>dragging me down to the level of rogues and thieves, for
</p>
<p>making me party to this vile conspiracy of plunder. A con-
</p>
<p>spiracy that, if it bring me not beneath the lash of Justice,
</p>
<p>must blast my name and fame for ever. You know not what
</p>
<p>you ask. As well might you bid me take you back to finish
</p>
<p>the night in drunken riot with those others of our gang."
</p>
<p>" Oh, no, not now ! not now ! " cries Moll, in agony. " Do

</p>
<p>"That hope's my fear ! " says he. " I have known men
</p>
<p>who, by mere contact with depravity, have so dulled their
</p>
<p>sense of shame that they could make light of sins that once
</p>
<p>appalled them. Who knows but that one day I may forgive
</p>
<p>you, chat easily upon this villany, maybe, regret I went no
</p>
<p>further in it."
</p>
<p>" Oh, God forbid that shall be of my doing ! " cries Moll,
</p>
<p>springing to her feet. " Broken as I am, I'll not accept for-
</p>
<p>giveness on such terms. Think you I'm like those plague-
</p>
<p>stricken wretches who, of wanton wickedness, ran from their
</p>
<p>beds to infect the clean with their foul ill? Not I."
</p>
<p>"I spoke in heat," says Mr. Godwin, quickly. "I
</p>
<p>repent even now what I said."
</p>
<p>"Am I so steeped in infamy," continues she, "that I am
</p>
<p>past all cure? Think," adds she, piteously, "I am not
</p>
<p>eighteen yet. I was but a child a year ago, with no more
</p>
<p>judgment of right and wrong than a savage creature. Until
</p>
<p>I loved you, I think I scarcely knew the meaning of con-
</p>
<p>science. The knowledge came when I yearned to keep no
</p>
<p>secret from you. I do remember the first struggle to do
</p>
<p>right. 'Twas on the little bridge ; and there I balanced
</p>
<p>awhile, 'twixt cheating you and robbing myself. And then,
</p>
<p>for fear you would not marry me, I dared not own the truth.
</p>
<p>Oh, had I thought you'd only keep me for your mistress, I'd
</p>
<p>have told you I was not your cousin. Little as this is,
</p>
<p>there's surely hope in't. Is it more impossible that you,
</p>
<p>a strong man, should lift me, than that I, a weak girl,
</p>
<p>no more than that, should drag you down? "

</p>
<p>wickedness again, and worse, to win you once more."
</p>
<p>" My poor wife," says he, touched with pity ; and holding
</p>
<p>forth his arms, she goes to them and lays her cheek against
</p>
<p>his breast, and there stands crying very silently with mingled
</p>
<p>thoughts now of the room she had prepared with such
</p>
<p>delight against his return, of her little table in the corner,
</p>
<p>with the chiney image atop, and other trifles with which she
</p>
<p>had dreamed to give him pleasure all lost ! No more
</p>
<p>would she sit by his side there watching, with wonder and
</p>
<p>pride, the growth of beauty 'neath his dexterous hand ; and
</p>
<p>then she feels that 'tis compassion, not love, that hath
</p>
<p>opened his arms to her, that she hath killed his respect for
</p>
<p>her, and with it his love. And so, stifling the sobs that rise
</p>
<p>in her throat, she weeps on, till her tears trickling from her
</p>
<p>cheek fall upon his hand.
</p>
<p>The icy barrier of resentment is melted by the first warm
</p>
<p>tear, this silent testimony of her smothered grief, and
</p>
<p>bursting from the bonds of reason, he yields to the passion-
</p>
<p>ate impulse of his heart, and clasping this poor sorrowing
</p>
<p>wife to his breast, he seeks to kiss away the tears from her
</p>
<p>cheek, and soothe her with gentle words. She responds to
</p>
<p>his passion, kiss for kiss, as she clasps her hands about his
</p>
<p>head ; but still her tears flow on, for with her readier wit
</p>

</p>
<p>may chat easily upon this villany and regret we went no
</p>
<p>further in it."
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin leads her to the adjoining chamber, which
</p>
<p>had been his, and says :
</p>
<p>" Lie down, love. To-morrow we shall see things clearer,
</p>
<p>and think more reasonably."
</p>
<p>" Yes," says she, in return, " more reasonably," and with
</p>
<p>that she does his bidding ; and he returns to sit before the
</p>
<p>embers and meditate. And here he stays, striving in vain to
</p>
<p>bring the tumult of his thoughts to some coherent shape, until
</p>
<p>from sheer exhaustion he falls into a kind of lethargy of sleep.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moll, lying in the dark, had been thinking
</p>
<p>also, but (as women will at such times) with clearer per-
</p>
<p>ception, so that her ideas forming in logical sequence, and
</p>
<p>growing more clear and decisive (as an argument becomes
</p>
<p>more lively and conclusive by successful reasoning) served
</p>
<p>to stimulate her intellect and excite her activity. And the
</p>
<p>end of it was that she rose quickly from her bed and looked
</p>
<p>into the next room, where she saw her husband sitting, with
</p>
<p>his chin upon his breast and his hands folded upon his knee
</p>
<p>before the dead fire. Then wrapping his cloak about her,
</p>
<p>she steals toward the outer door ; but passing him she must
</p>
<p>needs pause at his back to staunch her tears a moment, and
</p>
<p>look down upon him for the last time. The light shines in
</p>
<p>his brown hair, and she bending down till her lips touch a
</p>
<p>stray curl, they part silently, and she breathes upon him from
</p>
<p>her very soul, a mute " Fare thee well, dear love."
</p>
<p>But she will wait no longer, fearing her courage may give
</p>
<p>way, and the next minute she is out in the night, softly

<p>CHAPTER XXXII.
</p>
<p>Plow we fought a most bloody battle with Simon, the constable, and
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p>FOR some time we spoke never a word, Dawson and I,
</p>
<p>he with his head lying on his arm, I seated in a chair with
</p>
<p>my hands hanging down by my side, quite stunned by the
</p>
<p>blow that had fallen upon us. At length, raising his head,
</p>
<p>his eyes puffed, and his face bedaubed with tears, he says :
</p>
<p>" Han't you a word of comfort, Kit, for a broken-hearted
</p>
<p>man?"
</p>
<p>I stammered a few words that had more sound than
</p>
<p>sense ; but indeed I needed consolation myself, seeing my
</p>
<p>own responsibility for bringing this misfortune upon Moll,
</p>
<p>and being most heartily ashamed of my roguery now 'twas
</p>
<p>discovered.
</p>
<p>"You don't think he'll be too hard on poor Moll, tell me
</p>
<p>that, Kit?"
</p>
<p>" Aye, he'll forgive her," says I, " sooner than us, or we
</p>
<p>ourselves."
</p>
<p>" And you don't think he'll be for ever a-casting it in her
</p>
<p>teeth that her father's a a drunken vagabond, eh?"
</p>
<p>" Nay ; I believe he is too good a man for that."
</p>
<p>"Then," says he, standing up, "I'll go and tell him the
</p>
<p>whole story, and you shall come with me to bear me out."
</p>
<p>" To-morrow will be time enough," says I, flinching from
</p>
<p>this office; "'tis late now."

</p>
<p>" No matter for that. Time enough to sleep when we've
</p>
<p>settled this business. We'll not leave poor Moll to bear all
</p>
<p>the punishment of our getting. Mr. Godwin shall know
</p>
<p>what an innocent, simple child she was when we pushed
</p>
<p>her into this knavery, and how we dared not tell her of
</p>
<p>our purpose lest she should draw back. He shall know
</p>
<p>how she was ever an obedient, docile, artless girl, yielding
</p>
<p>always to my guidance ; and you can stretch a point, Kit, to
</p>
<p>say you have ever known me for a headstrong, masterful
</p>
<p>sort of a fellow, who would take denial from none, but must
</p>
<p>have my own way in all things. I'll take all the blame on
</p>
<p>my own shoulders, as I should have done at first, but I was
</p>
<p>so staggered by this fall."
</p>
<p>" Well," says I, " if you will have it so "
</p>
<p>" I will," says he, stoutly. " And now give me a bucket
</p>
<p>of water that I may souse my head, and wear a brave look.
</p>
<p>I would have him think the worst of me that he may
</p>
<p>feel the kinder to poor Moll. And I'll make what atone-
</p>
<p>ment I can," adds he, as I led him into my bed-chamber.
</p>
<p>" If he desire it, I will promise never to see Moll again ;
</p>
<p>nay, I will offer to take the king's bounty, and go a-sailoring ;
</p>
<p>and so, betwixt sickness and the Dutch, there'll be an end
</p>
<p>of Jack Dawson in a very short space."
</p>
<p>When he had ducked his head in a bowl of water, and
</p>
<p>got our cloaks from the room below, we went to the door,
</p>
<p>and there, to my dismay, I found the lock fast and the
</p>
<p>key which I had left in its socket gone.
</p>
<p>"What's amiss, Kit?" asks Dawson, perceiving my
</p>
<p>consternation.
</p>
<p>"The key, the key !" says I, holding the candle here and

<p>there to seek it on the floor, then, giving up my search as
</p>
<p>WE ARE SHUT IN A TRAP. 267
</p>
<p>it struck me that Mr. Godwin and Moll could not have left
</p>
<p>the house had the door been locked on the inside ; " I
</p>
<p>do believe we are locked in and made prisoners," says I.
</p>
<p>" Why, sure, this is not Mr. Godwin's doing ! " cries he.
</p>
<p>" 'Tis Simon," says I, with conviction, seeing him again
</p>
<p>in my mind, standing behind Mr. Godwin, with wicked
</p>
<p>triumph in his face,
</p>
<p>" Is there no other door but this one? " asks Dawson.
</p>
<p>" There is one at the back, but I have never yet opened
</p>
<p>that, for lack of a key." And now setting one thing against
</p>
<p>another, and recalling how I had before found the door
</p>
<p>open, when I felt sure I had locked it fast, the truth ap-
</p>
<p>peared to me ; namely, that Simon had that key and did get
</p>
<p>in the back way, going out by the front on that former occa-
</p>
<p>sion in haste upon some sudden alarm.
</p>
<p>"Is there never a window we can slip through?" asks
</p>
<p>Jack.
</p>
<p>" Only those above stairs ; the lower are all barred."
</p>
<p>" A fig for his bars. Does he think we have neither hands
</p>
<p>nor wits to be hindered by this silly woman's trick? "
</p>
<p>"'Tis no silly trick. He's not the man to do an idle
</p>
<p>thing. There's mischief in this."
</p>
<p>"What mischief can he do us more than he has done?
</p>
<p>for I see his hand in our misfortune. What mischief, I say?
</p>
<p>out with it, man, for your looks betray a fear of something
</p>
<p>worse."
</p>
<p>" Faith, Jack, I dread he has gone to fetch help and will
</p>
<p>lodge us in gaol for this business."
</p>
<p>"Gaol !" cries he, in a passion of desperation. "Why,
</p>
<p>this will undo Moll for ever. Her husband can never forgive

<p>her putting such shame upon him. Rouse yourself, man,

<p>268 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>from your stupor. Get me something in the shape of a
</p>
<p>hammer, for God's sake, that we may burst our way from
</p>
<p>this accursed trap."
</p>
<p>I bethought me of an axe for splitting wood, that lay in
</p>
<p>the kitchen, and fetching it quickly, I put it in his hand.
</p>
<p>Bidding me stand aside, he let fly at the door like a mad-
</p>
<p>man. The splinters flew, but the door held good ; and
</p>
<p>when he stayed a moment to take a new grip on his axe,
</p>
<p>I heard a clamour of voices outside Simon's, higher than
</p>
<p>the rest, crying, "My new door, that cost me seven and
</p>
<p>eightpence ! "
</p>
<p>" The lock, the lock ! " says I. " Strike that off."
</p>
<p>Down came the axe, striking a spark of fire from the
</p>
<p>lock, which fell with a clatter at the next blow ; but ere we
</p>
<p>had time to open the door, Simon and his party, entering
</p>
<p>by the back door, forced us to turn for our defence. Per-
</p>
<p>ceiving Dawson armed with an axe, however, these fellows
</p>
<p>paused, and the leader, whom I recognised for the constable
</p>
<p>of our parish, carrying a staff in one hand and a lanthorn
</p>
<p>in t'other, cried to us in the king's name to surrender
</p>
<p>ourselves.
</p>
<p>"Take us, if you can," cries Dawson; "and the Lord
</p>
<p>have mercy on the first who comes within my reach ! "
</p>
<p>Deftly enough, old Simon, snatching the fellow's cap
</p>
<p>who stood next him, flings it at the candle that stands flaring
</p>
<p>on the floor, and justles the constable's lanthorn from his
</p>
<p>hand, so that in a moment we were all in darkness. Taking
</p>
<p>us at this disadvantage (for Dawson dared not lay about
</p>
<p>him with his axe, for fear of hitting me by misadventure),
</p>
<p>the rascals closed at once ; and a most bloody, desperate

<p>fight ensued. For, after the first onslaught, in which

</p>
<p>Dawson (dropping his axe, as being useless at such close
</p>
<p>quarters) and I grappled each our man, the rest, knowing
</p>
<p>not friend from foe in the obscurity, and urged on by fear,
</p>
<p>fell upon each other, this one striking out at the first he
</p>
<p>met, and that giving as good as he had taken, and so all
</p>
<p>fell a-mauling and belabouring with such lust of vengeance
</p>
<p>that presently the whole place was of an uproar with the
</p>
<p>din of cursing, howling, and hard blows. For my own lot
</p>
<p>I had old Simon to deal with, as I knew at once by the
</p>
<p>cold, greasy feel of his leathern jerkin, he being enraged
</p>
<p>to make me his prisoner for the ill I had done him.
</p>
<p>Hooking his horny fingers about my throat, he clung to
</p>
<p>me like any wildcat ; but stumbling, shortly, over two who
</p>
<p>were rolling on the floor, we went down both with a crack,
</p>
<p>and with such violence that he, being undermost, was
</p>
<p>stunned by the fall. Then, my blood boiling at this treat-
</p>
<p>ment, I got astride of him, and roasted his ribs royally, and
</p>
<p>with more force than ever I had conceived myself to be
</p>
<p>possessed of. And, growing beside myself with this passion
</p>
<p>of war, I do think I should have pounded him into a pulp,
</p>
<p>but that two other combatants, falling across me with their
</p>
<p>whole weight, knocked all the wind out of my body, op-
</p>
<p>pressing me so grievously, that 'twas as much as I could
</p>
<p>do to draw myself out of the fray, and get a gasp of breath
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>About this time the uproar began to subside, for those
</p>
<p>who had got the worst of the battle thought it advisable to
</p>
<p>sneak out of the house for safety, and those who had fared
</p>
<p>better, fearing a reverse of fortune, counted they had done
</p>
<p>enough for this bout, and so also withdrew.

<p>2/O A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>" Aye," says I, as valiantly as you please, " and ready
</p>
<p>to fight another half-dozen such rascals," but pulling the
</p>
<p>broken door open, all the same, to get out the easier, in
</p>
<p>case they returned.
</p>
<p>"Why, then, let's go," says he, "unless any is minded to
</p>
<p>have us stay."
</p>
<p>No one responding to this challenge, we made ado to
</p>
<p>find a couple of hats and cloaks for our use and sallied
</p>
<p>out.
</p>
<p>"Which way do we turn? " asks Dawson, as we come into
</p>
<p>the road.
</p>
<p>"Whither would you go, Jack? "
</p>
<p>" Why, to warn Moll of her danger, to be sure."
</p>
<p>I apprehended no danger to her, and believed her husband
</p>
<p>would defend her in any case better than we could, but
</p>
<p>Dawson would have it we should warn them, and so we
</p>
<p>turned towards the Court. And now upon examination we
</p>
<p>found we had come very well out of this fight; for save
</p>
<p>that the wound in Dawson' s hand had been opened afresh,
</p>
<p>we were neither much the worse.
</p>
<p>"But let us set our best foot foremost, Jack," says I,
</p>
<p>" for I do think we have done more mischief to-night than
</p>
<p>any we have before, and I shall not be greatly surprised if

<p>We take Moll to Greenwich ; but no great happiness for her there.
</p>
<p>IN the midst of our heroics I was greatly scared by per-
</p>
<p>ceiving a cloaked figure coming hurriedly towards us in
</p>
<p>the dim light.
</p>
<p>"'Tis another, come to succour his friends," whispers
</p>
<p>I. "Let us step into this hedge."
</p>
<p>"Too late," returns he. "Put on a bold face, 'tis only
</p>
<p>one."
</p>
<p>With a swaggering gait and looking straight before us,
</p>
<p>we had passed the figure, when a voice calls " Father ! "
</p>
<p>and there turning, we find that 'tis poor Moll in her
</p>
<p>husband's cloak.
</p>
<p>"Where is thy husband, child?" asks Dawson, as he
</p>
<p>recovers from his astonishment, taking Moll by the hand.
</p>
<p>"I have no husband, father," answers she, piteously.
</p>
<p>"Why, sure he hath not turned you out of doors? "
</p>
<p>"No, he'd not do that," says she, "were I ten times
</p>
<p>more wicked than I am."
</p>
<p>"What folly then is this?" asks her father.
</p>
<p>" 'Tis no folly. I have left him of my own free will,
</p>
<p>and shall never go back to him. For he's no more my
</p>
<p>husband than that house is mine " (pointing to the Court).

</p>
<p>gate by Peter, and how Mr. Godwin was now as poor and
</p>
<p>homeless as we. And this news throwing us into a silence
</p>
<p>with new bewilderment, she asks us simply whither we are
</p>
<p>going.
</p>
<p>"My poor Moll!" is all the answer Dawson can make,
</p>
<p>and that in a broken, trembling voice.
</p>
<p>"Tis no good to cry," says she, dashing aside he'r tears
</p>
<p>that had sprung at this word of loving sympathy, and forc-
</p>
<p>ing herself to a more cheerful tone. "Why, let us think
</p>
<p>that we are just awake from a long sleep to find ourselves
</p>
<p>no worse off than when we fell a-dreaming. Nay, not so
</p>
<p>ill," adds she, "for you have a home near London. Take
</p>
<p>me there, dear."
</p>
<p>"With all my heart, chuck," answers her father, eagerly.
</p>
<p>"There, at least, I can give you a shelter till your husband
</p>
<p>can offer better."
</p>
<p>She would not dispute this point (though I perceived
</p>
<p>clearly her mind was resolved fully never to claim her
</p>
<p>right to Mr. Godwin's roof), but only begged we should
</p>
<p>hasten on our way, saying she felt chilled; and in passing
</p>
<p>Mother Fitch's cottage she constrained us to silence and
</p>
<p>caution; then when we were safely past she would have
</p>
<p>us run, still feigning to be cold, but in truth (as I think)
</p>
<p>to avoid being overtaken by Mr. Godwin, fearing, maybe,
</p>
<p>that he would overrule her will. This way we sped till
</p>
<p>Moll was fain to stop with a little cry of pain, and clap-
</p>
<p>ping her hand to her heart, being fairly spent and out of
</p>
<p>breath. Then we took her betwixt us, lending her our
</p>
<p>arms for support, and falling into a more regular pace
</p>
<p>made good progress. We trudged on till we reached

</p>
<p>Moll's step faltering and she with a faint sob weighing
</p>
<p>heavily upon our arms, we stopped, as thinking her strength
</p>
<p>overtaxed, and then glancing about me I perceived we were
</p>
<p>upon that little bridge where we had overtaken Mr. Godwin
</p>
<p>and he had offered to make Moll his wife. Then I knew
</p>
<p>'twas not fatigue that weighed her down, and gauging her
</p>
<p>feelings by my own remorse, I pitied this poor wife even
</p>
<p>more than I blamed myself; for had she revealed herself
</p>
<p>to him at that time, though he might have shrunk from
</p>
<p>marriage, he must have loved her still, and so she had
</p>
<p>been spared this shame and hopeless sorrow.
</p>
<p>At Croydon we overtook a carrier on his way to London
</p>
<p>for the Saturday market, who for a couple of shillings gave
</p>
<p>us a place in his waggon with some good bundles of hay
</p>
<p>for a seat, and here was rest for our tired bodies (though
</p>
<p>little for our tormented minds) till we reached Marsh End,
</p>
<p>where we were set down; and so, the ground being hard
</p>
<p>with frost, across the Marsh to Greenwich about daybreak.
</p>
<p>Having the key of his workshop with him, Dawson took us
</p>
<p>into his lodgings without disturbing the other inmates of
</p>
<p>the house (who might well have marvelled to see us enter
</p>
<p>at this hour with a woman in a man's cloak, and no cover-
</p>
<p>ing but a handkerchief to her head), and Moll taking his
</p>
<p>bed, we disposed ourselves on some shavings in his shop to
</p>
<p>get a little sleep.
</p>
<p>Dawson was already risen when I awoke, and going into
</p>
<p>his little parlour, I found him mighty busy setting the
</p>
<p>place in order, which was in a sad bachelor's pickle, to be
</p>
<p>sure all littered up with odds and ends of turning,
</p>
<p>unwashed plates, broken victuals, etc., just as he had
</p>
<p>left it.

<p>"She's asleep," says he, in a whisper. "And I'd have

<p>this room like a little palace against she comes into it, so
</p>
<p>do you lend me a hand, Kit, and make no more noise than
</p>
<p>you can help. The kitchen's through that door; carry

<p>everything in there, and what's of no use fling out of the
</p>
<p>window into the road."
</p>
<p>Setting to with a will, we got the parlour and kitchen
</p>
<p>neat and proper, plates washed, tiles wiped, pots and pans
</p>
<p>hung up, furniture furbished up, and everything in its
</p>
<p>place in no time; then leaving me to light a fire in the

<p>parlour, Dawson goes forth a-marketing, with a basket on

<p>his arm, in high glee. And truly to see the pleasure in

<p>Moll stirring in her chamber), one would have thought that
</p>
<p>this was an occasion for rejoicing rather than grief, and
</p>
<p>this was due not to want of kind feeling, but to the fond,
</p>
<p>simple nature of him, he being manly enough in some
</p>
<p>ways, but a very child in others. He did never see further
</p>
<p>than his nose (as one says), and because it gave him joy
</p>
<p>to have Moll beside him once more, he must needs think
</p>
<p>hopefully, that she will quickly recover from this reverse
</p>
<p>of fortune, and that all will come right again.
</p>
<p>Our dear Moll did nothing to damp his hopes, but
</p>
<p>played her part bravely and well to spare him the anguish
</p>
<p>of remorse that secretly wrung her own heart. She met us
</p>
<p>with a cheerful countenance, admired the neatness of the
</p>
<p>parlour, the glowing fire, ate her share of porridge, and
</p>
<p>finding the eggs cooked hard, declared she could not

<p>abide them soft. Then she would see her father work his

<p>her some cups for eggs, as being more to our present fash-
</p>
<p>ion than eating them from one's hand.
</p>
<p>"Why," says he, "there's an old bed-post in the corner
</p>
<p>that will serve me to a nicety. But first I must see our
</p>
<p>landlord and engage a room for Kit and me; for I take it,
</p>
<p>my dear, " adds he, " you will be content to stay with us here. "
</p>
<p>"Yes," answers she, "'tis a most cheerful view of the
</p>
<p>river from the windows."
</p>
<p>She tucked up her skirt and sleeves to busy herself in
</p>
<p>household matters, and when I would have relieved her of
</p>
<p>this office, she begged me to go and bear her father com-
</p>
<p>pany, saying with a piteous look in her eyes that we must
</p>
<p>leave her some occupation or she should weary. She was
</p>
<p>pale, there were dark lines beneath her eyes, and she was
</p>
<p>silent; but I saw no outward sign of grief till the after-
</p>
<p>noon, when, coming from Jack's shop unexpected, I spied
</p>
<p>her sitting by the window, with her face in her hands,
</p>
<p>bowed over a piece of cloth we had bought in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing, which she was about to fashion into a plain gown, as
</p>
<p>being more suitable to her condition than the rich dress in
</p>
<p>which she had left the Court.
</p>
<p>"Poor soul ! " thinks I; "here is a sad awaking from thy
</p>
<p>dream of riches and joy."
</p>
<p>Upon a seasonable occasion I told Dawson we must
</p>
<p>soon begin to think of doing something for a livelihood
</p>
<p>a matter which was as remote from his consideration as the
</p>
<p>day of wrath.
</p>
<p>"Why, Kit," says he, "I've as good as fifty pounds yet
</p>
<p>in a hole at the chimney back."
</p>
<p>"Aye, but when that's gone " says I.

</p>
<p>such a man as you for going forth to meet troubles half
</p>
<p>way. However, I warrant I shall find some jobs of car-
</p>
<p>pentry to keep us from begging our bread when the pinch
</p>
<p>comes."
</p>
<p>Not content to wait for this pinch, I resolved I would go
</p>
<p>into the city and enquire there if the booksellers could
</p>
<p>give me any employment thinking I might very well
</p>
<p>write some good sermons on honesty, now I had learnt the
</p>
<p>folly of roguery. Hearing of my purpose the morning I
</p>
<p>was about to go, Moll takes me aside and asks me in a
</p>
<p>quavering voice if I knew where Mr. Godwin might be
</p>
<p>found. This question staggered me a moment, for her
</p>
<p>husband's name had not been spoken by any of us since
</p>
<p>the catastrophe, and it came into my mind now that she
</p>
<p>designed to return to him, and I stammered out some fool-
</p>
<p>ish hint at Hurst Court.
</p>
<p>" No, he is not there," says she, " but I thought maybe
</p>
<p>that Sir Peter Lely "
</p>
<p>" Aye," says I ; " he will most likely know where Mr.
</p>
<p>Godwin may be found."
</p>
<p>" Can you tell me where Sir Peter lives? "
</p>
<p>" No ; but I can learn easily when I am in the city."
</p>
<p>" If you can, write the address and send him this," says
</p>
<p>she, drawing a letter from her breast. She had writ her hus-
</p>
<p>band's name on it, and now she pressed her lips to it twice,
</p>
<p>and putting the warm letter in my hand, she turned away,
</p>
<p>her poor mouth twitching with smothered grief. I knew
</p>
<p>then that there was no thought in her mind of seeing her
</p>
<p>husband again.
</p>
<p>I carried the letter with me to the city, wondering what

</p>
<p>few words of explanation and farewell, with some prayer,
</p>
<p>maybe, that she might be forgiven and forgotten.
</p>
<p>Learning where Sir Peter Lely lived, I myself went to his
</p>
<p>house, and he not being at home, I asked his servant if Mr.
</p>
<p>Godwin did sometimes come there.
</p>
<p>"Why, yes, sir, he was here but yesterday," answers he.
</p>
<p>" Indeed, never a day passes but he calls to ask if any one
</p>
<p>hath sought him."
</p>
<p>" In that case," says I, slipping a piece in his ready hand,
</p>
<p>and fetching out Moll's letter, " you will give him this when
</p>
<p>he comes next."
</p>
<p>" That I will, sir, and without fail. But if you would see
</p>
<p>him, sir, he bids me say he is ever at his lodging in Holborn,
</p>
<p>from five in the evening to eight in the morning."
</p>
<p>" Twill answer all ends if you give him that letter. He
</p>
<p>is in good health, I hope."
</p>
<p>"Well, sir, he is and he isn't, as you may say," answers
</p>
<p>he, dropping into a familiar, confidential tone after casting
</p>
<p>his eye over me to be sure I was no great person.. " He
</p>
<p>ails nothing, to be sure, for I hear he is ever afoot from morn
</p>
<p>till even a-searching hither and thither ; but a more down-
</p>
<p>hearted, rueful looking gentleman for his age I never see.
</p>
<p>Twixt you and me, sir, I think he hath lost his sweetheart,
</p>
<p>seeing I am charged, with Sir Peter's permission, to follow
</p>
<p>and not lose sight of any lady who may chance to call here
</p>
<p>for him."
</p>
<p>I walked back to Greenwich across the fields, debating in
</p>
<p>my mind whether I should tell Moll of her husband's dis-
</p>
<p>tress or not, so perplexed with conflicting arguments that I

</p>
<p>Moll spying me coming, from her window in the front of
</p>
<p>the house, met me at the door, in her cloak and hood, and
</p>
<p>begged I would take her a little turn over the heath.
</p>
<p>"What have you to tell me?" asks she, pressing my arm
</p>
<p>as we walked on.
</p>
<p>" I have given your letter to Sir Peter Lely's servant, who
</p>
<p>promises to deliver it faithfully to your husband."
</p>
<p>u Well," says she, after a little pause of silence, " that is
</p>
<p>not all."
</p>
<p>" You will be glad to know that he is well in health," says
</p>
<p>I, and then I stop again, all hanging in a hedge for not
</p>
<p>knowing whether it were wiser to speak or hold my tongue.
</p>
<p>" There is something else. I see it in your face. Hide
</p>
<p>nothing from me for love's sake," says she, piteously.
</p>
<p>Whereupon, my heart getting the better of my head (which,
</p>
<p>to be sure, was no great achievement), I told all as I have
</p>
<p>set it down here.
</p>
<p>" My dear, dear love ! my darling Dick ! " says she, in
</p>
<p>the end. And then she would have it told all over again,
</p>
<p>with a thousand questions, to draw forth more ; and these
</p>
<p>being exhausted, she asks why I would have concealed so
</p>
<p>much from her, and if I did fear she would seek him.
</p>
<p>" Nay, my dear," says I ; " 'tis t'other way about. For if
</p>
<p>your husband does forgive you, and yearns but to take you
</p>
<p>back into his arms, it would be an unnatural, cruel thing to
</p>
<p>keep you apart. Therefore, to confess the whole truth, I
</p>
<p>did meditate going to him and showing how we and not you
</p>
<p>are to blame in this matter, and then telling him where he
</p>
<p>might find you, if on reflection he felt that he could honestly
</p>
<p>hold you guiltless. But ere I do that (as I see now), I

</p>
<p>you are not, then are our wounds all opened afresh to no
</p>
<p>purpose, but to retard their healing."
</p>
<p>She made no reply nor any comment for a long time, nor
</p>
<p>did I seek to bias her judgment by a single word (doubting
</p>
<p>my wisdom) . But I perceived by the quivering of her arm
</p>
<p>within mine that a terrible conflict 'twixt passion and princi-
</p>
<p>ple was convulsing every fibre of her being. At the top of
</p>
<p>the hill above Greenwich she stopped, and, throwing back
</p>
<p>her hood, let the keen wind blow upon her face, as she
</p>
<p>gazed over the grey flats beyond the river. And the air
</p>
<p>seeming to give her strength and a clearer perception, she
</p>
<p>says, presently :
</p>
<p>"Accommodation ! " (And she repeats this unlucky word
</p>
<p>of mine twice or thrice, as if she liked it less each time.)
</p>
<p>" That means we shall agree to let bygones be bygones, and
</p>
<p>do our best to get along together for the rest of our lives as
</p>
<p>easily as we may."
</p>
<p>"That's it, my dear," says I, cheerfully.
</p>
<p>"Hush up the past," continues she, in the same calculat-
</p>
<p>ing tone ; " conceal it from the world, if possible. Invent
</p>
<p>some new lie to deceive the curious, and hoodwink our
</p>
<p>decent friends. Chuckle at our success, and come in time "
</p>
<p>(here she paused a moment) "to 'chat so lightly of our
</p>
<p>past knavery, that we could wish we had gone farther in
</p>
<p>the business.' " Then turning about to me, she asks : " If
</p>
<p>you were writing the story of my life for a play, would you
</p>
<p>end it thus?"
</p>
<p>"My dear," says I, "a play's one thing, real life's an-
</p>
<p>other; and believe me, as far as my experience goes of real
</p>
<p>life, the less heroics there are in it the better parts are

</p>
<p>She shook her head fiercely in the wind, and, turning
</p>
<p>about with a brusque vigour, cries, "Come on. I'll have
</p>
<p>no accommodation. And yet," says she, stopping short
</p>
<p>after a couple of hasty steps, and with a fervent earnestness
</p>
<p>in her voice, "and yet, if I could wipe out this stain, if
</p>
<p>by any act I could redeem my fault, God knows, I'd do it,
</p>
<p>cost what it might, to be honoured once again by my dear

</p>
<p>ANOTHER week passed by, and then Dawson, short-
</p>
<p>sighted as he was in his selfishness, began to perceive that
</p>
<p>things were not coming all right, as he had expected.
</p>
<p>Once or twice when I went into his shop, I caught him
</p>
<p>sitting idle before his lathe, with a most woe-begone look
</p>
<p>in his face.
</p>
<p>"What's amiss, Jack?" asks I, one day when I found
</p>
<p>him thus.
</p>
<p>He looked to see that the door was shut, and then says
</p>
<p>he, gloomily:
</p>
<p>"She don't sing as she used to, Kit; she don't laugh
</p>
<p>hearty."
</p>
<p>I hunched my shoulders.
</p>
<p>"She doesn't play us any of her old pranks," continues
</p>
<p>he. "She don't say one thing and go and do t'other
</p>
<p>the next moment, as she used to do. She's too good."
</p>
<p>What could I say to one who was fond enough to think
</p>
<p>that the summer would come back at his wish and last for
</p>
<p>ever?
</p>
<p>"She's not the same, Kit," he goes on. "No, not by
</p>
<p>twenty years. One would say she is older than I am, yet
</p>
<p>she's scarce the age of woman. And I do see she gets more
</p>
<p>pale and thin each day. D'ye think she's fretting for
</p>
<p>him? "

</p>
<p>282 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>"Like enough, Jack," says I. "What would you? He's
</p>
<p>her husband, and 'tis as if he was dead to her. She can-
</p>
<p>not be a maid again. 'Tis young to be a widow, and no
</p>
<p>hope of being wife ever more."
</p>
<p>"God forgive me," says he, hanging his head.
</p>
<p>"We did it for the best," says I. "We could not foresee
</p>
<p>this."
</p>
<p>" 'Twas so natural to think we should be happy again
</p>
<p>being all together. Howsoever," adds he, straightening
</p>
<p>himself with a more manful vigour, "we will do something
</p>
<p>to chase these black dogs hence."
</p>
<p>On his lathe was the egg cup he had been turning for
</p>
<p>Moll; he snapped it off from the chuck and flung it in the
</p>
<p>litter of chips and shavings, as if 'twere the emblem of his
</p>
<p>past folly.
</p>
<p>It so happened that night that Moll could eat no supper,
</p>
<p>pleading for her excuse that she felt sick.
</p>
<p>"What is it, chuck?" says Jack, setting down his knife
</p>
<p>and drawing his chair beside Moll's.
</p>
<p>"The vapours, I think," says she, with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>"Nay," says he, slipping his arm about her waist and
</p>
<p>drawing her to him. "My Moll hath no such modish
</p>
<p>humours. 'Tis something else. I have watched ye,
</p>
<p>and do perceive you eat less and less. Tell us what
</p>
<p>ails you."
</p>
<p>"Well, dear," says she, "I do-believe 'tis idleness is the
</p>
<p>root of my disorder."
</p>
<p>"Idleness was never wont to have this effect on you."
</p>
<p>"But it does now that I am grown older. There's not
</p>
<p>enough to do. If I could find some occupation for my

</p>
<p>MOLL STRANGELY MOVED. 283
</p>
<p>"Why, that's a good thought. What say you, dear, shall
</p>
<p>we go a-play-acting again? "
</p>
<p>Moll shook her head.
</p>
<p>"To be sure," says he, scratching his jaw, "we come
</p>
<p>out of that business with no great encouragement to go fur-
</p>
<p>ther in it. But times are mended since then, and I do
</p>
<p>hear the world is more mad for diversion now than ever
</p>
<p>they were before the Plague."
</p>
<p>"No, dear," says Moll, "'tis of no use to think of that.
</p>
<p>I couldn't play now."
</p>
<p>After this we sat silent awhile, looking into the embers;
</p>
<p>then Jack, first to give expression to his thoughts, says :
</p>
<p>" I think you were never so happy in your life, Moll, as
</p>
<p>that time we were in Spain, nor can I recollect ever feeling
</p>
<p>so free from care myself, after we got out of the hands
</p>
<p>of that gentleman robber. There's a sort of infectious
</p>
<p>brightness in the sun, and the winds, blow which way they
</p>
<p>may, do chase away dull thoughts and dispose one to
</p>
<p>jollity; eh, sweetheart? Why, we met never a tattered
</p>
<p>vagabond on the road but he was halloing of ditties,
</p>
<p>and a kinder, more hospitable set of people never lived.
</p>
<p>With a couple of rials in your pocket, you feel as rich
</p>
<p>and independent as with an hundred pounds in your hand
</p>
<p>elsewhere."
</p>
<p>At this point Moll, who had hitherto listened in apathy
</p>
<p>to these eulogies, suddenly pushing back her chair, looks
</p>
<p>at us with a strange look in her eyes, and says under her
</p>
<p>breath, "Elche!"
</p>
<p>"Barcelony for my money," responds Dawson, whose
</p>
<p>memories of Elche were not so cheerful as of those parts

</p>
<p>"Elche!" repeats Moll, twining her fingers, and with a
</p>
<p>smile gleaming in her eyes.
</p>
<p>"Does it please you, chuck, to talk of these matters? "
</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" returns she, eagerly. "You know not the
</p>
<p>joy it gives me " (clapping her hand on her heart). "Talk
</p>
<p>on."
</p>
<p>Mightily pleased with himself, her father goes over our
</p>
<p>past adventures, the tricks Moll played us, as buying of
</p>
<p>her petticoat while we were hunting for her, our excel-
</p>
<p>lent entertainment in the mountain villages, our lying
</p>
<p>abed all one day, and waking at sundown to think it was
</p>
<p>daybreak, our lazy days and jovial nights, etc., at great
</p>
<p>length; and when his memory began to give out, giving
</p>
<p>me a kick of the shin, he says :
</p>
<p>"Han't you got anything to say? For a dull compan-
</p>
<p>ion there's nothing in the world to equal your man of wit
</p>
<p>and understanding "; which, as far as my observation goes,
</p>
<p>was a very true estimation on his part.
</p>
<p>But, indeed (since I pretend to no great degree of wit
</p>
<p>or understanding), I must say, as an excuse for my silence,
</p>
<p>that during his discourse I had been greatly occupied in
</p>
<p>observing Moll, and trying to discover what was passing in
</p>
<p>her mind. 'Twas clear this talk of Spain animated her
</p>
<p>spirit beyond ordinary measure, so that at one moment I
</p>
<p>conceived she did share her father's fond fancy that our
</p>
<p>lost happiness might be regained by mere change of scene,
</p>
<p>and I confess I was persuaded somewhat to this opinion by
</p>
<p>reflecting how much we owe to circumstances for our vary-
</p>
<p>ing moods, how dull, sunless days will cast a gloom upon
</p>
<p>our spirits, and how a bright, breezy day will lift them up,

<p>etc. But I presently perceived that the stream of her
</p>
<p>A NEW SCHEME. 285
</p>
<p>thoughts was divided; for though she nodded or shook her
</p>
<p>head, as occasion required, the strained, earnest expres-
</p>
<p>sion in her tightened lips and knitted brows showed that
</p>
<p>the stronger current of her ideas flowed in another and
</p>
<p>deeper channel. Maybe she only desired her father to
</p>
<p>talk that she might be left the freer to think.
</p>
<p>" 'Twas near about this time of the year that we started
</p>
<p>on our travels," said I, in response to Dawson's reminder.
</p>
<p>"Aye, I recollect 'twas mighty cold when we set sail,
</p>
<p>and the fruit trees were all bursting into bloom when we
</p>
<p>came into France. I would we were there now; eh, Moll? "
</p>
<p>"What, dear?" asks she, rousing herself at this direct
</p>
<p>question.
</p>
<p>" I say, would you be back there now, child ? "
</p>
<p>"Oh, will you take me there if I would go? "

<p>"With all my heart, dear Moll. Is there anything in
</p>
<p>the world I'd not do to make you happy? "
</p>
<p>She took his hand upon her knee, and caressing it, says :
</p>
<p>"Let us go soon, father."
</p>
<p>"What, will you be dancing of fandangos again? " asks
</p>
<p>he; and she nods for reply, though I believe her thoughts
</p>
<p>had wandered again to some other matter.
</p>
<p>" I warrant I shall fall into the step again the moment I
</p>
<p>smell garlic; but I'll rehearse it an hour to-morrow morn-
</p>
<p>ing, that we may lose no time. Will you have a short
</p>
<p>petticoat and a waist-cloth again, Moll? "
</p>
<p>She, with her elbows on her knees now, and her chin in
</p>
<p>her hands, looking into the fire, nodded.
</p>
<p>"And you, Kit," continues he, "you'll get a guitar and
</p>
<p>play tunes for us, as I take it you will keep us company

</p>
<p>"Yes, you may count on me for that," says I.
</p>
<p>"We shan't have Don Sanchez to play the tambour for
</p>
<p>us, but I wager I shall beat it as well as he; though, seeing
</p>
<p>he owes us more than we owe him, we might in reason call
</p>
<p>upon him, and "
</p>
<p>"No, no; only we three," says Moll.
</p>
<p>"Aye, three's enough, in all conscience, and seeing we
</p>
<p>know a bit of the language, we shall get on well enough
</p>
<p>without him. I do long, Moll, to see you a-flinging over
</p>
<p>my shoulder, with your clappers going, your pretty eye and
</p>
<p>cheek all aglow with pleasure, and a court full of senors
</p>
<p>and caballeros crying ' Hole" ! ' and casting their handker-
</p>
<p>chiefs at your feet."
</p>
<p>Moll fetched a long, fluttering sigh, and, turning to her
</p>
<p>father, says in an absent way: "Yes, dear; yes. When shall
</p>
<p>we go? "
</p>
<p>Then, falling to discussing particulars, Dawson, clasping
</p>
<p>his hands upon his stomach, asked with a long face if at
</p>
<p>this season we were likely to fall in with the equinoxes on
</p>
<p>our voyage, and also if we could not hit some point of
</p>
<p>Spain so as to avoid crossing the mountains of Pyranee and
</p>
<p>the possibility of falling again into the hands of brigands.
</p>
<p>To which I replied that, knowing nothing of the northern
</p>
<p>part of Spain and its people, we stood a chance of rinding
</p>
<p>a rude climate, unsuitable to travelling at this time of year,
</p>
<p>and an inhospitable reception, and that, as our object was
</p>
<p>to reach the South as quickly as possible, it would be more
</p>
<p>to our advantage to find a ship going through the straits
</p>
<p>which would carry us as far as Alicante or Valencia. And
</p>
<p>Moll supporting my argument very vigorously, Dawson gave

</p>
<p>set. But, indeed, the good fellow seemed now ready to
</p>
<p>make any sacrifice of himself so that he might see his Moll
</p>
<p>joyous again.
</p>
<p>When I entered his shop the next morning, I found him
</p>
<p>with his coat off, cutting capers, a wooden platter in his
</p>
<p>hand for a tambourine, and the sweat pouring down his
</p>
<p>face.
</p>
<p>" I am a couple of stone or so too heavy for the boleros,"
</p>
<p>gasps he, coming to a stand, " but I doubt not, by the time
</p>
<p>we land at Alicante, there'll not be an ounce too much
</p>
<p>of me."
</p>
<p>Learning that a convoy for the Levant was about to set
</p>
<p>sail with the next favourable wind from Chatham, we took
</p>
<p>horse and rode there that afternoon, and by great good
</p>
<p>luck we found the Faithful Friend, a good ship bound
</p>
<p>for Genoa in Italy, whereof Mr. Dixon, the master, having
</p>
<p>intent to enter and victual at Alicante, undertook to carry
</p>
<p>us there for ten pounds a head, so being we could get all
</p>
<p>aboard by the next evening at sundown.
</p>
<p>Here was short grace, to be sure ; but we did so despatch

<p>CHAPTER XXXV.
</p>
<p>How we lost our poor Moll, and our long search for her.
</p>
<p>WE reached Alicante the i5th March, after a long, tedious
</p>
<p>voyage. During this time I had ample opportunity for
</p>
<p>observing Moll, but with little relief to my gloomy appre-
</p>
<p>hensions. She rarely quitted her father's side, being now
</p>
<p>as sympathetic and considerate of him in his sufferings, as
</p>
<p>before she had been thoughtless and indifferent. She had
</p>
<p>ever a gentle word of encouragement for him ; she was ever
</p>
<p>kind and patient. Only once her spirit seemed to weary :
</p>
<p>that was when we had been beating about in the bay of
</p>
<p>Cadiz four days, for a favourable gale to take us through
</p>
<p>the straits. We were on deck, she and I, the sails flapping
</p>
<p>the masts idly above our heads.
</p>
<p>" Oh," says she, laying her hand on my shoulder, and her
</p>
<p>wasted cheek against my arm, " oh, that it were all ended ! "
</p>
<p>She was sweeter with me than ever she had been before ;
</p>
<p>it seemed as if the love bred in her heart by marriage
</p>
<p>must expend itself upon some one. But though this tender-
</p>
<p>ness endeared her more to me, it saddened me, and I would
</p>
<p>have had her at her tricks once more, making merry at my
</p>
<p>expense. For I began to see that our happiness comes from
</p>
<p>within and not from without, and so fell despairing that ever
</p>
<p>this poor stricken heart of hers would be healed, which set
</p>
<p>me a-repenting more sincerely than ever the mischief I had
</p>
<p>helped to do her.

<p>NOUGHT THE SAME IN SPAIN. 289
</p>
<p>Dawson also, despite his stubborn disposition to see things
</p>
<p>as he would have them, had, nevertheless, some secret per-
</p>
<p>ception of the incurable sorrow which she, with all her art,
</p>
<p>could scarce dissimulate. Yet he clung to that fond belief
</p>
<p>in a return of past happiness, as if 'twere his last hope on
</p>
<p>earth. When at last our wind sprang up, and we were cut-
</p>
<p>ting through the waters with bending masts and not a crease
</p>
<p>in the bellied sails, he came upon deck, and spreading his
</p>
<p>hands out, cries in joy :
</p>
<p>" Oh, this blessed sunlight ! There is nought in the world
</p>
<p>like it no, not the richest wine to swell one's heart
</p>
<p>with content."
</p>
<p>And then he fell again to recalling our old adventures and
</p>
<p>mirthful escapades. He gave the rascals who fetched us
</p>
<p>ashore a piece more than they demanded, hugely delighted
</p>
<p>to find they understood his Spanish and such quips as he could
</p>
<p>call to mind. Then being landed, he falls to extolling every-
</p>
<p>thing he sees and hears, calling upon Moll to justify his
</p>
<p>appreciation ; nay, he went so far as to pause in a narrow
</p>
<p>street where was a most unsavoury smell, to sniff the air and
</p>
<p>declare he could scent the oranges in bloom. And Lord ! to
</p>
<p>hear him praise the whiteness of the linen, the excellence of
</p>
<p>the meat and drink set before us at the posada, one would
</p>
<p>have said he had never before seen clean sheets or tasted
</p>
<p>decent victuals.
</p>
<p>Seeing that neither Moll nor I could work ourselves up
</p>
<p>(try as we might) to his high pitch of enthusiasm, he was
</p>
<p>ready with an excuse for us.
</p>
<p>" I perceive," says he, "you are still suffering from your
</p>
<p>voyage. Therefore, we will not quit this town before to-
</p>
<p>morrow " (otherwise I believe he would have started off

</p>
<p>on our expedition as soon as our meal was done) . " How-
</p>
<p>ever," adds he, "do you make enquiry, Kit, if you can get
</p>
<p>yourself understood, if there be ever a bull to be fought
</p>
<p>to-day or any diversion of dancing or play-acting to-night,
</p>
<p>that the time hang not too heavy on our hands."
</p>
<p>As no such entertainments were to be had (this being
</p>
<p>the season of Lent, which is observed very strictly in these
</p>
<p>parts), Dawson contented himself with taking Moll out to
</p>
<p>visit the shops, and here he speedily purchased a pair of
</p>
<p>clappers for her, a tambour for himself, and a guitar for me,
</p>
<p>though we were difficult to please, for no clappers pleased
</p>
<p>Moll as those she had first bought ; and it did seem to me
</p>
<p>that I could strike no notes out of any instrument but they
</p>
<p>had a sad, mournful tone.
</p>
<p>Then nothing would satisfy him but to go from one
</p>
<p>draper's to another, seeking a short petticoat, a waist-cloth,
</p>
<p>and a round hat to Moll's taste, which ended to his disap-
</p>
<p>pointment, for she could find none like the old.
</p>
<p>"Why, don't you like this?" he would say, holding up a
</p>
<p>gown ; " to my eyes 'tis the very spit of t'other, only fresher."
</p>
<p>And she demurring, whispers, " To-morrow, dear, to-mor-
</p>
<p>row," with plaintive entreaty for delay in her wistful eyes.
</p>
<p>Disheartened, but not yet at the end of his resources,
</p>
<p>her father at last proposed that she should take a turn
</p>
<p>through the town alone and choose for herself. "For,"
</p>
<p>says he, " I believe we do rather hinder than help you with
</p>
<p>our advice in such matters."
</p>
<p>After a moment's reflection, Moll agreed to this, and say-
</p>
<p>ing she would meet us at the posada for supper, left us, and
</p>
<p>walked briskly back the way we had come.

</p>
<p>When she was gone, Dawson had never a word to say,
</p>
<p>GREATLY PERPLEXED STILL. 2QI
</p>
<p>nor I either, for dejection, yet, had I been questioned, I
</p>
<p>could have found no better reason for my despondency than
</p>
<p>that I felt 'twas all a mistake coming here for happiness.
</p>
<p>Strolling aimlessly through the narrow back ways, we
</p>
<p>came presently to the market that stands against the port.
</p>
<p>And here, almost at the first step, Dawson catches my arm
</p>
<p>and nods towards the opposite side of the market-place.
</p>
<p>Some Moors were seated there in their white clothes, with
</p>
<p>bundles of young palm leaves, plaited up in various forms of
</p>
<p>crowns, crosses, and the like, which the people of this
</p>
<p>country do carry to church to be blessed on Palm Sunday ;
</p>
<p>and these Moors I knew came from Elche, because palms
</p>
<p>grow nowhere else in such abundance.
</p>
<p>" Yes," says I, thinking 'twas this queer merchandise he
</p>
<p>would point out, " I noticed these Moors and their ware
</p>
<p>when we passed here a little while back with Moll."
</p>
<p>" Don't you see her there now at the corner?" asks
</p>
<p>he.
</p>
<p>Then, to my surprise, I perceived Moll in very earnest
</p>
<p>conversation with two Moors, who had at first screened her
</p>
<p>from my sight.
</p>
<p>" Come away," continues he. " She left us to go back
</p>
<p>and speak to them, and would not have us know."
</p>
<p>Why should she be secret about this trifling matter, I
</p>
<p>asked myself. 'Twas quite natural that, if she recognised
</p>
<p>in these Moors some old acquaintance of Elche, she should
</p>
<p>desire to speak them.
</p>
<p>We stole away to the port, and seating ourselves upon
</p>
<p>some timber, there we looked upon the sea nigh upon half
</p>
<p>an hour without saying a word. Then turning to me,

<p>Dawson says : " Unless she speak to us upon this matter,
</p>
<p>2Q2 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>Kit, we will say nought to her. But, if she say nothing, I
</p>
<p>shall take it for a sign her heart is set upon going back to
</p>
<p>Elche, and she would have it a secret that we may not be
</p>
<p>disheartened in our other project."
</p>
<p>"That is likely enough," says I, not a little surprised by
</p>
<p>his reasoning. But love sharpens a man's wit, be it never
</p>
<p>so dull.
</p>
<p>" Nevertheless," continues he, " if she can be happier at
</p>
<p>Elche than elsewhere, then must we abandon our scheme
</p>
<p>and accept hers with a good show of content. We owe
</p>
<p>her that, Kit."
</p>
<p>" Aye, and more," says I.
</p>
<p>"Then when we meet to-morrow morning, I will offer to
</p>
<p>go there, as if 'twas a happy notion that had come to me in
</p>
<p>my sleep, and do you back me up with all the spirit you can
</p>
<p>muster."
</p>
<p>So after some further discussion we rose, and returned to
</p>
<p>our posada, where we found Moll waiting for us. She told
</p>
<p>us she had found no clothes to her liking (which was signifi-
</p>
<p>cant), and said not a word of her speaking to the Moors
</p>
<p>in the market-place, so we held our peace on these matters.
</p>
<p>We did not part till late that night, for Moll would sit up
</p>
<p>with us, confessing she felt too feverish for sleep ; and indeed
</p>
<p>this was apparent enough by her strange humour, for she
</p>
<p>kept no constant mood for five minutes together. Now, she
</p>
<p>would sit pensive, paying no heed to us, with a dreamy look
</p>
<p>in her eyes, as if her thoughts were wandering far away to
</p>
<p>her husband in England maybe ; then she would hang her
</p>
<p>head as though she dared not look him in the face even at
</p>
<p>that distance ; and anon she would recover herself with a

<p>noble exaltation, lifting her head with a fearless mien. And

</p>
<p>so presently her body drooping gradually to a reflective pos-
</p>
<p>ture, she falls dreaming again, to rouse herself suddenly at
</p>
<p>some new prompting of her spirit, and give us all her
</p>
<p>thoughts, all eagerness for two moments, all melting sweet-
</p>
<p>ness the next, with her pretty manner of clinging to her
</p>
<p>father's arm, and laying her cheek against his shoulder.
</p>
<p>And when at last we came to say good-night, she hangs
</p>
<p>about his neck as if she would fain sleep there, quitting him
</p>
<p>with a deep sigh and a passionate kiss. Also she kissed me
</p>
<p>most affectionately, but could say never a word of farewell
</p>
<p>to either of us hurrying to her chamber to weep, as I
</p>
<p>think.
</p>
<p>We knew not what to conclude from these symptoms,
</p>
<p>save that she might be sickening of some disorder ; so we
</p>
<p>to our beds, very down in the mouth and faint at heart.
</p>
<p>About six the next morning I was awoke by the door
</p>
<p>bursting suddenly open, and starting up in my bed, I see
</p>
<p>Dawson at my side, shaking in every limb, and his eyes
</p>
<p>wide with terror.
</p>
<p>" Moll's gone ! " cries he, and falls a- blubbering.
</p>
<p>" Gone ! " says I, springing out of bed. " Tis not pos-
</p>
<p>sible."
</p>
<p>" She has not lain in her bed ; and one saw her go forth
</p>
<p>last night as the doors were closing, knowing her for a for-
</p>
<p>eigner by her hood. Come with me," adds he, laying his
</p>
<p>hand on a chair for support. " 1 dare not go alone."
</p>
<p>"Aye, I'll go with ye, Jack ; but whither?"
</p>
<p>" Down to the sea," says he, hoarsely.
</p>
<p>I stopped in the midst of dressing, overcome by this fear-
</p>
<p>ful hint ; for, knowing Moll's strong nature, the thought had

</p>
<p>pever occurred to me that she might do away with herself.
</p>
<p>294 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>Yet now reflecting on her strange manner of late, especially
</p>
<p>her parting with us overnight, it seemed not so impossible
</p>
<p>neither. For here, seeing the folly of our coming hither,
</p>
<p>desponding of any happiness in the future, was the speed-
</p>
<p>iest way of ending a life that was burdensome to herself and
</p>
<p>a constant sorrow to us. Nay, with her notions of poetic
</p>
<p>justice drawn from plays, she may have regarded this as
</p>
<p>the only atonement she could make her husband ; the only
</p>
<p>means of giving him back freedom to make a happier choice
</p>
<p>in marriage. With these conclusions taking shape, I shuffled
</p>
<p>on my clothes, and then, with shaking fear, we two, hanging
</p>
<p>to each other's arms for strength, made our way through the
</p>
<p>crooked streets to the sea ; and there, seeing a group of men
</p>
<p>and women gathered at the water's edge some little distance
</p>
<p>from us, we dared not go further, conceiving 'twas a dead
</p>
<p>body they were regarding. But 'twas only a company of
</p>
<p>fishers examining their haul of fishes, as we presently per-
</p>
<p>ceived. So, somewhat cheered, we cast our eyes to the
</p>
<p>right and left, and, seeing nothing to justify our fears, ad-
</p>
<p>vanced along the mole to the very end, where it juts out
</p>
<p>into the sea, with great stones around to break the surf.
</p>
<p>Here, then, with deadly apprehensions, we peered amongst
</p>
<p>the rocks, holding our breath, clutching tight hold of one
</p>
<p>another by the hand, in terror of finding that we so eagerly
</p>
<p>searched, a hood, a woman's skirt clinging to the stones,
</p>
<p>a stiffened hand thrust up from the lapping waters. Never
</p>
<p>may I forget the sickening horror of the moment when,
</p>
<p>creeping out amidst the rocks, Dawson twitches my hand,
</p>
<p>and points down through the clear water to something lying
</p>
<p>white at the bottom. It looked for all the world like a dead

<p>face, coloured a greenish white by the water ; but presently
</p>
<p>FRUITLESS SEARCH FOR MOLL.
</p>
<p>we saw, by one end curling over in the swell of a wave, that
</p>
<p>'twas only a rag of paper.
</p>
<p>Then I persuaded Dawson to give up this horrid search,
</p>
<p>and return to our posada, when, if we found not Moll, we
</p>
<p>might more justly conclude she had gone to Elche, than put
</p>
<p>an end to her life ; and though we could learn nothing of
</p>
<p>her at our inn, more than Dawson had already told me, yet
</p>
<p>our hopes were strengthened in the probability of finding
</p>
<p>her at Elche by recollecting her earnest, secret conversation
</p>
<p>with the Moors, who might certainly have returned to Elche
</p>
<p>in the night, they preferring that time for their journey, as we
</p>
<p>knew. So, having hastily snatched a repast, whilst our land-
</p>
<p>lord was procuring mules for our use, we set off across the
</p>
<p>plain, doing our best to cheer each other on the way. But
</p>
<p>I confess one thing damped my spirits exceedingly, and that
</p>
<p>was, having no hint from Moll the night before of this project,
</p>
<p>which then must have been fully matured in her mind,
</p>
<p>nor any written word of explanation and encouragement.
</p>
<p>For, thinks I, she being no longer a giddy, heedless child,
</p>
<p>ready to play any prank without regard to the consequences,
</p>
<p>but a very considerate, remorseful woman, would not put us
</p>
<p>to this anxiety without cause. Had she resolved to go to
</p>
<p>her friends at Elche, she would, at least, have comforted us
</p>
<p>with the hope of meeting her again ; whereas, this utter
</p>
<p>silence did point to a knowledge on her part that we were
</p>
<p>sundered for ever, and that she could give us no hope, but
</p>
<p>such as we might glean from uncertainty.
</p>
<p>Arriving at Elche, we made straight for the house of the
</p>
<p>merchant, Sidi ben Ahmed, with whose family Moll had been
</p>
<p>so intimate previously. Here we were met by Sidi himself,

<p>asked us very civilly our business, though without any show
</p>
<p>of surprise at seeing us. But these Moors do pride them-
</p>
<p>selves upon a stoic behaviour at all times, and make it a
</p>
<p>point to conceal any emotion they may feel, so that men
</p>
<p>never can truly judge of their feelings.
</p>
<p>Upon explaining our circumstances as well as our small
</p>
<p>knowledge of the tongue allowed us, he makes us a gesture
</p>
<p>of his open hands, as if he would have us examine his house
</p>
<p>for ourselves, to see that she was not hid away there for any
</p>
<p>reason, and then calling his servants, he bids them seek
</p>
<p>through all the town, promising them a rich reward if they
</p>
<p>bring any tidings of Lala Mollah. And while this search was
</p>
<p>being made, he entertained us at his own table, where we
</p>
<p>recounted so much of our miserable history as we thought
</p>
<p>it advisable he should know.
</p>
<p>One by one the servants came in to tell that they had
</p>
<p>heard nothing, save that some market-men had seen and
</p>
<p>spoken with Moll at Alicante, but had not clapt eyes on
</p>
<p>her since. Not content with doing us this service, the mer-
</p>
<p>chant furnished us with fresh mules, to carry us back to
</p>
<p>Alicante, whither we were now all eagerness to return, in the
</p>
<p>hope of finding Moll at the posada. So, travelling all night,
</p>
<p>we came to our starting-place the next morning, to learn no
</p>
<p>tidings of our poor Moll.
</p>
<p>We drew some grain of comfort from this ; for, it being
</p>
<p>now the third day since the dear girl had disappeared, her
</p>
<p>body would certainly have been washed ashore, had she
</p>
<p>cast herself, as we feared, in the sea. It occurred to us
</p>
<p>that if Moll were still living, she had either returned to

<p>England, or gone to Don Sanchez at Toledo, whose wise
</p>
<p>AT OUR WITS END. 297
</p>
<p>counsels she had ever held in high respect. The former
</p>
<p>supposition seemed to me the better grounded ; for it was
</p>
<p>easy to understand how, yearning for him night and day,
</p>
<p>she should at length abandon every scruple, and throw
</p>
<p>herself at his feet, reckless of what might follow. 'Twas
</p>
<p>not inconsistent with her impulsive character, and that more
</p>
<p>reasonable view of life she had gained by experience, and
</p>
<p>the long reflections on her voyage hither. And that which
</p>
<p>supported my belief still more was that a fleet of four sail
</p>
<p>(as I learnt) had set forth for England the morning after
</p>
<p>our arrival. So now finding, on enquiry, that a carrier was
</p>
<p>to set out for Toledo that afternoon, I wrote a letter to
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez, telling him the circumstances of our loss, and
</p>
<p>begging him to let us know, as speedily as possible, if he
</p>
<p>had heard aught of Moll. And in this letter I enclosed a
</p>
<p>second, addressed to Mr. Godwin, having the same purport,
</p>
<p>which I prayed Don Sanchez to send on with all expedition,
</p>
<p>if Moll were not with him.
</p>
<p>And now, having despatched these letters, we had nothing
</p>
<p>to do but to await a reply, which, at the earliest, we could
</p>
<p>not expect to get before the end of the week Toledo
</p>
<p>being a good eighty English leagues distant.
</p>
<p>We waited in Alicante four days more, making seven in
</p>
<p>all from the day we lost Moll ; and then, the suspense and
</p>
<p>torment of inactivity becoming insupportable, we set out
</p>
<p>again for Elche, the conviction growing strong upon us,
</p>
<p>with reflection, that we had little to hope from Don Sanchez.
</p>
<p>And we resolved we would not go this time to Sidi ben Ahmed,
</p>
<p>but rather seek to take him unawares, and make enquiry
</p>
<p>by more subtle means, we having our doubts of his veracity.

<p>298 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>who do generally give you some hint of their business by
</p>
<p>shifting of their eyes this way and that, hawking, stam-
</p>
<p>mering, etc., but they will ever look you calmly and straight
</p>
<p>in the face, never at a loss for the right word, or over-anxious
</p>
<p>to convince you, so that 'twill plague a conjurer to tell if
</p>
<p>they speak truth or falsehood. And here I would remark,
</p>
<p>that in all my observations of men and manners, there is no
</p>
<p>nation in the world to equal the English, for a straight-
</p>
<p>forward, pious, horse-racing sort of people.
</p>
<p>Well, then, we went about our search in Elche with all
</p>
<p>the slyness possible, prying here and there like a couple of
</p>
<p>thieves a- robbing a hen-roost, and putting cross-questions
</p>
<p>to every simple fellow we met, the best we could with
</p>
<p>our small knowledge of their tongue, but all to no pur-
</p>
<p>pose, and so another day was wasted. We lay under the
</p>
<p>palms that night, and in the morning began our perquisi-
</p>
<p>tion afresh ; now hunting up and down the narrow lanes
</p>
<p>and alleys of the town, as we had scoured those of Alicante,
</p>
<p>in vain, until, persuaded of the uselessness of our quest, we
</p>
<p>agreed to return to Alicante, in the hope of finding there
</p>
<p>a letter from Don Sanchez. But (not to leave a single
</p>
<p>stone unturned), we settled we would call once again on
</p>
<p>Sidi ben Ahmed, and ask if he had any tidings to give us,
</p>
<p>but, openly, feeling we were no match for him at subterfuge.
</p>
<p>So, to his house we went, where we were received very gra-
</p>
<p>ciously by the old merchant, who, chiding us gently for
</p>
<p>being in the neighbourhood a whole day without giving him
</p>
<p>a call, prayed us to enter his unworthy parlour, adding that
</p>
<p>we should find there a friend who would be very pleased
</p>
<p>to see us.

<p>utter never a word (nor could Dawson either), for I ex-

<p>pected nothing less than to find this friend was our dear

<p>Moll ; and so, silent and shaking with feverish anticipation,
</p>
<p>we followed him down the tiled passage and round the
</p>
<p>inner garden of his house by the arcade, till we reached a
</p>
<p>doorway, and there, lifting aside the heavy hangings, he
</p>
<p>bade us enter. We pushed by him in rude haste, and then
</p>
<p>stopped of a sudden, in blank amazement ; for, in place of
</p>
<p>Moll, whom we fully thought to find, we discovered only
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez, sitting on some pillows gravely smoking a
</p>
<p>Moorish chibouk.
</p>
<p>"My daughter my Moll!" cries Dawson, in despair.
</p>
<p>"Where is she?"
</p>
<p>"By this time," replies Don Sanchez, rising, "your

</p>
<p>We learn what hath become of Moll ; and how she nobly atoned for

<p>our sins.
</p>
<p>" BARBARY Barbary ! " gasps Dawson, thunderstruck
</p>
<p>by this discovery. " My Moll in Barbary?"
</p>
<p>" She sailed three days ago," says the Don, laying down
</p>
<p>his pipe, and rising.
</p>
<p>Dawson regards him for a moment or two in a kind of
</p>
<p>stupor, and then his ideas taking definite shape, he cries in
</p>
<p>a fury of passion and clenching his fists :
</p>
<p>"Spanish dog ! you shall answer this. And you" (turn-
</p>
<p>ing in fury upon Sidi), " you I know your cursed traffic
</p>
<p>you've sold her to the Turk ! "
</p>
<p>Though Sidi may have failed to comprehend his words,
</p>
<p>he could not misunderstand his menacing attitude, yet he
</p>
<p>faced him with an unmoved countenance, not a muscle of
</p>
<p>his body betraying the slightest fear, his stoic calm doing
</p>
<p>more than any argument of words to overthrow Dawson's
</p>
<p>mad suspicion. But his passion unabated, Dawson turns
</p>
<p>again upon Don Sanchez, crying :
</p>
<p>" Han't you won enough by your villany, but you must
</p>
<p>rob me of my daughter? Are you not satisfied with bring-
</p>
<p>ing us to shame and ruin, but this poor girl of mine must be
</p>
<p>cast to the Turk? Speak, rascal!" adds he, advancing a
</p>
<p>step, and seeking to provoke a conflict. " Speak, if you
</p>
<p>have any reason to show why I shouldn't strangle you."

<p>STRANGE DISCOURSE OF DON SANCHEZ. 3<DI
</p>
<p>" You'll not strangle me," answers the Don, calmly, "and
</p>
<p>here's my reason if you would see it." And with that he
</p>
<p>tilts his elbow, and with a turn of the wrist displays a long
</p>
<p>knife that lay concealed under his forearm. " I know no
</p>
<p>other defence against the attack of a madman."
</p>
<p>" If I be mad," says Dawson, " and mad indeed I may
</p>
<p>be, and no wonder, why, then, put your knife to merciful
</p>
<p>use and end my misery here."
</p>
<p>" Nay, take it in your own hand," answers the Don, offer-
</p>
<p>ing the knife. " And use it as you will on yourself if you
</p>
<p>are a fool, or on me if, being not a fool, you can hold me
</p>
<p>guilty of such villany as you charged me with in your
</p>
<p>passion."
</p>
<p>Dawson looks upon the offered knife an instant with dis-
</p>
<p>traction in his eyes, and the Don (not to carry this risky
</p>
<p>business too far), taking his hesitation for refusal, claps up
</p>
<p>the blade in his waist-cloth, where it lay mighty convenient
</p>
<p>to his hand,
</p>
<p>"You are wise," says he, " for if that noble woman is to
</p>
<p>be served, 'tis not by spilling the blood of her best friends."
</p>
<p>"You, her friend ! " says Dawson.
</p>
<p>" Aye, her best friend ! " replies the other, with dignity,
</p>
<p>" for he is best who can best serve her."
</p>
<p>" Then must I be her worst," says Jack, humbly, " having
</p>
<p>no power to undo the mischief I have wrought."
</p>
<p>"Tell me, Sefior," says I, "who hath kidnapped poor
</p>
<p>Moll?"
</p>
<p>" Nobody. She went of her free will, knowing full well
</p>

<p>here. She stood in the doorway there, and saw you cross
</p>
<p>3O2 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>the garden when you first came to seek her saw you, her
</p>
<p>father, distracted with grief and fear, and she suffered you
</p>
<p>to go away. As you may know, nothing is more sacred to a
</p>
<p>Moor than the laws of hospitality, and by those laws Sidi
</p>
<p>was bound to respect the wishes of one who had claimed
</p>
<p>his protection. He could not betray her secret, but he and
</p>
<p>his family did their utmost to persuade her from her pur-
</p>
<p>pose. While you were yet in the town, they implored her to
</p>
<p>let them call you back, and she refused. Failing in their
</p>
<p>entreaties, they despatched a messenger to me ; alas ! when
</p>
<p>I arrived, she was gone. She went with a company of mer-
</p>
<p>chants bound for Alger, and all that her friends here could
</p>
<p>do was to provide her with a servant and letters, which will
</p>
<p>ensure her safe conduct to Thadviir."
</p>
<p>"But why has she gone there, Senor?" says I, having
</p>
<p>heard him in a maze. of wonderment to the end.
</p>
<p>" Cannot you guess ? Surely she must have given you
</p>
<p>some hint of her purposes, for 'twas in her mind, as I learn,
</p>
<p>when she agreed to leave England and come hither."
</p>
<p>"Nothing we know nothing," falters Dawson. " 'Tis
</p>
<p>all mystery and darkness. Only we did suppose to find
</p>
<p>happiness a-wandering about the country, dancing and
</p>
<p>idling, as we did before."
</p>
<p>"That dream was never hers," answers the Don. "She
</p>
<p>never thought to find happiness in idling pleasure. 'Tis the
</p>
<p>joy of martyrdom she's gone to find, seeking redemption in
</p>
<p>self-sacrifice."
</p>
<p>" Be more explicit, sir, I pray," says I.
</p>
<p>" In a word, then, she has gone to offer herself as a ran-
</p>
<p>som for the real Judith Godwin."

<p>We were too overwrought for great astonishment ; indeed,
</p>
<p>DAWSON EXALTED WITH GREAT PASSION. 303
</p>
<p>my chief surprise was that I had not foreseen this event in
</p>
<p>Moll's desire to return to Elche, or hit upon the truth in
</p>
<p>seeking an explanation of her disappearance. 'Twas of a
</p>
<p>piece with her natural romantic disposition and her newly
</p>
<p>awaked sense of poetic justice, for here at one stroke she
</p>
<p>makes all human atonement for her fault and ours, earn-
</p>
<p>ing her husband's forgiveness by this proof of dearest love,
</p>
<p>and winning back for ever an honoured place in his remem-
</p>
<p>brance. And I bethought me of our Lord's saying that
</p>
<p>greater love is there none than this : that one shall lay
</p>
<p>down his life for another.
</p>
<p>For some time Dawson stood silent, his arms folded upon
</p>
<p>his breast, and his head bent in meditation, his lips pressed
</p>
<p>together, and every muscle in his face contracted with pain
</p>
<p>and labouring thought. Then, raising his head and fixing
</p>
<p>his eyes on the Don, he says :
</p>
<p>" If I understand aright, my Moll hath gone to give herself
</p>
<p>up for a slave, in the place of her whose name she took."
</p>
<p>The Don assents with a grave inclination of his head, and
</p>
<p>Dawson continues :
</p>
<p>" I ask your pardon for that injustice I did you in my
</p>
<p>passion ; but now that I am cool I cannot hold you blame-
</p>
<p>less for what has befallen my poor child, and I call upon
</p>
<p>you as a man of honour to repair the wrong you've done me."
</p>
<p>Again the Don bows very gravely, and then asks what we
</p>
<p>would have him do.
</p>
<p>" I ask you," says Dawson, " as we have no means for such
</p>
<p>an expedition, to send me across the sea there to my Moll."
</p>
<p>" I cannot ensure your return," says the Don, " and I
</p>
<p>warn you that once in Barbary you may never leave it."

</p>
<p>" I do not want to return if she is there ; nay," adds he,
</p>
<p>304 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>" if I may move them to any mercy, they shall do what they
</p>
<p>will with this body of mine, so that they suffer my child to
</p>
<p>be free."
</p>
<p>The Don turns to Sidi, and tells him what Dawson has
</p>
<p>offered to do ; whereupon the Moor lays his finger across
</p>
<p>his lips, then his hand on Dawson's breast, and afterwards
</p>
<p>upon his own, with a reverence, to show his respect. And
</p>
<p>so he and the Don fall to discussing the feasibility of this
</p>
<p>project (as I discovered by picking up a word here and
</p>
<p>there) ; and, this ended, the Don turns to Dawson, and
</p>
<p>tells him there is no vessel to convey him at present, where-
</p>
<p>fore he must of force wait patiently till one comes in from
</p>
<p>Barbary.
</p>
<p>" But," says he, " we may expect one in a few days, and rest
</p>
<p>you assured that your wish shall be gratified if it be possible."
</p>
<p>We went down, Dawson and I, to the sea that afternoon ;
</p>
<p>and, sitting on the shore at that point where we had for-
</p>
<p>merly embarked aboard the Algerine galley, we scanned the
</p>
<p>waters for a sail that might be coming hither, and Dawson
</p>
<p>with the eagerness of one who looked to escape from
</p>
<p>slavery rather than one seeking it.
</p>
<p>As we sat watching the sea, he fell a-regretting he had
</p>
<p>no especial gift of nature, by which he might more readily
</p>
<p>purchase Moll's freedom of her captors.
</p>
<p>" However," says he, " if I can show 'em the use of chairs
</p>
<p>and benches, for lack of which they are now compelled, as
</p>
<p>we see, to squat on mats and benches, I may do pretty well
</p>
<p>with Turks of the better sort who can afford luxuries, and so
</p>
<p>in time gain my end."
</p>
<p>" You shall teach me this business, Jack," says I, " for at

<p>present I'm more helpless than you."
</p>
<p>DAWSON WOULD GO ALONE INTO BARBARY. 305
</p>
<p>" Kit," says he, laying hold of my hand, " let us have no
</p>
<p>misunderstanding on this matter. You go not to Barbary
</p>
<p>with me."
</p>
<p>" What ! " cries I, protesting. " You would have the
</p>
<p>heart to break from me after we have shared good and ill
</p>
<p>fortune together like two brothers all these years?"
</p>
<p>" God knows we shall part with sore hearts o' both sides,
</p>
<p>and I shall miss you sadly enough, with no Christian to
</p>
<p>speak to out there. But 'tis not of ourselves we must think
</p>
<p>now. Some one must be here to be a father to my Moll
</p>
<p>when she returns, and I'll trust Don Sanchez no farther
</p>
<p>than I can see him, for all his wisdom. So, as you love
</p>
<p>the dear girl, you will stay here, Kit, to be her watch and
</p>
<p>ward, and as you love me you will spare me any further
</p>
<p>discussion on this head. For I am resolved."
</p>
<p>I would say nothing then to contrary him, but my judg-
</p>
<p>ment and feeling both revolted against his decision. For,
</p>
<p>thinks I, if one Christian is worth but a groat to the Turk,
</p>
<p>two must be worth eightpence, therefore we together stand
</p>
<p>a better chance of buying Moll's freedom than either
</p>
<p>singly. And, for my own happiness, I would easier be a
</p>
<p>slave in Barbary with Jack than free elsewhere and friend-
</p>
<p>less. Nowhere can a man be free from toil and pain of
</p>
<p>some sort or another, and there is no such solace in the
</p>
<p>world for one's discomforts as the company of a true man.
</p>
<p>But I was not regardless of Moll's welfare when she re-
</p>
<p>turned, neither. For I argued with myself that Mr. God-
</p>
<p>win had but to know of her condition to find means of
</p>
<p>coming hither for her succour. So the next time I met
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez, I took him aside and told him of my con-
</p>
<p>cern, asking him the speediest manner of sending a letter

</p>
<p>to England (that I had enclosed in mine to the Don having
</p>
<p>missed him through his leaving Toledo before it arrived).
</p>
<p>"There is no occasion to write," says he. "For the
</p>
<p>moment I learnt your history from Sidi I sent a letter,
</p>
<p>apprising him of his wife's innocence in this business, and
</p>
<p>the noble reparation she had made for the fault of others.
</p>
<p>Also, I took the liberty to enclose a sum of money to meet
</p>
<p>his requirements, and I'll answer for it he is now on his
</p>
<p>way hither. For no man living could be dull to the
</p>
<p>charms of his wife, or bear resentment to her for an act
</p>
<p>that was prompted by love rather than avarice, and with no
</p>
<p>calculation on her part."
</p>
<p>This cheered me considerably, and did somewhat return
</p>
<p>my faith in Don Sanchez, who certainly was the most ex-
</p>
<p>traordinary gentlemanly rascal that ever lived.
</p>
<p>Day after day Dawson and I went down to the sea, and
</p>
<p>on the fifth day of our watching (after many false hopes
</p>
<p>and disappointments) we spied a ship, which we knew to be
</p>
<p>of the Algerine sort by the cross-set of its lateen sails,
</p>
<p>making it to look like some great bird with spread wings
</p>
<p>on the water, bearing down upon the shore.
</p>
<p>We watched the approach of this ship in a fever of joy
</p>
<p>and expectation, for though we dared not breathe our
</p>
<p>hopes one to another, we both thought that maybe Moll
</p>
<p>was there. And this was not impossible. For, supposing
</p>
<p>Judith was married happily, she would refuse to leave her
</p>
<p>husband, and her mother, having lived so long in that
</p>
<p>country, might not care to leave it now and quit her daugh-
</p>
<p>ter; so might they refuse their ransom and Moll be sent
</p>

<p>accident might turn to our advantage and overthrow our
</p>
<p>fears.
</p>
<p>The Algerine came nearer and nearer, until at length we
</p>
<p>could make out certain figures moving upon the deck; then
</p>
<p>Dawson, laying a trembling hand on my sleeve, asked if I
</p>
<p>did not think 'twas a woman standing in the fore part; but
</p>
<p>I couldn't truly answer yes, which vexed him.
</p>
<p>But, indeed, when the galley was close enough to drop
</p>
<p>anchor, being at some distance from the shore because of
</p>
<p>the shoals, I could not distinguish any women, and my
</p>
<p>heart sank, for I knew well that if Moll were there, she,
</p>
<p>seeing us, would have given us some signal of waving a
</p>
<p>handkerchief or the like. As soon as the anchor was cast,
</p>
<p>a boat was lowered, and being manned, drew in towards
</p>
<p>us; then, truly, we perceived a bent figure sitting idle in
</p>
<p>the stern, but even Dawson dared not venture to think it
</p>
<p>might be Moll.
</p>
<p>The boat running on a shallow, a couple of Moors stepped
</p>
<p>into the water, and lifting the figure in their arms carried
</p>
<p>it ashore to where we stood. And now we perceived 'twas
</p>
<p>a woman muffled up in the Moorish fashion, a little, wizen
</p>
<p>old creature, who, casting back her head clothes, showed
</p>
<p>us a wrinkled face, very pale and worn with care and age.
</p>
<p>Regarding us, she says in plain English:
</p>
<p>" You are my countrymen. Is one of you named Dawson ? "
</p>
<p>"My name is Dawson," says Jack.
</p>
<p>She takes his hand in hers, and holding it in hers looks
</p>
<p>in his face with great pity, and then at last, as if loath to
</p>
<p>tell the news she sees he fears to hear, she says :
</p>
<p>"I am Elizabeth Godwin."

<p>her ransom?
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXVII.
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez again proves himself the most mannerly rascal in the
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>IN silence we led Mrs. Godwin to the seat we had occu-
</p>
<p>pied, and seating ourselves we said not a word for some
</p>
<p>time. For my own part, the realisation of our loss threw
</p>
<p>my spirits into a strange apathy; 'twas as if some actual
</p>
<p>blow had stunned my senses. Yet I remember observing
</p>
<p>the Moors about their business, despatching one to
</p>
<p>Elche for a train of mules, charging a second boat with
</p>
<p>merchandise while the first returned, etc.
</p>
<p>"I can feel for you," says Mrs. Godwin at length, ad-
</p>
<p>dressing Dawson, "for I also have lost an only child."
</p>
<p>"Your daughter Judith, Madam?" says I.
</p>
<p>"She died two years ago. Yours still lives," says she,
</p>
<p>again turning to Dawson, who sat with a haggard face,
</p>
<p>rocking himself like one nursing a great pain. "And
</p>
<p>while there is life, there's hope, as one says."
</p>
<p>"Why, to be sure," says Jack, rousing himself. "This
</p>
<p>is no more, Kit, than we bargained for. Tell me, Madam,
</p>
<p>you who know that country, do you think a carpenter
</p>
<p>would be held in esteem there? I'm yet a strong man, as
</p>
<p>you see, with some good serviceable years of life before
</p>
<p>me. D'ye think they'd take me in exchange for my Moll,
</p>
<p>who is but a bit of a girl? "
</p>
<p>"She is beautiful, and beauty counts for more than
</p>
<p>strength and abilities there, poor man," says she.

</p>
<p>HOPE OF REDEEMING MOLL. 309
</p>
<p>"I'll make 'em the offer," says he, "and though they do
</p>
<p>not agree to give her freedom, they may yet suffer me to
</p>
<p>see her time and again, if I work well."
</p>
<p>"Tis strange," says she. "Your child has told me all
</p>
<p>your history. Had I learnt it from other lips, I might have
</p>
<p>set you down for rogues, destitute of heart or conscience ;
</p>
<p>yet, with this evidence before me, I must needs regard you
</p>
<p>and your dear daughter as more noble than many whose
</p>
<p>deeds are writ in gold. 'Tis a lesson to teach me faith in
</p>
<p>the goodness of God, who redeems his creatures' follies,
</p>
<p>with one touch of love. Be of good cheer, my friend,"
</p>
<p>adds she, laying her thin hand on his arm. "There is
</p>
<p>hope. I would not have accepted this ransom no, not
</p>
<p>for all your daughter's tears and entreaties without good
</p>
<p>assurance that I, in my turn, might deliver her."
</p>
<p>I asked the old gentlewoman how this might be accom-
</p>
<p>plished.
</p>
<p>"My niece," says she, dwelling on the word with a smile,
</p>
<p>as if happy in the alliance, " my niece, coming to Barbary
</p>
<p>of her free will, is not a slave like those captured in war-
</p>
<p>fare and carried there by force. She remains there as a
</p>
<p>hostage for me, and will be free to return when I send the
</p>
<p>price of my ransom."
</p>
<p>"Is that a great sum?"
</p>
<p>"Three thousand gold ducats, about one thousand
</p>
<p>pounds English."
</p>
<p>"Why, Madam," says Dawson, "we have nothing, being
</p>
<p>now reduced to our last pieces. And if you have the
</p>
<p>goodness to raise this money, Heaven only knows how long
</p>
<p>it may be ere you succeed. 'Tis a fortnight's journey, at

</p>
<p>steward, who will seek only to put obstacles in your way,
</p>
<p>so that six weeks may pass ere Moll is redeemed, and what
</p>
<p>may befall her in the meantime? "
</p>
<p>"She is safe. AH Oukadi is a good man. She has
</p>
<p>nought to fear while she is under his protection. Do not
</p>
<p>misjudge the Moors. They have many estimable quali-
</p>
<p>ties."
</p>
<p>"Yet, Madam," says I, "by your saying there is hope, I
</p>
<p>gather there must be also danger."
</p>
<p>"There is," answers she, at which Jack nods with con-
</p>
<p>viction. "A beautiful young woman is never free from
</p>
<p>danger" (Jack assents again). "There are good and bad
</p>
<p>men amongst the Moors as amongst other people."
</p>
<p>"Aye, to be sure," says Dawson.
</p>
<p>" I say she is safe under the protection of Ali Oukadi,
</p>
<p>but when the ransom is paid and she leaves Thadviir, she
</p>
<p>may stand in peril."
</p>
<p>"Why, that's natural enough," cries Dawson, "be she
</p>
<p>amongst Moors or no Moors; 'tis then she will most need
</p>
<p>a friend to serve her, and one that knows the ins and outs
</p>
<p>of the place and how to deal with these Turks must surely
</p>
<p>be better than any half-dozen fresh landed and raw to their
</p>
<p>business." Then he fell questioning Mrs. Godwin as to
</p>
<p>how Moll was lodged, the distance of Thadviir from Alger,
</p>
<p>the way to get there, and divers other particulars, which,
</p>
<p>together with his eager, cheerful vivacity, showed clearly
</p>
<p>enough that he was more firmly resolved than ever to go
</p>
<p>into Barbary and be near Moll without delay. And pres-
</p>
<p>ently, leaving me with Mrs: Godwin, he goes down to the
</p>
<p>captain of the galley, who is directing the landing of goods

<p>from the play-boat, and, with such small store of words as
</p>
<p>DON SANCHEZ NO WAY ABASHED. 311
</p>
<p>he possessed, aided by plentiful gesture, he enters into a
</p>
<p>very lively debate with him, the upshot of which was that
</p>
<p>the captain tells him he shall start the next morning at
</p>
<p>daybreak if there be but a puff of air, and agrees to carry
</p>
<p>him to Alger for a couple of pieces (upon which they clap
</p>
<p>hands), as Dawson, in high glee, informs us on his return.
</p>
<p>"And now, Kit," says he, "I must go back to Elche to
</p>
<p>borrow those same two pieces of Don Sanchez, so I pray
</p>
<p>you, Madam, excuse me."
</p>
<p>But just then the train of mules from Elche appears, and
</p>
<p>with them Sidi ben Ahmed, who, having information of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Godwin coming, brings a litter for her carriage, at
</p>
<p>the same time begging her to accept his hospitality as the
</p>
<p>true friend of her niece Moll. So we all return to Elche
</p>
<p>together, and none so downcast as I at the thought of losing
</p>
<p>my friend, and speculating on the mischances that might
</p>
<p>befall him; for I did now begin to regard him as an ill-
</p>
<p>fated man, whose best intentions brought him nothing but
</p>
<p>evil and misfortune.
</p>
<p>Being come to Elche, Don Sanchez presented himself to
</p>
<p>Mrs. Godwin with all the dignity and calm assurance in the
</p>
<p>world, and though she received him with a very cold, dis-
</p>
<p>tant demeanour, as being the deepest rascal of us all and
</p>
<p>the one most to blame, yet it ruffled him never a bit, but
</p>
<p>he carried himself as if he had never benefited himself a
</p>
<p>penny by his roguery and at her expense.
</p>
<p>On Dawson asking him for the loan of a couple of
</p>
<p>pieces and telling his project, the Don drew a very long
</p>
<p>serious face and tried his utmost to dissuade him from it,
</p>
<p>so that at first I suspected him of being loath to part with

<p>this petty sum; but herein I did him injustice, for, finding
</p>
<p>312 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>Dawson was by no means to be turned from his purpose,
</p>
<p>he handed him his purse, advising him the first thing he
</p>
<p>did on arriving at Alger to present himself to the Dey and
</p>
<p>purchase a firman, giving him protection during his stay
</p>
<p>in Barbary (which he said might be done for a few silver
</p>
<p>ducats). Then, after discussing apart with Sidi, he comes
</p>
<p>to Mrs. Godwin, and says he :
</p>
<p>" Madam, with your sanction my friend Sidi ben Ahmed
</p>
<p>will charge Mr. Dawson with a letter to Ali Oukadi, prom-
</p>
<p>ising to pay him the sum of three thousand gold ducats
</p>
<p>upon your niece being safely conducted hither within the
</p>
<p>space of three weeks."
</p>
<p>"Sefior," answers she, "I thank Sidi ben Ahmed very
</p>
<p>deeply and you also," adds she, overcoming her com-
</p>
<p>punctions, " for this offer. But unhappily, I cannot hope
</p>
<p>to have this sum of money in so short a time."
</p>
<p>"It is needless to say, Madam," returns he, with a
</p>
<p>scrape, "that in making this proposal I have considered
</p>
<p>of that difficulty; my friend has agreed to take my bond
</p>
<p>for the payment of this sum when it shall be convenient to
</p>
<p>you to discharge it."
</p>
<p>Mrs. Godwin accepted this arrangement with a profound
</p>
<p>bow, which concealed the astonishment it occasioned her.
</p>
<p>But she drew a long breath, and I perceived she cast a
</p>
<p>curious glance at all three of us, as if she were marvelling
</p>
<p>at the change that must have taken place in civilised
</p>
<p>countries since her absence, which should account for a

<p>pack of thieves was in her young days.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXVIII.
</p>
<p>ffow we hear MoWs sweet voice through the walls of her prison, and
</p>
<p>speak two words with her, though almost to our undoing.
</p>
<p>HAVING written his letter, Sidi ben Ahmed proposed
</p>
<p>that Mrs. Godwin should await the return of Moll before
</p>
<p>setting out for England, very graciously offering her the
</p>
<p>hospitality of his house meanwhile, and this offer she
</p>
<p>willingly accepted. And now, there being no reason for my
</p>
<p>staying in Elche, Dawson gladly agreed I should accom-
</p>
<p>pany him, the more so as I knew more of the Moors' lan-
</p>
<p>guage than he. Going down with us to the water side,
</p>
<p>Don Sanchez gave us some very good hints for our behav-
</p>
<p>iour in Barbary, bidding us, above everything, be very
</p>
<p>careful not to break any of the laws of that country.
</p>
<p>"For," says he, "I have seen three men hanged there for
</p>
<p>merely casting a Turk into the sea in a drunken frolic."
</p>
<p>"Be assured, I'll touch nothing but water for my drink,"
</p>
<p>says Dawson, taking this warning to his share.
</p>
<p>"Be careful," continues the Don, "to pay for all you
</p>
<p>have, and take not so much as an orange from a tree by
</p>
<p>the wayside without first laying a fleece or two on the
</p>
<p>ground. I warn you that they, though upright enough
</p>
<p>amongst themselves, are crafty and treacherous towards
</p>
<p>strangers, whom they regard as their natural enemies; and
</p>
<p>they will tempt you to break the law either by provoking
</p>
<p>a quarrel, or putting you to some unlawful practice, that

</p>
<p>outlaws for their slaves. For stealing a pullet I have seen
</p>
<p>the flesh beaten off the soles of an English sailor's feet, and
</p>
<p>he and his companions condemned to slavery for life."
</p>
<p>"I'll lay a dozen fleeces on the ground for every sour
</p>
<p>orange I may take," says Dawson. "And as for quarrel-
</p>
<p>ling, a Turk shall pull my nose before ever a curse shall
</p>
<p>pass my lips."
</p>
<p>With these and other exhortations and promises, we
</p>
<p>parted, and lying aboard that night, we set sail by daybreak
</p>
<p>the next morning, having a very fair gale off the land; and
</p>
<p>no ships in the world being better than these galleys for swift-
</p>
<p>ness, we made an excellent good passage, so that ere we
</p>
<p>conceived ourselves half over the voyage, we sighted Alger
</p>
<p>looking like nothing but a great chalk quarry for the white
</p>
<p>houses built up the side of the hill.
</p>
<p>We landed at the mole, which is a splendid construc-
</p>
<p>tion some fifteen hundred feet or thereabouts in length
</p>
<p>(with the forts), forming a beautiful terrace walk sup-
</p>
<p>ported by arches, beneath which large, splendid maga-
</p>
<p>zines, all the most handsome in the world, I think. Thence
</p>
<p>our captain led us to the Cassanabah, a huge, heavy,
</p>
<p>square, brick building, surrounded by high, massive walls
</p>
<p>and defended by a hundred pieces of ordnance, cannons,
</p>
<p>and mortars, all told. Here the Dey or Bashaw lives with
</p>
<p>his family, and below are many roomy offices for the dis-
</p>
<p>charge of business. Our captain takes us into a vast wait-
</p>
<p>ing-hall where over a hundred Moors were patiently
</p>
<p>attending an audience of the Dey's minister, and there
</p>
<p>we also might have lingered the whole day and gone away
</p>
<p>at night unsatisfied (as many of these Moors do, day after

<p>day, but that counts for nothing with these enduring

</p>
<p>people), but having a hint from our friend we found occa-
</p>
<p>sion to slip a ducat in the hand of a go-between officer,
</p>
<p>who straightway led us to his master. Our captain having
</p>
<p>presented us, with all the usual ceremonies, the grandee
</p>
<p>takes our letter from Sidi ben Ahmed, reads it, and with-
</p>
<p>out further ado signs and seals us a trader's pass for
</p>
<p>twenty-eight days, to end at sunset the day after the festi-
</p>
<p>val of Ranadal. With this paper we went off in high glee,
</p>
<p>thinking that twenty-eight hours of safe-conduct would
</p>
<p>have sufficed us. And so to an eating-house, where we
</p>
<p>treated our friendly captain to the best, and greasing his
</p>
<p>palm also for his good services, parted in mighty good
</p>
<p>humour on both sides.
</p>
<p>By this time it was getting pretty late in the day; never-
</p>
<p>theless, we burnt with such impatience to be near our dear
</p>
<p>Moll that we set forth for Thadviir, which lies upon the
</p>
<p>seacoast about seven English leagues east of Alger. But
</p>
<p>a cool, refreshing air from the sea and the great joy in
</p>
<p>our hearts made this journey seem to us the most delight-
</p>
<p>ful of our lives. And indeed, after passing through the
</p>
<p>suburbs richly planted with gardens, and crossing the
</p>
<p>river, on which are many mills, and so coming into the
</p>
<p>plain of Mettegia, there is such an abundance of sweet
</p>
<p>odours and lovely fertile views to enchant the senses, that a
</p>
<p>dull man would be inspirited to a happy, cheerful mood.
</p>
<p>'Twas close upon nine o'clock when we reached the
</p>
<p>little town, and not a soul to be seen anywhere nor a light
</p>
<p>in any window, but that troubled us not at all (having pro-
</p>
<p>vided ourselves with a good store of victuals before quit-
</p>
<p>ting Alger), for here 'tis as sweet to lie of nights in the open

</p>
<p>ever, we could not dispose ourselves to sleep before we
</p>
<p>had gone all round the town to satisfy our curiosity. At
</p>
<p>the further extremity we spied a building looking very
</p>
<p>majestic in the moonlight, with a large garden about it
</p>
<p>enclosed with high walls, and deciding that this must be
</p>
<p>the residence of Ali Oukadi, who, we had learnt, was the
</p>
<p>most important merchant of these parts, we lay. us down
</p>
<p>against the wall, and fell asleep, thinking of our dear Moll,
</p>
<p>who perchance, all unconscious, was lying within.
</p>
<p>Rising at daybreak, for Dawson was mightily uneasy unless
</p>
<p>we might be breaking the law by sleeping out-of-doors (but
</p>
<p>there is no cruel law of this sort in Barbary), we washed
</p>
<p>ourselves very properly at a neighbouring stream, made a
</p>
<p>meal of dry bread and dates, then, laying our bundles in a
</p>
<p>secret place whence we might conveniently fetch them, if
</p>
<p>Ali Oukadi insisted on entertaining us a day or two, we went
</p>
<p>into the town, and finding, upon enquiry, that this was indeed
</p>
<p>his palace, as we had surmised, bethought us what to say
</p>
<p>and how to behave the most civil possible, and so presented
</p>
<p>ourselves at his gate, stating our business.
</p>
<p>Presently, we were admitted to an outer office, and there
</p>
<p>received by a very bent, venerable old Moor, who, having
</p>
<p>greeted us with much ceremony, says, " I am Ali Oukadi.
</p>
<p>What would you have of me? "
</p>
<p>" My daughter Moll," answers Jack, in an eager, choking
</p>
<p>voice, offering his letter. The Moor regarded him keenly,
</p>
<p>and, taking the letter, sits down to study it ; and while he is
</p>
<p>at this business a young Moor enters, whose name, as we
</p>
<p>shortly learnt, was Mohand ou Mohand. He was, I take it,
</p>
<p>about twenty-five or thirty years of age, and as handsome a

<p>man of his kind as ever I saw, with wondrous soft dark eyes,
</p>
<p>ALI OUKADI WOULD PUT US OFF. 317
</p>
<p>but a cruel mouth and a most high, imperious bearing which,
</p>
<p>together with his rich clothes and jewels, betokened him a
</p>
<p>man of quality. Hearing who we were, he saluted us civilly
</p>
<p>enough ; but there was a flash of enmity in his eyes and a
</p>
<p>tightening of his lips, which liked me not at all.
</p>
<p>When the elder man had finished the letter, he hands it
</p>
<p>to the younger, and he having read it in his turn, they fall
</p>
<p>to discussing it in a low tone, and in a dialect of which not
</p>
<p>one word was intelligible to us. Finally, Ali Oukadi, rising
</p>
<p>from his cushions, says gravely, addressing Dawson :
</p>
<p>" I will write without delay to Sidi ben Ahmed in answer
</p>
<p>to his letter."
</p>
<p>" But my daughter," says Dawson, aghast, and as well as
</p>
<p>he could in the Moorish tongue. " Am I not to have her? "
</p>
<p>"My friend says nothing here/' answers the old man,
</p>
<p>regarding the letter, " nothing that would justify my giving
</p>
<p>her up to you. He says the money shall be paid upon her
</p>
<p>being brought safe to Elche."
</p>
<p>"Why, your Excellency, I and my comrade here will
</p>
<p>undertake to carry her safely there. What better guard
</p>
<p>should a daughter have than her father?"
</p>
<p>"Are you more powerful than the elements? Can you
</p>
<p>command the tempest? Have you sufficient armament to
</p>
<p>combat all the enemies that scour the seas? If any accident
</p>
<p>befall you, what is this promise of payment? Nothing."
</p>
<p>" At least, you will suffer me to make this voyage with my
</p>
<p>child."
</p>
<p>" I do not purpose to send her to Elche," returned the
</p>
<p>old man, calmly. " Tis a risk I will not undertake. I

<p>have said that when I am paid three thousand ducats, I will

</p>
<p>send her to Elche is a charge that does not touch my com-
</p>
<p>pact. This I will write and tell my friend, Sidi ben Ahmed,
</p>
<p>and upon his payment and expressed agreement I will render
</p>
<p>you your daughter. Not before."
</p>
<p>We could say nothing for a while, being so foundered by
</p>
<p>this reverse ; but at length Dawson says in a piteous voice :
</p>
<p>" At least you will suffer me to see my daughter. Think,
</p>
<p>if she were yours and you had lost her believing her a
</p>
<p>while dead "
</p>
<p>Mohand ou Mohand muttered a few words that seemed
</p>
<p>to fix the old Moor's wavering resolution.
</p>
<p>"I cannot agree to that," says he. "Your daughter is
</p>
<p>becoming reconciled to her position. To see you would
</p>
<p>open her wounds afresh to the danger of her life, maybe.
</p>
<p>Reflect," adds he, laying his hand on the letter, "if this
</p>
<p>business should come to nought, what could recompense
</p>
<p>your daughter for the disappointment of those false hopes
</p>
<p>your meeting would inspire ? It cannot be."
</p>
<p>With this he claps his hands, and a servant, entering at
</p>
<p>a nod from his master, lifts the hangings for us to go.
</p>
<p>Dawson stammered a few broken words of passionate pro-
</p>
<p>test, and then breaking down as he perceived the folly of
</p>
<p>resisting, he dropped his head and suffered me to lead him
</p>
<p>out. As I saluted the Moors in going, I caught, as I fan-
</p>
<p>cied, a gleam of triumphant gladness in the dark eyes of
</p>
<p>Mohand ou Mohand.
</p>
<p>Coming back to the place where we had hid our bun-
</p>
<p>dles, Dawson cast himself on the ground and gave vent to
</p>
<p>his passion, declaring he would see his Moll though he
</p>
<p>should tear the walls down to get at her, and other follies ;

<p>but after a time he came to his senses again so that he could

</p>
<p>reason, and then I persuaded him to have patience, and for-
</p>
<p>bear from any outburst of violence such as we had been
</p>
<p>warned against, showing him that certainly Don Sanchez,
</p>
<p>hearing of our condition, would send the money speedily,
</p>
<p>and so we should get Moll by fair means instead of losing
</p>
<p>her (and ourselves) by foul; that after all, 'twas but the
</p>
<p>delay of a week or so that we had to put up with, and so
</p>
<p>forth. Then, discussing what we should do next, I offered
</p>
<p>that we should return to Elche and make our case known
</p>
<p>rather than trust entirely to Ali Oukadi's promise of writ-
</p>
<p>ing ; for I did suspect some treacherous design on the part
</p>
<p>of Mohand ou Mohand, by which Mrs. Godwin failing of
</p>
<p>her agreement, he might possess himself of Moll ; and this
</p>
<p>falling in with Dawson's wishes, we set out to return to
</p>
<p>Alger forthwith. But getting to Alger half-dead with the
</p>
<p>fatigue of trudging all that distance in the full heat of the
</p>
<p>day, we learnt to our chagrin that no ship would be sailing
</p>
<p>to Elche for a fortnight at the least, and all the money we
</p>
<p>had would not tempt any captain to carry us there ; so here
</p>
<p>were we cast down again beyond everything for miserable,
</p>
<p>gloomy apprehensions.
</p>
<p>After spending another day in fruitless endeavour to
</p>
<p>obtain a passage, nothing would satisfy Dawson's painful,
</p>
<p>restless spirit but we must return to Thadviir ; so thither we
</p>
<p>went once more to linger about the palace of Ali Oukadi, in
</p>
<p>the poor hope that we might see Moll come out to take
</p>
<p>the air.
</p>
<p>One day as we were standing in the shade of the garden
</p>
<p>wall, sick and weary with dejection and disappointment,
</p>
<p>Dawson, of a sudden, starts me from my lethargy by clutch-

<p>ing my arm and raising his finger to bid me listen and be

</p>
<p>silent. Then straining my ear, I caught the distant sound
</p>
<p>of female voices, but I could distinguish not one from
</p>
<p>another, though by Dawson's joyous, eager look I perceived
</p>
<p>he recognised Moll's voice amongst them. They came
</p>
<p>nearer and nearer, seeking, as I think, the shade of those
</p>
<p>palm trees which sheltered us. And presently, quite close
</p>
<p>to us, as if but on the other side of the wall, one struck
</p>
<p>a lute and began to sing a Moorish song; when she had
</p>
<p>concluded her melancholy air a voice, as if saddened by the
</p>
<p>melody, sighed :
</p>
<p>" Ah me ! ah me ! "
</p>
<p>There was no misdoubting that sweet voice : 'twas Moll's.
</p>
<p>Then very softly Dawson begins to whistle her old favour-
</p>
<p>ite ditty " Hearts will break." Scarce had he finished the
</p>
<p>refrain when Moll within took it up in a faint trembling
</p>
<p>voice, but only a bar, to let us know we were heard ; then
</p>
<p>she fell a-laughing at her maids, who were whispering in
</p>
<p>alarm, to disguise her purpose ; and so they left that part,
</p>
<p>as we knew by their voices dying away in the distance.
</p>
<p>" She'll come again," whispers Dawson, feverishly.
</p>
<p>And he was in the right ; for, after we had stood there
</p>
<p>best part of an hour, we hear Moll again gently humming
</p>
<p>" Hearts will break," but so low, for fear of being heard by
</p>
<p>others, that only we who strained so hard to catch a sound
</p>
<p>could be aware of it.
</p>
<p>" Moll, my love ! " whispers Dawson, as she comes to an
</p>
<p>end.
</p>
<p>" Dear father ! " answers she, as low.
</p>
<p>" We are here Kit and I. Be comforted, sweet chuck,
</p>
<p>you shall be free ere long."

<p>"Shall I climb the wall?" asks she.
</p>
<p>FALL ONCE MORE INTO TROUBLE. 321
</p>
<p>"No, no, for God's sake, refrain !" says I, seeing that
</p>
<p>Jack was half minded to bid her come to him. " You will
</p>
<p>undo all have patience."
</p>
<p>At this moment other voices came to us from within, call-
</p>
<p>ing Lala Mollah; and presently the quick witch answers
</p>
<p>them from a distance, with a laugh, as if she had been
</p>
<p>playing at catch-who-can.
</p>
<p>Then Dawson and I, turning about, discovered to our
</p>
<p>consternation AH Oukadi standing quite close beside us,
</p>
<p>with folded arms and bent brows.
</p>
<p>" You are unwise," says he, in a calm tone.
</p>
<p>" Nay, master," says Jack, piteously. " I did but speak
</p>
<p>a word to my child."
</p>
<p>" If you understand our tongue," adds I, " you will know
</p>
<p>that we did but bid her have patience, and wait."
</p>
<p>" Possibly," says he. " Nevertheless, you compel me
</p>
<p>henceforth to keep her a close prisoner, when I would give
</p>
<p>her all the liberty possible."
</p>
<p>"Master," says Jack, imploring, "I do pray you not to
</p>
<p>punish her for my fault. Let her still have the freedom of
</p>
<p>your garden, and I promise you we will go away this day
</p>
<p>and return no more until we can purchase her liberty
</p>
<p>for ever."
</p>
<p>"Good," says the old man, "but mark you keep your
</p>
<p>promise. Know that 'tis an offence against the law to
</p>
<p>incite a slave to revolt. I tell you this, not as a threat, for
</p>
<p>I bear you no ill will, but as a warning to save you from
</p>
<p>consequences which I may be powerless to avert."
</p>
<p>This did seem to me a hint at some sinister design of
</p>
<p>Mohand ou Mohand a wild suspicion, maybe, on my
</p>
<p>part, and yet, as I think, justified by evils yet to come.

<p>Y
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXIX.
</p>
<p>Of our bargaining with a Moorish seaman ; and of an English slave.
</p>
<p>WE lost no time, be sure, in going back to Alger, bless-
</p>
<p>ing God on the way for our escape, and vowing most
</p>
<p>heartily that we would be led into no future folly, no mat-
</p>
<p>ter how simple and innocent the temptation might seem.
</p>
<p>And now began again a tedious season of watching on
</p>
<p>the mole of Alger ; but not to make this business as weari-
</p>
<p>some to others, I will pass that over and come at once to
</p>
<p>that joyful, happy morning, when, with but scant hope,
</p>
<p>looking down upon the deck of a galley entering the port,
</p>
<p>to our infinite delight and amazement we perceived Rich-
</p>
<p>ard Godwin waving his hand to us in sign of recognition.
</p>
<p>Then sure, mad with joy, we would have cast ourselves in
</p>
<p>the sea had we thereby been able to get to him more
</p>
<p>quickly. Nor was he much less moved with affection to
</p>
<p>meet us, and springing on the quai he took us both in his
</p>
<p>open arms and embraced us. But his first word was of
</p>
<p>Moll. "My beloved wife? " says he, and could question
</p>
<p>us no further.
</p>
<p>We told him she was safe, whereat he thanks God most
</p>
<p>fervently, and how we had spoken with her; and then he
</p>
<p>tells us of his adventures how on getting Don Sanchez's
</p>
<p>letter he had started forth at once with such help as Sir
</p>
<p>Peter Lely generously placed at his disposition, and how
</p>
<p>coming to Elche, he found Mrs. Godwin there in great

</p>
<p>anxiety because we had not returned, and how Don San-
</p>
<p>chez, guessing at our case, had procured money from To-
</p>
<p>ledo to pay Moll's ransom, and did further charter a neutral
</p>
<p>galley to bring him to Alger which was truly as hand-
</p>
<p>some a thing as any man could do, be he thief or no thief.
</p>
<p>All these matters we discussed on our way to the Cassanabah,
</p>
<p>where Mr. Godwin furnished himself as we had with a
</p>
<p>trader's permit for twenty-eight days.
</p>
<p>This done, we set out with a team of good mules, and
</p>
<p>reaching Thadviir about an hour before sundown, we re-
</p>
<p>paired at once to AH Oukadi's, who received us with much
</p>
<p>civility, although 'twas clear to see he was yet loath to give
</p>
<p>up Moll; but the sight of the gold Mr. Godwin laid before
</p>
<p>him did smooth the creases from his brow (for these Moors
</p>
<p>love money before anything on earth), and having told it
</p>
<p>carefully he writes an acknowledgment and fills up a
</p>
<p>formal sheet of parchment bearing the Dey's seal, which
</p>
<p>attested that Moll was henceforth a free subject and en-
</p>
<p>titled to safe-conduct within the confines of the Dey's
</p>
<p>administration. And having delivered these precious
</p>
<p>documents into Mr. Godwin's hands, he leaves us for a
</p>
<p>little space and then returns leading dear Moll by the hand.
</p>
<p>And she, not yet apprised of her circumstances, seeing her
</p>
<p>husband with us, gives a shrill cry, and like to faint with
</p>
<p>happiness totters forward and falls in his ready arms.
</p>
<p>I will not attempt to tell further of this meeting and our
</p>
<p>passionate, fond embraces, for 'twas past all description;
</p>
<p>only in the midst of our joy I perceived that Mohand ou
</p>
<p>Mohand had entered the room and stood there, a silent
</p>
<p>spectator of Moll's tender yielding to her husband's ca-

</p>
<p>with a wicked look of mortification and envy. And Moll
</p>
<p>seeing him, paled a little, drawing closer to her husband;
</p>
<p>for, as I learnt later on, and 'twas no more than I had
</p>
<p>guessed, he had paid her most assiduous attentions from
</p>
<p>the first moment he saw her, and had gone so far as to
</p>
<p>swear by Mahomet that death alone should end his burning
</p>
<p>passion to possess her. And I observed that when we
</p>
<p>parted, and Moll in common civility offered him her hand,
</p>
<p>he muttered some oath as he raised it to his lips.
</p>
<p>Declining as civilly as we might Ali Oukadi's tender of
</p>
<p>hospitality, we rested that night at the large inn or cara-
</p>
<p>vansary, and I do think that the joy of Moll and her hus-
</p>
<p>band lying once more within each other's arms was scarcely
</p>
<p>less than we felt, Dawson and I, at this happy ending of
</p>
<p>our long tribulations; but one thing it is safe to say, we
</p>
<p>slept as sound as they.
</p>
<p>And how gay were we when we set forth the next morn-
</p>
<p>ing for Alger Moll's eyes twinkling like stars for happi-
</p>
<p>ness, and her cheeks all pink with blushes like any new
</p>
<p>bride, her husband with not less pride than passion in his
</p>
<p>noble countenance, and Dawson and I as blithe and jolly
</p>
<p>as schoolboys on a holiday. For now had Moll by this act
</p>
<p>of heroism and devotion redeemed not only herself, but us
</p>
<p>also, and there was no further reason for concealment or
</p>
<p>deceit, but all might be themselves and fear no man.
</p>
<p>Thus did joy beguile us into a false sense of security.
</p>
<p>Coming to Alger about midday, we were greatly surprised
</p>
<p>to find that the sail chartered by Don Sanchez was no
</p>
<p>longer in the port, and the reason of this we presently
</p>
<p>learnt was that the Dey, having information of a descent

</p>
<p>being about to be made upon the town by the British fleet
</p>
<p>STILL IN GREAT JEOPARDY. 32$
</p>
<p>at Tangier, he had commanded, the night before, all alien
</p>
<p>ships to be gone from the port by daybreak. This put us
</p>
<p>to a quake, for in view of this descent not one single
</p>
<p>Algerine would venture to put to sea for all the money
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin could offer or promise. So here we were
</p>
<p>forced to stay in trepidation and doubt as to how we, being
</p>
<p>English, might fare if the town should be bombarded as
</p>
<p>we expected, and never did we wish our own countrymen
</p>
<p>further. Only our Moll and her husband did seem careless
</p>
<p>in their happiness; for so they might die in each other's
</p>
<p>arms, I do think they would have faced death with a smile
</p>
<p>upon their faces.
</p>
<p>However, a week passing, and no sign of any English
</p>
<p>flag upon the seas, the public apprehension subsided; and
</p>
<p>now we began very seriously to compass our return to Elche,
</p>
<p>our trader's passes (that is, Dawson's and mine) being run
</p>
<p>out within a week, and we knowing full well that we should
</p>
<p>not get them renewed after this late menace of an English
</p>
<p>attack upon the town. So, one after the other, we tried
</p>
<p>every captain in the port, but all to no purpose. And one
</p>
<p>of these did openly tell me the Dey had forbidden any
</p>
<p>stranger to be carried out of the town, on pain of having
</p>
<p>his vessel confiscated and being bastinadoed to his last
</p>
<p>endurance.
</p>
<p>"And so," says he, lifting his voice, "if you offered
</p>
<p>me all the gold in the world, I would not carry you a
</p>
<p>furlong hence." But at the same time, turning his back
</p>
<p>on a janizary who stood hard by, he gave me a most
</p>
<p>significant wink and a little beck, as if I were to follow
</p>
<p>him presently.

<p>ing him at a distance through the town and out into the
</p>
<p>suburbs, at an idle, sauntering gait. When we had got out
</p>
<p>beyond the houses, to the side of the river I have men-
</p>
<p>tioned, he sits him down on the bank, and I, coming up,
</p>
<p>sit down beside him as if for a passing chat. Then he,
</p>
<p>having glanced to the right and left, to make sure we were
</p>
<p>not observed, asks me what we would give to be taken to
</p>
<p>Elche; and I answered that we would give him his price
</p>
<p>so we could be conveyed shortly.
</p>
<p>"When would you go? " asks he.
</p>
<p>"Why," says I, "our passes expire at sundown after the
</p>
<p>day of Ramadah, so we must get hence, by hook or by
</p>
<p>crook, before that."
</p>
<p>"That falls as pat as I would have it," returns he (but
</p>
<p>not in these words), "for all the world will be up at the
</p>
<p>Cassanabah on that day, to the feast the Dey gives to honour
</p>
<p>his son's coming of age. Moreover, the moon by then
</p>
<p>will not rise before two in the morning. So all being in
</p>
<p>our favour, I'm minded to venture on this business. But
</p>
<p>you must understand that 'I dare not take you aboard in the
</p>
<p>port, where I must make a pretence of going out a-fishing
</p>
<p>with my three sons, and give the janizaries good assurance
</p>
<p>that no one else is aboard, that I may not fall into trouble
</p>
<p>on my return."
</p>
<p>"That's reasonable enough," says I, "but where will you
</p>
<p>take us aboard? "
</p>
<p>"I'll show you," returns he, "if you will stroll down
</p>
<p>this bank with me, for my sons and I have discussed this
</p>
<p>matter ever since we heard you were seeking a ship for this
</p>
<p>project, and we have it all cut and dried properly."

<p>reached a part where the river spreads out very broad and
</p>
<p>shallow.
</p>
<p>"You see that rock," says he, nodding at a huge boulder
</p>
<p>lapped by the incoming sea. " There shall you be at mid-
</p>
<p>night. We shall lie about a half a mile out to sea, and two
</p>
<p>of my sons will pull to the shore and take you up; so may
</p>
<p>all go well and nought be known, if you are commonly
</p>
<p>secret, for never a soul is seen here after sundown."
</p>
<p>I told him I would consult with my friends and give him
</p>
<p>our decision the next day, meeting him at this spot.
</p>
<p>"Good," says he, "and ere you decide, you may cast an
</p>
<p>eye at my ship, which you shall know by a white moon
</p>
<p>painted on her beam; 'tis as fast a ship as any that sails
</p>
<p>from Alger, though she carry but one mast, and so be we
</p>
<p>agree to this venture, you shall find the cabin fitted for
</p>
<p>your lady and everything for your comfort."
</p>
<p>On this we separated presently, and I, joining my
</p>
<p>friends at our inn, laid the matter before them. There
</p>
<p>being still some light, we then went forth on the mole,
</p>
<p>and there we quickly spied the White Moon, which, though
</p>
<p>a small craft, looked very clean, and with a fair cabin
</p>
<p>house, built up in the Moorish fashion upon the stern.
</p>
<p>And here, sitting down, we all agreed to accept this offer,
</p>
<p>Mr. Godwin being not less eager for the venture than we,
</p>

<p>So the next day I repaired to the rock, and meeting Haroun

<p>"It is from God." "We will not meet again till the day
</p>
<p>of Ramadah at midnight, lest we fall under suspicion.
</p>
<p>Farewell."
</p>
<p>We parted as we did before, he going his way, and I
</p>
<p>mine; but, looking back by accident before I had gone a
</p>
<p>couple of hundred yards, I perceived a fellow stealing
</p>
<p>forth from a thicket of canes that stood in the marshy
</p>
<p>ground near the spot where I had lately stood with Haroun,
</p>
<p>and turning again presently, I perceived this man follow-
</p>
<p>ing in my steps. Then, fairly alarmed, I gradually has-
</p>
<p>tened my pace (but not so quick neither as to seem to fly),
</p>
<p>making for the town, where I hoped to escape pursuit in
</p>
<p>the labyrinth of little, crooked, winding alleys. As I
</p>
<p>rounded a corner, I perceived him out of the tail of my
</p>
<p>eye, still following, but now within fifty yards of me, he
</p>
<p>having run to thus overreach me ; and ere I had turned up
</p>
<p>a couple of alleys he was on my heels and twitching me by
</p>
<p>the sleeve.
</p>
<p>" Lord love you, Master," says he, in very good English,
</p>
<p>but gasping for breath. " Hold hard a moment, for
</p>
<p>I've a thing or two to say to you as is worth your
</p>
<p>hearing."
</p>
<p>So I, mightily surprised by these words, stop ; and he see-
</p>
<p>ing the alley quite empty and deserted, sits down on a door-
</p>
<p>step, and I do likewise, both of us being spent with our
</p>
<p>exertions.
</p>
<p>" Was that man you were talking with a little while back
</p>
<p>named Haroun? " asks he, when he could fetch his breath.
</p>
<p>I nodded.
</p>
<p>"Did he offer to take you and three others to Elche,

</p>
<p>DISCOURSE OF AN ENGLISH SLAVE. 329
</p>
<p>I nodded again, astonished at his information, for we had
</p>
<p>not discussed our design to-day, Haroun and I.
</p>
<p>" Did he offer to carry you off in a boat to his craft from
</p>
<p>the rock on the mouth? "
</p>
<p>Once more I nodded.
</p>
<p>" Can you guess what will happen if you agree to this? "
</p>
<p>Now I shook my head.
</p>
<p>"The villain," says he, "will run you on a shoal, and
</p>
<p>there will he be overhauled by the janizaries, and you be
</p>
<p>carried prisoners back to Alger. Your freedom will be for-
</p>
<p>feited, and you will be sold for slaves. And that's not all,"
</p>
<p>adds he ; " the lass you have with you will be taken from
</p>
<p>you and given to Mohand ou Mohand, who has laid this
</p>
<p>trap for your destruction and the gratification of his lust."
</p>
<p>I fell a-shaking only to think of this crowning calamity,
</p>
<p>and could only utter broken, unintelligible sounds to ex-
</p>
<p>press my gratitude for this warning.
</p>
<p>" Listen, Master, if you cannot speak," said he ; " for I
</p>
<p>must quit you in a few minutes, or get my soles thrashed
</p>
<p>when I return home. What I have told you is true, as

<p>there is a God in heaven ; 'twas overheard by my comrade,

<p>who is a slave in Mohand's household. If you escape this

</p>
<p>Mohand's devilish cunning. I say, if you stay here you
</p>
<p>are doomed to share our miserable lot, by one device or
</p>
<p>another. But I will show you how you may turn the

<p>CHAPTER XL.
</p>
<p>Of our escape from Barbary, of the pursuit and horrid, fearful slaugh-
</p>
<p>ter that followed, together with other moving circumstances.
</p>
<p>So Groves, as my man was named, told me how he and
</p>
<p>eight other poor Englishmen, sharing the same bagnio, had
</p>
<p>endured the hardships and misery of slavery, some for thir-
</p>
<p>teen, and none less than seven, years ; how for three years
</p>
<p>they had been working a secret tunnel by which they could
</p>
<p>escape from their bagnio (in which they were locked up
</p>
<p>every night at sundown) at any moment ; how for six
</p>
<p>months, since the completion of their tunnel, they had been
</p>
<p>watching a favourable opportunity to seize a ship and make
</p>
<p>good their escape (seven of them being mariners); and how
</p>
<p>now they were, by tedious suspense, wrought to such a pitch
</p>
<p>of desperation that they were ripe for any means of winning
</p>
<p>their freedom. " And here," says he, in conclusion, " hath
</p>
<p>merciful Providence given us the power to save not only
</p>
<p>ourselves from this accursed bondage, but you, also, if you
</p>
<p>are minded to join us."
</p>
<p>Asking him how he proposed to accomplish this end,
</p>
<p>he replies :
</p>
<p>" Tis as easy as kiss your hand. First, do you accept
</p>
<p>Haroun's offer?"
</p>
<p>"I have," says I.
</p>
<p>"Good ! " says he, rubbing his hands, and speaking thick
</p>
<p>with joy. " You may be sure that Mohand will suffer no

</p>
<p>one to interfere with your getting aboard, to the achieve-
</p>
<p>ment of his design. When is it to be?"
</p>
<p>I hesitated a moment, lest I should fall into another
</p>
<p>trap, trying to escape from the first ; but, seeing he was an
</p>
<p>Englishman, I would not believe him capable of playing into
</p>
<p>the Turks' hands for our undoing, and so I told him our
</p>
<p>business was for midnight on the feast of Ramadah.
</p>
<p>" Sure, nought but Providence could have ordered matters
</p>
<p>so well," says he, doubling himself up, as if unable to control
</p>
<p>his joy. "We shall be there, we nine sturdy men. Some
</p>
<p>shall hide in the canes, and others behind the rock ; and
</p>
<p>when Haroun rows to shore, four of us will get into his boat
</p>
<p>(muffled up as you would be to escape detection), and as
</p>
<p>soon as they lay themselves to their oars, their business
</p>
<p>shall be settled."
</p>
<p>"As how?" asks I, shrinking (as ever) from deeds of
</p>
<p>violence.
</p>
<p>"Leave that to us; but be assured they shall not raise
</p>
<p>a cry that shall fright your lady. Oh, we know the use
</p>
<p>of a bow-string as well as any Turk amongst them. We
</p>
<p>have that to thank 'em for. Well, these two being de-
</p>
<p>spatched, we return to shore, and two more of our men
</p>
<p>will get in ; then we four to the felucca, and there boarding,
</p>
<p>we serve the others as we served the first two; so back
</p>
<p>comes one of us to fetch off our other comrades and you
</p>
<p>four. Then, all being aboard, we cut our cable, up with
</p>
<p>our sail, and by the time Mohand comes, in the morning,
</p>
<p>to seek his game on the sand-bank, we shall be half way to
</p>
<p>Elche, and farther, if Providence do keep pace with this
</p>
<p>happy beginning. What say you, friend? " adds he, noting

</p>
<p>my reflective mood.
</p>
<p>33 2 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>Then I frankly confessed that I would have some assur-
</p>
<p>ance of his honesty.
</p>
<p>" I can give you none, Master," says he, " but the word
</p>
<p>of a good Yorkshireman. Surely, you may trust me as I
</p>
<p>trust you ; for 'tis in your power to reveal all to Haroun,
</p>
<p>and so bring us all to the galleys. Have you no faith in
</p>
<p>a poor broken Englishman? "
</p>
<p>"Yes," says I ; " I'll trust you."
</p>
<p>Then we rose, clapping hands, and he left me, with tears
</p>
<p>of gratitude and joy in his eyes. Telling my friends I had
</p>
<p>something of a secret nature to impart, we went out to the
</p>
<p>end of the mole, where we were secure from eavesdroppers,
</p>
<p>and there I laid the whole story before them, whereupon
</p>
<p>we fell debating what we should do, looking at this matter
</p>
<p>from every side, with a view to our security; but, slavery
</p>
<p>lying before us, and no better means of escaping it coming
</p>
<p>to our minds, we did at last unanimously agree to trust Joe
</p>
<p>Groves rather than Haroun.
</p>
<p>The next day there fell a great deluge of rain, and the
</p>
<p>morrow being the feast of Ramadah, we regarded this as
</p>
<p>highly favourable to our escape ; for here when rain falls it
</p>
<p>ceases not for forty-eight hours, and thus might we count
</p>
<p>upon the aid of darkness. And that evening as we were re-
</p>
<p>garding some merchandise in a bazaar, a fellow sidles up
</p>
<p>to me, and whispers (fingering a piece of cloth as if he were
</p>
<p>minded to buy it):
</p>
<p>"Does all go well?"
</p>
<p>Then perceiving this was Joe Groves, I answered in the
</p>
<p>same manner :
</p>
<p>"All goes well."

</p>
<p>DESPERATE DOINGS. 333
</p>
<p>" To-morrow at midnight," I return. Upon which, cast-
</p>
<p>ing down the cloth, he goes away without further sign.
</p>
<p>And now comes in the feast of Ramadah with a heavy,
</p>
<p>steady downpour of rain all day, and no sign of ceasing at
</p>
<p>sundown, which greatly contented us. About ten, the house
</p>
<p>we lodged in being quite still, and our fear of accident
</p>
<p>pressing us to depart, we crept silently out into the street
</p>
<p>without let or hindrance (though I warrant some spy of
</p>
<p>Mohand's was watching to carry information of our flight to
</p>
<p>his master), and so through the narrow deserted alleys to
</p>
<p>the outskirts of the town, and thence by the river side to the
</p>
<p>great rock, with only just so much light as enabled us to
</p>
<p>hang together, and no more. And I do believe we should
</p>
<p>have floundered into the river o' one side of the marsh of
</p>
<p>canes or t'other, but that having gone over this road the
</p>
<p>last time with the thought that it might lead us to liberty,
</p>
<p>every object by the way impressed itself upon my mind
</p>
<p>most astonishingly.
</p>
<p>Here under this rock stood we above an hour with no
</p>
<p>sound but the beating of the rain, and the lap of the water
</p>
<p>running in from the sea. Then, as it might be about half-
</p>
<p>past eleven, a voice close beside us (which I knew for Joe
</p>
<p>Groves, though I could see no one but us four, Jack by my
</p>
<p>side, and Moll bound close to her husband) says :
</p>
<p>"All goes well?"
</p>
<p>" Yes, all goes well," says I ; whereupon he gives a cry like
</p>
<p>the croak of a frog, and his comrades steal up almost unseen
</p>
<p>and unheard, save that each as he came whispered his name,
</p>
<p>as Spinks, Davis, Lee, Best, etc., till their number was all told.
</p>
<p>Then Groves, who was clearly chosen their captain, calls

<p>Spinks, Lee, and Best to stand with him, and bids the others
</p>

</p>
<p>and us to stand back against the canes till we are called.
</p>
<p>So we do his bidding, and fall back to the growth of
</p>
<p>canes, whence we could but dimly make out the mass of
</p>
<p>the rock for the darkness, and there waited breathless, lis-
</p>
<p>tening for the sound of oars. But these Moors, for a bet-
</p>
<p>ter pretence of secrecy, had muffled their oars, so that we
</p>
<p>knew not they were at hand until we heard Haroun's voice
</p>
<p>speaking low.
</p>
<p>" Englishmen, are you there ? " asks he.
</p>
<p>"Aye, we four," whispers Groves, in reply.
</p>
<p>Then we hear them wade into the water and get into the
</p>
<p>boat with whispering of Haroun where they are to dispose
</p>
<p>themselves, and so forth. After that silence for about ten
</p>
<p>minutes, and no sound but the ceaseless rain until we next
</p>
<p>hear Groves' voice.
</p>
<p>" Davis, Negus," whispers he, on which two of our num-
</p>
<p>ber leave us and go out to the boat to replace Haroun and
</p>
<p>that other Moor, who, in the manner of the Turks, had been
</p>
<p>strangled and cast overboard.
</p>
<p>And now follows a much longer period of silence, but at
</p>
<p>length that comes to an end, and we hear Groves' voice
</p>
<p>again whispering us to come. At the first sound of his voice
</p>
<p>his three comrades rush forward ; but Groves, recognising
</p>
<p>them, says hoarsely, " Back, every one of you but those I
</p>
<p>called, or I'll brain you ! There's room but for six in the boat,
</p>
<p>and those who helped us shall go first, as I ordered. The
</p>
<p>rest must wait their time."
</p>
<p>So these fellows, who would have ousted us, give way,
</p>
<p>grumbling, and Mr. Godwin carrying Moll to the boat, Daw-
</p>
<p>son and I wade in after him, and so, with great gratitude,

<p>take our places as Groves directs. We being in, he and his

<p>PURSUED BY A GALLEY. 335
</p>
<p>mate lay to their oars, and pull out to the felucca, guided
</p>
<p>by the lanthorn on her bulwarks.
</p>
<p>Having put us aboard safely, Groves and his mate fetch
</p>
<p>the three fellows that remained ashore, and now all being
</p>
<p>embarked, they abandon the small boat, slip the anchor,
</p>
<p>and get out their long sweeps, all in desperate haste ; for
</p>
<p>that absence of wind, which I at first took to be a blessing,
</p>
<p>appeared now to be a curse, and our main hope of escape
</p>
<p>lay in pulling far out to sea before Mohand discovered the
</p>
<p>trick put upon him, and gave chase. All night long we
</p>
<p>toiled with most savage energy, dividing our number into
</p>
<p>two batches, so that one might go to the oars as the other
</p>
<p>tired, turn and turn about. Not one of us but did his
</p>
<p>utmost nay, even Moll would stand by her husband, and
</p>
<p>strain like any man at this work. But for all our labour,
</p>
<p>Alger was yet in sight when the break of day gave us light
</p>
<p>to see it. Then was every eye searching the waters for
</p>
<p>sign of a sail, be it to save or to undo us. Sail saw we none,
</p>
<p>but about nine o'clock Groves, scanning the waters over
</p>
<p>against Alger, perceived something which he took to be a
</p>
<p>galley ; nor were we kept long in uncertainty, for by ten it
</p>
<p>was obvious to us all, showing that it had gained considerably
</p>
<p>upon us in spite of our frantic exertions, which convinced us
</p>
<p>that this was Mohand, and that he had discovered us with
</p>
<p>the help of a spy-glass, maybe.
</p>
<p>At the prospect of being overtaken and carried back to
</p>
<p>slavery, a sort of madness possessed those at the oars, the
</p>
<p>first oar pulling with such a fury of violence that it snapped
</p>
<p>at the rowlock, and was of no further use. Still we made
</p>
<p>good progress, but what could we with three oars do against

</p>
<p>were for cutting down the mast and throwing spars, sails,
</p>
<p>and every useless thing overboard to lighten our ship, but
</p>
<p>Groves would not hear of this, seeing by a slant in the
</p>
<p>rain that a breeze was to be expected ; and surely enough,
</p>
<p>the rain presently smote us on the cheek smartly, where-
</p>
<p>upon Groves ran up our sail, which, to our infinite delight,
</p>
<p>did presently swell out fairly, careening us so that the oar
</p>
<p>on t'other side was useless.
</p>
<p>But that which favoured us favoured also our enemies,
</p>
<p>and shortly after we saw two sails go up to match our one.
</p>
<p>Then Groves called a council of us and his felloVs, and his
</p>
<p>advice was this : that ere the galley drew nigh enough for
</p>
<p>our number to be sighted, he and his fellows should bestow
</p>
<p>themselves away in the stern cabin, and lie there with such
</p>
<p>arms of knives and spikes as they had brought with them
</p>
<p>ready to their hands, and that, on Mohand boarding us
</p>
<p>with his men, we four should retire towards the cabin,
</p>
<p>when he and his comrades would spring forth and fight
</p>
<p>every man to the death for freedom. And he held out
</p>
<p>good promise of a successful issue. " For," says he, "know-
</p>
<p>ing you four " (meaning us) " are unarmed, 'tis not likely he
</p>
<p>will have furnished himself with any great force ; and as
</p>
<p>his main purpose is to possess this lady, he will not suffer
</p>
<p>his men to use their firepieces to the risk of her de-
</p>
<p>struction ; therefore," adds he, " if you have the stomach
</p>
<p>for your part of this business, which is but to hold the
</p>
<p>helm as I direct, all must go well. But for the lady, if
</p>
<p>she hath any fear, we may find a place in the cabin for
</p>
<p>her."
</p>
<p>This proposal was accepted by all with gladness, except

</p>
<p>but had he not been there, I believe she would have been
</p>
<p>the last aboard to feel fear, or play a cowardly part.
</p>
<p>So without further parley, the fellows crept into the little
</p>
<p>cabin, each fingering his naked weapon, which made me
</p>
<p>feel very sick with apprehension of bloodshed.
</p>
<p>The air of wind freshening, we kept on at a spanking rate
</p>
<p>for another hour, Groves lying on the deck with his eyes
</p>
<p>just over the bulwarks and giving orders to Dawson and me,
</p>
<p>who kept the helm ; then the galley, being within a quarter
</p>
<p>of a mile of us, fired a shot as a signal to us to haul down
</p>
<p>our sail, and this having no effect, he soon after fires another,
</p>
<p>which, striking us in the stem, sent great splinters flying up
</p>
<p>from the bulwarks there.
</p>
<p>" Hold her helm, stiff," whispers Groves, and then he backs
</p>
<p>cautiously into the cabin without rising from his belly, for
</p>
<p>the men aboard the galley were now clearly distinguishable.
</p>
<p>Presently bang goes another gun, and the same moment,
</p>
<p>its shot taking our mast a yard or so above the deck, our
</p>
<p>lateen falls over upon the water with a great slap, and so are
</p>
<p>we brought to at once.
</p>
<p>Dropping her sail, the galley sweeps up alongside us, and
</p>
<p>casting out divers hooks and tackle they held ready for their
</p>
<p>purpose, they grappled us securely. My heart sank within
</p>
<p>me as I perceived the number of our enemies, thirty or forty,
</p>
<p>as I reckon (but happily not above half a dozen armed
</p>
<p>men), and Mohand ou Mohand amongst them with a scimi-
</p>
<p>tar in his hand ; for now I foresaw the carnage which must
</p>
<p>ensue when we were boarded.
</p>
<p>Mohand ou Mohand was the first to spring upon our deck,
</p>
<p>and behind came his janizaries and half a score of seamen.

<p>put it up, and making an obeisance to Moll, he told us we
</p>
<p>should suffer no hurt if we surrendered peaceably.
</p>
<p>"Never, you Turkish thief!" cries Dawson, shaking his
</p>
<p>fist at him.
</p>
<p>Mohand makes a gesture of regret, and turning to his
</p>
<p>men tells them to take us, but to use no weapons, since we
</p>
<p>had none. Then, he himself leading, with his eyes fixed
</p>
<p>hungrily upon Moll, the rest came on, and we fell back
</p>
<p>towards the cabin.
</p>
<p>The next instant, with a wild yell of fury, the hidden men
</p>
<p>burst out of the cabin, and then followed a scene of butch-
</p>
<p>ery which I pray Heaven it may nevermore be my fate to
</p>
<p>witness.
</p>
<p>Groves was the first to spill blood. Leaping upon
</p>
<p>Mohand, he buried a long curved knife right up to the hilt
</p>
<p>in his neck striking downwards just over the collar bone,
</p>
<p>and he fell, the blood spurting from his mouth upon the
</p>
<p>deck. At the same time our men, falling upon the jani-
</p>
<p>zaries, did most horrid battle nay, 'twas no battle, but
</p>
<p>sheer butchery ; for these men, being taken so suddenly,
</p>
<p>had no time to draw their weapons, and could only fly to
</p>
<p>the fore end of the boat for escape, where, by reason of
</p>
<p>their number and the narrow confines of the deck, they
</p>
<p>were so packed and huddled together that none could raise
</p>
<p>his hand to ward a blow even, and so stood, a writhing,
</p>
<p>shrieking mass of humanity, to be hacked and stabbed and
</p>
<p>ripped and cut down to their death.

<p>And their butchers had no mercy. They could think
</p>
<p>THE END OF THAT BUSINESS. 339
</p>
<p>only of their past wrongs, and of satiating the thirst for
</p>
<p>vengeance, which had grown to a madness by previous
</p>
<p>restraint.
</p>
<p>"There's for thirteen years of misery," cries one, driving
</p>
<p>his spike into the heart of one. " Take that for hanging of
</p>
<p>my brother," screams a second, cleaving a Moor's skull with
</p>
<p>his hatchet. " Quits for turning an honest lad into a devil,"
</p>
<p>calls a third, drawing his knife across the throat of a shriek-
</p>
<p>ing wretch, and so forth, till not one of all the crowd was left
</p>
<p>to murder.
</p>
<p>Then still devoured by their lust for blood, they swarmed
</p>
<p>over the side of the galley to finish this massacre Groves
</p>
<p>leading with a shout of " No quarter," and all echoing these
</p>
<p>words with a roar of joy. But here they were met with some
</p>
<p>sort of resistance, for the Moors aboard, seeing the fate of
</p>
<p>their comrades, forewarning them of theirs, had turned their
</p>
<p>swivel gun about and now fired the ball carrying off the
</p>
<p>head of Joe Groves, the best man of all that crew, if one
</p>
<p>were better than another. But this only served to incense
</p>
<p>the rest the more, and so they went at their cruel work
</p>
<p>again, and ceased not till the last of their enemies was dead.
</p>
<p>Then, with a wild hurrah, they signal their triumph, and
</p>
<p>one fellow, holding up his bloody hands, smears them over
</p>
<p>his face with a devilish scream of laughter.
</p>
<p>And now, caring no more for us or what might befall us,
</p>
<p>than for the Turks who lay all mangled on our deck, one
</p>
<p>cuts away the tackle that lashes their galley to us, while the

<p>rest haul up the sail, and so they go their way, leaving us

<p>CHAPTER XLI.
</p>
<p>How Dawson counts himself an unlucky man who were best dead ; and
</p>
<p>so he quits us, and /, the reader.
</p>
<p>THE galley bent over to the wind and sped away, and I
</p>
<p>watched her go without regret, not thinking of our own hap-
</p>
<p>less condition, but only of the brutal ferocity of that mad
</p>
<p>crew aboard her.
</p>
<p>Their shouts of joy and diabolical laughter died away,
</p>
<p>and there was no sound but the lapping of the waves against
</p>
<p>the felucca's side. They had done their work thoroughly ;
</p>
<p>not a moan arose from the heaps of butchered men, not a
</p>
<p>limb moved, but all were rigid, some lying in grotesque
</p>
<p>postures as the death agony had drawn them. And after
</p>
<p>the tumult that had prevailed this stillness of death was
</p>
<p>terrific. From looking over this ghastly picture I turned
</p>
<p>and clutched at Dawson's hand for some comforting sense
</p>
<p>of life and humanity.
</p>
<p>We were startled at this moment by a light laugh from
</p>
<p>the cabin, whither Mr. Godwin had carried Moll, fainting
</p>
<p>with the horror of this bloody business, and going in there
</p>
<p>we found her now lying in a little crib, light-headed,
</p>
<p>clean out of her wits indeed, for she fancied herself on
</p>
<p>the dusty road to Valencia, taking her first lesson in the
</p>
<p>fandango from Don Sanchez. Mr. Godwin knelt by the
</p>
<p>cot side, with his arm supporting her head, and soothing
</p>
<p>her the best he could. We found a little cask of water

</p>
<p>WE SPRING A LEAK. 341
</p>
<p>and a cup, that he might give her drink, and then, seeing
</p>
<p>we could be of no further service, Dawson and I went from
</p>
<p>the cabin, our thoughts awaking now to the peril of our
</p>
<p>position, without sail in mid-sea.
</p>
<p>And first we cast our eyes all round about the sea, but
</p>
<p>we could descry no sail save the galley (and that at a great
</p>
<p>distance), nor any sign of land. Next, casting our eyes
</p>
<p>upon the deck, we perceived that the thick stream of blood
</p>
<p>that lay along that side bent over by the broken mast, was
</p>
<p>greatly spread, and not so black, but redder, which was
</p>
<p>only to be explained by the mingling of water; and this
</p>
<p>was our first notice that the felucca was filling and we
</p>
<p>going down.
</p>
<p>Recovering presently from the stupor into which this
</p>
<p>suspicion threw us, we pulled up a hatch, and looking down
</p>
<p>into the hold perceived that this was indeed true, a pun-
</p>
<p>cheon floating on the water there within arms' reach.
</p>
<p>Thence, making our way quickly over the dead bodies,
</p>
<p>which failed now to terrify us, to the fore part of our fe-
</p>
<p>lucca, we discovered that the shot which had hit us had
</p>
<p>started a plank, and that the water leaked in with every lap
</p>
<p>of a wave. So now, our wits quickened by our peril, we took
</p>
<p>a scimitar and a dirk from a dead janizary, to cut away the
</p>
<p>cordage that lashed us to the fallen mast, to free us of that
</p>
<p>burden and right the ship if we might. But ere we did
</p>
<p>this, Dawson, spying the great sail lying out on the water,
</p>
<p>bethought him to hack out a great sheet as far as we could
</p>
<p>reach, and this he took to lay over the started plank and
</p>
<p>staunch the leakage, while I severed the tackle and freed
</p>
<p>us from the great weight of the hanging mast and long

</p>
<p>spar. And certainly we thought ourselves safe when this
</p>
<p>342 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>was done, for the hull lifted at once and righted itself upon
</p>
<p>the water. Nevertheless, we were not easy, for we knew
</p>
<p>not what other planks below the water line were injured,
</p>
<p>nor how to sink our sheet or bind it over the faulty
</p>
<p>part. So, still further to lighten us, we mastered our
</p>
<p>qualms and set to work casting the dead bodies overboard.
</p>
<p>This horrid business, at another time, would have made me
</p>
<p>sick as any dog, but there was no time to yield to mawkish
</p>
<p>susceptibilities in the face of such danger as menaced
</p>
<p>us. Only when all was done, I did feel very weakened
</p>
<p>and shaky, and my gorge rising at the look of my jerkin,
</p>
<p>all filthy with clotted blood, I tore it off and cast it in the
</p>
<p>sea, as also did Dawson; and so, to turn our thoughts
</p>
<p>(after washing of our hands and cleaning our feet), we
</p>
<p>looked over the side, and agreed that we were no lower
</p>
<p>than we were, but rather higher for having lightened our
</p>
<p>burden. But no sail anywhere on the wide sea to add to
</p>
<p>our comfort.
</p>
<p>Going into the cabin, we found that our dear Moll had
</p>
<p>fallen into a sleep, but was yet very feverish, as we could
</p>
<p>see by her frequent turning, her sudden starts, and the
</p>
<p>dreamy, vacant look in her eyes, when she opened them
</p>
<p>and begged for water. We would not add to Mr. Godwin's
</p>
<p>trouble by telling him of ours (our minds being still rest-
</p>
<p>less with apprehensions of the leak), but searching about,
</p>
<p>and discovering two small, dry loaves, we gave him one,
</p>
<p>and took the other to divide betwixt us, Dawson and I.
</p>
<p>And truly we needed this refreshment (as our feeble, shaking
</p>
<p>limbs testified), after all our exertions of the night and day
</p>
<p>(it being now high noon), having eaten nothing since sup-

</p>
<p>per the night before. But, famished as we were, we must
</p>
<p>PERCEIVE WE ARE FOUNDERING. 343
</p>
<p>needs steal to the side and look over to mark where the
</p>
<p>water rose; and neither of us dared say the hull was no
</p>
<p>lower, for we perceived full well it had sunk somewhat in
</p>
<p>the last hour.
</p>
<p>Jack took a bite of his loaf, and offered me the rest,
</p>
<p>saying he had no stomach for food; but I could not eat my
</p>
<p>own, and so we thrust the bread in our breeches pockets
</p>
<p>and set to work, heaving everything overboard that might
</p>
<p>lighten us, and for ever a-straining our eyes to sight a ship.
</p>
<p>Then we set to devising means to make the sheet cling over
</p>
<p>the damaged planks, but to little purpose, and so Dawson
</p>
<p>essayed to get at it from the inside by going below, but the
</p>
<p>water was risen so high there was no room between it and
</p>
<p>the deck to breathe, and so again to wedging the canvas in
</p>
<p>from the outside till the sun sank. And by that time the
</p>
<p>water was beginning to lap up through the hatchway. Then
</p>
<p>no longer able to blink the truth, Jack turns to me and asks :
</p>
<p>" How long shall we last? "
</p>
<p>"Why," says I, "we have sunk no more than a foot
</p>
<p>these last six hours, and at this slow pace we may well last
</p>
<p>out eight or nine more ere the water comes over the bul-
</p>
<p>warks."
</p>
<p>He shook his head ruefully, and, pointing to a sluice
</p>
<p>hole in the side, said he judged it must be all over with
</p>
<p>us when the water entered there.
</p>
<p>"Why, in that case," says I, "let us find something to
</p>
<p>fill the sluice hole."
</p>
<p>So having nothing left on deck, we went into the cabin on
</p>
<p>a pretence of seeing how Moll fared, and Jack sneaked away
</p>
<p>an old jacket and I a stone bottle, and with these we stopped

</p>
<p>the sluice hole the best we could.
</p>
<p>344 A SET OF ROGUES.
</p>
<p>By the time we had made a job of this 'twas quite dark,
</p>
<p>and having nothing more to do but to await the end, we
</p>
<p>stood side by side, too dejected to speak for some time,
</p>
<p>thinking of the cruelty of fate which rescued us from one
</p>
<p>evil only to plunge us in a worse. At length, Jack fell to
</p>
<p>talking in a low tone of his past life, showing how things had
</p>
<p>ever gone ill with him and those he loved.
</p>
<p>" I think," says he in conclusion, " I am an unlucky man,
</p>
<p>Kit. One of those who are born to be a curse against their
</p>
<p>will to others rather than a blessing."
</p>
<p>"Fie, Jack," says I, " 'tis an idle superstition."
</p>
<p>" Nay," says he, " I am convinced 'tis the truth. Not
</p>
<p>one of us here but would have been the happier had I died
</p>
<p>a dozen years ago. 'Tis all through me that we drown
</p>
<p>to-night."
</p>
<p>" Nay, 'tis a blessing that we die all together, and none
</p>
<p>left to mourn."
</p>
<p>" That may be for you and me who have lived the best
</p>
<p>years of our life, but for those in there but just tasting the
</p>
<p>sweets of life, with years of joy unspent, 'tis another matter."
</p>
<p>Then we were silent for a while, till feeling the water lav-
</p>
<p>ing my feet, I asked if we should not now tell Mr. Godwin
</p>
<p>of our condition.
</p>
<p>" 'Twas in my mind, Kit," answers he "I will send him
</p>
<p>out to you."
</p>
<p>He went into the cabin, and Mr. Godwin coming out,
</p>
<p>I showed him our state. But 'twas no surprise to him.
</p>
<p>Only, it being now about three in the morning, and the
</p>
<p>moon risen fair and full in the heavens, he casts his eyes
</p>
<p>along the silver path on the water in the hope of rescue,

</p>
<p>and finding none, he grasps my hand and says :
</p>
<p>JACK DAWSON, HIS END. 345
</p>
<p>" God's will be done ! Tis a mercy that my dear love is
</p>
<p>spared this last terror. Our pain will not be long."
</p>
<p>A shaft of moonlight entered the cabin, and there we per-
</p>
<p>ceived Dawson kneeling by the crib, with his head laid upon
</p>
<p>the pillow beside his daughter.
</p>
<p>He rose and came out without again turning to look on
</p>
<p>Moll, and Mr. Godwin took his place.
</p>
<p>" I feel more happy, Kit," says Jack, laying his hand upon
</p>
<p>my shoulder. " I do think God will be merciful to us."
</p>
<p>" Aye, surely," says I, wilfully mistaking his meaning. " I
</p>
<p>think the water hath risen no higher this last hour."
</p>
<p>" I'll see how our sheet hangs ; do you look if the water
</p>
<p>comes in yet at the sluice hole."
</p>
<p>And so, giving my arm a squeeze as he slips his hand
</p>
<p>from my shoulder, he went to the fore part of the vessel,
</p>
<p>while I crossed to the sluice hole, where the water was
</p>
<p>spurting through a chink.
</p>
<p>I rose after jamming the jacket to staunch the leak, and
</p>
<p>turning towards Jack I perceived him standing by the bulwark,
</p>
<p>with the moon beyond. And the next moment he was gone.
</p>
<p>And so ended the life of this poor, loving, unlucky man.
</p>
<p>I know not whether it was this lightening of our burden,
</p>
<p>or whether at that time some accident of a fold in the sail
</p>
<p>sucking into the leaking planks, stayed the further ingress of
</p>
<p>waters, but certain it is that after this we sank no deeper to
</p>
<p>any perceptible degree ; and so it came about that we were

<p>sighted by a fishing-boat from Carthagena, a little after day-

<p>I have spent the last week at Hurst Court, where Moll

<p>and her husband have lived ever since Lady Godwin's

<p>and 'twas sweet to see Moll and her husband, with their

<p>We have nothing but praise for this story. Of adventure .01 the most
</p>
<p>stirring kind there is, as we have said, abundance. But there is more than
</p>
<p>this. The characters are drawn with great skill. Everyone of the gang of

<p>bushrangers is strongly individualized. We have not the mere catalogue
</p>
<p>of fortis Gyas fortisque Cloanthus, but genuine men. The father, a sturdy
</p>
<p>Englishman, whose whole nature is warped by early influences; the hero,
</p>
<p>poor " Jim,' 1 his brother, a simple, lovable fellow who might have gone straight
</p>
<p>under happier circumstances ; Starlight, a gentleman by birth and education,
</p>
<p>who has a strange story behind him in the Old Country ; and, lastly, the half-
