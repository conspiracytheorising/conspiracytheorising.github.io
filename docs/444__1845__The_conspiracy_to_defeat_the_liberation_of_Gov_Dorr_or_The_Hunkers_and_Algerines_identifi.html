<p>THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>TO
</p>
<p>DEFEAT THE LIBEEATION OF GOVEENOE DOEE;
</p>
<p>OR,
</p>
<p>AND
</p>
<p>THEIR POLICY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Charles the Second, King of England,
</p>
<p>that Monarch of his royal " will and pleasure, especial grace, certain know-
</p>
<p>ledge, and mere motion," as is stated therein, granted a Charter to Benedict
</p>
<p>Arnold and others, declaring them "from time to time, and forever hereafter, a
</p>
<p>body corporate and politic, in fact and name, by the name of The Governor and
</p>
<p>Company of the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,
</p>
<p>in New England, in America ; and that, by the same name, they and their suc-
</p>
<p>cessors shall and may have perpetual succession," &c.
</p>
<p>When the Constitution was framed and adopted by the United States in 17S8,
</p>
<p>North Carolina and Rhode Island excepted, the State of Rhode Island had not
</p>
<p>changed its form of government, unless some change in the name may be con-
</p>
<p>sidered as abolishing the form. The Constitution of the United States went
</p>
<p>into operation in 1789. Rhode Island, taking no part in framing or ratifying it,
</p>
<p>was treated as a foreign State, and duties were laid upon her iBanufactures v. hen
</p>
<p>imported into the States of the Union.
</p>
<p>On the 29th of May, 1790, a Convention of the State, assembled at New-
</p>
<p>port, ratified the Constitution of the United States ; having drawn up and pre-
</p>
<p>fixed to their act of ratification, eighteen specifications of principles, or expla-
</p>
<p>nations, which they declared to be consistent with the Constitution, and having
</p>
<p>also annexed twenty-one articles which they proposed and recommended as
</p>
<p>amendments thereto. In the third specification of principles, declared thus to
</p>
<p>be rights, embodied in the Constitution, the Convention assert, " That the
</p>
<p>powers of government may be re-assumed by the people, whensoever it shall
</p>
<p>become necessary to their happiness."
</p>
<p>For more than fifty years, the State of Rhode Island continued without any
</p>
<p>other form of State Government than such parts of the Charter as were ac-
</p>
<p>quiesced in by the people, although several unsuccessful attempts were, at dif-
</p>
<p>ferent times, made to form a State Constitution. In the year 1840, the people
</p>
<p>of Rhode Island were engaged in an exciting discussion upon the propriety of
</p>

</p>
<p>forming for the State, a Constitution based upon the principle of free suffrage.
</p>
<p>The discussion was maintained with much zeal by the friends and foes of free
</p>
<p>suffrage, until a convention was called at Providence in November, 1S41, which
</p>
<p>drafted and submitted to the people for their consideration a form of government
</p>
<p>for the State, called the People's Constitution. In the latter part of the month
</p>
<p>of December following, the People's Constitution was adopted by a large ma-
</p>
<p>jority of the people of the State, and it is a remarkable fact in the history of
</p>
<p>this eventful time, that a majority of the freeholders were found to have voted
</p>
<p>for it, their names having been endorsed upon their ballots. In pursuance of the
</p>
<p>4 THE HUNKERS AND
</p>
<p>provisions of this Constitution, thus formed and adopted, an election for State
</p>
<p>officers was held under it, and by a decided majority of the suffrages of the
</p>
<p>people, Thomas Wilson Dorr was elected Governor of the State.
</p>
<p>Disregarding these repeated decisions of the people, and the revolutionary
</p>
<p>principle upon which the whole structure of our political institutions is based,
</p>
<p>" That the powers of government may be re-assumed by the people, whenso-
</p>
<p>ever it shall become necessary to their happiness," the minority of the people
</p>
<p>of .Rhode Island, numbering perhaps one third of the legal voters, and possibly
</p>
<p>possessing two thirds of the wealth of the State, seeing themselves about to be
</p>
<p>deprived of powers which they had long assumed and abused, and reduced to a
</p>
<p>political level with their less wealthy fellow citizens, conspired to prevent the
</p>
<p>due organization and action of the new government. By imputing to the free
</p>
<p>suffrage party the design of plundering men of property, and the vaults of the
</p>
<p>banks, and violating the sanctity of families ; charges which they must have
</p>
<p>known to be as false as they were audacious, the Algerines, who pretended to
</p>
<p>be the friends of " law and order," succeeded in drawing back to their ranks
</p>
<p>some timid men who had voted for the People's Constitution. A few men who
</p>
<p>had attained public stations, v/ithout possessing that persevering firmness so
</p>
<p>needful in reformers, yielding to their impulses, brought discredit upon the suf-
</p>
<p>frage cause. Still, the friends of the People's Constitution would probably
</p>
<p>have triumphed over all these obstacles, but for the significant interference of
</p>
<p>the Executive branch of the government of the United States. For this mani-
</p>
<p>festation of regard for the oppressor, and disregard of the rights of the oppress-
</p>
<p>ed, many of the friends of free suffrage were not prepared. They desired a
</p>
<p>Republican form of government, but were unwilling to fight for it, especially
</p>
<p>with that power whose sworn duty it was to guarantee it to them. Yielding to
</p>
<p>circumstances which he could no longer control. Gov. Dorr advised his friends
</p>
<p>to disperse, and then retired to another State. To use his own words, "The
</p>
<p>will of the people thus manifested was obeyed."
</p>
<p>The submission of the people to the Algerine government, instead of bringing
</p>
<p>peace, was the signal for the infliction upon the" friends of free suffrage of^he
</p>
<p>most cruel mdignities, and atrocious outrages ; unparalleled in this country,
</p>
<p>savm.^ under the " law and order" of the tories during the revolutionary war.

<p>orderly camp the press was silenced the people were robbed of their arms
</p>
<p>and other property, and some of the best men in the state were drao-o-ed to pri-
</p>
<p>son. Women were hurried before the courts and indicted for pretended of-
</p>
<p>fences ; but here the effrontery of the Algerines failed them, for they dared not
</p>
<p>bring the ladies to trial. Several of the most peaceful citizens were indicted
</p>
<p>Jor serving the peop e as moderators and clerks of town-meetings, and in other
</p>
<p>CIV. capacities Others, and among them Gov. Dorr, were indfcted for treason
</p>
<p>against the State of Rhode Island. Conscious of having committed no offence.
</p>
<p>Gov. Dorr returned to his native state, and was arrested at Providence on the
</p>
<p>^Ist day of October, 184-3, and taken to prison, whence in Februarv, 1844, he
</p>
<p>was taken to Newport and arraigned before the Supreme Court of the State on
</p>
<p>a charge of treason The trial upon this charge, if an examination upon such
</p>
<p>a charge before a Slate tribunal can be called a trial, resulted in a verdict of
</p>
<p>^"! ^V^l^l^ '''"m"^'; ^^ ^''^; ^"^^ " ^^'" -'^^' ^^y f J""e, 1844, as follows :
</p>
<p>1 hat the said Thomas W. Dorr be imprisoned in the State's Prison, at
</p>
<p>Providence, m the county of Providence, for the term of his natural life, and
</p>
<p>there kept at hard labor, in separate confinement."
</p>
<p>When asked by the clerk if he had anything to say why sentence should not
</p>
<p>then be pronounced against him, Gov. Dorr arose, and with that dignified self-
</p>
<p>possession for which he is so remarkable, briefly and cogently vindicated his
</p>
<p>ALGERINES IDENTIFIED. 5
</p>
<p>course, and the cause in which, with his associates, in perfect accordance with
</p>
<p>the principles of the revolution of '76, he had been engaged. It was here that
</p>
<p>the character of the man was more fully developed, and exhibited in all the
</p>
<p>beauty of its consistency. This was the crowning eflbrt of his labors in the cause
</p>
<p>of constitutional reform. It was the seal of his sincerity, and the enduring
</p>
<p>memorial of his fidelity.
</p>
<p>The idea of perpetual incarceration in a gloomy prison, known to have been
</p>
<p>peculiarly destructive to the human mind, could not shake the fortitude of Gov.
</p>
<p>Dorr. Equally above the reach of such influences, and superior to the tribunal
</p>
<p>about to pass sentence upon him, he reminded the court, in duty to himself,
</p>
<p>that he had not had a fair trial  that the place was justly exceptionable, if not
</p>
<p>unlawful ; the jury selected, not for their impartiality, but for their partisan
</p>
<p>hostility, and the case not permitted to be fully presented to them. That the
</p>
<p>jury were not permitted to judge of the law, nor to have it argued to them, nor
</p>
<p>to hear evidence in justification of the acts of the defendant. That several of
</p>
<p>the jurors had prejudged the case, and used violent and revengeful expressions
</p>
<p>against him. That the court, " m the hurry of this trial,'''' refused to hear the
</p>
<p>law argued to themselves ; to permit the defendant to prove the Constitution,
</p>
<p>or his election under it, or to repel charges of malicious motives. That this
</p>
<p>was a political trial, to gratify an insatiable spirit of revenge, and cut off his
</p>
<p>social and political existence. That although the sentence of the court in con-
</p>
<p>demning the acts of the defendant, will also condemn the principles upon which
</p>
<p>the Republic is based, yet it cannot " reach the man within.''^ It cannot affect
</p>
<p>the impartial judgment of his fellow citizens, nor deprive him of their affection-
</p>
<p>ate respect. Much less can it prevent them from reversing all the wrongs now
</p>
<p>committed.
</p>
<p>" From this sentence of the Court," said Gov. Dorr, in conclusion, " I ap-
</p>
<p>peal to the people of our State, and of our country. They shall decide between
</p>
<p>us. I commit myself without distrust to their final award. I have nothing
</p>
<p>more to say."
</p>
<p>The sentence of imprisonment for hfe was then pronounced by the Court,
</p>
<p>when Mr. Atwell read and offered a bill of exceptions for a writ of error from
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of the United States, against the ruling of the Court,
</p>
<p>" That treason might be committed against a separate vState." The Court

</p>
<p>ordered the bill to be entered on the minute book, and it makes a part of the
</p>
<p>record. " Mr. Atwell then moved the Court to suspend the execution of the
</p>
<p>sentence in order to await the decision of the case, by the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>the United States, upon a writ of error. The defendant," he said, " by the
</p>
<p>imprisonment which the sentence imposed, would be disabled from prosecuting
</p>
<p>his suit." The Court refused this request, remanded the defendant to prison,
</p>
<p>and adjourned for the term. Two days afterwards, on the 27th of June, Gov.
</p>
<p>Dorr was privately conveyed from Newport jail to the State Prison at
</p>
<p>Providence. Mr. Atwell and Mr. Turner, his responsible counsel, were at
</p>
<p>Newport at that time, but the removal was purposely concealed from them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Walter S. Burgess, who has since disclaimed responsibility as the counsel
</p>
<p>of Gov. Dorr, was permitted to accompany him in this hurried removal to the
</p>
<p>State Prison, under a pledge of secrecy, binding him to conceal the movement
</p>
<p>even from Messrs. Atwell and Turner, who ii-ere the responsible counsel.
</p>
<p>Having left Gov. Dorr at the door of the State Prison, Mr. Burgess was there-
</p>
<p>after denied all access to him, and treated by the Algerine Inspectors with as
</p>
<p>much indignity as though he had been one of the responsible counsel of the
</p>
<p>Governor, or had been faithless to his pledge to conceal the disgraceful and
</p>
<p>stealthy act of incarceration. These circumstances were not all known abroad
</p>
<p>when the appeal of Gov. Dorr was sent forth to the people of the Union. The
</p>
<p>6 THE HUNKERS AND
</p>
<p>press in Rhode Island was then far from being free, and many facts in the case
</p>
<p>were suppressed or misrepresented. But an American citizen had been
</p>
<p>doomed to civil death, for an alleged offence hitherto unknown in our Union 
</p>
<p>treason against a separate State, and had appealed to his fellow citizens against
</p>
<p>an illegal, an unjust trial and sentence. How were they to respond to this
</p>
<p>appeal ?
</p>
<p>Some diversity of opinion upon this point was to be expected. Political,
</p>
<p>action at the ballot-boxes ; a counter appeal to Judge Lynch for summary pror
</p>
<p>ceedings ; and an appeal by writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United
</p>
<p>States  were the remedies proposed. The former mode of operation was very
</p>
<p>generally approved, and resorted to. The latter was proposed by a few, but op-
</p>
<p>posed general!}^ by those who laid claim to more than ordinary sensibility upon
</p>
<p>the subject of State rights, and by a large proportion of the legal profession.
</p>
<p>Although those who talked about Judge Lynch, probably never meditated any
</p>
<p>other than a contingent and very remote resort to violence, and perhaps none at
</p>
<p>all, the Algerine authorities seemed to be more apprehensive of danger from
</p>
<p>this class of reformers than from both of the others.
</p>
<p>Having robbed the friends of free suffrage, men and women, of their arms,
</p>
<p>the Algcrines, by the aid of the terrors of martial law impending, felt confident
</p>
<p>of an easy victory at the ballot-boxes in Rhode Island. Nor were they much
</p>
<p>less confident of their power to prevent the case from going up to the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court oflhe United Slates by writ of error. This they had resolved upon, and
</p>
<p>they played most foully to accomplish it. They said the case should never go
</p>
<p>up to that court, if the authorities of Rhode Island could prevent it. They had
</p>
<p>flown high for legal advice. As high, perhaps, as counsel off the bench or oTt.
</p>
<p>the bench would allow them to go, either for money or love of " law and order."
</p>
<p>They said that Dorr should neither be permitted to see his counsel, nor sign,
</p>
<p>nor see, a petition for a writ of error !
</p>
<p>Did the authorities hurry Dorr from Newport and pledge Burgess to conceal
</p>
<p>the stealthy flight from Mr. Atwell, w^ho was there attending as a member, the
</p>
<p>session of the legislature, for the purpose of depriving Dorr of the aid of his
</p>
<p>counsel in preparing his petition for a writ of error.? Was this done to prevent
</p>
<p>Dorr from seeing his counsel, or from signing or seeing a petition for a writ of
</p>
<p>error .? If so, it was a conspiracy ! A conspiracy against Dorr, who, although

</p>
<p>by a fiction of law, is said to be civilly dead, still has rights, which may not be
</p>
<p>wrested from him with impunity. Did the authorities at Providence participate
</p>
<p>in this scientific, not to say artful movement .' May be they had no previous
</p>
<p>notice of it. They were ready to shut Dorr up in his cell when he came, and
</p>
<p>then turn around and spit contempt upon Burgess who had come with him.
</p>
<p>They have enough to answer for in the next paragraph.
</p>
<p>A conspiracy is a combination of men for an evil purpose. The Inspectors of
</p>
<p>the State Prison at Providence combined to prevent Dorr from seeing counsel,
</p>
<p>and from seeing or signing a petition for a writ of error. This was a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Conspiracies are various in kind and character, and differ in degree of legal and
</p>
<p>moral criminality. Whatever may be the consequences in a legal procedure.^
</p>
<p>of combining to deprive a man of his day to defend life or liberty in a court to
</p>
<p>which the Supreme law of the land gives him the right of appeal, there can be
</p>
<p>no question of the enormous moral turpitude of such an act. No man can justi-
</p>
<p>fy it. Dorr had this right, and all the authorities of Rhode Island knew that he
</p>
<p>desired and intended to exercise it. The Supreme Court knew it, and allowed
</p>
<p>one day, to prepare a bill of exceptions for that purpose. They were reminded
</p>
<p>of it again the next day, by Mr. Atweil's motion to suspend the execution of
</p>
<p>the sentence, and await the decision of the case by the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>United States, which motion they overruled, and Dorr was hurried off to the
</p>
<p>ALGERINES IDENTIFIED. 7
</p>
<p>State Prison ; as the authorities of R. I. say, civilly dead. Was Dorr civilly
</p>
<p>dead, while he had the right of appeal to a court which had power to reverse
</p>
<p>this sentence, and declare him innocent of the alleged crime ? Can the Court
</p>
<p>be justified in offering the slightest impediment to the exercise of that right ?
</p>
<p>Nay, more. Were they not bound in duty, by oath, and by the constitution
</p>
<p>and laws of the United States, to aid him in making his appeal, at least so far as
</p>
<p>to allow a reasonable time for the preparation of papers, and then to allow the
</p>
<p>writ of error, and see that the Chief Justice signed the usual citations to the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor and Attorney General of the State .'' A writ of error in such a case, is a
</p>
<p>writ of right. The constitution and laws of the Union recognize this right. It
</p>
<p>was as much the duty of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, to allow the writ
</p>
<p>of error and issue the citations, as it was the duty of the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>United States, or either of the Justices thereof, to allow and issue those pre-
</p>
<p>cepts. This question may yet prove to be one of serious import to the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of Rhode Island, unless the judges thereof can make it appear that they
</p>
<p>are absolved from, or have never taken the oath, to support the constitution and
</p>
<p>laws of the United States as the supreme law of the land, " anything in the con-
</p>
<p>stitution and laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." The question
</p>
<p>may at any time arise, upon a motion for a writ of habeas corpus, and a stay of
</p>
<p>proceedings on the judgment.
</p>
<p>By the act of the State of Rhode Island relative to the officers and discipline
</p>
<p>of the State Prison, the oversight and control of the prison is vested in a board
</p>
<p>of seven inspectors appointed annually by the General Assembly, who are au-
</p>
<p>thorized to make all necessary rules and regulations for the internal police of
</p>
<p>the prison : provided the same ai-e not inconsistent with law y which rules, &c., are
</p>
<p>to be entered in a book kept for the purpose, and a copy thereof given to the
</p>
<p>Warden and other officers of said prison. One of said board shall, at least once
</p>
<p>in every week, visit each prisoner, and in the absence of the warden and under-
</p>
<p>keepers, examine into his situation, hear any complaivls that he may make, see
</p>
<p>that the rules be strictly observed, and keep a record of all their meetings, week-
</p>
<p>ly visits, and complaints made to them by prisoners, whether well or ill-founded.
</p>
<p>The board of inspectors shall have full power over all prisoners, to enlarge their
</p>
<p>confinement, permitting more than one person to remain in a cell ; to have a
</p>
<p>nurse in sickness ; to go into the yard in the day-time ; admitting such commu-

<p>nication to and from their friends, and among themselves, and such books and
</p>
<p>other articles as they may deem expedient, &c.
</p>
<p>The warden of the prison shall keep a journal, in which he shall enter " all
</p>
<p>complaints that are made to him by the convicts," all punishments, &c., and
</p>
<p>visits of the inspectors and physicians. He shall see that the rules of the prison
</p>
<p>are strictly obeyed.
</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind, that the laws of the land are also the rules and
</p>
<p>regulations of the prison, as much as though they had been re-enacted by the
</p>
<p>inspectors and copied into the warden's journal. The inspectors, in making
</p>
<p>rules and regulations, are restricted to such as are not inconsistent with law.
</p>
<p>The law of the land authorizes Gov. Dorr, by himself or by his counsel, to carry his
</p>
<p>case by writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States for revision, and
</p>
<p>certainly to see and consult with his counsel in the case. The inspectors of the
</p>
<p>prison individually and collectively, by depriving Gov. Dorr of his right of ap-
</p>
<p>peal, have violated not only their prison regulations, but the laws of their State
</p>
<p>and of the United States. By combining together for the perversion or obstruc-
</p>
<p>tion of justice, or the due administration of the laws, the inspectors have been
</p>
<p>guilty of a conspiracy ; an offence indictable at common law. To conspire to
</p>
<p>pervert justice and equity has, in all ages, under all circumstances, been deem-
</p>
<p>ed a heinous offence. What then shall be said when the conspirators are pub-
</p>
<p>8 THE HUNKERS AND
</p>
<p>lie officers, appointed by the General Assembly of a State ? Magistrates au-
</p>
<p>thorized to make and execute laws ; to appoint officers and administer oaths to
</p>
<p>those officers to enforce the laws ! What an aggravation ! But this is not all.
</p>
<p>Who is the victim of the conspiracy ? A man at liberty, able to defend himself,
</p>
<p>provided with faithful counsel and means to pay them ? Alas ! Would to God
</p>
<p>it were so. If the conspirators are to be credited the victim is a dead man.
</p>
<p>Civilly dead ! A fiction in law ; a legal nonentity. A man who once" had
</p>
<p>counsel, responsible and irresponsible, one of whom followed him to the narrow
</p>
<p>house of his civil interment, and afterwards refused to have part or lot in the
</p>
<p>resurrection of his friend, because of the conspiracy of the seven magistrates
</p>
<p>aforesaid ! This is not the first time that Gov. Dorr has suffered severely from
</p>
<p>the neglect, and pusillanimous abandonment of his cause by his professed
</p>
<p>friends. It is impossible, in referring to the public acts of the inspectors of
</p>
<p>the State Prison at Providence, to treat them with that respect which it is desi-
</p>
<p>rable to cherish for the public officers of a State of this Union. They have
</p>
<p>chosen their course, and must meet the consequences. They appear to doubt
</p>
<p>the truth of their own declarations, and fear that their victim will not stay
</p>
<p>civilly dead. That, like the ghost of Banquo, he will uncivilly rise, with the mur-
</p>
<p>der upon his brow, and push them from their stools. Or like Falstaff, that
</p>
<p>Percy will rise from the dead, and prove a better counterfeit than himself.
</p>
<p>The late counsel of Gov. Dorr, too, must meet the consequences of the
</p>
<p>course they have elected to pursue. When their client was hurried to prison,
</p>
<p>their duty was plainly indicated by his last act ; an attempt to get his case re-
</p>
<p>vised by the Supreme Court of the United States. Thwarted in this, he made
</p>
<p>his appeal to the people of his state and country, and they have responded to
</p>
<p>that appeal ; in various modes, it is true, for variously have they interpreted
</p>
<p>his appeal.
</p>
<p>The National Reform Association of New York, seeing a man whom they
</p>
<p>believed to be not only unstained by crime, but one of the purest and best men
</p>
<p>in the land, incarcerated for life in the once hospitable region of Roger Williams,
</p>
<p>employed counsel to go to Rhode Island, and collect the facts of the case, with
</p>
<p>a view to send it by writ of error for revision, to the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>United States. This was their favorite mode of responding to Dorr's appeal.
</p>
<p>Indeed it was, in their view, the only way to secure justice to all parties con-

</p>
<p>cerned, and ensure a permanent settlement of all the questions that had arisen
</p>
<p>in the controversy, without a resort to violence.
</p>
<p>Their counsel found in existence in Rhode Island a most singular state of
</p>
<p>affairs, even among the professed friends of Gov. Dorr, and made due report
</p>
<p>thereof to the Society. His first brief note of the 27th July, 1844, stated that
</p>
<p>the case stood well for a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United
</p>
<p>States. Strange as it may seem, this position was generally doubted there,
</p>
<p>even by the friends of free suffrage. More than doubted  it was believed to
</p>
<p>be untrue ; a paradox. And this doctrine, that the case could not be carried up,
</p>
<p>was taught by the members of the legal profession generally, almost without
</p>
<p>exception. Gov. Dorr and his counsel had taken the ground of appeal by writ
</p>
<p>of error, in his defence before the Supreme Court of Rhode Island. And yet
</p>
<p>his counsel, after his incarceration, expressed strong doubts of being able to
</p>
<p>remove the case from Rhode Island. One of them said openly that he had no
</p>
<p>hope of being able to get the case up, unless the authorities of Rhode Island
</p>
<p>would consent to it, and the inspectors of the prison would permit the counsel
</p>
<p>to o-o in and consult with Gov. Dorr. That in case the inspectors should re-
</p>
<p>fuse such permission, he and his associates would abandon the case. The in-
</p>
<p>spectors did refuse oUch permission, and he abandoned the case accordingly, and
</p>
<p>ALGERINES IDENTIFIED. JP
</p>
<p>gave notice thereof to the counsel of the National Reform Association (See
</p>
<p>Mr. Treadwell's affidavit, p. 28.)
</p>
<p>To hear from the Algerines the doctrine that their state was too sovereign to
</p>
<p>admit of an appeal from their highest court upon even a constitutional question,
</p>
<p>and that their authorities would never allow such an appeal to be made, was
</p>
<p>no novelty. But to hear that doctrine from the professed friends of free suffrage ;
</p>
<p>from intelligent politicians, claiming great, nay, almost exclusive respect for the
</p>
<p>doctrine of " state rights ;" from grave counsellors at law; more especially
</p>
<p>from one of the counsel of Gov. Dorr, was a heresy, which, from that quarter,
</p>
<p>was regarded with no little surprise. The counsel of the National Reform
</p>
<p>Association did not fail to notice the tendency and effect of such a develop-
</p>
<p>ment. That individual, in accordance with the desire of the association which
</p>
<p>employed him, advised the friends of free suffrage in Rhode Island to make a
</p>
<p>statement of their wrongs, and publish it, with an appeal to their friends in other
</p>
<p>states, for such pecuniary aid as might be needful to enable them to obtain
</p>
<p>redress. Not seconded in this matter by their friends in R. I. and finding that
</p>
<p>the counsel of Gov. Dorr maintained a position not entirely free from a;nbi-
</p>
<p>guity, the Association relaxed its efforts to carry up the case, leaving their
</p>
<p>counsel free to act with the people of Rhode Island, as circumstances might
</p>
<p>require. An opportunity soon presented itself. The notice of Mr. Burgess
</p>
<p>that he had abandoned the case came very near the time of holding the great
</p>
<p>Mass Meeting on the 4th of September, and while the preparations for that
</p>
<p>meeting were the absorbing subject of thought and action. On the evening of
</p>
<p>the 5th Sept. at a special meeting called at the house of Doctor Davis, the
</p>
<p>" Banner Cottage," for the purpose, a proposition was made to the Benevolent
</p>
<p>Free Suffrage Society by the counsel of the N. R. Association, to carry up
</p>
<p>the case of Gov. Dorr by writ of error, and to provide necessary means. The
</p>
<p>proposition was not accepted. At the desire of many persons present, a meet-
</p>
<p>ing was called the next evening at the house of Mr. Henry Lord, and Mr
</p>
<p>Treadwell was invited to attend, and explain the mode of proceeding with the
</p>
<p>case, and to repeat his proposition. A large meeting M'as in attendance.
</p>
<p>Having repeated the notice from Mr. Burgess of his having abandoned the case,
</p>
<p>and stated the mode of proceeding for a writ of error, and other circumstances
</p>
<p>as detailed on the evening previous, an appeal was made to Mr. Treadwell to

</p>
<p>know if anything could be done in the matter, now that the case had been
</p>
<p>abandoned by Gov. Dorr's counsel. He replied yes. That the only real ob-
</p>
<p>stacle in the case was now removed. Before they abandoned the case, one of
</p>
<p>them, Mr. Burgess, had been repeatedly reminded that as counsel for Gov.
</p>
<p>Dorr, he could apply by petition to Judge Story for a writ of error as well
</p>
<p>without as with an interview, with Gov. Dorr ; but he replied as often, that
</p>
<p>Judge Story was as great an Algerine as any in Rhode Island, and that he
</p>
<p>would not apply to him, for that he knew it would be in vain.
</p>
<p>In reply to inquiries made at this meeting, Mr. Treadwell stated that the
</p>
<p>mode of proceeding for a writ of error was by petition from Gov. Dorr to
</p>
<p>Judge Story, the Circuit Judge, or to the court of which he v/as an associate
</p>
<p>justice. That since Gov. Dorr was not permitted to petition in person, nor to
</p>
<p>see his counsel, his counsel could sign the petition in his behalf, and it would
</p>
<p>undoubtedly be as effectual in procuring the writ of error. That as his coun-
</p>
<p>sel refused to do this, the signature of Gov. Dorr's father to such petition, and
</p>
<p>a power of attorney from him, was the step next to be recommended. If this
</p>
<p>should fail, let the next nearest relatives authorize the procedure, then the
</p>
<p>intimate friends in Providence, and next in succession the friends of Gov. Dorr
</p>
<p>in any part of Rhode Island. If all these sources should fail in succession,
</p>
<p>Mr. T. said he felt assured that persons fiorn other States would institute pro-
</p>
<p>10 THE HUNKERS AND
</p>
<p>ceedings as best they might ; and under the severe hardship of the case, till
</p>
<p>now unheard of in civilized society, an entire exclusion of counsel from a man
</p>
<p>who has the right of appeal to a tribunal fully empowered to revise his case,
</p>
<p>reverse his sentence, and establish his innocence, such interposition ought to be,
</p>
<p>and probably would be, recognized by a court, having jurisdiction of all cases
</p>
<p>in law and equiti/ arising under the Constitution. The meeting fully concurred
</p>
<p>in these suggestions. Acting thereon, several persons present took means to
</p>
<p>ascertain the views of Gov. Dorr's father and near relatives upon the subject.
</p>
<p>Finding that neither father nor relatives could be enlisted in an application for
</p>
<p>a writ of error, these and other individuals, citizens of Providence, united in
</p>
<p>employing Mr. Treadwell as their counsel, with liberty to employ such other
</p>
<p>counsel as he might desire to have associated with him in the defence of the
</p>
<p>suit. To these individuals, the idea of abandoning the case of Gov. Dorr
</p>
<p>wholly to persons from other states, was too revolting to be endured for a mo-
</p>
<p>ment. They resolved  that if father and mother, as his counsel had done,
</p>
<p>should abandon his case, or should petition his persecutors for a pardon on any
</p>
<p>terms, however disgraceful, and fatal to his future fame,  -they would joyfully
</p>
<p>respond to his appeal, and take up his case where he left it, when the Alge-
</p>
<p>rines, having induced one of his counsel to join them in concealing the
</p>
<p>movement from the other two, hurried him to the State Prison two days before
</p>
<p>the time, as understood by Messrs. Atwell and Turner. The men who stood
</p>
<p>by Gov. Dorr on Acote's hill, until they received his orders to disband and
</p>
<p>disperse, now encouraged their wives, children, and female friends, to form a
</p>
<p>society for the liberation of their faithful and beloved chief. Such was the
</p>
<p>origin of the Dorr Liberation Society of Rhode Island, which sprung from
</p>
<p>this meeting. At first it was organized by females. Mrs. A. H. Lord was
</p>
<p>chosen President, and Miss L. J. Follet, Secretary. Shortly afterwards, both
</p>
<p>male and female members were admitted. Mrs. B. Davis was chosen Vice
</p>
<p>President, Miss M. J. Dinsmore, Cor. Sec, and Mr. Wilbour Wheaton, Treas-
</p>
<p>urer, Mr. Stephen C. Kenyon, Surety. Its objects, as stated in the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, are,
</p>
<p>First By legal, constitutional and peaceful means, to elfectuate the liberation of Thomas
</p>
<p>Wilson Doir.
</p>
<p>Second  To re-assert and estabhsh the People's Constitution.

<p>Thikd  To induce the People of this Slate and Nation, to make themselves acquainted
</p>
<p>with the principles of the Constitution of the United .States, and to " preserve, pro-
</p>
<p>tect, and defend" the same.
</p>
<p>The following were the first
</p>
<p>PROCEEDINGS.
</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Dorr Liberation Society, held at the residence of Mrs. A. H. Lord,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of forming a Constitution, and for the choice of Officers, a committee of
</p>
<p>three, appointed for the purpose, reported the annexed Constitution, which was unanimous-
</p>
<p>ly adopted.
</p>
<p>Mrs. A H. Lord was chosen President, and Miss Louisa J. Follet, Recording Secretary.
</p>
<p>The following preamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted :
</p>
<p>Whereas certain citizens of Rhode Island have employed Gen. Samuel Fessenden, and
</p>
<p>Francis C. Treadwell, of the city of Portland, in the State of Maine, Counsellors at Law,
</p>
<p>to carry the case of the State of Rlwdc Island vs. Thomas W. Dorr, by writ of error to the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States, and believing that course to be the only mode of estab-
</p>
<p>lishing judicially, the principles of the People's Constitution, and the innocence of Gov.
</p>
<p>Dorr ;
</p>
<p>Be it Resolved, By the Dorr Liberation Society, that an appeal be made to the people of
</p>
<p>the United States, for their sympathy in the cause of Free Suffrage, and for pecuniary aid
</p>
<p>in continuing the defence of this suit.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That twelve thousand shares, or certificates of ten cents each, of contributions
</p>
<p>to the fund, to be raised for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the defence of this
</p>
<p>ALGERINES IDENTIFIED. 11
</p>
<p>suit, in the manner aforesaid, be immediately issued ; that the President of this vSociety be
</p>
<p>directed to prepare a suitable form and device, and issue the same forthwith, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of raising, as soon as may be, the amount of twelve hundred dollars thereon.
</p>
<p>Resolved. That the Dorr Liberation Society accept the offer of F. C. Treadwell, to furnish
</p>
<p>at the cost of printing them, any number of copies of the little book, entitled, ' Treason
</p>
<p>Defined," containing, besides a definition of treason, a copy of the Declaration of Indepen-
</p>
<p>dence, aiid a copy of the Constitution of the United States, and offer them for sale at the
</p>
<p>following prices : $30 00 per thousand, $4 00 per hundred, 6 cents per single copy ; terms
</p>
<p>cash on delivery.
</p>
<p>Auxiliary Societies, booksellers, and other persons, may be supplied, on application to
</p>
<p>the President of the Society, at her residence in Dean street, near Fountain street.
</p>
<p>The Dorr Liberation Societ}- of Rhode Island, thus constituted, iminediately
</p>
<p>set about a vigorous prosecution of its objects. The first thing to be done was
</p>
<p>to obtain a copy of the record of the trial, from the clerk of the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>at Newport. On repairing thither early in September, the Counsel of the So-
</p>
<p>ciety learned that the record had not then been made up. It was written in
</p>
<p>part in two books of minutes, but mostly upon detached papers, some of which,
</p>
<p>the clerk said, were not then in the office. [See Mr. Treadwell's affidavit.]
</p>
<p>The individuals composing the Societ}'', both before' and after its formation, ex-
</p>
<p>erted themselves to collect money to defray its expenses. The greater part of
</p>
<p>the contributions, which in amount were considerable, came from the pockets of
</p>
<p>the members.
</p>
<p>That the Algerines would be opposed to the course of the Society was to be
</p>
<p>expected. From the real, or from the pretended friends of Dorr and free suf-
</p>
<p>frage, no opposition could have been anticipated. But an opposition arose from
</p>
<p>one of these classes, first by cautious intimations, artful insinuations, and insidi-
</p>
<p>ous inuendoes. As these means failed of their intended effiict, a more bold
</p>
<p>course was pursued, until it became as .'systematic, virulent and reckless, as it
</p>
<p>was senseless  as bitter and blind as the persecution of the Algerines, and
</p>
<p>wanting nothing but the power, to render it as formidable. And why .? Be-
</p>
<p>cause the Dorr Liberation Society had resolved that the case of Gov. Dorr
</p>
<p>should go by writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States, at the
</p>
<p>then approaching term, and were taking efficient means to accomplish their
</p>
<p>purpose. Strange as these facts may aj^pear to the friends of Dorr and free

</p>
<p>suffrage in other States, they are nevertheless true.
</p>
<p>When, in July, 1S44, the Counsel of the National Reform Association went
</p>
<p>to Providence, the great body of the people, the friends* of Dorr as well as the
</p>
<p>A.lgerines, declared that the case could not be taken up for revision. That there
</p>
<p>was in fact no appeal from the Supreme Court of Rhode Island in the case of
</p>
<p>the State against one of its citizens, upon a constitutional question. And this
</p>
<p>was called the " State Rights" doctrine. It was taught and assented to, if not
</p>
<p>believed, by the Algerines ; taught by the lawyers of both parties, and gene-
</p>
<p>rally believed, and almost, or quite, universally /eare^i to be true, by the Dorr
</p>
<p>men. It was even said, by Walter S. Burgess, and other professed Dorr men,
</p>
<p>that Gov. Dorr himself was of the same opinion, and had no confidence in being
</p>
<p>able to carry up his case by writ of error. That Gov. Dorr had an agency in
</p>
<p>revising the State laws, particularly in that relating to State treason. | When told
</p>
<p>that the case could be carried up, and referred to the beaten track of judicial
</p>
<p>decisions upon constitutional questions of analogous character, the great body
</p>
<p>of the friends of Dorr heard the news with gladness and joy. But they had
</p>
<p>many doubts upon the subject until they knew that the writ of error was allow-
</p>
<p>ed, and the Supreme Court of Rhode Island had been cited to send up its re-
</p>
<p>cord, duly authenticated, for revision.

</p>
<p>Exceptions to this joy and gladness were not wanting among the professed
</p>
<p>friends of Gov Dorr. To a few such, the annunciation was as wormwood and
</p>
<p>,rall It seemed clear that they did not desire the case should go up at all, and
</p>
<p>were exceedingly anxious that it should not go up at the next term. It at
</p>
<p>that term a decision should he made, their fears amounted almost to assurance,
</p>
<p>that it would be against ^Ae/. And truly it might be agamst them, although m
</p>
<p>favor of Gov. Dorr, and the People. It has long been the misfortune ot this
</p>
<p><rentleman, to suffer severely from the acts of his professed friends. When the
</p>
<p>cartrido-e-hox was appealed to, these friends were neither killed nor wounded,
</p>
<p>but amon'T the missing, and some of them threatening to join the ranks oi the
</p>
<p>Alaerines" V/hen the ballot-box was appealed to, their ballots were missing,
</p>
<p>at least from the free suffrage boxes. If cast at all, they must have been cast
</p>
<p>for the Alo-erines. It might, perhaps, be easy to point them out and check their
</p>
<p>names, if one had a list of the applicants for office to the cominc/ administration.
</p>
<p>If Dorr's case had gone up, and been decided in his favor at the present term,
</p>
<p>as doubtless it would have been in case his counsel had been desirous to for-
</p>
<p>ward it. Dorr might have. been called upon by Mr. Polk and his friends lor
</p>
<p>certificates of character, political, physical and moral. In such case, some
</p>
<p>who, while Dorr is in prison, may consider their chance of success very tajr,
</p>
<p>would be sure to be rejected, if he should be called upon to state to whom he
</p>
<p>alluded in his defence before the Court, when he said they hesitated to employ
</p>
<p>the ballot-box " at the vitally important election in 1S43, as they had before
</p>

</p>
<p>among the applicants for oflace had cowered under the frowns of the Algermes ;
</p>
<p>who by their timidity in the performance of their duty, or their treacherous
</p>
<p>abandonment of Dorr and his cause, had driven him into exile, and pierced his

<p>ambidexterity, would not be able to deceive him or his faithful friends who have

<p>the appointing power. A puss in boots, a cat in old Harry's kitchen without

<p>Liberation Society, and sought to deprive them of the power of obtaining means
</p>
<p>to carry up the suit. Individually and collectively, with a few exceptions, the
</p>
<p>members of that cornmittee resorted to the most discreditable mean^to crush
</p>
<p>the efforts of the Society to liberate G ov. Dorr : means equally inconsistent
</p>
<p>with the characters of gentlemen, friends of humanity and free suffrage. Sev-
</p>
<p>eral members of that committee had long taught the doctrine that the case of
</p>
<p>Gov. Dorr could not be carried up for revision. Prophets upon a small scale,
</p>
<p>having prophesied disaster and defeat to the Dorr men, sought to fulfil their own
</p>
<p>predictions by proscription and dismay. Some good friends of Dorr at New-
</p>
<p>port had collected one hundred dollars, and sent it directed to the Dorr Libera-
</p>
<p>tion Society at Providence. The messenger fell in with the Hunkers of the
</p>
<p>State Central Committee, and their cronies, who, by artful falsehood, persuaded
</p>
<p>him to carry the money back with him to Newport. This w^as at the time an
</p>
<p>annoyance to the Society, but the triumph of the miscreants was short-lived.
</p>
<p>The good men of Newport, one of whom was a member of the State Central
</p>
<p>Committee, though not in the confidence of the Hunkers, nor warned to attend
</p>
<p>their meetings, made due inquiry, and sent hack the money with interest, and a
</p>
<p>notice that they should ferret out the Himkerism which had annoyed them so
</p>
<p>much, and try to discover the " connecting linP'' between the Hunkers and the
</p>

<p>chief, formed a Dorr Liberation Society, auxiliary to the Society at Providence,
</p>
<p>and rendered etficient service in the cause, in word and deed ; in contributions
</p>
<p>of money ; and what was not less valuable in developing the villany, the hypo-
</p>
<p>cnsy, and the treachery of the Hunkers.
</p>
<p>Before the Dorr Liberation Society was organized, the persons who formed
</p>
<p>it had resolved to appeal to the people abroad to contribute in small sums the
</p>
<p>needful means to pay the expenses of the further defence of the suit. About
</p>
<p>the middle of August, it was decided to publish small books, containing the
</p>
<p>Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and a short
</p>
<p>definition of Treason, entitled "Treason Denned," and sell them at ten cents
</p>
<p>each. The work was stereotyped, and the cost of the books each would be so
</p>
<p>small as to yield at that price a large profit, which was to be regarded rather in
</p>
<p>the light ot a donation than as the value ofJ the book. Yet there was substan-
</p>
<p>tial value m the book ; in a pocket copy of the Declaration of Independence,
</p>
<p>and Constitution of the United States, if there was none in the article upon
</p>
<p>Treason. It was deemed, too, a good deed, and well-timed, to endeavor at so
</p>
<p>little cost, to difi'use a knowledge of the Constitution, and promote a discussion
</p>
<p>of It in connexion with the subject of Treason, by putting it in the power of
</p>
<p>every one to carry the book in his pocket, and if possible, get it introduced into
</p>
<p>schools. One m.ember of the State Central Committee subscribed for 1 00 copies
</p>
<p>of the book in August, on a paper being up in the office of the Republican
</p>
<p>Herald where the committee usually held their meetings. Other members of
</p>
<p>the committee v/ere made acquainted with the objects of the publication, and
</p>
<p>if thei/ did not seek to defeat them, many persons usually acting in concert with
</p>
<p>them, did, particularly the intimate friends of Walter S. Burgess. Their op-
</p>
<p>position was made both to the object, the appeal by writ of et-ror, and to the
</p>
<p>collection of means to sustain it. This opposition of the State Central Com-
</p>
<p>mittee and their clique, who had never been guilty of sustaining the cause by
</p>
<p>resorting to the cartridge-box, was now openly manifested, although some de-
</p>
<p>gree of disguise was occasionally deemed expedient. Finding that the feeling
</p>
<p>m favor of the writ of error in Dorr's case, was too strong to be crushed, how-
</p>
<p>ever it might, by intrigue and insolence, be repressed, the clique sought to di-
</p>
<p>vert this feeling, and turn it in another direction. An opportunity to do it was
</p>
<p>now discovered.

<p>Martin Luther had been convicted of the crime against Algerine " law and
</p>
<p>order," of presiding as Moderator at a town meeting, and sentenced to impri-
</p>
<p>sonment SIX months, and to pay a fine of five hundred dollars. At a meeting
</p>
<p>at the Franklin Hall on the 20th Sept., 1844, it ^vas decided that a scrip, or
</p>
<p>Liberty Stock, in sums of ten cents, be issued by the State Central Committee,
</p>
<p>to raise means to pay Luther's fine, and bring him out to influence the elections
</p>
<p>txien pending. The object, so far as respected the elections, and Luther, M^as
</p>
<p>good and praiseworthy, and the means, under the circumstances, laudable also.
</p>
<p>Luther had been faithful to Dorr, and the People's Constitution. Like Dorr he
</p>
<p>had gono^to prison, and, if need be, was ready to suffer death for the cause of
</p>
<p>truth His term of imprisonment had expired before the meeting was called
</p>
<p>together, and although he had a family anxious for his return, not a murmur es-
</p>
<p>caped from his hps, or was heard from his family. It was a singular fact that
</p>
<p>Luther s term of imprisonment was suffered to expire without an effort on the
</p>
<p>part of this clique of office-seekers, who knew he was unable to pay his fine,
</p>
<p>to relieve him. Luther had a case in the Circuit Court of the United Stales in
</p>
<p>Rhode Island, which involved the validity of the People's Constitution, and the
</p>
<p>points of law having been, pro forma, ruled against him, his counsel, B. F.
</p>
<p>Hallet, Esq., had taken steps, or was about to take them, to carry up the case
</p>
<p>14 THE HUNKERS AND
</p>
<p>to the Supreme Court, at Washington. To deliver a man Hke Luther from
</p>
<p>prison, and to provide him with ample means to pay liberal fees to his counsel,
</p>
<p>"was a judicious movement, and would not have been unworthy of Mr. Hallet,
</p>
<p>if the plan had originated with him. When sympathy for Luther was so fully
</p>
<p>aroused, how did it happetl that no means were proposed to carry up Dorr's
</p>
<p>case for revision ? Dorr was sentenced for life. Luther for six months. Dorr
</p>
<p>had been as faithful to the People's Constitution as Luther, and was in every
</p>
<p>respect as worthy of public consideration. How then did it happen that no
</p>
<p>means were proposed at that meeting to liberate Dorr, by carrying up his case,
</p>
<p>as well as Luther's ? Was Dorr forgotten at the meeting } No : Mr. Hallet
</p>
<p>talked about him most eloquently ! So eloquently as to arouse the clerk of the
</p>
<p>Algerine Court from his slumbers in the orchestra. If the clerk did not respond
</p>
<p>amen ! to Mr. Hallet's appeals, the "Hunkers of the committee did, which shows
</p>
<p>they could not have wholly forgotten Dorr. Why then did they not take mea-
</p>
<p>sures to carry up his case ? The reason is obvious. They did not desire to have
</p>
<p>it go up at all ; or if at all, not at the then next term of Court. The reason
</p>
<p>has been given before. It might be fatal to their schemes of ofFice-begging, and
</p>
<p>expose their duplicity, their faithless desertion of Dorr's principles.
</p>
<p>The doctrines of the Hunkers, though not made for the occasion, were seized
</p>
<p>upon for the occasion. They taught that the case of Dorr could not be carried
</p>
<p>up, because it was the suit of a State against an individual. That there was no
</p>
<p>appeal, by writ of error or otherwise, from the Supreme Court of a State. Mr,
</p>
<p>Hallet himself had taught the same doctrine about a month before, and probably
</p>
<p>adhered to it then. He said emphatically, that the case of Dorr could not be
</p>
<p>taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, for the reason above stated ;
</p>
<p>and when told that this case could go up, and how it could go up, and was re-
</p>
<p>ferred to authorities, to decisions of the Supreme Court in the cases of Cohens
</p>
<p>V. Virginia^ and .Martin v. Hunter, he petulantly replied, that the case of Dorr
</p>
<p>could not be got up to the vSupreme Court of the United States in any manner.
</p>
<p>Whether these opinions were or were not the means of recommending Mr.
</p>
<p>Hallet as a suitable person to take charge of the application for a writ of error,
</p>
<p>doth not appear. If such was the fact, how sadly disappointed must the Hunk-
</p>
<p>ers have been, when they found his application to the Supreme Court for a writ
</p>
<p>of error in this very Dorr case, successful. And yet this heresy, that upon a

<p>judgment or decree in any suit in the highest Court of a State, where is drawn
</p>
<p>in question the validity of a State act on the ground of its being repugnant to
</p>
<p>the constitution or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of
</p>
<p>such its validity, cannot be re-examined and affirmed or reversed by the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of the United States, was taught by the Hunkers as the genuine " State
</p>
<p>Hights'''' doctrine, and endorsed, as they said, by all their lawyers. Nay, more.
</p>
<p>By Gov. Dorr himself! That gentleman had, to be sure, in his defence, taken
</p>
<p>the ground, that the Treason Act of Rhode Island was repugnant to the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the United States, and hence void. That the People's Constitution
</p>
<p>was duly ratified, and hence justified him in all his acts under it. These points
</p>
<p>clearly appear upon the record. The first point was supported by Mr. Turner
</p>
<p>and by Gov. Dorr ; by the latter gentleman with great eloquence and ability.
</p>
<p>The other point was overruled, but it is clearly set down upon the record.
</p>
<p>Gov. Dorr himself made this defence, and put forth all the energy of his mind
</p>
<p>to sustain it by argument. Up to the time of his incarceration, he struggled to
</p>
<p>have it placed conspicuously upon the record, and there it stands, an imperisha-
</p>
<p>ble memento of his legal science. But this, the Hunkers say, is all bagatelle.
</p>
<p>That Gov. Dorr himself does not believe in it, has no confidence in it, and
</p>
<p>" don't mean anything by it.''^ " He only says so ; he does not mean so." That
</p>
<p>this defence is only a ruse, to perplex the Algerines. That Gov. Dorr does not
</p>
<p>ALGERINES IDENTIFIED. I5
</p>
<p>wish to have the case carried to Washington, and never intended to have it
</p>
<p>taken there. That it might take five years to get a decision upon the case, and
</p>
<p>operate to the prejudice of Gov. Dorr in obtaining a pardon from the Le<risla-
</p>
<p>ture of the State of Rhode Island. "
</p>
<p>And this doctrine, be it repeated, duphcity and all, these wiseacres say, is to
</p>
<p>be taken as the pure " State Rights " doctrine, and the teachers of it are to be
</p>
<p>taken and deemed to be " State Rights " men, par excellence ! Worse than
</p>
<p>all that, Governor Dorr, they say, is a " State Rights" man, of this stamp !
</p>
<p>As if great national rights, and still greater individual rights, the rights of life
</p>
<p>and liberty, were all merged in two words, " State Rights ;" which, as a cant
</p>
<p>phrase, have become a cloak to conceal and justify the practice of every
</p>
<p>enormity. ^
</p>
<p>The Hunkers are not alone in maintaining these doctrines. The great body
</p>
<p>of the Algerines maintain them also. Dorr and the great body of free sufFrao-e
</p>
<p>men and women, have resisted them with unwavering constancy, for five years
</p>
<p>at least. The Dorr men go for securing to the States, all the riohts of the
</p>
<p>States, and no more. For securing to the Nation all the rights of the Nation,
</p>
<p>and no more. For securing to individuals, all the rights of individuals, and
</p>
<p>except by force, will submit to nothing short of such security, whether de-
</p>
<p>manded by the old " Law and Order " Algerines, or by the new patent " State
</p>
<p>Rights " Hunker Algerines
</p>
<p>Between these two parties, there are some differences, important to them-
</p>
<p>selves, but not very important to the great body of free suffrage people, who
</p>
<p>vastly outnumber both of the Algerine factions as will be fully proved whenever
</p>
<p>Dorr shall come out and unite them. These differences of the Alcrerines are
</p>
<p>differences, not of principle, for the principles of both are identica! ; but of
</p>
<p>position. The " Law and Order " Algerines are in power, and bask in its
</p>
<p>benefits. The Hunker Algerines are striving to oust their " Law and Order "
</p>
<p>brethren, and seize upon the spoils of office. The " Law and Order " 41o-erines
</p>
<p>want to keep Dorr grinding in the cells, and so do the Hunker Algerines, at
</p>
<p>least till the offices are filled under the new administration. The " Law and
</p>
<p>Order " Algerines are opposed to carrying up the case of Dorr by writ of error
</p>
<p>and so are the Hunker Algerines. The " Law and Order " Algerines are at
</p>
<p>war with the Dorr Liberation Society, and so are the Hunker Algerines. In

</p>
<p>this latter particular, the Hunkers have practised to the full the villany so lono-
</p>
<p>taught by their examples, if they have not " bettered the instruction." ^
</p>
<p>The " Law and Order " Algerines, when forced by the distant thunders of
</p>
<p>public opinion, peafing upon their madness in conspiring against Dorr's rio-ht of
</p>
<p>appeal by writ of error, call in Burgess, who, faithful to his pledge to conceal
</p>
<p>the atrocious act of removing Dorr to the State Prison, from Messrs. Atwell
</p>
<p>and Turner, and faithless to his client in abandoning his cause, because the
</p>
<p>Inspectors refused him admission to the cell of Dorr afterwards, again becomes
</p>
<p>the confidential, if not the irresponsible counsellor of the oft betrayed Dorr.
</p>
<p>And in all this, the Hunkers entirely concur with their prototypes the " Law
</p>
<p>and Order " Algerines. Both divisions of the Algerine army ao-ree that the
</p>
<p>case shall not go up, if both combined can prevent ft, by the destruction of the
</p>
<p>Dorr Liberation Society. But when both are forced to yield to the infiexible
</p>
<p>perseverance of that little band of Dorrite men and women, both unite as cor-
</p>
<p>dially as did Pilate and Herod, in recalling Burgess to resume his functions 
</p>
<p>whether of responsibility, or of tV-responsibility, doth not yet very clearly ap-
</p>
<p>pear. Both parties of Algerines agree that Dorr's cause sliall be committed to
</p>
<p>a man who says that neither himself nor his client has any faith in his defence'
</p>
<p>lo a man who openly said, that carrying the ca.se up by writ of error might

</p>
<p>The Dorr Liberation Society, finding Dorr's cause deserted by Burgess and
</p>
<p>the Hunkers, persevered in their efforts to sustain it, and issued certificates of
</p>
<p>contributions to the fund for that purpose, according to the resolutions herein-
</p>
<p>before siven (page 10). Until now, the Society had been composed of females
</p>
<p>only, to calm the perturbed spirits of the Algerines, by assurances that none
</p>
<p>but peaceful means were contemplated ; and also to give them all the assur-
</p>
<p>ance that woman's devotion and a mother's love could afford, that it would
</p>
<p>not be in the power of faithless, treacherous man, to turn them from their pur-
</p>
<p>pose, by betraying afresh the suffering victim. A new set of missionaries all
</p>
<p>at once sprung up in the interest of one or the other division of the Algerines,
</p>
<p>in the shape of a sort of " Cowboys,"* who went to the ladies, and by a species
</p>
<p>of flattery, accompanied by coaxing, teasing, insinuating, menacing remon-
</p>
<p>strance, endeavored to intimidate and drive them to abandon their cause, and
</p>
<p>cease to issue their certificates of contributions, and recal such as had been
</p>
<p>issued. The rallying questions of the ladies about cartridge-box, ballot-box,
</p>
<p>and possibly sauce-box adventures and misadventures, deeds done and /com/ to
</p>
<p>be done, silenced the " Cowboys," and drove them, like lacerated hounds and
</p>
<p>snarling curs, back to their kennels. In this extremity, the falsely-styled De-
</p>
<p>mocratic State Central Committee, whose aid had been duly invoked by the
</p>
<p>galled jades, interposed with their Bull, as follows :

<p>Mrs. Abby H. Lord,

<p>suade her from any issue of the contemplated Dorr Liberation Stock, and to request her, if
</p>
<p>any has been issued, to call it in ; and that if the Society persist in their proposed plan, the
</p>
<p>Chairman of said Committee cause a notice of disapprobation to be pubUshed in the Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic newspapers."
</p>
<p>The above is an expression of opinion by Democrats, who are friends of Governor Dorr;
</p>
<p>and I presume that I need add nothing to induce you to comply with their declared wishes.
</p>
<p>Very respectfully.
</p>
<p>Your obedient Servant,
</p>
<p>W. R. Danforth,
</p>
<p>Chah-man Dem. St. Cen. Committee.
</p>
<p> Never let it be said hereafter that there are not courageous men in Rhode
</p>
<p>Island. These men may not, indeed, have taken up arms in support of the
</p>
<p>People's Constitution. They may not even have taken up their quills in sup-
</p>
<p>port of it, after having been forbidden to do so by the Algerines, Hunker, or
</p>
<p>" Law and Order." This, if true, would be no evidence of want of courage
</p>
<p>on their part, but rather of discipline and due subordination. That they are
</p>
<p>men of courage in an eminent degree, is proven by their Bull. No body of

<p>* During the Revolution, Cow&oys were petty spies or scouts between armies or parties at
</p>
<p>variance ; pretending to be the friends of both parties by turns, as they went from one camp

</p>
<p>men, however numerous, M)e//-appointed, well-armed, and well-commanded,
</p>
<p>destitute of that essential element of the soldier  the Algerine soldier  would
</p>
<p>dare to attack a Society of Ladies ! a Society of Dorr Liberation Ladies ! en-
</p>
<p>gaged in the holy cause of taking up Dorr's appeal to them, precisely where he
</p>
<p>left it, and carrying it where, in struggling to send it, he met worse than death,
</p>
<p>civil death, upon the cross of conspiracy and treachery  humation alive !
</p>
<p>incarceration in the State Prison ; forbidden to see father or mother, friend or
</p>
<p>counsel, while yet, as is now proved, he had the right of an appeal to the
</p>
<p>highest civil tribunal in the land !
</p>
<p>In this situation, when the Judas Iscariots had sold him, and the Simon Peters
</p>
<p>and Simon Sorcerers had fled from him in dismay, the Ladies' Dorr Liberation
</p>
<p>Society espoused his cause. And this is the time, and this is the Society of
</p>
<p>Ladies, that General Danforth, armed cap-a-pie, with all his troops on paper,
</p>
<p>and in paper, duly heralded by the terrors of an advanced guard of Old Harri's
</p>
<p>long nines, bravely marches forth to attack ! If General Danforth had all the
</p>
<p>original capital of Robert Morris's bank at his command to wit : no money
</p>
<p>no rations, and three hundred hogsheads of rum it would puzzle him to collect'
</p>
<p>even upon paper, an army of more prowess. General Danforth must not en-
</p>
<p>gross all the honor of this brave exploit. Let him publish his roster and com-
</p>
<p>pany rolls, and let every ral, and rat, et tatterdemalion, have his meed of praise,
</p>
<p>glory, and pap. If he wait till the appointments are made, he may have to
</p>
<p>march through Coventry with but a lank corporal's guard, or a hollow square
</p>
<p>m the Herald. ^
</p>
<p>Thus attacked, and threatened with the fulmination of other Bulls in the
</p>
<p>" democratic newspapers," the Ladies of the Dorr Liberation Society laid the
</p>
<p>case before their husbands and other male friends, and invited them to join the
</p>
<p>Society. The latter promptly responded to this call, and the Society, with
</p>
<p>increased numbers and vigor, moved on, as it had begun, harmoniously in the
</p>
<p>pursuit of Its objects. The idea of identifying the Hunker-Algerines of the
</p>
<p>State Central Committee exclusively with the democratic cause, was an artifice
</p>
<p>too shallow to deceive the people of Rhode Island. Every member of the
</p>
<p>Dorr Liberation Society, male and female, was a democrat, not merely in
</p>
<p>name, but in principle and practice. In the important Presidential Election then
</p>
<p>pending and now so gloriously consummated, they performed a conspicuous

<p>At JNewport, certain Hunkers, who have never been guilty of treason against
</p>
<p>the Algennes, nor of having been incarcerated with Dorr for faithful adherence
</p>
<p>to the People's Constitution, insisted upon not having Dorr's name uijon a flag
</p>
<p>which they raised in honor of Polk and Dallas. A heavy gale of wind soon
</p>
<p>arose, when Boreas pierced the flag with his numerous arrows, and blew it to
</p>
<p>atoms. Another pole and flag was raised, duly dedicated and inscribed, " Polk
</p>
<p>and Dallas; Dorr and Liberty." Boreas flung abroad its folds in beautiful
</p>
<p>display, and there it waved until the elections ended in triumph ; showing that
</p>
<p>Boreas was in favor of Polk and Dallas, but not without the free sufiraee qua-
</p>
<p>hfication of Dorr and Liberty for the basis of their administration,
</p>
<p>.u l^l ^^^^^^ ^ ^^^ Hunkers, " that if the Society persist in their proposed plan,
</p>
<p>the Chairman of said Committee cause a notice of disapprobation to be pub-
</p>
<p>lished in the democratic newspapers," had no terrors in it for the Society.
</p>
<p>Ihey sought to have their proposed plan, the release of Dorr through the aid
</p>
<p>ot a writ of error, and the difl:'usion of all possible knowledge of the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution and Laws of the United States, particularly the right of bearing arms
</p>
<p>the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and other important rights which
</p>
<p>18 THE HUNKERS AND
</p>
<p>had been trodden down by the Algerines  published in the democratic newspa-
</p>
<p>pers. They published their " proposed plan," their constitution and proceed-
</p>
<p>ings, in the Gazette, and paid for it. They requested the Herald to publish
</p>
<p>them on the same terms, cash down ; but that organ of the Hunkers could not
</p>
<p>be induced to do it for love, money, nor hatred. The Committee dared not to
</p>
<p>publish the " proposed plan" in the Herald, and then follow it with a notice
</p>
<p>of their disapprobation in the same paper. The people would be able then to
</p>
<p>compare them. They would be sure to approve the " proposed plan," and ask
</p>
<p>what objection the State Central Committee, if they had any democracy or
</p>
<p>Dorrism about them, could possibly have to its most speedy consummation.
</p>
<p>This course would have exhibited the cloven foot of the Hunkers in all its de-
</p>
<p>formity. They might as well have published in their organ that the Herald had
</p>
<p>been sold to the " Law and Order " Algerines for fifteen hundred dollars ; and
</p>
<p>that the money, having been planked with the proposition to purchase,* with
</p>
<p>liberty to keep it over night, and dream upon it, and sleep upon it if possible,
</p>
<p>was a boon too tempting to be refused.
</p>
<p>The " proposed plan" of the Dorr Liberation Society, was hailed with joy
</p>
<p>wherever it was known, throughout the country, saving by the Algerines. To
</p>
<p>both divisions of that corps, the mere proposition was alarming, but perhaps
</p>
<p>more immediately so to the Hunkers.
</p>
<p>The Dorr Liberation Society, after vexatious detentions of about six weeks,
</p>
<p>obtained a copy of the record of the trial of the case, duly authenticated by the
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Supreme Court at Newport, and proceeded to draw up their pa-
</p>
<p>pers. They well knew that it was desirable to commence with a petition signed
</p>
<p>by Gov. Dorr in person, but as all access to him had been denied, they had no
</p>
<p>expectation of being able to obtain his signature in any very short time. Still,
</p>
<p>the regular steps were to be taken, and evidence of the denial of one right was
</p>
<p>deemed to be good ground for demanding another, or for the allowance of the
</p>
<p>original right to the writ of error, upon the best application that circumstances
</p>
<p>would admit of obtaining.
</p>
<p>On the 11th of Nov., 1S44, Mr. Treadwell, of counsel for the Society, made
</p>
<p>a written application to the Mayor of Providence, for liberty, in company with
</p>
<p>Gen. Fessenden, associate counsel, to visit Gov. Dorr, and confer with him upon
</p>
<p>all matters needful for his defence. A few days after this request was made,

</p>
<p>the counsel of the Society called on the chairman of the Board of Inspectors,
</p>
<p>and left a petition with him, with a request that Gov. Dorr might see it, and
</p>
<p>have liberty to sign it. His verbal and written reply, both in the negative, will
</p>
<p>be found in the affidavit of Gen. Fessenden, and in the copy of the letter an-
</p>
<p>nexed thereto, in the report of the case.
</p>
<p>The Mayor of Providence returned the petition that had been left with him
</p>
<p>on the 18th of Nov., on the evening of the same day. That petition was im-
</p>
<p>mediately taken to Mr. Sullivan Dorr, the father of Gov. Dorr, and left with
</p>
<p>him for his signature, full explanations of the objects of the Society having been
</p>
<p>made to him. Mr. Dorr expressed favorable opinions in relation to the course
</p>
<p>the Society had taken, and said he would consult his counsel upon the subject.
</p>
<p>The next morning Mr. Dorr returned the petition unsigned, and declined giving
</p>
<p>a reason for not having signed it ; but said that, at some future time, he might
</p>
<p>be able to give such a reason. Mr. Dorr expressed great indignation at the
</p>
<p>treatment his son received from the Inspectors of the prison. He had signed
</p>
<p>memorials to the Legislature to pardon his son, but he would not sign a petition
</p>
<p>* Such a proposal was made b}' the Algerines, accompanied with the mone)^, ahout
</p>
<p>$1500, as was said; urging the proprietor to keep the money over night, and consider of it
</p>
<p>seriously. The proposition, it is understood, has been declined, and the money returned ;
</p>
<p>whether through the State Central Committee, or otherwise, is unknown to the writer.
</p>
<p>ALGERINES IDENTIFIED. I9
</p>
<p>to the Supreme Court of the United States, for a writ of error, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of justifying his son, and establishing his innocence. Mr. Dorr had previously
</p>
<p>expressed the apprehension, that any attempt to carry up the case by writ of
</p>
<p>error would tend to his son's prejudice in an application for a pardon. On this
</p>
<p>subject, his remarks were in concurrence with the sentiments expressed by
</p>
<p>Walter S. Burgess, Esq.
</p>
<p>The Dorr Liberation Society regretted exceedingly this determination of the
</p>
<p>father, to withhold his signature from a petition to carry the case where the soa
</p>
<p>had labored so hard, so ably, and so long, to have it go. The more so, inas-
</p>
<p>much as a judicial magistrate of the highest character in the country, was be-
</p>
<p>lieved to have expressed the opinion, that the authorities of Rhode Island had
</p>
<p>no right to prevent Gov. Dorr from signing a petition for a writ of error ; and
</p>
<p>further, that under the circumstances, the signature of the father of Gov. Dorr
</p>
<p>to the petition, would be, and ought to be, deemed sufficient to allow the writ
</p>
<p>of error, if a case of jurisdiction should be presented.
</p>
<p>The next step was to get the petition signed by citizens of Providence.
</p>
<p>Here there was no difficulty. At a late hour in the evening, when it was pro-
</p>
<p>posed to have the petition so signed, more than forty citizens of Providence
</p>
<p>were collected in a few minutes at the " Banner Cottage," who were happy to
</p>
<p>have an opportunity to see and sign such a petition. Had it been desirable to
</p>
<p>obtain more signatures, hundreds, aye, thousands of the citizens of that city,
</p>
<p>where Gov. Dorr was so well known, would gladly have added theirs. This
</p>
<p>petition, for prudential reasons,* was addressed " To the Chief Justice and As-
</p>
<p>sociate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, holden at Washing-
</p>
<p>ton," and in this shape was shown to one of those Justices. It has been stated,
</p>
<p>probably on good grounds, that the Justice referred to, after inquiring the reason
</p>
<p>why Gov. Dorr's father had not signed the petition, remarked, that if instead
</p>
<p>of having been addressed to the Court, it had, with the evidence exhibited of the
</p>
<p>exclusion of counsel, which he pronounced to be unlawful, been addressed to
</p>
<p>himself, he should have cited the authorities of Rhode Island to show cause
</p>
<p>why the writ of error should not be allowed. The term of the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>was now too near at hand, to admit of making such citation returnable before
</p>
<p>the close of that term, and the application was made to that Court at Wash-
</p>
<p>ington early in December.

<p>It is impossible to describe the consternation which now reigned in the ranks
</p>
<p>of both divisions of the " Identified." Before the record was obtained, it was
</p>
<p>confidently and tauntingly said that it never would be obtained. Now, it was
</p>
<p>manifest that a serious movement for a writ of error was in due proo-ress.
</p>
<p>Every cow-boy and scout of the Hunkers was put upon duty to watch the
</p>
<p>movements of the Dorr Liberation Society and their counsel, and make due re-
</p>
<p>port ; and the reports came so thick, and so fatal to their hopes, that the coun-
</p>
<p>tenances of the Hunkers, like those of the " Law and Orders," sank down to
</p>
<p>the brink of despair. Each dynasty (for both are sovereign and admit of noth-
</p>
<p>ing but subjects under them) was, by itself, tremendously alarmed, and this
</p>
<p>alarm acted and reacted upon both houses of the identities. And they had good
</p>
<p>reason to be alarmed. Both factions were conspirators. Both had conspired
</p>
<p>to produce the same result, the perpetual imprisonment of Dorr. By different
</p>
<p>means ; but tending to the same end. The one by excluding counsel, and the
</p>
<p>other by threatening beforehand, that unless they were admitted, they would
</p>
<p>abandon the case. You shall not see Dorr, said the " Law and Order" Alge-
</p>
<p>* The prudential reasons were in part, that the magistrate had been represented by both
</p>
<p>" Law and Order" Algerines, and Hunker Algerines, to be decidedly averse to having the
</p>
<p>case "go up." Burgess and his associates repeatedly stated that they /tm' he would not
</p>
<p>allow the writ of error. Another proof of the identity of the two dynasties of the Algerines.
</p>
<p>20 THE HUNKERS AND
</p>
<p>rines." Then, as we told you before, we will abandon the case, and do nothing
</p>
<p>about the writ of error, replied the Hunker Identities. Both Divans kept their
</p>
<p>word to each othtr^ as faithfully as Burgess kept his pledge to conceal Dorr's
</p>
<p>removal. Both were false to Dorr. Neither had occasion to exclaim,
</p>
<p>" A plague upon't! when " Algerines " can't be true to each other."
</p>
<p>Both factions assailed the Dorr Liberation Society, with all the virulence which
</p>
<p>malice could engender, and both have their reward in disappointment and de-
</p>
<p>feat.
</p>
<p>Early in December, 1844, Mr. Tread well, of counsel for the Society, took the
</p>
<p>papers to Washington, and on the 11th of that month, on the tenth day of the
</p>
<p>term, presented a motion with the record, and three affidavits, to the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of the United States, for a writ of habeas corpus, to bring out Governor
</p>
<p>Dorr to Washington, and enable him to sign a petition for a writ of error ; or to
</p>
<p>allow the writ of error.* Shortly afterwards, the Court informed the Counsel
</p>
<p>of the Society that on Friday, the 20th of December, the day assigned for the
</p>
<p>consideration of motions, they would hear him in support of his motion. On
</p>
<p>that day the motion was argued by Mr. Treadweli. On Friday the 27th, Mr.
</p>
<p>Justice McLean delivered the opinion of the Court, overruling the motion. |
</p>
<p>The motion for the writ of^ habeas corpus was denied, because, in the opinion of
</p>
<p>a majority of the Court, the act of the Congress of 1789 did not authorize them
</p>
<p>to bring out from confinement under a State process, civil or criminal, any per-
</p>
<p>son for any other purpose than to be examined as a witness. By this decision,
</p>
<p>if a person indicted for treason against the United States, should get some one
</p>
<p>to imprison him under process from any State, for a debt of five dollars, fictitious
</p>
<p>or real, no process from any authority of the United States could arrest him. J
</p>
<p>The motion for a writ of earor was denied, by a majority of the court,
</p>
<p>because the counsel did " not act under the authority of Dorr, but at the
</p>
<p>request of his friends." Neither of the counsel of the Dorr Liberation Society
</p>
<p>ever pretended to act under the authority of Governor Dorr. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>the affidavits in the case prove, that the reason why they acted for the Society,
</p>
<p>* An adequate description of the intense excitement which pervaded all parties in Rhode
</p>
<p>Island, upon the mere statement of the fact that this motion was before the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>of the United States, would exceed the space which has been allotted to this part of the pub-
</p>
<p>lication. The prominent men who claimed to lead the two parties were downhearted, sad,

</p>
<p>dismayed. The Hunkers no less than th^ Algerines. The numerous letters written from
</p>
<p>Rhode Island at this time, to persons in other States, abound with facts and incidents to
</p>
<p>prove this. Up to the time the motion Was made, the opponents of Dorr in other States
</p>
<p>could not credit the fact that his Counsel were excluded from him, even in prison. A mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the Senate, when told so by another Senator, replied that it was impossible. That
</p>
<p>such a thing was never heard of in a civilized country. But the affidavits submitted with
</p>
<p>the motion, prove the fact beyond controversy, and then men of all parties joined in con-
</p>
<p>demning the barbarous deed. It has often been stated, probably on good grounds, that the
</p>
<p>authorities of Rhode Island were advised by their friends and correspondents, that no one
</p>
<p>could justify them in this particular. That they mut give it up, and open the prison doors,
</p>
<p>or that the Counsel and Court would unquestionably find means to bring up the case with-
</p>
<p>out their consent, and against their consent. The inspectors yielded the point which they
</p>
<p>had often asserted they never would yield, and it has been said they went so far as to solicit
</p>
<p>the Counsel of Gov. Dorr, who had tamely submitted to their refusal, to renew his applica-
</p>
<p>tion to them for leave to visit him. A full development of the circumstances connected
</p>
<p>with this extraordinary somerset, may yet be forthcoming. Some interesting letters upon
</p>
<p>the subject, are known to be in existence.
</p>
<p>t Many of the newspapers have stated that this decision was declared by Mr. Justice Mc-
</p>
<p>Lean to be unanimous. The decision was not unanimous, and was not so declared by
</p>
<p>Judge McLean. No such intimation was put forth by any member of the Court.
</p>
<p>I This is not only a queer, but an alarming state of law. A pirate, a traitor, or a murderer,
</p>
<p>can skreen himself under imprisonment for a pretended debt of five dollars, and defy the
</p>
<p>power of the Union to arrest him ! No wonder the Court advised the Judiciary Committee
</p>
<p>of the Senate to amend the law. That committee reported a bill for the purpose, but it is
</p>
<p>believed that it was not acted upon, or at least not passed.
</p>
<p>ALGERINES IDENTIFIED. 21
</p>
<p>or acted at all, was, because the authorities of Rhode Island had conspired
</p>
<p>against Dorr's right of appeal, and refused to give him an opportunity to see
</p>
<p>counsel, or employ any one to act for him. This was the point which the Dorr
</p>
<p>Liberation Society thought proper to contest with the authorities of Rhode
</p>
<p>Island, supported as the latter were substantially, by the Hunkers of the State
</p>
<p>Central Committee. The Society determined that the gates of the temple of
</p>
<p>justice, the Supreme Court of the United States, which the Algerines had closed
</p>
<p>upon Dorr, and vauntingly proclaimed that they had closed them upon him for
</p>
<p>ever, should be opened, and they were opened ! That Dorr should see counsel,
</p>
<p>and have liberty to apply for a writ of error, and so it was, and speedily. The
</p>
<p>Counsel of the Society never sought to see Governor Dorr, for any other pur-
</p>
<p>pose than so far to set him at liberty, as to give him an opportunity to employ
</p>
<p>whom he would, to carry up his case. If Dorr has not had that liberty; if he
</p>
<p>has in any degree been deprived of it ; if by a conspiracy among the Pilates and
</p>
<p>Herods of the two divans of Algerines he has been under the necessity of em-
</p>
<p>ploying Burgess, who, as his c^wn publications prove,* had abandoned Dorr's
</p>
<p>cause, and left him exposed to the atrocious cruelties of the Inspectors of the
</p>
<p>prison, it is not the fault of the Dorr Liberation Society. That Society, by its
</p>
<p>vigorous and persevering efforts in the cause of justice and humanity, brought to
</p>
<p>bear upon Dorr's jailors an influence which could no longer be resisted, and
</p>
<p>forced the conspirators to open the prison doors. When the father and mother
</p>
<p>of Gov. Dorr were, under the pressure of this influence, invited by the authori-
</p>
<p>ties to go into the prison and see their son, who, as the Algerines said, was
</p>
<p>dead, but now to his parents was alive again, the Dorr Liberation Society waited
</p>
<p>on them, and tendered to them their correspondence and papers, with liberty to
</p>
<p>take them into the prison, and show that son what had been done by that
</p>
<p>Society ; done spontaneously, in answer to his appeal to them as a part of the
</p>
<p>people of the country. The ofl^er was not accepted. When Burgess had liberty
</p>
<p>to visit Gov. Dorr in prison, the use of ihe papers was tendered to him for the
</p>
<p>same purpose. His reply in efl'ect was, that he should like to examine the
</p>
<p>papers, and show such parts of them as he pleased, to Gov. Dorr ; but that he
</p>
<p>would not communicate to the Society any reply that Gov. Dorr might make
</p>
<p>upon the matter.
</p>
<p>The Society were grieved, but not disappointed, at the course which the

</p>
<p>parents of Gov. Dorr continued to pursue. Those parents, equally regardless
</p>
<p>of the wishes and character of their son, had continued to knock at the portals
</p>
<p>of the divan with their petitions, not for his justification, and the establishment
</p>
<p>of his innocence, but for a pardon as a criminal ! For a pardon, that would not
</p>
<p>restore to him his civil and social rights, but convert the whole State into a State
</p>
<p>Prison to him ; and leave every Algerine at liberty to put forth the finger at
</p>
<p>him, or cuff, kick, and spit upon him with impunity ! And this was all that
</p>
<p>the most bitter foes of Gov. Dorr among the Algerine authorities, sought to
</p>
<p>accomplish. The Hunkers, for the same reasons which influenced the authori-
</p>
<p>ties, strove to effect the same purpose.
</p>
<p>It is the character of Dorr, restored to his civil, social, and political rights,
</p>
<p>which these usurping divans, these conspiring identities dread. His integrity ;
</p>
<p>his intelligence ; his indomitable love of justice ; his experience ; his know-
</p>
<p>ledge of the character, wants, and desires of all classes of the people of Rhode
</p>
<p>Island, and above all his invincible devotion to the most liberal principles of
</p>
<p>free, republican government, founded as it can only be on the broad basis of the
</p>
<p>* There is good reason to believe, that one or more of the counsel of Governor Dorr were
</p>
<p>informed by the ardent friends of Dorr in other States, that their own publications were
</p>
<p>generally considered as evidence that they had abandoned his cause.
</p>
<p>22 THE HUNKERS AND ALGERINES IDENTIFIED.
</p>
<p>Right of Suffrage, unite in rendering him a dangerous rival to any candidate for
</p>
<p>public honors, which his opponents can bring into the poHtical field.
</p>
<p>Dorr's case is now before the Supreme Court of the United States, where it
</p>
<p>will be revised, and doubtless the sentence will be reversed. In such case, if
</p>
<p>his health should not be greatly impaired, nor his mind shattered by the barbarous
</p>
<p>cruelties oS the authorities of the prison, two-thirds of the people of Rhode Island
</p>
<p>would immediately rally around him, and make him their governor. This, both
</p>
<p>factions of the Algerines know full well, and hence they are equally anxious for
</p>
<p>his political degradation and destruction.
</p>
<p>The Dorr Liberation Society, having in response to Dorr's appeal put their
</p>
<p>hands to the free suffrage plough, will continue to guide it until they break up
</p>
<p>the rotten stumps and roots of the Algerines, and restore Dorr to liberty. They
</p>
<p>will then insist on his taking such a prominent part in the cultivation of the
</p>
<p>political field, as the then disenthralled people of Rhode Island may choose to
</p>
<p>assign him. This done, the Society, regardless alike of the flatteries of profess-
</p>
<p>ing friends, and the frowns and threats of open or secret foes, will publish an
</p>
<p>account of its efforts and doings ; of its attempts, successful or otherwise, for the
</p>
<p>relief of this suffering victim of oppression, and of the means, successful or un-
</p>
<p>successful, which have been resorted to by the Algerine Identities, to thwart
</p>
<p>the plans of the Society and turn it from its purposes. When Dorr shall be
</p>
<p>liberated and restored to the enjoyment of all his rights, the Society will be
</p>
<p>ready to participate in the burthens and benefits of a well-balanced constitutional
</p>
<p>government, equally with all their fellow citizens. Till then, they are resolved
</p>
<p>to retain their organization as a society, and strive to carry out " their proposed

<p>THE
</p>
<p>CASE OF CtOVEEIOR DOEE.
</p>
<p>MOTION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS FROM THE SUPREME COURT
</p>
<p>OF THE UNITED STATES.
</p>
<p>Washington, ss.
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, December Term.
</p>
<p>Tenth day, December 11, 1844.
</p>
<p>In the case of the State of Rhode Island and Providence plantations,
</p>
<p>vs.
</p>
<p>Thomas Wilson Dorr, now confined in the State's prison at Providence, Rhode
</p>
<p>Island, aforesaid.
</p>
<p>Francis C. Treadvvell, of counsel in behalf of said Dorr, moves the Court that
</p>
<p>a writ of habeas corpus issue forthwith to bring out the said Dorr to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington aforesaid, and give him an opportunity to sign a petition for a writ of
</p>
<p>error in his own behalf, and to prosecute the same, to the end that the whole
</p>
<p>record of the Supreme Court of the State of Rhode Island in said case may be
</p>
<p>certified in due form of law to the Supreme Court of the United States, and
</p>
<p>the errors therein be corrected. The facts in this case, briefly stated, are 
</p>
<p>First. That said Thomas W. Dorr was indicted for treason against the State
</p>
<p>of Rhode Island aforesaid, at Newport, at the terra of the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>Rhode Island, holden on the fourth Monday of August, 1842, and tried in pur-
</p>
<p>suance of said indictment, and a verdict of guilty having been rendered by the
</p>
<p>jury in the case, was, on the twenty-fifth day of June, 1844, sentenced to " be
</p>
<p>imprisoned in the State's prison at Providence, in the county of Providence, for
</p>
<p>the term of his natural life, and there kept at hard labor in separate confinement."
</p>
<p>Second. That a suspension of the sentence for one day was allowed by the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of Rhode Island, for the purpose of preparing a bill of exceptions,
</p>
<p>" with a view to suing out a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the tlnited
</p>
<p>States," and a bill of exceptions was then prepared, and makes a part of the
</p>
<p>record, at page 82.
</p>
<p>Third. That the Court refused to suspend the execution of the sentence, and
</p>
<p>to await the decision of the case by the Supreme Court of the United States
</p>
<p>upon a writ of error, although notified that the imprisonment of the defendant
</p>
<p>would disable him from prosecuting his defence. See Burke's report, pao-e

</p>
<p>Fourth. That the inspectors of the State's prison utterly refused to let said
</p>
<p>Thomas W. Dorr sign or see a petition for a writ of error as aforesaid.
</p>
<p>Fifth. That the Governor of the State of Rhode Island refuses, and, as he
</p>
<p>alleges, for want of power, to let Dorr sign or see such a petition.
</p>
<p>Sixth. That sundry citizens of Providence aforesaid have signed a petition
</p>
<p>24 EX PARTE DORR;
</p>
<p>to this honorable court for a writ of error, or for a writ of habeas corpus,
</p>
<p>which petition is now presented with this motion.
</p>
<p>The documents, papers, and evidence herewith submitted, and prayed to be
</p>
<p>considered a part of this motion, consist 
</p>
<p>First. Of the petition of sundry citizens of Rhode Island, named in the sixth
</p>
<p>specification of facts aforesaid, marked, One.
</p>
<p>Second. Of the affidavit of Samuel Fessenden, Esq., marked Two, with
</p>
<p>the letter of Thomas M. Burgess, Esq., mayor of Providence, marked Three,
</p>
<p>annexed. The affidavit of John S. Eddy, Esq., marked Four, and the affi-

</p>
<p>Fourth. The petition presented by Gen. Fessenden to Thomas M. Burgess,

</p>
<p>Fifth. The report of the select committee of the House of Representatives
</p>
<p>upon the affairs of Rhode Island, by Edmund Burke, Esq., chairman.
</p>
<p>The points relied upon for a reversal of the sentence are three, all of which
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of the State of Rhode Island overruled.
</p>
<p>First. That the act of the State of Rhode Island for punishing treason is
</p>
<p>repugnant to the constitution and laws of the United States ; and that the crime
</p>
<p>of treason cannot be committed against a separate State, but against the United
</p>
<p>States.  See Record, p. 82, Burkeh Report, p. 1021.
</p>
<p>Second. That said Dorr was governor of the State, duly elected, under the
</p>
<p>people's constitution  a republican constitution or form of government  and
</p>
<p>that he offered to prove these facts.  Record, p. 50, 51, 77.
</p>
<p>Third. That the whole record shows that if said Dorr levied war at all, it
</p>
<p>was against the United States, and cannot be inquired of by any State court.
</p>
<p>The authorities relied upon as giving jurisdiction of the case to this court,
</p>
<p>are 
</p>
<p>First. The third article of the constitution of the United States, which vests
</p>
<p>the power in this court.
</p>
<p>Second. The twenty-fifth section of the judiciary act of 1789, which pre-
</p>
<p>scribes the mode of its exercise by writ of error.

</p>
<p>The writ of habeas corpus in this case is, I apprehend, a writ of right, the
</p>
<p>privilege of which, under the constitution of the United States, cannot be
</p>
<p>suspended but in the two contingencies mentioned in the second clause of the
</p>
<p>ninth section of article first. The necessity of the writ of habeas corpus in this
</p>
<p>case arises because the Supreme Court of the State of Rhode Island and the
</p>
<p>inspectors of the State's prison at Providence have thrown impediments in the
</p>
<p>way of the exercise of the constitutional right of said Dorr " to have his defence
</p>
<p>examined by that tribunal whose province "it is to construe the constitu ion and
</p>
<p>laws of the Union."  See opinion of the Supreme Court in Cohens and Vir-
</p>

</p>
<p>PETITION OF J. C. DAVIS, j; S. EDDY, AND FORTY-FOUR OTHERS.
</p>
<p>To the Chief Justice, and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>United States, holden at Washington, being the present seat of the National
</p>
<p>Government, on the first Monday of December, in the year of our Lord, one
</p>
<p>thousand eight hundred and forty-four,  or to either of the Justices of the said
</p>
<p>court in either of the several circuits.
</p>
<p>Complain, and respectfully represent the undersigned, citizens of the
</p>
<p>State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, near friends of Thomas
</p>
<p>Wilson Dorr.
</p>
<p>That at the Term of the Supreme Judicial Court of the said State of Rhode
</p>
<p>Island, and Providence Plantations, holden at Nevi'port, in and for the county
</p>
<p>of Newport in said State, on the fourth Monday of August, in the year of our
</p>
<p>Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-two, an Indictment for the crime
</p>
<p>of Treason against the said State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,
</p>
<p>was found by the Grand Jurors of the said State of Rhode Island and Provi-
</p>
<p>dence Plantations, and in and for the body of the county of Newport, against
</p>
<p>the said Thomas Wilson Dorr, of the city of Providence, in the county of Provi-
</p>
<p>dence, Attorney and Counsellor at Law, in which Indictment the said Thomas
</p>
<p>Wilson Dorr is charged in four several and distinct counts, that he, being an
</p>
<p>inhabitant of and residing within the State of Rhode Island and Providence
</p>
<p>Plantations, and owing allegiance and fidelity to said State, did, on the several
</p>
<p>days and times set forth in the several places therein specified, wickedly, and
</p>
<p>traitorously, unmindful of his allegiance aforesaid, conspire to levy, and did
</p>
<p>actually levy, war against the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.
</p>
<p>Which said indictment is made and has become a matter of record in said court,
</p>
<p>as by a copy thereof, herewith presented, and verified under the seal of said
</p>
<p>court, fully appears. And the undersigned citizens, as aforesaid, further com-
</p>
<p>plaining, say, that at an adjourned term of the aforesaid Supreme Court, begun
</p>
<p>and holden at Newport aforesaid, on the twenty-ninth day of February, in the
</p>
<p>year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-four, the said Thomas
</p>
<p>Wilson Dorr was brought into court, and arraigned on said indictment, and
</p>
<p>caused to plead thereto, and that afterwards such proceedings were had on said

<p>Island and Providence Plantations, holden at Newport aforesaid, by adjourn-
</p>
<p>ment, on the twenty-sixth day of April, 1844, a Jury was completed and em-
</p>
<p>pannelled in the way and manner as in the records of said court appears, for
</p>
<p>the trial of the said Thomas Wilson Dorr on said indictment ; and the under-
</p>
<p>signed further complain and allege that such further proceedings were had on
</p>
<p>said indictment, and the trial of Thomas Wilson Dorr, thereon, that on the
</p>
<p>seventh day of May, 1844, the Jury so empannelled as aforesaid, under the di-
</p>
<p>rection of said court in matters of law, returned a verdict of guilty against the said
</p>
<p>Thomas Wilson Dorr, which the said court ordered to be, and which was re-
</p>
<p>ceived and recorded ; and which said verdict has also become matter of record
</p>
<p>in said court. And the undersigned further complain and allege, that, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding all the said Thomas Wilson Dorr's complaints, objections, and
</p>
<p>remonstrances, made as well by the counsel of the said Thomas Wilson Dorr,
</p>
<p>as by said Thomas Wilson Dorr himself, the said Supreme Court, on the twenty-
</p>
<p>fifth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and forty-four, proceeded to, and
</p>
<p>did sentence the said Thomas Wilson Dorr to be imprisoned for the term of his
</p>
<p>natural life, in the State's Prison at Providence, in the county of Providence
</p>
<p>and State aforesaid, and there kept at hard labor in separate confinement, as by
</p>
<p>the full record of said Indictment, and the proceedings thereon, and the verdict
</p>
<p>26 EX PARTE DORR;
</p>
<p>of the Jury aforesaid, and the judgment and sentence of said Court, and a
</p>
<p>copy of which record, duly certified under the seal of said Court, and accom-
</p>
<p>panying this complaint, fully appears, and under which judgment and the sentence
</p>
<p>of said Court the said Thomas Wilson Dorr is now suffering imprisonment.
</p>
<p>And to which said rulings and directions in matters of law, the said Thomas
</p>
<p>Wilson Dorr, by his counsel on his behalf, offered and tendered a Bill of Excep-
</p>
<p>tions as by the record appears, and which herewith accompanies said Petition ;
</p>
<p>which said record of said judgment of said Court so as aforesaid, certified, and
</p>
<p>authenticated, is now remaining in said Court in full force, and is in no way
</p>
<p>annulled or reversed.
</p>
<p>And the undersigned further aver that in the record of said Indictment, and
</p>
<p>of the proceedings thereon, and of the judgment and sentence of said Supreme
</p>
<p>Court, manifest error hath intervened. And that said Indictment so as aforesaid
</p>
<p>found, and the proceedings had thereon, and the verdict of said Jury so found,
</p>
<p>and the judgment so rendered thereon, and the sentence so awarded thereon,
</p>
<p>against the said Thomas Wilson Dorr and the execution thereof so as aforesaid
</p>
<p>carried into effect upon his person, are in violation of, and opposed to, and sub-
</p>
<p>versive of the Constitution of the United States, are wholly erroneous in the
</p>
<p>following particulars : 
</p>
<p>First. It appears from the record aforesaid, that the said Supreme Court did
</p>
<p>rule and direct the Jury as the law by which they were by their oaths bound,
</p>
<p>that the treason charged in said Indictment, to wit, the levying of war
</p>
<p>against an individual State, might be committed against an individual State.
</p>
<p>Whereas, the said Thomas Wilson Dorr avers that the treason set forth in said
</p>
<p>indictment, and the overt acts therein charged, to wit, the levying of war upon and
</p>
<p>against the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a levying of war
</p>
<p>against the United vStates, according to the true intent and meaning of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of- the United States, and can only be committed against the United
</p>
<p>States, and can only be inquired of in the Circuit Court of the United States
</p>
<p>for the first circuit, on an indictment found by the Grand Jury of the United
</p>
<p>States, duly and legally summoned, empannelled and charged to inquire for
</p>
<p>the United States for said first circuit, against any person guilty of said crime,
</p>
<p>and can only be tried in said Circuit Court by a Jury duly empannelled and
</p>
<p>sworn to try the same ; and because any treason, by levying war against a State,
</p>

</p>
<p>and the offence thereby committed against the State, is merged in the treason
</p>
<p>committed against the United States.
</p>
<p>Secondly. Because the people who are citizens of a State have a right by
</p>
<p>the laws of nature to frame for themselves a government when that under
</p>
<p>which they live is found, on experiment, to be unequal and oppressive,  and
</p>
<p>under the Constitution of the United States, to alter, amend, or frame a Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of Government for themselves, provided only that it be Republican ;
</p>
<p>and because the said Thomas Wilson Dorr offered to prove by competent
</p>
<p>evidence, that a majority of the adult male citizens of the United States resident
</p>
<p>in the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, had framed and
</p>
<p>adopted for the Government of said State, a Republican form of Government
</p>
<p>which had gone into operation, by the choice and qualification of said Thomas
</p>
<p>Wilson Dorr as Governor, and by the choice and qualification of other officers
</p>
<p>provided for by said Constitution, which proof the said Court rejected, and
</p>
<p>thereby violated the fourth section of the fourth article of the Constitution of
</p>
<p>the United States, which provides that the United States shall guarantee to
</p>
<p>every State in this Union, a Republican form of Government.
</p>
<p>Thirdly. Because it appears from the whole record, that if the said Thomas
</p>
<p>Wilson Dorr, wrongfully, and without any justifiable authority, levied war, it
</p>
<p>was a war against the United States only, and therefore that he could not,
</p>
<p>SUPREME COURT U. S. 2^
</p>
<p>according to the Constitution of the United States, and without a violation there-
</p>
<p>of, he held amenable to be tried for said crintie, by any State Court.
</p>
<p>Wherefore the aforesaid citizens of Rhode Island whose names are under-
</p>
<p>signed, pray that a writ of error in behalf of the said Thomas Wilson Dorr,
</p>
<p>may go to the Judges, or some of them, of the SupremeCourt of the State of
</p>
<p>Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, or that a writ of habeas corpus may
</p>
<p>issue forthwith to bring out the said Thomas Wilson Dorr, and give him an op-
</p>
<p>portunity to sign a petition for a writ of error on his own behalf, to the end
</p>
<p>that the whole record of said Indictment and trial and judgment, may be certi-
</p>
<p>fied in due form of law to the Supreme Court of the United States, and that the
</p>
<p>errors aforesaid therein, and which are set forth in this petition, may be cor-
</p>
<p>rected, and the judgment in the premises so rendered by the said Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of the said State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, may be
</p>
<p>reversed and annulled and held for naught, and the said Thomas Wilson Dorr
</p>
<p>be released from his said imprisonment so suffered in violation of the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of the United States.

<p>II. AFFIDAVIT OF SAMUEL FESSENDEN.
</p>
<p>I, Samuel Fessenden, of Portland, in the county of Cumberland and State of
</p>
<p>Maine, counsellor at law, on oath state : That I was employed by the friends of
</p>
<p>Thomas Wilson Dorr, confined in the State prison in Providence, Rhode Island,
</p>
<p>pursuant to the sentence of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island and Providence
</p>
<p>Plantations, on a conviction in said court on an indictment charging said Dorr
</p>
<p>of having committed the crime of treason by levying war against said State, as
</p>
<p>a counsellor at law, practising in the circuit court of the United States, to render
</p>
<p>my aid in carrying up the case of the said Thomas Wilson Dorr, on writ of
</p>
<p>error to the Supreme Court of the United States, for revision and correction of
</p>
<p>the errors as stated and set forth in the record of his, said Dorr's trial and con-
</p>
<p>viction ; that, in the discharge of my duty by virtue of said employment, I
</p>
<p>called on Mr. Justice Story of the Supreme Court of the United States, who
</p>
<p>informed me that, as an indispensable preliminary to the granting a writ of
</p>
<p>error, a petition signed by said Dorr must be presented, praying that a writ of
</p>

</p>
<p>error might be granted.
</p>
<p>I then drew up a petition  such as I judged to be suitable and proper for said
</p>
<p>Dorr to sign  and, in company with Francis C. Treadwell, Esq., presented
</p>
<p>said petition to Thomas M. Burgess, Esq., mayor of the city of Providence,
</p>
<p>and, by virtue of his office, chairman of the board of inspectors of the State's
</p>
<p>prison in Providence, where said Dorr is confined, with the request that said
</p>
<p>Dorr might have said petition placed in his hands for perusal, and with liberty
</p>
<p>to sign the same should he think proper.
</p>
<p>The said Burgess then informed me that he had no idea that said Dorr would
</p>
<p>be permitted to see or sign said petition ; that he himself should be opposed to
</p>
<p>it ; that it was, as he believed, the determination of the authorities of the State
</p>
<p>that said Dorr should have no opportunity to carry up his case by writ of error,
</p>
<p>and that they did not intend that there should be any interference on behalf of
</p>
<p>said Dorr for that end. With much persuasion, I induced the said Burgess, the
</p>
<p>mayor, to take said petition, and consult with the other members of the board
</p>
<p>of inspectors. He took the petition for that purpose, saying at the same time
</p>
<p>that he knew they would not permit it, and that he, as one of the board, should
</p>
<p>not consent to have said Dorr see or sign said petition.
</p>
<p>On this twentieth day of November, I received the annexed letter from said
</p>
<p>28 EX PARTE DORR;

</p>
<p>Providence, November 18, 1844.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen :  I have seen several of the inspectors of the State prison this
</p>
<p>afternoon, who agree with me, that we ought to take no action upon your
</p>
<p>request ; because it is so very similar in its character to one which the General
</p>
<p>Assembly, at their October session, virtually refused to grant.
</p>
<p>I enclose the papers, and remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,
</p>
<p>THOMAS M. BURGESS.
</p>
<p>To Messrs. Fessenden and Treadwell.

</p>
<p>of which the one above is, with very slight variation, a transcript.]

<p>IV. AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN S. EDDY.
</p>
<p>I, John S. Eddy, of city and county of Providence, and State of Rhode Island,
</p>
<p>gentleman, on oath state, that on the twenty-fifth day of November, A. D.
</p>
<p>eighteen hundred and forty-four, in company with Francis C. Treadwell, Esq.,
</p>
<p>I called upon James Fenner, Esq., Governor of the State of Rhode Island afore-
</p>
<p>said, at his residence in Providence aforesaid, when the said Treadwell pre-
</p>
<p>sented to said Governor Fenner a petition addressed to the Chief Justice and
</p>
<p>Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, or to either of
</p>
<p>said Justices in either of the circuits, praying that a writ of error may be
</p>
<p>granted in the case of the State of Rhode Island against Thomas Wilson Dorr,
</p>
<p>confined in the State's prison in Providence, Rhode Island, aforesaid, pursuant
</p>
<p>to the sentence of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island and Providence Planta-
</p>
<p>tions, on a conviction in said court, on an indictment charging said Dorr with

</p>
<p>having committed the crime of treason against the said State, and requested the
</p>
<p>said Governor Fenner to permit said Dorr to read said petition, and to sign the
</p>
<p>same, if he, the said Dorr, should desire to do so. That the said Governor
</p>
<p>Fenner replied to said Treadwell, that he, said Governor Fenner, had no power
</p>
<p>to hold intercourse with said Dorr, or with any other person confined in the
</p>
<p>State prison aforesaid, nor to permit any other person so to do. That by
</p>
<p>the laws of the State of Rhode Island aforesaid, the inspectors of said prison
</p>
<p>were the only persons who had power to permit such intercourse, or to allow
</p>
<p>any person to see any prisoner confined in said prison ; and the said Governor
</p>
<p>Fenner, thereupon, for the rea.sons above stated, refused to give permission for
</p>
<p>the said Dorr to sign or to see the petition aforesaid.

</p>
<p>v. AFFIDAVIT OF F. C. TREADWELL.
</p>
<p>I, Francis C. Treadwell, of Portland, in the county of Cumberland, and
</p>
<p>State of Maine, Counsellor at Law, on solemn affirmation say, that I have been,
</p>
<p>and now am, employed by the friends of Thomas Wilson Dorr, confined in the
</p>
<p>State Prison in Providence, Rhode Island, pursuant to the sentence of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, on a conviction
</p>
<p>in said Court on an indictment charging said Dorr with having committed the
</p>
<p>crime of Treason by levying war against said State, to render my aid in carry-
</p>
<p>ing up the case of the said Thomas Wilson Dorr, by writ of error to the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court of the United States, for revision and correction of the errors as
</p>
<p>stated and set forth in the record of said Dorr's trial and conviction. That
</p>
<p>about the latter part of the month of July last past, in the discharge of my
</p>
<p>duty by virtue of said employment, I called on Walter S, Burgess, Esq., of
</p>
<p>Providence aforesaid, Counsellor at Law, and on the late Samuel Y. Atwell,
</p>
<p>Esq., of Glocester, Counsellor at Law, then at Providence, but since deceased,
</p>
<p>both of whom informed me, that in connection with George Turner, Esq., of
</p>
<p>Newport, in the State of Rhode Island aforesaid, Counsellor at Law, they, as
</p>
<p>Counsel for said Dorr, were about to make application to the Board of Inspec-
</p>
<p>tors of the State Prison, at Providence aforesaid, for liberty to consult with said
</p>
<p>Thomas Wilson Dorr, in the prison aforesaid, in relation to carrying the case
</p>
<p>aforesaid, by writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States. That
</p>
<p>both said Burgess, and said Atwell, requested me to call on them again, and
</p>
<p>also on said Turner, and confer freely with them all upon the subject of car-
</p>
<p>rying the case of the said Dorr by writ of error to the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>United States as aforesaid, and that both said Burgess, and said Atwell, promised
</p>
<p>to let me know the result of their said application to the Inspectors of the
</p>
<p>Prison aforesaid, early, or immediately upon its communication to them ; and
</p>
<p>both said Burgess and said Atwell requested me not to take any legal proceed-
</p>
<p>ings, not even to get a copy of the Record aforesaid, until they should receive
</p>
<p>an answ^er from the inspectors of the prison aforesaid, and should publish a
</p>
<p>report of the Trials of the case aforesaid, which they then had in press for
</p>
<p>immediate publication. That in pursuance of the request, so made by the said
</p>
<p>Burgess, and the said Atwell, I called several times on the said Burgess, and
</p>
<p>conversed with him freely upon the case aforesaid ; and that also, in pursuance

</p>
<p>of the request made as aforesaid, I called several times at the American Hotel,
</p>
<p>in Providence aforesaid, the lodging-place of the said Atwell, and in answer to
</p>
<p>my inquiries for said Atwell, was told by the keeper of the said House, that
</p>
<p>said Atwell was in his room, too much indisposed to see company. And this
</p>
<p>affirmant further says, that on a certain day in the month of August last past,
</p>
<p>he met the said Turner, at the office of said Burgess, in Providence aforesaid,
</p>
<p>when said Turner requested this affirmant to call before eleven o'clock on the
</p>
<p>morning of that day, on said Atwell, at said American house, or hotel, and
</p>
<p>converse with said Atwell upon the case aforesaid, and upon the propriety of
</p>
<p>sueing out a writ of habeas corpus, in a certain contingency  that on the same
</p>
<p>day I called at the Hotel aforesaid, and inquired of the keeper thereof for said
</p>
<p>Atwell, and was told by said keeper, that said Atwell immediately after parting
</p>
<p>with said Turner, at breakfast time that morning, had met with an unexpected
</p>
<p>opportunity to return to his residence in Glocester, and had departed thence
</p>
<p>some hours before, from which time to the day of his decease, as this affirmant
</p>
<p>is informed and believes, the said Atwell never returned to Providence afore-
</p>
<p>said. And this affirmant further says, that on or about the twenty-sixth day of
</p>
<p>August last past, the said Walter S. Burgess, accosted this affirmant in the
</p>
<p>street at Providence aforesaid, and then and there said, that he the said Burgess
</p>
<p>had received from the Inspectors of the State Prison aforesaid, an answer, de-
</p>
<p>30 EX PARTE DORR;
</p>
<p>Dying the Counsel of said Dorr the liberty to consult with him upon the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of taking the case aforesaid, by writ of error to the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>United States, and that himself and said Atwell, and Turner, had in such case
</p>
<p>agreed to abandon the case, and without said Dorr's personal instructions, they,
</p>
<p>said Atwell, Turner and Burgess, would do nothing further in the matter, and
</p>
<p>that the inspectors aforesaid, had referred the request, or petition, to the Judges
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Court, and to the Legislature of the State, which said Burgess
</p>
<p>pronounced to be a rejection of the said petition. And the said Burgess then
</p>
<p>and there also stated, that he, said Burgess, had no idea of going to Washington
</p>
<p>with a writ of error, upon a case for a man, when he did not know whether
</p>
<p>the man wished to have the case go there or not. That it might take five
</p>
<p>years to get a decision upon the case, and that the carrying it up thence might
</p>
<p>operate to the prejudice of the said Dorr in obtaining a pardon from the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature of the State of Rhode Island aforesaid. And the said Burgess then
</p>
<p>and there further stated, that this affirmant could now carry up the case by
</p>
<p>writ of error as aforesaid, if he thought proper so to do ; that they, the said
</p>
<p>Burgess, Atwell and Turner, had before agreed to give up the case, in case the
</p>
<p>Algerine Inspectors of the State's Prison aforesaid, should refuse to let them, the
</p>
<p>said counsel, consult with the said Dorr ; and that all objections to the carrying
</p>
<p>up of said case by writ of error as aforesaid, by this affirmant, if he knew of
</p>
<p>any way to do it without first obtaining permission from the inspectors of the
</p>
<p>prison, or other authorities of Rhode Island aforesaid, on the part of said Bur-
</p>
<p>gess, Atwell, and Turner, were now removed, and the way all clear for the ac-
</p>
<p>tion of this affirmant in the premises. And this affirmant further says, that on
</p>
<p>the ninth day of September last past, by the request of many of the near
</p>
<p>friends of the said Thomas W. Dorr, he went to Portland in the State of
</p>
<p>Maine, aforesaid, and engaged the services of Samuel Fessenden, Esq., Coun-
</p>
<p>sellor at Law, in the carrying up by writ of error to the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>United States, the case of the said Dorr ; and on the twelfth day of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber last past, as appears by his minutes, then made, this affirmant went to
</p>
<p>Newport, in the State of Rhode Island aforesaid, to the office of the Clerk of
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of Rhode Island aforesaid, and engaged the Clerk of said
</p>
<p>Court to make a copy of the record aforesaid, in the case of the said Dorr,
</p>
<p>and urged said Clerk to make the copy of said record speedily ; which said

</p>
<p>Clerk promised to do ; and this affirmant offi^red to pay said Clerk then in ad-
</p>
<p>vance, for the copy of said record ; which payment in advance said Clerk
</p>
<p>refused to receive ; and when three weeks afterwards this affirmant went from
</p>
<p>Providence to Newport aforesaid, for the said copy of said record, and the
</p>
<p>Clerk had not begun to make it out, and could not or would not say when he
</p>
<p>would either begin or finish the said copy of said record. And this affirmant
</p>
<p>further says, that in compliance with the advice of several of the friends of
</p>
<p>said Dorr, at Newport, and elsewhere, who feared that a copy of said record
</p>
<p>could not otherwise be obtained in time to be available at the then next term
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Court of the United States, he was under the necessity of
</p>
<p>employing, at an expense of twenty-five dollars, a man to go into the office of
</p>
<p>the said Clerk, of said Court, at Newport aforesaid, and make a copy of said
</p>
<p>record from many detached papers as they were handed him by said Clerk,
</p>
<p>which caused a delay as nearly as this affirmant can now recollect, of more
</p>
<p>than three weeks longer, and several inconvenient and expensive journeys to
</p>
<p>Newport ; and still the said Clerk charged and received the official price for
</p>
<p>making a copy of said record.
</p>
<p>And this affirmant further says, that on the aforesaid twelfth of September
</p>
<p>last past, he saw at Newport aforesaid, the said George Turner, at his office
</p>
<p>whicii is contiguous to the office of William Gilpin, the Clerk of the Court
</p>
<p>SUPREME COURT U. S. 31
</p>
<p>aforesaid, and told said Turner that he, said affirmant, had come lO the office of
</p>
<p>the Clerk of said Court, to obtain a copy of said record, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>carrying up the case of said Dorr by writ of error to the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>the United States. That said Turner made no objection thereto, but then and
</p>
<p>there said, that said Atwell, Burgess and himself, had previously agreed that if
</p>
<p>the inspectors of the said prison should refuse to let them consult personally,
</p>
<p>with said Dorr, they, the said counsel, would give up the case of the said Dorr,
</p>
<p>and make no further attempt to carry up the said case by writ of error to the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States ; and the said George Turner then and
</p>
<p>there offered his services, and told this affirmant he would freely yield them to
</p>
<p>the Clerk of the Court aforesaid, in preparing or arranging the papers from
</p>
<p>which the record was to be made out, and would assist said Clerk, and aid
</p>
<p>him in making, as speedily as possible, a copy of the said record.
</p>
<p>And this affirmant further says, that in the month of August last past,
</p>
<p>when the application of the said Burgess and Turner, for permission to consult
</p>
<p>with said Dorr, was pending before the inspectors of the prison aforesaid, that
</p>
<p>he, this affirmant, met with one of said inspectors, by the name of Cranston,
</p>
<p>whose first name he believes is Barzilla, but of that is not certain, when said
</p>
<p>Cranston, at Providence aforesaid, told this affirmant that the application of said
</p>
<p>Burgess and Turner was not definitely acted upon by said inspectors ; that he,
</p>
<p>said Cranston, was not in favor of granting the permission asked for in said ap-
</p>
<p>plication, and he believed it ought to be, and would be, refused ; and said if I
</p>
<p>should make a similar application, it would also, without doubt, be refused ;
</p>
<p>and the said Cranston then asked me why I did not arm myself, and force my
</p>
<p>way into the prison. The said Cranston further said, that he did not believe
</p>
<p>the case of said Dorr could be taken by any means, before the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>of the United States, without the consent of the authorities of Rhode Island,
</p>
<p>in permitting counsel to consult with said Dorr; and that consent he believed
</p>
<p>could never be had. That he was opposed to it, and he believed both the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, and the Legislature, were also opposed to it.
</p>
<p>And this affirmant further says, that some days after the interview with said
</p>
<p>Cranston above named, he met said Cranston at Providence aforesaid, when
</p>
<p>said Cranston told this affirmant that the Inspectors of the prison aforesaid had
</p>
<p>refused to permit said Burgess and Turner to consult with said Dorr, or hold

</p>
<p>any communication with him whatever. That they, said counsel, or myself,
</p>
<p>might carry up the case of said Dorr to the Supreme Court of the United
</p>
<p>States if we could. That he did not believe we could do it without the con-
</p>
<p>sent of the authorities of Rhode Island, and that consent he felt assured we
</p>
<p>should never be able to obtain.
</p>
<p>And this affirmant further says, that on or about the eleventh day of No-
</p>
<p>vember last past, in company of Henry Lord of Providence aforesaid, this
</p>
<p>affirmant called upon Thomas M. Burgess, Esq., mayor of the city of Provi-
</p>
<p>dence, and by the hand of said Henry Lord, presented to said Burgess, mayor
</p>
<p>of Providence, aforesaid, a written request for permission for Samuel Fessen-
</p>
<p>den, Esq., and myself, to visit said Dorr in said prison, and confer with him in
</p>
<p>all matters needful for carrying his case before the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>United States ; a copy of which paper, with a copy of the certificate of said
</p>
<p>Lord, annexed thereto, marked A, is hereunto annexed. And this affirmant
</p>
<p>further says, that said Thomas M. Burgess stated that he was the chairman of
</p>
<p>the inspectors of the State Prison aforesaid, that the Board would not have a
</p>
<p>regular meeting until January next ; after the next meeting of the Legislature
</p>
<p>of the State ; that the inspectors would, beyond question, refuse the applica-
</p>
<p>tion unless the Judges of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island should certify
</p>
<p>that the interview was necessary. That they, the inspectors aforesaid, had
</p>
<p>32 EX PARTE DORR;
</p>
<p>done so upon the application of Messrs. Burgess and Turner, and would doubt-
</p>
<p>less do so now in this case. That he would show the application to some of
</p>
<p>the members of the Board, but he had no doubt of their concurrence with him in
</p>
<p>refusing to grant the interview applied for. And this affirmant further says,
</p>
<p>that on the eleventh day of November last, he received from the said Burgess,
</p>
<p>mayor of Providence aforesaid, a permit to visit the State Prison aforesaid, and
</p>
<p>in company with Henry Lord, went there and saw the prisoners at work, ap-
</p>
<p>parently painting fans. That said prisoners were sitting with their backs
</p>
<p>towards the spectators, who, looking through an iron grating, could not see
</p>
<p>the faces of the prisoners. That farthest off from the grating aforesaid, this
</p>
<p>affirmant saw a person sitting at work in an arm-chair, whom, from the color
</p>
<p>of his hair and the general appearance of the back part of his head and shoul-
</p>
<p>ders, this affirmant believes to have been the said Thomas Wilson Dorr, but
</p>
<p>the distance was so great, probably twenty yards or more, that this affirmant
</p>
<p>cannot, from his own observation, be certain of the identity of said Dorr.
</p>
<p>This affirmant further states, that a keeper is stationed in the room with the
</p>
<p>prisoners, facing the latter, so that, at a glance, he can see all their motions ;
</p>
<p>and that the regulations of the prison aforesaid, forbade a prisoner to speak to
</p>
<p>a spectator, or to a fellow-prisoner, under penalty of being deprived of food and
</p>
<p>water for twenty-four hours, or of corporal punishment.
</p>
<p>And this affirmant further says, that on Monday, the eighteenth day of No-
</p>
<p>vember last past, in company with Samuel Fessenden, Esq., and Walter S.
</p>
<p>Burgess, Esq., he called upon Thomas M. Burgess, Esq., mayor of the City
</p>
<p>of Providence aforesaid, at the office of the mayor, when said Thomas M.
</p>
<p>Burgess, stated that the Inspectors of the State Prison of whom he is chair-
</p>
<p>man, had decided to refuse permission to Gen. Fessenden and this affirmant as
</p>
<p>Counsel, to see or confer with said Thomas W. Dorr. And this affirmant fur-
</p>
<p>ther says, that in addition to the facts stated, in the affidavit of the said Samuel
</p>
<p>Fessenden, Esq., the said Thomas M. Burgess, mayor of Providence aforesaid,
</p>
<p>asserted at the interview last named, that the said Thomas Wilson Dorr could
</p>
<p>come out of prison if he had a mind to do so, by asking the Legislature of the
</p>
<p>State of Rhode Island to pardon him. That said Dorr had been told so ; and
</p>
<p>he, the said Thomas M. Burgess, himself, had so told the "said Dorr ; that the
</p>
<p>" Law and Order party," and the Legislature, were desirous that said Dorr

</p>
<p>should be liberated, and that if he would petition for a pardon, it would be
</p>
<p>granted without even a reference of the petition. The said Thomas M. Bur-
</p>
<p>gess further stated, that he had no doubt it would be so, from what he had
</p>
<p>heard them, the members of the Legislature of Rhode Island, and the "Law
</p>
<p>and Order party," say repeatedly.

</p>
<p>Counsel for certain citizens of Rhode Island.
</p>
<p>Thomas M. Burgess, Esq., Mayor of the City of Providence.
</p>
<p>I certify that the above is a true copy of the original presented by me in
</p>
<p>presence of F. C. Treadwell, Esq., to Thomas M. Burgess, Esq., Chairman of
</p>
<p>Prison Inspectors, Nov. 11th, 1844.
</p>
<p>[Signed] HENRY LORD. 
</p>
<p>Argument of Counsel in support of the motion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Treadwell, in support of the Motion, referred to the public laws of Rhode
</p>
<p>Island, pages 54, 57, to show that the Supreme Court is the highest court of law in
</p>
<p>that State, and produced a transcript of the Record of the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>State of Rhode Island, duly authenticated, to substantiate the first and second facts
</p>
<p>stated in the motion, to wit, that Thomas W. Dorr was indicted for treason against
</p>
<p>the State of Rhode Island, tried, convicted, and sentenced for hfe to hard labor in
</p>
<p>the State prison, and that a suspension of the sentence for one day only was
</p>
<p>allowed to prepare a bill of exceptions for a writ of error. To prove the third
</p>
<p>fact, to wit, that the Court refused to suspend the execution of the sentence
</p>
<p>and await the decision of the case by the Supreme Court of the United States'
</p>
<p>upon a writ of error. Burke's report, page 1047, was cited. The three affidavits
</p>
<p>given above were read, to prove the fourth and fifth facts, stated in the motion,
</p>
<p>to wit, that the inspectors of the prison and the Governor of the State refused to
</p>
<p>let said Dorr sign or see a petition for a writ of error, and other oppressive
</p>
<p>acts of the authorities of Rhode Island. The petition of sundry citizens of
</p>
<p>Providence, Rhode Island, was read, praying for a writ of error, or a writ of
</p>
<p>habeas corpus, to bring out said Dorr, and give him an opportunity to sign a peti-
</p>
<p>tion for a writ of error.
</p>
<p>This case, the counsel contended, was one in which jurisdiction in the appel-
</p>
<p>late form clearly is vested in this court. Although it is a case between a State
</p>
<p>and one of its citizens, it is a case arising under the Constitution and laws of the
</p>
<p>United States, because they are involved in it. The third article of the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution was referred to, conferring upon this court limited original, but very exten-

</p>
<p>sive appellate jurisdiction, " with such exceptions, and under such regulations as
</p>
<p>the Congress shall make." This is not one of the excepted cases. On the conl
</p>
<p>trary, it is one of the cases enumerated and provided for in the 25th section of the
</p>
<p>act of Congress of Sept. 24th, 1789 ; an act^which prescribes the mode, and regu-
</p>
<p>lates the manner in which appellate jurisdiction shall be exercised by this court.
</p>
<p>The judgment against Dorr in this case is a final judgment in a suit in the
</p>
<p>highest court of law in the State of Rhode Island, in which a decision could
</p>
<p>be had. The validity of the act of the State of Rhode Island relative to treason,
</p>
<p>under which Dorr was indicted, was drawn in question on account of its repug-
</p>
<p>nance^to the Constitution and laws of the United States, and the decision of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of Rhode Island was in favor of the validity of that act. The
</p>
<p>construction of the third section of the third article of the Constitution of the
</p>
<p>United States relative to treason, and that of the fourth section of the fourth ar-
</p>
<p>ticle, relative to a republican form of government, were drawn in question ; and
</p>
<p>in both cases the decision of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island was " against
</p>
<p>the title, right, privilege or exemption, specially set up or claimed" by the
</p>
<p>defendant under those clauses of the Constitution. [Under circumstances like
</p>
<p>these, the act provides that the judgment " may be re-examined and reversed,
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>34 EX PARTE DORR;
</p>
<p>or affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States, upon a writ of error, the
</p>
<p>citation being signed by the " chief justice, or judge, or chancellor of the court
</p>
<p>rendering or passing the judgment or decree complained of, by a justice of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States, in the same manner, and under the same
</p>
<p>regulations, and the writ shall have the same effect as if the judgment or decree
</p>
<p>complained of had been rendered or passed in a circuit court, and the proceed-
</p>
<p>ino- upon the reversal shall also be the same, except that the Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>instead of remanding the cause for a final decision, as before provided, may, at
</p>
<p>their discretion, if the cause shall have been once remanded before, proceed to
</p>
<p>a final decision of the same, and aw^ard execution. But no other error shall be
</p>
<p>assigned or regarded as a ground of reversal in any such case as aforesaid, than
</p>
<p>such as appears on the face of the record, and immediately respects the before
</p>
<p>mentioned questions of validity or construction of the said Constitution, trea-
</p>
<p>ties, statutes, commissions, or authorities, in dispute."
</p>
<p>This court is not deprived of its appellate jurisdiction because a State is a
</p>
<p>party to the suit. Although an individual cannot commence or prosecute a
</p>
<p>suit a"-ainst a State, it does not follow that an individual may not defend himself
</p>
<p>against a suit commenced or prosecuted by a State, whether the action be of a
</p>
<p>civil^or criminal character. A State, in the prosecution of suits against individ-
</p>
<p>uals, has no privilege to overleap the Constitution and laws of the United States.
</p>
<p>They are as binding upon the State, as upon individuals ; as binding upon State
</p>
<p>courts, as_upon courts of the United States. When, in the progress of the case of
</p>
<p>a State against an individual, a State court shall disregard the Constitution or laws
</p>
<p>of the United States or the rights of an individual under them, the individual
</p>
<p>has the right to make his exceptions, and put them upon the record, and then to
</p>
<p>call upon the court to send an authenticated transcript of such record to this tri-
</p>
<p>bunal for revision. A writ of error in such a case, it is contended, is a writ of
</p>
<p>right, which, upon due application, neither a State court, nor this court, can, with
</p>
<p>propriety, refuse to allow. This position is manifestly in accordance with the
</p>
<p>grant of appellate power in the third article of the Constitution, and with the ju-
</p>
<p>diciary act of 17S9, before referred to.
</p>
<p>In the well known case of Cohens v. Virginia* this interpretation of the
</p>
<p>grant of appellate power to this court, was explicitly laid down by Mr. Chief
</p>
<p>Justice Marshall as the judgment of the court. This court is not divested of

</p>
<p>its appellate power by the character of the parties to the suit ; by the circum-
</p>
<p>stance that the plaintiff is a State. On the contrary, its appellate jurisdiction
</p>
<p>arises from the character of the case, as developed in the course of the suit.
</p>
<p>From the fact in the present case, that a defence set up under certain parts of
</p>
<p>the Constitution of the United States has been overruled, and an act of a State
</p>
<p>deemed by the defendant to be repugnant to the Constitution, has been held to
</p>
<p>be valid by the State Court. These questions of validity and construction ap-
</p>
<p>pear distinctly upon the face of the record, and manifestly respect the questions
</p>
<p>of construction in dispute.
</p>
<p>If a case of jurisdiction shall be made out, will this court have any discre-
</p>
<p>tionary power to pass it by, and decline the exercise of jurisdiction .'' No axi-
</p>
<p>om would seem to be more evident, than that the court have no such election.
</p>
<p>No man could say that he had a right to appeal to a court of justice in any
</p>
<p>case, if it were optional with the court whether to hear the case or not. A
</p>
<p>right of appeal includes the right to be heard. In the case of Cohens v. Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia^ before referred to, the court treat this question as a self-evident truth,
</p>
<p>and in a manner equally satisfactory and instructive. They say, " But sup-

</p>
<p>the validity of an act emitting bills of credit : suppose a State to prosecute one

<p>of its citizens for refusing paper money, who should plead the Constitution in
</p>
<p>bar of such prosecution. If his plea should be overruled, and judgment render-
</p>
<p>ed against him, his case would resemble this ; and, unless the jurisdiction of
</p>
<p>this court might be exercised over it, the Constitution would be violated, and
</p>
<p>the injured party be unable to bring his case before that tribunal.^ to which the
</p>
<p>people of the United States have assigned all such cases. It is most true, that
</p>
<p>this court will not take jurisdiction, if it should not ; but it is equally true, that
</p>
<p>it must take jurisdiction, if it should. The judiciary cannot, as the legislature
</p>
<p>may, avoid a measure, because it approaches the confines of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>We cannot pass it by, because it is doubtful. With whatever doubts, with
</p>
<p>whatever difficulties a case may be attended, we must decide it if it be brought
</p>
<p>before us. We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction,
</p>
<p>which is given, than to usurp that which is not given. The one or the other
</p>
<p>would be treason to the Constitution. Questions may occur which we would
</p>
<p>gladly avoid ; but we cannot avoid them. All we can do is, to exercise our
</p>
<p>best judgment, and conscientiously to perform our duty. In doing this, on the
</p>
<p>present occasion, we find this tribunal invested with appellate jurisdiction in all
</p>
<p>cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. We find
</p>
<p>no exception to this grant, and we cannot insert one."
</p>
<p>" We think, then, that as the Constitution originally stood, the appellate
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of this court, in all cases arising under the Constitution, laws, or
</p>
<p>treaties of the United States, was not arrested by the circumstance that a State
</p>
<p>was a party."  3 Slory''s Com. on Con., pp. 588, 559, 590.
</p>
<p>The eleventh amendment of the Constitution provides, that, " The judicial
</p>
<p>power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law
</p>
<p>or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the States by citizens of
</p>
<p>another State, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state."
</p>
<p>This amendment, sweeping as it is against the power of an individual to
</p>
<p>commence or prosecute a suit against a State, does not deprive an individual of
</p>
<p>his right of defence against a suit commenced or prosecuted by a State ao-ainst
</p>
<p>himself. This right remains in all its length and breadth, unaffected by this
</p>
<p>amendment.

<p>" If a suit, brought in one court, and carried by legal process to a supervis-

<p>nor prosecuted against a State. It is clearly in its commencement, the suit of
</p>
<p>a State against an individual, which suit is transferred to this court, not for the
</p>
<p>purpose of asserting any claim against the State, but for the purpose of assert-
</p>
<p>ing a constitutional defence against a claim made by a State."  Cohens v. Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, 3 Story''s Com., 594.
</p>
<p>" Under the judiciary act, the effect of a writ of error is simply to bring the
</p>
<p>record into court, and submit the judgment of the inferior tribunal to re-exami-
</p>
<p>nation. It does not in any manner act upon the parties ; it acts only on the
</p>
<p>record. It removes the record into the supervising tribunal. Where, then, a
</p>
<p>State obtains a judgment against an individual, and the court, rendering such
</p>
<p>judgment, overrules a defence set up under the Constitution or laws of the
</p>
<p>United States, the transfer of this record into the Supreme Court, for the sole
</p>
<p>purpose of inquiring whether the judgment violates the Constitution or laws of
</p>
<p>the United States, can, with no propriety, we think, be denominated a suit
</p>
<p>commenced or prosecuted against the State whose judgment is so far re-exa-
</p>
<p>mined."  lb., pp. 695.
</p>
<p>" The mode of removal is form and not substance. Whether it be by writ
</p>
<p>of error or appeal, no claim is asserted, no demand is made by the original de-
</p>
<p>fendant. He only asserts the constitutional right to have his defence examined
</p>
<p>3G EX PARTE DORR;
</p>
<p>by that tribunal, whose province it is to construe the Constitution and laws of
</p>
<p>the Union.
</p>
<p>" The only part of the proceeding, which is in any manner personal, is the
</p>
<p>citation. And what is the citation ? It is simply notice to the opposite party,
</p>
<p>that the record is transferred into another Court, where he may appear, or de-
</p>
<p>cline to appear, as his judgment or inclination may determine. As the party
</p>
<p>who has obtained a judgment is out of Court, and may, therefore, not know that
</p>
<p>his cause is removed, common justice requires that notice of the fact should
</p>
<p>be given him. But this notice is not a suit, nor has it the effect of process.
</p>
<p>If the party does not choose to appear, he cannot be brought into Court,
</p>
<p>nor is his failure to appear considered as a default. Judgment cannot be
</p>
<p>given against him for his non-appearance ; but the judgment is to be re-ex-
</p>
<p>amined and reversed, or affirmed, in like manner, as if the party had ap-
</p>
<p>peared, and argued his cause.
</p>
<p>" The point of view, in which this writ of error, with its citation, has
</p>
<p>been considered uniformly in the Courts of the Union, has been well illus-
</p>
<p>trated by a reference to the course of this Court in suits instituted by the
</p>
<p>United States. The universally received opinion is, that no suit can be
</p>
<p>commenced or prosecuted against the United States ; that the judiciary act
</p>
<p>does not authorize such suits. Yet writs of error, accompanied with cita-
</p>
<p>tions, have uniformly issued for the removal of judgments in favor of the
</p>
<p>United States into a Superior Court, where they have, like those in favor
</p>
<p>of an individual, been re-examined, and affirmed, or reversed. It has never
</p>
<p>been suggested, that such writ of error was a suit against the United States,
</p>
<p>and, therefore, not within the jurisdiction of the appellate Court. It is, then,
</p>
<p>the opinion of the Court, that the defendant who removes a judgment, ren-
</p>
<p>dered against him by a State Court, into~thisl Court, for the purpose of re-
</p>
<p>examining the question, whether"that judgment, be in violation of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution and laws of the United States, does not commence or prosecute a
</p>
<p>suit against a State whatever may be its opinion, where the effect of the
</p>
<p>writ may be to restore the party to the possession of a thing which he de-
</p>
<p>mands." 76., 596, 597.

<p>The opinion of the Supreme Court in the case of Martin v. Hunter^ 1 Wheat.

<p>edly applicable to the case under consideration. The whole case shows con-
</p>
<p>clusively that the appellate jurisdiction of the Court extends to cases in the State
</p>
<p>Courts, as well as to those of the United States. A few passages will be cited.
</p>
<p>" As, then, by the terms of the Constitution, the appellate jurisdiction is not
</p>
<p>limited, -as to the Supreme Court, and as to this Court it may be exercised in
</p>
<p>all other cases, than those of which it has original cognizance, what is
</p>
<p>there to restrain its exercise over State tribunals in the enumerated cases ?
</p>
<p>" The appellate power is not limited by the terms of the third article to any
</p>
<p>particular Courts. The words are, ' the judicial power (which includes appel-
</p>
<p>late power) .shall extend to all cases j^ &c., and 'in all other cases before
</p>
<p>mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction.' It is the
</p>
<p>case then, and not the Courts that gives the jurisdiction. If the judicial power
</p>
<p>extends to the case, it will be in vain to search in the letter of the Constitution
</p>
<p>for any qualification, as to the tribunal, where it depends."  3 Story''s Com., 599.
</p>
<p>" If some of these cases might be entertained by State tribunals, and no ap-
</p>
<p>pellate jurisdiction, as to them, should exist, then the appellate power would^not
</p>
<p>extend to all, but to some cases."  lb., 599.
</p>
<p>" But it is plain, that the framers of the Constitution did contemplate, that
</p>
<p>cases within the judicial cognizance of the United States not only might, but
</p>
<p>would arise infthe State Courts in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>SUPREME COURT U, S. 37
</p>
<p>With this view, the sixth article declares, that ' this Constitution, and the laws
</p>
<p>of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties
</p>
<p>made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall
</p>
<p>be the supreme law of the land, and the judges, in every State, shall be bound
</p>
<p>thereby, anything, in the Constitution or laws of any State, to the contrary not-
</p>
<p>withstanding.' It is obvious that this obligation is imperative upon the State
</p>
<p>judges in their official, and not merely in their private capacities. From the
</p>
<p>very nature of their judicial duties, they would be called upon to pronounce
</p>
<p>the law, applicable to the case in judgment. They were not to decide,
</p>
<p>merely according to the laws, or Constitution of the State, but according to
</p>
<p>the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States,  ' the supreme law of
</p>
<p>the land.' " i6., 601.
</p>
<p>" It has been argued, that such an appellate jurisdiction over State Courts
</p>
<p>is inconsistent with the genius of our governments, and the spirit of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution. That the latter was never designed to act upon State sovereign-
</p>
<p>ties, but only upon the people ; and that, if the power exists, it will materially
</p>
<p>impair the sovereignty of the States, and the independence of their Courts.
</p>
<p>We cannot yield to the force of this reasoning ; it assumes principles which
</p>
<p>we cannot admit, and draws conclusions to which we do not yield our assent.
</p>
<p>lb., 603.
</p>
<p>" It is a mistake that the Constitution was not designed to operate upon
</p>
<p>States in their corporate capacities. It is crowded with provisions, which
</p>
<p>restrain or annul the sovereignty of the States, in some of the highest branches
</p>
<p>of their prerogatives.  /&., 603.
</p>
<p>" The Courts of the United States can, without question, revise the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of the executive and legislative authorities of the States, and, if
</p>
<p>they are found to be contrary to the Constitution, may declare them to be of no
</p>
<p>legal validity. Surely, the exercise of the same right over judicial tribunals
</p>
<p>is not a higher, or more dangerous act of sovereign power.  lb., 604.
</p>
<p>" It is manifest, that the Constitution has proceeded upon a theory of its
</p>
<p>own, and given and withheld powers according to the judgment of the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can people, by whom it was adopted. We can only construe its powers, and
</p>
<p>cannot inquire into the policy, or principles, which induced the grant of them.
</p>
<p>The Constitution has presumed (whether rightly or wrongly, we do not inquire),

</p>
<p>that State attachments, State prejudices, State jealousies, and State interests,
</p>
<p>might sometimes obstruct, or control, or be supposed to obstruct, or control, the
</p>
<p>regular administration of justice.  lb., 607.
</p>
<p>"There is an additional consideration, which is entitled to great weight.
</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States was designed for the common and equal
</p>
<p>benefit of all the people of the United States. The judicial power was granted
</p>
<p>for the same benign and salutary purposes. It was not to be exercised exclu-
</p>
<p>sively for the benefit of parties, who might be plaintiffs, and would elect the
</p>
<p>national forum ; but also for the protection of defendants, who might be entitled
</p>
<p>to try their rights, or assert their privileges, before the same^forum. Yet, if the
</p>
<p>construction contended for be correct, it will follow, that, as the plaintiff may
</p>
<p>always elect the State Courts, the defendant may be deprived of all the securi-
</p>
<p>ty, which the Constitution intended in aid of his rights. Such a state of things
</p>
<p>can, in no respect, be considered as giving equal rights. To obviate this
</p>
<p>difficulty, we are referred to the power, which it is admitted. Congress possess,
</p>
<p>to remove suits from State Courts to the National Courts ; and this forms the
</p>
<p>second ground upon which the argument we are considering has been attempted
</p>
<p>to be sustained.  lb., 607, 608.
</p>
<p>" A. writ of error is, indeed, but a process, which removes the record of one
</p>
<p>Court to the possession of another Court, and enables the latter to inspect the
</p>
<p>38 EX PARTE DORR;
</p>
<p>proceedings, and give such judgment, as its own opinion of the law and justice
</p>
<p>of the case may warrant. There is nothing in the nature of the process which
</p>
<p>prohibits it from being apphed by the Legislature to interlocutory, as well as
</p>
<p>final judgments. And if the right of removal from State Courts exist before
</p>
<p>judgment, because it is included in the appellate power, it must, for the same
</p>
<p>reason, exist after judgment.  /6., 609, 610.
</p>
<p>" The remedy, too, of removal of suits would be utterly inadequate to the pur-
</p>
<p>poses of the Constitution, if it could act only on the parties, and not upon the
</p>
<p>State Courts. In respect to criminal prosecutions, the difficulty seems admitted
</p>
<p>to be insurmountable ; and in respect to civil suits, there would, in many cases,
</p>
<p>be rights without corresponding remedies. If State Courts should deny the
</p>
<p>Constitutionality of the authority to remove suits from their cognizance, in what
</p>
<p>manner could they be compelled to relinquish the jurisdiction .'' In respect to
</p>
<p>criminal cases, there would at once be an end of all control ; and the State de-
</p>
<p>cisions would be paramount to the Constitution. And though, in civil suits, the
</p>
<p>Courts of the United States might act upon the parties, yet the State Courts
</p>
<p>might act in the same way ; and this conflict of jurisdictions would not only
</p>
<p>jeopard private rights, but bring into imminent peril the public interests. On
</p>
<p>the whole, the Court are of opinion, that the appellate power of the United
</p>
<p>States does extend to cases pending in the State Courts ; and that the 25th sec-
</p>
<p>tion of the judiciary act, which authorizes the exercise of this jurisdiction in the
</p>
<p>specified cases, by a writ of error, is supported by the letter and spirit of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution. We find no clause in that instrument, which limits this power; and
</p>
<p>we dare not interpose a limitation, where the people have not been disposed to
</p>
<p>create one." 76., 610. 611.
</p>
<p>The Court, in support of these strong positions, appeals to three historical
</p>
<p>facts, the latter of which, with a single remark of the Court, closes their deci-
</p>
<p>sion of this immensely important case.
</p>
<p>" It is an historical fact, that the Supreme Court of the United States have,
</p>
<p>from time to time, sustained this appellate jurisdiction, in a great variety of
</p>
<p>cases, brought from the tribunals of many of the most* important States in the
</p>
<p>Union ; and that no State tribunal has ever breathed a judicial doubt on the
</p>
<p>subject, or declined to obey the mandate of the Supreme Court, until the present
</p>
<p>occasion. This weight of contemporaneous exposition by all parties, this acqui-

<p>escence of enlightened State Courts, and these judicial decisions of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court, through so long a period, do, as we think, place the doctrine upon a
</p>
<p>foundation of authority, which cannot be shaken, without delivering over the
</p>
<p>subject to perpetual and irremediable doubts."  lb., 611, 612.
</p>
<p>The character of the case of Mr. Dorr, as it stands upon the record here pre-
</p>
<p>sented, appears to be as free from ambiguity, as are the Constitution, law, and
</p>
<p>judicial decisions to which such liberal reference has been made. The indict-
</p>
<p>ment charges Thomas W. Dorr with having committed the crime of treason
</p>
<p>against the State of Rhode Island ; with certain acts of hostility against that
</p>
<p>State, in violation cjf a statute of its Legislature. The defence set up, asserts
</p>
<p>that the statute in question is repugnant to the Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States ; that the acts in question were not acts of hostility to the State, but on
</p>
<p>the contrary, were acts of duty to the State, done and performed by said Thomas
</p>
<p>W. Dorr as the Governor thereof, having been duly elected to that office by
</p>
<p>the people of the State acting under a valid Constitution and a Republican
</p>
<p>form of government ; and that the acts of said Thomas W. Dorr, if they amount-
</p>
<p>ed to treason at all, were treason against the United States, and could not be
</p>
<p>inquired of in any State Court. The record proves that the whole defence was
</p>
<p>overruled by the Supreme Court of the State of Rhode Island. That Court
</p>
<p>held, that the crime of treason might be committed against the State, and that
</p>
<p>SUPREME COURT U. S. 39
</p>
<p>the statute of the State in relation to treason was valid ; and refused to permit
</p>
<p>the defendant to prove, or give evidence tending to prove, the validity of the
</p>
<p>Constitution under which he claimed to have acted.
</p>
<p>Here, it is contended, is a direct issue on constitutional grounds. The court has
</p>
<p>overruled one ground of defence, and refused to receive evidence in support of an-
</p>
<p>other. The jury, under the charge of the court, have found a verdict of guilty, and
</p>
<p>the court have sentenced the defendant to confinement for life in the State Prison.
</p>
<p>The defendant, sensible that injustice had been done him by the court, in overrul-
</p>
<p>ing his defence, employed all the means in his power to command, to prepare his
</p>
<p>case for revision by this tribunal. Of this fact, the record exhibits conclusive evi-
</p>
<p>dence. Why then, it may be asked, does he not, under his own hand, petition this
</p>
<p>court for a writ of error, to bring before it the record of his trial and sentence ? The
</p>
<p>affidavits which have been read give the reply. He is not permitted to sign or
</p>
<p>see a petition. He has signified his desire to bring his case before this court,
</p>
<p>in the only way or manner left open to him, by placing his intentions upon the
</p>
<p>record. He seems to have anticipated a surprise, and it has been sprung upon
</p>
<p>him, for he was hurried to the State Prison without allowing him time to have
</p>
<p>his application for a writ of error prepared, or even to consult with his counsel
</p>
<p>upon the subject. Harsh and anomalous as this act was, it appears to have
</p>
<p>been but the prelude to a series of oppressive measures, all conspiring to de-
</p>
<p>prive the defendant of his right to a revision of his defence by this court.
</p>
<p>By a law of the State {p. 414, Pvb. Laws R. /.), the control of the State
</p>
<p>Prison is vested in a board of seven inspectors, appointed annually by the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature. The act comprises thirty-five sections which, generally, are so many
</p>
<p>rules and regulations for the government of the prison. One section authorizes
</p>
<p>the inspectors to make rules and regulations, ^^ provided the same are not incon-
</p>
<p>sistent with law^ Many of the rules are humane. They require that one of
</p>
<p>the inspectors " shall, at least once in every week, visit each prisoner, and in the
</p>
<p>absence of the warden and under-keepers, examine into his situation, hear any
</p>
<p>complaints that he may make, and see that the rules and regulations of the prison
</p>
<p>be strictly observed ; they shall keep a particular record of all their meetings
</p>
<p>and proceedings, of their weekly visits, and complaints made to them by prison-
</p>
<p>ers, whether well or ill-founded. The inspectors may provide for the comfort
</p>
<p>of the prisoners, by admitting such communication to and from their friends and

</p>
<p>among themselves, and such books and other articles as they may deem expe-
</p>
<p>dient." The inspectors shall appoint the warden, who shall appoint under-
</p>
<p>keepers, keep a journal, in which, among other things, he shall enter " all
</p>
<p>complaints that are made to him by the convicts ;" all punishments, and the
</p>
<p>visits of the inspectors and physicians, and " see that the rules of the prison are
</p>
<p>strictly obeyed."
</p>
<p>" Sec. 2S. The governor and lieutenant governor of the State, the speaker
</p>
<p>of the House of Representatives, the secretary of State, the attorney general,
</p>
<p>and the justices of the Supreme Court shall, ex-officio, be ojficial visitors of the
</p>
<p>prison."
</p>
<p>" Sec. 29. No person not an official visitor, shall be allowed to visit the
</p>
<p>prison, without a written permit from one of the inspectors ; nor shall any per-
</p>
<p>son other than an official visitor have any conversation or communication with
</p>
<p>any convict, except as provided for in the general rules established for the
</p>
<p>prison. This rule may be dispensed with in favor of any person visiting the
</p>
<p>prison from without the State, for the purposes of general information, by a
</p>
<p>written permit from two inspectors."
</p>
<p>" Sec. 35. All breaches of this act shall be punished by indictment."
</p>
<p>The Court will perceive that there is nothing in these prison rules to prevent
</p>
<p>a man from seeing his counsel, and petitioning for a writ of error. This is his
</p>
<p>40 EX PARTE DORR;
</p>
<p>right, in prison, or out of prison. This is the law of the land, and, if that would
</p>
<p>make the case any stronger, the laws of the land are recognized by these prison
</p>
<p>laws. The inspectors are authorized to make rules provided the same are not
</p>
<p>inconsistent with law. The prisoners, although by a fiction of law, not a reality,
</p>
<p>called civilly dead, still have rights. They have the right to complain, and the
</p>
<p>officers of the prison are bound to make record of these complaints, and redress
</p>
<p>such as may be well founded. Nor are these the only means of protecting the
</p>
<p>prisoners from oppression, provided by the laws of Rhode Island. The execu-
</p>
<p>tive, and certain other officers of the State, including the justices of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court, are, ex-officio, official visitors of the prison. They can go in and out
</p>
<p>freely, without let or hindrance. They can read the record of the inspectors,
</p>

</p>
<p>it is their duty so to do, and see that the officers of the prison perform their
</p>
<p>duty. That the prisoners be not oppressed ; that " cruel and unusual punish-
</p>
<p>ments " be not inflicted ; that the laws of the land be duly executed there, in
</p>
<p>the prison, as well as in other parts of the State. For this the official visitors
</p>
<p>were appointed. How have the inspectors and official visitors performed their
</p>
<p>respective duties 1 Let the evidence in this case, the affidavits that have been
</p>
<p>read, answer.
</p>
<p>No sooner is Dorr, in hot haste, hurried to prison, than these mild and humane
</p>
<p>rules, these laws of the State, manifestly referring to the supreme law of the
</p>
<p>land, as the basis upon which they are to rest, are superseded by a new code,
</p>
<p>put in practice by the prison inspectors, if not in solemn form enacted by them,
</p>
<p>and put upon their records. In violation of these laws, the inspectors of the
</p>
<p>prison say that Dorr shall not see father, mother, brother, or sister, nor even
</p>
<p>counsel, and the stern edict is sternly enforced. After a month of delay, the
</p>
<p>former counsel of Dorr made a formal application for liberty to consult with
</p>
<p>him, in the prison, in reference to an appeal to this tribunal by a writ of error.
</p>
<p>This was refused by the inspectors. The latter proposed a reference to the
</p>
<p>judges of the Supreme Court of the State, and to the Legislature. Irregular as
</p>
<p>this procedure was, it was resorted to, and proved ine^ectual. All access to
</p>
<p>their client having been denied them, Messrs. Eurgess and Turner, for themselves
</p>
<p>and Mr. Atwell, abandoned the cause, and declared, that as they were forbidden
</p>
<p>to consult with him they would take no further measures or means to carry up

</p>
<p>the case by writ of error.
</p>
<p>In this extremity, the neighbors of the prisoner, prompted by feelings of hu-
</p>
<p>manit)', interposed, by employing General Fessenden and myself to render our aid
</p>
<p>in bringing the case, by writ of error, before this Court for revision ; in the confi-
</p>
<p>dent expectation, that, under the circumstances, the peculiar hardships of this
</p>
<p>case, such interposition will be looked upon with favor, and allowed by this tri-
</p>
<p>bunal. The affidavits prove, that by virtue of this employment, we applied to
</p>
<p>the inspectors of the prison for liberty to see the prisoner upon the subject, and
</p>
<p>that this request was, after taking time for consideration, refused. That we
</p>
<p>then presented a petition to Thomas M Burgess, Esq., mayor of Providence,
</p>
<p>who is the chairman of the board of inspectors, with a request that he would
</p>
<p>permit said Dorr to read and sign it, if he should think proper to do so. The
</p>
<p>reply of Mr. Burgess to this plain and reasonable request, exhibits not merely
</p>
<p>his own decision, but the long foregone determination of the authorities of
</p>
<p>Rhode Island. He speaks for himself, and he speaks for his fellows. He
</p>
<p>knows their mind and will, upon the subject, for he has consulted with them ;
</p>
<p>and they already agree with him, that Dorr should never sign or see such a
</p>
<p>petition ! That it was the determination of the authorities of the State, that said
</p>
<p>Dorr should have no opportunity to carry up his case by writ of error, and they
</p>
<p>did not intend that there should he-any interference on behalf o said Dorr for
</p>
<p>SUPREME COURT U. S. ^
</p>
<p>that end ! This bold attack upon the rights of a prisoner in their power, suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently indicates the kind of law and order which prevails in Rhode Island,
</p>
<p>The authorities of that State are not ignorant of the right of Dorr to come before
</p>
<p>this tribunal for a revision of his case. They know it full well. They tacitly
</p>
<p>admit that they know the fact, by combining to deprive him of the benefit of it.
</p>
<p>After much persuasion, the chairman of the board of inspectors consented to
</p>
<p>show the petition to the other members, and consult with them. But, as he de-
</p>
<p>clared beforehand, so the fact turned out. He knewlthat they, as well as him-
</p>
<p>self, were resolved that Dorr should neither sign nor see the petition. The,
</p>
<p>letter of this officer which accompanies the return of the papers, and which
</p>
<p>makes a part of the evidence in support of this motion, after stating, that the
</p>
<p>other members of the board had been consulted, and now as before, agreed with
</p>
<p>him in taking no action upon the request, adds as the reason, " because it is so
</p>
<p>very similar in its character to one which the general assembly, at their October
</p>
<p>session, virtually refused to grant."
</p>
<p>Another branch of the government, the executive, it appears by the affidavit
</p>
<p>of Col. Eddy, was applied to, to permit the prisoner to see and sign the petition.
</p>
<p>As the Governor was an official visitor, it was supposed there could be no im-
</p>
<p>propriety in his taking the petition to the prisoner, for perusal and signature.
</p>
<p>The law of the State upon the subject was supposed by distinguished civilians
</p>
<p>to authorize the Governor to do this ; but that officer took a diffi^rent view of
</p>
<p>his power under that law, and as he alleged, for want of power, refused to
</p>
<p>present the petition to the prisoner or permit any one else to do so.
</p>
<p>Without questioning the sincerity of the Governor in the view which he ex-
</p>
<p>presses of his want of power, it may be remarked as a singular fact, that no
</p>
<p>branch of the Government of Rhode Iland could be induced to make the
</p>
<p>slightest effort to promote the desire of the prisoner to obtain a writ of error.
</p>
<p>The inspectors declare that the authorities of the State have resolved that
</p>
<p>Dorr shall have no opportunity thus to carry up his case, and nothing appears
</p>
<p>to discredit their assertion. What a spectacle I The whole power of the
</p>
<p>State placed in the hands of a horde of prison inspectors, and brought to bear
</p>
<p>upon a single individual, who is claimed to be civilly dead ! And for what ?
</p>
<p>To keep him out of this Court ! Such a determination indicates anything but
</p>
<p>confidence in a cause which requires such means to sustain it. Dorr relies

<p>upon his innocence, and upon his ability to show, that in order to procure a
</p>
<p>verdict against him, the Constitution has been violated. The authorities of
</p>
<p>Rhode Island rely, not upon Dorr's supposed guilt, nor upon a consciousness
</p>
<p>that in his trial they have not violated the Constitution ; but upon the vigilance
</p>
<p>of their board of prison inspectors to keep from his sight a petition ! They
</p>
<p>seem to rely, too, on the supposed power of their prison inspectors to persuade
</p>
<p>Dorr to petition, not to this Court to allow him to establish his innocence, if he
</p>
<p>can do so, but to them for a pardon ! They say that if he Mall ask for a par-
</p>
<p>don, he shall have it promptly. The chairman of the board of inspectors says
</p>
<p>he told him so ! What was Dorr's reply .'' We have not heard it yet ; but
</p>
<p>if this Court shall issue its process to bring him here, they may hear it from
</p>
<p>his own lips, probably in the words of our revolutionary fathers in reply to a
</p>
<p>similar proposal from the minions of George III.: " We hav^e committed no
</p>
<p>offence, and want no pardon !"
</p>
<p>The authorities of Rhode Island seem to be under a delusion, that there
</p>
<p>is no safety for themselves until Dorr shall confess that he is guilty of a crime
</p>
<p>of which he asserts his innocence, and sue for pardon. He is ready to prove
</p>
<p>his innocence before this Court, or failing to do it, to suffer the consequences.
</p>
<p>This will not answer the purposes of the authorities aforesaid. Indeed, it
</p>
<p>seems to be what they most dread. A delusion not entirely unhke this, per-

</p>
<p>vaded several towns in Massachusetts at the time of the Salem witchcraft.
</p>
<p>Some of the most quiet, harmless, and innocent persons in that vicinity, were
</p>
<p>indicted for the alleged crime of witchcraft  a crime which had no existence
</p>
<p>but in the minds of the accusers, and the authorities before whom the accused
</p>
<p>were arraigned. The delusion was so general, that to be accused was almost
</p>
<p>certain to ensure conviction. To defend, was worse than useless. Confession
</p>
<p>of guilt, or death under the gallows, were the alternatives. The friends of the
</p>
<p>accused joined with the authorities in imploring the accused to confess guilt.
</p>
<p>" But we are innocent," said the accused. " No matter," was the reply ;
</p>
<p>" you have no other way to escape death ! Death on the gallows I !"
</p>
<p>In this awful predicament, some of tlie accused made confession of guilt, and
</p>
<p>thus saved their lives. Margaret Jacobs made such a confession, and was par-
</p>
<p>doned, or entitled to pardon. But Margaret Jacobs was a conscientious woman,
</p>
<p>and was seized with horror on reflecting that she had confessed to a lie. She
</p>
<p>sent for a friend, who drew up for her a retraction of her confession, which
</p>
<p>she signed as it were in the face of death and the authonties, and died under the
</p>
<p>gallows, rejoicing in her innocence, and that she had, by her retraction,
</p>
<p>escaped the lying snare of the authorities. Margaret Jacobs suffered, but not
</p>
<p>for crime. The alleged crime of witchcraft was wiped away by confession ;
</p>
<p>but she suffered for the truth, for asserting her innocence !
</p>
<p>At length one of the accused commenced a suit against his accusers for de-
</p>
<p>famation, which did much to arrest the delusion. The authorities, their coun-
</p>
<p>sellors and prompters, were made sensible of the crimes they had all commit-
</p>
<p>ted, in combining to accuse, condemn, and execute, innocent persons. They
</p>
<p>did what they could to mitigate the sufferings of some of the living victims,
</p>
<p>but they could not re-animate Marga':et Jacobs, and other tenants of the grave
</p>
<p>on "Gallows Hill."
</p>
<p>The authorities of Rhode Island seem disposed to treat Dorr as Paul was
</p>
<p>sometimes treated by the Roman Courts. That great Apostle of the Gentiles
</p>
<p>was a lawyer of no inconsiderable attainments in the science of the civil law.
</p>
<p>He well knew the Roman law ; and when falsely acc^used by his Jewish or
</p>
<p>Roman brethren, appealed to its provisions, to protect him from mock trials, as
</p>
<p>well as from punishment without trial. This Apostle had an exalted opinion
</p>
<p>of " due process of law " before punishment. The Supreme Court, the Court

</p>
<p>of the highest appellate jurisdiction in Paul's time, was held by Ca3Sar. Falsely
</p>
<p>charged with sedition, and other crimes, perhaps treason, and finding that his
</p>
<p>enemies had conspired against his life ; bandied about by the Roman Judges,
</p>
<p>and in danger of being sent to Jerusalem to be sacrificed, the Apostle asserted
</p>
<p>his right of appeal. " I appeal," said he " to Ca?sar :" and the Court of Fes-
</p>
<p>tus, after due conference upon the matter, allowed the writ of error. " Hast
</p>
<p>thou appealed unto Caesar ? unto Ccesar shalt thou go," said the Court : and
</p>
<p>they sent the illustrious prisoner, through perils of storm and shipwreck, up to
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court, to the judgment-seat of Caesar, for the establishment of his
</p>
<p>innocence.
</p>
<p>In this last particular, the authorities of Rhode Island have departed widely
</p>
<p>from the precedent of the Roman Court. When Dorr asserts his innocence,
</p>
<p>and appeals to Caesar, to the Supreme Court of this country for an opportunity
</p>
<p>to establish it, the authorities of Rhode Island combine together, and tell him,
</p>
<p>unto Caesar shalt thou not go ! You may confess yourself guilty of a crime of
</p>
<p>which you say you are innocent, and ask ou?' pardon ; but you shall not go to
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of the United States for justification ! You shall not go to
</p>
<p>Washington with your case at all, but you shall go to the State prison and paint
</p>
<p>fans for life, or ask our pardon ! Such is the practical language of the barbar-
</p>
<p>ous authorities of Rhode Island, to an American citizen who, it is believed, this
</p>
<p>SUPREME COURT U. S. 4S
</p>
<p>Court will say, has a right to send up his defence for revision. If such men
</p>
<p>do not out-Herod the Herods of Galilee, they out-Algerine the Algerines of
</p>
<p>Barbary ! This contempt of the supreme law, and of the rights of American
</p>
<p>citizens, on the part of the authorities of Rhode Island, brings to mind another
</p>
<p>incident in the life of St. Paul. In company with Silas, Paul encountered the
</p>
<p>witchcraft or divination of a fortune-teller, and cast out the evil spirit. In re-
</p>
<p>venge for the lost hope of their gains, the members of the craft dragged Paul
</p>
<p>and Silas before the magistrates, who stripped off' their clothes, and ordered
</p>
<p>them to be lynched until, perhaps, the blood ran down to their heels. Cast
</p>
<p>into prison, under a strict charge to the jailor, that officer put in force the new
</p>
<p>and severe rules and regulations of the authorities. An earthquake suddenly
</p>
<p>interposed and shook every stone in the foundation of the prison, and set the
</p>
<p>prisoners at liberty to escape, but they would not flee. The warden was
</p>
<p>alarmed, and the magistrates too, but not like the warden, to contrition. The
</p>
<p>magistrates sent their othcers to the warden, with orders to let Paul and Silas
</p>
<p>go, and the warden delivered the message with an exhortation to peace. Now
</p>
<p>let us hear the law from the illustrious prisoner, the Christian, as well as the
</p>
<p>Jewish and the Roman lawyer. " They have beaten us openly, uncondemned,
</p>
<p>being Romans"  with the rights of Romans, to a trial, aye, and a revision of
</p>
<p>defence, too, before punishment  " and have cast us into prison ; and now do
</p>
<p>they think to thrust us out privily ? nay, verily ; but let them come themselves,
</p>
<p>and fetch us out." And he made them do it. He made them come down to
</p>
<p>the prison, shattered as it was, and attend to their own jail delivery. Paul
</p>
<p>knew the law, and he compelled the magistrates, the courts vvithout even origi-
</p>
<p>nal jurisdiction in the case, ultimately to submit to its supremacy, and certify
</p>
<p>him free. Instead of praying to such courts {or pardon, Paul soon taught them
</p>
<p>to pray to him and Silas for impunity for such outrageous acts of violence, per-
</p>
<p>petrated in the consecrated sanctuary of justice.
</p>
<p>An interposition of that character is not now to be expected. Nor is it
</p>
<p>needful. Let but the process of this court go forth, to bring up either Dorr or
</p>
<p>his case, and if the autliorities of Rhode Island do not tremble as did the magis-
</p>
<p>trates who lynched Paul, the former may have as good an opportunity to certify
</p>
<p>Dorr free from the crime of treason, as the latter had to release Paul. At any
</p>
<p>rate. Dorr thinks he has a right to come here for a revision ; and until he does

</p>
<p>come here, or learns from this Court that he cannot come, he "will never ask for
</p>
<p>pardon. If this Court should revise his defence, and say that he had commit-
</p>
<p>ted treason, the decision would doubtless have its due weight with him, and
</p>
<p>with the great body of the people who deem him innocent, and will so deem
</p>
<p>him, until this Court shall decide against him. In that event, although con-
</p>
<p>scious of nothing but pure and laudable intentions in the course he has pursued,
</p>
<p>he might perhaps be justified in asking for a pardon. If he could not do that,
</p>
<p>he would submit to his punishment with dignified composure.
</p>
<p>That this case is clearly embraced by the appellate jurisdiction of this Court,
</p>
<p>will probably not be denied. Still it may not be amiss to refer the Court to one
</p>
<p>other case ; that of Croioell v. Randall, 'iOth Peters'' R.., 392, 39S, in which,
</p>
<p>after reference to many cases, the Court consider the rule as too firmly settled
</p>
<p>to be shaken. The writ of error in that case was disallowed because the record
</p>
<p>did not exhibit a case of jurisdiction. Admitting this Court to have jurisdiction
</p>
<p>in this case, it is important to inquire whether either the executive, legislative, or
</p>
<p>judicial power of any State, or the three branches of a State government com-
</p>
<p>bined, can, by any means, deprive this Court of such jurisdiction. That the
</p>
<p>disposition to do so has existed, appears by the case of Martin v. Hunter, as
</p>
<p>well as by the case of Dorr. But the question, though important, seems to be
</p>
<p>well settled. So far as power is clearly given by the Constitution to this Court,

<p>The cases of McGulloc/i v. Maryland, 4 WheaL, 316, and Weston v. The City

<p>might be cited, but the position is deemed too strong to need their support.

<p>by the judiciary act of 1789. The latter mode, it is maintained, is also pre-
</p>
<p>scribed by the same act, although, it may be admitted, some degree of ambigui-

<p>ty may appear in the provisions of that act, in this, and some other important

</p>
<p>particulars.
</p>
<p>The object of this part of the act of 1789 was, to carry out, into practical
</p>
<p>operation, two important provisions of the Constitution ; the one relative to the
</p>
<p>appellate jurisdiction of this court, and the other to the great privilege or right,
</p>
<p>of the writ of habeas corpus. The provisions are remedial, and must be con-
</p>
<p>strued in favor of and not against, the remedy. The jurisdiction having been
</p>
<p>given, the duty was imperative to provide the means necessary to its exercise ;
</p>
<p>if, indeed, the power of the court to issue the writ in such a case as this, is not,
</p>
<p>necessarily, incident to these two constitutional provisions.
</p>
<p>The 14th section of that act, in providing, "that the courts of the United
</p>
<p>States shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all
</p>
<p>other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary
</p>
<p>for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and
</p>
<p>usages of law," was, beyond question, intended, to the full extent of its terms, to
</p>
<p>apply to these two provisions. The sentence gives ample power, and it gives
</p>
<p>no more. The reason or object of the power is given  the exercise of jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion, and the writs must be issued according to law. The power is manifestly
</p>
<p>within the scope and objects of the Constitution, and no necessity existed for a
</p>
<p>further proviso to restrict it.
</p>
<p>Ihe next sentence gives power to the separate justices of the courts to issue
</p>
<p>SUPREME COURT U. S. 45
</p>
<p>writs of habeas corpus, not for the necessary exercise of jurisdiction, but for the
</p>
<p>purpose of inquiry into the cause of commitment ; and to this sentence is annexed
</p>
<p>a proviso, which, it is maintained, cannot be so apphed to the former sentence,
</p>
<p>if applied to it in any degree, as to deprive this court of the power of exercising
</p>
<p>a clear case of appellate jurisdiction. Such a construction, it is apprehended,
</p>
<p>would not only eviscerate this clause of a remedial statute, but would strike at
</p>
<p>the Constitution ; and in all cases like the one now under consideration, would
</p>
<p>operate as a perpetual suspension of the " privilege of the writ of habeas cor-
</p>
<p>pus.^^ So favorably has this provision of the Constitution been interpreted by
</p>
<p>the State judges, that they have issued writs of habeas corpus, " in cases where
</p>
<p>the party has been in custody under the authority of process of the courts of the Uni-
</p>
<p>ted States.''^  3 Story'^s Com. on Con., 625. It would be a singular anomaly in
</p>
<p>our system of government, to allow the inferior power to issue the writ of ha-
</p>
<p>beas corpus and take a person from the custody of the superior power ; and deny
</p>
<p>to the superior power the right to issue the writ, when it should be necessary
</p>
<p>to the exercise of a case of acknowledged jurisdiction, because the party might
</p>
<p>be in custody of the inferior power. And shall the inferior power incarcerate a
</p>
<p>man who has a right to come before this tribunal for a revision of his defence,
</p>
<p>and say that he shall have no opportunity to come up hither .'' Shall the State
</p>
<p>of Rhode Island be sustained in such a course, or shall she be made to bow in
</p>
<p>submission to the " supreme law of the land," as uniformly interpreted by this
</p>
<p>court. The great States of New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio and Ma-
</p>
<p>ryland have promptly submitted to the decisions of this court. So must the
</p>
<p>small State of Rhode Island submit, if she shall be found, as other States have
</p>
<p>been found, to have passed acts repugnant to the Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>A case like this of Dorr's has never before occurred. It will be in vain,
</p>
<p>therefore, to seek for precedents entirely applicable to it. The case. Ex parte
</p>
<p>BoUman (4 Crunch R., 75), may be referred to, as sustaining the general prin-
</p>
<p>ciple, that the power of Courts, and of this Court, to issue writs of habeas cor-
</p>
<p>pus, for the exercise of'their respective jurisdictions, is a constitutional power,
</p>
<p>and is given to this Court by the judiciary act of 1789. The Court in that
</p>
<p>case granted the writ of habeas corpus, because it had appellate jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>In the case, Ex parte Kearney (1th Wheatonh R., 38), the Court refused to

<p>grant the writ, because it had no jurisdiction in the case. The power of this
</p>
<p>Court to issue the writ is, it is confidently contended, co-extensive with its ap-
</p>
<p>pellate jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>The friends of the prisoner who have petitioned for the interposition of this
</p>
<p>Court in the case, have, in common with the great body of the people whose
</p>
<p>attention has been drawn to the subject, taken a deep interest in having the
</p>
<p>case deliberately revised by this Court. Coming as its members do, from va-
</p>
<p>rious and distant States, and removed by their official stations, as well as by
</p>
<p>habit and age, from exciting party contests, the solemn judgment of this tribu-
</p>
<p>nal in this, as it has in other exciting cases, would doubtless allay every improper
</p>
<p>feeling, and be cheerfully, nay, joyfully acquiesced in by the whole country.
</p>
<p>If the Court shall now decide to issue the writ of habeas corpus, and bring the
</p>
<p>prisoner to this place, his friends, who have long sympathized with his sufier-
</p>
<p>ings, will be enabled to mingle with unwonted zest in the scenes of gladness
</p>
<p>and joy which the approaching holidays will witness. The act, it is main-
</p>
<p>tained, is due to the case ; and the time, it is submitted, would be exceedingly
</p>
<p>appropriate for the performance of it.

<p>46 EX PARTE DORR;
</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE McLean DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT OVER-
</p>
<p>RULING THE MOTION.
</p>
<p>JSx parte : Application of Thomas W. Dorr for a writ of habeas corpus.
</p>
<p>Thomas W. Dorr was convicted before the Supreme Court of Rhode Island,
</p>
<p>at March term, 1844, of treason against the State of Rhode Island, and sen-
</p>
<p>tenced to the State's prison for life. And it appears from the affidavits of
</p>
<p>Francis C. Treadvi^ell, a counsellor at law of this court, and others, that per-
</p>
<p>sonal access to Dorr, in his confinement, to ascertain whether he desires a writ
</p>
<p>of error to remove the record of his conviction to this court, has been refused-
</p>
<p>On this ground the above application has been made.
</p>
<p>Have the court power to issue a writ of habeas corpus in this case ? This is
</p>
<p>a preliminary question, and must be first considered.
</p>
<p>The original jurisdiction of this court is limited by the Constitution to cases
</p>
<p>affectin"" ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and where a State is
</p>
<p>a party. Its appellate jurisdiction is regulated by acts of Congress. Under
</p>
<p>the common law, it can exercise no jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>As this case cannot be brought under the head of original jurisdiction, if
</p>
<p>sustainable, it must be under the appellate power.
</p>
<p>The 14th section of the judiciary act of 1789 provides, "That the courts
</p>
<p>of the United States shall have power to issue wnts oi scire facias, habeas
</p>
<p>corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may
</p>
<p>be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to
</p>
<p>the principles and usages of law. And that either of the justices of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, as well as judges of the district courts, shall have power to
</p>
<p>grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of
</p>
<p>commitment : provided that writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend
</p>
<p>to prisoners in jail, unless where they are in custody under or by color of
</p>
<p>the authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some
</p>
<p>court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify."
</p>
<p>In the trial of Dorr, it was insisted that the law of the State, under which
</p>
<p>he was prosecuted, was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.
</p>
<p>And on this ground a writ of error is desired under the twenty-fifth section of
</p>
<p>the judiciary act above named. That as the prayer for this writ can only be
</p>
<p>made by Dorr, or by some one under his authority, and as access to him in prison

</p>
<p>is denied, it is insisted that the writ to bring him before the court is the only
</p>
<p>means through which this court can exercise jurisdiction in his case by a writ
</p>
<p>of error.
</p>
<p>Even if this were admitted, yet the question recurs, w^hether this court has
</p>
<p>power to issue the writ to bring him before it. That it has no such power
</p>
<p>under the common law, is clear. And it is equally clear that the power nowhere
</p>
<p>exists, unless it be found in the fourteenth section above cited.
</p>
<p>The power given to the courts in this section to issue writs o^ scire facias ^
</p>
<p>habeas corpus, &c., as regards the writ of habeas corpus is restricted by the
</p>
<p>proviso to cases where a prisoner is " is in custody under or by color of the
</p>
<p>authority of the United States, or has been committed for trial before some
</p>
<p>court of the same, or is necessary to be brought into court to testify." This is
</p>
<p>so clear, from the language of the section, that any illustration of it would seem
</p>
<p>to be unnecessary. The words of the proviso are unambiguous. They admit
</p>
<p>of but one construction ; and that they qualify and restrict the preceding pro-
</p>
<p>visions of the section, is indisputable.
</p>
<p>Neither this, nor any other court of the United States, or judge thereof, can
</p>
<p>issue a habeas corpus to bring up a prisoner who is in custody under a sentence
</p>
<p>or execution of a State court, for any other purpose than to be used as a wit-
</p>
<p>EX PARTE DORR; SUPREME COURT U. S. 47
</p>
<p>ness. And it is immaterial whether the imprisonment be under civil or criminal
</p>
<p>process. As the law now stands, an individual who may be indicted in a circuit
</p>
<p>court, for treason against the United States, is beyond the power of federal courts
</p>
<p>and judges, if he be in custody under the authority of a Slate.
</p>
<p>Dorr is in confinement under the sentence of the Supreme Court of Rhode
</p>
<p>Island  consequently this court has no power to issue a habeas corpus to bring
</p>
<p>him before it. His presence here is not required as a witness, but to signify to
</p>
<p>the court whether he desires a writ of error to bring before this tribunal the
</p>
<p>record of his conviction.
</p>
<p>The counsel in this application prays for a writ of error ; but, as it appears
</p>
<p>from his own admission that he does not act under the authority of Dorr, but
</p>
<p>at the request of his friends, the prayer cannot be granted. In this view, it
</p>
<p>is unnecessary to decide whether the counsel has stated a case which, with the
</p>
<p>authority of his client, entitles him to a writ of error.
</p>
<p>The motion for a habeas corpus is overruled.
</p>
<p>Ex parte : In the matter of Thomas Wilson Dorr, on petition for a M'rit of
</p>
<p>habeas corpus, or for a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the State of Rhode
</p>
<p>Island :
</p>
<p>On consideration of the motion made by Mr. Treadwell, of counsel for the
</p>
<p>petitioner, on a prior day of the present term of this court, to wit : on Wednes-
</p>
<p>day, the 11th instant, and of the argument of counsel in support of the motion
</p>
<p>thereupon had, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court that the said
</p>
<p>motion be, and the same is hereby, overruled.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Justice McLean.
