<p>IT is decree'd. Kor (hall thy Fate, O Rome,
</p>
<p>Refift my vow. Though Hills were fet on Hilb,
</p>
<p>And Seas met Seas, to guard thee j I would through ?
</p>
<p>I, plough up Rocks, fteep as the Alps, in duft.
</p>
<p>And lave the Tyrrhene Waters into Clouds;
</p>
<p>But I would reach thy Head, thy Head, proud City.
</p>
<p>The ills that I have done, cannot be fafe
</p>
<p>But by attempting greater; and I feel
</p>
<p>A Spirit within me, chides my fluggifh hands.
</p>
<p>And fays, they have been innocent too long.
</p>
<p>Was I a Man, bred great, as Rome her ftlf ?
</p>
<p>One, form'd for all her Honours, all her Glories?
</p>
<p>Equal to all her Titles ? that could ftand
</p>
<p>Clofe up, with Atltu^ and fuftain her name

<p>By her no voice, when I flood Candidate ^
</p>
<p>To be Commander in the Pontiik^ War ?
</p>
<p>I will, hereafter, call her Step-dame, ever.
</p>
<p>If me can loofe her Nature , I can loofe
</p>
<p>My Piety ; and in her ftony entrails
</p>
<p>Dig me a feat: where, I will live again,

<p>When, wooing her, I firft remov'd a Wife,

<p>Not t'have begun with, but to end with more,

<p>And greater : tc He that, building, ftays at one

</p>
<p>Twas how to raife thee, I was meditating ;
</p>
<p>To make fome a.i of mine anfvver thy love :
</p>
<p>That love, that, when my ftate was now quite funk,
</p>
<p>Game with thy wealth, and weigh'd it up again,

<p>And made my emergent- fortune once more look

<p>Above the main; which., now, mall hit the Stars,

<p>And flick my Oreftill^ there, amongft 'hem,

<p>If any temped can but make the billow,
</p>
<p>And any billow can but lift her greatnefs.
</p>
<p>But, I muft pray my Love, (he will put on
</p>
<p>Like habits with my felf. I have to do
</p>
<p>With many men, and many natures. Some,
</p>
<p>That muft be blown, and footh'd ; as Lemulut,

<p>And a vain dream, out of the Sjbill's Books,
</p>
<p>That a third man, of that great Family,
</p>
<p>Whereof he is defcended* the Cornclii,
</p>
<p>Should be a King m-Rome : which I have hir'd ;
</p>
<p>The flattering Augures to interpret him,

<p>Whofe valour I have turn'd into his poifon,

<p>At face of a fulF Cloud, and ftand his ire:
