<p>The account of the conspiracy of the Spaniards

<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>No enterprise, in which men can be engag-
</p>
<p>ed, calls into action such elevated faculties as
</p>
<p>a conspiracy. Courage, prudence, and fidel-
</p>
<p>ity, all equally essential, are qualities rare in
</p>
<p>their nature ; but it is still more rare to find
</p>
<p>them united in the same individual. As men
</p>
<p>naturally flatter themselves that they are
</p>
<p>more beloved than they really are, especially
</p>
<p>when they deserve, and have endeavored to
</p>
<p>inspire esteem, some leaders of conspiracies
</p>
<p>rely implicitly upon the attachment of their
</p>
<p>associates ; but the most ardent attachment
</p>
<p>is seldom stronger than the fear of death.
</p>
<p>And, moreover, extreme warmth of attach-
</p>
<p>ment is of itself too apt to confuse the judg-

</p>
<p>ment in unexpected occurrences ; it is incom-
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>patible with the necessary discretion ; and
</p>
<p>generally those who are excessively anxious
</p>
<p>to accomplish an object are too unable to con-
</p>
<p>ceal their anxiety.
</p>
<p>If, from the known prudence of a conspira-
</p>
<p>rator, reliance may be placed on his discre-
</p>
<p>tion, he will not, for that very reason, engage
</p>
<p>in such an undertaking so zealously as others ;
</p>
<p>he will perceive the magnitude and probabil-
</p>
<p>ity of the danger to which he exposes himself,
</p>
<p>and will provide in the outset the means of
</p>
<p>retreat ; he will be apt to reflect that the ad-
</p>
<p>vantages he may derive are uncertain, and
</p>
<p>that, if he makes a disclosure, he may be sure
</p>
<p>of safety and reward.
</p>
<p>Besides, the talents of men are, for the most
</p>
<p>part, the result of their experience ; and they
</p>
<p>rarely reason correctly in the first important
</p>
<p>affair in which they engage. The wisest are
</p>
<p>those who profit by the errors they have com-
</p>
<p>mitted^ and deduce from their consequences,
</p>
<p>rules for the government of their future con-
</p>
<p>duct. But as there are no points of resem-
</p>
<p>blance, whether the danger or the difficulty

</p>
<p>be considered, between a conspiracy and any
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>other affair whatever, the experience, which
</p>
<p>may be otherwise acquired, can be of no use
</p>
<p>in the conduct of an enterprise of this des-
</p>
<p>cription. To enable an associate in a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to avoid committing an error, he must
</p>
<p>have been engaged in one previously ; but it
</p>
<p>seldom happens that the same man is con-
</p>
<p>cerned in two. If the first succeeds, the ad-
</p>
<p>vantages he derives from it generally relieve
</p>
<p>him from the necessity of exposing himself
</p>
<p>again to the same dangers ; if it fails, he per-
</p>
<p>ishes ; or, if he escapes, he will rarely be
</p>
<p>willing to incur, a second time, the same
</p>
<p>peril.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it must be observed that,
</p>
<p>however strong may be their hatred of ty-
</p>
<p>rants, men always love themselves more than
</p>
<p>they hate others. It is not enough that eve-
</p>
<p>ry conspirator is in fact faithful, each must
</p>
<p>also be convinced that all his associates will
</p>
<p>be equally faithful ; and a leader must have
</p>
<p>regard to all the panic terrors, and ridiculous
</p>
<p>apprehensions which may seize them, as well
</p>
<p>as to the real difficulties which he may have

<p>to encounter, either being alike capable of

</p>
<p>ruining his enterprise. Add to this, that a
</p>
<p>word spoken of something else, a gesture
</p>
<p>made without motive, may excite suspicion
</p>
<p>of discovery, and precipitate the execution ;
</p>
<p>that a circumstance of not the slightest im-
</p>
<p>portance will sometimes frighten men for no
</p>
<p>other reason than because it was unexpected ;
</p>
<p>and that men are so constituted that they al-
</p>
<p>ways apprehend their secret is known, and
</p>
<p>every thing said or done in their presence
</p>
<p>leads them to sqspect they are discovered.
</p>
<p>He who is conscious of guilt is stctrtled at ev-
</p>
<p>ery thing.
</p>
<p>If these difficulties are almost insurmount-
</p>
<p>able in conspiracies against a single person,
</p>
<p>how much greater must they be in conspira-
</p>
<p>cies aimed against a large number at once,
</p>
<p>for instance a city or a kingdom, and which
</p>
<p>of course require more time to arrange, and
</p>
<p>more persons to execute them.
</p>
<p>These considerations have always led me
</p>
<p>to regard this kind of enterprise as furnishing
</p>
<p>the most instructive portions of history ;
</p>
<p>and have induced me to give to the public an

<p>CONSPIRACY,
</p>
<p>The controversy between the holy pontiff, Paul V,
</p>
<p>and the republic of Venice, having been terminated
</p>
<p>by the mediation of France, in a manner preserving
</p>
<p>to the holy See the honor due to it, and to the Vene-
</p>
<p>tians the glory they had merited, none but the Span-
</p>
<p>iards had reason to be dissatisfied. As they had de-
</p>
<p>clared for the Pope, and had offered to subjugate the
</p>
<p>Venetians, they were offended that he had entered
</p>
<p>into an arrangement without their participation ; but
</p>
<p>having discovered the secretof this arrangement, they
</p>
<p>were convinced that they had no cause of complaint
</p>
<p>against him, and that the slight they had experienced
</p>
<p>was to be attributed solely to the republic. It was,
</p>
<p>in fact, in compliance with the wishes of the Vene-
</p>
<p>tian senate, that they had been, in a measure, exclu-
</p>
<p>ded from the mediation. This body insisted that
</p>
<p>they ought not to be umpires after having displayed
</p>
<p>so much partiality.
</p>
<p>Whatever resentment they felt, they concealed it in
</p>
<p>their own bosoms during the reign of Henry IV.

<p>14 CONSPIRACY OP THE
</p>
<p>The obligations of this prince to the Venetians were
</p>
<p>well known ; and the care which he had taken of
</p>
<p>their interests, in their controversy with the Pope,
</p>
<p>was not less so. But his death permitted the Span-
</p>
<p> iui^ds to erpt* with? fr^dom, and they wailed only for
</p>
<p>a pVetext. ' *  
</p>
<p>: ;,.A'tcopp o:f;pii;at^s, called Uscoques, had formed
</p>
<p>an establishment upon the territory of Austria, situat-
</p>
<p>ed upon the Adriatic sea, near to the Venetians.
</p>
<p>They committed many outrages upon the citizens of
</p>
<p>the republic, but were protected by the archduke
</p>
<p>Ferdinand of Gratz, then sovereign of this territory
</p>
<p>and afterwards emperor. This prince wa^ very re-
</p>
<p>ligious, but his ministers shared in the booty of the pi-
</p>
<p>rates ; and, being devoted to Spain, they seized this
</p>
<p>occasion to avenge the wrongs which that nation had
</p>
<p>received from the Venetians.
</p>
<p>The emperor Matthias, listening to the well-found-
</p>
<p>ed complaints of the republic, endeavored, by an ar-
</p>
<p>rangement made in February, 1612, to put an end to
</p>
<p>these disorders ; but this arrangement was so little re-
</p>
<p>garded by the archduke, that an open war was the
</p>
<p>consequence, in which his success did not answer the
</p>
<p>hopes and expectations of the Spaniards. 
</p>
<p>The Venetians easily repaired the losses they had
</p>
<p>sustained in a few trifling engagements. Having noth-
</p>
<p>ing to fear from the Turks, they could carry on the
</p>
<p>war with less inconvenience than the archduke. This
</p>
<p>prince was urged by the emperor to make peace, be-

</p>
<p>Seignor, tipon Hungary, and because he found it nec-
</p>
<p>essary to expend large sums to gain his election as
</p>
<p>king of Bohemia, which look place soon after. The
</p>
<p>Spaniards would have cheerfully furnished him the
</p>
<p>means of continuing the contest ; but Charles Em-
</p>
<p>manuel, duke of Savoy, with whom they were then
</p>
<p>at war, kept them from dividing their forces ; and as
</p>
<p>the duke received large subsidies from the Venetians^
</p>
<p>the Spaniards were unable to detach him from them.
</p>
<p>The council of Spain felt indignant at finding the
</p>
<p>Venetians so strong on all sides. The mild and pa-
</p>
<p>cific temper of Philip III, and of the duke of Lerma,
</p>
<p>his favorite, restrained them from adopting such
</p>
<p>measures as their feelings dictated ; but one of their
</p>
<p>ministers in Italy, of a disposition more enterprising
</p>
<p>and fearless, undertook to relieve their embarrass-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>This prince was don Alphonso de la Queva, mar-
</p>
<p>quis of Bedmar, ambassador resident at Venice, one
</p>
<p>of the ablest and most dangerous characters that
</p>
<p>Spain has ever produced. The writings which he
</p>
<p>has left show that, by deeply studying the ancient and
</p>
<p>modern historians, he had acquired all that was requi*
</p>
<p>site to form an extraordinary man. Ho compared
</p>
<p>the events they related with those that happened in
</p>
<p>his own time. He noted with exactness wherein
</p>
<p>they were different, and wherein they were similar ;
</p>
<p>and considered what influence the particulars in which
</p>
<p>they differed must have upon those in which they

<p>agreed. He generally formed his opinion of the re*
</p>
<p>16 CONSPIRACY OF THE
</p>
<p>suit of a project, as soon as he had learned the origin
</p>
<p>and the plan of it. If he found, by the event, that his
</p>
<p>opinion was not correct, he ascended to the source
</p>
<p>of his error, and endeavored to discover by what
</p>
<p>he had been deceived. By studies of this nature he
</p>
<p>had learned what are the true methods, the certain
</p>
<p>means, and the important circumstances which, al-
</p>
<p>most always, ensure success in great designs. This
</p>
<p>constant practice of reading, of meditation, arid of ob-
</p>
<p>servation upon human affairs, had raised so high his
</p>
<p>reputation for sagacity, that his canjectures concern-
</p>
<p>ing the future were regarded, in the council of Spain,
</p>
<p>with almost as much respect as prophecies.
</p>
<p>To this intimate acquaintance with the nature of hu-
</p>
<p>man affairs, he added singular talents for directing

</p>
<p>from dissimulation as to seem a model of ingenuous-

<p>ness. His disposition was at once complaisant and

<p>engaging, and he concealed his thoughts and senti-

<p>could divine them. His manners were so affection-

<p>appearances of composure and tranquillity of mind in

<p>the midst of the most cruel distractions.

<p>the marquis of Bedmar had been selected, in 1507,
</p>
<p>for that of Venice, as the most difficult of foreign sta-
</p>
<p>tions, where neither women, monks nor favorites had
</p>
<p>any influence. The council of Spain were so well
</p>
<p>satisfied with his conduct, that, however desirous they
</p>
<p>might be of employing him elsewhere, they could not,
</p>
<p>even after he had resided there six years, resolve to
</p>
<p>recal him.
</p>
<p>His long residence at Venice had enabled him to
</p>
<p>study the principles of the government, to discover its
</p>
<p>most secret springs, to perceive its strength and its
</p>
<p>weakness, its advantages and its defects. Appre-
</p>
<p>hending that the archduke would be obliged to con-
</p>
<p>clude a peace, which could not be otherwise than
</p>
<p>disgraceful to Austria, as she was evidently in the
</p>
<p>wrong, he determined to devise some means to pre-
</p>
<p>vent it.
</p>
<p>He reflected that such was the condition of Venice
</p>
<p>that it was not impossible to become master of it, by
</p>
<p>means of his confidential agents in the city, and the
</p>
<p>forces which were under his control. The armies it
</p>
<p>had sent forth had exhausted it of arms, and still
</p>
<p>more of men capable of using them. As its naval
</p>
<p>force had never been in such excellent condition, the
</p>
<p>senate had never considered itself so formidable, and
</p>
<p>had never felt less fear. This fleet, however, strong
</p>
<p>as it was, dared not leave the coast of Istria, which
</p>
<p>was the seat of war. The army was also at a dis-
</p>
<p>tance, and there was nothing at Venice to resist an at-
</p>
<p>tack from the naval force of Spain. To render such

<p>an attack more sure of success, he proposed to gain
</p>
<p>possession of the principal posts, such as the square
</p>
<p>of St. Mark, and the arsenal ; and as it would be dif-
</p>
<p>ficult to do this, while the city was in a state of tran-
</p>
<p>quillity, he determined to set fire, at the same mo-
</p>
<p>ment, to those parts which were most combustible,
</p>
<p>and to those which the citizens would be the most
</p>
<p>desirous of preserving.
</p>
<p>He did not think it proper to state his design, in
</p>
<p>the beginning, to his master. He knew that princes
</p>
<p>are unwilling to commit themselves, in relation to
</p>
<p>such projects, until they are so far matured that noth-
</p>
<p>ing is necessary to their execution but an assurance
</p>
<p>that the enterprize will be acknowledged in case of
</p>
<p>success. He merely intimated to the duke of Uzeda,
</p>
<p>the principal secretary of state, that, perceiving the
</p>
<p>disgrace which the house of Austria had sustained,
</p>
<p>in the war of Friuh, from the insolent conduct of the
</p>
<p>Venetians, and that all the steps towards an accom-
</p>
<p>modation, which had been taken at Vienna and else-
</p>
<p>where, had tended to aggravate it, he conceived him-
</p>
<p>self placed in a situation where duty and policy
</p>
<p>obHged a faithful subject to resort to extraordinary
</p>
<p>measures to preserve his king and country from infa-
</p>

</p>
<p>devolved upon him, on account of the employment he
</p>
<p>held, in which, having constantly in view the origin of
</p>
<p>the evil, he could, better than any other person, de-
</p>
<p>termine what remedy should be applied ; and that he

</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 19
</p>
<p>worthy of the zeal which he felt for the honor of
</p>
<p>his master.
</p>
<p>The duke of Uzeda, who was well acquainted with
</p>
<p>the character of the ambassador, perceived, at once,
</p>
<p>that he had in contemplation some important and per-
</p>
<p>ilous undertaking ; but as prudent men, until circum-
</p>
<p>stances compel them, do not even avow their knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of such enterprizes, he did not communicate
</p>
<p>his suspicions to the first minister, and replied, in
</p>
<p>general terms, to the marquis of Bedmar, that he
</p>
<p>applauded his zeal and placed implicit reliance up-
</p>
<p>on his well-known discretion. The marquis, for he
</p>
<p>expected no other, was not surprised at receiving so
</p>
<p>cautious an answer ; and immediately began to make
</p>
<p>such arrangements as were best calculated to secure,
</p>
<p>by success, the approbation and acknowledgement of
</p>
<p>his superiors.
</p>
<p>Never was there a monarchy so absolute as the
</p>
<p>senate of Venice. A marked distinction was made,
</p>
<p>even in the most trivial matters, between the nobility
</p>
<p>and the common people. None but nobles could be
</p>
<p>appointed commanders or governors of the depen-
</p>
<p>dent territories. The most powerful lords, and the
</p>
<p>principal magistrates of these territories, were obhged
</p>
<p>to regard them as sovereigns rather than governors ;
</p>
<p>and if ever the repubhc gave the command of its sep-
</p>
<p>arate armies to foreigners, their powers were so lim-
</p>
<p>ited that they were compelled to be guided by the
</p>
<p>opinions of the general in chief, and had little to do

</p>
<p>As war always affords a plausible pretext for taxing
</p>
<p>the people, that with the Uscoques gave the nobility,
</p>
<p>by whom it was conducted, an excellent opportunity
</p>
<p>to enrich themselves. This war was carried on at
</p>
<p>an enormous expense. Besides the money expend-
</p>
<p>ed in Piedmont, it became necessary, in the end, to
</p>
<p>maintain a third army, in Lombardy, to oppose the
</p>
<p>governor of Milan, who threatened to make a diver-
</p>
<p>sion in favor of the archduke. The justice of the
</p>
<p>cause of the republic emboldened the commanders
</p>
<p>to resort to new modes of raising money, but did not
</p>
<p>render the people more patient in suffering. The
</p>
<p>exactions became so excessive, that the marquis of
</p>
<p>Bedmar had reason to believe that the revolution,
</p>
<p>which he wished to effect, would be as agreeable to
</p>
<p>the people as it would be destructive to the nobility.
</p>
<p>There were many persons, even among the nobili-
</p>
<p>ty, who felt no affection for the government. These
</p>
<p>were the partizans of the court of Rome. Some of
</p>
<p>them, and indeed the greater number, ambitious and
</p>
<p>revengeful, were dissatisfied and incensed because
</p>
<p>the affairs of the republic, during the controversy
</p>
<p>with that court, had been administered contrary to
</p>
<p>their advice. They were ready to do and to suffer
</p>
<p>any thing to deprive of power those who possessed it ;
</p>
<p>and they witnessed with pleasure the misfortunes of
</p>
<p>the state, considering them the consequences of
</p>
<p>measures which they had condemned. Others, sim-
</p>
<p>ple and ignorant, chose to be more catholic than the

<p>pope himself. As he had, in the peace which had
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 21
</p>
<p>been concluded, relinquished a part of his pretensions,
</p>
<p>they supposed that he had been induced to do so
</p>
<p>from policy ; and that, as he might have acted with a
</p>
<p>mental reservation, there was reason to fear that the
</p>
<p>sentence of excommunication yet remained in force
</p>
<p>in the intention of his holiness. Of this number were
</p>
<p>several senators, as destitute of fortune as of intellect.
</p>
<p>These, in the sequel, w^ere very serviceable to the
</p>
<p>marquis, who convinced them, by the benefits he con-
</p>
<p>ferred, that, after this affair, no one could be a Vene-
</p>
<p>tian with a safe conscience.
</p>
<p>Although the nobles were strictly forbidden to havd
</p>
<p>any intercourse with foreigners, the marquis had
</p>
<p>found nieans to establish a confidential correspond-
</p>
<p>ence with the most restless and discontented. If
</p>
<p>ihey had a near relative in any of the convents, any
</p>
<p>mistress, or any ecclesiastic, who w^as intimate with
</p>
<p>their families, he spared no pains nor expense to be-
</p>
<p>come acquainted with them ; he made them presents,
</p>
<p>which, though they generally consisted merely of the
</p>
<p>curiosities of foreign countries, were nevertheless
</p>
<p>highly valuable. These presents, spontaneously con*
</p>
<p>ferred, led those who received them to anticipate
</p>
<p>even greater ; they therefore eagerly answered all
</p>
<p>his inquiries ; and took pains to acquire information
</p>
<p>to communicate to him. The rewards he bestowed
</p>
<p>surpassed their expectation, and they labored inces-
</p>
<p>santly to engage their superiors in the same secret in-
</p>
<p>tercourse, until success crowned their exertions.

<p>ence ; they probably could not see, without envy,
</p>
<p>their dependants growing richer than themselves by
</p>
<p>means of presents conferred merely because they
</p>
<p>were their dependants. However this may be, none
</p>
<p>of the deliberations of the senate were, afterwards,
</p>
<p>unknown to the ambassador of Spain ; he was inform-
</p>
<p>ed of all its decisions ; and such as related to the
</p>
<p>war were communicated to the generals of the arch-
</p>
<p>duke before those of the republic had received an
</p>
<p>order to execute them.
</p>
<p>Though possessed of these means of gaining intelli-
</p>
<p>gence, a considerable number of troops was still nec-
</p>
<p>essary to enable him to execute his enterprise ; but
</p>
<p>as there was a powerful Spanish army in Lombardy,
</p>
<p>he had no apprehension that men would be wanting,
</p>
<p>provided the governor of Milan would enter into his
</p>
<p>designs. The marquis of Iniosa, who then held that
</p>
<p>office, had too intimate a correspondence with the
</p>
<p>duke of Savoy to be trusted with safety. He had
</p>
<p>just concluded with that duke the treaty of Asti, of
</p>
<p>which France and the Venetians were mediators.
</p>
<p>The ambassador, who knew that this negotiation
</p>
<p>would not be approved, in Spain, wrote horne, advis-

<p>ed don Pedro of Toledo, marquis of Villa-franca,
</p>
<p>his intimate friend, to solicit the government of Mi-
</p>
<p>lan. Don Pedro, about the end of the year 16J5,

<p>received orders to set out immediately to take the

<p>place of Iniosa ; and the instant after his arrival at

</p>
<p>The ambassador communicated his project to this
</p>
<p>marquis in the manner which he judged best calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to induce him to approve it ; and he charged
</p>
<p>him particularly to ascertain whether the new gover-
</p>
<p>nor could spare him fifteen hundred of his best troops,
</p>
<p>whenever they might be wanted. Don Pedro, charm-
</p>
<p>ed with the project, resolved to afford all the assist-
</p>
<p>ance he could, without exposing himself to certain ru-
</p>
<p>in should it fail. He dispatched the marquis of Lara,
</p>
<p>a second time, to Venice, to communicate this resolu-
</p>
<p>tion to the ambassador ; but, at the same time, he be-
</p>
<p>sought him to consider that he could not send that
</p>
<p>number of troops without selecting all that were good,
</p>
<p>and that, should they be lost by the failure of the en-
</p>
<p>terprise, he would incur the severest censure, for hav-
</p>
<p>ing exposed to such imminent danger the bravest
</p>
<p>soldiers of his army. He would, however, spare all
</p>
<p>that he could, and would select them so carefully
</p>
<p>that he would be answerable for their fidelit}^
</p>
<p>Nothing was more important to the designs of the
</p>
<p>ambassador than to prevent the restoration of harmo-
</p>
<p>ny between the contending powers. With this view,
</p>
<p>he persuaded the marquis of Lara to make the most
</p>
<p>unreasonable propositions in behalf of the governor
</p>
<p>of Milan. The senate, as was foreseen, rejected
</p>
<p>them with indignation, and declined negotiating with
</p>
<p>him. Don Pedro, on his part, omitted nothing calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to embroil affairs still more. The duke of

</p>
<p>of Asti. Means were used to render him obstinate
</p>
<p>on this point, and to induce hina to continue, as he
</p>
<p>had begun, to inflict punishment upon them. Propo-
</p>
<p>sitions were made, by the agents of Spain, to the
</p>
<p>duke of Savoy, for the execution of this treaty, which
</p>
<p>they well knew he would not accept ; and they de-
</p>
<p>layed disbanding their troops, which he had done
</p>
<p>and they ought to have done, under the pretence
</p>
<p>that Spain could no longer, with honor, refuse to
</p>
<p>take part in the war of Friuli : the Venetian army
</p>
<p>had passed the Lizonzo, and besieged Gradisca, the
</p>
<p>capital of the territories of the arch-duke.
</p>
<p>The council of Spain, which had hitherto appear-
</p>
<p>ed neutral, perceiving this prince in danger, threaten-
</p>
<p>ed to declare in his favor. At this time, the misun-
</p>
<p>derstanding which, since the contest between the son
</p>
<p>and brother of Charles the fifth, for the succession to
</p>
<p>the empire, had divided the Spanish and German
</p>
<p>branches of the house of Austria, had been adjusted.
</p>
<p>The interest which the Spaniards took in this war
</p>
<p>was the first mark of their reconciliation. Don Pedro
</p>
<p>ordered colonel Gambalotta to advance, with his
</p>
<p>troops, towards Crema ; and he caused twenty-four
</p>
<p>pieces of battering artillery to be mounted at Pavia ;
</p>
<p>which were soon, as he declared, to be sent with a
</p>
<p>body of eight thousand troops under the command of

<p>don Sancho de Luna. In another quarter, the vice-
</p>

<p>ed the arrival, by sea, of all assistance to the repub-

</p>
<p>ter the gulf, for the avowed purpose of keeping in
</p>
<p>check the Venetian fleet.
</p>
<p>The ministers of Venice having remonstrated to
</p>
<p>all the European Courts against this violent proceed-
</p>
<p>ing, the marquis of Bedmar undertook to justify it.
</p>
<p>He considered it also important to his design, to strike
</p>
<p>at the root of the veneration, which had, for so many
</p>
<p>centuries, been felt throughout Europe for this repub-
</p>
<p>lic, as the oldest and freest of all nations. Its free-
</p>
<p>dom and independence had lately been vindicated
</p>
<p>and more vaunted than ever, in several publications,
</p>
<p>written during the controversy with the pope, which
</p>
<p>were yet considered unanswerable, although many
</p>
<p>replies had been written by able men of the opposite
</p>
<p>party.
</p>
<p>The ambassador, undertaking to examine these
</p>
<p>publications himself, refuted, in a few chapters, the
</p>
<p>numerous volumes of the Venetian authors, without
</p>
<p>deigning to name one of them. And as, in matters
</p>
<p>of this nature, there is no question which an ingenious
</p>
<p>disputant may not render doubtful, he, under the pre-
</p>
<p>text of establishing the authority of the emperors
</p>
<p>over Venice, demonstrated that the independence of
</p>
<p>this republic was but a cliimera, and that its domin-
</p>
<p>ion over the sea v/as not better founded. As it was
</p>
<p>not consistent with his purpose to be known as the au-
</p>
<p>thor of this work, he caused it to be published so pri-
</p>
<p>vately that it was not known, during his life, that he

<p>suspected, appears strange ; but the truth probably
</p>
<p>is, that he had not yet become fully known to the
</p>
<p>Venetians. His lively and impetuous deportment,
</p>
<p>which he sought not to restrain but choose to display
</p>
<p>on all occasions, prevented them from imagining that
</p>
<p>a man of such character could be the author of a po-
</p>
<p>litical satire of so much subtlety and refinement.
</p>
<p>Candor and sincerity seemed to pervade it through-
</p>
<p>out ; and the censures of the encroachments of the
</p>
<p>Venetians, which were occasionally introduced, were
</p>
<p>expressed with such apparent moderation, as sufficed
</p>
<p>to render them plausible. This work, the title of
</p>
<p>which was Squitiinio delta Liberia J^eneta, was the
</p>
<p>universal topic of conversation.
</p>
<p>As the author was unknown, suspicion naturally
</p>
<p>fell upon the court of Rome, whence the preceding
</p>
<p>publications, on that side of the question, had emanated.
</p>
<p>The wise men of the Senate imagined that the world
</p>
<p>felt the force of it as they did ; it dismayed them
</p>
<p>like the loss of a battle ; and father Paul was direct-
</p>
<p>ed to examine it. This man, who had treated with
</p>
<p>ridicule the other writers of that party, declared that
</p>
<p>no reply ought to be made to the last, for none could
</p>
<p>be made without disclosing facts which prudence re-
</p>
<p>quired should remain buried in the obscurity of anti-
</p>
<p>quity ; that, nevertheless, if in the opinion of the
</p>
<p>Senate, it best comported with the dignity of the re-
</p>
<p>public to resent this outrage, he would undertake to

</p>
<p>This intimation was listened to in the first warmth of
</p>
<p>resentment, and father Paul had the gratification of
</p>
<p>publishing his History of the Council of Trent, a
</p>
<p>work dear to his heart, which otherwise would not

<p>have appeared during his life time.

<p>The campaign of the year 1616, having, in the
</p>
<p>meantime, closed, without any decisive advantage to
</p>
<p>either side, the duke of Savoy and the Venetians,
</p>
<p>who were unwilling to hazard, in a second, the glory
</p>
<p>they had acquired, empowered Gritti^ the Venetian
</p>
<p>ambassador at Madrid, to renew the negotiation.
</p>
<p>The Spaniards, irritated by the resistance they had
</p>
<p>met with, made such unreasonable propositions that
</p>
<p>nothing was accomplished. Gradiscawas yet block-
</p>
<p>aded ; the war continued through the winter ; and
</p>
<p>the two armies took the field in the spring, displaying

<p>a degree of animation and ardor that promised more

<p>great repubhcs uniting their forces in opposition to

</p>
<p>The marquis of Bedmar would have been not a
</p>
<p>little embarrassed had the pope obliged the Venetians
</p>
<p>to dismiss these heretics. As soldiers, for the most
</p>
<p>part, have only their personal interest in view, when
</p>
<p>they enter into the service of a foreign prince, he
</p>
<p>hoped to induce the chiefs of these mercenaries to
</p>
<p>embark in his designs, by the offer of higher wages
</p>
<p>and the allurement of the pillage of Venice. To ne-
</p>
<p>gotiate w^ith them, he selected an aged French gentle-
</p>
<p>man, named Nicholas de Renault, a man of intelli-
</p>
<p>gence and discretion, who had taken refuge in Ven-
</p>
<p>ice, for some reason which no one had been able to
</p>
<p>discover. The marquis of Bedmar had often seen
</p>
<p>him at the palace of the French ambassador, where
</p>
<p>he resided. In several conversations, which they
</p>
<p>accidentally had with each other, Renault discovered
</p>
<p>that the world had not estimated too highly the intel-
</p>
<p>ligence and ability of the marquis ; and the latter,
</p>
<p>sensible of the advantage of having such a friend in
</p>
<p>the suite of the ambassador of France, formed an inti-
</p>
<p>mate connection with him.
</p>
<p>This man, though extremely poor, esteemed virtue
</p>
<p>higher than riches ; but he loved glory more than
</p>
<p>virtue ; and, could he find no innocent means of ac-
</p>
<p>quiring it, there were none, however criminal, which
</p>
<p>he was not willing to resort to. In perusing the an-

<p>cient writers, he had imbibed that rare indifference to

<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 29
</p>
<p>life and to death which, more than any thing else,
</p>
<p>incites to extraordinary enterprises ; and he never
</p>
<p>ceased to regret those illustrious ages, in which the
</p>
<p>talents of individuals controlled the destiny of nations,
</p>
<p>and when those, who possessed them, were never
</p>
<p>without the means nor opportunities to display them.
</p>
<p>The marquis of Bedmar, who had deeply studied
</p>
<p>his character, and had need of a man, to direct his
</p>
<p>enterprise, in whom he could entirely confide, said to
</p>
<p>him, when he disclosed it, that he had fixed his
</p>
<p>thoughts upon him, the moment the project first en-
</p>
<p>tered his mind. This remark bound Renault to him
</p>
<p>more firmly than the warmest praises could have
</p>
<p>done. His advanced age did not deter him from
</p>
<p>joining in the plot ; the less of life that remained to
</p>
<p>him, the less he had to risk ; and he thought he could
</p>
<p>not better employ the sad remnant of his years than
</p>
<p>in hazarding them to render his name immortal. The
</p>
<p>marquis gave him the control of sufficient funds to ne-
</p>
<p>gotiate with the Dutch commanders. He charged
</p>
<p>him not to disclose the enterprise, at present, but
</p>
<p>merely to intimate, that affairs were in such disorder
</p>
<p>that the Spanish ambassador at Venice foresaw that a
</p>
<p>time might arrive when his person would be in dan-
</p>
<p>ger from the fury of the populace ; and that, for his
</p>
<p>own protection, he wished to secure the services of a
</p>
<p>considerable number of faithful and resolute friends.
</p>
<p>This pretext was a gross one ; but the slightest dis-
</p>
<p>guise is of great use, in affairs of this kind. It im-
</p>

</p>
<p>ed, if the real secret is not discovered. In this way
</p>
<p>he hoped that he might seduce the choicest portion of
</p>
<p>the Venetian army, and that it would then be left so
</p>
<p>weak that Don Pedro could easily defeat itj on its
</p>
<p>way to Venice, should the senate recal it to oppose
</p>
<p>the conspirators.
</p>
<p>The navy was to be feared more than the army.
</p>
<p>It had been accustomed to conquer, and could be
</p>
<p>much more r eadily recalled. The greater number
</p>
<p>of the sailors were natives of the republic ; and it
</p>
<p>could not be doubted that, on the discovery of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, the fleet would hasten home. To expect
</p>
<p>that the Spanish fleet would defeat it, would be an
</p>
<p>unsafe reliance ; and it would not be prudent to com-
</p>
<p>mit, to the fortune of a battle, the success of an en-
</p>
<p>terprise in other respects so hazardous. It was nec-
</p>
<p>essary to contrive means to render this fleet incapa-
</p>
<p>ble of affording assistance.
</p>
<p>The ambassador, not having had so much experi-
</p>
<p>ence in naval affairs as the viceroy of Naples, who
</p>
<p>commanded the naval force of Spain, thought it his
</p>
<p>duty to consult him on this subject. This viceroy,
</p>
<p>who was to be a principal actor in the tragedy which
</p>
<p>the ambassador was preparing, was that duke of Os-
</p>
<p>suna, who was so celebrated for his gallantries, and
</p>
<p>was as enterprising as Don Pedro, or the Marquis of
</p>
<p>Bedmar. This rasemblance of disposition had pro-
</p>
<p>duced an intimate friendship between the three.
</p>

</p>
<p>sometimes committed eccentricities which might be
</p>
<p>called extravagances ; but the deference which both
</p>
<p>felt for the marquis of Bedmar supplied the place of
</p>
<p>that discretion which they wanted.
</p>
<p>The profits which piracy yields, to those who pur-
</p>
<p>sue it under the protection of a powerful nation, had
</p>
<p>attracted to the court of Naples all the celebrated
</p>
<p>corsairs of the Mediterranean. The viceroy, who
</p>
<p>was fond of extraordinary projects, and rather prodi-
</p>
<p>gal than avaricious, protected them, not so much for
</p>
<p>the share which he received of their booty, as for the
</p>
<p>purpose of collecting around him a numerous body of
</p>
<p>such men as would be ready to perform whatever he
</p>
<p>should desire. He not only welcomed to his domin-
</p>
<p>ions those who came voluntarily } but, whenever he
</p>
<p>heard of one who had more than ordinary reputation
</p>
<p>in his profession, he sought him out, and was so liber-
</p>
<p>al of his favors that he attached him firmly to his
</p>
<p>person. He had, in this manner, secured the friend-
</p>
<p>ship of captain James Pierre, a Norman by birth,
</p>
<p>and so eminent in his profession, that others were
</p>
<p>proud of having learned it under his instruction.
</p>
<p>The disposition of this captain did not partake of
</p>
<p>the barbarity which is characteristic of his occupation.
</p>
<p>Having acquired the means of living genteely, he re-
</p>
<p>solved to quit it, though yet in the flower of his age ;
</p>
<p>and he chose, for his retreat, the territories of the
</p>
<p>duke of Savoy. This prince, enamoured of every
</p>
<p>species of extraordinary talent, and so much the more

<p>capable of appreciating it in others, as nature had

<p>S2 CONSPIRACY OP THU
</p>
<p>been liberal to bimself, permitted the corsair, who
</p>
<p>passed for one of the bravest of men, to establish him-
</p>
<p>self at Nice. Every ojSicer, soldier, and sailor, who
</p>
<p>frequented this part of the country, rendered him the
</p>
<p>homage due to a chieftain. To them his counsels
</p>
<p>were oracles ; he was the sovereign arbiter of their
</p>
<p>disputes ; and they never ceased to admire a man
</p>
<p>who had quitted a pursuit, in which he was so well
</p>
<p>quahfied to excel, and which is the most difficult of
</p>
<p>all to abandon.
</p>
<p>Among his associates was one named Vincent Rob-
</p>
<p>ert, of Marseilles, who, having landed at Sicily, where
</p>
<p>the duke of Ossuna was then viceroy, was so cor-
</p>
<p>dially welcomed that he enlisted in his service. The
</p>
<p>duke, understanding that he was a friend of the cap-
</p>
<p>tain, complained to him, in good humour, that his
</p>
<p>friend, in selecting a retreat, had preferred the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment of the duke of Savoy to his own, expressing,
</p>
<p>at the same tune, a high respect for the courage of
</p>
<p>the captain, and for his experience in naval affairs,
</p>
<p>and declaring that he would omit nothing which could
</p>
<p>have the effect to attract to his court a man of such
</p>
<p>extraordinary merit. Robert gladly undertook to
</p>
<p>persuade him to repair thither ; and his efforts were
</p>
<p>so well assisted by the advances of the viceroy, that
</p>
<p>the captain at length repaired to Sicily, with his wife
</p>
<p>and children.
</p>
<p>As he had never entirely banished the sea from
</p>
<p>his thoughts, the passion, which he had once felt for

<p>it, had not been extinguished. The galleons, which
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE.- 33
</p>
<p>the viceroy had lately built, were so fine, and several
</p>
<p>Turkish vessels were then at sea with such feeble
</p>
<p>convoy, that he could not resist the temptation they
</p>
<p>presented. And he had no occasion to regret that
</p>
<p>he yielded to it. He gained an immense booty -, and
</p>
<p>the duke of Ossuna, who, from that time, lived with
</p>
<p>him as with a brother, surrendered most of it to him,
</p>
<p>on condition that he would follow him to Naples, of
</p>
<p>which the king had just appointed him viceroy, and
</p>
<p>that he would make a voyage to Provence, to engage
</p>
<p>in his service the best of the sea-faring men with
</p>
<p>whom he was acquainted, on that coast. He brought
</p>
<p>back with him a sufficient number to man fivQ large
</p>
<p>vessels, which belonged to the viceroy in person, and
</p>
<p>of which he had the sole direction. With this little
</p>
<p>fleet, he ravaged, with impunity, all the islands and
</p>
<p>shores of the Levant, and, at the close of his first
</p>
<p>cruise, he fought a great battle, in which he captured
</p>
<p>or sunk the whole of a large squadron of Turkish
</p>
<p>gallies.
</p>
<p>It was at this period that the marquis of Bedmar,
</p>
<p>persuaded that the duke of Ossuna would cheerfully
</p>
<p>assist him, communicated to him his design. This
</p>
<p>duke, anxious to obtain the control of these seas, de-
</p>
<p>sired nothing more ardently than to ruin those who
</p>
<p>alone could dispute it with him, and who could not be
</p>
<p>beaten so easily as the Turks. He consulted the
</p>
<p>captain on the subject, and stated such difficulties as
</p>
<p>occurred to him. The captain did not think them

<p>spent in private conference, he secretly quitted Na-

<p>ples, in a manner indicative of extreme precipitation
</p>
<p>and terror. The viceroy despatched messengers in
</p>
<p>every direction, except the one in vt^hich he fled, with
</p>
<p>orders to seize him dead or alive. His wife and
</p>
<p>children were imprisoned, and were apparently treat-
</p>
<p>ed with extreme cruelty. All his property was con-
</p>
<p>fiscated ; and though the duke had long been known
</p>
<p>to be excessively passionate, yet the transports of rage
</p>
<p>which he exhibited on this occasion surprised all Na-
</p>
<p>ples. As the captain appeared not less excited, it
</p>
<p>was easily believed that a misunderstanding had taken
</p>
<p>place, and that he had been detected in some designs
</p>
<p>injurious to Spain, or to the interests of the duke.
</p>
<p>He returned to his former asylum.
</p>
<p>The duke of Savoy was at open war with Spain,
</p>
<p>and had the reputation of a most generous prince.
</p>
<p>Though he had manifested some displeasure, when
</p>
<p>the captain quitted his dominions to settle in Sicily,
</p>
<p>yet the impostor did not hesitate to throw himself at

<p>his feet. He communicated to him several pretend-

<p>ed designs of the viceroy against Venice, which,
</p>
<p>though atrocious, had nothing in common with the
</p>
<p>true one ; and observed tliat, as he could not engage

<p>in them with honor, he had resolved to take measures
</p>
<p>to escape from Naples, with his family and property ;
</p>
<p>but having learned that the viceroy had discovered

</p>
<p>The duke .of Savoy, touched with pity at this
</p>
<p>mournful recital, received him with open arms, assur-
</p>
<p>ing him that, his own interests and those of the Vene-
</p>
<p>tians being the same, he would reward the service he
</p>
<p>had rendered the common cause, if the Venetians
</p>
<p>did not. He added, that it was important that the
</p>
<p>senate should be informed, by himself, of the de-
</p>
<p>signs of the duke of Ossuna ; and, after having ex-
</p>
<p>horted him to bear his misfortunes with fortitude,
</p>
<p>furnished him w^ith every thing necessary, and made
</p>
<p>him a magnificent present, he sent him to Venice
</p>
<p>with letters of credit and of recommendation.
</p>
<p>The Venetians were not less compassionate than
</p>
<p>the duke of Savoy. The flight, the poverty, the dis-
</p>
<p>tress, the reputation of the captain, the hope that he
</p>
<p>would attract to their service the many brave men
</p>
<p>whom he had engaged in that of the duke of Ossuna,
</p>
<p>but particularly, the account which he gave of the
</p>
<p>designs of the duke, to which he contrived to give the
</p>
<p>appearance of truth : all spoke so powerfully in his
</p>
<p>favor, that they immediately gave him the command
</p>
<p>of a vessel. This was done contrary to the remon-
</p>
<p>strances of Contarini, ambassador at Rome, who, in
</p>
<p>his letters to the Senate, insisted that" this man, hav-
</p>
<p>ing been in the service of the viceroy, should be re-
</p>
<p>garded with suspicion. But, the Venetians, made
</p>
<p>credulous by their fears, disregarded this prudent
</p>
<p>advice. A short time afterwards, the fleet being at

<p>obtained permission to cruise against the Uscoques,
</p>
<p>and took such considerable prizes that, on his return,
</p>
<p>eleven vessels were added to the one he already com-
</p>
<p>manded.
</p>
<p>He gave an account of his good fortune to the
</p>
<p>duke of Ossuna, and observed, in the conclusion of
</p>
<p>his despatch, " If these simpletons continue to be as
</p>
<p>credulous as they have hitherto been, I dare assure
</p>
<p>your excellency that I shall not spend my time in
</p>
<p>vain in this country." At the same time, he wrote to
</p>
<p>his former companions, at Naples, inviting, them to
</p>
<p>enter into the service of the republic. He did not
</p>
<p>find it difficult to persuade them. After his flight,
</p>
<p>the viceroy, pretending to suspect their fidelity, was,
</p>
<p>in his conduct towards them, as harsh as he had
</p>
<p>before been civil.
</p>
<p>The duke of Ossuna complained loudly of the
</p>
<p>protection which the captain received from the repub-
</p>
<p>lic. To retaliate, he collected around him the Us-
</p>
<p>coques, whom the Venetians had driven from their
</p>
<p>retreats. Under his protection, they again made
</p>
<p>cruises. They captured a large vessel, on the way
</p>
<p>from Corfu to Venice, and publicly sold their booty
</p>
<p>within his dominions. He violated the freedom of
</p>
<p>ports ; made reprisals of great value for trifling inju-
</p>
<p>ries ; refused, when ordered by Spain, to restore
</p>
<p>what he had seized ; and published a manifesto justi-
</p>
<p>fying his disobedience. He sent a powerful fleet in-
</p>
<p>to the Adriatic, and caused the prizes it captured to

</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 37
</p>
<p>their commerce, injuring, at the same time, the Nea-
</p>
<p>politans themselves, who were interested in it ; and
</p>
<p>the farmers of the revenue daring to murmur, he
</p>
<p>threatened to hang them.
</p>
<p>As war had not been declared between Spain and
</p>
<p>the repubhc, the Venetians were astonished at this
</p>
<p>bold and irregular conduct. It was generally imput-
</p>
<p>ed to the madness of the hot-brained duke of Ossu-
</p>
<p>na ; but the more sagacious, knowing that such rash
</p>
<p>and lawless individuals are often designedly made use
</p>
<p>of, conjectured that the Spaniards were willing he
</p>
<p>should perform what they would be unwilling to avow
</p>
<p>or approve. In his faraihar discourse, he frequently
</p>
<p>spoke of surprising the ports of Istria belonging to the
</p>
<p>republic ; of ravaging her islands ; and even of mak-
</p>
<p>ing, if he possibly could, an attack upon Venice. He
</p>
<p>often, with his courtiers, studied the plan of the city ;
</p>
<p>he caused exact maps to be made of its environs,
</p>
<p>and boats, brigantines, and other small vessels, adapt-
</p>
<p>ed to canals, to be constructed ; he caused experi-
</p>
<p>ments to be made to ascertain what burden water of a
</p>
<p>given depth would sustain in boats of different sizes ;
</p>
<p>and he invented new machines to diminish the bur-
</p>
<p>den, and to facilitate the motion of boats. The Ve-
</p>
<p>netian minister at Naples sent home an exact account
</p>
<p>of all this, to the infinite despair of the marquis of
</p>
<p>Bedmar, who began to repent that he had united his
</p>
<p>destiny with that of a man so impetuous and heedless.
</p>
<p>But the result belied his fears.

<p>much parade and publicity, that the Venetians could
</p>
<p>only laugh at his folly. Even the most intelligent
</p>
<p>could not believe that any thing serious u^as intended
</p>
<p>where every step was so ostentatiously taken. The
</p>
<p>duke continued to make his preparations at his leisure,
</p>
<p>and no one regarded them ; and his indiscretion, in-
</p>
<p>stead of ruining the enterprise, aided it more than
</p>
<p>even the circumspection of the marquis of Bedmar.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless the marquis determined to hasten the
</p>
<p>execution of it, either because he did not choose to
</p>
<p>give the* Venetians leisure to reflect, or because his
</p>
<p>person was at all times exposed to danger. The Ve-
</p>
<p>netian fleet, having once offered battle to that of
</p>
<p>Spain, which declined engaging, and having ravaged
</p>
<p>the coasts of Pouilly, the populace of Venice became
</p>
<p>so insolent in their exultation, that the ambassador
</p>
<p>and his whole household would have been massacred,
</p>
<p>had not the magistrates sent him a guard.
</p>
<p>The same day, he received news from the camp
</p>
<p>before Gradisca, which consoled him for what had
</p>
<p>happened. Renault informed him, that he found the
</p>

<p>as of Venice. This, when in their power, would be
</p>
<p>a check upon the other towns in its neighbourhood ;
</p>
<p>would serve as a depot of arms to the Spanish troops
</p>
<p>that might be sent to attack those towns, and as a
</p>
<p>barrier to the Venetian army, should the republic be
</p>
<p>disposed to despatch it to protect them.
</p>
<p>Renault passed through the principal towns and
</p>
<p>stopped some time at Crema, where he formed a par-
</p>
<p>ty, with the aid of a French lieutenant, named John
</p>
<p>Berard, an Italian captain, and a lieutenant belonging
</p>
<p>to Provence, whom don Pedro had already engaged
</p>
<p>to favor his designs. These three men offered to con-
</p>
<p>ceal, in the city, five hundred Spaniards, without ex-
</p>
<p>citing the suspicion of the Venetian commander,
</p>
<p>and to take possession of it eight days afterwards.
</p>
<p>From the examination which Renault made upon the
</p>
<p>spot, he thought they might easily, with that number
</p>
<p>of men, perform what they promised. Nothing
</p>
<p>more was necessary than, to cut the throats of a body
</p>
<p>of miserable recruits, who, all the regular troops be-
</p>
<p>ing at Friuli or in the armies, had been detached
</p>
<p>from the militia of the country.
</p>
<p>The duke of Ossuna had also stated to the mar-
</p>
<p>quis of Bedmar that it would be necessary to possess
</p>
<p>some place, belonging to the Venetians, upon the
</p>
<p>gulf, from which assistance and support could be giv-
</p>
<p>en to the Uscoques and the archduke, and to which
</p>
<p>the Spanish fleet might retreat, should it, by any acci-
</p>
<p>dent, be obliged to seek an asylum, when cruising in

<p>harbor capable of sheltering a large fleet. An Italian,
</p>
<p>named Maz^za, who, for forty years, had been ser-
</p>
<p>geant major there, exercised almost as much authori-
</p>
<p>ty as the governor himself. Tempted by a large sum

<p>of money, and the promise of the chief command,
</p>
<p>this man engaged, whenever he should receive or-
</p>
<p>ders from the duke of Ossuna, to massacre the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor, and make himself master of the place, and
</p>
<p>hold it for the Spaniards. It was almost as easy for
</p>
<p>him to perform this promise, as to make it : the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor, who was the purveyor, Lorenzo Tiepolo, lived
</p>
<p>with him on the most familiar terms, and as, in time
</p>
<p>of war, his office of purveyor occupied much of his
</p>
<p>attention, he relinquished to the sergeant major, who
</p>
<p>was the oldest and most respectable officer in the
</p>
<p>garrison, the entire direction of the interior of the

<p>commits a capital fault in omitting to take advantage

<p>of the happy conjuncture.
</p>
<p>It was of great importance to the honor of Spain,
</p>
<p>that, should the conspiracy fail, the part which her
</p>
<p>ambassador had acted should never be known. He
</p>
<p>tlierefore resolved not to disclose himself to any of
</p>
<p>the conspirators, except Renault and the captain.
</p>
<p>These two men were unknown to each other ; they
</p>
<p>visited him only when invited ; and, to prevent the
</p>
<p>possibility of their meeting, he had always taken care
</p>
<p>to invite them on different days. Should a discovery
</p>
<p>take place, it would be important to him that they had
</p>
<p>had no intercourse with each other. As that event
</p>
<p>was possible, it was highly desirable to him, that they
</p>
<p>should continue to perform, unknown to each oth-
</p>
<p>er, their respective parts, as they had hitherto done ;
</p>
<p>but, after mature reflection, he concluded that this
</p>
<p>was impossible ; and, despairing of success in his de-
</p>
<p>sign, if he did not establish a cordial understanding
</p>
<p>between them, he determined to do it, whatever the
</p>
<p>peril might be.
</p>
<p>Both of these men had personal courage and dis-
</p>
<p>cretion, but Renault valued himself principally upon
</p>
<p>his capacity of combining and disposing his arrange-
</p>
<p>ments in such manner, that the execution of an enter-
</p>
<p>prise would be easy, and its success infallible. The
</p>
<p>captain, on the contrary, who was much younger,
</p>
<p>valued himself principally upon his power and skill

<p>in executing designs, and upon being a man of un-

</p>
<p>the various negotiations which Renault had success-
</p>
<p>fullvr concluded ; his fertility in devising expedients
</p>
<p>adapted to every conjuncture ; his eloquence and ad-
</p>
<p>dress in gaining partizans, his ability to write well, a
</p>
<p>talent of much importance, as it was necessary to be
</p>
<p>constantly informed of the condition of the fleets, of
</p>
<p>the provinces, and of the armies. He added that he
</p>
<p>imagined a man of this description would afford great
</p>
<p>relief and assistance to the captain ; that he was an
</p>
<p>old man of much experience, who was destitute nei-
</p>
<p>ther of courage nor resolution ; but his age, and his
</p>
<p>studious, contemplative habits, rendered him incapa-
</p>
<p>ble of participating with the captain, in the glory of
</p>
<p>executing the enterprise. To Renault he merely ob-
</p>
<p>served that the captain was the agent of the duke of
</p>
<p>Ossuna ; and as the duke was a principal in their de-
</p>
<p>sign, he could not, with propriety, conceal any thing
</p>
<p>from his confidant. He besought him to tolerate the
</p>
<p>manners of the corsair, so far as should be necessary
</p>
<p>in the pursuit of their object, and, by treating him
</p>
<p>with deference, to conciliate a man who was, to the
</p>
<p>last degree, proud and presumptuous.
</p>
<p>The marquis of Bedmar having taken such pains to
</p>
<p>prepare these men to live harmoniously together, his
</p>
<p>astonishment was extreme when, at their first meeting
</p>
<p>at his house, he saw them embrace affectionately, the
</p>
<p>instant they cast their eyes upon each other. it is
</p>
<p>not possible that any mind should be so calm and
</p>
<p>firm as to judge rationally of circumstances that pro-

</p>
<p>duce surprise and astonishment. The first thought
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 4S
</p>
<p>of the ambassador was, that he was betrayed. As he
</p>
<p>had supposed that these men had no knowledge of
</p>
<p>each other, he could not comprehend why they shoukl
</p>
<p>have concealed from him the fact that they were well
</p>
<p>acquainted. This mystery was soon explained. He
</p>
<p>was told that they had often met at the house of a
</p>
<p>famous Greek, who, though a courtesan, was a wo-
</p>
<p>man of extraordinary merit. Of this no other proof
</p>
<p>was necessary than the fact, that she had, as each
</p>
<p>had requested, faithfully forborne to mention tlieir
</p>
<p>names. This fidelity appeared to them the more
</p>
<p>remarkable, as she was not ignorant that each had
</p>
<p>formed a very high opinion of the other.
</p>
<p>The ambassador, recovering from his surprise, was
</p>
<p>rejoiced to find that the cordial friendship between
</p>
<p>them, which he so ardently desired, was already es-
</p>
<p>tablished. In the course of this interview, each ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged that he had resolved to engage the other
</p>
<p>in the enterprise. As they were much occupied
</p>
<p>with their project, they had sometimes, in the conver-
</p>
<p>sations they had held together, discoursed on topics
</p>
<p>of this nature, while speaking of the affairs of that
</p>
<p>time, and of the state of the war. They made no
</p>
<p>disclosure of their own project, and indeed had not
</p>
<p>the slightest intention to do so ; but they now, in
</p>
<p>presence of the ambassador, ingenuously confessed
</p>
<p>that, in the warmth of conversation, they had some-
</p>
<p>times been carried too far, and had used expressions
</p>
<p>which might possibly have betrayed them. The am-

<p>bassador advised them to be more circumspect in fu-
</p>
<p>44 CONSPIRACY OF THE
</p>
<p>ture, and hinted that their experience should teach
</p>
<p>them that, to preserve an important undertaking re-
</p>
<p>ally secret, it is not enough to say nothing, and to
</p>
<p>do nothing relative to it, but they must forget that
</p>
<p>they know any thing concerning it.
</p>
<p>Afterwards Renault stated, that rumors of peace
</p>
<p>being again circulated, at the close of the month of
</p>
<p>June, the Venetian officers had ill treated the foreign
</p>
<p>troops ; and that, not being restrained by the author-
</p>
<p>ity of the count of Nassau, who had died about that
</p>
<p>time, these troops had shown symptoms of discontent
</p>
<p>before Gradisca ; that the general of the republic,
</p>
<p>fearing that a disturbance might ensue, had placed
</p>
<p>them in several posts distant from each other ; that,
</p>
<p>perceiving from this precaution that they were re-
</p>
<p>garded with distrust, they had revolted, and refused
</p>
<p>with insolence to obey certain orders of the senate ;
</p>
<p>that the general had thought it his duty to execute
</p>
<p>the leaders of the mutiny ; that he had confined the
</p>
<p>principal officers in Padua, and placed the rest in
</p>
<p>diiferent posts, in Lombardy, until their wage's could
</p>
<p>be paid, and the conclusion of peace should permit
</p>
<p>him to disband them.
</p>
<p>Renault added, that the lieutenant of the count of
</p>
<p>Nassau, who was one of those with whom he had
</p>
<p>carried on a correspondence, had been banished to
</p>
<p>Brescia ; that he had there concerted a plan, by
</p>
<p>means of which he could deliver that city into the
</p>
<p>hands of don Pedro ; and that it was necessary to

<p>come to some determination on this point immedi-

<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 4
</p>
<p>ately, as the lieutenant insisted on an early and deci-
</p>
<p>sive answer.
</p>
<p>The ambassador replied, that no movement ought
</p>
<p>to be made in that quarter, until they were masters
</p>
<p>of Venice ; that even then they had need of but one
</p>
<p>place in Lombardy ; that they were sure of Crema,.
</p>
<p>and this new project would be attended with the
</p>
<p>disadvantage of dividing their forces ; that, neverthe-
</p>
<p>less, it was expedient to preserve the friendship of
</p>
<p>those whom he had engaged, but to defer, from time
</p>
<p>to time, under some pretext or other, the execution
</p>
<p>of this project ; and that it would be advisable to
</p>
<p>abandon it, rather than hazard the slightest agitation.
</p>
<p>Renault then stated that, besides this heutenant,
</p>
<p>he had engaged three Frenchmen named Durand,
</p>
<p>who were sergeants-major of the regiments of Lieves-
</p>
<p>tein, Brainville, and Bribe ; a Savoyard named Ter-
</p>
<p>non, who was present at the assault on Geneva ; a
</p>
<p>Dutchman named Theodore ; Robert Revellido, an
</p>
<p>Italian engineer ; and two other Italians who had
</p>
<p>formerly been employed in the arsenal, the one nam-
</p>
<p>ed Louis de Villa-mezzana, a captain of light horse,
</p>
<p>the other William Retrosi, lieutenant of captain Ho-
</p>
<p>norat, in Parma ; that he had found it necessary to
</p>
<p>make a full disclosure to these nine persons, but he
</p>
<p>had selected them with such care that he would an-
</p>
<p>swer for their fidelity with his life ; that, wiiile he
</p>
<p>continued in the camp, they had engaged more than
</p>
<p>two hundred officers ; that to these officers he had

<p>nierely stated, as the ambassador had directed, that

</p>
<p>whenever necessary, they would be required to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed to Venice, to protect his excellency from the
</p>
<p>populace of that city ; that since his return, having,
</p>
<p>by letter, requested a statement of the exact number
</p>
<p>of men upon whom he might securely rely, he had
</p>
<p>been assured that he might depend upon two thou-
</p>
<p>sand, at the least, of the troops of Lievestein, and
</p>
<p>upon two thousand three hundred of those of Nas-
</p>
<p>sau ; that all the officers were ready to place them-
</p>
<p>selves in his power, as security for this engagement ;
</p>
<p>that, from the beginning of the negotiation, they had
</p>
<p>flattered their soldiers with the prospect that, when
</p>
<p>disbanded by the repubhc, they should be employ-
</p>
<p>ed on some expedition, in which they would obtain a
</p>
<p>rich reward for the privations and distresses they had
</p>
<p>endured ; that there was no reason for apprehending
</p>
<p>that the pecuhar nature of the enterprise would,
</p>
<p>when disclosed to them, diminish their ardor ; that
</p>
<p>they were so exasperated against the senate, on ac-
</p>
<p>count of the ignominious treatment they had received,
</p>
<p>that, were they to act from no other impulse, they

<p>would hesitate at nothing to obtain revenge ; that,
</p>
<p>nevertheless, for greater safety, the secret should not
</p>
<p>be communicated, if such was the wish of the mar-
</p>
<p>quis, until matters were so well arranged, and the en-
</p>
<p>terprise so near its accomplishment, that little doubt
</p>
<p>could be entertained of its success ; and that, the
</p>
<p>resolution having been taken to deliver up Venice to

<p>the opportunity to enrich himself^ in a way so certain
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 47
</p>
<p>\d prompt, and thus be enabled to live in opulence
</p>
<p>the remainder of his days.
</p>
<p>When the enterprise first occurred to the marquis
</p>
<p>of Bedmar, he resolved that he would not engage in
</p>
<p>it, until he had obtained the control of more means
</p>
<p>than were sufficient to ensure success ; and that these
</p>
<p>means should be so independent and disconnected
</p>
<p>that, should it happen that any one should fail him,
</p>
<p>the others would not, for that reason, be less efficient.
</p>
<p>With this view, though he relied with certainty upon
</p>
<p>what don Pedro had promised, and upon the engage-
</p>
<p>ment of the Dutch officers with whom Renault had
</p>
<p>negotiated, he had adopted measures to procure
</p>
<p>troops from the duke of Ossuna. With each of these
</p>
<p>he had made the same engagements for assistance,
</p>
<p>as if he had sought none from the others, and as if he
</p>
<p>had determined to execute three different projects.
</p>
<p>The time had arrived when it was necessary to
</p>
<p>know the precise moment when the duke of Ossuna
</p>
<p>could despatch to Venice the force he had engaged
</p>
<p>to furnish. But as, from his character, they could
</p>
<p>not safely rely upon his word, in an affair of such im-
</p>
<p>portance and delicacy, they determined to send to
</p>
<p>Naples some one capable of judging, on the spot,
</p>
<p>whether he was in a condition to fulfil his engage-
</p>
<p>ment. Should the captain leave Venice, his absence
</p>
<p>would occasion suspicion ; it was necessary that Re-
</p>
<p>nault should remain in the city ; therefore, as the
</p>
<p>most proper person to makejthis voyage, they selected

<p>de Bribe, one of the Frenchmen whom Renault had
</p>
<p>48 CONSPIRACY OF THE
</p>
<p>engaged at Friali. But he having received from the
</p>
<p>republic, when on the point of departing, a commis-
</p>
<p>sion to enlist recruits, they thought it expedient that
</p>
<p>he should remain and perform that service ; and
</p>
<p>another Frenchman, named Laurent Nolot, a com-
</p>
<p>rade of the captain, left Venice in his stead, on the
</p>
<p>first day of the year 1618.
</p>
<p>The marquis of Bedmar thought that the proper
</p>
<p>time had also arrived for coming to an explicit under-
</p>
<p>standing with the council of Spain. To anticipate
</p>
<p>all the explanations which they might require, he sent
</p>
<p>them a detailed and circumstantial account of his proj-
</p>
<p>ect. And as he was well aware that this court was
</p>
<p>dilatory in its deliberations, he insisted, in a private
</p>
<p>letter to the duke of Lerma, upon an early and deci-
</p>
<p>sive answer, observing that the dangers by which he
</p>
<p>was surrounded gave him a right to speak in this ab-
</p>
<p>solute manner, and declaring that, if they detained
</p>
<p>his courier more than eight days, he should interpret
</p>
<p>this delay as an order to abandon the enterprise.
</p>
<p>He received an answer within the time he prescrib-
</p>
<p>ed, but it was not so decisive as he desired. He was
</p>
<p>instructed that, should there be disadvantage in delay,
</p>
<p>he should proceed to the execution of his design ; but
</p>
<p>they expressed a strong desire to receive previously,
</p>
<p>if possible, a full and exact description of the state
</p>
<p>of the republic.
</p>
<p>The ambassador, who was already prepared on this
</p>
<p>point, immediately drew 4.ip a statement so able and so

<p>elegant that the Spaniards have pronounced it the
</p>
<p>SPANIAllDS AGAINST VENICE. 49
</p>
<p>most finished of all their state papers. It does not
</p>
<p>appear for what purpose it was prepared ; but those
</p>
<p>who read it with a knowledge of the purpose, per-
</p>
<p>ceive that every word bears upon the design in view.
</p>
<p>He begins by setting forth the difficulty of the task,
</p>
<p>on account of the impenetrable secrecy of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment which he was about to describe. He next
</p>
<p>speaks in praise of that government ; but his eulo-
</p>
<p>gium applies rather to the first age of the re-
</p>
<p>public, than to its present condition. He then, in el-
</p>
<p>oquent language, makes the trite remark, that such is
</p>
<p>the deplorable condition of human affairs, that what-
</p>
<p>ever is most excellent is most hable to corruption ;
</p>
<p>that thus the wisest laws of this republic, being abus-
</p>
<p>ed, have been the principal causes of its degeneracy ;
</p>
<p>that the law, which excludes the people from all par-
</p>
<p>ticipation in the government, originated and confirmed
</p>
<p>the tyranny of the nobles, and that, which subjects
</p>
<p>the ecclesiastical to the civil authority, had occasion-
</p>
<p>ed and encouraged a spirit of disaffection towards the
</p>
<p>court of Rome, which was openly manifested by the
</p>
<p>people of Venice, after their quarrel with that court.
</p>
<p>He exaggerates this disaffection by stating acts of
</p>
<p>impiety which, as was reported, the Dutch had com-
</p>
<p>mitted with impunity at Friuh. He exclaims partic-
</p>

<p>who instigated the senate to commit this offence
</p>
<p>against the established religion. He expresses sur-
</p>
<p>prise that the people, whose reverence for the civil
</p>
<p>magistrate must be weakened by the contempt of re-
</p>
<p>ligion which they often witnessed, could patiently
</p>
<p>endure the cruel oppressions of their rulers. These
</p>
<p>oppressions he describes in detail; and from his des-
</p>
<p>cription, in which nothing is exaggerated, they ap-
</p>
<p>pear intolerable. He then shows that the honour and
</p>
<p>and lives, not less than the property of the people,
</p>
<p>are in the power of the great ; and that, devoted as
</p>
<p>the nation is to avarice, to vengeance and to love, it
</p>
<p>is not surprising that those in inferior stations should
</p>
<p>be oppressed by their supe*iors. In fine, he exam-
</p>
<p>ines the condition of the senate, of the provinces, of
</p>
<p>the army, and of the navy. He observes that divis-
</p>
<p>ions exist in the senate, and does not scruple to say
</p>
<p>that he is acquainted with many disaffected nobles.
</p>
<p>He describes the desolation of the provinces, some
</p>
<p>laid waste by the Uscoques, and others exhausted by
</p>
<p>their exertions to render assistance. He declares
</p>
<p>that, in all Lombardy, there are not three officers to
</p>
<p>a garrison, who receive pay, and that the govern-
</p>
<p>ment retains its authority there solely because no one
</p>
<p>comes forward to wrest it from them. As to the ar-
</p>
<p>my, he gives a faithful account of the revolts that had
</p>
<p>occurred ; he states how the mutineers had been dis-
</p>
<p>persed, and observes that these were so numerous

<p>discipline. As to the navy, it had become the asylum
</p>
<p>of the infamous pirates of the Mediterranean, men
</p>
<p>destitute of character, and upon whose fidelity the
</p>
<p>republic could not rely one moment after they should
</p>
<p>have become strong enough to turn her own arms
</p>
<p>against herself.
</p>
<p>After having stated these particulars, with admira-
</p>
<p>ble beauty of language and force of expression, he
</p>
<p>enquires what opinion should be formed as to the fu-
</p>
<p>ture condition of this republic, its fortune and its du-
</p>
<p>ration ; and he proves, by the inferences which nat-
</p>
<p>urally flow from the facts he had established, that it is
</p>
<p>already in its decrepitude ; that its disorders are of
</p>
<p>such a nature, that no remedy could be effectual that
</p>
<p>should not entirely change its constitution.
</p>
<p>Having considered thig exposition of the state of
</p>
<p>Venice, the council of Spain gave the marquis of Bed-
</p>
<p>mar permission, but sent him no order, to proceed.
</p>
<p>Yet as Nolot did not return, nothing could be done ;
</p>
<p>and the marquis could not console himself for having,
</p>
<p>in an affair of this nature, exposed himself to the ca-
</p>
<p>price of the duke of Ossuna, whom he ought long
</p>
<p>since to have thoroughly known. The delay, at this
</p>
<p>juncture, was important. After the Spaniards had
</p>
<p>taken Vercelh', the siege of Gradisca was pressed with
</p>
<p>great vigor, by the Venetians, and the council of
</p>
<p>Spain saw no mode of saving it, but by renewing
</p>
<p>propositions of peace. A project of a treaty, con-
</p>
<p>taining the principal articles, was therefore drawn up,

<p>CONSPIRACY OF THE

<p>the diike of Ossuna obliged the Venetians to revoke
</p>
<p>the powers of their ambassador, and transfer the ne-
</p>
<p>gotiation to France, where the death of marshal
</p>
<p>d'Ancre gave hope of a favorable issue. Peace was
</p>
<p>concluded, at Paris, on the 6th of September.
</p>
<p>The governor of Milan had a conference, soon af-
</p>
<p>ter, at Pavia, with the count de Bethune to make ar-
</p>
<p>rangements for the execution of the treaty, so far as
</p>
<p>regarded the duke of Savoy ; but, at the same time,.
</p>
<p>this governor continued to harass the Venetians, and
</p>
<p>even took several little towns belonging to them, in-
</p>
<p>Lombardy. They complained loudly of this con-
</p>
<p>duct, and made preparations to carry on the war
</p>
<p>mor<3 vigorously than ever. The marquis of Bed-
</p>
<p>mar therefore offered, in full senate, his congratula-^
</p>
<p>tions upon the conclusion of peace, and engaged that
</p>
<p>whatever had been agreed upon should be performed.
</p>
<p>He was induced to take this step, not so much be-
</p>
<p>cause he had received orders frem Spain, as because
</p>
<p>he was desirous of effacing the unfavorable impres-
</p>
<p>sions, in relation to him, which the late transactions
</p>
<p>had made upon the senate. With this view, he per-
</p>
<p>formed the ceremony with all imaginable demonstra
</p>
<p>tions of joy and friendship, and the Venetians, who de--
</p>
<p>sired nothing so much as what he promised, were so
</p>
<p>far deceived by his protestations that they agreed
</p>
<p>upon a suspension of arms.
</p>
<p>This suspension was a stroke of policy on the part
</p>
<p>of the Spaniards, and proved the masterly adroitness

<p>of their ambassador. The siege of Gradisca had
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 55
</p>
<p>been pressed so vigorously that the place could not
</p>
<p>possibly hold out a fortnight. Yet hostilities were
</p>
<p>not to cease until the end of two months, because
</p>
<p>this time had been judged necessary to exchange
</p>
<p>ratifications, and to make arrangements for the execu-
</p>
<p>tion of the treaties. It was necessary to prevent the
</p>
<p>surrender of Gradisca within this time ; the suspen-
</p>
<p>sion of arms placed it out of danger ; and the Span-
</p>
<p>iards, not having this motive to hasten the execution
</p>
<p>of the treaties, remained at full liberty to interpose
</p>
<p>all the delays they might imagine necessary to their
</p>
<p>designs.
</p>
<p>In effect, the duke of Ossuna, constrained by or-
</p>
<p>ders from Madrid, and the urgent representations of
</p>
<p>the pope, offered some time afterwards to restore the
</p>
<p>ships which he had taken ; but, as to the merchan-
</p>
<p>dise, he pretended he could not tell what had becotne
</p>
<p>of it. It was, nevertheless, at this moment, exposed
</p>
<p>to sale at Naples, under the eyes of the Venetian res-
</p>
<p>ident ; and the duke again sent a powerful fleet to
</p>
<p>cruise in the Adriatic. The senate having thought
</p>
<p>proper to complain of this to the marquis of Bedraar.
</p>
<p>he joined in their complaints, and was even louder
</p>
<p>than they. He declared that he could not explain
</p>
<p>nor justify the conduct of the duke ; that the king,
</p>
<p>their master, would not acknowledge it ; that, having
</p>
<p>received, during the period of his embassy at Venice,
</p>
<p>many favors, and much friendly treatment, he had
</p>
<p>but one subject of regret, which was, that the conduct

<p>of this viceroy had been imputed to his counsels ; that,
</p>
<p>54 CONSPIRACY OP THff
</p>
<p>in fact, he had not the slightest participation in it ;
</p>
<p>that, little as they might know of the duke of Ossuna,
</p>
<p>they must be convinced that he was governed solely
</p>
<p>by his caprice ; and that, as to himself, they might
</p>
<p>judge of his disposition, by the pacific conduct of the
</p>
<p>governor of Milan, which, he was proud to say, had
</p>
<p>been in conformity with his advice.
</p>
<p>It was true that the governor faithfully observed the
</p>
<p>engagement to suspend hostile operations ; but yet he
</p>
<p>did not disarm his troops ; and that this conduct
</p>
<p>might appear less strange, he contrived to quarrel
</p>
<p>again with the duke of Savoy, alleging, as a pretext,
</p>
<p>that the troops disbanded by this prince, still remain-
</p>
<p>ed in the Pays de Vaud awaiting the entire execution
</p>
<p>of the treaties. Don Pedro, when required by the
</p>
<p>count de Bethune, refused to disarm, according to
</p>
<p>his promise at Pavia ; and he also persuaded the duke
</p>
<p>of Mantua to perform whatever depended upon him.
</p>
<p>The Count de Bethune, withdrawing upon their refu-
</p>
<p>sal, published a protest against their conduct ; and to
</p>
<p>this protest the most plausible reply was made that
</p>
<p>the marquis of Bedmar could invent.
</p>
<p>From what has been related, it will easily be seen
</p>
<p>that it was important to hasten the execution of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, as it was difficult to maintain affairs, for
</p>
<p>a long time, in the condition essential to its success.
</p>
<p>But tlie duke of Ossuna delayed to send back Nolot ;

<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 55
</p>
<p>A short time after the captain was received into the
</p>
<p>service of the republic, the duke, desirous of gaining,
</p>
<p>from different sources, intelligence of the state of
</p>
<p>Venice, sent thither, as a spy^ an Italian named Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Spinosa. This man, who was unknown, soon
</p>
<p>obtained employment, as did all adventurers who
</p>
<p>came to solicit it. He suspected that the duke con-
</p>
<p>templated some important enterprise, but did not sup-
</p>
<p>pose that the corsair was entrusted to manage it y he
</p>
<p>doubted, however, whether this corsair was on such
</p>
<p>unfriendly terms with the duke as was generally sup-
</p>
<p>posed. After his arrival at Venice, he proposed to
</p>
<p>the viceroy to assassinate the captain ; the viceroy
</p>
<p>dechned the offer, alleging that the attempt would be
</p>
<p>attended with danger. Spinosa, who was not desti-
</p>
<p>tute of sagacity, and was well acquainted with the
</p>
<p>duke, concluded there must be some stronger reason
</p>
<p>for this refusal ; for he could not believe that he
</p>
<p>would hesitate to obtain revenge, at the risk of losing
</p>
<p>one of his men. The duke, however, charged him to
</p>
<p>observe the conduct of the corsair, either to prevent
</p>
<p>him from suspecting the truth, or because he belonged
</p>
<p>to that class of men who suspect every body, and was
</p>
<p>desirous of knowing whether the reports of Spinosa
</p>
<p>and the captain, in relation to the conduct of the lat-
</p>
<p>ter, would agree.
</p>
<p>To enable him to execute his commission, Spinosa
</p>
<p>associated with several Frenchmen, whom he had
</p>
<p>known at Naples, and who were companions of the

<p>captain, at Venice. These men, who were in fact
</p>
<p>56 CONSPIRACY OF THfi
</p>
<p>some of the conspirators, gave to the captain an ex-
</p>
<p>act account of the enquiries made by Spinosa, in rela-
</p>
<p>tion to him ; and they, moreover, discovered that this
</p>
<p>spy was himself concerting some ploi, and endeavoring
</p>
<p>to engage men for the service of the duke of Ossuna.
</p>
<p>The captain felt indignant that the duke distrusted
</p>
<p>him ; but he was not surprised at it ; nevertheless he
</p>
<p>considered that, if Spinosa should continue his in-
</p>
<p>trigue, without coming to an understanding with him,
</p>
<p>he would weaken their party by dividing it ; and
</p>
<p>that, on his part, he could not condescend to solicit
</p>
<p>the confidence of a man who was evidently a spy up-
</p>
<p>on his conduct.
</p>
<p>The marquis of Bedmar and Renault concluded
</p>
<p>also that this difficulty should be immediately remov-
</p>
<p>ed, and after mature deliberation they decided, that
</p>
<p>nothing could ensure their own safety, but the sacri-
</p>
<p>fice of Spinosa. But he was a man who would sell
</p>
<p>his life dearly, should they attempt to assassinate him ;
</p>
<p>the business he had engaged in obliged him to be al-
</p>
<p>ways on his guard ; and the captain, after considering
</p>
<p>and rejecting every other course, was at length oblig-
</p>
<p>ed to accuse him to the council of Ten, as a spy of
</p>
<p>the duke of Ossuna. The Frenchmen, with whom
</p>
<p>he had associated, testified so judiciously against
</p>
<p>him, that he was arrested, and the same day privately
</p>
<p>executed. All that he advanced against the corsair
</p>
<p>made no impression on the minds of the judges, be-
</p>
<p>cause the latter was his accuser, and he could prove

</p>
<p>This affair greatly increased the confidence which
</p>
<p>the Venetians had reposed in the captain ; but still it
</p>
<p>disquieted the marquis of Bedmar, because it admon-
</p>
<p>ed the Venetians to observe more closely the conduct
</p>
<p>of the foreigners in their service.
</p>
<p>The duke of Ossuna had just heard of the death
</p>
<p>of Spinosa, when Nolot arrived at Naples. He was
</p>
<p>at no loss to divine the author. The event displeas-
</p>
<p>ed him ; he was offended that the marquis of Bed-
</p>
<p>mar sent him no account of it ; and the various sus-
</p>
<p>picions which arose in his mind prevented him from
</p>
<p>forming any definite resolution.
</p>
<p>The troops of Lievestein having, In the mean time,
</p>
<p>again mutinied, they were, in the beginning of Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary, marched, by the order of the senate, to the
</p>
<p>Lazaretto, two miles from Venice. The marquis of
</p>
<p>Bedmar, fearing they might themselves, in order to
</p>
<p>obtain their pay, adjust their quarrel with the repub-
</p>
<p>lic, and would then be compelled to leave the coun-
</p>
<p>try, persuaded them, by means of their officers, not
</p>
<p>to receive the sum which was at first offered. The
</p>
<p>conspirators, that they might have it in their power
</p>
<p>to make use of these troops w^iile they remained in
</p>
<p>the vicinity, despatched a courier to Nolot, request-
</p>
<p>ing him to state to the viceroy, that, for a month from
</p>
<p>that time, they should have near five thousand men
</p>
<p>at their command. Nolot discharged his duty ; but
</p>
<p>the viceroy, who had not yet digested his anger,
</p>
<p>amused him so long that, after a suspense of six

<p>weeks, the ofBcers, fearing that their soldiers, who
</p>
<p>58 CONSPIRACY or THE
</p>
<p>suffered much, would make an agreement themselves,
</p>
<p>concluded an arrangement, with the consent of the
</p>
<p>conspirators, who saw no means of preventing it.
</p>
<p>Ten days afterwards, Nolot arrived from Naples,
</p>
<p>with the determination of the duke of Ossuna. It
</p>
<p>was such as they desired, but was addressed to Rob-
</p>
<p>ert Brulard, one of the associates of the captain. The
</p>
<p>ambassador and the captain, rejoicing to be released
</p>
<p>from their perplexity, did not deign to notice this in-
</p>
<p>sult. The viceroy stated that he was ready, when-
</p>
<p>ever they should direct, to send barks, brigantines,
</p>
<p>and other small vessels, adapted to the harbors and
</p>
<p>canals of Venice, and capable of carrying six thou-
</p>
<p>sand men if necessary. Nolot had seen the troops
</p>
<p>and the vessel all prepared to depart j and the cap-
</p>
<p>tain caused the harbors and canals, which led to Su
</p>
<p>Marks, to be sounded. As he had, from his office,
</p>
<p>many mariners at his command, they could, without
</p>
<p>suspicion, visit these harbors and canals, as often as
</p>
<p>they pleased, and take all their dimensions with ex-
</p>
<p>actness.
</p>
<p>Nothing now remained but to prevent the depar-
</p>
<p>ture of the troops of Lievestein. For this purpose,
</p>
<p>money was liberally dispersed, and the inclemency
</p>
<p>of the season served as a pretext for their delay.
</p>
<p>The greater number still remained at the lazaretto,
</p>
<p>and those who had departed before the arrival of No-
</p>
<p>lot, stopped at places near to Venice.

</p>
<p>Others, who should be discreet, courageous, and wor-

<p>thy of entire confidence. They selected the nine
</p>
<p>whom Renault had engaged at Friuli, and the most
</p>
<p>distinguished among those who had followed the cor-
</p>
<p>sair from Naples. Of these, five were captains of
</p>
<p>vessels, like himself ; Vincent Robert of Marseilles,
</p>
<p>Laurent Nolot, and Robert Brulard, who have been
</p>
<p>already mentioned ; the two last, and another Bru-
</p>
<p>lard, named Laurent, were from Franche-compte ;
</p>
<p>another^ from Provence, named Antoine Jaffier ; two
</p>
<p>brothers, from Lorraine, named Charles and John
</p>
<p>Boleau, and and an Italian, John Rizzardo, all three
</p>
<p>well acquainted with the management of the petard ;
</p>
<p>and a Frenchman called Langlade, who was consid-
</p>
<p>ered the most skilful artificer of fire-works that ever
</p>
<p>lived. His skill was so well known that he had ob-
</p>
<p>tained permission to work at his business at the arse-
</p>
<p>nal ; by this means, the petardiers, his comrades,
</p>
<p>were freely allowed to enter the arsenal, as well as
</p>
<p>two others, named Villa Mezzana and Retrosi, who
</p>
<p>had been employed there before, and who were of
</p>
<p>the number that Renault had engaged.
</p>
<p>These six persons drew such an exact plan of the
</p>
<p>arsenal, that those, who had never seen it, could delib-
</p>
<p>erate concerning it, as well as those who had built it.
</p>
<p>In this they were much assisted by two officers of the
</p>
<p>arsenal, whom the captain had gained to his party.

</p>
<p>Langlade and the two officers lodged in the arse-

</p>
<p>with Renault, at the house of the French ambassador.
</p>
<p>'The three petardiers lived with the marquis of Bed-
</p>
<p>mar, who supplied them with powder and other nee*
</p>
<p>essary materials and instruments, but had no intern-
</p>
<p>course with them. They had already made more
</p>
<p>petards and fire-works than were necessary, and the
</p>
<p>ambassador's house was so full that no others could
</p>
<p>lodge there. The captain lived in his own house
</p>
<p>and alone, that suspicion might not be excited ; and
</p>
<p>the others he placed at the house of the courtesan,
</p>
<p>where he and Renault became acquainted with each
</p>
<p>other. The esteem and friendship which succeeded
</p>
<p>to the love they had felt for her, but still more the
</p>
<p>knowledge they had obtained of her adventures, per-
</p>
<p>suaded them that they could not make a better se-

</p>
<p>her father required the fulfilments of his promise, he
</p>
<p>caused him to be assassinated. The daughter re-
</p>
<p>paired to Venice to demand the punishment of the
</p>
<p>murderer, but she obtained no redress ; and having,
</p>
<p>in prosecuting her suit, expended all the property she
</p>
<p>possessed, her beauty reheved her from the misery it
</p>
<p>occasioned. No passion is so violent as the resent-
</p>
<p>ment of a person compelled to descend from a re-
</p>
<p>spectable to a degraded rank. The project of her
</p>
<p>two friends gave her inexpressible pleasure, and she
</p>
<p>was willing to risk every thing to aid it. She rented
</p>
<p>one of the largest houses in Venice ; and, under the
</p>
<p>pretext of making some alterations, she forbore to
</p>
<p>remove her furniture into it, and thus retained, with-
</p>
<p>out exciting suspicion, the one she before occupied,
</p>
<p>and which was not far distant.
</p>
<p>In these two houses, eleven of the principal con-
</p>
<p>spirators resided, for near six months. As sbe was
</p>
<p>visited by all the genteel Venetians and foreigners,
</p>
<p>and as this crowd of people, flocking to her house,
</p>
<p>might lead to the discovery of her inmates, she feign-
</p>
<p>ed an excuse to prevent these visits. They, who
</p>
<p>know with what civility women of her character are
</p>
<p>treated in Italy, will readily beheve that her house
</p>
<p>was afterwards visited by none but such as went
</p>
<p>thither on business. The conspirators left it in the
</p>
<p>night only, and their meetings were held during the
</p>
<p>day.

<p>62 CONSPIRACY OF THE
</p>
<p>been agreed upon with marquis of Bedmar, that their
</p>
<p>opinions might be obtained and the means of execut-
</p>
<p>ing them be devised. Whenever it was necessary
</p>
<p>to visit the marquis, they repaired to his house, with
</p>
<p>all the circumspection required in a country hke this,
</p>
<p>and at a time when the houses of ambassadors, and
</p>
<p>particularly his, were watched as though they were
</p>
<p>the abode of enemies. It had long been determined
</p>
<p>that it was necessary to have a thousand soldiers in
</p>
<p>the city, before the execution of their plot ; but as it
</p>
<p>might occasion suspicion should all bring arms, the
</p>
<p>marquis had procured them for more than five hun-
</p>
<p>dred. As the gondolas of ambassadors, from what-
</p>
<p>ever quarter they come, are not visited, he had found
</p>
<p>it easy to do this : and nothing was now wanting but
</p>
<p>an opportunity to introduce the requisite number of
</p>
<p>men without exciting observation.
</p>
<p>About this time, the doge Donato died, and Anto-
</p>
<p>nio Priuli, who was then at Friuli to enforce the exe-
</p>
<p>cution of the treaties, was elected in his stead. The
</p>
<p>admiral was ordered to repair thither, with his fleet,
</p>
<p>and escort him to Venice. The grand chancellor,
</p>
<p>and the secretaries of state, were to proceed in ad-
</p>
<p>vance, and bear to him the ducal bonnet. Twelve
</p>
<p>of the prinipal senators were to follow, each in aii
</p>
<p>armed brigantine magnificently decorated, and accoifidlHj
</p>
<p>panied by a splendid suite ; and the senate, in a
</p>
<p>body, were to meet him at sea, and conduct hina^
</p>
<p>with all this retinue, to the city. ^

<p>As it had seldom happened that those who were
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE.
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>elected to the office of doge, were, at the time, ab-
</p>
<p>sent from the city, this unusual pomp attracted to it a
</p>
<p>large number of people. The marquis of Bedmar,
</p>
<p>who anticipated this when he heard of the election of
</p>
<p>Priuli, sent Nolot again to Naples, directing him to
</p>
<p>insist on the immediate departure of the duke of Os-
</p>
<p>suna. To remove all excuse for delay, the captain
</p>
<p>was directed to send to the duke an exact plan of the
</p>
<p>enterprise, and to give him an account of all that
</p>
<p>occurred at Venice, during the former absence of
</p>
<p>Nolot. The corsair did even more than he was di-
</p>
<p>rected. Willing to humour the caprice of the vice-
</p>
<p>roy, and to show that they felt no dissatisfaction at
</p>
<p>his conduct, he concluded his despatch with these
</p>
<p>words.  " I attribute the long delay of Nolot, at Na-
</p>
<p>ples, to his remissnes ; for 1 do not doubt that, had
</p>
<p>he represented things truly, your excellency would
</p>
<p>have hastened his return. He doubtless asked for
</p>
<p>money, or made some other demand of that nature,
</p>
<p>but he had express orders to the contrary ; and I
</p>
<p>now engage to retain Venice in my power six months,
</p>
<p>should not the grand fleet of your excellency arrive
</p>
<p>sooner, provided you send me the brigantines, and
</p>
<p>the six thousand men, immediately after Nolot reach-
</p>
<p>es Naples." This letter bears date the 11th of April,
</p>
<p>the day Nolot left Venice.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, Renault assembled, at Venice,
</p>
<p>all the officers of the troops he had engaged, that they

<p>might gain such a knowledge of the city as to be able

</p>
<p>came, they designated individually a thousand of the
</p>
<p>Dutch troops, who were directed to hold themselves
</p>
<p>in readiness to march at a day's notice ; and to pre-
</p>
<p>vent the absence of these men from being remarked,
</p>
<p>they were selected, in equal proportions, from the va-
</p>
<p>rious posts, where those troops were stationed. To
</p>
<p>lodge these troops, each of the officers engaged as-
</p>
<p>many apartments as he could without exciting suspi-
</p>
<p>cion ; the landlords were told that these apartments
</p>
<p>were engaged for foreigners, who were desirous of
</p>
<p>witnessing the approaching celebration. The officers
</p>
<p>themselves lodged at the houses of courtezans, where,
</p>
<p>paying liberally, they were more effectually conceal-
</p>
<p>ed than they could have been in any other place.
</p>
<p>Nothing now remained but to arrange the plan of
</p>
<p>execution ; and the marquis of Bedmar, Renault^
</p>
<p>and the captain, conferring together, determined up-
</p>
<p>on the following.

<p>''As soon as it shall be dark, that portion of the

</p>
<p>er part of the other five hundred will go to the neigh-
</p>
<p>bourhood of the arsenal, where they will be joined by

<p>troops drawn up in order of battle. And all these
</p>
<p>things must be done with as little noise and disturb-
</p>
<p>ance as possible.
</p>
<p>" The conspirators will then openly proceed to force,
</p>
<p>with petards, the gate of the arsenal. At this signal,
</p>
<p>the eight conspirators, who have drawn the plan of
</p>
<p>it, and who will be witliin, shall, with the artificial
</p>
<p>fire works prepared for the purpose, set fire to it, in
</p>
<p>different places, and put the principal officers to the
</p>
<p>sword. This they may easily do, in the confusion
</p>
<p>which the petards and the fire will occasion, especial-
</p>
<p>ly as these officers will have no suspicion of their
</p>
<p>purpose. They will join Renault as soon as he shall
</p>
<p>have gained admittance, and every person belonging
</p>
<p>to the arsenal shall immediately be killed. The sol-
</p>
<p>diers will then convey the cannon to the places where

<p>they can be used with most effect, particularly to the

<p>Arena de Mari, to the Fontego de Tedeschi, to

<p>the salt magazines, to the belfrey of the procurator's

<p>palace, to the bridge of Rialto, and to other elevated

</p>
<p>be killed ; and persons, engaged for the purpose,
</p>

</p>
<p>tant as possible from each other, in order to increase^
</p>
<p>the confusion.
</p>
<p>" In the mean time, the Spaniards despatched by
</p>
<p>the duke of Ossuna, having heard the signal, which
</p>
<p>will have been given on becoming masters of the ar-
</p>
<p>senal, will debark at the square of St. Marks, and in-
</p>
<p>stantly proceed, in detachments, to different quarters

</p>
<p>leaders of the conspiracy.

</p>
<p>these orders are executed, the city shall be given up

<p>every one shall be spared who ceases to resist."
</p>
<p>Nolot, on arriving at Naples, found every thing in
</p>
<p>such a state of preparation, that the six thousand men
</p>
<p>were embarked the next day, under the command of
</p>
<p>an Englishman of the name of Haillot. To avoid
</p>
<p>suspicion the duke of Ossuna directed that his large
</p>
<p>ships should make a long circuit ; but he sent Haillot
</p>
<p>and the brigantines by the shortest route. On the
</p>
<p>second day of their voyage, these brigantines were
</p>
<p>attacked by a squadron of corsairs from Barbary.
</p>
<p>As they were constructed for the transport of troops,
</p>
<p>and were not fitted to engage in a regular action,
</p>
<p>they suffered much from the artillery of the Barba-
</p>
<p>rians, whose brigantines were better armed, and

<p>could be managed with more ease. But though the
</p>
<p>08 CONSPIRACY OF THtl
</p>
<p>men on board the Neapolitan vessels were too nu-
</p>
<p>merous to act with regularity and freedom, yet as
</p>
<p>they were all Spaniards, selected for the occasion,
</p>
<p>they treated so harshly such of the enemy as they
</p>
<p>could grapple with, that these corsairs would proba-
</p>
<p>bly have had cause to regret having encountered
</p>
<p>them, had not a furious storm, occurring in the heat
</p>
<p>of the engagement, dispersed both fleets. That of
</p>
<p>the duke of Ossuna received so much damage that it
</p>
<p>could not again venture to sea, for some time.
</p>
<p>The news of this disaster convinced the marquis
</p>
<p>of Bed mar that he could not disturb the approaching
</p>
<p>festivities. He therefore participated in them, dis-
</p>
<p>playing more magnificence than any other person.
</p>
<p>He declared, in the senate, when congratulating the
</p>
<p>new doge upon his elevation, that the lively joy he
</p>
<p>experienced arose from his confidence that his high-
</p>
<p>ness would retain, on the throne, that earnest desire
</p>
<p>for the execution of the treaty of peace, which he had
</p>
<p>lately expressed at Friuli.
</p>
<p>On leaving the senate, he sent for Renault and the
</p>
<p>captain. Shall the enterprise, he asked them, be
</p>
<p>abandoned ? They replied, that not only were they
</p>
<p>unwilling to abandon it, but their associates appear-
</p>
<p>ed no more disheartened by the disaster of the fleet,
</p>
<p>than if it had arrived safe in port ; and that they were
</p>
<p>all disposed to take the necessary means to preserve
</p>
<p>affairs in their present condition, until circumstances
</p>
<p>should become more favorable. The ambassador,

<p>them, on hearing this reply, with tears of joy. He
</p>
<p>said to them, with a gaiety and animation which wouhi
</p>
<p>have inspired the timid with boldness, and revived
</p>
<p>the confidence of the most terrified, that great rever-
</p>
<p>ses, which, in common affairs, might divert men from
</p>
<p>their purposes, are but natural incidents in extraordi-
</p>
<p>nary enterprises ; that they test the strength o( the
</p>
<p>mind ^ and that then only ought a man to consider
</p>
<p>himself capable of accomplishing a diihcult enterprise,
</p>
<p>when he has been once defeated, and preserved his
</p>
<p>equanimity and firmness.
</p>
<p>It was finally determined, by the marquis and his
</p>
<p>two confidents, that the execution of their project
</p>
<p>should be deferred until the feast of Ascension, which
</p>
<p>was near, and was, at that period, the most solemn
</p>
<p>festival celebrated at Venice ; that, in the meantime,
</p>
<p>the troops should be kept in the places they then oc-
</p>
<p>cupied, and all the comforts and conveniences they
</p>
<p>could desire should be furnished them ; that, for this
</p>
<p>purpose, money should be freely distributed among
</p>
<p>the principal officers : that, of the three hundred
</p>
<p>who had repaired to Venice, the most distinguished
</p>
<p>should be detained, as hostages for the fidelity of the
</p>
<p>rest, and the others sent back, as well to retain the
</p>
<p>soldiers in their duty, as to avoid exciting suspicion,
</p>
<p>by lessening the number of officers in the city ; that
</p>
<p>the time of those who remained should be occupied
</p>
<p>in some agreeable manner, to prevent them from be-
</p>
<p>ing wearied by waiting, and from reflecting too much

<p>on the present state of affairs ; that the twenty prin-
</p>
<p>70 CONSPIRACY OF THE
</p>
<p>cipal conspirators should attentively observe their
</p>
<p>conduct ; and that, to induce the republic to retain
</p>
<p>the troops of Lievestein, and to defer dismissing those
</p>
<p>of Nassau, the governor of Milan, and the viceroy of
</p>
<p>Naples, should delay carrying the treaties into exe-
</p>
<p>cution.
</p>
<p>Every pretext, which human ingenuity could de-
</p>
<p>vise, was invented by the marquis of Bedmar, and
</p>
<p>put in practice by don Pedro and the duke of Ossuna ;
</p>
<p>nevertheless, they were constantly impelled, howev-
</p>
<p>er contrary it might have been to tiieir inclinations,
</p>
<p>to take steps which led to peace. The council of
</p>
<p>Spain dared hazard nothing upon the uncertain pros-
</p>
<p>pect of the success of the conspiracy ; and France,
</p>
<p>desirous of maintaining the treaty of Paris, persuad-
</p>
<p>ed the Venetians te consent that the duke of Savoy
</p>
<p>should dismiss the troops, who, remaining in the
</p>
<p>Pays de Vaud, afforded to don Pedro a pretext for
</p>
<p>his delays. This obstacle removed, the marquis of
</p>
<p>Bedmar, in hope of preventing this prince from re-
</p>
<p>storing the places he had taken in Montferrat, circu-
</p>
<p>lated a report that, as soon as the duke of Mantau
</p>
<p>should regain possession, he would enter into some
</p>
<p>arrangement with the Spaniards.
</p>
<p>At the same time, don Pedro quarrelled, without
</p>
<p>cause, with a minister from Savoy, who had come to
</p>
<p>Milan with the French ambassadors, and command-
</p>
<p>ed him to quit the city. The duke, irritated by this
</p>
<p>insLdt, directed them to repair to Savoy, and counter-

<p>manded the orders he had given to evacuate the
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE 71
</p>
<p>places he occupied ; but, convinced by the ambassa-
</p>
<p>dors that he had fallen into the snare set for him by
</p>
<p>don Pedro, he instantly surrendered those places. So
</p>
<p>great was the astonishment of don Pedro, when he
</p>
<p>heard of this, that he could not forbear expressing it
</p>
<p>m public. He felt it to be necessary t give up also
</p>
<p>his prisoners, and the places of least importance ;
</p>
<p>but, as to restoring VercelH, the important point, he
</p>
<p>made such unreasonable objections, that the council
</p>
<p>of Spain threatened to recal him, before the usual pe-
</p>
<p>riod. At first, he declared that it would be disgrace-
</p>
<p>ful for him to restore Vercelii, whilst the French am-
</p>
<p>bassadors remained at Milan, for the purpose, as it
</p>
<p>seemed, of compelling him to do it. They quitted
</p>
<p>that city. He then insisted that the duke of Savoy
</p>
<p>should previously restore certain lands, w^hich belong-
</p>
<p>ed to ministers of Mantua. These lands were re-
</p>
<p>stored ; yet don Pedro still kept possession of Ver-
</p>
<p>celii. At length, the king of France, who wished to
</p>
<p>conclude a marriage between Madam Christiana,
</p>
<p>his sister, and the prince of Piedmont, having expres-
</p>
<p>sed himself plainly and decisively on this subject,
</p>
<p>don Pedro began to send off the munitions of war and
</p>
<p>the artillery, but proceeded with all possible slowness.

<p>The marquis of Bedmar having requested him to

</p>
<p>Whatever chagrin this declaration occasioned to
</p>
<p>the Marquis of Bedmar, the conduct of the duke of
</p>
<p>Ossuna occasioned still greater. This duke, haras-
</p>
<p>sed by the incessant complaints of the Venetians, that
</p>
<p>he continued to disturb the navigation of the gulf,
</p>
<p>and unable to devise any other nev^^ pretence to justi-
</p>
<p>fy himself, made answer, that he should pursue the
</p>
<p>same measures so long as the Venetians retained in
</p>
<p>their service the most inveterate enemies of the king
</p>
<p>his master. The feelings of the marquis, on hearing
</p>
<p>this reply of the duke, may be easily imagined, when
</p>
<p>it is recollected what pains he had taken to detain in
</p>
<p>the city the troops from Holland, to whom the duke
</p>
<p>alluded. He had no doubt that the senate, who were
</p>
<p>desirous of peace, at any price, would, to deprive the
</p>
<p>viceroy of all excuse, immediately dismiss them ; but
</p>
<p>the event was again at variance with the well-founded
</p>
<p>anticipation of the marquis.
</p>
<p>Some demon, favorable to the extravagances of the
</p>
<p>duke of Ossuna, impelled the Venetians to pursue a
</p>
<p>course directly contrary to their inclinations and their
</p>
<p>interest. It was suggested to the senate, that the re-
</p>
<p>public had already given too many proofs of its desire
</p>
<p>for peace ; that it was this that encouraged the Span-
</p>
<p>iards to delay the execution of the treaties ; that, if
</p>
<p>the last demand of the viceroy were granted, he
</p>
<p>would be led to think they would assent to any thing ;
</p>
<p>and that, instead of dismissing these troops, it was
</p>
<p>necessary to retain in service even the regiment of

</p>
<p>The pleasure which this resolution gave to the
</p>
<p>marquis of Bedmar was disturbed by the discovery
</p>
<p>of the plot at Crema. Alfier, the officer from Pro-
</p>
<p>vence, and the Italian captain, who were stationed
</p>
<p>there, and had been engaged in the conspiracy, hav-
</p>
<p>ing quarrelled at play, a duel was the consequence,
</p>
<p>in which the captain was mortally wounded. Before
</p>
<p>he expired, he, to relieve his conscience, made a full
</p>
<p>disclosure to the Venetian commander. Alfier, an-
</p>
<p>ticipating this, absconded immediately after wound-
</p>
<p>ing his adversary, taking with him all his accomplices
</p>
<p>whom he could apprize of their danger. The re-
</p>
<p>mainder, among whom was the French Heutenant,
</p>
<p>who was the principal, were arrested ; but as Re-
</p>
<p>nault had made himself known merely as an agent
</p>
<p>from Milan, and as they knew nothing more concern-
</p>
<p>ing him, don Pedro only was implicated by the dis-
</p>
<p>closure.
</p>
<p>Eight days afterwards, the sergeant major, who
</p>
<p>had agreed to deliver up Marano to the conspirators,
</p>
<p>having kept back, for his own emolument, a part of
</p>
<p>the perquisites of a servant of the purveyor, and of a
</p>
<p>pensioner of the republic, they, irritated by (he loss,
</p>
<p>entered his house in his absence, broke open his
</p>
<p>trunks, and carried away his money and papers.
</p>
<p>Among these were letters on the subject of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. As he knew only the agent of the duke of
</p>
<p>Ossuna, who had negotiated with him, he would have
</p>
<p>accused none but the duke ; but he pursued a r iore
</p>
<p>honorable course. In the midst of torments, he ue-

<p>74 CONSPIRACY OF THE
</p>
<p>clared that he was well convinced he should not be
</p>
<p>permitted to escape, and that he had rather leave his
</p>
<p>accomplices, if he had any, in a condition to avenge
</p>
<p>his death, than, by making disclosures, to ruin them
</p>
<p>without any advantage to himself. Thanks to God
</p>
<p>v/ere offered publicly in Venice, on occasion of these
</p>
<p>two discoveries. The success of the enterprise was,
</p>
<p>however, rendered more certain than before. The
</p>
<p>senate supposed they had, at length, ascertained the
</p>
<p>secret cause of the irregular conduct of the Span-
</p>
<p>iards ; and, after these two projects had failed, they
</p>
<p>imagined that all danger was over, and no longer
</p>
<p>doubted the complete fulfilment of the treaties.
</p>
<p>The time assigned for the execution of the enter-
</p>
<p>prise was now near. From the Sunday preceding
</p>
<p>the feast of Ascension to the day of Pentecost, one
</p>
<p>of the most celebrated fairs in the world, was, at that
</p>
<p>period, held at Venice. The crowd of merchants,
</p>
<p>who then visited the city, did not increase the difficul-
</p>
<p>ty of surprising it ; on the contrary, it afforded to
</p>
<p>the body of one thousand soldiers, an opportunity of
</p>
<p>entering with the merchants, and of procuring lodg-
</p>
<p>ings without being remarked. They found it easy to
</p>
<p>leave the Venetian towns where they were posted,
</p>
<p>because, for several months, those most anxious to
</p>
<p>return to their native country had, from time to time,
</p>
<p>been dismissed ; and the magistrates, whose duty it
</p>
<p>was to impose regulations, neglected to interfere, be-
</p>
<p>cause the republic paid nothing for their services. As

<p>alarm, most of them declared that they were going to
</p>
<p>the fair at Venice. They changed their dress, assum-
</p>
<p>ing the guise of various occupations. To avoid all
</p>
<p>appearance of concert, individuals, who spoke differ-
</p>
<p>ent languages, took lodgings together, and all behav-
</p>
<p>ed as though they had no acquaintance with each
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>The five hundred Spaniards who were to have ex-
</p>
<p>ecuted the plot at Crema, which had been discovered,
</p>
<p>were sent, by don Pedro, to the vicinity of Brescia,
</p>
<p>with orders, on receiving intelligence of the success
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy, to take possession of that city, in
</p>
<p>which they were to be assisted by the party formed
</p>
<p>there by the lieutenant of the count of Nassau, and
</p>
<p>yet subsisting. The leader of these Spaniards was
</p>
<p>charged to conduct them directly to Venice, the in-
</p>
<p>stant he received orders from Renault.
</p>
<p>The Venetian fleet had sailed to Dalmatia, but so
</p>
<p>incessant were the movements of the duke of Ossuna,
</p>
<p>that it was kept in constant readiness to put out to
</p>
<p>sea. The captain sent to the officers, who, in his ab-
</p>
<p>sence, commanded his twelve vessels, powerful fire-
</p>
<p>works, to be secretly distributed to the other vessels
</p>
<p>of the fleet, just before the time appointed for the ex-
</p>
<p>ecution of the enterprise. As no one distrusted these
</p>
<p>officers, it was easy for them to do this without being
</p>
<p>discovered or even suspected. He gave orders that
</p>
<p>they should measure the matches so exactly, that, if
</p>
<p>possible, all might explode at the same moment ; that

</p>
<p>then repair immediately to Venice, and be in readi-
</p>
<p>ness to perform whatever might be directed, but
</p>
<p>should wait for further orders before they attempted
</p>
<p>any thing. The Sunday before the feast of Ascen-
</p>
<p>sion, being the first day of the fair, was appointed for
</p>
<p>the execution of the enterprise.
</p>
<p>The Httle squadron of the duke of Ossuna was this
</p>
<p>time so fortunate as to arrive, without any accident,
</p>
<p>within six miles of Venice. To prevent suspicion, it
</p>
<p>sailed in two divisions, one at a little distance from
</p>
<p>the other. The largest was composed of boats like
</p>
<p>those of fishermen j the other of brigantines similar
</p>
<p>to those of the corsairs. On Saturday morning, Hail-
</p>
<p>lot was commanded to leave his station the next day,
</p>
<p>at such time as would enable him to approach within
</p>
<p>sight of Venice between day -light and dark ; to lioist
</p>
<p>the standard of St. Marks, and take possession of sev-
</p>
<p>eral little islands near which he must necessarily pass,

<p>which were entirely defenceless, and from which in^

<p>between which he could pass without injury ; on giv-.

<p>ing notice, by despatching a boat, of his arrival there,

<p>pilots were to be sent to him lest he should run upon

<p>the banks or rocks which render the entrance of the

<p>the captain considered it advisable to confer, for the
</p>
<p>last time, with their companions ; and it was agreed
</p>
<p>that Renault should state to them the situation of af-
</p>
<p>fairs, and give them the necessary directions. Though
</p>
<p>great exertions were made, all could not be collected
</p>
<p>until near night. There were present, at this meet-
</p>
<p>ing, the three Frenchmen who lodged with Renault,
</p>
<p>the lieutenant of the count of Nassau, the three pe-
</p>
<p>tardiers, Langlade, the two officers of the arsenal,
</p>
<p>the captain and the lieutenant who had formerly been
</p>
<p>stationed there, Nolot, the two Brulards, Jaffier, Rob-
</p>
<p>ert, Theodore the Dutchman, the Savoyard who was
</p>
<p>present at the assault of Geneva, and Revellido the
</p>
<p>engineer. These twenty persons, with Renault and
</p>
<p>the captain, having shut themselves up, with all the
</p>
<p>precautions usual at such meetings, in the most se-
</p>
<p>cluded apartment in the house of the courtezan, the
</p>
<p>latter addressed the assembly.
</p>
<p>He began by giving a plain and full account of the
</p>
<p>present state of affairs ; of the forces of the republic,
</p>
<p>and of their own ; of the disposition of the city and
</p>
<p>of the fleet ; of the preparations of don Pedro and of

<p>the duke of Ossuna ; of the arms and other munitions
</p>
<p>of war deposited at the house of the Spanish ambas-
</p>
<p>sador ; of his private understandings with members of
</p>
<p>the senate and many of the nobility ; and, in fine, of
</p>
<p>the precise information they had obtained of whatever
</p>
<p>was necessary to be known. After having gained

<p>effected almost as much by their efforts as his own,
</p>
<p>he proceeded as follows :
</p>
<p>" Such, my companions, are the means destined
</p>
<p>to conduct you to the glory you so ardently seek.
</p>
<p>Every one of you can judge whether th3y may be
</p>
<p>relied on, and are sufficient. The plans we have
</p>
<p>devised will, beyond all question, enable us to intro-
</p>
<p>duce ten thousand soldiers into a city which does not
</p>
<p>contain two hundred to oppose us ; the plunder of
</p>
<p>this city vv^ill attract to our party all the foreigners
</p>
<p>whom curiosity or traffic has brought hither ; and the
</p>
<p>inhabitants themseh'es, the instant they perceive they
</p>
<p>can do it with safety, will assist us to plunder the
</p>
<p>nobles who have plundered them so often. The best
</p>
<p>vessels of the fleet are ours, and the rest carry with-
</p>
<p>in them, at this moment, the means of their own des-
</p>
<p>truction. The arsenal, that famous arsenal, the won-
</p>
<p>der of Europe and the terror of Asia, is even now al-
</p>
<p>most in our power. The nine brave men, who now
</p>
<p>hear me, and who, for six months past, could have
</p>
<p>delivered it to us at a word, have taken such addition-
</p>
<p>al precautions during the delay that has taken place,
</p>
<p>that they are willing to answer, with their lives, for
</p>
<p>its surrender. Even should we not have the troopa
</p>
<p>at the lazaretto, nor those on the main land, nor the
</p>
<p>little fleet of Haillot to support us, nor the five hun-
</p>

</p>
<p>thousand soldiers would be amply sufficient for our
</p>
<p>purpose. And all the different means, which I have
</p>
<p>just enumerated, are disposed in such manner that
</p>
<p>any one may fail us, and the others be left in a state
</p>
<p>to act with undiminished efficiency. All are distinct
</p>
<p>and independent ; each may aid, but cannot injure,
</p>
<p>the others. It is hardly possible that all should fail us,
</p>
<p>and any one is sufficient to ensure success.
</p>
<p>" And if, after taking .all the precautions which hu-
</p>
<p>man wisdom can suggest, we may anticipate what
</p>
<p>success fortune will award us, can we have proofs of
</p>
<p>her favor more explicit than those we have already
</p>
<p>received ? Yes, my friends, they certainly partake of
</p>
<p>the miraculous. In all history, no instance can be
</p>
<p>found in which an enterprise of this kind has been
</p>
<p>partly revealed without being completely defeated.
</p>
<p>Ours has met with five unfavorable incidents, the
</p>
<p>least of which was sufficient, apparently, to ruin it.
</p>
<p>Who could have thought that the affair of Spinosa,
</p>
<p>whose object was the same as ours, would not have
</p>
<p>involved us in ruin ? that the disbanding of the troops
</p>
<p>of Lievestein, who were entirely devoted to us, would
</p>
<p>not have been the means of disclosing our secret ?
</p>
<p>that the dispersion of the little fleet w-ould not have
</p>
<p>deranged all our projects and exposed us to new and
</p>
<p>perplexing inconveniences f that the discovery of the
</p>
<p>plot at Crema, and of that at Marano, w^ould not have
</p>
<p>led necessarily to the discovery of the whole conspi-
</p>
<p>racy ? And yet all these incidents have had no unfa-

</p>
<p>which would have led him to us ; and our enemies
</p>
<p>have derived no advantage from the glimmering

</p>
<p>pose precede an explosion so terrible. The senate,
</p>
<p>we are positively assured, the senate sleeps in perfect
</p>
<p>security. Destiny, auspicious to us, has blinded the
</p>
<p>most penetrating, encouraged the most timid, lulled
</p>
<p>the most suspicious, confounded the most subtle.
</p>
<p>We live yet, my dear friends, we are even stronger
</p>
<p>than before these disasters ; they have served only
</p>
<p>to prove our firmness. We live ; and our lives shall
</p>
<p>soon be fatal to the tyrants of this city.

</p>
<p>the effect of natural causes ? May we not presume
</p>
<p>that it is vouchsafed to us by some power that con-
</p>
<p>trols human affairs ? And in truth, my companions,
</p>
<p>what is there upon the earth that is worthy the pro-
</p>
<p>tection of heaven, if our enterprise is not ? It is our
</p>
<p>purpose to overtlirovv the most detestable of all gov-
</p>
<p>ernments ; to secure to the poor subjects of this state
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of their property, of which, should we

<p>not interfere, the avarice of the nobles would for-
</p>
<p>ever deprive them ; to preserve the honor of every

<p>female endowed with charms to fascinate, wdio would

<p>otherwise be subject to their lawless caprice ; to give

<p>safety to an infinite uumber of miserable beings whom

</p>
<p>This address was heard by the whole assembly
</p>
<p>with that approbation which men generally entertain
</p>
<p>for sentiments congenial with their own. Neverthe-
</p>
<p>less Renault, who observed the countenances of the

<p>audience, remarked that Jaffier, one of the best friends
</p>
<p>of the captain, hacj, after listening attentively, sudden-
</p>
<p>ly displayed extreme finxiety, which he endeavored
</p>
<p>ill vain to conceal ; and that, after the close of the
</p>
<p>address, there still remained upon his countenance
</p>
<p>marks of sadness and terror, indicating emotions of
</p>
<p>horror. Renault spoke of it to the captain, who at

</p>
<p>first did not think it worthy of attention ; but, having
</p>
<p>82 CONSPIRACY OF THE
</p>
<p>observed Jaffier a few moments, he began to enter-
</p>
<p>tain some suspicions and doubts. Renault, who per-
</p>
<p>fectly understood the relations and connection be-
</p>
<p>tween the most secret emotions and the slightest
</p>
<p>outward signs, after further observation and reflec-
</p>
<p>tion, declared explicitly to the captain, that, in his
</p>
<p>opinion, Jaffier was not to be trusted.
</p>
<p>The captain, who knew Jaffier to be one of the
</p>
<p>bravest of men, pronounced this opinion to be unwar-
</p>
<p>ranted and precipitate ; but Renault, convinced of
</p>
<p>its correctness, explained so forcibly the reasons in
</p>
<p>support of it, that, if they did not make the same live-
</p>
<p>ly impression on the mind of the captain, he yet
</p>
<p>thought that his conduct ought to be attentively ob-
</p>
<p>served. He, however, suggested to Renault that,
</p>
<p>even if Jaffier were wavering, which he could not be-
</p>
<p>lieve, there would not be time, before the evening of
</p>
<p>the next day, for him to deliberate and to form the
</p>
<p>resolution to betray them ; at any rate, under present
</p>
<p>circumstances, it was impossible to change their
</p>
<p>measures, and they must unavoidably incur the haz-
</p>
<p>ard which he apprehended, Renault replied, that
</p>
<p>there was one sure way of avoiding it, which was to

<p>over them, even that of life and death ; that it would
</p>
<p>be difficult to convince them of the necessity of sac-
</p>
<p>rificing Jaffier as clearly as they themselves felt it,
</p>
<p>and every conspirator, not perceiving it, would feel
</p>
<p>that his own life was in danger, whenever a similar
</p>
<p>suspicion should enter into the minds of their chiefs ;
</p>
<p>that when the thoughts of men are agitated by their
</p>
<p>rapid approach to the execution of a perilous under-
</p>
<p>taking, a mere trifle is sufficient to change their
</p>
<p>course ; and that, in such a predicament, the slight-
</p>
<p>est alteration is of great importance, for none but
</p>
<p>sudden and violent measures can then be adopted ;
</p>
<p>that, should Jaffier be poniarded, and the manner in
</p>
<p>which he had disappeared be concealed, it was still
</p>
<p>more to be feared that his associates would believe
</p>
<p>that he had been detected, had fled, was a prisoner
</p>
<p>or a traitor ; and that, whatever pretext should be
</p>
<p>invented, his absence, when the enterprise, in which
</p>
<p>so important a part had been assigned to him, was on
</p>
<p>the point of execution, must give rise to discouraging
</p>
<p>reflections.
</p>
<p>While Renault was listening to the discourse of
</p>
<p>the captain, one of their men came to them, bringing
</p>
<p>an order of the senate, which bed just been received,
</p>
<p>that all those attached to the fleet should go on board
</p>
<p>the next morning. At the same time, a letter was
</p>
<p>received from the ambassador, explaining the reason
</p>
<p>of this order. The duke of Ossuna had not been

<p>able to leave Venice to join his fleet without the

<p>84 CONSPIRACY OF THE
</p>
<p>had given orders that, until a certain time, no person
</p>
<p>should be permitted to depart for Venice, and that
</p>
<p>all letters directed to that city should be detained,
</p>
<p>the Venetians had not, until this day, received notice
</p>
<p>of his departure. The archduke, who had just been
</p>
<p>elected king of Bohemia, and a portion of whose sub-
</p>
<p>jects had revolted, had solicited his assistance against
</p>
<p>the rebels ; and the viceroy having boasted that he
</p>
<p>would transport the troops intended for that service,
</p>
<p>by the w^ay of the gulf, near to the ports of the arch-
</p>
<p>duke, in Istria, the Venetians had desired this prince
</p>
<p>to request the viceroy to take another route. But as
</p>
<p>the reasons which govern other men had no influence
</p>
<p>with him, they did not doubt, when they heard he
</p>
<p>had set sail, that his purpose was to conduct the troops
</p>
<p>himself, by the route he had mentioned. As they
</p>
<p>wished to avoid an open rupture, they did not, as
</p>
<p>they might, obstruct his passage ; but determined to
</p>
<p>send their fleet to the coasts of Istria, to observe his
</p>
<p>motions, and protect their maritime possessions from
</p>
<p>any attack which he might be tempted to make.
</p>
<p>The firmest resolutions of men result generally from
</p>
<p>a strong conception of the danger which they have re-
</p>
<p>solved to encounter. By the constant contemplation
</p>
<p>of this danger, the mind becomes familiar w^ith it, and
</p>
<p>with all the circumstances that attend it, however ter-
</p>
<p>rible they may be ; but this firmness of resolution is
</p>
<p>so connected and interwoven with these circumstan-
</p>

<p>pen, on the point of execution, there is great dan-
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 85
</p>
<p>ger that the resolution, however firm before, should
</p>
<p>also change.
</p>
<p>Such an effect Renault and the captain apprehend-
</p>
<p>ed might be produced upon their associates, by the
</p>
<p>unexpected order for the fleet to sail, of which they
</p>
<p>bad just received information. The news distressed
</p>
<p>them exceedingly, for they supposed, at first, that
</p>
<p>they should be compelled, however unpleasant it
</p>
<p>might be, to make some change in the plan of exe-
</p>
<p>cution, which had been agreed on. This plan, it
</p>
<p>was evident, could not be executed immediately, for
</p>
<p>the night was already far advanced, and day light
</p>
<p>would appear before the squadron under Haiilot could
</p>
<p>be brought within cannon shot of Venice, and before
</p>
<p>the troops at the lazaretto could be sent for. Neither
</p>
<p>could it be executed the next day, for if Haiilot
</p>
<p>should then be directed to come up to the city, he
</p>
<p>would inevitably meet people on their way to the
</p>
<p>fleet, which was about to set sail. The departure of
</p>
<p>the fleet was, in fact, an event more favorable to the
</p>
<p>conspirators than any they could have wished for ;
</p>
<p>Haiilot would be left master of the port ; and there-
</p>
<p>fore, all things considered, they determined to defer
</p>
<p>the execution of their design, until some time after
</p>
<p>it had sailed.
</p>
<p>The greatest difficulty was, to decide whether the
</p>
<p>captain, Langlade, the three petardiers, and the oth-
</p>
<p>er conspirators, who were attached to the fleet, should
</p>
<p>obey the orders of the senate. It seemed necessary
</p>
<p>that they, and particularly the captain, should remain

</p>
<p>at Venice ; yet he, of all of them, could least avoid
</p>
<p>obeying. The important command, which he held
</p>
<p>in the fleet, would cause his absence to be remarked
</p>
<p>more than that of all the rest. As most of them
</p>
<p>were attached to his vessels, he might, if present, by
</p>
<p>substituting others, prevent their absence from being
</p>
<p>noticed. It was therefore determined that he should
</p>
<p>go accompanied by Langlade alone, who, as well as
</p>
<p>the three petardiers, acted under the immediate or-
</p>
<p>ders of the admiral ; but, as to the petardiers, the
</p>
<p>conspirators preferred to hazard every thing rather
</p>
<p>than suffer them to depart. The admiral, when he
</p>
<p>first saw the captain, made enquiries concerning
</p>
<p>them ; and the captain replied that he believed that
</p>
<p>they, and other ofScers belonging to his vessels,
</p>
<p>whom he could not find, were concealed at the houses
</p>
<p>of courtesans, and that he had been obliged to leave
</p>
<p>Venice in such haste that he had no time to make
</p>
<p>search for them. The admiral's orders to set sail
</p>
<p>were so peremptory, and his time so much occupied,
</p>
<p>that he could neither despatch men to look for ihem,
</p>
<p>nor wait until they could be found.
</p>
<p>Before he embarked, the captain took Jaffier aside,
</p>
<p>and requested him to take his place by the side of
</p>
<p>Renault, on the night of the execution of the enter-
</p>
<p>prise. He spoke in high terms of the confidence
</p>
<p>they reposed in his courage and address ; he assured
</p>
<p>him that, were it not for this, he should never have
</p>
<p>, consented to go on board the fleet ; but as Jaflier

</p>
<p>was to remain, he felt certain that he should leave
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 87
</p>
<p>with his associates a man equal at least to himself.
</p>
<p>During this conversation, the captain observed him
</p>
<p>attentively ; and he, affected by these expressions of
</p>
<p>esteem and confidence, gave, in his reply, such assu-
</p>
<p>rances of zeal, fidelity and gratitude as would have
</p>
<p>removed all doubt from the most suspicious of men.
</p>
<p>This was the last struggle of his expiring firmness,
</p>
<p>which ceased to exist when his friend disappeared.
</p>
<p>Having no longer before his eyes the only man who
</p>
<p>had influence over him, he abandoned himself entire-
</p>
<p>ly to his irresolution.
</p>
<p>The description which Renault, at the close of his
</p>
<p>address, had given of the night of the execution, had
</p>
<p>affected him to such a degree, that he could not re-
</p>
<p>press his emotions of pity. His imagination rendered
</p>
<p>the picture more vivid. It presented to him, in the
</p>
<p>liveliest colors, the injustice and the cruelties, that,
</p>
<p>on such occasions, must inevitably be committed.
</p>
<p>From that moment, he heard nothing but the cries
</p>
<p>of children trodden to death, the groans of old men
</p>
<p>slaughtered, and the shrieks of women dishonored.
</p>
<p>He saw only palaces demolished, temples on fire, sa-
</p>
<p>cred places polluted with blood. Venice, sorrowing,
</p>
<p>miserable Venice, was constantly before his eyes, not,
</p>
<p>as formerly, triumphant over Ottoman fortune and
</p>
<p>Spanish haughtiness, but in ashes, or in chains, and
</p>
<p>immersed in the blood of her inhabitants more than
</p>
<p>in the waters that surrounded her.

</p>
<p>he would begin lo act in his department. The pilots,
</p>
<p>which had been promised, were sent to Haillot. Men,
</p>
<p>suborned for the purpose, and intimate with those
</p>
<p>who kept guard in the Procuracy of St. Marks, were
</p>
<p>introduced into the belfry, or tower, where the guard
</p>
<p>were stationed ; and, by means of drugs mixed with
</p>
<p>their liquor, which they were persuaded to drink to
</p>
<p>excess on account of the public rejoicings of the day,
</p>
<p>stupified their faculties and caused them to sleep pro-
</p>
<p>foundly. Certain officers were ordered to take pos-
</p>
<p>session of the houses of the senators most to be fear-
</p>
<p>ed, and to kill them. The house which each was to
</p>
<p>attack was designated, and to each of the other offi-
</p>
<p>cers, or chiefs, a particular duty was assigned. Each
</p>
<p>was instructed what number of men he was to com-
</p>
<p>mand, where he would find them, the word by which
</p>
<p>he would know them, and the route by which he
</p>
<p>was to conduct them. The troops at the lazaretto,
</p>
<p>the Spaniards belonging to the squadron, the thou-
</p>
<p>sand Hollanders yet remaining in Venice, were also
</p>
<p>told in what direction they were to leave the square
</p>
<p>of St. Marks which was the general rendezvous, the
</p>
<p>posts they were to seize, the officers appointed to
</p>
<p>command them, and the word by which each might
</p>
<p>be recognised. Men, not liable to suspicion, were
</p>
<p>sent to examine the council barge, and others ascer-
</p>
<p>tained that the artillery was in complete order.

</p>
<p>that ceremony was to be performed. The sight of
</p>
<p>90 CONSPIRACY OF THE
</p>
<p>the public festivities redoubled his compassion ; the
</p>
<p>tranquil enjoyments of the devoted Venetians present-
</p>
<p>ed to his mind, in still stronger colors, their ap-
</p>
<p>proaching desolation ; and he returned from the
</p>
<p>scene more irresolute than ever. In fine, Heaven
</p>
<p>decreed that the work of twelve centuries, and many
</p>
<p>wise patriots, should not be abandoned to the fury of
</p>
<p>a courtesan, and of a band of desperate zealots.
</p>
<p>The guardian genius of the republic suggested to
</p>
<p>Jaffier an expedient by which, as he imagined, he
</p>
<p>might, at the same time, save Venice and his compan-
</p>
<p>ions. He went to Bartholomew Comino, secretary
</p>
<p>of the council often, and told him that he had some-
</p>
<p>thing to reveal, which was of great importance to the
</p>
<p>safety of the republic ; but he required, as a previous
</p>
<p>and indispensable condition, that the doge and the
</p>
<p>council should promise him a favor, and engage, by
</p>
<p>the most sacred oalhs, that their promise should be
</p>
<p>ratified by the senate ; that this favor was the lives of
</p>
<p>twenty-two persons whom he would name, whatever
</p>
<p>crime they might have committed ; and he assured
</p>
<p>him that they need not hope, without granting this
</p>
<p>favor, to force his secret from him, for no tortures,
</p>
<p>however horrible, could oblige him to utter a word.
</p>
<p>The Ten and the doge were instantly assembled ;
</p>
<p>they did not hesitate to make the promise exacted by
</p>
<p>Jaffier ; and he, well satisfied with the course he
</p>
<p>was pursuing, disclosed to them the whole conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The disclosure appeared to them so incredible and

<p>so horrible, that they could not believe it. Never-

</p>
<p>theless, as it was easy to ascertain the truth, they
</p>
<p>despatched Comino to the belfry of the Procuracy.
</p>
<p>He returned with intelligence that all the guard were
</p>
<p>intoxicated or asleep. He was then sent to the ar-
</p>
<p>senal. He sought a long time for the officers ; but
</p>
<p>at length a servant, terrified by his threats, showed
</p>
<p>him a small door, which, after knocking in vain sev-
</p>
<p>eral times, he forced open. He found them with the
</p>
<p>three petardiers, who were engaged in finishing the
</p>
<p>fire-works to be used by the conspirators. He ask-
</p>
<p>ed them what induced them to labor on such a day
</p>
<p>of rejoicing, and why they did not open the door
</p>
<p>when he knocked. They replied, with much inge-
</p>
<p>nuity, that the petardiers were obliged to set out, the
</p>
<p>next day, to join the fleet ; that the admiral had or-
</p>
<p>dered them to carry on board a quantity of fire-works
</p>
<p>ready for use ; that, not having so many prepared as
</p>
<p>he required, they had requested the others to assist
</p>
<p>them ; that as it might be of great importance that
</p>
<p>the fire-works should be finished, they thought it their
</p>
<p>duty to abstain from partaking of the public festivi-
</p>
<p>ties ; and that, to avoid scandal, they had shut them-
</p>
<p>selves up, as he had found them, in the most private
</p>
<p>apartment of the arsenal. To this answer Comino
</p>
<p>could make no reply, but he arrested them.
</p>
<p>The Ten, more and more alarmed, sent immedi-
</p>
<p>ately to the residence of the Greek courtesan, but
</p>
<p>there they found no one. The men who had admin-

<p>Comino entered, feigned to be asleep like the others ;

</p>
<p>but the instant he departed, they hastened to her
</p>
<p>house, and gave the alarm. Without losing a mo-
</p>
<p>ment, Nolot, Robert, Revellido, Villa-mezzana, Du-
</p>
<p>rand, Ternon, and Robert Brulard, who happened to
</p>
<p>be there, leaped into one of the boats, which had
</p>
<p>been procured to bring the troops from the lazaretto,
</p>
<p>and fled safely from Venice.
</p>
<p>Chagrined at their escape, the Council resolved
</p>
<p>to visit immediately the houses of the ambassadors of
</p>
<p>France and Spain. Entrance was civilly demanded,
</p>
<p>on business which concerned the safety of the repub-
</p>
<p>lic. The French ambassador cheerfully admitted
</p>
<p>them ; and Renault, Laurent Brulard, and de Bribe
</p>
<p>were arrested. But the Spanish ambassador angrily
</p>
<p>refused. He claimed all the privileges of his station,
</p>
<p>and when they entered forcibly he protested with
</p>
<p>spirit against the violence they committed. They
</p>
<p>found in his house arms for more than five hundred
</p>
<p>men, sixty petards, an immense quantity of powder,
</p>
<p>artificial fire-works, and other things of a similar na-
</p>
<p>ture. Of all an exact inventory was taken which he
</p>
<p>sportingly and jeeringly assisted to draw up.
</p>
<p>Before this inventory was transmitted to the coun-
</p>
<p>cil, a nobleman of the house of Valiera arrived with
</p>
<p>Brainville and Theodore, two of the principal conspi-
</p>
<p>rators. They had just heard that all was discovered ;
</p>
<p>and that the gates of the city had been closed imme-
</p>
<p>diately after the flight of the courtesan. Having,
</p>
<p>therefore, no hope of escape, they resolved to display

<p>their willingness to reveal the conspiracy, and waited
</p>
<p>SPANIARDS AGAINST VENICE. 93
</p>
<p>upon this nobleman, whom they had known in Flan-
</p>
<p>ders, and desired him to conduct them to the council
</p>
<p>often, where they were arrested. In the meantime,
</p>
<p>all the boarding houses, taverns, houses of ill fame,
</p>
<p>and other places where foreigners would be likely to
</p>
<p>conceal themselves, were visited ; and all the Dutch,
</p>
<p>French, Spanish, Walloon, Neapolitan, and Milanese
</p>
<p>officers were arrested, amounting, in the whole, to
</p>
<p>near five hundred.
</p>
<p>In the midst of these occurrences, two Dauphinese,
</p>
<p>coming from Orange, presented themselves to the
</p>
<p>council, in boots, as they leaped from the boats that
</p>
<p>brought them. They declared that, having received
</p>
<p>letters from Frenchmen in Venice, stating that, if
</p>
<p>they wished to enrich themselves, they had nothing
</p>
<p>to do but to come to the city immediately, for a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy had been formed, and was just ready to be
</p>
<p>executed, to get possession of the city, and give it up
</p>
<p>to pillage, they had come in great haste, to give infor-
</p>
<p>mation of the plot. They received the thanks of the.
</p>
<p>council, were conducted to convenient lodgings, and
</p>
<p>desired to repose themselves until the senate could
</p>
<p>determine what recompense was due to them.
</p>
<p>In the morning, the senate assembled, and the mar-
</p>
<p>quis of Bedmar demanded an audience. It was
</p>
<p>granted merely fron^ curiosity. The report of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy had spread through the city, and produced
</p>
<p>a frightful agitation. The people, who had heard

<p>that the Spaniards were the authors of it, collected

<p>around the house of the ambassador, determined to

<p>enter it by force ; and they were about to set fire to
</p>
<p>it, when the persons arrived who were to conduct him
</p>
<p>to the audience. The orders they had received be-
</p>
<p>ing announced, the people, presuming the senate
</p>
<p>would inflict an exemplary punishment, permitted
</p>
<p>him to leave his house, but followed, loading him with
</p>
<p>reproaches and imprecations.
</p>
<p>The ambassador, entering the Senate, began by
</p>
<p>complaining indignantly against the violence which
</p>
<p>had been committed in his house contrary to the laws
</p>
<p>of nations; and he threatened so fiercely to be re-
</p>
<p>venged, that he frightened most of the senators, who
</p>
<p>feared that this man still had means, with which they
</p>
<p>were unacquainted, to accomplish his enterprise.
</p>
<p>The doge answered that they would apologise to him
</p>
<p>for this outrage when he, who, being an ambassador,
</p>
<p>ought to be a minister of peace, had given some ac-
</p>
<p>count of the provisions and munitions of war, which
</p>
<p>had been discovered at his house. He replied that
</p>
<p>he was astonished that men, who had the reputation
</p>
<p>of men of sense, should be so disingenuous as to in-
</p>
<p>sult him to his face upon a pretext so gross ; that
</p>
<p>they knew, as well as he^ that the provisions were
</p>
<p>merely deposited in his house for safe keeping, as
</p>
<p>others before had been, to be sent to Naples and the
</p>
<p>Tyrol ; that, in regard to the arms, the whole world
</p>
<p>knew that none were so excellent as those made in
</p>
<p>the cities of the republic ; and, as to the fire-works,
</p>
<p>and other similar things, certain artists of extraordi-
</p>
<p>nary skill having offered him their services, he had

</p>
<p>The doge interrunted him, declaring that these
</p>
<p>artists were wretches, or rather monsters, born for the
</p>
<p>eternal disgrace of mankind ; and presented to him a
</p>
<p>letter of credit for the governor of Milan, which, with
</p>
<p>other letters from the duke of Ossuna, had been found
</p>
<p>among the papers of Renault.
</p>
<p>The ambassador answered that, as to the duke of
</p>
<p>Ossuna, he had already declared that he had no con-
</p>
<p>nection with him, and was not responsible for his con-
</p>
<p>duct ; that, as to the letter of credit, it was true that
</p>
<p>the French ambassador had, a short time ago, recom-
</p>
<p>mended to him a gentleman who, having business of
</p>
<p>his own at Milan, was in need of assistance, and he
</p>
<p>had given him the letter which had just been shown
</p>
<p>to him ; but he was entirely ignorant that the busi-
</p>
<p>ness of this gentleman had the shghtest connection
</p>
<p>with the interests or welfare of the republic.
</p>
<p>The doge, perceiving from these answers that the
</p>
<p>assurance of the ambassador would nevef fail him,
</p>
<p>contented himself with representing to him, in a sol-
</p>
<p>emn and dignified manner, the atrociousness of his
</p>
<p>design, and concluded by declaring that they had not
</p>
<p>the slightest suspicion that he acted with the knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of the king his master. The ambassador reph-
</p>
<p>ed, with all the indignant earnestness of a highmind-
</p>
<p>ed man, when his honor is unjustly attacked, that he
</p>
<p>belonged to a nation, so distinguished for valor and
</p>
<p>prudence, that it need not have recourse to dishon-
</p>
<p>orable acts to destroy its enemies ; that the king his

</p>
<p>find, to vanquish them, by open force, without re-
</p>
<p>sorting to treachery. He then hastily and without
</p>
<p>ceremony left the hall. Those who attended him be-
</p>
<p>sought iiim to repose himself, a short time, in an ad-
</p>
<p>joining apartment, until the senate should have given
</p>
<p>the necessary order for his protection ; and he per-
</p>
<p>mitted them to conduct him where they thought
</p>
<p>proper, making no reply, and trembling with passion.
</p>
<p>While the populace were gathering in the square,
</p>
<p>with the intent to tear him in pieces as soon as the
</p>
<p>senate had dismissed him, a few persons were des-
</p>
<p>patched to his house, who directed his family to go
</p>
<p>on board a vessel in the harbor, and conveyed thither
</p>
<p>his most valuable furniture. They then, returning to
</p>
<p>him, conducted him through secret passages in the
</p>
<p>palace to a brigantine well armed and defended by a
</p>
<p>strong escort. The populace, enraged at his escape,
</p>
<p>made an effigy of him and of the duke of Ossuna,
</p>
<p>and treated them in the same manner they would
</p>
<p>have treated their persons had they fallen into their
</p>
<p>hands.
</p>
<p>Orders, at the same time, were sent to the admiral
</p>
<p>to cause Langlade, the captain James Pierre, and all
</p>
<p>his confidential officers, to be thrown into the sea. As
</p>
<p>it was supposed that they would be on their guard, a
</p>
<p>vessel of a shape and appearance the most uncommon
</p>
<p>in Venice, was selected to carry this order; she was
</p>
<p>equipped like a foreign vessel, and made a long cir-
</p>
<p>cuit that she might approach the fleet in a direction

<p>different from that in which she would naturally have

</p>
<p>come, had she sailed from the city. It was afterwards
</p>
<p>known that the captain had been all night on the
</p>
<p>watch, and that, having seen this vessel arrive, he
</p>
<p>immediately repaired to his principal ship, as if he
</p>
<p>had apprehended the truth, and had resolved to make
</p>
<p>preparations to defend himself in case he was betray-
</p>
<p>ed. But probably the fear of ruining his enterprise,
</p>
<p>by an apprehension which might be groundless, kept
</p>
<p>him some time in deliberation what course to pursue ;
</p>
<p>for the admiral, who lost not a moment, sent two men
</p>
<p>on whom he could rely, who, concealing their arms,
</p>
<p>boarded his vessel and finding him alone, accosted
</p>
<p>him with their usual frankness, stabbed him instantly
</p>
<p>and cast him into the sea, without being seen by any
</p>
<p>one. Langlade and forty of his officers were treated
</p>
<p>in the same manner and with the same secrecy.
</p>
<p>Renault, when interrogated at Venice, replied that
</p>
<p>he knew nothing in relation to the enquiries made of
</p>
<p>him. They showed him the letter of credit for don
</p>
<p>Pedro, a passport in Spanish for all the dependencies
</p>
<p>of Spain, bills of exchange for large sums, and a
</p>
<p>thousand pistoles in gold. He answered that he was
</p>
<p>not acquainted, either whh the Spanish ambassador or
</p>
<p>the governor of Milan ; that^ therefore, if any thing,
</p>
<p>which had reference to them, had been found among
</p>
<p>his papers, it must have been placed there by oth-
</p>
<p>ers ; and that, in regard to the bills of exchange
</p>
<p>and the gold, they were all the property he had in the
</p>
<p>world. He was put to the torture ordinary and extra-
</p>

<p>was a poor old man, honest, noble, and honorable,
</p>
<p>and God would avenge him. On several successive
</p>
<p>days, the instruments of torture were displayed be-
</p>
<p>fore him, and he was even promised impunity if he
</p>
<p>would relate all he knew, but in vain : and, after
</p>
<p>having, at different times, been tortured in every
</p>
<p>mode that could be devised, he was strangled in pris-
</p>
<p>on, and hung up in public, by one of his feet, as a
</p>
<p>traitor. The lieutenant of the count of Nassau, the
</p>
<p>three petardiers, Bribe, Laurent Brulard, and the two
</p>
<p>officers of the arsenal, were also strangled, after hav-
</p>
<p>ing endured the torture with equal constancy ; but
</p>
<p>Brainville, Theodore, and upwards of three hundred
</p>
<p>officers were, without suffering the torture, privately
</p>
<p>strangled or drowned.
</p>
<p>In the meantime Jaffier, rendered miserable by the
</p>
<p>cruel effects of his compassion, complained loudly
</p>
<p>that the doge and the council had not kept the prom-
</p>
<p>ise they had made him in favor of his companions.
</p>
<p>This promise had not been violated until after mature

</p>
<p>had a knowledge of the conspiracy been obtained
</p>
<p>from Jaffier only, but the two Dauphinese, who had
</p>
<p>also disclosed it, invested the senate with full right to
</p>
<p>act as though Jaffier had disclosed nothing. This

<p>opinion, supported by the general horror and conster-

</p>
<p>To appease Jaffier, every expedient was resorted to.
</p>
<p>He was urged to accept of money and employment.
</p>
<p>He refused every thing, and persisted in demanding,
</p>
<p>though in vain, the lives of his friends ; and after their
</p>
<p>execution he left Venice inconsolable. The senate,
</p>
<p>when informed of his departure, sent him an order to
</p>
<p>quit the territories of the republic, in three days, un-
</p>
<p>der pain of death, and four thousand sequins, which
</p>
<p>he was compelled to receive. The pity which he
</p>
<p>felt for his friends redoubled whenever he reflected
</p>
<p>that he had been the cause of their death. He ascer-
</p>
<p>tained, after leaving the city, that the enterprise against
</p>
<p>Brescia might yet be prosecuted successfully. His
</p>
<p>desire of vengeance impelled him to throw himself in-
</p>
<p>to that city. But he had scarcely entered it, when
</p>
<p>the ten, having gained knowledge of the project from
</p>
<p>the papers of the conspirators^ despatched thither a
</p>
<p>body of troops, who took possession of the principal
</p>
<p>posts, and put to the sword several Spaniards who had
</p>
<p>been admitted within the walls. Jaffier was taken
</p>
<p>fighting at their head like a man who sought only to
</p>
<p>sell his life dearly ; and being brought to Venice, a
</p>
<p>few days afterwards, was drowned the next day after

<p>his arrivals

<p>The death of this miserable man having restored

<p>tranquillity to this great city, the senate immediately

<p>ance, which were almost wholly comprised in two
</p>
<p>particulars.
</p>
<p>The first was, that the new ambassador should, on
</p>
<p>every occasion, loudly and explicitly censure the con-
</p>
<p>duct of his predecessor, and should take pains, even in
</p>
<p>the most trivial matters, to exhibit a totally different
</p>
<p>demeanor. The other was, that, in all his negotia-
</p>
<p>tions concerning the rights and pretensions of the re-
</p>
<p>public, he should consuh, as his only guide, the Squit--
</p>
<p>iinio della Liherta Veneta, to which the marquis oft-
</p>
<p>en refers, in terms which, though cautiously expres-
</p>
<p>sed, discover his paternal affection for this work.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, proclamation was made, in all the
</p>
<p>dependencies of the republic, that no one, under pain
</p>
<p>of death, should impute to the king of Spain, nor to
</p>
<p>the Spaniards, any participation in the conspiracy ;

</p>
<p>The history of the Conspiracy of John Lewis Fies-
</p>
<p>CO against Genoa was written, in his youth, by the cel-
</p>
<p>ebrated cardinal De Retz. It displays such high admi-
</p>
<p>ration of Fiesco and his enterprise, that, on perusing it,
</p>
<p>cardinal Richelieu, then first minister of France, pre-
</p>
<p>dicted that the young ecclesiastic would be a turbu-
</p>
<p>lent and dangerous character. It is well known that
</p>
<p>afterwards, when archbishop of Paris, he acted a
</p>
<p>conspicuous part in the insurrection of the Fronde,

<p>The reflections interspersed are characteristic of the

<p>CONSPIRACY,
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year 1547, the condition
</p>
<p>of the republic of Genoa might have been called for-
</p>
<p>tunate, had it been more firmly established. She
</p>
<p>enjoyed, in appearance, an honorable tranquillity, ob-
</p>
<p>tained by her own arms, and secured by those of
</p>
<p>Charles V, whom she had chosen protector of her
</p>
<p>liberties. The weakness of her enemies relieved her
</p>
<p>from all fear of their ambitious designs ; and peace
</p>
<p>brought back into her borders that abundance which
</p>
<p>war had for a long time banished ; her trade revived
</p>
<p>to the visible advantage of the pubhc and of individu-
</p>
<p>als ; and, had her citizens been as contented as their
</p>
<p>condition w^as fortunate, this republic, in a short time,
</p>
<p>would, in the enjoyment of a profitable and happy re-
</p>
<p>pose, have recovered all she had lost. But divisions
</p>
<p>still existed among them, and the seeds of hatred,
</p>
<p>which previous quarrels had sown in their hearts,
</p>
<p>were dangerous relics, evincing too plainly that the
</p>
<p>body politic was not yet relieved from its maladies 5

<p>apparent health of bloated countenances, in whose
</p>
<p>flesh fester a multitude of peccant humors. The no-
</p>
<p>bility, who administered the government, could not
</p>
<p>forget the injuries which, when banished from power,
</p>
<p>they had received from the people. The people, on
</p>
<p>their part, regarded the domination of the nobility,
</p>
<p>as a new tyranny, subversive of the constitution of
</p>
<p>the republic. A portion even of the gentlemen, who
</p>
<p>aspired to a higher rank, did not disguise their envy
</p>
<p>of those above them. Those in authority ruled with
</p>
<p>insolence ; those in subjection obeyed with indigna-
</p>
<p>tion ; and many imagined they obeyed because they
</p>
<p>could not rule with absolute sway. At this period,
</p>
<p>by the permission of Providence, an event occurred
</p>
<p>which, at once, confined forever the nobility in power
</p>
<p>and the people in servitude.
</p>
<p>This event was the conspiracy of John Lewis Fies-
</p>
<p>CO, count of Lavagna, a history of which will be ven^
</p>
<p>dered more intelligible and interesting by a relation
</p>
<p>of the events and circumstances which preceded and
</p>
<p>occasioned it.
</p>
<p>At the time of those memorable wars, in which the
</p>
<p>emperor, Charles V, and Francis I, of France, deso-
</p>
<p>lated Italy, Andrew Doria, descended from one of
</p>
<p>the most illustrious families of Genoa, and the great-
</p>
<p>est naval commander of the age, supported with zeal
</p>
<p>the cause of France, and sustained upon the sea the
</p>
<p>reputation of that crown, with a courage and good
</p>
<p>fortune, which redounded as much to the advantage

</p>
<p>frequently the fault of the greatest princes, that they
</p>
<p>do not treat with sufficient regard the nien they em-
</p>
<p>ploy, when they once consider themselves sure of
</p>
<p>their fidelity. It was for this reason that France lost
</p>
<p>the services of an able and important officer, and the
</p>
<p>loss produced such disastrous consequences that it
</p>
<p>will never be recollected without sorrow.
</p>
<p>At the time when Doria was engaged, on terms
</p>
<p>highly advantageous to him, in the service of the
</p>
<p>king, as admiral of his gallies, those who were high in
</p>
<p>favor at courts and filled the principal seats in the
</p>
<p>councils of the kingdom, began to envy his glory, and
</p>
<p>to covet his station ; and they resolved to ruin the
</p>
<p>man whom they saw too powerful to court the favor
</p>
<p>of any one but his master. Knowing that it would
</p>
<p>not, at first, be either safe, or useful to their design,
</p>
<p>to speak of him unfavorably to the king, whose friend-
</p>
<p>ship was too strong to be suddenly changed to enmi-
</p>
<p>ty, they pursued a more artful course ; and, uniting
</p>
<p>with the public in applauding the first services that
</p>
<p>he rendered to France, they resolved to give him
</p>
<p>causes of dissatisfaction, which might be attributed to
</p>
<p>the necessities of the nation rather than to their par-
</p>
<p>ticular enmity, and which would, nevertheless, pro-
</p>
<p>duce the effect they desired. They sought opportu-
</p>
<p>nities of eliciting complaints from this proud and arro-
</p>
<p>gant hero, that they might the more easily ruin him
</p>
<p>in the opinion of the king ; and his own affairs were
</p>
<p>so often discussed in the council, that they, enjoying

<p>of displeasing him. Sometimes the finances were too

<p>much exhausted to pay his exorbitant salary ; some-
</p>
<p>times they paid him in depreciated paper ; some-
</p>
<p>times his demands were decided to be unreasonable
</p>
<p>and unjust. At length the remonstrances, drawn

<p>artifices of his enemies, represented as disrespectful
</p>
<p>to the king, who became weary and dissatisfied, and
</p>
<p>was, by degrees, induced to consider him a selfish,
</p>
<p>insolent, and intractable man. At last, they openly
</p>
<p>offended him, by refusing to pay him the ransom of
</p>
<p>his prisoner, the prince of Orange, whom his nephew,
</p>
<p>Phihppin Doria, had taken before Naples, and whom,
</p>
<p>upon the order of the king, he had delivered into his
</p>
<p>hands. They demanded, and enforced their demand
</p>
<p>with threats, that he should also deliver up the mar-
</p>
<p>quis del Guasto and Ascanio Colonna, who had been
</p>
<p>made prisoners in the same battle. They neglected
</p>
<p>to perform the promise they had made him to restore
</p>
<p>Savona to the republic : and as, instead of conceal-
</p>
<p>ing his resentment under the appearance of modera-
</p>
<p>tion, he manifested it openly, his enemies omitted no
</p>
<p>opportunity of inflaming it. M. de Barbezieux jwcas
</p>
<p>ordered to take possession of his gallies, and even to
</p>
<p>arrest him if he should find it practicable. This
</p>
<p>course of proceeding was not only contrary to good
</p>
<p>faith but to the dictates of worldly prudence ; and
</p>
<p>the ministers of France cannot be too severely cen-
</p>
<p>sured for having preferred their own interests to

</p>
<p>service the only man who could sustain his cause in
</p>
<p>Italy. It may also be said that, having determined
</p>
<p>to ruin him, they ought to have done it at once and
</p>
<p>completely, and not have left him in a condition to
</p>
<p>inflict essential injury, not only upon France, but also
</p>
<p>upon themselves, by giving the king good reason to
</p>
<p>feel dissatisfied with their counsels, which were the
</p>
<p>source of such disasters to his kingdom.
</p>
<p>Doria, seeing himself thus treated as a criminal,
</p>
<p>made known his complaints, in a public manifesto,
</p>
<p>and declared that he was not so sensibly affected by
</p>
<p>his private wrongs, as by the injustice of the king in
</p>
<p>refusing to restore, as he had often promised, the city
</p>
<p>ofSavona to his dear country. He made an agree-
</p>
<p>ment himself with the marquis del Guasto, his prison-
</p>
<p>er, declared himself for ,the emperor, and accepted
</p>
<p>the command of his fleet. The conduct of tliis old
</p>
<p>politician was as malicious, at least, as that of the
</p>
<p>ministers of France, but was much more crafty and
</p>
<p>judicious. He cannot be exonerated from tlje charge
</p>
<p>of great ingratitude, for resolving, in a moment of
</p>
<p>anger, to be revenged on a prince to whom, it may be
</p>
<p>said, he was indebted for all his glory, as he had ob-
</p>
<p>tained his most brilliant testimonials of honor, in the
</p>
<p>command of his forces; and it is difficult to justify
</p>
<p>the treachery, base and unworthy his former actions,
</p>
<p>of which he was guilty, when he, at a time when he
</p>
<p>professed a desire to remain in the service of the

<p>king, directed Phillippin Doria, his lieutenant, to per-
</p>

<p>then closely beseiged by Mons. de Lautrec. But it
</p>
<p>must also be acknowledged that his conduct entitles
</p>
<p>him to a high rank in that class of politicians who are
</p>
<p>governed wholly by self interest ; for he exhibited
</p>
<p>such address in arraying appearances on his side, that
</p>
<p>his friends might speciously assign the king's breach
</p>
<p>of faith, in regard to his country, as the real cause of
</p>
<p>his change of party ; and his enemies could not deny
</p>
<p>that the treatment he had received had been extreme-
</p>
<p>ly harsh and difficult to be endured ; and moreover
</p>
<p>he well knew that the secret means of obtaining a
</p>
<p>high consideration in a party is to render it, at the
</p>
<p>time of joining it, an important service. In fact, he
</p>
<p>chose his time so judiciously, and conducted his re-
</p>
<p>volt so skilfully, that he preserved Naples for the em-
</p>
<p>peror, which the French, had Philippin Doria con-
</p>
<p>tinued to serve them faithfully, would, in a few days,
</p>
<p>have wrested from him. His change of party occa-
</p>
<p>sioned the ruin of one of the greatest captains that
</p>
<p>France ever produced, and, in the sequel, placed the
</p>
<p>republic of Genoa under the protection of S[)ain, to
</p>
<p>w^hich nation, she is, on account of her dominions in
</p>
<p>Italy, of va'^Jt importance ; and this was the first ser-
</p>
<p>vice which Andrew Doria rendered to the emperor
</p>
<p>after he had explicitly declaied against the king.
</p>
<p>This artful and ambitious man, who was well ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with all tlie intrigues, and the inclinations of
</p>
<p>the Genoese, found no difficulty in managing a people
</p>
<p>who have always been accused of a love of novelty.

</p>
<p>partisans, who gave him an account of all that happen-
</p>
<p>ed, he took pains to exasperate the disconten^ted, to
</p>
<p>create dissatisfaction in the minds of others, and to
</p>
<p>convince all that the French, retaining the whole
</p>
<p>power in their own hands, left to the Genoese only
</p>
<p>the shadow of sovereignty ; he held up to the view of
</p>
<p>the nobles, the image of the ancient government,
</p>
<p>which was placed entirely in their hands ; and, in
</p>
<p>fine, he intimated to all classes that a revolution would
</p>
<p>produce a general improvement of affairs.
</p>
<p>His party being formed, he drew near to Genoa
</p>
<p>with his gallies, landed, and, without meeting any re-
</p>
<p>sistance, placed his troops in battle array. He then
</p>
<p>marched into the city, followed by those of his own
</p>
<p>party who had taken arms on a concerted signal. He
</p>
<p>took possession of the principal posts, and became

<p>master of ihe city almost without drawing his sword.
</p>
<p>Theodore Trivulcius, who commanded for the king

<p>to crush the intrigues which, previous to the surren-

</p>
<p>and contrary to those manifested by the public ; and
</p>
<p>the majority, as is generally the case, welcoming the
</p>
<p>new state of things for tlie sole reason of their novelty.
</p>
<p>Doria, without suffering this ardor to cool, assem-
</p>
<p>bled the nobility, committed the government to their
</p>
<p>hands, and, protesting that he claimed no higher au-
</p>
<p>thority than any other gentleman, prescribed himself
</p>
<p>a constitution for the republic. Then, after receiving
</p>
<p>all imaginable demonstrations of the gratitude of his
</p>
<p>fellow citizens, he retired to his palace to enjoy, in re-
</p>
<p>pose, the fruit of his past labors ; and the republic
</p>
<p>erected to his honor a statue inscribed. To the Father
</p>
<p>of his Country and the Restorer of Liberty,
</p>
<p>There are many who think that Doria had fully
</p>
<p>satisfied his ambition in restoring liberty to his coun-
</p>
<p>try ; and that the general applause he received rath-
</p>
<p>er inspired him with the thought of enjoying in tran-
</p>
<p>quillity the glory he had acquired, than of taking ad-
</p>
<p>vantage of it to accomplish more elevated designs.
</p>
<p>Others cannot imagine that the important office which
</p>
<p>he had just accepted in the service of the emperor,
</p>
<p>and the pains he had taken to attach the nobility of
</p>
<p>Genoa to his family, could have proceeded from a
</p>
<p>disposition solicitous of repose, and entirely uninflu-
</p>
<p>enced by self interest. They believe that he had too
</p>
<p>much discernment not to be aware that a sovereign in

<p>Genoa could not possibly continue on friendly terms

<p>with the court of Spain, and that he intended merely
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 113
</p>
<p>to amuse that power by exhibiting an apparent mod-
</p>
<p>eration, and to defer his ambitious projects to a more
</p>
<p>favorable season.
</p>
<p>His advanced age might, however, have diminished
</p>
<p>the apprehension which they entertained of the au-
</p>
<p>thority he exercised, had they not perceived a second
</p>
<p>self in possession of authority almost equal to his own.
</p>
<p>Giannetino Doria, his cousin and adopted son, then
</p>
<p>about twenty-eight years of age, was extremely vain,
</p>
<p>haughty, and overbearing. All the offices which
</p>
<p>Andrew held would be transmitted by inheritance to
</p>
<p>him ; and the nobility of Genoa were, for this reason,
</p>
<p>attached to his interests. His style of living was
</p>
<p>more splendid than that of a citizen unwilling to at-
</p>
<p>tract the envy of others, or to arouse the jealousy of
</p>
<p>republicans. He did not even conceal his contempt
</p>
<p>of those of noble birth. The extraordinary exalta-
</p>
<p>tion of this family produced the great commotion
</p>
<p>which will now be described, and gave to all nations a
</p>
<p>memorable admonition not to permit any individual
</p>
<p>to become so eminent as to inspire in others a wish
</p>
<p>to humble him, and afford a pretext for undertaking it.

<p>John Lewis Fiesco, count of Lavagna, descended

<p>from the most ancient and illustrious family in Ge-
</p>
<p>noa, enjoying an annual income of more than two

<p>hundred thousand crowns, tjenty-tvvo years of age,
</p>
<p>endowed with every pleasing and noble faculty, am-

</p>
<p>with no opportunity of acquiring it, he was continual-
</p>
<p>ly meditating upon the means of creating such op-
</p>
<p>portunity. But, ahhough, at that time, the state of
</p>
<p>affairs afforded him none, he yet might have expect-
</p>
<p>ed that his talents would, at some futute time, open to
</p>
<p>him the way to the glory he coveted, in serving his
</p>
<p>country, had the extraordinary power of Giannetino
</p>
<p>Doria, of which we have just spoken, permitted him
</p>
<p>to hope for employment ; but, as he was too illustri-
</p>
<p>ous by his birth, and too highly esteemed for his
</p>
<p>good qualities, not to excite the apprehension of the
</p>
<p>man who wished to enjoy all the reputation, and com-
</p>
<p>mand all the force of the republic, he was convinc-
</p>
<p>ed that he could have no well founded hope, where
</p>
<p>his rival was almost omnipotent ; for nothing is more
</p>
<p>certain than that those who, in the highest stations,
</p>
<p>regard others with jealousy, never think of them but
</p>
<p>with a wish to effect their ruin. Aware, therefore,
</p>
<p>that he had every thing to apprehend from the eleva-
</p>
<p>tion of Doria, and that he could have no hope of per-
</p>
<p>sonal advancement, he feh impelled to endeavor, by
</p>
<p>his courage and address, to prevent the ill consequen-
</p>
<p>ces of that grandeur which eclipsed his own; well
</p>
<p>knowing that nothing is ever to be expected from
</p>
<p>those who impress others with fear, but an excessive
</p>
<p>distrust of all who are capable of rising by their own
</p>
<p>merit, and incessant endeavors to impede their pro-

<p>gress.

</p>
<p>ing to eminence in the service of his country, he con-
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 115
</p>
<p>ceived the design of humbling the family of Doria,
</p>
<p>before it had become more firmly established ; and
</p>
<p>as that family was identified with the government of
</p>
<p>the republic, he resolved to effect the ruin of the one
</p>
<p>by a rev^olution in the other.
</p>
<p>Great rivers never do any damage when nothing
</p>
<p>interrupts their course ; but, meeting the slightest ob-
</p>
<p>stacle, they rage with violence, and an inconsidera-
</p>
<p>ble bank often causes them to overflow and drown
</p>
<p>those fields which otherwise they would have render-
</p>
<p>ed fertile. And thus it is reasonable to suppose that
</p>
<p>if the ambition of Fiesco had not found the career of
</p>
<p>glory preoccupied by the Dorias, he would never
</p>
<p>have transgressed the bounds of moderation and duty,
</p>
<p>but would have devoted to the service of the repub-
</p>
<p>lic those talents which almost effected its ruin.
</p>
<p>These ambitious purposes of the count were en-
</p>
<p>couraged by the representations of many, who ex-
</p>
<p>pected to derive personal advantages from the public
</p>
<p>disorders ; and more especially by the pressing so-
</p>
<p>licitations of the French, who addressed to him many
</p>
<p>arguments, and made him considerable offers, at first
</p>
<p>by the medium of Caesar Fregosa and Canino Gon-
</p>
<p>zague, and afterwards of Mons. du Bellai, who held
</p>
<p>secret conferences with him by the intervention of Pe-
</p>
<p>ter Luke Fiesco.
</p>
<p>It was generally believed, at that time, that Pope

</p>
<p>ful, of an able partisan in Italy, had labored assidu-
</p>
<p>ously to inflame the ambition of Fiasco, and had pre-
</p>
<p>sented to him the strongest inducements to undertake
</p>
<p>his designs against Genoa.
</p>
<p>No flattery is so grateful to a man of spirit, and
</p>
<p>nothing impels him to such perilous enterprises, as to
</p>
<p>be courted by persons greatly superior to others in
</p>
<p>dignity or reputation. This mark of their esteem in-
</p>
<p>spires him with high confidence in himself, and per-
</p>
<p>suades him that he is capable of conducting success-
</p>
<p>fully the most important affairs. The project which
</p>
<p>Fiesco had conceived was thus made to appeap to
</p>
<p>him glorious and easy to be executed ; for he was
</p>
<p>urged to undertake it by the greatest prince in Eu-
</p>
<p>rope, and by the ablest statesman of the age. The
</p>
<p>one was Francis I, who directed Peter Strozzi, when
</p>
<p>passing, with his troops, over the mountains near Ge-
</p>
<p>noa, to convey to him his wishes ; and the other
</p>
<p>was cardinal Augustine Trivulcius, protector of
</p>
<p>France at the court of Rome, from whom he receiv-
</p>
<p>ed all imaginable honors, when, apparently for the
</p>
<p>gratification of his curiosity, but in reality to commu-
</p>
<p>nicate his design to the Pope and ascertain his senti-
</p>
<p>ments, he visited that city.
</p>
<p>The Cardinal, whose reputation was then at its
</p>
<p>height, and who was considered a very sagacious
</p>
<p>politician, succeeded in inflaming the ambition of Fi-
</p>
<p>esco, a passion which naturally had too much domin-
</p>
<p>ion over him. He exhibited to him, in the manner

<p>best calculated to excite his jealousy, the present

</p>
<p>greatness of Giannetino Doria, and the future great-
</p>
<p>ness he was endeavoring to secure by the connections
</p>
<p>he was forming ; and;, augmenting thus the envy
</p>
<p>which the former, and the apprehension which the
</p>
<p>latter excited, he insinuated that it must be intolera-
</p>
<p>ble to a man of spirit to live in a republic where the
</p>
<p>career of honor was closed against him, and where
</p>
<p>noble birth and exalted merit gave him no advantage
</p>
<p>above ordinary men.
</p>
<p>After he had confirmed him in his purpose, he offer-
</p>
<p>ed him, on the part of France, all the aid he might
</p>
<p>desire. His urgent representations had such effect
</p>
<p>upon a mind already inclined to yield, that the count,
</p>
<p>at length, with evident satisfaction, ^ expressed an in-
</p>
<p>tention of accepting the command of six gallies in the
</p>
<p>service of the king, of two hundred men of the garri-
</p>
<p>son of Montobio, of a company of infantry, and a
</p>
<p>pension of twelve thousand crowns, declaring, never-
</p>
<p>theless, that he would not give a definite answer until
</p>
<p>after his return to Genoa. So true it is, that, in af-
</p>
<p>fairs of importance, nothing is more difficult than to
</p>
<p>form, at once, a decisive resolution ; a multitude of
</p>
<p>considerations, each balancing another, crowd togeth-
</p>
<p>er into the mind, and give rise to the fear that suffi-
</p>
<p>cient time has not been devoted to deliberation.
</p>
<p>Extraordinary actions resemble explosions of thun^-
</p>

<p>er. When there is nothing but a mass of vapors, a
</p>
<p>118 CONSPIRACY OF FIESCO
</p>
<p>low sound only is produced, which, far from terrify-
</p>
<p>ing, is scarcely heard. It is thus vvith resolutions in
</p>
<p>great affairs. When they enter at once into the
</p>
<p>mind, and meet only vvith feeble resistance, it is an
</p>
<p>infallible sign that they make only a shght and tran-
</p>
<p>sient impression, which may indeed occasion some
</p>
<p>agitation, but will never produce any important ef-
</p>
<p>fect.
</p>
<p>It cannot justly be denied that Fiesco had reflect-
</p>
<p>ed materially upon the project which he was desirous
</p>
<p>of undertaking ; for, after his return to Genoa, anx-
</p>
<p>ious as he was to execute it, he hesitated, a long time,
</p>
<p>in determining which of the various routes, leading
</p>
<p>to his object, he should select. Sometimes the offer-
</p>
<p>ed aid of a powerful king inclined him to adopt the
</p>
<p>resolution of throwing himself into the arms of the
</p>
<p>French ; at other times, the distrust of foreigners,
</p>
<p>which all naturally feel, joined to certain aspirations
</p>
<p>of glory, which impel a man to reject all participation
</p>
<p>of others in the brilliant actions he intends to perform,
</p>
<p>iliclined him to hope that he might find, in his own
</p>
<p>resources, means bearing some proportion to his great
</p>
<p>designs ; and perhaps these different reflections would
</p>
<p>have long agitated his bosom, and occasioned consid-
</p>
<p>erable delay, had he not daily had new and just cau--
</p>
<p>ses of indignation at the insupportable arrogance of
</p>
<p>Giannetino Doria, who, in addition to his general in-
</p>
<p>solence of behaviour, treated the count, after his re-

<p>fatal blow, have censured this conduct of the count as
</p>
<p>injudicious. But it must be acknowledged that, if his
</p>
<p>prudence failed him, on this occasion, it is a fault to
</p>
<p>which lofty natures are liable. Contemptuous treat-
</p>
<p>ment irritates them so suddenly and so violently that
</p>
<p>they cannot wait to take counsel of their reason, nor
</p>
<p>to acquire the mastery over themselves. This fault
</p>
<p>proves him guiltless, at least, of the charge which
</p>
<p>some historians have made against him, that he was
</p>
<p>naturally of a dark and dissembling temper, more
</p>
<p>covetous than ambitious, and more strongly attached
</p>
<p>to interest than to glory. This warmth, 1 say, which
</p>
<p>his conduct displayed, proves that he was actuated
</p>
<p>by a love of glory, and by a laudable ambition, for
</p>
<p>all, who have embarked in similar designs, from a
</p>
<p>love of domination, and from other views than the ac-
</p>
<p>quisition of honorable fame, have previously submit-
</p>
<p>ted patiently to shameful humiliations.
</p>
<p>It is certain that Giannetino Doria was intolerably
</p>
<p>insolent, and that, in all respects, he followed the
</p>
<p>wicked maxim, that severity and haughtiness are the
</p>
<p>best methods of governing, and that it is useless to
</p>
<p>conciliate by kindness those who may be controlled
</p>
<p>by interest or fear. This conduct, increasing the

</p>
<p>which he had found to destroy him, and afforded
</p>
<p>him the opportunity of making use, to humble him,
</p>
<p>of the effects of that haughtiness with which he en-
</p>
<p>deavored to humble all others.
</p>
<p>The Cardinal Augustine Trivulcius, aware that,
</p>
<p>on such occasions, it is dangerous to give to the zeal
</p>
<p>of young men a time to cool, immediately after the
</p>
<p>count's return to Genoa, despatched Nicholas Foderr
</p>
<p>ato, a gentleman of Savona, and a relation of the fam-
</p>
<p>ily of Fiesco, to obtain his decisive answer. He
</p>
<p>found him more incensed than ever, and easily per-
</p>
<p>suaded him to stipulate whatever he desired. He
</p>
<p>then returned, without delay, to procure the ratifica-
</p>
<p>tion of the treaty by the ministers of the king, who
</p>
<p>were, at that time, at Rome. But having proceed-
</p>
<p>ed thirty or forty leagues, he was overtaken by a
</p>
<p>courier and recalled, the count having reflected that
</p>
<p>he had been too precipitate, and that he ought not
</p>
<p>to have concluded an agreement of that importance
</p>
<p>without haviag conferred with those friends whose
</p>
<p>judgments he confided in. He assembled three of
</p>
<p>them, on whose fidelity he could implicitly rely, and
</p>
<p>whom he highly esteemed for their good qualities ;
</p>
<p>and after having declared that he had resolved to en-
</p>
<p>dure no longer the present government ef the repub-
</p>
<p>lic, he requested their advice upon the subject.

<p>the family, discreet but timid, began his discourse

<p>to use ; and, addressing the count, spoke as follows :
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 121
</p>
<p>** It seems to me that there is much reason to com-
</p>
<p>passionate the misfortune of those who embark in
</p>
<p>important undertakings. They cast tliemselves, as it
</p>
<p>were, upon a tempestuous ocean, where no spot is
</p>
<p>visible that is not marked by a shipwreck. And it
</p>
<p>ought to increase our fears to see young men, whom
</p>
<p>w-e love, exposed to this danger : for they have not
</p>
<p>the strength to encounter the labors of such a voyage,
</p>
<p>nor the experience to avoid the rocks, or steer safely
</p>
<p>to port. All your servants ought to feel a lively in-
</p>
<p>terest in the designs which your courage prompts
</p>
<p>you to undertake. Permit me to say, that this is
</p>
<p>above your age, and the station yi)U occupy. Your
</p>
<p>thoughts are bent on affairs, which require a higher
</p>
<p>consideration in the world than a man of your age,
</p>
<p>however fortunate he may have been, can possibly
</p>
<p>have obtained ; and the design you have formed de-
</p>
<p>mands forces which one of the greatest kings of the
</p>
<p>age has never been able to raise. These thoughts
</p>
<p>arise in your mind from two modes of false reason-
</p>
<p>ing, which ar^, as it were, inherent in the nature of
</p>
<p>man. Himself is apt to engross too much of his
</p>
<p>thoughts ; that is to say, he assumes that he can do,
</p>
<p>whatever his imagination tells him he may do ; and
</p>
<p>he seldom forms a safe judgment of others, because
</p>
<p>he makes himself the criterion by which he judges,
</p>
<p>considering only what they can do, and not what they
</p>
<p>ought nor what their interests may lead them to do.
</p>
<p>The first error is exceedingly dangerous, because, as
</p>
<p>no one can perform an important enterprise aJone,

<p>and as many others must be consulted, it is highly im-
</p>
<p>portant that they also should think it rational and
</p>
<p>practicable 5 otherwise he, who undertakes it, will
</p>
<p>find few friends who are wiUing to follow his fortunes.
</p>
<p>The second error is even more common and not less
</p>
<p>dangerous, because those very persons, from whom
</p>
<p>much assistance is anticipated, are often found to
</p>
<p>make the strongest opposition. Be careful, there*
</p>
<p>fore, that the great talents which nature has given
</p>
<p>you, and which you may, perhaps justly, imagine will
</p>
<p>supply the deficiency of experience, do not betray
</p>
<p>you into the first error ; and consider that, brilliant
</p>
<p>as they are, they may not produce, in the minds even
</p>
<p>of those best disposed to serve you, that strength of
</p>
<p>attachment ;which will be necessary for the execution
</p>
<p>of an enterprise so diflicult and dangerous. And it
</p>
<p>is still more unlikely that they should so dazzle your
</p>
<p>enemies, as to prevent them from making use, with
</p>
<p>effect, of the pretence that you are yet a young man-
</p>
<p>Be careful, also, that your illustrious birth, and the
</p>
<p>reputation which you have acquired by your good
</p>
<p>qualities ; that your immense wealth and the secret
</p>
<p>understandings which you, perhaps, have entered in-
</p>
<p>to, do not betray you into the second error, and in-
</p>
<p>duce you to believe that those who have promised to
</p>
<p>assist you will not desert you in time of need. Dis-
</p>
<p>miss therefore that thought, or if you do not entertain

<p>it, cease to judge others by yourself, but judge them

<p>by the relations in which they stand. Consider their

<p>interests ; reflect that it is that which actuates and
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 123
</p>
<p>governs almost every one ; that most of those who
</p>
<p>respect and love you, love themselves infinitely more,
</p>
<p>and dread injury to themselves much more than they
</p>
<p>desire success to you. In fine, consider that those
</p>
<p>who encourage you to hope for their assistance are
</p>
<p>either foreigners or your fellow-citizens. Of the
</p>
<p>first, the most considerable are the French. They
</p>
<p>cannot assist you, for, at present, their whole strength
</p>
<p>is needed to defend themselves in their own country,
</p>
<p>against the armies of the empire and of Spain. Those
</p>
<p>who can assist you, the Genoese, will not. Some
</p>
<p>will be terrified by the dangers which are incident to
</p>
<p>affairs of this nature ; and others, governed by inter-
</p>
<p>est, will fear the loss of their repose or their fortunes.
</p>
<p>Most of those, not influenced by these considerations,
</p>
<p>are persons of such mean birth and little influence,
</p>
<p>that no assistance can be expected from them.
</p>
<p>Wherefore, the unbounded authority of Doria, and
</p>
<p>the evil condition of the times, which inspire you
</p>
<p>with thoughts of revolt, ought rather to teach you pa-
</p>
<p>tience, for they have so dispirited the Genoese that
</p>
<p>they now esteem it an honor to surrender to his au-
</p>
<p>thority that independence which he has restored to
</p>
<p>ihem, and which he wrested from foreigners only
</p>
<p>that he might usurp it himself. Are you not aware,
</p>
<p>that, for a long time, this republic has enjoyed only
</p>
<p>the shadow of a free government, and that it can no
</p>
<p>longer exist without a master ? Do you not perceive

<p>that the family of Doria is gradually attaching to its

<p>Do you not perceive, 1 say, that all the Genoese are

<p>even those, who have most spirit, do not think it dis-

<p>honorable to give way to that mighty power, provided

<p>they do not debase themselves by w^orshipping it. I

<p>do not pretend to justify the republic for its impru-

<p>dence in permitting the elevation of this family, which
</p>
<p>it can no longer endure without disgrace, nor humble
</p>
<p>without danger ; but I dare maintain that an individual
</p>
<p>cannot reasonably hope, by his own means, to remove
</p>
<p>an evil which has become so deeply rooted ; and that
</p>
<p>all which an honorable man can do, in such a junc-
</p>
<p>ture, is to imitate those prudent mariners, who, in-
</p>
<p>stead of struggling obstinately with the w^ind to reach
</p>
<p>a port, seek the open sea, and submit, without resist-
</p>
<p>ance, to the force of the storm. Yield, therefore,
</p>
<p>to the times, while fate so ordains ; seek not for rent-

</p>
<p>than the disease. Await them from the hand of Prov-

<p>idence, which rules, as it pleases, the destinies of

</p>
<p>that, if Giannetino envies or hates your merit, you
</p>
<p><;annot gratify him more than by following your pres-
</p>
<p>ent inclination, for you will afford him an opportunity
</p>
<p>of pursuing his private resentment under the pretext
</p>
<p>of public good, and of making use of the authority of
</p>
<p>the state to destroy you ; and, in fine, you will labor
</p>
<p>yourself to erect, upon your own ruins, trophies of his
</p>
<p>glory and power. They, who rise without effort to
</p>
<p>eminent stations, most commonly fall of themselves ;
</p>
<p>because, if they possess ambition, and the qualities
</p>
<p>which enable them to rise, they are generally desti-

</p>
<p>and when one, whom fortune has borne to these lofty

<p>stations, reaches the height without stumbling, he
</p>
<p>must have encountered, from the beginning, many
</p>
<p>difficulties which taught him to stand firm on a place

<p>so slippery. Caesar possessed, in an eminent degree,

<p>all the qualities necessary to a great prince, yet nei-

</p>
<p>audt'^uppose that you have succeeded in all your de-
</p>
<p>signs. Imagine that all the family of Doria are mas-
</p>
<p>sacred, and that all the nobility, who belong to his
</p>
<p>party, are in irons ; imagine all your enemies over-
</p>
<p>thrown, and Spain and the empire unable to molest
</p>
<p>you ; enjoy the certainty of a triumph in the midst
</p>
<p>of this universal desolation : If these gloomy images
</p>
<p>of destruction afford you pleasure, what course will
</p>
<p>you pursue in a city rendered desolate by you, and
</p>
<p>which will regard you rather as a new tyrant than as
</p>
<p>her deliverer ? What solid foundation will you be able
</p>
<p>to find on which you can support your acquired great-
</p>
<p>ness f Could your confidence in the instability of the
</p>
<p>Genoese, who, the instant you have placed the crown
</p>
<p>on your head, if such be your intention, will, perhaps,
</p>
<p>regard you with horror, and think of nothing but the
</p>
<p>means of wresting it from you ? For, as 1 have al-
</p>
<p>ready observed, they are not capable of enjayiug J4fe r-
</p>
<p>erty, nor will they long endure the same master. Or
</p>
<p>should you again surrender Genoa to the domination
</p>
<p>of foreigners ; should you again open your gates to
</p>
<p>admit them, on the first act of oppression which they

<p>not fear that those, who are now the most zealous to
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 127
</p>
<p>serve you, will, from an unwillingness to be subject
</p>
<p>to your power, be the first to labor for your over-
</p>
<p>throw ? And even if this feeling should not impel them
</p>
<p>to act thus, you cannot be ignorant that those who
</p>
<p>serve a rebel imagine they lay him under such strong
</p>
<p>obligations, that, as he can never reward them ac-
</p>
<p>cording to their claims, they almost always become
</p>
<p>his enemies. As those who fall down a mountain are
</p>
<p>torn to pieces by the same projecting rocks which they
</p>
<p>caught hold of to ascend, so those who fall from an
</p>
<p>exalted station are almost always ruined by the means
</p>
<p>which they had employed to rise. I am well aware
</p>
<p>that ambition animates persons of your condition, age,
</p>
<p>and talents, and that it places before your eyes pom-
</p>
<p>pous and dazzling images of glory and grandeur.
</p>
<p>But while your imagination exhibits to you all the
</p>
<p>objects of that passion which renders men illustrious,
</p>
<p>your judgment ought to regard it as that which
</p>
<p>most commonly renders them miserable, and as that
</p>
<p>which sacrifices certain good, for the attainment of
</p>
<p>uncertain hopes. Know that if, when properly direct-
</p>
<p>ed, it is the source of the noblest virtues, its excess
</p>
<p>also leads to the greatest crimes. Consider that it
</p>
<p>was ambition which formerly mingled so many poi-
</p>
<p>sons and sharpened so many poniards against usurp-
</p>
<p>ers and tyrants, and that it is the same passion which

</p>
<p>public good, impels you to embark in this undertak-
</p>
<p>ing, yet do not expect that the world will ever do
</p>
<p>you the justice to believe it ; since, in all cases where
</p>
<p>actions may be attributed indifferently to vice or to
</p>
<p>virtue, and where the intention alone of the actor can
</p>
<p>justify them, mankind, who judge only from appear-
</p>
<p>ances, rarely put a favorable construction upon the
</p>
<p>most innocent ones. But in your enterprise, in what-
</p>
<p>ever light you view it, you can see nothing but mas-
</p>
<p>sacres and objects the most dismal, which the best
</p>
<p>intentions in the world cannot justify. Strive, then,
</p>
<p>to control your ambition ; and remember that you
</p>
<p>ought then only to follow its dictates, when it divests
</p>
<p>itself entirely of self-interest, and is guided solely by
</p>
<p>duty. There have been many conquerors who have
</p>
<p>ravaged nations and overturned thrones, and who did
</p>
<p>not possess that greatness of soul which regards, with
</p>
<p>equal eye, the highest elevation and the lowest abase-
</p>
<p>ment, success and misfortune, pleasure and pain, life
</p>
<p>and death, and yet it is this love of true glory, this
</p>
<p>nobleness of soul, which makes men really great, and
</p>
<p>which raises them above the rest of the world. This

<p>species of glory, and this alone, can render you per-

</p>
<p>The count was sensibly affected by this discourse,
</p>
<p>the arguments appearing strong, and the confidence,
</p>
<p>which, from his earliest youth, he had reposed in the
</p>
<p>speaker, increasing their weight and force. ^^Verrin a,
</p>
<p>one of those who had been invited to the council, a
</p>
<p>man of extensive views, impetuous, fond of great en-
</p>
<p>terprises, an implacable enemy of the present govern-
</p>
<p>ment, almost ruined by his prodigality, strongly at-
</p>
<p>tached by interest and inclination to the count, im-
</p>
<p>mediately spoke thus in reply :
</p>
<p>" I should be astonished that a single man in Ge-
</p>
<p>noa, should be capable of uttering the sentiments you
</p>
<p>have just heard, if the sufferings, which the republic
</p>
<p>patiently endures, had left me the faculty of being as-
</p>
<p>tonished at any thing. When every one submits to
</p>
<p>oppression with such shameful servility, it is natural
</p>
<p>to conceal dissatisfaction, and to seek excuses for
</p>
<p>weakness. This insensibility is nevertheless a proof
</p>
<p>of the deplorable condition of the republic ; and Vin-
</p>
<p>cent Calcagno has correctly referred to it as the
</p>
<p>plainest symptom of the violence of our malady. But
</p>
<p>to me it seems unreasonable that we should reap no
</p>
<p>advantage from the knowledge which we have of our
</p>
<p>disease ; for nature itself instructs us, that we ought
</p>
<p>to be guided by it in applying the proper remedies.
</p>
<p>However, the health of this republic is not yet as des-^
</p>
<p>perate as if all its members were corrupt -, and the

<p>a man is born for extraordinary actions, the advanta-
</p>
<p>ges of nature and fortune ought not solely to be re-
</p>
<p>garded, for there have been many persons who have
</p>
<p>possessed both in perfection, yet, during their whole
</p>
<p>lives, have remained in the beaten path of ordinary
</p>
<p>men ; but we ought to observe whether a man, en-
</p>
<p>joying these advantages, retains, in conjunctions preg-
</p>
<p>nant with evil, and in a country where tyranny is mak-
</p>
<p>ing rapid strides, the sentiments of virtue, and pre-
</p>
<p>serves from corruption the noble qualities with which
</p>
<p>nature endowed him ; for if, in these circumstances,
</p>
<p>he holds fast his integrity, and resists the contagion
</p>
<p>of those base maxims which infect the rest of the
</p>
<p>world, and especially men of rank, (for tyrants, fear-
</p>
<p>ing them most, take most pains to corrupt them ;)
</p>
<p>then we may presume that his reputation will, at
</p>
<p>3ome future time, be equal to his merit, and that for-
</p>
<p>tune designs him for something great, and even won-
</p>
<p>derful. Wherefore, sir, I know of no person from
</p>
<p>whom the republic may, with reason, expect such
</p>
<p>signal interposition as from you. You live in a time
</p>
<p>which presents you with no example of courage and
</p>
<p>generosity that is not punished, nor of baseness and
</p>
<p>treachery that is not rewarded. Add to this, you live
</p>
<p>in a country where the power of the house of Doria
</p>
<p>depresses, with abject fear, the courage of all the no-
</p>
<p>bility, or holds them bound in the servile fetters of in-
</p>

<p>none but elevated and generous designs ; and, in ex-
</p>
<p>traordinary undertakings, vigor and intrepidity are
</p>
<p>more requisite than the cool reflections of timid pru-
</p>
<p>dence which perceives all the dangers of a contempla-
</p>
<p>ted project. Besides, your reputation is so well es-
</p>
<p>tablished that I may say, without flattery, that, with
</p>
<p>all the charms of youth to attract friends, you have
</p>
<p>acquired that credit in the world which is ordinarily
</p>
<p>acquired only at a more advanced age. You are
</p>
<p>therefore, and it is fortunate that you are, under a
</p>
<p>strong obligation to maintain the high opinion which
</p>
<p>the public entertain of your virtue.
</p>
<p>" Convinced of your disinterestedness, I know not
</p>
<p>whether I ought to add, to the considerations arising
</p>
<p>out of the misfortunes of our republic, motives which
</p>
<p>concern you personally ; but as there are conjunc-
</p>
<p>tures when interest is so closely connected with hon-
</p>
<p>or, that it is almost as disgraceful not to consult, as it
</p>
<p>is, at other times, noble to despise it, I beseech you
</p>
<p>to reflect in what situation you would be, should the
</p>
<p>present government continue much longer. Those
</p>
<p>who unite great merit to exalted birth have always
</p>
<p>two powerful enemies ; the envy of courtiers and the
</p>
<p>hatred of those who fill the liighest oflices. It is ex-
</p>
<p>tremely difficult to escape the first when one possesses
</p>
<p>splendid establishments ; and it is impossible to avoid
</p>
<p>the second, when one has independence of spirit and

<p>a high consideration in the world. Prudence and ci-
</p>
<p>vility may indeed allay the jealousy which interest ex-

</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 133
</p>
<p>the distrust which a regard for their own safety plants
</p>
<p>in the minds of superiors. There are virtues so ex-
</p>
<p>cellent and imposing that they force envy itself to ren-
</p>
<p>der them homage. But, at the same time that they
</p>
<p>gain a victory over envy, they exasperate hatred.
</p>
<p>Hatred increases as merit rises ; and virtue, in these
</p>
<p>circumstances, resembles a vessel tossed by a tem-
</p>
<p>pest, which has no sooner surmounted one wave, than
</p>
<p>it encounters another more formidable than the first.
</p>
<p>" Can you be ignorant that Giannetino Doria feels
</p>
<p>a secret envy of your birth, so much more illustrious
</p>
<p>than his own ? of your wealth, more honestly acquir-
</p>
<p>ed than that which he possesses ? and of your reputa-
</p>
<p>tion which surpasses by far whatever he can hope to
</p>
<p>attain ? What reason have you to suppose, that the
</p>
<p>envy growing out of these considerations, and insti-
</p>
<p>gated by a vehement ambition, will give rise, in the
</p>
<p>mind of this imperious man, to nothing but feeble and
</p>
<p>irresolute purposes, and that it will not aim directly at
</p>
<p>your ruin ? Can you hope that when, by your pru-
</p>
<p>dence and by the force of your virtue, you shall have
</p>
<p>conquered his envy, you will be able to escape that
</p>
<p>hatred which the contrariety of your dispositions nat-
</p>
<p>urally produces in his breast ; and that his haughty
</p>
<p>spirit, which the prudence of Andrew Doria has hith-
</p>
<p>erto restrained, will longer tolerate the man who is
</p>
<p>the only obstacle to his designs ? As for me, I am

<p>persuaded that the consequences I have alluded to

<p>are inevitable, because you cannot divest yourself of

<p>nature and cease to be generous. But should it even
</p>
<p>be in your power to conceal, under a modest exteri-
</p>
<p>or, that loftiness of soul which raises you so far above
</p>
<p>common men, do you believe that Giannetino Doria,
</p>
<p>jealous as he is, and as all tyrants are, will not feel a
</p>
<p>constant distrust of your conduct ? All the marks of
</p>
<p>your moderation and patience v^ould seem to him ar-
</p>
<p>tifices designed to ensnare and undo him. He would
</p>
<p>not consider it possible that a man, bearing the name
</p>
<p>of Fiesco, could be capable of such baseness ; and
</p>
<p>judging, rationally, that you were what you ought to
</p>
<p>be, he would make use, for your ruin, of that apparent
</p>
<p>submission which you would assume for your safety.
</p>
<p>All the difference, therefore, between what you now
</p>
<p>are, and what you would then be, would be merely
</p>
<p>this, that you would then certainly perish with eter-
</p>
<p>nal infamy ; when, by following the generous impul-
</p>
<p>ses of your nature, you may be assured that the only
</p>
<p>misfortune that can happen to you will be, to die in

<p>highest honor thai was ever acquired by a private in-

</p>
<p>termined to ruin us, and advise us to wait until he

<p>AGAINST GENOA. 135
</p>
<p>ruins himself. We deceive ourselves, if we believe
</p>
<p>that fortune raises to the highest stations those whom
</p>
<p>we hate, to give us the pleasure of witnessing their
</p>
<p>fall. Greatness is not always surrounded by preci-
</p>
<p>pices ; usurpers have not always been unfortunate ;
</p>
<p>Heaven, in fine, does not always, at the expected mo-
</p>
<p>ment, punish the wicked, that the righteous may be
</p>
<p>gratified, and be preserved from the injustice of those
</p>
<p>who would oppress them. Nature, more infallible
</p>
<p>than politicians, teaches us to prevent the evil which
</p>
<p>threatens us ; it becomes incurable while prudence is
</p>
<p>deliberating what remedy to apply. What advantage
</p>
<p>shall we gain by examining, with minute attention, the
</p>
<p>examples which have been set before us ^ Is it not
</p>
<p>true that extreme subtilty of reasoning enervates our
</p>
<p>courage, and prevents the most glorious actions ? Ev-
</p>
<p>ery course of proceeding bears two dififerent faces ;
</p>
<p>the same politicians, who blame Pompey, for strength-
</p>
<p>ening the power of Csesar by exasperating him, have
</p>
<p>applauded the conduct of Cicero in crushing Cati-
</p>
<p>line. The other consequence which may be deduced
</p>
<p>from these considerations is, that the talents which
</p>
<p>nature has given us ought not to resemble those faint
</p>
<p>and useless lights, which glimmer only, and do not
</p>
<p>warm. They ought rather to resemble the light of
</p>
<p>the sun which invigorates what it shines upon. Ele-
</p>
<p>vated thoughts should be followed by great efl^ects ;
</p>
<p>and in the execution, as well as in the conception, of
</p>
<p>this enterprise, your courage should meet with noth-

<p>monsters, the avenger of crimes, the refuge of the

<p>oppressed, the ally of kings, and the umpire of Italy.
</p>
<p>But if, at the present moment, that semblance of lib-
</p>
<p>erty which is yet visible in our republic, should pre-
</p>
<p>sent itself to your mind, 1 have reason to fear that it
</p>
<p>will check the course of your ambition ; for I know
</p>
<p>that a mind as scrupulous as yours and as jealous of
</p>
<p>honor, will dread the frightful appellations of rebel
</p>
<p>and traitor.
</p>
<p>'' Yet these names of infamy, invented to terrify
</p>
<p>vulgar minds, attach no disgrace to those who bear
</p>
<p>them for extraordinary and successful actions. Scru-
</p>
<p>ples and greatness have ever been incompatible ; and
</p>
<p>the weak precepts of common prudence are bet-
</p>
<p>ter adapted to the school of the vulgar than to that
</p>
<p>of great men. The crime of usurping a crown is so
</p>
<p>splendid, that it may well pass for a virtue. Every
</p>
<p>condition of life has its peculiar criterion of reputa-
</p>
<p>tion. Men in inferior stations ought to be estimated
</p>
<p>by their moderation ; the great, by their courage and
</p>
<p>ambition. A miserable pirate, cotemporary with Al-
</p>
<p>exander, who amused himself in capturing httle boats,
</p>
<p>passed for an infamous robber ; and that great con-
</p>
<p>queror, who wrested kingdoms from their rightful
</p>
<p>sovereigns, is yet applauded as a hero ; and if Cati-
</p>
<p>line is condemaed as a traitor, Caesar is applauded as
</p>
<p>the greatest man that ever lived. In short, I have
</p>
<p>but to bring to your mind, all the princes who reign

<p>But if these maxims offend, in the least, your dehca-
</p>
<p>cy of principle ; if the love of your country glows in
</p>
<p>your heart more intensely than the love of glory ; if
</p>
<p>there yet exists in your bosom some sUght regard for
</p>
<p>the expiring authority of the republic, let us see what
</p>
<p>honor you will gain by respecting it, when your ene-
</p>
<p>mies disregard it ; and whether it would be for your
</p>
<p>advantage to incur the hazard of becoming their sub-
</p>
<p>ject. Would to God the republic shone in its pristine
</p>
<p>splendor ! No person would then, more earnestly than
</p>
<p>I, dissuade you from the design which I now recom-
</p>
<p>mend. If this republic, which now enjoys nothing of
</p>
<p>liberty but the name, could maintain her authority,
</p>
<p>feeble as it is, in the condition we now see it, 1 con-
</p>
<p>fess that there would be some reason for enduring our
</p>
<p>misfortunes with patience ; and that, if it were neither
</p>
<p>safe nor useful, it would at least, be generous, to sac-
</p>
<p>rifice our personal interests to that shadowy image
</p>
<p>which yet remains of its liberty : but now, when the
</p>
<p>arts of Andrew Doria have concentrated all the au-
</p>
<p>thority of the republic in himself, and when the arro-

<p>when the minds of her citizens are too much at vari-

<p>that this action will procure you the reputation of an

<p>prevent you from undertaking it ; and nothing but

<p>the love of glory, which is directly opposite to self-

<p>be of no advantage to you, because, as Calcagno has

<p>in your condition would be but a change of servi-

<p>tude ; you would become the slave of France, when

<p>you may become her ally. Determine, in fine,

<p>whether it be the proper course for a man of talents,
</p>
<p>of merit, and of rank like yourself, to endure every

</p>
<p>at his command when he hazarded his whole fortune ;
</p>
<p>that he could not comprehend why he should be ad-
</p>
<p>vised to oppose himself singly to the forces of the
</p>
<p>empire, of Spain and of Italy, which would assuredly
</p>
<p>be united against him ; that it might be possible,
</p>
<p>perhaps, to gain possession of a city by a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>but not to acquire the control of a state ; that this
</p>
<p>could not be effected but in a long course of years,
</p>
<p>and by means of armies and allies ; and that the idea
</p>
<p>of seizing on the sovereignly of Genoa, in the present
</p>
<p>state of European affairs, was a rash resolution, how-
</p>
<p>ever willing others might be to disguise it under the

<p>all his power, this reasoning of Raphael Sacco, and

<p>reminded the count of the arguments which he had

<p>urged on that point, in his discourse. And he now

</p>
<p>people who soon become weary of every thing, and
</p>
<p>whose attention to foreign affairs is subject to the fre-
</p>
<p>quent revolutions which happen within the kingdom,
</p>
<p>and depends on the disposition of those who are in of-
</p>
<p>fice, he would preclude all accommodation with the em-
</p>
<p>peror, whose power in Italy was greater than theirs. It
</p>
<p>would be in season to solicit the aid of France, after
</p>
<p>he had ascertained that he could form no alliance
</p>
<p>with the emperor. In this case, it would be so much
</p>
<p>the interest of the French not to desert him that they
</p>
<p>would not fail to assist him, because, while he re-
</p>
<p>mained master of Genoa, they would be in constant
</p>
<p>fear that he would unite with their enemies, if they
</p>
<p>refused the assistance necessary for his defence.
</p>
<p>And furthp-rmore, to ensure success there was no ne-
</p>
<p>cessity for greater forces than those he could furnish
</p>
<p>himself, for he well knew that there were but two
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty soldiers in Genoa, and that the gal-
</p>
<p>lies of Giannetino Doria were completely disarmed.
</p>
<p>These reasons convinced the count, because they
</p>
<p>were conformable to his natural incHnation to glory,
</p>
<p>and to his greatness of soul, which deemed nothing
</p>
<p>difiicult that was honorable. He resolved to attempt
</p>
<p>the execution of his design with his own means, and
</p>
<p>to employ none but the friends and adherents which
</p>
<p>his illustrious birth, his uncommon affabihty, his pro-
</p>
<p>fuse liberality, and all his other good qualities had se-
</p>
<p>cured him.

</p>
<p>raise themselves to high stations, and to improve their
</p>
<p>condition in the u-orld ; but we meet with few who,
</p>
<p>having formed the^se resolutions, know how to choose
</p>
<p>the proper mode to accomplish them, and who do not
</p>
<p>sometimes relax in that constant exertion which is
</p>
<p>necessary to ensure success ; or, when they do exert
</p>
<p>themselves, it is almost always at an improper time, or
</p>
<p>in an improper manner, and with too much anxiety
</p>
<p>for the result. And this is so true that, in affairs of
</p>
<p>this nature, most men deliberate longer than is neces-
</p>
<p>sary before they resolve, but do not allow themselves
</p>
<p>time enough to execute their determinations. They
</p>
<p>do not, in season, aim to accommodate their actions
</p>
<p>to the object they have in view, to regulate all their
</p>
<p>steps by the plan they have formed, to establish a rep-
</p>
<p>utation, to acquire friends, nor, in short, to render all
</p>
<p>their conduct subservient to their principal design.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, we often see them suddenly change
</p>
<p>their course, their minds seem agitated and over-bur-
</p>
<p>thened by the secret and the weight of their enter-
</p>
<p>prise, and amidst the changes and irregularity of their
</p>
<p>conduct, they say or do something which gives an ad-
</p>
<p>vantage to those who watch them, or offence to their
</p>
<p>enemies.
</p>
<p>The count Fiesco wisely avoided these errors ;
</p>
<p>for, conscious of an ardent desire for distinction, and
</p>
<p>persuaded that he should, at some future time, be
</p>
<p>able to concentrate his general inclination upon some
</p>
<p>particular design favorable to his elevation, this

</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 143
</p>
<p>and as he had naturally an incredible thirst for glory
</p>
<p>and great address in establishing a reputation, he so
</p>
<p>conducted himself that the eminent quahties he dis-
</p>
<p>played, seemed to proceed from his natural disposi-
</p>
<p>tion, and not to be studied nor affected. His counte-*
</p>
<p>nance always appeared serene, open, pleasant, and
</p>
<p>even jovial. He was civil to every body, but made
</p>
<p>proper and flattering distinctions according to merit
</p>
<p>and rank ; he was so profuse in his liberality that he
</p>
<p>anticipated the wants of his friends. Thus he gained
</p>
<p>the poor by his munificence, and the rich by his cour-
</p>
<p>tesy. He faithfully observed his engagements ; he
</p>
<p>displayed an ardor to oblige which never remitted ;
</p>
<p>his house was open and his table free to all who
</p>
<p>came ; he was generous in all things even to excess ;
</p>
<p>and no one was ever so firmly persuaded as he that
</p>
<p>avarice, reserve, and pride, obscure the most shining
</p>
<p>qualities of great men. But what gave an extraordi-
</p>
<p>nary lustre to those he possessed was the manly
</p>
<p>beauty of his person and his graceful and dignified
</p>
<p>manners, which attested his illustrious birth, and en-
</p>
<p>gaged the esteem and respect of all.
</p>
<p>This behavior secured, to that degree, the affec-
</p>
<p>tions of his friends, that not one of those, who prom-
</p>
<p>ised to serve him, were unfaithful Br ii^4isereet  an
</p>
<p>extraordinary circumstance, indeed, in a conspiracy,

<p>dent. But it is still more wonderful that his conduct,
</p>
<p>144 CONSPIRACY OF FIESCO
</p>
<p>though uniformly such as I have described, and ob-
</p>
<p>served by his enemies, did not excite their distrust ;
</p>
<p>they believing that whatever was too ostentatious in
</p>
<p>his behavior should be attributed rather to his natural
</p>
<p>disposition than to any particular design he had
</p>
<p>formed.
</p>
<p>This, without doubt, was one of the causes that in-
</p>
<p>duced Andrew Doria to slight the information, con-
</p>
<p>cerning the enterprise, which he received from Fer-
</p>
<p>dinand Gonzague and two or three others : I say one
</p>
<p>of the causes, for, although the behavior of Fiesco
</p>
<p>contributed to lull the suspicion of this old politician,
</p>
<p>who was exceedingly jealous of his authority, there
</p>
<p>must, nevertheless, have been some other cause for
</p>
<p>this extraordinary blindness. But it is difficult to
</p>
<p>discover what it was, unless we refer to an overruling
</p>
<p>providence, which delights in showing the vanity of
</p>
<p>human prudence, and in confounding the presumption
</p>
<p>of those who flatter themselves they can divine the
</p>
<p>most secret thoughts of men, and judge, with iofalli-
</p>
<p>ble certainty, of all human actions. This presump-
</p>
<p>tion is never more ridiculous than in those great ge-
</p>
<p>niuses whom continued study, profound meditation
</p>
<p>and long experience have raised so high above com-
</p>
<p>mon men, and inflated with such self-conceit, that
</p>
<p>they rely implicitly upon their own judgment, in the
</p>
<p>most intricate affairs, and listen to the advice of oth-
</p>
<p>ers only to despise it. It is certain that most of those

</p>
<p>a quick insight into futurity, are almost always blind
</p>
<p>in regard to their own interests. They are more
</p>
<p>unfortunate than others, for they will not be guid-
</p>
<p>ed either by their own reason or by that of their
</p>
<p>friends.
</p>
<p>The act of generosity, which most augmented the
</p>
<p>partisans of Fiesco among the people, was that of af-
</p>
<p>fording relief to the silk-spinners, who constituted a
</p>
<p>considerable portion of the inhabitants of Genoa.
</p>
<p>They, at that time, suffered extremely from want oc-
</p>
<p>casioned by the recent wars. The count, apprised
</p>
<p>by their consul of their miserable condition, evinced
</p>
<p>much compassion for their poverty, and requested
</p>
<p>him to send to his palace those who had the most
</p>
<p>need of assistance. He supplied them Hberally with
</p>
<p>money and provisions, and requested them to say
</p>
<p>nothing of the presents he gave them, as he desired no
</p>
<p>other reward than the internal satisfaction he derived
</p>
<p>from relieving the afflicted. In dispensing his bounty,
</p>
<p>he displayed all the courteousness and obliging civil-
</p>
<p>ity which was natural to him, and gained so entirely
</p>
<p>the hearts of these poor people, that ever afterwards,
</p>
<p>they were wholly devoted to his service.
</p>
<p>But if, by his generosity, he gained the esteem and
</p>
<p>love of the lower class of citizens, he did not forget to
</p>
<p>secure the good will of those at the head of this class,
</p>
<p>by the praises of liberty which he often, with much
</p>
<p>address, introduced into his discourse. From this
</p>
<p>they inferred that, although he belonged to the nobil-
</p>
<p>ity, he was too reasonable and just not to feel a lively

<p>compassion for the people groaning under the op-
</p>
<p>pression of their rulers.
</p>
<p>There are some who accuse the republic of indis-
</p>
<p>cretion on this occasion, and maintain that it was ex-
</p>
<p>tremely imprudent, in the senate, to suffer the count
</p>
<p>thus to conciliate every body, and to take such means
</p>
<p>to gain the hearts of his fellow-citizens. I cannot
</p>
<p>deny that the maxim, on which this accusation is
</p>
<p>founded, has been considered correct by subtle and
</p>
<p>refined politicians : its object being to prevent private
</p>
<p>individuals from acquiring great influence, it may,
</p>
<p>with some reason, be thought that its effect will be
</p>
<p>to promote the general safety ; but I am convinced
</p>
<p>it is an erroneous maxim, for it changes the nature of
</p>
<p>good qualities, rendering them hurtful or dangerous
</p>
<p>to the possessor. I consider it even pernicious, be-
</p>
<p>cause, exposing merit to suspicion, it stifles the seeds
</p>
<p>of virtue, and creates such a disgust for the pursuit of
</p>
<p>glory, that men will not zealously undertake to per-
</p>
<p>form meritorious actions, and will be diverted, by the
</p>
<p>fear of offending the government, from those which
</p>
<p>might be useful to the state. It happens, also, that,
</p>
<p>instead of confining bold and intrepid men within the
</p>
<p>limits of that equality which it inculcates, it sometimes
</p>
<p>impels them to give a freer course to their ambition,
</p>
<p>and to take violent measures to relieve themselves
</p>
<p>from restraint so tyrannical.

<p>The count did not rely so implicitly upon the good

<p>will of the populace as to neglect to secure the aid of

<p>soldiers, who are essentially necessary in enterprises
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 147
</p>
<p>of this nature. In the beginning of the summer, he
</p>
<p>left Genoa, apparently to visit his estates, but in real-
</p>
<p>ity to ascertain what number of men who had served
</p>
<p>in war, could be found among his vassals, and to train
</p>
<p>them in martial exercises, upon the pretence that he
</p>
<p>apprehended an attack from the duke of Placentia.
</p>
<p>He wished also to give the necessary orders for exe-
</p>
<p>cuting the design he had formed, of introducing se-
</p>
<p>cretly, and at the proper time, a number of his parti-
</p>
<p>sans into Genoa, and to ascertain the sentiments of
</p>
<p>the duke, who engaged to furnish him two thousand
</p>
<p>of his best troops.
</p>
<p>The count, returning about the end of autumn, con-
</p>
<p>tinued to behave as he had done, and moreover prac-
</p>
<p>tised a profound dissimulation, in regard to the family
</p>
<p>of Doria ; professing, on every occasion, a great
</p>
<p>veneration for Andrew, and cordial friendship for
</p>
<p>Giannetino. His motive was to convince the world
</p>
<p>that their recent divisions were entirely adjusted, and
</p>
<p>to show them that his friendship was sincere, and
</p>
<p>might be rehed on.
</p>
<p>If it is true that the count, on the day of the exe-
</p>
<p>cution of his enterprise, said that he had long before
</p>
<p>been informed that Giannetino had resolved on his ru-
</p>
<p>in, and that this violent and wicked man, who was
</p>
<p>kept in restraint only by Andrew, perceiving that his
</p>
<p>uncle was subject to dangerous infirmities, had com-
</p>
<p>manded captain Lercaro to despatch all who belong-
</p>
<p>ed to the family of FTesco, the moment he should

<p>die ; that he had authentic letters by which he could
</p>
<p>148 CONSPIRACY OF FIESCO
</p>
<p>prove, that this same Giannetino had attempted,
</p>
<p>three several times, to poison him ; and that he was,
</p>
<p>besides, assured that the emperor intended to confer
</p>
<p>on him the sovereignty of Genoa ; if, I say, all this
</p>
<p>is true, I do not think the dissimulation of the count
</p>
<p>can justly be blamed ; for, when life or the safety of
</p>
<p>our country is at stake, frankness is a virtue out of
</p>
<p>season, nature teaching us, by the instinct of the smal-
</p>
<p>lest animals, that, in such extremities, the use of
</p>
<p>stratagem to preserve ourselves from danger, and our
</p>
<p>country from oppression, is justifiable and proper.
</p>
<p>But if the accusations of the count wore only calum-
</p>
<p>nies against the family of Doria, invented to justify
</p>
<p>his designs, and to exasperate the people, it cannot be
</p>
<p>denied that these false tokens of friendship, indica-
</p>
<p>tive of so much affection, were artifices unworthy of
</p>
<p>bis great courage. And it would, without doubt, be
</p>
<p>difficult to justify such conduct, except by the neces-
</p>
<p>sity which the power and insolence of Giannetino im-
</p>
<p>posed upon him to behave in this manner.
</p>
<p>The count had bought four gallies, which he main-
</p>
<p>tained, under the name of his brother Jerome, with
</p>
<p>funds furnished by the pope. Convinced that the
</p>
<p>step most essential to the success of his design was to
</p>
<p>render himself master of the port, he ordered one of
</p>
<p>these gallies to Genoa, pretending that he intended
</p>
<p>to despatch it, on a cruise, to the Levant ; and, at
</p>
<p>the same time, he, without exciting suspicion, intro-
</p>
<p>duced into the city, a party of soldiers who came

</p>
<p>some of them passing for soldiers of the garrison,
</p>
<p>some for adventurers in quest of employment, some
</p>
<p>for sailors, and many even for galley slaves.
</p>
<p>Verrina artfully dispersed, among the companies
</p>
<p>belonging to the city, fifteen or twenty soldiers who
</p>
<p>were vassals of the count, and corrupted others be-
</p>
<p>longing 10 the garrison. He obtained, from persons
</p>
<p>of the most enterprise and and influence among the
</p>
<p>people, promises of every assistance they could ren-
</p>
<p>der, to execute a design which, as he told them, he
</p>
<p>had formed against some of their enemies. Calcag-
</p>
<p>no and Sacco, on their part, labored with diligence
</p>
<p>and industry ; and I cannot better describe the ad-
</p>
<p>dress, with which these four persons managed this
</p>
<p>enterprise, than by saying that, without disclosing
</p>
<p>the real object to any one, they engaged in their ser-
</p>
<p>vice more than ten thousand me. -
</p>
<p>Matters being thus arranged, nothing remained but
</p>
<p>to select a day for the execution of the enterprise ;
</p>
<p>and this was found somewhat difficult. Verrina was
</p>
<p>of opinion that the two Dorias, Adam Centurione,
</p>
<p>and such of the nobility as were attached to that par-
</p>
<p>ty, should be invited to attend a mass to be celebrated
</p>
<p>by a priest of distinction, being the first time he offi-
</p>
<p>ciated, when it was usual to invite persons of rank to
</p>
<p>be present ; and he offered to kill them himself.
</p>
<p>This proposition was instantly rejected by the count,
</p>
<p>who, struck with horror, exclaimed that he would
</p>
<p>never consent to profane the holiest mystery of his
</p>
<p>religion to facilitate the success of his design. It was

<p>then proposed that they should take the opportunity

<p>..of the marriage of a sister of Giannetino Doria with
</p>
<p>^v^A.-^^^ius Cibo, marquis of Massa, a brother-in-law of

</p>
<p>then be executed with ease, as the count would have
</p>
<p>a pretence for inviting all the relations of that family
</p>
<p>to an entertainment, where he might massacre them
</p>
<p>at once. But the generous feelings of the count, as
</p>
<p>many assert, and as may be easily believed of a man
</p>
<p>of his disposition, impelled him also to reject the
</p>
<p>practice of such treachery ; yet the partisans of Do-
</p>
<p>ria have asserted that he had determined to make use
</p>
<p>of this opportunity, but that Giannetino being obliged,
</p>
<p>on that day, to leave Genoa on business, he altered his
</p>
<p>purpose. At length, after much deliberation, the
</p>
<p>night of the second of January was selected, and to
</p>
<p>this effect the necessary^ orders were judiciously giv-
</p>
<p>en, Verrina, Calcagno and Sacco directing those
</p>
<p>they had engaged. The count caused a great quan-
</p>
<p>tity of arms to be brought to his house ; he sent per-
</p>
<p>sons to examine the posts of which he had resolved to
</p>
<p>take possession ; he introduced, by small numbers at
</p>
<p>a time, and without noise, into a building contiguous
</p>
<p>to his palace, the soldiers who were destined to ex-
</p>
<p>ecute the first part of the enterprise ; and the day
</p>
<p>having arrived, he, to conceal his design, visited
</p>
<p>many of his friends, and even went, in the evening,

<p>to the palace of Doria. There, observing the^^hil-

</p>
<p>of their father, whom he requested to give orders to
</p>
<p>the commander of his gaUies not to interpose any ob-
</p>
<p>stacle to the departure of his own galley, which was
</p>
<p>to set sail, that evening, lor the Levant. He took
</p>
<p>leave of him, with the ordinary civilities ; and, when
</p>
<p>returning home, he stopped at the house of Thomas
</p>
<p>Assereto,- where he found upwards of thirty gentlemen
</p>
<p>wiio were popular in the city, and whom Verrina had
</p>
<p>the address to collect at that place. These he invited
</p>
<p>to sup with him at his palace. He then sent Verrina
</p>
<p>throughout the city, to the senate house, and to the
</p>
<p>palace of Doria, to ascertain whether any one had
</p>
<p>knowledge or suspicion of his design ; and after hav-
</p>
<p>ing learned that every thing was quiet as usual, he
</p>
<p>gave orders that the doors of his palace should be
</p>
<p>shut, that all should nevertheless be admitted, who
</p>
<p>expressed a wish to see him, but that no one should
</p>
<p>be permitted to go out.
</p>
<p>Perceiving that those whom he had invited as
</p>
<p>guests were extremely surprised to find, instead of a
</p>
<p>feast which they expected, nothing but arms, jiersons
</p>
<p>unknown to them, and soldiers, he requested them to
</p>
<p>repair to a large hall, where, displaying in his counte-
</p>
<p>nance a lofty and confident courage, he thus addres-
</p>
<p>sed them :

</p>
<p>the republic is in imminent peril? To what use, do
</p>
<p>you imagine, are destined the twenty galhes that be-
</p>
<p>siege your harbor ? For what purpose have so many
</p>
<p>troops been collected, so many arrangements made ?
</p>
<p>Behold them ready to triumph over our patience, and
</p>
<p>to raise their unjust authority upon the ruins of the
</p>
<p>state. We must no longer deplore our sufferings in
</p>
<p>secret ; we must hazard every thing to obtain dehv-
</p>
<p>erance. As the distemper is violent, so also must be
</p>
<p>the remedy ; and if the fear of falling into a state of
</p>
<p>degrading servitude can have any effect upon your
</p>
<p>minds, it is incumbent on you to make an effort to
</p>
<p>break your chains, and to anticipate those who wish
</p>
<p>to fasten them forever upon you ; for I cannot imag-
</p>
<p>ine that you are capable of enduring any longer the
</p>
<p>injustice of the uncle, and the arrogance of the
</p>
<p>nephew. I do not believe, I say, that there is one
</p>
<p>among you of a temper to submit to those as masters,
</p>
<p>who ought to be content to be your equals. Even
</p>
<p>were we regardless of the safety of the republic, we
</p>
<p>cannot be of our own. Each one of us has too many
</p>
<p>wrongs to revenge ; and our vengeance will be, at
</p>
<p>the same time, legitimate and glorious ; for our pri-
</p>
<p>vate resentments mingle with our zeal for the public
</p>
<p>good, and we cannot abandon our own interests with-
</p>
<p>out betraying those of our country. It depends upon
</p>
<p>you alone to secure her safety, and your own ; you
</p>
<p>have only to resolve to be happy, and you will be so.

</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 153
</p>
<p>of glory, and I am ready to show you the way, if you
</p>
<p>are disposed to follow. These preparations which
</p>
<p>you witness, ought, at this time, to animate you more
</p>
<p>than they have surprised you ; and the astonishment
</p>
<p>which I observed, at first, on your countenance, ought
</p>
<p>to change to the glorious resolution to employ, with
</p>
<p>vigor, these arras to effect the destruction of our com-
</p>
<p>mon enemies, and the establishment of our indepen-
</p>
<p>dence. I should insult your courage, if I imagined
</p>
<p>you capable, after seeing these arms, of hesitating, an
</p>
<p>instant, what use you ought to make of them. Suc-
</p>
<p>cess is rendered sure by the perfect arrangements I
</p>
<p>have made ; it will be beneficial from the advantages
</p>
<p>you will receive; it will be just by reason of the op-
</p>
<p>pressions you endure ; and it will, in fine, be glori-
</p>
<p>ous from the grandeur of the enterprise. I could
</p>
<p>prove, by these letters which you now see, that the
</p>
<p>emperor has promised to bestow on Andrew Doria,
</p>
<p>the sovereignty of Genoa, and that he is prepared to
</p>
<p>execute his promise. I could show, by other letters
</p>
<p>which 1 have in my possession, that Giannetino has
</p>
<p>attempted, three several times, to suborn wretches to
</p>
<p>poison me. It would be easy to convince you that
</p>
<p>he has given orders to Lercaro to assassinate me and
</p>
<p>all my family, the instant his uncle dies. But the
</p>
<p>knowledge of these treacherous intentions, detestable
</p>
<p>and infamous as they are, would add nothing to the
</p>
<p>horror with which you already regard these monsters.

<p>154 CONSPIRACY OF FIESCO
</p>
<p>you are more impatient than I to give entire license to
</p>
<p>your resentment, to secure your property, your re-
</p>
<p>pose, and the honor of your families. Let us then,
</p>
<p>ray dear fellow citizens, save the reputation of Genoa ;
</p>
<p>let us preserve the independence of our country ; and
</p>
<p>let us show the whole world that there yet exists, in

<p>this republic, good men who have the heart to bring

<p>tyrants to destruction."
</p>
<p>This discourse astonished the assembly, but as al-
</p>
<p>most all of them were ardent in their attachment to
</p>
<p>the count, and as some of them, in addition to this at-
</p>
<p>tachment, felt exalted hopes of advantage in case the
</p>
<p>enterprise succeeded, and others feared his resent-
</p>
<p>ment if they refused to follow his fortunes, they prom-
</p>
<p>ised to serve him to the utmost of their power. Two
</p>
<p>only of the whole number, either because their peace-
</p>
<p>ful occupations or timorous dispositions rendered them
</p>
<p>incapable (as they said) of serving in an enterprise
</p>
<p>where many dangers were to be encountered and
</p>
<p>many murders committed, or because they felt a sin-
</p>
<p>cere attachment to the family of Doria, or some of his
</p>
<p>party, which they concealed under the appearance of
</p>
<p>timidity, prayed to be excused from engaging in the
</p>
<p>project. The count urged them no farther, but con-
</p>
<p>tented himself with confining them to deprive them
</p>
<p>of the power of reveahng his design. The mildness
</p>
<p>with which he treated these two persons prevents me
</p>
<p>from believing, what several historians, hostile to his
</p>
<p>reputation, have published, that in his discourse to

<p>the assembly he uttered nothing but threats against
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 155
</p>
<p>those who should refuse to assist him ; and I think
</p>
<p>we may, with reason, form the same opinion, in re-
</p>
<p>gard to the impious and cruel expressions, which they
</p>
<p>accuse him of having used, on the evening of the ex-
</p>
<p>ecution of his enterprise. For is it probable that a
</p>
<p>man of his condition, born with an ardent inclination
</p>
<p>to acquire glory, could have permitted his passions
</p>
<p>to betray him into the use of expressions which can-
</p>
<p>not be recollected but with horror, and which could
</p>
<p>not, in any manner, have been useful to his designs ?
</p>
<p>However the fact may be, as soon as he had finished
</p>
<p>his address to the assembly, and explained to them
</p>
<p>the arrangements he had made, he repaired to the
</p>
<p>apartment of his wife. As she suspected that the
</p>
<p>great preparations which had been made in the pal-
</p>
<p>ace, were destined, by her husband, for some dan-
</p>
<p>gerous enterprise, he foiind her in tears. He there-
</p>
<p>fore thought that he ought no longer to conceal from
</p>
<p>her his intentions, but he endeavored to calm her
</p>
<p>apprehensions by all the arguments he could devise,
</p>
<p>representing to her how far he had proceeded, and
</p>
<p>that it was impossible now to retreat. She made all
</p>
<p>imaginable efforts to divert him from his undertaking,
</p>
<p>exerting all the influence which his affection gave
</p>
<p>her over iiis mind. But neither her tears nor her
</p>
<p>prayers could shake his resolution. Paul Pansa, who
</p>
<p>had been his tutor, and for whom he felt a high ven-
</p>
<p>eration, united with the countess, and omitted nothing
</p>
<p>to recal him to the observance of the duties of a good

</p>
<p>red in pursuing his object. The count was as little
</p>
<p>influenced by the advice of his tutor, as he had been by
</p>
<p>the caresses and tears of his wife. He had (as is said
</p>
<p>of Cassar) passed the Rubicon ; and, returning to
</p>
<p>the hall, where he had left his guests, he gave the
</p>
<p>last orders for the execution of his enterprise. He
</p>
<p>commanded one hundred and fifty men, chosen from
</p>
<p>the whole body of soldiers, to go that part of the city
</p>
<p>called the Burough, whither he was to follow them,
</p>
<p>accompanied by the nobility. He ordered Cornelius,
</p>
<p>his illegitimate brother, as soon as they had arrived
</p>
<p>at the Burough, to take thirty of this number, and
</p>
<p>gain possession of the gate of the arch. Jerome and
</p>
<p>Ottoban, his brothers, with Vincent Calcagno, were
</p>
<p>directed to take possession of that of St. Thomas, at
</p>
<p>the instant they heard the cannon of Fiesco's galley.
</p>
<p>This galley was commanded by Verrina, and was in
</p>
<p>readiness to close the entrance into the dock, and to
</p>
<p>invest the gate of Doria's palace. The count was to
</p>
<p>repair, by land, to this gate, after having, with as lit-
</p>
<p>tle noise as possible, placed, on his way, detachments
</p>
<p>at St. Andrew's and St. Donat's arches, and at the
</p>
<p>square des Sauvages. Thomas Assereto was com-
</p>
<p>manded to seize this gate, giving the countersign,
</p>
<p>which he could easily know, as he held an office un-
</p>
<p>der Giannetino Doria. As this was the most impor-
</p>
<p>tant part of the enterprise, because, if it did not suc-
</p>
<p>ceed, those who were in the count's galley could have
</p>
<p>no communication with the other conspirators, it was

<p>thought expedient, to ensure success, that Scipio
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 15T
</p>
<p>Borgognino, one of the count's vassals and an intrepid
</p>
<p>soldier, should force his way, with armed feluccas,
</p>
<p>into the dock, and land on that side, at the moment
</p>
<p>when Asserelo should make the attack on the other.
</p>
<p>It was also determined that, as soon as Jerome^^nJL-
</p>
<p>Ottoban Fiesco had become masters of St. Thomas'
</p>
<p>gate, whlcB was near Doria's palace, one of them
</p>
<p>should force his way into the palace, and kill Andrew
</p>
<p>and Giannetino ; and as there was reason to believe
</p>
<p>that Giannetino, awakened by the noise at the gates,
</p>
<p>might throw himself into Lewis Juha's felucca and
</p>
<p>hasten thither to give orders, three armed feluccas
</p>
<p>were stationed there to prevent it. To these partic-
</p>
<p>ular orders a general one was added, that all the
</p>
<p>conspirators should call to the people with the name
</p>
<p>of Fiesco, and cry Liberty^ in order that those citi-
</p>
<p>zens, of whose attachment they were well assured,
</p>
<p>might not be deceived, and that, knowing the count
</p>
<p>was the leader of the enterprise, they might join his
</p>
<p>party.
</p>
<p>It is not easy to decide whether it would not have
</p>
<p>been more advantageous and safe to have kept united
</p>
<p>in one body all these troops, who were despatched to
</p>
<p>positions distant from each other. Their number was
</p>
<p>sufficiently large to authorise the belief that, if they
</p>
<p>had entered the city at one place, they would have
</p>
<p>driven all before them, and would, wherever they
</p>
<p>went, have induced the people to join the victorious
</p>
<p>party ; but, being divided, they could act but feebly,
</p>
<p>were liable to commit mistakes, and to be defeated >

<p>one division after another ; for nothing is more true
</p>
<p>than that it requires unconanion exactness to assign
</p>
<p>the precise moment for several combined attacks, and
</p>
<p>unusual good fortune for all to succeed alike. On
</p>
<p>these occasions, so many arms and so many heads
</p>
<p>must concur in the same action, that the least error
</p>
<p>in one often disconcerts all the rest, . as the disorder
</p>
<p>of a single wheel may stop the motion of the greatest
</p>
<p>machine. And furthermore it would be very surpris-
</p>
<p>ing if, in the night and amidst the tumult which gene-
</p>
<p>rally accompanies attempts of this kind, either the
</p>
<p>courage or the discretion of some one of the conspi-
</p>
<p>rators should not fail him, and that, dreading the dan-
</p>
<p>ger which was near more than that which was remote,
</p>
<p>he should not repent his engagement ; but when all
</p>
<p>march in a body, example animates and encourages
</p>
<p>the most timid, who are drawn onward by the multi-
</p>
<p>tude, and do from necessity what the brave do from
</p>
<p>courage.
</p>
<p>Those who adopt the opposite opinion maintain
</p>
<p>that, in enterprises of this kind which are executed
</p>
<p>by night, in a city where the conspirators act in con-
</p>
<p>cert with many others, where most of the inhabitants
</p>
<p>are favorably disposed, and where they may gain
</p>
<p>possession of the principal posts before their enemies
</p>
<p>are in a condition to contend with them, it is more
</p>
<p>advisable to form several parties, and make separate
</p>
<p>attacks, in many places ; because, by giving, at the
</p>
<p>smne time, several alarms, in distant parts, those who

<p>acton the defensive are obliged to divide their forces,
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. 159
</p>
<p>without knowing how many to detach, and the terror,
</p>
<p>which these sudden alarms generally occasion, is much
</p>
<p>greater when the noise proceeds from every quarter
</p>
<p>than when attention is called to only one ; besides,
</p>
<p>where the streets are narrow, like those of Genoa,
</p>
<p>a small number can effect all that a larger can, and
</p>
<p>ten men, attacked in front, with the help of a slight
</p>
<p>barricade, may stop a hundred times as many of the
</p>
<p>bravest soldiers, and gain time for those who are be-
</p>
<p>hind to rally. In fine, those who are of this opinion
</p>
<p>think that, in an enterprise like this, it is less advanta-
</p>
<p>geous to the conspirators, they having the good will of
</p>
<p>a majority of the citizens, to unite their forces in one
</p>
<p>body, than to disperse them into different parts of the
</p>
<p>city ; hecause then the whole are aroused at once,
</p>
<p>and they take arms the more readily when they per-
</p>
<p>ceive others do the same, and are more capable of
</p>
<p>rendering service when they act with regular troops
</p>
<p>and have persons of credit to lead them.
</p>
<p>All these reasons being impartially considered, it is
</p>
<p>my opinion that the count conducted judiciously ; for
</p>
<p>it appears to me that, on this occasion, he had
</p>
<p>less reason than is commonly the case to fear
</p>
<p>the inconveniences just mentioned. His party was
</p>
<p>composed, not merely of soldiers and nobles, but also
</p>
<p>of a multitude of citizens, upon whose attachment he
</p>
<p>relied ; so that, having numerous friends in all parts
</p>
<p>of Genoa, he had reason to believe that the garrison,
</p>
<p>which was extremely weak, and those who were not

<p>friendly to him, could not oppose any obstacle to the
</p>
<p>160 CONSPIRACY OF FIESCO
</p>
<p>success of his design, nor make sufficient resistance
</p>
<p>to dishearten those who sliould join his party. For
</p>
<p>these reasons, when he left his pahice, he divided his
</p>
<p>men according to the plan he had devised ; and, at
</p>
<p>the moment wh(m the report of the cannon on board
</p>
<p>his galley, which had been appointed as the signal,
</p>
<p>was heard, Cornehus surprised the guard stationed. at
</p>
<p>the gate of the arch, and gained possession of it with-
</p>
<p>out difficulty. Ottoban j.Lid Jexonve, brothers of the
</p>
<p>count, accompanied by Calcagno and sixty soldiers,
</p>
<p>found more resistance at^St. Thomas' Gate, where
</p>
<p>Captain Sebastian Lercaro, and his brother, for a con-
</p>
<p>siderable time, maintained their post. But the latter
</p>
<p>being killed, and the former taken, and some of their
</p>
<p>men, who had been previously gained, having declar^
</p>
<p>ed in favor of Fiesco, the guard fled, abandoning
</p>
<p>their post to the conspirators. Giannetino Doria,
</p>
<p>awakened either by the tumult at the gate, or by the
</p>
<p>outcry which, at the same time, was made in the
</p>
<p>harbor, rose in haste ; and accompanied only by a
</p>
<p>page, who carried a flambeau before him, he ran to
</p>
<p>St. Thomas' gate, where, being recognized by the
</p>
<p>conspirators, he was killed as soon as he arrived.
</p>
<p>This precipitancy of Giannetino saved Andrew
</p>
<p>Doria's life, and gave him time to mount a horse and
</p>
<p>retire ^(teen miles from Genoa ; for Jerome, who had
</p>
<p>been directed by his brother to force the palace of
</p>
<p>Doria, the instant he was master of St. Thomas' gate,
</p>
<p>seeing that Giannetino was killed, preferred the pre-

</p>
<p>from the soldiers, to the capture of Andrew Doria,
</p>
<p>whom he considered an inefficient old man, that it
</p>
<p>would be useless to sacrifice.
</p>
<p>In the midst of these occurrences at the gate of
</p>
<p>St. Thomas, Assereto and Scipio Borgognino execu-
</p>
<p>ted the orders which had been given them with com-
</p>
<p>plete success. They killed all who made any resist-
</p>
<p>ance at the gate by the dock, and pressed the rest
</p>
<p>with such vigor that they had not time to rally, and
</p>
<p>at last they took possession of that important post.
</p>
<p>The count, after having, on his way, posted detach-
</p>
<p>ments at the places he considered the most impor-
</p>
<p>tant, arrived at the dock, the entrance to which he
</p>
<p>found unobstructed, and joined Verrina, who had al-
</p>
<p>ready, with his galley, attacked those of prince Do-
</p>
<p>ria. They were almost destitute of arms, and he
</p>
<p>took possession of them with ease ; but fearing that,
</p>
<p>in this confusion, the crew of the admiral's galley,
</p>
<p>where he heard considerable noise, would rise upon
</p>
<p>their guard, he hastened to give orders concerning
</p>
<p>it ; and, when he was on the point of entering that
</p>
<p>galley, the^pjank on which he passed overturned, and
</p>
<p>he fell into the sea. His armor, which was heavy,
</p>
<p>and the mud, which in this place was deep, prevent-
</p>
<p>ed him from rising again to the surface : and the dark-
</p>
<p>ness of the night, and the noise on every side, con-
</p>
<p>cealed from those around him all knowledge of the
</p>
<p>accident ; so that, without knowing the loss they

<p>had sustained, they continued their ei^ertions, and

<p>at length gained possession of the harbor and the gal-
</p>
<p>lies.
</p>
<p>Ottoban, who, after executing the duty first assign-
</p>
<p>ed him, had repaired to this place, remained there to
</p>
<p>command ; and Jerome, who had followed him,
</p>
<p>posting Vincent Calcagno at the gate of St. Thomas,
</p>
<p>left tlie harbor, with two hundred men, to arouse the
</p>
<p>populace in the streets, and rally around him as many
</p>
<p>as he could. Verrina did the same in another direc-
</p>
<p>tion, and both having collected a multitude of people,
</p>
<p>no one dared to appear without declaring for Fiesco.
</p>
<p>The greater part of the nobility remained shut up at
</p>
<p>home during the commotion, each fearing the plunder
</p>
<p>of his house ; the most courageous repaired to the
</p>
<p>senate house, accompanied by the imperial ambassa-
</p>
<p>dor, who was on the point of flying from the city, but
</p>
<p>was prevented by the remonstrances of Paul Lasag-
</p>
<p>na, a man much respected by the people. Cardinal
</p>
<p>Doria, and Adam Centurione went thither also, and
</p>
<p>they, with Nicholas Franco,Jlhe chief of the republic,
</p>
<p>there being then no duke, resolved to despatch Bon-

<p>tlemen, they resumed their courage and returned, by

</p>
<p>well guarded, and were attacked with such vigor,
</p>
<p>that they retreated, leaving Boniface Lotnellino pris-
</p>
<p>oner, who distinguished himself, in this action, by his
</p>
<p>courage, and happily escaped from the conspirators.
</p>
<p>The Senate having found that nothing could he
</p>
<p>effected by force, had recourse to remonstrances..
</p>
<p>They deputed Jerome de Fiesco, a relation of the
</p>
<p>count, and Jerome Canevale to demand the reason
</p>
<p>of this commotion ; and immediately after. Cardinal
</p>
<p>Doria, who was allied to him, together with John
</p>
<p>Baptist Lercaro, and Bernard Castagna, both sena-
</p>
<p>tors, resolved, at the desire of the senate, to go and
</p>
<p>speak to the count and endeavor to appease him.
</p>
<p>But, perceiving that every thing was in such confu-
</p>
<p>sion that, if he ventured into the city, he should, with-
</p>
<p>out any prospect of advantage, expose his dignity to
</p>
<p>the insolence of a furious populace, he declined
</p>
<p>leaving the senate house. The senate then gave the
</p>
<p>same commission to Augustine Lomellino, Hector
</p>
<p>Fiesco, Ansaldo Justiniani, Ambrose Spinola, and
</p>
<p>John Balliano, who, perceiving a party of armed men
</p>
<p>coming towards them, supposed the count was among
</p>
<p>them, and stopped at St. Siro to wait for him. As
</p>
<p>soon as the conspirators saw them, they attacked
</p>
<p>them, and made Lomellino and Hector Fiesco flee.
</p>
<p>Ansaldi Justiniani stood firm, and, addressing Jerome,
</p>
<p>who led the party, he enquired, in the name of the
</p>
<p>republic, for the count. The conspirators had just
</p>
<p>learnt that he was dead. Verrina, after having, for

</p>
<p>galley in despair, hearing from all quarters that he
</p>
<p>was no where to be found. Jerome, therefore, bold-
</p>
<p>ly and very imprudently answered Justiniani, that it
</p>
<p>was now too late to seek for any count but himself,
</p>
<p>and demanded that the palace should be instantly
</p>
<p>surrendered to him.
</p>
<p>The^3enate, discovering from this reply that the
</p>
<p>count was dead, resumed their courage, and sent
</p>
<p>twelve gentlemen to rally as many of the guard, and
</p>
<p>of the people, as they could put in a posture of de-
</p>
<p>fence. Some, even of those most ardently attached
</p>
<p>to Fiesco, began to be alarmed. Many, who had not
</p>
<p>so much affection for Jerome as they had had for his
</p>
<p>brother, nor so much confidence in his talents, disper-
</p>
<p>sed the moment they heard of his death. Confusion
</p>
<p>entering the party of the conspirators, those in the
</p>
<p>senate house perceived it, and deliberated whether
</p>
<p>they should attack them, or negotiate with them.
</p>
<p>The first course was proposed as the most honorable,
</p>
<p>but the last was adopted as the most safe. Paul
</p>
<p>Pansa, a man of high consideration in the republic,
</p>
<p>and constant in his attachment to the family of Fiesco,
</p>
<p>was selected as the most proper agent for this pur-
</p>
<p>pose. The senate instructed him to offer to Jerome
</p>
<p>a full pardon for himself and all his accomplices. He
</p>
<p>consented, by the persuasions of Pansa, to accept
</p>
<p>these terms ; and the pardon was signed and sealed,
</p>
<p>with all the requisite formalities, by Ambrose Senare-
</p>
<p>gua, the secretary of the republic. Jerome thereup-

<p>where he was received with all imaginable honors.

<p>He went the next day to ihe senate, and in a violent

<p>speech, which he took cure siiouid be supported by

<p>made with the Fiescos, because it had been conclud-
</p>
<p>ed contrary to all precedent, and signed, as it were,

<p>ting subjects to treat, in this manner, with their sove-
</p>
<p>reign ; and insisted that to suffer a crime of this mag-
</p>
<p>nitude to pass unpunished would be an example fatal
</p>
<p>to the republic. In short, Andrew Doria concealed,
</p>
<p>with so much address, his private views under the
</p>
<p>veil of public good, and exerted so efficiently his au-
</p>
<p>thority to accomplish his desire of vengeance, that, al-

<p>public faith, the senate nevertheless declared all the

<p>CONSPIRACY OF FIESCO
</p>
<p>niiicent palace of Fiesco to be razed to the ground,
</p>
<p>condemned to death his brothers and the leaders of
</p>
<p>his party, banished, for fifty years, all who had the
</p>
<p>least concern in the enterprise, and decreed that Je-
</p>
<p>rome Fiesco should be ordered to surrender to the re-
</p>
<p>public the fortress of Montobio. -The last decree was
</p>
<p>not so easy to be executed as the others ; and as the
</p>
<p>place was strong, as well by its situation as its fortifi-
</p>
<p>cations, upon which the conspirators were constantly
</p>
<p>at work, they resolved, before they resorted to force,
</p>
<p>the success of which is always doubtful, to try all
</p>
<p>gentle means of inducing the Fiescos to surrender it,
</p>
<p>Paul Pansa was directed to repair thither immediate-
</p>
<p>ly, and to offer reasonable conditions to Jerome, on
</p>
<p>the part of the republic ; but he made no other re-
</p>
<p>ply than reproaches for the violation ol tneir soiemn
</p>
<p>engageinents, and an indignant refusal to enter into
</p>
<p>any treaty with the Genoese. The emperor, fearing
</p>
<p>that the French would obtain possession of this for-
</p>
<p>tress, which is Inghly important to the safety of Ge-
</p>
<p>noa, urged the senate to besiege it, and furnished, for
</p>
<p>this purpose, all  necessary assistance. Augustine
</p>
<p>Spinola, a commander of high reputation, invested
</p>
<p>the place, cannonaded ix for forty days, and compel-

<p>led those who were within it to surrender at discre-

<p>tion.

<p>met with, of having advised Jerome to conclude a ca-
</p>
<p>AGAINST GENOA. l67
</p>
<p>pitulatlon so little honorable to his courage. The
</p>
<p>capture of the place was the cause of new distrac-
</p>
<p>tions in the republic, the senators differing in opinion
</p>
<p>with regard to the punishment of the prisoners. Ma-
</p>
<p>ny, inclined to be merciful, were in favor of pardon-
</p>
<p>ing Jerome, on account of his youth ; and insisted
</p>
<p>that the family of Fiesco had been sufficiently punish-
</p>
<p>ed by the death of the count and the confiscation of
</p>
<p>all his property ; but the hatred of Andrew Doria
</p>
<p>prevailed once more over the clemency of the senate ;
</p>
<p>he procured a decree to be passed that Jerome Fi-
</p>
<p>esco, Verrina, Calcagno, and Assereto should be ex-
</p>
<p>ecuted, and one still more detestable against Ottoban,
</p>
<p>which prohibited his posterity, to the fifth generation,
</p>
<p>from approaching Genoa.
</p>
<p>Here let us stop, and consider particularly all that
</p>
<p>happened in the execution of this great design. Let
</p>
<p>us, if possible, deduce, from the numerous errors
</p>
<p>which we may perceive, examples of human weak-
</p>
<p>ness ; and let us acknowledge that this enterprise,
</p>
<p>which in its conception was a masterpiece of human
</p>
<p>courage and subtlety, exhibited in its progress and
</p>
<p>termination .the ordinary effects of the meanness and
</p>
<p>imperfection of our nature. How^dis^niCfiLful it was
</p>
<p>in Andrew Doria to abj_nd(?n the city, at the very be-
</p>
<p>ginning of the disturbance, without making the slight-
</p>
<p>est effort to quell, by his authority, the tumult of the
</p>
<p>populace ! What infatuation to disregard the informa-

<p>168 CONSPIRACY OP FIESCO
</p>
<p>to go alone, in the darkness of night, to the gate of
</p>
<p>St. Thomas, to appease a comnriotion, which he had
</p>
<p>no reason to despise, heing ignorant of the cause I
</p>
<p>What cowardice in Cardinal Doria, who dared not
</p>
<p>leave the senate house to awe the people hy the dig-
</p>
<p>nity of his station ! What imprudence in the senate to
</p>
<p>neglect assembling, on the first alarm, all their forces,
</p>
<p>to check the progress of the conspirators, merely-
</p>
<p>sending small detachments, which could effect noth-
</p>
<p>ing important ! And how ridiculous, in fine, it was
</p>
<p>to attempt to recal to his duty, by retnonstrances, an
</p>
<p>avowed rebel, with arms in his hands and superior
</p>
<p>in force 1 But having concluded a formal treaty, by
</p>
<p>what maxim can the senate be justified for violating
</p>
<p>the public faith so solemnly pledged to Jerome and
</p>
<p>Ottoban ? If the apprehension of similar treatment
</p>
<p>may be advantageous to a state, by restraining, with-
</p>
<p>in the bounds of duty, those who have an inclination
</p>
<p>ty revolt, it may also be pernicious, by depriving of
</p>
<p>all hope of pardon those who have revolted. And it
</p>
<p>is, indeed, difficult to comprehend, why those politi-
</p>
<p>cians, who were considered able men, were not ap-
</p>
<p>prehensive of driving to despair, by this example, Je-
</p>
<p>rome Fiesco, who still held the rock of Montobio,
</p>
<p>which he might surrender into the hands of foreign-
</p>
<p>ers, and the loss of which must have been followed
</p>
<p>by the destruction of Genoa.

<p>AGAINST GENOA. l69
</p>
<p>after they had lost their chief. His valor and pru-
</p>
<p>dence, which animated and directed his party, vanish-
</p>
<p>ing at his death, confusion ensued, which completed
</p>
<p>their ruin. Jerome, who ought, for many reasons, to
</p>
<p>have concealed the death of his brother, was the first
</p>
<p>to announce it, and thereby revived the courage of
</p>
<p>his enemies, and threw dismay into the ranks of his
</p>
<p>friends. Ottobaii^^Verrina, Calcagno and Sacco, who
</p>
<p>escaped in t^hegallej^ set at liberty^ almost as soon
</p>
<p>as they had left Genoa, the prisoners they had made,
</p>
<p>without reflecting that they might be of great use in
</p>
<p>effecting their accommodation. Verrina, when in-
</p>
<p>formed of the death of the count, fled, and shame-
</p>
<p>fully abandoned an important enterprise to the direc-
</p>
<p>tion of Jerome, who had neither sufficient experience,
</p>
<p>nor sufficient authority over the conspirators, to com-
</p>
<p>plete it. This same Jerome made a treaty with the
</p>
<p>senate, and consented to return to the condition of a
</p>
<p>private citizen, after having been on the point of be-
</p>
<p>coming a sovereign. He afterwards made a disgrace-
</p>
<p>ful capitulation in Montobio, confiding in the faith of
</p>
<p>those who had already violated their engagements.
</p>
<p>Verrina, Calcagno and Sacco, the principal actors in
</p>
<p>this conspiracy, and the most criminal of all the ac-
</p>
<p>complices of the count, persuaded Jerome, from the
</p>
<p>hope of impunity which they indulged, to commit
</p>
<p>this unworthy action, preferring rather to run the
</p>
<p>hazard of dying by the hands of an executioner, than
</p>
<p>to meet an honorable death in a breach.

<p>170 CONSPIRACY OF FIESCO
</p>
<p>John Lewis Fiesco, count of Lavagna, whom some
</p>
<p>honor with splendid eulogiums, whom others censure,
</p>
<p>and whom many excuse. If we regard the maxim,
</p>
<p>which commands us always to respect the actual gov-
</p>
<p>ernment under which we Hve, his ambition, without
</p>
<p>doubt, was criminal ; if we consider his courage, and
</p>
<p>the brilliant qualities which shone forth in the man-
</p>
<p>agement of his enterprise, it appears noble and gene-
</p>
<p>rous ; if we regard the power of the Dorias which
</p>
<p>gave him good reason to apprehend the ruin of the
</p>
<p>republic and of himself, it appears excusable. But
</p>
<p>in whatever manner it may be spoken of, the most
</p>
<p>prejudiced cannot deny that all the ill they can say
</p>
<p>of him may also be said of the most illustrious men.
</p>
<p>He was born in a small state, where all subordinate
</p>
<p>stations were beneath his aspirations and his merit ;
</p>
<p>the restlessness natural to his countrymen, ever in-
</p>
<p>clined to novelty, the elevation of his own mind, his
</p>
<p>youth, his immense wealth, the number and the adu-
</p>
<p>lation of his friends, the attachment of the people, the
</p>
<p>respect shown him by foreign princes, and, in fine,
</p>
<p>the esteem of all men, were circumstances peculiarly
</p>
<p>adapted to inspire with ambition a mind less ardent
</p>
<p>than his. The result of his enterprise was one of
</p>
<p>those accidents which human wisdom cannot foresee.
</p>
<p>Had his success been equal to the vigor and talent
</p>
<p>he displayed, his courage and destiny might have
</p>
<p>raised him higher than the sovereignty of Genoa; and
</p>
<p>those who, since his death, have vilified his memory,

</p>
<p>would have been, while he lived, the first to sing his

</p>
<p>praises. Those authors who, to gratify the hatred of
</p>
<p>the Dorias, and to justify the senate for their breach
</p>
<p>of faith, have aspersed him with the blackest calum-
</p>
<p>nies, would then have composed his panegyric, and
</p>
<p>posterity would have placed him in the number of
</p>
<p>the heroes of his age. So true it is, that good or ill
</p>
<p>success is the ordinary criterion by which praise or
</p>
<p>censure is apphed to extraordinary actions. Never-
</p>
<p>theless, I think it may be said, consistently with the
</p>
<p>duty of a historian who pronounces judgment upon
</p>
<p>the reputations of men, that nothing was wanting to
</p>
<p>establish that of John Lewis Fiesco but a longer life,
