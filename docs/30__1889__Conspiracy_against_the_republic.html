<p>CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE REPUBLIC.
</p>
<p>BLAIR AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
</p>
<p>Too many amendments to the Constitution are contemplated,
</p>
<p>and it is not clear that too many have not already been made.
</p>
<p>The first eight amendments, which may be called the Nation-
</p>
<p>al Bill of Rights, were of doubtful necessity or utility. Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Hamilton who, on account of his consummate wisdom,
</p>
<p>and because of his tact and skill in carrying the grand work
</p>
<p>through some of its most difficult stages, has been called "the
</p>
<p>Father of the Constitution," thought, that as the very purpose
</p>
<p>of the Constitution was to secure the blessings of liberty,
</p>
<p>this declaration was a better recognition of popular rights than
</p>
<p>that contained in the elaborate declaration of rights in every
</p>
<p>State Constitution. The same idea is embodied in the reason
</p>
<p>given in "The Federalist," why the Constitution had not given
</p>
<p>a bill of rights; because the reservation of powers without a
</p>
<p>bill of rights, was larger than a reservation of powers with
</p>
<p>a bill of rights.
</p>
<p>Several of the States however, were fearful that too much
</p>
<p>power would be claimed and exercised by the new government
</p>
<p>which was being formed. They insisted upon amendments,
</p>
<p>which should guard the rights of the States and of the people
</p>
<p>against encroachments of federal power. Such amendments
</p>
<p>were proposed by several of the States, and though they were
</p>
<p>not made conditional to the ratification of the Constitution,
</p>
<p>there was a general understanding that those of them which
</p>
<p>were considered of most importance, would be adopted.

</p>
<p>142 The Chicago Law Times.
</p>
<p>In New York, au effort was made to make the amendments
</p>
<p>conditional, and was only defeated by a vote of 31 to 27.
</p>
<p>After the first eight amendments, constituting- the Bill of
</p>
<p>Eights, had been tacitly agreed upon, it was feared that the
</p>
<p>very adoption of these might raise an implication that they
</p>
<p>contained all that the people would insist upon as against the
</p>
<p>Government; hence a ninth was thought necessary, as follows:
</p>
<p>"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be con-
</p>
<p>strued to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
</p>
<p>To this was added a tenth, as follows:
</p>
<p>"The powers not granted to the United States by the Constitution, nor
</p>
<p>prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively or to
</p>
<p>the people."
</p>
<p>These ten amendments were, at various times, from 1789 to
</p>
<p>1791 ,adopted in a body.
</p>
<p>The eleventh Amendment was occasioned by the decision of
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Chis-
</p>
<p>holm, Exr. v. Georgia, 2 Dallas' Rep. p. 419.
</p>
<p>This was a suit brought by a citizen of South Carolina
</p>
<p>aeainst the State of Georgia; and the question was, whether
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court had jurisdiction in case of a suit brought
</p>
<p>against a State by a citizen of another State.
</p>
<p>The question was argued at the February Term, 1793, and
</p>
<p>decided by five judges to one, in favor of the jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>The decision caused a good deal of excitement. Hence the
</p>
<p>Eleventh Amendment, as follows:
</p>
<p>"The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend
</p>
<p>to any suit in law or equity, commenoed or prosecuted against one of the
</p>
<p>United States by citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects of any
</p>
<p>foreign State."
</p>
<p>This was proposed by Congress in 1794, and was declared in
</p>
<p>force January 8, 1798.

</p>
<p>The occasion of the Twelfth Amendment was, the bitter
</p>
<p>struggle in Congress to determine who should be President,
</p>
<p>after the presidential election of 1800. The excitement which
</p>
<p>had been caused by the long contest in the House, resulting in
</p>
<p>the election of Jefferson, had made apparent the necessity of a
</p>
<p>change in the mode of electing President.
</p>
<p>Conspiracy against the Republic. 143
</p>
<p>The Amendment was proposed December 12, 1803, and pro-
</p>
<p>claimed September 25, 1804.
</p>
<p>Then eame a long period of quiet so far as constitutional
</p>
<p>changes were concerned; a quiet which lasted over sixty years.
</p>
<p>Not until about the close of the civil war was there any fur-
</p>
<p>ther amendment.
</p>
<p>The Thirteenth Amendment, proclaimed ratified, in Decem-
</p>
<p>ber, 1865, declared that neither slavery nor involuntary servi-
</p>
<p>tude, except as a punishment for crime, should exist within
</p>
<p>the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>The word slave was not in the Constitution, and though
</p>
<p>slavery existed in this country when the Constitution was
</p>
<p>formed, it was expected that the Slave States would soon adopt
</p>
<p>measures looking toward gradual emancipation. The incon-
</p>
<p>sistency of slavery with the fundamental law, was felt and fre-
</p>
<p>quently adverted to. By general consent the Constitution was
</p>
<p>so framed that when slavery should be abolished, the charter of
</p>
<p>our government would be found perfectly adapted to the new
</p>
<p>order of things, and posterity would look in vain into the
</p>
<p>Constitution for any evidence that such a system as slavery had
</p>
<p>existed.
</p>
<p>Such being the case, the Thirteenth Amendment, except as
</p>
<p>a sanction of the Emancipation Proclamation rendered necessa-
</p>
<p>ry by the war, and as a guaranty that it should be carried into
</p>
<p>effect, would not have been necessary.
</p>
<p>The suffrage amendments introduced a new departure in the
</p>
<p>relation of the States to the general government.
</p>
<p>The theory of our government in its organization was, that
</p>
<p>the regulation of the suffrage and the conditions upon which
</p>
<p>it should be exercised, should, with certain exceptions, be left
</p>
<p>to the control of the States. In each State the citizen may
</p>
<p>contend and justly contend that suffrage is a right of citizen-
</p>
<p>ship ; that as a citizen of the State he is entitled to the suffrage
</p>
<p>as a matter of right, subject to uniform regulations in common

</p>
<p>with other citizens. But this contention is between him and
</p>
<p>the State government; between him and the electors in his
</p>
<p>own State. As a citizen of the United States, all the right he
</p>
<p>had, previous to the war, in regard to the suffrage, was, to

<p>144 J 1 }^ Chicago Law Times.
</p>
<p>claim the benefit of the second section of the fourth Article
</p>
<p>of the Constitution, and the right, under the second section of
</p>
<p>the first Article, to vote for Congressmen.
</p>
<p>The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, having been
</p>
<p>adopted as a part of the reconstruction measures rendered nec-
</p>
<p>essary by the war, introduced a radical change in this respect
</p>
<p>in our form of government. The Fourteenth, declared ratified
</p>
<p>in the summer of 1868, prescribes a penalty for denying the
</p>
<p>suffrage to certain classes of citizens, while the Fifteenth, pro-
</p>
<p>claimed in March, 1870, substantially guaranties the elective
</p>
<p>franchise to those classes in all the States, at all general elec-
</p>
<p>tions, State as well as national.
</p>
<p>From this brief history of the amendments made up to the
</p>
<p>present time, it will sufficiently appear that the first ten were
</p>
<p>substantially a part of the original Constitution, while the
</p>
<p>last five have been made to meet certain exigencies in the his-
</p>
<p>tory and administration of the government.
</p>
<p>The civil war rendered necessary the exercise of extraordina-'
</p>
<p>ry powers on the part of the general government, for its own
</p>
<p>preservation. But it did not entirely change our form of gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, nor did it destroy the autonomy of the Southern
</p>
<p>States. Their continued existence as States was implied in the
</p>
<p>very term "reconstruction."
</p>
<p>No Eepublic with a single government  what may be called
</p>
<p>a centralized republic  has ever endured for any considerable
</p>
<p>period of time, except San Marino, a Republic of 22 square
</p>
<p>miles in extent, and containing about eight thousand inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants; and no federative or non-centralized republic has en-
</p>
<p>dured for any great length of time ; those now in existence be-
</p>
<p>ing all of comparatively recent formation.
</p>
<p>The republican form of government is, therefore, still upon
</p>
<p>trial.
</p>
<p>Of the federative republics which have perished, the two
</p>
<p>most notable examples have been, the Grecian States under

</p>
<p>the Achaian League, and the Hanseatic Federation. While
</p>
<p>other things contributed to the downfall of these republics, no
</p>
<p>candid inquirer can fail to come to the conclusion that one
</p>
<p>of the most potent causes was the difficulty of maintaining
</p>
<p>Conspiracy against the Republic. 145
</p>
<p>a proper balance of power between the general and local gov-
</p>
<p>ernments.
</p>
<p>The Fathers of our Republic studied carefully this balance of
</p>
<p>power, and guided by the light of history, they placed such
</p>
<p>safeguards against encroachments of federal jurisdiction on the
</p>
<p>one hand, and against usurpation of power by the States on
</p>
<p>the other, that the mixed government thus established has, for
</p>
<p>a hundred years, commanded the respect and admiration of
</p>
<p>the world. There is every reason to believe that the perpe-
</p>
<p>tuity of the Republic depends largely upon the preservation of
</p>
<p>this balance of power.
</p>
<p>To say that the Federal Government is one of delegated
</p>
<p>powers, is simply to repeat what every student well under-
</p>
<p>stands. But the powers of the State Government are inherent
</p>
<p>in the people of the State, and in the State Legislature, as
</p>
<p>representing the people. There are certain limitations placed
</p>
<p>upon the exercise of that power. Some of these limitations
</p>
<p>have been established by the people of the United States in the
</p>
<p>Federal Constitution  some by the people of the State in the
</p>
<p>State Constitution  others necessarily result from a republican
</p>
<p>form of government. But within these limitations the States
</p>
<p>are sovereign. They possess what has been well designated by
</p>
<p>jurists as quasi-sovereignty : while as to foreign States or com-
</p>
<p>munities, the people of the United States, represented by the
</p>
<p>Federal Government, constitute the State.
</p>
<p>This State sovereignty, except as limited in the manner de-
</p>
<p>scribed, should be sacredly respected. It is just as dangerous
</p>
<p>for the Federal Government to. encroach upon the rights of the
</p>
<p>States as it would be for the States to usurp the power of the
</p>
<p>general Government. Every disturbance of this balance of
</p>
<p>power is fraught with danger to our institutions.
</p>
<p>The motto of Illinois is, "State Sovereignty National Un-
</p>
<p>ion." But the States can maintain their sovereignty only by
</p>
<p>acting in concert. Let, therefore, the motto of Kentucky be

</p>
<p>added, "United we stand  divided we fall."
</p>
<p>Every amendment to the Constitution is a change in our form
</p>
<p>of government; and every change tending to the centralization
</p>
<p>of power, is a blow at the liberties of the people. Under our
</p>
<p>146 The Chicago Law Times.
</p>
<p>form of government, the rights and liberties of the citizens can
</p>
<p>only be preserved by maintaining the rights of the States.
</p>
<p>Let the people once become habituated to surrendering the
</p>
<p>rights of their States to the general Government, and they will
</p>
<p>soou reconcile themselves to the surrender to the same power,
</p>
<p>of their rights as individuals.
</p>
<p>The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, taking jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion over subjects which, under our system of government,
</p>
<p>were, with the exceptions stated, under the control of the
</p>
<p>States, could only be justified by the condition of the country
</p>
<p>after the war, and should not be regarded as precedents for the
</p>
<p>still further derangement of our federative system.
</p>
<p>The Blair Amendment, proposed in a time of profound peace,
</p>
<p>is a plain encroachment upon the rights of the States, and is
</p>
<p>not called for by any such emergency as gave rise to the other
</p>
<p>amendments. The right to legislate upon the subject of ed-
</p>
<p>ucation, is in that vast reservoir of rights which are reserved to
</p>
<p>the States, not only by the 10th Amendment but by our very
</p>
<p>form of government.
</p>
<p>The original Constitution gave to Congress no power over
</p>
<p>the subject of religion or of education. The Blair Amendment
</p>
<p>proposes for the first time to give Congress such power.
</p>
<p>Where is this encroachment upon the rights of the States to
</p>
<p>stop?
</p>
<p>The joint resolution introduced by Senator Blair, proposing
</p>
<p>his Amendment, provides, that
</p>
<p>"Each State in this Union shall establish and maintain a system of free
</p>
<p>public schools adequate for the education of all the children living therein,
</p>
<p>between the ages of six and sixteen years, inclusive, in the common
</p>
<p>branches of knowledge, and in virtue, morality, and the principles of the
</p>
<p>Christian religion."
</p>
<p>What are the principles of the Christian religion? If the
</p>
<p>question could be determined by reference to the teachings of
</p>
<p>Christ, there would be less difficulty attending the matter.

</p>
<p>But Jesus had far less to do in establishing the Christian religion
</p>
<p>than Paul ; and Paul said, "If any one preach any other gospel
</p>
<p>unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed."
</p>
<p>Is this one of the principles of the Christian religion? It was
</p>
<p>the hypocrites whom Jesus denounced ; but Paul denounced also
</p>
<p>Conspiracy against the Republic. 147
</p>
<p>those who honestly differed with him in opinion.
</p>
<p>In some respects Paul was one of the most remarkable men
</p>
<p>that ever lived. In his moments of enthusiasm and of spiritual
</p>
<p>exaltation, he gave forth some of the grandest utterances re-
</p>
<p>corded in the pages of history. Nevertheless he was a persecu-
</p>
<p>tor, by temperament and practice. Before his conversion he
</p>
<p>had persecuted the Christians, making havoc of the church,
</p>
<p>entering into every house, haling men and women, and com-
</p>
<p>mitting them to prison, (Acts 8. 3), pursuing them relentless-
</p>
<p>ly, even unto death. (Acts 2b\ 10.)
</p>
<p>There is sufficient reason to believe that in this respect his
</p>
<p>nature, after conversion, was essentially the same as before.
</p>
<p>He hurls his anathema at heretics, not only in the passage cited,
</p>
<p>(Gal. 1. 8, 9), but in various others. In 1 Cor. 16. 22, he
</p>
<p>says, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him
</p>
<p>be anathema maran-atha." In 2 Thess. 1. 8, he pictures the
</p>
<p>Lord Jesus as "taking vengeance" on those who obey not his
</p>
<p>gospel. In 1 Tim. 1. 20, he says that Hymeneus and Alexan-
</p>
<p>der, who had departed from the faith, he had "delivered unto
</p>
<p>Satan." In 2 Tim. 4. 14: "Alexander the coppersmith did me
</p>
<p>much evil; the Lord reward him according to his works." In
</p>
<p>Titus 1. 11, referring to those in the church who were unruly,
</p>
<p>and vain talkers and deceivers, he declares that their "mouths
</p>
<p>must be stopped," and in Galatians, 5. 12, he says, "7 would
</p>
<p>they were even cat of, who trouble you."
</p>
<p>An attempt has been made to break the force of this passage,
</p>
<p>by claiming that the apostle meant only that the offenders
</p>
<p>should be cut off from the church ; but that he had power to di-
</p>
<p>rect. This is something which he "would" could be done.
</p>
<p>The Greek verb is apokopsontai, from kopto, "to strike, smite,
</p>
<p>cut." Apokopto, "to cut off, to hew off." It is manifest
</p>
<p>that the words "I would that they were even cut off," had
</p>
<p>a deeper significance than mere expulsion from the church, com-
</p>
<p>ing as they did, from one who had been accustomed to perse-

<p>cute even unto death, those holding a different religious faith
</p>
<p>from his own.
</p>
<p>This disposition of Paul must have been well understood by
</p>
<p>the author of the story related in Acts 13. 8-11, where the
</p>
<p>148 The Chicago Law Times.
</p>
<p>apostle is represented as punishing with blindness that "child
</p>
<p>of the devil," Elymas, who withstood Paul, seeking to turn
</p>
<p>away the deputy from the faith.
</p>
<p>The inquisition, which did its bloody work for so many hun-
</p>
<p>dred years, like every thing else, had a cause. It found at
</p>
<p>least some excuse in the fierce denunciations of heretics by
</p>
<p>Paul, and in the reported killing of Ananias and Sapphira
</p>
<p>at the word of Peter. As late as the middle of the present
</p>
<p>century, an approved Catholic historian commented upon this
</p>
<p>transaction in the following - terms :
</p>
<p>"The sudden death with which they [Ananias and Sapphira] were smitten
</p>
<p>at the feet of the prince of the apostles, demonstrated to the faithful, that
</p>
<p>they could not with impunity deceive the ministers of the Lord."  (Darras,
</p>
<p>Hist. Cath. Ch. vol. 1, p. 31.)
</p>
<p>The History of the Church by Darras, was indorsed by Pope
</p>
<p>Pius IX, August 8, 1855.
</p>
<p>The inquisition found still further support in a document
</p>
<p>in general circulation in the early ages of the church, and then
</p>
<p>considered of high authority. It was called the Epistle of
</p>
<p>Clement to James; and a translation of it may be found in the
</p>
<p>1.7th volume of the Ante-Mcene Christian Library.
</p>
<p>In this epistle Clement describes his ordination. He says
</p>
<p>when Peter was about to die, the brethren being assembled,
</p>
<p>(at Rome), he laid his hands on Clement, as the Bishop, and
</p>
<p>communicated to him the power of binding and loosing, etc.,
</p>
<p>and as to him who should grieve the President of the truth,
</p>
<p>after declaring that such a one sins against Christ, and offends
</p>
<p>the Father of all, Peter proceeded as follows:
</p>
<p>"Wherefore, he shall not live : and therefore it becomes him who presides,
</p>
<p>to hold the place of a physician ; and not to cherish the rage of an irration-
</p>
<p>al beast."
</p>
<p>When, afterward, the Church, having grown strong and
</p>
<p>dominant, found itself possessed of civil power, or safe from in-
</p>
<p>terference, what more natural than that it should undertake to

</p>
<p>rid itself of those making trouble in the church by employing
</p>
<p>the means for which it found such sanction?
</p>
<p>The Spanish inquisition of the 15th century was the successor
</p>
<p>of the Dominican inquisition of the 13th century. This in
</p>
<p>its turn was the legitimate outgrowth of the papal and episcopal
</p>
<p>Conspiracy against the Republic. 149
</p>
<p>persecutions of the preceding ages, which had been continued,
</p>
<p>with but little interruption from the edict of Constantine in
</p>
<p>316, against the Donatists, and that of Theodosius, in 382,
</p>
<p>against the Manichaaans, who were punished with confiscation
</p>
<p>and death. Thus has persecution been a handmaid of the
</p>
<p>Church for fourteen hundred years, commencing at a period
</p>
<p>but little removed from the time of the apostles. No other re-
</p>
<p>ligion, in the history of the world, has been attended with
</p>
<p>so much persecution.
</p>
<p>Nor has it been confined to the Roman Catholic Church.
</p>
<p>Nearly every sect of the Christian religion has sought to defend
</p>
<p>and strengthen itself by persecution, whenever it has found it-
</p>
<p>self armed with the sword of civil authority. The bloody per-
</p>
<p>secutions of the Catholics by Protestants in Great Britain and
</p>
<p>elsewhere, are well known to every student of history. Equal-
</p>
<p>ly well known are the persecutions of the Baptists, Quakers
</p>
<p>and others in this country.
</p>
<p>Among the laws of Connecticut of 1650, are the following:
</p>
<p>"If any man or woman be a Witch, that is, hath or consultcth with, a fa-
</p>
<p>milliar spiritt, they shall be put to death."  (Exodus 22. 18, Levit. 20. 27,
</p>
<p>Deut. 18. 10, 11.)
</p>
<p>"If any man after legal conviction, shall have or worship any other God
</p>
<p>than the Lord God, bee shall bee put to death;' (Deut. 13. 617. 2, Ex.
</p>
<p>22. 20.)
</p>
<p>Among the laws of Massachusetts (General Laws of Ply-
</p>
<p>mouth, published in 1658), is one reciting that "of late time the
</p>
<p>Quakers have bine furnished with horses, and therby they have
</p>
<p>not onely the more speedy passage from place to place, to
</p>
<p>the poisoning of the inhabitants with theire cursed tenetts,
</p>
<p>but alsoe therby have escaped the hands of the officers that
</p>
<p>might otherwise have apprehended them;" it was therefore en-
</p>
<p>acted that the horses furnished them or which were brought in-
</p>
<p>to the country by them should be forfeited to the Government.

<p>If any person should permit a meeting of Quakers in his

<p>The following may be taken as a specimen of the laws en-
</p>
<p>acted under a religious rule:
</p>
<p>If any man had a stubborn or rebellious son 16 years or more
</p>
<p>of age, he or the mother could bring him before the magistrates,
</p>
<p>and "such a son shall be put to death."  (Deut. 21. 20, 21.)
</p>
<p>See Conn. Blue Laws of 1650.
</p>
<p>Here was a cruel and inhuman enactment of a distant land,
</p>
<p>thousands of years old, brought to this country and put into
</p>
<p>the form of law, because it was found within the lids of a re-
</p>
<p>ligious book. Could any thing more vividly illustrate the
</p>
<p>danger of religious legislation? And having once accomplished
</p>
<p>the divorce of Church and State, shall we now take the back
</p>
<p>track, with such beacon warnings before us?
</p>
<p>In the "Establishment of Civil Government by the free
</p>
<p>planters of the Colony of New Haven," June 4, 1639, it was
</p>
<p>enacted,
</p>
<p>"That Church Members only shall be free Burgesses, and they only shall
</p>
<p>chuse magistrates," etc.  (Conn. Code of 1650, p. 18.)
</p>
<p>What guaranty have we that this law of suffrage will not
</p>
<p>be re-enacted, if the Church gets control of the State?
</p>
<p>That we have no such guaranty is manifest. Listen to an
</p>
<p>exponent of the national reform religion, writing in the Chris-
</p>
<p>tian Statesman of November 1, 1883:
</p>
<p>"What effect would the adoption of the Christian Amendment, together
</p>
<p>with the proposed changes in the Constitution, have upon those who deny
</p>
<p>that God is the- Sovereign, Christ the Euler, and the Bible the law? This
</p>
<p>brings up the conscience question at once. * * The classes who would
</p>
<p>object are, as 'Truth Seeker' has said, Jews, infidels, atheists and others.
</p>
<p>These classes are perfectly satisfied with the Constitution as it is. How
</p>
<p>would they stand toward it. if it recognized the authority of our Lord
</p>
<p>Jesus Christ? To be perfectly plain, I believe that the existence of a
</p>
<p>Christian Constitution would disfranchise every logically consistent infi-
</p>
<p>del."

<p>writing upon the same subject said : "The worst result will be
</p>
<p>to disfranchise them."
</p>
<p>Those who are endeavoring to establish a National religion,
</p>
<p>do not admit that they are working for a union of Church and
</p>
<p>State, but at the same time they advocate the supremacy of
</p>
<p>the Church over the State. They avow their purpose to bring
</p>
<p>Conspiracy against the Republic. 151
</p>
<p>the whole land under the control of a religion the principles of
</p>
<p>which would have to be authoritatively determined.
</p>
<p>President Seelye, of Amherst College, in an article published
</p>
<p>in the "Forum," for July, 1886, entitled, "Should the State
</p>
<p>teach Religion?" (a question which he answers in the affirma-
</p>
<p>tive), after stating that religious instruction of a people is
</p>
<p>indispensable, and that the family would not and could not
</p>
<p>provide it, also that "the Church is confessedly not doing this
</p>
<p>work, and unless you give it the ubiquity and power of the
</p>
<p>State, the Church neither will nor can do it," said :
</p>
<p>"The State should provide for instruction in the Gospels for its own pre-
</p>
<p>servation; if the conscience of its subjects approve, well ; if not. the State
</p>
<p>will be cautious, but courageous also, and if it is wise, it will not falter."
</p>
<p>The word "subjects" was well chosen by President Seelye to
</p>
<p>designate the citizens of a free country, whom he proposes
</p>
<p>to bring under his religio-political despotism.
</p>
<p>~ In a speech in Kansas City, Sam Small, a prominent worker
</p>
<p>in this movement, said :
</p>
<p>"I want to see the day come when the Church shall be the arbiter of all
</p>
<p>legislation, State, National and municipal; when the great churches of the
</p>
<p>country can come together harmoniously and issue their edict, and the
</p>
<p>legislative powers will respect it and enact it into laws."
</p>
<p>In March, 1884, Rev. J. W. Foster, in the columns of the
</p>
<p>Christian Statesman, said:
</p>
<p>"According to the Scriptures, the State and its sphere exist for the sake
</p>
<p>of and to serve the interests of the Church. * * The expenses of the
</p>
<p>Church in carrying on her public aggressive work, it meets in whole or in
</p>
<p>part out of the public treasury.'"
</p>
<p>What is this in fact but a union of Church and State, ex-
</p>
<p>cept that the Church instead of the State is to be in the as-
</p>
<p>cendency? The change of conditions would be far from being
</p>
<p>an improvement.
</p>
<p>The editor of the Statesman does not advocate' union of
</p>
<p>Church and State; but says:

<p>"It is the duty of the State, as such, to enter into alliance with the Church
</p>
<p>of Christ, and to profess, adhere to, defend and maintain the true religion."
</p>
<p>The spirit of the inquisition is not yet extinct, nor are its
</p>
<p>methods entirely foreign to the purposes of many of those en-
</p>
<p>gaged in this religious crusade against the Constitution. Their
</p>
<p>152 The Chicago Law Times.
</p>
<p>hearts are filled with bitterness and hatred toward those who
</p>
<p>differ with them in opinion in religions matters. They would
</p>
<p>fain strike them to the earth as Peter was supposed to have
</p>
<p>struck Ananias and Sapphira.
</p>
<p>Rev. E. B. Graham, one of the Vice Presidents of the Na-
</p>
<p>tional Reform Association, an organization whose special ob-
</p>
<p>ject is to secure an amendment to the Constitution, making
</p>
<p>Christianity the national religion, said in an address delivered
</p>
<p>at York, Nebraska, reported in the Christian Statesman of
</p>
<p>May 21, 1885:
</p>
<p>"If the opponents of the bible do not like our government and its Chris-
</p>
<p>tian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land, and in the name of
</p>
<p>the devil, and for the sake of the devil, subdue it, and set up a government
</p>
<p>of their own on infidel and atheistic ideas; and then if they can stand it,
</p>
<p>stay there till they die."
</p>
<p>At Lake Side, Ohio, in August, 1887, Dr. McAllister said:
</p>
<p>"Those who oppose this work now will discover, when the religious
</p>
<p>amendment is made to the Constitution, that if they do not see fit to fall in
</p>
<p>with the majority, they must abide the consequences, or seek some more
</p>
<p>congenial clime."
</p>
<p>In a speech in a Convention of the same National Reform
</p>
<p>Association, held in New York, in February, 1873, Rev. Jona-
</p>
<p>than Edwards, D. D., said:
</p>
<p>"We want State and religion  and we are going to have it. It shall be
</p>
<p>that so far as the affairs of State require religion, it shall be revealed re-
</p>
<p>ligion, the religion of Jesus Christ. * * * The atheist is a dangerous
</p>
<p>man. * * Tolerate atheism, Sir! There is nothing out of hell I would
</p>
<p>not tolerate as soon. * * Atheism and Christianity are contradictory
</p>
<p>terms. They are incompatible systems. They cannot dwell together on
</p>
<p>the same continent."
</p>
<p>The spirit here exhibited is the same as that which left its
</p>
<p>footprints in the "Blue Laws" of several of the American
</p>
<p>Colonies. It is inherited from the inquisition, and turns for its
</p>
<p>justification or excuse to the teachings of those who founded

</p>
<p>the Christian religion.
</p>
<p>Those animated by this spirit, can even coolly contemplate
</p>
<p>the contingency of a war, to be prosecuted for the establish-
</p>
<p>ment of the Christian Religion. Said Rev. M. A. Gault, in the
</p>
<p>Statesman of April 1, 1886, "It cost us all our civil war to
</p>
<p>blot slavery out of our Constitution, and it may cost us another
</p>
<p>Conspiracy against the Republic. 153
</p>
<p>war to blot out its infidelity."
</p>
<p>In reference to this phase of the subject, a timely warning
</p>
<p>was given by Mr. Abbott, editor of the Index, in a protest
</p>
<p>against the movement, which he was permitted to present at
</p>
<p>the National Convention of the National Reform Association,
</p>
<p>held in Cincinnati in 1872: He said:
</p>
<p>"I make no threat whatever, but I state a truth fixed as the hills when I
</p>
<p>say, that before you can carry this measure and trample on the freedom of
</p>
<p>the people, you will have to wade through seas of blood. Every man who
</p>
<p>favors it votes to precipitate the most frightful war of modern times."
</p>
<p>To accomplish their purpose, the fanatics who are engaged
</p>
<p>in this enterprise, are willing to unite with those whom they
</p>
<p>and their ancestors have been abusing for centuries  the Ro-
</p>
<p>man Catholics.
</p>
<p>"Whenever" said the Christian Statesman of Dec. 11, 1884,
</p>
<p>"they [the Roman Catholics] are willing to co-operate in resist-
</p>
<p>ing the political progress of atheism, we will gladly join hands
</p>
<p>with them."'
</p>
<p>In the Statesman of August 31, 1881, Rev. Sylvester F.
</p>
<p>Scovel said:
</p>
<p>"We may be subjected to some rebuffs in our first proffers, and the time
</p>
<p>has not yet come when the Roman Church will consent to strike hands
</p>
<p>with other churches as such; but the time has come to make repeated ad-
</p>
<p>vances, and gladly to accept co-operation in any form in which they may
</p>
<p>be willing to exhibit it. It is one of the necessities of the situation."
</p>
<p>Said Dr. A. A. Hodge, of Princeton, in an article in the
</p>
<p>Princeton Review, for January, 1887 :
</p>
<p>"All we have to do is for Catholics and Protestants disciples of a com-
</p>
<p>mon master  to come to a common understanding with respect to a com-
</p>
<p>mon basis of what is received as general Christianity; a practical quantity
</p>
<p>of truth belonging equally to both sides, to be recognized in general legis-
</p>
<p>lation, and especially in the literature and teaching of our public schools."
</p>
<p>Said the Christian Union, of the 26th of January, 1888:
</p>
<p>"It is quite possible that the time may come when the real issue will be

</p>
<p>between the theist and the atheist. * * Whenever that time comes, the
</p>
<p>Protestant and the Catholic will stand side by side in a common defense
</p>
<p>of those common beliefs which have been their mutual possession these
</p>
<p>many centuries."
</p>
<p>At the Saratoga National Reform meeting, August 1.0-17,.
</p>
<p>154 The Chicago Law Times.
</p>
<p>1887, a motion was adopted requesting- the National Reform
</p>
<p>Association to undertake to secure a basis of agreement with the
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic authorities. And these newly made friends
</p>
<p>are already working together in Washington, to forward the
</p>
<p>religious legislation there pending.
</p>
<p>Now who are the atheists, who, by this grand religio-politi-
</p>
<p>cal combination of orthodox Protestants and Roman Catholics,
</p>
<p>are to be driven from the country?
</p>
<p>Cousin, the eclectic philosopher, maintains, with a good deal
</p>
<p>of force, that properly speaking, there cannot be, in the last
</p>
<p>analysis, any such thing as atheism. He says:
</p>
<p>"It is sufficient for you to have the idea of the imperfect and the finite-
</p>
<p>in order to have the idea of the infinite and the perfect, that is of God ;
</p>
<p>though you may not thus name him ; though you may be able to express in
</p>
<p>words the spontaneous convictions of your intelligence, or for want of
</p>
<p>language and analysis, they may remain obscure and indistinct in the
</p>
<p>depths of your soul."  (Hist. Mod. Philosophy, vol. 2, p. 420.)
</p>
<p>This simple and beautiful explanation of Cousin, who, im-
</p>
<p>bued with the spirit of charity, would deny the possibility
</p>
<p>of atheism, is not acceptable to the religionists of the day.
</p>
<p>They must have atheists, and they must have the privilege of
</p>
<p>defining an atheist. An atheist is one whose idea of the Infi-
</p>
<p>nite is different from theirs. Or, an atheist is one who does
</p>
<p>not believe in a personal God. Or, an atheist is one who does
</p>
<p>not accept "Our Christ." Whatever may be the definition
</p>
<p>finally agreed upon  and it would have to be settled eventually
</p>
<p>by a Supreme Court chosen in the interests of the national re-
</p>
<p>ligion  an atheist, thus defined, is to be placed outside the
</p>
<p>Constitution ; is to be no longer entitled to the benefit of its
</p>
<p>provisions. He is to be disfranchised and outlawed, and driven
</p>
<p>from the country. Even those who did the most in founding
</p>
<p>our government, would not, if living, be permitted to partici-
</p>
<p>pate in its blessings.
</p>
<p>It is time the people arouse to a sense of the danger which is

</p>
<p>menaced to their free institutions, and realize the attempt
</p>
<p>which is being made against their liberties.
</p>
<p>Some of the religious journals oppose the movement; among
</p>
<p>others, the ably conducted American Sentinel, published at
</p>
<p>Oakland, California. The only considerable national organi-
</p>
<p>Conspiracy against the Republic. 155
</p>
<p>zation which is effectually making opposition, is the American
</p>
<p>Secular Union.
</p>
<p>It is a question that interests the so-called atheists not only
</p>
<p> it interests all classes. For no sooner will the Constitution
</p>
<p>be placed under the control of the Christian religion by the
</p>
<p>combined forces of Protestants and Catholics and it can be
</p>
<p>done in no other way  than the question will immediately
</p>
<p>arise, which of the allied armies best represents the Christian
</p>
<p>religion? The Catholics have the older title, having them-
</p>
<p>selves made the bible, and it may turn out that they will
</p>
<p>vindicate their right to control the Constitution. In that
</p>
<p>case those who originated the movement may find themselves
</p>
<p>called upon to drink of the cup which they had prepared for
</p>
<p>the atheists.
</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the Protestants should prevail, the
</p>
<p>next question will be, which branch of them, or which denomi-
</p>
<p>nation, or sect, or combination of sects, is best entitled to speak
</p>
<p>for the Christian religion, and therefore best entitled to say
</p>
<p>what shall be taught in the public schools under the amended
</p>
<p>Constitution?
</p>
<p>It is no answer to say that the Blair Amendment provides
</p>
<p>that no public money shall be expended for instruction or train-
</p>
<p>ing in the doctrines of any religious sect, and that such pe-
</p>
<p>culiar doctrines shall not be taught. The fact would still re-
</p>

<p>provision of the Amendment would be of but little practical

</p>
<p>Nor does it essentially detract from the dangerous character

<p>of the proposed Amendment, that the author has the incon-

<p>sistency to declare, in the first Section, that "No State shall

<p>religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This is a

<p>mere subterfuge. What more efficacious law respecting the

<p>trines- to the youth of the country?
</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical power has already lost its hold upon the
</p>
<p>reason and conscience of the masses. This attempt to get con-
</p>
<p>trol of the Constitution, is a desperate effort to bring the aid of
</p>
<p>the civil power to the support of a "lost cause."
</p>
<p>The attempt should meet with a prompt and merited rebuke.
</p>
<p>Let Church and State remain forever separate. Let us heed
</p>
<p>the maxims and warnings of the founders, the defenders, and
</p>
<p>the preservers of the Republic  of Madison and Hamilton, of
</p>
<p>Washington and Paine, of Jefferson, of Lincoln and of Grant.
</p>
<p>Let not a spirit of persecution worthy only of the middle
</p>
<p>ages, find sanction and encouragement under the stars and
</p>
<p>stripes, which have been dedicated to liberty. Let the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution remain what our fathers intended it to be, the com-
</p>
<p>mon heritage of a great, a generous and a free people.
