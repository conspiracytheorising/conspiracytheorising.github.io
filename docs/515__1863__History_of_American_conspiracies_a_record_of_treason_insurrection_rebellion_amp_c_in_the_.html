<p>PREFACE,
</p>
<p>The United States of America, in attaining their exalted position
</p>
<p>among nations, have not escaped local and national disorder.
</p>
<p>The history of Colonial times is rife with religious and political ex-
</p>
<p>citement, frequently associated with violence and revolution; the
</p>
<p>Aborigines have conspired, in numerous instances, for the extermina-
</p>
<p>tion of their white foes ; the Continental Confederation, accompanied
</p>
<p>with alarming distempers, was saved from a conflict of common-
</p>
<p>wealths only by the adoption of the Federal Constitution; and the
</p>
<p>Federation which made us one people has not accomplished its ends
</p>
<p>without occasional insurrections against its consolidated authority.
</p>
<p>In this volume I have embraced the story of such conspiracies, in-
</p>
<p>surrections and popular commotions as directly or indirectly aflected
</p>
<p>the order of society, the destiny of States, or the political institu-
</p>
<p>tions of the Republic. The table of contents will show what I con-
</p>
<p>ceive to have been such events. Those minor or purely local dis-
</p>
<p>turbances, which, though exciting episodes in State or Colonial
</p>
<p>history, yet contributed nothing of change to the order of historic
</p>
<p>events, I have passed with but a brief allusion in the Preliminary
</p>
<p>Chapter.
</p>
<p>Having for several years contemplated this work I entered upon
</p>
<p>its prej)aration with a good store of authorities, among which were
</p>
<p>several volumes of documents, letters, memoirs, &c., not accessible to
</p>
<p>the ordinary inquirer. These, with the generally available works on
</p>
<p>American History, have enabled me to produce what I hope will
</p>
<p>prove a satisfactory narrative of the interesting and important events
</p>
<p>considered.

</p>
<p>and the Paxton Riots I freely drew upon the thoroughly exhaustive
</p>
<p>viil PREFACE.
</p>
<p>work of Francis Parkman, Jr. His "History of the Conspiracy of
</p>
<p>Pontiac," is a very able and painstaking production. It has afforded
</p>
<p>to a class of scribblers for popular magazines matter for many an article,
</p>
<p>though the reader was not permitted to know who was plundered for
</p>
<p>their edification. The work of Mr. P. is one of the most valuable of all
</p>
<p>late contributions to American History.
</p>
<p>The chapter on Wilkinson's Conspiracy doubtless will excite astonish-
</p>
<p>ment in the reader's mind  it being so much at variance with the popu-
</p>
<p>lar estimates of the man and his services. I have studied the matter
</p>
<p>well, and conceive that the record here presented will stand the test of
</p>
<p>critical examination. If it does, then General James Wilkinson be-
</p>
<p>comes one of the dishonored among our public characters.
</p>
<p>Genet's Conspiracy and the Alien and Sedition Troubles I have treat-
</p>
<p>ed as exhaustively as the subjects seemed to demand. If the version
</p>
<p>presented reflects discredit upon the Anti-Federal faction, it is because
</p>
<p>the proofs against Genet and his coadjutors, of a design to paralyse the
</p>
<p>administrations of Washington and Adams, if not to overthrow the
</p>
<p>Federal Constitution, are, to our apprehension, incontestible. It is not
</p>
<p>an agreeable task to discrown men whom the public long has worship*-
</p>
<p>ped ; it is, indeed, presumptuous, even to attempt ; but, no writer is
</p>
<p>warranted in sui^pressiug truth, from personal considerations. If what
</p>
<p>is here set forth is not sustained in its assumptions and conclusions let
</p>
<p>it be put aside for what is better testimony, if such can be produced.
</p>
<p>Of Aaron Burr's Conspiracy I have sought to present the most complete
</p>
<p>narrative yet published. Having access to a great mass of evidence bearing
</p>
<p>upon the subject, I have not hesitated to use whatever came well au-
</p>
<p>thenticated, no matter whom it affected. The reader will see that
</p>
<p>" pure and disinterested patriot," General James Wilkinson, in a new
</p>
<p>role  that of defender of the integrity of his country. Thepaper will
</p>
<p>be found to embrace much incidental matter of interest not hitherto
</p>
<p>presented in connection with the operations of Burr.
</p>
<p>The Hartford Convention Conspiracy and the New England Discon-
</p>
<p>tents are subjected to a somewhat extended exposition. Their intimate
</p>
<p>and intricate relations to the general history of the country compels a

</p>
<p>PREFACE. IX
</p>
<p>of the sul)ject can do it justice. I liave endeavored to present it in its
</p>
<p>true liistoric light.
</p>
<p>The Negro Insurrections of Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner are j^ain-
</p>
<p>ful chapters to peruse, yet they possess a profound interest for all who
</p>
<p>care to understand the workings of the American slave system. In
</p>
<p>spite of a studious suppression of testimony by the authorities and
</p>
<p>the press, enough has transpired to show that the institution of invol-
</p>
<p>untary servitude has rested upon the bosom of a volcano.
</p>
<p>The Nullification Rebellion has had so much new light thrown upon
</p>
<p>it by recent events as to reduce its hitherto argumentative, and there-
</p>
<p>fore undefined, position to the condition of absolute demonstration. In
</p>
<p>the Secession Revolution we have the results of the asserted " rights"
</p>
<p>upon which the Nullification theory was founded, and therefore have
</p>
<p>the exact relations of Calhoun's theory and acts to society and to gov-
</p>
<p>ernment perfectly established. I have given the theme a full con-
</p>
<p>sideration, vie-wing it from a National rather than a local or State
</p>
<p>stand-point. Several hitherto unpublished documents are cited in
</p>
<p>this paper.
</p>
<p>The story of the sectional struggle in Kansas is given at much length.
</p>
<p>It is the first exposition of the kind yet offered  being a complete
</p>
<p>political and social record of the matter. Like the first South Caro-
</p>
<p>lina rebellion, the struggle in Kansas finds a fresh and conclusive
</p>
<p>comment in the Secession Revolution. We see in its incipient stages
</p>
<p>the plans, not of patriotic men but of partisans bent upon perpetuating
</p>
<p>Southern predominance in the upper house of Congress ; in the pro-
</p>
<p>gress of the struggle we witness the humiliation of a National Exe-
</p>
<p>cutive and the triumph, for a season, of violence and bad faith; in
</p>
<p>its close we behold the futile efforts of Southern factionists in Congress
</p>
<p>to override their own asseverated principles of the rights of settlers in a
</p>
<p>Territory to form their own institutions. In the failure to make Kansas
</p>
<p>a Slave State the veil was flung aside. Southern arrogance became
</p>
<p>Southern treason. The struggle in Kansas was the culminating point
</p>
<p>in the Congressional history of slavery : it initiated the conflict between
</p>
<p>the two principles of freedom and servitude which deluged the laud in

<p>ward those against wliom he conspired and who succeeded in hanging
</p>
<p>him, that it is scarcely possible to do both parties justice. We have
</p>
<p>endeavored to present the subject in its true light  confining our record
</p>
<p>to those authenticated facts and incidents from which a correct judgment
</p>
<p>is to be formed.
</p>
<p>In the Appendix will be found documents quite important to the
</p>
<p>student who would sift to the bottom each case presented.
</p>
<p>That this volume is free from errors of fact or mistakes of judgment
</p>
<p>is not to be assumed. What works on American history can claim such
</p>
<p>positive qualities ? What has been my aim is to present such a record
</p>
<p>as will bear the closest scrutiny, and to lay before the intelligent reader
</p>
<p>facts upon which he may form his own conclusions, and sustain or re-
</p>
<p>pudiate the opinions expressed by the author. No historian can hope
</p>
<p>successfully to suppress testimony, nor to pervert its interpretation ;
</p>
<p>and he who writes for the present or for the future must be studious for
</p>
<p>the truth if he would retain the respect of friends and command the at-
</p>
<p>tention of foes. O. J. V.

<p>HISTORY OF AMERICAN CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>PKELIMIIsTARY CHAPTER.
</p>
<p>In the production of this work, as stated in tlie preface, we
</p>
<p>have considered only those conspiracies, rebelHons, &c., which
</p>
<p>were more than local in their effects. Under this head we
</p>
<p>might, perhaps, have classed the several early Indian conspira-
</p>
<p>cies of Opechancanough, in Virginia, (1622,) King Phillip, in
</p>
<p>New England, (1675,) and of the Tuscaroras, in the Carolinas,
</p>
<p>(1712,) but deemed the story of Pontiac's greater combination
</p>
<p>of savage tribes against the whites sufficient to illustrate that
</p>
<p>feature of our history.
</p>
<p>Of local uprisings we have omitted to write of Clayborne's
</p>
<p>Maryland insurrection, 174516 ; of Nathaniel Bacon's seizure
</p>
<p>of the Government of Virginia (1676) ; of Jacob Leisler's usur-
</p>
<p>pation and reign in New York (1689-91); of the revolution
</p>
<p>against the old proprietory in the Carolinas (1719). Though
</p>
<p>events of interest these belong purely to colonial history. So,
</p>
<p>also, the war of the New Hampshire Grants (1774-75), in which
</p>
<p>Ethan Allen figured conspicuously; the boundary troubles
</p>
<p>bet ween 'Pennsylvania and Maryland, which resulted in the
</p>
<p>location of Mason and Dixon's line (1760-61) ; the " Old Court"
</p>
<p>and "New Court" emeutein Kentucky (1824-25); the "Tole-
</p>
<p>do War" between Ohio and Michigan (1835)  all, are very in-
</p>
<p>teresting episodes in the developement of States, but possess
</p>
<p>no National interest.
</p>
<p>Of Slave insurrections we have considered but those of
</p>
<p>Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner  these being the only con-
</p>
<p>spiracies among the helots of the South of which sufficient data

<p>uprisings is not denied ; but, the alarm felt by citizens, courts
</p>
<p>and press of the South has induced a studied secrecy. It was
</p>
<p>policy to suppress comment, which could have resulted only in
</p>
<p>convincing the slaves of their power to produce terror. Some
</p>
<p>evidence is in existence regarding Gabriel's insurrection in
</p>
<p>Virginia during the year 1800. But, the data is meagre and
</p>
<p>indefinite. "For the past week," said a letter writer from
</p>
<p>Southeastern Virginia, "we have been under momentary ex-
</p>
<p>pectation of an uprising among the negroes, who have assem-
</p>
<p>bled to the number of nine hundred or a thousand and threat-
</p>
<p>ened to massacre all the whites. They are armed with desperate
</p>
<p>weapons and secrete themselves in the woods. God only knows
</p>
<p>our fate. We have strong guards every night under arms,"
</p>
<p>This was the first general alarm sounded. Virginia, at that
</p>
<p>time, had in her bosom a powerful body of real anti-slavery
</p>
<p>men, among whom must be named Jefferson, whose " Xotes
</p>
<p>on Virginia" was then having a wide circulation, as also had
</p>
<p>Judge Tucker's " Proposal for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery
</p>
<p>in Virginia." There was, then^ a gradual drifting of the State
</p>
<p>toward a free constitution ; but, even that slight agitation of
</p>
<p>the question was the very incentive needed to inspire the slave
</p>
<p>with ideas and hopes of freedom.
</p>
<p>The insurrection above referred to was thoroughly organized
</p>
<p>and ready for explosion when discovered. Its first work was
</p>
<p>the capture of Eichmond. September 1st was the " day of de-
</p>
<p>liverance" chosen. The arrangements were for the blacks,
</p>
<p>under the general leadership of Gabriel, (a slave of Thomas
</p>
<p>Prosser, residing near Eichmond,) to gather by night, to the
</p>
<p>number of eleven hundred, at a brook six miles from the capi-
</p>
<p>tal. Then, having perfected their detail of disposition, the
</p>
<p>march upon Eichmond was to be made by right and left wing
</p>
<p>and centre. The first division was to seize the penetentiary,
</p>
<p>at that time containing several thousand stand of arms;

</p>
<p>the second division was to capture the powder house. Then,
</p>
<p>united, the right and left were to press on to the Capitol build-
</p>
<p>ing, and to retain it as their strong hold and central rallying
</p>
<p>pomt Meanwhile the centre column, having all the arms first

<p>PKRELIMINARY CHAPTER. 27
</p>
<p>provided by the blacks, was to enter the city and commence
</p>
<p>the work of slaughter. Not a white, save the French inhabit-
</p>
<p>ants, was to be spared^all were to be massacred, young and
</p>
<p>old, male and female. The French were to have been saved 
</p>
<p>it was then assumed by the anti-Jacobins or anti- Jeffersonians
</p>
<p> because they were known to the negroes as friends of free-
</p>
<p>dom and equality ; but, it is not certain that the slaves had so
</p>
<p>clear a conception of the French revolution and the French
</p>
<p>party in America. All things at first conspired to render the
</p>
<p>plot a success : Eichmond was not even in a good defensive
</p>
<p>position ; it was easy of sjezjire. Nothing, it would appear,
</p>
<p>stood between the negroes and a realization of their horrid
</p>
<p>dream but secresy. That was not wanting until the last hour,
</p>
<p>when the plot was divulged in full by two slaves, and active
</p>
<p>steps were taken to ferret out its leaders. The alarm which
</p>
<p>succeeded was painful in the extreme. Much of the State soon
</p>
<p>was under arms. Governor James Monroe, "impressed with
</p>
<p>the magnitude of the danger, appointed three aides-de-camp."
</p>
<p>Patrols were established in the towns; on plantations strict
</p>
<p>surveillance of negro quarters was practiced. Arrests, brief
</p>
<p>hearings and executions quickly followed  from five to fifteen
</p>
<p>slaves being hung at a time. Gabriel eluded arrest for a while.
</p>
<p>Three hundred dollars were offered for his apprehension. He
</p>
<p>was captured at length in Norfolk  having lain secreted in a
</p>
<p>schooner's hold for eleven days  and was hung October 7tL
</p>
<p>Gabriel was a resolute fellow, young but sagacious, and won
</p>
<p>admiration even from his foes, because of his firm bearing.
</p>
<p>He resisted all efforts of the Governor and the authorities to
</p>
<p>discover the extent of the plot, its originators, and those impli-
</p>
<p>cated. Certain it is that the slaves as far east as Norfolk, fully
</p>
<p>understood the programme. The negroes in all the south-
</p>
<p>eastern counties, it is supposed, were ready to rise  so well de-
</p>
<p>vised and extensive were the arrangements. Only a portion
</p>
<p>of those suspected were arraigned. Said a cotemporary jour-

<p>nalist : " The trials of the negroes concerned in the late insur-
</p>
<p>rection are suspended until the opinion of the Legislature can
</p>
<p>be had on the subject This measure is said to be owing to
</p>
<p>the immense numbers who are interested in the plot, whose

</p>
<p>death, should they all be found guilty and executed, will near-
</p>
<p>ly produce the annihilation of the blacks in this part of the
</p>
<p>country."
</p>
<p>Gabriel's scheme quickly assumed a political aspect by the
</p>
<p>excessive partisanship of Democrats and Federalists. The lat-
</p>
<p>ter charged that the negroes, from hearing the former continu-
</p>
<p>ally ranting about "equahty," "fraternity" and "human rights,''
</p>
<p>learned their first lessons in revolution and only proposed to
</p>
<p>enforce French revolutionary ideas. This was a severe but
</p>
<p>plausible application of the teachings of Democratic and Jaco-
</p>
<p>binical societies ; still, it was unjust to assume that even the
</p>
<p>French partisans were in any degree responsible for that upris-
</p>
<p>ing. Its secret lay in the eternal injustice of the institution of
</p>
<p>slavery ; and Gabriel, like Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey,
</p>
<p>but embodied the love of liberty which slumbers in every hu-
</p>
<p>man breast. Human nature is rarely so abased as not to love
</p>
<p>liberty. To attain it, he who is not willing to sacrifice life it-
</p>
<p>self is not worthy of the boon. It is the folly of wisdom which
</p>
<p>will not be wise that imputes a slave uprising to " bad teach-
</p>
<p>ings," to "incendiary pamphlets," &c. So long as there is a
</p>
<p>slave there will be rebellion, let the institution be ever so hu-
</p>
<p>manely ordered. But, brutally ordered as it has been, in the
</p>
<p>Southern States of the American Union, the wonder is that in-
</p>
<p>surrections have not been more frequent and bloody.
</p>
<p>The session of the Legislature which followed discussed the
</p>
<p>matter of the insurrection with closed doors. Nor, were the
</p>
<p>proceedings afterwards disclosed except in detached paragraphs,
</p>
<p>which it took thirty years to bring into consistency. From
</p>
<p>these we learn that steps were proposed for colonizing the blacks,
</p>
<p>thus reducing their numbers and opening a way for the eman-
</p>
<p>cipation and exportation of those deemed to be dangerous.
</p>
<p>Said John Eandolph, in one of his impressive harangues, in
</p>
<p>Congress: "the night bell is never heard to toll in the city of
</p>
<p>Eichmond but the anxious mother presses her infant more

</p>
<p>closely to her bosom." No doubt the people themselves were
</p>
<p>solicitous to banish from their midst such an element of terror.
</p>
<p>The Governor, by order and advice of the House of Delegates,
</p>
<p>entered into a secret correspondence with the President of the
</p>
<p>PRELIMINARY CHAPTER. 29
</p>
<p>United States upon the subject of securing a grant of land from
</p>
<p>the public domain upon which to colonize such negroes as
</p>
<p>gave trouble. Nothing came of this, at that time, though the
</p>
<p>matter still was agitated by the Virginians ; and, finally, on
</p>
<p>January 22d, 1805, the following resolution passed the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature in secret session :
</p>
<p>" Resolved  That the Senators of this State in the Congress of the
</p>
<p>United States be instructed, and the Representatives be requested to
</p>
<p>use their best efforts for obtaining from the General Government a com-
</p>
<p>petent portion of territory in the State of Louisiana, to be ajjpropriated
</p>
<p>to the residence of such people of color as have been or shall be eman-
</p>
<p>cipated, or hereafter may become dangerous to the public safety,"
</p>
<p>It is somewhat remarkable that all this should have remain-
</p>
<p>ed a profound secret even to the great mass of Virginians. It
</p>
<p>was both a confession of the weakness and of the wrong of
</p>
<p>slavery, coming from those most guilty; inspired by their
</p>
<p>fears, they desired to secure their own safety by thrusting upon
</p>
<p>the General Government the care of such blacks as should be
</p>
<p>given their liberty.
</p>
<p>But, it was a secret movement out of which sprang nothing
</p>
<p>in results ; and the resolution above quoted was not exhumed
</p>
<p>until 1816, when the matter was revived in the Virginia Legis-
</p>
<p>lature, and the resolution reaffirmed in substance. To assist
</p>
<p>this emancipation scheme the American Colonization Society
</p>
<p>was formed, under the Presidency of Henry Clay. Out of that
</p>
<p>movement, also, sprang nothing. The main reason why these
</p>
<p>several efforts were barren of good fruits was the constant ap-
</p>
<p>preciation in value of negro " stock." As Virginia lands grew
</p>
<p>less productive, and the " first families" found their old baro-
</p>
<p>nial splendors circumscribed by limited incomes, breeding
</p>
<p>slaves for market gradually assumed the condition of a busi-
</p>
<p>ness, and, by the time the Colonization Society was ready to
</p>
<p>relieve the State of its superabundant negroes, that superabun-
</p>
<p>dance was disposed of " to go South," at prices making slave

</p>
<p>breeding very profitable. Hence, the end was accomplished
</p>
<p>of ridding the State of its most dangerous blacks, while, at the
</p>
<p>same time, their sale compensated for the constantly depreci-
</p>
<p>ating resources of the soil. According to the Richmond Inqui-
</p>
<p>rer, the annual income of Virginia from the sale of negroes was
</p>
<p>30 PRELIMINARY CHAPTER.
</p>
<p>equal to four millions of dollars. That j ournal very pertinen ily
</p>
<p>asked (when indicating the interest whicli Virginia had in the
</p>
<p>South, and to assist in deciding her course during the winter
</p>
<p>of 1860-61) what commerce of the North could compensate for
</p>
<p>the loss of that trade ?
</p>
<p>The Black Hawk (1881-32) war was, in no sense, a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy. It originated in a purely local difficulty, and, though it
</p>
<p>required considerable exercise of military force, it was little
</p>
<p>else than a whiskey outbreak. Our Government having ob-
</p>
<p>tained by treaty with Keokuk, chief of the Sac and Fox In-
</p>
<p>dians, title to their lands on the east side of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>river, opened it to settlers. Black Hawk, with a body of fol-
</p>
<p>lowers never exceeding six hundred  composed of the worst
</p>
<p>class of savages from several surrounding tribes  resolved not
</p>
<p>to leave Illinois territory, and kept his promise for over a year ;
</p>
<p>but, at length, was thoroughly subdued and banished to the
</p>
<p>West.
</p>
<p>The terrible riot in Philadelphia (1844) might, perhaps just-
</p>
<p>ly, have claimed a chapter in this volume ; but, to have given
</p>
<p>it place would have been a precedent for recording the story
</p>
<p>of the outbreaks in Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Boston, &c. The
</p>
<p>Philadelphia tragedy wets one of the most distressing and furi-
</p>
<p>ous storms of passion which ever disgraced this cou.ntry's an-
</p>
<p>nals  in some respects worse than the celebrated "draft" riots
</p>
<p>in New York city (1863). It sprung from the enmity of
</p>
<p>classes, nd the animosity engendered by attempted political
</p>
<p>and social proscription. For several years prior to 1844 the
</p>
<p>foreign population of several of the Free States had become
</p>
<p>so powerful as to elect to office men of their kind. This as-
</p>
<p>cendancy a large class of American-born citizens proposed to
</p>
<p>counteract, by the formation of a political party whose cardinal
</p>
<p>principle should be the exclusion of foreigners from office and
</p>
<p>the restriction of the elective franchise to those born in the"
</p>
<p>country, or who had resided here for a term of twenty-one

<p>years. This party originated in Philadelphia, and there an-
</p>
<p>nounced its first public meeting. That meeting, held Monday
</p>
<p>afternoon, May 6th, 1844, was assaulted by the Irish, and a
</p>
<p>riot followed, in which one American was killed and eleven
</p>
<p>PEELIMINAKY CHAPTER. 31
</p>
<p>wounded. The excitement quickly intensified; soon Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia was lit up with incendiary fires. The reign of violence
</p>
<p>was supreme for two days, when, by a general arming of citizens
</p>
<p>and the introduction of the military, it was suppressed, A
</p>
<p>large number of buildings were burned or sacked, including
</p>
<p>several Eoman Catholic churches, a Roman Catholic female
</p>
<p>seminary, &c., &c. Nothing came of this terrible episode ex-
</p>
<p>cept an increase of party animosities, and of the feeling against
</p>
<p>the Irish population. Time, which soothes all distempers, drew
</p>
<p>a vail over the days of May ; but, it was years before those who
</p>
<p>had participated in the affair put aside their hates.
</p>
<p>Excitement which succeeded the Mexican War convulsed
</p>
<p>the entire country. It was the old conflict for slave or anti-
</p>
<p>slave supremacy. The war with Mexico was but a scheme for
</p>
<p>territorial aggrandisement. It resulted favorably, and the
</p>
<p>South bid fair to acquire permanent ascendancy through the
</p>
<p>Slave States to be formed of Texas, California and New Mexico.
</p>
<p>But, the North would not yield to a slave representation the
</p>
<p>vast domain acquired. During the years 1848-49-50 the
</p>
<p>country was deeply agitated. The struggle in the halls of Con-
</p>
<p>gress assumed a very angry front. Northern free soil mem-
</p>
<p>bers sought to carry the 36-80 line across the continent  to
</p>
<p>engraft the Wilmot proviso upon territorial organization by
</p>
<p>which slavery was to be denied any recognition in a territory.
</p>
<p>Utah and New Mexico were held at arm's length during this
</p>
<p>protracted struggle, and remained in a kind of independent
</p>
<p>yet chaotic state. California, however, filled by the avalanch
</p>
<p>of gold seekers and adventurers, at once had leaped into a Free
</p>
<p>State's estate, and came clamoring for admission. But, South-
</p>
<p>ern men resisted this turn of the tide, and refused to receive
</p>
<p>the new State with its free Constitution. The moment of peril
</p>
<p>had arrived. Section was arrayed against section, and neither
</p>
<p>would yield. It appeared as if the long predicted "final
</p>
<p>struggle" between slave and free ideas had come. At the mo-

<p>ment of angriest discussion, Henry Clay, " the gi'eat compro.
</p>
<p>miser," came forward with his plan of settlement (Jan. 29th,
</p>
<p>1850), providing that the people of the territories should de-
</p>
<p>termine their own wishes in regard to slavery ; stipulating for
</p>
<p>32 PRELIMINARY CHAPTER.
</p>
<p>the more efficient enforcement of tlie Fugitive Slave law ; de-
</p>
<p>fining the boundaries of Texas and New Mexico, and arrang-
</p>
<p>ing for the organization of new territories. This, like his pre-
</p>
<p>vious schemes of compromise, found men enough from both
</p>
<p>factions to carry it triumphantly through Congress. For a
</p>
<p>while the waters were stilled ; but, the hateful spirit of South-
</p>
<p>ern arrogance was bubbling beneath the surface, concocting its
</p>
<p>conspiracy to repeal the compromise of 1822. In 1854 the in-
</p>
<p>cendiary fires again were lit by the aggressors, when, suddenly,
</p>
<p>the country was convulsed as it never before had been. The
</p>
<p>movement assumed a social as well as political face, and there-
</p>
<p>fore was productive of most intense feeling. It proposed to
</p>
<p>make slavery national and freedom sectional  a proposition at
</p>
<p>which Northern men, without much distmction of party, re-
</p>
<p>volted. Only public distaste for slavery prevented the slave
</p>
<p>holder from " tarrying" with his slaves in Free States as long
</p>
<p>as he pleased  the Fugitive Slave law, under heavy penalties,
</p>
<p>making it the duty of every citizen to catch the slave should
</p>
<p>the poor wretch attempt to escape. But when, superadded to
</p>
<p>this deference to the " peculiar institution," came a demand to
</p>
<p>open all the vast region of the West to slave settlement, the
</p>
<p>prescription was too bitter for the lips of freemen. Yet, it
</p>
<p>was the effort of years to put away the unpalatable dose  so
</p>
<p>daring and persistent were the Conspirators against free insti-
</p>
<p>tutions. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Repub-
</p>
<p>lican party, which, in 1860, elevated its candidate to the
</p>
<p>Presidential chair. Foiled in their desperate devices to retain
</p>
<p>their seventy years' supremacy  their "equilibrium" the par-
</p>
<p>tisans of slavery professed to call it  the Secession Revolution
</p>
<p>was inaugurated, to found a confederation of States whose
</p>
<p>corner stone should be the recognition of grades in society

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>Of conspiracies plotted by the Indians for the extirpation
</p>
<p>of the whites, that conceived by Pontiac, chief of the Ottawas,
</p>
<p>holds a prominent place. This savage seemed formed by
</p>
<p>nature for his bloody mission. Powerfal in person, com-
</p>
<p>manding in presence, resolute to an extraordinary degree,
</p>
<p>possessed of a rare gift of eloquence, sagacious and subtle as
</p>
<p>a beast of prey, he rightfally claimed the office of chief over
</p>
<p>many tribes and became the minister of vengeance for his
</p>
<p>race.
</p>
<p>Pontiac first appears on the stage during the French aiid
</p>
<p>English war, in which he participated as the ally of the
</p>
<p>French. He was at the battle of the Heights of Abraham,
</p>
<p>though it does not appear that the English victors received
</p>
<p>as prisoners any Indians. But, to what extent he co-operated
</p>
<p>against the English, is not known. His sympathies all were
</p>
<p>with the French, whose policy toward the Indians almost
</p>
<p>uniformly had been one of fostering care and kindness.
</p>
<p>From them he had imbibed an implacable hatred of the
</p>
<p>Briton, which proved an inspiration of the conspiracy soon
</p>
<p>to see the light.
</p>
<p>Following the fall of Quebec (September, 1759) one after
</p>
<p>another of the French possessions passed under the English
</p>
<p>sway. The trading posts and forts  Presque Isle (now Erie,
</p>
<p>Pa.), Miama (on the Maumee), Detroit, Michilmacinac, Green
</p>
<p>Bay, &c.  were occupied during 1760 by British troops.
</p>
<p>English traders, EngUsh laws, English insolence and Enghsh
</p>
<p>dishonesty quickly succeeded, to add fuel to the fires slum-
</p>

</p>
<p>34 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>Major Eogers was dispatcTied in September, 1760, from
</p>
<p>Montreal, by Sir Jeffrey Amherst, to Detroit and Michilmac-
</p>
<p>inac with two hundred men, who were to receive the capitu-
</p>
<p>lation of those posts and were to garrison the forts. Proceed-
</p>
<p>ing in row boats up Lake Erie he reached the mouth of
</p>
<p>Cuyahoga Eiver, in Ohio, November 7th, where the Major de-
</p>
<p>termined to encamp for a few days to rest his wearied men.
</p>
<p>He had scarcely lit his camp fires ere a troop of Indians ap-
</p>
<p>peared, proclaiming themselves the messengers of Pontiac,
</p>
<p>and, in his name, ordering the English to proceed no farther.
</p>
<p>Eogers demanded an interview with the chief, who soon ap-
</p>
<p>peared, accompanied by an imposing retinue of warriors. It
</p>
<p>was here that the great conspirator first came forward into
</p>
<p>the full light of history. From Eogers' minute account of
</p>
<p>the interview, we have a clear concej)tion of the Indian Attila.
</p>
<p>He approached with a haughty stride, gorgeously attired in
</p>
<p>hij5 savage cOstume, demanding at once, in an imj)erious tone,
</p>
<p>to know by what authority the British ofiicer presumed to
</p>
<p>enter the Indian country without permission or treaty. Eog-
</p>
<p>er.i was not a man without nerve. He stood as unabashed
</p>
<p>b(ifore that son of the forest as he would have done before a
</p>
<p>great oak, surging and roaring in the wind. To the barbari-
</p>
<p>an's demand Eogers answered that, the French having been
</p>
<p>Cd-nquered, he was commissioned to take possession of the
</p>
<p>upper forts  that his errand was one of peace, and his tarry
</p>
<p>at that point was for a brief season of rest. The chief answer-
</p>
<p>ed : "I stand in your path until to-morrow morning," and
</p>
<p>then departed. A deputation of warriors soon returned to
</p>
<p>offer the whites provisions, which were accepted and paid
</p>
<p>for. On the succeeding day a long conference was held, in
</p>

<p>first destination, to receive tlie capitulation of the French
</p>
<p>garrison, November 29th, 1760. The Wyandots and Potta-
</p>
<p>"watomies, encamped below Detroit, on either side of the river,
</p>
<p>witnessed the change of masters in silence, and seemingly
</p>
<p>acquiesced in the transfer without anger ; but they, like Pon-
</p>
<p>tiac's own immediate people  the Otto was and Ojibwas 
</p>
<p>preferred to await the issue of events. Had the English then
</p>
<p>been wise enough to have scanned the future, and just enough
</p>
<p>to have inaugurated a conciliatory, fatherly pohcy in dealing
</p>
<p>with the Indians, much if not all the human suffering and
</p>
<p>sacrifice which followed might have been averted. But then,
</p>
<p>as since. Great Britain acted less from the dictates of a broad
</p>
<p>humanity than from the impulse of commercial gairu * In
</p>
<p>fixing the degree of responsibility for what followed we should,
</p>
<p>in order to be just, weigh well the causes which impelled the
</p>
<p>savages to the war path. If Great Britain could have ap-
</p>
<p>peased those tigers of the American forests, panting for blood, she
</p>
<p>should have done it ; that she not only offered no conciliation
</p>
<p>but scorned and maltreated the untamed creatures, is to make
</p>
<p>her at least partially accountable for the conspiracy and its
</p>
<p>sad results.
</p>
<p>The mutterings of the impending storm were heard early
</p>
<p>in the summer of 1761, when Captain Campbell, command-
</p>
<p>ing at Detroit, was fully informed of a conspu'acy among
</p>
<p>the tribes along the lakes and in the Ohio valley to rise sim-
</p>
<p>ultaneously against all the forts, to massacre the garrisons,
</p>
<p>and then to combine and fall upon all settlements advanced
</p>
<p>over the eastern ridge of the Alleghanies. Expresses were
</p>
<p>at once dispatched to all the points menaced. This betrayal
</p>
<p>of their plot sufficed to postpone the attack for that season.
</p>
<p>Sir Jeffrey Amherst commanded extreme caution to be used
</p>
<p>at all posts, while the Indians were treated with a severity
</p>
<p>and suspicion which only served to strengthen their bitter-
</p>
<p>ness of feeling toward their foe.

<p>36 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>. This postponement gave time for farther conferenc'-^
</p>
<p>among the tribes. Ambassadors from the Six Nations and
</p>
<p>Pontiac pierced to the Far West and to the South, everywhere
</p>
<p>receiving assurances of aid in any attempt to expel the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish. Pontiac himself, it is probable, visited the tribes con-
</p>
<p>gregated in what are now the States of Illinois, Indiana,
</p>
<p>Ohio and Michigan, for the combination of those nations be
</p>
<p>came complete during 1762, and the great leader's authority
</p>
<p>was quite generally acknowledged by them.
</p>
<p>These proceedings were kept profoundly secret. Those (mai
</p>
<p>ducting the plot dissimulated well. Crowds of men, women
</p>
<p>and children beset the forts and trading posts, eager for gun-
</p>
<p>powder, traffic and liquor ; but, even in their drunken bouts,
</p>
<p>nothing escaped their lips to betray their murderoiLS designs,
</p>
<p>A friendly savage would, at times, whisper a word of warning
</p>
<p>to some white who had won his confidence, and enough trans-
</p>
<p>pired to keep the English officers on their guard. The com-
</p>
<p>mandant at Fort Miami, on the Maumee river, was thus warn-
</p>
<p>ed early in the year 1763. Messengers from the East had ar-
</p>
<p>rived in his neighborhood to inform the tribes of the hour of
</p>
<p>uprising, and the Miamis had consented to murder the garri-
</p>
<p>son. The brave commander called the chiefs together, in-
</p>
<p>formed them of their bloody plot, and, by threats of dreadful
</p>
<p>retaliation, won from them a confession of its truth. This
</p>
<p>news was dispatched at once to Detroit, where Major Gladwyn
</p>
<p>held the chief command ; but, the Major was so lulled into
</p>
<p>security by the apparently friendly nature of the Wyandots,
</p>
<p>Pottawatomies and Ottawas surrounding his post, that he dis-
</p>
<p>credited the report of a general uprising. He was only too
</p>
<p>Boon made aware of his almost criminal disbelief.
</p>
<p>The treaty between England and France was not signed
</p>
<p>Tintil February 10th, 1763, while dispatches announcing its
</p>
<p>terms did not reach the Northern frontiers until the May fol-
</p>

<p>dians, goading them on to the attack, and promising assistance
</p>
<p>in case of need. The savages were given to understand that
</p>
<p>King Louis favored their designs, and that assurance inspired

<p>Pontiac and his coadjutors. By the terms of the treaty France
</p>
<p>relinquished all claims to her North American possessions east
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio. This forever extin-
</p>
<p>guished any hope of French co-operation with the Indians, but
</p>
<p>its promulgation came too late  the dog feast and the war
</p>
<p>dance had been celebrated in an hundred villages, the war
</p>
<p>wampum had conveyed its final messages, and the Western
</p>
<p>woods swarmed with " braves" on the war path.
</p>
<p>Three tribes gathered, during April, 1763, at their camping
</p>
<p>grounds on the little river Encores, which flows into the De-
</p>
<p>troit river from the west, opposite the head of Fighting Island.
</p>
<p>Wj^andots, Pottawatomies and Ottawas were there, evidently
</p>
<p>en route from their winter hunt to reoccupy their old villages
</p>
<p>around and above Detroit. But, it was more than a chance
</p>
<p>gathering  it was a council convened for the decision of the
</p>
<p>great question of the combined attack upon every English
</p>
<p>post in the West. This council was held April 27th. It was
</p>
<p>attended by delegations of the tribes named, as also by Ojib-
</p>
<p>was, Miamis, Chippewas, Hurons and several Canadians. Pon-
</p>
<p>tiac was the ruling spirit. He was the conceded superior of
</p>
<p>all present ; the chiefs of all the tribes represented were pre-
</p>
<p>pared to accept him as their oracle.^
</p>
<p>The council fire being lit, and the warriors seated around it
</p>
<p>in circling rows, the pipe passed from mouth to mouth until
</p>
<p>all had smoked. This ceremony over Pontiac entered the
</p>
<p>charmed circle to divulge his secrets and expound his views.
</p>
<p>His speech is represented to have been very violent against
</p>
<p>the English, whom he characterised as robbers, tyrants and
</p>
<p>settled foes to the Indian race. Their rapacity was that of the
</p>
<p>wolf, their mercy that of grizzly bears, their truth that of the
</p>
<p>fox. They treated the warriors like dogs, the women like
</p>
<p>slaves, the children like wild animals. The land given to the
</p>
<p>Indian they conceived to be theirs ; thus the aborigines were
</p>
<p>to be banished, their hunting grounds appropriated, their

<p>88 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>sources of supplies all cut off and starvation was to do for the
</p>
<p>tribes what the deadly rifle and " fire water" left undone.
</p>
<p>This strain touched the wildest chord in the savage breast
</p>
<p>The great assembly, stoic in its apparent apathy, broke out into
</p>
<p>gi'unts and muttered vows of vengeance as the great warrior
</p>
<p>progressed in his word-painting of wrongs heaped upon the
</p>
<p>suifering race. That it was a master-piece of forest eloquence
</p>
<p>tradition tells us. Long after the orator had passed away,
</p>
<p>tribes to the far West preserved the memory of that wonderful
</p>
<p>harangue.
</p>
<p>But, this story of English rapacity and cruelty was only the
</p>
<p>peroration of the address. Having wrought upon the hearts
</p>
<p>of his fierce assembly until each seemed a cone of fire burning
</p>
<p>on the altar of vengeance, the wily chief informed his listeners
</p>
<p>of the French readiness to co-operate with the Indians for the
</p>
<p>expulsion of the intruders and robbers. A great belt of wam-
</p>
<p>pum was exhibited as coming to Pontiac from King Louis of
</p>
<p>France, in token of his mighty sympathy. The orator then
</p>
<p>represented that, even then, " big canoes" were on their way
</p>
<p>over the great waters to strike one more blow for the extirpa-
</p>
<p>tion of the hated foe. Would the race of red men sit silently
</p>
<p>by their fires and see the French struggle alone ? The spirits
</p>
<p>of their dead called them to the war path  their wrongs
</p>
<p>would be their food, their vengeance would be their strength.
</p>
<p>Then, to confirm the impression of his stormy eloquence,
</p>
<p>and to leave on the mind of each hearer such an apprehension
</p>
<p>of the whole subject as would never fail to arouse the savage
</p>
<p>instinct for blood, the chief told this remarkable tale;^
</p>
<p>" A Delaware Indian conceived an eager desire to learn wisdom from
</p>
<p> Parkman repeats this from the Pontiac Ms. How authentic that may be is
</p>
<p>only to be determined by its intrinsic evidence. Of the tale, Parkman observes :
</p>
<p>" Its precise origin is not easy to determine. It is possible that the Delaware
</p>
<p>prophet mentioned in a former chapter, may have had some part in it ; or it might
</p>
<p>have been the offspring of Pontiac's heated imagination during his period of fasting

</p>
<p>and dreaming. That he deliberately invented it for the sake of the effect it would
</p>
<p>produce, is the least probable conclusion of all." If the legend were divested off
</p>
<p>the rhetoric and polish given it by the scribe who wrote it out from the meagre
</p>
<p>notes of the Pontiac Ms., it would be more apparently Indian, and therefore more
</p>
<p>likely Pontiac's own invention for the sake of efifect. It was, we conceive, foi

</p>
<p>the Master of Life : but, being ignorant where to find him, he had r&.
</p>
<p>course to fasting, dreaming and magical incantations. By these means
</p>
<p>it was revealed to him, that, by moving forward in a straight, undevi-
</p>
<p>ating course, he would reach the abode of the Great Spirit. He told
</p>
<p>his purpose to no one, and having provided the equipments of a hunter
</p>
<p> gun, powder-horn, ammunition and a kettle for preparing his food 
</p>
<p>he set forth on his errand. For some days he journeyed on in high hope
</p>
<p>and confidence. On the evening of the eighth day he stopped by the
</p>
<p>side of a brook at the edge of a small prairie, where he began to make
</p>
<p>ready his evening meal, when, looking up, he saw three large openings
</p>
<p>in the woods on the opposite side of the meadow, and three well-beaten
</p>
<p>paths which entered them. He was much surprised ; but his wonder
</p>
<p>increased when, after it had grown dark, the three paths were more
</p>
<p>clearly visible than ever. Remembering the important object of his
</p>
<p>visit, he could neither sleep nor rest ; and, leaving his fire, he crossed
</p>
<p>the meadow, and entered the largest of the three ojjenings. He had
</p>
<p>advanced but a short distance into the forest, when a bright flame
</p>
<p>sprung out of the ground before him, and arrested his steps. In great
</p>
<p>amazement, he turned back, and entered the second path, where the
</p>
<p>same wonderful phenomenon again encountered him ; and now, in ter-
</p>
<p>ror and bewilderment, yet still resolved to persevere, he j)ursued the
</p>
<p>last of the three j^aths. On this he journeyed a whole day without in-
</p>
<p>terruption, when, at length, emerging from the forest, he saw before him
</p>
<p>a vast mountain of dazzling whiteness. So precipitous was the ascent
</p>
<p>that the Indian thought it hoj^eless to go further, and looked around
</p>
<p>him in desjiair : at that moment, he saw, seated at some distance above,
</p>
<p>the figure of a beautiful woman arrayed in white, who arose as he look-
</p>
<p>ed upon her, and thus accosted him : ' How can you hope, encumbered
</p>
<p>as you are, to succeed in your design ? Go down to the foot of the
</p>
<p>mountain, throw away your gun, your ammunition, your provisions and
</p>
<p>your clothing ; wash yourself in the stream which flows there, and you
</p>
<p>will then be prepared to stand before the Master of Life.' The Indian
</p>
<p>obeyed, and again began to ascend among the rocks, while the woman,
</p>
<p>seeing him still discouraged, laughed at his faintness of heart, and told

<p>him that if he wished for success, he must climb by the aid of one fooi
</p>
<p>and one hand only. After great toil and suffering, he at length found
</p>
<p>himself at the summit. The woman had disappeared, and he was left
</p>
<p>alone. A rich and beautiful plain lay Ijefore him, and at a little dis-
</p>
<p>tance, he saw three great villages, far superior to the squalid dwellings
</p>
<p>of the Delawares. As he approached the largest, and stood hesitating
</p>
<p>whether he should enter, a man gorgeously attired stejjped forth, and
</p>
<p>taking him by the hand, welcomed him to the celestial abode. He then
</p>
<p>conducted him into the presence of the Great Spirit, where the Indian
</p>
<p>40 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>stood confounded at the unspeakable splendor wbicli surrounded him.
</p>
<p>The Great Spirit bade him be seated, and thus addressed him :
</p>
<p>"  I am the Maker of heaven and earth, the trees, lakes, rivers and all
</p>
<p>thmgs else ; I am the maker of mankind ; and because I love you, you
</p>
<p>must do my will. The land on which you lived was made for you, and
</p>
<p>not for others. Why do you suffer the white men to dwell among you ?
</p>
<p>My children, you have forgotten the customs and traditions of your
</p>
<p>forefathers. Why do you not clothe yourselves in skins, as they did, and
</p>
<p>use the bows and arrows, and the stone-pointed lances, which they
</p>
<p>used ? You have bought guns, knives, kettles and blankets from the
</p>
<p>white men, until you can no longer do without them ; and what is
</p>
<p>worse, you have drunk the poison tire-water, which turns you into fools.
</p>
<p>Fling all these things away ; live as your wise forefathers lived before
</p>
<p>you. And as for these English  these dogs dressed in red, who have
</p>
<p>come to rob you of your hunting grounds, and drive away the game 
</p>
<p>you must lift the hatchet against them. Wipe them from the face of
</p>
<p>the earth, and then you will win my favor back again, and once more
</p>
<p>be prosperous and happy. The children of your great father, the King
</p>
<p>of France, are not like the English. Never forget that they are your
</p>
<p>brethren. They are very dear to me, for they love the red men, and
</p>
<p>understand the true mode of worshii^ing me.'
</p>
<p>" The Great Spirit next instructed his hearer in various precepts of
</p>
<p>morality and religion, such as the prohibition to marry more than one
</p>
<p>wite, and a warning against the practice of magic, which is worshiping
</p>
<p>the devil. A prayer, embodying the substance of all that he had heard,
</p>
<p>was then presented to the Delaware. It was cut in hieroglyphics upon
</p>
<p>a M'ooden stick, after the custom of his people, and he was directed to
</p>
<p>Bend copies of it to all the Indian villages.
</p>
<p>" The adventurer now departed, and returning to the earth, reported
</p>
<p>all the wonders he had seen in the celestial regions."
</p>
<p>This relation is represented by those present to have cre-
</p>
<p>ated a profound impression. It struck at civilization by
</p>
<p>encouraging the savages to continue in barbarism  an idea
</p>
<p>not at all displeasing to them ; while it fostered their hopes

</p>
<p>No record is preserved of other doings of the council, fur-
</p>
<p>ther than that the plan was adopted by which to effect the
</p>
<p>design of murdering the garrison and people of Detroit the
</p>
<p>French only to be spared. The plan was for Pontiac, with a
</p>
<p>body of his best braves, to obtain admittance within the pali-
</p>
<p>sade under pretense of performing the calumet dance for the
</p>
<p>THE CALUMET DANCE.

</p>
<p>edifioation of tlie garrison and Englisli commander, Major
</p>
<p>Gladwjm, whom they would honor, after their long absence
</p>
<p>during the winter. This was a preliminary for obtaining in-
</p>
<p>formation regarding the fortification and garrison.
</p>
<p>The council broke up at dusk. During the night the entire
</p>
<p>multitude of men, women and children struck their tents and
</p>
<p>disappeared, passing up the river to their old encampments
</p>
<p>near Detroit ; and when morning came it was to find the red
</p>
<p>skin host suddenly installed in their lodges within sight of the
</p>
<p>fort. Their coming and going always were so mysteriously
</p>
<p>conducted that their reappearance at that time attracted no at-
</p>
<p>tention.
</p>
<p>According to announcement Pon-
</p>
<p>tiac, with forty of his warriors, ap-
</p>
<p>peared on the 1st day of May (1763)
</p>
<p>at the gates of the palisades, asking
</p>
<p>admittance in order to perform their
</p>
<p>dance of peace before the command-
</p>
<p>ant and his men. The request was
</p>
<p>not granted without some hesitan-
</p>
<p>cy. Gladwyn, however, desiring to
</p>
<p>preserve the good will of the savages, finally consented to
</p>
<p>their appearance, when the savages, decked and plumed
</p>
<p>in their gayest apparel, entered, in single file, Pontiac at
</p>
<p>their head. They at once proceeded to the house of Glad-
</p>
<p>wyn, before which the dance was duly given, with all its abo-
</p>
<p>riginal absurdity. All the Indians were not present, however,
</p>
<p>to assist in the ceremony. Ten of them dropped out of line,
</p>
<p>as they filed thi-ough the streets, and while the remaining

<p>thirty were engaged in the dance, the spies were at work with
</p>
<p>their eyes, penetrating to all accessible corners of the fortifica-
</p>
<p>tion, noting every thing regarding the strength and efficiency
</p>
<p>of the garrison. When they returned to the band the dance
</p>
<p>was discontinued and at once the entire forty filed out of the
</p>
<p>gates again. No suspicion had been excited. Gladwyn evi-
</p>
<p>dently regarded the visit as favorable to peace. The Indians
</p>
<p>found the garrison rather lax in discipline and comparatively
</p>
<p>weak in numbers. A surprise would accomplish all.
</p>
<p>Detroit at that time was simply a fortified post standing in
</p>
<p>the midst of a village said, by Eogers, to contain twenty five
</p>
<p>hundred inhabitants  an estimate which must have included
</p>
<p>all the garrison and regular inhabitants and the lodges of
</p>
<p>traders, half breeds, &c., beyond the fort, within which were
</p>
<p>gathered about one hundred small houses, barracks, a church
</p>
<p>and a council house. The fortification consisted of palisades,
</p>
<p>twenty -five feet in heigh th, planted in a gi-eat square, facing
</p>
<p>the river on the east, with bastions at each corner and block
</p>
<p>houses over the gateways. All were of wood, and not of a
</p>
<p>character designed to resist any formidable assault. The gar-
</p>
<p>rison consisted of but one hundred and twenty regulars and
</p>
<p>rangers, with about two score of traders and followers whose
</p>
<p>devotion was as little to be trusted as that of the Indian.
</p>
<p>Against this post and its feeble garrison the conspirator was to
</p>
<p>fling all the sti'ength of his braves drawn from four tribes.'
</p>
<p>The location of the several tribes around the post is indicat-
</p>
<p>ed in the map. Pontiac, as Chief of the Ottawas, dwelt with
</p>
<p>them, though it is stated his own wigwam was on the Isle au
</p>
<p>Cochon, lying in the Detroit river near Lake St. Clair. The
</p>
<p>near contiguity of the tribes rendered frequent intercourse
</p>
<p>easy. After the visit to the fort, already referred to, a second
</p>
<p>general council was ordered by Pontiac. It convened in the
</p>
<p>Pottawatamie village May 3d, and was attended by all the

<p>ings of the Indians, and that numbers of them openly co-operated with Pontiac,
</p>
<p>supplying him with arms, ammunition, food, &c., during the siege. So many of
</p>
<p>them, indeed, were compromised by the afifair that Detroit village contained but
</p>
<p>five hundred and seventy-two inhabitants at the census of 1768  five years aftei
</p>

<p>THE PLOT UNFOLDED. 43
</p>
<p>principal men of tlie three tribes, as well as by a number of
</p>
<p>delegates from other tribes, whose agents and runners were
</p>
<p>with Pontiac to receive his orders and to act in concert in the
</p>
<p>general warfare to be waged. Great circumspection was used,
</p>
<p>if we may credit the generally received accounts, to render the
</p>
<p>proceedings secret. Sentinels were stationed around the great
</p>
<p>council house, and no woman, nor warrior not entitled to a
</p>
<p>seat by the council-fire, was permitted to come within hearing
</p>
<p>distance. How the Ojibwa girl, hereafter mentioned, came to
</p>
<p>learn the secret of the session, we are not informed.
</p>
<p>The gi'eat Chief unfolded his arrangements at length to the
</p>
<p>war chiefs before him. He addressed his fierce assembly in
</p>
<p>all the fervor of his burning passions  rekindling in their
</p>
<p>breasts the flame which feeds only on human blood. We can
</p>
<p>well imagine the picture presented : an hundred savages seat-
</p>
<p>ed on the ground of a chamber but dimly lit by the fire in its
</p>
<p>centre  Pontiac in their midst, his tenible passions all aroused,
</p>
<p>thundering his poisoned words in their ears  the tiger-like fe-
</p>
<p>rocity of his hearers gleaming from each face as if already their
</p>
<p>tomahawks were reeking with the crimson flood: such was
</p>
<p>the scene which the chroniclers have drawn for our contem-
</p>
<p>plation.
</p>
<p>The plan divulged by Pontiac for the accomplishment of his
</p>
<p>scheme of murder was to demand an audience with Gladwyn,
</p>
<p>under pretext of discussing matters of great moment ; sixty
</p>
<p>warriors were thus to gain admittance to his council house
</p>
<p>where all his ofiicers would be assembled ; each warrior was
</p>
<p>to be armed with knife, tomahawk and a rifle, whose barrel
</p>
<p>had been cut short so that all might be concealed beneath the
</p>
<p>blanket; outside were to be distributed as many carefully
</p>
<p>chosen braves as could well gain admittance within the gates,
</p>
<p>who, at the signal of a war shout from the council house, were
</p>
<p>to fall upon the garrison and English inhabitants, murdering
</p>
<p>men, women and children indiscriminately; the audience being

<p>granted, Pontiac was to address Gladwyn, holding forth a wam-
</p>
<p>pum belt  the signal for attack being the moment when the
</p>
<p>belt was reversed in his hand, when each wamor was to choose

<p>44 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>his victim and all whites present were to be butchered, at the
</p>
<p>same time giving the signal for their companions without.
</p>
<p>This hideous design would have worked perfectly, had not
</p>
<p>the secret been betrayed. The story runs that Gladwyn had
</p>
<p>for a mistress an Ojibway girl, who, when not with him, dwelt
</p>
<p>with the Pottawatamies, probably as the wife of one of the
</p>
<p>braves of that tribe. This woman became possessed of the se-
</p>
<p>cret ; and, as communication with the fort was unrestricted,
</p>
<p>she soon seized an opportunity to confer with Gladwyn. His-
</p>
<p>torians have turned this incident to account by weaving around
</p>
<p>it the story of love and love's devotion. One authority has it :
</p>
<p>" In the Pottawatamie village lived an Ojibwa girl who was the mis-
</p>
<p>tress of Major GladwjTi, and who loved him with the whole warmth of
</p>
<p>her generous soul. On the afternoon of the day, following the warning
</p>
<p>of M. Gouin, she came into the fort with a pair of elk-skin moccasins as
</p>
<p>a present to the commander. He noticed the saddened and pensive
</p>
<p>look she wore, but said nothing about it, and she withdrew. Still she
</p>
<p>lingered on the street, as if loth to depart until she had relieved her
</p>
<p>mind of some burden that was oppressing it. The sentinel, noticing
</p>
<p>her singular conduct, mentioned it to Gladwyn, who, recalling the girl,
</p>
<p>pressed her to reveal the cause of her trouble. She refused for a time
</p>
<p>to make any rejily ; but, after much urging and many promises not to
</p>
<p>betray her, she disclosed the whole murderous scheme. She said that
</p>
<p>on the morrow Pontiac, accompanied by sixty chiefs, would come to
</p>
<p>the fort. Each of these would have a short musket concealed under
</p>
<p>his blanket. Pontiac would make a si3eech as before mentioned, and
</p>
<p>at its close, oifer a peace-belt of wampum, holding it in a reversed po-
</p>
<p>sition. This would be the signal for the chiefs to shoot down the
</p>
<p>officers, and for the Indians upon the outside to commence their
</p>
<p>bloody work. The French were to be spared, but every Englishman
</p>
<p>was to be massacred."
</p>
<p>This coincides with Parkman's version, though it is discred-
</p>
<p>ited by the statements of the French Priests' diary upon which
</p>
<p>the "Pontiac Ms." is founded. That authority expressly avers

</p>
<p>that a man of the Ottawa tribe made the disclosure. The truth
</p>
<p>seems to us to be this : The wife of a trader, M. St Aubin,
</p>
<p>passed over to the Ottawa village on the afternoon of May 5th
</p>
<p>to find the Indians busily engaged in filing off their rifle bar-
</p>
<p>rels. This singular circumstance much excited her curiosity,
</p>
<p>and, from long association with the savages, she well knew
</p>
<p>it boded no good. Preserving a studied silence, as if she had
</p>
<p>gladwyn's suspicions aroused. 45
</p>
<p>not noticed the work, the woman returned to the village on
</p>
<p>the west side of the river, and at once reported the matter to
</p>
<p>M. Gouin, an old and influential trader. His suspicions were
</p>
<p>at once aroused. A dozen apparently trifling incidents were
</p>
<p>then recalled  all of which tended to confirm his alarm, and
</p>
<p>he hastened to the garrison to put it on guard against surprise.
</p>
<p>Gladwjn was, we are told, incredulous; the Indians were
</p>
<p>around the fort  men, women and children  daily, for gossip,
</p>
<p>barter and theft ; no sign had been given of a spirit of war ;
</p>
<p>hence he conceived an attack improbable.
</p>
<p>The circumstance, however, served to inspu-e him with mis-
</p>
<p>givings. The Ojibwa girl he probably questioned very close-
</p>
<p>ly, and doubtless obtained from her much to strengthen the
</p>
<p>impression made by M. Gouin's revelations. That she made
</p>
<p>some disclosures to him seems confirmed by the fact of Ponti-
</p>
<p>ac's having afterwards beaten her severely ; but, this he may
</p>
<p>have done on the mere suspicion of her having revealjxi some-
</p>
<p>thing to her " lover." Gladwyn unquestionably sought for in-
</p>
<p>formation through his spies ; that he obtained the detail
</p>
<p>from some warrior who was present at the Pottawatamie coun-
</p>
<p>cil is more probable than that he was saved by the devotion
</p>
<p>of his dusky mistress, who could, at best, have known very
</p>
<p>little about the great Chief's plans.
</p>
<p>Be this as it may, the Major was on the alert for the i>ro-
</p>
<p>mised visitation. His garrison was put in order for instant
</p>
<p>service  the men all being informed of the plot for their extir-
</p>
<p>pation, to stimulate them to sleepless vigilance. During the
</p>
<p>night of the 5th, an attack was apprehended, but none was
</p>
<p>made ; though the noise which came from the Indian camps
</p>
<p>gave evidence of unusual excitement among the savages.
</p>
<p>On the morning of May 6th a large number of canoes were
</p>
<p>discovered crossing the river above the fort. In each was seen
</p>
<p>two or three savages, but the deeply ladened craft, rowed with
</p>
<p>great care, proved its load to have been that of eight or ten men

<p>in each. The common around the fort soon swarmed with
</p>
<p>Indian women and children, as if nothing vmusual were on
</p>
<p>foot Evidence was given that the cut-throats were about to
</p>
<p>play a game of ball. This was part of the programme of mur-

</p>
<p>der  to distract the attention of the whites. A few stalwart
</p>
<p>warriors, more respectable than the common herd, by being
</p>
<p>clad in blankets and tricked out in feathers, straggled up to
</p>
<p>the gates, and, one by one, were admitted. These were the
</p>
<p>fellows commissioned to do the outside butchery. They scat-
</p>
<p>tered to all parts of the village within the enclosure, as if hav-
</p>
<p>ing no concert or design in their movements. Even the ma-
</p>
<p>lignant passions which had swayed their hearts for weeks were
</p>
<p>so far subdued as to leave their bronze faces as immobile as
</p>
<p>those of basilisks.
</p>
<p>Pontiac passed over with his chosen sixty above the fort
</p>
<p>They came down the river path, in solemn single file, making
</p>
<p>direct for the fort, which they reached about ten o'clock A. M.
</p>
<p>Gladwyn at once had the gates thrown open, and the delega-
</p>
<p>tion entered. To the dismay of the Chief he beheld the men
</p>
<p>all under arms ; even the traders and attaches of the fort were
</p>
<p>in line, armed with cutlasses, pistols and muskets. Pontiac
</p>
<p>knew that his plans had been betrayed, and, for a moment, it
</p>
<p>is said, he was staggered with his consciousness of baflSed hope
</p>
<p>and the storm of his indignation. Yet, with the stoicism of
</p>
<p>his race, he quickly assumed a haughty indifference, and pass-
</p>
<p>ed through the lines of armed men to the council-house as if on
</p>
<p>a mission of honor. To the unflinching gaze of the soldiery
</p>
<p>the red skins returned the malignant fire of eyes scintillating
</p>
<p>like those of the rattlesnake when coiled for his stroke, while
</p>
<p>their ferocious faces, bedaubed with, vermillion, ochre, white
</p>
<p>lead and soot, served to add to the disgust which the English
</p>
<p>ever had entertained for the race.
</p>
<p>Arrived at the council-house the Indians at once were given
</p>
<p>audience. They entered to find the officers there to receive
</p>
<p>them. In addition there stood a file of regulars, armed for
</p>
<p>duty. This reception looked as if the English were ready for
</p>
<p>the work of slaughter, while the brace of pistols in each oflEicer'a
</p>
<p>belt and the sword at his side, did not reassui-e the treacherous

</p>
<p>visitors of their own safety. But Pontiac preserved his cour-
</p>
<p>age and his temper. "Why," he asked of Gladwyn, " do I
</p>
<p>behold so many troops in the street ? " The Major rephed that

<p>his men were under arms for discipline and exercisa His air

</p>
<p>tf confidence was perfect Througliout the entire affair Glad-
</p>
<p>wyn acted with great courage and tact.
</p>
<p>At length the council was opened  a farce which must have
</p>
<p>galled the Indian's spirit like fire. To go through with it was,
</p>
<p>however, a necessity, if the Chief would not at once con-
</p>
<p>fess the truth of the English ofiicer's suspicions, Pontiao
</p>
<p>therfore entered upon his formal speech, holding in his ex-
</p>
<p>tended hand the wampum belt, which the conspirator had de-
</p>
<p>signed should play the important part in his proceedings.
</p>
<p>Before him sat and stood Gladwyn and his officers, with the
</p>
<p>bearing of men equal to and ready for the emergency  their
</p>
<p>eyes following the Chief's motions, and their hands ready to
</p>
<p>draw pistol at the first demonstration for reversing the belt.
</p>
<p>All this the orator perceived; he saw that even his pri-
</p>
<p>vate signal had been revealed ; he was baffled. The clang of
</p>
<p>aims, the roll of the drum, the file of soldiers at command,
</p>
<p>ta light him the propriety of prudence in demeanor as well as
</p>
<p>W3rds. His speech was simply one of professed good will : he
</p>
<p>desired to seal the bond of amity and friendship which the
</p>
<p>I] idians were solicitous ever should exist between them and the
</p>
<p>E aglish ; he asked that protection should be given them against
</p>
<p>traders and agents, and promised, in return, to make the tribes
</p>
<p>r presented behave themselves well. During the utterance of
</p>
<p>tltcse lying sentences the hand fell to his side which held the
</p>
<p>b3lt, nor did he extend it again. Once, it is stated, it was
</p>
<p>raised, when Gladwyn instinctively grasped his pistols and
</p>
<p>Pontiac at once closed his hollow harangue, discomfitted and
</p>
<p>overawed.
</p>
<p>The commandant replied, in a tone and manner calculated
</p>
<p>to leave no doubt on the savage mind of his purposes. He
</p>
<p>assured them of confidence and protection as long as they
</p>
<p>merited it, but added that the first act of aggi-ession  the first
</p>
<p>attempt at treachery  would be followed by vengeance. He
</p>
<p>advised the Chief and his followers to prudence, and said he

<p>should hold them to a strict accountability for every outrage
</p>
<p>which might be perpetrated by their tribes. With this he de-
</p>
<p>clared the council ended, and the bafiled barbarians were forc-

</p>
<p>meteors in a leaden sky ; their bedaubed visages could not
</p>
<p>conceal the commingled ferocity and disgust with which they
</p>
<p>were excited ; yet they had to choke their passions down and
</p>
<p>passed out in silence. Pontiac alone, the last to leave, re-
</p>
<p>marked to Griadwyn that he should soon visit him again,
</p>
<p>bringing along his squaws and children that they might all
</p>
<p>shake the hand of their English father. The Major made no
</p>
<p>reply to this, and the chief conspirator was permitted to de-
</p>
<p>part to concoct farther schemes of villainy. Why Gladwjm
</p>
<p>did not arrest him at once, along with his principle men, we
</p>
<p>are only left to conjecture. Doubtless he conceived it safest,
</p>
<p>considering his comparatively defenseless condition, to
</p>
<p>act leniently, nor do any act calculated to precipitate a war.
</p>
<p>His true course was to have held Pontiac as a hostage for ihe
</p>
<p>good behavior of his people, at least, until such time as Sir
</p>
<p>Jeffrey Amherst could place the garrison in a complete state
</p>
<p>of defense.
</p>
<p>In extenuation of the Chief's infamous conduct in this af-
</p>
<p>fair, his biographer says : " Here and elsewhere the conduct
</p>
<p>of Pontiac is marked with the blackest treachery; and one
</p>
<p>cannot but lament that a nature so brave, so commanding, so
</p>
<p>magnanimous, should be stained with the odious vice of cow-
</p>
<p>ards and traitors. He could govern, with almost despotic
</p>
<p>sway, a race as unruly as the winds. In generous thought
</p>
<p>and deed he rivalled the heroes of ancient story, and craft and
</p>
<p>cunning might well seem alien to a mind like his. Yet Pon-.
</p>
<p>tiac was a thorough savage, and in him stand forth, in strong-
</p>
<p>est light and shadow, the native faults and virtues of the
</p>
<p>Indian race. All children, says Sir Walter Scott, are natural-
</p>
<p>ly liars, and truth and honor are developments of later educa-
</p>
<p>tion. Barbarism is to civilization what childhood is to matu-
</p>
<p>rity, and all savages, whatever may be their country, their
</p>
<p>color, their lineage, are prone to treacheiy and deceit." All
</p>
<p>of which, we suppose, means that Pontiac was no more respon-

<p>sible for his misdeeds than a child. The same philosophy
</p>
<p>would cover the tiger and the cobra de capello with the cloak
</p>
<p>of innocence. The truth is, he was simply a monster, and,

</p>
<p>for his acts. The Enghsh were not sinless in offering the pro-
</p>
<p>vocation which aroused the fiend in the savage heart.
</p>
<p>The warriors alh withdrew beyond the pahsades and quickly
</p>
<p>disappeared. Pontiac at once hastened to his island home,
</p>
<p>enraged, it is said, like a madman. But his mind was bent on
</p>
<p>the accomplishment of his scheme, and he determined to try
</p>
<p>the further use of treachery. With this object in view he
</p>
<p>repaired the next day to Gladwyn's quarters, accompanied by
</p>
<p>three warriors, bearing the pipe of peace, considered even by
</p>
<p>the savages an emblem sacred to honor and truth. His de-
</p>
<p>sign was to convince the commandant that some bad bird liad
</p>
<p>lied in his ears. "We stand before you.," said the Chief, "as
</p>
<p>friends of the English, whom we love. We have therefore
</p>
<p>come, as chiefe, to smoke the pipe of peace." Whereupon all
</p>
<p>smoked, and Gladwyn did not say anything to excite suspicion
</p>
<p>among the Indians that he distrusted their truth. Before
</p>
<p>taking his leave Pontiac presented the calumet to Major Canvp-
</p>
<p>bell  the second officer in command at the station  as a con-
</p>
<p>vincing assurance of his peacefal intentions. During the after-
</p>
<p>noon of that day a grand game of ball was played on the com-
</p>
<p>mon before the palisades, by the several tribes, in further evi-
</p>
<p>dence of their good will. While it was in progress, however,
</p>
<p>Pontiac and the leading chiefs were in secret conclave, arrajig-
</p>
<p>ing for the fartherance of their plot. All was then arranged
</p>
<p>for an outbreak on the morrow and the installation of a siege,
</p>
<p>by which it was hoped to starve the garrison into a surrender.
</p>
<p>Eunners were dispatched to the Southern and Western tribes,
</p>
<p>advising them of the attack, and urging them to the seizure of
</p>
<p>every post within their territory.
</p>
<p>Monday morning. May 9th, the common to the west of the
</p>
<p>fort swarmed with savages, led by Pontiac in person. Advanc-
</p>
<p>ing from their midst, with a large retinue of braves, he so-
</p>
<p>licited leave to enter. The gates were barred against him. ELe
</p>
<p>demanded to know why he was refused admittance, when

</p>
<p>Gladwyn himself answered that the Cliief alone might enter 
</p>
<p>not one of his followers, to which Pontiac replied that they
</p>
<p>wished to smoke with their English father. The commandant
</p>
<p>rejoined, in phrase more curt than courteous, that he wanted

</p>
<p>none of them. This answer was the end of peace. Seeing
</p>
<p>that his hypocrisy and treachery were of no more avail, tlie
</p>
<p>Ottawa Chief strode haughtily away. His anger and chagrin
</p>
<p>were intense. He made at once for the river and embarked
</p>
<p>for his island, to prepare for the war path. His own disap-
</p>
<p>pointment was the signal for blood-letting, since the entire,
</p>
<p>half-concealed crowd leaped up, "shrieking like devils," and
</p>
<p>rushed away toward the first house on the common, where an
</p>
<p>old English woman and her two sons dwelt. In a few mo-
</p>
<p>ments the scalp-yell warned the garrison that the work of
</p>
<p>death had, indeed, commenced. After this act the Indians
</p>
<p>hastened to their canoes, and the common was quickly desert-
</p>
<p>ed. Members of the Ottawa tribe hastened to the Isle au
</p>
<p>Cochou, where an Englishman named Fisher dwelt, in fancied
</p>
<p>Becurity, under the protection of the great Chief He was
</p>
<p>caught and scalped'  Pontiac being ,too much employed
</p>
<p>with his own wild thoughts to care for the defenceless man.
</p>
<p>These atrocities were simply the premonitory symptoms of
</p>
<p>the storm to follow. All that night the village rang with the
</p>
<p>war whoop ; the war dance was performed in several neigh-
</p>
<p>btrhoods ; paint and war adornments were brought into requi-
</p>
<p>sition to fit the braves for the war path. All night long the
</p>
<p>watchful garrison heard the appalling noise of preparation in
</p>
<p>the Indian villages. Sentinels strained eye and ear to de-
</p>
<p>tect the approach of the lurking cut-throats, whose general
</p>
<p>attack was expected momentarily. But no attack was made.
</p>
<p>The Ottawas were busy in transporting their lodges and pro-
</p>
<p>perty over the river, as ordered by Pontiac, that nothing but
</p>
<p>a path should stand between him and his enemies. Messen-
</p>
<p>gers came and went among the tribes. It is wonderful with
</p>
<p>> Several Canadians passed over to the island, the next day, to give the body
</p>
<p>of Fisher burial. It was found and interred. Visiting the spot on the third day,
</p>
<p>the Canadians discovered the hands of the murdered man projecting from the
</p>
<p>ground, as if in an act of supplication. A second burial was, therefore made ; but

<p>the spirit of the dead would not grant repose to his remains. Going to the grave
</p>
<p>on the fourth day the men were alarmed at beholding the hands again protruding
</p>
<p>from the earth. This inspired them with a fear of supernatural agency, and they
</p>
<p>hastened to their French priest, who went to the grave and with holy water and
</p>
<p>chaunt appeased the restless soul. A mass afterwards celebrated gave the body
</p>
<p>eternal quiet.
</p>
<p>THE ASSAULT ON THE FORT. 61
</p>
<p>wbat rapidity news of the outbreak flew over the country.
</p>
<p>The savages of Lake Superior and those dwelling in the Wa-
</p>
<p>bash and Maumee vallies seemed to have received and acted
</p>
<p>upon the orders of Pontiac within a few days after the first
</p>
<p>demonstrations of the 9th. A little party, comprised of Sir
</p>
<p>Robert Davers and Captain Robertson, with their Canadian
</p>
<p>guides, was coming down the St. Clair river. It was waylaid
</p>
<p>and the two officers murdered  the Canadians in all instances
</p>
<p>being spared. One of these mongrel Frenchmen came in with
</p>
<p>the sad news during the evening of Monday, and also brought
</p>
<p>the further report that a large body of Ojibwas from Saginaw
</p>
<p>had joined Pontiac, eager for slaughter. If the Ottawas were
</p>
<p>the tigers of the forest the Ojibwas may be called the hyenas :
</p>
<p>a more detestable tribe of human beings never existed than
</p>
<p>those fierce people of the Saginaw woods.
</p>
<p>Early dawn of Tuesday, May 10th, brought the expected
</p>
<p>assault As the rosy light began to streak the east there came
</p>
<p>from the woods around Detroit such a shout as might be cred-
</p>
<p>ited to the fiends of darkness. It was enough to appal the
</p>
<p>stoutest heart in the little garrison, for it proved that not a
</p>
<p>hundred but thousands of savages were on the war path thirst-
</p>
<p>ing for blood. A rain of rifle balls soon rattled against the
</p>
<p>wooden ramparts; soon every loop hole was rimmed with
</p>
<p>lead lodged in the logs by the unerring rifles of the assailants,
</p>
<p>who were distributed over the entire half circle of the fort's
</p>
<p>three points on the north, west and south. They lurked be-
</p>
<p>hind trees, stumps and logs, behind houses and barns, behind
</p>
<p>ridges in the ground and the crest of a hill to the west. From
</p>
<p>these coverts they fired in safety but without efiect. Seeing
</p>
<p>this they took shelter behind a cluster of buildings within
</p>
<p>short range of the palisades, from which they threw a severe
</p>
<p>fire. A hat or jacket thrust before the openings, or above the
</p>
<p>pickets, was sure to be riddled with balls. Gladwyn's men
</p>
<p>soon entered with spirit into the contest, while the traders and

</p>
<p>employees answered the Indian yell with notes of defiance and
</p>
<p>scorn. Little firing was done by the garrison, though all were
</p>
<p>alert to pick off any savage who showed himself An occa-
</p>
<p>sional shriek of agony told the death story for a " brave" who
</p>
<p>52 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>had been imprudent enongli to betray enougb of bis person
</p>
<p>for a target.
</p>
<p>The commandant, resolved to get rid of tbe buildings too
</p>
<p>close to tbe fort for comfort, opened on tbem witb his cannon
</p>
<p> of wbicb be bad two six-pounders, and one tbree-pounder,
</p>
<p>besides three bomb-mortars, but all of an inferior character.
</p>
<p>They served a good purpose, however, for the Indians stood
</p>
<p>in mortal fear of their terrible power. A few spikes were
</p>
<p>heated red hot and shot into the buildings referred to : in a
</p>
<p>few moments all were ablaze, and the red skins fled from them
</p>
<p>in the greatest terror. The sharp shooters were ready to pick
</p>
<p>off the rascals as they ran from cover, but, so odd was the sight,
</p>
<p>BO ludicrous the fright and distortion of the savages, that the
</p>
<p>marksmen could only laugh.
</p>
<p>Thus the morning wore away and Pontiac learned that such
</p>
<p>warfare could not accomplish any thing, further than to ex-
</p>
<p>haust his supply of ammunition and to weary his patience.
</p>
<p>He therefore withdrew his force to concert more vigorous and
</p>
<p>united action. By noon of Tuesday all was still again save
</p>
<p>the occasional crack of the rifle of some brave still watching
</p>
<p>for his victim. This cessation led Gladwyn to think the affair
</p>
<p>some sudden outbreak only, which negotiation could reconcile;
</p>
<p>and, as he was in want of supplies for any siege which might
</p>
<p>be made, he resolved to open communication with Pontiac 
</p>
<p>hoping to obtain some corn if not any satisfactory explanation
</p>
<p>o:^ the hostility shown. The Canadians, being neutrals, afford-
</p>
<p>ed a ready medium of intercourse with the Chief During
</p>
<p>the afternoon La Butte, the French interpreter, accompanied
</p>
<p>by Chapeton and Godefroy, two old Canadians of good repute
</p>
<p>with the Indians, made his way up to the Ottawa village, then
</p>
<p>located only one mile and three-quarters away, over what is
</p>
<p>now called Bloody Eun  a small stream emptying into the
</p>
<p>Detroit river just below the Isle au Cochou (now called Hog
</p>
<p>Island). These men were received by Pontiac without any

</p>
<p>show of anger, and their interview soon gave promise of such
</p>
<p>good results that La Butte made his way back to the fort to
</p>
<p>report the good tidings. Eeturning to the Ottawa village
</p>
<p>again he found the two Canadians hopeless : Pontiac was im-
</p>
<p>BETRAYAL OF MAJOR CAMPBELL. 53
</p>
<p>movable as an oak, and refused every proposal for terms of
</p>
<p>peace, througli professing to desii-e it. A conference of chiefs
</p>
<p>was finally held, when Pontiac declared their wish for a con-
</p>
<p>ference with their "English father"  mentioning Major Camp-
</p>
<p>bell, for whom the savages entertained a real respect. This
</p>
<p>proposal was laid before Gladwyn. Knowing so well the
</p>
<p>treacherous nature of Pontiac he opposed the mission ; but
</p>
<p>Campbell, counting on his influence and good standing witli
</p>
<p>the several tribes, begged permission to make the venture. He
</p>
<p>at length passed out of the fort, attended by Lieutenant Mc-
</p>
<p>Dougal, La Butte and several Canadians. Almost at the gates
</p>
<p>of the fort he was met by two messengers sent by M. Gouin to
</p>
<p>warn him of the treachery intended. This person had circu-
</p>
<p>lated through the Ottawa camp expressly to discover the de-
</p>
<p>signs on foot, and had learned enough to convince him of the
</p>
<p>perfidious nature of the proposal for a mission. But, Major
</p>
<p>Campbell was too strong in his convictions of safety in Pontiac's
</p>
<p>hands, and he refused to return. Passing on he soon came to
</p>
<p>the bridge over the creek leading into the Indian village. Once
</p>
<p>over it he had passed forever from retreat or friendly aid. He
</p>
<p>wa.s quickly beset by a great crowd of women, children and
</p>
<p>half grown boys, who would have assaulted him at once had
</p>
<p>not the Chief come forward for his protection. Pontiac led the
</p>
<p>veteran officer and his aid to the central lodge where mats
</p>
<p>were laid for their comfort. The lodge was soon filed with
</p>
<p>warriors, who pressed in sullen silence in and around the place
</p>
<p>to hear what was said.
</p>
<p>Campbell at once made a speech  stating his surprise at the
</p>
<p>breaking of the peace which had so long existed. He asked
</p>
<p>its cause, and said if any grievance existed the English fathers
</p>
<p>would consider it their duty to correct it. To this no reply
</p>
<p>was returned. Around the two men stood a wall of savages,
</p>
<p>silent as Sphinxes, and as heartless as the Aztec God of Sacri-
</p>
<p>fice. For one long hour they sat there awaiting a response ;

</p>
<p>yet none came. Campbell read his fate in that calm. He
</p>
<p>finally arose to his feet and declared his purpose to return to
</p>
<p>the fort, but, with a gesture of authority, the Chief bade him
</p>
<p>be seated again : " My father," he said significantly, " will sleep

</p>
<p>to-niglit in the lodges of his red children." Then the solemn
</p>
<p>silence was broken, and the Indians betrayed unmistakable
</p>
<p>signs of violence ; but Campbell and McDougal were led away
</p>
<p>by the Chief and placed under guard in the house of a Cana-
</p>
<p>dian named Meloche. La Butte returned late in the evening
</p>
<p>to the fort to report his sad tidings : all present felt that their
</p>
<p>revered officer and friend were indeed lost to them forever.
</p>
<p>Two Ojibwas, then prisoners in the fort, were set apart as host-
</p>
<p>ages for the Englishmen's safety.
</p>
<p>This detention of an embassy which Pontiac himself had
</p>
<p>sought, is not the least perfidious of his many acts of dishonor.
</p>
<p>Had the officers been sent by Gladwyn, their detention as
</p>
<p>prisoners of war might not have been inadmissable in savage
</p>
<p>warfare ; but, the detestable falsehood by which they were
</p>
<p>lured to the Indian camp, and their imprisonment to await the
</p>
<p>issue of events, reflect upon Pontiac's memory a stain which
</p>
<p>no special pleading for the " untutored mind" will wipe away.
</p>
<p>It was, like many others' of his proceedings, the work of a
</p>
<p>monster in pei-fidy.^
</p>
<p>The imprisonment of Campbell was followed by active ope-
</p>
<p>rations. Pontiac, having resolved to accept no terms save a
</p>
<p>total surrender of the garrison, post,, property and the two
</p>
<p>armed vessels lying off the fort, prepared to press the siege so
</p>
<p>closely as to compel Gladwyn to surrender from the mere want
</p>
<p>of provisions  of which he knew a short supply only existed.
</p>
<p>A large body of Wyandots having become somewhat Chris-
</p>
<p>tianized by the influence of a Jesuit priest had, thus far, re-
</p>
<p>fused to participate in the conspiracy. These non-combatants
</p>
<p>the great Chief threatened with dire vengeance if they longer
</p>
<p>refused to enter upon the war path. Stipulating that they
</p>
<p>should be permitted to attend the celebration of mass before
</p>
<p>dancing the war dance, these converts entered into the conflict
</p>
<p>* Major Campbell was not long afterwards murdered by the Chief of the
</p>
<p>Ojibwas. His body was horribly mutilated, and, it is stated, his heart  being that

<p>of a brave man  was eaten by his murderers to give them courage. It does not
</p>
<p>relieve Pontiac from the responsibility of the murder that he was so incensed at

<p>tke Ojibwa Chief as to send him away to Saginaw.

<p>INVESTMENT OF THE FORT. 55
</p>
<p>"witli great zeal and became Pontiac's most tireless and efficient
</p>
<p>warriors.'
</p>
<p>The disposition made by Pontiac of his forces was such as
</p>
<p>to invest the fort perfectly, except upon its river front. Off
</p>
<p>the fort, out in the stream, most fortunately for the garrison,
</p>
<p>lay two small vessels, both armed and ready for service as
</p>
<p>transports or for defense. These kept open the communica-
</p>
<p>tion by water ; all other approaches were closed by the savages,
</p>
<p>who, after May 12th, swarmed over the entire vicinity, occu-
</p>
<p>pying every position where a good shot might be likely to re-
</p>
<p>ward the vigilant brave.
</p>
<p>Gladwyn, beholding these menacing preparations for his de-
</p>
<p>struction, for the first time listened to the suggestions of his
</p>
<p>officers and men regarding an evacuation of the post, while it
</p>
<p>was yet possible, and an escape by the transports to Niagara.
</p>
<p>On the evening of the 12th, after sustaining a day's sharp fire
</p>
<p>from the assailing horde without, the commandant convened
</p>
<p>his officers to decide the question of evacuation. According
</p>
<p> Father Pothier's moral teachings seem to have struck no deeper into the
</p>
<p>savage heart than the teachings of evangelists since. The number of good Chris-
</p>
<p>tians made out of the western and north-western tribes in one hundred years
</p>
<p>would only startle the reader by its absurd minuteness when contrasted with the
</p>
<p>efforts made. We may refer to a case which came under our own personal knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, as illustrative of the fact that despite all apparent civilization, the Indian
</p>
<p>never forgets his wild instincts :
</p>
<p>A Wyandot, belonging to one of the leading families of his tribe, was educated
</p>
<p>in Northern Ohio, and proved to be a man of fine talents. After leaving school he
</p>
<p>studied law, was admitted to practice, married a most amiable and accomplished
</p>
<p>woman  the daughter of a leading elder in the Methodist church  and gave pro-
</p>
<p>mise of a useful, perhaps a brilliant, career. He was, in time, put in nomination by
</p>
<p>the Whig party for the ofiBce of Prosecuting Attorney for which he was admirably
</p>
<p>fitted. At the election he was defeated, doubtless from the popular prejudice
</p>
<p>againss Indian blood. The defeat so stung his pride that the native spirit in a day
</p>
<p>overwhelmed his ambition and his civilization. He soon returned to his tribe

<p>(then living on the Wyandot Reservation near Upper Sandusky, Ohio), to become
</p>
<p>a common Indian in pursuits and tastes.
</p>
<p>Similar cases are mentioned by historians. One, referred to we think by Stone,
</p>
<p>in his excellent " Life of Thayendanega" (Brandt) Chief of the Six Nations, where
</p>
<p>a young and talented Indian was educated for the ministry and entered with zeal
</p>
<p>upon his labors for some time ; when suddenly he disappeared, leaving behind him
</p>
<p>all his " civilized" property in clothes, books, &c., to become one of his tribe
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>56 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>to a letter published in the old Pennsylvania Gazette (No. 1803)
</p>
<p>the Major alone is represented to have opposed the evacuation,
</p>
<p>and declared for holding out to the last extremity  hoping for
</p>
<p>reenforcements and supplies. This decision, it would appear,
</p>
<p>prevailed. Every arrangement was made for the defense.
</p>
<p>The scanty store of provisions  enough for about three weeks'
</p>
<p>sustenance upon close rations  was carefully gathered and put
</p>
<p>under lock and key, that not a morsel should be wasted-
</p>
<p>Water tanks were provided for use, in case of attempts by the
</p>
<p>savages to set the thatch roofs of the buildings on fire by means
</p>
<p>of arrows loaded with burning tow ; while the most tireless
</p>
<p>vigilance was enjoined among officers and men. How that
</p>
<p>vigilance was enforced may be inferred from the letter of an
</p>
<p>officer of the garrison, written under date of July 6tli, 1763 :
</p>
<p>" We have been besieged here two Months, by Six Hundred Indians.
</p>
<p>We have been upon the Watch Night and Day, from the Command-
</p>
<p>ing Ofhcer to the lowest soldier, and have not had our Cloaths oflF,
</p>
<p>nor slept all Night since it began ; we shall continue so til we have
</p>
<p>a Reinfoi"cement up."
</p>
<p>The indefatigable commandant had to use all his art to cope
</p>
<p>with his tireless foe. The vessels lying off shore were yet
</p>
<p>kept under the fort's guns, apprehending, as Gladwyn did, that
</p>
<p>Pontiac might try to effect their capture by boarding. Their
</p>
<p>guns swept the entire northern and southern face of the pali-
</p>
<p>sades  thus deterring the savages from any general assault.
</p>
<p>No occasion was lost for picking off every red skin who show-
</p>
<p>ed himself within range. Food was surreptitiously thrown
</p>
<p>into the place from over the river at night, by the aid of friend-
</p>
<p>ly Canadians. This beneficent act enabled the garrison to
</p>
<p>hold out, much to the astonishment of the Indians, who were,
</p>
<p>for a long time, kept in ignorance of the supplies sent over by
</p>
<p>boats. It was the Indians, indeed, who first wanted for food.
</p>
<p>Their improvidence had not been restricted by a state of war :
</p>
<p>they ate and wasted with the recklessness of fools. Thus their

<p>own stores of corn and cured meat was, ere long, exhausted,
</p>
<p>when they began to plunder the farm houses of the hahitans to
</p>
<p>such a degree as compelled the Canadians to protest and de-
</p>
<p>mand protection of Pontiac. A deputation of fifteen old resi-
</p>

</p>
<p>dents visited the Cliief, laying their complaints before him,
</p>
<p>and threatening that when the French father came from Mont-
</p>
<p>real " with his great army," he would punish the Indians as
</p>
<p>enemies/
</p>
<p>To this the Chief replied, extenuating the acts of the young
</p>
<p>men by reciting his own services in behalf of the Canadians,
</p>
<p>and particularly by referring to his co-operation, in the war
</p>
<p>with the Sac and Fox Indians, when he united with the
</p>
<p>French and assisted in defeating the Northern tribes  a war
</p>
<p>of which no historical record exists, though Parkman has suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded in finding a confirmation of Pontiac's version of it in
</p>
<p>the Mss. of McDougaP  the officer who accompanied Major
</p>
<p>Campbell in his mission to Pontiac, May 10th. Pontiac re-
</p>
<p>peated the story of a French army of invasion, and hoped that
</p>
<p>when it arrived all the Canadians who had assisted the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish would be attended to. The Chief gave promise of protec-
</p>
<p>tion but still reserved the right to provide himself and his war-
</p>
<p>riors with food at the Canadians' expense. To this end, while
</p>
<p>his mandate was sufficient to protect the farmers from plunder,
</p>
<p>it was also potent enough to draw from their stores the sup-
</p>
<p>plies which the savages required. He established a depot at
</p>
<p>the house of Meloche, where, using several Frenchmen as as-
</p>
<p>sistants, the provisions were stored and issued in rations, to
</p>
<p>prevent improvidence. To the Canadians thus relieved of
</p>
<p>It would appear that, despite the news then generally disseminated throughout
</p>
<p>Canada and the Western posts, of the consummation of the treaty of February lOth,
</p>
<p>by which the French ceded to England all their possessions in the region named,
</p>
<p>tJiere still prevailed a belief in the Canadas of a French invasion to regain their
</p>
<p>lost supremacy. This is referred to by Gladwyn  in a letter to Sir Jeffrey Amherst,
</p>
<p>dated July 8th, 1765  as the cause of the uprising among the Indians. Before the
</p>
<p>arrival of news regarding the treaty, Pontiac had dispatched agents to M. Neyou,
</p>
<p>French Commandant in the Illinois country, requesting his co-operation in the
</p>
<p>reduction of Detroit. Pontiac, however, knew before hostilities had progressed a
</p>
<p>month, that no co-operation could or would be extended by the French ; but he

<p>preferred to keep the fires burning, by representing to the tribes of the vast sec-
</p>
<p>tion then seething in the throes of the conspiracy, that the French army would
</p>
<p>Burely come to their aid. His falsehood and duplicity toward his own people were
</p>
<p>only exceeded in baseness by his treachery and cruelty toward his enemies.
</p>
<p>' McDougal, it would appear, succeeded in effecting his escape from captivity
</p>
<p>among the Ottawas, and afterwards wrote out voluminous notes of the war. Tho

<p>documents are yet unpublished.

</p>
<p>their property he gave notes or certificates of indebtedness,
</p>
<p>written on birch bark and signed by the Chief with his totem
</p>
<p>signet, the otter. The issue of these rough evidences of in-
</p>
<p>debtedness is regarded by the Chief's biographers as indicat-
</p>
<p>ive of remarkable intelUgence in a savage. As the Chief was
</p>
<p>surrounded by men who well knew the value of, and the mode
</p>
<p>of preparing, notes of hand, it is to be presumed that, to recon-
</p>
<p>cile the Canadians to the levies made upon them, he acceded
</p>
<p>to their demands for evidences, and simply gave what was re-
</p>
<p>quired. No remarkable sagacity or intelhgence were requisite
</p>
<p>for such an act.
</p>
<p>We may, before pursuing the narrative of operations at and
</p>
<p>around Detroit, recur to the fall of those posts, in the then In-
</p>
<p>dian country, against which the Conspiracy was du'ected.
</p>
<p>Fort Sandusky was taken May 16th, by the treachery of the
</p>
<p>Wyandots. These Indians having been admitted freely to the
</p>
<p>fortification were regarded as friends. On the morning of the
</p>
<p>day named seven well known warriors applying for admission,
</p>
<p>were at once given an audience by Ensign Paully, command-
</p>
<p>ant of the post. The visitoi's having seated themselves seem-
</p>
<p>ingly prepared for a smoke, when, a signal being given by one
</p>
<p>of the number stationed near the door, Paully was seized and
</p>
<p>disarmed. At the same moment a peculiar noise without in-
</p>
<p>formed him that the work of slaughter was going on among
</p>
<p>his men. He was soon led from the room to behold the jja-
</p>
<p>rade strewn with the corpses of his troops. He was borne at
</p>
<p>once to the lake where canoes were in readiness, and his late
</p>
<p>friends paddled away for Detroit, offering the Ensign the sweet
</p>
<p>consolation of being burnt at the stake for Pontiac's edification.
</p>
<p>The light of his burning fort lit him on his way over the wa-
</p>
<p>ters. He was conducted to the Ottawa camp, where for a sea-
</p>
<p>son he served as a mark for the bludgeons and arrows of the
</p>
<p>women and children  a torture inflicted on all prisoners as
</p>
<p>preliminary to the severer tortures inflicted by the men. The

<p>poor prisoner was, however, saved from the fate in store, by
</p>
<p>being chosen as the husband of an old woman whose partner

<p>Indian of the Ottawa tribe. He afterwards succeeded in es-

<p>caping from the love embraces of his coffee-skinned spouse,
</p>
<p>and found refuge in Detroit.
</p>
<p>The old post at St. Joseph fell on the 25th of May. Located
</p>
<p>on Lake Michigan, at the mouth of St. Joseph river, it was
</p>
<p>indeed far removed from civilization, yet hut fourteen men gar-'
</p>
<p>risoned the place ! A few runners of the Pottawatamies came
</p>
<p>during the evening previous, to " visit" that section of their
</p>
<p>tribe located near the fort. They bore Pontiac's order for the
</p>
<p>sacrifice of the garrison. On the morning of the 25th a great
</p>
<p>throng of savages (Pottawatamies) gathered around the place,
</p>
<p>and numbers found entrance within the garrison grounds, to
</p>
<p>play the usual game of pei'fidy and slaughter. The command-
</p>
<p>ant, Ensign Schlosser, with three men, were spared and taken
</p>
<p>to Detroit to be exchanged for Indians then in Gladwyn's
</p>
<p>possession.
</p>
<p>On the 27th of May, Fort Miami, on the Maumee river, in
</p>
<p>Ohio, (just above the present town of Maumee,) passed into
</p>
<p>the hands of the savages and Canadians. Its capture was ac-
</p>
<p>companied by treachery of an unusual character. A Miami
</p>
<p>belle was the mistress of Ensign Holmes, then in charge of
</p>
<p>the post. His bronze beauty came to him on the morn-
</p>
<p>ing of May 27th, representing a squaw to be dangerously ill,
</p>
<p>begging him to visit the wigwam, not far off. Holmes had
</p>
<p>suspected, from various signs, that the savages around him
</p>
<p>meditated treachery, and was on his guard ; but, conceiving
</p>
<p>no perfidy to stain the heart of his companion, he at once fol-
</p>
<p>lowed her from the fort to the wigwams lying out of sight
</p>
<p>though not far from the fortification. Once within their pre-
</p>
<p>cincts he was shot instantly. His sergeant, hearing the firing,
</p>
<p>and fearing the worst, passed' out to reconnoitre, when he w^as
</p>
<p>seized. This left the post quite at the mercy of the savages.
</p>
<p>The garrison soon was summoned to surrender  the summons
</p>
<p>coming from white men, Canadians, who were engaged with
</p>
<p>the Indians. Having a promise of protection if no defense

<p>was made, the little garrison isolated beyond hope of help or
</p>

<p>approach to the Wabash valley, was lost to the EnglisL

<p>60 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>Fort Ouatanon, on the Wabash river, in Indiana (below the
</p>
<p>present town of La Fayette,) was captured June 1st, by the Il-
</p>
<p>linois, by stratagem, as its commandant reported in a letter to
</p>
<p>Gladwyn dated at that time. The Illinois, far removed from the
</p>
<p>influence of civilisation, were comparatively a peaceful people.
</p>
<p>Acting under the influence of orders which they dare not dis-
</p>
<p>obey, they took the garrison prisoners and treated them kind-
</p>
<p>ly. This action proves how far-reaching was the power of the
</p>
<p>fierce Ottawa Chief
</p>
<p>Fort Michilmacinac fell June 4th, by the hands of the Ojib-
</p>
<p>was and Sacs. That most important post lay on the apex of
</p>
<p>the peninsula of Michigan, like a point of steel to serve as the
</p>
<p>entering wedge for civilization and commerce to the North.
</p>
<p>Its great importance and extreme isolation, however, did not
</p>
<p>Bee it properly garrisoned. It was held by about forty men
</p>
<p>under command of Captain Etheringtoru Nearly fifty other
</p>
<p>whites were at the post at the date of its fall, to partake of its
</p>
<p>disaster. The day preceding the fatal day, the Ojibwas inform-
</p>
<p>ed the people of the garrison of their intention to play a game
</p>
<p>of ball  baggatiway  for a wager, inviting all to witness it
</p>
<p>As the 4th was the King's birth day Captain Etherington per-
</p>
<p>mitted his men to enjoy the holiday, and very little caution
</p>
<p>was used in securing the fort. Discipline probably was forgot-
</p>
<p>ten. Captain Etherington and several of his officers passed
</p>
<p>out on the plain to witness the game, while the soldiers of the
</p>
<p>gaiTison flung open the gates and admitted a number of gaily
</p>
<p>clad squaws who were eager apparently for the society of
</p>
<p>the whites. They were conspirators in disguise; beneath
</p>
<p>each gaudy mantle was concealed the tomahawk soon to reek
</p>
<p>with the brains and blood of the unsuspicious victims. During
</p>
<p>the progress of the exciting game, in which four hundred sav-
</p>
<p>ages participated, the ball was steadily pressed up toward the
</p>
<p>palisades, and, finally, with one tremendous stroke of the bat
</p>
<p>it was sent circling clear over the enclosure. With a wild

<p>shout and a furious rush the whole throng rushed to the gates,
</p>
<p>and, before officers or men were aware, the Indians were all
</p>
<p>within. Then came the work of slaughter. On the air arose

<p>the defiant war whoop. From beneath the squaws' blankets

<p>flew the iron hatcliets and knives commissioned to the work
</p>
<p>of death, and, in a brief space of time, every English soldier on
</p>
<p>the parade was murdered and scalped. A trader who was present,
</p>
<p>escaped by the protection aiforded by a French resident. We
</p>
<p>may quote a few paragraphs from his intensely interesting
</p>
<p>though appalling narrative :
</p>
<p>" Going instantly to my window, I saw a crowd of Indians within the
</p>
<p>fort, furiously cutting down and scalping every Englishman they found.
</p>
<p>In particular, I witnessed the fate of Lieutenant Jemette.
</p>
<p>" I had, in the room in which I was, a fowling-piece, loaded with
</p>
<p>swan-shot. This I immediately seized, and held it for a few minutes,
</p>
<p>waiting to hear the drum beat to arms. In this dreadful interval I saw
</p>
<p>several of my countrymen fall, and more than one struggling between
</p>
<p>the knees of an Indian, who, holding him in this manner, scalped him
</p>
<p>while yet alive.
</p>
<p>" At length, disappointed in the hope of resistance made to the enemy,
</p>
<p>and sensible, of course, that no eftbrt of my own unassisted arm could
</p>
<p>avail against four hundred Indians, I thought only of seeking shelter.
</p>
<p>Amid the slaughter which was raging, I observed many of the Canadian
</p>
<p>inhabitants of the fort looking calmly on, neither opposing the Indis.ns
</p>
<p>nor suffering injury ; and from this circumstance I conceived a hope of
</p>
<p>finding a place of security in their houses.
</p>
<p>. "Between the yard-door of my own house and that of M. Langlade,
</p>
<p>my next neighbor, there was only a low fence, over which I easily
</p>
<p>climbed. At my entrance, I found the whole family at the windows,
</p>
<p>gazing on the scene of blood before them, I addressed myself im-
</p>
<p>mediately to Langlade, begging that he would put me in some place
</p>
<p>of safety, till the heat of the aiiair should be over  an act of charity
</p>
<p>by which he might perhaps preserve me from the general massacre ;
</p>
<p>but while I uttered my petition, M. Langlade, who had looked for
</p>
<p>a moment at me, turned again to the window, shrugging his shoul-
</p>
<p>ders, and intimating that he could do nothing for me : ' Que voudriez-
</p>
<p>vous que fen ferau f '

<p>woman, a slave of M. Langlade's beckoned me to follow her. She
</p>
<p>brought me to a door, which she opened, desiring me to enter, and
</p>
<p>telling me that it led to the garret, where I must go and conceal
</p>
<p>myself. I joyfully obeyed her directions ; and she, having followed
</p>
<p>me up to the garret door, locked it after me, and, with great pre-
</p>
<p>sence of mind, took away the key,

<p>62 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>fort, I beheld, in shapes the foulest and most terrible, the ferocious
</p>
<p>triumphs of barbarian conquerors. The dead were scalped and man-
</p>
<p>gled, and the dying were writhing and shrieking under the unsati-
</p>
<p>ated knife and tomahawk, and from the bodies of some, ripped open,
</p>
<p>the savage butchers were drinking the blood, scooped up in the hol-
</p>
<p>low of joined hands, and quaffed amid shouts of rage and victory.
</p>
<p>I was shaken not only with horror, but with fear. The sufferings
</p>
<p>which I witnessed, I seemed on the point of experiencing. No long
</p>
<p>time elapsed before  every one being destroyed who could be found
</p>
<p> there was a general cry of ' All is finished ! ' "
</p>
<p>All was indeed finished, so far as the destruction of the gar-
</p>
<p>rison was concerned. The of&cers were spared the general
</p>
<p>butchery by being run off into the woods. They were after-
</p>
<p>wards transferred to the keeping of the Ottawus from the Jes-
</p>
<p>uit station of LArbee Crocha, twenty-six miles west of the fort
</p>
<p>A good priest, Father Jonois, exerted all his influence in be-
</p>
<p>half of the captives, and, at Captain Etherington's request,
</p>
<p>made the arduous journey to Detroit to inform Gladwyn of
</p>
<p>the extent of the disaster. He arrived in Detroit June 19th,
</p>
<p>bearing a letter from the Captain in which, after detailing the
</p>
<p>e^rents of the massacre, he begged for Gladwyn's immediate
</p>
<p>co-operation to regain the post  not knowing the extent of the
</p>
<p>latter commander's own great wants.
</p>
<p>Although the post at Sault St Marie was abandoned in the
</p>
<p>fall of 1762, its garrison did not escape the fate of Michilmaci-
</p>
<p>nac, for most of the men were victims in that massacre. A
</p>
<p>fire having partially destroyed their fortifications, they had
</p>
<p>been thrown into the fort on the south side of the Straits to
</p>
<p>await orders, or reenforcements before re-occupying the Sault
</p>
<p>station. Alas, they never returned !

<p>The Green Bay station, though, by the prudence of its com-
</p>

<p>of its garrison of seventeen men, was abandoned. After vari-

</p>
<p>to Sir Jeffrey Amherst as the only garrison of his western

<p>forts which had escaped destruction. Detroit alone held out,

<p>but how long could it escape the calamity impending ?

<p>The day succeeding Father Jonois' visit to Detroit, Gladwyn

<p>FALL OF THE WESTERN POSTS. 63
</p>
<p>received news of tlie loss, after an oliitinate defense, of Presqu'
</p>
<p>Isle, on Lake Erie (now Erie, Pa.) This news was confirmed
</p>
<p>by the appearance, on the banks of the river opposite Detroit,
</p>
<p>of a band of prisoners  the remnant of the brave garrison. It
</p>
<p>was not until after the escape of Ensign Christie, several weeks-
</p>
<p>later, from the Ottawas' village, that Gladwyn was informed
</p>
<p>of the full measure of the calamity. A band of Ottawas and
</p>
<p>Wyandots having been dispatched by Pontiac for the reduc-
</p>
<p>tion of the post, appeared before the post on the 15th of June.
</p>
<p>The little band of defenders retired to the strong block house,
</p>
<p>where they made a defense quite memorable in the history of
</p>
<p>Indian wars. All day long, having the vantage ground of
</p>
<p>excellent breastworks, the savages pressed the assault so deter-
</p>
<p>minedly as to task the English to their utmost to save their
</p>
<p>fortress. A number of times it was in flames, which were only
</p>
<p>qxienched by the use of the water preserved in barrels for the
</p>
<p>sustenance of the men. During the night the poor fellows had
</p>
<p>tO' work to sink a shaft for water, and, by morning, were re-
</p>
<p>warded for their exhausting endeavors. The precious fluid
</p>
<p>was needed, for early in the day of June 18th, the Indians
</p>
<p>h,ftving approached the garrison grounds by a mine, succeeded
</p>
<p>ii'i firing the commandant's house, so near the block house as
</p>
<p>8' on to set the httle citadel again in flames. With the water,
</p>
<p>h ( great exertions, the place of refuge was once more preserv-
</p>
<p>ed. During the 1 8th the fight was most obstinately waged,
</p>
<p>aiad night came to find Christie's men thoroughly prostrated
</p>
<p>from excessive labor. Still, they had to watch and fight on amid
</p>
<p>an atmosphere hot with fire and clogged with gunpowder
</p>
<p>smoke. At midnight a voice from without, in French, sum-
</p>
<p>moned the garrison to surrender, stating that preparations had
</p>
<p>been perfected for efiectually firing the block house. After a
</p>
<p>brief parley an armistice was obtained for the night, when the
</p>
<p>men were permitted to sleep. In the morning, after ascertain-
</p>
<p>ing that the enemy had indeed prepared to roast the ganison

<p>alive, Christie surrendered, stipulating that himself and garri-
</p>
<p>son should be permitted to make their way to the nearest post

</p>
<p>Pontiac kept them closely confined in defiance of tlie express
</p>
<p>terms of the surrender. As stated, Christie, ere long, by gi-eat
</p>
<p>daring escaped and reached Gladwyn in safety. The gallant
</p>
<p>fellow afterwards made a report, embodying the incidents of
</p>
<p>the defense.
</p>
<p>The posts nearest Presqu' Isle were those of La Beuf, and
</p>
<p>Venango  both on the direct trail to Fort Pitt, now Pitts-
</p>
<p>burg, Pa. The first was assailed on the evening of the 18th
</p>
<p>of June, by a detachment of the force then besieging Fort
</p>
<p>Presqu' Isle. It was soon in flames from fire arrows and flaming
</p>
<p>balls of pitch. The savages gathered around the gateway,
</p>
<p>waiting for the egress of their prey ; but while the flames were
</p>
<p>roaring above and around him Ensign Price, the commandant,
</p>
<p>was cutting his way oat through the rear walls. An openiiig
</p>
<p>having been effected he and his men all escaped, under cover
</p>
<p>of the darkness to the woods, proposing to find their way to
</p>
<p>Fort Pitt. They struck off" into the wilderness leaving tJie
</p>
<p>savages dancing and yelling before the front gate, in the beli'if
</p>
<p>that the whites were roasting alive within. Price pressed on
</p>
<p>to Yenango, where he arrived on the succeeding night to fi'nd
</p>
<p>nothing of that fort but embers, around which he was horror
</p>
<p>stricken to find the half consumed bodies of its little guard.
</p>
<p>It had been seized several days previously by the Senecas,
</p>
<p>who, having obtained admittance under pretence of friendship,
</p>
<p>butchered all the garrison except Lieutenant Gordon, the com-
</p>
<p>mandant. Him they reserved for the slow torture by fire.
</p>
<p>For sevei'al days, while the wretches feasted upon the garrison
</p>
<p>stores, and became infuri^ated over the whisky which always
</p>
<p>formed a leading article of supplies, they enjoyed their leisure
</p>
<p>moments in roasting the hapless commandant. He finally died
</p>
<p>under the torture, and, the stores having been consumed or
</p>
<p>wasted, the fiends set fire to the property and left that vicinity.
</p>
<p>Had Price and his little body guard arrived a day sooner it is
</p>
<p>horrible to think what must have been his fate. As it was,

</p>
<p>gave out on the way from Venango to Fort Pitt, and were left
</p>
<p>in the woods to perish of starvation. The Ensign and seven
</p>
<p>men reached Fort Pitt June 26th, in a distressed condition.
</p>
<p>SCENES OF TERROK AT THE WEST. 65
</p>
<p>Bejond Fort Pitt, on tlie old Braddock trail to Cumberland
</p>
<p>were Forts Ligonier, Bedford and Cumberland, and Fort Au-
</p>
<p>gusta on the Susquehanna. All these posts were beset, but the
</p>
<p>savages were not in force enough to carry them. They seem
</p>
<p>only to have been after scalps and obtained many. Around
</p>
<p>most of these stations were settlements and farms. The Sene-
</p>
<p>cas and Delawares haunted the woods like hyenas, and carried
</p>
<p>terror along the whole frontier. These Indians united with
</p>
<p>the Shawnees, and for several weeks beset Fort Pitt, then com-
</p>
<p>manded by Captain Ecuyer. Being in a position to hold his
</p>
<p>own against the assailants he answered their formal demands
</p>
<p>for a surrender, made July 26th (1768), by defiance and sar-
</p>
<p>casm. That night they invested the fortification, which stood
</p>
<p>facing the two rivei-s Alleghany and Monongahela, in whose
</p>
<p>forks it was built. Creeping up the banks of these two streams
</p>
<p>the savages dug burrows in the soft soil, and from their cover
</p>
<p>poured a severe fire into the fort above them. For several
</p>
<p>days this warfare continued, but was finally abandoned  the
</p>
<p>approach of Bouquet with his Highlanders, from the East,
</p>
<p>sending the savages in some haste to the wilderness.
</p>
<p>We cannot here enter upon an account of the desolating war
</p>
<p>of the border which raged along the entire frontier, from the
</p>
<p>vales of Western Virginia to the Mohawk valley. Its story
</p>
<p>forms one of the most distressing chapters in our early history.
</p>
<p>Families which retu-ed to rest in fancied security were awak-
</p>
<p>ened from their repose by the appalling war-whoop ; fathers
</p>
<p>and brothers were slain in brave efibrts to defend their loved
</p>
<p>ones ; mothers shrieked for mercy in vain, or, after witnessing
</p>
<p>the braining of their little ones, were borne off mto a captivity
</p>
<p>worse than death. Farms were desolated, buildings burned,
</p>
<p>stock slaughtered. The ciy of wo and sufifering went up from
</p>
<p>a thousand broken family circles. Men took to the war-path
</p>
<p>in defense, while their women and children were sent away to
</p>
<p>the east of the Susquehanna for safety. Then followed the

<p>subtle, relentless war of extermination. Settlers, mad with
</p>
<p>their losses, became as implacable as savages and neither asked
</p>
<p>nor gave quarter. The forests were haunted with pursuers
</p>
<p>and pursued, who flitted like evil spiiits every where  seeking

</p>
<p>the darkest coverts for their enemies, and mingling in the
</p>
<p>hand to hand contest away off in labyrinths where the foot of
</p>
<p>the white man never before had trodden. The whoop of defi-
</p>
<p>ance, the shout of hate, the sharp crack of the rifle, the shriek
</p>
<p>of agony, were rapid episodes in the terrible drama. Then
</p>
<p>came the death struggle. If the dull sound of the tomahawk
</p>
<p>cleaving the skull was heard, and was followed by the dismal
</p>
<p>scalp-yell, it was a sign that the whites were overcome : if the
</p>
<p>rush of feet and the shouts of pursuit echoed through the
</p>
<p>woody fastnesses it was the good portent of victory to the
</p>
<p>settlers.
</p>
<p>All through the summer and fall of 1763  through the
</p>
<p>months of 1764  this infernal warfare was waged ; and not
</p>
<p>until after the successes of Bouquet and Bradstreet's expedi-
</p>
<p>tions against the Indian towns was quiet restored to the settle-
</p>
<p>ments on the eastern slope of the Alleghanies and in the Sus-
</p>
<p>quehanna vallies. It was not, indeed, until the year 1769
</p>
<p>that the spirit of conspiracy was subdued and fears of a general
</p>
<p>massacre by the Indians allayed. Then followed a few years
</p>
<p>of repose, in which the settlements prospered, and the daring
</p>
<p>fr intiersmen encroached rapidly upon the Indians' domain,
</p>
<p>ojily to be stayed by the storm of the War for Independence.
</p>
<p>Tliat, for the while, arrested all progress, and placed the entire
</p>
<p>frontier again on the defense against the savages incited, by
</p>
<p>British gold and British promises, to the work of butchery.
</p>
<p>Let us return from this inevitable digression again to Ponti-
</p>
<p>ac's own immediate operations against Detroit. Upon his suc-
</p>
<p>cess there seemed to hang the fate of his entire scheme. At
</p>
<p>least the pertinacity with which the siege was pressed would
</p>
<p>so seem to argue ; and yet, when the Chief found that France
</p>
<p>would not embark in the war, what hope could he have had
</p>
<p>of any ultimate success ? He evidently fought for the glory
</p>
<p>of leadership and from hate  not from the expectation of see-
</p>
<p>ing his people restored to their hunting grounds and the whites

<p>Pottawatamies  which were camping around Detroit, was rap-
</p>
<p>idly augmented in June by warriors from other villages and
</p>
<p>tribes. His strength, however, was not formidable, at any
</p>
<p>time, had the garrisons not all been so weak. A force of one
</p>
<p>thousand trusty troops would have annihilated the horde of
</p>
<p>assassins which infested the neighborhood of Detroit, and that
</p>
<p>done, the same troops could have passed into Ohio, to punish
</p>
<p>the tribes there into obedience. The uprising was so well
</p>
<p>matured, the forts all were so rapidly assaulted, that no oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity for reenforcements offered. The garrisons were destroy-
</p>
<p>ed ere help could have reached them. Then the conspiracy
</p>
<p>assumed such formidable dimensions as to render a general
</p>
<p>commonwealth organization of militia necessary, and several
</p>
<p>years passed away ere the punishment was inflicted which
</p>
<p>crushed out the fires lit by Pontiac's baleful influence.
</p>
<p>About the middle of May (1763), the spring supply of pro-
</p>
<p>visions and ammunition was dispatched, in twenty small boats
</p>
<p>under command of Lieutenant Cuyler, from Fort Schlosser
</p>
<p>(just above Niagara Falls) to Detroit. No knowledge then
</p>
<p>was had of the hostility prevailing, and the boats' crews coast-
</p>
<p>ed up along the northern shore of Lake Erie in fancied securi-
</p>
<p>ty. Arriving at Point au Pelee island, May 28th, the boats all
</p>
<p>landed and the men proceeded to prepare fires. In a few mo-
</p>
<p>ments an ambuscade of Wyandots  doubtless the identical
</p>
<p>band who had destroyed Sandusky twelve days before  open-
</p>
<p>ed on the troops, who at once formed as a cover to their boats ;
</p>
<p>but, the savages becoming restless for their prey, and being in
</p>
<p>overwhelming force, broke from cover and dashed upon the
</p>
<p>lines. The English stood but a moment. The uplifted toma-
</p>
<p>hawks, the hellish whoop, the bodies painted into hideousness
</p>
<p>sufficed to fill the hearts of the regulars with a sudden panic
</p>
<p>Muskets were thrown away and a dash made for the boats,
</p>
<p>five of which were put afloat, filled to overflowing with the

</p>
<p>fear-stricken crowd. The savages seized two other boats and
</p>
<p>pursued, when three of the five little craft capitulated without
</p>
<p>defense. Two of the boats  one of which contained Lieuten-
</p>
<p>ant Cuyler  pulled for the adjacent islands (now called Put-in
</p>
<p>68 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>Bay islands) and from thence to the fort at Sandusky, on San-
</p>
<p>dusky Bay. The fort, as already recorded, having been de-
</p>
<p>stroyed by the Wyandots, offered the fleeing men no refuge.
</p>
<p>Cuyler then started on his return to Niagara, following the
</p>
<p>southern shore of the Lake. He reached Presqu' Isle in safe-
</p>
<p>ty and soon passed on to Niagara  to report the fall of San-
</p>
<p>dusky and his own losses.
</p>
<p>It is sickening to contemplate the horrible end of the men
</p>
<p>seized in the three boats. After their capture the savages,
</p>
<p>with the entire flotilla of boats started for Detroit. On the
</p>
<p>morning of May 80th, a sentinel discovered the heavily la-
</p>
<p>dened convoys rounding Montreal point. A great shout went
</p>
<p>up from the beleaguered garrison and a crowd of soldiers,
</p>
<p>habiians and traders at once rushed to the landing to welcome
</p>
<p>the relief It was a moment of the wildest joy; but cheers
</p>
<p>and the booming of cannon were quickly succeeded by the
</p>
<p>most heart-rending depression. The answer to those notes of
</p>
<p>welcome was the appalling war-whoop, which came faintly over
</p>
<p>the water, while in every boat appeared a band of naked sav-
</p>
<p>ages gesticulating and yelling like demons. The truth at once
</p>
<p>was evident to all, and the disheartened group on the landing
</p>
<p>returned, sickened, to the fort. Soon they were all excitement
</p>
<p>again. The boats gradually made their way up stream, pulled
</p>
<p>by the white men, over whom the savages held guard. When
</p>
<p>opposite the fort and the remaining vessel  one of the two
</p>
<p>vessels having then gone to Niagara to hasten up supplies 
</p>
<p>the crew in the first and leading small boat conceived the da-
</p>
<p>ring design of escape. The brave fellow acting as steersman
</p>
<p>grappled a stalwart Indian and flung him overboard, but the
</p>
<p>supple savage clung to the Englishman's garments and suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded in pulling him into the deep river. They closed in the
</p>
<p>water, in a deadly struggle the Wyandot using his knife with
</p>
<p>such fatal aim as soon sent his foe to the bottom. While this
</p>
<p>was transpiring the two remaining Indians leaped overboard,

</p>
<p>when the prisoners pulled for life toward the fort and vessel.
</p>
<p>The savages, with a loud cry of fury, struck out in pursuit ;
</p>
<p>while the guard in all the boats, and the horde of Indiang fol-
</p>
<p>lowing along the eastern bank of the river, opened fire on the
</p>

<p>boat, wounding one of the three poor fellows in it. The chase
</p>
<p>became exciting in the extrem, Kifle balls cut the water all
</p>
<p>around into flecks of foam. Every moment the light canoes
</p>
<p>which had put out after the fugitives gained rapidly on the
</p>
<p>clumsy yawl. The fate of the soldiers seemed sealed, when,
</p>
<p>suddenly, the vessel opened on the pursuit with her six-pound-
</p>
<p>ers, and the three brave men were saved. The first ball cut
</p>
<p>the water close to the foremost canoe. Other shot which
</p>
<p>quickly followed caused the entire disappearance of the sava-
</p>
<p>ges, who ever entertained a kind of supernatural dread of the
</p>
<p>" big bullets." The entire boats' crews were landed and the
</p>
<p>boats beached, while the wretched prisoners were marched
</p>
<p>around to the Ottawa camp above, to enter at once upon their
</p>
<p>tortures. Their corpses, blackened with fire and wounds, were
</p>
<p>cast into the river to float by the fortress and the vessels and
</p>
<p>thus warn the Englishmen of the fate reserved for all prisoners.
</p>
<p>A number of Canadians came, in terror to the fort, during the
</p>
<p>evening of that day (May 30th) to report such details of the
</p>
<p>sufferings of the prisoners as served to sicken and appal every
</p>
<p>listener. The Pontiac Ms. gives the following version of this
</p>
<p>awful affair :
</p>
<p>" The Indians, fearing that the other barges might escape as the iirst
</p>
<p>had done, changed their plan of going to the camp. They landed their
</p>
<p>prisoners, tied them, and conducted them by land to the Ottawa village,
</p>
<p>and then crossed them to Pontiac's camj), where they were all butch-
</p>
<p>ered. As soon as the canoes reached the shore, the barbarians landed
</p>
<p>their prisoners, one after the other, on the beach. They made them
</p>
<p>strip themselves, and then sent arrow^s into different parts of their bodies.
</p>
<p>These unfortunate men wished sometimes to throw themselves on the
</p>
<p>ground to avoid the arrows ; but they were beaten with sticks and
</p>
<p>forced to stand up until they were dead ; after which those who had not
</p>
<p>fired fell upon their bodies, cut them to pieces, cooked and ate them.
</p>
<p>On others they exercised different modes of torment by cutting their
</p>
<p>flesh with flints, and piercing them with lances. They would then cut

</p>
<p>their feet and hands off, and leave them weltering in their blood till
</p>
<p>they were dead. Others were fastened to stakes, and children employed
</p>
<p>in burning them with a slow fire. No kind of torment was left untried
</p>
<p>by these Indians. Some of the bodies were left on shore ; others were
</p>
<p>thrown into the river. Even the women assisted their husbands in tor-
</p>
<p>turing their victims. They slitted them with theii- knives, and mangled

</p>
<p>them in various ways. There were, however, a few whose lives were
</p>
<p>saved, being adopted to serve as slaves."
</p>
<p>Such was the mercy meted out to helpless men by the
</p>
<p>" magnanimous savage"  as Pontiac's biographers have been
</p>
<p>pleased to term this monster of perfidy and cruelty.
</p>
<p>It was but a few days after this that a procession of savages
</p>
<p>appeared on the eastern bank of the river bearing on poles the
</p>
<p>scalps of the Sandusky garrison. And from that time onward,
</p>
<p>until the fate of all the posts had been determined, Gladwyn
</p>
<p>was, at intervals, first m^de acquainted with new disasters by
</p>
<p>the sight of scalps or of prisoners exhibited on the Canada side
</p>
<p>of the stream. Thus the dreary monotony of the siege was
</p>
<p>stirred, though painfully, by episodes which served to redouble
</p>
<p>the vigilance of the beleagured men. What a fate was in reserve
</p>
<p>for them if Pontiac once became possessed of their defense !
</p>
<p>All excitement was not, however, of a painful character.
</p>
<p>One of the two schooners anchored oif the fort at the opening
</p>
<p>of the siege had been dispatched to Niagara for reenforcements
</p>
<p>and stores. The vessel missed Cuyler's convoy and passed
</p>
<p>down to Fort Schlosser, where she still remained at the date
</p>
<p>of Cuyler's return with his two boats' crews. She was then
</p>
<p>put in good trim and dispatched to Gladwyn's relief  Cuyler
</p>
<p>and his remaining men embarking in her. June 19th she had
</p>
<p>reached Detroit river and lay off" Turkey island to await a fa-
</p>
<p>vorable breeze with which to run the gauntlet that Cuyler
</p>
<p>knew was in store for them at the narrow channel along
</p>
<p>Fighting island. The vessel lay calm-bound below the island
</p>
<p>until June 23d, when a favorable breeze induced the com-
</p>
<p>mander to weigh anchor and to try the passage. The trip
</p>
<p>promised success, when, at the most critical moment, all wind
</p>
<p>died away leaving the little craft again becalmed. Anchor
</p>
<p>was cast in the narrowest part of the channel, as it would not
</p>
<p>do to drift down with the current for fear of grounding. All
</p>
<p>things were made ready for an attack. The banks swarmed

<p>with Indians, too eager for their prey to keep concealed. Over
</p>
<p>five hundred of the villains were on the bloody scent. Cuy-
</p>
<p>ler had learned caution, however, and so disposed his force as
</p>
<p>to be ready for any emergency. Night dropped down over
</p>

</p>
<p>all, not densely dark, for the stars gleamed out purely and tlie
</p>
<p>clear waters of the river reflected their light like a mirror.
</p>
<p>The sentinels were as sleepless as the stars, noting every sha-
</p>
<p>dow on the surface of the stream. Every log which floated
</p>
<p>lazily down the tide might shield the body of a savage whose
</p>
<p>eye- balls just peered above the water's surface to reconnoitre
</p>
<p>the point of attack. Every clump of grass, every nest of water
</p>
<p>reeds were felt to contain a living man ready to burst from
</p>
<p>cover at any moment when the rush should be ordered.
</p>
<p>Just after midnight the forms of canoes were descried com-
</p>
<p>ing rapidly down stream. Their design evidently was to
</p>
<p>board the vessel so quickly as to give no opportunity for the
</p>
<p>use of the cannon. But, they were not successful. They came
</p>
<p>rushing down to find every man at his post. Swarms of sav-
</p>
<p>ages sprang into the stream from each shore, making direct
</p>
<p>for the schooner. Cuyler waited calmly until the canoes and
</p>
<p>swimmers were within close musket range, when the signal
</p>
<p>was given and a fire opened with grape and musketry which
</p>
<p>crashed fearfully through the canoes and sent death over the
</p>
<p>waters. Fourteen savages were killed and large numbers
</p>
<p>wounded ere they could get beyond range. They fled howling
</p>
<p>to the shores and opened fire from a sand breastwork on the
</p>
<p>vessel. Cuyler dropped down stream a little distance, and
</p>
<p>was safe.
</p>
<p>A second attempt to ascend, made two days later, was suc-
</p>
<p>cessful. She ran the gauntlet of a severe shore fire and gain-
</p>
<p>ed the broad stream above Fighting island, to press on, with a
</p>
<p>good breeze to the fort. Passing the Wyandot village a mur-
</p>
<p>derous discharge of grape into the wigwams was the welcome
</p>
<p>which the vessel brought for the conspirators. To the garri-
</p>
<p>son she brought gladness in many shapes. Not the least joy-
</p>
<p>ful intelligence was the conclusion, between England and
</p>
<p>France, of the Paris Treaty, by which the latter abandoned all
</p>
<p>claim to her old territory. This, it was thought, would compel

<p>the savages to give over all further hope of French aid and
</p>
<p>thus compel them to abandon their chimerical project of extir-
</p>
<p>pating the English. But, there is every reason to think that

<p>aid, althoiigli lie studiously held out the idea of a great French
</p>
<p>army coming up the St. Lawrence in order to commit all the
</p>
<p>tribes under his influence to the war path.
</p>
<p>Eeceiving help from no white source except from the half-
</p>
<p>breeds ' and a few Canadians, Pontiac resolved at length to
</p>
<p>compel the French inhabitants along the river to take sides
</p>
<p>either for or against him  knowing that they would not do
</p>
<p>the latter for fear of consequences to their property and fami-
</p>
<p>lies. The Chief had but to give the command and involve all
</p>
<p>the hahitans in one common massacre. A council was con-
</p>
<p>vened late in June, to which the leading French residents
</p>
<p>were summoned. It was largely attended by chiefs of the
</p>
<p>several tribes and by the Canadians. Pontiac's speech was
</p>
<p>somewhat violent. He said: "You claim to befriends and
</p>
<p>yet relieve and sustain the English by presents of provisions.
</p>
<p>You go through our camps and villages then report all to the
</p>
<p>English. You must be English or French. If you are French
</p>
<p>take up the war-belt and assist us : if you are English we shall
</p>
<p>declare war against you." To this an old Canadian rejilied by
</p>
<p>dissimulation. He confessed their willingness to aid the sav-
</p>
<p>ages but held in his hand a copy of the treaty of Paris, by
</p>
<p>which they were bound not to war. He asked Pontiac, there-
</p>
<p>fore, to say what they could do. The Chief was unable to
</p>
<p>answer; but his heart was gladdened by a number of " hard
</p>
<p>cases"  a set of whites whose long association with the Indians,
</p>
<p>as well as their brutal instincts, made them savages. How
</p>
<p>many of these rascals volunteered it is not stated. The coun-
</p>
<p>cil terminated satisfactorily : a great dog- feast followed, and
</p>
<p>the French ruffians were formally received into the tribes as
</p>
<p>members.
</p>
<p>* Half breeds became a quick growth in every tribe brought into contact with
</p>
<p>" civilization." As in the Slave States the great multitude of mulattos is proof
</p>
<p>positive not only of the waut of virtue among the negroes, but also of the gross
</p>
<p>sensuality of their white mastero, so the presence in every tribe of Indians of great

<p>numbers of half breeds is evidence of the general absence of female virtue among
</p>
<p>the aborigines. The longer the contact with civilization the greater the demoral-
</p>
<p>ization which has followed. There are but few exceptions to this rule. Unpal-
</p>
<p>atable as the statement may be, our philanthropists and political economists will
</p>
<p>have to accept results even though they contravene theories and hopes of progress.

<p>THE MURDEE OF MAJOR CAMPBELL. 73
</p>
<p>Night saw the renegades on the war-path. Proceeding
</p>
<p>to the fort, with a party composed of an equal number of Ojib-
</p>
<p>was, they threw up an entrenchment, under cover of the
</p>
<p>darkness, and early dawn found them in a position to worry
</p>
<p>the garrison. A squad of soldiers sallied from the fort at once
</p>
<p>and dislodged them  the white Indians running away at the
</p>
<p>first appearance of the troops. The Oj ibways held their ground
</p>
<p>for a moment and then fled, leaving two of their number dead
</p>
<p>on the field. One of these, a soldier  who had been for seven
</p>
<p>years a captive among the Delawares, and who hated the race
</p>
<p>of red men with an intense hate  scalped, holding up the
</p>
<p>bleeding lock to the sight of the escaping savages. This act
</p>
<p>inspired the Ojibwas with unutterable rage. The red skin
</p>
<p>scalped was a nephew of Wasson, Chief of the Ojibwas. Was-
</p>
<p>son at once blackened his face in token of revenge, proceeded
</p>
<p>with a party of braves to the house of M. Meloche where the
</p>
<p>venerable Major Campbell still was confined, seized and mur-
</p>
<p>dered him on the spot, cut out his heart and ate it, then gave
</p>
<p>his body to the water, from which it was recovered by the
</p>
<p>Canadians and decently interred. This brutal murder so en-
</p>
<p>raged Pontiac that Wasson and his party were compelled to
</p>
<p>flee to Saginaw for their lives. For the veteran Major the
</p>
<p>Ottawa Chief entertained a real respect, and the Conspirator
</p>
<p>doubtless held him in captivity to subserve his purposes in
</p>
<p>procuring terms of settlement, should the war prove disastrous
</p>
<p>to the Indian cause.
</p>
<p>Affairs did not prosper under Pontiac's own immediate
</p>
<p>charge. The fort had not fallen and, after the arrival of the
</p>
<p>transport, more than ever defied his assaults. The two schoon-
</p>
<p>ers so annoyed his villages by frequent bombardments early
</p>
<p>in July as to compel the savages, to their great discomfort, to
</p>
<p>move back into the woods. The smaller vessel having return-
</p>
<p>ed, a second time to Niagara, Pontiac determined to destroy
</p>
<p>the larger schooner. If her destruction could be effected the

</p>
<p>Chief had hopes of carrjdng the fort by assault A fire-raft
</p>
<p>was constructed, composed of two floats loaded with combusti-
</p>
<p>bles. On the night of July 10th, it was fired and sent down
</p>
<p>stream. The vessel lay too close to shore for injury from the

<p>10
</p>
<p>74 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>fire messenger; it passed down the stream harmlessly Not
</p>
<p>discouraged, the savage constructed a second and much larger
</p>
<p>raft, which was sent down on the night of July 12th. It was,
</p>
<p>evidently, directed by pilots, for it struck the shore current
</p>
<p>and followed closely down ; only a steersman could have kept
</p>
<p>it from drifting out into the middle of the stream. The flame,
</p>
<p>too, was suppressed apparently until the moment when the pi-
</p>
<p>lots left the float ; then the conflagration became quickly in-
</p>
<p>tense. The spectacle presented was one of sublimity. A
</p>
<p>vast tongue of flame leaped upward, circling around as if eager
</p>
<p>to catch the victim in its fiery folds. Against the background
</p>
<p>of the night it looked like an avenging demon out on its mis-
</p>
<p>sion of devastation. Every farm house stood out in relief by
</p>
<p>its flame ; every man on the fortress, every savage lurking on
</p>
<p>the shore, every canoe on the stream, were pictured in clear
</p>
<p>distinctness by that lurid glare, which penetrated far into the
</p>
<p>fastnesses of the woods around. Every heart in the fort throb-
</p>
<p>bed wildly at the spectacle ; each man stood in awe before that
</p>
<p>contrivance of devils to sweep away their chief defense and
</p>
<p>hope. But, the fear was only momentary. The artful pilots
</p>
<p>had over-done their work, for the raft passed in between the
</p>
<p>fort and the vessel, and floated grandly yet harmlessl}- away
</p>
<p>into the darkness below. As it slowly swept by a cannon
</p>
<p>boomed out on the night. A group of savages stood revealed
</p>
<p>on the river bank, watching the raft. The gunner trailed his
</p>
<p>piece on their dusky forms and a ball went hurtling into their
</p>
<p>midst. They vanished like spectres.
</p>
<p>A third raft was then constructed, but Gladwyn took the
</p>
<p>precaution to anchor booms in the stream above the vessel thus
</p>
<p>completely outwitting the red rogues who, doubtless, acted in
</p>
<p>this matter under the advice, and with the assistance of their
</p>
<p>white coadjutors, before referred to.

<p>solved to withdraw. The "Wyandots first made proposals of
</p>
<p>peace and a truce was declared with them. They kept their
</p>
<p>word just three weeks. The Pottawatamies soon followed their
</p>
<p>example, and, after some trouble on account of the non-deliv*
</p>
<p>ery of white prisoners held by their tribe, Gladwyn signified
</p>
<p>his amity with them. This apparently left the Ottowas
</p>
<p>and the fierce Ojibwas alone in the field. With the detach-
</p>
<p>ments of Shawnese and Delawares, and the French renegades,
</p>
<p>Pontiac still controlled a formidable force. The Wyandots
</p>
<p>and Pottawatamies were ready for the war-path at any moment
</p>
<p>which seemed propitious for scalps. Their treaties were the
</p>
<p>merest mockery.
</p>
<p>Eeenforcements at length reached the beleaguered garrison.
</p>
<p>Having received news of Cuyler's disaster, Sir Jefl'rey Amherst
</p>
<p> then at New York on his return to England  dispatched
</p>
<p>his aid-de-camp. Captain Dalzell, to Niagara, with ordei-s to
</p>
<p>gather all the forces it would be safe to detach from the lower
</p>
<p>forts and with them to proceed to Gladwyn's relief Dalzell,
</p>
<p>a brave but impetuous ofiicer, who had shared with Israel
</p>
<p>Putnam in many of his adventures, accepted the service with
</p>
<p>pleasure. Early in July he was en route up the Lake, with
</p>
<p>two hundred and eighty men and twenty-two barges, A land-
</p>
<p>ing was made at the desolated posts of Presqu' Isle and San-
</p>
<p>dusky. From the latter he marched (July 26th) with a section
</p>
<p>of his force, upon the Wyandot town, a few miles to the south.
</p>
<p>This he destroyed, together- with its cornfields and its orchards.
</p>
<p>The expedition then hurried on to the Detroit river. Un-
</p>
<p>der cover of a fog  rare, indeed, on that stream so late in the
</p>
<p>season  the flotilla passed up in safety during the night of
</p>
<p>July 28th and the morning of the 29th. The vicinity of the
</p>
<p>Wyandot and Pottawatamie villages was reached ere the con-
</p>
<p>voy was discovered, when these savages at once forgot their
</p>
<p>late treaty, and a heavy attack was made. Fifteen of the
</p>
<p>troops were killed and wounded. Dalzell replied with mus-

<p>from their coverts on the shore. The barge-, then pulled for

</p>
<p>tions. The men were not made more welcome than the rich
</p>
<p>supply of stores and ammunition which thej convoyed.
</p>
<p>Dalzell, upon the day of his arrival, concerted an attack on
</p>
<p>the Ottawa village. Gladwyn discouraged the enterprise, con-
</p>
<p>ceiving it, doubtless, as rash and perilous to court disaster.
</p>
<p>Dalzell's importunity, however, bore down opposition and it
</p>
<p>became known throughout the garrison that an attack was to
</p>
<p>be made. This imprudent revelation was fatal to success.
</p>
<p>Two hours after it was known in the fort Pontiac was in pos-
</p>
<p>session of the plan, and, without delay, arranged to ambuscade
</p>
<p>the English.
</p>
<p>The march to the Ottawa camp was along the river road to
</p>
<p>the creek, one mile and a half above the fort. Near the creek
</p>
<p>crossing was the house of Meloche. The Ottawa village had
</p>
<p>been located just bej^ond the bridge, on the ridges ; but, scourg-
</p>
<p>ed by the vessels' fire, it was removed up the creek, tlii'ee miles
</p>
<p>away. Dalzell's plan was to march by night upon the village
</p>
<p>and surprise the savages : Pontiac's plan was to ambuscade
</p>
<p>the English at the bridge and surprise them with defeat. The
</p>
<p>English left the fort, at two o'clock on the morning of July
</p>
<p>81st, two hundred and fifty strong. Two barges followed by
</p>
<p>the river, to co-operate with their swivels. The men pressed
</p>
<p>on to the creek. Over the little bridge the advance guard of
</p>
<p>twenty -five was passing when, from their front burst the war-
</p>
<p>whoop of two hundred savages, lurking in the darkness behind
</p>
<p>trees, fences, woodpiles, houses and stumps. The yells were
</p>
<p>followed by a discharge of rifles which brought down half the
</p>
<p>advance. It staggered before the unexpected blow and receded
</p>
<p>upon the centre. Dalzell rushed to the front, rallied the line
</p>
<p>and led the men in person over the bridge. Again the appall-
</p>
<p>ing whoop, followed by a volley which brought the troops to
</p>
<p>a stand. But they quickly recovered, and, led by Dalzell and
</p>
<p>' Captain GTray, the centre of the detachment charged upon the
</p>
<p>ridges over the stream, on which the Indians had taken

<p>post. But the alert warriors glided away into the darkness ;
</p>
<p>the troops charged in vain against woodpiles and fences ; not
</p>
<p>a savage could be discovered until the sharp crack of a rifle,

<p>from some near cover, betrayed the momentary presence of an

</p>
<p>Indian. Tliis warfare witli an invisible foe so disconcerted
</p>
<p>tlie men tliat Dalzell wisely resolved to withdraw to the south
</p>
<p>side of the creek, there to await day-light before pressing his
</p>
<p>advance. The retreat was made in good order, under a heavy
</p>
<p>and galling fire. Watchful as lynxes the Ottawa warriors kei3t
</p>
<p>close to their game, and, had the night been more favorable to
</p>
<p>true aim not a man of all that command would have been left
</p>
<p>alive by daybreak. The two barges, drawn up to the bridge,
</p>
<p>received the wounded and dead. Captain Grant in command
</p>
<p>of the rear detachment soon found that the assailants had
</p>
<p>crossed the creek, for they were upon his flank and rear al-
</p>
<p>most as soon as the troops began to retire from the ridge.
</p>
<p>Having the cover of Meloche's house, orchard, fences and out-
</p>
<p>buildings, the assault was opened from them so sharply that
</p>
<p>Grant ordered his men to charge. As in every instance the
</p>
<p>bayonet found no enemy to pinion : the Indians glided away
</p>
<p>with the silence and rapidity of reptiles. In Meloche's house
</p>
<p>two Canadians were found who informed Grant of Pontiac's
</p>
<p>design of getting in between the English and the fort  thus to
</p>
<p>cut off all escape. The news was communicated to Dalzell,
</p>
<p>and quick steps taken to guard the road so as to keep up the
</p>
<p>line of retreat. The entire command soon began the retrograde
</p>
<p>movement  Grant on the lead and Dalzell covering the rear.
</p>
<p>The savages were now reenforced by bodies of "Wyandots and
</p>
<p>Pottawatamies. These, with a body of Ottawas, Pontiac post-
</p>
<p>ed at a point where the attack would find the Englij^h com-
</p>
<p>pacted and less able to move in body, Arrived at this posi-
</p>
<p>tion the Indians attacked with great fury, throwing the regulars
</p>
<p>into a panic which well nigh proved fatal. Only Dalzell's
</p>
<p>great courage and power of command saved his men from
</p>
<p>butchery. The savages had grasped their tomahawks prepa-
</p>
<p>ratory to a hand to hand struggle, when the column reformed
</p>
<p>again and was pushed forward in good order. Major Eogers,
</p>
<p>with his band of rangers, was ubiquitous. These men, skilled

<p>in Indian warfare, fought the red-men successfully. They
</p>
<p>lurked behind trees and fences, stole along through the grass,
</p>
<p>bounded around barns and houses sending then- knives into
</p>
<p>many a savage breast

<p>80 THE CONSPIEACT OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>This fierce struggle contimied the entire distance to within
</p>
<p>range of the palisade guns. Captain Gray fell mortally wound-
</p>
<p>ed in a charge upon a fence; Dalzell was killed, and his reek-
</p>
<p>ing scalp torn from his head in sight of his men. Eogers
</p>
<p>finally flung his force into a house which commanded the road
</p>
<p>and thus effectually covered the retreat, after Dalzell's fall.
</p>
<p>Grant had also obtained a good position in an orchard, where
</p>
<p>he kept the savages at bay while the main body passed down
</p>
<p>the road. Here he was joined by Rogers and, together, these
</p>
<p>intrepid leaders so manoeuvred from house to house as to hold
</p>
<p>the fortunes of the retreat safely. It was eight o'clock ere the
</p>
<p>last of that ill-fated expedition reentered the gates. '
</p>
<p>The returns gave the losses as nineteen killed and forty-two
</p>
<p>wounded  a small number considering the nature of the con-
</p>
<p>test. It would have been much greater had the darkness and
</p>
<p>the fog been less dense. Much was due, also, to the splendid
</p>
<p>manoeuvering of Grant and Rogers, after day-light had come.
</p>
<p>The loss of the Indians could not have been great.
</p>
<p>The result of this combat  called by historians the " battle
</p>
<p>of Bloody Run"  was to reinspire the Indians in their causa
</p>
<p>They soon spread the news of their victory  magnified of
</p>
<p>course in its report of numbers  far and wide, receiving in re-
</p>
<p>turn accessions from various tribes, until fully one thousand
</p>
<p>warriors invested Detroit. Yet, no assault was attempted.
</p>
<p>With the force then in the fort  fully three hundred strong 
</p>
<p>Gladwyn was in a position to defy his assailants ; he had, ap-
</p>
<p>parently, only to await the passage of time to free him of his
</p>
<p>troublesome enemies.
</p>
<p>* The account given by Drake in his work  " The Biography and History of the
</p>
<p>Indians of North America"  is singularly at variance with the version here adopt-
</p>
<p>ed, though that author so far corrects the " popular version" as to publish Major
</p>
<p>Gladwyn's report of the " Battle of Detroit." That report varies in immaterial
</p>
<p>particulars from that given by Parkman, and which we have preferred to follow.
</p>
<p>The latter author recites many interesting incidents of the affair gathered from the

</p>
<p>personal data, to which Mr. Parkman had access. The production of Parkman's
</p>
<p>work doubtless prevented General Cass from fulfilling his first design, though he

<p>had contributed several valuable papers to the Michigan Historical Society bear-

<p>ATTACK ON" THE VESSEL. 81
</p>
<p>After the fight of Bloody Eun nothing save occasional sharp,
</p>
<p>shooting occurred to break the monotony of the siege until
</p>
<p>September 5th, when the second arrival of the little schooner,
</p>
<p>dispatched to Niagara in July, gave the garrison fresh food for
</p>
<p>excitement, inasmuch as, during the previous night, she had
</p>
<p>been boarded by over three hundred savages, and yet had es-
</p>
<p>caped. The story of that adventure was as follows :
</p>
<p>The vessel, having a crew of eleven men  with six Mohawk
</p>
<p>Indians, sent by Amherst as spies and scouts  entered Detroit
</p>
<p>river on the 3d of September (1763). The succeeding morning
</p>
<p>the Mohawks were permitted to go ashore to scout. They
</p>
<p>never returned, but made their way direct to the villages above
</p>
<p>to give the alarm. The Captain felt keenly his danger, but
</p>
<p>contrary winds kept him from going up the stream. That
</p>
<p>night, about nine o'clock, a great number of canoes were seen
</p>
<p>rushing down upon him, and, almost before the bow gun could
</p>
<p>be I discharged, the horde of savages was swarming over the
</p>
<p>bulwarks. Delivering one volley of musketry the crew threw
</p>
<p>d( iwn their guns and rushed upon the boarders with pike and
</p>
<p>ci.-tlass. A furious hand-to-hand contest followed, in which it
</p>
<p>w as soon apparent that the whites must be overpowered. The
</p>
<p>Captain being killed, the first mate  a very resolute fellow na-
</p>
<p>D'.ed Jacobs  held command. Seeing the savages about to
</p>
<p>accomplish their design, he ordered one of his men to fire the
</p>
<p>i.iagazine and blow up the vessel. The order was understood
</p>
<p>by a "civilized" Wyandot, who repeated it in horror, and, vrith
</p>
<p>a loud yell, leaped overboard. In a twinkling the entire mass
</p>
<p>of red-skinned humanity was gone. Warriors decked in gay
</p>
<p>attire and bedaubed in artistic grease, soot and vermillion,
</p>
<p>dashed overboard like frogs, and, for a few moments were seen
</p>
<p>fluttering and ducking in the river in the most grotesque haste
</p>
<p>to avoid the expected explosion. They soon disappeared en-
</p>
<p>tirely ; in less than ten minutes from the first gun, all was si-
</p>
<p>lent again. The crew's loss was two killed and four badly

<p>wounded. Eight savages were killed on the decks and nbout
</p>
<p>twenty wounded  of whom eight were reported soon to have
</p>
<p>died. The vessel passed on up the river the succeeding morn-
</p>
<p>ing (Sept 5th), reaching the fort in safety. For their bravery

</p>
<p>the crew was rewarded with silver medals struck by order of
</p>
<p>the commander-in-chief, commemorating the event.'
</p>
<p>This second addition to the garrison's supplies quite dis-
</p>
<p>heartened the beleaguering host. Winter was approaching
</p>
<p>and their own necessities soon must drive them to the woods
</p>
<p>if they would save their families from staiTation. Their am-
</p>
<p>munition also was fast running low, threatening to leave them
</p>
<p>powerless to secure their winter's food. Then came the news
</p>
<p>of a heavy reenforcement en route for Detroit, sufiicient to car-
</p>
<p>ry the war into their villages. It was time for them to make
</p>
<p>peace, if only to gain time to recruit their energies for another
</p>
<p>year's work of slaughter. After conferences among the con-
</p>
<p>fedi'ates a chief of the Missisaugas  a branch of the great Ojib
</p>
<p>wa family  appeared at the fort October 12th. In a talk wi th
</p>
<p>Gladwyn he professed to represent the Ojibwas, Wyandcts
</p>
<p>and Pottawatamies, who were sincerely sorry for their bid
</p>
<p>conduct and had sent him to beg forgiveness and peace. To
</p>
<p>this Gladwyn replied by granting a truce  a peace could oi? ly
</p>
<p>be secured through Sir William Johnson, His Majestj^'s Con-
</p>
<p>missioner of Indian Affairs. The policy of this truce will be
</p>
<p>apparent when it is stated that Gladwyn's stores were ev^n
</p>
<p>then at a starvation point  his men all being upon short al-
</p>
<p>lowance; and, should the promised reenforcement under Major
</p>
<p>Wilkins fail, by any mishap, to reach him, he would be com-
</p>
<p>pelled to evacuate the post. A truce opened communication^
</p>
<p>for a few days at least, with the habitans around ; and Gladwyn
</p>
<p>used it so well that, ere a week had passed, the fort was sup-
</p>
<p>plied with meat, corn and potatoes enough for a winter's siege.
</p>
<p>The Ottawas held aloof from this arrangement, although
</p>
<p>they did not, so far as we can learn, show hostility to their
</p>
<p>allies. Pontiac doubtless consented to it as the only means of
</p>
<p>1 The account given by Sir Jeffrey Amherst, of this gallant affair, represented
</p>
<p>the Indians to have been fairly repulsed by the crew, and no reference is made to
</p>
<p>the incident here recorded, of Jacobs' order to blow up the vessel. The incident

<p>is well authenticated, however, in the several Ms. accounts obtained by General
</p>
<p>Cass from the oid Canadian inhabitants, as well as by several cotemporary writers.
</p>
<p>See Pennsylvania Gazette No. 1816. Drake's account of the event differs in almost
</p>
<p>every particular from the version here given. There evidently is a vast difference

<p>between his industry and care, and that exhibited by Parkman.

<p>RAISING OF THE SIEGE. 83
</p>
<p>preserving any future authority over tlie tribes ; he submitted
</p>
<p>to what he could not prevent. Still, the warriors of his tribe
</p>
<p>proudly kept up a show of hostility, more as a matter of pride
</p>
<p>than of effect. They sought to worry foraging parties, to cut
</p>
<p>off stragglers, and kept the fort under close surveillance, but
</p>
<p>accomplished little. How much longer Pontiac would have
</p>
<p>fretted against the bars shutting out even his hopes of success
</p>
<p>it is not hard to determine. On the last day of October (1763)
</p>
<p>he received answers to his demands for help, dispatched months
</p>
<p>before to the French stations in the Mississippi valley. M. Ne-
</p>
<p>yon, commander of Fort Chartres, the chief fort and depot in
</p>
<p>the Illinois country, wrote to the Ottawa Chief that the French
</p>
<p>being at peace with the English no assistance could be ren-
</p>
<p>dered, and he therefore advised Pontiac to cease a warfare
</p>
<p>which could do no good. This note was, it would appear,
</p>
<p>written by M. Neyon at the demand of Sir Jeffrey Amhertit ;
</p>
<p>and the fact that it was not written until so demanded sho r^s
</p>
<p>the French to have connived at the war even if they could
</p>
<p>offer no aid. But, it is folly to presume that Pontiac had
</p>
<p>based his dreams upon the contingencies of their co-operation.
</p>
<p>We conceive it an improbable inference that, for the first time,
</p>
<p>after the receipt of M. Neyon's letter he beheld "his long
</p>
<p>cherished hopes of assistance from the French swept away at
</p>
<p>once," as Parkman has it. He knew, long before, of the treaty
</p>
<p>of Paris ; he had received no voluntary assistance even from
</p>
<p>the Canadian hahitans, save such as we have referred to as
</p>
<p>having been given by a few ruffians and half-breeds ; and M.
</p>
<p>Neyon's letter added nothing to his " weight of disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment." Parkman adds : " he saw himself and his people thrown
</p>
<p>back upon their own slender resources. In rage and mortifi-
</p>
<p>cation he left Detroit, and, with a number of his chiefs, repair-
</p>
<p>ed to the river Maumee, with the design of stirring up the
</p>
<p>Indians in that quarter and renewing hostilities in the spring,"
</p>
<p>That letter, indeed, was propitious to the designs of the Chief,

<p>since it enabled him to deceive his followers once more by
</p>
<p>putting on the semblance of mortification and rage to cover his
</p>
<p>exit to the south.

<p>The siege of Detroit by the savages tlius was raised, to give

</p>
<p>place to tlie siege by winter's frosts, storms and snows  a siege
</p>
<p>dreaded even to this day, when tlie comforts of civilization are
</p>
<p>attainable even by the poor. The Indians of all the tribes
</p>
<p>scattered during October to the woods, in their depths to find
</p>
<p>the game required for their subsistence, and to court the shel-
</p>
<p>ter from storms which the grand old arches of the wilderness
</p>
<p>gave to all.
</p>
<p>From this point the conspiracy proper is merged in the his-
</p>
<p>tory of Sir William Johnson's diplomacy as Indian Commis-
</p>
<p>sioner General ; of Bradstreet's campaign to Ohio and Detroit,
</p>
<p>from Niagara ; of Bouquet's expedition into the Muskingum
</p>
<p>country from Fort Pitt, and of the mission of Captain Morris
</p>
<p>to the Wabash country  all of which transpired during the
</p>
<p>summer and fall of 1764. These several enterprises were con-
</p>
<p>certed by the Lords of Trade, as preliminary to a new policy
</p>
<p>of kindness and conciliation to be pursued toward the Indians
</p>
<p>af^er they should be made to feel England's power. Sir Wil-
</p>
<p>liam Johnson ' and his deputy George Croghan were strenuous
</p>
<p>in their efforts to instate such a policy, but they conceded the
</p>
<p>ini possibility of employing it until the savages were first
</p>
<p>* Sir William Johnson was a man of remarkable traits. An Irishman by birth,
</p>
<p>he emigrated, when a young man, to the Mohawk valley, and there soon rose to
</p>
<p>wealth and importance, gaining a great influence over the Iroquois tribes, after-
</p>
<p>wards called the Six Nations. During the French war this influence was exercised
</p>
<p>go successfully for the English as to keep the Iroquois from the field except as al-
</p>
<p>lies of the English. He acted also as a Major-General in the war,' and, with the
</p>
<p>Colonial troops and a small body of Iroquois, won an important victory over the
</p>
<p>French under Baron Deskau, at Lake George. This success gave him a baronetcy
</p>
<p>and a present of five thousand pounds sterling. He was then appointed Superin-
</p>
<p>tendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern tribes  an office for which he was ad-
</p>
<p>mirably qualified, by courage, sagacity, knowledge of Indian character and influ-
</p>
<p>ence over the savages. In 1759 by the death of Prideaux, the Commanding-Gene-
</p>
<p>ral at Niagara, he was placed in the chief command, and, after a severe battle
</p>
<p>routed the French, planting the cross of St. George on the old stronghold. After

<p>THE NIAGARA GRAND COUNCIL. 85
</p>
<p>brought into subjection by force of arms. The programme
</p>
<p>]aid out for 1764 was to put two armies in the field, one under
</p>
<p>Bouquet to reach the Delawares, Shawnese and Miamis ; the
</p>
<p>other under Bradstreet to penetrate to Detroit, punishing every
</p>
<p>tribe which had shown hostility in Pontiac's war.
</p>
<p>Prior to the departure of these two expeditionary armies,
</p>
<p>Johnson had sent out runners of the Iroquois, calling a grand
</p>
<p>council to assemble at Niagara. Those who would escape the
</p>
<p>impending blow he warned to make their peace by attending
</p>
<p>this council. Bradstreet arrived at Niagara late in July, 1764,
</p>
<p>to find a host of Indians encamped around  in answer to
</p>
<p>Johnson's summons. The baronet's messengers had penetrat-
</p>
<p>ed to the North and West, finding all the tribes who had en-
</p>
<p>gaged in the war in a state of much destitution, owing to the
</p>
<p>sudden cessation of the fur trade and their losses by the war.
</p>
<p>They were therefore all the better disposed to a peace. Even
</p>
<p>the wild Ojibwas, who had then been summoned by Pontiac
</p>
<p>to again take the field before Detroit, preferred to accept
</p>
<p>Johnson's overtures and soon started their deputation to the
</p>
<p>council. Nor were the Ottawas unrepresented in that gather-
</p>
<p>ing of aboriginal notabilities  the section of the tribe at
</p>
<p>LArbre Ch^oche^ under the good priest Jonois, sending a deputa-
</p>
<p>tion. But they were the " Christian Indians" whom Pontiac
</p>
<p>scorned : not a member of his people was at the council.
</p>
<p>Johnson opened proceedings by first treating with the In-
</p>
<p>dians separately  a tedious but politic process. In this man-
</p>
<p>ner he made peace with the Sacs, Foxes, Winnebagoes, Meno-
</p>
<p>monies, Mississaugas, Caughnawagas, Ojibwas, the L'Arbre
</p>
<p>Croche Ottawas and a small deputation of the Detroit Wyan-
</p>
<p>dots. From these he extracted solemn promises of good faith,
</p>
<p>and they returned to their peripatetic homes filled with rum
</p>
<p>and loaded with presents. All were well pleased with the in-
</p>
<p>terview. The Shawnese and Delawares sent to the council
</p>
<p>the insulting messnge that they would treat for peace out of

<p>pity for the " old women" (the English).
</p>
<p>These proceedings ended, Bradstreet started for the West,
</p>
<p>accompanied by a large body of the Iroquois and by many
</p>
<p>Canadians. His orders were to proceed first to Sandusky,

<p>carrying war into the villages and country of the Wj-andots,
</p>
<p>Ottawas and Miamie. Arriving near Presqu' Isle, August
</p>
<p>12th, the expedition was forced, by a storm of wind and rain,
</p>
<p>to land. There Bradstreet was met b}^ a band of savages, who,
</p>
<p>proclaiming themselves to be Shawnese and Delawares depu-
</p>
<p>ties, sought terms of peace for those tribes. They were a band
</p>
<p>of warriors out on the war-path, who assumed the guise of
</p>
<p>agents for the purpose of testing tbe mettle of the English
</p>
<p>commander. He appears to have been a self-willed, unsaga-
</p>
<p>cious man. Against the advice of his officers, against the pro-
</p>
<p>test and warning of his Indian allies, that the pretended depu-
</p>
<p>ties were spies, he entered into a preliminary treaty to refrain
</p>
<p>from attacking their tribes  they stipulating to meet him with
</p>
<p>all their white prisoners at Sandusky, there to conclude a de-
</p>
<p>finitive treaty. As Bradstreet was not empowered to treat at
</p>
<p>all  as the Shawnese and Delawares were not in his province
</p>
<p> as Bouquet was especially commissioned to act against these
</p>
<p>tribes, Bradstreet's conduct certainly merited the censure af-
</p>
<p>terwards bestowed upon it by the Commander-in-Chief, Gene-
</p>
<p>ral Gage. Bradstreet sent word to Bouquet, then preparing
</p>
<p>to advance from Fort Pitt (now Pittsburg), that he might fore-
</p>
<p>go his expedition as the Shawnese and Delawares were already
</p>
<p>reduced to terms ! The vigorous and sagacious Bouquet treat-
</p>
<p>ed the affair as it deserved  with contempt, and hastened to
</p>
<p>push into the territory of the treacherous and relentless South-
</p>
<p>ern Ohio tribes. Even wbile these pretended emissaries had
</p>
<p>stipulated for peace their warriors were marching along the
</p>
<p>whole Pennsylvania and Virginia frontier; nor did they abate
</p>
<p>in atrocity until Bouquet's ba^^onets had forced the demons to
</p>
<p>a full submission and the rendition of every white captive in
</p>
<p>their keeping.
</p>
<p>After this exploit Bradstreet rowed along shore with his
</p>
<p>great flotilla until Sandusky was reached. There the same
</p>
<p>wretched farce was gone through with of accepting the " sub-

<p>amis. Garrisoning Fort Sandusky Bradstreet pushed on to
</p>
<p>Detroit, arriving there August 26th, 1764. He was received
</p>
<p>with a frenzy of joy by the long beleaguered garrison, who
</p>
<p>were at once relieved from duty. The siege of Detroit was
</p>
<p>raised. A grand council was at once called, and on the 7th of
</p>
<p>September he met, in the open air, a full delegation of the
</p>
<p>Wyandots, and a single deputy, the Chief Wasson, who repre-
</p>
<p>sented the Ottawas, Pottawatamies, Ojibwas, Miamis and Sacs.
</p>
<p>These he addressed through a French interpreter  an act which
</p>
<p>so incensed his allies, the Iroquois, that they refused to shake
</p>
<p>hands, to confirm terms which they did not understand. That
</p>
<p>simple act, together with Bradstreet's generally pusillanimous
</p>
<p>conduct, so unpleasantly impressed them that when they
</p>
<p>sought their homes it was in disgust and anger ; nor could Sir
</p>
<p>Wm. Johnson's potent influence reconcile them. They became
</p>
<p>sullen though not hostile  a state of affairs particularly to be
</p>
<p>regretted at that time when a general reconciliation and frater-
</p>
<p>nization was hoped for. Bradstreet readily obtained from the
</p>
<p>obsequious savages the promises he demanded.
</p>
<p>Pontiac had invested Detroit with many of his warriors
</p>
<p>during the spring and summer, keeping the garrison in a con-
</p>
<p>stant state of alarm. At Bradstreet's approach he withdrew
</p>
<p>to the Mauraee country, there to keep the fires of vengeance
</p>
<p>burning by the power of his great influence and his resistless
</p>
<p>eloquence. There Captain Morris found him, and at his hands
</p>
<p>received such a welcome as proved the Chief to be little in-
</p>
<p>clined to peace. Dispatched, in August, to the Maumee coun-
</p>
<p>try, Morris proceeded from Sandusky by the Lake to Maumee,
</p>
<p>and thence by canoes up that stream until the vicinity of the
</p>
<p>Ottawa villages was reached. He encountered a horde
</p>
<p>of braves whose feeling toward the Englishman was made
</p>
<p>strikingly manifest by menacing gestures and rough usaga
</p>
<p>At the village he was confronted by Pontiac in person. The
</p>
<p>Chief scowled ominously at the missionary and refused to ac-

<p>cept his extended hand. " The English are liars ! " he ejacu-
</p>
<p>lated, at the same time producing a letter purjDorting to have
</p>
<p>been written by the King of the French to him, promising aid
</p>
<p>and co-operation. This epistle of course was a forgery, but it

</p>
<p>served to give tlie Chief a tangible excuse for hia continued
</p>
<p>hostility. Morris could obtain no hearing; his party were
</p>
<p>stripped of their property, though he was permitted to
</p>
<p>pursue his journey to the country above. At old Fort Miami
</p>
<p>he barely escaped murder at the hands of the Miamis. The
</p>
<p>fort was in possession of some Canadian traders, who desired
</p>
<p>to offer him protection, and did so, although it was apparent
</p>
<p>that his life might be sacrificed at any moment. A deputation
</p>
<p>from the blood-thirsty Shawnese and Delawares had arrived
</p>
<p>with war-belts, but a short time before him ; Morris, hence,
</p>
<p>found the Miamis ready to co-operate in the general war pro-
</p>
<p>posed. These treacherous tribes were treating with the too-
</p>
<p>easily duped Bradstreet for peace at the very moment they
</p>
<p>were stirring up the western Indians to an exterminating war.
</p>
<p>Their proceedings with Bradstreet and their efforts to stay the
</p>
<p>progress of Colonel Bouquet's force were solely to gain time
</p>
<p>for a general uprising  a scheme in which we can readily con-
</p>
<p>ceive Pontiac to have entered with a leader's zeal. Morris was
</p>
<p>finally taken from the fort by two Miami warriors, stripped
</p>
<p>and led bound to the great village, passing to what he deemed
</p>
<p>his martyrdom at the stake. He was surrounded by the rab-
</p>
<p>ble and received with an uproar of epithets. Two of his Ca-
</p>
<p>nadian attendants followed, resolved to save him at the
</p>
<p>risk of their lives. A leading Miami chief, named Swan, also
</p>
<p>interposed, and, sustained by a young chief  a nephew of Pon-
</p>
<p>tiac  severed the bonds of the captive.' Morris then took
</p>
<p>courage and essayed to speak, when a chief named White Cat
</p>
<p>again seized him and bound him fast by his neck to the faggot
</p>
<p>post. At this a chief, named Peccane, interposed and, in great
</p>
<p>fury, bade them to go for English meat to Detroit. The Eng-
</p>
<p>lishman came as an ambassador and should be protected. He
</p>
<p>was released, yet only escaped the fury of his persecutors by
</p>
<p>being closely protected. He was at length permitted to return
</p>

<p>nadian attendants, told the Indian that Gladwyn had a number of Ottawa warriors
</p>
<p>in his hands as prisoners, and that any harm to Morris would be the signal for

</p>
<p>to his faithful Iroquois and Canadian attendants, who never,
</p>
<p>for a moment, had failed to sustain him.
</p>
<p>Thus the " embassy" was ended. Morris returned exhaust-
</p>
<p>ed and dispirited to Detroit  arriving there Sept. 17th, 1764,
</p>
<p>to find Bradstreet gone. Having dispatched garrisons to re-
</p>
<p>occupy the posts at Green Bay, Michilmacinac and Sault Ste
</p>
<p>Marie, and leaving with Gladwyn a force sufficient for effective
</p>
<p>defense, the Colonel returned to Sandusky, with the main body
</p>
<p>of his troops, to complete his arrangements with the deputies of
</p>
<p>the Shawnese and Delawares, with whom, it will be remem-
</p>
<p>bered, he had stipulated to treat. Arriving at Sandusky he
</p>
<p>awaited several days over the ajjpoiuted time, but no deputies,
</p>
<p>with their promised train of white captives, appeared. A few
</p>
<p>warriors, lurking upon his track as spies, appeared in the Bii-
</p>
<p>tish camp and begged a further delay, promising that, if Brad-
</p>
<p>street would remain quiet for another week the prisoners
</p>
<p>should be forthcoming. The foolish commander acceded to
</p>
<p>their request ; instead of seizing the rascals as hostages for
</p>
<p>the fulfilment of their promises, he allowed them to depart on
</p>
<p>their mission of arousing the savages to oppose any march into
</p>
<p>the country. Had Bradstreet essayed to penetrate to their
</p>
<p>villages he would have found the Otto was, Miamas, Wyandots
</p>
<p>and Shawnese in his war-path in such numbers as would have
</p>
<p>rendered his track a bloody one, even if the army was not
</p>
<p>overcome. During that week's delay, however, Bradstreet
</p>
<p>was put in possession of General Gage's rebuke, already refer-
</p>
<p>red to, repudiating his proceedings and ordering him to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed without delay to execute his orders on the Sandusky
</p>
<p>tribes, then to push for the Sciota country, there to effect a
</p>
<p>junction with Bouquet. Then soon came the journal kept by

<p>Captain Morris, dispatched ffom Detroit Bradsti-eet's e}-es

</p>
<p>storm gathered and for three days the expedition was tempest-
</p>
<p>tossed. Many of the boats were beached, others were leaky.
</p>
<p>Ee -gathering his forces, it was found that the barges were too
</p>
<p>few to convey the troops. Most of the Iroquois and a detach-
</p>
<p>ment of provincial militia were thereupon ordered to march
</p>
<p>along the shore, to Niagara  a distance of over two hundred
</p>
<p>and thirty miles, through jungles, over streams and swamps,
</p>
<p>with no equipments and provisions except such as they could
</p>
<p>carry on their backs. It was an inhuman order, and, had the
</p>
<p>Shawnese been in the vicinity, the entire band must have per-
</p>
<p>ished. As it was, they reached Niagara, after a seventeen
</p>
<p>days' march, the provincials in miserable plight, and the Iro-
</p>
<p>quois so thoroughly infuriated and disgusted as to be rendered
</p>
<p>enemies of the English instead of friends. Thus this expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, promising auspiciously at the outset, ended with half-ac-
</p>
<p>complished purposes. It had reinvigorated Detroit, regarri-
</p>
<p>soned several of the forts taken by the savages, and distracted
</p>
<p>tlie Indian confederation so far as to drive Pontiac into Ohio
</p>
<p>fc>r his allies ; but, the formidable Chief was neither brought
</p>
<p>to a treaty nor forced to submission; those hyenas of the
</p>
<p>woods, the Shawnese, and the equally implacable Delawares,
</p>
<p>still were on the war-path, desolating the border and keeping
</p>
<p>alive the fires of the conspiracy: Bradstreet is justly censured
</p>
<p>for his short comings, which were serious indeed. Had Sir
</p>
<p>William Johnson's influence been less the entire Iroquois con-
</p>
<p>federacy (Six Nations) might have drifted into the league of

<p>to 'lecfiy as too near the haunts of civilization  all were made
</p>
<p>to feel the terror of Shawnee and Delaware visitation. To stay
</p>
<p>this barbarous butchery the efforts of the settlers and local
</p>
<p>forces were powerless : * it was necessray to carry the war into
</p>
<p>the Indian country, to burn their villages, to ravage their corn-
</p>
<p>fields and to crush the warriors in battle, in order to compel
</p>
<p>the blood-thirsty wretches to terms. To this work Bouquet
</p>
<p>was assigned. A better man could not have been chosen. His
</p>
<p>experience during the previous year at the sanguinary battle
</p>
<p>of Bushy Eun proved him to be of the right mettle, while his
</p>
<p>discretion and wisdom were known and trusted. The savages
</p>
<p>feared him as they soon learned to despise Bradstreet ; and
</p>
<p>when it was found that the latter's order for the other to dis-
</p>
<p>continue his expedition from Fort Pitt was to be disregarded 
</p>
<p>that Bouquet was to carry the war into their very villages, the
</p>
<p>barbarians first began to think of peace.
</p>
<p>Bouquet, with his five hundred Highlanders, one thousand
</p>
<p>provincials and a strong body of skilled Yirginia and Mary-
</p>
<p>land border men, penetrated to the wilderness where several
</p>
<p>offending tribes had deemed their families safe. The middle
</p>
<p>of October found him over the Muskingum river, prepared to
</p>
<p>carry devastation into every village. His enemy, beholding
</p>
<p>the ruin and suffering in store for them, convinced that no
</p>
<p>perfidy and treachery could avail to save them fi-om puaish-
</p>
<p>ment, hastened to make terms of peace. A nan-ative of the
</p>
<p>ceremonies and negotiations which followed forms a very in-
</p>
<p>teresting chapter in the history of the war. By the prudence,
</p>
<p>the stem decision, the sagacity and the justice of Bouquet
</p>
<p>every object of his mission was accomplished without destroy-
</p>
<p> Among other measures adopted to encourage tlie settlers and others to hunt
</p>
<p>the Indians the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a proclamation offering a bounty
</p>
<p>on the scalps of Indian men and women. This act has by some been regarded as
</p>
<p>a barbarous measure ; but, when it is known that the " braves" were sustained

<p>men having been taken by the savages as wives, their children

</p>
<p>were restored to civilization and their homes. What a pain-

<p>ones were restored to their broken households ! Alas, how
</p>
<p>many never returned ! * Parkman, in his narrative of Bouquet's

<p>expedition, dwells at considerable length upon the scenes and
</p>
<p>incidents which transpired during these interesting and event-
</p>
<p>ful moments of reunion.
</p>
<p>Where was Pontiac? In the midst of all these calamities
</p>
<p>to his cause the proud Chief still held a defiant front. One by
</p>
<p>one his allies left his side  the Ojibwas, Pottawatamies and
</p>
<p>Wyandots first ; then the Shawnese and Delawares, upon
</p>
<p>whose strength he rested in security. He witnessed the move-
</p>
<p>ments of Bradstreet and Bouquet, powerless to oppose them ;
</p>
<p>but, his fertile mind was concocting new combinations to carry
</p>
<p>on his wild crusade against civilization. In the fall of 1764
</p>
<p>we find him once more on the scene of operations. His rest-
</p>
<p>less spirit, undaunted by discouragement, now arose in mighty
</p>
<p>majesty ; his Conspiracy took new form. ; his power once more
</p>
<p>became formidable to the English.
</p>
<p>His plan now was to unite all the warriors of the Mississippi
</p>

<p>them from taking possession of the forts in that section ceded

<p>the country of tlie Miamis, Kickapoos, PiankisTiaws and of tlie
</p>
<p>Illinois tribes. In every village his imperious spirit found ut-
</p>
<p>terance in words winged with the eloquence which ever stire
</p>
<p>a savage breast, and the war-song went up along his path.
</p>
<p>Arrived in the country of the Illinois he found himself in the
</p>
<p>midst of French whose hatred of the English was little less
</p>
<p>than his own. By these men he was cajoled with promises of
</p>
<p>aid never destined to fulfilment. They represented mattere in
</p>
<p>very false colors, and, it is said, really impressed Pontiac with
</p>
<p>the belief in aid from the King of the French. In expectation
</p>
<p>of this aid the Chief visited Fort Chartres, on the Mississippi
</p>
<p>river, where the French were still in command and possession.
</p>
<p>M. Neyon de Villiers, angered and humiliated at the cession
</p>
<p>of French possession, in the Illinois country to the detested
</p>
<p>English, had withdrawn from his post and gone down to New
</p>
<p>Orleans, where he fondly supposed the French were to remain
</p>
<p>masters. His command was turned over to M. St Ange de
</p>
<p>Bellerive, an old officer who had spent a lifetime in this Indian
</p>
<p>service. This officer was greatly perplexed at the anomalous
</p>
<p>state of affairs which surrounded him. A French commander,
</p>
<p>with a French garrison, surrounded by French trading posts
</p>
<p>and Indians all devoted to the French interest, he was only
</p>
<p>awaiting a relief garrison to transfer all to English possession.
</p>
<p>He could therefore do nothing but wait. Beset by savages
</p>
<p>clamorous for their usual supply of powder and guns, by trad-
</p>
<p>ers soliciting aid he could not give, by agents stirring up the
</p>
<p>Indians to hostility against those to assume the control of af-
</p>
<p>fairs, his position was one of perplexity from which there was
</p>
<p>no escape. It was not rendered any the less intolerable by the
</p>
<p>sudden advent of Pontiac and his band of four hundred reso-
</p>
<p>lute warriors. The haughty Chief was prepared to demand
</p>
<p>aid as his right, and did so in terms which St. Ange could not
</p>
<p>mistake. But the French commander really was powerless to
</p>
<p>comply with the request for arms and ammunition, and so an-

<p>swered, much to the Chief's anger and disgust The stern
</p>
<p>warriors encamped around the Fort, evidently resolved to

<p>make it their resting place to await the appearance of the

<p>English, when the fires of warfare were again to be lit

<p>94: THE CONSPIEACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>The delay at tliis point was, for anotlier reason, somewhat
</p>
<p>imperative. When the embassy first started for the West
</p>
<p>Pontiac prepared an immense wampum belt, which was dis-
</p>
<p>patched to the tribes of the South, by the hands of a delega-
</p>
<p>tion of well-known Shawnee, Delaware, Miami and Ottawa
</p>
<p>chiefs. This belt was borne down the Mississippi river to all
</p>
<p>the tribes along its boundaries. Everywhere it was received
</p>
<p>with great ceremonies, and, in every instance, so far as the
</p>
<p>record exists, did not fail to stir up the spirit of strife. Ponti-
</p>
<p>ac's name was well known to every warrior of note even among
</p>
<p>those living in the far South, and his embassy was accredited
</p>
<p>with all the respect due to a chief whom the savages all ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged as their superior. The wampum, after having
</p>
<p>visited all available tribes, was finally borne to New Orleans,
</p>
<p>there to lay it before the French Governor, and, in Pontiac's
</p>
<p>name, to demand of him aid in guns, ammunition and stores,
</p>
<p>with which to carry on the war against the English. The ac-
</p>
<p>credited warriors appeared in the Southern city at an unpro-
</p>
<p>pitious time. They were, indeed, most unwelcome. The
</p>
<p>French Governor, M. D'Abbadie, was then very ill from ex-
</p>
<p>citement and chagrin. But a few weeks previous to the Indian
</p>
<p>advent the news was promulgated that, by a' secret convention,
</p>
<p>France had transferred to Spain all her possessions in the Lou-
</p>
<p>isiana territory. This filled the cup of bitterness for the proud
</p>
<p>and really able Frenchman at the head of affaii's, and he await-
</p>
<p>ed the arrival of the Spanish garrison and Governor to quit
</p>
<p>the country in disgust
</p>
<p>Pontiac's messengers were not to be deterred from pressing
</p>
<p>their claims upon D'Abbadie, and a council was granted, to
</p>
<p>which a number of English ofiicers were admitted. A Shaw-
</p>
<p>nee chief, displaying the great war-belt, spake for the embassy.
</p>
<p>Parkma;n thus reports the speech :
</p>
<p>" These red dogs" alluding to the English, " have crowded
</p>
<p>us more and more, and, when we ask them by what right they

</p>
<p>come, they tell us that you, our French fathers, have given
</p>
<p>them our lands. We know that they lie. These lands are
</p>
<p>neither yours nor theirs, and no man shall give or sell them
</p>
<p>without oui' consent. Fathers, we have always been your

</p>
<p>faithful cliildren, and we now have come to ask you that you
</p>
<p>will give us guns, powder and lead, to aid us in this war."
</p>
<p>The extreme feebleness of D'Abbadie prevented much of a
</p>
<p>reply. He strove to appease their evident excitement and dis-
</p>
<p>missed them with orders to have them cared for as his guests.
</p>
<p>That night he died, and, at the council of the succeeding day,
</p>
<p>his successor, M. Aubry, failed to answer satisfactorily to the
</p>
<p>Indians' demand. A Miami chief made a fierce speech, full
</p>
<p>of bitterness toward the French for being conquered, and of
</p>
<p>hate toward the English. " As for you," he exclaimed, turn-
</p>
<p>ing toward the English officers present, " our hearts burn with
</p>
<p>rage when we think of the ruin you have brought on us." M.
</p>
<p>Aubry declared it his wish that the Indians should be at peace
</p>
<p> that the English meant no harm and would treat them well
</p>
<p>if they behaved well. A few presents were distributed among
</p>
<p>the thoroughly infuriated ambassadors, and, early on the mor-
</p>
<p>row, they were paddling their canoes up the Mississippi, their
</p>
<p>hearts thoroughly surcharged with the inry of disappointed
</p>
<p>hope and disgust at the impotence of their old friends aind
</p>
<p>fathers, the French. They bore in their keeping the woids
</p>
<p>which must forever dash Pontiac's hopes of aid from any source ;
</p>
<p>and, without arms, how powerless was he even with ten thou-
</p>
<p>sand braves at his call !
</p>
<p>The embassy reached Fort Chartres on its return in Febru-
</p>
<p>ary, 1765. Pontiac had awaited the coming of his agents with
</p>
<p>much anxiety. We can imagine the rage which filled hia
</p>
<p>proud and defiant soul at the request sent by the French Gov
</p>
<p>emor of New Orleans for him to make peace with the English.
</p>
<p>Yet, what could he do? The all conquering English were
</p>
<p>pressing in fi-om the East. Croghan, the deputy of Sir William
</p>
<p>Johnson, was, even then, after immeasurable peril, in the Illi-
</p>
<p>nois country, having entered successfully on his mission of
</p>
<p>pacification. One by one the Western tribes passed from the
</p>
<p>power of his savage control to accept the terms tendered by

<p>the English agent. There remained for the Chief but two
</p>
<p>courses to pursue : one, escape to the west of the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>where dwelt the wild and powerful Dacotah, the remorseless
</p>
<p>and intractable Sioux, the subtle and suspicious Osages  not
</p>
<p>96 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>one of wliom would confess the other brother, or war together
</p>
<p>in any common cause. Pontiac could hope to do little with
</p>
<p>them, even with his powerful eloquence, and might, at any
</p>
<p>moment, excite jealousies which would cost him his life. To
</p>
<p>the North were tribes ready to obey his will, but what were
</p>
<p>they if alone pitted against the strong foe ? He might, indeed,
</p>
<p>banish himself, with a proud remnant of his people, to the
</p>
<p>regions of Lake Superior, but, what an end to all his dreams
</p>
<p>of power!
</p>
<p>The second alternative opened for his choice was that of
</p>
<p>peace  to accept the terms of amnesty and reconciliation ex-
</p>
<p>tended by Croghan and to abide the issue of events  ^hoping
</p>
<p>that, in the unsettled order of affairs a disorder might arise
</p>
<p>propitious to his further attempts at aboriginal consolidation.
</p>
<p>This alternative he resolved to adopt. How must his turbu-
</p>
<p>lent spirit have revolted at such a step ! Yet, we can well be-
</p>
<p>lieve he found consolation in his perfidious heart. Duplicity,
</p>
<p>treachery, insincerity, were weapons kept in reserve when
</p>
<p>all others failed : upon their potency he relied, with a savage
</p>
<p>obliviousness to honor, to carry him through even the humili-
</p>
<p>ations of a peace.
</p>
<p>Croghan's mission was one full of wild adventure and dan-
</p>
<p>ger. Jt required not only a stout heart to penetrate the Indian
</p>
<p>country, but great prudence in managing the savages over
</p>
<p>whom the wand of peace was to be waved. These qualities
</p>
<p>the deputy of Sir William Johnson appears to have possessed
</p>
<p>in a bountiful degree. Though attacked by the Kickapoos on
</p>
<p>the Ohio, just below the mouth of the Wabash, and two-thirds
</p>
<p>of his party killed or wounded, the leader was spared and
</p>
<p>borne a prisoner to Yincennes, where he found a kind recep-
</p>
<p>tion from Canadian traders, and the chiefs friendly to the ob-
</p>
<p>jects of his mission. From Yincennes, though a prisoner, he
</p>
<p>was permitted to proceed up the Wabash to Fort Ouatanon,
</p>
<p>arriving there June 23d, 1765, to find the old fort tenanted by

</p>
<p>a motly crowd of traders and savages of both sexes. By these
</p>
<p>he was made welcome ; and the news, which soon spread by
</p>
<p>messengers, of his presence and the powers with which he was
</p>
<p>clothed, soon served to surround him with deputations from all
</p>
<p>PONTIAC BURIES THE HATCHET. 97
</p>
<p>tlie adjacent tribes and sub-tribes. These Indians all smoked
</p>
<p>and made peace, swearing eternal fealty to the English. One
</p>
<p>tribe of the Hlinois dispatched a messenger  a Frenchman  to
</p>
<p>Ouatanon with the polite request for the Indians at the post
</p>
<p>to burn the deputy ; but, peace was already made, and no
</p>
<p>Pontiac was there to perpetrate the atrocious act.
</p>
<p>The news of Croghan's arrival and labors soon reached St
</p>
<p>Ange at Fort Chartres, whose disagreeable position already
</p>
<p>has been adverted to. Surrounded by Pontiac's hungry and
</p>
<p>defiant warriors, all the winter and spring the French com-
</p>
<p>mander had lived in daily expectation of an outbreak. Day
</p>
<p>by day he had kept his weary watch over the stream which
</p>
<p>flowed away in its wonderful tide to the Grulf, hoping to see
</p>
<p>the cross of St. George bearing up to his relief; but, though
</p>
<p>two expeditions started from New Orleans they were aban-
</p>
<p>doned as impractical, and, up to the date of Croghan's arrival,
</p>
<p>no English force had reached Fort Chartres. St. Ange, hence,
</p>
<p>welcomed the agent and dispatched a messenger to hasten his
</p>
<p>visit to the Illinois country. Arrangements were soon made
</p>
<p>for the journey. No longer a prisoner he was attended by a
</p>
<p>la rge body of waniors and chiefs as an honorary guard and the
</p>
<p>Tb arch to Fort Chartres commenced. When but a few miles
</p>
<p>o>i the way, Croghan was surprised by encountering the for-
</p>
<p>nidable Ottawa Chief, who, it appeared, was en route with a
</p>
<p>Ivrge body of his leading men for Ouatanon, to make peace
</p>
<p>with the agent. All returned to the' Wabash, where a council
</p>
<p>at once was convened and the terms of a treaty soon arranged.
</p>
<p>Pontiac treated the Englishman with a dignity becoming a
</p>
<p>great brave. He acknowledged that he had been deceived by
</p>
<p>the French, but failed to concede to any white man rights to
</p>
<p>soil.
</p>
<p>This practically ended the objects of the mission to the Illi-
</p>
<p>nois country. Accompanied by Pontiac and a large retinue
</p>
<p>of his warriors, Croghan bent his way to Detroit, by way of

</p>
<p>Fort Miami and the Maumee river, holding conferences at nu-
</p>
<p>merous villages on the route. He reached Detroit August 17th,
</p>
<p>to find great numbers of Ottawas, Pottawatamies and Ojibwas
</p>
<p>ill the vicinity, all eager to enter into covenants for peace.

<p>98 THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>Their sufferings through a total cessation of the fur trade, by
</p>
<p>which their many wants of blankets, guns, ammunition, ket-
</p>
<p>tles, &c., had been supplied, their losses in battle, and the ab-
</p>
<p>sence of their usual supply of rum, all conspired to make the
</p>
<p>red-men repentant and anxious for Croghan's coming. He
</p>
<p>quickly convened the chief men of all the tribes in the old
</p>
<p>Pottawatamie council chamber. There Pontiac had lit the
</p>
<p>fires of conspiracy, and there it was meet that they should be
</p>
<p>quenched. Even the blood-thirsty wretch who had led the
</p>
<p>massacre at Michilmacinac was present to ask terms of recon-
</p>
<p>ciliation. Pontiac was a comparatively quiet spectator, taking
</p>
<p>but small part in the ceremonies, though lending his influence
</p>
<p>to a consummation of the objects of the mission. He, to all
</p>
<p>appearances, acted in good faith, though it is not to be con-
</p>
<p>ceived that his thoroughly perfidious nature was capable < )f
</p>
<p>acting from any other impulse than of policy. On the 28th of
</p>
<p>August, in reply to Croghan's formal speech of congratulati* >n
</p>
<p>and fraternity made on the previous day, Pontiac declared bis
</p>
<p>peace to be permanently made, and closed with an eloqueat
</p>
<p>exordium that the rum-barrel might be opened and his w?\r-
</p>
<p>riors be permitted to quench their thirst.
</p>
<p>The conferences were not finally ended until late in Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, when Croghan returned to Niagara to report the success
</p>
<p>which had attended his labors. His journal, written out with
</p>
<p>much care, still is preserved in the State Office at Albany. It
</p>
<p>was perused, at the date of his return, by Sir William John-
</p>
<p>son and General Gage, Commander-in-Chief, with great satis-
</p>
<p>faction. It was the record of the close of the great Conspiracy.

<p>Our narrative would properly close here, but we may be

<p>permitted briefly to recur to the succeeding career of Pontiaa
</p>
<p>Early in the summer of 1766 the Ottawa Chief, agreeable to
</p>
<p>promise made to Broghan, started upon a visit to Sir WilHam

</p>
<p>eral chiefs from the confederated tribes, he passed down Lake

<p>Erie from the Maumee river, on which stream he had located
</p>
<p>his people. The voyage was made in birch-bark canoes along
</p>
<p>the southern shore of the great Lake, over which the mighty
</p>
<p>fleets of the all conquering race were, ere another half century,

<p>to sweep. Could the proud savage have had the veil lifted 
</p>
<p>could he have beheld the coming of the mighty host scattering
</p>
<p>great cities in its train, how would his barbarian spirit have
</p>
<p>raved in its impotence ! He really stood upon the threshhold,
</p>
<p>only a shadow of the past  a type of the darkness doomed to
</p>
<p>pass away before the white skinned civilization coming.
</p>
<p>Arriving at Schlosser canoes and packs were taken on
</p>
<p>the shoulders of the bronze braves and borne down Niagara
</p>
<p>river past the falls to Lake Ontario at Fort Niagara. From
</p>
<p>thence, after a brief tarry, the little fleet pursued its way down
</p>
<p>to Oswego, where Sir William Johnson awaited the Ottowa's
</p>
<p>coming. How he was informed of that coming we are not ad-
</p>
<p>vised, but he was present, with an imposing body of Iroquois,
</p>
<p>to receive the "Western deputation.
</p>
<p>The first meeting of welcome took place July 23d, 1766. ' The
</p>
<p>formal grand council opened on the succeeding day and was
</p>
<p>continued until July 31st. It was attended with the usi;al
</p>
<p>Indian ceremonials and forms, but proved highly interestijig
</p>
<p>in its matter and manner of discourse. All things were ar-
</p>
<p>ranged satisfactorily, and the council ended by a distribution
</p>
<p>of numerous gifts to the embassy. Johnson, throughout the
</p>
<p>entire proceedings, acted with his usual keen judgment, and
</p>
<p>apparently, gained over the mind of Pontiac and his followers
</p>
<p>influence like that which he had won over the Iroquois.
</p>
<p>That it was only a passing influence was demonstrated
</p>
<p>ere a year had fled, when the West again resounded with
</p>
<p>threatenings which were soon to be followed by the second

<p>war of the border  a prelude to the sacrifices and massacres of
</p>
<p>the Revolution.
</p>
<p>Pontiac does not appear upon the stage again except like a
</p>
<p>portentous shadow flitting hither and thither through the
</p>
<p>Western wilderness to excite the anxiety of garrisons and

<p>we learn that chiefs of the Ottawas, Hurons, Chippewas(Ojibwas) and Pottawata-
</p>
<p>mies were present. Pontiac in his reply to Johnson's address, said among other
</p>
<p>things : " I speak in the name of all the nations to the Westward, of whom I am
</p>
<p>the master." And again : " When you address me, it is the same as if you ad-

</p>
<p>savages to a perpetuation of their rancor toward the English,
</p>
<p>it is certain that his influence was not exerted to fulfil the
</p>
<p>terms of his treaty ; every commander, agent and trader in the
</p>
<p>West, from Fort Pitt, Presqu' Isle, Detroit, to Michilmacinac
</p>
<p>and Fort Chartres, felt that his influence was bad ; he was
</p>
<p>everywhere, and, apparently with good reason, regarded with
</p>
<p>distrust. Had he been spared to the period of the War of the
</p>
<p>Ee volution, with what joy would his treacherous heart have
</p>
<p>welcomed the British Government's call of the savages to the
</p>
<p>field ! Well, mdeed, for the border settlements in 1777 and
</p>
<p>1778 that the great Conspirator was dead.
</p>
<p>He was murdered in 1769 by a member of one of the Illi-
</p>
<p>nois tribes. Accounts are, however, quite conflicting regard-
</p>
<p>ing the time and place of his death. Parkman gives confidence
</p>
<p> properly so, we think  to the precise statements of the late
</p>
<p>Pierre Chouteau, of St. Louis, who, through all his after life,
</p>
<p>recalled the incidents distinctly. He stated that Pontiac, with
</p>
<p>a number of his chiefs, had visited the Illinois country  for
</p>
<p>what reason is not known. In April, 1769, he spent several
</p>
<p>days in St. Louis, then a Spanish post. There,he was so favo-
</p>
<p>rably received as to add to the anxiety of the English regard-
</p>
<p>ing his presence. He, at length, passed pver the river to Ca-
</p>
<p>hokia, where the Illinois Indians always were congregated in
</p>
<p>considerable numbers. Cahokia was an old French settlement,
</p>
<p>whose Creole inhabitants had so far assimilated with the red
</p>
<p>race as to seem like their veritable "brothers." Pontiac found
</p>
<p>a warm welcome at their hands. A feast followed and, in
</p>
<p>common with all his warriors, the Ottawa Chief became drunk.
</p>
<p>The moment for the English to rid themselves of their detested
</p>
<p>and dreaded foe seemed to have arrived. A trader named
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, then in the village, resolved to see the deed of
</p>
<p>assassination consummated, and, with a barrel of whisky bribed
</p>
<p>a vagabond brave of the Kaskaskia tribe to kill the Chief
</p>
<p>The favorable opportunity was not long wanting. Pontiac,

</p>
<p>loaded with liquor, reeled away into the woods, chaunting as
</p>
<p>he staggered along the medicine song of the race of magicians,
</p>
<p>to which the Chief was reputed to belong. This was the last
</p>
<p>ever seen of the gi-eat warrior alive. His dead body was, in a

</p>
<p>brief time discovered. Then followed a scene whicli beggars
</p>
<p>description. From hamlet to hamlet the intelligence flew.
</p>
<p>The air resounded with the wails of the Ottawa warriors. Soon
</p>
<p>these wails were changed to the wild war-whoop, and the war-
</p>
<p>riors, swinging aloft theii" tomahawks, cried aloud for vengeance.
</p>
<p>The Kaskaskias drew their weapons for the onslaught, appa-
</p>
<p>rently eager to annihilate the whole Ottawa band. But, no
</p>
<p>bloodshed followed. Pontiac's followers bounded off into the
</p>
<p>jvoods, to bear to the tribes of the East and North news of his
</p>
<p>death, and to call them to the war-path. The murdered Chief
</p>
<p>was left weltering in his gore until the body was claimed by
</p>
<p>St, Ange  then commanding at St. Louis  who buiied it with,
</p>
<p>martial ceremony near the Spanish fort.
</p>
<p>Parkman observes, of the war which followed : " Could his
</p>
<p>shade have revisited the scene of murder his savage spirit
</p>
<p>would have exulted in the vengeance which overwhelmed the
</p>
<p>abettors of the crime. Whole tribes were rooted out to expi-
</p>
<p>ate it Chiefs and sachems, whose veins had thrilled with his
</p>
<p>eloquence  young warriors, whose aspiring hearts had caught
</p>
<p>the inspiration of his greatness, mustered to revenge his fate,
</p>
<p>and from the North and East their united bands descended on
</p>
<p>the villages of the Elinois. Tradition has but faintly preserv-
</p>
<p>ed the memory of the event ; and its only annalists, men who
</p>
<p>held the intestine feuds of the savage tribes in no more account
</p>
<p>than the quarrels of panthers or wild cats, have left but a mea-
</p>
<p>gre record. Yet enough remains to tell us that, over the grave
</p>
<p>of Pontiac, more blood was poured out in atonement than
</p>
<p>flowed from the hecatombs of slaughtered heroes on the corpse
</p>
<p>of Patroculus ; and the remnant of the Illinois who survived
</p>
<p>the carnage remained forever after sunk in utter insignificance."
</p>
<p>If such was the vengeance of savages towards their own race,
</p>
<p>it is not to be wondered at that their vengeance toward the
</p>
<p>whites was characterised by a cruelty and ferocity which
</p>
<p>would have shocked the barbarian hordes who swept down

<p>THEPAXTON ''RIOTS."
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania was the scene of intense excitement during
</p>
<p>the winter of 1763-64. In the settlements along the Eastern
</p>
<p>slopes of the Alleghanies and the upper vallies of the Susque-
</p>
<p>hanna, Indian barbarities that are sickening to contemplate
</p>
<p>had scarcely ceased when a spirit of revenge sprang into life
</p>
<p>which, for a brief season, threatened the total subversion of
</p>
<p>all order in society if not all order in government. It origi-
</p>
<p>nated primarily in hostility to the Indian race, and, secondari-
</p>
<p>ly, in the Quaker policy of the Pennsylvania Assembly.
</p>
<p>While it supported from public monies bodies of Christian-
</p>
<p>ized Indians, the Assembly, owing to its Quaker majority, re-
</p>
<p>fused to sustain the hardy border men in resisting incur-
</p>
<p>sions of the savages. The awful sufferings of the frontier set-
</p>
<p>tlements ; the tardy, almost heartless, co-operation of the As-
</p>
<p>sembly ; the protection and support given to the Moravian and
</p>
<p>Conestoga Indians ; the bitterness existing between the Qua-
</p>
<p>kers and the Presbyterians  all conspired to excite the frontier
</p>
<p>men to a coui-se which, though reprehensible, had strong ex-
</p>
<p>tenuating circumstances.

<p>A remnant of an ancient section of the Iroquois still remain-

</p>
<p>the Susquehanna. A treaty made with William Penn, and
</p>
<p>ratified by succeeding Governors, had guaranteed to the In-
</p>
<p>dians their possessions in the manor ; there they had lived,
</p>
<p>undisturbed, for many years  decreasing in numbers as the

</p>
<p>prised only twenty persons  men, women and children, who
</p>
<p>obtained the means of sustenance through the manufacture by
</p>
<p>the women of baskets, brooms, bead- work, and by the rude culti-
</p>
<p>vation of small corn patches. The men (six in number) were
</p>
<p>veritable vagabonds, who, at any moment, would sell their
</p>
<p>squaws' honor for a dram of rum. They were considered by
</p>
<p>their white neighbors simply as a social nuisance, perfectly
</p>
<p>harmless, and not considerate enough of their own welfare to
</p>
<p>do any thing requiring exertion of any kind.
</p>
<p>The massacres along the Susquehanna above Lancaster, du-
</p>
<p>ring 1763, had so thoroughly exasperated the people that no
</p>
<p>quarter was given to any savage caught on the war-path. The
</p>
<p>woods were infested with the tireless warriors, who crept like
</p>
<p>snakes upon their prey, indiscriminately butchering men, wo-
</p>
<p>men and children  a few only of the females being spared to
</p>
<p>be borne off into captivity. All the year long a great cry of
</p>
<p>sorrow went up from the region, now so beautiful in its rich-
</p>
<p>ness, comprised in the counties of Cumberland, Dauphin, York,
</p>
<p>Lancaster and Berks. The people ceased to cultivate lands ;
</p>
<p>estates and tenements were deserted, the fugitives seeking safe-
</p>
<p>ty in the eastern and southern settlements ; everywhere along
</p>
<p>the frontier only the hardy border man tarried, to care for his
</p>
<p>little property or to hunt the savage. Even in villages not

<p>* We say " civilization" for want of a true term by which to express a painful
</p>
<p>fact. Contact with the whites almost uniformly carries vice to the Indian house-
</p>
<p>hold and community. It debauches the females and debases the males, both to a
</p>
<p>degree incomprehensible when we consider that the red race has a quick and pen-
</p>
<p>etrating intelligence, that it loves independence and, in its native state, possesses
</p>
<p>noble traits of honor and virtue. Palpable reasons for this vice are offered ; as,
</p>
<p>for instance, the Indian love for liquor  the female love of adornment  the disin-
</p>
<p>clination of the males to labor  the native love for a vagabond life. But, all these
</p>
<p>are incidental faults ; they never were displayed until the white man came with

<p>his " civilization", and, by all the laws of logic they are therefore chargeable to
</p>
<p>that civilization. In his most primitive state, when his passions are those of the

<p>tiger  playful when at peace but remorseless when oa the war-path  the savage

</p>
<p>was used to prevent surprise ; every man carried his fire-arms
</p>
<p>to church, to the field, in his visits, and kept them by his bed-
</p>
<p>side at night.
</p>
<p>Among the places sacked and its inhabitants butchered du-
</p>
<p>ring the French War (1755) was Paxton  a little settlement
</p>
<p>on the Susquehanna, near the present site of Harrisburg, It
</p>
<p>was, in 1763, one of the most exposed of villages. Its people
</p>
<p>were relatives of those murdered in the fii-st onslaught of the
</p>
<p>savages, and in their bosoms burned a hatred of the red race
</p>
<p>to be quenched only with the annihilation of their detested
</p>
<p>foe. In common with most of the border hamlets it was peo-
</p>
<p>pled by Presbyterians of North-of-Ireland descent  a race of
</p>
<p>men about equally addicted to scripture, to dislike of Quakers
</p>
<p>and to eagerness for a "set to" with any kind of an antagonist
</p>
<p>They were not lacking in the material for a riot, nor did they
</p>
<p>lack for reasons which offered them, at the time, enough ex-
</p>
<p>cuse for their violence to find many sympathisers among men
</p>
<p>in high station.
</p>
<p>We have here the two ingredients of the outbreak which
</p>
<p>iollowed. The Paxton, men confident that the Conestoga vag-
</p>
<p>abonds were leagued with the hostile Indians, acting as spies
</p>
<p>for them and giving them shelter, resolved upon the " wiping
</p>
<p>out" the entire twenty  men, women and children. During
</p>
<p>the second week of December a Paxton scout reported that an
</p>
<p>Indian guilty of crimes on the frontier had been traced to Con-
</p>
<p>estoga, where he was entertained by the manor families. Thia
</p>
<p>fired the combustible materials of the " riot" Matthew Smith,
</p>
<p>a recognised leader among the Paxton people, called five of his
</p>
<p>trusty fellows to the saddle and they proceeded to the manor
</p>
<p>to reconnoitre. Beaching it early in the night Smith himself
</p>
<p>approached the cabins, and, peering into those in which fires
</p>
<p>were burning, discovered what he reported to be armed savag-
</p>
<p>es. Thus the worst suspicions of the settlement were confirm-
</p>
<p>ed, and it was resolved no longer to delay the oft-threatened

</p>
<p>extirpation. Gathering about fifty men, well armed and
</p>
<p>mounted, Smith led the way to the cabins, reaching them early
</p>
<p>on the morning of December lith. The party picketing their
</p>
<p>horses in the woods, approached stealthily on foot through th

</p>
<p>snow, but not so noiselessly as to give no alarm. The suscept-
</p>
<p>ible ear of an Indian caught the mufHed tread of feet. He issued
</p>
<p>from one of the cabins to reconnoitre. A rifle ball brought
</p>
<p>him to the ground, shot by one of the band who professed to
</p>
<p>recognise the savage as the one who had killed his (the border
</p>
<p>man's) mother. A wild shout rent the air and the borderers
</p>
<p>passed into the little tenements to kill every red-skin found-
</p>
<p>Only six were there  all the others having, as if in premoni-
</p>
<p>tion of their fate, scattered throughout the neighborhood during
</p>
<p>the previous day. These six were horribly mutilated  ^the
</p>
<p>white men, for the moment, becoming veritable savages. The
</p>
<p>cabins were then rifled of whatever of value they contained
</p>
<p>and the torch applied. By the light of the flames the " aveng-
</p>
<p>ers" made their way, through the deep snow, toward Paxton.
</p>
<p>An alarm soon spread. The light of the burning log houses
</p>
<p>lit up the sad scene and brought many neighbors to the spot
</p>
<p>These gathered the half consumed bodies of the dead and gave
</p>
<p>them decent burial. The sheriff of Lancaster, being on the
</p>
<p>ground at once, gathered the fourteen remaining Indians from
</p>
<p>the farm houses in the neighborhood and had them borne for
</p>
<p>protection to the Lancaster jail. Excitement over the tragedy
</p>
<p>ran high. The general voice then condemned the murder as
</p>
<p>atrocious and uncalled for, though a few, with the old hate of
</p>
<p>the race still rankling in their breasts, extenuated the deed of
</p>
<p>blood as an excusable revenge for wrongs suffered. The news
</p>
<p>quickly flew to Philadelphia. Governor Penn offered, by pro-
</p>
<p>clamation, a reward for the discovery of the murderers, and,
</p>
<p>for a few days, there was an earnest purpose on the part of the
</p>
<p>authorities to ferret out every man concerned in the crime.
</p>
<p>But, all this scarcely affected the bold fellows who had re-
</p>
<p>solved upon wiping out the Conestoga tribe  fourteen of whom
</p>
<p>still remained, though safely protected by the strong walls of
</p>
<p>the stone jail in Lancaster. A spy was dispatched to the jail,
</p>
<p>by the Paxton men, to ascertain if, among the Indians in the

<p>jail, there was one suspected of having killed a relative to a
</p>
<p>member of the men in arms. The spy reported favorably to
</p>
<p>the suspicion ; when the band determined upon a visitation to
</p>
<p>the jail, under the guidance of one Lazarus Stewart. Smith,

</p>
<p>the former leader, accompanied tlie second expedition  -wliicli,
</p>
<p>it is stated by some authorities, was only for the seizure of the
</p>
<p>suspected savage, who was to be borne to Carlisle, and, if
</p>
<p>identified of the crime attributed to him, was there to be hung.
</p>
<p>If the leader entertained such a design his men certainly were
</p>
<p>not of his mind ; they en],isted to consummate the horrible
</p>
<p>work commenced at the cabins of exterminating the wretched
</p>
<p>outcasts.
</p>
<p>Having arranged all for a sudden descent on Lancaster the
</p>
<p>band left Paxton December 27th, 1763  all well mounted and
</p>
<p>armed. In starting from the village they were confronted by
</p>
<p>their pastor, Kev. John Elder, whose influence though great
</p>
<p>could not dissuade the men from their purpose. Pushing on
</p>
<p>to Lancaster, at three in the afternoon the Paxton rangers rode
</p>
<p>rapidly into the town, turned their horses loose in a yard and,
</p>
<p>without a moment's delay, rushed to the jail. The door of the
</p>
<p>strong building offered but a moment's resistance ; soon the
</p>
<p>entire mob of desperate men was inside. The fourteen Indians
</p>
<p>were, at that moment, in the jail yard. They cowered before
</p>
<p>the sudden storm and read their fate at a glance. Two or
</p>
<p>three of the red-men seized billets of wood as if to defend them-
</p>
<p>selves, but there was no defense against the rifles and toma-
</p>
<p>hawks of fifty savage whites, intent on blood. Crowding into
</p>
<p>the yard they quickly completed the work of death. It was a
</p>
<p>revolting act : men, women and children were involved in the
</p>
<p>common massacre. Did any show signs of life a dozen rifles
</p>
<p>and tomahawks were made to do service on the helpless vic-
</p>
<p>tim. Not one was spared ; the spot which, a few moments be-
</p>
<p>fore, was their friendly shelter, became the altar of their sacri-
</p>
<p>fice.
</p>
<p>So quickly was the deed consummated that the alarm could ,
</p>
<p>not be given in season to arrest the perpetrators : they were on
</p>
<p>their horses, flying out of town before the people were
</p>
<p>aware of what had transpired. The chief magistrate, Edward

<p>Shippen, and most of the leading citizens, were at church cel-
</p>
<p>ebrating a Christmas service, which had been deferred
</p>
<p>from the previous day. In the midst of the sei*vice a man

<p>burst open the door and shouted " murder  jail  Paxton men

</p>
<p>/Indians ! " The audience ruslied tumultuouslj fortli and
</p>
<p>from the house of worship passed into the presence of death 
</p>
<p>death in its most horrible aspects. There lay the victims,
</p>
<p>scattered around through all parts of the yard, mangled shock-
</p>
<p>ingly, heads blown to pieces, bodies pierced, limbs lacerated 
</p>
<p>the work of men professing to be Christian, It was a sight
</p>
<p>from which all turned in horror. A decent burial was given
</p>
<p>the remains, outside the town limits, where the bones were
</p>
<p>permitted to remain until eighty years afterwards, when a rail-
</p>
<p>way excavation first disturbed their repose.
</p>
<p>This shocking butchery sent a wild thrill of horror to the
</p>
<p>bosoms of the Quakers in the province. Their indignation
</p>
<p>found vent in a wholesale denunciation of the murderers and
</p>
<p>their alleged friends, the Presbyterians, who, it was asserted,
</p>
<p>defended the two murderous expeditions by citations from
</p>
<p>scripture.^ This inculpation soon heightened the wrath long
</p>
<p>existing between the two sects, and fi-om that hour for many
</p>
<p>years they became as irreconcileable as two positive poles of a
</p>
<p>voltaic battery. Governor Penn issued a second proclamation,
</p>
<p>offering what was then deemed to be heavy rewards for the
</p>
<p>detection and arrest of the murderers ; but none were arrested,
</p>
<p>though no concealments of their share in the butchery were
</p>
<p>practiced by those who did the deed : they rather boasted of
</p>
<p>their act as one of proper retributive and religious justice. No
</p>
<p>'arrest could have been made except by a heavy force of mili-
</p>
<p>tary ; but no such force was available. Indeed, it is presumed
</p>
<p>that, feeling, as all soldiers then did, a deadly hatred of the en-
</p>
<p>tii-e Indian race, they would not have acted as a posse comitatus
</p>
<p>to hunt the hardy Paxtonians.
</p>
<p>There was, however, but brief respite for enforcing legal
</p>
<p>processes. Successful in exterminating the Cones toga vaga-
</p>
<p>bonds, the Paxton men were emboldened to conceive them-
</p>
<p>selves constituted ministers of vengeance, and, in the plenitude
</p>
<p>of their assurance, they resolved to finish the Moravian Indians

<p> thus to save the peaceful missionaries all trouble of civilizing
</p>
<p>the barbarians. To this precious project of wholesale butch-

<p>defense of their act.

<p>cry it is true that a majority of border men lent a -willing ear,
</p>
<p>moved by their irreconcileable bate of the Indian, their disgust
</p>
<p>of the non-combatant Quakers, and their indignation toward a
</p>
<p>General Assembly which appropriated public money to sup-
</p>
<p>port missions, yet offered a beggarly assistance to those strug-
</p>
<p>gling against the horrors of savage visitation on the fi'ontier.*
</p>
<p>In the Assembly were only ten representatives from the five
</p>
<p>counties of Lancaster, York, Cumberland, Berks and North-
</p>
<p>ampton, while the counties of Philadelphia, Chester and Bucks
</p>
<p>had twenty-six members  the majority of whom were Quakers.
</p>
<p>As the counties first named were settled chiefly by Irish and
</p>
<p>Scotch Presbyterians, their minority in the Chamber placed
</p>
<p>them and their prosperity quite at the mercy of the drab coat-
</p>
<p>ed, broad brimmed majority. In consequence, the wrath of
</p>
<p>the frontier men waxed strong in proportion to the wrong con-
</p>
<p>ceived to have been done by the Quakers,
</p>
<p>The Moravian Indians, two months prior to the Conestoga
</p>
<p>affair, had been so threatened by the border men that their mis-
</p>
<p>sionaries had been impelled to consolidate their three commu
</p>
<p>nities and to remove to a place of safety. Nazareth was first
</p>
<p>chosen ; but, from thence, owing to the continual public ex-
</p>
<p>citement, the General Assembly ordered their removal to some
</p>
<p>spot near Philadelphia where, being entirely disarmed, it would
</p>
<p>be out of their power to do harm. Gathered for their exile
</p>
<p>they numbered about one hundred and forty, of all ages and
</p>
<p>conditions. Everywhere along the route to Philadelphia they
</p>
<p>were received with jeers and threats by all except the Quakers,
</p>
<p>who stood firm as friends to the forlorn band. Peaching the
</p>
<p>capital excitement ran so high that their destruction seemed
</p>
<p>inevitable. Quarters had been assigned them in the barracks,
</p>
<p> In the Memorial afterwards addressed to the Governor and General Assembly,
</p>
<p>by Matthew Smith and James Gibson, the grievances of the frontier men were set
</p>
<p>forth at some length. Nine specifications were offered of wrongs and inflictions
</p>
<p>nnder which they suffered. The points taken appear to have been well grounded

<p>in fact. The Memorial discloses the purpose of the " rioters" to have been of a
</p>
<p>somewhat revolutionary character. The Moravian Indians were to be disposed of,
</p>
<p>but that was only a redress of one of nine disabilities alleged to exist  all of which
</p>
<p>the *' Paxton boys" were bound to " wipe out." Their movement, therefore, on

<p>bj order of tlie Governor ; but the soldiers of tbe station posi-
</p>
<p>tively refused to receive their detested guests. All day long
</p>
<p>the Indians stood out on the square in front of the barracks ;
</p>
<p>and no command of Governor or officer could open the doors
</p>
<p>of the buildings. Only the presence of a large number of
</p>
<p>Quakers, many of them persons of influence, prevented the
</p>
<p>mob from violence toward the thoroughly frightened exiles.
</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon it was arranged to send the Indians
</p>
<p>down to Province island, where temporary protection could be
</p>
<p>offered them ; and thither they proceeded, followed by the in-
</p>
<p>furiated mob, but protected by a strong body of Quakers.
</p>
<p>Once quartered on the island they remained in comparative
</p>
<p>security, cared for by the benevolent. It was thought all dan-
</p>
<p>ger and suffering were past But, the awful tragedy at Lan-
</p>
<p>caster jail stirred the fires anew. The alarm spread to Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia and the terrible Paxton men were reported to be en
</p>
<p>route for Province Island, resolved upon the murder of every
</p>
<p>red-skin there. A number of boats were sent down to the
</p>
<p>island and every Indian was embarked, to be borne further
</p>
<p>down the river. That alarm was groundless, and the tremb-
</p>
<p>ling creatures were restored to their quarters only to be soon
</p>
<p>turned out again. This time they were, agreeable to orders
</p>

<p>ing off the unoffending Moravian converts to another province,
</p>
<p>capped the climax of their absurd timidity. The poor victims,
</p>
<p>starting at midnight, January 4:th, 1764, were marched over
</p>
<p>New Jersey, everywhere to receive nothing but insults at the

<p>Lands of the people  so general was tlie tate of the red race.
</p>
<p>Arriving at Amboy, after a weary tramp by way of Trenton,
</p>
<p>the agents of Pennsylvania were astonished to receive from
</p>
<p>Governor Golden, of New York, a message forbidding the In-
</p>
<p>dians to step foot on his tenitory. Other orders from General
</p>
<p>Gage and the New York city aiithorities, arrested all further
</p>
<p>progress ; once more the exiles were without a resting place.
</p>
<p>A messenger soon came from Governor Franklin, of New Jer-
</p>
<p>sey, ordering the Indians from his territory. Under an escort
</p>
<p>of one hundi-ed and seventy troops, dispatched by General
</p>
<p>Gage to the assistance of Governor Penn against the rioters,
</p>
<p>the men, women and children returned to Philadelphia. Their
</p>
<p>ill usage and a sense of danger from the border men had work-
</p>
<p>ed a change in the soldiers' hearts toward the helpless band,
</p>
<p>and they were given quarters in the city barracks.
</p>
<p>The moment was one of great excitement, for the Paxton
</p>
<p>men were, in truth, advancing upon the city. Seeing that
</p>
<p>there was no other way to avert the danger than boldly to
</p>
<p>confront it  to match rifle with rifle and swofd with tomahawk,
</p>
<p>the Quakers made a virtue of necessity and became as combat-
</p>
<p>ant as the most devoted martinet could have desired. The
</p>
<p>Assembly voted arms and supplies ; it proclaimed the English
</p>
<p>riot act and no longer had any qualms of conscience about the
</p>
<p>proper use of powder and ball. Benjamin Franklin moved
</p>
<p>his fellow -citizens, the animating genius of the crisis. He then
</p>
<p>betrayed that sagacity, prudence, indomitable will and true
</p>
<p>courage which afterwards made him one of the safest guides
</p>
<p>through the stormy period of the Eevolution.
</p>
<p>The Paxton men, under command of Matthew Smith, James
</p>
<p>Gibson and others, after gathering from their several rendez-
</p>
<p>vous, started for Philadelphia about the first of February, in-
</p>
<p>creasing in numbers as they progressed, until nearly or quite

<p>one thousand men composed the motly mob. Their advance

<p>appeared at Germantown February 4th, and the alarm was at

<p>once given in the city. The bells rang and citizens flocked to

<p>The troops sent by Gage, and a small body of Highlanders,

</p>
<p>no invasion of the city limits followed. All night long, in a
</p>
<p>drenching rain, the citizens stood under arms, alert for an at-
</p>
<p>tack expected at any moment. The following day (Sunday) a
</p>
<p>banicade was thrown across the square before the barracks,
</p>
<p>upon which were mounted a number of cannon, so disposed
</p>
<p>as to sweep all approaches. The city fairly swarmed with
</p>
<p>men in arms  conspicuous among whom were drab coats and
</p>
<p>broad brimmed hats. Spies from the border men circulated
</p>
<p>freely throughout the place, to report the belligerent state of
</p>
<p>affairs to their somewhat surprised brother cut-throats ; they
</p>
<p>had not expected such a reception at the hands of the Quakera
</p>
<p>Nothing occurred during the Sabbath to cause farther alarm-
</p>
<p>Still preferring the use of the tongue to the sword, the citizens
</p>
<p>dispatched a squad of clergymen to the Paxtonians, hoping to
</p>
<p>prove that it was not their duty to butcher the heathen, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to command in Deuteronomy. This mission the
</p>
<p>ministers do not appear to have executed with commendable
</p>
<p>zeal, since Matthew Smith, that night, seized Swedes Ford, over
</p>
<p>the Schuylkill, preparatory to a march upon the city. But no
</p>
<p>advance was made. Eeady as the Paxton men were to cut the
</p>
<p>throats of one hundred and forty bronze men, women and
</p>
<p>children, they were not prepared to face the music of twelve
</p>
<p>cannon and two thousand muskets. So they remained quietly
</p>
<p>at Germantown, and, during Monday, were visited by a num-
</p>
<p>ber of the more adventurous citizens. An unexpected change
</p>
<p>had come over the spirit of the border men's dreams. Though
</p>
<p>"clad in blanket coats and moccasins," and "armed with rifles
</p>
<p>and tomahawks and some with pistols stuck in their belts,"
</p>
<p>they were as non-combative as disciples of George Fox. No
</p>
<p>violence was offered, and numbers of those who had volun-
</p>
<p>teered to bring the Quakers to terms, returned home to consid-
</p>
<p>er matters. This peaceable attitude induced the authorities to

<p>a trial of negotiation, much against the desires of the regulars
</p>
<p>and of the citizens in arms, who seemed to prefer the bayonet
</p>
<p>for an arbiter in suppressing such an insurrection. The voice
</p>
<p>of the elders prevailed, and Franklin, with three other eminent
</p>
<p>PRESBYTERIAN VS. QUAKER. 113
</p>
<p>citizens, souglit the Paxton camp. His negotiations ended
</p>
<p>satisfactorily, assurances having been given of a redress of
</p>
<p>grievances, as well as safety being guaranteed to those of the
</p>
<p>Paxton men who might enter the city as deputies. Matthew
</p>
<p>Smith and John Gibson were chosen by their men to repre-
</p>
<p>sent their cause. They at once di'ew up two papers, a Eemon-
</p>
<p>strance and a Declaration of Grievances the latter of which
</p>
<p>is referred to in foot note page 109  which the Governor was
</p>
<p>to lay before the Assembly. Upon this settlement of the af-
</p>
<p>fair the citizen-soldiers were dismissed and quiet was restored.
</p>
<p>On the succeeding day thirty of the frontier men entered the
</p>
<p>city much to the alarm of its people, who again swarmed into
</p>
<p>the streets with arms in their hands : but the thirty were on a
</p>
<p>peaceful mission of observation and to boast of their exploits
</p>
<p>in having participated in the Conestoga and Lancaster murders.
</p>
<p>The act was one of singular bravado considering the fact that
</p>
<p>rewards were then out for their arrest ; but, none of all that
</p>
<p>city of brave men were presumptuous enough to hiy hands on
</p>
<p>the desperate fellows. They visited the barracks to identify
</p>
<p>Indians whom they swore they had seen in arms against the
</p>
<p>settlers and who had fought against Colonel Bouquet ; but
</p>
<p>none were recognised. The Paxton men soon withdrew ; Ger-
</p>
<p>mantown was relieved of their thieving and riotous presence ;
</p>
<p>only Smith and Gibson remained in Philadelphia to care for
</p>
<p>the interests of their constituents before the Assembly.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the " Paxton Eiots" ; but there followed a war
</p>
<p>of words which, for a season, so absorbed all classes as to ren-
</p>
<p>der them oblivious to the original cause of the disturbance.
</p>
<p>Quaker was pitted against Presbyterian. Argument and ap-
</p>
<p>peal soon gave place to threat and invective. Pamphlets, sat-
</p>
<p>ires, poems, letters, addresses, communications, flew around as
</p>
<p>thickly as snow flakes. Everybody seemed to be drawn into
</p>
<p>the vortex of passion. Friends became enemies  enemies,
</p>
<p>friends. The "subject" invaded the precincts of the pulpit,

<p>hours at jean garments ; painters stopped daubing houses to
</p>
<p>daub their enemies' character and prospects ; lawyers forgot
</p>
<p>their briefs in lengthy tirade, against some equally wordy an-
</p>
<p>tagonist. Preachers " pitched into" one another like experts
</p>
<p>from a Donnybrook fair. It was a veritable reign of reason
</p>
<p>run mad ; and stands on the page of history as an illustration
</p>
<p>of the folly and the weakness of human nature.
</p>
<p>Nothing came of the labors of Smith and Gibson to secure
</p>
<p>more equality in representation, to obtain guarantees of pro-
</p>
<p>tection for the borders, to compel a change of policy toward
</p>
<p>friendly Indians, and to secure immunity from trial for those
</p>
<p>engaged in the Conestoga massacre. The warlike attitude of
</p>
<p>affairs, by which even the interior was threatened with the
</p>
<p>tomahawk of blood-thu'sty demons compelled the Assem-
</p>
<p>bly to vote troops and supplies ; but no concessions were made
</p>
<p>to the Paxton men, and they remained under the ban of the
</p>
<p>law through their lives. No arrests, singularly enough, were
</p>
<p>made, save that of Lazarus Stewart, eight years after the Lan-
</p>
<p>caster jail tragedy, when he was placed in confinement in the
</p>
<p>same building where the unhappy Indians had sought safety.
</p>
<p>To insure conviction the Quakers had arranged to transfer his
</p>
<p>trial to Philadelphia, This attempt to force him from Lancas-
</p>
<p>ter  where Stewart, it would appear, was quite willing to be
</p>
<p>tried  impelled him to break jail and escape. At Paxton he
</p>
<p>rallied a band of resolute fellows who set the officers of the law
</p>
<p>at defiance. He issued an address of justification to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, setting forth his services and the justice of his acts. With
</p>
<p>his followers he retired to Wyoming, in whose tragic history
</p>
<p>his name and those of his brave rangers mingle in honorable
</p>
<p>connection. The Moravian Indians remained in Philadelphia
</p>
<p>during the Indian war, supported by appropriations from the
</p>
<p>public treasury and by contributions. In the year 1765 they
</p>
<p>were removed to the Susquehanna, not far from their old set-

<p>THE CONSPIRACY OF BENEDICT AMOLD.
</p>
<p>" Forever be his name accursed of men, and his crime be
</p>
<p>the associate of his memory ! " was the malediction which fol-
</p>
<p>lowed the traitor after the exposure of his stupendous villany.
</p>
<p>The story of Arnold's treason is, to American readers, fii-
</p>
<p>miliar as a household word ; yet, like the narrative of Guy
</p>
<p>Fawkes' attempt to blow up the English Parliament, it has a
</p>
<p>perennial interest, not only because of its momentous nature
</p>
<p>as a conspiracy against the cause of the Colonies, but also from
</p>
<p>the drama which followed involving the fate of Andre. We
</p>
<p>consider it, in tliis volume, simply in the light of a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>leaving to historians and to romance that detail of collateral
</p>
<p>and incidental events which serve more as embellishments to,
</p>
<p>than as adjuncts of, the attempted betrayal of "West Point.
</p>
<p>Arnold, throughout the Revolutionary War, up to 1780,
</p>
<p>had acted both an honorable and a dishonorable part. His
</p>
<p>character was turbulent ; his temper quick ; his pride imperi-
</p>
<p>ous ; his principles bad ; his integrity doubted. He fought
</p>
<p>well but acted ill ; he was courageous to an astonishing degree
</p>
<p>but unreliable, jealous, quarrelsome and captious. He fought
</p>
<p>for glory from no higher motive than the love of adulation and
</p>
<p>power ; he was not sound at heart. To such a nature, thwart-
</p>
<p>ed in its hopes of advancement, or distempered by wrongs real
</p>
<p>and imaginary, treason was not a crime  it was simply an in-
</p>
<p>strument of revenge. It needed but the pretext for him to
</p>
<p>commit and excuse the commission of a hideous act ; and we
</p>
<p>much doubt if, in the whole course of his after life, the traitor
</p>
<p>ever felt any compunctions of conscience for the course he had

<p>pm-suecl toward liis coimtiy. Sucli men exist in all commu-
</p>
<p>nities ; they need only favoring circumstances to strip them of
</p>
<p>their disguise and to show them as they are  purely selfish
</p>
<p>and unprincipled. It is not strange that Arnold should have
</p>
<p>appeared on the stage at the proper time and place to give his
</p>
<p>name to eternal infamy ; it is, rather, strange that he should
</p>
<p>stand quite alone  that, out of that great contest for human
</p>
<p>liberty, so few should have proved recreant to trust and
</p>
<p>corruptible. Many were disloyal among the people, and not a
</p>
<p>few engaged in the contest were lukewarm in the cause ;  but,
</p>
<p>to Arnold alone attaches the dishonor of an American officer
</p>
<p>of high command endeavoring to sell his birthright and to be-
</p>
<p>tray his country.' "Washington said : " Arnold's conduct is so
</p>
<p>villainously perfidious that there are no terms that can describe
</p>
<p>the baseness of his heart." He also said: " He wants feeling.
</p>
<p>From some traits of his character which have lately come to
</p>
<p>my knowledge, he seems to have been so hackneyed in villai-
</p>
<p>ny, and so lost to all sense of honor and shame, that, while his
</p>
<p>faculties will enable him to continue his sordid pursuit, there
</p>
<p>will be no time for remorse." A severity of judgment which
</p>
<p>time has not failed to confirm. Sabine, in his American Loy-
</p>
<p>alist says : " I am inclined to believe that Arnold was a finish-
</p>
<p>ed scoundrel from early manhood to his grave. Nor do I be-
</p>
<p>lieve he had any real, true-hearted attachment to the Whig
</p>
<p>cause. He fought as a mere adventurer, and took sides from
</p>
<p>a calculation of personal gain and chances of plunder and ad-
</p>
<p>1 The case of Major-General Charles Lee is, by many writers, assumed to be
</p>
<p>somewhat analagous to that of Arnold ; but, we are not prepared to impute to him
</p>
<p>the crimes charged to his memory. His devotion to the American cause was, like
</p>
<p>that of many other oflScers and statesmen high in position, governed much by his
</p>
<p>ambition. He conceived the daring design of superceding Washington, for whom
</p>
<p>he entertained no regard, and whose military abilities he conceived to be overesti-
</p>
<p>mated. He caballed against him, and fought badly at Monmouth in order to pro-
</p>
<p>cure defeat that Washington might be the sufferer. For this conduct he was

<p>court martialed and driven into exile in Virginia; but, it is not yet prove?i that he
</p>
<p>deliberately plotted to betray the army or to sell his adopted country  for he was
</p>
<p>an Englishman by birth, education and association, having arrived in America only
</p>
<p>two years previous to the events of 1775. His crime was that of all the faction

<p>who, under the leadership of Conway, endeavored to ruin Washington.

</p>
<p>vancement" This was written witli all tlie weight of testimo-
</p>
<p>ny which sixty years had produced.
</p>
<p>At the second memorable battle of Saratoga, October 7th,
</p>
<p>1777, Arnold's leg was broken, and he was incapacitated for
</p>
<p>service for several months. He joined Washington at Valley
</p>
<p>Forge in May, 1778, and was present at the entrance of the
</p>
<p>Continental army into Philadelphia, June 17th, 1778. Wash-
</p>
<p>ington placed Arnold in command as military Governor  a
</p>
<p>remarkable trust when we consider Washington's prudence
</p>
<p>and sagacity and Arnold's well known character for rashness,
</p>
<p>insubordination, cruelty and dissoluteness. Of all places
</p>
<p>Philadelphia then required a wise, discreet, humane govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and of all men Arnold was the worst agent who could
</p>
<p>have been chosen. It is true Arnold was to act under specific
</p>
<p>instructions, enforcing the executive resolves of Congress, re-
</p>
<p>specting the civil rights of the State and the municipality, and
</p>
<p>executing the wishes of Washington ; but, what were orders
</p>
<p>and wishes to him ? Three days after he took command he
</p>
<p>entered into a secret copartnership for the purchase and sale
</p>
<p>of goods, by which he at once controlled trade, and, obtaining
</p>
<p>extraordinary prices, soon realized a large revenue out of the
</p>
<p>necessities of the peo|)le. He set the municipal and State au-
</p>
<p>thorities at defiance, espousing, in a local quarrel, the cause of
</p>
<p>those notoriously disloyal  an alliance designed to further his
</p>
<p>schemes of rapacity. He, ere long, wooed and won the daugh-
</p>
<p>ter of a wealthy loyalist, Edward Shippen  she a beauty of
</p>
<p>eighteen, he a widower of forty. Margaret Shippen was gay,
</p>
<p>witty, accomplished, a fashionable flirt; her suitor was low-
</p>
<p>born, rude, vicious in his propensities : by what means or in-
</p>
<p>fluences the engagement was effected we are only left to con-
</p>
<p>jecture. The intrigue and duplicity which afterward came near
</p>
<p>to success in betraying his post certainly were equal to the
</p>
<p>task of catching a belle. His style of living was truly magni-
</p>
<p>ficent for those days : his establishment was almost royal in its

</p>
<p>enormous expenditures which even his speculations could not

<p>support. But, long before he could call Margaret his bride and

</p>
<p>doors were besieged by importunate creditors. The choice of
</p>
<p>General Joseph Eeed to the Presidency of the Executive Couf-
</p>
<p>cil of Pennsylvania, brought matters to a crisis. He was not
</p>
<p>disposed to see the course and acts of the military Governor
</p>
<p>of Philadelphia covered up by Arnold's fame, and by the pow-
</p>
<p>erful faction which stood forth in the Governor's support.
</p>
<p>We need not here narrate in detail the investigations which
</p>
<p>followed : results will suffice for our purposes. Arnold was
</p>
<p>finally, after great delays, convicted, before a military tribunal,
</p>
<p>on two comparatively minor specifications and sentenced to be
</p>
<p>reprimanded by the Commander-in-Chief  a sentence confirm-
</p>
<p>ed by Congress February 12th, 1780, and soon executed by
</p>
<p>Washington, with remarkable good taste and kindliness. The
</p>
<p>charges first preferred by Eeed were of a character to over-
</p>
<p>whelm Arnold with disgrace, but they were rejected by Con-
</p>
<p>gress, in the report of a special conmiittee, March, 1780. A
</p>
<p>very thorough examination had been given the matter, and an
</p>
<p>acquittal at the hands of the committee would seem to argue
</p>
<p>that, whatever may have been his sins, they were not such as
</p>
<p>to deprive him of the confidence of Congress or of Washington.
</p>
<p>Five days after this acquittal he was mamed to Miss Shippen
</p>
<p> having first resigned the military Governorship. But the
</p>
<p>report was not called up for discussion, and the whole matter,
</p>
<p>without further consideration, was referred anew to a joint
</p>
<p>committee of the Assembly and Council of Pennsylvania and
</p>
<p>of Congress. The report of this committee was soon ready.
</p>
<p>It was considered at length, eliciting much warmth of discus-
</p>
<p>sion and was finally disposed of by resolving that Washington
</p>
<p>should convene a court martial for the military trial of such
</p>
<p>charges as were of a nature to be cognizable by such a court.'
</p>
<p>* Hamilton, in his " History of the Republic," thus construes this matter: " In
</p>
<p>the exercise of an invidious duty thus confided to him, Arnold incurred great dis-
</p>
<p>pleasure. The Government of the State interposed. Charges were made of an
</p>
<p>abuse of his powers, and civil prosecutions were threatened. A sharp controversy

</p>
<p>ensued and an appeal was preferred to Congress. The result was a vindication of
</p>
<p>Arnold from criminal conduct. Upon a statement that the full testimony had not
</p>
<p>been produced, Congress, in concert with the authorities of Pennsylvania, decided
</p>
<p>to submit to a court martial such charges as were cognizable by a military tribu-
</p>
<p>nal. This procedure Arnold charged to be the act of Reed, the President of the
</p>
<p>Stat, and was supposed to have produced his ultimate criminality."

<p>This court the Commander-in-Cliief appointed to meet May

<p>the beginning of 1780, when it resulted as above stated, in a
</p>
<p>verdict of reprimand.
</p>
<p>Having resigned his command in Philadelphia, Arnold was
</p>
<p>without employ, but his restless spirit had not been in repose.
</p>
<p>It was in the fall of 1779 that he conceived the design of pass-
</p>
<p>ing over to the enemy. By means of a disloyal preacher in
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, named Odell, he found means of communicating
</p>
<p>with Sir Henry Clinton, then holding New York. Clinton
</p>
<p>turned the matter over to John Andre, his Adjutant General,
</p>
<p>who at once set himself about discovering who the volunteer
</p>
<p>correspondent was. He was not long in identifjdng his man.
</p>
<p>During the winter several letters passed, but none of a nature
</p>
<p>looking to definite results. Commercial terms were used as a
</p>
<p>disguise. Arnold was "Gustavus," and Andre "John Ander-
</p>
<p>son." After the reprimand the leaven of treason worked more
</p>
<p>rapidly in Arnold's heart. His indignation at the usage meted
</p>
<p>out by Congress and by the Pennsylvania authorities, his ex-
</p>
<p>ceedingly straitened circumstances, his inability to obtain from
</p>
<p>Congress an allowance of his claims for expenses incurred, all
</p>
<p>contributed to turn his thoughts more directly to the British
</p>
<p>for aid and honors. Having married Miss Shippen, through
</p>
<p>her he could communicate with Andre without suspicion, since
</p>
<p>she was an old friend and confidant of the gay adjutant. But,
</p>
<p>he still proceeded with excessive caution. The commercial
</p>
<p>parlance used offered a perfect cloak from detection. " Invoic-
</p>
<p>es," "adventures," "sums needed," "disbursement," "debt
</p>
<p>and credit," were convenient terms to cover the contemplated
</p>
<p>sale of a soul to the devil and of body to Sir Henry Clinton.
</p>
<p>Goaded by his wants Arnold, in his extremity, appealed for
</p>
<p>aid to M. de Luzerne, French Minister to the Eevolutionary
</p>
<p>Government. It was, evidently, his last bid for fiivor and
</p>
<p>help. With strong words he pictured to the Minister the hard-

</p>
<p>and slights, the injustice of keeping back payment of his claims,
</p>
<p>the damage sustained by the sacrifices he had made for his

<p>abandoning the service, unless he conid then obtain a loan
</p>
<p>sufficient to clear him from the burden of his debts. This loan
</p>
<p>he represented it must be for the interest of the French Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment to extend, thus securing to the cause of France and
</p>
<p>the American Colonies his continued services. This bold bid
</p>
<p>for a purchase of his loyalty to his country the Frenchman re-
</p>
<p>jected as incompatible with personal honor or public prosperi-
</p>
<p>ty. He said :
</p>
<p>" Wben the envoy of a foreign power gives, or, if you please, lends
</p>
<p>money, it is ordinarily to corrupt those who receive it, and to make them
</p>
<p>the a-eatures of the sovereign whom he serves. Or, rather, he corrupts
</p>
<p>without persuading; he buys yet does not secure. But, the league en-
</p>
<p>tered into between the King and the United States is the work of justice
</p>
<p>and of the wisest jjolicy. It has for its basis a reciprocal interest and
</p>
<p>good will. In the mission with which I am charged, my true glory
</p>
<p>consists in fulfilling it without intrigue or cabal ; without resorting to
</p>
<p>any secret practices and by the force alone of the conditions of the alli-
</p>
<p>ance."
</p>
<p>It is assumed by some writers who have sought to relieve
</p>
<p>Arnold's name from some of its load of obloquy, that he, in
</p>
<p>good faith, sought this aid in order to save him from the ne-
</p>
<p>cessity of accepting British gold ; but, all the evidence afford-
</p>
<p>ed by his subsequent career goes to prove that, had he obtain-
</p>
<p>ed it, the " arrangement" with Andr6 would have been con-
</p>
<p>summated. For several months the coiTespondence regarding
</p>
<p>his " commercial venture" had been going on, and Arnold had
</p>
<p>fully committed himself to treason. His desire to obtain the
</p>
<p>money was to enable him to pay off his debts, and, by a good
</p>
<p>use of his gold and his influence, to secure such a command as
</p>
<p>would render his defection, at the proper moment, most ca-
</p>
<p>lamitous to the American cause and most worthy of a rich
</p>
<p>reward from the British Government. But he failed, and was
</p>
<p>left for a season to the importunities of creditors and the cold

<p>consideration generally awarded to all claimants by Congress-

<p>His plans matured rapidly. Washington having been in-

<p>vested with dictatorial powers, with an advisory council of
</p>
<p>three, and news of French aid soon to arrive having been re-
</p>
<p>ceived, active operations promised for the summer. This

</p>
<p>called tlie various commanders to duty. Arnold wrote to
</p>
<p>General Schuyler, one of the three advisers who was about to
</p>
<p>join Washington, that he desired to return to the service but
</p>
<p>would be precluded from active duty owing to his wounds
</p>
<p>which, he said, were yet jjainful. He intimated the wish to be
</p>
<p>assigned to West Point, clearly foreseeing that, in event of a
</p>
<p>combined French and American attack upon ISTew York, West
</p>
<p>Point would prove the key to the campaign: its betrayal
</p>
<p>would quite destroy the Patriot programme for the summer if
</p>
<p>not entirely ruin the American cause. It was the prize to be
</p>
<p>sought for, and, with the cool calculation of an adept in vil-
</p>
<p>lainy, Arnold laid his plans to gain possession of the post.
</p>
<p>Schuyler replied (June 2d) to Arnold's note, after having
</p>
<p>conferred with Washington, saying in substance that the Com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-Chief regarded the application for service with much
</p>
<p>pleasure and would give it proper consideration in his arrange-
</p>
<p>ments for the campaign. This reply did not guarantee West
</p>
<p>Point ; hence Arnold set influences to work to have that as-
</p>
<p>signment made. His partizans in and out of Congress were
</p>
<p>numerous and powerful, but it would not do for the Conspira-
</p>
<p>tor to press his point too urgently  it might excite opposition
</p>
<p>in others quite anxious for the important command. Eobert
</p>
<p>R Livingston wrote for the post for Arnold, urging his wounds
</p>
<p>and his fitness for such a service as the strong points to be
</p>
<p>considered. Nothing was done, however. Washington never
</p>
<p>yielded to any suggestion except u|)on its merits ; and the ap-
</p>
<p>plication remained unanswered until the campaign was fairly
</p>
<p>inaugurated in July.
</p>
<p>Washington having moved his little army of four thousand
</p>
<p>men from Morristown, New Jersey, up to the Hu.dson, had
</p>
<p>concerted an attack on New York  the French fleet under the
</p>
<p>Chevalier de Ternay and the French army under Count de
</p>

<p>gave Sir Henry Clinton such reenforcements as rendered the

<p>proposed combined operations impracticable, and the French

<p>and American commanders resolved to await reenforcements

</p>
<p>ton was fully informed  by what means is not known. He
</p>
<p>therefore planned a counter- expedition against the French,
</p>
<p>then at Newport, Khode Island. His plan was to march
</p>
<p>six thousand men to Throg's Neck, on the Sound, from
</p>
<p>whence, transports having been provided by Admiral Arbuth
</p>
<p>not, the descent was to be made on Newport, Arbuthnot's fleet
</p>
<p>co-operating. Of this move Washington soon obtained infor-
</p>
<p>mation, when he at once threw his now increased force over
</p>
<p>tke Hudson at Peekskill, preparatory to moving down by
</p>
<p>way of King's Bridge. In the midst of these stirring prepara-
</p>
<p>tions Arnold appeared. He addressed Washington to know
</p>
<p>what place had been assigned to him. The Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Chief replied that he had resolved to place him in command
</p>
<p>of the left wing.' Arnold was silent, and, by his acts, express-
</p>
<p>ed chagrin. All who witnessed the scene were surprised at his
</p>
<p>evident dissatisfaction  it being supposed that such a field of
</p>
<p>duty would have best pleased his daring and restless spirit.
</p>
<p>Further conference at headquarters resulted in Arnold's choice
</p>
<p>to the command of West Point "and its dependencies." What
</p>
<p>mfluences were brought to bear by the Conspirator to obtain
</p>
<p>the post we are not informed. Eobert Livingston, as we have
</p>
<p>remarked, had urged Arnold for the place ; Hamilton, in his
</p>
<p>"History of the Eepublic," states that Schuyler "concurred";
</p>
<p>while we can well understand that the leg wounded at Sarato-
</p>
<p>ga was a most powerful intercessor. The command assigned
</p>
<p>included West Point and the posts from Fishkill to King's
</p>
<p>Ferry, together with the forces  infantry and cavalry  then
</p>
<p>holding the east side of the Hudson river. Washington's ad-
</p>
<p>vance upon New York was frustrated by Sir Henry Clinton's
</p>
<p>abandonment of his expedition against Newport after his march
</p>
<p>to Throg's Neck ; and the bulk of the American army was
</p>
<p>withdrawn, by Dobbs' Ferry, to the west of the Hudson river,
</p>
<p>there to await any movements of the British, or the concert of
</p>
<p>operations with their allies which Washington strove, at once,

<p>' Hamilton, ia his " History of the Republic," gives the impression (vol. ii. page
</p>
<p>62) that Arnold was assigned to the left wing command soon after his reprimand.
</p>
<p>He received no intimations from Washington until the occasion above stated. See

<p>Irving's Washington, vol. iv. page 81.

</p>
<p>to effect. Arnold's force therefore consisted of tlie men man
</p>
<p>ning the forts and redoubts surmounting the heiglits and a
</p>
<p>body of about six hundred infantry and two hundred cavalry
</p>
<p>posted on the eastern side of the river on outpost, scout and
</p>
<p>skirmish duty.
</p>
<p>The fortifications of West Point comprised, at that time, a
</p>
<p>fort on the north-east face of the plateau, while west of it and
</p>
<p>surmounting the heights beyond was Fort Putnam  a very
</p>
<p>powerful and well conceived redoubt. Both of these works,
</p>
<p>however, were very illy equipped and ordered  so rnuch so,
</p>
<p>that, in a report made by an engineer, ten days after Arnold
</p>
<p>took possession, it was said : " the whole appears, at present,
</p>
<p>under the care of ungovernable and undisciplined militia, like
</p>
<p>a wild Tartar's camp, instead of that shining fortification all
</p>
<p>America thinks not only an insurmountable barrier against
</p>
<p>the incursion of the enemy, but likewise an easy defense in
</p>
<p>case of an unforeseen disaster to its army." This picture must
</p>
<p>have been a sad one for Washington to contemplate, and
</p>
<p>doubtless offers one reason for his placing Arnold there : he
</p>
<p>hoped that that officer's well known character for sternness
</p>
<p>would at least reduce all to order and efftciency. In the cam-
</p>
<p>paign then pending it was all important that West Point
</p>
<p>should be ready for stern duty, for it would, in. event of any
</p>
<p>reverse to the American arms, have been instantly assailed by
</p>
<p>the British Commander-in-Chief It was the barrier against
</p>
<p>British communication with Canada, while it kept open the
</p>
<p>direct route of passage for the Americans from tha New Eng-
</p>
<p>land States to the South. If, therefore, it were lost, a terrible
</p>
<p>(juf blow wo^ld be given to the Patriot cause  then at its lowest
</p>
<p>point of discouragement. That Arnold chose it and that par-
</p>
<p>ticular moment for the consummation of his scheme, proves
</p>
<p>him to have sought the entire ruin of his country and its sub-
</p>
<p>jugation to the foreign yoke.

<p>dated August 3d, 1780. His instructions were to hasten the

<p>and to use every measure of precaution to prevent surprise or

</p>
<p>quarters were at Tappan, on the Jersey side of the river.
</p>
<p>All that Arnold did was done under the eye of his chief.
</p>
<p>He, therefoi-e, had to proceed with extreme caution ; the saga-
</p>
<p>cious instincts of the Commander-in-Chief were never asleep.
</p>
<p>Arnold proceeded to the eastern bank of the river, taking up
</p>
<p>headquarters at Eobinson's House  a fine mansion located on
</p>
<p>a rich plateau nearly opposite West Point, It was the confis-
</p>
<p>cated property of Colonel Beverly Robinson, then in Clinton's
</p>
<p>service, and a coadjutor of Andrd in forwarding the game of
</p>
<p>treason.
</p>
<p>Washington, eager to fall upon New York, held much cor-
</p>
<p>respondence with the French, who still remained inactive at
</p>
<p>Newport. Nothing definite was determined upon during Au-
</p>
<p>gust  the French being disconcerted by the non-arrival of the
</p>
<p>second division of their army of co-operation, which the British,
</p>
<p>with admirable zeal, had blockaded in the port of Brest,
</p>
<p>France, thus preventing its departure. Rochambeau also was
</p>
<p>disappointed by the non-arrival of Count de Guichen, with his
</p>
<p>West India squadron^  a reenforcement necessary as a coun-
</p>
<p>terpoise to Arbuthnot's fleet, then sustaining Clinton. The
</p>
<p>Patriot Commander-in-Chief, as his published papers show,
</p>
<p>was exceedingly anxious in regard to the loss of time, yet he
</p>
<p>could do literally nothing without French aid. His little host
</p>
<p>of about five thousand tried men, sustained by nearly as many
</p>
<p>new levies, was no match for the British army and navy. Still,
</p>
<p>he kept unwearied watch over the country around New York,
</p>
<p>alert to catch any opportunity for a stroke at his adversary.
</p>
<p>Lucifer was at his side, walking with him unseen to thwart
</p>
<p>his great purposes of serving and saving his country. The
</p>
<p>Devil assumed the disguise of Benedict Arnold. That creature
</p>
<p>of darkness, learning all things regarding Washington's de-
</p>
<p>signs, apprised Clinton of every matter of importance. His
</p>
<p>correspondence with Andre, during August and September,
</p>
<p>was unremitted. Once fully in possession of his post he began

</p>
<p>preparations for its betrayal by first regulating the j>nce which
</p>
<p>was to be paid in hand for his stupendous crime. Andre and
</p>
<p>Clinton do not, to our apprehension, stand out in the guise of
</p>
<p>heroes in this transaction : both were principals in the crime,

</p>
<p>Andre, had he been a man of honor, would have left to baser
</p>
<p>men that bargaining for a human solil. His whole procedure,
</p>
<p>in spite of the sympathy so freely bestowed upon his memory,
</p>
<p>was that of a,particeps criminis, and as such he deserves the

</p>
<p>christen its dead.
</p>
<p>September 18th-20th, Washington repaired to Hartford,
</p>
<p>Conn., accompanied by Lafayette, General Knox, Hamilton,
</p>
<p>McHenry and several others. The army was left in command
</p>
<p>of General Greene. The Commander-in-Chief crossed the river
</p>
<p>at Verplanck's Point in Arnold's barge  Arnold being with
</p>
<p>him and riding as far as Peekskill in his company, doubtless
</p>
<p>to learn everything possible regarding the movements which
</p>
<p>it was Washington's special mission to Hartford to concert
</p>
<p>It will be seen by Hamilton's account, which we quote, that,
</p>
<p>m crossing the river, Arnold sought to account for the presence
</p>
<p>of the British sloop of-war Yulture^ which then lay off Teller's
</p>
<p>Point, just below Haverstraw. That vessel was then co-ope-
</p>
<p>rating in the game of treason. Seven days previously (Sept
</p>
<p>11th) an interview between Andre and Arnold had been ar-
</p>
<p>ranged to be had at Dobbs' Ferrj^, which was then on " neutral
</p>
<p>ground", where, if Andre were surprised he could not be treat-
</p>
<p>ed as a spy, not being within the American lines. Arnold

<p>had arranged to have the British agent introduced to the Eob-
</p>
<p>insou House as the bearer of intelligence, \irider the feigned
</p>
<p>name of John Anderson, but Andre, well >w i-re of the despe-
</p>
<p>rate nature of his intrigue, refused to eu^ei the lines. The
</p>
<p>126 THE CONSPIRACY OF ARNOLD.
</p>
<p>interview therefore was arranged for at Dobbs' Ferry. Andre
</p>
<p>and Colonel Kobinson were on hand, at the appointed time,
</p>
<p>but Arnold's barge in coming down the river, not being cov-
</p>
<p>ered by a flag, was chased by the British guard-boats, and the
</p>
<p>Conspirator was compelled to pull back, in some haste, to the
</p>
<p>protection of a battery on the west side of the river. The
</p>
<p>Vulture therefore was sent up stream to cover the proposed in-
</p>
<p>terview. How it was effected the reader will see.
</p>
<p>Washington having proceeded to Hartford, a conference was
</p>
<p>there held, Sept. 22d, with Count Eochambeau and Admiral
</p>
<p>Ternay, to make arrangements for operations against New York,
</p>
<p>in event of de Guichen's arrival with his West India squadron,
</p>
<p>which had been reported as on its way to New England. But,
</p>
<p>news coming that the squadron had actually sailed for France,
</p>
<p>the French commander refused to enter into arrangements for
</p>
<p>the fall campaign ; and Washington returned at once to the
</p>
<p>Hudson, two days sooner than was expected by Arnold  two
</p>
<p>Providential days. The return, however, was not direct to
</p>
<p>Peekskill, but to the river above, at Fishkill, with the design
</p>
<p>of inspecting fortifications then constructing or completed
</p>
<p>along the river above West Point. The party was detained
</p>
<p>on the night of Sept. 23d at Fishkill, but started off before
</p>
<p>daylight on the morning of the 24th, designing to breakfast
</p>
<p>with Arnold at the Robinson House. A courier, with the
</p>
<p>baggage, had proceeded in advance to Arnold's headquarters
</p>
<p>to apprise him of the General's coming with his suite, for
</p>
<p>breakfast. Arnold, thunderstruck at this unexpected advent
</p>
<p>of his chief, knew not what an hour would bring forth. Two
</p>
<p>days more and he would have surrendered his garrisons to a
</p>
<p>detachment ef the British army !
</p>
<p>Most unfortunately, Washington did not proceed direct to
</p>
<p>the breakfast table, but turned aside, when within one mile of
</p>
<p>the Robinson House, to go down to the river and inspect the
</p>
<p>works at that point. Lafayette jocosely reminded him that

</p>
<p>Mrs. Arnold probably was in waiting for them, the Chief re-
</p>
<p>plied : " Ah, Marquis, you young men are all in love with Mrs.
</p>
<p>Arnold. I see you are eager to be with her as soon as possi-
</p>
<p>ble. Go you and breakfast with her, and tell her not to wait

</p>
<p>for me. I must ride down and examine the redoubts on this
</p>
<p>side of the river, but will be with her shortly." He therefore
</p>
<p>passed on down to the river, accompanied by Lafayette and
</p>
<p>Knox, while Alexander Hamilton and James McHenry, his
</p>
<p>aids, proceeded to the House, where breakfast was soon served.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Arnold was gay-hearted, totally unconscious, evidently,
</p>
<p>of the awful thunder-stroke impending. Arnold was so fear-
</p>
<p>fully impressed with the sense of his peril as to be unable to
</p>
<p>hide his emotion : he was abstracted and sullenly depressed.
</p>
<p>The crisis was approaching more rapidly than he could have
</p>
<p>In the midst of the repast the blow fell. A horseman rode
</p>
<p>up in great haste bearing a dispatch from Lieutenant-Colonel
</p>
<p>Jameson, commanding at North Castle, one of the lower sta-
</p>
<p>tions, stating that a spy named John Anderson had been ar-
</p>
<p>rested, having in his possession important papers. Andrd ar-
</p>
<p>rested, the papers discovered, no British army near, Washing-
</p>
<p>ton on the ground ! Surely, a heart less insensible to fear than
</p>
<p>that which Benedict Arnold bore in his breast, would have
</p>
<p>sunk under its load of guilt and its sense of danger. But, the
</p>
<p>bold bad man was not paralyzed to inaction. Summoning,
</p>
<p>with his finger, Mrs. Arnold from the breakfast table to her
</p>
<p>private room, he hastily told her that he was a ruined man
</p>
<p>and must flee for his life. She evidently apprehended the
</p>
<p>worst and fell into a swoon. He hastened from the room, dis-
</p>
<p>patched the bearer of the message from Colonel Jameson to
</p>
<p>her assistance, (doubtless to prevent him from conversing with
</p>
<p>Hamilton and McHenry,) seized the messenger's horse and
</p>
<p>was soon plunging, at a headlong pace, to the river, where his
</p>
<p>barge lay moored, but ever ready for service. Into it he
</p>
<p>sprang and bidding the oarsmen pull away at their best speed,
</p>
<p>as he must hasten his return to meet Washington, he sped like
</p>
<p>an arrow down the river toward the British sloop-of-war which
</p>
<p>lay below Teller's Point, awaiting Andre's return to her decks.

<p>from Arnold, whose barge, bearing a flag of truce, having safe-

<p>ly passed the battery at Yerplanck's Point, came dashing up
</p>
<p>to the Vulture's sides just before noon of that eventful day.

<p>128 THE CONSPIRACY OF ARNOLD.
</p>
<p>The traitor sprang to her decks, turned over his faithful boat's
</p>
<p>crew as prisoners of war and hastened to the cabin to pen to
</p>
<p>Washington a letter begging for considerate attentions to Mrs.
</p>
<p>Arnold, whom he protested was " as good and innocent as an
</p>
<p>angel, and as incapable of doing wrong," This was one scene
</p>
<p>in the first act of that dreadful di-ama.
</p>
<p>Let us bring up the narrative of Andre's adventures by
</p>
<p>quoting from the accou.nt given of the matter by Alexander
</p>
<p>Hamilton in a letter written, after Andre's execution, to his
</p>
<p>friend Laurens. It is at once personal, concise and clear,
</p>
<p>and, coming from Hamilton's hand, possesses a double interest.
</p>
<p>* * * " The twentieth of last month, Robinson and Andre went
</p>
<p>uj) the river in the Vulture sloop-of-war. Robinson sent a flag to Ar-
</p>
<p>Eokl wdth two letters, one to General Putnam, enclosed in another to
</p>
<p>himself, proposing an interview with Putnam, or in his absence with
</p>
<p>Arnold, to adjust some private concerns. The one to General Putnam
</p>
<p>was evidently meant as a cover to the other, in case, by accident, the
</p>
<p>letters should have fallen under the inspection of a third person.
</p>
<p>" General Washington crossed the river on his way to Hartford, the
</p>
<p>day these dispatches arrived. Arnold, conceiving he must have heard
</p>
<p>of the flag, thought it neeessary for the sake of appearances, to submit
</p>
<p>the letters to him, and ask his oi^inion of the projDriety of complying
</p>
<p>with the request. The General, with his usual caution, though without
</p>
<p>the least surmise of the design, dissuaded him from it, and advised him
</p>
<p>to reply to Robinson, that whatever related to his private aft"airs must
</p>
<p>be of a civil nature, and could only properly be addressed to the civil
</p>
<p>authority. This reference fortunately deranged the plan, and was the
</p>
<p>first link in the chain of events that led to the detection. The interview
</p>
<p>could no longer take jDlace in the form of a flag, but was obliged to be
</p>
<p>managed in a secret manner.
</p>
<p>" Arnold employed one Smith to go on board the Vulture the night
</p>
<p>of the twenty-second, to bring Andre on shore with a pass for Mr. John
</p>
<p>Anderson. Andre came ashore accordingly, and was conducted within
</p>
<p>a picket of ours to the house of Smith, w' here Arnold and he remained

<p>together in close conference all that night and the day following. At
</p>
<p>daylight in the morning, the commanding officer at King's Ferry, with-
</p>
<p>out the i^rivity of Arnold, moved a couple of pieces of cannon to a
</p>
<p>point opposite to where the Vulture lay, and obliged her to take a
</p>
<p>more remote station. This event, or some lurking distrust, made the
</p>
<p>boatmen refuse to convey the two passengers back, and disconcerted
</p>
<p>Arnold so much, that by one of those strokes of infatuation which often

</p>
<p>confound the schemes of men conscious of guilt, he insisted on Andre's
</p>
<p>exchanging his uniform for a disguise, and returning in a mode diflfcr-
</p>
<p>ent from that in which he came. Andre, who had been undesignedly
</p>
<p>brought within our jDOsts, in the first instance, remonstrated warmly
</p>
<p>against this new and dangerous expedient. But Arnold, persisting in
</p>
<p>declaring it impossible for him to return as he (jame, he at length re-
</p>
<p>luctantly yielded to his direction, and consented to change his dress,
</p>
<p>and take the route he recommended. Smith furnished the disguise,
</p>
<p>and in the evening passed King's Ferry with him, and proceeded to
</p>
<p>Cro'mpond, where they stopped the remainder of the night, (at the in-
</p>
<p>stance of a militia officer,) to avoid being suspecteRby him. The next
</p>
<p>morning they resumed their journey, Smith accompanying Andre a lit-
</p>
<p>tle beyond Pine's Bridge, where he left him. He had reached Tarry-
</p>
<p>town, when he was taken up by three militia men, who rushed out of
</p>
<p>the woods and seized his horse. At this critical moment, his presence
</p>
<p>of mind forsook him. Instead of producing his pass, which would have
</p>
<p>extricated him from our parties, and could have done him no harm with
</p>
<p>his owu, he asked the militia men if they were of the upper or lower

<p>party, distinctive appellations known among the refugee corps. The
</p>
<p>militia men replied that they were of the lower party ; upon which he
</p>
<p>told them that he was a British officer, and pressed them not to detain
</p>
<p>him, as he was upon urgent business. This confession removed all
</p>
<p>doubt ; and it was in vain he afterwards j)roduced his pass. He was
</p>
<p>forced off to a place of greater security ; where, after a careful search,
</p>
<p>there were found concealed in the feet of his stockings, several pa^^ers
</p>
<p>of importance delivered to him by Arnold. Among these there were a
</p>
<p>plan of the fortifications of West Point; a memorial from the engineer,
</p>
<p>on the attack and defense of the place ; returns of the garrison, cannon
</p>
<p>and stores ; and a copy of the minutes of a council of war held by Gene-
</p>
<p>ral Washington a few weeks before, &c. The prisoner at first was in-
</p>
<p>advertently ordered to Arnold ; but, on recollection, while still on the
</p>
<p>way, he was countermanded and sent to old Salem.
</p>
<p>" The papers were enclosed in a letter to General Washington, which,
</p>
<p>having taken a route different from that by which he returned, made a
</p>
<p>circuit, that afforded leisure for another letter, through an ill-judged
</p>
<p>delicacy, written to Arnold, with information of Anderson's capture, to
</p>
<p>get to him an hour before General Washington arrived at his quarters,
</p>
<p>time enough to elude the fate that awaited him. He went down the
</p>
<p>river in his barge to the Vulture, with such precipitate confusion, that
</p>
<p>he did not take with him a single pajier useful to the enemy. On the
</p>
<p>first notice of the affair he was pursued, but much too late to be over-
</p>
<p>taken.
</p>
<p>" There was some color for imagining it was a part of the plan to be-
</p>
<p>tray the General into the hands of the enemy. Arnold was very anx-
</p>
<p>ious to ascertain from him the precise day of his return, and the ene-
</p>
<p>my's movements seem to liave corresponded to this 2>oint. But, if so it was
</p>
<p>very injudicious. The success must have depended on surprise, and as
</p>
<p>the officers at the advanced posts were not in the secret, their measures
</p>
<p>might have given the alarm, and. General Washington taking coimnaud
</p>
<p>of the post, might have rendered the whole scheme abortive. Arnold,
</p>
<p>it is true, had so dispersed the garrison, as to have made a defense diffi-
</p>
<p>cult, but not impracticable ; and the acquisition of West Point was of

</p>
<p>such magnitude to the enemy, that it would have been unwise to connect
</p>
<p>it with any other object, however great, which might make the obtain-
</p>
<p>ing of it precarious.
</p>
<p>" Arnold, a moment before setting out, went into Mrs. Arnold's apart-
</p>
<p>ment, and informed her that some transactions had just come to light,
</p>
<p>* We infer that it was no part of Arnold's plan to betray Washington. Theie is
</p>
<p>no proof to sustain Hamilton's suspicions in this respect. Arnold's anxiety about
</p>
<p>Washington's return was upon his (Arnold's) own behalf. He would consummate
</p>
<p>the scheme before the Commander's return  as after it there would be little op-
</p>
<p>portunity for any further conference of the conspirators.

<p>ALLEGED COMPLICITY OF MRS. ARNOLD. 181

<p>which must forever banish him from his country. She fell into a swoon
</p>
<p>at this declaration, and he left her in it to consult his own safety, till
</p>
<p>the servants, alarmed by her cries, came to her relief. She remained
</p>
<p>frantic all day, accusing every one who approached her with an inten-
</p>
<p>tion to murder her child, (an infant in her arms,) and exhibiting every
</p>
<p>other mark of the most genuine and agonizing distress. Exhausted by
</p>
<p>the fatigue and tumult of her spirits, her frenzy subsided towards eve-
</p>
<p>ning, and she sunk into all the sadness of affliction. It was impossible
</p>
<p>not to have been touched with her situation : everything aflfecting in fe-
</p>
<p>male tears, or in the misfortmies of beauty, everything pathetic in the
</p>
<p>wounded tenderness of a wife, or in the ajjprehensive fondness of a
</p>
<p>mother, and, till I have reason to change the opinion, I will add, every-
</p>
<p>thing amiable in suffering innocence, conspired to make her an object
</p>
<p>of sympathy to all who were present. She experienced the most deli-
</p>
<p>cate attentions, and every friendly office, till her departure for Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia.
</p>
<p>" Andr^ was, without loss of time, conducted to the headquarters of
</p>
<p>* See Parton's " Life of Aaron Burr," pages 126-27, for apparent proof of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Arnold's complicity in the whole plot. After quoting from Hamilton's account as
</p>
<p>given above, the author says : " It fell to Burr's lot to become acquainted with the
</p>
<p>repulsive truth. He was sitting one evening with Mrs. Prevost when the approach
</p>
<p>of a party of horse was heard, and, soon after, a lady, vailed and attired in a riding
</p>
<p>habit burst into the room, and hurrying toward Mrs. P. was on the point of ad-
</p>
<p>dressing her. Seeing a gentleman present, whom, in the dim light of the apart-
</p>
<p>ment she did not recognize, she paused and asked in an anxious tone :
</p>
<p>" ' Am I safe? Is this gentleman a friend? '
</p>
<p>" ' Oh yes,' was Mrs. F.'s reply, ' he is my most particular friend, Colonel Burr.'
</p>
<p>" ' Thank God ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Arnold, for she it was : ' I've been playing the
</p>
<p>hypocrite and I'm tired of it.'
</p>
<p>" She then gave an account of the way she had deceived General Washington,
</p>
<p>Colonel Hamilton and the other American oflBcers, who, she said, believed her in-
</p>
<p>nocent of the treason and had given her an escort of horse from West Point. She
</p>
<p>made no scruple of confessing the part she had borne in the negotiations with the
</p>
<p>British General, and declared it was she who had induced her husband to do what

</p>
<p>he had done. She passed the night at Paramus, taking care to resume her acting
</p>
<p>of the outraged and frantic woman whenever strangers were present,"
</p>
<p>This extraordinary statement would at once settle the question of Mrs. Arnold's
</p>
<p>guilt were it reliable, which it is not. Burr was not present at that reputed inter-
</p>
<p>view, but was told of it after his marriage with Mrs. Prevost. Even supposing he
</p>
<p>was present, as stated, would Mrs. Arnold, as a shrewd, designing woman, have
</p>
<p>cast off her disguise and avowed all to a Colonel then commanding in the American
</p>
<p>army ? The entire story is unsustained by evidence sufficient to give it authority.
</p>
<p>Irving, in his *' Life of Washington," evidently refers to the above story when he
</p>
<p>says : " In recent years it has been maintained that Mrs. Arnold was actually cog-
</p>
<p>nisant and participant of her husband's crimes; but, after carefully examining all
</p>
<p>the proofs adduced, we remain of opinion that she was innocent."

</p>
<p>the army, where he was immediately brought before a board of General
</p>
<p>officers, to prevent all possibility of misrepresentation or cavil on the
</p>
<p>part of the enemy."
</p>
<p>Washington's conduct throughout this affair was admirable
</p>
<p>in the extreme. He passed all the morning of the fatal day
</p>
<p>in inspecting West Point  having first breakfasted at Arnold's.
</p>
<p>No suspicion of the real state of affairs crossed his mind, though
</p>
<p>several things tended to excite his surprise. Colonel Jameson,
</p>
<p>when Andre was brought before him by Paulding, Van Wert
</p>
<p>and Williams  the captors of the spy  was quite disconcerted
</p>
<p>by the nature of the affair. In " Anderson's" pass he at once
</p>
<p>detected Arnold's complicity in the game of treason, and, sup-
</p>
<p>posing Washington to be still at Hartford, at once started
</p>
<p>Andrd off, under a guard, to Hartford  also sending along the
</p>
<p>important papers discovered. Yet, as if to give Arnold the
</p>
<p>alarm, Jameson dispatched a courier to the Kobinson House,
</p>
<p>where he arrived, as we have seen, on the morning of the 24th
</p>
<p> a piece of folly only accounted for on the supposition that
</p>
<p>he did not clearly apprehend the true state of the case. Major
</p>
<p>Tallmadge, the next in command at North Castle, coming in
</p>
<p>soon after the dispatch of the prisoner and the couriers, per-
</p>
<p>ceived the great mistake made, and, at his earnest remonstrance,
</p>
<p>Andr6 was stopped at Salem, but Jameson failed to recal the
</p>
<p>courier then on his way to the Robinson House. The courier
</p>
<p>to Hartford having learned that Washington had returned to
</p>
<p>West Point, turned upon his track and, at Salem, was given a
</p>
<p>letter from Andr^ to Washington, confessing his name and
</p>
<p>rank, and offering a vindication for having assumed the char-
</p>
<p>acter of a spy. That letter was Major Tallmadge's first inti-
</p>
<p>mation of the true character of his prisoner. It, and the dis-
</p>
<p>patches by the courier, reached the Robinson House just be-
</p>
<p>fore noon of the 24th. Hamilton, as Washington's aid and
</p>
<p>secretary, broke the seals. That was their first apprisal of the
</p>
<p>act committed. Hamilton hastened out of the house to seek

<p>Washington, over the river, but, meeting the General, on his
</p>
<p>return, the two proceeded together to the house, where the full
</p>
<p>extent of the crime was soon comprehended. The Chief, though
</p>
<p>astounded, was not disconcerted- He ere long reappeared, and

</p>
<p>made confidants of Lafayette and Knox. To others tlie dis-
</p>
<p>covery was not revealed. " Whom can we trust now ? " was
</p>
<p>Washington's sad, solemn inquiry.
</p>
<p>To secure Arnold was his first thought; then care for
</p>
<p>the defenses became his source of anxiety. How many in and
</p>
<p>out of the garrison were implicated  how fully the scheme had
</p>
<p>been perfected  how quickly the British might move up the
</p>
<p>river for the assault, none knew. The suddenness of the dis-
</p>
<p>covery, the surprise, the extent of the villainy premeditated,
</p>
<p>the distrust of those around  all conspired to make Washing-
</p>
<p>ton's subordinates doubly eager to relieve the Chief's mind of
</p>
<p>its weight of apprehension. Hamilton hurried to Verplanck's
</p>
<p>Point, on horse, hoping to reach there in season to open guns
</p>
<p>on Arnold's barge ; but, the Conspirator already had flown be-
</p>
<p>yond reach : at that moment, so expeditious had been his
</p>
<p>movements, he was on the Vulture^ and his bargemen were
</p>
<p>prisoners of war. Hamilton returned to headquarters, bearing
</p>
<p>to Washington two letters sent ashore by flag of truce, from
</p>
<p>the British vessel  one from Arnold, already referred to, and
</p>
<p>one from Colonel Eobinson, Andre's coadjutor . in the enter-
</p>
<p>prise of infamy. The latter letter interceded for Andre's re-
</p>
<p>lease, saying that he was on shore under the protection and
</p>
<p>sanction of a flag of truce, by order of Arnold, who was autho-
</p>
<p>rized to give the permit,
</p>
<p>Washington dispatched a messenger to Greene, then in com-
</p>
<p>mand of the American army at Tappan, New Jersey, ordering
</p>
<p>up troops for immediate service in the garrison. Greene at
</p>
<p>once dispatched that most trusted of men, Anthony Wayne,*
</p>
<p>* Wayne's opinion of Arnold should be cited. He wrote to a friend in Congress :
</p>
<p>" There were a few gentlemen, who at a very early period of this war, became
</p>
<p>cquainted with his true character. When you asked my opinion of that ofiBcer
</p>
<p>last winter, I gave it freely, and, I believe, you thought it rather strongly shaded.
</p>
<p>1 think I then informed you that I had the most despicable idea of him, both as a
</p>
<p>gentleman and a soldier, and that he had produced a conviction in me in 1776 that

</p>
<p>honor and true virtue were strangers to his soul ; and, however contradictory it
</p>
<p>might appear, that he never possessed either genuine fortitude or personal brave-
</p>
<p>ry, and that he rarely went in the way of danger but when stimulated by liquor
</p>
<p>even to intoxication." Wayne then cites cases of Arnold's peculative operations,

<p>wnrch would seem to confirm Governor Reed's charges of Arnold's dishonest small

<p>134 THE CONSPIRACY OF ARNOLD.
</p>
<p>With his Pennsylvania brigade. That inflexible patriot, writ
</p>
<p>ing of the affair on the 27th, said :
</p>
<p>" At twelve o'clock of the morning of the 25th, an express reached
</p>
<p>General Greene from his Excellency, (who had fortunately arrived at
</p>
<p>West Point on his return from Hartford,) to push on the nearest and
</p>
<p>best disciplined troops, with orders to gain the defile or pass over the
</p>
<p>Dunderburg before the enemy. The first Pennsylvania brigade moved
</p>
<p>immediately ; and, on the arrival of the second express, I was speedily
</p>
<p>followed by our gallant friend General Irvine, with the second brigade.
</p>
<p>Our march of sixteen miles was performed in four hours, during a dark
</p>
<p>night, without a single halt or a man left behind. When our approach
</p>
<p>was announced to the General, he thought it fabulous ; but when as-
</p>
<p>sured of the reality of his tenth legion being near him, he expressed
</p>
<p>great satisfaction and pleasure.
</p>
<p>" The protection of this important place is committed to the division
</p>
<p>under my command until a proper garrison arrives. We will disjiute
</p>
<p>the approaches to the works inch by inch, at the point of the bayonet,
</p>
<p>and, if necessary, decide the fate of the day in the gorge of the defiles
</p>
<p>at every expense of blood."
</p>
<p>There was patriotism in that man's heart. Had the British
</p>
<p>attempted to carry the works, we can well believe that " Mad
</p>
<p>Anthony" and his resolute ranks would have perished to a man
</p>
<p>before yielding up the fortress. No attempt, however, was
</p>
<p>made. Andrd alone held the order of arrangements in his
</p>
<p>keeping; and, though Clinton had troops awaiting Andre's
</p>
<p>orders, they were not used. Eodney's flotilla, which had been
</p>
<p>gathered with much care for the ascent of the river, was aban-
</p>
<p>doned. No doubt exists that great confidence was felt by
</p>
<p>Clinton in the success of Andre's negotiations, and he had ar-
</p>
<p>ranged to strike quickly and strong ere the American army at
</p>
<p>Tappan could move.
</p>
<p>Efforts to rescue Andre from his fate were numerous and
</p>
<p>earnest. Clinton wrote from New York on the 26th, demand-
</p>
<p>ing the release of his officer on the ground that he was pro-

</p>
<p>tected and covered by the pass of Arnold  that, having visit-
</p>
<p>ed the American lines under a flag of truce at the request of
</p>
<p>Arnold, then having a right to make the request, he was en-
</p>
<p>titled to be considered as covered by that flag. These were
</p>
<p>the grounds urged, as we have seen, by Colonel Eobinson from
</p>
<p>the Vultures cabin, but whose force Washington did not see.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL OF MAJOR ANDRE. 135
</p>
<p>Arnold also wrote out liis views, in a note to Sir Henry, sus-
</p>
<p>taining his position in the matter. He said :
</p>
<p>" I commanded at that time, at West Point ; had an undoubted right
</p>
<p>to send my flag of truce to Major Andrt?, who came to me under that
</p>
<p>protection, and, having held conversation with him, I delivered to him
</p>
<p>confidential papers in my own hand-writing to deliver to your Excellen-
</p>
<p>cy. Thinking it much properer he should return by land, I directed him
</p>
<p>to make use of the feigned name of .John Anderson. * * All of which
</p>
<p>I then had a right to do, being in the actual service of America, under
</p>
<p>the orders of General Washington, and Commanding-General of West
</p>
<p>Point and its deijendencies."
</p>
<p>As if his orders to take command at West Point covered
</p>
<p>the right to conspire for its betrayal ! As if Andrd, disguised
</p>
<p>and secretly plotting for the ruin of his enemy within that
</p>
<p>enemy's lines, could be protected even by a " pass" of Wash-
</p>
<p>ington himself! The demand was a sublime assurance on
</p>
<p>Clinton's part, while Arnold's plea was that of a very great
</p>
<p>scoundrel. Still, Clinton was involved in the matter, for, un-
</p>
<p>der his fall sanction the " negotiations" had been carried on ;
</p>
<p>under his sanction the Vulture had gone up the river with
</p>
<p>Andr^ and Eobinson ; and, though Andr^ had gone ashore
</p>
<p>from the vessel on his own responsibility, against the wishes
</p>
<p>of Eobinson  although he had gone within the American lines
</p>
<p>and had taken treasonable correspondence in his keeping with-
</p>
<p>out orders  although he had, on his own judgment, taken a
</p>
<p>disguise and sought to return to New York by a long ride
</p>
<p>through the American lines  all these are but incidents to the
</p>
<p>one gi-eat crime permitted if not authorised by Clinton.
</p>
<p>Therefore his hand was not guiltless of Andre's fate. He felt
</p>
<p>the weight of his responsibility, and though he must have
</p>
<p>known, from the first announcement of the Major's arrest, that
</p>
<p>he would be tried as a spy and hung as a spy, yet he resolved
</p>
<p>to leave neither plea or threat untried to avert his merited
</p>
<p>fate.

<p>Andre was tried by a board of Greneral officers  six Major-
</p>
<p>Gen erals and eight Brigadiers  Greneral Greene presiding. The
</p>
<p>hearing was upon the citations of Washington, which Hamil-
</p>
<p>ton gives as follows :
</p>
<p>"Major Andre, Adjutant-General to the British army, will be brought
</p>
<p>186 THE CONSPIRA.CY OF ARNOLD.
</p>
<p>before you for your examination. He came within our lines in the night
</p>
<p>on an interview with Major-General Arnold, and in an assumed charac-
</p>
<p>ter ; and was taken within our lines, in a disguised habit, with a pass
</p>
<p>under a feigned name, and with the enclosed papers concealed upon
</p>
<p>him. After a careful examination, you will be pleased, as speedily as
</p>
<p>possible, to report a precise state of his case, together with your opinion
</p>
<p>of the light in which he ought to be considered, and the punishment
</p>
<p>that ought to be inflicted. The Judge Advocate will attend to assist in
</p>
<p>the examination, who has sundry other papers relative to this matter,
</p>
<p>which he will lay before the board."
</p>
<p>"When brought before the board" Hamilton wrote, " he met
</p>
<p>with every mark of indulgence and was required to answer no
</p>
<p>interrogatory which would even embarrass his feelings. On
</p>
<p>his part, while he carefully concealed everything that might
</p>
<p>implicate others, he frankly confessed all the facts relating to
</p>
<p>himself, and, upon his confession, without the trouble of ex-
</p>
<p>amining a witness, the board made up their report." Briefly
</p>
<p>surveying the circumstances of the case, the board was of
</p>
<p>opinion that Major Andre, Adjutant-Greneral of the British
</p>
<p>army, ought to be considered a spy from the enemy,, and,
</p>
<p>agreeably to the law and usage of nations, ought to suffer
</p>
<p>death. This decision Washington approved and ordered the
</p>
<p>execution to take place October 1st. Andr^ comported him-
</p>
<p>self with firmness and evinced gratitude for the considerate
</p>
<p>manner in which he had been treated. By his gentlemanly
</p>
<p>deportment, his unflinching resolution, his anxiety for others,
</p>
<p>he won the hearts of all. Not an American officer but would
</p>
<p>have rejoiced at some pretext for his exchange or acquittal.
</p>
<p>Even after the sentence it was intimated by Lafayette, to Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Ogden  bearer of dispatches to the British, apprising
</p>
<p>Clinton of Andre's fate  that if Arnold were given up Andrd
</p>
<p>would be exchanged for him. This intimation Ogden was au-
</p>
<p>thorised to make to the enemy and did so in his interview with
</p>
<p>the British officer commanding at Paulus' Hook. The matter

</p>
<p>was laid before Clinton who rejected the suggestion as inad-
</p>
<p>missable with honor or principle.
</p>
<p>Eeceiving the report of the military board, and learning of
</p>
<p>the sentence of execution, Clinton agam wrote to "Washington
</p>
<p>(Sept. 80th) assuming that the board had not been rightly in-
</p>
<p>BRITISH INTERCESSJON,

<p>formed of all the circumstances upon whicli to form a correct
</p>
<p>judgment ; and that, in order to have the matter properly
</p>
<p>represented he urged a suspension of proceedings until his
</p>
<p>commissioners could be heard. October 1st was fixed for
</p>
<p>Andre's execution, but the request of Clinton was granted and
</p>
<p>proceedings were stayed to await the issue of this professedly
</p>
<p>fuller information. On the morning of October 1st, three per-
</p>
<p>sons, viz : Lieutenant- Grovernor Elliott, Chief Justice Smith
</p>
<p>(brother of the Smith at whose house the treason was consum-
</p>
<p>mated) and Lieutenant-General Eobertson, accompanied by
</p>
<p>Colonel Eobinson, Andre's confidant, went up to Dobbs' Ferry
</p>
<p>by vessel. The commission asked a safe conduct to Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, but General Greene who was in attendance, would only
</p>
<p>permit Lieutenant-General Eobertson to come ashore  he be-
</p>
<p>ing the only military officer in the embassy. A long confer-

</p>
<p>urged the points already made in Andre's defense  all of which
</p>
<p>Greene declared inadmissable. Eobertson solicited permission
</p>
<p>to see Washington, but Greene  doubtless by orders of the
</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief  refused permission and reported the
</p>
<p>matter to his superior. Eobertson delivered to Greene a second
</p>
<p>letter from Arnold to Washington, which was properly deliv-
</p>
<p>ered. It reasserted his (Arnold's) right as commanding officer
</p>
<p>of the department to cover Andre's admission to the American
</p>
<p>lines, that his power to issue a pass fully covering Andre's
</p>
<p>person was indisputable. He insisted that he had a command-
</p>
<p>er's right to transact the business in which Andre was con-
</p>
<p>cerned, and then added this remarkable threat :
</p>
<p>"If after this just and candid representation of Major An-
</p>
<p>dre's case, the board of General of&cers shall adhere to their
</p>
<p>former opinion, I shall suppose it dictated by passion and re-
</p>
<p>sentment ; and if that gentleman should suffer the severity of
</p>
<p>their sentence, I shall think myself bound, by every tie of
</p>
<p>duty and honor, to retaliate on sach unhappy persons of your
</p>
<p>army as may fall within my power, that the respect due to
</p>
<p>flags and to the laws of nations may be better understood and
</p>
<p>observed.
</p>
<p>" I have further to observe that forty of the principal inhab-
</p>
<p>itants of South Carolina have justly forfeited their lives, which
</p>
<p>have hitherto been spared by the clemency of his Excellency,
</p>
<p>Sir Henry Clinton, who cannot in justice extend his mercy to
</p>
<p>them any longer, if Major Andrd suffers ; which, in all proba-
</p>
<p>bility will open a scene of blood at which humanity shudders.
</p>
<p>" Suffer me to entreat your Excellency, for your own sake
</p>
<p>and the honor of humanity, and the love you have of justice,
</p>
<p>that you suffer not an unjust sentence to touch the life of Ma-
</p>
<p>jor Andrd But if this warning should be disregarded, and
</p>
<p>he suffer, I call heaven and earth to witness that your Excel-
</p>
<p>lency will be justly answerable for the torrent of blood that
</p>
<p>may be spilt in consequence."

</p>
<p>This note excited only indignation in Washington's breast :
</p>
<p>it was worthy of Arnold but unworthy of Clinton, to whom
</p>
<p>its contents must have been known. Greene soon dispatched
</p>
<p>a brief epistfe to Eobertson, stating that the Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Arnold's attempted justification. 139
</p>
<p>Chief's conclusions were not modified by his (Robertson's)
</p>
<p>representations. To this the commissioner replied, assuming
</p>
<p>that Greene could not have reported the matter fully. He
</p>
<p>therefore addressed "Washington, stating his views and points
</p>
<p>at length. They were, however, fruitless, and Andre was ex-
</p>
<p>ecuted on the succeeding day. His bearing to the last was
</p>
<p>that of a man conscious of having done only his duty. He
</p>
<p>made no recriminations, uttered no protests, but walked to
</p>
<p>death as a soldier should. If his conscience arraigned him
</p>
<p>for the base part he had played it was not made apparent. He
</p>
<p>died on the scaffold, and forthwith was canonized by the Bri-
</p>
<p>tish nation as a martyr in its behalf
</p>
<p>The story of Arnold's career, after his safe arrival in the
</p>
<p>British camp, is one of dishonor. His first efforts were direct-
</p>
<p>ed toward the release of Andr6 ; these failing, he next issued
</p>
<p>an " address" to the people of America. In this document he
</p>
<p>sought to vindicate his memory, falsifying and dissimulating
</p>
<p>to the end. He said that in the beginning he had only taken
</p>
<p>up arms to secure a redress of grievances ; a falsehood, because
</p>
<p>he had entered the field as all other patriots did  to drive the
</p>
<p>British from American soil, and, had asseverated his right to
</p>
<p>promotion because of the services rendered in the cause of in-
</p>
<p>dependence. He regarded the Declaration of Independence
</p>
<p>as precipitate, while subsequent offers of the British Govern-
</p>
<p>ment had rendered it unnecessary  a statement as unpatriotic
</p>
<p>as it was dastardly in one who had never lisped such words
</p>
<p>until branded with infamy by his countrymen. He inveighed
</p>
<p>against the Continental Congress for its rejection of terms
</p>
<p>offered by the British Crown without submitting those offers to
</p>
<p>the people  a singular charge considering the brutal excesses
</p>
<p>committed by the British to enforce their "overtures." His last
</p>
<p>giievance  that which had most stirred his honorable pride
</p>
<p>and Christian principle, was the alliance with France, the
</p>
<p>enemy of Protestantism and of liberty. That alliance had

<p>filled the cup of his indignation and had determined his course !
</p>
<p>What to the mass of American patriots was succor in time of
</p>
<p>their greatest need  what to them was a new lease of life and
</p>
<p>hope  to Benedict Arnold was a humiliation. It were better

</p>
<p>even for his name that that excuse for his defection from the
</p>
<p>cause of hberty and honor had not been offered.
</p>
<p>He forgot to state, in this address, the amount of British
</p>
<p>gold and the military commission paid for his desertion.
</p>
<p>This document was accompanied by a proclamation address-
</p>
<p>ed especially to the officers and soldiers of the Continental
</p>
<p>army, inviting them to rally under the Cross of St. George and
</p>
<p>to fight for the true interests of their country and for liberty.
</p>
<p>To such as would come to his embraces large bounties and
</p>
<p>generous subsistence supplies were volunteered, as well az
</p>
<p>compensation for all the accoutrements and implements of wai
</p>
<p>which they might steal and bring in with them.
</p>
<p>It is needless to say the address and proclamation onlj
</p>
<p>heightened the disgust felt for the miscreant and poltroon-
</p>
<p>Washington said : "I am at a loss which to admire most, tho
</p>
<p>confidence of Arnold in publishing it, or the folly of the enemy
</p>
<p>in supposing that a production signed by so infamous a char-
</p>
<p>acter will have any weight with the people of these States, or
</p>
<p>any influence upon our officers abroad." A few cut-throats
</p>
<p>and renegades then within the British lines answered his call
</p>
<p> -just enough to give him a body guard adapted in character
</p>
<p>for his special service.
</p>
<p>His wife was made to feel the weight of his crimes. Though
</p>
<p>given a safe escort to Philadelphia she was quickly ordered,
</p>
<p>by the Executive Council, to leave the State, not to return
</p>
<p>during the war. Fourteen days only were allowed for prepa-
</p>
<p>ration. This order was issued in the firm conviction that she
</p>
<p>was privy to the plot, and had acted a part in the affair with
</p>
<p>Andre. But, to add to the supposition of her guiltlessness it
</p>
<p>is stated that, before the order of banishment was issued, she
</p>
<p>had determined to procure a legal separation from her husband
</p>
<p>" to whom" Irving says " she could not endure the thought of
</p>
<p>returning after his dishonor." Irving also quotes from a letter
</p>
<p>written at that time by one of her relatives, who said : " We

</p>
<p>tried every means to prevail on the Council to permit her to
</p>
<p>stay among us, and not to compel her to go to that infernal
</p>
<p>villain, her husband. Mr. Shippen (her father) had promised
</p>
<p>the Council, and Mrs. Arnold had signed a writing to the same
</p>
<p>ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE TEAITOR. 141
</p>
<p>purpose, engaging not to write to General Arnold any letters
</p>
<p>whatever, and to receive no letters without showing them to
</p>
<p>the Council, if she were permitted to stay." But, to no pur-
</p>
<p>pose. Public and private opinion set in so strongly against
</p>
<p>her that she was forced to proceed to New York, where she
</p>
<p>rejoined her husband, and thereafter  without a murmur as
</p>
<p>far as any evidence exists  shared his fortunes. It must have
</p>
<p>been a dreadful decree if she indeed were guiltless of compli-
</p>
<p>city in his crime.
</p>
<p>Thus ends the chapter of Arnold's Conspiracy. We might,
</p>
<p>with interest to the reader, pursue the traitor's fortunes ; might
</p>
<p>advert to his desolating and teiTible visitation upon Virginia,
</p>
<p>and to his destruction of New London in his native State ;
</p>
<p>might trace his after career in St. John's, N. B., in the West
</p>
<p>Indies and in England  the most despised and shunned of
</p>
<p>men ; but all these matters belong rather to general history
</p>
<p>and to biography than to our province. We may, however,
</p>
<p>refer to the efforts made, with Washington's consent, to secure
</p>
<p>the person of the traitor.
</p>
<p>The defection of Arnold resulted in a wide spread suspicion
</p>
<p>that others were engaged in the conspiracy, and names were
</p>
<p>whispered to Washington which gave him great uneasiness, as
</p>
<p>well as pain. General St. Clair's was mentioned so confident-
</p>
<p>ly as Arnold's confederate, that the Commander-in-Chief re-
</p>
<p>solved to investigate the implicatory charges. To this end, by
</p>
<p>secret emissaries, he reached New York, penetrated to Sir
</p>
<p>Henry Clinton's confidence and wormed the truth from Arnold.
</p>
<p>Nothing was learned to implicate any others. St. Clair was
</p>
<p>thus relieved of an odious imputation, which, if it had not
</p>
<p>been wiped away at that time might hhve stained his name
</p>
<p>forever. Washington felt great relief at the result of the in-
</p>
<p>vestigations.
</p>
<p>Major Henry Lee, who conducted the investigation, it would
</p>
<p>appear, conceived a plan for Arnold's abduction. So earnest

</p>
<p>was the desire of all, both ofiicers and men, to secure the traitor
</p>
<p>for punishment that any enterprise however hazardous, which
</p>
<p>had for its purpose Arnold's capture, would have found ready
</p>
<p>vol unteers. But, secure within the British lines, no plan was
</p>
<p>142 THE CONSPIRACY OF ARNOLD.
</p>
<p>feasible whicli necessitated the open use of force. Lee's ready
</p>
<p>mind turned to stratagem. His agents were instructed to learn
</p>
<p>all about the traitor's place of residence, bis habits, and, if
</p>
<p>possible, his plans  an injunction faithfully performed, since,
</p>
<p>through his faithful spies, he became possessed of all informa-
</p>
<p>tion necessary to perfect the project for his capture. Having
</p>
<p>conceived his plan of operations, Lee consulted with the Com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-Chief, and, after much canvassing of the affair, ob-
</p>
<p>tained from him the necessary consent to put his scheme on
</p>
<p>foot.'
</p>
<p>John Champe, Sergeant-major of cavalry in Lee's legion of
</p>
<p>light horse, was the chosen instrument of the enterprise. He
</p>
<p>was a resolute, cool and sagacious man, admirably fitted for
</p>
<p>such a service, which he undertook only after much persua-
</p>
<p>sion. In its execution, it would be necessary for hun to cover
</p>
<p>his name with the dishonor of a deserter and to link himself
</p>
<p>to Arnold's hated person  an ordeal that the patriotic dragoon
</p>
<p>shrank from encountering. His consent being won it was ar-
</p>
<p>ranged that he should desert to the enemy, make his way to
</p>
<p>New York, there to seek Arnold's household and obtain ser-
</p>
<p>vice in it in such a capacity as would place him near the trait-
</p>
<p>or's person. In this he had a confederate  a New Jersey boat-
</p>
<p>man who had long acted as a spy and, from being accounted a
</p>
<p>friend of the British, had easy access by boat to the city, bear-
</p>
<p>ing news and fresh provisions to the of&cers. Between these
</p>
<p>two it was planned to seize Arnold at night, in one of his soh-
</p>
<p>tary walks in the garden, to bear him to the boat moored in
</p>
<p>the river at the foot of the garden, and to pull out in the
</p>
<p>darkness for the Hoboken shore, where Lee was to be in at-
</p>
<p>tendance with a guard and horses to spirit the prisoner away
</p>
<p> Irving says the plan was formed at Washington's suggestion. He is in error.
</p>
<p>Lee's emissaries, by reporting that Arnold resided in a place bordering on the
</p>
<p>Hudson, suggested the idea, to the bold Major of dragoons, of Arnold's capture.
</p>
<p>Laying the plan before the Commander-in-Chief it was approved by him. Lee,

</p>
<p>therefore, should have the credit of having conceived the enterprise. Washington
</p>
<p>expressly stipulated that Arnold should be brought in alive. He said : " No cir-
</p>
<p>cumstance whatever shall obtain my consent to his being put to death. The idea
</p>
<p>which would accompany such an event would be that rufiBans had been hired to
</p>
<p>assassinate him. My aim is to make a public e.xample of him." To all of which
</p>
<p>both Lee and Champe assented.
</p>
<p>ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE THE TRAITOR. 143
</p>
<p>to Washington's headquarters. The chief difficulty in the
</p>
<p>outset was for the Sergeant to effect his escape in safety. So
</p>
<p>vigilant were the troopers that, to elude their pickets was al-
</p>
<p>most impossible, while, if discovered and pursued, capture was
</p>
<p>almost inevitable. If captured, the poor fellow would be un-
</p>
<p>der the necessity of appealing to the clemency of his drum-head
</p>
<p>court by confessing the whole affair, if he would escape being
</p>
<p>shot  a confession mortifying to make since it would impli-
</p>
<p>cate both Washington and Lee, while it was not then desirable
</p>
<p>to make the design for the traitor s capture known.
</p>
<p>All worked well. Champe, after close pursuit succeeded in
</p>
<p>taking refuge in a British guard-boat on the Hudson  barely
</p>
<p>escaping cajDture at the hands of his indignant comrades. Lee's
</p>
<p>dilatoriness in ordering the pursuit saved his messenger from
</p>
<p>recapture. Once in the British lines the dragoon made his
</p>
<p>way to Arnold, and, by representing that he had deserted from
</p>
<p>the famous light horse corps, was at once attached to the ser-
</p>
<p>vice of his intended victim. The seizure was arranged for an
</p>
<p>early consummation. The Jerseyman apprised Lee of every-
</p>
<p>thing, and all things promised success. Arnold walked night-
</p>
<p>ly in the garden : the nights were not light ; Champe and his
</p>
<p>confederate could penetrate to the place, and thus the moment
</p>
<p>of abduction was definitely fixed. But, alas for the happy
</p>
<p>issue so confidently contemplated ! The day before his pro-
</p>
<p>jected seizure Arnold moved his quarters and that night wit-
</p>
<p>nessed the total miscarriage of the hazardous enterprise. Lee
</p>
<p>waited on the Hoboken shore all night long for the expected
</p>
<p>boat, with its prize, but waited in vain. He returned to head-
</p>
<p>quarters at Tappan, to report a failure to Washington. The
</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief was much concerned in regard to tlie
</p>
<p>matter, apprehending that Champe had been detected, and
</p>
<p>would, in consequence, suffer death for his devotion to orders.
</p>
<p>But, no harm came to the bold sergeant further than that he
</p>
<p>was made to embark, as one of Arnold's American legion, in

<p>RETOLT OF THE PENNSTLTANIA LINE.
</p>
<p>The winter of 1780-81 was one of depression to the Patriot
</p>
<p>cause. To want of success in the field came that of disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment in the effect of French co-operation, upon which much
</p>
<p>reliance had been placed by Washington, by Congress, by the
</p>
<p>army and by the people. Public finances were at their lowest
</p>
<p>ebb of credit : a handfull of Continental bills being the value
</p>
<p>of a dinner. The army, illy clothed and worse paid, was dis-
</p>
<p>contented and turbulent. Many troops, whose term of enlist-
</p>
<p>ment had expired, excited dismay at their clamors for a proper
</p>
<p>requital for their services. " Commerce was almost exhausted ;
</p>
<p>there was not sufficient natural wealth on which to found a
</p>
<p>revenue ; paper currency had depreciated through want of
</p>
<p>funds for its redemption until it was nearly worthless. The
</p>
<p>mode of supplying the army by assessing a proportion of the
</p>
<p>productions of the earth had proved ineffectual, oppressive and
</p>
<p>productive of alarming opposition. Domestic loans yielded
</p>
<p>but trifling assistance. The patience of the army was nearly
</p>
<p>exhausted ; the people were dissatisfied with the mode of sup-
</p>
<p>porting the war, and there was reason to apprehend that, under
</p>
<p>the pressure of impositions of a new and odious kind, they had
</p>
<p>only exchanged one kind of tyranny for another."' Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, Hamilton, Greene, Wayne, Lafayette, apprehending the
</p>
<p>worst, plead Congress in terms which to us now seem even
</p>
<p>pitiful, for action to relieve the depression and dissatisfaction
</p>
<p>so generally prevalent. Under the stress of their petition
</p>
<p>John Laurens was dispatched (by commission dated Dec. 28th,
</p>
<p>1780) to Versailles, there to seek the aid in means and men

</p>
<p>whicli alone seemed able to avert the impending disintegration
</p>
<p>of the army and the consequent failure of the Revolution.
</p>
<p>Brigadier-Greoeral Anthony Wayne, then commanding the
</p>
<p>First Pennsylvania brigade, as early as Sej^tember 17th, 1780,
</p>
<p>wrote to President Reed, of Pennsylvania, as follows :
</p>
<p>" When I look to a period fast approaching, I discover tlie most
</p>
<p>gloomy prospects and distressing objects presenting themselves ; and
</p>
<p>when I consider the mass of people who now compose this army will
</p>
<p>dissolve by the first of January (excejit a little corj^s enlisted for the war,
</p>
<p>badly paid and worse fed) I dread the consequence, as the5.e melancholy
</p>
<p>facts may have a most unhappy influence on their minds when oj^posed
</p>
<p>to a well appointed, jjuissant and desolating army."
</p>
<p>To other influential men of his State he wrote in a similar
</p>
<p>strain. To Robert Morris, the great financier (Nov. 9 th), after
</p>
<p>referring to the disasters which must follow to American arms
</p>
<p>if the troops were not immediately cared for, he said :
</p>
<p>" Let me, therefore, as a friend and fellow-citizen, call upon you, in
</p>
<p>the most solemn manner, to meet the other part of the Assembly and
</p>
<p>Council with temper. Let party prejudices subside. Meddle not now
</p>
<p>with the Constitution, as the time is drawing nigh when the magnum
</p>
<p>concilium of Pennsylvania will be necessarily convened to decide upon
</p>
<p>its case. Exert every power for the immediate completion of your quota
</p>
<p>of troops ; establish magazines of jDrovisions ; adopt some efficacious
</p>
<p>measure to procure a quantity of specie ; and, at all events, find means
</p>
<p>to clothe the soldiers belonging to the State by the first of January."
</p>
<p>In another letter he said :
</p>
<p>" Poorly clothed, badly fed and worse paid  some of them not having
</p>
<p>received a paper dollar for near twelve months ; exposed to winter's
</p>
<p>piercing cold, to drifting snows and chilling blasts with no protection
</p>
<p>but old, worn-out coals, tattered linen overalls and but one blanket be-
</p>
<p>tween three men. In this situation the enemy begin to work upon their
</p>
<p>passions, and have found means to circulate some proclamations among
</p>
<p>them."
</p>
<p>These were indeed 'times which tried men's souls.' There

</p>
<p>must have been a tremendous weight of patriotism upon the
</p>
<p>breasts of the patriot soldiers generally to have kept down
</p>
<p>their griefs and to have soothed their absolute sufferings. The
</p>
<p>case of the Pennsylvania line troops, however, was peculiar,
</p>
<p>and the revolt here recorded in all probability would not have
</p>
<p>occurred had their only cause of complaint been scanty rations,
</p>
<p>poor clothing and no pay. These men had enlisted for " three
</p>
<p>DISORDERLY STATE OF AFFAIRS. 147
</p>
<p>years or during the war." Their three years expired in the
</p>
<p>fall of 1780, but they were refused their discharge, on the
</p>
<p>ground that their term of service was not for three years, but
</p>
<p>during the war  a construction at variance with the plain
</p>
<p>meaning of the stipulation and one rejected by all authorities :
</p>
<p>it meant three years if the war should last so long. Irving
</p>
<p>calls the construction made, chicanery.
</p>
<p>The brigade of Wayne ' went into winter quarters at Mor-
</p>
<p>ristown, New Jersey, where the troops proceeded to erect huts
</p>
<p>for their protection  a labor in which the officers participated
</p>
<p>to cheer their shivering men. Wayne said: "the officers in
</p>
<p>general, as well as myself, find it necessary to stand for hours
</p>
<p>every day exposed to wind and weather among the poor na-
</p>
<p>ked fellows while they are working at their huts and redoubts,
</p>
<p>often assisting with our own hands in order to procure a con-
</p>
<p>viction to their minds that we share, and more than share,
</p>
<p>every vicissitude in common with them, sometimes asking to
</p>
<p>participate in their bread and water. The good effect of this
</p>
<p>conduct is very conspicuous, and prevents their murmuring in
</p>
<p>public ; but the delicate mind and eye of humanity are hurt,
</p>
<p>very much hurt, at their visible distress and private complain-
</p>
<p>ings." This temporary obedience to orders soon gave way
</p>
<p>before the growing discontent. A spirit of insubordination
</p>
<p>spread rapidly, encouraged as it was by a few riotous charac-
</p>
<p>ters and by secret emissaries of Sir Henry Clinton  who was
</p>
<p>fally informed of the critical state of affairs, and sought by
</p>
<p>every means to profit by it. The men from being sullen, be-
</p>
<p>came insolent. They committed all manner of excesses among
</p>
<p>the surrounding farmers, and threatened retaliation upon any
</p>
<p>officer who questioned their right to " help themselves." In
</p>
<p>Wayne they found a sympathizing fellow-soldier, but a stern,
</p>
<p>unflinching commander  one who would be obeyed. He ar-
</p>
<p>rested and severely punished the marauders. Strong sentinels
</p>
<p>were stationed around the encampment, and every out-going

<p>Every hut was visited by the inspection-guard nightly, after
</p>
<p>tattoo-beating, to see that all the inmates, whose names were
</p>
<p>inscribed on the door, were there, "Washington wrote Wayne
</p>
<p>from his headquarters at New Windsor, 28th of December, ex-
</p>
<p>pressing great satisfaction at the arrangements of the camp, and
</p>
<p>the course being pursued. He advised that he had ordered
</p>
<p>800 of 2000 shirts (donated by the Philadelphia ladies) to be
</p>
<p>forwarded to Wayne's brigade. The letter did not reach him
</p>
<p>'in time to stay the storm, so long anticipated, of an oj^en in-
</p>
<p>surrection. Between the hours of nine and ten, on the evening
</p>
<p>of Jan. 1st (1781), the men rushed from their huts, seized upon
</p>
<p>ai-ms, ammunition and provisions, secured six pieces of artille-
</p>
<p>ry, and horses from the stables,' This formidable step was
</p>
<p>followed by the declaration that they not only were going to
</p>
<p>abandon their quarters but were determined to march upon
</p>
<p>Philadelphia and redress their grievances by their guns.
</p>
<p>The officers flew to arms. Wayne rushed among the men,
</p>
<p>followed by his aids. Cocking his pistols he threatened death
</p>
<p>to the leaders of the mutiny. Instantly a platoon of muskets
</p>
<p>were leveled at his breast One of the leaders spoke out : " We
</p>
<p>love you, we respect you, but you are a dead man if you fire.
</p>
<p>Do not mistake us. We are not going to the enemy. On the
</p>
<p>contrary, were they now to come out, you would see us fight
</p>
<p>under your orders, with as much resolution and alacrity as
</p>
<p>ever." He did not fire, but attempted to use his authority to
</p>
<p>disperse the men. Three regiments, still true to their General,
</p>
<p>were paraded under arms. A conflict ensued, in which num-
</p>
<p>bers were wounded on both sides and one Captain (Bitting)
</p>
<p>killed. The mutineers were so strong as, not only to overcome
</p>
<p>all opposition, but to compel the three regiments named to join
</p>
<p>their ranks ; when, numbering 1300 strong, the march was
</p>
<p>taken up for Philadelphia via Princeton. Wayne immediate-
</p>
<p>ly dispatched two of his leading officers to Philadelphia, to

<p>of the New Year, it was not the cause of the outbreak which, evidently, had long

<p>apprise Congress of the movement. He wrote Imrriedly to
</p>
<p>Washington detailing the particulars of the affair, and then
</p>
<p>followed on after the men, striving by all the means in his
</p>
<p>power to bring them back to duty  or, at least, to forego their
</p>
<p>desertion of their quarters, until deputies could be sent to Con-
</p>
<p>gress to arrange all difficulties. They would not be stayed.
</p>
<p>Wayne, gallantly assisted by Colonels Butler and Stewart,
</p>
<p>then ordered out the militia. " Alarm-fires were kindled upon
</p>
<p>the hills ; alarm-guns boomed from post to post," says Irving ;
</p>
<p>" the country was soon on the alert." Advancing to Prince-
</p>
<p>ton a halt was there made by the leaders of the insurrection-
</p>
<p>ists  fearing to pass beyond that point, and feeling strong
</p>
<p>in it
</p>
<p>Philadelphia was thrown into consternation by the news.
</p>
<p>Congress immediately dispatched a committee to meet the in-
</p>
<p>surgents. President Eeed and other State officers also hasten-
</p>
<p>ed forward to the scene of excitement, halting at Trenton,
</p>
<p>along with the committee, in order to confer with Wayne, who
</p>
<p>still was with the troops, in an equivocal position, being neither
</p>
<p>their commander, nor yet utterly without authority. The
</p>
<p>Governor wrote to Wayne, soliciting an interview four miles
</p>
<p>from Princeton  remai'king that, after the indignities heaped
</p>
<p>by the men upon General St. Clair, the Marquis Lafayette and
</p>
<p>Colonel Laurens (whom they had ordered out of the camp at
</p>
<p>short notice) he could not place himself in a position to receive
</p>
<p>similar treatment. This letter Wayne read aloud to the men
</p>
<p>on parade. It touched their pride to the quick : to think that
</p>
<p>their own beloved President, who had come to redress their
</p>
<p>injuries, could not trust himself in their hands! The good,
</p>
<p>leaven of reason and confidence began to work. At this mo-
</p>
<p>ment two of Clinton's agents arrived on the spot, making the
</p>
<p>most enticing overtures to the troops for their services. This
</p>
<p>fired their indignation and their patriotism. They seized the
</p>
<p>emissaries of the British commander as spies, handing them

<p>over to Wayne, by whom they were afterwards hanged, at
</p>
<p>Trenton cross-roads.
</p>
<p>President Keed, on the mornmg of the 7th, however, at
</p>
<p>Wayne's request, ventured into the encampment AH there
</p>
<p>152 REVOLT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA LINE.
</p>
<p>was precision and order, and Eeed was r&spectfally saluted as
</p>
<p>he passed. Throngh Wayne, the President proceeded to offer
</p>
<p>terms of accommodation. Through Wayne, the insurgents
</p>
<p>repHed. They still trusted their old commander entirely.
</p>
<p>After considerable correspondence terms were arranged, which
</p>
<p>proved that kindness was more potent than the sword. The
</p>
<p>insurrection was at an end. Some were discharged from ser-
</p>
<p>vice ; some on forty days' furlough ; all were to be supplied
</p>
<p>with specified clothing ; certificates were granted for such de-
</p>
<p>preciation in the currency as the troops had been compelled to
</p>
<p>suffer from ; arrears of pay were to be provided for as soon as
</p>
<p>possible. This arranged, the brigade dissolved and was soon
</p>
<p>entirely dispersed.
</p>
<p>These terms were distasteful to Washington, for he appre-
</p>
<p>hended that, as a precedent, the settlement under compulsion
</p>
<p>would be bad. So it proved. A portion of the Jersey line
</p>
<p>stationed at Pompton revolted, on the night of Jan. 20th, claim-
</p>
<p>ing the same terms granted the Pennsylvania line. As in the
</p>
<p>previous revolt Clinton's agents were ready with tempting
</p>
<p>offers to turn the troops from their allegiance to the patriot
</p>
<p>cause. This second revolt, however, the Commander-in-Chief
</p>
<p>determined to suppress by force of arms, at all hazards, and to
</p>
<p>shoot the leaders as a warning against future attempts. Major-
</p>
<p>General Howe, with a detachment from the trusty Massachu-
</p>
<p>setts hue, surprised the mutineers early one morning, in their
</p>
<p>huts. Only five minutes were granted to parade without arms
</p>
<p>and surrender the leaders. This surprise, and the determined
</p>
<p>bearing of the officer, compelled them to his terms. Two of
</p>
<p>the ringleaders were instantly shot. Thus an effectual end
</p>
<p>was put to further insurrections. Washington proved to the
</p>
<p>army that his mercy could never be tempered to mutineers :
</p>
<p>obedience to allegiance first  accommodation of differences
</p>
<p>afterwards, was his policy. As he wrote [see p. 173] regarding
</p>
<p>the insurrection in Massachusetts : '' influence i^ not governmeiit."

<p>THE "STATE OF FRANKLM" EMEUTE.
</p>
<p>" By such rash and irregular conduct, a precedent is formed for every
</p>
<p>district, and even for every county in the State, to claim the right of
</p>
<p>separation and independency for any supposed grievance of the inhab-
</p>
<p>itants, as caprice, pride and ambition shall dictate, at pleasure, thereby
</p>
<p>exhibiting to the world a melancholy instance of a feeble or pusillani-
</p>
<p>mous Government, that is either unable or dares not restrain the lawless
</p>
<p>designs of its citizens. I know, with reluctance, the State will be driven
</p>
<p>to arms ; it will be the last alternative to imbrue her hands in the blood
</p>
<p>of her citizens ; but if no other ways or means are found to save her
</p>
<p>honor and reclaim her headstrong, refractory citizens but this last sad
</p>
<p>expedient, her resources are not yet so exhausted or her spirits damped
</p>
<p>but she may take satisfaction for this great injustice received, and re-
</p>
<p>gain her government over the revolted territory, or render it not worth
</p>
<p>possessing."
</p>
<p>These were the words of a proclamation issued by tlie G-ov-
</p>
<p>ernor of North Carolina, April 25th, 1785, addressed to the
</p>
<p>people of the "Washington District." Lying on the western
</p>
<p>slope of the Alleghanies, in the vallies of the Holston and the
</p>
<p>Wautaga rivers, it was a ' world to itself,' shut in by the great
</p>
<p>Appalachian ridges on the north, east and west. Thus isolat-
</p>
<p>ed its settlers had, prior to the Eevolution, formed for them-
</p>
<p>selves a government  primitive and crude, yet substantial 
</p>
<p>which they called the "Watauga Government." This was
</p>
<p>represented by four delegates in the Convention assembled at
</p>
<p>Halifax, North Carolina, 1772. In 1777 one of these dele-
</p>
<p>gates, John Sevier, was a member of the North Carolina " House
</p>
<p>of Commons," and procured for the Watauga people a full re-
</p>

<p>"Washington, Greene and Sullivan  was made a judicial dis-
</p>
<p>trict, and' called the "Washington District." It now reposes
</p>
<p>in the quiet regions of East Tennessee, disturbed in its pris-
</p>
<p>tine valley-silence only by the whirr of wheels and the shrieks
</p>
<p>of the rushing messengers of trade and travel. During the
</p>
<p>War of Independence its inhabitants were not drawn much
</p>
<p>into the contest until during the fall of 1780, when they sud-
</p>
<p>denly swooped down upon Cornwallis' advance under Fergu-
</p>
<p>son, and, at the glorious battle of King's Mountain (Oct. 7th),
</p>
<p>performed signal service under the leadership of Sevier.' Sur-
</p>
<p>rounded as they were by hostile Indians, the inhabitants of the
</p>
<p>District were not permitted to enter into the Continental ser-
</p>
<p>vice as a distinct military body, though many of them found
</p>
<p>their way over the mountain^ to mingle in the struggle for
</p>
<p>liberty.
</p>
<p>In 1785 they were in revolt against the State, whose autho-
</p>
<p>rity over them ever had been the merest form, and whose be-
</p>
<p>nefits had been truly nominal. The District, by the voice of
</p>
<p>the people, throiigh their delegates in Convention assembled,
</p>
<p>voted to secede from North Carolina, and to erect a common-
</p>
<p>wealth of their own, to be called the " State of Franklin.'" In
</p>
<p>this act the hydra of Secession was born : "" how it was viewed

</p>
<p>high praise, to those " warriors of the wilderness."

</p>
<p>pages 12, 13, 16] that Jefferson, by his Kentucky resolutions, became the author
</p>
<p>of Secession. He was such, in effect, though Sevier and his co-workers were first
</p>
<p>to act upon the higher-law principle of " popular sovereignty." Jefferson talked
</p>
<p>for States ; Sevier used the right assumed by the Great Lawgiver as inhering to
</p>
<p>the State to apply also io parts of a State. Jefferson taught the superiority of the
</p>
<p>State over the National Government ; Sevier fought for the superiority of three
</p>
<p>counties over the State. Jefferson concocted the phrases and forms of political
</p>
<p>and social disintegration ; Sevier enforced the principle. The Virginian may have
</p>
<p>learned of Seveir; Sevier certainly did not learn of Jefferson. The " Governor"

<p>of the ' State of Franklin," however, struck the keynote of inter-State revolution
</p>
<p>too soon  before the General Government and National Executive had existence ;
</p>
<p>Jefferson struck it in 1798, and, therefore, may be regarded as wet nurse of the
</p>
<p>infant dragon ; his voice taught it to lisp its numbers and to use its relentless teeth.
</p>
<p>Fortunately for Jefferson's succeeding course he was abroad in 1778  as our
</p>
<p>Minister to France. Had he been in Virginia he might have had to commit himself on

</p>
<p>may be inferred by the quotation above given from the pro-
</p>
<p>clamation of April 25th.
</p>
<p>This movement for separation originated in the act of the
</p>
<p>North Carolina Legislature ceding to the Confederation all
</p>
<p>territory west of the Alleghanies. This cession was in response
</p>
<p>to a call of Congress for such an appropriation by all the States

<p>having untenanted lands, which were to be used as a resource

<p>for liquidating the then enormous public debt. The Confed-
</p>
<p>eration was but a rope of sand ; its Congress virtually had no
</p>
<p>power whatever over the States ; both lived simply by the
</p>
<p>sufferance of the people. Even the expenses of Congress, from
</p>
<p>1782 to '87, were unprovided for  no authority existing to levy
</p>
<p>taxes for its sustenance ! The States volunteered aid or with-
</p>
<p>held it, as they saw fit.' They enacted laws at variance with
</p>
<p>the interests of other States and of the Confederation.' Their
</p>
<p>Governors assumed prerogatives of supreme executors, and
</p>
<p>looked with disdain upon a Congress without power.' Dissolu-
</p>
<p>tion and civil war seemed imminent. Yet Congress struggled
</p>
<p>desperately to maintain the Government, to sustain its credit,
</p>
<p>and to place its Departments in a condition of efl&ciency. It
</p>
<p>enacted laws of a salutary character, though many of its en-
</p>
<p>actments necessarily were merely speculative, or were dead
</p>
<p>letters from want of power to enforce them. It called upon
</p>
<p>the States, again and again, to uphold the Confederate treasu-
</p>
<p>ry and executive. It levied assessments, imposts, excise, to
</p>
<p>receive but the shadow of a return. It borrowed with no pow-
</p>
<p>er to pay. It issued bonds which found few purchasers at any
</p>
<p>price.
</p>
<p>fires kindled in the south western counties by Sevier's ideas. Patrick Heury, aa
</p>
<p>Governor of Virginia, was, during 1785, called upon to threaten all unlawful com-
</p>
<p>binations with the punishment due to all who disturbed the harmony and offended
</p>
<p>the majesty of the State. Had Jefferson occupied Henry's seat he might have
</p>
<p>committed himself against the revolutionary idea.

<p>156 THE STATE OF FRANKLIJT EMEUTE.
</p>
<p>North Carolina answered the call for aid as stated. But,
</p>
<p>this transfer of soil without consent aroused the hardy and
</p>
<p>somewhat turbulent population of the territory ceded to an
</p>
<p>indignant opposition. The cession was made in June, 1784 ;
</p>
<p>in August, the same year, a Convention of the people of the
</p>
<p>three counties (Washington, Greene and Sullivan) assembled
</p>
<p>to take action in the matter. Sevier was a ruling spirit. He
</p>
<p>adrocated a rejection of the right of cession and claimed the
</p>
<p>right of secession. His views prevailed ; the Convention de-
</p>
<p>clared, by a unanimous voice, the independence of their coun-
</p>
<p>ties from all State relations and control. This declaration ap-
</p>
<p>parently gave popular satisfaction, since, aside from the Legis
</p>
<p>lature's action in giving away their territory, the people of the
</p>
<p>District had several grievances of an exciting character to stir
</p>
<p>up bitterness against that Legislature. August 24th a decla
</p>
<p>ration and "form of government" were issued setting forth, in
</p>
<p>true secession style, the glories to attend upon the new State.
</p>
<p>It was provided that contiguous counties in Virginia might
</p>
<p>participate in the movement and become joint heirs to pros-
</p>
<p>perity. A "provisional government'' was arranged; yet, more
</p>
<p>lionest than the secession revolutionists of 1860-61, the dele-
</p>
<p>gates did not presume to instate it until the people actually
</p>
<p>had accepted it through a second Convention. Public officers
</p>
<p>were directed to retain all public monies then in their keeping
</p>
<p>until the succeeding Convention could assume the responsibil-
</p>
<p>ity of their disposal in the "fair and equitable settlement"
</p>
<p>which it was proposed to make with the old State.
</p>
<p>Thus matters rested in the District, until the meeting, two
</p>
<p>months later, of the second Convention. The sober second
</p>
<p>thought had begun to work ; while the State, troubled at the
</p>
<p>schism, hastened to correct its ways by legislating backward.
</p>
<p>The act of cession to the Confederation was repealed ; the west-
</p>
<p>ern counties were made into an exclusive judicial district and
</p>
<p>granted an assistant judge and attorney- general for the State

<p>Superior Court ; while Sevier, the gallant but turbulent patri-
</p>
<p>ot, was commissioned a Brigadier-General ! These signs of

<p>lawgivers, disarmed the seceders of their professed " wrongs,"

</p>
<p>leaying tliem witliout an excuse for furtlier insurrection. Se-
</p>
<p>vier was reconciled.
</p>
<p>But, not so with the people. They had been excited with
</p>
<p>the blandishments of secession and were bound to taste of the
</p>
<p>forbidden fruit. They set aside the conservatives, or submis-
</p>
<p>sionists, and inaugurated the "provisional" Government. It
</p>
<p>at once proclaimed an election for members of a General As-
</p>
<p>sembly, and otherwise legislated for the "permanent" order of
</p>
<p>things. With true revolutionary precipitation an election for
</p>
<p>the Assembly was held at once ; its members elect met at
</p>
<p>Jonesborough, early in 1785, opening the " Senate" and " House
</p>
<p>of Commons" with due form. The Assembly's first act was
</p>
<p>the appointment of Sevier as provisional Governor, the insta-
</p>
<p>tion of provisional Courts and the inauguration of all neces-
</p>
<p>sary machinery of State. Their new commonwealth was then
</p>
<p>christened "The State of Franklin." This done, Sevier, by
</p>
<p>act of the Assembly, duly, and in official form, informed Mar-
</p>
<p>tin, Governor of North Carolina, of the action of the western
</p>
<p>counties, whose people "no longer considered themselves un-
</p>
<p>der the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the parent State." Ee-
</p>
<p>ceiving this quit-notice Governor Martin immediately convened
</p>
<p>his Council (April 22d, 1785). After three days' solemn de-
</p>
<p>liberation the Legislature was convoked to meet at Newbern,
</p>
<p>June 1st, in extraordinary session, and the proclamation (quot-
</p>
<p>ed at the opening of our paper) was issued  not published. It
</p>
<p>was circulated in manuscript form to give it the force of a spe-
</p>
<p>cial and personal consideration by the people of the three coun-
</p>
<p>ties, by whom it was generally read and thoroughly canvassed.
</p>
<p>It began to work among the more reflecting, and again excited
</p>
<p>the " submissionists" to life. But Sevier  " in for a penny in
</p>
<p>for a pound"  resolved to throw down the gauntlet of defiance.
</p>
<p>This he did in a manifesto to the people, encouraging them to
</p>
<p>loyalty to the new State, and threatening all malcontents with
</p>
<p>his dire displeasure. To this manifesto the new Governor of

<p>North Carolina, Caswell, rejoined, repeating his purpose to en-
</p>
<p>force the just authority of the State.
</p>
<p>But, notwithstanding all this show of war, the people of the
</p>
<p>old State apparently gave the matter little heed. Even the
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>158 THE STATE OF FEANKLIN EMEUTE.
</p>
<p>Legislature summoned to meet at Newbern forgot to come to-
</p>
<p>gether ; and, generally, the affair was treated as a joke. Profit-
</p>
<p>ing by this reception, the secessionists proceeded to strengthen,
</p>
<p>their movement and their Government, by meeting in Conven-
</p>
<p>tion at Greenville, Nov. 14th, 1785, to adopt a permanent Con-
</p>
<p>stitution.' After a noisy and not particularly harmonious
</p>
<p>' comparison of views' between the men of property and those
</p>
<p>owning only a horse, hunting-shirt and rifle, the Convention
</p>
<p>adopted the North Carolina Constitution, with slight modifica-
</p>
<p>tions. This organic law was at once put in motion in seven
</p>
<p>counties so far as legislation went, though the want of money,
</p>
<p>of taxable products, of commercial communication with the
</p>
<p>North and East, all contributed to render the new State literal-
</p>
<p>ly a state of suspense. The need for money, however, was
</p>
<p>obviated in a novel manner. By law the price of beaver, ot-
</p>
<p>ter, mink, deer and other skins  of whisky, bacon, maple sugar
</p>
<p>and homespun linen  was fixed ; and these commodities, there-
</p>
<p>after, took the place of money became the "circulating me-
</p>
<p>dium." It was provided that "all salaries and allowances
</p>
<p>hereby made shall be paid by any treasurer, sheriff" or collector
</p>
<p>of public taxes to any person entitled to the same  to be paid
</p>
<p>in specific articles (referring to skins, &c.) as collected and at
</p>
<p>the rates allowed by the State for the same," &c. Lossing ob-
</p>
<p>serves : ""
</p>
<p>" It has been jocularly declared that the salaries of the Governor, Of-
</p>
<p>ficers of State and Judges were paid in fox skins, and those of sheriffs,
</p>
<p>constables and inferior oflBcers in mink skins. This currency was ac-
</p>
<p>cepted as good, and no one thought of fluctuation or depreciation until
</p>
<p>confidence in it was shaken by daring counterfeiters. Opossom skins
</p>
<p>were almost worthless, while raccoon skins were valued at one shilling
</p>
<p>and six-pence. The counterfeiters sewed raccoons' tails upon oppossum
</p>
<p>skins, i^assed the mongrel as genuine " coous," and thus brought dis-
</p>
<p>credit upon the whole currency of Franklin."

<p>North Carolina authorities. The Legislature convened in reg-
</p>
<p>* Greenville has since become classic ground in the cause of the Union. It was
</p>
<p>there that the great Convention of Unionists was held in June, 1861, to protest

<p>against secession and treason.

<p>ular session in the fall of 1785, pursued a very conciliatory
</p>
<p>course toward the disaffected counties. An act was passed
</p>
<p>granting amnesty and oblivion for all the past providing the
</p>
<p>people returned to their allegiance and disavowed the Sevier
</p>
<p>government. They were authorised to vote for representatives
</p>
<p>in the State Assembly, while judges were appointed for the
</p>
<p>courts. This act of clemency again gave strength to the old
</p>
<p>State party, and at once created a clear issue. Sevier was firm
</p>
<p>and his partisans were in the majority ; but the opposition
</p>
<p>numbered some of the staunchest men in the District. Led
</p>
<p>by Colonel John Tipton the anti-Secessionists soon stood forth
</p>
<p>and boldly refused all recognition of the revolutionary Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor and Government. Party lines were drawn and personal
</p>
<p>feuds followed. Sevier denounced Tipton while Tipton de-
</p>
<p>nounced Sevier, Tipton stood for an election to the North
</p>
<p>Carolina Senate and others stood for the Lower House ; j udgea
</p>
<p>were appointed under the amnesty act, and the counties soon
</p>
<p>witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of two systems inaugu-
</p>
<p>rated for their government. The State of Franklin Assembly
</p>
<p>legislated, its courts decreed, and its bailiffs collected taxes:
</p>
<p>the State of North Carolina did the same. This of course
</p>
<p>quickly created a conflict. During 1786 the entire District,
</p>
<p>and particularly Washington county, was the scene of much
</p>
<p>excitement, which, at times, culminated in violence. The old
</p>
<p>State courts established their sessions for Washington county
</p>
<p>at Buffalo, within ten miles of Jonesborough. Colonel Tipton,
</p>
<p>with a number of his partisans, made a descent on the county
</p>
<p>court there in session, seized papers and ejected judge and ju-
</p>
<p>rors. Sevier immediately did the same thing for the court at
</p>
<p>Buffalo. The two leaders finally met, and from words descend-
</p>
<p>ed to blows. A regular hand to hand fight followed, in which
</p>
<p>large numbers participated : the submissionists were beaten
</p>
<p>and had to retire.
</p>
<p>Such a state of affairs could not long endure. Sevier either

<p>had to abdicate or obtain the aid of arms to enforce his autho-
</p>
<p>rity. This latter he sought to effect. He applied first to the
</p>
<p>sage, Benjamin Franklin, for advice, but received not a word.
</p>
<p>He sought an alliance with Georgia, with no success. He par-

<p>lej^ed with tlie counties in South Western Virginia, whose
</p>
<p>secession schemes Patrick Henry had nij^ped in the bud by a
</p>
<p>rigid show of authority, but not a word of comfort could he
</p>
<p>extort in return. He finally appointed Commissioners to
</p>
<p>" treat" with the State authorities for a separation ; but they
</p>
<p>were not recognised at Newburn. A delegate had, previously,
</p>
<p>been appointed to the Continental Congress, but Congress knew
</p>
<p>no "State of Franklin," and gave the delegate no admittance.
</p>
<p>Thus rebuffed Sevier did not despair. He summoned the
</p>
<p>militia to his aid. His Assembly fully empowered him to act
</p>
<p>It passed laws imposing severe penalties upon any who should
</p>
<p>presume to act, within the State of Franklin, under the authori-
</p>
<p>ty of the State of North Carolina. This was in conformity with
</p>
<p>Sevier's expressed resolve made to Governor Caswell, upon
</p>
<p>the return of the Commissioners sent to treat for separation.
</p>
<p>He then wrote :
</p>
<p>"I had the fullest hopes and confidence that that body would have
</p>
<p>either agreed to the separation on honorable principles and stip-
</p>
<p>ulations, or otherwise have endeavored to have reunited us upon
</p>
<p>such terms as might have been lasting and friendly ; but I find
</p>
<p>myself and the country entirely deceived ; and if your Assembly have
</p>
<p>thought their measures would answer such an end, they are greatly mis-
</p>
<p>taken. * * We shall continue to act as independent, and would
</p>
<p>rather suffer death in all its various and frightful shapes than conform
</p>
<p>to anything that is disgraceful."
</p>
<p>Caswell's reply was admirable. It was highly conciliatory
</p>
<p>and conveyed the assurance that, in proper season and under
</p>
<p>favorable auspices, a new State would be formed out of the
</p>
<p>territory west of the Alleghanies. He therefore begged the
</p>
<p>people to forbear, and await the issue of events as good and
</p>
<p>orderly citizens. This note was the severest blow that then
</p>
<p>could have been inflicted : it drove from Sevier's support many
</p>
<p>of his partisans, leaving him but a minority. The old State
</p>
<p>party grew, thence, rapidly. It elected members to the North

<p>Carolina Assembly and refused to countenance the election of
</p>
<p>members to the insurgent Legislature. In consequence, elec-
</p>
<p>tions were not held in several districts, and, when the showing
</p>
<p>of strength was finally made, it was ascertained that Sevier
</p>
<p>SEIZURE OF Sevier's slates. 161
</p>
<p>really had but two out of the seven counties of the new State
</p>
<p>with him.
</p>
<p>This compelled the Governor to seek for terms of accommo-
</p>
<p>dation consistent with a retreat without dishonor. He there-
</p>
<p>fore solicited the Governor of Georgia to "mediate" for a set-
</p>
<p>tlement between the old State and the new  an office which
</p>
<p>the Georgian refused to accept. Sevier then dispatched a sec-
</p>
<p>ond commission to Newbern to treat with the Governor, but
</p>
<p>Caswell would give them no recognition as commissioners,
</p>
<p>though he treated them well as citizens. The Governor of
</p>
<p>North Carolina seemed willing to let events take their course,
</p>
<p>clearly foreseeing that the people themselves would rectify
</p>
<p>their errors. He acted wisely, for the last Sevier Legislature
</p>
<p>me tin September, 1787. Failing to elect a State Council, it
</p>
<p>hovered on the verge of dissolution for a few weeks, hoping to
</p>
<p>see the way clear for an honorable surrender of their delegated
</p>
<p>authority ; but, finally expired of mere inanition. Governor
</p>
<p>Sevier alone remained. He did not surrender his authority,
</p>
<p>nor yet did he offer opposition to the rapid displacement of his
</p>
<p>ofl&cials by the old State party, and the authorities. He kept
</p>
<p>the field, however, evidently too proud and obstinate to give
</p>
<p>over to his enemies. Colonel Tipton, resolving to bring mat-
</p>
<p>ters to a crisis and thus to get rid of the Governor, concocted
</p>
<p>the seizure of Sevier's negroes. They were taken on liis farm
</p>
<p>on the ISTolachuky river and borne by the Sheriff of Washing-
</p>
<p>ton county to Tipton's farm on the Watauga river. Sevier and
</p>
<p>his friends were aroused to a state of frenzy. They gathered
</p>
<p>to the number of one hundred and fifty and proceeded to Tip-
</p>
<p>ton's house, which was surrounded and an order made for its
</p>
<p>surrender. But fifteen men were with Tipton, yet he replied
</p>
<p>defiantly to the summons. Sevier then sent in to him a writ-
</p>
<p>ten demand, as Governor of the State of Franklin, for his un-
</p>
<p>conditional surrender. This document Tipton dispatched to
</p>
<p>Colonel Maxwell, in an adjoining county, begging the Colonel

</p>
<p>to come to his aid Maxwell replied by immediately gathering
</p>
<p>a large body of partizans, with whom he fell upon Sevier's
</p>
<p>men and a severe fight ensued. Two men were mortally
</p>
<p>wounded, and Sevier's two sons were taken prisoners. Tipton

</p>
<p>resolved to hang tbem at once, and was only dissuaded by the
</p>
<p>earnest interposition of friends. Sevier's party suffered utter
</p>
<p>defeat, and the Governor became a kind of exile amid his own
</p>
<p>people. His restless spirit kept all in a ferment, until, finally
</p>
<p>(in July, 1789) the Governor of North Carolina issued an or-
</p>
<p>der for his arrest, charging him with being guilty of high trea-
</p>
<p>son. This order was issued at a moment when Sevier was on
</p>
<p>the frontier protecting the settlers against the Indians. He
</p>
<p>had gathered a strong body of armed men and proceeded to-
</p>
<p>ward the Creek country, but it was surmised that the chastise-
</p>
<p>ment of Indians was only a cover for his real design, to secure
</p>
<p>a powerful band of confederates and with them to co-operate
</p>
<p>with Miro, Spanish Governor of Louisiana, and his agent,
</p>
<p>General James Wilkinson, in transferring the country west of
</p>
<p>the Alleghanies to the Spanish rule. Evidence which after-
</p>
<p>wards transpired, proved that Sevier had really contemplated
</p>
<p>such a transfer as a last resort in resistance of the power of
</p>
<p>North Carolina.'
</p>
<p>Sevier was secured, by the aid of Tipton, and borne in irons
</p>
<p>1 The Spaniards themselves had conceited a plan for dismembering the Union.
</p>
<p>In this project General James Wilkinson became involved  the same individual
</p>
<p>who acted the part of informer against and betrayer of Aaron Burr, in 1806-7. To
</p>
<p>his complicity in the scheme for transferring Kentucky to the Spanish domination
</p>
<p>we devote one paper of this volume. Sevier's complicity is also established. On
</p>
<p>the 12th of Sept., 1788, he wrote to Gardequi, Spanish Minister to the United States,
</p>
<p>informing him that the inhabitants of Franklin were unanimous in their vehement
</p>
<p>desire to form an alliance and treaty of commerce with Spain, and to put themselves
</p>
<p>under her protection. He therefore begged for ammunition, money, and any other
</p>
<p>assistance which Miro, Governor of Louisiana, would bestow, to aid in the con-
</p>
<p>templated separation from North Carolina, pledging the faith of the State of
</p>
<p>Franklin for the payment of whatever sums Spain might advance, and whatever
</p>
<p>expenses she might incur in an enterprise which would secure to her such durable
</p>
<p>and important results. He said in conclusion :
</p>
<p>" Before concluding this communication it is necessary that I should mention

<p>that there cannot be a moment more opportune than the present, to carry our
</p>
<p>plan into execution. North Carolina has refused to accept the new Constitution
</p>
<p>proposed for the Confederacy, and therefore a considerable time will elapse be-
</p>
<p>fore ghe becomes a member of the Union if that event ever happen."
</p>
<p>This extract shows how deeply Sevier plotted. He falsified in saying that the
</p>
<p>people of Franklin were unanimous in their wish to form an alliance with Spain :
</p>
<p>the peopk really knew nothing of his ambitious, or rather of Ms desperate designs,
</p>
<p>to sustain his course. We shall advert to this phase'of Sevier's treason in a suc-

<p>to tlie jail at Jonesboroiigli. Fearing a rescue he was con-
</p>
<p>veyed secretly over the mountains to Morgantown, in Burke
</p>
<p>county. This deportation aroused the mountain men and his
</p>
<p>old confederates in arms, and they were soon on his track in
</p>
<p>large numbers, resolved upon a rescue. The trial quickly fol-
</p>
<p>lowed. Sevier was arraigned for high treason and everything
</p>
<p>promised his conviction. But his partisans were there in the
</p>
<p>great crowd. One friend, Major Evans, had brought with him
</p>
<p>the fallen Governor's fleetest mare and stood with her before
</p>
<p>the Court House door. Another friend named Cozby entered
</p>
<p>the Court room and confronted the judges. Sevier evidently

<p>knew the programme. " Are you done with this man ? " said
</p>
<p>the fearless Cozby, in a stentorian voice, addressing the judges.
</p>
<p>A scene of tumult followed, and ere a minute Sevier was
</p>
<p>astride of his fleet mare, flying like a whirlwind toward the
</p>
<p>mountains. He escaped, but only to be outlawed and hunted.
</p>
<p>But his treason was not such as to deprive him of sympathy.
</p>
<p>Out of his persecutions sprang a spirit which sustained him
</p>
<p>even in the face of persecution. His old friends rallied in
</p>
<p>force : his enemies were not vengeful, and he was elected to
</p>
<p>the North Carolina Legislature by an overwhelming vote ! In
</p>
<p>November, 1789, he was in Fayetteville to attend the Assem-
</p>
<p>bly session. No feeling prevailed against him ; on the con-
</p>
<p>trary Governor and Assembly seemed eager to reenstate him
</p>
<p>to citizenship and honor ! A special act restored him to a citi-
</p>
<p>zen's rights and soon after he was clothed with the old com-
</p>
<p>mission of Brigadier-General. The Legislature also passed an
</p>
<p>act to validate all marriages contracted and letters of adminis-
</p>
<p>tration issued under the State authority of the insurgent ad-
</p>
<p>ministration.
</p>
<p>Such was the finale of the Franklin State emeute  at once
</p>
<p>an insurrection and a revolution, though amounting to little
</p>
<p>more than the fabled tempest in the teapot. Sevier was after-
</p>

<p>was erected into a territory. A Convention called at Knox-

<p>ville, in 1796, formed a State Constitution and General Sevier

<p>was elected its first Executive. The State of Tennessee was

<p>admitted into the Union June, 1796. For two terms Se-

<p>SHAYS' REBELLION.
</p>
<p>Colonel Hiimphreys writing to General Wasliingtou un-
</p>
<p>der date of November 1st, 1786, said:
</p>
<p>" The trouble in Massachusetts still continue. Government is pros-
</p>
<p>trated in the dust, and it is much to be feared that there is not energy
</p>
<p>enough in the State to re-establish the civil powers. The leaders of tlie
</p>
<p>mob, whose fortunes and measures are desperate, are strengthening
</p>
<p>themselves daily, and it is expected that they will soon take possession
</p>
<p>of the Continental magazine at Sjiringfield, in which there are from ten
</p>
<p>to fifteen thousand stand of arms in excellent order.
</p>
<p>" A general want of compliance with the requisitions of Congress for
</p>
<p>money seems to jjrognosticate that we are rapidly approaching a crisis.
</p>
<p>Congress, I am told, are seriously alarmed and hardly know which way
</p>
<p>to turn or what to expect. Indeed, my dear General, nothing but a
</p>
<p>good Providence can extricate us from the present condition."
</p>
<p>General Knox, then Secretary of War, visiting Massachu-
</p>
<p>setts to look after the threatened revolution, thus wrote of the
</p>
<p>malcontents :
</p>
<p>" Their creed is that the property of the United States has been pro-
</p>
<p>tected from the confiscation of Britain by the joint exertions of all and
</p>
<p>therefore ought to be the common property of all, and he that attempts
</p>
<p>opposition to this creed is an enemy to equity and justice, and ought to
</p>
<p>be swept off the face of the earth. / * * * They are determined to
</p>
<p>annihilate all debts, j^ublic and jirivate, and have agrarian laws, which
</p>
<p>are easily effected by the means of unfunded paper which shall be a
</p>
<p>tender in all cases whatever,"
</p>
<p>The achievement of independence did not bring with it so-
</p>
<p>cial and political peace. The throes of a revolution were felt
</p>
<p>in tremors through all the States. Society was ill at ease.
</p>
<p>Public confidence in the stability of affairs was wanting. State
</p>
<p>animosities and jealousies became apparent, threatening future
</p>
<p>relations. Ambitious men intrigued for power and turbulent

</p>
<p>men defied authority. It was a season of great agitation, ful?
</p>
<p>of speculation and suspicion even among the most patriotic.
</p>
<p>It was evident to the observant that a great change was im-
</p>
<p>pending: the country either must drift into anarchy or a more
</p>
<p>solid and efficient government must be evolved./ Still, the men
</p>
<p>whose judgment and devotion had brought the country safely
</p>
<p>through the War for Independence struggled to maintain theii
</p>
<p>Government. The heart of those well known in the councils
</p>
<p>and the field was right ; all wished for solidarity of govern-
</p>
<p>ment and labored to accomplish that close union which alone,
</p>
<p>by suppressing the vicious spirit of State supremacy, could
</p>
<p>give the whole country one government  render the whole
</p>
<p>people one nation, and the nation one power. ' None were more
</p>
<p>earnest to accomplis' '.\, . conbolidation than Washington.
</p>
<p>His calm judgment clearly foresaw disaster, disintegration and
</p>
<p>civil commotion in the near future. To James Warren he
</p>
<p>wrote :
</p>
<p>" The Confederation appears to me to be little more than a shadow
</p>
<p>without the substance, and Congress a nugatory body ; their ordinances
</p>
<p>being little attended to. To me, it is a solecism in politics, indeed it is
</p>
<p>one of the most extraordinary things in nature that we should confede-
</p>
<p>rate as a nation, and yet be afraid to give the rulers of that nation (who
</p>
<p>are creatures of our own making, appointed for a limited and short du-
</p>
<p>ration, and who are amenable for every action and may be recalled at
</p>
<p>any moment, and are subject to all the evils which they may be instru-
</p>
<p>mental in producing) sufficient powers to order and direct the affairs of
</p>
<p>the same. By such policy as this the wheels of government are clogged,
</p>
<p>and our brightest prospects, and that high expectation which was en-
</p>
<p>tertained for us by the wondering world, are turned into astonishment ;
</p>
<p>and from the high ground on which we stood, we are descending into
</p>
<p>the vale of confusion and darkness."
</p>
<p>To another he said :
</p>
<p>" I have ever been a friend to adequate powers in Congress, without
</p>
<p>which it is evident to me we never shall establish a national character,

<p>"We are either a united people under one head and for Federal purjDoses,

<p>Constitution points out, conceives to be for the benefit of the whole,

<p>(I say unreasonable because I would have a proper jealousy always
</p>
<p>awake, and the United States on the watch to prevent individual States
</p>
<p>from infracting the Constitution with impunity) which are continually
</p>
<p>poisoning our minds and filling them with imaginary evils for the pre-
</p>
<p>vention of real ones,"
</p>
<p>In reply to a very despondent letter from Judge Jay, then
</p>
<p>Secretary of Foreign Affairs, we quote :
</p>
<p>" "We have errors to correct. "We have probably had too good an
</p>
<p>opinion of human nature in forming our Confederation. Experience
</p>
<p>has taught us that men will not adopt aud carry into execution meas-
</p>
<p>ures the best calculated for their own good, without the intervention of
</p>
<p>coercive power. I do not conceive we can exist long as a nation, with-
</p>
<p>out lodging, somewhere, a power which will pervade the whole Union
</p>
<p>in as energetic a manner, as the authority of the State Governments ex-
</p>
<p>tends over the several States. To be fearful of investing Congress, con-
</p>
<p>stituted as that body is, with ample authorities for National purposes,
</p>
<p>appears to me the very climax of popular absurdity and madness. Could
</p>
<p>Congress exert them for the detriment of the people, without injuring
</p>
<p>themselves in an equal or greater jDroportion ? Are not their interest?
</p>
<p>inseparably connected with those of their constituents ? By the rotation
</p>
<p>of appointments must they not mingle frequently with the mass of the
</p>
<p>citizens ? Is it not rather to be apprehended, if they were not possessed
</p>
<p>of the powers before described, that the individual members would be
</p>
<p>induced to use them, on many occasions, very timidly and inefficacious-
</p>
<p>ly, for fear of losing their popularity and future election ? "We must
</p>
<p>take human nature as we find it ; perfection falls not to the share of
</p>
<p>mortals.

<p>" "What then is to be done ? things cannot go on in the same strain
</p>
<p>forever. It is much to be feared, as you observe, that the better kind

<p>of people, being disgusted with these circumstances, will have theii

<p>minds prepared for any revolution whatever. "We are apt to run from

</p>
<p>These views so wise then are not without significance now,

<p>of government, should understand just what " State rights"

<p>mean, should see the future as it would be under a system
</p>
<p>where each State or district in a State, was a law unto itself,
</p>
<p>before committing themselves to the dangerous principles
</p>
<p>which are the germ of secession and revolution. Let

<p>acted for the good of the whole.
</p>
<p>The debt, at the close of the War for Independence, con-
</p>
<p>tracted by Congress in the prosecution of the war was seventy
</p>
<p>millions of dollars  a sum at that date equivalent to a debt of
</p>
<p>ten thousand millions in 1860. The debt of Massachusetts
</p>
<p>alone was five millions ; that of other States, if not proportion-
</p>
<p>ately gi'eat, was very heavy. That old New England Sta.te
</p>
<p>had been first in the field ; had furnished more men for the
</p>
<p>war than Virginia  then the first in population, wealth and
</p>
<p>political influence ; had more ably and efficiently sustained
</p>
<p>Congress than Virginia or New York by contributions, loans
</p>
<p>and taxes, and when the war was over she stood nobly forth,
</p>
<p>even with her tremendous burthen of debt, to sustain the credit
</p>
<p>of the common country. Governor James Bowdoin, the sturdy
</p>
<p>patriot and unflinching man of integrity, urged the Legislature
</p>
<p>to meet the urgent appeals of Congress for aid by assuming
</p>
<p>Massachusetts' share of the sum required in 1786 to meet the
</p>
<p>public debt  one million and a half of dollars ! ' This act of
</p>
<p>assumption was voluntary, for in Congress existed no power
</p>
<p>to enforce its behests. The Legislature, however, was not of
</p>
<p>the Governor's mind entirely. It represented, to no small de-
</p>
<p>gree, the turbulent element seething and bubbling under the
</p>
<p>surface of affairs, and threatening at any moment to break
</p>
<p>forth in an eruption of violence. The desire to be relieved of

<p>tunately for the whole country ; and Governor Bowdoin, hav-
</p>
<p>ing succeeded in his wish to sustain the calls of Congress and
</p>
<p>in suppressing the vicious paper money scheme, adjourned the
</p>
<p>Legislature from July, 1786 to January, 1787.
</p>
<p>Hamilton in his " History of the Kepublic," says : " The
</p>
<p>firmness of the Legislature put in motion every active and tur-
</p>
<p>bulent spirit. Combinations were formed entertaining despe-
</p>
<p>rate designs, and conventious of delegates from extensive dis-
</p>
<p>tricts of the State were held which adopted the most violent
</p>
<p>resolutions, censuring every measure that had been taken to
</p>
<p>fulfil the public engagements ; declaring open hostility to the
</p>
<p>ministers of justice ; calling for an abolition of all existing
</p>
<p>contracts ; claiming an equal distribution of property ; and, at
</p>
<p>the same time professing that their proceedings were Constitu-
</p>
<p>tional ! " These turbulent assemblages, indeed, became so fre-
</p>
<p>quent and so violent during August and September that Grov-
</p>
<p>crnor Bowdoin called an extra session of the Legislature to
</p>
<p>consider the alleged grievances and to take steps for suppress-
</p>
<p>ing the insurrectionary spirit. | The remonstrances, petitions,
</p>
<p>i.nanifestoes, citations and resolutions sent in were numerous
</p>
<p>enough to assure the authorities that, whatever the justice of
</p>
<p>tlieir cause, the malcontents were numerous enough to give
</p>
<p> rouble if not appeased. / Their complaints were as manifold
</p>
<p>fii the petitions were numerous. The heavy poll tax; the ex-
</p>
<p>cise ; costs of court proceedings ; high valuation of farm lands ;
</p>
<p>ilio assumption of National obligations ; the riches of lawyers ;
</p>
<p>the high salaries paid public of&ce holders  all came in for an
</p>
<p>almost general denunciation ; while many of the more signifi-
</p>
<p>cant resolutions of the "popular conventions" aimed a blow at
</p>
<p>the existence of the Senate, of Courts of Common Pleas, of
</p>
<p>several provisions of the State Constitution  all of which, it
</p>
<p>was claimed were- useless and burthensome and should be

<p>170 shays' REBELLIOIS.
</p>
<p>A convention held late in July at Hatfield, in Hampslnre
</p>
<p>county, comprised delegates from about fifty towns./ This im-
</p>
<p>portant assembly initiated the violence which soon after took
</p>
<p>form in the suppression of the Court-sittings at Northampton.
</p>
<p>It gave the insurrection the form of a popular movement for
</p>
<p>correcting grievances and disabilities unnecessarily imposed by
</p>
<p>law-givers./ Acting under its declarations other conventions
</p>
<p>followed ; while the mob, as stated, acted out the spirit of their
</p>
<p>resolves by suppressing the Northampton Court. These sedi-
</p>
<p>tious movements and act induced Bowdoin to issue a procla-
</p>
<p>mation forbidding such assemblages, and calling upon all good
</p>
<p>citizens to sustain the constituted authorities in suppressing
</p>
<p>such combinations. This really temperate manifesto from the
</p>
<p>Chief Magistrate only fired the lawless to farther seditious
</p>
<p>acts. Their strength grew daily, particularly in the counties
</p>
<p>of Worcester, Berkshire, Middlesex and Bristol, and, imitating
</p>
<p>the example of the Hampshire ruffians, the Worcester insur-
</p>
<p>rectionists, on the 1st of September, suppressed the sittings of
</p>
<p>their County Court. They then concerted a movement upon
</p>
<p>Springfield to suppress the sittings of the Supreme Court, then
</p>
<p>about to be held there. This high handed procedure was un-
</p>
<p>der the guidance of one Daniel Shays, late a Captain in the
</p>
<p>Continental army  a resolute, unscrupulous, and ambitious
</p>
<p>person, who, unquestionably sought to upturn the whole order
</p>
<p>of society.
</p>
<p>Bowdoin ordered out the militia to protect the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court from interruption; and Major-General Shepard, gather-
</p>
<p>ing six hundred reliable men, surrounded the Court House for
</p>
<p>its protection. Shays appeared on the ground, with a force
</p>
<p>much heavier than that of the militia men, but did not dare to
</p>
<p>challenge the ordeal of blood ready for him./ He essayed to
</p>
<p>communicate with the judges, but his messages were given no
</p>
<p>notice. Three days of the session were thus passed ; but, on
</p>
<p>the morning of the fourth, apprehending a general colhsion,

</p>
<p>the Court adjourned, and Shays' horde of ruffians dispersed,
</p>
<p>much to the relief of the terrified people whom they had
</p>
<p>shamelessly robbed during their three days' stay.
</p>
<p>A similar proceeding was arranged by the insurrectionary

</p>
<p>leader to suppress the Bristol county Court, overwhicli Major-
</p>
<p>General Cobb presided as Chief Justice. Bowdoin authorised
</p>
<p>Cobb to call out his forces, which he did. /' At the opening of
</p>
<p>the Court at Taunton, the insurgents appeared in great force,
</p>
<p>but Cobb's demeanor, and the determination of his troops,
</p>
<p>awed the disorganizers. The terror inspired among the towns-
</p>
<p>people at the attitude of affairs induced Cobb to adjourn the
</p>
<p>sitting, /a few days after the Supreme Court met at the same
</p>
<p>place. Its sittings were to have" been broken up, but Cobb
</p>
<p>with his ni'^itia kept the precincts of the bench sacred from in-
</p>
<p>trusion. The Middlesex County Court was less fortunate. It
</p>
<p>was not protected by the militia and its sittings were, in con-
</p>
<p>sequence, broken up.
</p>
<p>It was these acts that induced the reconvention of the
</p>
<p>Legislature, which assembled late in September to take action
</p>
<p>in the premises  to redress grievances, and to clothe the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor with full power to meet the crisis. / Bowdoin laid before
</p>
<p>the Legislators a full history of the incendiary proceedings and
</p>
<p>asked to be empowered to act as the case seemed to demand-
</p>
<p>The Legislature, while it did so empower him and pledge its
</p>
<p>entire power and resources to sustain the majesty of the law,
</p>
<p>acted upon the petitions of the insurrectionists by passing sev-
</p>
<p>eral acts of a specific nature, calculated to appease the clamors
</p>
<p>of the mob. This deference to clamor, however, was not ac-
</p>
<p>companied by any expression of mercy or leniency toward
</p>
<p>those in arms. The privileges of the habeas corpus were sus-
</p>
<p>pended for a period of eight months, to secure the rigor of the
</p>
<p>law from interference and obstruction. ! An address was issu-
</p>
<p>ed, in which the people were reminded of their National as well
</p>
<p>as State obligations, and duty to the country, while they were
</p>
<p>enjoined to discourage all acts not consistent with law and
</p>
<p>order.
</p>
<p>But, the spirit of violence was not to be laid by the exor-
</p>
<p>cism of legislative edicts. Shays and his coadjutors labored

<p>The commotion produced throughout the country by this

<p>state of affairs in Massachusetts may be inferred from Wash-

<p>ington's correspondence on the subject. Even before the ad-
</p>
<p>journment of the Legislature in December, after its six weeks'
</p>
<p>session, the insurrectionists became so evidently bent on revo-
</p>
<p>lution that Governor Bowdoin was forced to place the militia
</p>
<p>of the State on a war footing, f Whereupon Washington wrote :
</p>
<p>" What, gracious God ! is man, that there should be such inconsisten-
</p>
<p>cy and perfidiousness in his conduct. It was but the other daj^, that
</p>
<p>we were shedding our blood to obtain the Constitutions under which
</p>
<p>we now live ; Constitutions of our own choice and making; and now
</p>
<p>we are unsheathing the sword to overturn them. The thing is so unac-
</p>
<p>countable, that I hardly know how to realize it, or to persuade myself
</p>
<p>that I am not under the illusion of a dream."
</p>
<p>To the fears of Knox he replied :
</p>
<p>" I feel, my dear General Knox, infinitely more than I can exj^ress to
</p>
<p>you, for the disorders which have arisen in these States. Good God !
</p>
<p>who, beside a tory, could have foreseen, or a Briton j^redicted them ? I
</p>
<p>do assure you that, even at this moment, when I reflect uj^on the pres-
</p>
<p>ent prospect of our affairs, it seems to me to be like the vision of a
</p>
<p>dream. * * * After what I have seen, or rather what I have heard,
</p>
<p>I shall be surjorised at nothing ; for, if three years since, any person had
</p>
<p>told me that there would have been such a formidable rebellion as ex-
</p>
<p>ists this day against the laws and Constitution of our own making, I
</p>
<p>should have'thought him a bedlamite, a fit subject for a mad-house."
</p>
<p>And to James Madison he addressed this powerful plea for
</p>
<p>unity and strength in the Central Government  a plea which
</p>
<p>we may commend to the consideration of every ' democrat'
</p>
<p>who sees in his dogma of State sovereignty a cure for all the
</p>
<p>evils which government is heir to :

<p>transatlantic foes ! ' Leave them to themselves, and their Government

</p>
<p>this evil ? Or will their supineness sufitr ignorance and the arts of self-
</p>
<p>interested and designing, disaflected and desperate characters, to inr
</p>
<p>volve this great country in wretchedness and contempt ? What strong-
</p>
<p>er evidence can be given of the want of energy in our Government than
</p>
<p>these disorders ? If there is not power in it to check them, what secit-

<p>WASHINGTON ON REBELLION. 173
</p>
<p>ty has a man for life, liberty, or property ? To you, I am sure I
</p>
<p>need not add anght on the subject. The consequences of a lax or
</p>
<p>inefficient Government are too obvious to be dwelt upon. Thirteen
</p>
<p>sovereignties pulling against each other, and all tugging at the fed-
</p>
<p>eral head, will soon bring ruin on the whole; whereas, a liberal
</p>
<p>and energetic Constitution, well checked and well watched, to pre-
</p>
<p>vent encroachments, might restore us to that degree of resjiectability
</p>
<p>and consequence to which we had the fairest prospect of attaining."
</p>
<p>How he would treat insurrectionists we learn from his letter
</p>
<p>to Colonel Lee, then a member of Congress :
</p>
<p>"You talk, my good sir, of emiDloying iufluence to appease the
</p>
<p>present tumults in Massachusetts. I know not where that influence
</p>
<p>is to be found, or, if attainable, that it w'ould be a proper remedy
</p>
<p>for the disorders. Influence is not government. Let us have a govern-
</p>
<p>ment by which our lives, liberties and properties will be secured, or
</p>
<p>let us know the worst at once. There is a call for decision. ( Know
</p>
<p>r precisely what the insurgents aim at. If they have real grievances,
</p>
<p>redress them, if possible ; or acknowledge the justice of them, and
</p>
<p>your inability to do it at the mopient. If they have not, employ
</p>
<p>\the force of Government against them at once.j If this is inadequal^,
</p>
<p>all will be convinced that the superstructure is bad and wants sup-
</p>
<p>port. To delay one or other of these expedients is to exasperate on
</p>
<p>the one hand or to give confidence on the other. * * * j^g^ the
</p>
<p>reinS of Government then be braced and held with a steady hand,
</p>
<p>and every violation of the Constitution be reprehended. If defect-
</p>
<p>ive, let it be amended ; but not suffered to be trampled upon while
</p>
<p>it has an existence."
</p>
<p>The insurgents gathered, during December, in strong force,
</p>
<p>particularly in the western counties, where their meetings were
</p>
<p>violent in opposition to the Executive and Legislature. A
</p>
<p>general resolve was made to resist the enforcement of such
</p>
<p>laws as they, "the people," did not like. This wild and pre-
</p>
<p>cipitate rejection of all law was simply the result of their first
</p>
<p>professions of opposition to payment of debts, public and pri-

<p>vate. Once assuming the r^ight to nullify one law it was easy
</p>
<p>to repudiate all law. The Governor's call for the militia hast-
</p>
<p>ened the crisis. The insurgents were then to test their poM^er
</p>
<p>to cope with the Government. They gathered, under the gen-
</p>
<p>eral leadership of Shays, to meet the trial with a desperate re-
</p>

</p>
<p>174 shays' REBELLION.
</p>
<p>forms and accepted the immense responsibilities of a revolu-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Early in December a movement was concerted upon Cam-
</p>
<p>bridge, with the ultimate design of holding that place until
</p>
<p>terms were obtained of the Governor satisfactory to those in
</p>
<p>arms. The ostensible object of this movement was to obstruct
</p>
<p>the Court sitting, though it is surmised by many writers that
</p>
<p>the leaders really proposed to take Boston, to seize the public
</p>
<p>archives and to instal a provisional government. If such a
</p>
<p>coup d^eiat was meditated it failed miserably. Even its con-
</p>
<p>ception savored so strongly of folly as to be pronounced ab-
</p>
<p>surd. What could Shays and his friends hope to accomplish
</p>
<p>even by a suppression of the Court sittings at Cambridge, un-
</p>
<p>der the very shadow of the Capitol ? It must be confessed
</p>
<p>that they over-estimated their own strength or under estimated
</p>
<p>the spirit of loyalty which animated seven-eighths of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple of the State. '' It is presumed by some authorities that the
</p>
<p>c9nspirators, alarmed at the dead certainty of their destruction
</p>
<p>as soon as the militia were well in the field, conceived the idea
</p>
<p>of a march toward Boston to obtain terms of amnesty and con-
</p>
<p>cession by menacing the capital. This seems probable.
</p>
<p>But they mistook both the temper of the Governor and the
</p>
<p>power he could bring to bear on them. They gathered at
</p>
<p>Concord during December, where it was proposed to gather a
</p>
<p>host so formidable in numbers as to carry terror to all opposi-
</p>
<p>tion. The crowd did not assume the proportions designed.
</p>
<p>Many of those disaffected withdrew from the treasonable move-
</p>
<p>ment, and a want of concert in action paralj^zed the conduct
</p>
<p>of the force gathered, Bowdoin dispatched the Sheriff of Mid-
</p>
<p>dlesex county, with a strong posse comitatus, to the insurgent
</p>
<p>quarters and succeeded in arresting three of the mob leaders,
</p>
<p>who were soon immured in Boston jail. This unsuspected
</p>
<p>stroke somewhat disconcerted the insurgent programme, but
</p>
<p>only for a season. Shays led a large body of his men against

<p>unresisting people. They soon cleared the town of its provi-

</p>
<p>capital, he proposed at once to march into the city.) His pro-
</p>
<p>ject was received with favor by all his -adherents ; for a few
</p>
<p>days it seemed as if Boston was seriously in danger. But,
</p>
<p>Bowdoin was stirring. ^ The veteran General Lincoln, of Revo-
</p>
<p>lutionary fame, was placed in command of the militia sum-
</p>
<p>moned for the defense of the city. He soon made such dispo
</p>
<p>sitions of forces and guns as compelled Shays to retire frou.
</p>
<p>"Worcester to Eutland, /where he found quarters for his arm}-
</p>
<p>of rag-a-muf5ns in the old Continental barracks. Here starva-
</p>
<p>tion stared them in the face, and Shays was forced to action to
</p>
<p>save his force from immediate disbandment. He therefore
</p>
<p>marched upon Springfield, where the County Court was to
</p>
<p>open its sessions December 26th. The insurgents arrived there
</p>
<p>on the 25th, and at once warned the Judges against opening
</p>
<p>the session, taking possession of the Court House for their quar-
</p>
<p>ters. This, of course, prevented the sitting for that term.
</p>
<p>"^Bowdoin was resolved to use the full power of the State to
</p>
<p>end this insurrection. He therefore made a call for 4400 mili-
</p>
<p>tia, to serve thirty days. Two artillery companies, of good
</p>
<p>material, were put m requisition. General Lincoln assumed
</p>
<p>the field. Two thousand men were ordered to muster at Bos-
</p>
<p>ton ; the rest in other parts of the State ; and all were to move
</p>
<p>upon Shays at Springfield in concert, to prevent his escape.
</p>
<p>Bowdoin issued a proclamation characterised by kindness but
</p>
<p>firmly expressing his purpo^^e to compel a submission to the
</p>
<p>laws and constituted authorities. I
</p>
<p>These formidable preparations did not intimidate the insur-
</p>
<p>rectionary leader.) He prepared for resistance, and, by excit-
</p>
<p>ing appeals, as well as by the use of threats, gathered a very
</p>
<p>strong force around him. He appealed in a published address
</p>
<p>to his " suffering fellow citizens" to rally in defense of their
</p>
<p>rights, setting forth the wrongs for which they had obtained
</p>
<p>no redress. He then prepared to arm his rapidly increasing

<p>forces by a seizure of the Government arsenal at Springfield,
</p>
<p>where were stored about twelve thousand stand of arms in
</p>
<p>good order. This danger to the arsenal Bowdoin and the Con-
</p>
<p>tinental Government had foreseen, and had commissioned
</p>
<p>176 shays' rebellion.
</p>
<p>General Sliepard of tlie Hampshire district to gather the militia
</p>
<p>in its protection. There were soon over one thousand excel-
</p>
<p>lent troops in Springfield ready for his orders. The arsenal
</p>
<p>was then deemed safe, and the Court proposed to assume its
</p>
<p>session ; but Shaj^s, calling in his forces from the various ren-
</p>
<p>dezvous, prepared for an attack and capture of the arsenal be-
</p>
<p>fore Lincoln could arrive. { To this end he mustered full
</p>
<p>eighteen hundred fellows, most of them real desperadoes ; and
</p>
<p>made his combinations for assault on or before the 25th of Jan-
</p>
<p>uary, as Lincoln was then at Worcester, only fifty miles dis-
</p>
<p>tant. Shays marched upon Shepard, at four o'clock on the
</p>
<p>afternoon of the 25th, approaching in open column. The
</p>
<p>General sent out his flag of truce, warning Shays not to ap-
</p>
<p>proach, but it was not respected  the insurgents continuing to
</p>
<p>approach. A second warning was given by Shepard ; it also
</p>
<p>was received derisively. The artillery was then brought to
</p>
<p>bear on the approaching mob, and a blank cartridge fired. It
</p>
<p>had^no effect, except to extort a laugh and a shout of defiance.
</p>
<p>The guns were then shotted and fired. Three of Shays' men
</p>
<p>were killed and one wounded. This earnest of the reception
</p>
<p>that awaited them sent a thrill of dismay into the insurgent
</p>
<p>ranks ; and soon, despite all efibrts, they were on the run for
</p>
<p>Ludlow, ten miles away, through the deep snow. Shays, re-
</p>
<p>enforced by a fresh detachment under Luke Day, rallied
</p>
<p>enough, however, to make a second attempt upon the arsenal.
</p>
<p>Before he could arrange matters, Lincoln, by a forced march,
</p>
<p>reached Springfield with four regiments, artillery and a troop
</p>
<p>of cavalry. This saved the place, to the great relief of the
</p>
<p>alarmed inhabitants.
</p>
<p>Lincoln, determined to dissipate the entire insurgent
</p>
<p>army, marched a detachment over the Connecticut river  then
</p>
<p>firmly frozen to West Springfield, whence the vagabonds of
</p>
<p>Day retreated in confusion to Northampton. Shepard moved,
</p>
<p>at the same time, direct up the river against Shays' own force,

<p>which retired to Amherst. In its vicinity and at Pelham the
</p>

</p>
<p>in January tlie State forces took up quarters at Iladley, from
</p>
<p>whence the old General addressed a last warning to the insur-
</p>
<p>rectionary leader, informing him that defiance to law was open
</p>
<p>rebellion which would surely be punished as high treason. To
</p>
<p>this Shays answered with apparent boldness, proposing a ces-
</p>
<p>sation of hostilities, an unconditional pardon for all engaged in
</p>
<p>the " controversy" and a hearing of the points at issue before
</p>
<p>the Legislature  terms which the General was not empowered
</p>
<p>to concede. '' The insurgents, assisted by a section of society
</p>
<p>which exists in every State of those who, under the guise of
</p>
<p>"peace men," "compromisers," "conservatives," covertly use
</p>
<p>their influence to cover assaults upon the Government, or upon
</p>
<p>the order of communities  were encouraged to strengthen their
</p>
<p>opposition as the best means of securing a pardon and of com-
</p>
<p>pelling the Legislature to adopt laws favorable to the agrarian
</p>
<p>and loose desires of the mob. The armistice asked for by
</p>
<p>Shays was only to give him time for consolidating his force
</p>
<p>and to strengthen the movement by creating a formidable
</p>
<p>"peace party," upon whose influence he might count in secur-
</p>
<p>ing pardon for all. | This Lincoln comprehended, and he pur-
</p>
<p>posed to end the matter before it could gain much momentum
</p>
<p>or shield its abettors by raising up friends in their behalf ISTot
</p>
<p>only the State but the Continental Congress looked to him for
</p>
<p>safety, and he resolved to strike finishing blows to the danger-
</p>
<p>ous combination.
</p>
<p>The insurgents having moved to Petersham, late in January,
</p>
<p>there awaited the Legislature's action on a petition signed by
</p>
<p>Shays and other leaders of the rebellion, in which they ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged their mistake in taking up arms against the State
</p>
<p>in redresss of grievances which they desired to correct, and
</p>
<p>promised to lay down their arms if a guarantee of pardon to
</p>
<p>all were given. / Upon this no action was taken, though the
</p>
<p>peace men strove to call it up by every parliamentary strata-
</p>
<p>gem. / Bowdoin had adapted his means to ends and found the

<p>Legislature ready to sustain him in forcing the rebels to terms
</p>
<p>and in bringing the guilty leaders to trial. (' Steps were taken
</p>
<p>for strengthening the force in the field. But, before these re-
</p>
<p>enforcements reached him, Lincoln had struck the fatal blow

<p>178 shays' rebellion.
</p>
<p>wliicli really ended the " rebellion." He moved bj night from
</p>
<p>Hadley, upon Petersham, and, after a forced march of thirty
</p>
<p>miles through a heavy snow, with the cold at zero, reached
</p>
<p>the insurgent quarters early the next day, surprising the rebels
</p>
<p>completely, when they incontinently fled without firing a gun.
</p>
<p>Shays and other leading spirits made their escape. One hun-
</p>
<p>dred and fifty of his followers were secured by the State troops
</p>
<p>as prisoners. The " army" of Shays was broken, but the spirit
</p>
<p>of resistance to law was not entirely allayed, for it kept parts
</p>
<p>of the State in a ferment for several months thereafter, to the
</p>
<p>intense disgust and anger of all the better portion of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple. In Berkshire county the lawlessness of the mob continu-
</p>
<p>ed to such a degree that the better class of citizens formed a
</p>
<p>home guard to give safety to themselves and order to commu-
</p>
<p>nities. They acted with such determination as to break up
</p>
<p>the several insurrectionary bands which still retained their or-
</p>
<p>ganization in that section, inspired by the leaders and most
</p>
<p>guilty abettors of the rebellion, who had fled to New York,
</p>
<p>Vermont and New Hampshire, to escape arrest and trial for
</p>
<p>treason.
</p>
<p>Congress was then holding its session in New York, whither
</p>
<p>many of the insurgent leaders took refuge. On the 18th of
</p>
<p>February, 1787, General Schuyler, in the Senate, moved for a
</p>
<p>proclamation to issue for their apprehension. The alarm felt
</p>
<p>by Congress was great. None knew how quickly the fires of
</p>
<p>insurrection might kindle in other sections. The then incipi-
</p>
<p>ent Federal party  laboring for a stronger Government, a new
</p>
<p>Constitution and a more consolidated Union  seized the mo-
</p>
<p>ment to press their ideas, and to encourage the call for a Con-
</p>
<p>vention to propose the necessary changes in the organic struc-
</p>
<p>ture of the Union. It was a period of extreme excitement,
</p>
<p>particularly in all the New England and Middle States. The

<p>chy. Shays' rebellion was but the eruption of a disease in the
</p>

<p>the system. How the hearts of patriots must hav,e suffered in
</p>
<p>those days of ahiiost hopeless suspense ! In the letters saved
</p>
<p>to us of the correspondence of "Washington, Adams, Madison,
</p>
<p>Hamilton, Jay, Livingston, Ames, Pinckney, &c., we see how
</p>
<p>those worthies struggled to stem the tide of disorganization
</p>
<p>that was fast drifting the Union toward a condition of vassal-
</p>
<p>age to the British crown which it had bled through a seven
</p>
<p>years' war to shake o& There were, thank God, of pure and
</p>
<p>far seeing minds enough to lead the wild elements into the
</p>
<p>only true way necessary to save the country.
</p>
<p>In this period it is inspiring to turn to the conduct of Mas-
</p>
<p>sachusetts. She stood forth as a model of courage, patriot-
</p>
<p>ism and clear sighted conception of the crisis. She not only
</p>
<p>suppressed the rebellion within her borders, but sustained the
</p>
<p>General Government in a gratifying manner. She lent her
</p>
<p>voice to the convention for the adoption of a new Constitution.
</p>
<p>She labored with her great heart and mind to perfect the
</p>
<p>Union and to strengthen a Nationality which only needed
</p>
<p>consolidation to make it one of the most powerful governments
</p>
<p>on the earth. Her record is indeed a noble one ; and if a very
</p>
<p>few of her citizens, at a later day, advocated the pernicious
</p>
<p>doctrines of nullification and secession, it may be imputed less
</p>
<p>to her want of patriotism than to her detestation of a line of
</p>
<p>policy calculated to injure the whole country.
</p>
<p>The " rebellion" was ended. Bowdoin made application
</p>
<p>to the Governors of adjoining States for the arrest of fugi-
</p>
<p>tive citizens harbored within their jurisdiction. /The LegislaA

<p>used their authority to pardon over three hundred, who, it ap-
</p>
<p>peared, were simply the deceived tools of designing dema-

</p>
<p>(among them several justices of the peace) were tried for, and

</p>
<p>CONSPIRACT OF GENERAL JAMES WILKINSON.
</p>
<p>General Artlinr St. Clair, in a letter to his old companion
</p>
<p>in arms, Major Dunn, dated Dec. 5th, 1788, said :
</p>
<p>"I am very much grieved that there are strong dispositions on the
</p>
<p>part of the peojjle of Kentucky to break off their connection with the
</p>
<p>United States, and that our friend Wilkinson is at the head of this
</p>
<p>affair. Such a consummation would involve the United States in the
</p>
<p>greatest difficulties, and would comi^letely ruin this country. Should
</p>
<p>there be any foundation for these rumors, for God's sake make use of
</p>
<p>your influence to detach Wilkinson from that party."
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, the party here referred to, in a secret dispatch to
</p>
<p>Miro, Spanish Governor of Louisiana, under date of February
</p>
<p>14th, 1789, wrote :
</p>
<p>" Herein inclosed you will find two Gazettes which contain all the
</p>
<p>proceedings of our last Convention. You will observe that the memo-
</p>
<p>rial to Congress was presented by me, and perhaps your first impression
</p>
<p>vdll be that of surprise at such a document having issued from the jjen
</p>
<p>of a good Spaniard. But, on further reflection, you will discover that
</p>
<p>my policy is to justify in the eye of the world our meditated separation
</p>
<p>from the rest of the Union, and quiet the apprehensions of some friends
</p>
<p>in the Atlantic States, the better to divide them, because, knowing how
</p>
<p>impossible it is that the United States should obtain what we aspire to,
</p>
<p>not only did I gratify my sentiments and inclinations, but I also framed
</p>
<p>my memorial in such a style as was best calculated to excite the passions
</p>
<p>of our people ; and convince them that Congress has neither the jjower
</p>
<p>nor the will to enforce their claims and pretensions. Thus havino- en-
</p>
<p>ergetically and publicly represented our rights and lucidly established
</p>
<p>our pretensions, if Congress does not support them with efficacy (which
</p>
<p>you know it cannot do, even if it had the inclination), not only will all
</p>
<p>the people ot Kentucky, but also the whole world, approve of our seek-
</p>
<p>ing protection from another quarter."

<p>182 CONSPIEACY OF WILKINSON.
</p>
<p>trigue we may add to these two quotations another from Miro's
</p>
<p>dispatch to Madrid, dated April 11th, 1789 :
</p>
<p>" In the paragraph B, you will find an account of the bold act which
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson has ventured upon, in presenting his first memorial
</p>
<p>in a public convention. In so doing, he has so completely bound him-
</p>
<p>self, that, should he not be able to obtain the separation of Kentucky
</p>
<p>from the United States, it has become impossible for him to live in it,
</p>
<p>unless he has suppressed, which is possible, certain passages which
</p>
<p>might injure him. Nevertheless, on account of the ojjposition made by
</p>
<p>Marshall and Muter to Wilkinson's plan, the Convention determined
</p>
<p>that new memorials be presented to Virginia and to Congress, to obtain
</p>
<p>the independence o^ Kentucky, its admission into the Union, and the
</p>
<p>free navigation of the Mississippi."
</p>
<p>Spain came into possession of the Louisiana territory, as
</p>
<p>stated in the "Conspiracy of Pontiac," (page 94) by a secret
</p>
<p>Convention in 1762, She did not, however, take possession
</p>
<p>until 1779. An attempt to assume the government in 1766
</p>
<p>brought with it extreme excitement, which culminated, in
</p>
<p>1768, in an open insurrection, by which the colonists and old
</p>
<p>French residents entirely drove out the Spaniards. The arri-
</p>
<p>val of O'Eeilley in the same year with a strong force soon re-
</p>
<p>stored the Spanish authority. His reign of blood quickly sup-
</p>
<p>pressed all ideas of any further revolt ; and thenceforward, to
</p>
<p>1803, the country remained under the dominion of Spain.
</p>
<p>The territory, understood to be comprised in their domain,
</p>
<p>reached from St, Genevieve and St. Louis, to the Gulf  a vast,
</p>
<p>undefined region on the west of the Mississippi river, with
</p>
<p>some possible claims to territory on the east, low down, on the
</p>
<p>Gulf
</p>
<p>New Orleans, with a population in 1765 of 4960, Natchez
</p>
<p>1550, Mobile 746, St. Louis 897, were their principal towns,
</p>
<p>though the territorial census of 1765 gave a total population
</p>
<p>of 81,433. During the War of the Eevolution the Spanish
</p>
<p>Governor, Galvez, had made a glorious campaign against the

</p>
<p>British posts on the river and Gulf  an episode of that war too
</p>
<p>little known to the mass of readers. Baton Eouge, Natchez,
</p>
<p>Mobile, Pensacola, all were wrested from Great Britain by the
</p>
<p>gallant Spaniard. These conquests gave to his possessions
</p>
<p>territory east of Mississippi, It was a portion of these ac-
</p>
<p>qub'ed possessions which Georgia claimed, extending from
</p>
<p>THE SPANISH DOMINATION, 183
</p>
<p>Loftus' Heights, toward the north, for about three hundred
</p>
<p>miles. That State in 1785 sent Commissioners to New Orleans
</p>
<p>to reclaim possession  a demand which was referred to the
</p>
<p>authorities of the two Governments, Spain and the American
</p>
<p>Congi'ess, for adjudication. Aside from this claim there was
</p>
<p>no right of soil urged by the American Government, or any
</p>
<p>of the States, against the Spanish possessions of Louisiana.
</p>
<p>But the " manifest destiny" principle of aggrandisement be-
</p>
<p>gan to show itself at that early day. Hardly had the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can Revolution ended before the eyes of capitalists, adventur-
</p>
<p>ers and statesmen looked longingly down the Mississippi, while
</p>
<p>the tide of emigration began to pour, in one steady stream,
</p>
<p>into Kentucky, Western Pennsylvania, Western Virginia and
</p>
<p>Tennessee  all States watered by rivers whose outlet was the
</p>
<p>Mississippi. The commerce of all that vast region, drained by
</p>
<p>the Tennessee, Cumberland and the confluents of the Ohio,
</p>
<p>necessarily centered at New Orleans. No treaty stipulations
</p>
<p>having been entered into between Spain and the American
</p>
<p>Congress to regulate that trade great dissatisfaction soon pre-
</p>
<p>vailed. Every flat-boatman and trader who returned home to
</p>
<p>the North and East, after his long voyage, had his story to tell
</p>
<p>of impositions practiced upon hira by the New Orleans ofiicials.
</p>
<p>Schemes for the seizure of that post was freely canvassed dur-
</p>
<p>ing the years 1786-88.'
</p>
<p>The Spaniards, alive to the threatened danger of subversion,
</p>
<p>soon conceived a counter plot, which not only would break the
</p>
<p>ascendancy of the Federal Union to the West, but would per-
</p>
<p>petuate Spanish power. This plan was to erect Louisiana into
</p>
<p>a viceroyalty, similar to that of Mexico, and, by offering im-
</p>
<p>mense inducements to emigration, to fill up the territory with
</p>
<p>a hardy and reliable population, who, as planters and traders,
</p>
<p>would give order and solidity to the new power. Gayarre, in
</p>
<p>his " History of the Spanish Domination in Louisiana," says :

</p>
<p> See Judge Martin's " History of Louisiana," vol. ii. page 101, for reference to

</p>
<p>l>hia, were both inirsuing the same object, wMcb was  to draw to
</p>
<p>Louisiana as much of the Western population as could be induced to
</p>
<p>emigrate, and even to operate, if possible, a dismemberment of the Con-
</p>
<p>federacy, by the secession of Kentucky and of the other discontented
</p>
<p>districts from the rest of the United States. Both these Spanish func-
</p>
<p>tionaries were partners in the same game, and yet they were unwilling
</p>
<p>to communicate to each other the cards they had in hand. Each one
</p>
<p>was bent upon his own plan, and taking care to conceal it from the
</p>
<p>other ; each one had his own secret agents unknown to the colleague
</p>
<p>whom he ought to have called to his assistance. There was a want of
</p>
<p>concert, arising perhaps from jealousy, from the lack of confidence, from
</p>
<p>ambition, from the desire of engrossing all the praise and reward ii
</p>
<p>case of success, or from some other cause. Be it what it may, the con-
</p>
<p>sequence was, that the schemes of these two men frequently counteract-
</p>
<p>ed each other, and resulted in a series of measures which were at vari-
</p>
<p>ance and contradictory, and which seemed inexjilicable to him who had
</p>
<p>not the key to what was going on behind the curtain."
</p>
<p>General James Wilkinson here comes upon the historic stage-
</p>
<p>to act his part of Conspirator, spy and dissimulator. He had
</p>
<p>done honorable service in the War for Independence, as may
</p>
<p>be inferred from the tone of General St. Clair's letter, quoted
</p>
<p>at the opening of this paper ; but he had not obtained any
</p>
<p>distinctive position in that contest ; and, had he not come for-
</p>
<p>ward in his western intrigues with Governor Miro and with
</p>
<p>Aaron Burr, his fame would have passed into the common
</p>
<p>but honorable catalogue of the Eevolutionary fathers. He ap-
</p>
<p>pears to have been an ambitious and an unscrupulous man,
</p>
<p>gifted with rather unusual powers of dissimulation, but with
</p>
<p>less judgment than should belong to chai^acters who would
</p>
<p>emulate Talleyrand. In the history of his intrigues with Miro,
</p>
<p>to carry Kentucky over to the Spanish interest, he made, for
</p>
<p>several years, a liberal use of prophecies and promises ; he la-
</p>
<p>bored assiduously in a field of diplomacy in which few men
</p>
<p>would have discovered much fruit ; he conceived castles which
</p>

</p>
<p>proved to be less real than structures of air ; yet he found it
</p>
<p>possible to deceive Miro, to dupe the Spanish Minister, to con-
</p>
<p>ciliate the United States ; and, if his projects all failed, it was
</p>
<p>not from the lack of talent for trickery but rather from want
</p>
<p>of judgment in correctly apprehending men and circumstances.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson appeared in New Orleans, early in the year 17b7,
</p>
<p>THE PLOT DEVELOPED. 185
</p>
<p>as a trader having ventured down the Mississippi from Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky with a flat-boat load of flour, tobacco, butter and bacon.
</p>
<p>The usual offensive tariif-customs levied upon all such ventures
</p>
<p>were remitted in his case, by Governor Miro, after a long in-
</p>
<p>terview. The supposition is that, having conceived the pro-
</p>
<p>ject for a large trade, he let Miro into his secret concerning
</p>
<p>the destiny of Kentucky, and together they then hatched the
</p>
<p>scheme which, in some of its aspects, recalls John Law's cele-
</p>
<p>brated " Mississippi Bubble," which was first based upon the
</p>
<p>trade and resources of this very same Louisiana territory.
</p>
<p>Having sold his cargo with gi'eat advantage to himself the ad-
</p>
<p>venturer devoted three months to "interviews" with Miro.
</p>
<p>Gayarrd says : " Many wondered at the intimacy which had
</p>
<p>grown up, during this time, between Miro and Wilkinson, and
</p>
<p>sly hints and insinuations were thrown out as to its nature and
</p>
<p>tendency." Butler, in his "History of Kentucky," gives us
</p>
<p>some inkling of the subjects canvassed by the two worthies.
</p>
<p>It transpired that Wilkinson had given his "views" in writing
</p>
<p>respecting the political interests of Spain and the inhabitants
</p>
<p>ofthe United States dwelling upon the Western waters. These
</p>
<p>views, written out at considerable length, were designed to
</p>
<p>show the good policy of opening trade with the North by lib-
</p>
<p>eral arrangements and an encouraging policy. He alluded to
</p>
<p>the surpassing richness of the regions watered by the rivers
</p>
<p>flowing to the South assuming that the people had a natural
</p>
<p>right to the use of the river as a highway. One or two allu-
</p>
<p>sions were rather novel. Thus, as reported by Butler: "he
</p>
<p>describes the general abhorrence with which they (the western
</p>
<p>people) received the intelligence that Congress was about to
</p>
<p>sacrifice their dearest rights by ceding to Spain, for twenty
</p>
<p>years, the navigation of the Mississippi ; and represents it as a
</p>
<p>fact that they are on the point of separating themselves entire-
</p>
<p>ly from the Union on that account" He thereupon proceeded
</p>
<p>to show how easily it would be for the Americans and British,

</p>
<p>united, to wrest the Louisiana territory from Spain. This
</p>
<p>document was addressed to Governor Miro though really de-
</p>
<p>signed for the Spanish Minister, Valdez, having super\asion
</p>
<p>of foreign and colonial aF^irs. " But it leaked out," says Ga-
</p>
<p>186 CONSPIRACY OF WILKINSON.
</p>
<p>yarr^, " and passed current among those who pretended to be
</p>
<p>well informed, that Wilkinson had delivered to the Spanish
</p>
<p>Governor a memorial containing other representations which
</p>
<p>were kept from the public eye." What this other document
</p>
<p>was soon appeared. Gardoqui, in pursuance of his plans, dis-
</p>
<p>patched his agent, Pierre Wower d'Arges, to the Cumberland
</p>
<p>and Kentucky region to " invite" the people to emigrate to the
</p>
<p>Florida District of Lower Louisiana. The agent executed liis
</p>
<p>mission ; and, he being empowered to make most liberal grants
</p>
<p>of land, rights in slaves, free admission of farming implements,
</p>
<p>as well as to grant liberal commercial privileges, he succeeded
</p>
<p>in securing a number of American families, who proceeded to
</p>
<p>the South and became subjects of Spain. This movement on
</p>
<p>the part of the Spanish Minister to the American Confedera-
</p>
<p>tion, at once awoke all the jealousy of Miro, who saw in it
</p>
<p>danger to his own and Wilkinson's projects. What these pro-
</p>
<p>jects were had to come forth to the light. January 8th, 1788,
</p>
<p>the Governor wrote to Yaldez at some length to show that
</p>
<p>Gardoqui's operations must prove disastrous to the larger and
</p>
<p>more important enterprise of Wilkinson. " I fear that they
</p>
<p>may clase with Wilkinson's principal object," he said, and
</p>
<p>proceeded to demonstrate how important it would be to make
</p>
<p>the two act in concert. " I have been reflecting for many days
</p>
<p>whether it would not be proper to communicate to d'Arges
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's plans, and to Wilkinson the mission of d'Arges,
</p>
<p>in order to unite them and to dispose them to work in concert.
</p>
<p>But I dare not do so, becaiise d'Arges may consider that the
</p>
<p>gr-eat project of Wilkinson may destroy the merit of his own,
</p>
<p>and he may communicate them to some one who might cause
</p>
<p>Wilkinson to be arrested as a criminal, and also because Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson may take offence at another being admitted to partici-
</p>
<p>pate in confidential proceedings, upon which depend his life
</p>
<p>and honor, as he expresses himself in his memorial." '

<p>morial. What was its purport ? We can infer from the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing words which occur in the Governor's protest to Valdez :
</p>
<p>" The delivering up of Kentucky into his Majesty'' s hands, which
</p>
<p>is the main object to ivhich Wilkinson has promised to devote him-
</p>
<p>THE PROCESS OF THE PLAN. 187
</p>
<p>adf entirely^ would forever constitute tliis jDrovince a rampart
</p>
<p>for the protection of New Spain."
</p>
<p>This revealed something of Wilkinson's plot. More evidence
</p>
<p>was soon forthcoming. In April Miro sent forward another
</p>
<p>dispatch announcing the arrival of letters from his coadjutor,
</p>
<p>from one of which he quoted as follows :
</p>
<p>"I have collected much Euroiaean and American news, and have made
</p>
<p>various interesting observations for our political designs. It would take
</p>
<p>a volums to contain all that I have to communicate to you. But I dis-
</p>
<p>patch this letter with such haste, and its fate is so uncertain, that I hope
</p>
<p>you will excuse me for not saying more until the arrival of my boats ;
</p>
<p>and, in the mean time, I pray you to content yourselves with this assu-
</p>
<p>rance : all my predictions are verifying themselves, and not a measui-e
</p>
<p>is taken on both sides of the moulitaius which does not conspire to fa-
</p>
<p>vor ours. I encountered great difficulties in crossing the mountains."
</p>
<p>This letter also contained a paragraph highly illustrative of
</p>
<p>the duplicity which was the ruling principle of Wilkinson's
</p>
<p>strategy. He wrote:
</p>
<p>" Considering that Gardoqui has spies all over the United States, I
</p>
<p>thought that, in order to prevent his suspicions, and divert his investi-
</p>
<p>gations from the quarter to which they might be directed, it was pru-
</p>
<p>dent on my part to write him a comi^limeutary letter, in which I broach-
</p>
<p>ed some ideas which may give rise to a corresijondeuce between us, and
</p>
<p>the result of which I shall communicate to you."
</p>
<p>On the 5th of May another letter was dispatched by Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson to his confederate in New Orleans, by the hand of Ma-
</p>
<p>jor Dunn  the of&cer to whom General St. Clair addressed the
</p>
<p>letter given at the beginning of this paper. We now learn
</p>
<p>fully of the process by which the plan was to be carried into
</p>
<p>execution. We shall see them thus :
</p>
<p>"Major Isaac Dunn, the bearer of this dispatch, and an old military
</p>
<p>companion of mine, came to settle in these parts during my absence.
</p>
<p>The reliance which I jout in his honor, his discretion and his talents, has
</p>
<p>induced me, after having sounded his dispositions with proper caution,

<p>to choose him as a fit auxiliary in the execution of our political designs,
</p>
<p>which he has embraced with cordiality. He will therefore present him-
</p>
<p>self in order to confer with you on those points which require more ex-
</p>
<p>amination, and to concert with you those measures which you may deem
</p>
<p>necessary to expedite our plan ; and, through him, I shall be able to
</p>
<p>receive the new instructions which you may deem expedient to send me.
</p>
<p>I have also chosen him to bring me back the product of the present car-

<p>go of my boats. For these reasons, permit me to recommend him as one

<p>wortby of your entire confidence, and as a safe and sagacious man, who
</p>
<p>is profoundly acquainted with the political state of the American Union,
</p>
<p>and with the circumstances of this section of the country. I desire that
</p>
<p>he be detained in Louisiana as little as possible.
</p>
<p>" On the first day of January of the next year, 1789, by mutual consent,
</p>
<p>this district will cease to be subjected to the jurisdiction of Virginia.
</p>
<p>It has been stipulated, it is true, as a necessary condition of our inde-
</p>
<p>pendence, that this territory be acknowledged an independent State by
</p>
<p>Congress, and be admitted as such into the Federal Union. But a Con-
</p>
<p>vention has already been called to form a Constitution of this section
</p>
<p>of the country, and I am persuaded that no action on the part of Con-
</p>
<p>gress will ever induce this people to abandon the plan which they have
</p>
<p>adopted, although I have recent intelligence that Congress will, beyond
</p>
<p>a doubt, recognize us as a Sovereign State.
</p>
<p>" The Convention of which I have spoken will meet in July, I will,
</p>
<p>in the mean time, inquire into the prevailing opinions, and shall be able
</p>
<p>to ascertain the extent of the influence of the members elected. When
</p>
<p>this is done, after having previously come to an understanding with two
</p>
<p>or three individuals capable of assisting me, I shall disclose so much
</p>
<p>of our great scheme as may appear opportune, according to circumstanc-
</p>
<p>es, and I have no doubt but that it will meet with a favorable reception ;
</p>
<p>because, although I have been communicative with no more than two
</p>
<p>individuals, I have sounded many, and wherever it has seemed ex^jedi-
</p>
<p>ent to me to make known your answer to my memorial, it has caused
</p>
<p>the keenest satisfaction. Colonel Alexander Leatt BuUit and Harry
</p>
<p>Innis, our attorney-general, are the only individuals to whom I have
</p>
<p>intrusted our views, and, in case of any mishap befalling me before their
</p>
<p>accomplishment, you may, in perfect security, address yourselves to
</p>
<p>these gentlemen, whose political designs agree entirely with yours. Thus,
</p>
<p>as soon as the new government shall be organized and adopted by the
</p>
<p>people, they will proceed to elect a governor, the members of the legis-
</p>
<p>lative body and other ofiicers, and I doubt not but that they will name
</p>
<p>a political agent with power to treat of the afiair in which we are en-
</p>
<p>gaged, and I think that all this will be done by the month of March

<p>present Federal compact, that body can neither dispose of men nor
</p>
<p>money, and the new government, should it establish itself, will have to
</p>
<p>encounter difiiculties which will keep it weak for three or four years,
</p>
<p>before the expiration of which I have good grounds to hope that we
</p>
<p>shall have completed our negotiations, and shall have become too
</p>
<p>strong to, be subjected by any force which may be sent against us.
</p>
<p>The only fears I have, proceed from the policy which may prevail

<p>in yonr Court. I am afraid of a change in the present ministry, and
</p>
<p>hi the administration of Louisiana, of the possibility of which event
</p>
<p>you are better judges than I can be, and I beg you to be explicit
</p>
<p>with me on the subject. * * *
</p>
<p>" I have applied to Mr. Clark, my agent in New Orleans, with re-
</p>
<p>gard to sending me merchandise by the way of the ^lississipjji. This
</p>
<p>is of the utmost importance for the accomplishment of our wishes,
</p>
<p>because the only tie which can preserve the connection of this coun-
</p>
<p>try with the Atlantic States is the necessity under which we are, to
</p>
<p>rely on them altogether for the supply of such articles as are not
</p>
<p>manufactured among us ; and when this people shall find out that
</p>
<p>they can proeure them more conveniently through this river, the
</p>
<p>dependent state in which they are will cease, and with it all mo-
</p>
<p>tives of connection with the other side of the Apalachian mountains.
</p>
<p>Our hopes will then be turned toward you, and all obstacles in the
</p>
<p>way of our negotiations will have been removed."
</p>
<p>This important document was farther illuminated by Miro's
</p>
<p>comments accompanying its remission to Spain. He said:
</p>
<p>" This Major confirms all of Wilkinson's assertions, and gives
</p>
<p>it out as certain, that, next year, after the meeting of the first
</p>
<p>assemblies in which Kentucky will act as an independent
</p>
<p>State, she will separate entirely from the Federal Union ; he
</p>
<p>further declares that he has come to that conclusion from hav-
</p>
<p>ing heard it expressed in various conversations among the
</p>
<p>most distinguished citizens of that State : that the direction of
</p>
<p>the current of the rivers which run in front of their dwelhngs
</p>
<p>points clearly to the power to which they ought to ally them-
</p>
<p>selves, but he declares that he is ignorant of the terms on
</p>
<p>which this alliance will be proposed. The said Brigadier-
</p>
<p>General, in a private letter addressed to me, adds that he flat-
</p>
<p>ters himself with the prospect of his being the delegate of his
</p>
<p>State to present to me the propositions offered by his country-
</p>
<p>men, and that he hopes to embrace me in April next."
</p>
<p>Miro begins to suspect his agent, at this stage of their pro-

<p>ceedings, it would appear, for he states that Wilkinson had
</p>
<p>borrowed three thousand dollars, which the cargo sent down
</p>
<p>by Major Dunn was to repay. The rest of the cargo was to
</p>
<p>pay for the tobacco, which he had bought on credit, and to
</p>
<p>give him money to "support himself without embarrassment"
</p>
<p>The Governor thereupon adds : " Although his candor, and

<p>known him well, seem to assure us that he is working in
</p>
<p>good earnest, yet I am aware that it may be possible that his
</p>
<p>intention is to enrich himself at our expense, by inflating us
</p>
<p>with hopes and promises which he knows to be vain."
</p>
<p>It would require a volume to trace their Conspiracy through
</p>
<p>all its tortuous ways. That it was a deeply laid plan of the
</p>
<p>Spanish Grovernment to break up the Union, important docu-
</p>
<p>ments which have lately come to light tend fully to prova
</p>
<p>Wilkinson was confidential operator, spy and agent of the
</p>
<p>Spaniards in Louisiana, while d'Arg^s received instructions
</p>
<p>direct from Madrid to do all in his power to procure the dis-
</p>
<p>memberment of the American Union.' Gardoqui gave powers
</p>
<p>of colonization to Colonel George Morgan, late of the Conti-
</p>
<p>nental army, who proposed to establish a large colony at some
</p>
<p>point below the mouth of the Ohio. This he succeeded in
</p>
<p>doing, founding the town of New Madrid, now in Missouri, as
</p>
<p>a Spanish settlement. On the 3d of November, 1788, Miro
</p>
<p>wrote to Valdez to say that the " affair"  the dismemberment
</p>
<p>of the Union  " proceeds more rapidly than I had presumed,
</p>
<p>and some considerable impetus is given to it by the answer of
</p>
<p>Congress to the application of Kentucky to be admitted into
</p>
<p>the Union as an independent State." " Eest assured" he fur-
</p>
<p>ther wrote " that Brown (a delegate to Congress from Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky), on his arrival in Kentucky (he was then in attendance
</p>
<p>upon Congress) finding Wilkinson and his associates disposed
</p>
<p>to surrender themselves up to Spain, or at least to put them-
</p>
<p>selves under her protection will easily join them ; and it is
</p>
<p>probable, as Wilkinson has already foretold it, that, next
</p>
<p>spring, I shall have to receive here a deputation appointed in
</p>
<p>due form." This deputation, however, never arrived. Wil
</p>
<p>kmson wrote under date of February 12th, 1789, to Mii-o, from
</p>
<p>Lexington, Kentucky, saying :

<p>devoted all my faculties to our political designs, and I have never since

</p>
<p>ceive that they are such as to inspire us with flattering hopes of success
</p>
<p>in due time, and, although in the conjectural opinions which I presented
</p>
<p>to you and Navarro, I may, in some particulars, have been deceived, you
</p>
<p>will yet see that, in the main, I expressed myself with a prophetic spirit,
</p>
<p>and that imj)ortant events have occiUTed, to confirm the accuracy of my
</p>
<p>sentiments.
</p>
<p>" When Major Dunn left Kentucky, I had opened myself only to the
</p>
<p>Attorney General Innis, and to Colonel Bullitt, who favor our designs,
</p>
<p>and indirectly I had sounded others, whom I also found well disposed to
</p>
<p>adopt my ideas. But, having made a more strict examination, I dis-
</p>
<p>covered that the proposed new Government of the United States had
</p>
<p>inspired some with apprehensions, and others with hopes  so much so
</p>
<p>that I saw that this circumstance would be a cause of some opposition
</p>
<p>and delay. I also perceived that all idea that Kentucky would subject
</p>
<p>itself to Spain must be abandoned for the present, and that the only
</p>
<p>feasible plan to the execution of which I had to direct my attention
</p>
<p>was that of a sejjaration from the United States, and an alliance with
</p>
<p>Spain, on conditions which could not yet be defined with precision. I
</p>
<p>considered that, whatever be the time when the separation should be
</p>
<p>brought about, this district being then no longer under the protection
</p>
<p>of the United States, Spain might dictate her own terms; for which
</p>
<p>reason, I embraced without delay this last alternative.
</p>
<p>" The question of separation from the United States, although dis-
</p>
<p>cussed with vehemence among the most distinguished inhabitants of
</p>
<p>this section of the country, had never been mentioned, in a formal man-
</p>
<p>ner, to the people at large, but now was the time for making this im-
</p>
<p>portant and interesting experiment, and it became my indispensable
</p>
<p>mission to do so. I had to work on a ground not yet prepared for the
</p>
<p>seed to be deposited in it, and I felt that, to produce a favorable im-
</p>
<p>pression, I had to proceed with reserve, and avoid with the utmost care
</p>
<p>any demonstration which might be calculated to cause surprise or alarm.
</p>
<p>For these motives, I gave an equivocal shape to the expression of my
</p>
<p>design, speaking of it in general terms, as being recommended by emi-
</p>
<p>nent politicians of the Atlantic coast, with whom I had conversed on
</p>

</p>
<p>this affair ; and thus, by indirect suggestions and arguments, I inspired
</p>
<p>the people with my own views, without presenting them as such, be-
</p>
<p>cause it would have been imprudent in me to divulge them under the
</p>
<p>existing circumstances, and I can give you the solemn assurance that I
</p>
<p>found all the men belonging to the first class of society in the district,
</p>
<p>with the exception of Colonel Marshall, our surveyor, and Colonel Muter,
</p>
<p>one of our Judges, decidedly in favor of separation from the United
</p>
<p>States and of an alliance with Spain."
</p>
<p>He then proceeds to detail proceedings of much interest in
</p>
<p>regard to the political operations of the year consequent on
</p>
<p>192 CONSPIRACY OF WILKINSON.
</p>
<p>Kentucky's endeavor to form a State, and then adds in justifi-
</p>
<p>cation of the two-faced part which he played :
</p>
<p>" To consolidate the interests and confirm the confidence of our friends,
</p>
<p>to try our strength, to familiarize the jjeople with what we aim at, to
</p>
<p>dissipate the apprehension which important innovations generally pro-
</p>
<p>duce, and to provoke the resentment of Congress with a view to stimu-
</p>
<p>late that body into some invidious political act, which might excite
</p>
<p>the passions of the people ; these are the motives which influenced me,
</p>
<p>and on which I rely for my justification."
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, in this important communication, lifts the vail
</p>
<p>upon the secession scheme which he encouraged, while he se-
</p>
<p>cretly plotted to transfer the State to the keeping of Spain.
</p>
<p>After divulging the machinations which he had set on foot,
</p>
<p>^nd betrayed the results of an interview held with an emissary
</p>
<p>of Lord Dorchester, Governor-General of Canada (who propos-
</p>
<p>ed to assist the men of the West in driving Spain from her
</p>
<p>Louisiana possessions), Wilkinson came to the confessional
</p>
<p>thus :
</p>
<p>"After having read these remarks, you will be surprised at being in-
</p>
<p>formed, that lately I have, jointly with several gentlemen of this coun-
</p>
<p>try, applied to Don Diego Gardoqui for a concession of land, in order
</p>
<p>to form a settlement on the river Yazoo. The motive of this applica-
</p>
<p>tion is to procure a place of refuge for myself and my adherents, in case
</p>
<p>it should become necessary for us to retire from this country, in order
</p>
<p>to avoid the resentment of Congress. It is true that there is not, so
</p>
<p>far, the slightest appearance of it, but it is judicious to provide for all
</p>
<p>possible contingencies."
</p>
<p>In his relation of the interview with Colonel Connelly, the
</p>
<p>British emissary to provoke a descent upon New Orleans for
</p>
<p>its seizure, we have the character of the Conspirator well deline-
</p>
<p>ated. After Connelly had divulged his whole information and
</p>
<p>secret proifers of assistance, Wilkinson resolved to get rid of
</p>
<p>him at once ; and, for that purpose, hired a hunter to waylay
</p>
<p>the agent with the apparent intent to murder him in revenge

</p>
<p>for excesses committed by the English and Indians in the War
</p>
<p>of the Eevolution. As Wilkinson held the office of " Civil
</p>
<p>Judge," the hunter was brought before him and committed
</p>
<p>"I availed myself," says the upright judge, "of this circum-
</p>
<p>stance to communicate to Connelly my fear of not being able
</p>
<p>to answer for the security of his person, and I expressed my
</p>
<p>FURTHER DUPLICITY. 193
</p>
<p>doubts whether he could escape with life. It alarmed him so
</p>
<p>much that he begged me to give him an escort to conduct him
</p>
<p>out of our territory, which I readily assented to, and, on the
</p>
<p>20th of November he recrossed the Ohio on his way back to
</p>
<p>Detroit." From Connelly he obtained full particulars of the
</p>
<p>British design to drive Spain from her possessions in the West
</p>
<p>K the messenger of Lord Dorchester represented truly, then
</p>
<p>Great Britain must have been willing to enlist in a war against
</p>
<p>France and Spain, since any active co-operation in sustaining,
</p>
<p>with arms, munitions and stores, a campaign against New Or-
</p>
<p>leans, must have resulted in a state of hostilities between the
</p>
<p>three great powers.
</p>
<p>In a private communication written to M. Miro, two days
</p>
<p>after the above lengthy dispatch the spy, the Conspirator makes
</p>
<p>still further divulgements, which prove that if he did not suc-
</p>
<p>ceed in transfessing Kentucky to Spain it was not for lack of
</p>
<p>rascality in trying to consummate his scheme. He made known
</p>
<p>the following precious items of news :
</p>
<p>" Don Diego Gjflrdoqui, about the month of March last, received from
</p>
<p>his court ample powers to make with the people of this district the ar-
</p>
<p>rangements he might think proper, in order to estrange them from the
</p>
<p>United States and induce them to form an alliance with Spain. I re-
</p>
<p>ceived this information, in the first j^lace, from Mr. Brown, the member
</p>
<p>of Congress for this district, who (since the taking into consideration of
</p>
<p>our application to be admitted into the Union has been suspended) en-
</p>
<p>tered into some free communications on this matter with Don Diego
</p>
<p>Gardoqui. He returned here in September last, and, finding that there
</p>
<p>had been some opposition to our project, he almost abandoned the cause
</p>
<p>in despair, and ijositively refused to advocate in public the propositions
</p>
<p>of Don Diego Gardoqui, as he deems them fatal to our cause. Brown
</p>
<p>is one of our deputies or agents ; he is a young man of respectable tal-
</p>
<p>ents, but timid, without jjolitical exjDerience, and with very little knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of the world. Nevertheless, as he firmly perseveres in his adher-
</p>
<p>ence to our interests, we have sent him to the new Congress, appai-ently

<p>as our representative, hut in reality as a spy on the actions of that body. I
</p>
<p>would myself have undertaken that charge, but I did not, for two rea-
</p>
<p>sons : first, my presence was necessary here, and next, I should liave
</p>
<p>found myself under the obligation of swearing to support the new Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, which I am in duty bound to oppose."
</p>
<p>The letter-writer then proceeds to show up Gardoqui. In
</p>
<p>his true chaiacter of informer and dissimulator, Wilkinson
</p>
<p>194: CONSPIRACY OF WILKINSON.
</p>
<p>seeks by his items of news and his special version of Gardo^
</p>
<p>qui's operations, to inflame Miro against the minister. Yet,
</p>
<p>despite this, he (Wilkinson) was seeking for favors from the
</p>
<p>minister thus acknowledging his authority for granting lands,
</p>
<p>passes and commercial favors in the Louisiana territory. He
</p>
<p>(W.) confessed that himself, Brown, Major Dunn and others,
</p>
<p>had petitioned to Gardoqui for the grant of land to establish a
</p>
<p>colony on the Yazoo, above Natchez, as already referred to,
</p>
<p>that the conspirators, in case of disasters, might have a place
</p>
<p>of retreat. " With a view to removing every cause of distrust
</p>
<p>or unfavorable impression from Gardoqui's mind I wrote him
</p>
<p>a letter of which I send you a copy," said Wilkinson ; while,
</p>
<p>in trjdng to extenuate his application to the minister for the
</p>
<p>Yazoo grant, he said : " Our intention is to make an establish-
</p>
<p>ment on the ground mentioned in my communication of the
</p>
<p>12th, to estroy the plan of a certain Colonel Morgan^
</p>
<p>What duplicity is here ! Seeks to cajole the Spanish minis-
</p>
<p>ter into giving a grant for a colony which the colonists propose
</p>
<p>to found in order to thwart Gardoqui's own agent, Morgan, in
</p>
<p>founding a colony above ! As if, only two days previously, he
</p>
<p>(Wilkinson) had not assured Miro that the special purpose in
</p>
<p>securing the grant was to obtain a place of refuge ! Miro was
</p>
<p>further informed that a spy was on Morgan's track who would
</p>
<p>keep him thoroughly informed of his rival's movements and
</p>
<p>operations. He seemed determined to crush out the New
</p>
<p>Madrid settlement of Morgan, saying : " probably it will destroy
</p>
<p>the noble fabric of which we have laid out the foundations and
</p>
<p>which we are endeavoring to keep." To a general defamation
</p>
<p>of Morgan's character and of his enterprise he added his warn-
</p>
<p>ing, thus :
</p>
<p>" I am informed that Morgan intends visiting you, as soon as he shall
</p>
<p>have finished the survey of the lands conceded to him. Permit me to
</p>
<p>supplicate you, my most esteemed of friends, not to give him any knowl-
</p>
<p>ledge of my plans, sentiments or designs. It is long since he has be-

</p>
<p>come jealous of me, and you may rest assured that, in reality, he is not
</p>
<p>well affected towards our cause, but that he allows himself to be entire-
</p>
<p>ly ruled by motives of the vilest self interest, and therefore that he will
</p>
<p>net scruple, on his return to New York, to destroy me. One of the
</p>
<p>objects of Major Dunn, in seeing Gardoqui, is to sound him on this
</p>
<p>afifair, and I doubt not but that he will do so successfully."
</p>
<p>A NEW "AGENT." 195
</p>
<p>The letter to Gardoqui, referred to above as having been
</p>
<p>written by Wilkinson, has been found in the archives at
</p>
<p>Madrid. A copy was made for the State of Louisiana  in
</p>
<p>whose State library it and all other documents obtairwed by
</p>
<p>the special commission appointed for that purpose, were de-
</p>
<p>posited. Our space forbids its reproduction. It was very
</p>
<p>friendly ; full of assurances of consideration ; apparently made
</p>
<p>a full avowal of his (Wilkinson's) designs, &c. ; and yet, as we
</p>
<p>learn by the private letter to Miro, it was all false  was de-
</p>
<p>signed simply to deceive the Ministers ! How could the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor of Louisiana trust such a great rogue ? He himself was
</p>
<p>an intriguant and desired to use his " friend"' as an instrument,
</p>
<p>trusting to his own shrewdness to outwit any Yankee game
</p>
<p>which Wilkinson might attempt to play. That the Conspira-
</p>
<p>tor was playing successfully for his own interests pecuniarily
</p>
<p>is evident, for Miro, in his dispatches to Madrid, of April 11th,
</p>
<p>1789, recommended the Minister to repay Wilkinson the sum
</p>
<p>of five thousand dollars which he (W.) declared he had spent
</p>
<p>in the cause of Spain ; also that the Ministry intrust him (W.)
</p>
<p>with two thousand and five hundred dollars as asked for, with
</p>
<p>which to corrupt Marshall and Muter [see page 191] ! Miro
</p>
<p>also informs the Ministry that he had bought of W. on account
</p>
<p>of the royal treasury, 235,000 pounds of tobacco, which trans-
</p>
<p>action he requested the government to approve " on the ground
</p>
<p>that it was important to keep the General contented." The
</p>
<p>General was certainly operating to his own advantage.
</p>
<p>At this stage of the conspiracy a new agent appears on the
</p>
<p>scene  Dr. James White  a representative of Gardoqui to the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of Frankland (Sevier's "State of Franklin,") to ar-
</p>
<p>range for their transfer of allegiance to Spain. This was in
</p>
<p>answer to Sevier's letter referred to in foot note page 162. After
</p>
<p>visiting Sevier and other plotters of treason in the Cumberland
</p>
<p>region White wrote to Miro as follows, under date of April
</p>
<p>18th, 1788 :

<p>" With regard to Frankland, Don Diego Gardoqui gave me letters for
</p>
<p>the chief men of that district, with instructions to assure them that, if
</p>
<p>they wished to put themselves under the protection of Spain and favor
</p>
<p>her interests, they should be protected in their civil and political gov-

</p>
<p>ernment, in the form and manner most agreeable to them, on the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing conditions :
</p>
<p>" 1st  It should be absolutely necessary, not only in order to hold
</p>
<p>any o^ce, but also any land in Frankland, that an oath of allegiance
</p>
<p>be taken to his Majesty, the object and purport of which should be to
</p>
<p>defend his government and faithful vassals on all occasions, and against
</p>
<p>all his enemies, whoever they might be. 2d.  That the inhabitants of
</p>
<p>that district should renounce all submission or allegiance whatever to
</p>
<p>any other Sovereign or power. They have eagerly accejited these con-
</p>
<p>ditions, and the Spanish minister has referred me to your favor, pat-
</p>
<p>ronage and assistance to facilitate my operations. With regard to
</p>
<p>Cumberland, what I have said of Frankland apj)lies with equal force
</p>
<p>and truth."
</p>
<p>Miro advanced White four hundred dollars " to facilitate his
</p>
<p>dealing decently and commodiously with those he was to in-
</p>
<p>fluence," and, in his official capacity, authorised special trade
</p>
<p>arrangements to be made with the people of those districts.
</p>
<p>But, he disavowed any purpose to assist or foment the scheme
</p>
<p>of secession then acting, "on account of the good harmony
</p>
<p>which exists between his Catholic Majesty and the United
</p>
<p>States"  a qualification which sounds ludicrous when we con-
</p>
<p>sider that White was supplied with money to help on the
</p>
<p>emeutd, that special trades' regulations were extended to the
</p>
<p>people, and that the grand scheme of the Governor and Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson contemplated the robbery from the United States of the
</p>
<p>entire Kentucky region. The explanation is found in the
</p>

<p>" The answer which I have given to White, and which he is to show
</p>
<p>to the principal men of Miro and Frankland, is so framed, that, should
</p>
<p>it miscarry, it will afford no cause of complaint to the United States;
</p>
<p>but verbally, I have energetically recommended to him to use the most
</p>
<p>strenuous efforts to procure the desired separation."

<p>Nothing came of this affair. The reverse in Governor Se-

</p>
<p>vier's fortunes and the loyalty of the people to their State, pre-
</p>
<p>cluded all hopes of Spanish domination in Franklin and Cum
</p>
<p>berland. A change appears to have come over the Conspira-
</p>
<p>tors' hopes of the Kentucky people. On the 20th of January,
</p>
<p>1790, Wilkinson wrote to Miro to say that " the general per-
</p>
<p>mission to export the products of this country through the
</p>
<p>Mississippi river, on paying a duty of 15 per cent, has worked
</p>
<p>the consequences which I feared, because, every motive of dis-
</p>
<p>content having thus been removed, the political action has
</p>
<p>subsided, and to-day there is not one word said about separa-
</p>
<p>tion." And again: "The pruriency of emigration has been
</p>
<p>soothed and allayed by the spirit of trade which engrosses
</p>
<p>general attention." But, trade alone was not the most power-
</p>
<p>ful agent at work to cut asunder the Conspirators' webs and
</p>
<p>snares for betraying Kentucky. George Washington was then
</p>
<p>at the head of affairs. His influence began to permeate through
</p>
<p>all society ; the strong arm of Government began to be felt
</p>
<p>and recognised ; the head of faction and discontent disappear
</p>
<p>ed ; treason began to fear for its reward. Wilkinson wrote :
</p>
<p>" On my arrival here, I discovered a great change in tliose who had
</p>
<p>been our warmest friends. Many, who loudly repudiated all connection
</p>
<p>with the Union, now remain silent. I attribute this, either to the hope
</p>
<p>of promotion, or to the fear of punishment. According to my prognos-
</p>
<p>tic, Washington has begun to operate on the chief heads of this district.
</p>
<p>Innis has been appointed a Federal judge with an annual salary of one
</p>
<p>thousand dollars ; George Nicholas, district attorney ; Samuel McDow-
</p>
<p>ell, son of the president of the Convention, and Marshall, have been
</p>
<p>appointed to offices somewhat resembling that of Alguazil Mayor; and
</p>
<p>Pay ton Short, the brother of our charge d'affaires at Versailles, is made
</p>
<p>a custom-house officer. But he has resigned, and probably will visit
</p>
<p>you in the spring. I do not i^lace much reliance on George Nicholas
</p>
<p>and Samuel McDowell. But I know that Harry Innis is friendly to
</p>
<p>Spain and hostile to Congress, and I am authorized to say that he would
</p>
<p>much prefer receiving a pension from New Orleans than from New York.

<p>Should the King approve our design on this point, it will have to be

</p>
<p>I fear that we can rely on a few only of my countrymen, if we cannot
</p>
<p>make use of liberal donations," &c.
</p>
<p>At a later date he expressed these characterist sentiments :
</p>
<p>"I am justified in saying that Congress strongly suspects my connec-
</p>
<p>tion with you, and that it spies my movements in this section of the

</p>
<p>country. Consequently, an avowed intention on my part to induce
</p>
<p>these people here to separate from the Union, before the majority of
</p>
<p>them show a disposition to support me, would endanger my personal
</p>
<p>security, and would deprive me of the opportunity of serving you in
</p>
<p>these parts. My situation is mortally painful, because, while I abhor
</p>
<p>all duplicity, I am obliged to dissemble. This makes me extremely de-
</p>
<p>sirous of resorting to some contrivance that will put me in a position,
</p>
<p>in which I flatter myself to be able to profess myself publicly the vassal
</p>
<p>of his Catholic Majesty, and therefore to claim his protection, in what-
</p>
<p>ever public or private measures I may devise to promote the interest of
</p>
<p>the Crown."
</p>
<p>All of wliicli proved to Miro that Anglo-Saxon " manifest
</p>
<p>destiny" already had swept away forever his scheme of aggran-
</p>
<p>disement. Yet he seemed to struggle against the uncomforta-
</p>
<p>ble conclusion. He wrote under date of April 80th, 1790 :
</p>
<p>" I therefore confidently hope that, with your characteristic persever-
</p>
<p>ance, making use of the information which I give you, and which will
</p>
<p>be confirmed by your countrymen on their return, you will be able to
</p>
<p>re^^ve our political designs, by sowing broad-cast, and causing to ger-
</p>
<p>minate among your people, such ideas as will seem to you best calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to establish the conviction, that the welfare of the inhabitants of
</p>
<p>Kentucky depends, either on their forming a close and strong connec-
</p>
<p>tion with Spain, or on their seeking to better their fortune by becoming
</p>
<p>denizens of Louisiana."
</p>
<p>And, in regard to that passage of Wilkinson's letter already
</p>
<p>given, where he avows himself an object of suspicion, Miro thus
</p>
<p>caustically gave his views :
</p>
<p>" I much regret that General Washington and Congress suspect your
</p>
<p>connection with me, but it does not appear to me opportune that you
</p>
<p>declare yourself a Spaniard, for the reasons which you state. I am of
</p>
<p>opinion that this idea of yours is not convenient, and that, on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, it might have prejudicial results. Therefore, continue to dissemlle
</p>
<p>and to work as you pi-omise, and as I have indicated.''''

<p>of the General's complicity with the Spaniards to dismember
</p>
<p>the country. We could add, perhaps profitably to the reader,
</p>
<p>several pages, concerning the rise, progress and success of the
</p>
<p>South Corolina Company, but we should not be warranted in
</p>
<p>absorbing more space with this theme. Wilkinson, it was
</p>
<p>soon discovered, not only had failed to accomplish the propos-
</p>
<p>ed work in Kentucky, but was intriguing to obtain an influ-

<p>THE governor's DISAPPOINTMENT. 199
</p>
<p>ence in this new Company, in wLicli Spain found a formidable
</p>
<p>opponent to lier plans of empire. Miro, in his dispatches of
</p>
<p>May 22d, 1790, wrote to express his extreme disappointment
</p>
<p>at the rather disgraceful termination to his three years' machi-
</p>
<p>nation and intrigue. He added :
</p>
<p>" Nevertheless, I am of oiDinion tbat said Brigadier-General ought to
</p>
<p>be retained in the service of his Majesty, with an annual pension of two
</p>
<p>thousand dollars, which I have already proposed in my confidential
</p>
<p>dispatch No. 46, because the inhabitants of Kentucky, and of the other
</p>
<p>establishments on the Ohio, will not be able to undertake anything
</p>
<p>against this j^rovince, without his communicating it to us, and without
</p>
<p>his making at the same time all possible efforts to dissuade them from
</p>
<p>any bad designs against us, as he has already done repeatedly."
</p>
<p>And then concluded with a recommendation of a pension
</p>
<p>for Sebastian, "because I think it proper to treat with this in-
</p>
<p>dividual, who will be able to enlighten me on the conduct of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, and on what we have to expect from the plans of
</p>
<p>the said Brigadier-General."
</p>
<p>O most impotent conclusion ! says the reader. It is so truly,
</p>
<p>simply because the conspiracy was a failure, and it stands as
</p>
<p>such in the history of our country. But, it was a gigantic
</p>
<p>scheme of plotting against the integrity of this government, as
</p>
<p>well as against the liberties of the people ; and, despite its fail-
</p>
<p>ure, forms a very exciting and important chapter in the story
</p>
<p>of American Conspiracies. Wilkinson, the chief aid and abet-
</p>
<p>tor of the Spaniards, again comes on the stage in his connec-
</p>
<p>tion with Aaron Biirr's designs upon the old Spanish do-
</p>
<p>minion. The chapter here given will so inform the reader of
</p>
<p>his true character that the story of his connection with Burr's
</p>
<p>plans of empire will receive a new interest.
</p>
<p>The reader is not to infer that, with Kentucky's admission
</p>
<p>to the Union (1792) all danger of conspiracy in her borders
</p>
<p>passed away. The French Minister to the United States, Ge-

<p>so deeply stirred the turbulent element of our democracy that,
</p>
<p>for years after his recall, the people of the Ohio and Mississip-
</p>
<p>pi valleys were in a state of almost constant ferment. In 1794
</p>
<p>the democratic society of Lexington, Kentucky, opened a cor

<p>respondence with the people of the East for the purpose of

</p>
<p>uniting them in a crusade against Spain and against the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent and Congress for not seizing the Louisiana territory and
</p>
<p>opening the Mississippi river to free navigation A remon-
</p>
<p>strance drawn up and sent in to Congress was highly indecorous
</p>
<p>and threatening. They demanded, in peremptory words, the
</p>
<p>free navigation of the great river, alluding to their past mode-
</p>
<p>ration in not having already used the means in their power to
</p>
<p>assert their " rights"  that is, in declaring their independence
</p>
<p>and in forming a league of States west of the mountains. This
</p>
<p>was but an indication of the strong undercurrent prevailing
</p>
<p>against the General Government, and which came near to
</p>
<p>plunging this country into a war with Spain and Great Britain.
</p>
<p>To this conspiracy of the French faction and the democratic soci-

<p>the Union has passed.
</p>
<p>A second attempt was made by Carondelet, Miro's successor,
</p>
<p>to seduce the Territory of Kentucky into Spanish embraces.
</p>
<p>Carondelet dispatched Powers and Sebastian to Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>from whence Powers returned, in the Summer of 1796, with an
</p>
<p>elaborate plan of operations for carrying the State over to
</p>
<p>Spanish possession. But, though making an apparently feasi-

<p>ble and powerful appeal to the cupidity of the people, it failed.

<p>Wilkinson having been made Major-General in the place of
</p>
<p>Wayne, (who had died in December, 1796,) was approached
</p>
<p>with a bribe of ten thousand dollars ; but, though appealed to
</p>
<p>as the "Washington of the West," he did not see success
</p>
<p>enough in store to warrant a transfer of his army and services
</p>
<p>to the cause of disunion. Carondelet's attempt to seduce the

<p>State from its allegiance was the last made by the Louisiana

</p>
<p>THE WHISKEY INSURRECTION.
</p>
<p>After his tour tlirougli the Southern States, in the Spring
</p>
<p>and Summer of 1791, President Washington wrote (July 20th):
</p>
<p>" As this law (the excise) came in force only on the first of
</p>
<p>this month, little can be said of its effects, from experience ;
</p>
<p>but, from the best information I could get on my journey, re-
</p>
<p>specting its operation on the minds of the people  and I took
</p>
<p>some pains to obtain information on this point  there remains
</p>
<p>no doubt but it will be carried into effect, not only without
</p>
<p>opposition but with very general approbation in those very
</p>
<p>parts where it was foretold that it would never be submitted
</p>
<p>to by any one. It is possible, however, and perhaps not im-
</p>
<p>probable that some demagogue may start up, produce and get
</p>
<p>signed some resolutions declaratory of their disapprobation of
</p>
<p>the measure."
</p>
<p>Even while the revered Washington was thus traveling for
</p>
<p>information, and was conferring with leading men of the South,
</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, then Secretary of State, was traveling through
</p>
<p>the Northern States concerting those measures of opposition to
</p>
<p>the Federal Administration which resulted in the formation of
</p>
<p>the " Democratic" party and the election of himself and Aaron
</p>
<p>Burr to the offices of President and Vice President of the Fed-
</p>
<p>eral Government " Anti-Federal" ideas had existed to a con-
</p>
<p>siderable extent, during the first two years of Washington's
</p>
<p>term ; but, the success of his administration  the astonishing
</p>
<p>vitalization infused into the new government by him  the
</p>
<p>great confidence rapidly following upon Hamilton's financial
</p>
<p>conduct of the Treasury Department  served to allay opposi-

</p>
<p>ciled to the Administration's measures. This unity Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son secretly essayed to break. Washington he dare not assail
</p>
<p>directly ; but, his fertile mind soon conceived the ways and
</p>
<p>means of an opposition to the Federalism of Washington, Ham-
</p>
<p>ilton, Marshall, Adams and Franklin, through the medium of
</p>
<p>a party. With issues pandering to the tastes and prejudices
</p>
<p>of the masses ; with representations of bugbears of aristocratic
</p>
<p>monsters cloaked beneath the forms of law ; ,with expressions
</p>
<p>of sympathy for " the people" which he assumed the Federal-
</p>
<p>ists could not and did not feel, it was not an arduous task to
</p>
<p>excite an opposition to the policy of the men named. In May,
</p>
<p>17^1, accompanied by Madison, Jefferson visited New York
</p>
<p>to concert with Aaron Burr, Clinton and Chancellor Living-
</p>
<p>ston  the three personal opponents of Hamilton and Schuyler.
</p>
<p>With these three confirmed intriguants, Jefferson and Madison
</p>
<p>matured their plans for an open and active opposition te the
</p>
<p>Federalist party. In those men' were found the " demagogue"
</p>
<p>whom Washington feared might arise to excite animosity
</p>
<p>against his measures. To their loose principles regarding ISTa-
</p>
<p>-tional and State relations ; regarding the right of the individual
</p>
<p>to sit in judgment on the acts of the Executive and of Congress;
</p>
<p>regarding the integrity of oaths of National fealty ; regarding the
</p>
<p>right of government to enforce law and to suppress sedition  do
</p>
<p>we owe, and shall continue to owe, in a gi-eat measure, the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of treason and rebellion in our midst.
</p>
<p>Upon the assumption, by the Federal Government, of debts
</p>
<p>incurred by States in their War for independence, it became
</p>
<p>necessary to provide for the interest, and gradual liquidation
</p>
<p>of the principal, of that debt  making $826,000 to be added
</p>
<p>to 'the annual tax list in support of the Federal Government.
</p>
<p>This sum, Alexander Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasu-
</p>
<p>ry, proposed to raise by an "excise" tax on distilleries, and by
</p>
<p>additional duties on imported liquors. In confirmation of the

<p>Treasurer's recommendation, the Congress of 1791-92 enacted
</p>
<p>la\\ s imposing upon all imported spirits a duty varying from
</p>
<p>* Aaron Burr succeeded Schuyler in the U. S. Senate (1791) and was Vice Pres
</p>
<p>ident during JeflFerson's first term : Clinton was Vice President during Jefferson's
</p>
<p>eond term. Livingston was made Minister to France.
</p>
<p>ENACTMENT OF THE EXCISE BILL. 203
</p>
<p>twenty to forty cents a gallon.' The excise to be collected
</p>
<p>on domestic spirits varied, with their strength, from nine
</p>
<p>to twenty-five cents per gallon on those distilled fi-om
</p>
<p>grain, and from eleven to thirty cents when the material
</p>
<p>was molasses or any other imported product, thus allow-
</p>
<p>ing considerable discrimination in favor of the exclusively
</p>
<p>" home product" For the collection of these duties each State
</p>
<p>was made an inspection district, with its supervisor, and each
</p>
<p>district was subdivided into surveys of inspection, each with
</p>
<p>its inspector. All distillers were required to enter their distil-
</p>
<p>leries at the nearest office of inspection, with a complete de-
</p>
<p>scription of all their buildings  which buildings were to be
</p>
<p>subject to the constant examination of an inspector appointed
</p>
<p>for that purpose, who was to guage and brand the casks. All
</p>
<p>duties were to be paid before the removal of the spirits from
</p>
<p>the distillery. But, to save expense and trouble to both par-
</p>
<p>ties in this constant oversight, small stills not located in any
</p>
<p>town or village, were to pay an annual rate of sixty cents per
</p>
<p>gallon on the capacity of the still. All casks containing spirits
</p>
<p>not properly branded and certified were liable to forfeiture.
</p>
<p>These were the leading features of the law against which the
</p>
<p>Pennsylvanians proposed to protest by force of arms.
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania at that time manufactured great quantities of
</p>
<p>whiskey. Indeed, it was manufactured liberally by all the
</p>
<p>States, and became so common as a beverage as to be reckoned
</p>
<p>one of the actual necessaries of life ! Its tax, and consequent
</p>

</p>
<p>254-55. The law was very strenuously opposed in and out of Congress. The
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Legislature passed strong resolutions against its passage. Findley,
</p>
<p>Smiley, Snyder and Gallatin, members of that body and opponents of the
</p>
<p>law, were afterwards deeply implicated in the insurrection. During the debate in
</p>
<p>Congress, pending the passage of the law, a North Carolina representative, Steele,
</p>
<p>stated that the consumption of liquor in his State was greater, by ten times, than
</p>
<p>that of Connecticut  making it appear that whiskey was a prime necessity. The

<p>law finally passed the U. S. House of Representatives by a vote of.35 to 21. The
</p>
<p>feeling against it at once became very violent in North Carolina, Virginia, Mary-
</p>
<p>land and Pennsylvania  States most affected by its operations. In the latter State,
</p>
<p>there were nearly or quite five thousand public and private stills in 1790. The
</p>
<p>large majority of farmers manufactured all their marketable corn and rye into
</p>
<p>whiskey. It was at once the staple and the curse of the country.

</p>
<p>enlaancement of cost to tlie consumer, created as mucli feeling
</p>
<p>as if flour and bacon were to become agents in replenisHing an
</p>
<p>exhausted treasury. But, in Pennsylvania, west of the Alle-
</p>
<p>ghany mountains, the excitement soon assumed the tone of a
</p>
<p>menace. In that particular section the chief grain grown was
</p>
<p>rye, which, in the shape of whiskey, could be transported to
</p>
<p>the east and there be exchanged for every needed commodity.
</p>
<p>Whiskey thus became a kind of currency. To tax it was re-
</p>
<p>garded as an arbitrary assumption which it was as just and
</p>
<p>necessary to repudiate as to resist the tea and stamp tax im-
</p>
<p>posed by the British Parliament.
</p>
<p>The opposition party which was then forming seized upon
</p>
<p>Western Pennsylvania as a fertile field. The secret " demo
</p>
<p>cratic societies" vied with the emissaries of France in ex
</p>
<p>citing a spirit of opposition to the Federal Grovernment. Al
</p>
<p>though a member of Washington's cabinet, it is proven be
</p>
<p>yond all question that Jefferson's influence contributed to fos
</p>
<p>ter the spirit of license and dislike of restraint which was de
</p>
<p>veloped rapidly by the factionists, during the years 1791-94,
</p>
<p>In Western Pennsylvania the immediate pretext for opposition
</p>
<p>was the excise ; but, the disease had another instigator beside
</p>
<p>whiskey. Washington gives us the key to that other agent
</p>
<p>of disturbance  the " Democratic" societies, of which Mr. Jef-
</p>
<p>ferson ultimately became the recognized head  in a letter to
</p>
<p>Judge Jay :
</p>
<p>" 'The self-created societies who have spread themselves over this coun-
</p>
<p>try have been laboring incessantly to sow the seeds of distrust, jealousy,
</p>
<p>and, of course, discontent, hoping thereby to effect some revolution in
</p>
<p>the Government, is not unknown to you. That they have been the fo-
</p>
<p>menters of the western disturbances admits of no doubt in the mind of
</p>
<p>any one who will examine their conduct. But, fortunately, they have
</p>
<p>precipitated a crisis for which they were not prepared, and thereby un-
</p>
<p>folded views which will, I trust, effect their annihilation sooner than it
</p>
<p>might have happened. An occasion has also been afforded for the peo-

<p>ple of this country to show their abhorrence of the result, and their
</p>
<p>attachment to the constitution and laws ; for I believe that five times
</p>
<p>the number of militia that were required would have come forward in

<p>" In his speech to Congress, after praising the alacrity with which

<p>SOURCE OF THE UPRISING. 205
</p>
<p>persons came forward in sup^Dort of tlie laws and Government, Washing-
</p>
<p>ton said :
</p>
<p>" ' To every description, indeed, of citizens, let praise be given; but Jet

<p>them persevere in their affectionate vigilance over that precious deposi-
</p>
<p>tory of American happiness, the Constitution of the United States. Let
</p>
<p>them cherish it, too, for the sake of those who, from every clime, are
</p>
<p>daily seeking a dwelling in our land, And when, in the calm moments
</p>
<p>of reflection, they have retraced the origin and progress of the insurrec-
</p>
<p>tion, let them determine whether it has not been fomented by combina-
</p>
<p>tions of men, who, careless of consequences, and disregarding the uner-
</p>
<p>ring truth that those who rouse cannot always ajjpease a civil convul-
</p>
<p>sion, have disseminated from ignorance or perversion of facts suspicions,
</p>
<p>jealousies and accusations of the whole Government.' "
</p>
<p>The United States Senate, in its reply to "Washington's speech
</p>
<p>at the opening of Congress, Nov. 19th, 1794, said :
</p>
<p>" Our anxiety, arising from the licentious and open resistance of the
</p>
<p>laws in the western counties of Pennsylvania, has been increased by the
</p>
<p>proceedings of certain self-created societies relative to the laws and ad-
</p>
<p>ministration of the Government. Proceedings, in our apprehension,
</p>
<p>founded in political error; calculated, if not intended, to disorganize
</p>
<p>our Government, and which, by inspiring delusive hopes of support,
</p>
<p>have been instrumental in misleading our fellow-citizens in the scene of
</p>
<p>insurrection."
</p>
<p>We here have a hint as to the true source of the uprising
</p>
<p>against the General Government  the same source which in-
</p>
<p>spired Shays' rebellion, viz :  a set of demagogues, who, to
</p>
<p>elevate themselves to power created popular disafiection, and,
</p>
<p>by compelling the Government to defend itself, gained the title
</p>
<p>of " people's champion" by being recognised as opposed to
</p>
<p>" tyranny." We have not been without this class of men since
</p>
<p>that time, and, in the State Eights administration of 1860,
</p>
<p>witnessed the final culmination of their pernicious influence.
</p>
<p>Those chiefly instrumental in exciting the people to resist-

</p>
<p>to take the money of, wliile they were conspiring against, their
</p>
<p>employer. These men so succeeded in inflaming the public
</p>
<p>mind that combinations were formed in the four western coun-
</p>
<p>ties to resist by force the execution of the law. A convention
</p>
<p>of leading citizens assembled at Eedstone Old Fort, (now
</p>
<p>Brownsville,) July 26th, 1791, to take the subject of opposition
</p>
<p>to the law into consideration. It resolved the act of Congress
</p>
<p>to be " unequal in its operation, immoral in its effects, danger-
</p>
<p>ous to liberty, and especially oppressive to the inhabitants of
</p>
<p>the western country." Arrangements were perfected for the
</p>
<p>organization of county committees which were to assemble at
</p>
<p>Pittsburgh on the 7th of September, to concert uniform action.
</p>
<p>The committee for Washington county assembled on the 23d
</p>
<p>of August. Among its members were the County Eegistrar,
</p>
<p>the Deputy Attorney-General for the State, Judge of the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court, and other public functionaries. The spirit of this
</p>
<p>body of regulators may be infeiTcd from their declaration " that
</p>
<p>any person who had accepted, or may accept an office under
</p>
<p>Congress, in order to carry the law into effect, would be con-
</p>
<p>sidered as inimical to the interests of the country" ; and the
</p>
<p>committee " recommended the citizens of Washington county
</p>
<p>to treat every person who had accepted such office, or might
</p>
<p>thereafter accept, with contempt ; and absolutely refuse all kind
</p>
<p>of communication or intercourse with the officers, and to with-
</p>
<p>hold from them all aid, support and comfort."
</p>
<p>The general meeting of the County Committee was held at
</p>
<p>Pittsburg, Sept 7th. The day previous, Johnson, collector of
</p>
<p>revenue for Alleghany county, was seized by a body of men
</p>
<p>in disguise, shaved, tarred and feathered and ordered out of the
</p>
<p>District. This only preluded the feeling of the convention,
</p>
<p>which, beside condemning the excise and its enforcement,
</p>
<p>branched out into a general censure of the General Government,
</p>
<p>complaining of the exorbitant salaries of officers, of the unrea-
</p>
<p>sonable interest of the public debt, of the non-discrimination

<p>between original holders and transferees of that debt, of the
</p>
<p>institution of a National Bank, &c. &c. The Committee be-
</p>
<p>trayed an unmistakably seditious spirit, to which the mass of
</p>
<p>people seemed eager to respond. On the 8th, processes were

</p>
<p>obtained for the arrest of those guiltj of the outrage upon
</p>
<p>Johnson, the collector. The marshal dispatched his writs to a
</p>
<p>deputy for service, when the messenger was caught, whipped,
</p>
<p>tarred and feathered, led naked to the woods, where he was
</p>
<p>tied, blindfolded, to a tree. His horse was stolen and he left
</p>
<p>to perish miserably. But he was accidentally discovered and
</p>
<p>released. Other outrages followed  several of which were
</p>
<p>characterised by great cruelty, and, so great became the fear
</p>
<p>of violence that officers could neither be found to arrest the
</p>
<p>guilty nor to enforce the collection of the excise. The law,
</p>
<p>therefore, was a dead letter in that section during 1791, No
</p>
<p>means existed whereby the National authorities could enforce
</p>
<p>the National laws ; aside from court processes and the action
</p>
<p>of marshals no power rested with the Executive to compel
</p>
<p>obedience to the laws. Such had been the fears of the State-
</p>
<p>rights' politicians that the General Government had not yet
</p>
<p>been clothed with authority to sustain its own dignity. It was
</p>
<p>not until April, 1792, that Congress passed the National Mili-
</p>
<p>tia law which (in 1863) was, with slight modification in each
</p>
<p>State, the law of the land. That act empowered the President
</p>
<p>to call forth the militia of any State or surrounding States in
</p>
<p>case of invasion by any foreign nation or Indian tribe, or im-
</p>
<p>minent danger thereof; or in case of insurrection in any State,
</p>
<p>application heing made hy its Legislature or Executive; or, in case
</p>
<p>of combinations to resist the laws of the United States too
</p>
<p>strong to be suppressed by the ordinary course of justice such
</p>
<p>fact being first certified by the Federal Judge for the District,
</p>
<p>or by one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United
</p>
<p>States. This act was passed by the Federalists, in view, not
</p>
<p>only of the danger of resistance to the excise, but of revolu-
</p>
<p>tion which, at any moment, the French party and the " demo-
</p>
<p>cratic societies" might precipitate.
</p>
<p>A considerable modification of the excise and its enforce-
</p>
<p>ment was made by Congress at the suggestion of Hamilton,

<p>Secretary of the Treasury. The duties were diminished from
</p>
<p>one to seven cents per gallon, according to proof and kind 
</p>
<p>the highest duty being fixed at twenty-five cents per gallon
</p>
<p>and the lowest at seven cents. Small country distillers were
</p>

</p>
<p>allowed to pay a monthly instead of a yearly rate upon the
</p>
<p>capacity of their stills and to take out licenses for any period
</p>
<p>which pleased them. The offices for executing the law were
</p>
<p>so modified as to render them as little annoying as possible.
</p>
<p>These changes, however, like most compromises with an in-
</p>
<p>surrectionary spirit, produced only renewed hostility to the
</p>
<p>revenue measure. " Opposition subsided" it was said, " in
</p>
<p>several districts where it before prevailed ; and the hope was
</p>
<p>indulged that the refractory parts of Pennsylvania would grad-
</p>
<p>ually acquiesce in the execution of the law." But, it was a
</p>
<p>fallacious hope. The insurrectionists had no idea of giving in
</p>
<p>tWthe' Government. Their "democratic societies" preferred to
</p>
<p>make an issue with the administration, and used the excise as
</p>
<p>a convenient protest  -just as the secessionists of 1861-62 used
</p>
<p>the legal election of an anti-Slavery man to the Presidency as
</p>
<p>a pretext for their diabolical scheme to found a pure Slave
</p>
<p>confederacy. Albert Gallatin was one of the leading spirits in
</p>
<p>fomenting this continued hostility to the Government. He
</p>
<p>and his friends resolved that no oSicer of inspection should be
</p>
<p>permitted to exercise his functions in each county. This
</p>
<p>openly expressed antagonism induced the preparation, by Ham-
</p>
<p>ilton, of an address to the people, explaining the law and en-
</p>
<p>deavoring to reconcile the discontented to its operations.
</p>
<p>Though widely circulated and canvassed in the four counties,
</p>
<p>it failed to appease the turbulent passions aroused by whiskey
</p>
<p>and the democratic leaders. An Inspector of Kevenue obtain-
</p>
<p>ed a house, after much effort, in Washington county. Its own-
</p>
<p>er, a captain in the regular army, was entrapped by a body of
</p>
<p>regulators, and, under threats of tar, feathers and the scalping
</p>
<p>knife, and the burning of his house, was made to promise
</p>
<p>to eject the inspector, and so did. This implacable hostility to
</p>
<p>the law so painfully convinced Hamilton of the necessity for
</p>
<p>action, that, early in August, he wrote to Washington (then at
</p>
<p>Mount Vernon) urging a vigorous exertion of the law against

</p>
<p>the malcontents. "If" Washington replied, "after these (new)
</p>
<p>regulations are in operation, opposition is still experienced,
</p>
<p>and peaceable procedure is no longer effectual, the public in-
</p>
<p>terest and my duty will make it necessary to enforce the law
</p>
<p>vikginia's predominance. 209
</p>
<p>respecting this matter; and, however disagreeable this would
</p>
<p>be to me, it must nevertheless take place." Action of an im-
</p>
<p>perative character, it was soon evident, would be required.
</p>
<p>August 21st, 1792, a new Convention gathered at Pittsburg,
</p>
<p>at which Gallatin (soon after elected to the U. S. Senate) acted
</p>
<p>as secretary. It was violent in its resolutions ; counselled a
</p>
<p>determined opposition, by all " legal"(?) forms, to the enforce-
</p>
<p>ment of the law; appointed a committee to correspond with
</p>
<p>committees of a similar character that might be selected in
</p>
<p>other parts of the United States.* Such other steps were taken
</p>
<p>as were calculated to defeat the operation of the law.
</p>
<p>In view of this public and open combination, Hamilton a,t
</p>
<p>once drafted a proclamation with a design of sending it to the
</p>
<p>President for his signature. '^ George Clymer, Supervisor of
</p>
<p>the District, was ordered forthwith to repair to the survey, to
</p>
<p>"collect evidence in regard to the violence which had been
</p>
<p>committed, in order to a prosecution of the offenders," to as-
</p>
<p>certain the particulars of the meeting at Pittsbni'g, to encourage
</p>
<p>the officers of the revenue to continue their labors, &c. The
</p>
<p>Attorney General, Edmund Kandolph, of Virginia,* was con-
</p>
<p>sulted by the Secretary of the Treasury for an opinion as to
</p>
<p>whether an indictable oifence had been committed by the del-
</p>
<p>egation to that (Pittsburg) Convention, with a view of having
</p>
<p>their case brought before the Supreme Court then about to
</p>
<p>open its sessions at Yorktown, if the President thought an
</p>
<p>aiTaignment expedient^ In asking for this opinion Hamilton

</p>
<p>ory of the Republic," vol. v., chap. Ixxxi.

</p>
<p> It will be observed that the predominance of Virginia was acknowledged, by
</p>
<p>Washington's conferring two seats in the Cabinet to citizens of that State, viz.: Jef-
</p>
<p>ferson, Secretary of State, and Randolph, Attorney General. As the President
</p>
<p>also was a Virginian, erne half of the Administration was from that Commonwealth. It
</p>
<p>was many years before that extraordinary predominance was equalized  so potent

<p>was the " diplomatic" influence of Jefferson, Madison and Munroe  every one of
</p>
<p>whom became, in succession. Presidents of the United States. From 1789 to 1825

<p>(thirty-six years) Virginians occupied the Presidential chair the entire time, except

</p>
<p>expressed his conviction to Washington that " it was indis-
</p>
<p>pensable, if competent evidence could be obtained, to exert
</p>
<p>the full force of the law against the offenders," and, if the "pro-
</p>
<p>cesses of the courts were resisted  as was rather to be expect-
</p>
<p>ed  to employ those means which, in the last resort, were put
</p>
<p>in the power of the Executive." He also conceived, in his
</p>
<p>letter to Washington (Sept. 1st) submitting the form of the
</p>
<p>proclamation, that moderation enough had been shown  that
</p>
<p>it was time to assume a different tone. Eandolph, while he
</p>
<p>did not oppose the proclamation, suggested amendments to its
</p>
<p>phraseology. He wished no harm to his fi-iends  for such, it
</p>
<p>afterwards appeared, the leaders of the insurrection were. His
</p>
<p>collusion with them and with the French faction will be allud-
</p>
<p>ed to hereafter. [See note at close of this paper.] Jefferson,
</p>
<p>then visiting his Monticello estate, took no part in these pre-
</p>
<p>liminary proceedings. Washington remitted for his signature
</p>
<p>(it then being the custom for the Secretary of State to counter-
</p>
<p>sign all Executive documents) the proclamation. Jefferson
</p>
<p>gave it his countersign, and suggested the same amendments
</p>
<p>advised by Eandolph, but, in no way committed himself to any
</p>
<p>endorsement of the course determined upon by Washington.
</p>
<p>At a later stage of the proceedings, after his withdrawal from
</p>
<p>the cabinet, he condemned the "invasion" of Western Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania and the "coercion" of its citizens by Federal arms.* The
</p>
<p>Secretary of State, before the affair was settled, was, like Ran-
</p>
<p>dolph, discovered to be, if not in direct league with Gallatin
</p>
<p>entire matter of the proclamation. The opinions therein enunciated stand as a
</p>
<p>valuable precedent for procedure in all similar cases of insurrection against the
</p>
<p>General Government. Had the " Democratic" Administration of James Buchanan
</p>
<p>in 1860, been as firm and wise as the Federalist Administration of Washington, how
</p>
<p>fortunate had it been for the country !
</p>
<p>^ In a letter to Madison Jefferson said : " Hamilton says there is no possibility
</p>
<p>of getting the law executed there and that probably the evil (of insurrection) will
</p>
<p>spread. A proclamation is to be issued  another instance of my being forced to

</p>
<p>appear to approve what I have condemned uniformly from its first conception."
</p>
<p>Washington wrote to Hamilton that the reason he sent the proclamation to Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son for his signature was his desire to conform to previous practice and, " for ano-
</p>
<p>ther reason which has some weight in my mind." What that " other reason" was
</p>
<p>is, doubtless, indicated by Jefferson in the last sentence of the extract above quot-
</p>
<p>ed La his letter to Madison.

</p>
<p>and Findley, yet not inimical to them. His feeling was openly
</p>
<p>expressed, when he came into the Executive chair, by appoint-
</p>
<p>ing Gallatin his Secretary of the Treasury.
</p>
<p>The proclamation, as drawn by Hamilton and amended by
</p>
<p>Jefferson, was issued Sept. loth, 1792. After stating that op-
</p>
<p>position to laws made pursuant to an express provision of the
</p>
<p>Constitution was subversive of good order and dangerous to
</p>
<p>the very being of Government  alluding to the moderation of
</p>
<p>the Government and the disposition manifested by the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature (Congress) to obviate the causes of objection  the pro-
</p>
<p>clamation admonished and exhorted all persons to refrain and
</p>
<p>desist from all unlawful combinations to obstruct the operation
</p>
<p>of these laws, and charged the magistrates to exert their pow-
</p>
<p>ers to enforce them. Not a very bellicose mandate, truly;
</p>
<p>yet, both Jefferson and Eandolph, as we have seen, did not
</p>
<p>fiivor even this exercise of the National Executive author-
</p>
<p>ity. Hamilton's purpose was to prosecute the offenders for
</p>
<p>violation of the law, and for resistance to its officers. With
</p>
<p>this view he consulted Eandolph, as legal adviser of the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment. To the Treasurer's surprise he was informed that
</p>
<p>the Pittsburg Conventionists were not indictable ; and the first
</p>
<p>prosecution attempted, under Clymer's efforts, was abandoned
</p>
<p>fi'om evident want of authority to impress local courts with
</p>
<p>National ideas. This failure only confirmed the opposition in
</p>
<p>its contempt of a General Government which was powerless to
</p>
<p>enforce its laws and to protect its servitors. A denouement so
</p>
<p>mortifying illustrated the power of faction and the weakness
</p>
<p>of the National authority. Hamilton, however, resolved to see
</p>
<p>the law enforced, as was his duty. He conceived another plan
</p>
<p>to attain his object  ingenious and politic, but it also proved
</p>
<p>powerless, in view of the fact that no excise officers dared to
</p>
<p>exercise their functions in the disaffected region  so completely
</p>
<p>did the mob rule.
</p>
<p>Thus matters stood, up to the opening of Congress, Nov. 5th,

<p>1792, when Washington, in his speech, alluded to the failure
</p>
<p>of efforts to enforce the law. He assured Congress that " no-
</p>
<p>thing within Constitutional and legal limits" would be " want-
</p>
<p>ing to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws." " In
</p>
<p>212 THE WHISKEY INSURRECTION.
</p>
<p>fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full co-ope-
</p>
<p>ration of the other departments of the Government and upon
</p>
<p>the zealous support of all good citizens," said the President
</p>
<p>Nothing came however of efforts to enforce the law, but vi-
</p>
<p>olence and excitement. The President shrunk from the ordeal
</p>
<p>of calling in the military to assist in enforcing the law. He
</p>
<p>sought, by every means, to appease the malcontents. But
</p>
<p>even Washington's great influence did not suffice to obtain re-
</p>
<p>spect for the law or for the Government. Both were reviled
</p>
<p>with all the bitterness of vicious men conscious of power. The
</p>
<p>democratic societies were busy ; ceaselessly their leaders labor-
</p>
<p>ed to bring discredit upon the Government and to breed con-
</p>
<p>tempt for its laws. Armed men soon organized into patrols.
</p>
<p>As " regulators," these umpires visited every section of the
</p>
<p>four counties to punish every distiller who might seek to com-
</p>
<p>ply with the law, and to dispose summarily of any officer who
</p>
<p>should persist in exercising his functions. Tar and feathers
</p>
<p>were freely administered ; several houses were burned ; a local
</p>
<p>newspaper (the "Pittsburg Gazette") was pressed into the revo-
</p>
<p>lutionary service ; no man dared to defend the law for fear of
</p>
<p>violence to his person: anarchy reigned supreme. One John
</p>
<p>Holcroft, a ruffian sustained by the democratic societies, assum-
</p>
<p>ed a leadership of the armed patrol,* which, from its acts in
</p>
<p>"tinkering" the stills that would pay the law obedience, won
</p>
<p>the name of "Tom the Tinker." It became, during the Fall
</p>
<p>of the year 1793, a terror to all loyal citizens and a scourge to
</p>
<p>all officers of the Government. Holcroft was, in fact, a sans
</p>
<p>culotte of brutality and impudence, before whose power, all
</p>
<p>authority, both State and National, soon quailed. Even those
</p>
<p>leaders of the insurrection who had trifled with the law from
</p>
<p>the sordid motive of personal popularity, were affrighted at the
</p>
<p>monster which their own lawlessness had evoked.
</p>
<p>During 1794, the Administration having previously appoint-
</p>
<p>ed John Neville inspector of the district, resolved to press pro-

<p>secution against those who had failed to comply with the law

<p> being empowered by a special act of the late Congress to call
</p>
<p>the delinquents to account. Neville, a very influential man
</p>

</p>
<p>gress obeyed and assumed office to perform his duties at all
</p>
<p>hazards. Through his exertions indictments were found against
</p>
<p>thirty distillers who had neglected to enter their stills. War-
</p>
<p>rants were issued against each offender and all except one were
</p>
<p>served by the marshal, in company with Neville. On the road
</p>
<p>to the last delinquent, the marshal and inspector were met by
</p>
<p>a party of "tinkers," who at once fired upon the officers and
</p>
<p>caused them to fly for their lives. Neville returned to his fine
</p>
<p>mansion, eight miles from Pittsburg, whither he was pursued
</p>
<p>by the regulators. On the morning of July 16th, 179-1, his
</p>
<p>house was assailed, by forty of the ruffians. Neville was pre-
</p>
<p>pared for them. Having armed his negroes and others in the
</p>
<p>house, he repulsed the assailants, wounding six of them, one
</p>
<p>mortally. The ruffians withdrew and gave out that they would
</p>
<p>" finish the job"' on the morrow. The inspector appealed to
</p>
<p>two magistrates, and to the county militia commanders, for
</p>
<p>protection, but obtained for answer that they were powerless
</p>
<p>to give it. He then summoned a guard from Fort Pitt. Eleven
</p>
<p>regulars, under Major Fitzpatrick, were detailed to protect the
</p>
<p>house in case of assault. The regulators appeared on the
</p>
<p>ground July 17th, with a force numbering nearly five hundred
</p>
<p>desperadoes, all fully armed. They were under the leaderehi'|)
</p>
<p>of one McFarlane, formerly a lieutenant in the Continental
</p>
<p>army. Neville's surrender was demanded, but the inspector
</p>
<p>had escaped, foreseeing the too evident result if he remained.
</p>
<p>When informed of this, McFarlane demanded admittance to
</p>
<p>the house, with five others, to search for papers connected with
</p>
<p>Neville's office and operations. This demand was refused,
</p>
<p>when the insurgents ordered the women and children to with-
</p>
<p>draw from the house. The attack quickly followed. It was
</p>
<p>answered with spirit by the regulars. McFarlane was killed
</p>
<p>and several of his men wounded. Infuriated, the " tinkers" at
</p>
<p>once fired the outbildings. The mansion was soon in flames,
</p>
<p>when the regulars capitulated  three of them having been

</p>
<p>and the grounds around laid waste. The marshal and Ne-

<p>roughly used but not injured- The officer was dismissed only

<p>216 THE WHISKEY INSURRECTION-.
</p>
<p>after having given his solemn promise to serve no more pro-
</p>
<p>cesses west of the mountains.
</p>
<p>Neville and the marshal having taken refuge in Pittsburg,
</p>
<p>were followed by two delegates from the mob. A demand
</p>
<p>was made for the first to resign his office and for the marshal
</p>
<p>to deliver up all warrants and processes in his possession  a
</p>
<p>demand peremptorily refused. The ferment which followed
</p>
<p>was threatening. Neville would have retired to the fort, but
</p>
<p>such demonstrations were preparing for an outbreak as induc-
</p>
<p>ed the inspector and marshal to slip down the river to Mari-
</p>
<p>etta. From thence they passed over the mountains to Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia, to report an end to all peaceful measures for enforcing
</p>
<p>the law.
</p>
<p>These proceedings were followed by the wildest excitement
</p>
<p>throughout the four counties. A public meeting was called
</p>
<p>at Mingo creek meeting house, July 23d. Bradford, Bracken-
</p>
<p>ridge and Marshall were present. The first proposed to take
</p>
<p>up arms and to defy the Government. The second declared
</p>
<p>against such violence as had been shown. He preferred not
</p>
<p>to involve those friendly to the best interests of their section
</p>
<p>by endorsing the late riot. The " tinker" faction was in the
</p>
<p>ascendant, but Brackenridge succeeded in effecting a call for a
</p>
<p>convention, to be composed of delegates from all townships
</p>
<p>west of the mountains and from the adjoining counties of Ma-
</p>
<p>ryland and Virginia. This convention was to meet at Parkin-
</p>
<p>son's Ferry, on the Monongahela river, in three weeks. Dur-
</p>
<p>ing this period it was impossible for the insurrectionary spirit
</p>
<p>to remain quiet. Three days after the Mingo meeting, by
</p>
<p>Bradford's order, the mail bound east from Pittsburg was seiz-
</p>
<p>ed (July 26th). It contained, as was expected, letters to the
</p>
<p>United States authorities, implicating those most guilty in the
</p>
<p>late transactions. Bradford, Marshall and others at once issu-
</p>
<p>ed a circular to all commandants of militia in the western
</p>
<p>counties, to muster as many men as possible and to rendezvous

<p>at Braddock's Field with arms and four days' rations. The
</p>
<p>reason urged for this summons was that, in the intercepted
</p>
<p>mail, a discovery had been made which rendered a resort to
</p>
<p>action necessary. August 1st found not less than seven thou-
</p>
<p>ROBBERY OF THE MAIL. 217
</p>
<p>sand armed men at the place of rendezvous. A meeting was
</p>
<p>organized. Says Hildreth : " Colonel Cook, one of the judges
</p>
<p>of Fayette county, a member of the first popular convention
</p>
<p>held in Pennsylvania at the commencement of the Eevolution,
</p>
<p>distinguished for his opposition to the excise, having repeated-
</p>
<p>ly presided at the public meetings called to protest against it,
</p>
<p>was chosen president of the armed assembly. Albert Gallatin,
</p>
<p>the late rejected Senator,' was appointed secretary, Bradford,
</p>
<p>to whom everybody cringed, assumed the character of Major-
</p>
<p>General and reviewed the troops." The gathering, however,
</p>
<p>was a discomfiture to the wild men who had called it. It
</p>
<p>seemed to have had no specific objects, further than to inflame
</p>
<p>the military ardor of the people.
</p>
<p>The robbed mail had placed the insurrectionists in posses-
</p>
<p>sion of information regarding the " spies" in their midst. Most
</p>
<p>of these already had been expelled ; but, the meeting resolved
</p>
<p>upon exiling two more citizens of Pittsburg. The entire mob
</p>
<p>then marched into that city, were feasted by the people, and,
</p>
<p>after "a good drunk," disbanded  having done no serious
</p>
<p>harm. Only the more persistent of the mob remained in the
</p>
<p>field, resolved to punish Major Fitzpatrick, and, if possible, to
</p>
<p>seize the fort ; but, after a few days, they dispersed, having
</p>
<p>succeeded only in burning the Major's bara It was, unques-
</p>
<p>tionably, Bradford's design to excite the mob, to march upon
</p>
<p>Pittsburg, to seize the fort and munitions, and then to proclaim
</p>
<p>the "independence" of Western Pennsylvania. Against this
</p>
<p>Gallatin, Brackenridge and others protested, while the most
</p>
<p>responsible among the militia commanders positively refused
</p>
<p>to be jDarties to such a treasonable step. This temporarily frus-
</p>
<p>trated Bradford's ambitious scheme for the " secession" of the
</p>
<p>Western counties.*
</p>
<p>* Gallatin was chosen, by the " democratic" majority of the Pennsylvania Leg-
</p>
<p>islature, to the United States Senate (1794) but was denied his seat in the Senate

<p>owing to his ineligibility under the Constitution  being a foreigner of only eleven

<p>years' residence in the country.
</p>
<p> The combined operations of the democratic societies and the French faction
</p>
<p>had, by this time, brought on a crisis in the affairs of the West. Kentucky stood
</p>
<p>ready to " secede," with a view of wresting from the Spaniards all their Louisiana
</p>
<p>possessions. The French previously had landed forces at St. Mary's, Florida, to

<p>218 THE WHISKEY INSURRECTION.
</p>
<p>There followed, however, a few days in which every excess
</p>
<p>was committed by the regulators against all persons suspected
</p>
<p>of disloyalty to the insmrectionary cause. Upon all sides, even
</p>
<p>into Western Maryland and Virginia, the lawless spirit spread.
</p>
<p>No citizen dared to condemn the recent proceedings nor to
</p>
<p>sustain the cause of the National Administration. Every
</p>
<p>remaining excise officer was expelled from the country, some
</p>
<p>being badly maltreated, their houses burned and their horses
</p>
<p>and cattle stolen. All law for the moment was suspended
</p>
<p>save the law of a mob : " democratic societies" were tasting the
</p>
<p>fruit of the tree which they had planted.
</p>
<p>Where was the Governor of Pennsylvania during these law-
</p>
<p>less proceedings ? the reader asks. Miflin, like Jefferson and
</p>
<p>Randolph, was an anti-Federalist, and, like them, doubted the
</p>
<p>propriety of enforcing submission. After the outrages just
</p>
<p>enumerated he issued a circular letter to the State officers in
</p>
<p>the disaffected region in which, after having expressed his in-
</p>
<p>dignation at the lawless proceedings, he enjoined them to exert
</p>
<p>their utmost authority to suppress the tumults and to punish
</p>
<p>the offenders. Of what use was such a mandate when all
</p>
<p>avenues of law were closed ?
</p>
<p>But, in General Knox, Secretary of War ; Alexander Ham-
</p>
<p>ilton, Secretary of the Treasury ; and William Bradford, then
</p>
<p>Attorney General, Washington found advisers equal to the
</p>
<p>emergency. These members of his Cabinet, aroused by the
</p>
<p>dangers of the crisis, earnestly advised the President to exer-
</p>
<p>cise his fullest powers in suppressing the insurrection before it
</p>
<p>became a revolution. Washington resolved to use his autho-
</p>
<p>Beize that colony and to add it to the Louisiana domain. A gigantic game of com-
</p>
<p>mingled impudence, fraud and treason, hatched by the French Minister, Genet,
</p>
<p>and sustained by the democratic and Jacobin associations of the Atlantic States,
</p>
<p>was then (in the Summer of 1794) just ready to burst upon the country, bringing
</p>
<p>in its train a war with Great Britain and a division of the Confederacy. The
</p>
<p>Whiskey Insurrection was part of this gigantic game ; and Bradford, by declaring

<p>the " independence" of Western Pennsylvania, only anticipated the events which
</p>
<p>he and his confederates conceived were sure to follow. Most fortunately for the
</p>
<p>country a President occupied the chair too incorruptible, too brave, too wise for
</p>
<p>the intrigues of foreign and domestic foes. He drew the sword and treason fled
</p>
<p>abashed. We devote a paper [see " The Conspiracy of Genet"] to the intrigues

<p>of the French Minister and his emissaries.

</p>
<p>rity to the utmost, to exact obedience to the laws. Governor
</p>
<p>Miflin, and Kandolph, Secretary of State, doubted his consti-
</p>
<p>tutional right to coerce the people, and prophesied the worst
</p>
<p>results from introducing the militia of other States into Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania. But, the President's resolution was taken. The
</p>
<p>majesty of the National Government had been insulted, assail-
</p>
<p>ed and scorned : if there was any power in that Government
</p>
<p>to support its dignity the moment had arrived to assert it All
</p>
<p>constitutional quibbles and tender apprehensions of results
</p>
<p>were set aside ; only the great end to be attained was regarded.
</p>
<p>To enforce a compliance with the laws and an acknowledge-
</p>
<p>ment of the supremacy of the General Government was a duty
</p>
<p>imperative as the salvation of the country. It was a critical
</p>
<p>moment in the destiny of the republic  a sublime moment in
</p>
<p>the career of George Washington.
</p>
<p>Having become assured that Miflin could not, in his capa-
</p>
<p>city of Governor, suppress the revolt, Washington, acting un-
</p>
<p>der authority of the Militia Law of the session of 1791-92, and
</p>
<p>also by virtue of a special act of the session of 1793-94, ob-
</p>
<p>tained a certificate from one of the Supreme Judges that a
</p>
<p>state of insurrection existed in the Western counties too pow-
</p>
<p>erful for the judicial authorities to suppress. The statutory
</p>
<p>proclamation announcing this state of affairs, and requiring
</p>
<p>those in revolt to desist and disperse, was put forth Aug. 7th,
</p>
<p>followed by a requisition upon the Governors of Pennsylvania,
</p>
<p>Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey, for the aggregate of thir-
</p>
<p>teen thousand men (afterwards increased to fifteen thousand)
</p>
<p> a force deemed sufficient to cope with the large body of in-
</p>
<p>surgents which it was presumed Bradford and his co-conspira-
</p>
<p>tors could summon to the field. Brackenridge and Gallatin,
</p>
<p>alarmed at this climax to their disloyal machinations against
</p>
<p>the General Government, sought, by all means, to prevent the
</p>
<p>consummation of Washington's programme. They were aided,
</p>
<p>so far as it was good policy to offer aid, by Eandolph, then

</p>
<p> Jefferson retired from the Cabinet ofWashington at the close of the year 1793,

</p>
<p>these auti-Federalist leaders cared to assume any opew justifiea-
</p>
<p>tion of the insurrectionists. Both were patriotic enough to
</p>
<p>desire no harm to the Federal Government, but were too soli-
</p>
<p>citous for popularity with the powerful democratic societies
</p>
<p>and with the French faction to give Washington's measures
</p>
<p>their unqualified endorsement* Eandolph laid before the
</p>
<p>Cabinet a letter from Brackenridge, to a " friend in Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia," in which it was assumed that the "Western counties were
</p>
<p>not only able to defend themselves but would, in all probabili-
</p>
<p>ty, be aided by the people east of the mountains, who would
</p>
<p>offer resistance to any march of Federal troops over their soil,
</p>
<p>to be used for coercing the people. The letter writer also al-
</p>
<p>luded to the possibility of an application to Great Britain for aid,
</p>
<p>and hinted at the idea of a march upon Philadelphia ! As
</p>
<p>Brackenridge was a leading actor in, and authority among, the
</p>
<p>democratic societies these confessions indicate quite clearly the
</p>
<p>disgusting disloj^alty at the bottom of these organizations. The
</p>
<p>letter, doubtless, wa^ written for Randolphs use in the Cabinet:
</p>
<p>how powerless it was even to modify Washington's purposes
</p>
<p>was soon evident. The militia were ordered to be rcadj^ to
</p>
<p>move by the first of September (1794).
</p>
<p>To exhaust every means of amicable settlement prior to a
</p>
<p>resort to arms, Washington had delegated (August 7th) three
</p>
<p>commissioners, to proceed in advance of the army, with dis-
</p>
<p>cretionary authority to effect a settlement of difficulties. U. S.
</p>
<p>Senator from Pennsylvania Eoss ; the Attorney General Brad-
</p>
<p>ford ; and Judge Yates, of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>constituted the commission. The time allowed for a settle-
</p>
<p>ment was up to September 14th, when, if an effectual submis-
</p>
<p>sion to the laws had not taken place, the military must assume
</p>
<p>the field. As coadjutors. Governor Miflin named Chief Justice
</p>
<p>McKean and General Irving, to act on the part of the State,
</p>
<p>with the Commissioners. The Governor also issued two pro-
</p>
<p>clamations  one convening the Legislature and one addressed

<p>announcing his determination to obey the President's call for

<p>troops.'
</p>
<p>To return to the insurgents. The meeting at Mingo creek
</p>
<p>meeting house, it will be remembered, appointed a general
</p>
<p>convention of the townships of the four counties, to assemble
</p>
<p>at Parkinson's ferry, August 14th. The townships responded,
</p>
<p>with two exceptions. Delegates, to the number of two hun-
</p>
<p>dred and fifteen, were present at the appointed time. It was a
</p>
<p>very important gathering  composed largely of the most vio-
</p>
<p>lent faction, yet numbering many persons of influence who
</p>
<p>were resolved to bring matters to a peaceful settlement. Among
</p>
<p>this latter class were Gallatin and Brackenridge, both of whom
</p>
<p>were thoroughly alarmed at the portentous fortunes evidently
</p>
<p>in store for tliem. Judge Cook, president of the Mingo meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and Gallatin, secretary of that preliminary assemblage,
</p>
<p>were called to the same positions in this second convention,
</p>
<p>whose proceedings, if typified by the mottoes on the liberty
</p>
<p>pole, bid fair to be revolutionary enough. " No asylum for
</p>
<p>cowards and traitors ! " " Liberty and no excise ! " flaunted
</p>
<p>from the staff, over which floated the American flag. We may
</p>
<p>quote from Hildreth's lucid account ^ of the proceedings from
</p>
<p>this point :
</p>
<p>" A series of resolutions was oflfererl by Marshall, of which the first,
</p>
<p>against taking citizens out of the vicinity for trial, jDassed without ob-
</p>
<p>jection. The second resolution proi^osed the appointment of a commit-
</p>
<p>tee of public safety, empowered to ' call forth the resources of the West-
</p>
<p>ern country to repel any hostile attempts against the citizens.' After a
</p>
<p>speech, in which he denied any danger of hostilities, the only danger
</p>
<p>being that of legal coercion, Gallatin proposed to refer this resolution
</p>
<p>to a select committee. But, though there were many persons present whose
</p>
<p>chief object, like Gallatin's it was to extricate the peoijle from tlie dis-
</p>
<p>astrous consequences of a violent opposition to the laws, which they
</p>
<p>themselves had done so much to stimulate, no one dared to second the
</p>
<p>motion. Marshall, however, already began to waver; and he presently

<p>* The idea that he would not, beiug an anti-Federalist, obey the call was gene-
</p>
<p>rally entertained by the opponents of the Administration. The Governor was too
</p>
<p>loyal for such a course, much as he disliked Hamilton and his financial budget and
</p>
<p>Washington's executive views.

<p>oflfered to withdraw the proposition, provided a committee of sixty was
</p>
<p>appointed, with power to call another meeting, This was readily agreed
</p>
<p>to, as was also the appointment of a sub-committee of fifteen, to confer
</p>
<p>with the Federal and State commissioners. For the purpose of being
</p>
<p>remodeled, the resolutions were referred to a committee, consisting of
</p>
<p>Bradford, Gallatin, Brackenridge and Herman Husbands, then a very
</p>
<p>old man, a leader formerly among the North Carolina 'Regulators.' The
</p>
<p>determination expressed in one of these resolutions, not to submit to the
</p>
<p>excise, was struck out on Gallatin's motion. But, neither he nor any
</p>
<p>body else went so far as to advocate obedience to it. A promise to
</p>
<p>submit to the State laws was, however, inserted. This business being
</p>
<p>disposed of, the exercise of some address secured a dissolution of the
</p>
<p>meeting, the assembly of the committee of sixty being fixed for the 2d
</p>
<p>of September.
</p>
<p>" A few days after, as had been arranged, the committee of fifteen
</p>
<p>met the commissioners at Pittsburg (Aug. 21). Among the members
</p>
<p>of this committee were Bradford, Marshall, Cook, Gallatin and Bracken-
</p>
<p>ridge, the whole, except Bradford, being inclined to an accommodation.
</p>
<p>[A CKindidate for Congress for the Pittsburg district, in his anxiety to
</p>
<p>secure votes, Brackenridge had hitherto gone so far as to make the in-
</p>
<p>surgents believe he was on their side. But, he was well aware of the
</p>
<p>folly and hopelessness of their cause, and at bottom was not less anx-
</p>
<p>ious than Gallatin to escape out of the present dilemma. In a book
</p>
<p>which he afterwards published, he excused the part he had taken as
</p>
<p>necessary to protect himself against the violence of the insurgents.] The
</p>
<p>demands of the commissioners were exceeding moderate. They requir-
</p>
<p>ed from the committee of sixty an explicit declaration of their determi-
</p>
<p>nation to submit to the laws, and a recommendation to the citizens at
</p>
<p>large to submit also, and to abstain from all opposition, direct or indi-
</p>
<p>rect, and especially from violence or threats against the excise ofiicers
</p>
<p>or the complying distillers. Primary meetings were required to be
</p>
<p>held to test the sense of the citizens in these particulars. Should satis-
</p>
<p>factory assurances be given on or before the fourteenth of September,
</p>
<p>the commissioners promised a suspension till the next July of all pro-

<p>good faith, a final pardon and oblivion of all such offenses.
</p>
<p>" The committee of fifteen pronounced these terms reasonable ; and,
</p>
<p>to give more time to carry out the arrangement, they agreed to antici-
</p>
<p>pate by four days the calling together of the committee of sixty. Mean-
</p>
<p>while a report spread that the conferees had been bribed ; indeed, that
</p>
<p>charge was made in express terms in a letter of ' Tom the Tinker' to the
</p>
<p>Pittsburg Gazette, which the printer, as was the case with other com-
</p>
<p>munications of that anonymous personage, did not dare to omit to pub-

<p>lish. WTiile the members of the committee of sixty were collecting at
</p>
<p>Brownsville, the place appointed for the meeting, an armed party of
</p>
<p>hoi^e and foot entered the town with drums beating. The friends of
</p>
<p>submission were so intimidated that, but for Gallatin, they would have
</p>
<p>aliandoned all thoughts of urging an accommodation. Bradford insist-
</p>
<p>ed on taking the question at once : but, by the exercise of some address,
</p>
<p>the matter was postponed till the next day ; meanwhile the armed party
</p>
<p>were persuaded to return to their homes.
</p>
<p>" Gallatin opened the business the next morning in a speech, in which
</p>
<p>the motives to submission were judiciously urged. He was followed by
</p>
<p>Brackenridge, who now came out strongly on the same side. Bradford,
</p>
<p>in an extravagant harangue, urged continued resistance, and the organ-
</p>
<p>ization of an independent State. Not daring to expose themselves by
</p>
<p>an open vote, the friends of submission had prevailed that the decision
</p>
<p>should be by secret ballot. They were thus enabled "to carry, by a very
</p>
<p>lean majority, a resolution that it would be for the interest of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple to accede to the terms offered by the commissioners. But, they did
</p>
<p>not dare to propose what the commissioners had demanded, a pledge
</p>
<p>from the members of the committee themselves to submit to the law,
</p>
<p>and arrangements for obtaining, in primary meetings, a like pledge
</p>
<p>from the individual citizens. After appointing a new committee of
</p>
<p>conference, the committee of sixty adjourned without day.
</p>
<p>"The new conferees asked of the commissioners, Sept. 1, further delay
</p>
<p>till the 10th of October, to ascertain the sense of the people ; but, this
</p>
<p>was declined as being beyond their authority. They now required that
</p>
<p>meetings should be held in the several townships on the eleventh of
</p>
<p>September, any two or more members of the late committee of sixty, or
</p>
<p>any justice of the peace to preside, at which the citizens should vote yea
</p>
<p>or nay on the question of submitting to and supporting the law, all
</p>
<p>those voting in the aflBrmative to sign a declaration to that effect, which
</p>
<p>was to secure them an amnesty as to past offenses. The third day after
</p>
<p>the vote, the presiding officers were to assemble in their respective
</p>
<p>county court houses, to ascertain the number of votes both ways, and
</p>
<p>to declare their opinion in writing whether the submission was so gen-

<p>the papers to be forwarded to the commissioners at Union Town by the
</p>
<p>sixteenth of the month.
</p>
<p>"Meetings were held under this arrangement in many of the town-
</p>
<p>ships, but the result, on the whole, was quite unsatisfactory. Most of
</p>
<p>the more intelligent leaders were careful to provide for their own safety
</p>
<p>by signing the required submission ; but many of those who had taken
</p>
<p>no active part in resisting the law refused to attend, or to pledge them-
</p>
<p>selves to obedience. As they had committed no offense, such was their
</p>
<p>argument, they ought not to be required to submit  as if winking at
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>224 THE "WHISKEY INSURRECTION".
</p>
<p>the violation of law and neglecting to assist in its enforcement were not
</p>
<p>among the greatest of offenses ! In some townshijDs the meetings were
</p>
<p>violently broken up and the ijajjers torn to pieces. Such was the case
</p>
<p>in the town in which Findley resided, who, it seems, was personally in
</p>
<p>suited on the occasion. From Allegany county no returns were receiv-
</p>
<p>ed. The judges of the vote in Westmoreland expressed the opinion
</p>
<p>that excise iusjiection offices could not be safely established in that
</p>
<p>county. In the other two counties the exj^ression of any direct oijinion
</p>
<p>was avoided; but these counties had always been more violent than
</p>
<p>"Westmoreland. The better disposed part of the population had begun
</p>
<p>to form associations for mutual defense, and the opinion among them
</p>
<p>was quite universal that the presence of the troops was absolutely
</p>
<p>necessary."
</p>
<p>This result of their mission left the President no other course
</p>
<p>than to use the strong arm of military power. The troops re-
</p>
<p>quired had been furnished with alacrity, by the several Gov-
</p>
<p>ernors. Those from Pennsylvania were last in the field. The
</p>
<p>Legislature had offered bounties for volunteers, while Miflin
</p>
<p>made the tour of the lower counties  then the most populous
</p>
<p>in the State  where, by his remarkable popular eloquence, he
</p>
<p>soon obtained recruits enough to fill his quota. None were
</p>
<p>more astonished than the " democratic societies" to see the
</p>
<p>Governor thus "up in arms against his own people and party,"
</p>
<p>But, the shrewd Governor was as patriotic as politic, and
</p>
<p>chose the right course at the right moment. The old war-horse
</p>
<p>of the Eevolution, General Daniel Morgan, led the Virginia
</p>
<p>forces ; General William Smith, then a member of Congress
</p>
<p>from Baltimore, led those of Maryland. These two latter
</p>
<p>bodies composed the " left wing" of the army, and assembled
</p>
<p>at Cumberland, Maryland, from whence they were to mo\ e
</p>
<p>across the mountains by Braddock's road. The troops of Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania and New Jersey, composing the " right wing", and led
</p>
<p>by Governors Miflin and Howell, rendezvoused at Bedford.

<p>Virginia  "Light-Horse Harry" of the Eevolution. Washing-
</p>
<p>ton and Hamilton also determined to proceed with the army.
</p>
<p>This formidable assertion of authority sent consternation
</p>
<p>into the ranks of the insurgents  few of whom cared to court
</p>
<p>the ordeal of blood to defend their right to free whiskey. But,
</p>
<p>prior to the actual appearance of the troops in the field, many

</p>
<p>evidences of the "tinkers" became visible, even to the east of
</p>
<p>tlie mountains. At Carlisle the two Pennsylvania commission-
</p>
<p>ers had stopped, to require bonds of a party who had run up
</p>
<p>a barrel of whiskey on the liberty pole, as an insult and a me-
</p>
<p>nace to the commission. The Judge and the General had
</p>
<p>scarcely left town when a large body of armed men rode into
</p>
<p>Carlisle to capture the two commissioners. Finding them gone,
</p>
<p>the mob proceeded to burn them in efl&gy, and gave many
</p>
<p>other evidences of the existence of " democratic societies" in
</p>
<p>that section. Similar feeling betrayed itself in several counties
</p>
<p>of Maryland, but it was suppressed by a volunteer corps of
</p>
<p>dragoons, who seized and imprisoned in the Hagerstown jail
</p>
<p>more than a hundred of the malcontents.
</p>
<p>But, these spasms of the disease were of brief duration. The
</p>
<p>desire for peace became so strong that a second convention was
</p>
<p>called, by the efforts of Gallatin, Brackenridge and Findley, at
</p>
<p>Parkinson's Ferry, Oct. 2d, at which the declaration was made
</p>
<p>that the failure to obtain written pledges, as stipulated by the
</p>
<p>commissioners, was owing chiefly to the want of time and of
</p>
<p>information. The mass of voters, it was stated, assuming their
</p>
<p>innocence of any hostile acts against the Government, argued
</p>
<p>that to sign the required pledge was an implication of the ex-
</p>
<p>istence of their guilt which they could not consent to sustain.
</p>
<p>Hence, the failure of the commissioners' proposals. This de-
</p>
<p>claration and other messages of contrition were confided by the
</p>
<p>assembly to Findley and a person named Eedick, who were
</p>
<p>ordered to hasten over the mountains, to stay, if possible, the
</p>
<p>march of the army against the Western counties. The two
</p>
<p>delegates lost not a moment in their embassy. They met the
</p>
<p>right wing of the Federal forces at Carlisle, where Washington
</p>
<p>then was. The President received the embassadors but failed
</p>
<p>to accept their proffers of peace. He advised Findley to re-
</p>
<p>turn and reassemble the convention, that, if a settlement really
</p>
<p>was desired, the insurrectionists might have it by sueing in

</p>
<p>proper terms and by giving full assurances of entire submis-
</p>
<p>sion to the laws. The troops were ordered forward to the ren-
</p>
<p>dezvous at Bedford, where, the President stated, he would re-
</p>
<p>ceive the expected answer of the convention.
</p>
<p>226 THE WHISKEY INSURRECTION".
</p>
<p>Findley, inspired witli the zeal of fear, succeeded in exciting
</p>
<p>a like apprehension among all of the most intelligent of those
</p>
<p>who had participated in the insurrection, or who had affiliated
</p>
<p>with the democratic societies. The convention reassembled
</p>
<p>October 24tk " Eesolutions were passed," said Hildreth, "de-
</p>
<p>claring the competency of the civil authorities to enforce the
</p>
<p>laws, recommending all delinquents who had not already se-
</p>
<p>cured an indemnity to surrender for trial, and expressing the
</p>
<p>conviction that offices of inspection might be opened with safe-
</p>
<p>ty, and that the excise duties would be paid. Findley hasten-
</p>
<p>ed back with these resolutions, but before he reached the army
</p>
<p>the President had already returned to Philadelphia. Hamil-
</p>
<p>ton, however, remained behind, and was believed to act as the
</p>
<p>President's deputy. The troops crossed the Alleganies in a
</p>
<p>heavy rain, up to their knees in mud, and not without severe
</p>
<p>suffering, which occasioned in the end a good many deaths.
</p>
<p>The two wings formed a junction at Union Town, and, as they
</p>
<p>advanced into the disaffected counties, the re-establishment of
</p>
<p>the authority of the law became complete. Having arrived at
</p>
<p>Parkinson's Ferry, Lee issued a proclamation, Nov. 8th, con-
</p>
<p>firming the amnesty to those who had entitled themselves to
</p>
<p>it, and calling upon all the inhabitants to take the oath of al-
</p>
<p>legiance to the United States.
</p>
<p>" A few days after, arrangements having been previously
</p>
<p>made for it, there was a general seizure, by parties detached
</p>
<p>for that purpose, of persons supposed to be criminally concern-
</p>
<p>ed in the late transactions. But, as those against whom the
</p>
<p>strongest evidence existed had either fled the country or taken
</p>
<p>advantage of the amnesty, this seizure fell principally on per-
</p>
<p>sons who, without taking an active part, had been content with
</p>
<p>encouraging and stimulating others. Many were dismissed at
</p>
<p>once for want of evidence ; and of those who were bound over
</p>
<p>for trial at Philadelphia, the greater part were afterwards
</p>
<p>acquitted. Among those thus bound over, Brackenridge

</p>
<p>was one ; but, instead of being tried, he was used as a wit-
</p>
<p>ness against the others. These people complained loudly
</p>
<p>of the inconvenience to which they had been put, and of the
</p>
<p>harsh treatment which, in some few cases, had been experi-

<p>enced at the hands of the military parties by whom the arrests
</p>
<p>had been made. But, such evils were only the natural conse-
</p>
<p>quences of lying quietly by and allowing resistance to the laws
</p>
<p>to aggravate itself into rebellion."
</p>
<p>Morgan, with a portion of the Virginia troops remained in
</p>
<p>the disaffected region during the winter, as a military guard to
</p>
<p>secure implicit obedience to the laws. Of those seized, as in
</p>
<p>the case of those implicated in Shays' Eebellion, none were
</p>
<p>made to answer with their lives for their crime against the
</p>
<p>Government. The great maj ority were found guilty of treason,
</p>
<p>upon trial before the Circuit Court at Philadelphia ; but, ex-
</p>
<p>ercising his prerogative of pardon, Washington ultimately
</p>
<p>bade even those most guilty to "go, and sin no more."
</p>
<p>This insurrection illustrated two things, namely  first, the
</p>
<p>revolutionary nature of all asserted rights of a State in contra-
</p>
<p>distinction with, and as supreme to, the rights of the Union ; and,
</p>
<p>second, the power of the National Executive to enforce the
</p>
<p>National laws. The country breathed more freely ; the cause
</p>
<p>of the Constitution became more fixed ; the assumed suprema-
</p>
<p>cy of the State retreated to the background, only to be occa-
</p>
<p>sionally dragged forth by malcontents, nullificators and seces-
</p>
<p>sionists, for the same end as in 1794  for humiliating the Na-
</p>
<p>tional authority. Could the country always be blessed with a
</p>
<p>President as wise as George "Washington it would have but
</p>
<p>little to apprehend from the element of insurrection which,
</p>
<p>confounding liberty with license, has become one of the fixed
</p>
<p>&cts in our democratic society.

<p>October Slst, 1794. This minister, having succeeded Genet, inherited much of that
</p>
<p>intermeddler's contempt for the Federal Government. As an intriguant he was
</p>
<p>more subtle, less impudent but not less unscrupulous. He was at once a spy and
</p>
<p>an agent to create a division among our people, by which to advance the interests
</p>
<p>of France then still in the throes of ita ever memorable revolution. The dispatch
</p>
<p>228 THE "WHISKEY INSURRECTION".
</p>
<p>alluded to -was caught in transitu on the " Jean Bart," a French privateer, over-
</p>
<p>hauled in the British Channel by a British frigate. According to instructions the
</p>
<p>dispatch box was cast into the sea, when its capture became imminent ; but, an
</p>
<p>Englishman  a captain of a merchantman captured by the " Jean Bart"  suspect-
</p>
<p>ing the character of the contents, leaped overboard and sustained the box uutil it
</p>
<p>was secured by a boat from the frigate. The important and interesting nature of
</p>
<p>the dispatch caused the British Government to send it to their minister to the
</p>
<p>United States, by whom it was brought to the attention of the Administration.
</p>
<p>That the disclosure astonished and angered Washington is not strange. The Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, though aware of the incendiary nature of French influence, was not prepared
</p>
<p>to learn that a member of his own Cabinet was in league with the anarchical fac-
</p>
<p>tion, and plotting for his (Washington's) humiliation. We quote from the docu-
</p>
<p>ment such passages as throw light upon the secret influences at work, during the
</p>
<p>early stages of the Republic, to unsettle the public mind and to plunge the country
</p>
<p>into a foreign war. Fauchet wrote :
</p>
<p>" Citizen  1. The measures which prudence prescribes to me to take with re-
</p>
<p>spect to my colleagues, have still presided in the digesting of the dispatches signed
</p>
<p>by them, which treat of the insurrection of the western countries, and of the re-
</p>
<p>pressive means adopted by the Government. I have allowed them to be confined
</p>
<p>to the giving of a faithful, but naked recital of events. The reflections therein
</p>
<p>contained scarcely exceed the conclusions easily deducible from the character
</p>
<p>assumed by the public prints. I have reserved myself to give you, as far as I am
</p>
<p>able, a key to the facts detailed in our reports. When it comes in question to
</p>
<p>explain, either by conjectures or by certain data, the secret views of a foreign
</p>
<p>government, it would be imprudent to run the risk of indiscretions, and to give
</p>
<p>one's self up to men, whose known partiality for that government, and similitude
</p>
<p>of passions and interests with its chiefs, might lead to confidences, the issue of
</p>
<p>which is incalculable. Besides, the precious confessions of Mr. Randolph alone
</p>
<p>throw a satisfactory light upon every thing that comes to pass. These I have not
</p>
<p>yet communicated to my colleagues. The motives already mentioned lead to this
</p>
<p>reserve, and still less permit me to open myself to them at the present moment.
</p>
<p>I shall then endeavor. Citizen, to give you a clew to all the measures, of which the
</p>
<p>common dispatches give you an account, and to discover the true causes of the ex-
</p>
<p>plosion, which it is obstinately resolved to repress with great means, although the

</p>
<p>state of things has no longer any thing alarming.
</p>
<p>" 2. To confine the present crisis to the simple question of the excise, is to reduce
</p>
<p>it far below its true scale ; it is indubitably connected with a general explosion for
</p>
<p>some time prepared in the public mind, but which this local and precipitate erup-
</p>
<p>tion will cause to miscarry, or at least check for a long time. In order to see the
</p>
<p>real cause, in order to calculate the effect and the consequences, we must ascend
</p>
<p>to the origin of the parties existing in the State, and retrace their progress."
</p>
<p>He then proceeds to show that the " parties" existing are Federalists and anti-
</p>
<p>Federalists  the first aiming to monarchm the Government and the latter to demo-
</p>
<p>cratise it. The explosion of the Whiskey Insurrection he declared had heea pre-
</p>
<p>mature ; unfortunately for the latter class it had served only to strengthen the Ad-
</p>
<p>ministration. Monsieur then descants upon Hamilton's financial schemes, which
</p>
<p>he assumed were but gigantic stock-jobbing, creating an aristocracy of speculatori
</p>
<p>eapecially antagonistic to the agricultural interests of the country*. In these fiuan-
</p>
<p>RANDOLPH AND THE FRENCHMAN. 229
</p>
<p>cial projects the emissary of Robespierre beheld the further fruition of aristocratic
</p>
<p>ideas. He proceeds in his luminous essay :
</p>
<p>"8. In the mean time, the popular societies are formed;* political ideas con-
</p>
<p>centrate themselves ; the patriotic party unite, and more closely connect them-
</p>
<p>Belves ; they gain a formidable majority in the Legislature ; the abasement of
</p>
<p>commerce, the slavery of navigation, and the audacity of England strengthen it;
</p>
<p>a concert of declarations and censures against the government arises, at which the
</p>
<p>latter is even itself astonished."
</p>
<p>After elaborating on the discontent prevailing, upon the enormity of the ofiFenses
</p>
<p>of the party in power, the minister recurs to the excise revolt as a further evidence
</p>
<p>of the tjTanny of the Government and of its unjust impositions. He adds :
</p>
<p>" But why, in contempt of treaties, are they left to bear the yoke of the feeble
</p>
<p>Spaniard, as to the Mississippi for upwards of twelve years? Since when has an
</p>
<p>agricultural people submitted to the most unjust capricious law of a people explor-
</p>
<p>ers of the precious metals ? Might we not suppose that Madrid and Philadelphia
</p>
<p>mutually assisted in prolonging the slavery of the river; that the proprietors of a
</p>
<p>barren coast are afraid lest the Mississippi, once opened, and its numerous branch-
</p>
<p>es brought into activity, their fields might become deserts ; and, in a word, that
</p>
<p>commerce dreads ha\ing rivals in those interior parts as soon as their inhabitants
</p>
<p>Bhall cease to be subjects ? This last supposition is but too well founded ; an in-
</p>
<p>fluential member of the Senate, Mr. Izard, one day in conversation undisguisedly
</p>
<p>announced it to me."
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to follow the loquacious intriguant through all his allusions and
</p>
<p>illusions. That portion which most interests our readers we subjoin :
</p>
<p>" It appears, therefore, that these men, with others unknown to me, all having
</p>
<p>without doubt Randolph at their head, were balancing to decide on their party.
</p>
<p>Two or three days before the proclamation was published, and of course before
</p>
<p>the Cabinet had resolved on its measures, Mr. Randolph came to see me with an
</p>
<p>air of great eagerness, and made to me the overtures, of which I have given you
</p>
<p>an account in my No. 6. Thus, with some thousands of dollars, the republic could
</p>
<p>have decided on civil war or peace ! Thus the consciences of the pretended patri-
</p>
<p>ots of America have already their price ! It is very true that the certainty of
</p>
<p>these conclusions, painful to be drawn, will forever exist in our archives. What
</p>
<p>will be the old age of this Government, if it is thus early decrepid ?"

<p>Dispatch " No. 6" referred to did not help Mr. Randolph's case, nor serve to
</p>
<p>create additional sympathy for the democratic societies. It was written in August,
</p>
<p>and, according to Pauchet's owu confessions afterwards extorted in Randolph's de-
</p>
<p>fense, contained the following piece of news :
</p>
<p>" Scarce was the commotion known (i. e. the uprising in the West during July
</p>
<p>and August, 1794) when the Secretary of State (Randolph) came to ray house.
</p>
<p>All his countenance was grief. He requested of me a private conversation. ' It
</p>
<p>is all over,' he said to me : 'a civil war is about to ravage our unhappy country.
</p>
<p>Four men, by their talents, their influence, their energy, may save it. But, debt-

<p>was impossible for me to render a satisfactory answer. You knowing my want of
</p>
<p>power, and my defect of pecuniary means, I shall withdraw myself from the afiiiir
</p>
<p>by some common place remarks, and by throwing myself on the pure and disin-
</p>
<p>terested principles of the republic."

<p>" Four men by their talents may save it." Who were they ? Miflin, Dallas,
</p>
<p>Randolph and Jefferson !
</p>
<p>A precious mass of evidence, truly, to come to light at that crisis, when Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, by the happy issue of his proceedings against the malcontents by the in-
</p>
<p>creased confidence felt in public credit  was more than ever trusted. " Jefferson,
</p>
<p>on whom the patriots cast their eyes to succeed the President * * prudently retired,
</p>
<p>&c." And Mr. Bandolph also " prudently retired," when Washington placed the
</p>
<p>dispatch in the hands of his until then trusted adviser for explanations. Randolph
</p>
<p>retired from the Cabinet, not like Jefferson " in order to avoid making a figure
</p>
<p>against his inclinations," but to write out his Vindication, to become the enemy
</p>
<p>of George Washington and the adviser of " the patriots" who were " casting their
</p>
<p>eyes" toward Jefferson as Washington's successor.
</p>
<p>In Randall's " Life of Jefferson," vol. ii., chapters iii., iv., v., will be found the
</p>
<p>best presentment yet made of the anti-Federalist view of the " Whiskey War" and
</p>
<p>the aff\iir of the Fauchet dispatch. Mr. Randall's defense of the democratic socie-
</p>
<p>ties, and his chief points of exculpation of Mr. Jefferson for the part he played in
</p>
<p>fomenting the public disquietude, rest upon the absurd assumption of the monar-
</p>
<p>chical tendency of the Federal party. The biographer evidently proceeds upon the

<p>theory that, because Jefferson hated Hamilton therefore it is necessary for Jeffer

</p>
<p>French intrigue in the United States during the early ad-
</p>
<p>ministrations enters largely into the history of that period. In
</p>
<p>fact, it ramified through the entire structure of our Government
</p>
<p>and our society, being at once the cause of alarm among Fed-
</p>
<p>eralists and the source of partisan strength to their opponents.
</p>
<p>To Washington it became a constant agent of unhappiness ;
</p>
<p>to his successor, Adams, it contributed one unceasing flow of
</p>
<p>mortifying and aggravating circumstances ; to Jefferson it of-
</p>
<p>fered less annoyance simply because he was of the French par-
</p>
<p>ty, because the question of neutrality had been settled by
</p>
<p>Washington and Adams, and because another object of the in-
</p>
<p>trigue  the dispossession of Spain in the Louisiana territory 
</p>
<p>was quieted by the cession of that territory to Napoleon and
</p>
<p>its purchase by the United States' Government ; to Madison it
</p>
<p>only ruffled the surface of affairs, though the pressure of the
</p>
<p>French faction had much to do in drawing this country into the
</p>
<p>war against Great Britain in 1812-14
</p>
<p>France having contributed by arms and means to the inde-
</p>
<p>pendence of the American States, her ministers to this country
</p>
<p>assumed a creditor's right in the premises, acting arrogatingly
</p>
<p>to our Government and patronizingly to the people. Even
</p>
<p>before the adoption of the Constitution the seeds of French
</p>
<p>disquietude appeared in our midst. Jefferson, when Minister
</p>
<p>to France, contributed to the overthrow of Louis XVI.  the
</p>
<p>Monarch whose benefactions had sustained the Colonies in their
</p>
<p>struggle against British tyranny ; he became a coadjutor of the
</p>
<p>revolutionists, opening his doors freely to the Jacobins and

</p>
<p>large class on this side of the sea, who entered into the foreign
</p>
<p>revolution with more than the ardor of friends  with the fren-
</p>
<p>zy of partizans ; and when " Citizen Genet" came to this coun-
</p>
<p>try, in April, 1793, as the accredited representative of the
</p>
<p>French "Eepublic," then under the reign of the Girondius, he
</p>
<p>found such a welcome as scarcely could have been extended
</p>
<p>to Lafayette' had he reappeared on our shores. He landed at
</p>
<p>Charleston, S. G, April 9th, 1793, where his reception was en-
</p>
<p>thusiastic on the part of the State authorities and the people ;
</p>
<p>his journey to Philadelphia was one continued ovation. The
</p>
<p>country was then aglow with hopes of liberty for Europe which
</p>
<p>the French revolution had excited. In that revolution they
</p>
<p>beheld a regeneration of society and of governments ; hence,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding its phases of horror, infidelity and brutal ex-
</p>
<p>cesses, it was regarded as the messenger of a new order of things.
</p>
<p>Genet arrived on our shores to find France the guest of Amer^
</p>
<p>lean homes, from the seaboard to the frontier. He was f^ted,
</p>
<p>not as the man but as the Minister from the regenerated na-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>With his coming came trouble indeed to the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of Washington. Scarcely had Genet arrived in Charles-
</p>
<p>ton and received the ovations of Governor Moultrie and his
</p>
<p>people, ere he began the issue of commissions, for privateers, to
</p>
<p>American citizens. France having declared war against Great
</p>
<p>Britain, Genet was instructed, it afterwards appeared, to draw
</p>
<p>this country into co-operation with its old ally against its old
</p>
<p>foe. The Convention had proceeded, with singular indiffer-
</p>
<p>ence to American rights, to clothe their representative with
</p>
<p>extraordinary powers. He not only commissioned American
</p>
<p>citizens, but at once authorised French consuls throughout
</p>
<p>the United States to constitute themselves a court of admiralty
</p>
<p>for adjudicating upon such prizes as French cruizers, or those
</p>
<p>operating under his commissions, might bring into American
</p>
<p>ports ! This subhme assurance ere long was aggravated by

<p>* Lafayette was then a fugitive from France. As the head of the army he had
</p>
<p>protested against the reign of terror and Jacobinical overthrow of the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion. He had to flee before the storm and soon found himself in an Austrian dun-
</p>
<p>geon  a victim of the Jacobinical societies,

</p>
<p>Genet's continued refractoriness, until, at length, he presumed
</p>
<p>to despise and defy "Washington's authority and threatened to
</p>
<p>appeal from him to the people ! He actually menaced the Ex-
</p>
<p>ecutive with threats of a revolution, if his (Genet's) proceed-
</p>
<p>ings were countermanded. The emissary should have been
</p>
<p>sent in chains to France,
</p>
<p>News arrived in New York of the declaration of war by
</p>
<p>France against Great Britain five days prior to the French
</p>
<p>minister's appearance in Charleston. This news gave Wash-
</p>
<p>ington much uneasiness. He hastened from Mt. Yemon to
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, summoning a Cabinet council, determined to
</p>
<p>place this country in an attitude of strict neutrality. Such an
</p>
<p>attitude, in the face of the powerful sympathy existing in all
</p>
<p>the States for France and hate of Great Britain, was calculated
</p>
<p>to excite Gallic partizans fiercely. The decree of neutrality
</p>
<p>issued April 22d, 1793, to find anything but a favorable recep-
</p>
<p>tion at the hands of those fiiendly to the revolutionists. The
</p>
<p>proclamation warned citizens to avoid all acts not in consonance
</p>
<p>with an im-partial neutrality toward the belligerents ; declaring
</p>
<p>the resolution of the Federal Government not only " not to in-
</p>
<p>terpose on behalf of those who might expose themselves to
</p>
<p>punishment or forfeiture under the law of nations by aiding
</p>
<p>or abetting either of the belligerents, but to cause all such acts
</p>
<p>done within the jurisdiction of the United States to be prose-
</p>
<p>cuted in the proper courts." Genet's proceedure in issuing
</p>
<p>commissions, and in constituting prize courts, was, therefore,
</p>
<p>in contempt of the Administration ; but, sustained by a pow-
</p>
<p>erful section of society, a thorough enthusiast in defying all
</p>
<p>"tyranny" (and every step taken to circumvent his machina-
</p>
<p>tions was regarded as a ' tyrannical assumption of authority')
</p>
<p>reckless of results, the apostle of revolution pursued his auda-
</p>
<p>cious game without ceasing. Scarcely a day passed in which
</p>
<p>some act was not committed calculated to annoy the National
</p>
<p>authorities.

<p>Bat, we cannot here trace the course of this madcap, in all
</p>
<p>its diplomatic and undiplomatic windings. The record of his
</p>
<p>intrigues, his audacity, his impertinence, his folly would fill a
</p>
<p>volume. To one immediate result of his labors we may recur.
</p>
<p>234: CONSPIRACY OF GENET.
</p>
<p>In the Philadelphia National Gazette^ edited by Philip Freneau,
</p>
<p>clerk in the State Department, Genet and the " opposition"
</p>
<p>found a most available instrument of incendiarism and disaf-
</p>
<p>fection. Previous to the arrival of the French embassador it
</p>
<p>had been distinguished for its "war on the monocrats," as Jef
</p>
<p>ferson approvingly termed it, and day by day grew in viru-
</p>
<p>lence toward the Administration in whose employ he remained.
</p>
<p>His aim was especially to shake confidence in Hamilton's
</p>
<p>financial measures and to alarm the people of the monarchical
</p>
<p>tendencies of the Government. Washington, as the head of
</p>
<p>Government, was not spared. His name and measures were
</p>
<p>traduced ; his integrity questioned ; his devotion to liberty
</p>
<p>derided. So virulent became its course after the arrival of
</p>
<p>Genet, that the President, in an interview with the Secretary
</p>
<p>of State, insmuated that Freneau ought to be discharged from
</p>
<p>Government employ, not alone because of his base defamation
</p>
<p>of the Administration, but for the additional reason that, in
</p>
<p>his position as translating clerk, Freneau obtained much secret
</p>
<p>and valuable information which he used to the detriment of
</p>
<p>the State The malignant journalist was not discharged nev-
</p>
<p>ertheless. " That^ I would not do," said Jefferson in his 'Ana"
</p>
<p>of confidential disclosures published after his decease. His
</p>
<p>excuse was that the Gazette had saved the Constitution, then
</p>
<p>in danger of subversion by the monarchists ! [If Jefferson
</p>
<p>sincerely loved Washington, as we have every reason to be-
</p>
<p>lieve he did, must it therefore be said that he showed his
</p>
<p>greater love for his country in keeping Washington's libeller
</p>
<p>in his employ and confidence because Freneau had "saved the
</p>
<p>Constitution"? If Jefferson's biographers will insist upon this
</p>
<p>construction they must accept the inevitable conclusion, i. e.:
</p>
<p>that Washington was one of the enemies of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>This bare inference, now that we have the full light of history
</p>
<p>upon those times  times which, even more than the seven
</p>
<p>years' war, 'tried men's souls'  proves how absurd were Jef-

<p>ferson's " apprehensions" regarding the monarchical sympathies
</p>
<p>of his adversaries.]
</p>
<p>Washington's great sin was in throwing his august influence
</p>
<p>across the path of the disintegrators of society and government,
</p>
<p>INTRIGUES or THE MINISTER. 235
</p>
<p>tlien as now known as the champions of State Rights ; and
</p>
<p>when he sought to repress the spirit of license and French infi-
</p>
<p>delity which threatened all order and law with destruction, he
</p>
<p>committed, in the eyes of these " champions of the people," an
</p>
<p>outrage too great for forgiveness/
</p>
<p>The Frenchman's gold flowed freely in all channels where
</p>
<p>it could breed corruption. He sought and obtained advances
</p>
<p>from the United States Government on the debt due to France
</p>
<p> all of which he disbursed with the power and irresponsibility
</p>
<p>of an Emperor. Jacobin clubs flourished ; democratic socie-
</p>
<p>ties spread like a leprosy on the body politic ; "opposition
</p>
<p>journals," cherished and fostered by the French partizans, and
</p>
<p>countenanced by the faction inimical to Hamilton's financial
</p>
<p>measures, soon joined their influence to hurry the country into
</p>
<p>a war with Great Britain. Neutrality was assailed with un-
</p>
<p>ceasing rancor and " Federal usurpation" was a term of con-
</p>
<p>stant use.
</p>
<p>In all of this storm of passion, prejudice and folly, Genet
</p>
<p>rode, the master spirit. His influence was supreme. He was
</p>
<p>the Eolus who tapped the mountain and loosed the winds,
</p>
<p>which, witb omnipotent enthusiasm, he conceived were to
</p>
<p>sweep away all opposition. Disgusted, annoyed and alarmed
</p>
<p>at the marplot's power for mischief, Washington at length de-
</p>
<p>termined to rid the country of his presence. To this end he
</p>
<p>succeeded in obtaining from his Cabinet an assent to his wish
</p>
<p>* Washington took these persecutions calmly though at times he expressed his
</p>
<p>annoyance at their insolence. So long as he continued in office they did not
</p>
<p>cease. Freneau aud his echoes, thoroughly demoralized by their anarchical prin-
</p>
<p>ciples, left no stone unturned to give the great and good man pain. As late as
</p>
<p>1796, writing to Jefferson of these ' democratic' persecutions, he said :
</p>
<p>" Accused of being the enemy of America, and subject to the influence of a for-
</p>
<p>eign country, and to prove which every act of my administration is tortured, and
</p>
<p>the grossest and most insidious misrepresentations of them made by giving one
</p>
<p>side only of a subject, and that too in such exaggerated and indecent terms as

<p>could be scarcely applied to a negro, to a notorious defaulter, or even to a com-
</p>
<p>mon pickpocket."
</p>
<p>It has been the fortune of many eminent men to be thus calumniated by those
</p>
<p>iucapable of appreciating virtue and unselfish patriotism. That Washington did
</p>
<p>not escape is to encourage others less august to continue in well doing even
</p>
<p>against the aspersions of their generation : history will do them justice.

</p>
<p>for Genet's recal. Jefferson, Minister of State, was called upoa
</p>
<p>to prepare the papers in the case and did so with great gocjd
</p>
<p>judgment, forwarding to the French Assembly documenta
</p>
<p>setting.,forth the irregularity of the embassador's conduct in
</p>
<p>such terms as, eventually, effected the purpose required. Genel
</p>
<p>was recalled in January, 1794.
</p>
<p>Pending an answer to this demand for his recal the inde-
</p>
<p>fatigable revolutionist set on foot two expeditions  one for the
</p>
<p>conquest of Florida, organized in South Carolina, and one for
</p>
<p>the conquest of New Orleans, organized in Kentucky. Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment was soon apprised of these criminal enterprises, which
</p>
<p>seemed to excel in insolence all previous craft of the French
</p>
<p>Conspirator. It was ascertained that four agents of Genet had
</p>
<p>gone West and South, late in the year 1793, to carry out his
</p>
<p>projects of conquest. These men were empowered to give
</p>
<p>commissions, to enlist men, to make contracts for supplies, and,
</p>
<p>in event of success, even to make terms with the Spanish au-
</p>
<p>thorities. In the renowned George Eogers Clarke the Conspi-
</p>
<p>rator found, unfortunately for that patriot's memory, a man to
</p>
<p>lead the Kentucky army of invasion. Says his biographer :
</p>
<p>" The insolent Frenchman, Genet  supported, it must be confessed,
</p>
<p>by some of our own statesmen high in station  attempted to establish
</p>
<p>a proconsulshii) in the United States, and to reduce our country to the
</p>
<p>rank of a mere satellite of the French Republic, George Rogers Clarke
</p>
<p>accepted at his hand a commission of Major-General in the armies of
</p>
<p>France, and Commander-in-Chief of an expedition to be organized in
</p>
<p>violation of the laws of his country, and in defiance of the jDroclamation
</p>
<p>of Washington, for the purpose of attaching the Spanish provinces in
</p>
<p>the South. A proclamation, which, it is to be hoped, was not Clarke's
</p>
<p>composition, was issued in his name, offering the plunder of an inoffensive
</p>
<p>people as a bribe to the reckless adventurers of the West to enlist under
</p>
<p>the tri-colored flag. A counter-revolution in France, however, saved
</p>
<p>Clarke from the disgrace of carrying out this programme, and merging
</p>
<p>the character of a patriot soldier in that of a filibustering adventurer.

<p>The party that had been raised to power in Paris by the revolution of
</p>
<p>Thermidor disavqwed all the acts of Genet and his agents, and annulled
</p>
<p>the commissions granted by him; and Clarke again sank back into
</p>
<p>the obscurity from which he had thus been for a short time elevated."
</p>
<p>This is but an unsatisfactory reference to that interesting
</p>
<p>era in Kentucky history. The same writer says truly : "Ken-
</p>
<p>GOVEENOR Shelby's reply. 237
</p>
<p>tucky was at that time, a liot bed of intrigues and intriguers.
</p>
<p>We do not believe a country can be named whose history re-
</p>
<p>veals such an amount of secret and underhand dealing. Her
</p>
<p>whole early history, between the year 1783 and the breaking
</p>
<p>out of the late war with England, consists, when closely ex-
</p>
<p>amined, of one perplexing mass of secret machinations and
</p>
<p>treasonable and dishonorable intrigues. One of the most
</p>
<p>deeply implicated in many of these was that political and mili-
</p>
<p>tary Proteus, General James Wilkinson, whose character and
</p>
<p>career is even yet a mystery."
</p>
<p>When made aware of these filibustering devices Washing-
</p>
<p>ton acted promptly for their suppression. In reference to that
</p>
<p>against New Orleans, Jefferson, as Secretary of State, at once
</p>
<p>was directed by Washington to communicate with the Govern-
</p>
<p>or of Kentucky (Isaac Shelby), desiring him to use all lawful
</p>
<p>means for obstructing and preventing the expedition ; while
</p>
<p>General Knox, Secretary of War, also wrote to say that, if
</p>
<p>such preventive means should fail, it was the President's wish
</p>
<p>that effectual military force should be employed to stay the
</p>
<p>expedition. The Governor's reply to the communications il-
</p>
<p>lustrates the turbulent and independent spirit which animated
</p>
<p>the Western people. While, in convention assembled, they
</p>
<p>had not hesitated to demand of Congress, in language both in-
</p>
<p>decorous and dictatorial, the immediate and unconditional
</p>
<p>opening of the Mississippi river (then controlled by Spanish
</p>
<p>possession of its mouth), they had not refrained to show their
</p>
<p>contempt of the General Government by threats of secession,
</p>
<p>by encouraging, in their midst, the spirit of sedition and by
</p>
<p>aiding, openly, the several conspiracies hatched for the dismem-
</p>
<p>berment of the Union and the erection of a new power in the
</p>
<p>West. Governor Shelby, after confessing his knowledge of
</p>
<p>the expedition against New Orleans, said :
</p>
<p>" I have great doubts, even if they do not attempt to carry their plan
</p>
<p>into execution, (provided they manage their business with prudence,)

</p>
<p>From the hour of Wilkinson's appearance among them the
</p>
<p>people of the Western territories had cherished ideas of inde-
</p>
<p>pendence and empire not in consonance with loyalty to the
</p>
<p>Union and the Constitution ; and when the agents of Genet
</p>
<p>were made to play upon their passions and their lust for do-
</p>
<p>minion they were less inclined than- ever to submit to orders
</p>
<p>from the departments of the National Government. To show
</p>
<p>the extent and motive of the intrigues instigated by the Minis-
</p>
<p>ter we may recur to the address of the Jacobin club of Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia, in January, 1794, directed to the inhabitants of Lou-
</p>
<p>isiana. It was headed :
</p>
<p>"liberty, equality.
</p>
<p>" The Freemen of France to their Brothers in Louisiana :
</p>
<p>"2d year of the French Kepublic."
</p>
<p>These "Freemen of France" comprised many American citi-
</p>
<p>zens, although members of that Jacobin club. The address, in im-

<p>This inflamatory document was distributed by Genet's agents

<p>throughout all the tenitoiy ; it was read by all and created,
</p>
<p>as might have been expected, much sensation. August de la

<p>Chaise, a native of Louisiana, was Genet's chief emissary in
</p>
<p>promoting the Kentucky invasion, though Clarke was to have

<p>been commander-in-chief of the expedition. De la Chaise was

<p>a person of winning manners, of inconquerable zeal and chival-

<p> The " regular army," then denominated " the Legion of the United States,"

<p>consisted of one Major-General, four Brigadiers and their several staffs, the neces-

</p>
<p>He was at once instructed to use military force in order to
</p>
<p>prevent any passage down the river of the armed host. For
</p>
<p>that purpose he fully garrisoned Fort Massac, on the Ohio,
</p>
<p>(Kentucky side,) thirty-eight miles above its mouth. Wayne
</p>
<p>also was instructed to hold a body of troops ready for service
</p>
<p>at his headquarters at Hobson's Choice, near Cincinnati. All
</p>
<p>this argued Washington's determination to use every means in
</p>
<p>his power to sustain the supremacy of his authority.
</p>
<p>The expedition fortunately failed ; not, as Clarke's biogi'a-
</p>
<p>pher assumes, because of the counter-revolution in France, but
</p>
<p>from the want of funds with which to sustain the heavy ex-
</p>
<p>pense of his revolutionary adventure. Genet, having obtained
</p>
<p>one large instalment of the debt due from the United States to
</p>
<p>the French Government  to the Grown of France  sought, in
</p>
<p>order to obtain funds for his Spanish conquest, to cajole Ham-
</p>
<p>ilton into accepting drafts for the instalments due in 1794-95.
</p>
<p>But, the Treasurer had no idea of placing funds in the trick
</p>
<p>ster's hands to be employed against the peace and good faith
</p>
<p>of the Government. He replied that, in his view, the amount
</p>
<p>due in 1794 already had been paid ; while any payment of the
</p>
<p>instalment of 1795 must depend upon the success of loans yet

<p>to be negotiated in Europe  an answer too conclusive for of-
</p>
<p>fense even to the now thoroughly exasperated French parti-
</p>
<p>sans, whose dislike of Washington, and hate of Hamilton, did
</p>
<p>not abate with their success, the first in preserving the country
</p>
<p>in its attitude of neutrality and the second in consummating
</p>
<p>his plans of finance. The one saved the honor of the country
</p>
<p>by protecting its dignity and asserting its power ; the other
</p>
<p>saved the credit of the country by a vitalization of its finances
</p>
<p>to a degree deemed incredible even by the most able minds of

<p>the age. That these true patriots should have been the sub-

<p>Upon tlie failure of the Kentucky expedition De la Chaise
</p>
<p>addressed the democratic society of Lexington a note' from
</p>
<p>which we learn the full measure of the conspiracy contemplat-
</p>
<p>ed. He said :
</p>
<p>" Citizens : Unforeseen events, the effects of causes wliicli it is unneces-
</p>
<p>sary here to develop, have stopped the march of two thousand brave
</p>
<p>Kentuckians, who, strong in their courage, in the justice of their rights,
</p>
<p>in the purity of their cause, and in the general assent of their fellow-
</p>
<p>citizens, and convinced of the brotherly dispositions of the Louisianians
</p>
<p>waited only for their orders to go and take away, by the irresistible
</p>
<p>power of their arms, from those despotic usurpers the Spaniards, the
</p>
<p>possession of the Mississippi, secure for their country the navigation of
</p>
<p>it, break the chains of the Americans and of their French brethren in
</p>
<p>the province of Louisiana, hoist up the flag of liberty in the name of
</p>
<p>the French republic, and lay the foundations of the prosperity and hap-
</p>
<p>piness of two nations destined by nature to be but one, and so situated
</p>
<p>as to be the most happy in the universe.
</p>
<p>" Citizens '. The greater the attempts you have made toward the suc-
</p>
<p>cess of that expedition, the more sensible you must be of the impedi-
</p>
<p>ments which delay its execution, and the more energetic should your
</p>
<p>efforts be toward procuring new means of success. There is one from
</p>
<p>which I expect the greatest advantages and which may be decisive 
</p>
<p>that is, an address to the National Convention, or to the Executive
</p>
<p>Council of France. In the name of my countrymen in Louisiana, in the
</p>
<p>name of your own interest, I dare once more ask you this new proof of
</p>
<p>patriotism.
</p>
<p>to yourself, and the natural ingratitude of your constitution began to appear. You
</p>
<p>commenced your Presidential career by encouraging and swallowing the grossest
</p>
<p>adulation, you travelled America from one end to the other, to put yourself in the
</p>
<p>way of receiving it. You have as many addresses in your chest as James the lid.
</p>
<p>Monopolies of every kind marked your administration, almost in the moment of its
</p>
<p>commencement. The lands obtained in the Revolution were lavished upon parti,
</p>
<p>sans : the interest of the disbanded soldier was sold to the speculator : injustice
</p>
<p>was acted under the pretense of faith ; and the Chief of the army became the pat-

<p>" And as to you, Sir, treacherous in private friendship, and a hypocrite in public

<p>life, the world will be puzzled to decide whether you are an apostate or impostor;
</p>
<p>whether you have abandoned good principles, or whether you ever had any."
</p>
<p>Jefferson had strenuously pressed Tom Paine for Post Master General in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington's Cabinet. The President's refusal to accept the reckless infidel's services
</p>
<p>doubtless had something to do with his hostility. Jefferson remained, to the last,

<p>a warm friend of Paine.

<p>course to follow  that of going to France and expressing to the repre-

</p>
<p>" The French republicans, in their sublime constitutional act, have

<p>proffered their protection to all those nations who may have the courage

<p>to shake off the yoke of tyranny. The Louisianians have the most sa-

<p>ism by arbitrary power. The honor, the glory, the duty of the National

<p>Convention is to grant them their powerful support.
</p>
<p>" Every petition or plan relative to that imi^ortant object would meet

<p>with the highest consideration. An address from the Democratic Soci-

<p>of conquest ; but, none others followed. Genet's recal, and the
</p>
<p>absorption of funds in other more pressing directions, compell-
</p>
<p>ed the French National Convention soon to give over the idea
</p>
<p> Marshall states that intercepted letters showed several members of the French

<p>National Convention to have approved of the Minister's scheme of conquest. M.
</p>
<p>Genet was, as Major-General to be Commander-in-Chief of all forces raised on the

<p>years  though nothing more was done to accomplish its ambitious ends.

<p>EECAL OF THE MINISTER. 243
</p>
<p>of absorbing American territory Marshall in bis " Life of
</p>
<p>Washington" says : " This intelligence (of the two expeditions)
</p>
<p>seemed to render a further forbearance incompatible with the
</p>
<p>dignity, perhaps with the safety of the United States. The
</p>
<p>question of superseding the diplomatic functions of M. Genet,
</p>
<p>and depriving him of the privileges attached to that character,
</p>
<p>was brought before the Cabinet (January, 1794) and a message
</p>
<p>to Congress was prepared, communicating these transactions,
</p>
<p>and avowing a determination to adopt that measure within  
</p>
<p>days, unless, in the meantime, one or the other House should
</p>
<p>signify the opinion that it was not advisable so to do. In this
</p>
<p>state, the business was arrested by receiving a letter from Mr.
</p>
<p>Morris (our Minister to France) announcing, ofl&cially, the recal
</p>
<p>of this rash minister (Grenet)."
</p>
<p>His successor, M. Fauchent, arrived in Philadelphia, Febru-
</p>
<p>ary, 1794. Genet left for France, at once, but not until he
</p>
<p>had received congratulations, addresses of sympathy and other
</p>
<p>marks of respect from numerous public societies and individu-
</p>
<p>als. The " opposition" ever regarded him as a martyr in the
</p>
<p>cause of Liberty ! Many, however, of those who at first had
</p>
<p>favored his principles and his projects, became disgusted at his
</p>
<p>course. The indignity heaped, by the foreigner, upon Wash-
</p>
<p>ington and his Administration brought its reward of indigna-
</p>
<p>tion from thousands of those who, though French partizans
</p>
<p>and members, of the democratic societies, were, nevertheless,
</p>
<p>too patriotic to sustain French assumption at the exjDcnse of
</p>
<p>American self-respect. Washington's conduct throughout the
</p>
<p>ministry of Genet and his successor, was admirable. To his
</p>
<p>great prudence, his firmness, his power to breast the popular
</p>
<p>storm, excited by the Minister, did the country owe its second
</p>
<p>preservation. Had it made cause with France, it must have
</p>
<p>been involved in the fearful struggle which shook Europe to

<p>its base.

</p>
<p>row view of tlie case. Tlie first fruit of Genet's procedure was
</p>
<p>to bring odium upon the National Government  to render his
</p>
<p>partisans disobedient citizens. The ' democratic societies' were
</p>
<p>but the Jacobin clubs reproduced : though organized by the
</p>
<p>anti-Federalists professedly to oppose what Jefferson called the
</p>
<p>Monocrats, these societies were ultra " State Eights" champi-
</p>
<p>ons and proved their disloyalty to the General Government in
</p>
<p>every conceivable way. They contemned Washington, hated
</p>
<p>Hamilton, scorned John Adams, abused Marshall and assailed
</p>
<p>Jay with extreme malignity. The Pennsylvania troubles receiv-
</p>
<p>ed an impetus from the excise, but their exciting cause was
</p>
<p>the ' democratic societies,' their leaders were 'democratic' lead-
</p>
<p>ers, their ultimate aim was the independence of Western Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania and the formation of a Confederacy or a league of
</p>
<p>States upon the plan of the Kentucky secessionists  to unite
</p>
<p>with France in opening the Mississippi, and to form part of a
</p>
<p>French American republic, or to remain in alliance with such
</p>
<p>a republic yet retaining their State independency. The insur-
</p>
<p>rection had been brewing for several years ; it was simply one
</p>
<p>eruption of that conspiracy concocted by the disunionists and
</p>
<p>afterwards du-ected by the French ministers, to override the
</p>
<p>General Government and to denationalise the national exist-
</p>
<p>ence. The party there b- >rn of the spirit of turbulence, has
</p>
<p>existed to this day, and doubtless will continue to exist so long
</p>
<p>as there are demagogues to fan the flames of incendiarism un-
</p>
<p>der the hollow pretense of " defending and perpetuating popu-
</p>
<p>lar rights." In a people's government like ours, where there
</p>
<p>are knaves to lead there are fools to follow ; and, for the com-
</p>
<p>ing century, we may expect to see " popular" outbreaks every
</p>
<p>decade. With a central Executive strong enough to maintain
</p>
<p>Its ascendency and to enforce its authority we have nothing to
</p>
<p>fear ; but, if it ever should come to pass that our National au-

<p>It is not possible for tlie people of this generation to con-

<p>the terms of Washington, Adams and Jefferson. Discontent

<p>laws of Congress not acceptable to people of certain sections ;

<p>hostility to the schemes of finance pressed to a successful initia.

<p>France and hate of Great Britain ; the uprising of a purtj im-
</p>
<p>placable in its opposition to the Federalists, whom it charac-
</p>
<p>terized as " Monocrats" ;  all conspired, during Washington's

<p>second term, to create divisions which it took years to heal.
</p>
<p>In previous papers [see " Whiskey Insurrection" and "Genet's

<p>fruit prolific of passions, hates and distempered minds. Sym-

<p>pathy for the French revolutionists continued to grow, in spite

<p>of Washington's neutrality injunctions. Jefferson, who had,
</p>
<p>with the beginning of the year 1794, withdrawn from Wash-

<p>ington's Cabinet to " contemplate the tranquil growth of his
</p>
<p>lucerne and potatoes" at Monticello, soon became the recog-

</p>
<p>fruitful tlieme of popular discourse for twenty years. They did

<p>more : they perfected plans for overthrowing the ascendancy of

<p>the Federalists ; and the fact that each of the first three were Pres-
</p>
<p>ident in turn, and the last Yice President, proves how success-
</p>
<p>fully they manipulated public opinion.
</p>
<p>"Washington, in his last speech to Congress, August 7th,
</p>
<p>1796, said :
</p>
<p>" While in our external relations some serious inconveniences and em-
</p>
<p>barrassments have been overcome and others lessened, it is with much
</p>
<p>pain and deep regret I mention that circumstances of a very unwelcome
</p>
<p>nature have lately occurred. Our trade has suifered and is suffering
</p>
<p>extensive injuries in the West Indies from the cruisers and agents of the
</p>
<p>French Republic; and communications have been received from its
</p>
<p>minister here, which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our
</p>
<p>commerce by its authoi'ity ; and which are in other respects far from
</p>
<p>agreeable. It has been my constant, sincere and earnest wish, in con-
</p>
<p>formity with that of our nation, to maintain cordial harmony and a per-
</p>
<p>fectly friendly understanding with that Republic. This wish remains
</p>
<p>unabated ; and I shall jDersevere in the endeavor to fulfil it to the utmost
</p>
<p>extent of what shall be consistent with a just and indispensable regard
</p>
<p>to the rights and honor of our country ; nor will I easily cease to cher-
</p>
<p>ish the expectation, that a spirit of justice, candor and friendship, on
</p>
<p>the part of the Republic, will eventually ensure success."
</p>
<p>The spirit of "justice, candor and friendship" did not visit
</p>
<p>the hearts and minds of men intoxicated with a new-found
</p>
<p>liberty ; nor did the existence, in this country, of a powerful
</p>
<p>party which sustained French interests in opposition to the
</p>
<p>wishes of the National Administration, serve to lessen the hos-
</p>
<p>tility of the French Convention toward the party and policy
</p>
<p>then supreme. Yet Washington strove to effect a reconcilia-
</p>
<p>tion by every means in his power short of a virtual surrender
</p>
<p>to the insane French faction. Early in January, 1797, he re-
</p>
<p>quested the Secretary of State, Mr. Pickering, to address a
</p>

<p>ining and reviewing the same, and accompanjing tne state-
</p>
<p>ment with a collection of papers and letters relating to trans-
</p>
<p>actions therein adverted to."
</p>
<p>This letter was prepared with great care and dispatched by
</p>
<p>Mr. Pinckney. He arrived in France only to be ordered, with
</p>
<p>his letter, out of French territory ! Mr. Monroe, the retiring
</p>
<p>Minister, was addressed, at the audience of leave with M. Bar-
</p>
<p>ras, President of the Directory, in these extraordinary terms :
</p>
<p>" The French Republic hopes that the successors of Columbus, of
</p>
<p>Raleigh, aud of Penn, ever jJroud of their liberty, will never forget that
</p>
<p>they owe it to France. * * * * jj, their wisdom, they will weigh
</p>
<p>the magnanimous benevolence of the French people with the artful ca-
</p>
<p>resses of perfidious designers, who meditate to draw them back to their
</p>
<p>ancient slavery. Assure, Mr. Minister, the good American people that,
</p>
<p>like them, we adore liberty ; that they will always have our esteem, and
</p>
<p>that they will find in the French people the republican generosity which
</p>
<p>knows how to accord peace, as it knows how to make its sovereignty
</p>
<p>respected.
</p>
<p>" As to you, Mr. Minister Plenipotentiary, you have fought for the
</p>
<p>principles, you have known the true interests of your country. Depart
</p>
<p>with our regrets. We give up, in you, a representative of America, and
</p>
<p>we retain the remembrance of the citizen whose personal qualities honor
</p>
<p>that title."
</p>
<p>This insulting address was followed by other steps which
</p>
<p>left no alternative but to swallow it in humiliation or to resent
</p>
<p>it. John Adams, as Washington's successor, convened Con-
</p>
<p>gress in extra session May 15th, 1797. His opening speech to
</p>
<p>the two Houses made this reference to the attitude of France :
</p>
<p>" The speech of the President (M. Barras) discloses sentiments more
</p>
<p>alarming than the refusal of a minister, because more dangerous to our
</p>
<p>independence and union ; and, at the same time, studiously marked
</p>
<p>with indignities toward the Government of the United States. It evinc-
</p>
<p>es a disposition to separate the people from their Government ; to per-
</p>
<p>suade them that they have different affections, principles and interests

<p>from those of their fellow citizens, whom they themselves have chosen
</p>
<p>to manage their common concerns, and thus to produce divisions fatal
</p>
<p>to our peace. Such attempts ought to be repelled with a decision that
</p>
<p>strengtlien the French party and thus elect Thomas Jefferson as Washington's suc-
</p>
<p>cessor. The publication was an outrage upon all diplomatic usage ; and yet the
</p>
<p>act was in perfect keeping with the insolent course uniformly pursued toward the
</p>
<p>Administration by the French embassadors.

</p>
<p>sball convince Prance and the world, that we are not a degraded peo-
</p>
<p>ple, humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear, and sense of inferiority,
</p>
<p>fitted to be the miserable instruments of foreign influence, and regard-
</p>
<p>lesis of national honor, character and interest."
</p>
<p>Adams, doubtless influenced by the tremendous outcry
</p>
<p>raised by the French partizans, and adopting also the wishes of
</p>
<p>the Vice President, Thomas Jefferson, determined upon dis-
</p>
<p>patching a special mission to France, whose object he announc-
</p>
<p>ed to be "to dissipate umbrages, remove prejudices, rectify
</p>
<p>errors, and adjust all differences, by a treaty between the two
</p>
<p>powers." "Washington, from his retirement, beheld this state
</p>
<p>of affairs with alarm  apparently seeing in the conduct of the
</p>
<p>French Directory a design to force this country into the em-
</p>
<p>braces of France, thus to render the American Eepublic its
</p>
<p>ally in the tremendous war which followed the downfall of the
</p>
<p>old regime. "Things cannot," he wrote to a friend, "and
</p>
<p>ought not to remain any longer in their present disagreeable
</p>
<p>state. Nor should the idea that the Grovernment and the peo-
</p>
<p>ple have different views, be suffered any longer to prevail at
</p>
<p>home or abroad ; for it is not only injurious to us, but dirgrace-
</p>
<p>fal also, that a Government constituted as ours is, should be
</p>
<p>administered contrary to their interest, if the fact be so."
</p>
<p>He did not conceive that any good would come of the mis-
</p>
<p>sion. " It is hardly to be expected" he further wrote, " that
</p>
<p>the Directory will acknowledge its errors and tread back its
</p>
<p>steps immediately. This would announce at once that there
</p>
<p>has been precipitancy and injustice in the measures they have
</p>
<p>pursued." He judged truly.
</p>
<p>The three ministers extraordinary named  Pinckney, Mar-
</p>
<p>shall and Gerry  assembled in Paris October 4th, 1797, but
</p>
<p>were not recognised in their of&cial capacity. Their report*
</p>
<p>revealed at once the baseness and the insincerity of the French
</p>
<p>authorities. Talleyrand, through his secret agents  many of
</p>
<p>whom he ever employed  demanded a heavy sum as a douceur

<p>preliminary to the opening of negotiations ! Several attempts
</p>
<p>to obtain recognition and to open the conferences failed ; at
</p>
<p>each interview the agent of the French Minister of State in-

</p>
<p>sisted upon his bribe. Irving tlius chronicles the conduct of
</p>
<p>the mission:
</p>
<p>" On the 30tli of October, the same subject was resumed in the apart-
</p>
<p>ments of the plenipotentiary, and on this occasion, beside the secret
</p>
<p>agent, an intimate friend of Talleyrand was present. The expunging
</p>
<p>of the passages in the President's speech was again insisted on, and it
</p>
<p>was added that, after that, money was the principal object. ' We must
</p>
<p>have money  a great deal of money ! ' were his words.
</p>
<p>" At a third conference, October 21st, the sum was fixed at 32,000,000
</p>
<p>francs (6,400,000 dollars), as a loan secured on the Dutch contributions,
</p>
<p>and 250,000 dollars in the form of a douceur to the Directory.
</p>
<p>" At a subsequent meeting, October 27th, the same secret agent said :
</p>
<p>' Gentlemen, you mistake the point, you say nothing of the money you
</p>
<p>are to give  you make no offer of money  on that ijoint you are not
</p>
<p>explicit.' ' We are exj)licit enough,' replied the American envoys. ' We
</p>
<p>will not give you one farthing ; and before coming here, we should have
</p>
<p>thought such an offer as you now jjropose, would have been regarded
</p>
<p>as a mortal insult.'
</p>
<p>" On this indignant reply, the wily agent intimated that if they would
</p>
<p>only pay, by way of fees, just as they would to a lawyer, who should
</p>
<p>plead their cause, the sum required for the private use of the Directory,
</p>
<p>they might remain at Paris until they should receive further orders from
</p>
<p>America as to the loan required for Government.
</p>
<p>" Being inaccessible to any such disgraceful and degrading proposi-
</p>
<p>tions, the envoys remained several months in Paris unaccredited, and
</p>
<p>finally returned at separate times, without an official discussion of the
</p>
<p>object of their mission."
</p>
<p>Thus were the doors closed against a settlement; while the
</p>
<p>Directory, further to exasperate the people of this country, as
</p>
<p>well as to strengthen the French party in America, passed a
</p>
<p>decree confiscating neutral vessels and their cargoes if any por-
</p>
<p>tion of their loads should consist of British fabrics or produc-
</p>
<p>ductions ! This struck a severe if not fatal blow at the com-
</p>
<p>merce of the United States, then the " great neutral carriers of

<p>the world."
</p>
<p>War now seemed inevitable, and preparations were made
</p>
<p>accordingly. The great mass of American intelligence stood
</p>
<p>by the Government, and were prepared to resent French arro-
</p>
<p>gance to the last. Washington  who had sought Mt. Yernon,
</p>
<p>there to pass his remaining years in repose  was made Com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-Chief, an appointment seemingly called for by the

</p>
<p>alarming emergency. Not only were the Frencli to be met on
</p>
<p>land and sea, but the French party in the States, strong in
</p>
<p>numbers, powerful in leaders, moved by a common sympathy
</p>
<p>for the interests of France and hate of the Federalists, were to
</p>
<p>be taught loyalty and forced to sustain the war measures,
</p>
<p>Washington alone was the nation's hope. Hamilton, writing
</p>
<p>to him to beg his acceptance of the position to which President
</p>
<p>Adams had called him, said : "I use the liberty which my at-
</p>
<p>tachment to you and the public authorizes, to offer you my
</p>
<p>opinion that you should not decline the appointment. It is
</p>
<p>evident that the public satisfaction at it is lively and universal.
</p>
<p>It is not to be doubted that the circumstances will give an ad-
</p>
<p>ditional spring to the public mind, will tend much to unite,
</p>
<p>and will facilitate the measui'cs which the conjuncture requires."
</p>
<p>Irving adds :
</p>
<p>" It was with a heavy heart that Washington found his dream of
</p>
<p>repose once more interrupted ; but his strong fidelity to duty would
</p>
<p>not permit him to hesitate. He accepted the commission, however,
</p>
<p>with the condition that he should not be called into the field until
</p>
<p>the army was in a situation to require his presence ; or it should
</p>
<p>seem indispensable by the urgency of circumstances."
</p>
<p>Hamilton was named by "Washington second in command,
</p>
<p>and 0. C. Pinckney third. General Knox was named fourth,
</p>
<p>but refused to serve under his juniors  a point of etiquette
</p>
<p>which the veteran companion-in-arms of Washington lived to
</p>
<p>regret. Every arrangement was made during the Summer of
</p>
<p>1798 to place the troops, called into the field, in a state of high
</p>
<p>efficiency.
</p>
<p>Yet, affairs " hung fire," greatly to Washington's astonish-
</p>
<p>ment. His commissions were issued so slowly, and the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment seemed so apathetic, that the Commander-in-Chief
</p>
<p>was much perplexed and chagrined. The solution of the mys-
</p>
<p>tery was afterwards given in the fact that secret overtures of
</p>
<p>settlement were being made, Talleyrand, with his usual sa-

<p>gacity and non-committalism, becoming alarmed at the bellig-
</p>
<p>erent attitude of the United States, after badgering Mr. Gerry,
</p>
<p>and courting the offices of several " democratic" but unofficial
</p>
<p>emissaries, wrote to the secretary of the French Minister at the
</p>
<p>Hague, intimating that, should the United States send a plen-
</p>
<p>ATTACKS ON THE ADMINISTRATION. 251
</p>
<p>ipotentiaiy to France, to adjust differences, lie would unques-
</p>
<p>tionably be received "with the respect due to the representa-
</p>
<p>tive of a free, independent and powerful nation." This infor-
</p>
<p>mation the secretary at once communicated to the American
</p>
<p>Minister to Holland, William Yans Murray, who, in turn,
</p>
<p>hastened to remit it to the President, of the United States. Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams, rejoiced at this offering for an accommodation, laid the
</p>
<p>letter before the Senate along with his nomination of Mr. Mur-
</p>
<p>ray as -minister plenipotentiary to the French Eepublic (Feb.
</p>
<p>18th, 1799). Two others by the pressure of the Senate were
</p>
<p>added, viz.: Oliver Ellsworth and Patrick Henry, but Mr.
</p>
<p>Henry declining, Mr. Wm. R Davis was substituted. These
</p>
<p>three envoys, after various and somewhat inexplicable plots
</p>
<p>and counter plots, succeeded in effecting a treaty, which was
</p>
<p>signed Sept. 3d, 1800. Mr. Adams' conduct throughout the
</p>
<p>affair brought down upon him a storm of censure from all
</p>
<p>parties  censures which, even to this day, have weight with those
</p>
<p>who essay to pronounce upon this patriot's merits.
</p>
<p>All this is but preliminary to an understanding of the theme
</p>
<p>of this paper, namely, the Alien and Sedition Laws' excitement,
</p>
<p>and their consequents, the Kentucky resolutions of 1798.
</p>
<p>The French partisans were variously termed " anti-Federal-
</p>
<p>ists," " Eepublicans," "French Democrats," &c. All these
</p>
<p>most strenuously opposed the attitude of defiance at length
</p>
<p>shown to France. They clamored in public and private against
</p>
<p>the Federalists for " precipitatmg a collision;" they disap-
</p>
<p>proved the called session of Congress, May, 1797 ; they organ-
</p>
<p>ized their forces, during that session, for a determined resist-
</p>
<p>ance to all war measures ; they opened the batteries of the
</p>
<p>press with a virulence unexampled in the history of free jour-
</p>
<p>nalism; they schemed, intrigued, slandered, falsified; played
</p>
<p>the sycophant or the censor as the occasion required ; and con-
</p>
<p>tributed, by all means in their power, to stir up the most vio-
</p>
<p>lent elements of opposition to the Administration. On the part

<p>of Jefferson the hostility shown sprang quite as much from his
</p>
<p>detestation of the Federalists as for sympathy with France.
</p>
<p>Patriot as he was, he could but denounce Talleyrand's
</p>
<p>treatment of our Ministers ; yet, in the preparation for resent-
</p>
<p>252 ALIEN AND SEDITION TEOUBLES.
</p>
<p>ing that treatment and the wrongs inflicted upon our commerce
</p>
<p>b}^ French vessels of war and French privateers, the patriot
</p>
<p>was swallowed up in the Virginia politician. In the train of
</p>
<p>evils to flow from a war, he beheld an increased public debt,
</p>
<p>increased taxation, increased war establishment and increased
</p>
<p>list of army officials. The latter must contribute to the in-
</p>
<p>creased strength of the Federalists. These were good issues
</p>
<p>with which to go before the people, and they were used to the
</p>
<p>utmost. His partisans, in and out of Congress, marshaled by
</p>
<p>Burr, Madison, Gallatin, Nicholas, the New York Livingstons,
</p>
<p>Findley, Giles, Smith of Maryland, and others, labored assidu-
</p>
<p>ously to fix a stigma upon all proceedings looking to the crea-
</p>
<p>tion of a war establishment under any pretext; while, in
</p>
<p>Jay's treaty with Great Britain, (which they had bitterly op-
</p>
<p>posed and denounced in all its stages, before and after its con-
</p>
<p>firmation,) they beheld at once the sole cause and a justification
</p>
<p>of French irritation.
</p>
<p>From this opposition sprang a feeling of resentment in the
</p>
<p>breasts of the war party something akin to that felt in the
</p>
<p>Northern States against the " copperhead" faction of 1863. This
</p>
<p>hostility of the opposition soon resolved itself into a malignant
</p>
<p>persecution of men and measures, from the President to the
</p>
<p>humblest citizen. The Aurora, of Philadelphia, edited by
</p>
<p>Bache, a grandson of Benjamin Franklin, fairly blazed with
</p>
<p>the lightning of its wrath against the Federalists and their
</p>
<p>" accursed policy" ; it stole State secrets, pryed into Cabinet
</p>
<p>mysteries, invented stories at will of the most outrageous char-
</p>
<p>acter ; and never, for a single issue, intermitted its abuse of all
</p>
<p>concerned in sustaining the dignity of our flag.' It was the
</p>
<p>recognised organ of the anti- Republicans ; and, as the people,
</p>
<p>1 This sheet wrote thus on Washington's retiring from office : " The man wlio is
</p>
<p>the source of all the misfortunes of our country is this day reduced to a level with
</p>
<p>his fellow-citizens and is no longer possessed of power to multiply evils upon the
</p>
<p>United States. If ever there was a period for rejoicing this is the moment." And

<p>much more in the same spirit. His sin, in this journal's estimation, seemed to con-
</p>
<p>sist in the fact that Washington was the bulwark behind which the Federalists were
</p>
<p>intrenched. The Aurora then was Jefferson's accredited exponent, and so remain-
</p>
<p>ed during the life of Bache (who died in August, 1798) , and of his successor, James
</p>
<p>Duaue, an Irishman, under whose auspices its malignancy and powers of vitupera-

<p>during 1798, began to centre more closely around the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, to resent the indignities heaped on their country by
</p>
<p>France, it unbottled new vials of wrath and gall. The Aurora
</p>
<p>was also the organ of Adet, the French Minister, and received
</p>
<p>from his hand important documents which that functionary
</p>
<p>had communicated to our Government, and which alone held
</p>
<p>the right of their publication. These State documents the news-
</p>
<p>paper would parade before the people even before our Govern-
</p>
<p>ment had considered them ! They were thus published in the
</p>
<p>spirit of arrogance and desire for discord which had rendered
</p>
<p>M. Genet so offensive to Washington's Administration ; and
</p>
<p>all partisans of the French faction, instead of resenting the in-
</p>
<p>sult designed to the National authorities, by the foreigner,
</p>
<p>applauded. This we instance as one of many acts which
</p>
<p>demonstrated the abasement of that public sentiment which
</p>
<p>was  arraigned as the "opposition" to Adams' war measures.
</p>
<p>That there were many good men and true patriots among
</p>
<p>those who opposed all steps and acts favoring an appeal to
</p>
<p>arms is undeniable ; but, the leading men of the factionists
</p>
<p>were demagogues who intrigued for power more from want of
</p>
<p>principle than from any well defined system of opinions. The
</p>
<p>Aurora found echoes in several other journals  the Examiner,
</p>
<p>of Richmond, the Argus, of New York, the Chronicle, of Bos-
</p>
<p>ton, &c., all of which became arsenals of assault on the domi-
</p>
<p>nant party. What .their "principles" were  if such it be
</p>
<p>slaimed they had  we learn from Jefferson's letter to Mazzei,
</p>
<p>the Italian patriot. Under date of January 25th, 1797, he
</p>
<p>wrote:
</p>
<p>"Our political situation is wonderfully changed since you.
</p>
<p>left us. Instead of that noble love of liberty and that repub-
</p>
<p>lican government, which triumphantly carried us through the
</p>
<p>war, an Anglo-monarchio-aristocratic party has arisen, whose
</p>
<p>avowed object is to draw over us the substance, as they have
</p>
<p>already done the forms, of the British Government. Never-

<p>theless, the principal body of our citizens remain faithful to
</p>
<p>their republican principles. All our proprietors of lands are
</p>
<p>friendly to these principles, as also the great mass of talents.
</p>
<p>Against us are the Executive power, the Judiciary power

<p>254 ALIEN AND SEDITION TROUBLES.
</p>
<p>(two out of three branches of our Government), all the officers
</p>
<p>of the Government, all who are seeking office, all timid men
</p>
<p>who prefer the calms of despotism to the tempestuous sea of
</p>
<p>liberty, British merchants and Americans trading on British
</p>
<p>capital, speculators and those interested in the public funds,
</p>
<p>banks invented for purposes of corruption and for assimilating
</p>
<p>us in all things, rotten as well as sound, to the British model.
</p>
<p>I should give you a fever were I to name the apostates who
</p>
<p>have embraced these heresies, men who were Samsons in the
</p>
<p>field and Solomons in the council,' but whose hair has been
</p>
<p>shorne off by the harlot of England. They would wrest from
</p>
<p>us that liberty which we have obtained with so much peril
</p>
<p>and labor, but we shall preserve it." &c., &c.
</p>
<p>This remarkable indictment was drawn up by Jefferson while
</p>
<p>yet in Washington's confidence; but, its most unexpected
</p>
<p>publication by Mazzei, alienated Washington from a person
</p>
<p>who could so play at once the friend and the foe. The letter
</p>
<p>brought forth volumes of controversy, and served to intensify
</p>
<p>animosities rapidly growing against the French partisans,
</p>
<p>who were regarded by the Federalists as little else than anar-
</p>
<p>chists and disintegrators of Government, alike dangerous to
</p>
<p>morals and to liberty-.
</p>
<p>The Paris Moniteur, in publishing the above letter, used it
</p>
<p>as an evidence of the hostily of the Government (Federal) but
</p>
<p>as a proof that the 'peo'ph in America were with France. It
</p>
<p>said : " there is no doubt it (the action of the French Govern-
</p>
<p>ment in ordering Mr. Pinckney out of their territory) will give
</p>
<p>rise in the United States to discussions which may afford a
</p>
<p>triumph to the party of good republicans, the Fnends of France."
</p>
<p>This expression discloses the design of all French intrigue
</p>
<p>in this country, and the cause of the overbearing insolence
</p>

<p>* Washington is here specifically referred to. In his (Jefferson's) letter to Mad-
</p>
<p>ison, (March '27th, 1796,) he had said of the President: " I wish that his honesty
</p>
<p>and his political errors may not furnish a second occasion to exclaim ' Curse on
</p>
<p>his virtues, they have ruined his country.' "

<p>justified in setting the Federal authorities at defiance ! Never,
</p>
<p>for one moment, did the French ministers intermit their en-
</p>
<p>deavors to precipitate a colHsion between the people and their
</p>
<p>Administration; and in this nefarious work History has it to
</p>
<p>record that they received the utmost sympathy and co-opera-
</p>
<p>tion from Jefferson, Burr, &c., which it was 2MUtic to bestow.
</p>
<p>No whitewashing of their memories ever will cover this stain
</p>
<p>on their escutcheon.
</p>
<p>Affairs became so dangerously exciting, and the French fac-
</p>
<p>tion so irreconcilably malignant, that Congress, early in 1798,
</p>
<p>began to consider the necessity of a Sedition Law, to punish
</p>
<p>the incendiarism of the press, and to protect the authorities
</p>
<p>and leading men from the effect of its most shocking libels.
</p>
<p>It was a fact that the most venomous of these journalists were
</p>
<p>foreigner's  " unwilling exiles" from their own countries, where
</p>
<p>they had so outraged society as to be compelled to take refuge
</p>
<p>in America. Their most active supporters also were foreigners
</p>
<p> persons who, having been driven from Europe by the storm
</p>
<p>of revolution sweeping over that continent, had flown to Amer-
</p>
<p>ica to add greatly to the opposition prevailing against the con-
</p>
<p>stituted authorities under the guise of a hate of Federalism.
</p>
<p>These refugees, chiefly from Ireland and France, almost to a
</p>
<p>man were hostile to the neutral attitude of the Government,
</p>
<p>and everywhere formed an element of society turbulent if not
</p>
<p>dangerous. Against these legislation was proposed  so in-
</p>
<p>censed did the Federalists become at the course pursued by
</p>
<p>the emigrants. Jefferson, writing to his confidant, Madison,
</p>
<p>under date of April 28th, 1798, said of the projected legisla-
</p>
<p>tive action :
</p>
<p>" One of the war party, in a fit of unguarded passion, declared some
</p>
<p>time ago that they would pass a citizen bill, an alien bill and a sedition
</p>
<p>bill. Accordingly, some days ago, Coit laid a motion on the table for
</p>
<p>modifying the citizen law. Their threats pointed at Gallatin, and it is
</p>
<p>believed they will endeavor to mark him by this bill. Yesterday Hill-

<p>house laid on the table of the Senate a motion for giving jjower to send
</p>
<p>away suspected aliens. This is understood to be meant for Volney and
</p>
<p>CoUot. But it will not stop there when it gets into a course of execu-
</p>
<p>tion. There is now only wanting to accomplish the whole declaration
</p>
<p>before mentioned, a sedition bill, which we shall certainly soon see pro-

<p>posed. The object of that is the suppression of the Whig jiressesi
</p>
<p>Bache has been particularly named. That paper, and also Carey's tot-
</p>
<p>ter for want of subscriptions. We should really exert ourselves to pro-
</p>
<p>cure them, for if these papers fall, Republicanism will be entirely brow-
</p>
<p>beaten. The popular movement in the Eastern States is checked as we
</p>
<p>expected, and war addresses are showering in from New Jersey and the
</p>
<p>great trading towns. However, we still trust that a nearer view of
</p>
<p>war and a land tax will oblige the great mass of the people to attend.
</p>
<p>At present the war-hawks talk of Septembrizing, deportation and the
</p>
<p>examples for quelling sedition set by the French executive. All the
</p>
<p>firmness of the human mind is now in a state of requisition."
</p>
<p>Here we are informed of the acts contemplated, and also
</p>
<p>have the evidence of Jefferson's anxiety to sustain the two
</p>
<p>most offensive newspapers. It darkens the halo around the
</p>
<p>head of the writer of the Declaration of Independence to learn
</p>
<p>that the author of that glorious instrument became the patron
</p>
<p>of journals too indecent and too revolutionary for admission to
</p>
<p>respectable circles. The action adverted to quickly followed.
</p>
<p>As the Constitution secured the right of naturalization and
</p>
<p>consequent citizenship to foreigners, there remained for Con-
</p>
<p>gress only the power to fix the time and terms of qualification
</p>
<p>to enjoy the constitutional right. This power it exercised by
</p>
<p>the passage of an act amending the Naturalization law, ex-
</p>
<p>tending the previous necessary term' of residence from five to
</p>
<p>fourteen years, requiring five years previous declaration of in-
</p>
<p>tention to become a citizen instead of three years, as originally
</p>
<p>stipulated. But, "alien enemies" were not to be admitted to
</p>
<p>citizenship at all. " A register was to be kept of all aliens
</p>
<p>resident in the country, who were to report themselves under
</p>
<p>certain penalties ; and in case of application to be naturalized,
</p>
<p>the certificate of an entry in this register was to be the only
</p>
<p>proof of residence whenever that residence commenced after
</p>
<p>the date of this act."
</p>
<p>This did not, however, reach the evil most decried, viz.: the

<p>residence here of numerous French and Irish emigrants, not
</p>
<p>citizens, said to entertain designs against the peace of the coun-
</p>
<p>try, and suspected of, or known to be, in co-operation with ex-

<p>THE FRENCH SPIES. 257
</p>
<p>during tlie latter part of his residence in the United States as
</p>
<p>a spy for the French government, and others of the exiled
</p>
<p>French were objects of a similar suspicion. The late attempts
</p>
<p>to set on foot French expeditions in Georgia and the Wst
</p>
<p>were not forgotten. Davis, the representative from Kentucky,
</p>
<p>stated that the commissions issued on that occasion were yet in
</p>
<p>existence, and that a certain Frenchman, resident in Kentucky,
</p>
<p>through whose hands they had passed, was still very busy in
</p>
<p>alienating the affection of the people from the United States,
</p>
<p>Indeed, it was strongly suspected, and probably not without
</p>
<p>reason, that Volney had not been engaged in exploring the
</p>
<p>Western country solely with scientific views. Like Micheaux,
</p>
<p>the botanist, a few years before, he had, perhaps, been employ-
</p>
<p>ed as a French government agent to obtain information ; and
</p>
<p>possibly too in forming connections of which advantage might
</p>
<p>be taken in case of a rupture with the United States, to pro-
</p>
<p>cure a dismemberment from the Union of the trans-Alleghany
</p>
<p>settlements, and their junction with Louisiana, which it was
</p>
<p>believed that France already had or soon would re-acquire."
</p>
<p>To meet the case of these parties a second act was passed, lim-
</p>
<p>ited to two years in its operation, bestowing upon the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent authority to order out of the country all such aliens as
</p>
<p>he might judge dangerous to the peace and safety of the United
</p>
<p>States, or suspect to be concerned in any treasonable or secret
</p>
<p>machinations. This second ordinance, known as the Alien Act,
</p>
<p>was most strenuously opposed in Congress, passing the House
</p>
<p>by a vote of forty-six to forty. Out of Congress it was receiv-
</p>
<p>ed with anathemas loud and ceaseless. It was regarded as an
</p>
<p>unconstitutional interference with the right secured to the ex-
</p>
<p>isting States to admit, prior to 1808, the importation or emi-
</p>
<p>gration of any such persons as they might think proper ; and
</p>
<p>also as an unconstitutional interference with the right of trial
</p>
<p>by jury.
</p>
<p>A third act also was added to provide for public safety in

<p>event of war declared by, or an invasion of, the United States,
</p>
<p>whereby all resident aliens, natives or citizens of the hostile
</p>
<p>nation, might, upon a proclamation to that eJEfect (to be issued

</p>
<p>at the President's discretion) be apprehended, and secured or
</p>
<p>removed.
</p>
<p>These three acts exasperated those inimical to the Adminis-
</p>
<p>tration; but their exasperation was measurably heightened
</p>
<p>when, a few days later, Lloyd, Senator from Maryland, brought
</p>
<p>in his bill to define more precisely the crime of treason, and
</p>
<p>to define and punish the crime of sedition. The original bill
</p>
<p>was modified and finally passed, as amended, in the House by
</p>
<p>the close vote of forty-four to forty-one. As passed it provid-
</p>
<p>ed : First, that it is a high misdemeanor, punishable by fine,
</p>
<p>not exceeding five thousand dollars, for any persons to con-
</p>
<p>spire against the Government of the United States to impede
</p>
<p>the operation of the law, or to commit, advise or attempt to
</p>
<p>procure any insurrection, riot, unlawful assembly or combina-
</p>
<p>tion. The second section subjected to a fine, not exceeding
</p>
<p>two thousand dollars, the publishing of any false, scandalous
</p>
<p>or malicious writings against the Government of the United
</p>
<p>States, or either house of Congress, or the President, with in-
</p>
<p>tent to defame them or bring them into disrepute, or to excite
</p>
<p>against them the hatred of the people of the United States, or
</p>
<p>to stir up sedition, or to excite any unlawful combination for
</p>
<p>opposing any law of the United States, or to encourage any
</p>
<p>hostile designs of any foreign nation against the United States.
</p>
<p>The act was to continue in force until 25th of June, 1800.
</p>
<p>In its original shape Alexander Hamilton opposed the act
</p>
<p>on patriotic and individual grounds. He regarded it as highly
</p>
<p>exceptionable, and apprehended that it might induce just the
</p>
<p>evil, civil war, which it was especially intended to avert. "Let
</p>
<p>us not" said he, " establish tyranny ; energy is a very difi'erent
</p>
<p>thing from violence. If we make no false step we shall be
</p>
<p>eventually united ; but, if we push things to extremes, we shall
</p>
<p>then give to faction body and solidity." These views were
</p>
<p>quickly proven to be sound ; since, in spite of the apparent
</p>
<p>provocation for this proscriptive legislation, they were so

<p>alarmingly effective in their nature, that every class of citizen
</p>
<p>affected by them united in their condemnation, while the " re-

<p>United Irishmen and the Eoman Catholic element  all com-

<p>bined, in one body, to bring odium upon the laws and their
</p>
<p>makers. So powerfully, indeed, did tLie enemies of the Ad-
</p>
<p>ministration use the acts that they were made instrum^tal in
</p>
<p>exalting Jefferson to the Presidency and Aaron Burr to the
</p>
<p>Yice Presidency, March 4th, 1801 ; while the Congress elected
</p>
<p>to meet Dec. 7th, 1800, showed the Federalists to be heavily
</p>
<p>in the minority. The Senate stood eighteen " Eepublicans" to
</p>
<p>fourteen Federalists ; the House sixty-nine " Eepublicans" to
</p>
<p>thirty-six Federalists.
</p>
<p>Thus sagaciously did the opposition use their opportunities.
</p>
<p>Though the Alien law was not enforced, and the Sedition law
</p>
<p>expired, hy limitation^ in June, 1800, the " republican" leaders
</p>
<p>made the most of the proscrij)tive principles involved in the
</p>
<p>acts, fixing upon the Federalists a purpose to circumscribe
</p>
<p>citizenship and to repress the free utterance of opinion  charg-
</p>
<p>es well calculated to consolidate and harmonise the half-dozen
</p>
<p>turbulent opposition elements which, until that moment, had
</p>
<p>not decidedly united.
</p>
<p>But six prosecutions were made under the Sedition act. As
</p>
<p>many more were attempted but abandoned. The death of
</p>
<p>Washington (1799), the peaceful adjustment (1800) of our af-
</p>
<p>fairs with France by the advent of the Bonapartists to power ;
</p>
<p>the division in the Federalists' ranks owing to the mingled
</p>
<p>rashness, folly and implacability of John Adams, and to his
</p>
<p>war with Alexander Hamilton ; the Alien and Sedition laws ;
</p>
<p>the severity of taxation, &c.  all conspired to drive from pow-
</p>
<p>er a party which gave character to the Government in its most
</p>
<p>perilous and trying moments, and stamped upon our institu-
</p>
<p>tions the features of central, self-sustaining power which alone
</p>
<p>have perpetuated the Union and made us great as one people.
</p>
<p>The excitement engendered duiing the years 1797-98 was
</p>
<p>but one manifestation of the sectional animosity prevailing be-
</p>
<p>tween the Northern and the Southern States. New England
</p>
<p>then was Federalist overwhelmingly ; New York and Pennsyl-

</p>
<p>vania were nicely balanced, though soon overwhelmingly dem-
</p>
<p>ocratic ; Virginia and the South were democratic, or anti-Fed-
</p>
<p>eralist. It was this growing spirit of local enmity, as well as
</p>
<p>the general discord prevailing, which induced Washington to
</p>
<p>260 ALIEN AND SEDITION TROUBLES,
</p>
<p>accept the Presidency for a second term. Urging him to take
</p>
<p>the office, Governor Eandolph, of Virginia, said that those who
</p>
<p>had opposed the Federal Constitution from " a hatred of the
</p>
<p>Union," never could he reconciled to it; while others would "push
</p>
<p>the construction of Federal power to every tenable extreme ;"
</p>
<p>sind added that the Eepublican (anti-Federalist) party had then
</p>
<p>adopted " the fatal error that the State Assemblies were to be
</p>
<p>resorted to as the engines of correction to the Federal Admin-
</p>
<p>istration." The "Democratic Societies", already referred to,
</p>
<p>[see "Whiskey Insurrection"], were positively disloyal to the
</p>
<p>General Government, but were not more so than the foreign
</p>
<p>factionists. The imposition, indeed, were so powerful, that
</p>
<p>Jeiferson wrote to Madison (Dec. 1794) : " Separation is now
</p>
<p>near and certain, and determined in the minds of all men."
</p>
<p>This disunion spirit Washington's great influence was barely
</p>
<p>able to suppress ; and, in preparing his " Farewell Address,"
</p>
<p>this truly great man sought to show the value of Union and
</p>
<p>the necessity for its preservation. The election which follow-
</p>
<p>ed really was a contest between those desuing to solidify and
</p>
<p>to strengthen the Union, and those desiring to render it but
</p>
<p>the mere creature of convenience, without authority in, and
</p>
<p>possessing no rights supreme to, the States. This latter sec-
</p>
<p>tion Jefferson represented : he was its candidate for the Presi-
</p>
<p>dency (1796), and so nearly succeeded that Adams triumphed
</p>
<p>only by three electoral votes (71 to 68). Had the ballots thrown
</p>
<p>for Aaron Burr (also a "Eepublican") been cast for Jefferson,
</p>
<p>he would have been elected President by twenty-seven ma-
</p>
<p>jority.^
</p>
<p>The evidence of Jefferson's antagonism to the Federal idea
</p>
<p>of the National " compact" ere long came forth in many ways.
</p>
<p>He labored, however, with extreme caution. Much of his cor-
</p>
<p>respondence, now made public, was not designed to see the
</p>
<p>light ; he worked incessantly, both in secret and openly, to
</p>
<p>accomplish his ambitious political aims  the overthrow of the

<p>Federalists, the trmmpt of the " Republicans," and the exalta-
</p>
<p>tion of himself to the Presidency. That that was his aim, we
</p>
<p>now have the "cloud of witnesses" which carries con\dction.
</p>
<p>The history of the Kentucky Resolutions of '98 is as fol-
</p>
<p>lows : Mr. Jefferson, then Vice President of the United States,
</p>
<p>was visited at Monticello, in October, 1798, by George Nicho-
</p>
<p>las, of Kentucky, and his brother, Wilson C. Nicholas, soon
</p>
<p>afterwards chosen United States Senator from "Virginia, chiefly
</p>
<p>through Jefferson's influence. These persons, just from Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia  then the seat of National Government  represented
</p>
<p>that the leading Republicans in Congress, " finding themselves
</p>
<p>useless there," being "brow-beaten by a bold and overwhelm-
</p>
<p>ing majority in that body," had concluded to retire from that
</p>
<p>field and take a stand in the State Legislatures. Their pro-
</p>
<p>gramme was to reassert the doctrines of State Supremacy, so
</p>
<p>earnestly struggled for in the Convention which formed the
</p>
<p>Constitution, and maintained up to that moment by a large
</p>
<p>body of the people. Their views of government were against
</p>
<p>centralization, and, for that reason, they had opposed, in their
</p>
<p>Legislatures, the adoption of the Constitution. Once adopted,
</p>
<p>however, they were powerless except to triumph over the
</p>
<p>friends of that Constitution at the ballot box, and then to seek,
</p>
<p>by legislation, what they had failed to accomplish in Conven-
</p>
<p>tion  the denatioDalization of the General Government. But,
</p>
<p>they labored in vain during Washington's term of office, though,
</p>
<p>with their numerous popular rallying cries against taxation,
</p>
<p>against the excise, against Hamilton's banking schemes, against
</p>
<p>the Jay treaty with Great Britain, and, finally, against the
</p>
<p>Alien and Sedition laws, they obtained a vantage ground
</p>
<p>which soon gave them almost unbroken control of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment for forty years. Jefferson, after canvassing the matter
</p>
<p>with the Nicholas brothers, finally consented to draw up a set
</p>
<p>of resolutions embodying the " Republican'' idea of State and
</p>
<p>National relations ; these resolutions were to be sanctioned by

</p>
<p>States for action. Being Vice President, ought he to engage
</p>
<p>in the work proposed, which was especially designed to weak-

</p>
<p>ernment? He liad, only in the previous month, of June, writ-
</p>
<p>ten to a Virginian, John Taylor, to prove to him the impolicy
</p>
<p>of any scheme of disunion  of " estimating the separate mass
</p>
<p>'of Virginia and North Carolina with a view to their separate
</p>
<p>existence." Yet, Jefferson was a politician as well as a patri-
</p>
<p>ot ; and, seeing the way open for a broad, clear enunciation of
</p>
<p>doctrines which had in them the elements of popular s access,
</p>
<p>he did not shrink from the responsibility, particularly as he
</p>
<p>was not to be known as the author of the work. Under a
</p>
<p>pledge of secrec}^ the celebrated State Eights Eesolutions of
</p>
<p>'98 were wrought, and that pledge was faithfully kept until
</p>
<p>twenty years later, when, constrained by Nicholas' son to avow
</p>
<p>the authorship, he wrote : " I would have wished this rather
</p>
<p>to have remained, as hitherto, without inquiry." No doubt
</p>
<p>of it, since those resolutions make him the parent of that brood
</p>
<p>of dragons which has afflicted, and doubtless will continue to
</p>
<p>afflict, this Government with threats of political disintegration.
</p>
<p>The resolutions as prepared by Jefferson were more vicious
</p>
<p>and radically revolutionary than even the Kentucky Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture could bear, and were, therefore, changed  the original
</p>
<p>8th and 9th being discarded and new 8th and 9th substituted

<p>by Nicholas. As amended they were presented in the Legis-

</p>
<p>This premise taken for granted the succeeding six resolu-
</p>
<p>tions applied the right of State judgment to three acts of the
</p>
<p>last Congress, viz : to punish counterfeiters of the bills of the
</p>
<p>United States Bank, the Sedition law and the Alien law  all
</p>
<p>of which were pronounced " not law, but altogether void and of
</p>

</p>
<p>National Bank mania, and to those foreign and domestic mal-
</p>
<p>contents whose discrimination between liberty and license was
</p>
<p>not particularly apparent]
</p>
<p>The seventh of the series as drawn by Jefferson postponed
</p>
<p>"to a time of greater tranquility" the "revisal and correction"
</p>
<p>of sundry other acts of Congress, also assumed to be founded
</p>
<p>upon an unconstitutional interpretation of the " right to impose
</p>
<p>taxes and excises to provide for the common defense and wel-
</p>
<p>fare and to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying
</p>
<p>into execution the powers vested in the Government" of the
</p>
<p>United States. [This was the " tub" to those who proposed
</p>
<p>to drink whiskey free of an excise, and who preferred to live

</p>
<p>The eighth of Mr. Jefferson's series, directed the appoint-

</p>
<p>municate the resolutions to the several States, and to inform
</p>
<p>them that the commonwealth of Kentucky, with all her esteem

<p>not within the compact^ to nullify^ of their oivn authority^ all as-
</p>
<p>sumptions of power hy others within their limttsy This extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary "higher law" assumption was justified, with much
</p>
<p>effort to prove that it was the only doctrine consistent with
</p>
<p>liberty  that, to appeal to Congress, in such a case, would be
</p>
<p>out of place, since Congress was not a party to the " compact"
</p>
<p>(the Constitution) but merely its creature ; therefore, the com-
</p>
<p>mittee of correspondence and conference was to call upon these
</p>
<p>" co-States" " to concur in declaring these acts void and of no
</p>
<p>force, and each to take measures of its own for providing that
</p>
<p>neither of these acts, nor any other of the General Government
</p>
<p>not plainly and intentionally authorized by the Constitution,
</p>
<p>shall be exercised within their respective territories." [Here
</p>
<p>was the "tub" to the big whale  to all that large class, who,
</p>
<p>disliking restraint upon their actions or their principles, pre-
</p>
<p>ferred to sail where and how they pleased. If any pilot boat
</p>
<p>or Federal ship seeking supplies, should be caught in their
</p>
<p>waters, she was to be scuttled and sunk. This promised a
</p>
<p>plentiful harvest of popular excitement, and, if enforced, would
</p>
<p>rend the Union to atoms.]
</p>
<p>The ninth resolution, as drawn by Jefferson, gave to the
</p>
<p>committee of correspondence power to correspond with like
</p>
<p>committees to be appointed by the " co-States"  the commit-
</p>
<p>tee being required to report all such correspondence at the next
</p>
<p>session of the Legislature.
</p>
<p>There never was a conspiracy concocted against the Union
</p>
<p>more fatal to its peace and to its life than that wrought in the
</p>
<p>library at Monticello ; and, if George Nicholas afterwards ex-
</p>
<p>tracted some of the fangs of the dragon before daring to pre-

<p>sent the monster for the caresses of the public, it does not

<p>make Thomas Jefferson any the less responsible for what he

<p>best endeavors to procure at the next session a repeal of the
</p>
<p>aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts ;" the Governor
</p>
<p>meanwhile to transmit copies to the Legislatures of the several
</p>
<p>States, to whom an earnest argumentative appeal was address-
</p>
<p>ed, borrowed partly from Jefferson's eighth resolution, for an
</p>
<p>expression of opinion as to the Alien and Sedition laws, and
</p>
<p>for their concurrence with Kentucky in declaring these laws
</p>
<p>void and of no force, and in requesting their repeal at the next
</p>
<p>session of Congress.
</p>
<p>These resolutions were responded to quickly by a similar
</p>
<p>series prepared by Madison at Jefferson's instigation  intro-
</p>
<p>duced to the Virginia Legislature by the John Taylor already
</p>
<p>leferred to as a disunionist. We give the series as adopted, in
</p>
<p>the Appendix. It will be seen that, though briefer and appa-
</p>
<p>rently less de-lSTational, they nevertheless inculcate the same
</p>
<p>baleful idea of overriding Congress and of making the General
</p>
<p>Government subordinate to the States, The resolutions, as
</p>
<p>passed, were deprived of much of their original anti-National
</p>
<p>animus. Indeed, in order to secure their passage at all, the
</p>
<p>most "representative" sections were eradicated ; the whole were
</p>
<p>so toned down as to render them less inimical to the General
</p>
<p>Government and more considerate of Congi-ess. The resolu-
</p>
<p>tions only passed, after a spirited and somewhat protracted
</p>
<p>debate  in the House of Delegates Dec. 21st, by a vote of one
</p>
<p>hundred to sixty-three, and in the Senate Dec. 24th, by four-
</p>
<p>teen to three. Then as ever since, up to 1861, the aristocratic
</p>
<p>element of Virginia's population  the old families with vast
</p>
<p>estates and many slaves  were extremely hostile to the idea of
</p>
<p>any authority supreme to that of Virginia. The " democratic"
</p>
<p>element was, therefore, largely in the ascendant ; and, from
</p>
<p>that day forward, not only Virginia, but all the Southern States
</p>
<p>presented the anomaly of its most exclusive and tvrannical

<p>furnishes few pri.rallels for this incident in our national expe-

</p>
<p>Northern democrats have, from Jefferson's time down, voted
</p>
<p>with Southern aristocrats.
</p>
<p>These Virginia resolutions were sent forth to the States, ac-
</p>
<p>companied by an address, prepared by Madison with all the abil-
</p>
<p>ity of an adroit rhetorician, setting forth the causes of complaint
</p>
<p>against the Federal Government, and giving reasons at length
</p>
<p>for the adoption of the resolutions. This address called forth
</p>
<p>a counter address, signed by fifty-eight of the minority, in which
</p>
<p>it was declared that the awful crisis had arrived, lamenting the
</p>
<p>existence of the revolutionary resolutions, and justifying their
</p>
<p>own course in opposing them by declaring their apprehension
</p>
<p>of " the evils which disunited America must inevitably suffer."
</p>
<p>The minority address also put forth the sentiment that
</p>
<p>" America is one nation^ and, therefore, the State Governments
</p>
<p>are restrained from interfering with the great acts of sovereign-
</p>
<p>ty of the General Government." This address was presented
</p>
<p>by the minority to the Legislature, to be printed and circulated
</p>
<p>with the Madison paper; but, it was, by a vote of the majori-
</p>
<p>ty, denied the light, and was afterwards published in the news-
</p>
<p>papers, in which it had a wide circulation, with good effect on
</p>
<p>the public mind, as showing that Yirgmia was not all disloyal.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the resolutions and the address so alarmed many a
</p>
<p>patriot who had conscientiously opposed the adoption of the
</p>
<p>Constitution, that numbers of hitherto "republicans" came forth
</p>
<p>to sustain the Government by their influence against these evi-
</p>
<p>dently revolutionary proceedings. Patrick Henry, though in
</p>
<p>ill health and indisposed to any further public service, took
</p>
<p>the field in an active canvass for the Legislature for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of fighting down the inic[uitous scheme concocted by the
</p>
<p>"republican" leaders to bring discredit upon the National
</p>
<p>Government. He did not then know how deeply Madison and
</p>
<p>Jefferson were implicated in the matter ; but, he did behold
</p>
<p>the appalling dangers awaiting the States and the Union if the
</p>
<p>doctrines embodied in the resolutions prevailed. Wirt, in his

<p>life of Henry, gives a report of one of his speeches made during
</p>
<p>the canvass for his election, in which he assumed that, in dar-
</p>
<p>ing to pronounce upon the validity of Federal laws the State
</p>
<p>had quitted the sphere in which she had been placed by the
</p>
<p>EESPONSE OF THE STATES. 267
</p>
<p>Constitution, had gone out of her jurisdiction in a manner not
</p>
<p>warranted by any authority, and, in the highest degree, alarm-
</p>
<p>ing to every considerate man ; and he declared that such op-
</p>
<p>position to the General Government as that proposed must be-
</p>
<p>get the enforcement of the laws by military power. This
</p>
<p>shows how the most intelligent minds construed the character
</p>
<p>of those resolves ; and, though both Madison and Jefferson,
</p>
<p>alarmed at the monster which they had evoked, gave, in after
</p>
<p>life,* ample evidence that they, too, repudiated the heresies of
</p>
<p>nullification and secession, their efforts in the two Legislatures
</p>
<p>were alarmingly revolutionary, in theory at least. The prin-
</p>
<p>ciples embodied in their resolves have constituted, ever since,
</p>
<p>the chief defense of all enemies of the Union.
</p>
<p>The address and resolves only elicited from the States marks
</p>
<p>of disapproval. No responsive echo came from any Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture save that of uneasy Kentucky. Maryland, Delaware,
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Ehode
</p>
<p>Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont all ex-
</p>
<p>pressed their dissent in resolves denying the right assumed of
</p>
<p>a State Legislature deciding upon the validity of acts of Con-
</p>
<p>gress. The reply of Massachusetts was characteristic of her
</p>
<p>old heart of loyalty. She maintained the constitutionality of
</p>
<p>the Alien and Sedition laws and declared them to be justified
</p>
<p>by the exigency of the moment and by the power of Congress
</p>
<p>to provide for the common defense. This earnest denial of
</p>
<p>the State Eights' assumption, by men who had well considered
</p>
<p>the entire question in their labors upon the Constitution and
</p>
<p>in their canvass for its adoption, would seem to be conclusive
</p>
<p>upon one point, viz.: if States which had just merged their su-
</p>
<p>* Jefferson was no sooner in the Presidential cliair than he virtually repudiated
</p>
<p>his Kentucky programme. He said in his inaugural address that " the preserva-
</p>
<p>tion of the General Government in its vehole constitutional vigor, was the sheet
</p>
<p>anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad :" that " absolute acquiescence in
</p>
<p>the decisions of the majority was the vital principle of republics, from which there

</p>
<p>is no appeal but to force, the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism."
</p>
<p>The published works of both Madison and Jefferson contain many things which it
</p>
<p>is very hard to reconcile with the two series of resolves to which they gave the
</p>
<p>paternity of their great names. See Appendix for a letter not given in Madison's
</p>
<p>published works, wherein he denounces secession and gives his own views of the
</p>
<p>resolutions of '98.
</p>
<p>268 ALIEIf AND SEDITION TROUBLES.
</p>
<p>premacj in that of the Union, denounced the right to sit in
</p>
<p>judgment on acts of Congress and to call the General Govern-
</p>
<p>ment to an account at their will, that right must be regarded
</p>
<p>as a constitutional heresy. The burden of proof that it is nol
</p>
<p>a heresy is, therefore, thrown upon those who oppose the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution as expounded by those who constructed that instru-
</p>
<p>ment or assisted in its inauguration. We have but to cite the
</p>
<p>testimony of " the Fathers" to prove that the State rights dog-
</p>
<p>matists really stand in an attitude of revolution.
</p>
<p>But, after all, these bold resolves were not meant for a future
</p>
<p>generation. As we have said, they seem simply to have been
</p>
<p>an invention of a shrewd politician, in a moment interesting to
</p>
<p>the fortunes of his party, whereby to consolidate the several
</p>
<p>elements of opposition to the party in power, with a view to
</p>
<p>its overthrow and the consequent promotion of Thomas Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son to the Presidency. Chief Justice Marshall, writing of the
</p>
<p>debates in the Virginia Legislature on the resolves, said :
</p>
<p>"The debates on these subjects were long and animated. In the
</p>
<p>course of them sentiments were declared and (in my judgment) views
</p>
<p>were developed of a very serious and alarming extent. To me it
</p>
<p>seems that there are men who will hold power by any means rather
</p>
<p>than not hold it, and who would prefer a dissolution of the Union
</p>
<p>to the continuance of an administration not of their own party. They
</p>
<p>will risk all the ills which may result from the most dangerous ex-
</p>
<p>periments rather than permit that happiness to be enjoyed which is
</p>
<p>dispensed by other hands than their own."
</p>
<p>Though written by an administration man, this was the view
</p>
<p>of a clear head and a just mind. It was confirmed by subse-
</p>
<p>quent events. Those who intrigued were all the recipients of
</p>
<p>offices and honors at the hands of the popular party. Jefferson
</p>
<p>became President ; Burr, Vice President ; Madison, Secretary of
</p>
<p>State ; Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury ; and John
</p>
<p>Breckenridge, Attorney General. Madison, next had his turn
</p>
<p>at the Presidency, to be followed by Monroe, also a Virginian

<p>and a partisan of the Jeiferson school.
</p>
<p>Referring to the Kentucky and Virginia resolves Edward
</p>
<p>Everett has correctly said: "They did their work  all they
</p>
<p>were intended or expected to do  by shaking the Administra-
</p>
<p>tion. At the ensuing election, Mr. Jefferson, at whose instancf
</p>
<p>JEFFERSON'S PEACE OFFERING. 269
</p>
<p>the entire movement was made, was chosen President by a
</p>
<p>very small nmjority ; Mr. Madison was placed at the head of
</p>
<p>his Administration as Secretary of State ; the obnoxious laws
</p>
<p>expired b}^ their own limitation ; and Mr. Jefferson proceeded
</p>
<p>to administer the Government upon constitutional principles
</p>
<p>quite as lax, to say the least, as those of his predecessors."
</p>
<p>Quite as "lax." A great many things deemed unconstitu-
</p>
<p>tional when out of power were found to be constitutional wheu
</p>
<p>in power. Indeed, when assuming the reins of government
</p>
<p>he said, (in his inaugural) : " Every difference of opinion is
</p>
<p>not a difference of principle. We have called by different
</p>
<p>names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans
</p>
<p> all Federalists^ Remarkable confession when coming from
</p>
<p>him who, of all others, had fixed the stigma of monarchy
</p>
<p>and usurpation upon those just driven from the executive and
</p>
<p>seats of legislation. And when he added : "If there be any
</p>
<p>among us who would wish to dissolve this Union, or to change
</p>
<p>its republican form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments
</p>
<p>of the safety with which errors of opinion may be tolerated
</p>
<p>when reason is left to control it," we are constrained to ex-
</p>
<p>claim : " can this be the same man who, but a few months
</p>
<p>previously, sought to array the States against the General
</p>
<p>Government and Congress ?"
</p>
<p>In weighing all the circumstances which gave rise to the ob-
</p>
<p>noxious enactment, of 1798, we are surprised less at their seve-
</p>
<p>rity than at their moderation. It is the chronic failure of par
</p>
<p>tisan writers, of the Jeffersonian faith, to belittle the dangers
</p>
<p>which then existed and to magnify the bad character of the
</p>
<p>offending statutes. The truth is undeniable that, if the laws
</p>
<p>were proscriptive and of unmeasured severity, the provocation
</p>
<p>was great. Irish patriots and French revolutionists, having
</p>
<p>only radical conceptions of liberty, used their freedom of speech
</p>
<p>and of the press to villify and debase. Their papers, which
</p>
<p>still are preserved, are positively foul with libels and abuse ;

<p>Liberty to them consisted in perfect unrestraint ; old patriots

<p>THE CONSPIRACY OF AARON BURR.
</p>
<p>PRECEDiisrG papers have informed the reader in regard to
</p>
<p>disunion intrigues in the West. Wilkinson's treasonable alli-
</p>
<p>ance with the Spaniards, and his labors with tongue, pen and
</p>
<p>Spanish gold to divorce Kentucky from its allegiance to the
</p>
<p>Federal Government, deeply unsettled the minds of all con-
</p>
<p>cerned in the Ohio valley, inspiring them with dreams of em-
</p>
<p>pire which it required two generations to forget. His intrigues
</p>
<p>were succeeded by the disloyal "democratic societies," and
</p>
<p>: Lese, in turn, were followed by the machinations of Genet,
</p>
<p>whose emissaries proposed to wrest Louisiana and Florida from
</p>
<p>the Spaniards. Their eloquence, their promises of vast com-
</p>
<p>mercial rewards, and their gold, measurably added to the dis-
</p>
<p>union distemper. Almost every domicil, particularly of that
</p>
<p>large class which lived by their wits,' became the centre of
</p>
<p>excitement, which first the Spanish and then the French emis-
</p>
<p>saries swayed to their ambitious projects. Gradually, howev-
</p>
<p>er, love for the Union quieted the old spirit of secession, and
</p>
<p>the year 1800 saw Kentucky an outwardly contented State.
</p>
<p>By the cession of Louisiana to the United States (1803) the
</p>
<p>last source of discontent was removed. The mouths of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi were opened to commerce, and, thenceforward, the
</p>
<p>boundless West only had to unloose its energies to grow into
</p>
<p>greatness.
</p>
<p>* See Hall's " Sketches of History, Life and Manners in the West," for an inte-
</p>
<p>resting exposition of Kentucky character at the date now under notice. A large
</p>
<p>numberof Kentucky settlers having pursued the life of hunters and guides, or served
</p>
<p>in the field under Boone, Hardin, Clarke, Scott, &c., were thoroughly infused with
</p>
<p>the spirit militaire, and formed, with the professional boatmen, a strong background
</p>
<p>for the labors of those plotting military and commercial enterprises. A more
</p>
<p>courageous, hardy and restless set of men never lived.

<p>But, the old fires were there ; only some master spirit was

<p>required to set them all aflame. That Prince of Marplots, Gen-

<p>Vice Presidency to that of the outcast, Aaron Burr neither
</p>
<p>lost his astonishing equanimity nor forgot his subtle skill for
</p>
<p>intrigue ; and he turned to the West as naturally as if his
</p>
<p>movements had been determined in that direction for years.
</p>
<p>Burr, as a politician, instinctively gravitated to the " opposi-
</p>
<p>tion" party. His talent for dissimulation, his indifference to prin-
</p>
<p>ciple in politics, his innate love of intrigue, his disregard of all
</p>
<p>moral restraints, led him to associations with those whose ideas
</p>
<p>of liberty were synonymous with license. He became the con-
</p>
<p>fidante of Jefferson, and not only co-operated with him but
</p>
<p>directed for him those secret and open movements which were
</p>
<p>to end in their triumph. As a return he came within one
</p>
<p>vote of being made "republican" President of the United States.
</p>
<p>Jefferson only obtained the Presidency, after seven days of in-
</p>
<p>tense excitement, by the casting vote of a Federalist. Burr
</p>
<p>thereupon assumed the Vice Presidency. The history of that
</p>
<p>seven days' ballotting forms one of the most remarkable epi-
</p>
<p>sodes in our political annals. It served to divide the republi-
</p>
<p>cans into two factions, but, so powerful were they that, even in
</p>
<p>division they were stronger than their opponents, the Federal-
</p>
<p>ists. Burr took the second position gracefully; served his
</p>
<p>of&ce with ability and plotted for the Chief Magistracy quietly
</p>
<p>but confidently. For this reason he soon grew to be Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son's most powerful and most dreaded antagonist. It behooved
</p>
<p>the President to be rid of such a competitor for democratic fa-
</p>
<p>vor ; therefore all the tremendous machinery of his well or-
</p>
<p>ganised party system was brought to bear. Burr was out-ma-
</p>
<p>noeuvered and failed of a nomination at the hands of the de-

</p>
<p> Prior to the election of 1804 the Constitution had been so amended as to make

<p>the offices of Presidtint and Vice President each separately elective. Up to the

</p>
<p>elected had not Alexander Hamilton cast his powerful local
</p>
<p>influence against the man whom he regarded as a dangerous
</p>
<p>friend and a treacherous foe. In that defeat was recorded the
</p>
<p>fata of Hamilton. There long had rankled in the bosom of
</p>
<p>Burr a hate of the great Federalist leader. Words, written
</p>
<p>and spoken in the heat of an unusually exciting canvass, offer-
</p>
<p>ed, according to the duello's code, apparent cause for a hostile
</p>
<p>meeting. The defeated man challenged his political enemy to
</p>
<p>mortal combat. By avoiding even the possibility of a settle-

<p>ment. Burr forced the unwilling Hamilton to place his body
</p>
<p>as a target for the unerring weapon of his implacable adversa-
</p>
<p>ry. They met July 11th, 1804. Burr, taking the most de-
</p>
<p>liberate aim, shot his antagonist. Hamilton did not design to
</p>
<p>fire, though his pistol exploded from the convulsive motion of
</p>
<p>his finger on the trigger when Burr's ball struck his bosom.
</p>
<p>Burr fled, while the execrations of a nation followed him. He
</p>
<p>tarried a few days in secret, in Philadelphia, to pursue an in-
</p>
<p>trigue with one of his many female victims ; but, the outcry
</p>
<p>becoming appalling even to his unfeeling heart, he sought a
</p>
<p>brief residence, "until the storm should pass over," in the
</p>
<p>Southern States, where a successful duelist ever possessed a
</p>
<p>passport to public and private favor. From thence he jour-
</p>
<p>neyed back to Washington to preside, up to March, 1805, over
</p>
<p>the Senate. In Virginia he had a most enthusiastic public
</p>
<p>reception, at a moment when two warrants were out for his
</p>
<p>arrest as a murderer, one in New York and one in New Jersey.
</p>
<p>At Washington he was received, Parton says, with more defer-
</p>
<p>ence than usual. The President, now beholding his antago-

<p>nist crushed and powerless, could afford to offer him civilities.

</p>
<p>Madison, Secretary of State, rode out with him ; Gallatin, Sec-
</p>
<p>retary of the Treasury, visited him freely ; a leading democra-
</p>
<p>tic member of the House said : " Our little David of the Eepub-
</p>
<p>licans has killed the Goliah of Federalism and for this I am
</p>
<p>willing to reward him." He was the idol of those whose hate
</p>
<p>of Hamilton and Federalism conquered their self-respect and
</p>
<p>their respect for law. At his instance Jefferson named Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson to the ofl&ce of Governor of Louisina. In soliciting that
</p>
<p>ap})ointment the Vice President was taking the initial step
</p>
<p>for his Western schemes. For years these two men had cor-
</p>
<p>responded in cypher; Burr was fully informed of the General's
</p>
<p>Spanish services, and, without doubt, had sounded him so far
</p>
<p>as to feel that, in the ex-stipendiary of Miro, he had the coad-
</p>
<p>jutor most to be desired.
</p>
<p>"When his term of ofl&ce had expired Burr's Western plans
</p>
<p>were so far perfected, that, had he not been detained "by some
</p>
<p>trifling, important concerns of business" in financial matters,
</p>
<p>he would have been off at once, for the West, in pursuit of his
</p>
<p>Utopia.
</p>
<p>Writing from Philadelphia to his son-in-law, Joseph Alston,
</p>
<p>under date of March 22d, 1805, he said : " Though in my for-
</p>
<p>mer letters I did not, in express terms, inform you that I was
</p>
<p>under ostracism, yet it must have been inferred. Such is the
</p>
<p>fact. In New York I am to be disfranchised, and in New Jer-
</p>
<p>sey hanged. Having substantial objections to both I shall not,
</p>
<p>for the present, hazard either, but seek another country." A
</p>
<p>few days later, writing to Mrs. Alston (his daughter Tbeodo-
</p>
<p>sia), he said: "In ten or twelve days I shall be on my way
</p>
<p>westward. My address, until further orders, is at Cincinnati,
</p>
<p>Ohio, care Hon. Jno. Smith. As the objects of this journey,
</p>
<p>not mere curiosity, or pour passer h terns, may lead me to Or-
</p>
<p>leans, and perhaps further."
</p>
<p>These extracts indicate first, his reason for " seeking a new
</p>
<p>country,"' and, second, that he had a special object in view,

</p>
<p>which might lead him to New Orleans, or further. Through-
</p>
<p>out all his correspondence, indeed, construed by the light of
</p>
<p>subsequent events, we find many hints and allusions which
</p>
<p>tend to show that he had arranged before hand, so far as he
</p>
<p>WILKINSON AND BURR. 275
</p>
<p>could so do, all the leading ideas of his secret mission down
</p>
<p>the Mississippi. Parton sajs :
</p>
<p>"A variety of projects lay half formed in Ms mind  projects of land
</p>
<p>speculations, of canal making, of settling in some rising city of the
</p>
<p>West in the practice of the law, of beginning anew his political life as
</p>
<p>the representative of a new State in Congress, If more ambitious
</p>
<p>schemes agitated him they were concealed ; neither in his diary, nor in
</p>
<p>his voluminous correspondence, published or unpublished, is there the
</p>
<p>slightest reference to any but ordinary and legitimate objects during
</p>
<p>the year 1805."
</p>
<p>All of which may be true : but, there is strong inferential
</p>
<p>evidence that his " ambitious schemes" were conceived in the
</p>
<p>Winter of 1804-5 ; that Wilkinson's appointment was one step
</p>
<p>toward their inauguration ; that Burr's voyage down the Ohio
</p>
<p>and Mississippi rivers, his visits to and proven conferences
</p>
<p>with influential revolutionists of the West and South, his re-
</p>
<p>turn by land from New Orleans to Nashville and Kentucky,
</p>
<p>for a second prolonged interview with men known to be ready
</p>
<p>for a crusade against the Spanish dominions, his journey to
</p>
<p>St. Louis for a further conference with Wilkinson, all are cir-
</p>
<p>cumstantial proofs which it is hard to rule out in making up a
</p>
<p>judgment in his case. The efforts made by Wilkinson and
</p>
<p>Matthew Lyon, member of Congress from Kentucky, to secure
</p>
<p>Burr's return to Congress from the Nashville district, and
</p>
<p>Burr's apparent endorsement of their wishes, do not militate
</p>
<p>against any inference which assigns to Burr a clear compre-
</p>
<p>hension of his work in hand. Indeed, his election from Ten-
</p>
<p>nessee or, as was contemplated by him  his return from New
</p>
<p>Orleans as a delegate to Congress  would have impeded, in no
</p>
<p>degree, the prosecution of his plans ; it might, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>have furthered them. Nothing that has been offered in evi-
</p>
<p>dence disproves the idea that Burr had definite designs in his
</p>
<p>first visit to the western country.
</p>
<p>On the 80th of April, 1805, Burr embarked from Pittsburg,

<p>on his first trip down the great river. The journey was made
</p>
<p>on a flatboat, well fitted for comfort and the entertainment of
</p>
<p>guests. The floating house dropped down stream with the
</p>
<p>current, striking shore at all points where its proprietor desired.
</p>
<p>The diary kept by him for his daughter Theodosia, and the
</p>
<p>276 CONSPIRACY OF BURR
</p>
<p>letters reprinted by Davis, in Lis "Life of Burr," give us a
</p>
<p>pleasing picture of people and incidents on tlie way. He was,
</p>
<p>in almost all instances, enthusiastically received. At Mariet-
</p>
<p>ta, Ohio, he landed, nominally to explore the ancient mounds
</p>
<p>in its vicinity, but really to come in contact with leading men
</p>
<p>of that old town. At Blennerhassett's island, a few miles be-
</p>
<p>low, he landed, apparently without design, and there first met
</p>
<p>with the owners of the place. By his winning discourse and
</p>
<p>polished manners he quite captivated the too-credulous conple
</p>
<p>whose fortunes were to be so intimately and disastrously affect-
</p>
<p>ed by their relations with the voyageure. At Cincinnati he
</p>
<p>found several old friends and many ardent admirers. John
</p>
<p>Smith, U. S. Senator from Ohio, and Jonathan Dayton, late
</p>
<p>U. S. Senator from New Jersey, were there to receive him and
</p>
<p>to participate in his counsels.' After a day's tarry at Smith's
</p>
<p>house the excursionist drifted on his way down to Louisville.
</p>
<p>There he found Matthew Lyon. From Louisville he proceed-
</p>
<p>ed by land to Nashville, at which city his welcome was that
</p>
<p>of a public guest. He was domiciled with Andrew JacksoD.
</p>
<p>Matthew Lyon said: "the newspapers described his arrival
</p>
<p>and reception there as one of the most magnificent parades
</p>
<p>that had ever been made at that place. They contained lists
</p>
<p>of toasts and great dinners given in honor of Colonel Burr,
</p>
<p>everybody at and near Nashville seeming to be contending for
</p>
<p>the honor of having best treated or served Colonel Burr."
</p>
<p>These demonstrations must have impressed the visitor favora-
</p>
<p>bly concerning the availability of the western people for use
</p>
<p>in his enterprises, when the hour should come to enlist them.
</p>
<p>Eeturning to the Ohio river in a boat supplied by Jackson, he
</p>
<p>found his own flatboat at the mouth of the Cumberland river.
</p>
<p>At Fort Massac, sixteen miles below, he not unexpectedly met
</p>
<p>Wilkinson. A four days' conference ensued (June 6th, 10th,)
</p>
<p>when Burr abandoned his slow moving ark, and, provided by

<p>* Judge Burnet, in his " Notes" disclaims for Smith any knowledge of Burr'3

<p>fitRR'S VISIT TO NEW ORLEANS. 277
</p>
<p>with a sergeant and ten able, faithful hands," the trip to New
</p>
<p>Orleans was accomplished by June 25th. There he tarried
</p>
<p>until Jul}^ 10th, in secret conference with the rich merchant
</p>
<p>Daniel Clark, who, it afterwards was proven, was then success-
</p>
<p>fully enlisted in Burr's " land speculations," and in his Mexi-
</p>
<p>can expedition. Burr bore a letter of introduction from Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson to Clark, in which it was said : "If the persecutions of
</p>
<p>a great and honorable man can give title to generous attentions
</p>
<p>he has claims to all your civilities and all your services. * * To
</p>
<p>him I refer you for many things improper to letter, and which
</p>
<p>he will not say to any other." His reception exceeded in en-
</p>
<p>thusiasm every demonstration yet made. Dinners, public and
</p>
<p>private; balls; fetes; receptions, made the guest forget the
</p>
<p>dead Hamilton and the persecutions he had left behind. But,
</p>
<p>in the midst of all those festive offerings, Burr was secretly
</p>
<p>busy ; and here it is that vague speculation as to his purposes
</p>
<p>begins to take a consistent form. What were those purposes ?
</p>
<p>We may give Barton's presentment as being the best yet made
</p>
<p>in Burr's behalf He says :
</p>
<p>" The question has been answered, first, by Wilkinson in his ponder-
</p>
<p>ous Memoirs ; secondly, by Clark in his angry octavo, entitled, ' Proofs
</p>
<p>of the Corruption of General James Wilkinson, and of his Connection
</p>
<p>with Aaron Burr ;' thirdly, by Matthew L. Davis, speaking for Burr
</p>
<p>himself Wilkinson says the reference in his letter of introduction, was
</p>
<p>simply to the election scheme. Clark declares that Burr confided no-
</p>
<p>thing to him whatever. He says he liked Burr exceedingly, invited
</p>
<p>him to dinner, showed him every possible civility, but had not a sylla-
</p>
<p>ble of confidential conversation with him. In the most positive and
</p>
<p>circumstantial manner, he denies that he had then, or ever had, any
</p>
<p>participation in, or knowledge of, Burr's designs.* Davis, on the con-
</p>
<p>* Clark's own comments on Wilkinson's letter are as follows: "The things
</p>
<p>which it was improper to letter to me are pretty plainly expressed in a communi-
</p>
<p>cation made about the same time (by Wilkinson) to General Adair. The letter is
</p>
<p>dated, Rapids of Ohio, May 28th, 1805, 11 o'clock, and contains these expressions :

</p>
<p>He understands your merits, and reckons on you. Repair to me and I will tell
</p>
<p>you all. We must have a peep at the unknown world beyond me.' The letter to
</p>
<p>me I think fully proves that some secret plan of Burr's was known to Wilkinson in
</p>
<p>May, 1805. That to General Adair leaves no doubt on the subject. Immediately
</p>
<p>after this he went to St. Louis, where his very first act, before he had broken
</p>
<p>bread in the territory, was an endeavor to bring Major BruflF into his plans. He

<p>trary, asserts that Clark and Wilkinson were both ardently engaged
</p>
<p>with Burr ; and that Clark agreed to advance fifty thousand dollars in
</p>
<p>furtherance of the great project. Other friends of Burr say that Clark
</p>
<p>made two voyages to Vera Cruz, to spy out the enemy's country. Clark
</p>
<p>admits having made the voyages (one in September, 1805, the other in
</p>
<p>February, 1806) ; admits having collected information in Mexico re-
</p>
<p>specting the strength of the fortresses, the number .of the garrisons and
</p>
<p>the disposition of the jjeople; but asserts that his voyages had none but
</p>
<p>commercial objects, and that his inquiries were only prompted by curi-
</p>
<p>osity. A witness deposed to having heard Clark say, that he would
</p>
<p>vsdllingly join in a private scheme for the conquest of Mexico, provided
</p>
<p>the adventurers could turn their backs for ever on the United States.
</p>
<p>' You, for example, might be a duke,' was one expression which the wit-
</p>
<p>ness swore he had heard Clark use in the course of the same conversa-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>" My own impression, after reading all the procurable documents, is,
</p>
<p>that neither Clark nor Wilkinson were embarked in Burr's Mexican
</p>
<p>scheme ; though both, up to a certain point, may have ftivored it. Nor
</p>
<p>do I think that, during this visit to New Orleans, Burr himself did more
</p>
<p>than collect information, and cast a very wistful eye across the river to
</p>
<p>the domain of the hated Spaniards, who still held the western bank of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi."
</p>
<p>Having accomplished the first objects of his mission, and
</p>
<p>satisfied himself that New Orleans was ripe for any coup detat
</p>
<p>he might determine upon, Burr proceeded by land to Nash-
</p>
<p>ville by way of Natchez, reaching General Jackson's hospitable
</p>
<p>home August 6th, where he remained one week  the recipi-
</p>
<p>ent of attentions, public and private, of the most flattering
</p>
<p>character. He then journeyed into Kentucky by way of
</p>
<p>Frankfort and Lexington, evidently "feeling" of men and pub-
</p>
<p>lic opinion. From Louisville he directed his steps to St. Louis,
</p>
<p>for another conference with Wilkinson. The General, in his
</p>
<p>account of that interview, afterwards said :
</p>
<p>" Burr seemed to be revolving some great project, the nature of which

</p>
<p>he did not disclose. Speaking of the imbecility of the Government,
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr said : 'it would molder to pieces, die a natural death," or
</p>
<p>words to that effect; adding 'that the people of the Western country
</p>
<p>were ready for revolt.' To this I recollect replying, that if he had not
</p>
<p>tells him that he had a 'grand scheme,^ that ' would make the fortunes of all con-
</p>
<p>cerned ;' and though Major Bruflf's manner of receiving this overture put a stop to
</p>
<p>any further disclosures, jet we may judge of its nature, for it was introduced by a
</p>
<p>philippic against democracy, and the ingratitude of republican goveraments."
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's duplicity. 279
</p>
<p>profited more by his journey, he had better have reruained at Washing-
</p>
<p>ton or Philadelphia. For surely, said I, my friend, no person Avas ever
</p>
<p>more mistaken ! The Western people disaffected to the Government ?
</p>
<p>They are bigoted to Jefferson and democracy ! and the conversation
</p>
<p>dropped."
</p>
<p>This would appear, upon its face, to exculpate Wilkinson
</p>
<p>from all previous knowledge of Burr's schemes, and go to de-
</p>
<p>monstrate that he (W.) was a patriotic devotee of the Union.
</p>
<p>A knowledge of the man, however  as learned from his prior
</p>
<p>services in behalf of the Spaniards  and the fact that from
</p>
<p>that time (Sept. 1805) to the following May, six cypher letters
</p>
<p>were written by Burr to him, every one of which were in the
</p>
<p>highest degree confidential and important, prove to us that
</p>
<p>Wilkinson acted in his old character of dissimulator in his
</p>
<p>record of what passed at the interview held at St. Louis. Davis
</p>
<p>says :
</p>
<p>" The great object of Burr was the conquest of Mexico. With this
</p>
<p>view he conferred with General Wilkinson, who was ardent in the cause.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's regular force, about six hundred men, was intended as a
</p>
<p>nucleus, around which the followers of Burr were to form. They were
</p>
<p>the only disciplined corps that could be expected. As W. was the
</p>
<p>American Commander-in-Chief (General-in-Chief) and stationed upon
</p>
<p>the borders of Mexico, he possessed the power and was pledged to strike
</p>
<p>the blow whenever it should be deemed exj^edient. This commence-
</p>
<p>ment of the war would thus have been apparently under the sanction
</p>
<p>and authority of the American Government, and would have drawn to
</p>
<p>the standard of Burr numerous volunteers from the Western States.
</p>
<p>Such, undoubtedly, was the plan; Burr entertained no suspicion of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's treachery toward him until his interview with Swartwout. "
</p>
<p>This is true. Burr wrote in reassured confidence to Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, acted in confidence, concerted in confidence, until first
</p>
<p>informed of his (W.'s) treachery by the issue of Jefferson s
</p>
<p>proclamation for his (Burr's) apprehension, Nov. 27th, 1806.

<p>From St. Louis Burr proceeded eastward, by way of Yin-

</p>
<p>navj. The moment seemed propitious. A war witn Spain
</p>
<p>threatened. The Dons beyond the Mississippi (west side) and
</p>
<p>on the Sabine, had committed many acts calculated to arouse
</p>
<p>the western people to a war of extermination. Everywhere
</p>
<p>throughout the West Burr found a spirit of intense rancor pre-
</p>
<p>vailing against the Spanish, who yet retained several impor-
</p>
<p>tant posts in the old Louisiana territory as well as in Florida.
</p>
<p>For several years prior to 1805 the people were only restrained
</p>
<p>from proceeding to extremities with their Eoman Catholic
</p>
<p>neighbors by the constant vigilance of the authorities at the
</p>
<p>National Capital. Burr ever had been an advocate of a deter-
</p>
<p>mined course toward the crown of Spain  for which reason
</p>
<p>he was greeted with favor ; and his visit to the West, during
</p>
<p>1805, was regarded by the people as having something to do
</p>
<p>with the foreigners on our borders. Jefferson, apprehending
</p>
<p>the resentment of France in event of a war with Spain, had
</p>
<p>pursued a policy characterized by timidity and deference to the
</p>
<p>power of Napoleon ; but, so great became the causes of com-
</p>
<p>plaint, during 1805, that, in his messages of Dec. 8d-9th, 1805,
</p>
<p>the President was constrained to use strong terms of denunci-
</p>
<p>ation. When Burr arrived from the West it was to find the
</p>
<p>war spirit running high  so high, indeed, that, for months, a
</p>
<p>declaration of hostilities was daily expected. He seemed to
</p>
<p>read his future by the light of the fires then kindled. That he
</p>
<p>labored assiduously to gather resources for his majestic plans
</p>
<p>of conquest, we can well imagine. If before he had conceived
</p>
<p>a stroke for Mexico feasible, it now seemed near its realization
</p>
<p>under auspices of a state of actual war. His plans took a
</p>
<p>wider range, or, what had been merely dreams of power, be-
</p>
<p>came established principles of action, if we may credit his rev-
</p>
<p>elations to General Eaton, to which reference will hereafter be
</p>
<p>made. Having been "dined" by Jefierson, and treated with
</p>
<p>distingaished consideration by the authorities at Washington,
</p>
<p>he left the new Capital, with its sparse population and its

<p>dreary distances, to take up headquarters in ' the old Capital,
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, then the recognized social and political centre.
</p>
<p>He rented a small house in a retired part of the city that he
</p>
<p>might pursue his labors unobserved, and, being divorced from
</p>
<p>EEVELATIONS TO EATON. 281
</p>
<p>Bociety, could devote his entire time to labor. The little
</p>
<p>dwelling ere long became a rendezvous for men of high and
</p>
<p>low degree, whom the Conspirator received, in almost all in-
</p>
<p>stances, singly. Captivating in manner, gifted with wonderful-
</p>
<p>ly seductive powers of speech, using fact, fancy and fabrication
</p>
<p>in a way to confound every opposing circumstance or element,
</p>
<p>he had no difficulty in gathering to his net great numbers of
</p>
<p>the adventurous spirits, willing to stake fortune, honor and
</p>
<p>happiness on his cast. He had a special word for all. Each
</p>
<p>visitor, regarding himself sole confidant of the wily ex- Vice
</p>
<p>President, withdrew from the little dwelling to labor in his be-
</p>
<p>half, or to preserve the secret of the enterprise proposed until
</p>
<p>the propitious moment. And yet, it is quite certain that Burr
</p>
<p>committed to none, if we except General Eaton, the daring
</p>
<p>purposes which apparently underlaid his adventure. He wrote
</p>
<p>much and talked little, scarcely appearing in public. Even
</p>
<p>his most trusted political partisans were ignorant of the grand
</p>
<p>designs revolving and perfecting in his busy brain. To them
</p>
<p>he still was the political intriguant, planning, devising, schem-
</p>
<p>ing for their own as well as for his own advancement. Mis-
</p>
<p>sions, embassies, local offices were talked of for him, while he,
</p>
<p>in turn, used his influence to obtain those places for others.
</p>
<p>He thus appeared in a two-fold character, ready for political
</p>
<p>place and power, but never for one moment deserting the daz-
</p>
<p>zling object of his ambition  the conquest of Spanish do-
</p>
<p>minions.
</p>
<p>Confidant, at length, of ultimate success in that direction,
</p>
<p>the conspirator dropped his mask for a moment and broke the
</p>
<p>seal of secrecy to General Eaton, then late U. S. Consul to
</p>
<p>Tripoli. This individual, having planned the romantic expe-
</p>
<p>dition against Derne, was upon the point of seeing his work
</p>
<p>consummated, when a treaty, unexpectedly concluded with
</p>
<p>Tripoli, dashed his hopes and ended his labors. He returned
</p>
<p>to the United States quite out of temper with Government for

</p>
<p>surate "with his merits as a dashing leader and with the claims
</p>
<p>of his broken pecuniary fortunes. As we learn from Eaton's
</p>
<p>testimony, given at the trial of Burr, the ex-Yice President
</p>
<p>approached him first with propositions to embark in the expe-
</p>
<p>dition against Mexico, into which he (Eaton) enlisted, under-
</p>
<p>standing that it was countenanced by the Administration, with
</p>
<p>whom Burr still sustained cordial relations. After having se-
</p>
<p>cured the General's consent to the invasion adventure, Burr,
</p>
<p>so Eaton testified, finally developed a project for revolution-
</p>
<p>izing the Western country, establishing a monarchy, organi-
</p>
<p>zing a force of ten or twelve thousand volunteers ; when, hav-
</p>
<p>ing secured the co-operation of the marine corps at Washington
</p>
<p>and gaining over Truxton, Preble, Decatur and others, he in-
</p>
<p>tended to turn Congress out of doors, assassinate the President,
</p>
<p>seize on the Treasury and Navy, and declare himself the Pro-
</p>
<p>tector of an energetic government ! All of this extraordinary
</p>
<p>programme Eaton swore was clearly and unequivocally de-
</p>
<p>tailed to him. Wilkinson was declared by Burr to be a party
</p>
<p>to the scheme  was to bring over to it his army in the West
</p>
<p>and South, and was to act as General-in-Chief, while Eaton
</p>
<p>was to have the second command.
</p>
<p>As Eaton, according to his own testimony, expressed abhor-
</p>
<p>rence of this revolutionary plot, and utterly refused to partici-
</p>
<p>pate in it, the question naturally occurs why did he not at
</p>
<p>once divulge the matter ? He was under no bond to secrecy.
</p>
<p>He had position enough to sustain his word against that of
</p>
<p>Burr, should the latter deny the impeachment. The excuse
</p>
<p>offered was that he was fearful to put his own reputation for
</p>
<p>veracity against that of the Conspirator ; yet, he confesses to
</p>
<p>have advised with Jefferson in regard to a foreign appointment
</p>
<p>for Burr ! We may quote from the testimony :
</p>
<p>" Ou the solitai'y ground upon whicli I stood, I was at a loss how to
</p>
<p>conduct myself, though at no loss as respected my duty. I durst not

</p>
<p>place my lonely testimony in the balance against the weight of Colonel
</p>
<p>Burr's character ; for, by turning the tables upon me, which I thought
</p>
<p>any nian, capable of such a project, was very capable of doing, I should
</p>
<p>sink under the weight. I resolved, therefore, with myself to obtain the
</p>
<p>removal of Mr. Burr from this country in a way honorable to him ; and
</p>
<p>on this I did consult him, without his knowing my motive. According-
</p>
<p>GENERAL EATON's TESTIMONY. 283
</p>
<p>ly, I waited on the President of the United States, and after a desultory
</p>
<p>conversation, in which I aimed to draw his view to the westward, I
</p>
<p>took the liberty of suggesting to the President that I thought Colonel
</p>
<p>Burr ought to be removed from the country, because I considered him
</p>
<p>dangerous in it. The President asked where we should send him ?
</p>
<p>Other places might have been mentioned, but I believe that Paris, Lon-
</p>
<p>don and Madrid, were the places which were particularly named. The
</p>
<p>President, without positive exjDression (in such a matter of delicacy),
</p>
<p>signified that the trust was too imi^ortant, and expressed something
</p>
<p>like a doubt about the integi-ity of Mr. Burr. I frankly told the Pres-
</p>
<p>ident that perhaps no person had stronger grounds to suspect that
</p>
<p>integrity than I had ; but that I believed his pride of ambition had
</p>
<p>so predominated over his other passions, that when placed on an
</p>
<p>eminence, and put on his honor, a respect to himself would secure
</p>
<p>his fidelity, I perceived that the subject was disagreeable to the
</p>
<p>President, and to bring him to my point in the shortest mode, and
</p>
<p>at the same time point out the danger, I said to him that I expect-
</p>
<p>ed that we should in eighteen months have an insurrection, if not a
</p>
<p>revolution, on the waters of the Mississij^pi. The President said he
</p>
<p>had too much confidence in the information, the integrity, and at-
</p>
<p>tachment to the Union of the citizens of that country, to admit any
</p>
<p>apprehensions of that kind. The circumstance of no interrogatories
</p>
<p>being made to me, I thought imx)osed silence upon me at that time
</p>
<p>and place."
</p>
<p>Commodore Truxton confessed to having had propositions
</p>
<p>from Burr to embark in a scheme, " legitimate in war," as B.
</p>
<p>averred, against Mexico  that nothing more was proposed.

</p>
<p>all of which was understood to have been done with Jefferson's approbation, if not

<p>by his direct orders  Eaton received ten thousand dollars from Government as in-
</p>
<p>demnity for his Barbary losses. It was in the midst of excitements caused by
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's proceedings that he came forward with published affidavits to expose
</p>
<p>Burr. His statements tended, of course, to create a public sentiment against Burr,
</p>
<p>and to sustain the conduct of Wilkinson. That the money paid to him had any
</p>
<p>thing to do in eliciting his testimony is not probable. The money had long been

<p>due.

</p>
<p>or less direct to their plans, yet too obscure or general in terms
</p>
<p>to afford any clue as to their exact significance. One thing
</p>
<p>they did prove  that Wilkinson was deeply concerned in what-
</p>
<p>ever was proposed. No effort of his friends, no confidence of
</p>
<p>the Administration in his patriotism and fidelity, could white-
</p>
<p>wash from his Gubernatorial and military escutcheon the stains
</p>
<p>of these mysteriously confidential notes. We may quote from
</p>
<p>one written in the spring of 1806 :
</p>
<p>" The execution of our project is postponed till December. Want of
</p>
<p>water in Ohio rendered movement impracticable : other reasons ren-
</p>
<p>dered delay expedient. The association is enlarged, and comprises
</p>
<p>all that Wilkinson could wish. Confidence limited to a few. Though
</p>
<p>this delay is irksome, it will enable us to move with more certainty
</p>
<p>and dignity. Burr, will be throughout the United States this summer.
</p>
<p>Administration is damned, which Randoljih aids. Burr wrote you a
</p>
<p>long letter last December, replying to a short one deemed very silly.
</p>
<p>Nothing has been heard from the Brigadier (Wilkinson) since October,
</p>
<p>Is Cusion (Colonel Cushing) et Portes (Major Porter) right ? Address,
</p>
<p>Burr, at Washington."
</p>
<p>Parton observes : " That Wilkinson hneiv what Burr propos-
</p>
<p>ed, I cannot doubt ; but that he had unequivocally engaged to
</p>
<p>join in the projected speculation, is a question upon which
</p>
<p>there may be two well sustained opinions."
</p>
<p>It is hardly possible to conceive that he knew what Burr
</p>
<p>proposed and yet did not lend himself to the scheme fully.
</p>
<p>All collateral evidence goes to show that he did engage in the
</p>
<p>" speculation," and that Burr, when he stated to Eaton, Trux-
</p>
<p>ton and others that Wilkinson was enlisted in the enterprise
</p>
<p>as first in military command, spoke authoritatively. We are
</p>
<p>not disposed, knowing what we now do in regard to that Gen-
</p>
<p>eral-in-Chief's duplicity, even to ascribe to Burr the chief merit
</p>
<p>of the Mexican enterprise : Burr's only originality in the mat-
</p>
<p>ter appears to have been his superadded idea of annexing the

<p>Western States of the Union to his Spanish estate, with a re-
</p>
<p>mote possibility of turning the Government at Washington
</p>
<p>out of doors. Matthew Davis says :
</p>
<p>" Daniel Clarke, of New Orleans, entered into the Mexican project.
</p>
<p>He engaged to advance fifty thousand dollars ; but subsequently, from
</p>
<p>disappointments, he was unable to fill his contract. General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>detailed to Colonel Burr all the information he possessed respecting that
</p>
<p>THE MISSION TO MEXICO. 285
</p>
<p>country, and pointed out the facilities which would probablj' be afford-
</p>
<p>ed by the inhabitants in effecting a revolution. Without Wilkinson's
</p>
<p>troops, Burr declared most solemnly, a short time before his death, that
</p>
<p>he would not have made the attempt on Mexico ; that he was perfectly
</p>
<p>aware the men he would collect, so far as it respected military opera-
</p>
<p>tions, would be at first little better than a mob.
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr had repeated conferences on the subject with Mr. Merry,
</p>
<p>the British Plenipotentiary resident in the United States. Mr. Merry
</p>
<p>communicated to his government the project of Mr. Burr. Colonel
</p>
<p>Charles Williamson, the brother of Lord Balgray, went to England on
</p>
<p>the business, and, from the encouragement which he received, it was
</p>
<p>hoped and believed that a British naval squadron would have been
</p>
<p>furnished in aid of the expedition. At this juncture Mr. Pitt died.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson must have heard of the death of the premier late in the
</p>
<p>spring or early in the summer of 1806. From this moment, in IVIr. Burr'a
</p>
<p>opinion, Wilkinson became alarmed, and resolved on an abandonment
</p>
<p>of the enterprise at the sacrifice of his associates.
</p>
<p>" On the suggestion of Wilkinson, Mexico was twice visited by Dan-
</p>
<p>iel Clark. He held conferences and effected arrangements -nath many
</p>
<p>of the principal militia officers, who engaged to favor the revolution.
</p>
<p>The Catholic bishop, resident at New Orleans, was also consulted, and
</p>
<p>prepared to promote the enterprise. He designated three priests of the
</p>
<p>order of Jesuits, as suitable agents, and they were accordingly employed.
</p>
<p>The bishop was an intelligent and social man. He had been in Mexico,
</p>
<p>and spoke with great freedom of the dissatisfaction of the clergy in
</p>
<p>South America. The religious establishments of the country were not
</p>
<p>to be molested. Madame Xavier Tarjcon, superior of the convent of
</p>
<p>Ursuline nuns at New Orleans, was in the secret. Some of the sister-
</p>
<p>hood were also employed in Mexico. So far as any decision had been
</p>
<p>formed, the landing was to have been effected at Tampico."
</p>
<p>A careful study of the testimony adduced at Burr's Eich-
</p>
<p>raond trial, and by subsequent developments, leads us to the
</p>
<p>belief that Wilkinson himself led Colonel Burr on to these

<p>plans of conquest, taking the initiative, so far as he dared to,
</p>
<p>in missions to Mexico, and in intrigues in the South, His (Ws)
</p>
<p>own testimony to the contrary, as written out in his " Memoirs,"
</p>
<p>has but little weight, in our mind, where not sustained by cor-
</p>
<p>roborative or collateral evidence of a conclusive nature  such
</p>
<p>is our want of faith in the man's integrity. When we reflect
</p>
<p>upon the proofs now existing of his duplicity and dishonesty,
</p>
<p>it seems incredible that he should have won and retained the
</p>
<p>confidence of Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States.
</p>
<p>286 CONSPIRACY OF BURR.
</p>
<p>If Jefferson's enemies make use of his intimate relations with
</p>
<p>Tom Paine, Wilkinson and other men of blunted moral per-
</p>
<p>ceptions, to prove his own indifference to moral principles, thej
</p>
<p>certainly are not without strong grounds, at least inferential,
</p>
<p>of justification. It is the application of Esop's haecfabula docet
</p>
<p>in the fable of the goose and the buzzards.
</p>
<p>Burr's movements in the spring and summer of 1806 were
</p>
<p>governed by our relations with Spain. An actual state of war
</p>
<p>would legitimise his operations. He could then proceed openly
</p>
<p>in his plans so far as the invasion of Mexico was concerned.
</p>
<p>"As spring advanced," says Parton, "affairs in the South-west
</p>
<p>looked more and more threatenmg. The Spaniards added ag-
</p>
<p>gression to insolence. It had been agreed between the two
</p>
<p>governments, that until the boundary line should be settled
</p>
<p>by negotiation, each party should retain its posts, but establish
</p>
<p>no new ones, nor make any military movements whatever
</p>
<p>within the limits in dispute. But, after making several petty
</p>
<p>encroachments, the Spanish commander, early in June, ad-
</p>
<p>vanced a force of twelve hundred men to within twenty miles
</p>
<p>of Nachitoches Instantly, General Wilkinson took measures
</p>
<p>for the defense of the frontier. He had only six hundred reg-
</p>
<p>ulars under his command, most of whom were hurried forward
</p>
<p>to the scene of expected warfare. ' The forts of New Orleans
</p>
<p>were hastily repaired. Every militiaman in the West was
</p>
<p>furbishing his accoutrements, and awaiting the summons to
</p>
<p>the field. On the 4th of Julj, 1806, there were not a thou-
</p>
<p>sand persons in the United States who did not think war with
</p>
<p>Spain inevitable, impending, begun ! The country desired it.
</p>
<p>A blow from Wilkinson, a word from Jefferson, would have
</p>
<p>let loose the dogs of war, given us Texas, and changed the
</p>
<p>history of the two continents."
</p>
<p>But, the war did not follow, nevertheless. Pitt, the British
</p>
<p>Prime Minister, having died, (Jan. 6th, 1806,) Napoleon was,

</p>
<p>for the moment, doubly reassured as master of the situation :
</p>
<p> a stroke upon our part against Spain was to incur his hos-
</p>
<p>tilitya contingency which Mr. Jefferson did not care to ac-
</p>
<p>cept. Hence, no aggressive step followed ; Wilkinson's me-
</p>
<p>nace on the Sabine was that and nothing more.
</p>
<p>THE BASTROP PURCHASE. 287
</p>
<p>Pitt's death, as stated by Mattliew Davis, was a severe blow
</p>
<p>to Burr's arrangements, dashing, as it did, all hopes of British
</p>
<p>nav^al operations against Vera Cruz and Tampico, These sev-
</p>
<p>eral disappointments, it would appear, directed Burr's mind
</p>
<p>more strongly to his second resource, viz.: the purchase of an
</p>
<p>immense body of land in the South-west, where to gather his
</p>
<p>forces, to intrigue and arrange for his Spanish invasion at his
</p>
<p>leisure. Davis says : " Previous to the cession of Louisiana to
</p>
<p>the United States, Baron P. N. Tut Bastrop contracted with
</p>
<p>the Spanish Government for a tract of land exceeding thirty
</p>
<p>miles square near Nachitoches. By the terms of the contract
</p>
<p>he was, within a given period of time, to settle upon these
</p>
<p>lands two hundred families. Subsequently Colonel Charles
</p>
<p>Lynch made an arrangement with Bastrop for an interest in
</p>
<p>this contract. Burr purchased from Lynch nearly four hun-
</p>
<p>dred thousand acres, lying between the Sabine and Nachito-
</p>
<p>ches. On the trial at Eichmond this purchase was established,
</p>
<p>and the actual payment to Lynch by Burr of five thousand
</p>
<p>dollars was also proved."
</p>
<p>General Adair, however, intimates that it was not until after
</p>
<p>the discovery, by Burr, of Wilkinson's defection, in the fall of
</p>
<p>1806, that he "turned his attention altogether towards strength-
</p>
<p>ening himself on the Wachita,* and waiting a more favorable
</p>
<p>crisis." This doubtless is true as qualified: " turned his at-
</p>
<p>tention altogether^'' Adair says ; prior to that tilne it was the
</p>
<p>''second string to his bow," artfully used to cover his real pur-
</p>
<p>poses. Of this purchase, made in July, 1806, Davis writes :
</p>
<p>" The grant of the Sjjanisli government to Bastrop amounted to
</p>
<p>1,300,000 acres. Six-tenths of this grant was conveyed to Colonel
</p>
<p>* There is great discrepancy in the location of this purchase. Davis expressly
</p>
<p>states the Pastrop cession to have been a tract of land thirty miles square near
</p>
<p>Nachitoches, and that Burr's purchase of Lynch was four hundred thousand acres
</p>
<p>lying between the Sabine and Nachitoches. General Adair refers to the estate as on

</p>
<p>refers to it in general terms as " far to the South-west, beyond the Mississippi, on
</p>
<p>the banks of the river Wachita, a branch of the Red river." The correct location

<p>is thus given by Hildreth : " Situate on the upper waters of the Wachita, not many

<p>Lynch, and cost him about one hundred thousand dollars. As the time
</p>
<p>within which two hundred families were to be settled on the land was
</p>
<p>rapidly drawing to a close, Lynch conveyed one half his right to Burr
</p>
<p>for fifty thousand dollars. In this purchase many private citizens of
</p>
<p>worth and respectability were interested. The two projects, however,
</p>
<p>became in some degree blended."
</p>
<p>In regard to the " many private citizens of wortli and re-
</p>
<p>spectability" here referred to, Parton sftys :
</p>
<p>" In this purchase, several persons participated, most of whom were
</p>
<p>near relatives or connections of Burr. One of his relatives in Connecti-
</p>
<p>cut, a descendant of Jonathan Edwards, advanced a great part of his
</p>
<p>savings for this purchase. Mr. Alston, probably, furnished money ; it
</p>
<p>is certain he endorsed paper for his father-in-law. Burr's connections
</p>
<p>in New York were not backward in aiding him. From one source and
</p>
<p>another, a sum was raised which, as I conjecture, did not exceed forty
</p>
<p>thousand dollars, though more was to be forthcoming when needed.
</p>
<p>" Who were his confederates ? Before aU others, his daughter, M'ho
</p>
<p>was devoted to the scheme heart and soul. To achieve a career, and a
</p>
<p>residence, which she, her husband, and her boy could share, were the
</p>
<p>darling objects with which Burr had gone forth to seek a new country.
</p>
<p>She caught eagerly at his proposal. She saw in it the means whereby
</p>
<p>her father could win a glorious compensation for the wrongs she felt he
</p>
<p>had endured, and obtain a conspicuous triumph over all his enemies.
</p>
<p>Her husband, whose mind Burr had aided to form, and who tenderly
</p>
<p>loved Theodosia, entered into the enterprise with energy. In New York,
</p>
<p>it found adherents among the young ambitious men who had surround-
</p>
<p>ed him in the days of his glory. The Swartwouts were in it. Marinas
</p>
<p>Willet, who was afterward Mayor of New York, was one of its promot-
</p>
<p>ers. A score or two of other New Yorkers were involved in a greater
</p>
<p>or less degree. Doctor Erich Bollman, a German, who had distinguish-
</p>
<p>ed himself by a gallant attempt to rescue Latiiyette from prison, was
</p>
<p>one of Burr's most trusted confederates, Dayton was another. Colonel
</p>
<p>Dupiester was one of the leading spirits. General Jackson, a thorough-

</p>
<p>going hater of Spaniards, was enthusiastic in the cause. General Adair,
</p>
<p>of Kentucky, deep in Burr's confidence, approved his plans heartily, but
</p>
<p>was not personally engaged in them. Blennerhassett was completely
</p>
<p>captivated by an enterprise which was to enrich him and his children
</p>
<p>without his being subjected to disagreeable exertion. Upon his island
</p>
<p>the first rendezvous was to be made. Mrs. Blennerhassett, no less ar-
</p>
<p>dent, was preparing to entertain the chief and his daughter at her fan-
</p>
<p>tastic mansion ; for it was settled that Theodosia should accompany
</p>
<p>her father, and that both she and Mrs. Blennerhassett should go with
</p>
<p>the expedition as far as Natchez or New Orleans ; there to await the
</p>
<p>issue. Alston was to follow in a few weeks. Probably five hundred

</p>
<p>persons in all, knew something of Burr's plans, and had entered into
</p>
<p>some kind of engagement to follow his fortunes. There were, also, four
</p>
<p>or five thousand whose names were on Burr's lists, and who, he thought,
</p>
<p>would hasten to his standard, as soon as he should obtain a fooihold on
</p>
<p>Spanish soil."
</p>
<p>There can, then, be no question of the immense influence
</p>
<p>which Burr wielded : that he should have embarked so many
</p>
<p>persons of ability and good character in his projects is a con
</p>
<p>elusive tribute to his tact, his industry and his profound dis-
</p>
<p>simulation.
</p>
<p>Burr was not ready to move before the latter part of July.
</p>
<p>Previous to starting from Philadelphia he wrote in cypher to
</p>
<p>Wilkinson a communication detailing the processes of the plot,
</p>
<p>quite minutely, betraying to his coadjutor the full extent of
</p>
<p>his contemplated work, and the programme for its execution.
</p>
<p>This most interesting and important letter he dispatched by
</p>
<p>the hands of two couriers, Samuel Swartwout, and a son of
</p>
<p>Matthew Ogden, of New Jersey. The two young men pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded West by way of Pittsburg to St Louis, where Burr
</p>
<p>supposed Wilkinson still to be. Bat, tbe General-in-Chief
</p>
<p>was not there : he was down in Lower Louisiana, at Nachito-
</p>
<p>ches  a fact which materially affected the consummation of the
</p>
<p>concerted movement  Burr having arranged to have him
</p>
<p>(W.) move down the Mississippi, as a distinct section of the
</p>
<p>expedition. We shall see how the presence of Wilkinson in
</p>
<p>Louisiana, in advance of Burr's coming, caused the explosion
</p>
<p>of the whole enterprise.
</p>
<p>Six days after the couriers left, Burr started for Pittsburg,
</p>
<p>accompanied by Theodosia, Colonel Dupeister and two others.
</p>
<p>His departure from the East excited comparatively little at-
</p>
<p>tention, nor did the gossips " snuff the air" until two months
</p>
<p>Iti.er, when word came back from the West of the din of pre-
</p>
<p>paration on the Ohio river which followed his advent. A

</p>
<p>unveiling as much of the old Spanish intrigues of Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>Sebastian, Innis and others as could be dragged to the light
</p>
<p>Hence, soon after Burr reached the Ohio country he found
</p>
<p>himself suspected by the then few persons who still preserved
</p>
<p>their Federalism, and connected their old distrust of the ends
</p>
<p>and aims of " democratic societies" with the new movements.
</p>
<p>A '' democratic" paper at Pittsburg, the Commonwealth^ imme-
</p>
<p>diately after Burr's appearance in the West opened its columns
</p>
<p>to a discussion of Western claims to independency, laboring
</p>
<p>zealously to enkindle the old Whiskey insurrection spirit.
</p>
<p>These articles soon were responded to by a series published in
</p>
<p>the Ohix) Gazette^ printed at Chilicothe, then the State capital,
</p>
<p>over the signature of " Querist," furnished by Blennerhasset
</p>
<p>but afterwards ascribed to the tireless pen of Burr. "Querist"
</p>
<p>labored to show the necessity for separation from the Union
</p>
<p>east of the mountains, and to establish a Confederation compos-
</p>
<p>ed of States west of the Alleghanies, embracing also as much
</p>
<p>of the South as should give the new Confederacy entire con-
</p>
<p>trol of the Mississippi and the Gulf ports. By September 1st
</p>
<p>the public mind in Kentucky and Ohio was thoroughly arous-
</p>
<p>ed, and Aaron Burr's name was linked with e\Qvj report of
</p>
<p>disunion and the conquest of Spanish dominion.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, though afar off in Louisiana, heard these mutter-
</p>
<p>ings on the Ohio ; his name was connected with the indefinable
</p>
<p>greatness coming. It is quite probable that, then weighing the
</p>
<p>chances of promotion and honor in the scale, he resolved to
</p>
<p>break with Burr, and, by defeating his projects, to win the
</p>
<p>reputation of a deliverer.
</p>
<p>Burr, floating down the Ohio, stopped at points indicated in
</p>
<p>his lists as favorable for securing recruits. A visit was paid
</p>
<p>to old Colonel Morgan, the Eevolutionary patriot and pioneer,
</p>
<p>living, with his two sons, near Cannonsburg, Ohio. It was the
</p>
<p>Conspirator's design to secure the Colonel and his boys to his

</p>
<p>interest ; but, over confident from his hitherto almost uniform
</p>
<p>success, he found, in the old man's home, hearts which he could
</p>
<p>not move. Morgan was a friend of Burr, sympathising with
</p>
<p>hmi in the Hamilton duel affair. The sons were sent forward
</p>
<p>by tlie father to conduct their august guest to the farm house.
</p>
<p>COLONEL morgan's TESTIMONY. 291
</p>
<p>On the road Burr opened liis mind to one of tlie young men in
</p>
<p>a manner at once startling and confounding. He stated tliat
</p>
<p>the Union was near its dissolution, and that it ought to fail  that
</p>
<p>the West having no interests in common with the East, should
</p>
<p>set up for itself He also made minute inquiries concerning
</p>
<p>the militia of the county, their disposable foi'ce, arms, &e.
</p>
<p>This conversation was the preliminary of what followed after
</p>
<p>dinner. Morgan's testimony taken at the Eichmond trial we
</p>
<p>may repeat, in part :
</p>
<p>" Colonel Burr said, that -with two hundred men he could drive Con-
</p>
<p>gress, with the President at its head, into the river Potomac ; or that it
</p>
<p>might be done ; and he said with five hundred men, he could take pos-
</p>
<p>session of New York. He appealed to Colonel Dupiester, if it could
</p>
<p>not be done : he nodded assent. There was a reply made to this by
</p>
<p>one by my sons, that he would be damned if they could take our little
</p>
<p>town of Cannonsburg with that force. Some short time after this,
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr went out from the dining-room to the passage, and beck-
</p>
<p>oned to my son Thomas. What their conversation was, I cannot say
</p>
<p>soon after, a walk was proposed to my son's mill, and the comi^any
</p>
<p>went out. When they returned, one (or both of my sons) came to cau-
</p>
<p>tion me, and said : ' You may depend upon it. Colonel Burr will thif
</p>
<p>night open himself to you. He wants Tom to go with him.' After the
</p>
<p>usual conversation, Colonel Burr went up stairs, and, as I thought, to
</p>
<p>go to bed. Mrs. Morgan was reading to me (as is usual, when the iam-
</p>
<p>ily have retired), when about eleven o'clock, and after I had supposed
</p>
<p>he had been an hour in bed, she told me that Colonel Burr was coming
</p>
<p>down, and as she had heard my son's conversation, she added, ' You'll
</p>
<p>have it now.' Colonel Burr came down with a candle in his hand. Mrs,
</p>
<p>Morgan immediately retired. The Colonel took his seat by me. He
</p>
<p>drew from his pocket a book. I suppose it was a memorandum-book.
</p>
<p>After looking at it, he asked me if I knew a Mr. Vigo, of Fort Vincent,
</p>
<p>a Si^aniard. I replied, yes ; I knew him ; I had reasons to know him.
</p>
<p>One was that I had reasons to believe that he was deeply involved in

<p>the British conspiracy of 1798, as I supposed; the object of which was
</p>
<p>to separate the States; and which General Neville and myself had sap-
</p>
<p>pressed. I called it a nefarious thing to aim at the division of the States.
</p>
<p>I was careful to put great emphasis on the word '"nefarious!' Colonel
</p>
<p>Burr, finding what kind of a man he had to deal with, suddenly stopped,
</p>
<p>thrust into his pocket the book which I saw had blank leaves in it, and
</p>
<p>retired to bed. I believe I was pretty well understood. The next mor-
</p>
<p>ning Colonel Burr and Colonel Dupiester went off before breakfast,
</p>
<p>without my expecting it."
</p>
<p>The old patriot, anxious and dissatisfied, proceeded to town
</p>
<p>292 CONSPIRACY OF BURR.
</p>
<p>and returned witli two judges from the Court then ia session
</p>
<p>there. To these he detailed minutely all the circumstances of
</p>
<p>Burr's visit. A letter thereupon was drawn up, directed to
</p>
<p>the President of the United States, giving information in re-
</p>
<p>gard to the matter and suggesting that the adventurer be
</p>
<p>closely watched. That letter, Mr. Jefferson stated, was the
</p>
<p>first intimation which he had of Burr's designs. In his special
</p>
<p>message of Jan. 22d, 1807, he said that, in the latter part of
</p>
<p>September he had "received intimations that designs were in
</p>
<p>agitation in the Western country, unlawful and unfriendly to
</p>
<p>the peace of the Union." " It was not," he further said, " till
</p>
<p>the latter part of October that the objects of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>began to be perceived, but still so blended and involved in
</p>
<p>mystery that nothing distinct could be singled out for pursuit."
</p>
<p>Having then had the Cannonsburg letter at least one month he
</p>
<p>adopted the suggestion to watch Burr's movements, and dis-
</p>
<p>patched a confidential agent thither, who, of course, did not
</p>
<p>reach Ohio until far in November. The President certainly
</p>
<p>was not ignorant of affairs in the West up to the dates men-
</p>
<p>tioned. Who better than himself was informed of the work-
</p>
<p>ing of the disunion elements in Kentucky ? Who can doubt
</p>
<p>that copies of the Western World and of the Pittsburg Common-
</p>
<p>loealth were quicklj placed in his hands? The vigilant Jo
</p>
<p>Daviess we know kept the President " posted" ; and, knowing
</p>
<p>all about Aaron Burr's movements, it is rather singular, to say
</p>
<p>the least, that no steps were taken then to arrest the schemer's
</p>
<p>programme. It is highly probable that the President, approv-
</p>
<p>ing of Governor Shelby's version of the Constitutional right
</p>
<p>for American citizens to filibuster [see pages 237-38], prefer-
</p>
<p>red to wait until Burr had openly rendered himself amenable
</p>
<p>to arrest before proceeding to extremity. After he did let
</p>
<p>loose the thunders of the law upon the little Conspirator, all
</p>

<p>to shame by the rigors of Jefferson's patriotic frenzy.
</p>
<p>Leaving Morgan's place Burr proceeded to Marietta, where
</p>
<p>he found the militia attending a "general training." Eiding
</p>
<p>to the field he exercised the men in evolutions and made a fine
</p>
<p>impression. At a ball given that evening the beautiful Theo-
</p>
<p>PREPAEATIONS. 293
</p>
<p>dosia mingled witli tlie motley throng in tlie dance and con-
</p>
<p>firmed the good impression made by the father. It soon was
</p>
<p>noised around that the ex- Vice President was en route for a
</p>
<p>new realm, and that he would accept volunteers. The idea
</p>
<p>was given that, in his proceedings, Burr had the sanction of
</p>
<p>his Government, which left all persons a,t liberty to second his
</p>
<p>movements, and Marietta soon became the centre of military
</p>
<p>activity, in forwarding and directing of which Herman Blen-
</p>
<p>nerhasset soon became the responsible agent. This credulous
</p>
<p>Irishman and his ambitious lady had not seen Burr for a year,
</p>
<p>but, by correspondence, had arranged to embark in his adven-
</p>
<p>ture  never dreaming for a moment, it was afterwards testified,
</p>
<p>that treason lay lurking in the background. Barton says :
</p>
<p>" Leaving his daugbter upon Blennerliassett Island, Burr bent all his
</p>
<p>powers to preparing for the expedition. Contracts for fifteen large bat-
</p>
<p>teaux, to be capable of transporting five hundred men, were entered in-
</p>
<p>to ^at Marietta, and the work forthwith began. Quantities of flour,
</p>
<p>park and meal were purchased. On the island kilns were constructed
</p>
<p>for drying the com. Men were daily added to the rolls, They appear
</p>
<p>to have been engaged for an object which was to be explained to them
</p>
<p>afterwards, but were all to come equipped and armed, and to each was
</p>
<p>promised, as part of the compensation for his services, one hundred
</p>
<p>acres of land on the Wachita. Blennerhassett was busy enough. To
</p>
<p>prepare the Western mind for future contingencies, he wrote a series of
</p>
<p>articles in a neighboring newspaper, in which the advantages of a sepa-
</p>
<p>ration of the Western States from the Eastern were discussed and exhfl)-
</p>
<p>ited. His island resounded with the din of preparation. Mrs. Blenner-
</p>
<p>hassett, happy in the society of Theodosia, full of confidence in her
</p>
<p>father's talents, was all aglow with pleasant expectation. Burr was
</p>
<p>everywhere; now at Marietta; now at Chillicothe; then at Cincinnati;
</p>
<p>through Kentucky and Tennessee ; everywhere gaining adherents, and
</p>
<p>enlarging his acquaintance with men of influence ; received always as
</p>
<p>the great man. Six boats were set building on the Cumberland, and

<p>four thousand dollars deposited with General Jackson to pay for them.
</p>
<p>In October, Mr. Alston arrived, and soon after, he, Theodosia and Blen-
</p>
<p>nerhassett, journeyed, by easy stages, to Lexington, in Kentucky, leaving
</p>
<p>the energetic wife of Blennerhassett upon the island, to superintend the
</p>
<p>great concerns there going forward. On their journey they found the
</p>
<p>country full of rumors respecting Burr, and some scheme he was saiil to
</p>
<p>have in hand ; but they also observed that these rumors were generally
</p>
<p>believed to be groundless ; and attributed to the malice of Burr's old
</p>
<p>enemies, the Federalists."
</p>
<p>294 CONSPIRACY OF BURR.
</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this near approacli of Burr, the United
</p>
<p>States Attornej'- for tlie District of Kentucky, Jo Daviess, re-
</p>
<p>solved to face public opinion, and, without instructions from
</p>
<p>Washington, to call Burr into court to answer the charge of
</p>
<p>being engaged in an enterprise contrary to the laws of the
</p>
<p>United States and designed to injure a power with which the
</p>
<p>Federal Government was at peace. The motion was made
</p>
<p>Nov. 3d, in the District Court at Frankfort, before Judge Tu-
</p>
<p>nis  one of Wilkinson's confreres in Spanish intrigue. This
</p>
<p>motion fell like a thunder clap upon the public ear. Any
</p>
<p>other man than Jo Daviess must have quailed before the fury
</p>
<p>it invoked from seven-eighths of the people. But, the heart of
</p>
<p>that remarkable wild -woods' lawyer was of too stern stuff to
</p>
<p>shrink from duty. He read Burr and despised him. Burr
</p>
<p>read Daviess and feared him, but, with his usual effrontery,
</p>
<p>prepared to meet the danger. The motion, after two days re-
</p>
<p>sei-ve for consideration, was denied; but, Burr was quickl}^ on
</p>
<p>hand to challenge an examination. With surprising self-pos-
</p>
<p>session he asked the Judge to grant the motion, in order that
</p>
<p>it might not trouble him at another moment. It was a master
</p>
<p>stroke, which gave the little man the vantage ground of an
</p>
<p>overwhelming public sympathy; but Daviess gladly closed
</p>
<p>with the proposition and set his day for a hearing, feurr was
</p>
<p>present at the appointed time (the Wednesday succeeding Nov.
</p>
<p>5th). Much to his chagrin, Daviess had to ask for an exten-
</p>
<p>sion of time. John Floyd, an important witness, was absent,
</p>
<p>and Nov. 25th was fixed upon for the hearing. What a mo-
</p>
<p>ment in whi-ch to try the nerves of the immobile Conspirator !
</p>
<p>Time so precious to him  so all-important for success, thus to
</p>
<p>be wasted in awaiting the attendance of witnesses ! What
</p>
<p>might not happen before Nov. 25th ? Word having flown from
</p>
<p>Ohio to Washington an order for his arrest might arrive ere
</p>
<p>that time, and thus dash his prospects forever. By that time

<p>the State authorities might become aware of his deception in
</p>
<p>assuming that he acted with the consent of the Federal autho-
</p>
<p>rities, and, by siezing his flotilla, strip him of every resource.
</p>
<p>Yet, he betrayed not a single sign of impatience or of uneasi-
</p>
<p>ness. He addressed the Court at some length. " He bo]ied

</p>
<p>the good people of Kentucky would dismiss tlieir apprehen-
</p>
<p>sions of danger from him, if any such really existed. There
</p>
<p>was really no ground for them, however zealously the attor-
</p>
<p>ney might strive to awaken them. He was engaged in no pro-
</p>
<p>ject inimical to the peace or tranquillity of the country ; as
</p>
<p>they would certainly learn whenever the attorney should be
</p>
<p>ready, which he greatly apprehended would never be. In the
</p>
<p>mean time, although private business urgently demanded his
</p>
<p>presence elsewhere, he felt compelled to give the attorney one
</p>
<p>more opportunity of proving his charge, and would patiently
</p>
<p>await another attack."
</p>
<p>Henry Clay appeared as Burr's counsel, having first received
</p>
<p>from him- the most solemn assurance that he entertained " no
</p>
<p>design to intermeddle with or disturb the tranquillity of the
</p>
<p>United States, nor its territories, nor any part of them. Ht
</p>
<p>had neither issued, nor signed, nor promised a commission tc

<p>any other person for him, by his authority or knowledge. His
</p>
<p>views had been explained to several distinguished members of
</p>
<p>the Administration, were well understood and approved by the
</p>
<p>Government. They were such as every man of honor, and
</p>
<p>every good citizen must approve."
</p>
<p>[The same and even stronger assurances were given to Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Harrison under date of Nov. 27th. General Jackson,
</p>
<p>alarmed at the attitude of affairs, had to be appeased, and
</p>
<p>Burr also reassured him in the most unequivocal manner.]
</p>
<p>It is not strange that, after such avowals, the people should
</p>
<p>deem the adventurer a persecuted man. Daviess, for a few
</p>
<p>weeks, carried upon his shoulders a load of obloquy and defa-
</p>
<p>mation which no other man in the West could sustain. He

<p>regarded by the masses as one of the chief founders of the
</p>
<p>democratic party, the District Attorney could hope for nothing
</p>
<p>less lenient than a coat of tar and feathers. But, what man in
</p>
<p>Kentucky dared to lay violent hands on Jo Daviess !

</p>
<p>still being absent. When this latter day came Floyd was
</p>
<p>present, but John Adair (General Adair, one of Burr's confi-
</p>
<p>dants) was absent, and Daviess was forced to ask for a further
</p>
<p>postponement  the Grand Jury to remain impanneled. This
</p>
<p>Clay resisted. Collins, in his "History of Kentucky" says:
</p>
<p>" Burr, upon the present occasion, remained silent, and entire-
</p>
<p>ly unmoved by anything that occurred. A most animated and
</p>
<p>impassioned debate sprung up, intermingled with sharp and
</p>
<p>flashing personalities, between Clay and Daviess. Never did
</p>
<p>two more illustrious orators encounter each other in debate.
</p>
<p>The enormous mass which crowded to suffocation the floor, the
</p>
<p>galleries, the windows, the platform of the judge, remained
</p>
<p>still and breathless for hours, while these renowned and im-
</p>
<p>mortal champions, stimulated by mutual rivalry, and each
</p>
<p>glowing in the ardent conviction of right, encountered each
</p>
<p>other in splendid intellectual combat. Clay had the sympa-
</p>
<p>thies of the audience on his side, and was the leader of the
</p>
<p>popular party in Kentucky. Daviess was a Federalist, and
</p>
<p>was regarded as persecuting an innocent and unfortunate man
</p>
<p>from motives of political hate. ' But he was buoyed up by the
</p>
<p>full conviction of Burr's guilt, and the delusion of the people
</p>
<p>on the subject; and the very infatuation which he beheld
</p>
<p>around him, and the smiling serenity of the traitor who sat
</p>
<p>before him, stirred his gi'eat spirit to 'one of his most brilliant
</p>
<p>efforts. All,, however, was in vain. Judge Innis refused to
</p>
<p>retain the grand jury, unless some business was brought before
</p>
<p>them ; and Daviess, in order to gain time, sent up to them an
</p>
<p>indictment against John Adair, which was pronounced by the
</p>
<p>jury 'not a true bill.' The hour being late, Daviess then
</p>
<p>moved for an attachment to compel the presence of Adair,
</p>
<p>which was resisted by Burr's counsel, and refused by the court,
</p>
<p>on the ground that Adair was not in contempt till the day
</p>
<p>had expired. On the motion of Daviess, the court then ad-

</p>
<p>journed to the following day."
</p>
<p>On the following day Daviess demanded permission to at-
</p>
<p>tend the grand jury in their room for the purpose of examin-
</p>
<p>ing witnesses  a claim resisted by Clay as unprecedented, and
</p>
<p>denied by Judge Innis. The grand jury retired, examined
</p>
<p>burr's release. 297
</p>
<p>sucli witnesses as were sent up to them, and, on the 5th of
</p>
<p>December, returned " not a true bill." This return was ac-
</p>
<p>companied by a written declaration signed by every juryman "
</p>
<p>in which, in view of all the evidence placed before them, they
</p>
<p>exonerated Burr from any design inimical to the peace or well
</p>
<p>being of the country.
</p>
<p>This acquittal was received with extraordinary demonstra-
</p>
<p>tions of satisfaction. Collins says : " The acquittal of Burr
</p>
<p>was celebrated at Frankfort by a brilliant ball, numerously at-
</p>
<p>tended ; which was followed by another ball given in honor of
</p>
<p>the baffled attorney, by those friends who believed the charge
</p>
<p>to be just, and that truth, for the time, had been baffled by
</p>
<p>boldness, eloquence and delusion. At one of these parties the
</p>
<p>editor of the Western World^ who had boldly sounded the
</p>
<p>alarm, was violently attacked, with a view of driving him from
</p>
<p>the ball-room, and was rescued with difficulty."
</p>
<p>Thus freed from legal restraint, the adventurer hastened to
</p>
<p>perfect his arrangements for a descent of the river. He pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded, in company with General Adair, to Nashville, where
</p>
<p>he became the recipient of new honors. The section of the
</p>
<p>expedition to move from Nashville down the Cumberland he
</p>
<p>was to lead in person. At the mouth of the Cumberland he
</p>
<p>would be joined by Blennerhessett's, Floyd's and Tyler's sec-
</p>
<p>tions, when the whole would proceed on the Southern voyage.
</p>
<p>This was the plan.
</p>
<p>But, delays had wrought the evils apprehended, Jefferson's
</p>
<p>messenger reached Marietta about Nov. 15th, and, by prac-
</p>
<p>tising a little art, soon learned from the enthusiastic Blenner-
</p>
<p>hassett enough to make action necessary. He proceeded
</p>
<p>qiiickly to Chillicothe, the State capital, where the Legislature
</p>
<p>was in session. An act was passed, without delay, empower-
</p>
<p>ing the Governor to call out the militia, to seize the boats
</p>
<p>building on the Muskingum, and to take all necessary steps to

</p>
<p>break up the expedition. The boats accordingly were seized
</p>
<p>early in December. The President's proclamation soon fol-
</p>
<p>lowed, to add zest to the pursuit of the now outlawed cru-
</p>
<p>saders. A section of the expedition, fitting out at Beaver,
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, hastened its departure. Four boats, under com-
</p>
<p>98 CONSPIRACY OF BURR.
</p>
<p>mand of Colonel Tyler, reached Blennerhassett's island Dec.
</p>
<p>lOth. Finding that, not only were his own boats seized, but
</p>
<p>that the militia were to move down to seize those of Colonel
</p>
<p>Tyler, Blennerhassett hastily embarked, on the night of Dec.
</p>
<p>13th, in Tyler's batteaux, with such of the men as chose to
</p>
<p>adhere to the enterprise. On the 14th a posse of militia with
</p>
<p>three justices of the peace visited the island, only to find there
</p>
<p>a company of gay young fellows just arrived from New York
</p>
<p>city. These, the justices " tried," but soon released from want
</p>
<p>of any evidence of their participation in Burr's enterprise. Mrs.
</p>
<p>Blennerhassett, with her children, having failed to obtain fi-om
</p>
<p>the Marietta authorities her own specially furnished boat,
</p>
<p>dropped down to the island during the day (14th) and was
</p>
<p>rather roughly treated by the "citizen soldiery," who, having
</p>
<p>access to the wine cellar, soon became uproarous in their con-
</p>
<p>duct. The New Yorkers offering the still resolute woman
</p>
<p>passage in their boat, she accepted the substitute for her own
</p>
<p>barge of state and fled down stream to join her husband. That
</p>
<p>beautiful house was quickly reduced to a ruin. Its grounds,
</p>
<p>its costly furniture, its expensive works of art  all were a
</p>
<p>wreck, ere a week had passed.
</p>
<p>Hastening from Chillicothe, Graham, the Government's agent,
</p>
<p>proceeded to Frankfort, Kentucky, to find the Legislature in
</p>
<p>session and a state of high excitement prevailing. Jo Daviess
</p>
<p>had succeeded in obtaining a committee of investigation upon
</p>
<p>charges of corruption and Spanish pensions preferred against
</p>
<p>Sebastian, Judge Innis, George Nicholas, [the same who as-
</p>
<p>sumed the paternity of Jefl'erson's resolutions of '98] then de-
</p>
<p>ceased, and others. The disclosures which followed were
</p>
<p>startling enough ; yet, strange as it may appear, the greatest
</p>
<p>sinner of all the "pensioners," General Wilkinson, escaped
</p>
<p>exposure. Graham arrived at the moment of these disclosures,
</p>
<p>and readily succeeded in securing the passage of an order for

</p>
<p>the arrest of all inculpated in Burr's enterprise. A few seiz-
</p>
<p>ures only were made. Such a marvellous change had a few
</p>
<p>days made that, out of the great multitudes of those who had
</p>
<p>applauded and sustained the ex- Vice President, not a beggarly
</p>
<p>FLOATING DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI. 299
</p>
<p>dozen could be found who did not now denounce him ! Jo
</p>
<p>Daviess' hour of triumph indeed had come.
</p>
<p>Burr, at Nashville, heard of Graham's mission, and precipi-
</p>
<p>tately fled, with but two boats, down the Cumberiand, on the
</p>
<p>night preceding the arrival of orders for his arrest. General
</p>
<p>Adair at the same time started overiand to New Orieans.
</p>
<p>Eeaching (Dec. 24th) the mouth of the Cumberiand, the fugi-
</p>
<p>tive found Blennerhasset, Floyd and Tyler already there, await-
</p>
<p>ing his coming. Some delay was made in that then wild
</p>
<p>and distant spot, awaiting the arrival of other boats which it
</p>
<p>was supposed would escape from Cincinnati and other points.
</p>
<p>But, the zeal of Burr's late friend, United States Senator Smith,
</p>
<p>and the activity of the Ohio and Kentucky authorities, pre-
</p>
<p>vented the embarkation of recruits. No reenforcements, there-
</p>
<p>fore, were forthcoming. Burr did not despair. He at once
</p>
<p>commenced an intrigue to secure the garrison of Fort Massac,
</p>
<p>(located on the Ohio, neariy opposite the Cumberiand mouth).
</p>
<p>A sergeant only was obtained under the false plea that he was
</p>
<p>required for a special mission to St. Louis.
</p>
<p>A count of heads showed the " expeditionary force" to con-
</p>
<p>sist of sixty men and ten boats. With this array the monarch
</p>
<p>of undefined realms floated away down stream, on the route to
</p>
<p>New Orleans and Richmond. Not one of the men knew
</p>
<p>whither they were bound. They were a jolly set, who loved
</p>
<p>nothing so much as whiskey and a fiddle two commodities
</p>
<p>with which they were well supplied. The silences of the great
</p>
<p>Father of waters were strangely disturbed by the merry-mak-
</p>
<p>ing of that band of brothers.
</p>
<p>January 3d, 1807, tlie flotilla brought up at the Chicksaw
</p>
<p>Bluffs (Memphis) a military post, having a small garrison.
</p>
<p>Burr sought to enlist the services of its commanding officer
</p>
<p>and neariy succeeded ; but, the officer, after consultation with
</p>
<p>friends, refused his co-operation and Burr proceeded on his

<p>way without a single recruit from that station. January 10th
</p>
<p>he reached the settlement of Bayou Pierre, thirty miles above
</p>
<p>Natchez, and there from a newspaper first learned, to his great
</p>
<p>amazement and indignation, that Wilkinson had proven false
</p>
<p>and was even then preparing New Orleans to resist the grand
</p>
<p>300 CONSPIRACY OP BURR.
</p>
<p>climax of horrors which his eager fancy had painted as coming
</p>
<p>in the train of Aaron Burr's advent. The country was all
</p>
<p>ablaze with excitement. The Governor of Mississippi already
</p>
<p>had out a proclamation denouncing the expedition and calling
</p>
<p>upon all to assist in its suppression. In the hurried glance
</p>
<p>over that newspaper the Conspirator read his doom : his Mex-
</p>
<p>ican castle was gone and a prison stared him in the face.
</p>
<p>We may now recur to Wilkinson's operations. The two
</p>
<p>messengers dispatched by Burr, after nine weeks' incessant
</p>
<p>traveling, reached the mouth of the Ked river to learn that
</p>
<p>Wilkinson was at Nachitoches. Ogden went on down to New
</p>
<p>Orleans, while Swartwout, with the important letter in cypher,
</p>
<p>pushed on for the United States' camp, arriving there October
</p>
<p>8th. After some little delay the precious package was placed
</p>
<p>by the bearer in Wilkinson's hands. The letter, as interpreted
</p>
<p>by the General-in-chief, and as given in evidence, read :
</p>
<p>" Yours, post-marked 13th of May, is received. I, Aaron Burr, have
</p>
<p>obtained funds, and have actually commenced the enterprise. Detach-
</p>
<p>ments from different points, and under different pretenses, will rendez-
</p>
<p>vous on the Ohio, 1st November  everything internal and external, fa-
</p>
<p>vors views ; protection of England is secured. T is going to Ja-
</p>
<p>maica to arrange with the admiral on that station ; it will meet on the
</p>
<p>Mississippi. , England, , navy of the United States are ready
</p>
<p>to ioin, and final orders are given to my friends and followers : it will
</p>
<p>be a host of choice spirits. Wilkinson shall be second to Burr only,
</p>
<p>Wilkinson shall dictate the rank and jiromotion of his officers. Burr
</p>
<p>will proceed westward, 1st August, never more to return ; with him
</p>
<p>goes his daughter ; the husband will follow in October, with a corps of
</p>
<p>worthies.
</p>
<p>" Send forth an intelligent and confidential friend with whom Burr
</p>
<p>may confer ; he shall return immediately with further interesting de-
</p>
<p>tails ; this is essential to concert and harmony of movement. Send a
</p>
<p>list of all persons known to Wilkmson, west of the mountains, who may

</p>
<p>send me four or five commissions of your officers, which you can bor-
</p>
<p>row under any jiretense you please; they shall be returned faithfully.
</p>
<p>Already are orders to the contractors given to forward six months' pro-
</p>
<p>visions to points Wilkinson may name : this shall not be used until the
</p>
<p>last moment, and then under proper injunctions. The project is brought

</p>
<p>and honor, with the honor and fortunes of hundreds of the bcist blood
</p>
<p>of our country.
</p>
<p>" Burr's phin of operation is, to move down rapidly from the Falls
</p>
<p>on the 15th of September, with the first 500 or 1,000 men in light boats,
</p>
<p>now constrnctiug for that purpose, to be at Natchez between the 5th
</p>
<p>and 15th of December; there to meet Wilkinson ; there to determine
</p>
<p>whether it will be expedient in the first instance to seize on or pasa
</p>
<p>by Baton Rouge. On receipt of this send an answer. Draw on Burr
</p>
<p>for all expenses, etc. The people of the country to which we are
</p>
<p>going, are prepared to receive us. Their agents, now with Burr, say,
</p>
<p>that if we will protect their religion, and will not subject them to a
</p>
<p>foreign power, that in three weeks all will be settled. The gods in-
</p>
<p>vite to glory and fortune ; it remains to be seen whether we deserve
</p>
<p>the boon. The bearer of this goes express to you ; he will hand a for-
</p>
<p>mal letter of introduction to you from Burr. He is a man of inviolable
</p>
<p>honor and perfect discretion; formed to execute rather than to project;
</p>
<p>capable of relating facts with fidelity, and incapable of relating them
</p>
<p>otherwise. He is thoroughly informed of the plans and intentions of
</p>
<p>Burr, and will disclose to you as far as you inquii'e and no further. He
</p>
<p>has imbibed a reverence for your character, and may be embarrassed in
</p>
<p>your presence. Put him at ease, and he will satisfy you."
</p>
<p>Accompanying this was a brief but very significant note
</p>
<p>from ex-Senator Dayton. It ran :
</p>
<p>" Dear Sir : It is now well ascertained that you are to be displaced in
</p>
<p>next session. Jefterson will affect to yield reluctantly to the public sen-
</p>
<p>timent, but yield he will. Prepare yourself, therefore, for it. You know
</p>
<p>the rest. You are not a man to despair, or even despond, esjjecially
</p>
<p>when such prospects offer in another quarter. Are you ready ? Are
</p>
<p>your numerous associates ready ? Wealtli and glory, Louisiana and
</p>
<p>Mexico ! I sliall have time to receive a letter from you before I set out
</p>
<p>for Ohio. Ohio. Address one to me here, and another in Cincinnati.
</p>
<p>Receive and treat my nephew affectionately as you would receive your
</p>
<p>friend Dayton."

</p>
<p>Here, then, were the results of his connection with Burr.
</p>
<p>What should be done ? It was stated on evidence that the
</p>
<p>letter was decyphered during the night, and that, early the
</p>
<p>next morning, the General announced to Colonel Gushing its
</p>
<p>important contents, at the same time declaring his purpose to
</p>
<p>oppose Burr's enterprise with every means in his power. But,
</p>
<p>we can well conceive that the conscience of the man was not
</p>
<p>put to any sudden test, although Burr's rather extraordinarily
</p>
<p>bold programme may have startled the soldier for a moment
</p>
<p>302 CONSPIRACY OF BURR.
</p>
<p>The General doubtless had determined -upon his course
</p>
<p>weeks prior to Swartwout's appearance  had resolved to sup-
</p>
<p>press his own conspiracy and thus obtain the thanks of his
</p>
<p>countrymen ! That was his usual way of advancement. Par-
</p>
<p>ton says :
</p>
<p>'' At the last moment, then, Wilkinson shrank from the work expect-
</p>
<p>ed of him. The probability is strong that he always meant to do so.
</p>
<p>That he was a weak, vain, false, greedy man, is likely enough. That
</p>
<p>carried away by the magic of Burr's resistless prese7^ce, and hojjing
</p>
<p>the scheme would never involve hitn in its folds, he suggested, en-
</p>
<p>couraged and aided it, is very probable. That he had given Burr to
</p>
<p>understand, in some vague way, that he would strike a blow which
</p>
<p>would begin a war, whenever it should be needed, is also probable.
</p>
<p>That he chose the part he did choose from a calculation of advan-
</p>
<p>tages to himself, from motives mean and mercenary, rests upon evi-
</p>
<p>dence that convinces. Nevertheless, the fact remains, that he did not
</p>
<p>" strike the blow;" he did 7wt involve two nations in war; he did not
</p>
<p>shajje his course according to the wishes of Aaron Burr, instead of the
</p>
<p>orders of Thomas Jefferson. If he was a traitor, he was a traitor to his
</p>
<p>confederates, not to his country, his commission, his flag. True, the
</p>
<p>country, particularly the Western States, desired war, and would have
</p>
<p>applauded him for beginning it. But to a soldier, his country sjieaks
</p>
<p>only through the commands of its chief."
</p>
<p>The author might have paused at his words " evidence that
</p>
<p>convinces." We conceive it as admitting of no denial, that
</p>
<p>the General chose his part from motives base enough to relieve
</p>
<p>his memory from the charge of once having acted the patriot's
</p>
<p>part from a patriot's sense of duty.
</p>
<p>In spite, however, of the General's announced purpose, he
</p>
<p>did not act as promptly as his testimony would indicate. He
</p>
<p>kept Swartwout in camp for ten days, when the messenger was
</p>
<p>permitted to go down stream to New Orleans, fully believing
</p>
<p>in the General's good faith to Burr. After Swartwout had

</p>
<p>been gone three days the General resolved to dispatch informa-
</p>
<p>tion to Jefferson. Parton states :
</p>
<p>" The messenger left camp on the 21st of October, and delivered his
</p>
<p>dispatches to the President on the 35th of November. On the 27th, Jef-
</p>
<p>ferson issued his proclamation, and sent it flying through the States,
</p>
<p>paralyzing the enterprise as it flew, and filling the country with con-
</p>
<p>sternation. It is noticeable, that neither in Wilkinson's disj^atches,
</p>
<p>nor in Jefferson's proclamation, was the name of Burr mentioned.
</p>
<p>JACKSON SOUNDS AN ALARM. 803
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, indeed, expressly and falsely wrote that he did not know
</p>
<p>who the prime mover of the conspiracy was. He admitted, after-
</p>
<p>ward, that he wrote a letter to Burr after the receipt of the cypher,
</p>
<p>but, upon reflection, pursued the letter and destroyed it. The Pres-
</p>
<p>ident's proclamation merely announced that unlawful enterprises were
</p>
<p>on foot in the Western States ; warned all persons ' to withdraw
</p>
<p>themselves from the same without delay,' 'as they will answer the
</p>
<p>contrary at their peril, and incur prosecution with all the rigors of the
</p>
<p>law ;' and commanded all officers, civil and military, to use their im-
</p>
<p>mediate and utmost exertions to bring the offending persons to condign
</p>
<p>punishment."
</p>
<p>The duplicity of the man stands forth here as in almost
</p>
<p>every decisive act of his life : he wrote to Burr after he had
</p>
<p>resolved upon his arrest, but recalled the messenger, and there-
</p>
<p>upon debated several precious days further, took counsel of his
</p>
<p>wits and of Swartwout, then dismissed the bearer of the cypher,
</p>
<p>and, after three days' further reasoning with himself, dispatch-
</p>
<p>ed a messenger to the President. But, even then he practiced
</p>
<p>deceit, stating that he did not know who was the prime mover
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy ! He did not know himself
</p>
<p>After the departure of his dispatches to Washington, Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson moved his army from Nachitoches to the Sabine river,
</p>
<p>where the Spaniards still remained in menacing force. He soon
</p>
<p>arranged terms of truce, much to the disgust of his men, who
</p>
<p>were eager to "wipe out" the Dons; and then departed for
</p>
<p>New Orleans, ordering Colonel Gushing to follow with the
</p>
<p>bulk of the army. On the very day that his disjjatclies reach-
</p>
<p>ed the Capital the General-in-Chief dropped into New Orleans,
</p>
<p>to find the city in a state of mysterious excitement. The sturdy
</p>
<p>patriot, Andrew Jackson, had written to Claiborne, Governor
</p>
<p>of " Orleans territory," under date of Nov. 12th, in a manner
</p>
<p>to excite alarm. Jackson said, among other things :
</p>
<p>"Put your town (New Orleans) in a state of defense, organize your

</p>
<p>ral, and beware of an attack as well from your own country as from
</p>
<p>Spain. I fear there is something rotten in the State of Denmark. * *

</p>
<p>Claiborne at once sought for explanations of Wilkinson and
</p>
<p>was admitted to the secret. It was resolved to call the citi-
</p>
<p>zens together to make known to them the threatened danger.
</p>
<p>This was done. Wilkinson addressed them, giving information
</p>
<p>of the cypher letter, and filling out the details with alarming
</p>
<p>amplification of impending dangers. The multitude was tho-
</p>
<p>roughly aroused and readily answered the call to arms. Vol-
</p>
<p>unteers enrolled to man the old fortifications and to assist in
</p>
<p>erecting new stockades at various endangered points. A strong
</p>
<p>guard was dispatched to occupy the river banks above the city,
</p>
<p>there to overhaul every craft floating down stream. The Leg-
</p>
<p>islature of Orleans territory was called together in special ses-
</p>
<p>sion to consider a communication from Wilkinson, which con-
</p>
<p>tained a translation of the cypher letter. [It was this commu-
</p>
<p>nication which Burr read at Bayou Pierre  his first intimation
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson's defection.] The fears grew ; Wilkinson was
</p>
<p>in his element  was the leading spirit of the storm. He be-
</p>
<p>came convinced that the civil law was impotent to cope with
</p>
<p>the dangers menacing, and resolved to "take the responsibili-
</p>
<p>ty" of declaring martial law. Swartwout, Ogden, Bollman
</p>
<p>and Adair were forcibly seized, and, in spite of the efforts of
</p>
<p>their still staunch friends, were forced on board a vessel and
</p>
<p>sent to Baltimore  prisoners with not a single proven charge
</p>
<p>against them. Writs of habeas corpus were scorned, and the
</p>
<p>judge who issued them, (Workman,) was placed under arrest
</p>
<p>as a particeps criminis^ sent to the common guard house and
</p>
<p>kept imprisoned until released by the efforts of the U. S. Dis-
</p>
<p>trict Judge. [Swartwout and Bollman were examined, when
</p>
<p>they reached Washington, and were at once released  no evi-
</p>
<p>dence of any kind being given to sustain the arrest] A reign
</p>
<p>of terror prevailed. Citizens were arrested and placed under

<p>surveillance. Houses were visited, papers overhauled, a pass-

<p>campment on the east side of the Mississippi just above Bayou
</p>
<p>Pierre, and beholding there less than one hundred men, a
</p>
<p>rollicing, half armed, uninformed crew, it is difficult to sup-
</p>
<p>press a laugh at the discrepancy between the imaginary and the
</p>
<p>real danger.
</p>
<p>Week after week passed at New Orleans, and yet no signs
</p>
<p>of the " invaders"  no appearance of an English fleet in the
</p>
<p>offing  no uprising of the people in favor of the Mexican
</p>
<p>scheme ! The General began to grow visibly uneasy at the
</p>
<p>absence of an enemy. He began to fear for his reputation as
</p>
<p>a courageous and discreet officer. It was growing ridiculously
</p>
<p>awkward  that standing challenge for a combat which none
</p>
<p>would accept. So the Orleans papers thought, and, ere long,
</p>
<p>so they dared to speak. The grand jury presented his meas-
</p>
<p>ures as illegal and unconstitutional ; the press arraigned him
</p>
<p>as an incompetent officer and a dangerous man ; the people
</p>
<p>denounced his as a second edition of Falstaff  whom he, indeed,
</p>
<p>represented in so many of his mental and physical characteris-
</p>
<p>tics as to excite a regret that the General had not chosen the
</p>
<p>dramatic boards for his ' field of operations.'
</p>
<p>But, the General was not without his grain of comfort. The
</p>
<p>issue^by Jefferson of the proclamation of Nov. 27th ; his emis-
</p>
<p>sion of orders of warning and of arrest to the Governors ; his
</p>
<p>message of Dec. 2d, to be followed by the special message of
</p>
<p>Jan. 22d [see Appendix for message in full] ; his several ap-
</p>
<p>probatory letters to his friend, all served to console the agent
</p>
<p>by proving that the Administration was equally excited with
</p>
<p>himself Then the deposition of Eaton was given publicity,
</p>
<p>to add immensely to the public excitement, and Burr became,
</p>
<p>for the moment, a monster of huge proportions ; his past his-
</p>
<p>tory was revived and painted in colors dismal enough for a
</p>
<p>Mohammedan ; his victims in the social circle were counted
</p>
<p>by the dozen and his natural children by the scores ; his du-

<p>plicity, subtelty, power of persuasion were freely canvassed
</p>
<p>even by his old political coadj utors : he became, for the day,
</p>
<p>the sum of all villainies. Such was the change which accom-

<p>panied the man's fortunes. In July he was His Excellency,

<p>306 CONSPIRACY OF BURR.
</p>
<p>Burr, after reading in the New Orleans journal, Wilkinson's
</p>
<p>communication to the called session of the Legislature, and
</p>
<p>also the proclamations for his arrest, expressed no perturbation,
</p>
<p>although his surprise must have been complete. He conversed
</p>
<p>freely with the planter, at whose residence he obtained the
</p>
<p>news, affirming his innocence of designs against the Union, and
</p>
<p>so far won upon the planter's confidence as to secure a warm
</p>
<p>friend. After a brief conference it was decided to move the
</p>
<p>boats and men over the river, thus to place them and himself
</p>
<p>beyond the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Executive. This was
</p>
<p>done, and a little encampment made at a point about thirty
</p>
<p>miles above Natchez. From thence he addressed a letter to
</p>
<p>the public expressive of surprise at the excitement prevailing,
</p>
<p>denying that his expedition had any other than a legitimate
</p>
<p>object, and requesting that his " fellow citizens should visit his
</p>
<p>camp and boats, and by observation learn the folly of their ap-
</p>
<p>prehensions" ; but, the Governor answered the invitation by
</p>
<p>calling out the militia of Natchez and vicinity to arrest the
</p>
<p>fugitives under the authority of the President's proclamation
</p>
<p>and special instructions. These troops gathered without delay
</p>
<p>at Cole's creek, a few miles below Bayou Pierre, opposite to
</p>
<p>which was Burr's camp. Prior to any action, however, an ar-
</p>
<p>rangement was made with Poindexter, Attorney-General of
</p>
<p>Mississippi Territory, for Burr to meet Governor Mead at
</p>
<p>Cole's creek. This audience took place Jan. 16th, when Burr
</p>
<p>was informed that, in spite of his location on the Louisiana
</p>
<p>side, the militia would move upon his camp at once. He there-
</p>
<p>fore surrendered himself a prisoner, and was conducted for a
</p>
<p>hearing to the town of Washington, the seat of territorial gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, ten miles east of Natchez. Poindexter was of opinion
</p>
<p>that the prisoner, having committed no offense in Mississippi
</p>
<p>Territory, could not be indicted ; he also held " that the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Territorial Court, being a court of appeals only, could

</p>
<p>not entertain original jurisdiction of the matter, and that it
</p>
<p>would be best to send Burr to the seat of the National Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, where the Supreme Court of the United States was
</p>
<p>in session, by which the proper locality for the trial of Burr
</p>
<p>might be determined. But Kodney, the judge before whom
</p>
<p>EXTRAOKDINAR Y VERDICT. 307
</p>
<p>Burr was brought, thinking differently, directed a grand jury
</p>
<p>to be summoned to attend the approaching term of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Territorial Court, and Burr to give recognizances to appear
</p>
<p>from day to day. He was not without sympathizers among
</p>
<p>the neighboring planters, and found no difficulty in obtaining
</p>
<p>sureties. When the court met, Feb. 5th, Poindexter took the
</p>
<p>same ground he did before; but, as the two judges were di-
</p>
<p>vided in opinion, his motion was overruled." The grand jury
</p>
<p>therefore took the case into consideration, and, after a compa-
</p>
<p>ritively brief sitting, returned the following extraordinary ver-
</p>
<p>dict :
</p>
<p>" The grand jury of the Mississippi Territory, on a due investigation
</p>
<p>of the evidence brought before them, are of opinion that Aaron Burr has
</p>
<p>not been guilty of any crime or misdemeanor against the laws of the
</p>
<p>United States, or of this Territory ; or given any just cause of alarm or
</p>
<p>inquietude to the good people of the same.
</p>
<p>" The grand jurors present, as a grievance, the late military expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, unnecessarily, as they conceive, fitted out against the j)erson and
</p>
<p>property of the said Aaron Burr, when no resistance has been made
</p>
<p>to the civil authorities,
</p>
<p>"The grand jurors also present, as a grievance, destructive of person-
</p>
<p>al liberty, the late military arrests, made without warrant, and, as they
</p>
<p>conceive, without other lawful authority; and they do sincerely regret
</p>
<p>that so much cause has been given to the enemies of our glorious Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, to rejoice at such measures being adopted, in a neighboring
</p>
<p>Territory, as, if sanctioned by the Executive of our country, must sap
</p>
<p>the vitals of our political existence, and crumble this glorious fabric in
</p>
<p>the dust."
</p>
<p>This was indeed a "turning] of the tables." Instead of in-
</p>
<p>dicting the prisoner his prosecutors were arraigned ! Poindex-
</p>
<p>ter declared the return both a disgrace and an outrage ; the
</p>
<p>Judge pronounced it impertinent and useless ; but their indig-
</p>
<p>nation did not drive the grand jury into any change of senti-

<p>ment. Burr demanded his legal release, that his recognizance
</p>
<p>might be no longer binding ; but, it was resolved to hold him
</p>
<p>for further proceedings, or, as Burr feared, to hand him over
</p>
<p>to Wilkinson. His release was refused by the bench and
</p>
<p>attorney. He determined to fly : fall into Wilkinson's hands
</p>
<p>he would not. Visiting his camp he informed the men of his
</p>
<p>danger, advising them to sell the boats, provisions, &c., and to

<p>808 CONSFIRACY OF BURR.
</p>
<p>go their own way  offering all wlio chose to go grants of soil
</p>
<p>on the Wachita purchase. He then recrossed the river ; was
</p>
<p>carefully equipped by his friends (he found plenty of them
</p>
<p>among the planters), and, provided with a good guide, struck
</p>
<p>off across the wilderness for the weary journey to the Atlantic
</p>
<p>3oast, or to Pensacola, as circumstances should determine.
</p>
<p>The Court on assembling next morning called the prisoner,
</p>
<p>and, upon his non-appearance, declared his recognizance for-
</p>
<p>feited. A reward of two thousand dollars was offered for his
</p>
<p>arrest. Numbers of vagabonds were soon roaming the coun-
</p>
<p>try in the search, though none secured the coveted prize. A
</p>
<p>negro boy who had been known to act as Burr's servant ap-
</p>
<p>peared on the shore opposite the flotilla, wearing his master's
</p>
<p>overcoat. He was seized, when, upon search, a note was dis-
</p>
<p>covered stitched to the lining of the cape addressed to " C. T."
</p>
<p>and"D. F." It read:
</p>
<p>" If you are yet together, keep so, and I will join you to-morrow night.
</p>
<p>In the mean while, put all your arms in perfect order. Ask no ques-
</p>
<p>tions of the bearer, but tell him all you may think I wish to know. He
</p>
<p>does not know that this is from me, nor where I am."
</p>
<p>This doubtless was designed by Burr as a blind. Colonel
</p>
<p>Comfort Tyler, and Davis Floyd, ex-member of the Indiana
</p>
<p>Legislature, still were in camp, in charge of their respective
</p>
<p>gections. Guards were set at once by the Governor to watch
</p>
<p>for the re-appearance of the chief, but he was even then well
</p>
<p>on his way to the East, accompanied by a trusty guide. C. F.
</p>
<p>and D. T. and Blennerhassett were placed under arrest ; but,
</p>
<p>nothing transpiring, they soon were released. The expedition
</p>
<p>at once dissolved. The Irishman, accompanied by his now
</p>
<p>thoroughly disheartened if not disgusted wife, retained enough
</p>
<p>means to make his way back to the island. He started for
</p>
<p>the North only to be arrested in Kentucky, by orders from
</p>
<p>Washington, and was borne to Eichmond to be tried for trea-

</p>
<p>lested, to their homes, though a few tarried to supply that be-

<p>The story of Burr's arrest in the backwoods of Alabama
</p>
<p>forms, in his biographer's (Parton) version, a very romantic
</p>
<p>BURR S ARREST IN ALABAMA. 809
</p>
<p>episode. Stripping it of embellislimeiit it may be told as fol-
</p>
<p>lows : One cold 'evening in February (the 18th) two young
</p>
<p>lawyers were playing at backgammon in a cabin, in Wakefield,
</p>
<p>the county seat of Washington county, Alabama. Their game
</p>
<p>was disturbed by the arrival, before the door, of two travellers,
</p>
<p>one of whom made inquiry for the residence of Colonel Hinson,
</p>
<p>a leading man of that vicinity. One of the lawyers. Colonel
</p>
<p>Nicholas Perkins, passed out to direct the strangers, and ob-
</p>
<p>served by the glare of the bright fire that the inquirer, though
</p>
<p>outwardly dressed in the rough garb of a common planter, was
</p>
<p>a person of mark. His dazzling eye, the silvery ring of his
</p>
<p>voice and correct pronunciation of his words, the delicately
</p>
<p>booted foot projecting from the homespun pantaloons, the air
</p>
<p>of superiority  all indicated the owner to be no common man.
</p>
<p>Perkins gave the required information and entered the cabin
</p>
<p>again to pronounce the words " Aaron Burr ! " to his incredu-
</p>
<p>lous companion. A description of the man, appended to the
</p>
<p>proclamation and reward for his arrest, left no doubt of his
</p>
<p>identity. Perkins proceeded to arouse the Sheriff. These two
</p>
<p>then made their way to the house of Colonel Hinson, in pur-
</p>
<p>suit of Burr and his guide. Once there Perkins was left in
</p>
<p>the woods while the Sheriff entered the house. The two tra-
</p>
<p>vellers were warming in the kitchen by a bright fire. While
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hinson proceeded to get supper, the Sheriff entered into
</p>
<p>conversation with the suspected stranger. The officer was
</p>
<p>" fascinated," like all others who came in contact with the man ;
</p>
<p>he did not return, as promised, to Perkins. Not to be thwart-
</p>
<p>ed, however, the young lawyer started for Fort Stoddart, on
</p>
<p>the Tombigbee, twelve miles below, where he arrived at day-
</p>
<p>break. Lieutenant Gaines (afterward Major-General Edmund
</p>
<p>P. Gaines) then in command, with a file of dragoons, and ac-
</p>
<p>companied by Perkins, started in pursuit, directing their course
</p>
<p>to the Pensacola road. Turning up this road toward Wake-

</p>
<p>field they met Burr and his companion, only two miles from
</p>
<p>Hinson's house  the Sheriff having but just left the travellers,
</p>
<p>after directing them on their way. Gaines rode forward and
</p>
<p>accosted the stranger : " I presume I have the honor of address-
</p>
<p>ing Colonel Aaron Burr." " I am a traveller, sir ; and do not
</p>
<p>310 CONSPIRACY OF BURR.
</p>
<p>recognise your right to question me," was the reply, as the
</p>
<p>horseman moved on. Gaines pulled from his breast pocket
</p>
<p>the proclamation, and thrusting it before the fugitive's face ex-
</p>
<p>claimed : " I arrest you by authority of this proclamation, as
</p>
<p>a prisoner to the Federal Government ! " Burr attempted to
</p>
<p>intimidate his captor ; but the young officer was resolute, and
</p>
<p>firmly bade Burr accompany him to his quarters, where he
</p>
<p>would be treated with all the respect due the ex-Yice President
</p>
<p>of the United States. Seeing that resistance was useless the
</p>
<p>dethroned chief submitted with a good grace, and was escorted
</p>
<p>to the Fort (Feb. 19th). There he remained until March 5th,
</p>
<p>making complete captive of all, both male and female, in and
</p>
<p>around the Fort. Leading citizens visited him freely, and the
</p>
<p>ladies, generally, showered all manner of attentions upon him.
</p>
<p>His departure from the Fort, for the trip through the wilder-
</p>
<p>ness to the North, we are told, was a scene of affecting adieux.
</p>
<p>"The tears," says Parton, "of the ladies residing at the fort
</p>
<p>fell fast as Colonel Burr, escorted by a file of soldiers, went
</p>
<p>down to the shore and embarked on board the boat provided
</p>
<p>for the ascent of the Alabama. He had no enemies there. The
</p>
<p>men could have no ill-will to one whose offense had been a
</p>
<p>desire to terminate the hateful rule of the Spaniards ; and wo-
</p>
<p>men were always and everywhere his friends. As the boat,
</p>
<p>with its crew of soldiers, glided past the few houses on the
</p>
<p>river's bank, all the ladies, it is said, waved their handkerchiefs,
</p>
<p>except those who were obliged to put those weapons to a ten-
</p>
<p>derer use. One of the ladies of the Alabama named her infant
</p>
<p>Aaron Burr ; and he was not the only young gentleman in the
</p>
<p>South-west who bore through life a similar record of the events
</p>
<p>amid which he was born."
</p>
<p>Of that novel journey through the imsettled wilds a pleasing
</p>
<p>chapter might be written. The guard of nine trusty men was
</p>
<p>officered by Colonel Perkins, in person, who would not admit

</p>
<p>any man less resolute than himself to the important mission of
</p>
<p>delivering Burr safely to the authorities at Washington. Ex-
</p>
<p>treme caution was used to guard against any influence over
</p>
<p>the men, as well as to avoid all settlements where a rescue
</p>
<p>might be attempted. Only one effort was made bj Burr to
</p>
<p>BURR COMMITTED FOR TRIAL. 813
</p>
<p>secure his liberty, but it failed througb Perkins' resolute and
</p>
<p>rapid action. After Various adventures the party safely reach-
</p>
<p>ed Fredericksburg, in Virginia. An express from Washing-
</p>
<p>ton directed the prisoner to be taken to Eichmond, where he
</p>
<p>arrived March 26th, 1807.
</p>
<p>On Monday, March 30th, the preliminary examination took
</p>
<p>place, before Chief-Justice John Marshall, assisted by Judge
</p>
<p>Griffin, of the District Court. Burr made his own defense  at
</p>
<p>once ingenious and, apparently, ingenuous. A three days' hear-
</p>
<p>ing followed. Burr called to his aid Edmund Eandolph, al-
</p>
<p>ready referred to in these pages in connection with Genet's
</p>
<p>Conspiracy. The celebrated Luther Martin, of Maryland, was
</p>
<p>afterwards added to his splendid staff of counsel. The prose-
</p>
<p>cution though ordered by the U. S. Attorney General, Eodney,
</p>
<p>wab conducted by the District Attorney, George Hay, assisted
</p>
<p>by that man of many brilliant qualities, William Wirt, of Eich-
</p>
<p>mond. Lieutenant-Governor McEae afterwards was added to
</p>
<p>the prosecutor's staff. The preliminaries resulted in a de-
</p>
<p>cision to commit Burr for a misdemeanor, leaving to the grand
</p>
<p>jury the investigation of the charge of treason. Two leading
</p>
<p>citizens of Eichmond became his bondsmen in the sum of ten
</p>
<p>thousand dollars for his appearance at the ensuing session of
</p>

<p>writing a letter to U. S. Senator Giles, of Virginia. He refer-

<p>red with much bitterness to the trickery shown by the Judges,

<p>in hastening the trial so as to clear Burr ; he railed at the Fed-

</p>
<p>should shame a President, that, had Burr succeeded, even par-

</p>
<p>ists were leagued to secure Burr's acquittal  that the Chief
</p>
<p>Justice and the associate Circuit Judge were political partisans
</p>
<p>instead of grave and austere dispensers of law. The record is
</p>
<p>one which even Mr. Eandall finds it dif&cult to reconcile with
</p>
<p>fairness and wisdom. A more impartial and upright judge
</p>
<p>than John Marshall never graced a bench ; among Chief Jus-
</p>
<p>tices he stands a Washington of legal wisdom, prudence and
</p>
<p>truth ; and the writer who attempts to defend Mr. Jefferson for
</p>
<p>his aspersions of the Judge in the conduct of the Burr trial
</p>
<p>has an unenviable task before him. Burr, adverting to the
</p>
<p>animus of the prosecution as betrayed in the earliest stages of
</p>
<p>the trial, said :
</p>
<p>" The most indefatigable industry is used by the agents of govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and they have money at command without stint. If I were pos-
</p>
<p>sessed of the same means, I could not only foil the prosecutors, but ren-
</p>
<p>der them ridiculous and infamous. The democratic papers teem with
</p>
<p>abuse against me and my counsel, and even against the Chief Justice.
</p>
<p>Nothing is left undone or unsaid which can tend to prejudice the jiublic
</p>
<p>mind, and produce a conviction without evidence. The machinations
</p>
<p>of this description which were used against Moreau in France were
</p>
<p>treated in this country with indignation. They are practiced against
</p>
<p>me in a still more impudent degree, not only with im.punity, but with,
</p>
<p>applause ; and the authors and abettors suppose, with reason, that they
</p>
<p>are acquiring favor with the Administration."
</p>
<p>The trial came on as set. May 22d, Judges Marshall and
</p>
<p>Grif&n on the Bench. A grand jury was impanneled after
</p>
<p>much trouble, almost all men regarding as true the declaration
</p>
<p>made by Jefferson in his Message of Jan. 22d, that Burr's
</p>
<p>" guilt is placed beyond a question." The culprit of State as-
</p>
<p>sumed the conduct of his own case to find use for all of his
</p>
<p>astonishing resources. He was equal to the situation : his sa-
</p>
<p>gacity, accumen, tenacity of memory, power of combination
</p>
<p>and command of the technicalities of law excited the astonish-

</p>
<p>(who may be called the real prosecutor) and the Attorney
</p>
<p>General's assistants, the prisoner was a very Phoenix. On the

<p>challenged, as well as two or three equally oifensive as preju-

</p>
<p>dolpli, of Eoanoke was made foreman in spite of his declara-
</p>
<p>tion of a belief in Burr's guilt. This consumed the first day.
</p>
<p>The second day was taken up with minor matters : nothing
</p>
<p>of importance could be done until the arrival of "Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>who was looked for hourly. On the third day the prosecution
</p>
<p>made a motion to commit Burr for high treason instead of
</p>
<p>"misdemeanor." This elicited all the energies of the defense,
</p>
<p>and there followed three days of a memorable rhetorical war,
</p>
<p>in which the several combatants displayed their noblest abili-
</p>
<p>ties. The object, as stated, was to commit Burr to prison.
</p>
<p>Wirt assumed that, in view of Wilkinson's coming, the prose-
</p>
<p>cution had no faith in Burr's intention to confront his accuser
</p>
<p> they feared that he would forfeit his bail and escape. To
</p>
<p>this Eandolph replied with much severity. He said :
</p>
<p>'' Of James Wilkinson we are not afraid, in whatever shape he may
</p>
<p>be produced, in whatever form he may appear in this court. We are
</p>
<p>only afraid of those effects which desperation may produce in his mind.
</p>
<p>Desperation is a word of great fitness in his case. General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>we behold first acting as a conspirator to ensnare others, afterwards as
</p>
<p>a patriot to betray them from motives of patriotism. What must be
</p>
<p>the embarrassment of this man when the awful catastrophe arrives, that
</p>
<p>he must either substantiate his own innocence by the conviction of
</p>
<p>another, or be himself regarded as a traitor and conspirator in the event
</p>
<p>of the acquittal of the accused."
</p>
<p>Mr. Eandolph evidently did not know the General : he never
</p>
<p>was " embarrassed" at anything, let his failure be ever so glar-
</p>
<p>ing. The motion was finally disposed of by doubling the bail
</p>
<p>bond.
</p>
<p>Still, Wilkinson did not arrive. The counsel employed
</p>
<p>their time in plot and counterplot for the advantage of posi-
</p>
<p>tion. Burr in person had visited Washington to obtain the
</p>
<p>first dispatch of Wilkinson to the President, in which the
</p>
<p>General stated that he did not know who was the prime mover

</p>
<p>ment. It was moved by his counsel that the Court should is-
</p>
<p>sue a subpoena duces tecum to the President of the United States
</p>
<p>requiring him to furnish the said dispatch, and also copies of
</p>
<p>the orders issued to the army and navy during the late excite-

</p>
<p>poitits of law, for wliicli but few precedents existed, and U)
</p>
<p>govern which no rule prevailed. These points were argued
</p>
<p>both with bitterness and ability. The result was a decision
</p>
<p>that the subpoena might issue. Thereat the President became
</p>
<p>exceedingly excited, and not without some reason, considering
</p>
<p>the language used by Luther Martin, which was violent and
</p>
<p>indecorous. The President conceived the idea that Martin
</p>
<p>himself must be guilty of participation in the Conspirator's
</p>
<p>schemes, hence his zeal in Burr's behalf Indeed, Mr. Jeffer
</p>
<p>son was in possession of ^a letter from one Graybell, a citizen
</p>
<p>of Baltimore, who testified to Martin's complicity. The Prose-
</p>
<p>cuting Attorney therefore was written to (June 19th) : " Shall
</p>
<p>we move to commit Luther Martin as particeps criminis with
</p>
<p>Burr? Graybell will fix upon him misprison of treason at least.
</p>
<p>At any rate his evidence will put down this impudent and un-
</p>
<p>principled Federal bull dog, and add another proof that the
</p>
<p>most clamorous defenders of Burr are all his accomplices."
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this invitation of the Executive to trap the
</p>
<p>"bull dog," Mr. Hay did not adjudge the attempt prudent.
</p>
<p>The President was getting repaid for stating, in his " Notes on
</p>
<p>Virginia," that Martin was son-in-law to Michael Cresap, the
</p>
<p>murderer of Logan's family  a statement which Martin never
</p>
<p>forgave.
</p>
<p>The quotation above given is interesting as indicating the
</p>
<p>extremely excited state of the President's mind. After receiv-
</p>
<p>ing Judge Marshall's decision he wrote (June 30th) to Mr. Hay,
</p>
<p>forcibly deprecating that invasion of the Executive's dignity
</p>
<p>and rights, and threatened to use force, if necessary, to protect,
</p>
<p>as Mr. Randall terms it, " the constitutional inviolability of his
</p>
<p>office." Jefferson persisted in treating the decision as a design-
</p>
<p>ed personal indignity, particularly in view of his precedent in
</p>
<p>a somewhat parallel case. In the prosecutions growing out of
</p>

<p>Departments not to obey any summons of a court to be present
</p>
<p>and to testify on behalf of the defense. Here the case was
</p>
<p>aggravated by the invasion of the Executive's sanctity, making
</p>
<p>him amenable to a subpoena. But, the President forced the
</p>
<p>construction of the decisioa The Judge, in granting the mo-

<p>tion, expressly stated that tlie summons must not be used as a
</p>
<p>means of personal annoyance ; nor did he allude to any pro-
</p>
<p>cess to comjjel the President to supply the papers : all was left
</p>
<p>to his own sense of duty and dignity. The matter was, how-
</p>
<p>ever, virtually ended before the President's indignant pro-
</p>
<p>test of the 20th, for he had, prior to receiving the Judge's de-
</p>
<p>cision, ordered all the papers demanded to be given in. Why,
</p>
<p>then, his threat to use force in event of an invasion of hijs pre-
</p>
<p>rogatives ?
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, having arrived June 15th, appeared in court
</p>
<p>June 17th, after which the witnesses were sent up to the. grand
</p>
<p>jury in great numbers. The defense at once turned their
</p>
<p>whole strategy on an effort to vitiate Wilkinson's testimony,
</p>
<p>but the grand jury anticipated the attempted impeachment by
</p>
<p>returning, on the 24th, separate indictments against Aaron Burr
</p>
<p>and Herman Blennerhassett for " treason" and for " misde-
</p>
<p>meanors." This consigned the accused to prison. On the af-
</p>
<p>ternoon of that day Burr was given over to the city jailor for
</p>
<p>custody. Two days after, three of the prisoner's counsel made
</p>
<p>affidavit concerning the unhealthy and unfit state of his quar-
</p>
<p>ters, when the Court ordered a front room of the house occu-
</p>
<p>pied by Martin to be prepared for his safe-keeping. Before
</p>
<p>this change was effected Mr. Hay presented a resolution pass-
</p>
<p>ed by the Virginia Council of State tendering " apartments" in
</p>
<p>the third story of the Penitentiary, and he moved Burr's com-
</p>
<p>mitment there. To this the prisoners counsel strenuously ob-
</p>
<p>jected  the quarters proposed by the Court being more conve-
</p>
<p>nient. The Governor, Cabell, then wrote to offer Burr a choice
</p>
<p>of the rooms in the Penitentiary, with a stipulation that he
</p>
<p>should be permitted to see only those persons whom he chose
</p>
<p>to admit. A fine suite of three rooms were fitted up on the
</p>
<p>third floor of the building, where " the confined" lived in state
</p>
<p>until Aug. 2d, when he was returned to Martin's house. This

<p>assignment to Burr of respectable quarters called forth from
</p>
<p>Jefferson an indignant and unseemly protest He conceived
</p>
<p>that, thereafter, any prisoner would have a right to demand

<p>comfortable apartments. He viewed Burr as a malefactor and

<p>desired him to be treated as such.

</p>
<p>After Burr's indictment true bills were found against Colonel
</p>
<p>Comfort Tyler, Jonathan Dayton, John Smith, (U. S. Senator,)
</p>
<p>Davis Floyd and Israel Smith. After which the Court ad-
</p>
<p>journed (June 27th) to Aug. 8d. The interregnum was re-
</p>
<p>quired by both parties to make up their cases and to prepare
</p>
<p>for the important crisis, which was not only to determine the
</p>
<p>fate of Burr and his accomplices but was to fix precedents and
</p>
<p>supply legal construction of the law of treason. During the
</p>
<p>interval "the confined" remained in his apartment, but was
</p>
<p>more like a convalescing prince than a prisoner. His rooms
</p>
<p>were frequented by eminent persons of both sexes  many of
</p>
<p>whom came long distances to be present at the trial. The la-
</p>
<p>dies of Eichmond showered luxuries upon his table. He wrote
</p>
<p>gay letters, received visitors, chatted with cheerfulness and held
</p>
<p>conference with his counsel, thus filling up every moment of
</p>
<p>the entire day. From this pleasant Penitentiary he was trans
</p>
<p>ferred, Aug. 2d, to quarters prepared in Martin's lodgings near
</p>
<p>the Court House. On the day of trial he entered the room
</p>
<p>accompanied by his son-in-law, Grov^rnor Alston, of South
</p>
<p>Carolina. His serenity was complete and his energies all alive
</p>
<p>to the general conduct of his own case.
</p>
<p>To impanel a jury Was a tedious process  almost every per-
</p>
<p>son summoned having formed an opinion. It was not until
</p>
<p>the 17th that a panel was secured and sworn in. Even then
</p>
<p>it was accepted only as the most unprejudiced that could be
</p>
<p>had ! The introduction of testimony followed. Eaton, Com-
</p>
<p>modore Truxton, the Morgans,Blennerhassett's gardener, groom,
</p>
<p>and Woodbridge, his chief agent, were examined  the efibrt
</p>
<p>being to prove the overt act. Not a shadow of proof was ad-
</p>
<p>duced which could secure that starting point. When the pro-
</p>
<p>secution endeavored to introduce collateral and indirect evi-
</p>
<p>dence to sustain their case, it was resisted by the defense. A
</p>
<p>nine days' struggle followed over the right to put in secondary

<p>and inferential testimony after the primary and direct testimo-
</p>
<p>ny had failed. The splendid debate elicited all the legal talent
</p>
<p>engaged. During the wordy contest William Wirt pronounc-
</p>
<p>ed that speech upon the characters of Aaron Burr and Bleu-
</p>
<p>nerhassett which has rendered his name famous in school-books,

<p>and fliis victim infamous. The Virginian's orat,)rical eifort
</p>
<p>long must remain, both as a fine specimen of rhetorical beauty
</p>
<p>and as a ridiculous sacrifice of fact to fancy. Parton very cor-
</p>
<p>rectly characterises the speech as a "brilliant fiction." The
</p>
<p>contest over the point raised was not ended until Aug. 29th.
</p>
<p>Judge Marshall's decision was rendered on the 31st. His re-
</p>
<p>view of the case as presented was very clear, able and impar- 
</p>
<p>tial. He sustained the motion to exclude testimony indirect
</p>
<p>or merely corroborative, because, being incompetent to prove
</p>
<p>the overt act itself, it was irrelevant.
</p>
<p>This, of course, closed the case as to the prosecution for
</p>
<p>treason, unless the prosecutors should take exception to the
</p>
<p>ruling of the Court, or should spring some other and new issue.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hay asked time for himself and associates to consider the
</p>
<p>matter, and the Court adjourned to the day following, when
</p>
<p>the Prosecuting Attorney expressed his willingness to submit
</p>
<p>the case without further contest. The j ury retired and very
</p>
<p>soon returned with their verdict recorded as follows:
</p>
<p>" We, of the jury, say that Aaron Burr is not proved to be guilty un-
</p>
<p>der the indictment by any evidence submitted to us. We, therefore,
</p>
<p>find him not guilty."
</p>
<p>This singular finding for the moment excited Burr. He
</p>
<p>protested against its form and demanded that it should be ren-
</p>
<p>dered in the usual words, "guilty" or "not guilty." The jury
</p>
<p>positively refusing to qualify their verdict, the matter was
</p>
<p>compromised by an order of the Court to enter on the journal
</p>
<p>"not guilty."
</p>
<p>The result, though it seemingly took none by surprise, great-
</p>
<p>ly exasperated those who, like Mr. Jefferson, had resolved that
</p>
<p>he "was guilty without a shadow of doubt." * The President
</p>
<p>wrote to Mr. Hay, (Sept. 4th,) bidding him to pay no witness,
</p>
<p>nor to let him depart without taking a copy of his evidence,*
</p>
<p>* Writing to Mr. Hay, Aug. 20th, the President said : " Before an impartial jury

<p>Burr's conduct would convict himself were not one word of testimony to be offered
</p>
<p>against him. But, to what a state will our law be reduced by party feelings iu
</p>
<p>those who administer it." Considering that that jury was composed of men al-
</p>
<p>most every one of whom had formed an opinion prejudicial to the prisoner, the
</p>
<p>President's advance implication of mal-administration was highly censurable,
</p>
<p>to say the least.

<p>320 CONSPIKACY OF BURR.
</p>
<p>assuming that it was " now more- important than ever"  an ex-
</p>
<p>pression, Parton observes, betraying that " the real object of
</p>
<p>the prosecution was not so much to convict Aaron Burr of
</p>
<p>treason as to acquit Thomas Jefferson of precipitate and ridi-
</p>
<p>culous credulity." The President added:
</p>
<p>" The criminal is preserved to become the rally in g-point of all the
</p>
<p>disaffected and worthless of the United States, and to be the pivot on
</p>
<p>which all the intrigues and conspiracies which foreign governments may
</p>
<p>wish to disturb us with, are to turn. If he is convicted of the misde-
</p>
<p>meanor, the judge must in decency give us respite by some short con-
</p>
<p>finement of him ; but we must expect it to be very short. Be assured
</p>
<p>yourself, and communicate the same assurance to your colleagues, that
</p>
<p>your and their zeal and abilities have been displayed in this affair to my
</p>
<p>satisfaction and your own honor."
</p>
<p>The trial on the second indictment, for "misdemeanor," fol-
</p>
<p>lowed. Burr's counsel sought to prevent the arraignment on
</p>
<p>the plea that a person could not be twice tried for the same
</p>
<p>offense  that the verdict entered on the journal of " not guilty"
</p>
<p>covered the entire case. Judge Marshall, after a patient hear-
</p>
<p>ing of the points raised, decided for the second trial, and it
</p>
<p>proceeded. The subpoena duces tecum issued. Wilkinson came
</p>
<p>forward as the main witness, producing the cypher letter, and
</p>
<p>divulging all that he knew of Burr and his scheme. It will
</p>
<p>not surprise our readers to be told that the Conspirator con-
</p>
<p>fessed to the Court, under Burr's searching examination, to
</p>
<p>many things incompatible with his own position, and irrecon-
</p>
<p>cileable with an honest intent. Among other matters it was
</p>
<p>found that he had altered the cypher letter. He had previous-
</p>
<p>ly sworn that his version was a true translation of the original.
</p>
<p>It is doubtless true that the detected alterations were of a mi-
</p>
<p>nor nature ; but, that he dared at all to tamper with and to
</p>
<p>was : " These wliole proceedings will be laid before Congress that they Diay de-

<p>and the future." What "remedy" for the past could Congress apply, after the
</p>
<p>ruling of the Supreme Judge in Burr's case ? Did the President design by some
</p>
<p>extra-Constitutional act again to arraign Burr? There was, in truth, no necessity
</p>
<p>for this re-examination of witnesses simply for their testimony, for the good reason
</p>
<p>that the entire trial and evidence already had been fully reported for publication,
</p>
<p>giving to Congress all the information possible. The President must have had

<p>some other motive for his suggestion than to preserve testimony.

<p>change it proves liis ' easy virtue' and adds the crime of forgery
</p>
<p>to bis other sins of commission. The original was strong
</p>
<p>enough and brazen enough for its author's condemnation : that
</p>
<p>Wilkinson could make it a little stronger showed more zeal
</p>
<p>than honesty. When Burr explained, upon his first discovery
</p>
<p>of his confederate's defection : "As to any projects which may
</p>
<p>have been formed between General Wilkinson and myself
</p>
<p>heretofore, they are now completely frustrated by the perfidi-
</p>
<p>ous conduct of Wilkinson, and the world must pronounce him
</p>
<p>a perfidious villain. If I am sacrificed my portfolio will prove
</p>
<p>him to be such," he not only expressed his own convictions
</p>
<p>but interpreted the verdict which time is afiixing to the Gene-

<p>ral's character.^
</p>
<p>The trial for misdemeanor ended only wnth the last week of
</p>
<p>October, and resulted in his acquittal on the technical ground
</p>
<p>that the offense, was not, as charged in the indictment, com-
</p>
<p>mitted in Virginia, but in Ohio. The decision of the Court
</p>
<p>was, that Burr and Blennerhassett should give bail in the sum
</p>
<p>of three thousand dollars each, for appearance in Ohio for fur-

<p>and Burr's friends as a concession to the powers at Washing-

<p>confessed was not without a delicate relation to their own po-
</p>

<p>for misdemeanor and found guilty of having set on foot a mil-

<p>itary expedition against the provinces of Spain ; but, no pun-

</p>
<p>on a similar charge, but was acquitted. His chief oifense was

<p>in sustaining the right of his court to issue writs oiluibeas cor-

<p>pus in spite of Wilkinson's military orders * for the arrest of
</p>
<p>persons sxis'pected of knowing something of Burr's designs.
</p>
<p>With this ends the story of Burr's Conspiracy. We have
</p>
<p>recorded its leading incidents ; and, out of the multiplicity of
</p>
<p>documents submitted, have endeavored to give a correct inter-
</p>
<p>pretation to events and to testimony.
</p>
<p>The fact that evidence sufficient for conviction was not found
</p>
<p>does not absolve the Conspirator from guilt ; but, we are in-
</p>
<p>clined to judge less harshly of his schemes when we consider
</p>
<p>the leading part played by Wilkinson and the immunity shown
</p>
<p>to that individual's crimes. He not only retained the conii-
</p>
<p>dence of Jefferson but of his successor, and only retired from
</p>
<p>the service of the United States" after the disasters of 1813-1-i
</p>
<p>proved his wretched incompetency. He had conceived, and
</p>
<p>labored for, the separation of the West from the East years be-
</p>
<p>fore Burr had dreamed of such a thing ; he took Spanish
</p>
<p>money, and, while holdmg an important office under the Fed-
</p>
<p>eral Government, was plotting, with other leading citizens, to
</p>
<p>betray Kentucky into the hands of a foreign power. And yet,
</p>
<p>his accomplices in that infamous sale and cession were retain-
</p>
<p>ed in important Federal offices after their guilt became known,
</p>
<p>and one of them (George Nicholas) acted as Mr. Jefferson's
</p>
<p>chief instrument in forcing through the Kentucky Legislature
</p>
<p>the resolutions of '98. When we witness the immunity shown
</p>
<p>to these conspirators, and to the honors heaped upon them by

<p>'democratic' administrations, we can consistently call for Burr's

<p>public estimation, for tlieir sins against tlie State. Burr's crime
</p>
<p>did not, in the estimation of Iiis prosecutors, consist in levjang
</p>
<p>war against Spain. Mr. Jefferson was only awaiting the pro-
</p>
<p>per moment to cany out the design of invading Mexico. In-
</p>
<p>deed, he had elaborated upon Burr's programme by including
</p>
<p>Cuba in the spoils. He wrote, Aug. 16th (1807) :
</p>
<p>"I had rather have war against Spain than not, if we go to war
</p>
<p>against England. Our Southern defensive force can take the Floi'idas,
</p>
<p>volunteers for a Mexican army will flock to our standard, and rich
</p>
<p>pabulum will be oflered to our privateers in the plunder of their
</p>
<p>commerce and coasts. Probable Cuba would add itself to our Con-
</p>
<p>federation."
</p>
<p>Had Aaron Burr written such a letter it would have been
</p>
<p>pronounced 'just like the audacious adventurer.' His indict-
</p>
<p>ment was for treason  levying war against his own country.
</p>
<p>As that was not proven^ as no evidence was produced to sub-
</p>
<p>stantiate the overt act, there now really is much less testimony
</p>
<p>of Burr's actual guilt than of the guilt of the Kentucky Con-
</p>
<p>spirators of 1785. It is true that, in the report afterwards
</p>
<p>made by John Quincy Adams (November 30th, 1807) as chair-
</p>
<p>man of the Senate Committee to consider the case of John
</p>
<p>Smith  Senator from Ohio, charged with knowledge of, and
</p>
<p>co-operation in, Burr's schemes  the guilt of Burr was presum-
</p>
<p>ed to be conclusive, and vast credit was accorded to the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent for his vigilance and energy in frustrating the plot ; but,
</p>
<p>that report, written under the spur of the intense feeling pre-
</p>
<p>vailing against Burr, does not make the case of the prosecution
</p>
<p>any stronger. We who have witnessed the gigantic conspiracy
</p>
<p>of 1860-61, which fortified itself by the resolutions of '98, will
</p>
<p>be less liable to hang and quarter the adventurer of 1806-7
</p>
<p>than the author of those revolutionary resolves : while we ex-
</p>
<p>press our just detestation of Burr let us not forget to give him

<p>Burr's succeeding fortunes were those of an outlawed citi-

</p>
<p>when, under the disguised name of Edwards, he was placed

<p>Staten Island. In this packet he reached England in safety.
</p>
<p>No sooner was he on English soil than his fertile mind began
</p>
<p>to work, and the ex-Yice President soon was an admitted
</p>
<p>guest of Prime Ministers and men of influence. But this con-

<p>all  the accomplished gentleman and insincere friend. He

<p> unmolested, except by his old " Mexican" creditors  up to

<p>the close of his life, Sept. 14th, 1836. He obtained a lucrative

<p>THE NEW ENGLAND DISCONTENTS, 1807-14.
</p>
<p>Disaffection between the JSTorthern and Southern States
</p>
<p>of the Union became a recognized fact at an early day. ^ The
</p>
<p>Convention which formed the Constitution was not harmoni-
</p>
<p>ous ; nor did that instrument, after its adoption, win a unani-
</p>
<p>mous acquiescence. ] It was a mass of compromises ; the Fede-
</p>
<p>ral authority conceding to that of the States  the Northern or
</p>
<p>commercial conceding to the Southern or agricultural section
</p>
<p> the majority of the North conceding to the minority of the
</p>
<p>South, by granting a representation on Slaves.' These conces-
</p>
<p>sions reconciled but did not satisfy men. States and sections.
</p>
<p>As the instrument had been adopted in Convention only after
</p>
<p>prolonged opposition, so it excited among the people a spirit
</p>
<p>of contention which threatened its rejection by the State Legis-
</p>
<p>latures. It was regarded in the various lights of " an experi-
</p>
<p>ment," a "consolidated tyranny," a "centralization fatal to
</p>
<p>State independence," a " stepping stone to monarchy," &c.
</p>
<p>Washington said of it : " there are some things in it which
</p>
<p>never did and never will obtain my cordial approbation." Pat-
</p>
<p>rick Henry denounced it as inimical ,to the liberties of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple. Franklin said, in the Convention: "I consent to this
</p>
<p>Constitution because I expect no better."
</p>
<p>The attempt to construct a consolidated government out of
</p>
<p>states, diverse in interests, each jealous of its sovereignty, was
</p>
<p>" an experiment ;" and Washington's expression of surprise,
</p>
<p>that any arrangement had been made, was justified by the re-
</p>
<p>sult eventually achieved in the adoption of the Federal organ-
</p>
<p>ic law. He said : "It appears to me little short of a mu\acle
</p>
<p>that the delegates from so many States, different from each

</p>
<p>unite in forming a system of National Government so little
</p>
<p>liable to well founded objections ;" uttering, however, in the
</p>
<p>same paragraph, his own qualified acceptance of the instru-
</p>
<p>ment : "Nor am I yet such an enthusiastic, partial or indis-
</p>
<p>'.riminating admirer of it as not to perceive it is tinctured with
</p>
<p>some real though not radical defects." Many, who either as-
</p>
<p>sisted in the construction of the new Government, or took part
</p>
<p>in the discussions which followed, dissented while they ap-
</p>
<p>proved  accepted because it was the best to be obtained. So
</p>
<p>strong was the desire for a "more perfect Union," so alarming
</p>
<p>the disorders threatening, that men of divers opinions struck
</p>
<p>palms in token of brotherhood and prepared conscientiously to
</p>
<p>enforce what they had created. But this enforcement excited
</p>
<p>different views regarding the powers bestowed upon the Execu-
</p>
<p>tive, upon Congress, and reserved to the States. _ These differ-
</p>
<p>ences soon assumed a "representative" form./ Ere Washing-
</p>
<p>ton's first term had expired, opposition to his construction of
</p>
<p>the Constitution took up even an armed form, and force be-
</p>
<p>came necessary to suppress the insurrection. This conflict of
</p>
<p>opinion created an antagonistic element which expressed itself
</p>
<p>in the various forms of open and secret organizations  some of
</p>
<p>them treasonable and others quite legitimate under the assured
</p>
<p>liberty of thought and speech. They all finally centralized
</p>
<p>around Thomas Jefferson. With Aaron Burr, Madison, Geo.
</p>
<p>Clinton, Governor Miflin and others, he laid the foundation of
</p>
<p>what soon was known as the anti-Federal or Eepublican party,
</p>
<p>whose distinctive tenets were, in 1798, embodied in the resolu-
</p>
<p>tions prepared by Jefferson for the Kentucky Eepublicans, and
</p>
<p>in the resolutions, with their accompanying address, prepared
</p>
<p>by Madison for the Virginia Legislature. Under the force of
</p>
<p>this opposition Jefferson became President in 1801 and Aaron
</p>
<p>Burr Vice President. Under their shrewd management and

<p>patronage the party fathered by Washington, Hamilton, John

</p>
<p>ring the period in whicli Virginia Presidents ruled successively,
</p>
<p>for twenty-four years, is now a matter of History. .
</p>
<p>In this paper we propose to treat of the discontent which
</p>
<p>prevailed in the North-Eastern States after the accession to
</p>
<p>power of the Republicans or Democrats  to advert to that train
</p>
<p>of causes which resulted in the Hartford Convention,
</p>
<p>The contest of Crowns in Europe, during Napoleon's reign,
</p>
<p>affected the entire civilized world. French and English com-
</p>
<p>merce having been, by the fortunes of war, mutually driven
</p>
<p>from the seas, left the carrying trade in neutral hands. The
</p>
<p>New England States of America, then an essentially commer-
</p>
<p>cial community, profited by this trade to an extent which
</p>
<p>quickened all the avenues of public prosperity. Their seaports
</p>
<p>became marts of busy men; their waters floated merchant
</p>
<p>fleets; their mechanics and manufacturers prospered. But,
</p>
<p>this condition of affairs was short-lived. Presuming to dictate
</p>
<p>for a world the two great powers, decreed maritime laws and
</p>
<p>principles of blockade which soon reduced neutral commerce
</p>
<p>to a shadow. In May, 1806, the Ministry of Great Britain
</p>
<p>proclaimed an Order in Council blockading the entire coast
</p>
<p>from Brest, France, to the Elbe, in Germany, and all vessels
</p>
<p>of neutral powers were forbidden to enter any of the ports on
</p>
<p>the line named. This was but a "paper blockade," for Eng-
</p>
<p>land had not vessels enough to spare fi-om active service for
</p>
<p>closing one half of that coast of six hundred miles. ^ Yet, to
</p>
<p>violate that mandate in Council was to incur the penalty of
</p>
<p>reprisals and war. Napoleon retaliated, November 21st of the
</p>
<p>same year, by a decree declaring the entire British coast in a
</p>
<p>state of blockade. England thereupon repeated the terms of
</p>
<p>her paper restriction, and, by a second Order in Council  issu-
</p>
<p>ed 7th January, 1807  forbidding neutral vessels from trading
</p>
<p>between the ports of France and her allies, or with ports in

</p>
<p>possession of Frencli armies, or, indeed, with any port or coun-
</p>
<p>try from which British vessels were excluded !
</p>
<p>These purely paper blockades and maritime usurpations,
</p>
<p>characterised by injustice and tyranny, struck a death blow to
</p>
<p>the neutral commerce of Europe  as they, and succeeding de-
</p>
<p>crees, were designed to do ; while they severely crippled the
</p>
<p>commerce of the United States. The orders were followed by
</p>
<p>seizures which, ere long, became not only promiscuous, and
</p>
<p>irregular even under the regulations established by the decrees,
</p>
<p>but were accompanied by infractions of jurisdiction of an inso-
</p>
<p>lent and defiant character. Our own ports were invaded by
</p>
<p>cruisers and oflQ.cers of both belligerents, pursuing one another,
</p>
<p>or seeking for plunder in our ships. English vessels-of-war,
</p>
<p>then wanting men to man them, not only arrogated the right
</p>
<p>of search, but superadded the right of impressment of all who
</p>
<p>had, at any time, been British subjects. Merchant ships, fish-
</p>
<p>ing smacks, coasters, everywhere were overhauled, and every
</p>
<p>Briton  including Irish and Scotch  was mercilessly dragged
</p>
<p>away to serve his Majesty at his Majesty's pleasure. Many so
</p>
<p>seized were American citizens, who had not even been born
</p>
<p>abroad, while the vast majority had, by their oath of allegiance
</p>
<p>and naturalization, obtained the rights of citizenship and pro-
</p>
<p>tection guaranteed by our Constitution. But, the wrong was
</p>
<p>not confined to our merchant marine and to unarmed craft.
</p>
<p>British arrogance proceeded to the extremity of an outrage
</p>
<p>upon an American vessel of war, in American waters  an out-
</p>
<p>rage until then unparalleled for its audacity and brutality. The
</p>
<p>U. S. frigate Chesapeake, of 38 guns. Commodore Barron com-
</p>
<p>manding, having refitted at Portsmouth (Ya.) Navy Yard,
</p>
<p>started for the Mediterranean station June 22d, 1807. Three
</p>
<p>British vessels of war then lay in Lynnhaven Bay, making
</p>
<p>one of our ports their rendezvous. One of them, the Leopard,
</p>
<p>of 50 guns, weiglxed anchor and stood out of the Capes ahead

<p>of the Federal frigate. When three leagues at sea the Leojxird
</p>
<p>hailed, and sent a boat to the ChesapeaJce with " dispatches" to
</p>
<p>Barron from Yice Admiral Berkley. These dispatches simply
</p>
<p>consisted of an order-to search the Federal vessel for "desert-
</p>
<p>ers." Barron knew of no "deserters," and replied that he
</p>
<p>BRITISH NAVAL OUTRAGE. 829
</p>
<p>should not permit his men to be mustered. The Leopard then
</p>
<p>gained the weather quarter and again hailed, to which Barron
</p>
<p>replied that he did not understand that second summons. A
</p>
<p>single ball was the Briton's answer, to be followed, in a mo-
</p>
<p>ment, by bis full broadside. For fifteen minutes the Leopard's
</p>
<p>guns were rapidly discharged, cutting the American frignte
</p>
<p>severely. Three of her crew were killed and eighteen wound-
</p>
<p>ed. Barron at length struck his flag, having fired but one gun.
</p>
<p>His entire decks were so cluttered with material and baggage
</p>
<p>not yet stowed away that not a single gun was in working
</p>
<p>order. Had she been in trim it is probable he would have
</p>
<p>sunk \hQ Leopard; in which case he would have had to engage
</p>
<p>the two remaining ships. The surrender of the ChesapeaJce
</p>
<p>was twice refused, but four of her men were borne away. This
</p>
<p>high handed act against a nation at peace with Great Britain
</p>
<p>created an excitement without bounds. On all hands the peo-
</p>
<p>ple plead for the wrong to be avenged. Jefferson at once start-
</p>
<p>ed a vessel with dispatches for Mr. Munroe, our Minister to
</p>
<p>England, to demand satisfaction for the outrage. This step
</p>
<p>was followed, July 2d, by a proclamation forbidding the wa-
</p>
<p>ters of the United States to all British vessels of war unless in
</p>
<p>distress, or acting as bearer of dispatches. The Virginia mili-
</p>
<p>tia were called out, and proceeded to Norfolk and vicinity, to
</p>
<p>assist in driving the British fleet out of Hampton Eoads. Or-
</p>
<p>ders were issued to the commandants of New York, Charleston
</p>
<p>and New Orleans to put their defenses in the best possible or-
</p>
<p>der. Congress was called to meet October 26th, by which date
</p>
<p>it was thought an answer must arrive to the demand for satis-
</p>
<p>faction. Congress assembled to learn that the British Ministry
</p>
<p>would treat, but did not wish to consider together Mr. Munroe's
</p>
<p>two demands, viz.: for satisfaction and for security from further
</p>
<p>impressments. This was but a contemptible expedient to gain
</p>
<p>time. Jefferson and Congress so thought, and appropriations

<p>mendation was acted upon with almost unseemly haste. It
</p>
<p>was a deadly blow to our already crippled commerce : to
</p>
<p>New England it was the knell of her prosperity, threatening all
</p>
<p>branches of her trade and industry with overwhelming ruin.
</p>
<p>Even the coasting and fishing trade was estopped by restric-
</p>
<p>tions, so radical was the measure. After only four hours' dis-
</p>
<p>cussion the bill passed in the Senate, Dec. 18th. The House
</p>
<p>amended and passed the act Dec. 22d, by a vote of 82 to 4A.
</p>
<p>The Senate concurred in the slight House amendments, the
</p>
<p>President, without an hour's delay, signed the bill, and the
</p>
<p>Embargo became the law of the land.
</p>
<p>All this action, it will be seen, was predicated on the dis-
</p>
<p>patches from Armstrong, our Minister to France. If its pro-
</p>
<p>priety was doubted all doubts for the moment were forgotten
</p>
<p>when news came of England's new Order in Council, dated
</p>
<p>Nov. 11th, 1807, but not promulgated until Nov. 17th. These
</p>
<p>orders " prohibited any neutral trade with France or her allies,
</p>
<p>in other words, with the whole of Europe, Sweden excepted,
</p>
<p>unless through Great Britain. All neutral vessels, whatever
</p>
<p>tneir cargoes, bound to any port of France or her allies, were
</p>
<p>required, under pain of capture and condemnation, first to
</p>
<p>touch at some British or Irish port, and there to pay such re-
</p>
<p>exportation duties as might be imposed, and to obtain, by the
</p>
<p>payment of certain fees, a British license to trade to the Conti-

</p>
<p>France or her allies except in vessels which had complied with
</p>
<p>the foregoing regulation, all such vessels being further requir-

</p>
<p>country." 
</p>
<p>This edict elicited from Napoleon his celebrated Milan de-
</p>
<p>cree of Dec. 17th, 1807, confirming and extending the provi-
</p>
<p>gions of his Berlin decree. This new mandate of the ruler of
</p>
<p>Europe, and would-be ruler of the world, " denationalized and
</p>
<p>forfeited every vessel which should submit to be searched by
</p>
<p>a British cruiser, or should pay any tax, duty, or license mo-
</p>
<p>ney to the British government, or should be found on the high
</p>
<p>seas or elsewhere, bound to or from any British port, Spain
</p>
<p>and Holland, with their usual subserviency, forthwith issued
</p>
<p>similar decrees."
</p>
<p>Under the press of these accumulated impositions the Em-
</p>
<p>bargo was enforced ; but, not all the j ustification urged by its
</p>
<p>friends could reconcile the New England people to its destruc-
</p>
<p>tive operation. It was a , source of indignant comment in all
</p>
<p>circles. How to evade it soon became the study of the rest-
</p>
<p>less, sagacious vessel owners and officers. The more Govern-
</p>
<p>ment tried to punish violators the greater became the odium,
</p>
<p>attached to the law, which was pronounced unnecessary, uncot -
</p>
<p>stitutional, arbitrary, and levied by the agricultural South re

<p>gardless of the rights, interests and wishes of the commercial

<p>_Nortkj Town meetings denounced it ; magistrates refused l )
</p>
<p>lend their assistance in its enforcement ; smuggling and e\'a-
</p>
<p>sion were not regarded as dishonorable. St. Mary's, in Geor-
</p>
<p>gia, and Eastport, in Maine, became great entrepots for the con-
</p>
<p>traband trade. Situated on the frontiers, with navigable rivers
</p>
<p>reaching into the interior, they were very available for receiv-

<p>ing goods and passing provisions over the line to British and

<p>Spanish hands, from whence they found their way to Halifax,

<p>on the North, and to the West Indies on the South. Large

<p>quantities also passed, by way of Lake Champlain and over the

</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Legislature upon its convention in June,
</p>
<p>1808 immediately grappled with the anomalous position of
</p>
<p>trade and navigation, " a question," says Hildreth, " in which
</p>
<p>that State was deeply interested, as owner of more than one
</p>
<p>third of the shipping of the Union. The views of the majority
</p>
<p>were expressed in a series of able resolutions, which began by
</p>
<p>calling in question the constitutional power of Congress to im-
</p>
<p>pose an unlimited embargo  an experiment, so far as it had in
</p>
<p>view the coercion of foreign nations, novel and dangerous,
</p>
<p>doubtful in its effects abroad, and full of disaster at home.
</p>
<p>Supposing the embargo to be constitutional, yet the vast au-
</p>
<p>thority delegated to the President to regulate the coasting trade,
</p>
<p>and to grant exemptions and dispensations from the rigor of
</p>
<p>the law, was denounced as a dangerous opening for partiality,
</p>
<p>tending to prepare the country for the habitual surrender of
</p>
<p>the legislative power into a single hand. Though our true
</p>
<p>policy was a peaceful one, the people of Massachusetts would
</p>
<p>ever be ready to endure all privations, and to make every ex-
</p>
<p>ertion to support the dignity and to enforce the reasonable
</p>
<p>pretensions of the nation. The resources of the country being
</p>
<p>fully adequate to the protection of its maritime and territorial
</p>
<p>rights, they ought to be directed and employed in such prepa-
</p>
<p>rations as the experience of ages had demonstrated to be alone
</p>
<p>effectual for that purpose. A naval force was especially neces-
</p>
<p>sary, and the senators and representatives of Massachusetts
</p>
<p>were pressed to urge upon Congress effectual steps in that di-
</p>
<p>rection. The General Government having been expressly in-
</p>
<p>stituted to provide for the common defense and general welfare,
</p>
<p>and to preserve the blessings of liberty, while it secures those
</p>
<p>inestimable objects by an equal and paternal solicitude for the
</p>
<p>various sections of the Union, must be supported at every ex-
</p>
<p>pense and every hazard ; but the General Government 'was one
</p>
<p>thing, and the administration of it another ; that administration

<p>being only entitled to the confidence of the people, when, by a
</p>
<p>full, fair, and frequent display of its purposes and policy, it
</p>
<p>preserved itself from the imputation of partiality and preju-

<p>dice, and of undue fear and affection in the conduct of foreign
</p>
<p>as well as of domestic affairs."
</p>
<p>/
</p>
<p>THE ENFORCING ACT. 333
</p>
<p>These resolutions fairly interpreted tlie feeling of the people.
</p>
<p>They were bitterness itself to the President, casting in his face,
</p>
<p>as they did, a want of confidence in his use of power and in
</p>
<p>his impartiality. John Quincy Adams, then acting with the
</p>
<p>Administration party, refused to endorse the course prescribed
</p>
<p>for him and was superceded by the election of James Lloyd, a
</p>
<p>merchant and ship owner of Boston. In this procedure Adams
</p>
<p>assumed to discover the operations of the old " Essex Junto,"
</p>
<p>in which the elder Adams had found an unrelenting enemy to
</p>
<p>his French treaty and concession to Democratic clamor. This
</p>
<p>Junto, John Quincy Adams regarded as treasonable  aiming
</p>
<p>to throw the country under British domination ; and the Ee-
</p>
<p>publicans (Democrats) were not slow to discover in every Fed-
</p>
<p>eralist an enemy to the Union and Constitution. The Admin-
</p>
<p>istration partisans resolved not to repeal but to renew these
</p>
<p>restrictions on commerce, and, in spite of the most strenuous
</p>
<p>opposition of the Federalists of New England, succeeded in
</p>
<p>forcing through Congress (Jan. 9th, 1809) what was termed the
</p>
<p>Enforcing Act The action which followed this legislation is
</p>
<p>thus chronicled by Hildreth :
</p>
<p>" Already, before the passage of the Enforcing Act, public meetings
</p>
<p>began to be held in the mercantile towns of New England, to jn-otest
</p>
<p>against it. Similar meetings were also held in Albany and the city of
</p>
<p>New York. The leading Federal newspapers in Boston announced its
</p>
<p>passage with mourning columns, and with the motto, ' Liberty is dead !'
</p>
<p>General Lincoln, the collector, now very old and infirm, resigned his
</p>
<p>office, as did also the dej^uty collector, rather than undertake to enforce
</p>
<p>an act so unpopular. Other custom-house officers at other joorts follow-
</p>
<p>ed their example. Th,e merchants, indeed, totally denying the consti-
</p>
<p>tutionality of the act, gave fair warning that, for every seizure of their
</p>
<p>property under it, they should commence suits in the State courts ; a
</p>
<p>procedure, as it might be no easy matter for the officers to procure bail,

</p>
<p>likely to end in their committal to prison.
</p>
<p>" A Boston town-meeting, regularly called, after a warm struggle be-
</p>
<p>tween the opposers of the embargo and the friends of the Administra-
</p>
<p>tion, in which the latter were completely beaten, agreed ujjon a strong
</p>
<p>memorial to the Legislature about to meet, denouncing the Enforcing
</p>
<p>Act as arbitrary and unconstitutional. This meeting resolved ' not vol-
</p>
<p>untarily to assist in carrying it into execution ; and that all who should
</p>
<p>do so ought to be considered as enemies of the Constitution of the
</p>
<p>334 THE NEW ENGLAND DISCONTENTS.
</p>
<p>United States, enemies of the State of Massachusetts, and hostile to the
</p>
<p>liberties of the people.' "
</p>
<p>The answer of the Legislature was equally significant. The
</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Governor, Lincoln, a Democrat  Governor Sullivan
</p>
<p>being dead  had demanded in his first message that something
</p>
<p>be done to restore the confidence of the National Administra-
</p>
<p>tion in Massachusetts loyalty. The response was very like a
</p>
<p>threat. Says the historian :
</p>
<p>" Care was taken explicitly to disavow any disposition to separate
</p>
<p>from the Union, or intention to encourage resistance to the laws. At
</p>
<p>the same time, it was pretty plainly intimated that the embargo and its
</p>
<p>supplements were not laws. ' The people of New England,' said the
</p>
<p>Senate, ' perfectly understand the distinction between the Constitution
</p>
<p>and the Administration. They are as sincerely attached to the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution as any portion of the United States. They may be put under
</p>
<p>the ban of the empire, but they have no intention of abandoning the
</p>
<p>Union.' Adherence to the Union did not, however, require even pas-
</p>
<p>sive obedience to unconstitutional and ruinous stretches of power. ' On
</p>
<p>such occasions, passive obedience would, on the part of the j)eople, be a
</p>
<p>breach of their allegiance, and, on our part, treachery and jjerjury. The
</p>
<p>peojjle have not sent us hei-e to surrender their rights, but to maintain
</p>
<p>and defend them ; and we have no authority to dispense with the duties
</p>
<p>thus solemnly imposed.'
</p>
<p>" At the very opening of the session, a great mass of petitions had
</p>
<p>been jjresented to the House from various town-meetings. Upon these
</p>
<p>petitions a report was made, concluding with a series of resolutions (in
</p>
<p>which the Senate concurred) pronouncing the late Enforcing Act to l)e,
</p>
<p>in many respects, ' unjust, oppressive, and unconstitutional, and not le-
</p>
<p>gally binding ;' recommending, however, to parties aggrieved by it, ' to
</p>
<p>abstain from forcible resistance, and to apply for remedy in a peaceful
</p>
<p>manner to the laws of the commonwealth.' A strong memorial to Con-
</p>
<p>gress against the embargo was presently adopted, and a bill was passL'd,
</p>
<p>prohibiting, under high penalties, any searches of dwelling-houses, un-

<p>less by virtue of warrants issued on complaints supported by oath  a
</p>
<p>particular in which the Enforcing Act Avas thought to trench upon the
</p>
<p>Constitutions both of the State and the Union. This bill, however,
</p>
<p>failed to become a law, by reason of the executive veto.
</p>
<p>"An order from Washington, in consequence of the resignation of
</p>
<p>the collector of Boston, to the commandant of the fort in the harbor, to
</p>
<p>allow no vessel to pass, though countermanded a few days after, served
</p>
<p>to add to the excitement. All the ships hoisted their flags at half must.
</p>
<p>It was not without reason that Randolijh warned the Administration
</p>
<p>that they were treading fast in the fatal footsteps of Lord North."
</p>
<p>HOSTILE ATTITUDE TAKEN. 835
</p>
<p>Nor was Massacliusetts alone in assuming an attitude of
</p>
<p>menace. Connecticut was equally decided in her views of the
</p>
<p>embargo and its collateral acts, f Governor Trumbull declined
</p>
<p>(Feb. 4th, 1809) to comply with the President's circular for
</p>
<p>the designation of special officers of militia on whom the col-
</p>
<p>lectors of the customs might call for aid. He did not know,
</p>
<p>so he stated, of any authority under which such appointments
</p>
<p>could be made. Instead of detaching militia to aid the col-,
</p>
<p>lectors, he summoned the Legislature to meet ; in his opening;
</p>
<p>address (Feb. 23) to which he took the ground that, on great'
</p>
<p>emergencies, when the National Legislature had been led to,
</p>
<p>overstep its constitutional power, it became the right and duty?
</p>
<p>of the State Legislatures ' to interpose their protecting shield
</p>
<p>between the rights and liberties of the people and the assumed )
</p>
<p>power of the Greneral Government.'] The session resulted in
</p>
<p>the adoption of measures very similar to those of Massachu-
</p>
<p>setts." In all the New England States, indeed, as well as in
</p>
<p>New York, the reaction was very perceptibly gaining ground,
</p>
<p>and in Congress the tide began to turn ; the Administration
</p>
<p>during January rapidly lost ground. ^Democratic members
</p>
<p>from the North deserted a restrictive policy, opposing both
</p>
<p>embargo and war. A sensible excitement pervaded Adminis-
</p>
<p>tration circles. Every effort, private and parliamentary, was
</p>
<p>used to steady the refluent tide but to no purpose. The month
</p>
<p>of February was passed in highly exciting debate, which final-
</p>
<p>ly ended in the ostensible repeal of the embargo by the adop- .
</p>
<p>tion of a new act, of anomalous character, full of apparent re-
</p>
<p>strictions upon commerce ; but, so illy constructed was the law
</p>
<p>as to open ways and means of evasion, enough almost to satisfy
</p>
<p>the people that evasion was designed !
</p>
<p>Pending this Congressional excitement sentiments inimical
</p>
<p>to the integrity of the Eepublic itself were expressed by a
</p>
<p>powerful and significant address published by the Massachu-

</p>
<p>This document severely censured the pro-French policy and

</p>
<p>toward a better and more equitable administration of the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment that the Constitution should be so amended as to de-
</p>
<p>prive the Slave States of their exceptional representation.
</p>
<p>Other amendments were suggested which should positively
</p>
<p>"secure commerce and navigation from a repetition of invidi-
</p>
<p>ous and destructive theories^ The address added :
</p>
<p>" Nothing less than a perfect union and intelligence among the East-
</p>
<p>ern States can preserve to them any share of influence in the National
</p>
<p>Government. Without influence, they can expect no regard tp their in-
</p>
<p>terests, but are exposed to the efliect of a policy whose olyect will be to
</p>
<p>secure power and office with a view to local and personal aggrandize-
</p>
<p>ment; and to make them colonial governments, subject to the worst form
</p>
<p>of domination, that of one member of a confederacy over another. In-
</p>
<p>deed, the present state of our connection is not far from that condition.
</p>
<p>The late election of Eepresentatives to Congress, and the vote for Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, plainly demonstrate the disapprobation of the present system by
</p>
<p>a great majority of the Eastern people. Mr. Madison, who was known
</p>
<p>to favor it, had not a vote in those States except in Vermont, and re-
</p>
<p>cent elections there afford evidence that at this moment he would have
</p>
<p>none. On the other hand, in the Southern States, from the artificial
</p>
<p>popularity of this fatal system, his majority has been triumi^hant. The
</p>
<p>same division is apjjarent in Congress. The known wishes of the East-
</p>
<p>ern States have been not merely neglected, but rejected with threaten-
</p>
<p>iugs and contempt. Politicians of yesterday, from the backwoods and
</p>
<p>mountains, vie with each other in the language of insult and defiance ;
</p>
<p>and the men whom you delight to honor, and the great majority of
</p>
<p>those who have the deepest interests at stake in the welfare of the coun-
</p>
<p>try, are stigmatized as a corrupt and seditious part of the community.
</p>
<p>Even when those of your own reisresentatives, who have encouraged by
</p>
<p>their countenance this presumptuous conduct, discovering their errors,
</p>
<p>are desirous to recede, repentance comes too late. Thus, under new

</p>
<p>hj a sudden increase of Federalist strengtli. Not only in New
</p>
<p>England but in New York, and even in Maryland, they won
</p>
<p>the popular branches of the Legislature  a result astounding
</p>
<p>to the Democrats, whose triumphs had been so complete, and
</p>
<p>whose tactics had been so potent as to lead them to ideas of a
</p>
<p>life lease on power.
</p>
<p>These events were followed by the announcement, April 17th,
</p>
<p>that a treaty had been concluded with Mr. Erskine, the British
</p>
<p>Minister, by which all matters in dispute with his Grovernment
</p>
<p>were provisionally settled. A proclamation issued announc-
</p>
<p>ing a cessation of the embargo and non-intercourse so far as
</p>
<p>related to Great Britain and her dependencies, after June 10th.
</p>
<p>This news spread like wild-fire throughout the country, giving
</p>
<p>to the seaport towns in particular the most unalloyed satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Thus, for the moment, all things seemed propitious, Madi-
</p>
<p>son, the newly elected President, in negotiating with Erskine,
</p>
<p>appeared to Federalists to have abandoned the " persecuting
</p>
<p>policy" of his predecessor. Hence New England visibly sub-
</p>
<p>sided in excitement The French Minister at Washington
</p>
<p>grew indignant over the Erskine treaty and growled, and Con-
</p>
<p>gress legislated a little for his satisfaction by an act dropping
</p>
<p>the embargo, and, with it, the provision excluding foreign arm-
</p>
<p>ed vessels  which gave to French vessels of war the right of
</p>
<p>entry, rendezvous and supply in our ports. Congress ad-
</p>
<p>journed June 28th, after its five weeks' session, in great good
</p>
<p>feeling.
</p>
<p>All was changed again, in a few weeks of comparative quiet.
</p>
<p>July 20th the news arrived that the British Ministry had re-
</p>
<p>jected Erskine's treaty! This announcement threw all circles
</p>
<p>once more into ferment. The excitement which followed was
</p>
<p>indeed great, f The British Premier, Canning, refusing to ac-
</p>
<p>cept Erskine's arrangement, insisted that his representative had

<p>exceeded his powers, and had, also, misjudged" the true posi-
</p>
<p>tion of affairs. The offending minister therefore was recalled
</p>
<p>and "Copenhagen" Jackson sent in his stead. With Jackson
</p>
<p>some sharp correspondence soon^ succeeded. Madison insisted,
</p>
<p>much to Jackson's surprise, that all communication between
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>338 THE NEW ENGLAND DISCONTENTS.
</p>
<p>them should be reduced to writing. A lengthy negotiation foi
</p>
<p>explanations and new terms of accommodation of differences
</p>
<p>followed. Jackson's intercourse with the Administration was
</p>
<p>characterised by no little rhetorical severity, and, so offensive
</p>
<p>at length did he become, that our Secretary of State refused
</p>
<p>further correspondence with him (Nov. 8th) as preliminary to
</p>
<p>an application for his recall. Whereupon the British embas-
</p>
<p>sador withdrew to New York to await the order of his govern-
</p>
<p>ment. He addressed (Nov. 13th) a circular to the British con
</p>
<p>suls in the United States to notify them of his withdrawal, and
</p>
<p>accompanied this notification with an abstract of his last com-
</p>
<p>munication, made through his secretarj^, in rej)ly to the notice
</p>
<p>of his rejection by our Government. This unusual procedure
</p>
<p>was construed as an insult  for, what had consuls to do with
</p>
<p>ministerial differences ? It savored strongly of the offensive
</p>
<p>course pursued by the little Frenchman, Genet, in threatening
</p>
<p>an appeal from the Government to the people, during Wash-
</p>
<p>ington's administration.
</p>
<p>The efforts of Congress  which assembled Nov. 29th, 1809
</p>
<p> were directed to a revision of the laws regulating, or, rather,
</p>
<p>restricting commerce. Debate of a very acrimonious character
</p>
<p>was the consequence. No distinctive party lines were drawn.
</p>
<p>The New England State representatives, assisted by members
</p>
<p>from other sections, pressed the repeal of all laws burdening
</p>
<p>trade, assuming that, in spite of the French and English retal-
</p>
<p>iatory decrees, American ingenuity could and would provide
</p>
<p>for the protection of American property and honor ; but, as the
</p>
<p>Democrats had embraced the embargo and the non-intercourse
</p>
<p>policy as their own, a Democratic administration could not
</p>
<p>abandon it without loss of prestige. John Eandolph, of Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, made this presentment of the case :
</p>
<p>t " The history of that act (theEmbargo) was very extraordinary. When
</p>
<p>originally iatroduced, not a single person had pretended that, absolute-

</p>
<p>ly and by itself, it was a good measure. During the debate upon it it
</p>
<p>bad gained no friends, and yet it had passed by a two-thirds' vote.
</p>
<p>During the present session it had been reprobated by every body of all
</p>
<p>parties, in the House and out of it ; and yet, after a five months' session,
</p>
<p>it still remained on the statute-book ! And why ? Because as the ma-
</p>
<p>jority pretended, it could not be re2:)ealed without the abandonment of
</p>

</p>
<p>national honor ! An unwise, passionate and ill-informed majority had
</p>
<p>brought the nation into a Mse and ruinous position, and the national
</p>
<p>honor required us to stay there ! To give up this wretched Non-import-
</p>
<p>ation Act without some equally wretched substitute for it, would be, it
</p>
<p>was pretended, unconditional submission and irretrievable disgrace."
</p>
<p>Despite Congressional restrictions, English Orders and French
</p>
<p>Decrees, an extensive American commerce was afloat during
</p>
<p>the latter part of the year 1809  much of it suddenly launched
</p>
<p>for a market under the brief relief afforded by the temporary
</p>
<p>operation of the Erskine treaty. This commerce English offi-
</p>
<p>cers were instructed to respect under certain provisions ; but
</p>
<p>Buonaparte seized every vessel, indiscriminately, which fell in
</p>
<p>French hands, ao matter what her register or flag. Ail Amer-
</p>
<p>ican craft so seized were ordered to confiscation and sale. /'This
</p>
<p>outrageous conduct was defended with infinite audacity by the
</p>
<p>French Prime Minister, Duke of Cadore, as necessary, because
</p>
<p>the American Government had not yet taken measures against
</p>
<p>the unprovoked aggressions of England on the rights of neu-
</p>
<p>trals ! and because France, who had given no cause of offense,
</p>
<p>was included in the penalties of the non-intercourse act of
</p>
<p>1809 ! Our Minister to France, Armstrong, came forward with
</p>
<p>an able and high toned remonstrance against tyrannical confis-
</p>
<p>cation of a neutral's property, wherever found. He pointed
</p>
<p>out, with great directness, the inconsistency of Cadore's assump-
</p>
<p>tions in the matter. The only answer vouchsafed was the
</p>
<p>Rambouillet decree of March 23d, 1810, ordering the condem-
</p>
<p>nation and sale of one hundred and thirty- two American ves-
</p>
<p>sels, with their cargoes  in all valued at about eight millions
</p>
<p>of dollars ! Like confiscation .was to be visited upon any
</p>
<p>American vessel caught in any French port or ports held by
</p>
<p>French arms. Wrong, insult and disregard of maritime usage
</p>
<p>could not go farther. An immediate declaration of war against
</p>
<p>France would have been justified.

<p>But, not to dwell too closely upon the extraordinary circum-

<p>stances of our Euro}>ean relations in 1810 and 1811, we may

<p>ences with that power. That such a war was calculated im

</p>
<p>measurably to assist Buonaparte was not denied. Said JoLn
</p>
<p>Randolph, in his great speech delivered Dec. 11th, 1810, against
</p>
<p>the drift of the current towards a war with Great Britain :
</p>
<p>" And sliuU Rei^ublicans become the instruments of him who has su-
</p>
<p>perseded the title of Attila to be called the scourge of God ? If, instead
</p>
<p>of being as I am, my memory clouded, my intellect stupefied, my strength
</p>
<p>and spirits exhausted, I had the completest command of my faculties, I
</p>
<p>should still fail to give utterance to that strong detestation which I feel
</p>
<p>toward such characters as Genghis, Tamerlane, Kouli Khan and Buona-
</p>
<p>parte, malefactors of the human race, who grind down men into mere
</p>
<p>material of their impious and bloody ambition ! Yet, under all the ac-
</p>
<p>cumulated wrongs, and insults, and robberies of the last of these chief-
</p>
<p>tains, we are about to become a party to his views, a partner in his
</p>
<p>wars ! "
</p>
<p>But, it was of no avail. The point steadily kept in view by
</p>
<p>the popular leaders was_to secure a solidification of sentiment
</p>
<p>on the course adopted. \ Under the impetus of Southern and
</p>
<p>Western men, the Congressional attitude of war was assumed.
</p>
<p>During January, February, March, April, May and June, 1812,
</p>
<p>nothing was heard but preparations for a second measuring of
</p>
<p>strength with our old enemy, j The war spirit grew rapidly.
</p>
<p>As Brackenridge truthfully said : " the habits of a people, who
</p>
<p>had been thirty years at peace, and constantly occupied in in-
</p>
<p>dustrious callings could not be changed suddenly : but men
</p>
<p>are by nature warlike, and they cannot exist long in the midst
</p>
<p>of martial scenes without catching their spirit." This fact the
</p>
<p>leaders of the war party counted upon : by " precipitating" ac-
</p>
<p>tion they sought to render the popular voice unanimous. Leg-
</p>
<p>islation, however, was too reckless to escape animadversion. It
</p>
<p>soon became hasty, ill-considered and well calculated to arouse
</p>
<p>the still unawed opposition by its evidently partisan nature.
</p>
<p>New England sought for a navy, but it was denied. ,'' Extend
</p>
<p>give enlistments were ordered and heavy appropriations voted. !

</p>
<p>Yet no declaration of war was made. The hope of Madison
</p>
<p>was to force England to an accommodation  to compel her, by
</p>
<p>a show of retaliation, to do us justice, j To this end the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, in a confidential message to Congress, recommended an
</p>
<p>embargo, to continue in force for a term of sixty days, when,
</p>
<p>if no change was made in Britain's attitude, the declaration of
</p>
<p>JOHN henry's revelations. 341
</p>
<p>war must follow. The new Embargo as it finally passed
</p>
<p>(April 4th) fixed the time for ninety instead of sixty days. It
</p>
<p>prohibited the sailing of any vessel for any foreign port except
</p>
<p>foreign vessels with such cargoes as they had on board at the
</p>
<p>passage of the acts. The measure was sweepingly complete,
</p>
<p>chaining our commerce to the docks with an irreversible knot.
</p>
<p>Madison was measurably sustained in his course by capital
</p>
<p>made from the revelations of one John Henry, an Irishman,
</p>
<p>whose secret " mission" to Massachusetts in 1809 to stir up se-
</p>
<p>dition, he had, for a doceur of fifty thousand dollars, divulged
</p>
<p>to the President. This mercenary professed to have been dis-
</p>
<p>patched by the Governor-General of Canada, Sir James Craig,
</p>
<p>to Boston, early in 1809, to yatch the course of events, to aid
</p>
<p>in developing the spirit of discontent, to labor for the disrup-
</p>
<p>tion of the American Union and for the reannexation of New
</p>
<p>England to the Canadas ! The fellow, it afterwards appeared,
</p>
<p>was in Boston at the time indicated, a frequenter of brothels
</p>
<p>and a companion of disreputable characters generally ; but,
</p>
<p>with all his confessions, he implicated no one  designated no
</p>
<p>special person, act or movement calculated to add to the weight
</p>
<p>of testimony against the New England Federalists. For what
</p>
<p>the enormous sum of fifty thousand dollars was paid it is now
</p>
<p>difiicult to see. In his special message transmitting the dearly
</p>
<p>paid for revelation, the President assumed that Henry's evi-
</p>
<p>dence proved England to have been intriguing for the base
</p>
<p>purpose of exciting sedition, first essaying to*bring about an
</p>
<p>open resistance to the laws ; then, " by introducing a British
</p>
<p>force, to assist in destroying the Union and forming, with the
</p>
<p>Eastern section thereof, aconnection with Great Britain." This,
</p>
<p>for the moment, created renewed feeling of hostility against the
</p>
<p>English and their sympathisers in New England ; but, when
</p>
<p>the whole affair was probed by the New Englanders themselves,
</p>
<p>nothing was discovered which could implicate any American

</p>
<p>born citizen in Henry's professed designs ; and nothing was
</p>
<p>adduced to prove that stipendiary had told the truth. The
</p>
<p>general impression was, that the heavy sum paid for information
</p>
<p>was worse than wasted. It is well to state that Henry, having
</p>
<p>342 THE NEW ENGLAND DISCONTENTS.
</p>
<p>received his money, left tlie country for France hefore his affida-
</p>
<p>vits and papers were made public'
</p>
<p>It was necessary, as Madison then stood, to sustain the war
</p>
<p>policy vigorously or fail of a nomination for the Presidency.
</p>
<p>There was no alternative. That he was at heart against the
</p>
<p>war, admits of no question. He bent before the imperious de-
</p>
<p>mands of the Democratic caucus, led "by Henry Clay, and ac-
</p>
<p>cepted the nomination with its implied responsibilities to press
</p>
<p>the war programme to an immediate and unconditional issue.
</p>
<p>He then indicated his adhesion by proposing the embargo.
</p>
<p>This was followed by his confidential message of June 1st,
</p>
<p>1812, wherein were recited the causes of complaint against
</p>
<p>Great Britain ; "her impressments of our seamen; her infringe-
</p>
<p>ments upon our maritime jurisdiction, and disturbance of the
</p>
<p>peace of our coasts ; her paper blockades, unsupported by any
</p>
<p>adequate force ; her violations of our neutral rights by her or-
</p>
<p>ders in council, and her inflexible determination to maintain
</p>
<p>those orders against all appeals to her justice. Add to this
</p>
<p>her suspected instigation of Indian hostilities ; and her conduct,
</p>
<p>taken together, would be found to amount to war as against
</p>
<p>US, while we remained at peace with her. Under these cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, it became the duty of the House to consider, as it
</p>
<p>was their constitutional right to decide, whether we should
</p>
<p>longer remain passive under those progressive and accumulated
</p>
<p>wrongs. But, while thus leading the way to war, as if to
</p>
<p>guard against the charge of French influence, so much dwelt
</p>
<p>upon by the Federalists, a caution was added against entangle-
</p>
<p>ment 'in the contests and views of other powers.' France not
</p>
<p>* Too much has been made of this ' spy" by historians. One writes : " The
</p>
<p>fact remains that the British Government had been treacherously endeavoring to
</p>
<p>destroy the Union while professing friendship," &c. The " fact" remains that the
</p>
<p>British Government knew nothing whatever of the " spy's' ' operations, and refus-
</p>
<p>ed to pay him one cent for services rendered ; and that refusal induced Henry to

<p>turn informer. Nor is it true that the British Government then " professed friend-
</p>
<p>ship :" its Orders in Council show that it both professed and practiced anything
</p>
<p>but friendship for us. Whatever Sir James Craig may have done is not material.
</p>
<p>If ht hired a vagabond to do dirty work, and kept his " mission" a profound secret
</p>
<p>not only from the British Minister to this country, but even from the British Minis-
</p>
<p>try, we can see little propriety for affixing to the British Government any respon-
</p>
<p>Bibility in the matter.

<p>only refused all indemnity for former wrongs, but, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing ' tlie repeal of her decrees as they violated the neutral
</p>
<p>rights of the United States,' she still con tinned to authorize
</p>
<p>illegal captures of our ships, attended by the perpetration of
</p>
<p>other outrages. The recommendation, however, of any defini-
</p>
<p>tive measures with regard to her was deferred, in the expecta-
</p>
<p>tion that the result of the unclosed negotiation at Paris would
</p>
<p>speedily enable Congress to decide with greater advantage on
</p>
<p>the course due to the rights, interest and honor of the country."
</p>
<p>John Eandolph  who had struggled violently against the
</p>
<p>precipitation of hostilities and had, while disclaiming association
</p>
<p>with the New Engianders, co-operated with them in opposing
</p>
<p>the schemes of the hot -heads  moved to refer this message to
</p>
<p>the Committee of the Whole, but, as that would open it to a
</p>
<p>fierce struggle on the floor, the message was committed to the
</p>
<p>Committee on Foreign Eelations. ^is Committee, by its
</p>
<p>Chairman, John C. Calhoun, reported (June 3d) for war, at the
</p>
<p>same time introducing a bill declaring war. The struggle in
</p>
<p>the House over this well engineered bill was brief; the friends
</p>
<p>of the measure were too strong for much opposition. A mo-
</p>
<p>tion to include France in the declaration received ten votes !
</p>
<p>The vote for the bill stood 79 to 49. Its semi-sectional char-
</p>
<p>acter was apparent upon analyzation. Pennsylvania and the
</p>
<p>States to the South and West voted 62 aye, 17 nay. The States
</p>
<p>North of Pennsylvania voted 17 aye, 82 nay. Thirteen North-
</p>
<p>ern and two Southern Democrats voted nay. Many others
</p>
<p>who were opposed to war voted for the act purely for the rea-
</p>
<p>son that it was a "party measure." In the Senate, after vari-
</p>
<p>ous efforts to insert a clause authorising letters of marque and
</p>
<p>reprisal  to include French vessels in the clause  to substitute
</p>
<p>for the original bill such letters both against England and

<p>France, the bill was brought to a vote and passed 19 to 18  a

<p>June 18th.
</p>
<p>All this was done in secret session. The people, though
</p>
<p>informed by report of the probable result, awaited with intense

</p>
<p>partisans with favor, but otherwise by their opponents and the
</p>
<p>mercantile interest generally. Then, as at a later day, the
</p>
<p>great mass of foreign population walked their straight course
</p>
<p>to the ballot box with straight Democratic votes in their hanils.
</p>
<p>The foreign element then being composed largely of Irish who
</p>
<p>had fled from the tyranny of British rule, most eagerly en-
</p>
<p>couraged the idea of war with their oppressors. The old French
</p>
<p>faction, with its element of infidelity and love of revolution,
</p>
<p>suddenly revived at the clarion call, for, with them, Buona-
</p>
<p>parte, though an Emperor, still was the representative of inno-
</p>
<p>vation and war against the old order of things, and a war with
</p>
<p>England was to befriend him. There also was a new element
</p>
<p>abroad. The generation of Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun,
</p>
<p>Eichard M. Johnson, had arisen, with their ardor for public
</p>
<p>distinction, to stir up the land by their glowing rhetoric, and to
</p>
<p>call around them the young and fiery sons of revolutionary
</p>
<p>sires for a second stroke at the hereditary foe of their indepen-
</p>
<p>dency and prosperity. Against these stirring spirits, of foreign
</p>
<p>and domestic constitution, it was futile to struggle, particularly
</p>
<p>when the old leaders  De Witt Clinton, Jefferson, Gallatin,
</p>
<p>Giles, Gerry, Macon, Findley, Sevier, Dr. Mitchell  manipula-
</p>
<p>ted the reins. Opposition came not so much from Federalists
</p>
<p>as such, as from Northern industry and commerce whose inte-
</p>
<p>rests were to suffer, and from New England people whose ter-
</p>
<p>ritory, lying adjacent to the British frontier, would be assailed
</p>
<p>by land as well as by sea. ' The South, being purely agricul-
</p>
<p>tural in character, and having little to fear from English navies
</p>
<p>or armies of invasion, could not be a sufferer except to the ex-
</p>
<p>tent of the slight additional taxation necessary to sustain the
</p>
<p>finances.^ Hence war to the two sections was so differently
</p>
<p>* Jefferson wrote at a later day (Nov. 28th, 1814) of the effect which a state of

<p>war had produced on Virginia prosperity: " To me this state of things brings a
</p>
<p>sacrifice of all tranquillity and comfort through the residue of life. For, although

</p>
<p>viewed as to awaken the keenest and most bitter antago-
</p>
<p>nisms.
</p>
<p>Said the Federalist members of Congress, in an address to
</p>
<p>their constituents, issued at the close of the session (July 6) :
</p>
<p>"If honor demands a war with England, what opiate lulls that
</p>
<p>honor to sleep over the wrongs done us by France  on land,
</p>
<p>lobberies, seizures, imprisonments ; at sea, pillage, sinkings,
</p>
<p>burnings ? With full knowledge of the wrongs inflicted by
</p>
<p>the French, ought the Government of this country to aid the
</p>
<p>French cause by engaging in war against the enemies of France ?
</p>
<p>It cannot be concealed that to engage in the present war against
</p>
<p>England is to place ourselves on the side of France, and ex-
</p>
<p>poses UB to the vassalage of the States serving under the French
</p>
<p>Emperor."
</p>
<p>And this, indeed, was one of the sharpest thorns in the side
</p>
<p>of men of the old Federal school  men who transferred their
</p>
<p>detestation of Eobespierre, Danton and Voltaire to the Empe-
</p>
<p>ror who had emerged from that sea of blood around the guil-
</p>
<p>lotine to become the conqueror of a world : they could not be-
</p>
<p>come reconciled to the idea that free America was to contribute
</p>
<p>to his ascendancy. The clergy of New England, in particular,
</p>
<p>gave utterance to sentiments not well calculated to reconcile
</p>
<p>those of Puritan blood to the war.
</p>
<p>But, these symptoms of opposition did not stay the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion of the contest. With a few successes chiefly at sea, disas-
</p>
<p>ter visited our arms too humiliating to dwell upon, during the
</p>
<p>years 1812-13. Only the gleam of Perry's noble achievement
</p>
<p>and of Harrison's brilliant campaign in recovery of Detroit,
</p>
<p>came to permanently inspirit the people. In New England the
</p>
<p>war grew daily more unpopular. From its incipient stages
</p>
<p>such opposition had been manifested as gave the General Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment much anxiety. The quota (of the 100,000 men called

<p>for) to be furnished by the States of Massachusetts and Con-

<p>exigencies of tlie General Govcnunent gave the President au-
</p>
<p>thority to call out the militia. The Governors also took um-
</p>
<p>brage at tlie attempt to exclude their militia field officers from
</p>
<p>all command by orders for all militia to be mustered into the
</p>
<p>United States' service, when they would be commanded by the
</p>
<p>Major-Generals and Brigadiers of Madison's own creation. It
</p>
<p>was pronounced, by the Governors, unconstitutional for the
</p>
<p>President to delegate such authority over their militia. Both
</p>
<p>of these assumptions were defended by decisions of the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court of Massachusetts. As a consequence the New
</p>
<p>England States were left in a perfectly defenseless condition,
</p>
<p>save only as far as the local forces and the organized State mi -
</p>
<p>litia gave protection.

<p>I At the opening of the war our Government had signified its
</p>
<p>wish to negotiate for peace, and had instructed Eussell, charge
</p>
<p>d'affaires at Paris, to agree to an armistice as preliminary to
</p>
<p>an arrangement, on condition of a repeal of the Orders in Coun-
</p>
<p>cil, the discontinuance of impressments and the return of those
</p>
<p>impressed. Through one of the by-roads of diplomacy  illus-
</p>
<p>trating the devious ways of diplomats  the offensive Orders in
</p>
<p>Council were discovered to have been repealed since June 23d !
</p>
<p>There stood nothing, therefore, between our country and peace
</p>
<p>but the vexed question of impressments. The British Minis-
</p>
<p>try actually had sent directions, early in August, 1812, to Ad-
</p>
<p>miral Warren, to propose a discontinuance of hostilities on* the
</p>
<p>strength of the repeal of the offensive Orders. All of these
</p>
<p>things operated on the Massachusetts mind to heighten its
</p>
<p>feeling against- an Administration which refused to discontinue
</p>
<p>a war after such overtures had been given for peace. Julj' 15th
</p>
<p>the Legislature of that State agreed upon a "Remonstrance, in
</p>
<p>which they denounced the perseverance in war, after the repeal
</p>
<p>of the British orders, as improper and impolitic, from the dis-
</p>
<p>trust which it exhibited of the good faith of the English nation,

<p>giving color to the charge of co-operation with France, and

<p>thereby tending to arouse the whole British nation against us ;

</p>
<p>tion of impressment had. never been presented to Great Britain
</p>
<p>as one of peace and war, between which she might choose, and
</p>
<p>because, for aught that appeared, it was still possible to settle
</p>
<p>that question by negotiation.
</p>
<p>"It was the hope of protection to commerce which had in-
</p>
<p>duced the Northern people, who did not need the aid of the
</p>
<p>South for their defense, to surrender to the General Govern-
</p>
<p>ment so large a share of their sovereignty, and in agreeing to
</p>
<p>the slave representation, to yield to the South a political weight
</p>
<p>so UDdue. But, so far from protection, a bitter spirit of hos-
</p>
<p>tility to commerce had early evinced itself on the part of the
</p>
<p>central authority, ending, after a long course of harrassments,
</p>
<p>in its total destruction by war ; a war which appeared to be
</p>
<p>prompted rather by a subserviency to France most dangerous
</p>
<p>to our liberties, and by a lust of conquest, than by any dispo-
</p>
<p>sition to defend endangered rights : ill conducted, excessively
</p>
<p>expensive, and which, in risking our future enjoyment of the
</p>
<p>fisheries, the great nursery of our seamen, and means of sup-
</p>
<p>port to thousands of our inhabitants, of vastly more value than
</p>
<p>any Canadian territory we might be able to conquer, put us in
</p>
<p>jeopardy of losing what New England never could consent to
</p>
<p>abandon.
</p>
<p>" Under such circumstances silence toward the Government
</p>
<p>would be treachery to the people. In making this solemn rep-
</p>
<p>resentation of our sufferings and our dangers, we have been
</p>
<p>influenced only by the duty which we owe to our constituents
</p>
<p>and our country, to our consciences and the memory of our
</p>
<p>fathers. And to the Searcher of all hearts we appeal for the
</p>
<p>purity of our motives and the sincerity of our declarations ! "
</p>
<p>This was accompanied by a report from a committee, which
</p>
<p>complained of the admission of Louisiana without the unani-
</p>
<p>mous consent of the States, as unconstitutional and unauthor-
</p>
<p>ized ; and the admission was stigmatised, Hildreth says, as the

<p>threatened to swamp the political influence of Massachusetts

<p>Herein the reader has the real secret of the opposition which

</p>
<p>culminated in the Hartford Convention. The Embargo and
</p>
<p>Non-intercourse acts, and war with England to aid France,
</p>
<p>were excessively unpopular from pecuniary results ; but, in
</p>
<p>the demanded and conceded ascendancy of the South, in the
</p>
<p>reign of Virginia at the Capital ; in the offensive inequality of
</p>
<p>a Congressional representation on slaves ; in the apparent wil-
</p>
<p>lingness of the pastoral South to sacrifice and override the
</p>
<p>manufacturing and trading North, we have the true source of
</p>
<p>that uprising of the old Puritan element which convened in
</p>
<p>secret conclave at Hartford A, The spirit of Cotton Mather be-
</p>
<p>came even more apparent in the Senate resolutions, introduced
</p>
<p>by a committee of which Josiah Quincy was chairman, refusing
</p>
<p>to Captain Lawrence, afterwards of the ill-fated Chesapeake, a
</p>
<p>vote of thanks for his capture of the Peacoe\ believing  in the
</p>
<p>language of the resolution  " that in a war like the present,
</p>
<p>waged without justifiable cause, and prosecuted in a manner
</p>
<p>indicating that conquest and ambition were its real motives, it
</p>
<p>was not becoming a moral and religious people to express any
</p>
<p>approbation of military or naval exploits not directly connect-
</p>
<p>ed with the defense of our seacoast and soil." This outraged
</p>
<p>even New England bosoms, which ever had honored heroism
</p>
<p>and devotion to country. A worthy scion of the wealthy
</p>
<p>Crowningshield family, procuring a flag of truce, proceeded to
</p>
<p>Halifax and returned with the body of Lawrence, which was

<p>The Legislatures of other States out of New England sus-

<p>and funds. But, not an army put in the field was equal to the
</p>
<p>work assigned it ; not a campaign was prosecuted with means
</p>
<p>adapted to ends. Throughout the entire field of operations on

<p>tency of the War Department and demoralization of the troops.
</p>
<p>It was distressingly evident that, however just the war might
</p>
<p>be, it was not popular, else volunteers would have flocked to
</p>
<p>their country's standard and the General Government would
</p>
<p>have been sustained with ample means. If it is asserted that

</p>
<p>New England's disaffection and refusal to fill lier quotas for
</p>
<p>oflensive operations brought this weakness to the army  that
</p>
<p>her discredit of Government stocks and bonds was fatal to the
</p>
<p>financial success of the National exchequer  it is to confess
</p>
<p>the preponderating importance of that section : if its sympathy
</p>
<p>and co-operation were so necessary to the success of the war
</p>
<p>why, it pertinently may be asked, were not her wishes and her
</p>
<p>influence consulted in levying the Embargo and in declaring
</p>
<p>war? ^
</p>
<p>During 1813 the Yermont Federalists so far gained in strength
</p>
<p>as to throw the election for Governor into the Legislature,
</p>
<p>which, being Federal, elected (Nov. 6th) Martin Chittenden to
</p>
<p>the Chief Magistracy of the State. He was no sooner in office
</p>
<p>than he issued a proclamation recalling from the United States'
</p>
<p>service a brigade of Vermont militia then thrown into Bur-
</p>
<p>* The first siieecli made by Daniel Webstei-, delivered ia the House of Represent-
</p>
<p>atives, January 14th, 1814, contained this passage :
</p>
<p>" It waS'not, Sir, the minority that brought on this war. Look to your records,
</p>
<p>fror'.i the date of the Embargo in 1807 to June, 1812. Every thing that men could
</p>
<p>do they did, to stay your course. When at last they could effect no more they
</p>
<p>urged you to delay your measures. They entreated you to give yet a little time
</p>
<p>for deliberation, and to wait for favorable events. As if inspired for the purpose
</p>
<p>of arresting your progress, they laid before you the consequences of your measures
</p>
<p>just as we have seen them since take place. They predicted to you their effects
</p>
<p>on public opinion. They told you, that, instead of healing, they would inflame
</p>
<p>political dissentions. They pointed out to you what would and what must happen
</p>
<p>on the frontier. That which since has happened there, is but their prediction
</p>
<p>turued into history. Vain is the hope, then, of escaping just retribution by imput-
</p>
<p>ing to the minority of the Government, or to the opposition among the people, the
</p>
<p>disasters of these times. * * If the purpose be by casting these implications
</p>
<p>upon those who are opposed to the policy of the Government, to check their free-
</p>
<p>dom of inquiry, discussion and debate, such purpose is also incapable of being ex-
</p>
<p>ecuted. That opposition is constitutional and legal. It is also conscientious. It

<p>rests in settled and sober conviction that such policy is destructive to the iuterestti
</p>
<p>of the people and dangerous to the being of the Government. The experience of
</p>
<p>every day confirms these sentiments. Meu who act from such motives are not to
</p>
<p>be discouraged by trifling obstacles nor awed by any dangers. They know the limit
</p>
<p>of constitutional oppodlion  up to that limit at their own discretion they toill walk, and tcalk
</p>
<p>fearlessly."
</p>
<p>This speech fell from the speaker's lips in an unimpassioned utterance, but its
</p>
<p>words were trip-hammer blows to the war policy. It was patriotic throughout,
</p>
<p>characterized, as all of Webster's speeches afterwards were, by thorough devotion
</p>
<p>to the nation; but it was a most powerful defense of New England policy. Web-

<p>lington to sustain Hampton's and Wilkinson's movement upon
</p>
<p>Montreal. This recall was based upon the "illegality" of the
</p>
<p>requisition for militia service the Governor denying the ex-
</p>
<p>istence of any of the three contingencies provided for in tlie
</p>
<p>Constitution. : But the troops proved more patriotic than their
</p>
<p>Governor ; the officer bearing Chittenden's mandate was ar-
</p>
<p>rested by the brigade officers on charge of sedition. The expe-
</p>
<p>dition against Canada, however, having proved abortive through
</p>
<p>the incompetency of its directors, was abandoned, and the mi-
</p>
<p>litia were discharged their terra of service having nearly ex-
</p>
<p>pired. I This act of the Vermont Governor aroused the autho-
</p>
<p>rities at Washington. It was moved in the House of Eepre-
</p>
<p>sontatives (Jan. 6th, 1814) to instruct the Attorn e}^- General to
</p>
<p>prosecute Chittenden.^ In answer to this Harrison Gray Otis,
</p>
<p>in the Massachusetts Senate, Jan. 14th, introduced a resolve,
</p>
<p>expressing the duty and readiness of the State " to aid with
</p>
<p>her whole power, the Governor of Yermont, and the people of
</p>
<p>that or any other State in support of constitutional rights, by
</p>
<p>whomsoever infringed"4 a resolution, which, though after-
</p>
<p>wards pointed at as revolutionary, but re-echoed the senti-
</p>
<p>ments which Daniel Webster uttered on that same day in tlie
</p>
<p>U. S. House of Eepresentatives. Those who most loudly de-
</p>
<p>nounced the resolutions as treasonable were the vehement sup-
</p>
<p>porters of the resolutions of "98 ! As the sole purpose and
</p>
<p>effect of those resolves were to exalt the State above the Na-
</p>
<p>tional Government it certainly was not becoming men of Jeff-
</p>
<p>erson's and Calhoun's principles to complain at the Massachu-
</p>
<p>setts enforcement of their doctrines. The}^ preached  Massa-
</p>
<p>chusetts practiced.
</p>
<p>The proceedings of Congress  which assembled Dec. 6th,
</p>
<p>1813  were calculated to inflame anew the fires glowing on
</p>
<p>the Northern hills, or slumbering in their vallies. Madison,

<p>and severity to the evasions of the Non-intercourse prohibitions,
</p>
<p>asserting that not only were the enemy's fleets supplied with
</p>
<p>provisions, but the importation of British goods continued
</p>
<p>through the process of smuggling and by the practice of ran-
</p>
<p>soming, by which collusive captures were made, and whole

</p>
<p>cargoes of foreign goods thrown upon our markets. To reme-
</p>
<p>dy these evasions he proposed that an " effectual embargo'' on
</p>
<p>exports be immediately enacted ; that all ransoms be prohibit-
</p>
<p>ed ; and that, to claim the rights of a neutral, the master, su-
</p>
<p>percai-go, and at least three-fourths of the crew be actual sub-
</p>
<p>jects of the alleged neutral power. To meet'these suggestions
</p>
<p>a bill was matured and forced through in secret session (Dec.
</p>
<p>19th) which, if it did not answer all the expectations of the
</p>
<p>President, produced still further exasperation of mind in New
</p>
<p>England. Even the fishing-smacks were put under heavy
</p>
<p>bonds, while a most arbitrary authority or discretion was given
</p>
<p>to Custom House officials, as well as to cruisers and privateers,
</p>
<p>to overhaul any vessel, and to seize, upon mere suspicion, any
</p>
<p>goods " apparently on their way (by land or water) toward the
</p>
<p>territory of a foreign nation, or to the vicinity thereof" The
</p>
<p>next edict, it was said, might be one to search private houses
</p>
<p>in order to discover if goods of British fabric were there in
</p>
<p>UoC.
</p>
<p>A gleam of peace came to relieve the public anxiety some-
</p>
<p>^vhat. 'lHussia had, upon three occasions, during the summer
</p>
<p>of 1813, oftered her services as mediator; but Great Britain
</p>
<p>had rejected the Czar's offices, thus adding to the war spirit
</p>
<p>against her. But/early in January, a vessel reached our shores
</p>
<p>bearing the important news of Napoleon's defeat at LeipsicJand
</p>
<p>of tlie advance of Wellington into France. Accompanying
</p>
<p>this news came offers from the British government to treat di-
</p>
<p>rectly with our Government, either in London or in Gotten-
</p>
<p>burg. This offer gave to the opponents of the war fresh cour-
</p>
<p>age. Madison gladly accepted the overture, and named (Jan.
</p>
<p>14th) as Commissioner John Quincy Adams, then Minister to
</p>
<p>Eussia, and James A. Baj'^ard, of Delaware, whose ca'sting vote,
</p>
<p>in the celebrated seven days' ballot, gave Jefferson the Presi-
</p>
<p>dency. To these were added, "as special representatives of

<p>the War party," Henry Clay and Jonathan Russell. Their
</p>
<p>instructions soon were perfected, and the two last named sailed
</p>
<p>,i-om New York, Feb. 23d. Albert Gallatin, who was then

<p>abroad, also was added to the Commission.

</p>
<p>/faction. It grew steadily. As it grew, hatred of the New^
</p>
<p>lEiiglanders increased. In view of Otis' resolves several State
</p>
<p>Legislatures gave utterance to their indignation at the attitude
</p>
<p>assumed by Massachusetts. Pennsylvania (Jan. 18th) express-
</p>
<p>ed astonishment at Crittenden's proclamation and Otis' resolu-
</p>
<p>tions, tendering, at the same time, aid to the General Govern-
</p>
<p>ment " to bring to justice all violators of the Constitution and
</p>
<p>the law, and all aiders and comforters of the enemy, whether
</p>
<p>directly or indirectly." New Jerseymen talked even more
</p>
<p>menacingly. The Legislature (Feb. 12th) expressed "their
</p>
<p>contempt and abhorrence of the roarings of an infuriated fac-
</p>
<p>tion, whether issuing from a legislative body, a maniac govern-
</p>
<p>or, or discontented and ambitious demagogues," declaring their
</p>
<p>readiness "to resist internal insurrection with the same readi-
</p>
<p>ness as the invasion of a cruel, vindictive and savage foe."
</p>
<p>Despite these sounding anathemas the New England men pur-
</p>
<p>sued their opposition unflinchingly. A large number of Brit-
</p>
<p>ish officers and privates having been committed to prison, by
</p>
<p>order of the President, in retaliation for the imprisonment of
</p>
<p>Americans, by the British Governor-General of Canada, several
</p>
<p>officers were consigned to the Worcester jail under an old act
</p>
<p>(1790) which placed the jails at the service of the United States.
</p>
<p>The Legislature promptly repealed the act (Feb. 7th, 1814) so
</p>
<p>far as related to prisoners of the United States' authorities other
</p>
<p>than of the judiciary, ordering all prisoners committed under
</p>
<p>the Executive authority of the United States to be dismissed
</p>
<p>within thirty days. This gave time for the General Govern-
</p>
<p>ment to remove its charges, though a general release on parole
</p>
<p>of prisoners soon followed.
</p>
<p>The press and the pulpit did not follow the public sentiment
</p>
<p>but led it, in many respects. In the Boston Gazette, and the
</p>
<p>Advertiser, as well as in a number of the interior newspapers,
</p>
<p>the extremists found "organs" noisy enough  all clamorous

</p>
<p>for a direct issue to be made with the General Government as
</p>
<p>well as for a separate peace with Great Britain. In the pulpit
</p>
<p>were found many men so strongly imbued with old Puritanic
</p>
<p>notions of the rights of conscience and liberty of action as to
</p>
<p>talk most rank treason  so rank that Jefferson, in his " Ana,"

</p>
<p>rather roughly writes of the "pulpit-lyings and slanderings and
</p>
<p>maniacal ravings of their Gardiners, their Osgoods and their
</p>
<p>Parishes." This latter D. D., a minister of Byfield, made him-
</p>
<p>self especially cons]oicuous for his exhortations to arm against
</p>
<p>the Egyptian (the Administration).
</p>
<p>Nor, should the financiers be left unnoticed in this arraign-
</p>
<p>ment of sinners against the integrity of the Eepublic  for, of
</p>
<p>sinners, they were the most materially dangerous, having great-
</p>
<p>ly assisted in bringing the finances of the country to the verge
</p>
<p>of bankruptcy. They made a combined assault upon the pub-
</p>
<p>lic credit. Boston, as the grand entrepot of smugglers, was
</p>
<p>further rendered the centre of trade by British policy, which,
</p>
<p>until the Summer of 1814, left the New England coast free
</p>
<p>from blockade ! This exception doubtless was to encourage
</p>
<p>indirectl}^ the spirit of friendship which the opposition party
</p>
<p>were supposed to entertain for Great Britain, as well as to ob-
</p>
<p>tain supplies by the coasting trade, which freely bore flour and
</p>
<p>meat to Eastport and Halifax, until cut off by the severe act
</p>
<p>of Dec. 19th, 1813. The city was further enriched by the dis-
</p>
<p>position there of "ransomed" cargoes and prizes, by which
</p>
<p>great quantities of foreign goods found their way to an Ameri-
</p>
<p>can market. All these circumstances combined to render Bos-
</p>
<p>ton a port of supply for other cities. Soon New York, Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia, Baltimore and even Eichmond and Charleston became
</p>
<p>he.'ivy debtors, on the trade lists. Thus the tide of exchange
</p>
<p>sat Northward. Ere long the New England brokers, in spite
</p>
<p>of the general prostration of New England commerce, held the
</p>
<p>finances of the country in their control. The passage of the
</p>
<p>act of Dec. 19th, while it quite cut off the lucrative contraband
</p>
<p>t]*ade of Boston, found the Middle and Southern States greatly
</p>
<p>New England's debtor ; and the Yankee capitalists resolved
</p>
<p>to retaliate for the act by striking a blow at the finances. To
</p>
<p>this end they first sought to prevent the taking of the loan au-

<p>thorised March 14th, 1814; but, the banks of the 'Democratic'
</p>
<p>States, and the capitalists of their cities, in order to sustain the
</p>
<p>National credit subscribed to the twenty-five million loan to a
</p>
<p>considerable amount. Many men in New England and a few
</p>
<p>of the banks also contributed to it, and the loan bid fair to be

</p>
<p>a success. Tlie Boston inns then decided to call in tlieii loans
</p>
<p>and credits and to send home for redemption all bills, accept-
</p>
<p>ances, &c., which they held of cities and individuals to the
</p>
<p>South. Thej acted in concert, first drawing on New York.
</p>
<p>That city, to meet the sudden demand, drew heavil}^ on Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia ; Philadelphia, in turn, upon Baltimore. Thus the
</p>
<p>chain ran through the country ; to the smallest merchant it
</p>
<p>was a demand at sight to pay up all dues. A panic followed
</p>
<p>which quickly deranged the credit and the confidence of the
</p>
<p>entire country. A steady current of specie slowly flowed
</p>
<p>North, to find its way into New England vaults, alreadj^ full.
</p>
<p>That such was their condition the statement of the previous
</p>
<p>January proved. The annual returns of the leading banks then
</p>
<p>stood : specie $4,945,444 ; notes in circulation $2,000,601 "a

<p>in the history of banking, from the days of the Lombards."
</p>
<p>This monetary crisis wrought the end designed. Banks and
</p>
<p>individuals subscribing to the loan could not comply with their
</p>
<p>engagements. Many, still able to carry out their voluntary
</p>
<p>obligations, refused to do so, not knowing what calamities the
</p>
<p>future held in store. A financial collapse was predicted and
</p>
<p>every body kept 'close in shore,' for fear of disaster. Banks
</p>
<p>throughout the Middle and Southern States were compelled to
</p>
<p>suspend specie payments, during the latter part of August, but
</p>
<p>not until Bosion coffers were full to repletion. Then followed
</p>
<p>a rapid depreciation of bank paper. The best New York notes
</p>
<p>were quoted at 20 per cent, Philadelphia, 24 per cent, and
</p>
<p>Baltimore at 30 per cent discount, by February, 1815 ; while
</p>
<p>U. S. Treasury six per cents stood at 40 per cent discount,
</p>
<p>and Treasury Notes at 24 per cent Minor banks quite gene-
</p>
<p>rally sank into bankruptcy.
</p>
<p>The result of all this was to bring the National finances into
</p>
<p>the perils of bankruptcy. In September the new Secretar}^ of

<p>the Treasury, Campbell  appointed in place of Gallatin, placed
</p>
<p>on the Peace Commission  made an exhibit which proved the
</p>
<p>impending disaster to be near if something was not done to
</p>
<p>recuperate the funds. The attempt to secure six millions of
</p>
<p>the authorised loan resulted in offers for only about one-half
</p>
<p>PLAN FOR A NATIONAL BANK. 855
</p>
<p>that sum at about 80 per cent. At this ruinous rate tlie Sec-
</p>
<p>retary was compelled to sell. To obtain $2,500,000, stocks
</p>
<p>were issued to the amount of $4,266,000. Eight millions of
</p>
<p>treasury notes were offered, one half of which would fall due
</p>
<p>during the next quarter. Other obligations rendered it neces-
</p>
<p>sary to secure twenty-five millions, yet, combiuing every re-
</p>
<p>source of the Treasurer, but nine millions were to be estimated
</p>
<p>as secure. The revenues already provided were greatly too
</p>
<p>small for the demands. New schemes of taxation were devised
</p>
<p>by Alexander Dallas, of Pennsylvania, who quickly took
</p>
<p>Campbell's place, to attempt what all despaired of accomplish-
</p>
<p>ing  the sustentation of the National credit. Notwithstanding
</p>
<p>his old anti-bank affinities, and the intense opposition of his
</p>
<p>"Democratic Societies" to Hamilton and his schemes of Na-
</p>
<p>tional finance, Dallas came forward with a plan for a National
</p>
<p>Bank, with a capital of fifty millions  five in specie and the
</p>
<p>rest in Government Stocks  thus to provide a circulating me-
</p>
<p>dium and to obtain an immediate use of loans. This proposi-
</p>
<p>tion  so utterly at variance with all ' Democratic' precedents 
</p>
<p>possessed few virtues with many vices. It authorised Govern-
</p>
<p>ment to become a two- fifths' stockholder, in virtue of which it
</p>
<p>was to have the appointment of the President and one-third of
</p>
<p>the Directors  the Directory to be invested with power to sus-
</p>
<p>pend specie payment, and the bank to loan Government thirty
</p>
<p>millions of dollars. This "wild cat" enterprise greatly dis-
</p>
<p>pleased old Eepublicans and Federalists alike, but, the pressure
</p>
<p>of the war party and of the Administration prevailed, and, after
</p>
<p>considerable opposition, bills were introduced (Oct. 21st) to
</p>
<p>cover Dallas' suggestions.
</p>
<p>It is not to be inferred that the New England bankers
</p>
<p>brought all this train of monetary disaster. The great expan-
</p>
<p>sion of credit, consequent on a state of war and of commercial
</p>
<p>inactivity, must have produced a financial crisis sooner or later :

<p>the bankers of the North only hastened an inevitable result of
</p>
<p>carrying on a war on loans  Gallatin's idea. Gallatin, as the
</p>
<p>successor of Alexander Hamilton, was the embodiment of a
</p>
<p>' Democratic' financier ; and his failure, as well as the adoption,
</p>
<p>by Dallas, of the banking resource, did not fail to render the

</p>
<p>contrast with Hamilton's management painful. The New Eng-
</p>
<p>land men, strong in resources, had they been so inclined, would
</p>
<p>have carried the loans along triumphantly ; but, they were not
</p>
<p>so inclined, and threw upon the Administration all responsi-
</p>
<p>bility of meeting the exigency which it had created.
</p>
<p>^ An immense number of petitions for redress, protection, ac-
</p>
<p>tion against and defiance of the embargo had been sent into the
</p>
<p>Massachusetts Legislature from officers of sailing craft, from
</p>
<p>ship owners, from manufacturers, traders and citizens general-
</p>
<p>ly. All these were referred to a joint committee of the two
</p>
<p>houses, which reported, Feb. 16th, (1814). This document at
</p>
<p>some length reiterated, from former reports, the oppressive and
</p>
<p>destructive policy of the Government, but superadded views
</p>
<p>clearly looking either to a defiance of the Government or to a
</p>
<p>dissolution of the Union. ] Among other paragraphs it rang in
</p>
<p>the President's ears this chime to his Yirginia resolves :
</p>
<p>" A power to regulate commerce is abused when employed to destroy
</p>
<p>it, and a voluntary abuse of power sanctions the right of resistance as
</p>
<p>much as a direct and palj^able usurpation. The sovereignty reserved
</p>
<p>to the States was reserved to protect the citizens from acts of violence
</p>
<p>by the United States, as well as for purposes of domestic regulation.
</p>
<p>We spurn the idea that the free, sovereign and independent State of
</p>
<p>Massachusetts is reduced to a mere municipal corporation, without pow-
</p>
<p>er to protect its people, or to defend them from ojipression, from what-
</p>
<p>ever quarter it comes. Whenever the National compact is violated, and
</p>
<p>the citizens of this State oppressed by cruel and unauthorized enact-
</p>
<p>ments, this Legislature is bound to interpose its power and to wrest
</p>
<p>from the oppressor his victim. This is the spirit of our Union, and
</p>
<p>thus has it been explained by the very man who now sets at defiance
</p>
<p>all the principles of his early political life. The question, then, is not
</p>
<p>a question of power or right, but of time and expediency."

<p>similar to his former communications  advice to acquiesce in
</p>
<p>the state of things only so far as necessary to a bare fulfillment
</p>
<p>of Constitutional obligations. This speech the two houses en-

</p>
<p>chusetts maintained their reputation for good order by submit-
</p>
<p>ting to the Constitutional right of Congress to declare war and

<p>to levy taxes to carry it on, that this submission resulted either

<p>from ignorance incapable of discerning, or from pusillanimity

<p>not ready to assert their essential rights, shoiild any such be at

<p>No action was taken on the joint report of the previous ses-

</p>
<p>might be appointed by other Legislatures for holding an ante-

<p>this delay to meet the "demands of the hour" were that Madi-

<p>had been forced to abdicate, and that a general peace must soon

<p>evidence that they were designed as measures to aid France

</p>
<p>was not, however ready to take the responsibility of this repeal

<p>so long as the fate of negotiations then progressing in Holland

<p>were undecided, and the matter was passed over to the next

<p>session, when, Webster insinuated, the New England manu-

<p>facturers (which had suddenly sprung into existence during

<p>the operation of the restrictive non-importation system) would
</p>
<p>be sacrificed and the merchant and shipping interest already
</p>
<p>had been  so distrustful was he of the ammus of ' Democratic'
</p>
<p>legislation.
</p>
<p>But, the disaster and gloom of the Summer and Fall of 1814,
</p>
<p>drove States into the field for self- protection. Government
</p>
<p>was powerless to give the frontier and seaboard the least secu-
</p>
<p>rity. Governors and Legislatures had to take upon them'feelves
</p>
<p>the duties of defense. /''^ Not only had the first ideas of the war
</p>
<p>partisans been abandoned  the conquest of Canada  but, even
</p>
<p>the programme of a defensive war was committed, in a great
</p>
<p>measure, to the States ! Governor Strong, of Massachusetts,
</p>
<p>called ten thousand militia to the field, and the Legislature ap-
</p>
<p>propriated to the military chest one million of dollars. New
</p>
<p>York, Virginia and other States also called out their State
</p>
<p>forces, and contributed their funds. But, in New England the
</p>
<p>militia were denied to the General Government  the Govern-
</p>
<p>ors refused to permit any other command and jurisdiction than
</p>
<p>their own.^ This attitude was definitively taken in consequence
</p>
<p>of the refusal (Sept. 17th) by the Secretary of War (Munroe),
</p>
<p>to allow claims for the heavy expenses of defending New Eng-
</p>
<p>land already incurred by the Governors. /This repudiation was
</p>
<p>based upon the refusal of the Governors to respond to the War

<p>to those actually in service.
</p>
<p>This conflict of authority only strengthened the opposition
</p>
<p>element in the Legislatures. Once more the idea of a Conven-
</p>
<p>tion of New England States was revived. ' Washington City
</p>
<p>had been invaded, Aug. 24th, 2oth, and its chief public build-
</p>
<p>ings burned, with all their precious contents. British fleeH:
</p>
<p>were sweeping the coasts with almost unopposed fury. The
</p>
<p>Peace Commission, then assembled at Ghent, made no progres^s
</p>
<p>toward a settlement. ) England, having broken and banished
</p>
<p>Buonaparte, was free to throw all her tremendous armamen
</p>
<p>upon the country. Commercial and financial disaster starci
</p>
<p>the Union in the face like a grim spectre. / The ruin predicted
</p>
<p>by the New England opponents of the war policy had more
</p>
<p>than been realized the results of what was considered a
</p>
<p>Southern rule were painfully visible in the still smoking em-
</p>
<p>bers of the National Capital. . Yet, the party in power propos-
</p>
<p>ed no modification of their system of "whipping" Great Britain
</p>
<p>into a peace. The inefficiency of the General Government
</p>
<p>com23ared with its demand for new sacrifices aroused the "blue
</p>
<p>light Federalists" ' to new zeal in compelling a total change of
</p>
<p>the Governmental policy, or in effecting a separate peace with
</p>
<p>England.
</p>
<p>We now reach the proceedings directly preliminary to tha
</p>
<p>Hartford Convention.] Harrison Gray Otis, as chairman of a
</p>
<p>joint committee of the Legislature, reported, Oct. 8th, that, in
</p>
<p>ihe position in which Massachusetts then stood, " no choice
</p>
<p>was left her between submission to the enemy, which was not
</p>
<p>to be thought of, and the appropriation to her own defense of
</p>
<p>those revenues derived from her people, but which the Gene-
</p>
<p>* The only National vessels of war fit for service were blockaded in various
</p>
<p>ports, by the vigilant enemy, and could not put to sea. Decatur's two frigates

<p>out duriug the night, or during a storm ; but, blue lights were burned on the hills
</p>
<p>on every attempt, and thus the enemy was placed on the alert. Decatur, in a
</p>
<p>letter to the Secretary of the Navy expressed great indignation at this treasonable
</p>
<p>interference with his plans. It is not, however, proven that the enemy actually
</p>
<p>were signalled by shore lights burned by the Connecticut men. The inference is a

<p>fair one that English spies and signal squads did the work.

</p>
<p>ral Government Lad hitherto thought proper to expend else-
</p>
<p>where." The report then recurred to the Convention of Dele-
</p>
<p>gates suggested by the Spring session. /The reasons for this
</p>
<p>Convention were thus given in abstract r'^
</p>
<p>" The idea of a convention of the discontented States was also reviv-
</p>
<p>ed. The Constitution of the United States, under the administration of
</p>
<p>those now in power, had failed, so this report stated, to secure to Mas-
</p>
<p>sachusetts, and to New England generally, those equal rights and bene-
</p>
<p>fits, the great objects of its formation, and which could not be relin-
</p>
<p>quished without ruin. The method of procuring amendments, the
</p>
<p>probable necessity for which had been foreseen, provided for in the
</p>
<p>Constitution itself, was too slow of operation for the present crisis. The
</p>
<p>safety of the peoj^le  the supreme law  would well justify, in the 2)re:-ent
</p>
<p>emergency, the holding of a new convention to modify or amend it.
</p>
<p>Nor was the expectation presumptuous that a spirit of equity and jus-
</p>
<p>tice, enlightened by experience, would enable such a convention to re-
</p>
<p>concile conflicting interests, and, by obviating the principal cause of
</p>
<p>those dissensions, which unfitted the Government alike for a state of
</p>
<p>peace and of war, to give to the Union vigor and duration.
</p>
<p>" But as such a proposition, coming from a single State, might be
</p>
<p>disregarded, and as j^resent dangers admitted of no delay, the
</p>
<p>committee recommended, in the first instance, the inviting of ' a con-
</p>
<p>ference between those States, the affinity of whose interests is closest,
</p>
<p>and whose habits of intercourse, from local and other causes,
</p>
<p>are most frequent, to the end that, by a comparison of their sentiments
</p>
<p>and views, some mode of defense suited to the circumstances and exi-
</p>
<p>gencies of those States, and measures for accelerating the return of pub-
</p>
<p>lic prosperity, may be devised ; and also to enable the delegates from
</p>
<p>those States, should they deem it expedient, to lay the foundation of a
</p>
<p>radical reform in the National compact, by inviting to a future conven-
</p>
<p>tion a deputation from all the States in the Union.'
</p>
<p>" The amendment of the Constitution principally insisted upon was a
</p>
<p>new basis of representation. The present basis, counting three-fifths of

</p>
<p>States were more wealthy than the free States, "and ought, on that ac-
</p>
<p>count, to have a greater representation in projsortion to the number of
</p>
<p>citizens. This supposition of superior wealth was, however, a mistake
</p>
<p>in fact. Had representation been based either upon property, or num-
</p>
<p>ber of free inhabitants, or upon any uniform combination of both, this
</p>
<p>war, forced by the poor slaveholding agricultural States upon the rich,
</p>
<p>free, commercial States, would never have been declared."

<p>This circular was referred to a special committee, which ac-

<p>companied its endorsement by a report drawn with great force

<p>and ability, in which were set forth the excuses for the Conven-

<p>tion, and intimated the sphere of its functions. | This document,
</p>
<p>thus doubly ladened with authority, was dispatched to the
</p>
<p>several North-eastern States. The Legislatures of Connecticut
</p>
<p>and Rhode Island acted at once  the first appointing seven

<p>delegates and naming the 15th day of December as the time
</p>
<p>and Hartford as the place of the session. ) These seven were
</p>
<p>among the best and most influential men of the State. Rhode
</p>
<p>Island, by a vote of two to one, appointed four delegates.
</p>
<p>Vermont and New Hampshire did not appoint  the Adminis-
</p>
<p>tration party being too strong in both States. Two delegates
</p>
<p>from the latter, and one from the former, were, however, infor-
</p>
<p>mally appointed by the people.

<p>There followed, from Boston to New Orleans, such an out-

<p>burst of patriotic indignation, particularly from Administration
</p>

<p>Farewell Address always had been a Gospel of Faith to them

<p>as if the resolutions of '98 were not of ' Democratic' birth and
</p>
<p>the prime principles of the ' Democratic' creed ! Many good

</p>
<p>that we can, at any moment, make peace with England at the expense

<p>of the navigation and fisheries of Massachusetts." But, it will not come
</p>
<p>to this. Their own people will put down these factionists as soon aa
</p>
<p>they see the real object of their opposition; and of this Vermont, New
</p>
<p>Hampshire, and even Connecticut itself furnish proofs."
</p>
<p>Views wliicli events soon confirmed : " their own people"
</p>
<p>did put down the entire movement more completely than an
</p>
<p>army could have done. Madison did not entertain this happy
</p>
<p>opinion. Timid by nature, distrustful of the patriotism of the
</p>
<p>people, he apprehended the worst results from New England's
</p>
<p>procedure. Wirt has left us a distressing picture of Madison's
</p>
<p>mental condition at that time. He was tasting the fruits of
</p>
<p>the tree which he himself had planted : he was experiencing
</p>
<p>the practical application of his State supremacy faith.
</p>
<p>The Convention of twenty-six delegates  including two from
</p>
<p>New Hampshire and one from Vermont  assembled at Hartford
</p>
<p>at the appointed time (Dec. 15th). j It organized by the elec-
</p>
<p>tion of George Cabot, of Massachusetts, as President, and The-
</p>
<p>odore Dwight, of Connecticut, as Secretary. '' No excitement
</p>
<p>whatever, attended its proceedings. ] Madison had on the ground
</p>
<p>Major Jessup, nominally for recruiting, but really to watch the
</p>
<p>course of affairs, and, in event of an uprising to be ready, with
</p>
<p>the help of Governor Tompkins, the patriotic Executive of
</p>
<p>New York, to strike down insurrection at a blow. The young
</p>
<p>officer, both zealous and discreet, was not long in reaching the
</p>
<p>conclusion that the Convention was a harmless affair which
</p>
<p>would end in resolutions and remonstrances  not in revolu-
</p>
<p>tion. I So he advised the Government. The idea probably

</p>
<p>of the feeling which prevailed in Virginia and the South, at that time, against New

<p>times.

<p>liad emergencies required, it certainly would have been used tn perrmnently cripple

<p>her navigation and fisheries. It was the very pmcer to do her injury of which New
</p>
<p>England chiefly complained. Jefferson, it will be seen, not only admitted that
</p>
<p>strength of ' we," the ascendant Virginia party, but did not hesitate to show how,

<p>by a disgraceful peace  by surrendering New England to British commercial su-

<p>The Convention sat with closed doors, for twenty days, ad-
</p>
<p>journing Jan. 5th, when the results became partially known in
</p>
<p>the publication of a report, directed to the Legislatures of the
</p>
<p>States represented. The entire proceedings were not, howev-
</p>
<p>er, divulged until five years had passed,)when the President
</p>
<p>of the Convention, to satisfy the public of its actual character,
</p>
<p>placed the Journal of Proceedings in the office of the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of State of Massachusetts, for public inspection. From it
</p>
<p>we learn that a committee, appointed to consider " what sub-
</p>
<p>jects will be proper to be considered by the Convention," re-
</p>
<p>ported the topics proper for consideration as follows :
</p>
<p>" The powers claimed by the Executive of the United States to deter-
</p>
<p>mine, conclusively, in respect to calling out the militia of the States into
</p>
<p>the service of the United States ; and the dividing the United States
</p>
<p>into military districts, with an officer of the army in each thereof, with
</p>
<p>discretionary authority from the Executive of the United States to call
</p>
<p>for the militia to be under the command of such officer : the refusal of
</p>
<p>the Executive of the United States to supply or pay the militia of cer-
</p>
<p>tain States called out for their defense, on the grounds of their not hav-
</p>
<p>ing been called out under the authority of the United States, or not
</p>
<p>having been, by the Executive of the State, put under the command of
</p>
<p>the commander over the military district : the failure of the Government
</p>
<p>of the United States to supply and pay the militia of the States, by them
</p>
<p>admitted to have been in the United States service : the Report of the
</p>
<p>Secretary of War to Congress on filling the ranks of the army, togctlier
</p>
<p>with a bill or act on that subject : a bill before Congress, providing lor

<p>* And yet, a less number of men actually controlled tlie fortunes of the Secession
</p>
<p>Revolution of 1860-61 in its incipient stages. The difference between their work
</p>
<p>and that of the Hartford Conventionists consisted less in the principles evolved

<p>than in the character of the men :  the delegates of 1814 truly wished well for

<p>who, on the ruins of the Union, would erect a powerful Slave-republic which Slave

<p>two parlies, save in their common reliance upon the JeflTerson and Madison resolu-

</p>
<p>This was considered in Committee of the Whole for several

<p>days, when (Dec. 20th) a second Committee was named to re-
</p>
<p>port "a general project of such measures" as it would be pro-
</p>
<p>per for the Convention to adopt. The report, as adopted (Dec.

<p>24:th), first declared it expedient to " prepare a general state-

</p>
<p>ernment of the United States to infringe on the rights of the

<p>money already expended by them for such purpose. (Also to

<p>tion. /This programme was considered with great deliberation
</p>
<p> every member present participating in the discussion. It
</p>
<p>resulted in the adoption of the Report, with Eesolutions above
</p>
<p>referred to, directed to their several Legislatures. Its most sa
</p>
<p>lient points were as follows :
</p>
<p>366 THE NEW ENGL AND DISCONTENTS.
</p>
<p>"To prescribe p<atience and firmness to those who are already exhaust-
</p>
<p>ed by distress is sometimes to drive them to despair, and the progress
</p>
<p>toward reform by the reguLar road is irlvsome to tliose whose imagina-
</p>
<p>tions discern and whose feelings prompt to a shorter course. But when
</p>
<p>abuses, reduced to a system, and accumulated through a course of years
</p>
<p>have pervaded every department of government, and spread corruption
</p>
<p>through every region of the State ; when these are clothed with the
</p>
<p>forms of law, and enforced by an Executive whose will is their source,
</p>
<p>no summary means of relief can be applied without recourse to direct
</p>
<p>and open resistance. It is a truth not to be concealed that a time for a
</p>
<p>change is at hand. * * * A. reformation of ijublic opinion, resulting
</p>
<p>from dear bought exj^erience in the Southern Atlantic States at least, is
</p>
<p>not to be despaired of. They will have seen that the great and essen-
</p>
<p>tial interests of the people are common to the South and to the East.
</p>
<p>They will realize the fatal errors of a system which seeks revenge for
</p>
<p>commercial injuries in the sacrifice of commerce, and aggravates by
</p>
<p>needless wars the injuries it professes to redress. Indications of tliis
</p>
<p>desii'able revolution of opinion among our brethren in those States are
</p>
<p>already manifested. Finally, if the Union be destined to dissolution ))y
</p>
<p>reason of the multiplied abuses of bad administrations, it should be, if
</p>
<p>possible, the w^ork of peaceable times and deliberate consent. Some new
</p>
<p>form of confederacy should be substituted among those States which
</p>
<p>shall intend to maintain a Federal relation to each other. Events may
</p>
<p>prove that the causes of our calamities are deep and permanent. They
</p>
<p>may be found to proceed not merely from the blindness or prejudice,
</p>
<p>pride of opinion, violence of party spirit, or the confusion of the times ;
</p>
<p>but they may be traced to implacable combinations of individuals or of
</p>
<p>States to n'lonopolise power and office, and to trample without remorse
</p>
<p>upon the rights and interests of commercial sections of the Union.
</p>
<p>Whenever it shall appear that the causes are radical and permanent, a
</p>
<p>separation by equitable arrangement will be preferable to an alliance by
</p>
<p>constraint among nominal friends, but real enemies, inflamed by mutual
</p>
<p>hatred and jealousy, and inviting, by intestine divisions, contempt and
</p>
<p>aggressions from abroad  but a severance of the Union by one or more

<p>States against the will of the rest, and especially in time of war, can be
</p>
<p>justified only by absolute necessity."
</p>
<p>The Eeport then proceeded to consider the several subjects
</p>
<p>of complaint, chief of which was the authority over the militia
</p>
<p>claimed by the National Executive. It said :
</p>
<p>" In this whole series of devices and measures for raising men, this
</p>
<p>Convention discerns a total disregard for the Constitution, and a dispo-
</p>
<p>sition to violate its provisions, demanding from the individual States a
</p>
<p>firm and decided opposition. An iron despotism can impose no harder
</p>
<p>service upon the citizen than to force him from his home and his occa-
</p>
<p>NULLIFICATION. 367
</p>
<p>pation to wage offensive war undertaken to gratify the pride or passions
</p>
<p>of bis master. * * * Jq cases of deliberate, dangerous and palpal)le
</p>
<p>infractions of the Constitution, affecting the sovereignty of a State and
</p>
<p>the liberties of the people, it is not only the right, but the duty of such
</p>
<p>State to interpose its authority for the protection in the manner best
</p>
<p>calculated to secure that end. When emergencies occur which are
</p>
<p>either beyond the reach of the judicial tribunals, or too pressing to
</p>
<p>admit of the delay incident to their forms. States which have no
</p>
<p>common umpire must be their own judges and execute their own
</p>
<p>decisions."
</p>
<p>[We here have not only the legitimate logical consequent of
</p>
<p>the Kentucky resolutions, but a repetition of Jefferson's very
</p>
<p>idea. He said: "As in other cases of compact between parties
</p>
<p>having no common judge, each party has an equal right to
</p>
<p>judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and mea-
</p>
<p>sure of redress." Perhaps the special pleader may be able to
</p>
<p>discover that this assumption is not that of the Hartford Con-
</p>
<p>vention ; but, to the mass of readers, who take words in their
</p>
<p>accredited signification, the Hartford resolves will seem but
</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson's reproduced. If any lingering doubt exists as
</p>
<p>to the extent of Mr. Jefferson's nullification sentiments, they
</p>
<p>will be dissipated by his eighth resolution, which expressly
</p>
<p>and directly declares that (the States themselves being sole
</p>
<p>judges) where Congress assumes powers not delegated by the
</p>
<p>people, "a nullification of the act is the right remedy ; and that
</p>
<p>every State has a natural right, in cases not within the compact,
</p>
<p>to nullify, of their own authority, all assumptions of power by
</p>
<p>others within their limits.''^ We are at a loss, in view of this
</p>
<p>express declaration, and that which immediately follows it in
</p>
<p>the same resolution, to discover upon what authority Mr. Ev-
</p>
<p>erett (see Address, of July 4th, 1861) denies the nullification
</p>
<p>sentiment as Mr. Jefferson's own. This we add, par parenthesis,
</p>
<p>in order that, in forming his judgment of the true character of
</p>
<p>the Hartford proceedings, the ' democratic' reader at least may

</p>
<p>appropriated from the ideas of the "father of Democrac3^'']
</p>
<p>The resolves accompanying this Report or Address we may
</p>
<p>give in abstract :
</p>
<p>The first recommended the Legislatures of the States represented to
</p>
<p>868 THE NEW ENGLAND D I SCON-TENTS.
</p>
<p>protect the citizens of the several States from the operation of acts pass-
</p>
<p>ed b}-^ Congress, subjecting them to forcible drafts, conscriptions or im-
</p>
<p>pressments, not authorized by tlie Constitution.
</p>
<p>The second recommended that the States be empowered to defend
</p>
<p>themselves, and that they have for their own use their proportion of the
</p>
<p>taxes collected.
</p>
<p>The third recommended each State to defend itself.
</p>
<p>The fourth recommended amendments to the Constitution, as follows:
</p>
<p>1 . A])portionmcnt of representation and taxation the basis of white pop-
</p>
<p>ulation. 2. New States to be admitted by a vote of two-thirds of both
</p>
<p>houses of Congress. 3. Congress shall have no power to lay an embar-
</p>
<p>go of more than sixty days' duration. 4. Congress shall not have pow-
</p>
<p>er to interdict foreign trade without a vote of two-thirds of both houses,
</p>
<p>5. Congress shall not make Avar by a less vote tlian two-thirds of both
</p>
<p>branches, unless in defense of territory actually invaded. 6. No natur-
</p>
<p>alized citized to be eligible to any civil office under the United States.
</p>
<p>7. No President to be elected twice or for two terms, nor to be chosen
</p>
<p>from the same State twice in succession.
</p>
<p>The report concluded with the recommendation that if the foregoing
</p>
<p>resolutions should be unsuccessful when submitted to the General Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment through the respective States, if peace should not be concluded,
</p>
<p>and the defense of the New England States be neglected, as it had been,
</p>
<p>it would be expedient for the Legislatures of the several States to ap-
</p>
<p>point delegates to another Convention to meet at Boston, in June fol-
</p>
<p>lowing, " with such powers and instructions as the exigency of a crisis
</p>
<p>so momentous may require."
</p>
<p>These resolves were designed for, and were sent forth to, the
</p>
<p>Legislatures of the several States ; but, like the Virginia and
</p>
<p>Kentucky resolves of '98, elicited no favorable response. Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic Pennsylvania heaped upon them strong expressions of
</p>
<p>contempt. The Convention's report the Legislatures of Massa-
</p>
<p>chusetts and Connecticut accepted, and appointed (June 19th)
</p>
<p>five Commissioners to Washington to lay their wishes before
</p>
<p>the National authorities  their instructions requiring them to

<p>t"he Commissioners wisely preferred not even to announce their
</p>
<p>mission. Those of them who had found their way to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington quietly returned.
</p>
<p>The great Hartford Convention Conspiracy thus dissolved.
</p>
<p>The country, which had frowned upon and feared it, now
</p>
<p>laughed at its failure ; its members were 'derided, or pointed at'
</p>
<p>in scorn, as something loathsome if not dangerous ; and three
</p>
<p>generations scarcely have sufl&ced to quiet the public mind in
</p>
<p>regard to its assumed treasonable character. So powerfully,
</p>
<p>indeed, did public sentiment set in against the convocation and
</p>
<p>its abettors that few were hardy enough to defend the course
</p>
<p>pursued. Even Webster, it is asserted, prosecuted Theodore
</p>
<p>Lyman (son of a member of the Convention) for asserting that
</p>
<p>he (W.) had some connection with the Convention ! But, de-
</p>
<p>spite this popular disfavor there still exists in New England a
</p>
<p>strong feeling of sympathy for the Convention, as a represent-
</p>
<p>ative of the opposition to Jefferson's "Chinese policy." ' Says
</p>
<p>a New England writer in a very lucid and able paper on Amer-
</p>
<p>ican Navigation : ^
</p>
<p>"If, duriug tlie seven years of trial and suffering, from 1808 to 1815,
</p>
<p>in which nearly one-half of the wealth of New England was extinguish-
</p>
<p>ed, her citizens became indignant at the wanton sacrifice of their means
</p>
<p>and of the best opportunity Fortune ever gave them to gain riches by
</p>
<p>commerce  if the public sentiment found expression alike through the
</p>
<p>press, in town-meetings, in legislative halls, and even in the pulpit  if
</p>
<p>the capitalist lost confidence in a government which trifled with its own
</p>
<p>resources  if the merchant' refused all countenance to those who had
</p>
<p>wrought his ruin  let the blame fall on the originators of the evil.
</p>
<p>Lord North did but impose a few light taxes, place a few restrictions
</p>
<p>upon commerce, and make a few other inroads on freedom ; but he set a
</p>
<p>nation in flames. The Cabinets of 1807 and 1812 warred against com-
</p>
<p>merce itself, and placed an interdict on every harbor; and which of the

<p>pressive and so unnecessary that they were ingloriously abandoned ? "
</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams recurring to the proposed second con-
</p>
<p>vocation, to assemble at Boston in June, says : " it was turned
</p>
<p>over to the receptacle of things lost upon earth"  so utterly
</p>
<p>dead did the very idea of a second Convention become. Not
</p>
<p>that the treaty obtained of Great Britain, by our Commission-
</p>
<p>ers, really accomplished anything important ; but, it was
</p>
<p>peace, and her wand swept away the past as if it had been but
</p>
<p>a shadow. News of the arrangement reached New York, by
</p>
<p>a British sloop-of-war bearing two messengers with the treaty,
</p>
<p>as already ratified, by the British government. Without for a
</p>
<p>moment pausing to ask the terms and conditions of that treaty,
</p>
<p>the people gave way to expressions of unlimited joy. In every
</p>
<p>city bonfires, illuminations, bell-ringings, &c., followed upon
</p>
<p>the reception of the good tidings, flying by special expresses
</p>
<p>over the land. In Congress satisfaction was not less apparent.
</p>
<p>A zealous war partisan congratulated the House on the glori-
</p>
<p>ous termination of the most glorious war waged by any people,
</p>
<p>&c. But, the painful fact, when the treaty was published
</p>
<p>(after its ratification by Congress, Feb. I7th) became confessed
</p>
<p>that the war had ended just where it had begun  that we had
</p>
<p>" whipped" England into nothing, extorted no concessions, es-
</p>
<p>tablished no permanent principles of comity ! Says Hildreth :
</p>
<p>" The Federalists, and all the more sensible Republicans, con-
</p>
<p>sidered the country lucky in the peace, such as it was. The
</p>
<p>violent war men, greatly cooled by this time, concealed their
</p>
<p>mortification, like Troup, behind the smoke of Jackson's vic-
</p>
<p>tory, and vague declarations about the national rights vindi-
</p>
<p>cated, the national character exalted, and the military and na-

<p>val glory of the war. Considering the new demands of Great
</p>
<p>Britain put forward at Ghent, they seemed to esteem it a tri-
</p>
<p>umph to be allowed to stop where they began, leaving the
</p>
<p>whole question of impressments and neutral rights, the st^lo

<p>common termination of wars, even for the most powerful and

<p>belligerent nations, and of whicb Great Britain herself has given
</p>
<p>more than one instance."
</p>
<p>It is not to be inferred that the ISTew England States furnish-
</p>
<p>ed no troops for the war. The volunteer system found great
</p>
<p>numbers of recruits  how many will never be known, as thej
</p>
<p>were sent bj squads and companies to New York for muster
</p>
<p>in various regiments. During the eventful excitement of 1814,
</p>
<p>about 14,000 volunteers were secured at recruiting rendezvous,
</p>
<p>under the bounty enlistment a,ct ; and, of this number New
</p>
<p>England furnished more than all the Southern States put to-
</p>
<p>gether ! Massachusetts enlisted more than any single State in
</p>
<p>the Union, to the Grand Army, for that year.^
</p>
<p>From what has been written the reader will have a clear
</p>
<p>comprehension of the causes of the Hartford Convention, if not
</p>
<p>of its actual aims. That these causes were potent enough to
</p>
<p>produce irritation of the body politic is not a matter of question ;
</p>
<p>and the assumption, by a certain class of writers, that it was a
</p>
<p>love of England, a desire for a state of colonial dependence
</p>
<p>which induced the hostility of the New Englanders to Madison
</p>
<p>and the war, is too transparently but an assumption to merit
</p>
<p>attention. By heaping derision, insult, libel and scorn upon the
</p>
<p>Federalists, as authors of the Convention and as enemies of tlie
</p>
<p>Government, their opponents gained in popular force so im-
</p>
<p>mensely as to render them doubly secure in power : not until
</p>
<p>the ' log cabin and hard cider' campaign of 1840 was the bond
</p>
<p>broken which gave the Democrats the Executive branches of

</p>
<p>one can liardly express surprise at the statements put forth by Pollard, in his
</p>
<p>" First Year of the War"  (Secession Eevolution). He says :
</p>
<p>" In the war of 1812 the North furnished 58,552 soldiers ; the South 96,812 mak-
</p>
<p>ing a majority of 37,030 in favor of the South. Of the men furnished by the North,
</p>
<p>Massachusetts furnished 3,110; New Hampshire 897; Connecticut 387; Rhode

</p>
<p>It is possible that the South, including Pennsylvania and New York, furnished
</p>
<p>more troops than the North for the entire period of the war, for general operations;
</p>
<p>but, the figures above given of the numbers contributed by the New England States
</p>
<p>are absurdly at variance with the truth. When the facts are so easily accessible

<p>we can hardly excuse such outrageous misstatements.

</p>
<p>the death of Harrison a Virginian became President and the
</p>
<p>South again resumed its scarcely broken sway. There was
</p>
<p>policy, therefore, in making the most of what, at the worst,
</p>
<p>was but an embodiment of the paramount policy of the South
</p>
<p>the right to discredit Congressional acts and to defy the Nation-

<p>al Executive ; the crime was, as we now see, not so much in
</p>
<p>the attitude of hostility assumed, as that Massachusetts should

<p>have assumed it. When the rebellious States of the South in

<p>THE SLATE INSURRECTION OF 1822.
</p>
<p>Negro conspiracies and actual insurrections in the Unitea
</p>
<p>States have been more numerous than the Southern people
</p>
<p>care to acknowledge, but only those of Denmark Yesey and
</p>
<p>Nat Turner have won historical importance. It has been the
</p>
<p>policy of the slave-holding States not only to suppress, with a
</p>
<p>relentless hand, every appearance of disaffection among their
</p>
<p>slaves, but also to keep from the light all testimony regarding
</p>
<p>the occasional slave uprisings Which have not failed to occur.
</p>
<p>It is certain that eight, if not ten, very extended conspiracies
</p>
<p>have been formed among the negro bondsmen of the South ;
</p>
<p>it is known that four or five have resulted in open insurrec-
</p>
<p>tion which was suppressed only by the sacrifice of every negro
</p>
<p>implicated as a leader or abettor; but, of these exciting epi-
</p>
<p>sodes of Southern history, only the faintest records are in exist-
</p>
<p>ence, as if the slave masters themselves feared to read the story.
</p>
<p>Of the two terrible tragedies now associated with the names of
</p>
<p>Vesey and Turner suflicient authentic data exists to lay before
</p>
<p>the reader intelligible narratives of them, although, in their
</p>
<p>cases, the efforts afterwards made to suppress testimony, have
</p>
<p>cast doubts upon much that otherwise must have been admit-
</p>
<p>ted as evidence. The comparatively recent period of these
</p>
<p>events, however, has been used by a painstaking inquii-er to
</p>
<p>regather, from public and private sources, incidents and cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances enough to render the record historically accurate.
</p>
<p>This inquirer gave the results of his investigations in two arti-
</p>
<p>cles prepared for the Atlantic Monthly  June and August num-
</p>
<p>bers, 1861  from which we draw much of the matter for this

<p>insurrection.
</p>
<p>S7i in"surrectio:n' of den"mark vesey.
</p>
<p>E irly in June, 1822, Charleston, South Carolina, was deeply
</p>
<p>stirred with excitement. A painful fear of a negro uprising
</p>
<p>filled the hearts of all who were permitted to know of the mat-
</p>
<p>ter. Leading planters and citizens armed ; the authorities
</p>
<p>were on the alert ; the patrol was secretly strengthened and the
</p>
<p>negroes were watched with sleepless vigilance. All this ap-
</p>
<p>prehension, up to the middle of June, sprang from the most
</p>
<p>vague premises. William, a negro belonging to Mr. John Paul,
</p>
<p>had uttered mysterious hints to Devany, the slave of Colonel
</p>
<p>Prioleau, of an intended insurrection. This disclosure was
</p>
<p>confided to a free black, by whose advice Devany revealed to
</p>
<p>his owner what he had been told. That sufiiced to alarm the
</p>
<p>authorities. Forthwith the Mayor of Charleston summoned
</p>
<p>the Corporation (City Council), when both negroes, William
</p>
<p>and Devany, were submitted to a close examination. Nothing
</p>
<p>in addition transpired. William was successful in baffling all
</p>
<p>inquiries into his private aftairs, and was remanded to prison.
</p>
<p>He was not proof against confinement and, ere long, revealed
</p>
<p>the names of Mingo Harth and Peter Boyas, as his chief in-
</p>
<p>formants. These two slaves were, therefore, quietly arrested,
</p>
<p>but so innocent did they appear  so well did they disguise
</p>
<p>everything, that they were discharged. They must have prac-
</p>
<p>ticed extraordinary dissimulation, since they really were chiefs
</p>
<p>in the Conspiracy. William was pressed to make further de-
</p>
<p>velopments, and inculpated several other negroes ; but, these
</p>
<p>blacks, like Mingo and Peter, put on such an air of innocence
</p>
<p>as to confound their examiners. Enough, however, had trans-
</p>
<p>pired to place the authorities on the qui vive, and everj^thing
</p>
<p>was prepared for an outbreak.
</p>
<p>Had William been the only recusant the awful tragedy of a
</p>
<p>slave insurrection and massacre, fully matured and admirably
</p>
<p>ordered, would have followed ; but, another informer came
</p>
<p>forward, revealing the fact that on Sunday night, June 16th,
</p>
<p>the uprising was to take place. There were but two days grace,

<p>as the revelation was made on Friday, June l-lth ; but it was
</p>
<p>time enough to make ready all things. The city authorities,
</p>
<p>acting in concert with the Governor, Thomas Bennet, had their
</p>
<p>arrangements sq well perfected that, had the negroes appeared

</p>
<p>to any number thej must have been overcome. This revela-
</p>
<p>tion, secretly made, was kept from all public announcement
</p>
<p>with the design of having the Conspirators divulge their entire
</p>
<p>scheme, and thus mark the leaders for punishment. But, the
</p>
<p>sagacious blacks soon discovered that their movement was be-
</p>
<p>trayed. They met Sunday night, at their several rendezvous,
</p>
<p>compared notes, and resolved to abandon the project for a more
</p>
<p>propitious moment. The secret of the insurrection was kept
</p>
<p>only until the first danger was past, when all Charleston was
</p>
<p>in a furore of excitement over its happy escape from the tei"-
</p>
<p>rors of a San Domingo butchery. The negroes became fright-
</p>
<p>ened, and, from some of the most timid of the guilty, enough
</p>
<p>evidence was obtained to identify ten of those implicated, who
</p>
<p>were at once arrested. An investigation followed, when the
</p>
<p>whole plot soon stood revealed. A free black' named Den-
</p>
<p>mark Vesey, working in the city as a carpenter, was indicated
</p>
<p>as the chief Conspirator, with Mingo and Peter, already refer-
</p>
<p>red to, as his principal coadjutors. Their rearrest of course im-
</p>
<p>mediately took place.
</p>
<p>Yesey was, in many respects, a remarkable character. When
</p>
<p>a lad of fourteen he had been stolen from Africa and borne,
</p>
<p>along with three hundred and ninety others, to Hayti for a
</p>
<p>market. His intelligence soon rendered him a pet, and he was
</p>
<p>taken by Captain Yesey  master of the slaver, and an old
</p>
<p>citizen of Charleston  into the cabin, where he was christened
</p>
<p>" Telemak," was clothed and so civilized that he was sold for
</p>
<p>a good price to a wealthy French resident of the island. Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Yesey ere long visited Hayti with another cargo of hu-
</p>
<p>man flesh and blood, when he learned that," Telemak" was
</p>
<p>-unsound, having had epileptic fits, and would therefore be re-
</p>
<p>turned upon his hands. ' The slave boy was, thereupon, trans-
</p>
<p>ferred to the ship again, to become the Captain's inseparable
</p>
<p>companion-servant For nearly twenty years he faithfully

<p>taken by a slave trader from his native wilds to Hayti. as stated in our narrative.
</p>
<p>He did not participate in the St. Domingo insurrection having left the island be-
</p>
<p>fore the revolution, or " insurrection," as it is popularly termed.

<p>served the sailor, visiting many lands, learning several lan-
</p>
<p>guages and never showing signs of epilepsy ! In the year 1800,
</p>
<p>having drawn a prize of fifteen hundred dollars in a lottery, he
</p>
<p>paid the Captain six hundred dollars of that prize to secure his
</p>
<p>own freedom  a transfer of property which the master con-
</p>
<p>sidered a generous act on his own part, since Telemak  or
</p>
<p>Denmark as he grew to be called  was worth more money.
</p>
<p>Thus free from a slave's bonds, the negro took up his perma
</p>
<p>nent abode in Charleston, where he became a house carpenter,
</p>
<p>practicing his trade with such success as to employ several
</p>
<p>"hands"' to execute his contracts. Of his life at Charleston we
</p>
<p>have only what is to be gleaned from the " ofl6.cial report" made,
</p>
<p>by the Mayor, of the insurrection and trial after the condemna-
</p>
<p>tion ofthe accused to the gallows. The document said: "Among
</p>
<p>those of his color he was looked up to with awe and respect.
</p>
<p>His temper was impetuous and domineering in the extreme,
</p>
<p>qualifying him for the despotic rule of which he was ambitious.
</p>
<p>All his passions were ungovernable and savage ; and to his
</p>
<p>numerous wives and children he displayed the haughty and
</p>
<p>capricious cruelty of an Eastern bashaw." All of which doubt-
</p>
<p>less was true. As his "numerous wives" were such by con-
</p>
<p>sent of their owners, and as his " numerous children" only ad-
</p>
<p>ded to the wealth of the State  all being slaves  the report
</p>
<p>does not urge his bigamy as an additional crime. We may
</p>
<p>further quote : " For several years before he disclosed his in-
</p>
<p>tentions to any one,' he appears to have been constantly and
</p>
<p>assiduously engaged in endeavoring to embitter the minds of
</p>
<p>the colored population against the white. He rendered him-
</p>
<p>self perfectly familiar with all those parts of the Scrip-
</p>
<p>tures which he thought he could pervert to his j^urpose;
</p>
<p>and would readily quote them, to prove that slavery was con-
</p>
<p>trary to the laws of God  that slaves were bound to attempt
</p>
<p>their emancipation, however shocking and bloody might be the
</p>
<p>consequences  and that such efforts would not only be pleas-

</p>
<p>success predicted in the Scriptures. His favorite texts, when
</p>
<p>he addressed those of his own color, were Zechariah, xiv. 1-3,

<p>their situation witli tliat of the Israelites. The number of in-
</p>
<p>flammatory pamphlets on slavery brought into Charleston fi-om
</p>
<p>some of our sister States within the last four years, (and once
</p>
<p>from Sierra Leone,) and distributed amongst the colored popu-
</p>
<p>lation of the city, for which there was a great facility, in con-
</p>
<p>sequence of the unrestricted intercourse allowed ,to persons of
</p>
<p>color between the different States in the Union, and the speech-
</p>
<p>es in Congress of those opposed to the admission of Missouri
</p>
<p>into the Union, perhaps garbled and misrepresented, furnished
</p>
<p>him with ample means for inflaming the minds of the colored
</p>
<p>population of this State ; and by distorting certain parts of
</p>
<p>those speeches, or selecting from them particular passages, he
</p>
<p>persuaded but too many that Congress had actually declared
</p>
<p>them free, and that they were held in bondage contrary to the
</p>
<p>laws of the land. Even whilst walking through the streets in
</p>
<p>company with another, he was not idle ; for if his companion
</p>
<p>bowed to a white person, he would rebuke him, and observe
</p>
<p>that all men were born equal, and that he was surprised that
</p>
<p>any one would degrade himself by such conduct  that he would
</p>
<p>never cringe to the whites, nor ought any one who had the
</p>
<p>feelings of a man. When answered, 'We are slaves,' he would
</p>
<p>sarcastically and indignantly reply, ' You deserve to remain
</p>
<p>slaves'; and if he were further asked, 'What can we do?' he
</p>
<p>would remark, ' Go and buy a spelling-book and read the fable
</p>
<p>of Hercules and the Wagoner,' which he would then repeat,
</p>
<p>and apply it to their situation. He also sought every oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of entering into conversation with white persons, when
</p>
<p>they could be overheard by negroes near by, especially in grog-
</p>
<p>shops  during which conversation he would artfully introduce
</p>
<p>aome bold remark on slavery ; and sometimes, when, from the
</p>
<p>character he was conversing with, he found he might be still
</p>
<p>bolder, he would go so far, that, had not his declarations in
</p>
<p>such situations been clearly proved, they would scarcely have
</p>
<p>been credited. He continued this course until some time after

<p>This picture is clearly intensified in color for effect, but is
</p>
<p>true enough to prove the African to have been a man of pow-
</p>
<p>erful parts. His house became the resort of negroes in sympa-
</p>
<p>thy with him and " his work" He made converts as prelimi-
</p>
<p>nary to conquests. His influence extended beyond Charleston ;
</p>
<p>it went up the rivers, floated over the sea islands, penetrated
</p>
<p>to the interior ; everywhere he was known secretly to the ne-
</p>
<p>groes as "one with a work to do." Yet, it does not appear
</p>
<p>that he excited any particular notice from the planters, or the
</p>
<p>Charleston authorities  a singular fact if he did talk as freely
</p>
<p>and openly as stated in the report. He succeeded in calling
</p>
<p>to his aid as co-conspirators Peter Poyas and Gullah Jack. The
</p>
<p>first named was a daring, sagacious black, to whom Vesey ul-
</p>
<p>timately committed the details of the uprising  a trust executed
</p>
<p>with much military ability and decided intelligence. The other
</p>
<p>was a kind of necromancer or sorcerer, whose influence over
</p>
<p>the ignorant sons of toil grew to be quite unbounded. These
</p>
<p>three were the guiding spirits of that terrible plot, though
</p>
<p>three or four others were added whose services were specially
</p>
<p>required. Thus, Monday Cell became Secretary of the Con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, performing all the necessary writing. He even wrote
</p>
<p>a letter to President Boyer, of Hayti, informing him of the
</p>
<p>intended " stroke for liberty" and seeking for his co-operation.
</p>
<p>Tom Russell, William Garner, Mingo Harth, Polydore Faber,
</p>
<p>Bacchus Hammet, Lot Forrester, Ned and Rolla Bennett, all
</p>
<p>were chosen for particular duties, to which they were assigned,
</p>
<p>and of which they were rec^uired to give a good account on
</p>
<p>pain of untold penalties.
</p>
<p>The initiated embraced the most trusted of the slaves  those
</p>
<p>whose intelligence gave them unusual facilities for obtaining
</p>
<p>the confidence of masters. A monthly place of meeting was
</p>
<p>on a plantation, up one of the sea estuaries, called Bulkley's
</p>
<p>Farm, whose overseer was a black and one of those interested
</p>

</p>
<p>quets, which assumed a melodramatic character under the in-

<p>over it, and then they all grasped at it, exclaiming, ' Thus we
</p>
<p>pull Buckra to pieces ! ' He gave them parched corn and
</p>
<p>ground-nuts to be eaten as internal safeguards on the day be-
</p>
<p>fore the outbreak, and a consecrated cuUah, or crab's claw, to
</p>
<p>be carried in the mouth by each, as an amulet. These rather
</p>
<p>questionable means secured him a power which was \erj un-
</p>
<p>questionable ; the witnesses examined in his presence all show-
</p>
<p>ed dread of his conjurations, and referred to him indirectly,
</p>
<p>with a kind of awe, as 'the little man who can't be shot' "
</p>
<p>The night of Sunday was chosen for the sacrifice because of
</p>
<p>the great numbers of blacks always gathered, on that dky, in
</p>
<p>Charleston, whither they all came "to church," from the
</p>
<p>surrounding plantations reached by water. The Ashley and
</p>
<p>Cooper rivers were fairly alive, on the Sabbath, with negro
</p>
<p>boats. This gave the conspirators the presence of the force
</p>
<p>required for thorough work without at all alarming the whites.
</p>
<p>The magazine writer added :
</p>
<p>" The details of the plan, however, were not rashly committed to the
</p>
<p>mass of the confederates ; they were known only to a few, and were
</p>
<p>finally to have been announced after the evening prayer-meetings on the
</p>
<p>appointed Sunday. But each leader had his own comi^any enlisted, and
</p>
<p>his own work marked out. When the clock struck twelve, all were to
</p>
<p>move. Peter Poyas was to lead a party ordered to assemble at South
</p>
<p>Bay, and to be joined by a force from James' Island; he was then to
</p>
<p>march up and seize the arsenal and guard-house opposite St. Michael's
</p>
<p>Church, and detach a sufficient number to cut off all white citizens who
</p>
<p>should appear at the alarm-posts. A second body of negroes, from
</p>
<p>the country and the Neck, headed by Ned Bennett, was to assemble
</p>
<p>on the Neck, and seize the arsenal there. A third was to meet at
</p>
<p>Governor Bennett's Mills, under command of Rolla, and, after putting
</p>
<p>the Governor and Intendant to death, to march through the city, or
</p>
<p>be ijosted at Cannon's Bridge, thus preventing the inhabitants of
</p>
<p>Cannousborough from entering the city. A fourth, partly from the
</p>
<p>country and partly from the neighboring localities in the city, was

<p>to rendezvous on Gladsden's Wharf and attack the upper guard-
</p>
<p>house. A fifth, composed of country and Neck negroes, was to as-
</p>
<p>seml)le at Bulkley's Farm, two miles and a half from the cit}', seize
</p>
<p>the upper powder-magazine and then march dovvn ; and a sixth was
</p>
<p>to assemble at Denmark Vesey's and obey his orders. A seventh
</p>
<p>detachment, under Gullah Jack, was to assemble in Boundary street,
</p>
<p>at the head of King street, to capture the arms of the Neck compa-
</p>
<p>380 INSUERECTION OF DENMARK VESEY.
</p>
<p>ay of militia, aud to take an additional supply from Mr. Duquercron's
</p>
<p>shop. The naval stores on Mey's Wharf were also to be attacked.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile a horse-company, consisting of many draymen, hostlers,
</p>
<p>and butcher-boys, was to meet at Lightwood's alley and then scour
</p>
<p>the streets to prevent the whites from assembling. Every white man
</p>
<p>coming out of his own door was to be killed, and, if necessary, the
</p>
<p>city was to be fired in several places  slow-match for this purpose
</p>
<p>having been purloined from the public arsenal and placed in acces-
</p>
<p>sible positions.
</p>
<p>" Beyond this, the plan of action was either unformed or undiscover-
</p>
<p>ed ; some slight reliance seems to have been placed on English aid 
</p>
<p>more on assistance from St. Domingo ; at any rate, all the ships in the
</p>
<p>harbor were to be seized, and in these, if the worst came to the worst,
</p>
<p>those most deeply inculjaated could set sail, bearing with them, perhaps,
</p>
<p>the spoils of shoj^s and of banks. It seems to be admitted by the official
</p>
<p>narrative, that they might have been able, at that season of the year,
</p>
<p>and with the aid of the fortifications on the Neck and around the har-
</p>
<p>bor, to retain possession of the city for some time."
</p>
<p>From this it will be seen how extensive were the arrange-
</p>
<p>ments for the bloody retribution. The CharlestOnians indeed
</p>
<p>escaped untold horrors when that Sunday night passed in
</p>
<p>peace. Not a white life was to be spared  all were to be sac-
</p>
<p>rificed. Even trusted servants, faithful slaves, class leaders
</p>
<p>and church members, were to kill their households  so terribly
</p>
<p>in earnest were the helots,' " One prisoner is reported in the
</p>
<p>evidence to have dropped hints in regard to the destiny of the
</p>
<p>women ; and there was a rumor in the newspapers of the time,
</p>
<p>that he, or some other of Governor Bennett's slaves, was to
</p>
<p>have taken the Governor's daughter, a young girl of sixteen,
</p>
<p>for his wife, in the event of success ; but this is all. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, Denmark Vesey was known to be for a war of im-
</p>
<p>mediate and total extermination ; and when some of the com-
</p>
<p>pany opposed killing ' the ministers and the women and chil-
</p>
<p>dren,' Vesey read from the Scriptures that all should be cut

</p>
<p>> The official report mentions the case of one slave who had belonged to one
</p>
<p>master for sixteen years, sustaining a high character for fidelity and affection,
</p>
<p>who had twice travelled with him through the Northern States, resisting every so-
</p>
<p>licitation to escape, and who yet was very deeply concerned in the insurrection,
</p>
<p>though knowing it to involve the probable destruction of the whole family with

<p>whom he lived.

</p>
<p>skin alive, for this was tlie plan they pursued at St. Domingo.'
</p>
<p>And all this was not a mere dream of one lonely enthusiast,
</p>
<p>but a measure which had been maturing for four full years
</p>
<p>among several confederates, and had been under discussion
</p>
<p>for five months among multitudes of initiated ' candidates.' "
</p>
<p>It will be remarked as surprising that a plot, so extended in
</p>
<p>its memberships, should have existed so long without discove-
</p>
<p>ry. This profound reticence is, however, one of the negroes'
</p>
<p>most remarkable characteristics. However trivial he may be,
</p>
<p>with a secret involving his own destiny he is safe. " In one
</p>
<p>case it was proven that Yesey had forbidden his followers to
</p>
<p>trust a certain man, because he had once been seen intoxicated.
</p>
<p>In another case it was shown that a slave named George had
</p>
<p>made every effort to obtain their confidence, but was constant-
</p>
<p>ly excluded froKi their meetings as a talkative fellow who
</p>
<p>could not be trusted  a policy which his levity of manner,
</p>
<p>when examined in court, fully justified. They took no women
</p>
<p>into counsel  not from any distrust, apparently, but in order
</p>
<p>that their children might not be left uncared for, in case of de-
</p>
<p>feat and destruction. House-servants were rarely trusted, or
</p>
<p>only when they had been carefully sounded by the chief lead-
</p>
<p>ers. Peter Poyas, in commissioning an agent to enlist men,
</p>
<p>gave him excellent cautions : ' Don't mention it to those wait-
</p>
<p>ing men who receive presents of old coats, etc., from their
</p>
<p>masters, or they'll betray us ; I ivill speah to them.'' When he
</p>
<p>did speak, if he did not convince them, he at least frightened
</p>
<p>them ; but the chief reliance was on the slaves hired out and
</p>
<p>therefore more uncontrolled  and also upon the country ne-
</p>
<p>groes." How well their confidence was kept was made evi-
</p>
<p>dent in the statement that Peter Poyas had six hundred names
</p>
<p>on his company list, yet not one of them was arrested  not
</p>
<p>one betrayed his confederates ! Of all the real leaders only
</p>
<p>Monday Gell was weak enough to confess; yet, with all the

<p>art used to obtain information, with promises of forgiveness

<p>and of reward, with threats of condign punishment, it is stated
</p>
<p>that but fifteen of the Conspirators were ferreted out during
</p>
<p>twenty-one days of official examination. And, after every
</p>
<p>possible exertion but one hundred and twenty-one arrests
</p>
<p>382 INSUKRECTION OF DENMARK VESET.
</p>
<p>were made. Of this number twenty-five were discharged with-
</p>
<p>out trial, twenty-seven acquitted and thirty-four "transported."
</p>
<p>Thirty-five only were found guilt}^  every one of whom were
</p>
<p>hung. The number actually enlisted is not known. One wit-
</p>
<p>ness gave it as nine thousand ; another as six thousand six
</p>
<p>hundred; but Governor Bennett placed those actually con-
</p>
<p>cerned at a very small estimate  a statement especially made
</p>
<p>with a view to allay public apprehension. It is certain that,
</p>
<p>from the little which was divulged, the Conspiracy was wide-
</p>
<p>spread and powerful in its incipient organizations, although
</p>
<p>the programme of operations as adopted stipulated a compara-
</p>
<p>tive restriction of " candidates," knowing, as one of the guilty
</p>
<p>confessed, that, with enough to commence their work with
</p>
<p>spirit the slaves generally would fall into the ranks  a state-
</p>
<p>ment startling even in its possibility of truth. If the slaves
</p>
<p>would so easily turn into insurgents what a volcano did South-
</p>
<p>ern society harbor in its very bosom !
</p>
<p>Trial followed arrest. Yive freeholders constituted the jury-
</p>
<p>court, appointed by two Judges of the Supreme Court under
</p>
<p>provision of a Legislative act " for the better ordering and gov-
</p>
<p>erning of negroes and other slaves." What "other slaves" were
</p>
<p>indicated by the act is not stated. This court, presided over
</p>
<p>by the two justices, held its sessions of life or death in Charles-
</p>
<p>ton  the Mayor' being informant. The trials, judged by the
</p>
<p>signification of that word in common law, were the merest
</p>
<p>form. The slaves being " property" were looked after by their
</p>
<p>masters as any other property in danger of confiscation or loss,
</p>
<p>and were furnished such counsel as the case admitted ; while
</p>
<p>the negroes who testified did so without oath or voucher of
</p>
<p>truth.
</p>
<p>Some of the incidents of the trial were thus given in the
</p>
<p>oflBicial report already alluded to: "Eolla, wdien arraigned, af-
</p>

<p>wonderful adroitness, astonishment and surprise. He was re-
</p>
<p>markable, throughout his trial, for great presence and compos-
</p>
<p>ure of mind. When he was informed he was convicted, and
</p>
<p>was advised to prepare for death, though he had previously

</p>
<p>(but after liis trial) confessed his guilt, lie appeared perfectly
</p>
<p>confounded, but exhibited no signs of fear. In Ned's beha-^
</p>
<p>vior there was nothing remarkable ; but his countenance was
</p>
<p>stern and immovable, even whilst he was receiving the sen-
</p>
<p>tence of death : from his looks it was impossible to discover or
</p>
<p>conjecture what were his feelings. Not so with Peter; for in
</p>
<p>his countenance were strongly marked disappointed ambition,
</p>
<p>revenge, indignation and an anxiety to know how far the dis-
</p>
<p>coveries had extended ; and the same emotions were exhibited
</p>
<p>in his conduct. He did not appear to fear personal conse-
</p>
<p>quences, for his whole behavior indicated the reverse ; but ex-
</p>
<p>hibited an evident anxiety for the success of their plan, in
</p>
<p>which his whole soul was embarked. His countenance and
</p>
<p>behavior v/ere the same when he received his sentence, and his
</p>
<p>only words were, on retiring, ' I suppose you'll let me see my
</p>
<p>wife and family before I die ? ' and that not in a supplicating
</p>
<p>tone. When he was asked, a day or two after, if it was possi-
</p>
<p>ble he could wish to see his master and family murdered, who
</p>
<p>had treated him so kindly, he only replied to the question
</p>
<p>by a smile. Monday's behavior was not peculiar. When he
</p>
<p>was before the court, his arms were folded; he heard the testi-
</p>
<p>mony given against him, and received his sentence with the
</p>
<p>utmost firmness and composure. But no description can ac-
</p>
<p>curately convey to others the impression which the trial, de-
</p>
<p>fense and appearance of Gullah Jack made on those who wit-
</p>
<p>nessed the workings of his cunning and rude address. When
</p>
<p>arrested and brought before the court, in company with ano-
</p>
<p>ther African named Jack, the property of the estate of Pritch-
</p>
<p>ard, he assumed so much ignorance, and looked and acted the
</p>
<p>fool so well, that some of the court could not believe that this
</p>
<p>was the necromancer who was sought after. This conduct he
</p>
<p>continued when on his trial, until he saw the witnesses and
</p>
<p>heard the testimony as it progressed against him, when, in an
</p>
<p>instant, his countenance was lighted up as if by lightning, and

</p>
<p>his wildness and vehemence of gesture, and the malignant
</p>
<p>glance with which he eyed the witnesses who appeared against
</p>
<p>him, all indicated the savage, who, indeed, had been caught,
</p>
<p>but not tamed. His courage, however, soon forsook him.
</p>
<p>884 INSUEEECTION OF DE^-MARK YESET.
</p>
<p>"When lie received sentence of death, he earnestly implored
</p>
<p>that a fortnight longer might be allowed him, and then a week
</p>
<p>longer, which he continued earnestly to solicit until he was
</p>
<p>taken from the court-room to his cell ; and when he was car-
</p>
<p>ried to execution, he gave up his spirit without firmness or
</p>
<p>composure."
</p>
<p>Of the demeanor of Denmark Vesey we have full particulars
</p>
<p>both in the ofiicial report and in the narrative of the presiding
</p>
<p>judge, Kennedy, afterwards given to the public. The prison-
</p>
<p>er, though greatly dejected at the total miscarriage of his plot,
</p>
<p>was not a person to betray fear. He was as calm, resolute and
</p>
<p>self possessed as a willing martyr, and managed his own case,
</p>
<p>we are told, with exceeding shrewdness. "With his arms
</p>
<p>tightly folded and his eyes fixed on the floor, he attentively
</p>
<p>followed every item of the testimony. He heard the witnesses
</p>
<p>examined by the court, and cross examined by his own coun-
</p>
<p>sel, and it is evident from the narrative of the presiding judge
</p>
<p>that he showed no small skill and policy in the searching cross
</p>
<p>examination which he then applied. The fears, the feelings,
</p>
<p>the consciences of those who had betrayed him, all were in
</p>
<p>turn appealed to ; but the facts were too overpowering, and it
</p>
<p>was too late to aid his comrades or himself Then turning to
</p>
<p>the court, he skilfully availed himself of the point which had
</p>
<p>so much impressed the community, the intrinsic improbability
</p>
<p>that a man in his position of freedom and prosperity should
</p>
<p>sacrifice everything to free other people. If they thought it so
</p>
<p>incredible, why not give him the benefit of the incredibility ?
</p>
<p>The act being, as they stated, one of infatuation, why convict
</p>
<p>him of it on the bare word of men who, by their own showing,
</p>
<p>had not only shared the infatuation, but proved traitors to it ?
</p>
<p>An ingenious defense  indeed, the only one which could by
</p>
<p>any possibility be suggested, anterior to the days of Choate and
</p>
<p>somnambulism ; but in vain. He was sentenced, and it was
</p>
<p>not, apparently, till the judge reproached him for the destruc-

</p>
<p>tion he had brought on his followers that he showed any sign
</p>
<p>of emotion. Then the tears came into his eyes. But he said
</p>
<p>not another word."
</p>
<p>It was reported, though not so stated in any official shape,
</p>
<p>SLAVES FOEBIDDEN- TO READ. 885
</p>
<p>that lie made threats, asserting that the insurrection would go
</p>
<p>on. It was true that, after his execution, a number of negroes
</p>
<p>were punished for wearing sack cloth. An ordinance of the
</p>
<p>cit}^ prescribed that any slave wearing a badge of mourning
</p>
<p>should be imprisoned and flogged ; under which peculiarly
</p>
<p>South Carolina ordinance every negro, caught with a semblance
</p>
<p>of mourning, was given the legal thirty-nine lashes on the bare
</p>
<p>back, and ten days in darkness on bread and water.
</p>
<p>Although the outward semblance of calm was preserved,
</p>
<p>the excitement in and around Charleston continued intense
</p>
<p>during all of July and August. Governor Bennett wrote a
</p>
<p>letter  already noticed  which was issued as a circular, with
</p>
<p>the object of allaying public fears and personal excitement.
</p>
<p>His very words were evidence of the general alarm whose ex-
</p>
<p>istence it was vain to deny. The constant presence of strong
</p>
<p>bodies of armed men throughout all parts of the city ; the re-
</p>
<p>enforcements of United States troops thrown into Fort Moul-
</p>
<p>trie ; the midnight removal of the arsenal arms to Castle
</p>
<p>Pinckney ; the minute search for secreted weapons ; the deser-
</p>
<p>tion, by their owners and families, of the plantations  all were
</p>
<p>painful indications of the fears which rested upon that com-
</p>
<p>munity. It was then that some of the South Carolina people
</p>
<p>themselves dared to lift up their voices against the presence of
</p>
<p>negroes. During the Fall of 1822 an able pamphlet appeai-ed,
</p>
<p>directed against the aggregation of slaves, and which urged
</p>
<p>the introduction of free white labor. This was written by a pro-
</p>
<p>minent citizen of the State, but it excited no favorable response.
</p>
<p>Upon one thing the public was agreed, namely : the danger
</p>
<p>of permitting the negroes to learn how to read. To that privi-
</p>
<p>lege was traced the insurrection. Says the Atlantic writer :
</p>
<p>" The editor of the first official report racked his brains to discover
</p>
<p>the special causes of the revolt, and never trusted himself to allude to
</p>
<p>the general one. The negroes rebelled because they -were deluded by-
</p>
<p>Congressional eloquence, or because they were excited by a church

</p>
<p>Bquabble, or because they had been spoilt by mistaken indulgences,
</p>
<p>such as being allowed to learn to read, ' a misguided benevolence,' as
</p>
<p>he pronounces it. So the Baptist Convention seems to have thought it
</p>
<p>was because they were not Baptists, and an Episcopal pamphleteer be-
</p>
<p>cause they were not Episcopalians."
</p>
<p>386 INSURRECTION OF DENMARK VESET.
</p>
<p>But, such weakness were only worthy of the bigotry or stu-
</p>
<p>pidity of Southern churches ; that never for a moment the
</p>
<p>presence of so many negroes in South Carolina, and the bond-
</p>
<p>men's chains riveted upon them as upon, beasts, were indicated
</p>
<p>as the true source of the danger, is not to the credit of South
</p>
<p>Carohna intelligence and her Christian honesty.
</p>
<p>The trial, as stated, resulted in the condemnation of thirty-
</p>
<p>five to execution. The sentences were made by Justice Ken-
</p>
<p>nedy, after the freeholders had rendered their verdict. Six
</p>
<p>were hanged July 2d  the day, it was afterwards discovered,
</p>
<p>upon which a second attempt was to have been made to start
</p>
<p>the general movement of insurrection. These six were Den-
</p>
<p>mark Vesey, Peter Poyas, Ned, Rolla and Batteau  the three
</p>
<p>latter slaves of the Governor.' Gullah Jack and John were
</p>
<p>given to the gallows July 12th. Twenty-two were hung July
</p>
<p>26th, and four July 80th. Willie.m Garner, having escaped,
</p>
<p>was recaptured and executed August 9th. These executions
</p>
<p>transpired at different places amid much pomp of military dis-
</p>
<p>play, and in the presence of vast numbers of slaves, who were
</p>
<p>made to witness the end of the Conspirators as a warning of
</p>
<p>the fate awaiting all who should dare to incite rebellion against
</p>
<p>their helot's estate. Thirty-four sentenced to transportation
</p>
<p>were sent, singly, to the rice swamps of lower Georgia and
</p>
<p>Alabama,
</p>
<p>The bearing of the men on the gallows was very resolute.
</p>
<p>To the last they resisted all importunities to confess. " Do not
</p>
<p>open your lips," said Peter to his companions : " die silent as
</p>
<p>you shall see me do," and all obeyed. Two slaves among the
</p>
<p>condemned, belonging to one Ferguson, were severelj^ flogged
</p>
<p>prior to execution, in order to compel them to divulge, but to
</p>
<p>no purpose : they were silent as men already dead. Vesey's
</p>
<p>bearing was particularly commanding. He went to the grave
</p>
<p>as one conscious of a noble sacrifice.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the Insurrection in South Carolina. Its prom]3t

<p>* The Governor had, at the trial, urged the niltigacion of the sentence against
</p>
<p>Batteau  a very valuable slave, saying: " I ask this, gentlemen, as an individual

<p>suppression saved the State untold misery  perhaps saved the
</p>
<p>adjoining States from incendiary fires, for, once lit, they must
</p>
<p>have swept over many a league of Southern soil. Legislation
</p>
<p>against privileges to the blacks, excited by the experiences of
</p>
<p>the day, followed. Among other acts the South Carolina Leg-
</p>
<p>islature, in December (1822) passed one to imprison all colored
</p>
<p>men (free) coming from other States  by which outrageously
</p>
<p>unconstitutional statute numbers of colored men, some of them
</p>
<p>actual citizens of the Free States, were seized from vessels in
</p>
<p>South Carolina ports, imprisoned, and finally sold into slavery
</p>
<p>to pay the costs of imprisonment ! [A more inhuman act, or
</p>
<p>one more at variance with the personal liberty guaranteed by
</p>
<p>the Constitution, has not disgraced any statute book.' That
</p>
<p>law remained upon the records unrepealed, up to the secession
</p>
<p>of the State in 1860  a standing insult to the States and a de-
</p>
<p>fiance of the Constitution ; and yet, among other causes stated
</p>
<p>by the secession Convention in the list of grievances put upon
</p>
<p>that autocratical Commonwealth was the violation of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution by the North, in not returning fugitive slaves ! Pre-
</p>
<p>sumption and stultification of moral perceptions could hardly
</p>
<p>go farther.] The slaves also were debarred the rights of edu-
</p>
<p>cation. It soon became a state's prison offense to teach a black
</p>
<p>man how to read. The usual Sunday meetings were forbidden
</p>
<p>except under the surveillance of the whites ; the gathering of
</p>
<p>slaves in Charleston, from the surrounding plantations, was
</p>
<p>prohibited ; police regulations on the plantations became very
</p>
<p>rigid, and cruelty soon took the place of severity in discipline.
</p>
<p>In this respect the insurrection worked much wretchedness for
</p>
<p>the slaves ; it riveted their chains more firmly, it curtailed
</p>
<p>* Massachusetts sent Mr. Hoar, au eminent lawyer, to Charleston, to procure
</p>
<p>the release of several colored men, citizens of that State, imprisoned under this
</p>
<p>odious ordinance. Mr. Hoar, accompanied by his daughter, proceeded upon his
</p>
<p>mission but was compelled to retire in haste from Charleston under threats of per-
</p>
<p>sonal violence. No white man from a Northern State was permitted to enter

</p>
<p>THE CREEK DIFFICULTIES.
</p>
<p>The immense tracts of lands held in Georgia, Alabama, Flo-
</p>
<p>rida and Mississippi by the Creeks, Choctaws, Chicksaw and
</p>
<p>Cherokee Indians, proved, for awhile, a source of much anxie-
</p>
<p>ty to Government. " Eeservations" guaranteed by solemn
</p>
<p>treaty to the Indians, in the various Southern and Western
</p>
<p>States, embraced immense bodies of choice land, up to a com-
</p>
<p>paratively recent period. Solemn treaties secured to the sav-
</p>
<p>ages (and promised protection from all infringements by the
</p>
<p>whites on their domains) territories as follows :  In Georgia,
</p>
<p>nine and a half millions of acres ; in Alabama, seven and a
</p>
<p>half millions ; in Mississippi, fifteen and three-quarter millions ;
</p>
<p>in the Territory of Florida, four millions ; in the Territory of
</p>
<p>Arkansas, fifteen and a half millions ; in the State of Missouri,
</p>
<p>two millions and three-quarters ; in .Indiana and Illinois, fif-
</p>
<p>teen millions, and in Michigan, east of the lake, seven mil-
</p>
<p>lions.
</p>
<p>The "march of civilization" soon compassed these reserva
</p>
<p>tions with white settlements, and, as a matter of course, trouble
</p>
<p>followed. Encroachments would be made by the whites, cov-
</p>
<p>etous of the land or of its game. Indians would murder the
</p>
<p>whites and give the State authorities and the General Govern-
</p>
<p>ment plenty to do to keep them in bounds. So great became
</p>
<p>anxiety in the Southern States named, to get rid of the
</p>
<p>aborigines, that their State Legislatures demanded of Govern-
</p>
<p>ment the entire removal of the red-men from their midst to
</p>
<p>unsettled Territories around the head waters of the Arkansas
</p>
<p>river. Georgia made her demand peremptorily, since she held
</p>
<p>the Federal Government bound by a compact to relieve her.

<p>This compact stipulated that, in consideration of Georgia relin

</p>
<p>quishing her title and claims to the Mississippi Territory, the
</p>
<p>General Government would extinguish Indian titles to lands
</p>
<p>within her confines, "whenever it could be peaceably done on
</p>
<p>reasonable terms." After making that agreement Government
</p>
<p>succeeded in extinguishing the title to about fifteen million
</p>
<p>acres, and conveyed the same to the State of Georgia. There
</p>
<p>still remained 9,537,000 acres in possession of the Indians, of
</p>
<p>which 5,292,000 acres belonged to the Cherokees and the re-
</p>
<p>mainder to the Creek nation. Shortly before the termination
</p>
<p>of Mr. Monroe's administration, Georgia became very urgent
</p>
<p>for an entire removal of the Indians.
</p>
<p>Delegates from the Cherokees were in Washington during
</p>
<p>March, 1824, to arrange matters in dispute. Their pretensions
</p>
<p>to the rights of civilized usage as embassadors much excited
</p>
<p>the Georgia members in Congress, and they seized the occasion
</p>
<p>not only to enter their protest against the mission of the barba-
</p>
<p>rians, but to make a formal demand upon Government for it to
</p>
<p>fulfil its treaty obligations. The Georgians spoke peremptori-
</p>
<p>ly, and called forth from the President, James Monroe, and
</p>
<p>John C. Calhoun, Secretary of War, communications designed
</p>
<p>to set the matter before the public in its true light. Said Cal-
</p>
<p>houn:
</p>
<p>" In fulfilment of the stipulations of the 4th article (of the
</p>
<p>convention of 1802) with Georgia, there have been held seven
</p>
<p>treaties with the Creeks and Cherokees ; of which five were
</p>
<p>with the former  two previous to the war with Great Britain
</p>
<p>(1812) and three since. By the two first named there were
</p>
<p>ceded to Georgia 2,713,890 acres, and by the three last named
</p>
<p>11,735,590 acres altogether 14,748,690 acres. With the Che-
</p>
<p>rokees there have been held two treaties  both since the late
</p>
<p>war  by which Georgia has acquired 995,810 acres, which, ad-
</p>
<p>ded to that acquired by treaties with the Creeks, make 15,744,-
</p>
<p>000 acres that have been ceded to Georgia, since the date of
</p>
<p>the convention, in fulfilment of its stipulations.

<p>"In acquiring these cessions for the State of Georgia, the

</p>
<p>1819  which lands estimated at the minimum price of the
</p>
<p>public lands would make $1,244,147.50. If to these we add
</p>
<p>the sum of $1,250,000 paid to Georgia under the convention,
</p>
<p>and $4,282,151.12^ paid to the Yazoo claimants, it will be

<p>found that the United States have already paid, under the coii
</p>
<p>vention, $7,735,243.52^  which does not include any portion
</p>
<p>of the expenses of the Creek war, by which upwards of seven
</p>
<p>millions of acres were acquired to the State of Georgia." *
</p>
<p>But, despite this showing, Georgia was resolved to have all her
</p>
<p>" rights" under the convention of 1802 ; and, at the solicitation
</p>
<p>of her Governor, two Commissioners were appointed to make a
</p>
<p>treaty with the Creeks for the purchase of their lands. This
</p>
<p>treaty was negotiated on the 12th of Feb., 1825, the famous
</p>
<p>Chief, General William Mcintosh signing it in presence of Mr.
</p>
<p>Crowell, United States Indian Agent, by which all the Creek
</p>
<p>country and several millions of acres in Alabama were ceded
</p>
<p>to the United States. Complaints followed it to Washington
</p>
<p>as having been concluded by Mcintosh without any authority
</p>
<p>from the nation. The ratification of this treaty was opposed in
</p>
<p>Congress, but was finally carried by the strong vote of thirty-
</p>
<p>four to four. This sanction on reaching the ears of the discon-
</p>
<p>tented Creeks produced great excitement. A secret council
</p>
<p>of the nation being called, they resolved not to abide by the
</p>
<p>cession. The death of Mcintosh was determined on ; and, on
</p>
<p>the 30th of April, his house was surrounded by a party, who
</p>
<p>shot him together with another chief, and burned his premises.
</p>
<p>This aroused the State authorities to a determined course, and
</p>
<p>Georgia resolved to take possession of the lands by force.
</p>
<p>Troops were called out to sustain her claims. By this act the
</p>
<p>State opened a controversy with the General Government,
</p>
<p>which was bound by treaty and good faith to protect the Indians
</p>
<p>in their just rights.

<p>subject a matter of early examination, and became convinced
</p>
<p>that the Indians were right  that tLie treaty, as they represent-

<p>ed, had been made by Mcintosh without authority, and there-
</p>
<p>fore that the enforcement of its provisions ought not to be urged.
</p>
<p>As Georgia had called out troops to force the savages into an
</p>
<p>acceptance and fulfillment of the cession, it only remained for
</p>
<p>the President to order a Federal force to the confines of the
</p>
<p>reservation to protect the Indians. This step aroused not only
</p>
<p>Georgia, but also the adjoining States, who were prepared, with
</p>
<p>troops and money, to assist Georgia " against the Government
</p>
<p>and the Indians.!'
</p>
<p>To avoid the hazard of war, Mr. Adams succeeded in gath-
</p>
<p>ering at Washington, in January, 1826, the head men and re-
</p>
<p>sponsible representatives of the Creeks, and concluded a new
</p>
<p>treaty, which was substituted for the old one, whereby all their
</p>
<p>lands in Georgia were ceded, but none in Alabama. Notwith-
</p>
<p>standing opposition, from the Georgia delegation in Congress,
</p>
<p>this treaty was ratified by the Senate at the ensuing session by
</p>
<p>a vote of thirty to seven, and appropriations were made by the

<p>House of Eepresentatives by a vote of one hundred and sixty-
</p>
<p>seven to ten. The treaty was faithfully observed by the In-
</p>
<p>dians, and Georgia became possessed of their valuable land,
</p>
<p>after waiting a quarter of a century for Government to fulfill
</p>
<p>its agreement (made in 1802). At a later day the Cherokees'

<p>title was extinguished in Alabama, though their removal to

</p>
<p>THE SOUTHAMPTON SLAYE INSURRECTIOK
</p>
<p>The insurrection in Southampton County, Virginia, in Au-
</p>
<p>gust, 1831, headed by Nat Turner, was not, like the South
</p>
<p>Carolina uprising, the result of a carefully elaborated plot. It
</p>
<p>was the result of one night's conference in the woods, of seven
</p>
<p>black men, who proceeded to the work of slaughter almost as
</p>
<p>soon as it was determined upon and its first steps arranged. In
</p>
<p>this respect it was calculated to inspire more apprehension
</p>
<p>among slave owners, since, if one bold spirit could, at any mo-
</p>
<p>ment, so inflame the savage instincts of the African as to impel
</p>
<p>him to murder, where was the safety in his presence ? Like
</p>
<p>Vesey's plot, however. Turner's bloody revolt was conceived
</p>
<p>in religious enthusiasm, and the black murderers became, in
</p>
<p>their frenzy, ministers of divine vengeance, slaying women and
</p>
<p>children even while tbey regretted its necessity. In this
</p>
<p>religious aspect both insurrections deserve more consideration
</p>
<p>than has been given them by writers and thinkers. It is a
</p>
<p>matter of surprise that, since religious impressions and a knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of the Bible proved so inflamatory, the Southern Legisla-
</p>
<p>tures did not forbid even the shadow of a missionary to darken
</p>
<p>their lands, and did not formally banish the Holy Word as a
</p>
<p>dangerous agent in a slave's hands. But, the surprise is les-
</p>
<p>sened when we reflect that, in Virginia as well as in South
</p>
<p>Carolina, it was a states' prison offense to learn slaves to read ;
</p>
<p>and the further fact that such "religious instruction" was pro-
</p>
<p>vided for the black as impressed him with proper ideas of his
</p>
<p>own unworthiness, renders it apparent that all steps practicallj

<p>B94: INSURRECTION OF NAT TURNER.
</p>
<p>oecessary to keep the African a barbarian not only were taken
</p>
<p>but were enforced.
</p>
<p>Nat Turner, like Denmark Vesey, was a religions devotee
</p>
<p>who had "a work to do." "He had, by his own account,"
</p>
<p>says the authority before us, "felt himself singled out from
</p>
<p>childhood for some great work ; and he had some peculiar
</p>
<p>marks on his person, which, joined to his great mental preco-
</p>
<p>city, were enough to occasion, among his youthful companions,
</p>
<p>a superstitious faith in his gifts and destiny. He had great
</p>
<p>mechanical ingenuity also, experimentalized very early in
</p>
<p>making paper, gunpowder, pottery, and in other arts, which, in
</p>
<p>later life, he was found thoroughly to understand. His moral
</p>
<p>faculties were very strong ; white witnesses admitted that he
</p>
<p>had never been known to swear an oath, to drink a drop of
</p>
<p>spirits, or to commit a theft ! And, in general, so marked were
</p>
<p>his early peculiarities, that people said ' he had too much sense
</p>
<p>to be raised, and if he was, he would never be of any use as a
</p>
<p>slave.' This impression of personal destiny grew with his
</p>
<p>growth  he fasted, prayed, preached, read the Bible, heard
</p>
<p>voices when he walked behind his j)lough, and communicated
</p>
<p>his revelations to the awe- struck slaves. They told him in re-
</p>
<p>turn, that, ' if they had his sense, they would not serve any
</p>
<p>master in the world.' "'
</p>
<p>It would appear, indeed, that the man was extraordinarily
</p>
<p>endowed with the religious " power" which makes men apostles
</p>
<p>and martyrs, or which, if allowed free scope, renders them great
</p>
<p>as expounders of the truth. Had Turner lived in a congenial
</p>
<p>atmosphere he must have become a veritable Martin Luther
</p>
<p>among his race. As it was he was only a slave  the property
</p>
<p>of a white man ; and while he faithfully performed the offices
</p>
<p>of a slave his soul held converse with such spirits as could
</p>
<p>penetrate the darkness of his benighted life. His " confession,"
</p>
<p>made after arrest and sentence of death, is a remarkable evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the spiritual sympathy which swayed his entire being.

</p>
<p>Just prior to the year of the insurrection he had a special sea-
</p>
<p>son of religious experience, in which he spoke with such power
</p>
<p>as to make a convert of a white man named Brantly, whom he
</p>
<p>baptised by immersion. He said, referring to that event : " I
</p>
<p>turner's holy vision. 395
</p>
<p>told these things to a white man, on whom it had a wonderful
</p>
<p>effect, and he ceased from his wickedness, and was attacked
</p>
<p>immediately with a cutaneous eruption, and the blood oozed
</p>
<p>from the pores of his skin, and after praying and fasting nine
</p>
<p>days he was healed. And the Spirit appeared to me again,
</p>
<p>and said, as the Savior had been baptized, so should we be
</p>
<p>also ; and when the white people would not let us be baptized
</p>
<p>by the Church, we went down into the water together, in the
</p>
<p>sight of many who reviled us, and were baptized by the Spirit.
</p>
<p>After this I rejoiced greatly and gave thanks to God."
</p>
<p>This certainly does not savor of blood-thirstiness, yet the
</p>
<p>very enthusiasm here recorded impelled the devotee to his
</p>
<p>work of slaughter. As he neared the year of his tragedy
</p>
<p>Turner's fervor increased. He beheld in the sky black and
</p>
<p>white spirits contending, like the hosts of Gabriel and Satan,
</p>
<p>for supremacy ; at the awful conflict the scene became darken-
</p>
<p>ed, the heavens flashed fire and thunder filled the infinite
</p>
<p>spaces with dismal echoes. " And the Holy Ghost," he said,
</p>
<p>" was with me and said : * Behold me as I stand in the heavens !'
</p>
<p>And I looked and saw the forms of men in different attitudes.
</p>
<p>And there were lights in the sky, to which the children of
</p>
<p>darkness gave other names than what they really were ; for
</p>
<p>they were the lights of the Savior's hands, stretched forth from
</p>
<p>east to west, even as they were extended on the cross on Cal-
</p>
<p>vary, for the redemption of sinners." On the corn he saw
</p>
<p>drops of blood  Christ's blood, a witness of the work to be
</p>
<p>done ; on the leaves in the forest he discovered signs, symbols
</p>
<p>similar to those revealed to his vision in the skies. Finally
</p>
<p>the Holy Spirit appeared to him. May 12th, 1828, to announce
</p>
<p>that the mission of the Savior would fall upon him, and, when
</p>
<p>the sign appeared in the heavens, indicated by Eevelation, he
</p>
<p>must begin his struggle with the Serpent. That sign was given
</p>
<p>in an eclipse of the sun, in February, 1831. This call he must
</p>
<p>obey. He set about preparing himself to slay and destroy the

<p>white host until the land was regenerated. Then, also, the

<p>seal of secrecy was broken and he was permitted to call to his
</p>
<p>aid those who seemed marked as apostles in the crusade. This

<p>396 INSUHRECTIONOFXATTUKNER.
</p>
<p>was the incipience of that terrible " work" which startled the
</p>
<p>whole country with its human sacrifice.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, August 21st, 1831, six slaves met in the wooda
</p>
<p>of the plantation of Joseph Travis, ostensibly for a barbecue.
</p>
<p>The plantation was located in Southampton County, Virginia,
</p>
<p>in the neighborhood known as Cross Keys, fifteen miles from
</p>
<p>Jerusalem C. H. and as far from Petersburg. These six men
</p>
<p>awaited the coming of a seventh, who made his appearance
</p>
<p>during the afternoon, when the roast pig was ready. His de-
</p>
<p>meanor, and the deference shown to him, indicated him as the
</p>
<p>man to lead. He was a dark mulatto, in the very prime of
</p>
<p>life, powerfully built in frame, with strongly marked African
</p>
<p>features, and a face indicative of intelligence and resolution.
</p>
<p>It was Nat Turner. Observing two negroes more than he had
</p>
<p>ordered to the tryst, he demanded to know why they \^^ere
</p>
<p>there? One of them, named Will, answered with a quick re-
</p>
<p>sponse, that his life was worth no more than that of others,
</p>
<p>and that his liberty was as dear to him. Hark, one of the
</p>
<p>chosen four, answered for the other negro, named Jack, and the
</p>
<p>conference proceeded with much solemnity, as the roast pig
</p>
<p>was eaten. Turner harangued the men in his earnest, moving
</p>
<p>rhetoric, depicting the wretchedness of the negroes' lot, and
</p>
<p>proving by Scripture that he was called to disenthrall. All
</p>
<p>conceded the truth of his assumption and declared themselves
</p>
<p>ready for the work. For many hours the conference continued,
</p>
<p>and the Conspirators discussed the details of their movements.
</p>
<p>"One can imagine," says the writer in the Atlantic MonVihj,
</p>
<p>" those terrible dusky faces, beneath the funereal woods, and
</p>
<p>amid the flickering of pine knot torches, preparing that stern
</p>
<p>revenge whose shuddering echoes should ring through the land
</p>
<p>so long." Night was well advanced when at length the last
</p>
<p>words were spoken, and the seven proceeded on their mission
</p>
<p>of murder. "It was agreed," said Turner in his confession,
</p>
<p>" that we should commence at home on that night, and, until

<p>then retreat, if necessary, to the Dismal Swamp," wliichi was
</p>
<p>about twenty-five miles away, and in whose fastnesses the
</p>
<p>blacks supposed they could find security. They counted, how-
</p>
<p>ever, upon success, by the flocking of slaves to their stand-
</p>
<p>ard. Turner also had vague ideas of a Black Eepublic to be
</p>
<p>formed in that vicinity, where the negroes would dwell in
</p>
<p>peace, and whose country should become the refuge of all
</p>
<p>runaway slaves. It was a wild, inconsiderate, illy-defined plan,
</p>
<p>showing but little of judgment or just apprehension of results.
</p>
<p>Surrounded upon all sides by considerable towns, whose in-
</p>
<p>habitants would turn out to a man to meet the insurrectionists
</p>
<p> with Fortress Monroe at calling distance, ready with men
</p>
<p>and artillery to sweep away whole ranks of half armed and not
</p>
<p>half led slaves  what hope of success could any sane mind
</p>
<p>have entertained ? Turner was a religious fanatic  he was
</p>
<p>not sane ; his plans were those of a dreamer, and, like all cre-
</p>
<p>ations of frenzy and ignorance, ended in the overwhelming ruin
</p>
<p>of all concerned.
</p>
<p>Says the writer already referred to, regarding that night's
</p>
<p>work : " Swift and stealthy as Indians, the black men passed
</p>
<p>from house to house  not pausing, not hesitating, as their ter-
</p>
<p>riiyie work went on. In one thing they were humaner than
</p>
<p>Intlians or than white men fighting against Indians  there was
</p>
<p>no gratuitous outrage beyond the death-blow itself, no insult,
</p>
<p>no mutilation ; but in every house they entered, that blow fell
</p>
<p>on man, woman and child  nothing that had a white skin was
</p>
<p>spared. From every house they took arms and ammunition,
</p>
<p>and from a few, money ; on every plantation they found re-
</p>
<p>cruits : those dusky slaves, so obsequious to their master the
</p>
<p>day before, so prompt to sing and dance before his Northern
</p>
<p>visitors, were all swift to transform themselves into fiends of
</p>
<p>retribution now ; show them sword or musket and they grasp-
</p>
<p>ed it, though it were an heirloom from Washington himself
</p>
<p>The troop increased from house to house  first to fifteen, then

</p>
<p>to forty, then to sixty. Some were armed with muskets, some
</p>
<p>with axes, some with scythes; some came on their masters'
</p>
<p>horses. As the number increased they could be divided, and
</p>
<p>the awful work was carried on more rapidly still. The plan

</p>
<p>tten was for an advanced guard of horsemen to approacli each
</p>
<p>house at a gallop, and surround it till the others came up.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile what agonies of terror must have taken place with-
</p>
<p>in, shared alike by innocent and by guilty ! what memories of
</p>
<p>wrongs inflicted on those dusky creatures by some  what in-
</p>
<p>nocent participation by others, in the penance ! The outbreak
</p>
<p>lasted for but forty-eight hours ; but during that period fifty-
</p>
<p>five whites were slain, without the loss of a single slave."
</p>
<p>It was truly a reign of terror, before which the whites fled
</p>
<p>in uncontrollable dismay, abandoning homes and property in
</p>
<p>the one desire to shut out from their eyes the very sight of
</p>
<p>the vengeful blacks. Seeing this comparatively slow progress
</p>
<p>of his butchery, and realizing that the alarm must, ere long,
</p>
<p>bring the whites from other districts upon him. Turner resolv-
</p>
<p>ed to strike out for Jerusalem, the county town, where he
</p>
<p>should be able to intercept fugitives and cut off communica-
</p>
<p>tion with Norfolk and Fortress Monroe. With a strong body
</p>
<p>of mounted men he hurried on imtil within three miles of the
</p>
<p>Court House, when, passing the plantation of a Mr. Parker, the
</p>
<p>men desired to stop to enlist his negroes and to murder the
</p>
<p>whites. Turner remonstrated against this delay, but, upon the
</p>
<p>promise of expedition, he halted his troop and permitted about
</p>
<p>half of them to go up the lane to the house, one-half mile away.
</p>
<p>The halt, as Turner had feared, proved disastrous. Those
</p>
<p>dispatched to the mansion were gone so long that Turner at
</p>
<p>length followed after, to hasten their movements. His own
</p>
<p>absence left the band without a leader. Eighteen mounted
</p>
<p>white men rode up, dispersed the negroes at the road gate,
</p>
<p>pressed on up to the house and confronted the entire body of
</p>
<p>blacks. The white 'men dismounted, and, advancing under
</p>
<p>cover, sent a volley of balls and buck-shot into the insurrec-
</p>
<p>tionists' ranks. This the negroes immediately returned, when
</p>
<p>their masters broke and ran, the blacks pursuing. A fresh
</p>
<p>band of whites coming up at that moment from Jerusalem

</p>
<p>stayed the pursuit, and compelled the slaves, in turn, to break
</p>
<p>and run. Those on foot soon scattered, leaving Turner, with
</p>
<p>about twenty mounted confederates. With these he determin-
</p>
<p>ed to hold his ground, counting upon recruits enough to ena-

<p>SPERSION OF THE INSURGENTS. 401
</p>
<p>ble liim to pusli on, A large number gathered, but, at some
</p>
<p>alarm, most of them again scattered. Not dismayed, the reso-
</p>
<p>lute leader pressed on, at daylight, to the house of Dr. Blunt,
</p>
<p>in order to enlist his men. Here the insurrectionists were most
</p>
<p>unexpectedly checked. The Doctor had armed his slaves and
</p>
<p>- Turner's troop was met by a fire from the house which drove
</p>
<p>them off. Soon a company of whites appeared, and sent such
</p>
<p>a volley into the insurgent band as proved its destruction. It
</p>
<p>broke ere long into fragments, and the insurrection, for the
</p>
<p>moment, was at an end. Turner, after arranging to meet his
</p>
<p>most trusted coadjutors in the woods where the first conference
</p>
<p>had been held, ordered the entire dispersion of his dusky guard
</p>
<p>The murderers vanished from sight, every man of them return-
</p>
<p>ing to his own home as if no blood had stained his hands.
</p>
<p>The day passed and Nat proceeded to the rendezvous. All
</p>
<p>night long he waited yet not a man appeared. What a night
</p>
<p>it must have been for that turbulent spirit ! But, he was not
</p>
<p>dispirited. All day long he kept his hiding place, hoping that
</p>
<p>another night would gather, at least, his trusted friends  Hark,
</p>
<p>Dred, Will, Hercules, Nelson and Sam. Another night in
</p>
<p>those dreary solitudes, waiting and hoping in vain ! Not a
</p>
<p>footstep broke the stillness  not a moving form made the
</p>
<p>shadows of the forest less lifeless and oppressive. It then was
</p>
<p>apparent that his movement was a failure, and that even the
</p>
<p>refuge in the Dismal Swamp was denied him. The country,
</p>
<p>having had time to recover from its first paralysis, was now
</p>
<p>alive with men seeking for his blood. He resolved to tarry
</p>
<p>where he was, knowing where to procure food, and hoping
</p>
<p>that some friendly hand would offer to assist him in escape,
</p>
<p>either to the Swamp, or to the North. He therefore sought a
</p>
<p>good retreat, which he found in a pile of fence rails, out in a
</p>
<p>deserted field. Beneath these rails he dug a hole, and in that
</p>
<p>most forlorn spot he dwelt six weeks  only leaving it at night
</p>
<p>for food and drink. It was at once his dwelling, his arsenal

<p>and his meeting house.
</p>
<p>Thus far the direct fortunes of Turner. We must now turn
</p>
<p>to trace the secondary results of his revolt. Eumors spread
</p>
<p>with mysterious rapidity all over the land, magnifying events,

<p>402 IISrsURRECTION OF NAT TURNER.
</p>
<p>until the insurrection assumed most gigantic dimensions.
</p>
<p>It reached Eichmond to strike such terror among all classes as
</p>
<p>to render them incapable of aid. To arm for defense^ was their
</p>
<p>only thought. So in all other towns of Southern Virginia and
</p>
<p>Northern North Carolina  not a body of military could be put
</p>
<p>into the field until the danger had passed. United States troops
</p>
<p>from Fortress Monroe were the first in responding to the call
</p>
<p>for help. Colonel House, then in command, sent forward three
</p>
<p>companies of light artillery under Lieutenant-Colonel Worth.
</p>
<p>  dispatching them by steamer to Suffolk. Detachments
</p>
<p>of marines and sailors from the U. S. sloops-of-war Warren and
</p>
<p>Natchez were added to this force, making it about eight hun-
</p>
<p>dred strong. These were first on the ground, and, alone,
</p>
<p>would have mastered almost any number of insurgents. But,
</p>
<p>rumor had so magnified the revolt, in its character and the
</p>
<p>numbers engaged, that, not only were the Virginia and North
</p>
<p>Carolina militia called to arms, but distant cities volunteered
</p>
<p> New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and even New London,
</p>
<p>Connecticut, all ofiering military aid. The militia soon were
</p>
<p>on duty, and such duty as they performed has stained the page
</p>
<p>of Virginia's history. They murdered black men, almost in-
</p>
<p>discriminately, in Southampton County. "It was," said a
</p>
<p>member of the House of Delegates, " with the utmost difficulty
</p>
<p>and at the hazard of personal popularity and esteem, that the
</p>
<p>coolest and most judicious among us could exert an influence
</p>
<p>sufficient to restrain an indiscriminate slaughter of ihe blacks
</p>
<p>who were suspected." A letter from a clergyman on the spot
</p>
<p>said : " There are thousands of troops searching in every direc-
</p>
<p>tion, and many negroes are killed every day : the exact num-
</p>
<p>ber will never be ascertained." The magazine writer hereto-
</p>
<p>fore quoted from, says :
</p>
<p>"Men were tortured to death, burned, maimed, and subjected to
</p>
<p>namelete atrocities. The overseers were called on to point out any
</p>
<p>slaves whom they distrusted, and if any tried to escape, they were

</p>
<p>shot down. Nay, worse than this. A party of horsemen started from
</p>
<p>Kichmoud with the intention of killing every colored jjerson they
</p>
<p>saw in Southampton County. They stopped ojjposite the cabin of a
</p>
<p>free colored man, who was hoeing in his little iield. They called
</p>
<p>out, 'Is this Southampton County?' He replied, 'Yes, Sir, you have
</p>
<p>INCIDENTS OF THE UPRISING. 403
</p>
<p>just crossed the line, by yonder tree.' They shot him dead and rode
</p>
<p>on. This is from the narrative of the editor of the Richmond Whig,
</p>
<p>who was then on duty in the militia, and protested manfully against
</p>
<p>those outrages. ' Some of these scenes,' he adds, ' are hardly inferior
</p>
<p>in barbarity to the atrocities of the insurgents.' "
</p>
<p>Indeed, many evidences, both public and private, exist
</p>
<p>M^bicli demonstrate the sanguinary and cruel nature of that re-
</p>
<p>tal i ation. Masters presented claims for compensation for slaves
</p>
<p>killed to the number of over one hundred ; nor was it until
</p>
<p>slave owners had resolved to shoot down any unauthorised
</p>
<p>white " patrol" found on their premises, that the slaughter was
</p>
<p>stayed. Not a few of these self-constituted guardians of the
</p>
<p>peace made it a boast that they had killed their share of " nig-
</p>
<p>gers." Some very affecting incidents of devotion are recorded
</p>
<p>in the annals of the day, one of which we must be permitted
</p>
<p>to repeat : "In the hunt which followed the massacre, a slave
</p>
<p>holder went into the woods, accompanied by a faithful slave,
</p>
<p>who had been the means of saving his life during the insurrec-
</p>
<p>tion. When they had reached a retired place in the forest,
</p>
<p>the man handed his gun to his master, informing him that he
</p>
<p>could not live a slave any longer, and requesting him either to
</p>
<p>free him or shoot him on the spot. The master took the gun,
</p>
<p>in some trepidation, levelled it at the faithful negro, and shot
</p>
<p>him through the heart."
</p>
<p>The number arrested for "trial" was fifty-five, of whom sev-
</p>
<p>enteen were convicted and hanged, twelve "transported" to the
</p>
<p>South, twenty acquitted, and four free colored men held for
</p>
<p>further examination. One of the executed was Lucy, a slave
</p>
<p>woman, the property of Mr. John T. Barrows. Nor were the
</p>
<p>" trials" confined to Southampton County. Said the Governor,
</p>
<p>in his message of Dec. 8th, relating to the affair : " there is
</p>
<p>much reason to believe that the spirit of insurrection was not
</p>
<p>confined to Southampton. Many convictions have taken place
</p>
<p>elsewhere, and some few in distant counties." But, nothing

<p>appears in Turner's "Confession,^ nor was anything elicited at
</p>
<p>the trials, to show the existence of any long premeditated and
</p>
<p>widely disseminated plot. If symptoms of insurrection were

<p>exhibited at other points it was simply because the slaves were

</p>
<p>ripe for revolt. News of Turner's success would have fired a
</p>
<p>train that led over the entire South, and in every black
</p>
<p>man's breast would have been found a magazine. The wonder
</p>
<p>is that so few actual explosions occurred. Had the black en-
</p>
<p>thusiast entered Jerusalem, and secured its stores of arms and
</p>
<p>money, Nat Turner's insurrection would have ended only by
</p>
<p>a general slaughter of slaves, in that region at least.
</p>
<p>To return to the pile of rails. For six weeks it gave shelter
</p>
<p>to the outlaw. Despite the most vigilant search he eluded all
</p>
<p>observation. Large rewards were offered for his capture and
</p>
<p>hundreds of men swarmed over the country in hope of se
</p>
<p>curing the prize. Every few days an announcement of his
</p>
<p>capture would be made, but, Nat Turner was not forthcoming :
</p>
<p>those eager for his blood were not yet gratified with an extem-
</p>
<p>porized gallows scene nor a burning at the stake. A dog at
</p>
<p>length proved the fugitive's ruin  or, rather, the provisions
</p>
<p>which Nat had secreted in his hole wrought the calamity. The
</p>
<p>animal, smelling the meat, made such a noise over the rail
</p>
<p>pile as to attract thither a party out on the search. Discovery
</p>
<p>at once followed (October 15th). Turner emerged from his
</p>
<p>cave like Lucifer from the bowels of the earth, and created
</p>
<p>quite as much consternation as if he had been that fallen poten-
</p>
<p>tate. The whole party fled in amazement, while Turner fled
</p>
<p>in the opposite direction, eluding pursuit. For ten days long-
</p>
<p>er he remained hidden in a wheat stack, although hundreds
</p>
<p>of men were scouring, and closely inspecting, every rood of
</p>
<p>land in that vicinity. Here he began to despair, and hope so
</p>
<p>far deserted him that he resolved upon surrender. One night
</p>
<p>he walked within two miles of Jerusalem, to place himself in
</p>
<p>the Sheriff's hands, but retraced his steps, safely passing the
</p>
<p>patrol established along the whole route. But, these days and
</p>
<p>nights of ceaseless watchfulness wore out even his iron frame,
</p>
<p>and he became haggard almost to insanity. His usual caution
</p>
<p>seems to have deserted him, Sor he was discovered by the own-

<p>er of the stacks (October 25th), who discharged a load of buck
</p>
<p>shot at him. Nat fell to the earth and thus escaped death,
</p>
<p>though twelve of the shot riddled his hat. He again fled, and,
</p>
<p>astonishing as it may seem, succeeded in making his escape.
</p>
<p>TU knee's captuke. 405
</p>
<p>Jfor five days longer the entire population, witli many n(;groes,
</p>
<p>were on his track, but failed to discover his person. October
</p>
<p>80th was his last day of savage freedom. A white man named
</p>
<p>Phipps, out on patrol, was passing an old pine clearing, when
</p>
<p>he beheld motion among the dry boughs. Stopping to watch
</p>
<p>he quickly discovered the fugitive's wild face and glaring eyes,
</p>
<p>emerging from a hole beneath the brush. Phipps, bringing
</p>
<p>his shot gun to bear, called out for Turner to surrender. Ex-
</p>
<p>hausted as he was with privation, and armed only with a sword,
</p>
<p>he could offer but little resistance. Even to have overcome
</p>
<p>the patrol would have been but to encounter others close at
</p>
<p>hand. He quietly submitted to be bound and was marched
</p>
<p>off to the nearest house.
</p>
<p>News of the capture flew on the wings of the wind, causing
</p>
<p>great rejoicing. Governor Floyd announced the fact in the
</p>
<p>Richmond Enquirer, with gratulations at the auspicious event.
</p>
<p>He was with difficulty saved from the fury of the m.ob who
</p>
<p>had determined to roast him alive. But, anxious to ferret out
</p>
<p>the history of the insurrection, leading citizens preferred to save
</p>
<p>him for trial ; escorted by a strong guard he was lodged in the
</p>
<p>county jail at Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>His end approached rapidly. Says the Atlantic writer:
</p>
<p>" When asked by Mr. T. R Gray, the counsel assigned him,
</p>
<p>whether, although defeated, he still believed in his own Provi-
</p>
<p>dential mission, he answered as simply as one who came thirty
</p>
<p>years after him, ' Was not Christ crucified ? ' In the same
</p>
<p>spirit, when arraigned before the court, he answered, ' Not
</p>
<p>guilty,' saying to his counsel that he did not feel so. But ap-
</p>
<p>parently no argument was made in his favor by his counsel,
</p>
<p>nor were any witnesses called  he being convicted on the tes-
</p>
<p>timony of Levi Waller, and upon his own confession, which
</p>
<p>was put in by Mr. Gray, and acknowledged by the prisoner
</p>
<p>before the six justices composing the court, as being 'full, free,
</p>
<p>and voluntary.' He was therefore placed in the paradoxical

</p>
<p>position of conviction by his own confession, under a plea of
</p>
<p>'Not guilty.' The arrest took place on the thirtieth of Octo-
</p>
<p>ber, 1831, the confession on the first of November, the trial
</p>
<p>and conviction on the fifth, and the execution on the following

<p>Frida}'', tlie eleventb of November, precisely at noon. He met
</p>
<p>his death with perfect composure, declined addressing the
</p>
<p>multitude assembled, and told the Sheriff in a firm voice that
</p>
<p>he was ready. Another account says that he ' betraj^ed no
</p>
<p>emotion, and even hurried the executioner in the performance
</p>
<p>of his duty.' Not a limb nor a muscle was observed to move.
</p>
<p>His body, after his death, was given over to the surgeons for
</p>
<p>dissection."
</p>
<p>The confession here mentioned was made by Turner to his
</p>
<p>counsel and was published by Mr. Gray's authority in Balti-
</p>
<p>more. Fifty thousand copies, it is stated, were disposed of 
</p>
<p>an alarming fact, in the estimation of the pro-slave press  one
</p>
<p>of which called upon grand juries generally, where a copy of
</p>
<p>the publication was found, to indict Mr. Gray. The presump-
</p>
<p>tion was that it "would only serve to rouse up other leaders."
</p>
<p>Here, again, the greatness of the crime of allowing negroes to
</p>
<p>read was made manifest. After that day for a negro to be
</p>
<p>caught conning over a spelling book was to devote his bare
</p>
<p>back to the lash. The pamphlet was partially reprinted in
</p>
<p>New York, but, of the original fifty thousand, only one is
</p>

<p>and from the character of the culprit, a remarkable document.

<p>Said Mr. Gray : " I shall not attempt to describe the effect of

<p>his narrative, as told and commented on by himself, in the

<p>condemned-hole of the prison. The calm, deliberate compos-

<p>still bearing the stains of the blood of helpless innocence about

<p>him, clothed with rags and covered with chains, yet daring to

<p>raise his manacled hands to heaven, with a spirit soaring above

<p>float before the vision : it is all in vain. Nat Turner and old
</p>
<p>John Brown rise up like the fabled Nemeses, or the ghosts of
</p>
<p>Odin's bards, to fill their enemies' souls with an awe which
</p>
<p>generations will not allaj.
</p>
<p>The events of this terrible insurrection were not unmarked
</p>
<p>by political excitement in the Old Dominion State. There
</p>
<p>were those among her counsellors and legislators who read the
</p>
<p>story aright, and behind the crime saw the hateful agent which
</p>
<p>prompted it. This class of persons made a stroke at the insti-
</p>
<p>tution of slavery. Said James McDowell, one of Virginia's
</p>
<p>brightest lights, in a powerful speech made in the House of
</p>
<p>Delegates, in January, 1832 :
</p>
<p>"Was that a 'petty affair' which drove families from their homes 
</p>
<p>which assembled women and children in crowds, witlioiit shelter, at
</p>
<p>places of common refuge, in every condition of weakness and infirmity,
</p>
<p>under every suffering which want and terror could inflict, yet willing to
</p>
<p>endure all, willing to meet death from famine, death from climate,
</p>
<p>death from hardships, preferring anything rather than the horrors of
</p>
<p>meeting it from a domestic assassin ? Was that a ' petty affair' which
</p>
<p>erected a peaceful and coniiding jDortion of the State into a military
</p>
<p>camp  which outlawed from pity the unfortunate beings whose brothers
</p>
<p>had offended  which barred every door, penetrated every bosom with
</p>
<p>fear or suspicion  whicli so banished every sense of security from every
</p>
<p>man's dwelling, that let but a hoof or horn break upon the silence of
</p>
<p>the night, and an aching throb would be driven to the heart, the hus-
</p>
<p>band would look to his w^eapou, and the mother would shudder and
</p>
<p>weep upon her cradle ? Was it the fear of Nat Turner, and his deluded
</p>
<p>drunken handful of followers, which produced such effects ? Was it
</p>
<p>this that induced distant counties, where the very name of Southampton
</p>
<p>was strange, to arm and equip for a struggle ? iVo, Sh; it was the sus-

<p>408 INSUKRECTION OF NAT TURNER
</p>
<p>to slavery witli a tenacity quite unconquerable. As her soil
</p>
<p>became exhausted, and her resources contracted, the slave was
</p>
<p>made to contribute to the wealth of the State in a manner not
</p>
<p>contemplated by Virginians of the Eevolutionary era. The
</p>
<p>traffic in Eastern Virginia, in human flesh, from 1820, entered
</p>
<p>into her productive economy ; and, by 1830, the growing of
</p>
<p>slaves for market had assumed an importance not second to
</p>
<p>that of tobacco. In this trade the largest and the smallest es-
</p>
<p>tates participated. Another ten years witnessed the singular
</p>
<p>fact of many old and influential families living, to a great de-
</p>
<p>gree, off the human product of the negro huts.
</p>
<p>The insurrection of Turner only served to fasten the chains
</p>
<p>more firmly upon the negro race ; it deprived him of the confi-
</p>
<p>dence of the whites ; it restricted his little liberties and privi-
</p>
<p>leges ; it made the master more willing to treat his slave mere-
</p>
<p>ly as property, and to sell him as he would have sold an animal :
</p>
<p>it was a disaster to the black, from which flowed only misery

<p>THE NUlimCATM REBELLION.
</p>
<p>The conflict between the State Eights idea and the antago-
</p>
<p>nistic idea of Federal supremacy it may be said was inaugurated
</p>
<p>by Mr. Calhoun, of South Carolina. Although he conceded
</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson's resolutions of '98 to be the keystone of his po-
</p>
<p>litical system, Mr. Calhoun was the first statesman of influence
</p>
<p>who used the principles evolved by those resolutions to build
</p>
<p>up a great schism in the Federal institution. He became the
</p>
<p>representative man of a new school in politics which assumed
</p>
<p>supremacy for a State and the right of a State to nullify acts
</p>
<p>of Congress ; and he now stands forward in history as the au-
</p>
<p>thor of a system' which, so long as this Eepublic shall last,
</p>
<p>will be the opposing element to Federal consolidation and cen-
</p>
<p>tralization of power.
</p>
<p>Mr. Calhoun entered Congress in 1812, and from that time
</p>
<p>onward, for a period of forty years, was one of the controlling
</p>
<p>forces in Congress and in Executive circles. Possessing a mind
</p>
<p>of extraordinary subtlety and accumen, with great powers of
</p>
<p>physical endurance, and a resolution perfectly indomitable, he
</p>
<p>was admirably formed by nature for the part he played ; and
</p>
<p>the success which attended his efforts attest less the truth of
</p>
<p>his principles than the perseverance with which they were
</p>
<p>pressed upon the country. He sustained the war policy of
</p>
<p>Madison and it prevailed ; he opposed Dallas' scheme for a
</p>
<p> See Calhoun's Works (6 vols. Appleton & Co., 1855), vol. i., disquisition on
</p>
<p>Government. Aside from his great speech on the Force Bill, Feb. 15th, 1832, and
</p>
<p>Ills reply to Webster, Feb. 2Gth, 1832, his Letter to Governor Hammond, of South
</p>
<p>Carolina, August 2Sth, 1832, as well as his " Address to the People of South Caro-
</p>

</p>
<p>tion and Government. The essay above mentioned, and the four efforts here

</p>
<p>and it was accepted; opposed all tariffs as nnconstitutional,
</p>
<p>except Hamilton's tariif of a revenue, and, after a struggle of
</p>
<p>sixteen years [1816-1832] witnessed the practical triumph of
</p>
<p>his opposition ; he opposed as unconstitutional the principle
</p>
<p>of internal improvements by the General Government, and
</p>
<p>lived to behold the success of his labors against that system ;
</p>
<p>he aimed at the Presidency and served as "Vice President for
</p>
<p>two terms, and must have been President but for the over-
</p>
<p>mastering influence of Andrew Jackson; he espoused the
</p>
<p>cause of State Eights in a direct issue with the General Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, and, despite the superhuman exertions made to crush
</p>
<p>the movement inaugurated by him for nullification, he had the
</p>
<p>pleasure of forcing from Congress such concessions as placed
</p>
<p>his principles on a Jirm footing ; scorning the Missouri Com-
</p>
<p>promise, and demanding the rights of the South to introduce
</p>
<p>slavery in the Territories, he lived to see the movement initi-
</p>
<p>ated which ended in the overthrow of that solemn contract, and
</p>
<p>the opening of the Territories to the South on the "Squatter
</p>
<p>Sovereignty" plan : work enough, truly for one man, and suc-
</p>
<p>cess enough to satisfy any other ambition than that which John
</p>
<p>C. Calhoun cherished. He only failed to disintegrate tlie
</p>
<p>Union, or to ingraft upon our Constitution the novel feature
</p>
<p>of a dual executive, which should secure to the Slave States
</p>
<p>one half of the Executive, with veto power, &c. But, his prin-
</p>
<p>ciples survived their master dii-ector; and, had he lived ten
</p>
<p>years more, his eager soul would have been gladdened by the
</p>
<p>secession of the Southern States according to his plans pro-
</p>
<p>posed and acted upon in 1831-2. Hence his life must be pro-
</p>
<p>nounced a gigantic success, when viewed by its results. Tl)at
</p>
<p>these results were triumphs of evil over good we are not pre-
</p>
<p>pared to assume ; but, that the fruits of his doctrines have
</p>
<p>been pernicious to the order, stability and humanitarian spirit
</p>
<p>of the Great Kepublic, is not now a matter of debate among

<p>a paramount duty.
</p>
<p>The introduction to Congress of Henry Clay's tariff of 1824,
</p>
<p>was the source of much feeling throughout the South. That

<p>section being almost purely agricultural, and a heavy consum-
</p>
<p>er of imported goods, felt aggrieved at duties which increased
</p>
<p>the cost of living without offering any adequate return. It was
</p>
<p>regarded as a measure to build up the commercial and manu-
</p>
<p>facturing North, and, by Mr. Calhoun, was also condemned as
</p>
<p>clearly unconstitutional. 1 The excuse urged for its adoption
</p>
<p>was the prostrate condition of the country's finances and ener-
</p>
<p>gies, "indicated," Clay said, in his elaborate speech sustaining
</p>
<p>the new impositions (March 31st, 1824), " by the diminished
</p>
<p>exports of native produce ; by the depressed and reduced state
</p>
<p>of our foreign navigation ; by our diminished commerce ; by
</p>
<p>successive unthrashed crops of grain perishing in our barns
</p>
<p>and barn -yards for the want of a market; by the alarming
</p>
<p>diminution of the circulating medium ; by the numerous bank-
</p>
<p>ruptcies, not limited to the trading classes, but extending to all
</p>
<p>orders of society ; by a universal complaint of the want of em-
</p>
<p>ployment and a consequent reduction of the wages of labor;
</p>
<p>by the ravenous pursuit after public situations, not for the
</p>
<p>sake of their honors and the performance of their public duties,
</p>
<p>but as a means of private subsistence ; by the reluctant resort
</p>
<p>to the perilous use of paper money ; by the intervention of
</p>
<p>legislation in the delicate relation between debtor and creditor ;
</p>
<p>and, above all, by the low and depressed state of the value of
</p>
<p>almost every description of the whole mass of the property of
</p>
<p>the nation, which has, on an average, sunk not less than about
</p>
<p>fifty per cent, within a few years."
</p>
<p>After much opposition the new tariff passed by a very close
</p>
<p>vote  25 to 21 in the Senate, and 107 to 102 in the House.
</p>
<p>This measure produced such good results that, in 1828, a fur-
</p>
<p>ther revision was proposed, chiefly at the instigation of a Na-
</p>
<p>tional Convention of manufacturers and producers held at Har-
</p>
<p>risburg in July, 1827, and called to discuss the interests in-
</p>
<p>volved. The friends of Jackson and anti-tariff charged that
</p>
<p>the Convention was a political trick to elect John Quincy

</p>
<p>tical men  men whose interests were involved, and whose ex-
</p>
<p>perience was brought forward to direct legislation. The me-
</p>
<p>morial from this body praying for an augmentation of duties
</p>
<p>on various goods and manufactures specified, was sent in to
</p>
<p>Congress. This was acted upon and a bill introduced "calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to favor the wool and hemp growers and to satisfy the
</p>
<p>iron manufacturers, but not affording the desired protection to
</p>
<p>the manufacturers of woollen and cotton goods, though it was
</p>
<p>afterwards so arranged as to be more agreeable to them." This
</p>
<p>bill elicited the best talent of both Houses in its laborious pas-
</p>
<p>sage, and finally was adopted by an almost purely sectional vote.
</p>
<p>Aside from the great hemp growing State of Kentucky only
</p>
<p>three votes were given the measure by members from the
</p>
<p>Southern States, who truly represented the feeling of their sec-
</p>
<p>tion in opposing the bill at every stage of its passage. It was
</p>
<p>received at the South with such expressions of disapprobation
</p>
<p>by Legislatures, by the press and by the people as left no doubt
</p>
<p>of the intensely sectional animosity then aroused. Large
</p>
<p>meetings of planters and citizens followed throughout the cot-
</p>
<p>ton growing States. At one, held in the Colleton district,
</p>
<p>South Carolina, during June, 1828, to consider the best reme-
</p>
<p>dy for the act of Congress, Mr. Calhoun was present and con-
</p>
<p>tributed to give character to the proceedings. The meeting
</p>
<p>declared nullification and non-obedience to be the rightful
</p>
<p>remedy; but, policy impelled to no open action until the
</p>
<p>Presidential election was decided. / Mr. Calhoun saw the dan-
</p>
<p>ger to Jackson's and his own election if violence resulted. He
</p>
<p>counselled obedience to the law until it was certain that Jack-
</p>
<p>son's administration could not or would not reduce the duties
</p>
<p>to their old standard of 1816. If, after granting this time, it
</p>
<p>was demonstrated that no reduction would be made, then he
</p>
<p>advised that the unconstitutional law be resisted and that the
</p>
<p>State, by proper action, interpose to nullify the law. At
</p>
<p>the request of William C. Preston he " prepared a paper ex-

<p>posing the objectionable features of the act of 1828 and the
</p>
<p>injurious effects which must result from it, and pointing out
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>lature then contented itself with passing a resolution declaring
</p>
<p>the tariff acts of Congress for the protection of domestic manu-
</p>
<p>factures unconstitutional, and that they ought to be resisted,
</p>
<p>and inviting other States to co-operate with South Carolina in
</p>
<p>measures of resistance." / Prior to this, however, he had writ-
</p>
<p>ten numerous letters to leading spirits throughout the South,
</p>
<p>for the specific purpose of bringing the public mind up to the
</p>
<p>point of resistance and co-operation when South Carolina should
</p>
<p>take her initiatory steps. One of his letters lately brought to
</p>
<p>light is in answer to Mr. Preston's request for him to prepare
</p>
<p>the document ' above referred to. From this letter we obtain
</p>
<p>inside views of the rebellion proposed, and therefore quote :
</p>
<p>"Pendleton, (S. C.,) Nov. 6, 1838.
</p>
<p>" Dear Sir : Believing as I thoroughly do, that the liberty and hap-
</p>
<p>piness of our country depend on the course which our State may take in
</p>
<p>this great juncture, I am prepared to contribute whatever may be in my
</p>
<p>power, to aid in giving a salutary direction to her Council.
</p>
<p>" The particular duty, which you request me to perform, is one of the
</p>
<p>highest importance, and no small difficulty. We have the basis in the
</p>
<p>report of Mr. Madison, and the proceedings of the Virginia and Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky Legislatures on the ' Alien and Sedition Act.' But from the dis-
</p>
<p>similarity between the character of the encroachments of the General
</p>
<p>Government then and now, very little aid can be derived from them in
</p>
<p>drawing up a paper for the present occasion. In casting my eyes over
</p>
<p>the subject, it strikes me that with the greatest compression consistent
</p>
<p>\vith clearness, the document must necessarily be voluminous  so many
</p>
<p>end so important are the principles involved, and so various are its de-
</p>
<p>tails. It will, of course, take time and labor; it will require the aid of
</p>
<p>documents not in my possession. I have but a short period to remain
</p>
<p>at home, and I am much engaged in my domestic concerns, preparatory

<p>to setting out to Washington ; but I will permit nothing to prevent me

<p>from sending on such aid that my friends may think I ought. I will

<p>commence a draft immediately. * * * Your views appear to me to
</p>
<p>be perfectly correct. Excise will not do. I deem it the most dangerous
</p>
<p>recourse that could be adopted, and would certainly be followed by de-
</p>
<p>fuat. The remedy you refer to is the only safe and efficient one, and is
</p>
<p>abundantly adequate. I speak with confidence. It alone can save the
</p>
<p>Union. The only question is the mode and time. It seems to me clear
</p>
<p>that the State must act by convention, but also am strongly of opinion
</p>
<p>414 THE NULLIFICATION REBELLION.
</p>
<p>that we must take time, especially if a new administration should come
</p>
<p>in, as there can be but little doubt it will.
</p>
<p>" All moves aiming at reform and revolution as ours is, must, to be
</p>
<p>successful, be characterized by great resjDect for the opinion of others.
</p>
<p>On this great question we are far in advance of the intelligence of the
</p>
<p>other States, even of those which have the same interest with ourselves.
</p>
<p>Our measures, however sound, however justified by the noble examiJlc
</p>
<p>of Virginia, in '98, will appear at first to all our friends, novel, bold and
</p>
<p>even dangerous, and to those who exact tribute from us, treasonable.
</p>
<p>Yet, thought will be put in motion. And, as our cause rests in truth
</p>
<p>and the Constitution, it will gain daily, till it will finally prevail, if we
</p>
<p>act with wisdom and moderation.
</p>
<p>" These views are greatly strengthened on the supposition of a change
</p>
<p>of administration. It would seem but a reasonable confidence in the
</p>
<p>new administration to afibrd time to see what its wisdom and virtue
</p>
<p>may effect  not to aff"ord which will be considered hostile to it, and ex-
</p>
<p>pose the State to the imputation of dangerous designs, which ought to
</p>
<p>be especially guarded against,
</p>
<p>" There has been heretofore a want of caution on this important point,
</p>
<p>which has exposed us to great danger, and which renders greater cau-
</p>
<p>tion more necessary. It seems to me that all that can be done at present
</p>
<p>is an able report, fully exposing our wrongs, and unfolding our remedies,
</p>
<p>but to abstain for the present from applying it on grounds of respect
</p>
<p>for others and a sense of moderation, with the adoption of such measures
</p>
<p>as may produce harmony of opinion among the oppressed States. It
</p>
<p>seems to me it would also be judicious to approve of the course adopted
</p>
<p>by our people to raise their own supplies, and to abstain as far as may
</p>
<p>be jiracticable from the consumption of the articles fostered by the tariff
</p>
<p> but accomjjanied with a caution not to consider it more than a tem-
</p>
<p>porary jjalliative.
</p>
<p>" I make these suggestions with deference, knowing how much must
</p>
<p>depend on circumstances, which can only be judged of by those on the
</p>
<p>spot. If we succeed, it will constitute one of the most glorious reforms
</p>
<p>ever effected. But, if we fail, we will have the poor consolation of

<p>an effort on our part  the loss of our liberty."
</p>
<p>This was written by the Vice President of the United States,
</p>
<p>while yet exercising tlie functions of his high office ; and its
</p>
<p>author, as the Democratic candidate for the same trust, was
</p>
<p>even then reelected. Considering the tone of Mr. Calhoun's
</p>
<p>addresses, that he was not at once arraigned for treason was
</p>

</p>
<p>good cause of complaint which the malcontents urged as their

</p>
<p>justification. Benton, in his " Thirty Years' Yiew," gives us
</p>
<p>the following statement of the actual condition of the question.
</p>
<p>We cite it as presenting what time has demonstrated to have
</p>
<p>been a very fair presentment of the case :
</p>
<p>" The South believed itself impoverished to enrich the North
</p>
<p>by this system ; and certainly a singular and unexpected re-
</p>
<p>sult has been seen in these two sections. In the colonial state
</p>
<p>the Southern were the rich part of the colonies, and expected
</p>
<p>to do well in a state of independence. They had the exports,
</p>
<p>and felt sure of their prosperity. Not so of the North, whose
</p>
<p>agricultural resources were few, and who expected privations
</p>
<p>from the loss of British favor. But in the first half century
</p>
<p>after independence this expectation was reversed. The wealth
</p>
<p>of the North was enormously aggrandized ; that of the South
</p>
<p>had declined. Northern towns had become great cities ; South-
</p>
<p>ern cities had decayed, or become stationery ; and Charleston,
</p>
<p>the principal port of the South, was less considered than before
</p>
<p>the Revolution. The North became a money-lender to the
</p>
<p>South, and Southern citizens made pilgrimages to Northern
</p>
<p>cities to raise money upon the hypothecation of their patrimo-
</p>
<p>nial estates. And this in the face of Southern exports since
</p>
<p>the Revolution to the value of eight hundred millions of dol-
</p>
<p>lars  a sum equal to the product of the Mexican mines since
</p>
<p>the days of Cortez. The Southern States attributed this result
</p>
<p>to the action of the Federal Government  its alleged double
</p>
<p>action of levying revenue upon the industry of one section of
</p>
<p>the Union and expending it on another  and especially to its
</p>
<p>protective tariffs. But the protective system, in any degree,
</p>
<p>except in favor of cotton-planting, had been in existence only
</p>
<p>twelve years, and this reversed condition of the two sections
</p>
<p>had commenced long before that time. Philosophy and obser-
</p>
<p>vation have long since discovered the cause to be found, not
</p>
<p>in the operations of the National Government, which has al-
</p>
<p>ways been beneficent, but in the social character and the indus-

<p>trial systems of the two sections. But such was the pretense
</p>
<p> a mere pretense, as President Jackson alleged  used by Mr.
</p>
<p>Calhoun and his associates for justifying disloyal speech in
</p>
<p>Congress, and action in South Carolina."
</p>
<p>416 THE NULLIFICATION REBELLION.
</p>
<p>The years intervening between 1828 and the session of 1831
</p>
<p>-2 were years of great commercial and landed prosperity ; the
</p>
<p>new " System" developed manufactures and mines with aston-
</p>
<p>ishing rapidity and with beneficent results ; on every hand out
</p>
<p>of the South the country was satisfied with " protective" results,
</p>
<p>whatever may have been the theoretic opposition of Free Trade
</p>
<p>partisans. But, in Congress, great excitement prevailed, ac-
</p>
<p>companied by a corresponding feeling among the people. A
</p>
<p>New England Senator had, early in the session for 1829-30,
</p>
<p>offered a resolution of inquiry into the expediency of limiting
</p>
<p>sales of public lands to those then in market, to suspend the
</p>
<p>surveys, and to abolish the office of Surveyor General. This
</p>
<p>proposition doubtless had its political face, although it was
</p>
<p>urged that, the public revenues then being in excess of the
</p>
<p>General Government's needs, it would be economj'- to fill up
</p>
<p>the territory already opened before proceeding with farther
</p>
<p>surveys of territory. Western members " took fire" at
</p>
<p>what was deemed to be a stroke at their section's pro-
</p>
<p>gress, which, if not stayed, would transfer the seat of political
</p>
<p>power to the west of the Alleghanies, in another decade. Cri-
</p>
<p>mination and recrimination resulted ; the West was pitted
</p>
<p>against the East, but particularly against New England, which
</p>
<p>was severely overhauled for its Federalism, its Hartford Con-
</p>
<p>vention, its friendship for a foreign enemy (England) and for
</p>
<p>its unappeasable spirit of domination. This contention, promis-
</p>
<p>ing the worst results, Webster sough to allay the tumult by
</p>
<p>moving an indefinite postponement of the entire question.
</p>
<p>Sustaining his motion with "remarks," he only added fuel to
</p>
<p>the flame, by enlarging the scope of debate. The Ordinance
</p>
<p>of 1798 and the Missouri Compromise were introduced. At
</p>
<p>once the ghost of Slavery, supposed to have been forever ap-
</p>
<p>peased by the " restriction" of 1822, came up and laid its
</p>
<p>manacles upon the altar.] Webster, as the exponent of New
</p>
<p>England sentiment, conceived slavery to be the Eepublie's

<p>bane. In one of his speeches he introduced the illustration
</p>
<p>frequently quoted, of the relative progress of the Slave State
</p>
<p>of Kentucky and the Free State of Ohio  a comparison higlily
</p>
<p>damaginsr to the cause of slave labor. This inflamed the

<p>HAYNE AND WEBSTER. 417
</p>
<p>Southern spirit. To jpropagate tbeir system of involuntary ser-
</p>
<p>vitude was boldly avowed as a political and constitutional
</p>
<p>right. In the utterance of these sentiments the brilliant Eob-
</p>
<p>ert Y. Hayne, of South Carolina, became conspicuous. Pie
</p>
<p>denounced the interference of the North with slavery  assum-
</p>
<p>ing that it was a State institution, and therefore was no body's
</p>
<p>business but their own. /The question of State Eights came
</p>
<p>into the turbulent arena, and laid its broken bundle of fasces
</p>
<p>upon the altar beside the chains and manacles. The celebrated
</p>
<p>contest between Hayne and Webster was the result. ] The
</p>
<p>South Carolinian planted himself upon Calhoun's platform of
</p>
<p>the right of a State to pronounce upon the validity and consti-
</p>
<p>tutionality of National laws and to nullify them if the State
</p>
<p>should so elect. His several speeches startled the country by
</p>
<p>their boldly avowed doctrines, proving the extreme Southern
</p>
<p>States to favor, at heart, disunion.
</p>
<p>To these alarming sentiments Webster, thoroughly aroused,
</p>
<p>replied at great length, and his two answers to Hayne (Janua-
</p>
<p>ry, 1830) stand as great living texts on the powers of the
</p>
<p>Government.
</p>
<p>In this debate Hayne doubtless spoke with the sanction and
</p>
<p>co-operation of the Vice President. His efforts were designed
</p>
<p>to create a broad distinctive issue, upon which to create a party
</p>
<p>whose ultimate object was to denationalize the Government, or,
</p>
<p>failing in this, to prepare the way for a peaceable division of
</p>
<p>the Union. The more to give this movement momentum it
</p>
<p>was planned to make Thomas Jefferson assume the paternity
</p>
<p>of the party, by acknowledging his resolutions of '98  as ori-
</p>
<p>ginally prepared by him  to be its fundamental principles. A
</p>
<p>dinner party was, therefore, given at the Capital (April 13th,
</p>
<p>1830) upon the occasion of Jefferson's birth day. Many emi-
</p>
<p>nent men of ' Democratic' faith were present, including the
</p>
<p>President of the United States, the Yice President, three mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the Cabinet, members of Congress, &c. All, outward 1}^,

</p>
<p>seemed only the offering of patriotism, but, beneath it all was
</p>
<p>the spirit of disunion. The regular toasts, apparently proper
</p>
<p>for the occasion, were, upon their dissemination, discovered to

<p>be so subtly yet so strongly tinctured with the South Carolina

</p>
<p>view of State Rights that numbers of the invited guests with-
</p>
<p>drew from the feast. The President's attention being directed
</p>
<p>to the discovery he was advised to withdraw. He refused,
</p>
<p>however, to desert the table, and, as the sequel proved, for a
</p>
<p>patriotic reason. He had resolved to rebuke the disloyal spirit
</p>
<p>of the gathering. Dinner being over the regular toasts were
</p>
<p>introduced  over one half of them prepared by Mr. Calhoun.
</p>
<p>These were received with expressions of satisfaction, and nul-
</p>
<p>lification seemingly became a fixed fact with the Jeffersonian
</p>
<p>Democracy, so far as " regular" toasts at a Jeffersonian festival
</p>
<p>could be trusted as exponents of principles. Volunteer senti-
</p>
<p>ments were then in oi'der, when Jackson, rising, threw this
</p>
<p>bombshell into the proceedings :
</p>
<p>" Our Federal Union : it must he preserved ! "
</p>
<p> a sentiment designed and regarded as a proclamation from
</p>
<p>the President to announce a plot against the Union. The next
</p>
<p>toast, by Mr. Calhoun, did not by any means allay the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's apprehensions. It was :
</p>
<p>" The Union, next to our liberty, the most dear : may we all remember
</p>
<p>that it can only be joreserved by respecting the rights of the States, and
</p>
<p>distributing equally the benefit and burthen of the Union."
</p>
<p>In the language of Thomas H. Benton, who was present,
</p>
<p>" this toast touched all the tender parts of the new question 
</p>
<p>liberty before Union  only to be preserved. / State Rights,
</p>
<p>inequality of burthens and benefits. These phrases connect-
</p>
<p>ing themselves with Mr. Hayne's speech, and with proceedings
</p>
<p>and publications in South Carolina, unveiled nullification as a
</p>
<p>new and distinct doctrine in the United States, and the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of a new party in the field."
</p>
<p>The Democracy, becoming alarmed at this new movement,
</p>
<p>and beholding in it the seeds of National dissohition, hastened
</p>
<p>to repudiate the Calhoun programme. Madison, still living,
</p>
<p>spoke and wrote with great earnestness against the construc-

</p>
<p>by association with nullification and disunion. But, these dis-
</p>
<p>claimers did not prevent the Southern party from spreading
</p>
<p>and strengthening, and, despite Madison's special plea, despite
</p>
<p>the Virginia Legislature's resolves, the new constructionists
</p>
<p>adhered to their claim upon the father of Democracy, and
</p>
<p>thirty years of contention did not deprive them of that claim.
</p>
<p>Strengthened by their now open movement upon the State
</p>
<p>Rights' plea, and united by the still persistent denial of Con-
</p>
<p>gress to. reduce the offensive tariff", affairs assumed a menacing
</p>
<p>aspect as the Presidential election of 1832 approached. It be-
</p>
<p>came evident to the most unobserving that an explosion was
</p>
<p>at hand. | Calhoun's relations with Jackson were not even
</p>
<p>friendly, for the President, from the hour of that dinner party,
</p>
<p>had watched the Vice President with distrust. (This feeling
</p>
<p>culminated in the conviction that Calhoun really meditated a
</p>
<p>disruption of the Union  using the tariff" as a popular pretext
</p>
<p> upon the appearance of his (Calhoun's) " Letter to Governor
</p>
<p>Hamilton," dated Fort Hill, August 28th, 1832. 1 Its assump-
</p>
<p>tions were so clearly inimical to the authority and supremacy
</p>
<p>of the General Government, that Jackson was no longer in
</p>
<p>doubt as to the stroke for " independence" meditated by the
</p>
<p>intriguants. It contained such sentiments as the following
</p>
<p>(the italics being Mr. Calhoun's own) :
</p>
<p>' On a question whether a particular power exercised by the General
</p>
<p>Government be granted by the Constitution, it belongs to the State as a
</p>
<p>member of the Union, in her sovereign capacity in convention, to deter-
</p>
<p>mine definitively, as far as her citizens are concerned, the extent of the
</p>
<p>obligation which she contracted : and if, in her opinion, the act exer-
</p>
<p>cising the power be unconstitutional, to declare it null and void, which
</p>
<p>declaration would be obligatory on her citizens?''
</p>
<p>"In whatever light it may be viewed, I hold it as necess<trily re-
</p>
<p>sulting, that, in the case of a power disputed between them, the

</p>
<p>enforce its construction of its powers against that of the States, to
</p>
<p>bring tlie subject before the States themselves, in the only form which,
</p>
<p>according to the provision of the Constitution, it can be  by a pro-
</p>
<p>position to amend, in the manner prescribed in the instrument, to
</p>
<p>be acted on by them in the only mode they can, by expressly granting
</p>
<p>or withholding the contested power."
</p>
<p>" Not a provision can be found in the Constitution authorizing the
</p>
<p>General Oovernment to exercise any control whatever over a State by force,
</p>
<p>by veto, by judicial process, or in any other form  a most important
</p>
<p>omission^ designed and not accidentaV
</p>
<p>" The construction which would confer on the Supreme Court the
</p>
<p>power in question, rests on the ground that the Constitution has con-
</p>
<p>ferred on that tribunal the high and important right of deciding on
</p>
<p>the constitutionality of laics. That it possesses this power I do not deny,
</p>
<p>but I do utterly deny that it is conferred by the Constitution, either by
</p>
<p>the provisions cited, or any other. It is a power derived from the ne-
</p>
<p>cessity of the case ; and, so far from being possessed by the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court exclusively or peculiarly, it not only belongs to every court of
</p>
<p>the country, high or low, civil or criminal, but to all foreign courts, be-
</p>
<p>fore which a case may be brought involving the construction of a law
</p>
<p>which may conflict with the provisions of the Constitution."
</p>
<p>" The opinion that the General Government has the right to enforce
</p>
<p>its construction of its powers against a State, in any mode whatever, is,
</p>
<p>in truth, founded on a fundamental misconception of our system. At
</p>
<p>the bottom of this, and, in fiict, in almost every other misconception as
</p>
<p>to the relation between the States and the General Government, lurks
</p>
<p>the radical error, that the latter is a National, and not, as in reality it is,
</p>
<p>a Confederate Government ; and that it derives its powers ft om a higher
</p>
<p>source than the States. There are thousands influenced by these im-
</p>
<p>pressions without being conscious of it, and who, while they believe
</p>
<p>themselves to be opposed to consolidation, have into their conception
</p>
<p>of our Constitution almost all the ingredients which enter into that
</p>
<p>form of government."
</p>

</p>
<p>far removed from consolidation, and is as strictly and purely a confedera-
</p>
<p>tion, as the one ichich it superseded.''''
</p>
<p>" I have now, I trust, conclusively shown that a State has a right, in
</p>
<p>her sovereign capacity, in convention, to declare an unconstitutional act
</p>
<p>of Congress to be. null and void, and that such declarations would be
</p>
<p>obligatory on her citizens, as highly so as the Constitution itself, and
</p>
<p>conclusive against the General Government, which would have no right
</p>
<p>to enforce its construction of its powers against that of the State."
</p>
<p>" I next propose to consider the practical efi'ect of the exercise of thi&
</p>
<p>high and important right which, as the great conservative principle
</p>
<p>NULLIFICATION NOT SECESSION. 42J.
</p>
<p>of our system, is known under the various names of nullification, inter-
</p>
<p>position and State veto  in reference to its operation viewed under dif-
</p>
<p>ferent aspects: nullification, as declaring null an unconstitutional act
</p>
<p>of the General Government, as far as the State is concerned ; interposi-
</p>
<p>tion, as throwing the shield of protection between the citizen of a State
</p>
<p>and the encroachments of the Government ; and veto, as arresting or
</p>
<p>inhibiting its unauthorized acts within the limits of the State."
</p>
<p>The nullificator then proceeded to prove to the Governor,
</p>
<p>and, through him, to the people of the South, that the Greneral
</p>
<p>Government, possessing no 'power to enforce its laws against a
</p>
<p>State, could not coerce a State by any process of the courts.'
</p>
<p>This, by inference, left the State free to act, without fear of
</p>
<p>punishment or "coercion." He did, indeed, make a labored
</p>
<p>and an able argument to prove that nullification did not ne-
</p>
<p>cessitate secession  that, to nullify laws was not to reject
</p>
<p>Federal relations and responsibilities, f He said, as deducible
</p>
<p>from his argument :
</p>
<p>" Nullification leaves the members of the association or union in the
</p>
<p>condition it found them  subject to all its burdens, and entitled to all
</p>
<p>its advantages, comprehending the member nullifying as well as the
</p>
<p>others  its object being, not to destroy, but to preserve, as has been
</p>
<p>stated. It simply arrests the act of the agent, as far as the principal is
</p>
<p>concerned, leaving in every other respect the operation of the joiut con-
</p>
<p>cern as before ; secession, on the contrary, destroys, as far as the with-
</p>
<p>drawing member is concerned, the association or union, and restores him
</p>
<p>to the relation he occupied towards the other members before the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of the association or union. He loses the benefit, but is released
</p>
<p>from the burden and control, and can no longer be dealt with, by his
</p>
<p>former associates, as one of its members."
</p>
<p>And he added this somewhat remarkable expression:
</p>
<p>. " With institutions every way so fortunate, possessed of means so
</p>
<p>well calculated to prevent disorders, and so admirable to correct
</p>
<p>them when they cannot be j^revented, lie who would prescribe for our
</p>
<p>political disease disunion on the one side, or coercion of a State in the

<p>assertion of its rights on the other, tcould deserve and will receive, the exe-
</p>
<p>crations of this and all future generations.''''
</p>
<p> Judge Black's opinion [quoted at length in Victor's History of the Southern
</p>
<p>Rebellion, vol. i. pages 66-69] as given to Mr. Buchanan Nov. 20th, 1860, for his
</p>
<p>guidance in the treatment of rebellion, clearly re-enunciated Mr. Calhoun's propo-
</p>
<p>Bitions that he had no power, under the Constitution, to coerce a State to obedi-
</p>
<p>ence. Behind that opinion the President entrenched himself to excuse his non-
</p>
<p>action for nipping the rebellion in the bud.
</p>
<p>422 THE NULLIFICATION EEBELLION.
</p>
<p>We characterise it as a remarkable expression in view of
</p>
<p>the practical results of nullification, which must have been as
</p>
<p>clear to Mr. Calhoun's mind as a noon-day sun to his eye. He
</p>
<p>was safe in the declaration of devotion to the Union, because
</p>
<p>the Government must strike the first blow if it would drive a
</p>
<p>State out of the right of nullification ; in which event, according
</p>
<p>to Mr. Calhoun's argument and political theory, the bond of
</p>
<p>Union would be dissolved ex necessitate reV He was, as at the
</p>
<p>dinner party, for the Union with a qualification, which after-
</p>
<p>wards was aptly expressed in the phrase  " obedience to the
</p>
<p>Constitution but allegiance to the State."
</p>
<p>One of Mr. Calhoun's biographers says of this letter : " This
</p>
<p>elaborate production exhausted the whole argument in defense
</p>
<p>of the position assumed by Mr. Calhoun, and, with his address,
</p>
<p>was regarded as a political text book by the nullifiers of South
</p>
<p>Carolina. They looked upon it as their Magna Charta, which
</p>
<p>promised them deliverance from wrong and oppression, and
</p>
<p>behind which were safety and protection." And we quite
</p>
<p>agree with the author in his opinion concerning the harmony
</p>
<p>between the South Carolinian's creed and that enunciated by
</p>
<p>Jefferson and Madison. Mr. Jenkins says : " The Virginia re-
</p>
<p>solutions declared, in express terms, the right of the States to
</p>
<p>interpose, whenever their reserved powers were infringed, and
</p>
<p>to maintain ' within their respective limits, the authorities,
</p>
<p>rights and liberties, appertaining to them ; ' and in the Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky resolutions, Mr. Jefferson held, ' that in all cases of an
</p>
<p>abuse of delegated powers, the members of the General Govern-
</p>
<p>ment being chosen by the people, a change by the people
</p>
<p>would be the constitutional remedy ; but, where powers are
</p>
<p>assumed, which have not been delegated, a nullification of the act
</p>
<p>is the rightful remedy that every State has a natural right to, in
</p>
<p>cases not in the compact {casus nan foederis), to nullify, of their
</p>
<p> Calhoun's life was one of Tvarring against the doctrine of Federal supremacy,
</p>
<p>yet he found it no contravention of principle to utter Union sentiments. Thus, in

</p>
<p>pose to resign his seat in the U. S. Senate, he closed with this expression :

<p>" That the State may long retain her high standing in the Union, and that the

<p>Union itself, with our free and happy and glorious institutions, may be transmitted
</p>
<p>to the latest generation, shall, to my last breath, ever be my ardent prayer."

</p>
<p>own authority, all assumptions of powers within their limits.' "
</p>
<p>All the special pleading and protestation yet exhausted upon
</p>
<p>the question have not succeeded in disproving Mr. Calhoun's
</p>
<p>obligation to Jefferson. He differed with the Virginian in
</p>
<p>matters of detail- rather than in first principles.
</p>
<p>The revenue produced by the tariff of 1828 proved too much
</p>
<p>of a good thing. It threatened the public treasury with ple-
</p>
<p>thora  a condition more to be dreaded by all good citizens
</p>
<p>than financial depletion. Something must be done to stop the
</p>
<p>receipts, as well as to stay the storm brewing in South Caroli-
</p>
<p>na. Jackson, in his annual message, December, 1831, recom-
</p>
<p>mended a reduction of the duties. An attempt was made to
</p>
<p>revise the schedule so as not to affect injuriously the multitude
</p>
<p>of interests involved. /After much labor an amended act
</p>
<p>passed enhancing the duty on woollens five per cent, but re-
</p>
<p>ducing that on iron and sugar, and abolishing the duty on
</p>
<p>coffee and a great number of other articles of general consump-
</p>
<p>tion. \ The vote on this Was, in the House : Northern States 
</p>
<p>yeas 73, nays 35 ; Southern States  yeas 49,^nays 20. This
</p>
<p>gave thirty-two per cent, of the Northern and thirty-eight per
</p>
<p>cent, of the Southern vote against reduction. In the Senate
</p>
<p>the vote was : Northern States  yeas 23, nays 1 ; Southern
</p>
<p>States  yeas 9, nays 15, or four per cent, of the Northern and
</p>
<p>sixty-two per cent, of the Southern vote against reduction !
</p>
<p>The result apparently demonstrated that the country, taken in
</p>
<p>the aggregate, was satisfied with the protective system.
</p>
<p>South Carolina rebelled. Mr. Calhoun sounded the note of
</p>
<p>alarm. The moment for action had come. A test had been
</p>
<p>submitted, and Congress absolutely refused to recede from its
</p>
<p>position. There only remained for South Carolina to enforce
</p>
<p>her old threat of non-obedience to the mandates of Congress.
</p>
<p>Mr. Calhoun issued an address to the people, announcing that
</p>
<p>a protective policy might thenceforth be regarded as settled
</p>
<p>upon the country  that all hope of relief from Congress must

</p>
<p>and influential citizens led by sucli spirits as Poinsett, Pettigru,
</p>
<p>Colonel Drayton, ex-Governor Manning, &c. These men sought
</p>
<p>to prevent the nullifiers from obtaining the two- thirds majority
</p>
<p>in the Legislature necessary to call a State Convention. If
</p>
<p>that call could be prevented there would be no State action,
</p>
<p>and, consequently, no resistance to the General Government,
</p>
<p>except such as the Legislature (in its legislative not sovereign
</p>
<p>cap)acity) might authorise the Governor to take. But, their
</p>
<p>strenuous labors were of no avail ; before the great strength of
</p>
<p>Calhoun's influence nothing could stand. Meetings took place
</p>
<p>throughout the State close upon the Presidential election. The
</p>
<p>Legislature came together amid much excitement. One of its
</p>
<p>first acts was to appoint a Committee to report on the relations
</p>
<p>of the State with the General Government. It reported that
</p>
<p>the Federal Constitution was a compact originally formed, not
</p>
<p>between the people of the different States as distinct and inde-
</p>
<p>pendent sovereignties ; that when any violation of the spirit
</p>
<p>of that compact took place, it was not only the right of the
</p>
<p>people, but of the State Legislature, to remonstrate against it ;
</p>
<p>that the Federal Government was responsible to the State Le-
</p>
<p>gislatures whenever it assumed powers not conferred ; that
</p>
<p>notwithstanding a tribunal was appointed under the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion to decide controversies where the United States was a par-
</p>
<p>ty, there were some questions that must occur between the
</p>
<p>Government and the State which it would be unsafe to submit
</p>
<p>to any judicial tribunal ; and finally, that there was a peculiar
</p>
<p>propriety in a State Legislature's undertaking to decide for it-
</p>
<p>self, inasmuch as the Constitution had not provided any
</p>
<p>remedy.
</p>
<p>A convention of delegates was thereupon ordered (October
</p>
<p>22d) to assemble on the 19th of November, to act for the State,
</p>
<p>in the crisis. Meanwhile the Virginia Legislature, also, by a
</p>
<p>vote of 154 to 68, gave her assent to the principle of nullifica-
</p>
<p>tion. North Carolina declared against it and held out firmly

</p>

<p>enormous cost,^ in extinguishing the Indian titles to lands in
</p>
<p>these States, and they in return, were ready to cast off the
</p>
<p>Government.
</p>
<p>An election, by the people, of delegates resulted in an almost
</p>
<p>unanimous choice of Calhoun men. The delegates gathered at
</p>
<p>Columbia, at the appointed time, and the Convention duly or-
</p>
<p>ganized by the election of ex-Governor Hamilton as its Presi-
</p>
<p>dent On the 21st of November, the Ordinance of Nullifica-
</p>
<p>tion was adopted. The tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 were de-
</p>
<p>clared null and void and not binding upon the citizens of the
</p>
<p>States. It was further declared that if the United States should
</p>
<p>attempt to enforce them by naval or military force, the Union
</p>
<p>was to be dissolved, and a convention called to form a govern-
</p>
<p>ment for South Carolina. 1 It further provided that no appeal
</p>
<p>should be permitted to the Supreme Court of the United States
</p>
<p>in any question concerning the validity of the ordinance, or of
</p>
<p>the laws passed to give effect thereto.
</p>
<p>Having thus discharged its duties the Convention adjourned
</p>
<p>to meet again in March after the adjournment of Congress. The
</p>
<p>Ordinance was law by the nature of the Convention, without
</p>
<p>any submission of it to the people, for acceptance or rejection.
</p>
<p>South Carolina was a democracy only in form. Even her
</p>
<p>Governor was not chosen by the people but by the Legislature,
</p>
<p>which body was, simply, the representative of property hold-
</p>
<p>ers and " first families." Out of the forty thousand voters then
</p>
<p>in the State it is fair to say one thousand directed the entire
</p>
<p>mass, while, of this one thousand, not one hundred were unin-
</p>
<p>fluenced by three or four men who directed the State's destiny.
</p>
<p>With the forms of a democracy. South Carolina, practically,
</p>
<p>and in all essential features, was an aristocracy. The Conven-
</p>
<p>tion legislated the Ordinance into existence and the Legislature
</p>
<p>proceeded to provide for its enforcement, the legislators being
</p>
<p>convened for the especial purpose, by call of the Governor
</p>
<p>The acts adopted embraced one authorizing the Governor to

</p>

</p>
<p>done in pursuance of that law were to be held- lawful in the
</p>
<p>State courts.
</p>
<p>Says a Democratic writer :' " the State placed itself in an
</p>
<p>attitude of military preparation for the defense of its position ;
</p>
<p>organized and armed its own physical force ; and succeeded in
</p>
<p>arousing so determined and excited a state of feeling in its
</p>
<p>citizens, that we think there can be no doubt that it would
</p>
<p>have maintained its position to the last extremity  a position,
</p>
<p>manifestly, exceedingly difficult to be overcome, if thus main-
</p>
<p>tained, by any physical power which could have been brought
</p>
<p>against it."
</p>
<p>~ All of these things transpired with the advice and approba-
</p>
<p>tion of Mr. Calhoun. They embodied his programme for
</p>
<p>"strengthening the Union by purifying it," and the country
</p>
<p>beheld the sad spectacle of a State in arms defying the power
</p>
<p>of Congress.
</p>
<p>The election for President transpired just a fortnight before
</p>
<p>the passage of the Ordinance. Jackson was reelected. Mr.
</p>
<p>Calhoun, dropped from the list of candidates, saw his rival,
</p>
<p>Martin Yan Buren, elevated to the Vice Presidency. The
</p>
<p>popular vote stood: Jackson 650,028 ; Henry Clay 550,189 
</p>
<p>proving the protectionists in the minority, since Clay ran as
</p>
<p>their candidate on the distinct issue of the " American System."
</p>
<p>If the popular voice was any evidence of the nation's feelmg
</p>
<p>and policy, Calhoun's anti-protection views were in the majori-
</p>
<p>ty. But, the nullifiers did not j^ropose to await the issue of
</p>
<p>an election. Having the tariff as a pretext they were not dis-
</p>
<p>posed to accept the tardy terms of a Congressional majority
</p>
<p>Calhoun distrusted Jackson too much to expect anything from
</p>
<p>him except opposition. His avowed reasons for this distrust
</p>
<p>were thus given in a letter lately brought to light, written to
</p>
<p>Edmund Puffin, of Virginia :
</p>
<p>" He (.Jackson) came in, as far as my aid and that of my friends was
</p>
<p>given him, mainly to put down the (protective) system by briuging to

</p>
<p>bear against it the immense patronage in money and power which it
</p>
<p>put into the hands of the Executive ; but, instead of that, he, in fact,
</p>
<p>rested his whole scheme of power on it, while he held out fair words to
</p>
<p> Democratic Review, April, 1838.
</p>
<p>Jackson's proclamation. 427
</p>
<p>the South. In his two first messages he proi^osed and urged the fatal
</p>
<p>scheme, had it been adopted, of distributing the surplus revenue express-
</p>
<p>ly with the view of perpetuating it, which gave him a strong hold onthe
</p>
<p>tarifi^ interest of the North : thus taking a position which made him
</p>
<p>more acceptable to the North than any Southern individual, and more
</p>
<p>to the South than any Northern, the result was, that, do what h6
</p>
<p>would, the latter would not join to turn him out of oflBce for Webster
</p>
<p>for Clay, or any other tarifi" man, nor the former for any anti-tariff", while
</p>
<p>he wielded the immense power and revenue derived from the system to
</p>
<p>build up a party personal to himself; and hence the spoils party, made
</p>
<p>up by recruits from all sides, and which had no principle but to support
</p>
<p>the authority of its chieftain."
</p>
<p>This attitude of South Carolina created a feeling of uneasi-
</p>
<p>ness among the people at large, influencing the Congressional
</p>
<p>as well as the Presidential election. The majority of Eepre-
</p>
<p>^entatives, returned to Congress, so far feared or endorsed Cal-
</p>
<p>houn's constitutional constructions as to be prepared for con-
</p>
<p>cessions proper to restore peace. They assembled to find a
</p>
<p>State in open rebellion, and proceeded to the work of redress-
</p>
<p>ing alleged grievances. During the first day's session a bill
</p>
<p>was introduced for the reduction of the tariff, and one for a
</p>
<p>similar object soon was reported from the Committee of Ways
</p>
<p>and Means, by its Chairman, Mr. Yerplanck, of New York. This
</p>
<p>was especially designed to conciliate South Carolina.
</p>
<p>Occupying the Presidential chair was a man of nerve  one
</p>
<p>too fearless to shrink from duty, and too loyal to pettifog as to
</p>
<p>the nature of that duty. Andrew Jackson beheld the head of
</p>
<p>treason in Calhoun's movements, and, as treason, he struck at
</p>
<p>it upon the first open act. (' Soon after the Ordinance was pro-
</p>
<p>mulgated the President issued (December 10th) his Proclama-
</p>
<p>mation of warning to those in an attitude of defiance toward
</p>
<p>the General Government, declaring the Ordinance of the State
</p>
<p>Convention subversive of the Federal Constitution, and his in-

<p>the people of the State against obedience to the Ordinance as
</p>
<p>involving the crime of treason against the United States. He
</p>
<p>denounced the State Rights idea, as interpreted by those whom
</p>
<p>he characterized as demagogues, to be pernicious, and assumed
</p>
<p>for an evil purpose. He said : " Eloquent appeals to your pas-

<p>428 THE NULLIFICATION REBELLIOlSr.
</p>
<p>sions, to your State pride, to your native courage, to your sense
</p>
<p>of real injury, were used to prepare you for the period when
</p>
<p>the mask, which concealed the hideous features of disunion,
</p>
<p>should be taken off. It fell, and you were made to look with
</p>
<p>complacency on objects which, not long since, you would have
</p>
<p>regarded with horror." And then added a peroration charac-
</p>
<p>terised both by force and a rhetorical beauty. " Snatch from
</p>
<p>the archives of your State the disorganizing edict of its con-
</p>
<p>vention ; bid its members to reassemble, and promulgate the
</p>
<p>decided expression of your will to remain in the path which
</p>
<p>alone can conduct you to safety, prosperity and honor. Tell
</p>
<p>them that, compared to disunion, all other evils are light, be-
</p>
<p>cause that brings with it an accumulation of all. Declare that
</p>
<p>you will never take the field unless the star spangled banner
</p>
<p>of your country shall float over you ; that you will not be stig-
</p>
<p>matized when dead, and dishonored and scorned while you live,
</p>
<p>as the authors of the first attack on the Constitution of your
</p>
<p>country. Its destroyers you can not be. You may disturb its
</p>
<p>peace ; you may interrupt the course of its prosperity ; you
</p>
<p>may cloud its reputation for stability; but its tranquility will
</p>
<p>be restored, its prosperity will return, and the stains upon its
</p>
<p>national character will be transferred and remain an eternal
</p>
<p>blot on the memory of those who caused the disorder."
</p>
<p>To this proclamation South Carolina responded, through her
</p>
<p>newly elected Governor, ex-Senator Robert Y. Hayne, who
</p>
<p>issued his counter manifesto sustaining the position assumed
</p>
<p>by the State, and calling out twelve thousand militia as volun-
</p>
<p>teers, to maintain the supremacy of the State laws.
</p>
<p>To the seat vacated by Mr. Hayne, in the U. S. Senate, Mr.
</p>
<p>Calhoun was chosen by the Legislature, early in December,
</p>
<p>1832. He at once proceeded to the Capital to take his seat,
</p>
<p>having first resigned his ofiice of Vice President. His course
</p>
<p>now commanded unusual attention. Some even doubted if he
</p>
<p>would take the oath of office, while the known indignation felt

</p>
<p>against him by Jackson, added plausibility to the rumor of
</p>
<p>Calhoun's prospective arrest for high treason. But, no arrest
</p>
<p>was made, and the Senator elect took the qualifying oath with
</p>
<p>all due formality. Morally and physically he was brave. He
</p>
<p>Calhoun's resolutions. 429
</p>
<p>came to "Washington to do liis work; no threats, public or pri-
</p>
<p>vate  no fear of results to himself or the country, deterred him
</p>
<p>from his defense of South Carolina.
</p>
<p>He acted promptly, by soon calling upon the President,
</p>
<p>through a resolution, to lay before the Senate the Ordinance
</p>
<p>of Nullification and accompanying documents, as remitted by
</p>
<p>the Governor of South Carolina. Before action was had, Jack-
</p>
<p>son sent in his message of January 16th, 1833, wherein he* des-
</p>
<p>canted upon the rebellious condition of affairs in the disaffected
</p>
<p>State and recommended the revival of the act of '93 to enforce
</p>
<p>the revenue laws and to crush resistance to the United States'
</p>
<p>authorities. On this message, before action thereon, Mr. Cal-
</p>
<p>houn spoke at considerable length and with much feeling, de-
</p>
<p>fending the course of his constituency and declaring their re-
</p>
<p>solve to sustain their position. When the National Govern-
</p>
<p>ment returned to the principles of '98, he assumed, then would
</p>
<p>he be the last man to abandon that Government.
</p>
<p>^ In response to the message the Senate Committee on the Ju-
</p>
<p>diciary, of which Mr. Webster was a member, reported a bill
</p>
<p>known as the Force Bill. It answered the President's demand
</p>
<p>for authority to execute the laws, by extending the jurisdiction
</p>
<p>of the Federal Courts in cases arising under the revenue laws,
</p>
<p>and empowering the use of any additional military force neces-
</p>
<p>sary to maintain the peace and the supremacy of the laws.
</p>
<p>This most significant and important act was an overwhelming
</p>
<p>stroke at nullification, which Calhoun manoeuvered to parry
</p>
<p>by the subtleties of his logic. As preliminary to a general
</p>
<p>discussion on the constitutionality of such an act, and with the
</p>
<p>special object of eliciting debate, he introduced a series of res-
</p>
<p>olutions on the Powers of the General Government, as follows:
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That the people of the several States composing these
</p>
<p>United States are united as parties to a constitutional compact, to vvhicli
</p>
<p>the people of each State acceded as a separate and sovereign community,
</p>
<p>each binding itself, by its own particular ratification ; and that the Union,

</p>
<p>of M'hich the said compact is the bond, is a union 'between tlio States rati-
</p>
<p>fying the same.
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That the people of the several States, thus united by a
</p>
<p>constitutional compact, in fi^rming that instrument, in creating a General
</p>
<p>480 THE N ULLIFICATION REBELLION".
</p>
<p>Government to carry into effect the objects for -which it was formed,
</p>
<p>delegated to that Government, for that purpose, certain definite powers,
</p>
<p>to be exercised jointly, reserving, at the same time, each State to itself,
</p>
<p>the residuary mass of powers, to be exercised by its own separate gov-
</p>
<p>ernment ; and that, whenever the General Government assumes the exer-
</p>
<p>cise of powers not delegated by the compact, its acts are unauthorized,
</p>
<p>void and of no effect ; and that the said Government is not made the
</p>
<p>final judge of the powers delegated to it, since that would make its dis-
</p>
<p>cretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that,
</p>
<p>as in all other cases of compact among sovereign parties, without any
</p>
<p>common judge, each has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of the
</p>
<p>infraction as of the mode and measure of redress.
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That the assertions, that the people of these United States,
</p>
<p>taken collectively as individuals, are now, or ever have been united on
</p>
<p>the principle of the social compact, and, as such, are now formed into
</p>
<p>one nation or people ; or that they have ever been so united in any one
</p>
<p>stage of their political existence ; or that the people of the several States
</p>
<p>comprising the Union have not, as members thereof, retained their sove-
</p>
<p>reignty ; or that the allegiance of their citizens has been transferred to
</p>
<p>the General Government ; or that they have parted with the right of
</p>
<p>punishing treason through their respective State Governments ; or that
</p>
<p>they have not the right of judging, in the last re&ort, as to the extent
</p>
<p>of the powers reserved, and, of consequence, of those delegated, are not
</p>
<p>only without foundation in truth, but are contrary to the most certain
</p>
<p>and plain historical facts, and the clearest deductions of reason ; and
</p>
<p>that all exercise of power on the part of the General Government, or any
</p>
<p>of its departments, deriving authority from such erroneous assumptions,
</p>
<p>must of necessity be unconstitutional ; must tend directly and inevitably
</p>
<p>to subvert the sovereignty of the States, to destroy the Federal charac-
</p>
<p>ter of the Union, and to rear on its ruins a consolidated government,
</p>
<p>without constitutional check or limitation, and which must necessarily
</p>
<p>terminate in the loss of liberty itself."
</p>
<p>These resolves, it will be perceived, enunciated principles
</p>
<p>which, if endorsed, rendered the Force Bill nugatory. But, as

<p>significant of the feeling entertained in the Senate, they were
</p>
<p>laid on the table by a seven-eighths vote. Debate then opened
</p>
<p>on the Force Bill, in the course of which Mr. Calhoun deliv-
</p>
<p>ered an effective speech, (Feb. 15th, 1883) of three hours' du-
</p>
<p>ration ; but he avoided a discussion of the principles involved
</p>
<p>in his resolutions, reserving that discussion until Webster should
</p>
<p>first canvass the subject, thus affording his antagonist the van-
</p>
<p>tage ground of a reply. Webster, answering Calhoun (FeU
</p>
<p>WEBSTER'S GREAT SPEECH. 481
</p>
<p>16tli), pioceeded to discuss the whole question on the powers
</p>
<p>of the Government. His speech was a wonderful performance,

<p>characterized as truly Titanic in its majestic force of argument,
</p>
<p>truly Demosthenian in the mastery of its eloquence. He as-
</p>
<p>sumed the Hamiltonian gi-ound of consolidated principles in-
</p>
<p>volved in the organism of the Union, and maintained that the
</p>
<p>Constitution was the ^'supreme law of the land," any thing in
</p>
<p>the action of the States to the contrary. The Constitution was
</p>
<p>a " compact," like that of the old Confederation, as argued by
</p>
<p>the State Eights advocates ; but it was more ; after its ratifica-
</p>
<p>tion hy the States it hQQ2Lme fundamental law, supreme to the
</p>
<p>extent of its delegated powers, thus binding all the ratifying
</p>
<p>States into one indivisible whole, and rendering the people in
</p>
<p>the aggregate one nation. It is well to refresh our minds, in
</p>
<p>these days of disquietude, with the great Expounder's opinions
</p>
<p>upon the point around which centres all the interest of a life
</p>
<p>and death struggle. Let us, therefore, quote : " Whether the
</p>
<p>Constitution be a compact between States in their sovereign
</p>
<p>capacity is a question which must be mainly argued from what
</p>
<p>is contained in the instrument itself. We all agree that it is an
</p>
<p>instrument which has been in some way clothed with power.
</p>
<p>We all admit that it speaks with authority. The first question
</p>
<p>then is  What does it say of itself? What does it purport to
</p>
<p>be ? Does it style itself a league, confederacy, or compact be-
</p>
<p>tween sovereign States ? It is to be remembered, that the
</p>
<p>Constitution began to speak only after its adoption. Until it
</p>
<p>was ratified by nine States, it was but a proposal, the mere
</p>
<p>draft of an instrument. It was like a deed drawn but not ex-
</p>
<p>ecuted. The Convention had framed it ; sent it to Congress
</p>
<p>then sitting under the Confederation ; Congress had transmitted
</p>
<p>it to the State Legislatures ; and by the last, it was laid before
</p>
<p>the Conventions of the people in the several States. All this
</p>
<p>while it was inoperative paper. It had received no stamp of
</p>
<p>authority: it spoke nfe language. But, when ratified by the

<p>people in their respective Conventions, then it had a voice and
</p>

</p>
<p>sanction of the popular will, and was to be received as the ex-

</p>
<p>therefore, is as conclusive as what it says on any other point
</p>
<p>Does it call itself a ' compact ? ' Certainly not. It uses the wo}-d
</p>
<p>compact but once, and that is, when it declares that the States
</p>
<p>shall enter into no 'compact' Does it call itself a 'league,' a
</p>
<p>'confederacy,' a 'subsisting treaty between the States?' Cer-
</p>
<p>tainly not There is not a particle of such language in all its
</p>
<p>pages ! But, it declares itself a Constitution. "What is a
</p>
<p>Constitution? Certainly not a league, or confederacy, but a
</p>
<p>fundamental laio. That fundamental regulation which deter-
</p>
<p>mines the manner in which the public authority is to be exe-
</p>
<p>cuted, is what forms the Constitution of a State. Those pri-
</p>
<p>mary rules which concern the body itself, and the very being
</p>
<p>of the political society, the form of government and the manner
</p>
<p>in which power is to be exercised  all, in a word, which form
</p>
<p>together the Constitution of a State  these are ' fundamental
</p>
<p>laws.' This is the language of the public writers. But, do we
</p>
<p>need to be informed in this country what a constitution is ? Is
</p>
<p>it not an idea perfectly familiar, definite and well settled ? We
</p>
<p>are at no loss to understand what is meant by the Constitution
</p>
<p>of one of the States  and the Constitution of the United States
</p>
<p>speaks of itself as being an instrument of the same nature. It
</p>
<p>says, this Constitution shall be the law of the land, anything in
</p>
<p>the State Constitutions to the contrary, notwithstanding. And
</p>
<p>speaks of itself, too, in plain contradistinction /row a 'confede-
</p>
<p>ration :' for, it says, all debts contracted, and all engagements
</p>
<p>entered into by the United States, shall be as valid under this
</p>
<p>Constitution as under the Confederation.'' It does not say, as
</p>
<p>valid under this compact^ or this league, or this confederation,
</p>
<p>as under the former confederation, but as valid ' unden- this Con
</p>
<p>stitution.' "

<p>To this great exposition Mr. Calhoun addressed all the rtj-

<p>and solely a reply to Webster on the principles embodied in
</p>
<p>his (Calhoun's) resolutions. Having had time for preparation,
</p>
<p>the South Carolinian delivered what is regarded as his ab]e^st
</p>
<p>effort It was worthy, in every sense, of the occasion. He
</p>
<p>THE FORCE BILL. 433
</p>
<p>met, squarely, every issue presented. Assuming that tlie Con
</p>
<p>stitution was hut a compact, he made such a defense of the
</p>
<p>right of a State, as a State, to sit in judgment on acts of Con-
</p>
<p>gress and to n^ullify them, that, to this day, his logic has weight
</p>
<p>with a large class of thinkers even in the ISTorthern Statea
</p>
<p>Some writers have characterised his logic as " specious ;" bat,
</p>
<p>that is not a term to apply to the great nullificator's effort  it
</p>
<p>was exceedingly open in its enunciation of principles and per-
</p>
<p>fectly direct in its defense of them. There was nothing " spe-
</p>
<p>cious" in it as an argument ; if his theory was amenable to that
</p>
<p>term it was not more so than any theory awaiting acceptance
</p>
<p>as a fact. We concede to Calhoun the strength of his arga-
</p>
<p>ments  the more willingly, now, as we have the painful expe-
</p>
<p>rience of the Secession Revolution to prove that his principles,
</p>
<p>when practically applied, must end in national ruin. The true
</p>
<p>test is practice, or, as essayists have it, " experience is the great
</p>
<p>teacher ;" and, great as were Mr. Webster's efforts to confront
</p>
<p>the evil of Calhoun's philosophy, they will be forgotten in the
</p>
<p>more overwhelming demonstration which three years of civil
</p>
<p>war adduced. That Mr. Calhoun's philosophy was responsible
</p>
<p>for the Secession revolution we conceive to be self-evident. It
</p>
<p>is fair to presume that he would have been its chief director
</p>
<p>had he been alive and in health during the winter of 1860-

<p>land but a precedent in legislation to which, in all human pro-

</p>
<p>there be a necessity for the precedent offered bj the Force Bill
</p>
<p>of 1833/
</p>
<p>We have adverted to bills offered early in the session, for a
</p>
<p>reduction of the tariff. The increasing excitement and disa-
</p>
<p>greement on the subject, the apparently irreconcileable hostili-
</p>
<p>ty of South Carolina to the principle of protection, and the
</p>
<p>danger menacing Calhoun himself of arrest for treason, all con-
</p>
<p>spired to impel Clay into concessions which virtually abro-
</p>
<p>gated his "American System," by substituting for the tariff
</p>
<p>of 1832 a graduated scale, detracting from the duties one-tenth
</p>
<p>each year upon all articles tariffed over twenty per cent, thus
</p>
<p>gradually reducing the duties until they should strike the free
</p>
<p>list, in December, 1841. That this was a triumph for the nul-
</p>
<p>lificators is not to be denied. The bill was designed as a
</p>
<p>compromise, but conceded most of the premises claimed by
</p>
<p>Mr. Calhoun in regard to the tariff principle. It was a great
</p>
<p>sacrifice to make, immensely involved as the Northern and
</p>
<p>Central States had become in manufactures, and dependent as
</p>
<p>thousands were upon manufacturing enterprise for maintenance.
</p>
<p>But, taking counsel of his fears, and impressed by a sense of
</p>
<p>devotion to the Union, the " great Pacificator" astounded his
</p>
<p>friends and the country by voluntarily abandoning his own
</p>
<p>distinctive system in the moment of its greatest success. This
</p>
<p>momentous abjuration was to stay a collision then impending,
</p>
<p>which must precipitate civil war  at least so Mr. Clay assumed.
</p>
<p> Mr. Calhoun himself was constrained to endorse, in effect, the necessity of coer-
</p>
<p>cion, in certain cases. In 1843, during the famous Dorr rebellion in Rhode Island,
</p>
<p>Mr. Calhoun, then a member of President Tyler's Cabinet, took decided ground
</p>
<p>against any attempt, on the part of any portion of our people, to redress real or
</p>
<p>fancied wrongs, or to change the institutions of the country by force, saying:
</p>
<p>" The very complication of our system of Government  so many distinct, sove-
</p>
<p>reign and independent States, each with its separate Government, and all united
</p>
<p>under one  is calculated to give force to discussion and agitation never before
</p>
<p>known, and to cause a diffusion of political intelligence heretofore unknown in the

<p>history of the world, if the Federal Government shall do its duty under the guaran-
</p>
<p>tees of the Constitution by promptly suppressing physical force as an element of change,
</p>
<p>and keeping wide open the door for the full and free action of all the moral ele-
</p>
<p>ments in its favor. No people ever had so fair a start. All that is lacking is, that
</p>
<p>we sliall understand, in all its great and beautiful proportions, the noble political
</p>
<p>Structure reared by the wisdom and patriotism of our ancestors, and to have the

<p>be yielding great principles to faction. The time has come to
</p>
<p>test the strength of the Constitution and the Government."
</p>
<p>He had heartily supported the Force Bill. Although opposed,
</p>
<p>politically, to the Administration, he had said: "I believe the
</p>
<p>country in considerable danger ; I believe an unlawful combi-
</p>
<p>nation threatens the integrity of the Union. I believe the cri-
</p>
<p>sis calls for a mild, temperate, forbearing, but inflexibly firm
</p>
<p>execution of the laws. And, under this conviction, I give a
</p>
<p>hearty support to this Administration, in all measures which
</p>
<p>I deem to be fair, just and necessary. And in supporting these
</p>
<p>measures I mean to take my fair share of responsibility, to
</p>
<p>support them frankly and fau'ly, without reflections on the
</p>
<p>past and mixing other topics in their discussion." He was ut-
</p>
<p>terly opposed to compromising and temporizing measures with
</p>
<p>a rebellious faction, and told Mr. Clay so ; and from that time
</p>
<p>he was not approached by those who were willing to shield
</p>
<p>conspirators from the sword of justice.
</p>
<p>* Mr. Clay drew up a compromise bill and sent it to Mr.
</p>
<p>Calhoun by Mr, Letcher. Calhoun objected to parts of the
</p>
<p>bill most decidedly, and remarked that if Clay knew the na-
</p>
<p>ture of his objections he would at least modify those portions
</p>
<p>of the bill. Letcher made arrangements for a personal inter-
</p>
<p>view between these eminent Senators, who had not been on
</p>
<p>speaking terms for some time. The imperious Clay demanded
</p>
<p>that it should be at his own room. The imperiled Calhoun
</p>
<p>consented to go there. The meeting was civil but icy. The
</p>
<p>business was immediately entered upon. The principals were
</p>
<p>unyielding, and the conference ended without results.
</p>
<p>Letcher now hastened to the President and sounded him on
</p>
<p>the subject of compromise. "Compromise!" said the stern
</p>
<p>old man, stern only toward wickedness, "I will make no com-
</p>
<p>promise with traitors. I will have no negotiations. I will ex-
</p>
<p>ecute the laws. Calhoun shall be tried for treason, and hang-
</p>
<p>ed if found guilty, if he does not instantly cease his rebellious

</p>
<p>course." Letcher now flew to M'Duffie, Calhoun's ardent
</p>
<p>friend, and alarmed him with a startling picture of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's wrath. That night, after he had retired to bed, Letcher
</p>
<p>was aroused by a Senator from Louisiana, who informed him
</p>
<p>SECRET HISTORY. 437
</p>
<p>that Jackson would not allow any more delay, and that Cal-
</p>
<p>houn's arrest might take place any hour. He begged Letcher
</p>
<p>to warn Calhoun of his danger. He did so. He found the
</p>
<p>South Carolinian in bed. He told him of the temper and the
</p>
<p>ntentions of the President, and the Conspirator was much
</p>
<p>alarmed.
</p>
<p>' Meanwhile Mr. Clay and J. M. Clayton, of Delaware, had
</p>
<p>been in frequent consultations on the subject. Clayton had
</p>
<p>said to Clay, while his bill was lingering in the House, "These
</p>
<p>South Carolinians act very badly, but they are good fellows,
</p>
<p>and it is a pity to let Jackson hang them ;" and advised him
</p>
<p>to get his bill referred to a new committee, and so modify it as
</p>
<p>to make it acceptable to a majority. Clay did so, and Clayton
</p>
<p>exerted all his influence to avert the calamity which hung over
</p>
<p>Calhoun and his friends. He assembled the manufacturers
</p>
<p>who had hurried to the Capital when they heard of the Com-
</p>
<p>promise Bill, to see whether they would not yield something
</p>
<p>for the sake of conciliation and the Union. At a sacrifice of
</p>
<p>their interests, these loyal men did yield, and agreed to with-
</p>
<p>draw all opposition to the bill, and let it pass the Senate, pro-
</p>
<p>viding the nullifiers should vote for certain amendments made
</p>
<p>by the Lower House, as well as for the bill itself. The nulli-
</p>
<p>fiers in committee would not yield. The crisis had arrived
</p>
<p>The gallows was placed before Calhoun's eyes. Clayton ear-
</p>
<p>nestly remonstrated with him. He pointed out the danger, the
</p>
<p>folly, the wickedness of his course ; and notified him that un-
</p>
<p>less the amendments were adopted, and that by the votes of
</p>
<p>himself and political friends, the bill should not pass ; that he
</p>
<p>(Clayton) would move to lay it on the table when it should be
</p>
<p>reported to the Senate, and that he had strength enough in that
</p>
<p>House pledged to do it. " The President will then," he said,
</p>
<p>"be left free to execute the laws in full rigor." His object, he
</p>
<p>told them plainly, was to put them squarely on the record ; to
</p>
<p>make all the nullifiers vote for the amendments and the bill,

</p>
<p>and thus cut them off" from the plea of "unconstitutionality,"
</p>
<p>which they would raise if the bill and amendments did not re-
</p>
<p>ceive their votes. Unless they were so bound he knew that
</p>
<p>the present pacification would be only a hollow truce, and that

</p>
<p>tliey would make this very measure, probably, a pretense for
</p>
<p>renewing their resistance to what they were pleased to call
</p>
<p>" unconstitutional measures" of the National Government, and
</p>
<p>for resuming their march toward secession and independence.
</p>
<p>He was peremptory with both Clay and Calhoun, and warned
</p>
<p>them that this was a last chance for a compromise.
</p>
<p>' Mr. Clayton was inexorable. Clay and Calhoun agreed to
</p>
<p>the amendments. These with the bill were reported to the
</p>
<p>Senate, All the nuUiiiers voted for the amendments in order,
</p>
<p>until they came to the last, that of home valuation, which was
</p>
<p>so revolting to the great leader of the Conspirators. When
</p>
<p>that came up Calhoun and his friends met it with the most
</p>
<p>violent opposition. It was the last day but one of the session,
</p>
<p>and at a late hour in the day. Finding the nullifiers persist-
</p>
<p>ent in their opposition, Clayton, to their great consternation,
</p>
<p>suddenly executed his threat. He moved to lay the bill on
</p>
<p>the table, and declared it should continue to lie there. Mr.
</p>
<p>Clay begged him to withdraw his motion. Others entreated
</p>
<p>him to give a little more time. He was inflexible. There was
</p>
<p>fluttering in the bevy of nullifiers. Calhoun and his friends
</p>
<p>retired behind the collonade back of the Speaker's chair, over
</p>
<p>which was the portrait of Washington, the great Unionist, and
</p>
<p>there held a brief consultation. It was very brief, for time
</p>
<p>and opportunity were precious. Senator Bibb came from the
</p>
<p>trembling conclave and asked Clayton to give a little more
</p>
<p>time. This was a token of yielding, and he complied. He
</p>
<p>withdrew his motion, but with the declaration that unless the
</p>
<p>measure, in full, was voted for by all the nullifiers he should
</p>
<p>renew it Instantly one of their friends moved an adjournment
</p>
<p>It was carried, and the conspirators went home
</p>
<p> " to sleep, perchance to dream,"
</p>
<p>on their predicament They knew of only one way, and that
</p>
<p>a most thorny one for their pride, still open for their escape.

<p>ity of his promises. So they concluded to vote as Mr. Clayton
</p>
<p>demanded, but begged that gentleman to spare Mr. Cal-
</p>
<p>houn the mortification of appearing on the record in favor

<p>of a measure against which at that very time, and at his

<p>instance, troops were being raised in Soutli Carolina, and be-
</p>
<p>cause of wliicb the politicians of that State were preparing to
</p>
<p>declare her secession from the Union ! Mr. Clayton would not
</p>
<p>yield a jot. Calhoun was the chief of sinners in this matter,
</p>
<p>and he, of all others, must give the world public and recorded
</p>
<p>evidence of penitence, whatever his "mental reservations"
</p>
<p>might be. "Nothing would be conceded," Mr. Clayton said,
</p>
<p>"unless his vote appears in favor of the measure."
</p>
<p>' The Senate met ; the bill was taken up ; and the nullifiers
</p>
<p>and their friends, one after another, yielded their objections on

<p>various pretenses. At length, when all had voted but Mr.
</p>
<p>Calhoun, he arose, pale and haggard, for he had had a most
</p>
<p>terrific struggle. He declared that he had then to determine
</p>
<p>which way he should vote, and at the termination of his brief
</p>
<p>remarks he gave his vote in the affirmative with the rest. It
</p>
<p>was a bitter pill for that proud man to swallow. The alterna-
</p>
<p>tive presented to him was absolute humiliation or the gallows.
</p>
<p>He chose the former. With that act fell the great Conspirac_j
</p>
<p>to break up the Government of the United States in 1832.
</p>
<p>The violent clamors raised in South Carolina and the Gulf
</p>
<p>States on the appearance of Jackson's Proclamation soon ceas-
</p>
<p>ed. ' The Ordinance of Nullification was repealed, and Nullifier
</p>
<p>JDecame, as it deserved to be, a term of reproach throughout
</p>
<p>most of the Union.'
</p>
<p>All this sounds very much like a story for effect ; but, writ-
</p>
<p>ten by Benton, and published during Jackson's life-time, it doubtr
</p>
<p>less is, in the main, a correct version of the matter. It shows
</p>
<p>that the nullifier had to concede a little to gain much.
</p>
<p>' But, to revert to the " seat of war.'? Governor Hayne's troops
</p>
<p>were put in process of organization. Military pomp and cir-
</p>
<p>cumstance reigned in Charleston. The " fiery heart" of South

<p>silent admonition of Moultrie's guns and Scott's presence. As
</p>
<p>early as October, 1832, the watchful eye of the President had

<p>detected the gathering cloud in the South, and then took steps

<p>to place the Charleston forts in a condition of security from

</p>
<p>seizure. The order issued to Major Heileman (October 29t"h)
</p>
<p>read : '
</p>
<p>" It IS deemed necessary that the officers in the harbor of Charleston
</p>
<p>should be advised of the possibility of attempts being made to surprise,
</p>
<p>seize and occupy the forts committed to them. You are therefore espe-
</p>
<p>cially charged to use your utmost vigilance in counteracting such at-
</p>
<p>tempts. You will call personally on the commanders of Castle Pinckney
</p>
<p>and Fort Moultrie, and instruct them to be vigilant to prevent surprise
</p>
<p>in the night, or by day, on the part of any set of people whatever, who
</p>
<p>may approach the forts with a view to seize and occupy them. You
</p>
<p>will warn the said officers that such an event is apprehended, and that
</p>
<p>they will be held responsible for the defense, to the last extremity, of
</p>
<p>the forts and garrisons under their respective commands^ against any
</p>
<p>assault, and also against intrigue and surprise. The attempt to surprise
</p>
<p>the forts and garrisons, it is expected, will be made by the militia, and
</p>
<p>it must be guarded against by constant vigilance, and repulsed at every
</p>
<p>hazard. These instructions you will be careful not to show to any per-
</p>
<p>sons, other than the commanding officers of Castle Pinckney and Fort
</p>
<p>Moultrie."
</p>
<p>On the 7th of November two companies of artillery were or-
</p>
<p>dered to proceed forthwith to Fort Moultrie, On the 12th a
</p>
<p>further order to Major Heileman directed the "citadel" in
</p>
<p>Charleston, belonging to the State, to be delivered up, with the
</p>
<p>State arms, if required, though any attack was to be resisted.
</p>
<p>On the 18th a confidential order, issued to General Scott, indi-
</p>
<p>cated the President's alarm at the approaching act of resistance.
</p>
<p>We quote from it :
</p>
<p>"The possibility of such a measure furnishes sufficient reason for
</p>
<p>guarding against it, and the President is therefore anxious that the sit-
</p>
<p>uation and means of defense of these fortifications, should be inspected
</p>
<p>by an officer of experience, who could also estimate and provide for any
</p>
<p>dangers to which they may be exposed. He has full confidence in your
</p>
<p>judgment and discretion, and it is his wish that you repair immediately
</p>
<p>to Charleston, and examine every thing connected with the fortifications.

<p>You are at liberty to take such measures, either by strengthening these
</p>
<p>defenses, or by reenforcing these garrisons with troops drawn from any
</p>
<p>other posts, as you may think prudence and a just precaution require.
</p>
<p>" Your duty will be one of great importance, and of great delicacy.
</p>
<p>You will consult fully and freely with the collector of the port of Charles-
</p>
<p>ton, and with the district attorney of South Carolina, and you will take
</p>
<p>no step, except what relates to the immediate defense and security of

<p>the posts, without their order and concurrence. The execution of the
</p>
<p>laws will be enforced through the civil authority, and by the mode
</p>
<p>pointed out by the acts of Congress. Should, unfortunately, a crisis
</p>
<p>arise, when the ordinary power in the hands of the civil officers shall
</p>
<p>not be sufficient for this purpose, the President shall determine the
</p>
<p>course to be taken and the measures adopted. Till, therefore, you are
</p>
<p>otherwise instructed, you will act in obedience to the legal requisitioua
</p>
<p>of the proper civil officers of the United States.
</p>
<p>" I will thank you to communicate to me, freely and confidentially,
</p>
<p>upon every topic which you may deem it important for the Government
</p>
<p>to receive information."
</p>
<p>This emanated from General Lewis Cass, then Secretary of
</p>
<p>War. / Acting under it, and also of verbal instructions given
</p>
<p>by the President, Scott proceeded to Charleston, arriving there
</p>
<p>two days after the passage of the Ordinance. All was excite-
</p>
<p>ment, but the representation that Scott was making his annual
</p>
<p>tour of inspection of fortresses and arsenals, served to shield
</p>
<p>his presence from suspicion. He was enabled to execute his
</p>
<p>mission, without at all exciting the attention of the State au-
</p>
<p>thorities, or provoking the temper of an exasperated populace.
</p>
<p>He passed on to Augusta and secretly placed the arsenal there
</p>
<p>in order of defense. The fortifications of Savannah were also
</p>
<p>quietly reenforced to a state of complete security. This ac-
</p>
<p>complished he returned to Charleston, where a number of
</p>
<p>armed vessels seemed to drop in ly accident These were so
</p>
<p>disposed as to act promptly in event of emergency. It was
</p>
<p>determined by the Collector and District Attorney to collect
</p>
<p>the revenue under the guns of Fort Moultrie, should Governor
</p>
<p>Hayne, after February 1st, attempt to nullify the laws.
</p>
<p>Every thing being thus admirably prepared to enforce the
</p>
<p>collection of the duties, Scott sailed for New York where
</p>
<p>such other steps were taken as were necessary to insure exten-
</p>
<p>sive reenforcements of both army and navy if they should be
</p>
<p>required. Of course the public, generally, knew nothing of

<p>these movements : the newspapers of that day were not so " en-
</p>
<p>terprising" as to pry into the most important secrets of Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and to publish all they knew and a little more, by ad-
</p>
<p>ding surmises to facts, to the great detriment of their country.
</p>
<p>Consequently, Scott again sailed (late in January, 1833) to
</p>
<p>442 THE NULLIFICATION REBELLION.
</p>
<p>Charleston harbor unheralded, and was in Fort Moultrie for a
</p>
<p>number of days ere the Charlestonians themselves knew of his
</p>
<p>presence. Then thej first awakened to a realizing sense
</p>
<p>of their condition : there ivere means, at tlie disposal of the
</p>
<p>Federal officers, for enforcing the laws, and Scott was to be the
</p>
<p>instrument of such enforcement.
</p>
<p>The nullifiers were extremely angered at this state of affairs,
</p>
<p>while the Unionists  a strong and powerful party  were de-
</p>
<p>lighted. The latter had been somewhat overawed by the vio-
</p>
<p>lence of the nullifiers, whose party comprised all the worst ele-
</p>
<p>ments and some of the best elements of the State ; but, now
</p>
<p>that the Government, to which they owed their first allegiance,
</p>
<p>had shown its ability and willingness to protect them, the law
</p>
<p>and order men came out boldly for the Union and the laws.
</p>
<p>This threw new force into the excitement, and, before February
</p>
<p>1st, the people were waging among themselves a storm of fac-
</p>
<p>tions which, for a while, threatened bloodshed and all the hor-
</p>
<p>rors of civil strife. ^
</p>
<p>During this internecine war the United States officers and
</p>
<p>troops were extremely cautious not to give cause for any out-
</p>
<p>bursts of violence toward them, on the part of the excited nul-
</p>
<p>lifiers. They treated all courteously, and, even rendered such
</p>
<p>implicit obedience to orders as not to resent indignities fre-
</p>
<p>quently offered them in the streets, and on the waters of the
</p>
<p>harbor.
</p>
<p>The 1st of February came, when the belligerents thought it
</p>
<p>'prudent to "wait a little longer" before inaugurating the war
</p>
<p>with Government, and a few of the leading nullifiers of Charles-
</p>
<p>ton, therefore, assembled, just before the 1st of February, to
</p>
<p>agre not to enforce the said " ordinance," passed by convention
</p>
<p>of the whole State, until after the adjournment of Congress
</p>
<p>(March 3d). So effectually was the whole movement of resist-
</p>
<p>ance to authority in tlie hands of a few men.
</p>
<p>Scott played a most delicate and important part in this mat-

<p>ter, for with him really rested the issue of peace or blood. One
</p>
<p>injudicious act  one hasty word  one failure to take advantage
</p>
<p>of every opportunity offered for pacification  might have pro-

</p>
<p>net's point. The Government chose most wisely in sending
</p>
<p>him thither, and the country has ever felt that his wisdom and
</p>
<p>prudence averted a conflict between the State and the General
</p>
<p>Government which must have cost all parties dearly.
</p>
<p>Alas, that the same wisdom and prudence had not been per-
</p>
<p>mitted the control of affairs in 1860 !
</p>
<p>The fact that a few men in Charleston should temporarily
</p>
<p>suspend the Ordinance was significant of the popular feeling
</p>
<p>against it, in defiance of the overwhelming voice for the Con-
</p>
<p>vention. And other acts proved that the Calhoun party,
</p>
<p>tliough it had obtained the ascendancy, did not control the
</p>
<p>current, for a great length of time. Thus the Ordinance re-
</p>
<p>quired citizens of South Carolina to take a test oath of alle-
</p>
<p>giance to the State. This the State Court of Appeals soon set
</p>
<p>aside' as unconstitutional and void because inconsistent with
</p>
<p>the allegiance of the citizen to the Federal Government. In
</p>
<p>Greenville district the Union party was in the ascendant and
</p>
<p>bad resolved that the Ordinance must be enforced at the bay-
</p>
<p>onet's point before they would submit to it. Pettigru, Colonel
</p>
<p>Drayton, and Poinsett led the Union clubs, which, during Jan-
</p>
<p>uary, became so powerful as to intimidate the nullifiers more
</p>
<p>than Scott's troopers could have done. It was apparent to
</p>
<p>South Carolinians by Feb. 1st, that the Ordinance was explod-
</p>
<p>ed without any action on the part of Congress, and the resolve
</p>
<p>of a few citizens of Charleston not to enforce the mandate of
</p>
<p>insurrection and rebellion simply was an unauthorized but ne-
</p>
<p>cessary effort to save nullification from utter default by reason
</p>
<p>of its non-appearance at the summons !
</p>
<p>Circumstances conspired auspiciously, however, to help the
</p>
<p>" fire eaters" out of their ridiculous dilemma. Virginia, al-
</p>
<p>though in the heat of her patriotic zeal for " Southern institi>
</p>
<p>tions" she had resolved (in December) to sustain South Caro-
</p>
<p>lina, in January resolved differently, by adopting a series of

<p>missioner to proceed to South Carolina to use his influence for
</p>
<p>conciliation and adjustment. This commissioner, Benjamin
</p>
<p>W. Leigh, reached Charleston early in February, when the
</p>
<p>nullifiers were looking most anxiously for some honorable es-
</p>
<p>cape from their dilemma. The commissioner was welcomed
</p>
<p>as a friend. Ex-Governor Hamilton reassembled the Conven-
</p>
<p>tion, and it was resolved to accept of Yirginia's overtures if
</p>
<p>Congress should abate the revenue  a result so likely to occur
</p>
<p>that public excitement, even among the most ardent nullifiers,

<p>waned rapidly, and the Convention held its informal sessions

<p>rapid modes of conveyance, he reached the State Capital to

<p>find the Convention calmly awaiting their leader's coming.

<p>and peace once again settled within Carolina's fair domain.
</p>
<p>THE "PATRIOT" WAR.
</p>
<p>The "Patriot" war is still fresh in the memory of thousands
</p>
<p>living along the northern frontier. Originating, like most rev-
</p>
<p>olutions, in the fertile brains of uneasy spirits, it at one time
</p>
<p>threatened to embroil this Government in serious trouble with
</p>
<p>Great Britain. The yoke of the English crown never has rest-
</p>
<p>ed easily upon the French inhabitants of the Canadas. They
</p>
<p>are, almost without exception, rigid Roman Catholics  the
</p>
<p>English are Protestant : they are purely Gallic in blood  the
</p>
<p>English are Anglo-Saxon with a strong admixture of the stern
</p>
<p>Scotch element : they are clannish, uncompromising, unloyal
</p>
<p> the English, equally sectional and obstinate, are loyal to tLeir
</p>
<p>Queen to the last. It is not strange that such negatives should
</p>
<p>not assimilate, and it is not a matter of surprise that the French,
</p>
<p>in Lower Canada, should hatch revolt.
</p>
<p>The movement took shape late in 1837, and then broke out
</p>
<p>into open insurrection. The Canadians in Upper Canada soon
</p>
<p>caught the infection. The cry of " Freedom and a Confederacy
</p>
<p>of our own" flew from Quebec to the Georgian wilds. It cross-
</p>
<p>ed the frontier to arouse enthusiasm and sympathy. Let the
</p>
<p>rallying cry only be " Liberty ! " and our American population
</p>
<p>would co-operate in a scheme for invading Siberia, if a leader
</p>
<p>could be found for such a frigid service. The cry of " Freedom
</p>
<p>for the Canadas from British domination," awakened the echoes
</p>
<p>" Aye ! " from thousands on this side of the line, and it was not
</p>
<p>long before arms, provisions, troops and means were passing

</p>
<p>miicli strength, at several points, along the soutliern shore of
</p>
<p>the Lakes. Co-operation became open and undisguised, so
</p>
<p>much so that the President issued a proclamation for order and
</p>
<p>neutrality. It fell upon ears deadened to authority  "patriot-
</p>
<p>ism" was superior to the claims of law and order.
</p>
<p>Late in December (1837) one Van Eensselaer organized a
</p>
<p>troop of " patriots," and passing from Schlosser over to Navy
</p>
<p>Island (British territory) in the Niagara river, occupied it The
</p>
<p>steamer Caroline was engaged to transport troops, provisions,
</p>
<p>etc., to the island, from Schlosser. This movement induced
</p>
<p>the British to make a descent on the steamer  thus to cut off
</p>
<p>Van Eensselaer's supplies. Unfortunately they acted unad-
</p>
<p>visedly, for they entered upon American territory to effect their
</p>
<p>purpose. The Caroline was found at the dock in Schlosser,
</p>
<p>loaded with a mass of curiosity seekers and a few patriots.
</p>
<p>The crowd was unarmed, and little resistance was offered save
</p>
<p>by fists and billets of wood. One citizen was killed and eight
</p>
<p>wounded in the melee. Clearing the steamer of her company,
</p>
<p>she was cut loose and sent over the Falls (Dec. 27th).
</p>
<p>This act excited the entire country, for, beyond doubt, it was
</p>
<p>a causus belli News of the event reached Washington in a few
</p>
<p>days, when Major-General Scott was ordered to the frontier to
</p>
<p>repress trespass from our side, and prevent further aggressions
</p>
<p>of the British authorities, while our Government took immedi-
</p>
<p>ate steps to demand atonement of Great Britain for the outrage
</p>
<p>on the Caroline. He hastened to the Niagara frontier accom-
</p>
<p>panied by Governor Marcy, of New York, by whom volunteers
</p>
<p>were furnished for any emergency which might arise. Scott
</p>
<p>determined to act to the fullest extent of his authority in sup-
</p>
<p>pressing American co-operation with the revolutionists. His
</p>
<p>sudden appearance on the scene caused considerable stir among
</p>
<p>the " patriots," who soon became painfully aware of their lia-
</p>
<p>bility to arrest and imprisonment. In consequence, their move-
</p>
<p>ments were considerably restricted, and the spring of the year

<p>1838 found them disorganized and powerless.
</p>
<p>Immediately after the affair of the Caroline, British troops
</p>
<p>gathered in considerable force, opposite the western end of Navy
</p>
<p>Island, where three armed schooners were also anchored, to
</p>
<p>MOVEMENTS OF GENERAL SCOTT. 447
</p>
<p>intercept the passage up tlie river of tlie steamer Barcelona.
</p>
<p>This steamer had been taken from Buffalo down to Schlosser
</p>
<p>for the use of the forces still on Navy Island. Scott had, how-
</p>
<p>ever, forestalled the " patriots," by chartering her before they
</p>
<p>could arrange to indemnify her owners from loss. He imme-
</p>
<p>diately ordered her to return to Buffalo, at the same time ad-
</p>
<p>vising the British commander that he should instantly repel
</p>
<p>any attack made in American waters upon our vessels or citi-
</p>
<p>zens. The little steamer came up (January 16th), in the Amer-
</p>
<p>ican channel of the river. Scott had anchored a battery oppo-
</p>
<p>site the Canadian encampment, prepared to open fire the moment
</p>
<p>the British should throw a ball at the Barcelona. This deter-
</p>
<p>mined action caused them to let the steamer pass, although
</p>
<p>fires were lit and matches were ready for the bombardment, on
</p>
<p>both sides.
</p>
<p>The day previous (January 15th) Yan Eensselaer and his
</p>
<p>troop of a few gentlemen and many vagabonds, had recrossed
</p>
<p>from the island to the American shore, where they were arrest-
</p>
<p>ed by the U. S. Marshal.
</p>
<p>During the winter Scott was tireless in his efforts to appease
</p>
<p>popular excitement along the frontier, and to prevent infrac-
</p>
<p>tions of the neutrality laws. He had to co-operate with him
</p>
<p>Generals Brady, Wool, Worth and Eustis, who were placed in
</p>
<p>charge of special sections of the border, while he passed to and
</p>
<p>fro along the entire line, from Detroit to Vermont, exercising
</p>
<p>his authority, unaided by troops, against a populace determined
</p>
<p>upon giving aid and comfort to the Canadians. His exertions
</p>
<p>were crowned with success, so far as to save the Americans
</p>
<p>from actual trespass. By April the British authorities succeed-
</p>
<p>ed in suppressing the revolt for the moment.
</p>
<p>Scott acted throughout with great prudence and wisdom,
</p>
<p>and was freely complimented for his services. Probably no
</p>
<p>other man in America could have stayed, so effectually, the
</p>
<p>rush to arms on this side of the border  an act which, if it had

<p>DORR'S REBELIION,
</p>
<p>This merely local "Eebellion" deserves mention rather from
</p>
<p>its peculiar nature than from its importance. Its circumstances
</p>
<p>were as follows :
</p>
<p>Down to 1833 the government of Ehode Island was based
</p>
<p>upon the original charter of settlement, granted by Charles IL
</p>
<p>in 1663, by which the elective franchise was restricted to per-
</p>
<p>sons possessed of real estate to a specified amount, and to their
</p>
<p>eldest sons. This disfranchised fully two thirds of the actual
</p>
<p>citizens. Yet, so prevalent were old prejudices, so powerful
</p>
<p>old associations, that the Legislature steadily refused to substi-
</p>
<p>tute a more modern and republican constitution for the old,
</p>
<p>but simple and strong government of the Charter. Thomas
</p>
<p>W. Dorr, an attorney at law, of Providence, and a member of
</p>
<p>the Assembly, sought to introduce a reform ; but, for a long
</p>
<p>time labored in vain. When brought to a vote his proposition
</p>
<p>for a change obtained only seven out of seventy votes. Not
</p>
<p>to be thwarted, Dorr then appealed to the people, agitating the
</p>
<p>question of change and reform in several mass conventions,
</p>
<p>held in 1840-41. When the movement had gained sufficient
</p>
<p>strength, a Convention of Delegates was called, which prepared
</p>
<p>a State Constitution to be submitted to a regular vote of the
</p>
<p>people. It obtained 14,000 votes  said to have been a clear
</p>
<p>majority of the regular citizens of the State. The Chartists
</p>
<p>pronounced the entire proceedings seditious and declared the
</p>
<p>vote, illegal as it was, to have been largely fraudulent. Dorr
</p>
<p>decided otherwise; and, with true Puritan pertinacity, pro-
</p>
<p>claimed the Constitution to be the law of the State. He or-
</p>
<p>dered, accordingly, an election to be held for State officers.

</p>
<p>Dorr was chosen Governor, and a Legislature composed ex-
</p>
<p>450 dorr's rebellion.
</p>
<p>clusively of his supporters, was elected, to meet at Providence
</p>
<p>on the first Monday of May, 1842. The Charter party also
</p>
<p>held an election for State oflicers, polling 5,700 votes, while
</p>
<p>the suffrage party claimed to have polled 7,800.
</p>
<p>On the 3d of May, Dorr's Government attempted to organ-
</p>
<p>ize at Providence and seize the reins of power. They were
</p>
<p>resisted by the legal State Government, which assembled at
</p>
<p>Newport on the same day, and at the head of which was Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Samuel .W. King. Both sides appealed to arms. The
</p>
<p>excitement was intense, and the people flocked to the respect-
</p>
<p>ive standards in large numbers from various New England
</p>
<p>States. Governor King proclaimed the State under martial
</p>
<p>law, called out the militia and asked and obtained the aid of
</p>
<p>the United States to suppress the treason. On the 13th of
</p>
<p>May a portion of the Suffrage party assembled at Providence
</p>
<p>under arms and attempted to seize the arsenal, but were dis-
</p>
<p>persed by Governor King and a military force. They assem-
</p>
<p>bled again, to the number of several hundred. May 25th, 1842,
</p>
<p>at Chepachet Hill, ten miles from Providence, but again dis-
</p>
<p>persed on the approach of the State forces. Three days after-
</p>
<p>wards the affair was over. Dorr fled from the State, and took
</p>
<p>refuge first in Connecticut, and then in New Hampshire. A
</p>
<p>reward of $4000 being offered for his apprehension by Rhode
</p>
<p>Island, he voluntarily returned home, was tried, convicted of
</p>
<p>high treason, and sentenced to imprisonment for life. In 1847
</p>
<p>he was pardoned, and, in 1852, the Legislature restored him to
</p>
<p>his civil rights, and ordered the record of his sentence to be
</p>
<p>expunged. He lived to see a liberal constitution and his par-

<p>THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>The early history of the "Western States is full of tragedies,
</p>
<p>but that of Kansas is, literally written in blood. The war of
</p>
<p>sections which raged within her lines during her territorial
</p>
<p>term, and the commingled outrage, crime and political wrong
</p>
<p>through which she passed to attain her present position in
</p>
<p>the Union have conspired to render her very name synony
</p>
<p>mous with violence.
</p>
<p>To understand fully the nature of the matter it will be neces-
</p>
<p>sary to revert to the first legislation affecting her destiny  the
</p>
<p>Compromise act of 1820.
</p>
<p>In 1818 the territory of Missouri, comprising the Northern
</p>
<p>portion of what was the old French-Spanish domain of Louisi-
</p>
<p>ana, came forward with a constitution for admission to the
</p>
<p>Union as a State. Louisiana, running from the Gulf to as far
</p>
<p>north as the undefined lines of the'great " North West Terri-
</p>
<p>tory," was purchased from France in 1803, not more to com-
</p>
<p>mand the entire course of the Mississippi river than to add to
</p>
<p>the Slave States new territory, by which to preserve their
</p>
<p>" balance of power" in the Union  by which simply was meant
</p>
<p>the ascendancy of Slave States in the Congress and the per-
</p>
<p>petuation of their control exercised over the Executive chair.'
</p>
<p>* It is, as Mr. Everett has stated : " Out of seventy-two years (up to the date of
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's election) since the organization of this Government the Executive
</p>
<p>chair has, for sixty-four years, been filled nearly all the time by Southern Presi-
</p>
<p>dents, or when not by Southern men, by those possessing the confidence of the
</p>
<p>South. For a still longer period the controlling influences of the Legislative and
</p>
<p>Judicial Departments of the Government have centered in the same quarter. Of
</p>
<p>all the ofiSces in the gift of the central power, in every department, far more than
</p>
<p>hat proportionate share has always been enjoyed by the South."

</p>
<p>462 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.''
</p>
<p>As slavery existed in the Frencli domain it was witti some as-
</p>
<p>tonishment that Southern men beheld any opposition to
</p>
<p>the admission of Missouri because of a slave clause in her con-
</p>
<p>stitution. Her admission was opposed for the reason that the
</p>
<p>act would amount to a recognition of the right of slave exten-
</p>
<p>sion over the Territories of the United States. The anti-Slave
</p>
<p>States and element had resolved to grant no further " rights"
</p>
<p>in the matter  holding that slavery was a wrong not to be ex-
</p>
<p>tended. The South, equally determined, resolved the State
</p>
<p>should have Slavery if it wanted it, thereby assuming that po-
</p>
<p>sition which it ever after persistently maintained  of a Slave
</p>
<p>right in the Territories. The issue, thus squarely presented,
</p>
<p>was met in the House of Representatives by a bill (introduced,
</p>
<p>Feb. 1819, by Mr. Tallmadge, of New York,) prohibiting Sla-
</p>
<p>very, " except for the punishment of crimes ; and that all chil-
</p>
<p>dren born in the said State after the admission thereof into the
</p>
<p>Union, shall be free at the age of twenty-five years." This
</p>
<p>passed the House, but was lost in the Senate. For eighteen
</p>
<p>months the discussion was continued in both branches of Con-
</p>
<p>gress V7ith great ability, and not withouf great excitement,
</p>
<p>which extended to every section of the Union,
</p>
<p>On the one hand, it was contended that the ordinance of
</p>
<p>1787, which excluded Slavery from all territory north-west of
</p>
<p>the river Ohio, was a public recognition of the principles of
</p>
<p>the people of the United States in regard to the establishment
</p>
<p>of Slavery in new States and Territories in that region, and
</p>
<p>that the proposal to establish it in Missouri was a direct viola-
</p>
<p>tion of those fundamental principles. On the other hand, it
</p>
<p>was urged that Slavery was incorporated in the system of so-
</p>
<p>ciety when Louisiana was purchased from the French ; and
</p>
<p>that, as the faith of the United States was pledged by treaty to
</p>
<p>all the inhabitants of that wide domain to maintain their rights
</p>
<p>and privileges on the same footing with the people of the rest
</p>
<p>of the country, it would be a violation of tliat faith and those

<p>a Nortli already mucli the stronger. Threats were freely ut-
</p>
<p>tered of a dissevered Union. Tallmadge, as the leader of his
</p>
<p>section, dauntlessly replied :
</p>
<p>" Sir, lias it already come to this : that in the Congress of the United
</p>
<p>States  that, in the Legislative councils of Kepublican America, the
</p>
<p>subject of slavery has become a subject of so much feeling  of such deli-
</p>
<p>cacy  of such danger that it cannot safely be discussed ? Are members
</p>
<p>who venture to express their sentiments on this subject, to be accused
</p>
<p>tf talking to the galleries, with intention to excite a sei'vile war; and
</p>
<p>f meriting the fate of Arbuthnot and Ambrister ? Are we to be told
</p>
<p>pf the dissolution of the Union, of civil war and of seas of blood ?
</p>
<p>" Sir, extend your view across the Mississijipi, over your newly acquir-
</p>
<p>ed Territory  a Territory so far surpassing in extent, the limits of your
</p>
<p>present country, that country which gave birth to your nation  which
</p>
<p>Achieved your Revolution  consolidated your Union  formed your Con-
</p>
<p>jtitution, and has subsequently acquired so much glory, hangs but as an
</p>
<p>^pendage to the extended empire over which your Republican Govern-
</p>
<p>heut is now called to bear sway. Look down the long vista of futurity ;
</p>
<p>^e your empire, in extent unequaled, in advantageous situation without

<p>s parallel, and occupying all the valuable part of one continent. Be-
</p>
<p>lold this extended empire, inhabited by the hardy sons of American
</p>
<p>leemen, knowing their rights, and inheriting the will to protect thera

<p>(Jsvners of the soil on which they live, and interested in the institutions

</p>
<p>454 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>This illustrates the spirit which, at that day, swayed the
</p>
<p>hearts of the people of both sections. On the part of the South
</p>
<p>were extreme violence of threat and vituperation ; on the part
</p>
<p>of the North a resolve neither to be cajoled nor bullied into a
</p>
<p>recognition of the right of Slavery extension.
</p>
<p>This struggle was revived at the next session of Congress 
</p>
<p>debates during December 1819 and January 1820 being verj
</p>
<p>acrimonious, with no prospect of agreement. Mr. Thomas, of
</p>
<p>Illinois, then came forward with a ' compromise' measure, pro-
</p>
<p>posing to admit Missouri as a Slave State, but, as compensa-
</p>
<p>tion to the North therefor, to exclude the institution foreve*,
</p>
<p>north of the parallel of 36 80'. The act contained this sectior:
</p>
<p>" That in all that Territory ceded by France to the United States ui-
</p>
<p>der the name of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty-six degrees thiry
</p>
<p>minutes north latitude, excepting only such part thereof as is includid
</p>
<p>within the limits of the State contemplated by this act, Slavery and ii
</p>
<p>voluntary servitude, otherwise than in the punishment of crime whea
</p>
<p>of the party shall have been duly convicted, shall be and is herely
</p>
<p>forever prohibited."
</p>
<p>This was acquiesced in by the Free State members, after a
</p>
<p>further resistance, as a settlement of the vexed question ; aid
</p>
<p>it was supposed, on all sides, that there would be no ma-e
</p>
<p>agitation in regard to Slavery. The act gave up to Slavey
</p>
<p>the region,, now embraced in Arkansas, which, in 1836, wis
</p>
<p>admitted as a Slave State without a word of demur because
</p>
<p>the act of 1820 had settled the matter forever. A second ex
</p>
<p>citement occurred when, in November, 1820, the State Consi
</p>
<p>tution of Missouri was presented for approval. It containd,
</p>
<p>among other clauses, one preventing the emigration to tie
</p>
<p>State, for residence or settlement, of free men of color. T.is
</p>
<p>exclusion was offensive to those States wherein colored m-n,
</p>
<p>under various qualifications, had obtained rights of citizenshp.
</p>
<p>The statute provision, therefore, amounted to a prohibition or
</p>
<p>citizens of certain States to enter the limits of Missouri. Tiis

<p>fire-brand was extinguished by Henry Clay, who interposel a
</p>
<p>kind of straw compromise  exacting of the Missouri Legila-
</p>
<p>ture a pledge that " no advantage should be taken of its On-
</p>
<p>stitution" ! and that it should pass no act 'to exclude an} of
</p>
<p>the citizens of either of the States' from the enjoyment of the
</p>
<p>SOUTHERN EXPANSION. 455
</p>
<p>privileges they enjoy under tlie Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States.' * This most remarkable, and, in many respects, prepos-
</p>
<p>terous collocation of words, was accepted by members enough
</p>
<p>to constitute a majority, and thus Missouri came into the Union.
</p>
<p>The vote was : in the House, 86 to 82 ; in the Senate, 28 to 14.
</p>
<p>State by State had been added to the South to retain its
</p>
<p>balance of power and to maintain its supremacy, at least in the
</p>
<p>Senate. Kentucky was ceded by Virginia to " independence"
</p>
<p>in order to make an additional Slave State. Alabama and
</p>
<p>Mississippi were purchased from the Indians and Georgia [see
</p>
<p>page 391] for the same express purpose ; Tennessee was set
</p>
<p>off from North Carolina that the same result might follow ;
</p>
<p>then Louisiana was secured, and admitted ; after the severe
</p>
<p>struggle of 1820-21, she succeeded in contributing two more
</p>
<p>States to the Slave section ; then the Florida swamps and la-
</p>
<p>gunes were absorbed and purchased from Spain to add its quo-
</p>
<p>ta of two slave members to the United States Senate.
</p>
<p>But, in spite of these enormous accessions, the South was
</p>
<p>doomed to a minority in Congress unless more Slave States
</p>
<p>could be secured. The steady prosperity and rapid develope-
</p>
<p>nient of the Free States threatened to overcome this territorial
</p>
<p>aggrandisement of the Slave section by the mere force of pre-
</p>
<p>ponderating masses, and the census of 1840 came, with its
</p>
<p>startling array of figures, like a hand writing on the wall to
</p>
<p>" Southern institutions." What remained for the South but
</p>
<p>final abjuration of its minority rule ? More territory must be
</p>
<p>secured or all was lost. To the North the Slave owners could
</p>
<p>not go, since Jefferson's beneficent act of 1798 prohibited them
</p>
<p>from the entire North-west Territory, and the sentiment of the
</p>
<p>* What " rights" did the black man then " enjoy under the Constitution" ? If
</p>
<p>he enjoyed any " right" how could Missouri deprive him of it ? Therefore the
</p>
<p>preposterous character of the " compromise." The other features of the compro-
</p>
<p>mise  & pledge that the Legislature should not take advantage of its own Oonstitulion
</p>
<p>was, in law, an absurdity. What had the Legislature to do with its State Constitu-

</p>
<p>tion ? A provision to exclude negroes could be enforced by any petty oflBcer or
</p>
<p>citizen, and the Legislature could not help itself! That this " compromise" satis-
</p>
<p>fied a majority proves how easily some men's scruples are put at rest. The com-
</p>
<p>promise introduced by Mr. Thomas was understood to have emanated from Mr.
</p>
<p>Clay. It was worthy the name of ' compromise' ; byt, the last arrant^ement to
</p>
<p>overcome an objection may truly be characterised as absurd.

</p>
<p>people there was extremely hostile to a slave system. To the
</p>
<p>West they could not proceed, for Government had pledged
</p>
<p>that section to the Indians. Conquest alone must come to the
</p>
<p>rescue. Texas, an immense domain, fitted to make five States,
</p>
<p>must be won. The scheme of its " annexation" was soon con-
</p>
<p>ceived and perfected. War was declared upon a flimsy pre-
</p>
<p>text against a weak and distracted neighbor. One hundred
</p>
<p>millions of dollars were spent, and Texas was given over to the
</p>
<p>Slave power to be made into States, as emergencies should re-
</p>
<p>quire ; while New Mexico, with her boundless plains, lay to
</p>
<p>the west, to await the necessity for her introduction to a slave
</p>
<p>proprietary.
</p>
<p>But, even this absorption of an empire did not suffice. The
</p>
<p>census of 1850 again sent consternation into the " balance of
</p>
<p>power" ranks, and excited their leaders to renewed zeal. More
</p>
<p>territory rrmst be had, at any sacrifice. Kansas and Nebraska
</p>
<p>alone offered the soil, but there stood that Gibraltar, the " Com-
</p>
<p>promise Act" of 1821, guaranteeing all that region to Freedom
</p>
<p>FOREVER. Still, the emergency was imperative. Kansas at
</p>
<p>least must be represented on the floors of Congress by a slave
</p>
<p>delegation. The tremendous expansion of the North, in Iowa,
</p>
<p>Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, threatened, by its astonish-
</p>
<p>ing vigor, to leap at once into an uncontrolled majority. Kansas
</p>
<p>lost, all was lost, since Texas could not, for years, gain popu-
</p>
<p>lation enough to allow of her subdivision into several States.
</p>
<p>The scheme was, hence, matured for the repeal of the Compro-
</p>
<p>mise Act. The ground to be taken was first, its unconstitu-
</p>
<p>tionality, despite its acceptance by a Southern ' Democratic'
</p>
<p>President and the endorsement by his Cabinet ; second, its
</p>
<p>non-recognition of the right of the South in the Territories ;
</p>
<p>third, the right of the people of a Territory to make their own
</p>
<p>laws and to choose their own institutions. The sole intent of
</p>
<p>the South, in abrogating the Compromise, was territorial ag-
</p>
<p>grandisement, thus to preserve its superiority in the Senate ;'

<p>* The fortunes of war placed the country in possession of many letters and doc-
</p>
<p>uments which the Southern leaders doubtless never designed should have publicity.
</p>
<p>We have had occasion already to quote from several of such " closet confessions."

<p>bat, to render a repeal of a time-honored contract palatable,
</p>
<p>some poiyular issue was necessary  some plea to commend it
</p>
<p>to the masses and thus to control them at the ballot box. This
</p>
<p>was found in the idea of " Squatter Sovereignty''  the right
</p>
<p>of the people of a Territory to choose their own institutions 
</p>
<p>slaves, polygamy or whatever might be to their taste. W ith
</p>
<p>this the question of repeal was sprung upon Congress  U. S.
</p>
<p>Senator Stephen A. Douglas, as Chairman of the Committee
</p>
<p>on Territories, becoming sponsor for the new child of politics.
</p>
<p>One of Mr. Douglas' biographers disclaims for the Illinois
</p>
<p>Senator the credit or discredit of originality for the measure.
</p>
<p>He says : " Though Mr. Douglas has gained all the credit and
</p>
<p>all the opprobrium of the ' Nebraska Bill,' and to a great ex-
</p>
<p>tent his name is more prominently associated with that, than
</p>
<p>with any previous act of public interest, the truth is, that the
</p>
<p>Kansas-Nebraska Act and its repeal of the Missouri restriction
</p>
<p>was not an original measure. It was but a second volume in
</p>
<p>the history of the struggle for popular right, commenced in the

<p>contest over the Compromise of 1850 ; it was but another act
</p>
<p>in the grand drama which in 1850 had ended with a full recog-
</p>
<p>nition of the freedom of the American people, whether in State
</p>
<p>or Territory, to regulate their own domestic relations without
</p>
<p>interference by Congress. /The Kansas-Nebraska Act was no-
</p>
<p>thing more nor less than an act to extend to the people of Kan-
</p>
<p>sas and Nebraska the same rights and privileges which, in 1850, -
</p>
<p>occurs this passage : " When the results of the-Mexican war brought us new terri-

<p>was the same  i. e., the prohibition of slavery in the Territories. TJie wliolc whig

</p>
<p>sibility of authorship, saying: "Whatever question or doubt
</p>
<p>may have existed or may now exist as to the authorship of the
</p>
<p>Compromise Acts of 1850 respecting the Territories, there is
</p>
<p>not the slightest question as to where the responsibility  the
</p>
<p>honor or blame, the credit or odium  for the Kansas-Nebraska
</p>
<p>Act, belongs. No one has denied that to Stephen A. Douglas
</p>
<p>belongs whatever fame that justly attaches to an act of legis-
</p>
<p>lation, which has been more celebrated (for the censure by its
</p>
<p>enemies, and praise by its friends) than any act of Congress
</p>
<p>since the foundation of the Grovernment. During its pendency
</p>
<p>it was used as a pretext by the fanatics of the North
</p>
<p>for the wildest exhibition of ungovernable fury. It drew
</p>
<p>upon its author the most unbounded abuse and denunciation ;
</p>
<p>while it was pending in Congress a storm, such as has never
</p>
<p>been known in the political annals of the country was gather-
</p>
<p>ing, and it broke with all its force upon his head. Undismay-
</p>
<p>ed by threats, he followed the chart that he had laid down,

</p>
<p>raged the fiercest."

<p>The picture here presented, of the excitement which grew
</p>
<p>out of the measure, is not overdrawn. Its remembrance is still
</p>
<p>vividly fresh in our minds. We can hardly class it among the
</p>
<p>things of the past, since it seems, by some scarcely definable
</p>
<p>process, to have become part and substance of the tremendous
</p>
<p>outburst of elements which, in 1860-61, shook the foundations
</p>
<p>of the Republic to their very base. The bill reported by Mr.

<p>press words, the Missouri restriction. As finally adopted
</p>
<p>(May 2oth, 1854) the act contained this clause :
</p>
<p>" That tlie Constitution and all the laws of the United States which
</p>
<p>are not locally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within
</p>
<p>tlie said Territory of Nebraska, as elsewhere within the United States,
</p>
<p>except the eighth section of the act prejiai-atory to the admission of
</p>
<p>Missouri into the Union, approved March sixth, eighteen hundred and
</p>
<p>twenty, which being inconsistent with the principles of non-intervention
</p>
<p>by Congress with Slavery in the States and Territories, as recognized by
</p>
<p>the legislation of eighteen hundred and fifty, commonly called the Com-
</p>
<p>promise Measures, is hereby declared inoperative and void ; it being the
</p>
<p>true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate Slavery into any Ter-
</p>
<p>ritory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people
</p>
<p>thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in
</p>
<p>their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States ;
</p>
<p>Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to revive
</p>
<p>or put in force any law or regulation which may have existed prior to
</p>
<p>the act of sixth of March, eighteen hundred and twenty, either protects
</p>
<p>ing, establishing, prohibiting or abolishing Slavery." *
</p>
<p>This act was signed by President Pierce May 30th, and thus
</p>
<p>became law. The country in both sections (slave and free)
</p>
<p>was thoroughly alive to the crisis. The South, with the aid
</p>
<p>of the Northern Democracy, had opened to slavery soil guar-
</p>
<p>anteed, by solemn contract, to freedom forever. Nothing there-
</p>
<p>fore remained for the North, if it would save the soil to free-
</p>
<p>dom and a Free State representation in Congress, but to avail
</p>
<p>of the " Squatter Sovereignty" clause, and, by peopling the
</p>
<p>Territory with Northern men, to thwart the Southern intrigu-
</p>
<p>ants. From every section of New England, from New York,
</p>
<p>from Ohio and her sister States, the cry went up : " Ho I for
</p>
<p>* Singular as it may appear the Missouri "restriction" had been overridden,
</p>
<p>years before proving that, practically, the act was inoperative. June 7th, 1836,

<p>a bill was crowded through botli Houses of Congress, almost unnoticed, ceding to
</p>
<p>Missouri a triangular district of land lying west of the Missouri river, out of wliich

<p>eix counties were constituted. The district was, of course, free soil by virtue of
</p>
<p>the Compromise Act ; yet, it was deliberately absorbed by Missouri, the Indian
</p>
<p>titles extinguished at heavy cost by the General Government, and soon became
</p>
<p>one of the most populous slave sections of the whole State. It played a leading
</p>
<p>part in the Kansas war by supplying that horde whose brutal interference at the
</p>
<p>ballot-box, whose blockade of the Missouri river, and whose relentless persecution
</p>
<p>of Free State emigrants, won for them the appellation of " Border Ruffians." A
</p>
<p>more ignorant and thoroughly cruel class of " citizens" never cursed any com-
</p>
<p>munity with their malign presence.

<p>Kansas ! " and soon a strong tide of emigration set in for the
</p>
<p>new Territories, cliiefly by way of the Missouri river. This
</p>
<p>emigration was encouraged by the formation, in New England
</p>
<p>and Ohio particularly, of "Emigrant Aid Societies," which
</p>
<p>supplied means for all who chose to people the new country,
</p>
<p>secured the land, and assisted in developing the soil until its
</p>
<p>settlers should be self-sustaining. The town of Lawrence was
</p>
<p>founded, August 1st, by thirty persons, members of one of
</p>
<p>these societies, and thereafter became a kind of nucleus of set-
</p>
<p>tlement around which, in constantly extending circles, the
</p>
<p>Free State men gathered.
</p>
<p>But, the South was not idle. The very act of dividing the
</p>
<p>Territory into Nebraska and Kansas was designed to make the
</p>
<p>latter a Slave State, as, by the nature of its climate and soil,
</p>
<p>Nebraska must become a Free State. Says Gihon, in his
</p>
<p>" History of Kansas :'' " Many members of the pro-slavery par-
</p>
<p>ty, believing it to have been a matter understood and fixed by
</p>
<p>certain contracting powers and the heads of the General Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, that Kansas was to become a Slave State, in order to
</p>
<p>keep up an equilibrium of Northern and Southern sectional
</p>
<p>and political interests, conscientiously suj)posed that, instead
</p>
<p>of its being a criminal offense, it was not only justifiable, but a
</p>
<p>virtue, to persecute, even to death, all Northern people who
</p>
<p>should enter the Territory with a disposition to defeat or thwart
</p>
<p>that object. All such were regarded as intruders, whom it
</p>
<p>was proper to remove at all hazards and by whatever means,
</p>
<p>however cruel or oppressive, that could be employed. This
</p>
<p>sentiment was not confined to Kansas and the adjoining State
</p>
<p>of Missouri, but was entertained by persons high in authority
</p>
<p>elsewhere, and especially at the seat of the Federal Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. By many it was freely acknowledged and boldly ad-
</p>
<p>vocated."

<p>diately after the passage of the Act they crossed over the bor-

</p>
<p>souri guardians of the public weal convened at Westport,
</p>
<p>Missouri, early in July, organised into an association and pass-
</p>
<p>ed the following:
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That this association will, whenever called upon by any
</p>
<p>of the citizens of Kansas Territory, hold itself in readiness together to
</p>
<p>assist to remove any and all emigrants who go there under the auspices
</p>
<p>of the Northern emigrant aid societies.
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That we recommend to the citizens of other counties, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly those bordering on Kansas Territory, to adopt regulations simi-
</p>
<p>lar to those of this association, and to indicate their readiness to operate
</p>
<p>in the objects of this first resolution."
</p>
<p>Succeeding this meeting were others, at which originated
</p>
<p>secret societies of a seditious character, designed to interfere
</p>
<p>with the JSTorthern settlers, by violence and persecution. Says
</p>
<p>the Eeport of the Congressional Committee on the Kansas
</p>
<p>Outrages :
</p>
<p>' About the same time, and before any election was or could be held
</p>
<p>in tlie Territory, a secret political society was formed in the State of
</p>
<p>Missouri. It was known by diflereut names, such as 'Social Band.'
</p>
<p>'Friends' Society,' 'Blue Lodge,' 'The Sons of the South.' Its members
</p>
<p>were bound together by secret oaths, and they had passwords, signs
</p>
<p>and grips, by which they were known to each other. Penalties were
</p>
<p>imposed for violating the rules and secrets of the Order. Written min-
</p>
<p>utes were kept of the proceedings of the Lodges, and the different
</p>
<p>Lodges were connected together by an eflFective organization. It embrac-
</p>
<p>ed great numbers of the citizens of Missouri, and was extended into
</p>
<p>other Slave States and into the Territory. Its avowed i^arpose was not
</p>
<p>)nly to extend Slavery into Kansas, but also into other territory of the
</p>
<p>United States ; and to form a union of all the friends of that insti-
</p>
<p>tution. Its plan of operating was to organize and send men to vote
</p>
<p>at the elections in the Territory, to collect money to pay their ex-
</p>
<p>penses, and, if necessary, to protect them in voting. It also proposed
</p>
<p>to induce pro-slavery men to emigrate into the Territory, to aid and
</p>
<p>sustain them while there, and to elect none to ofiice but those friend-

<p>ly to their views. This dangerous society was controlled by men
</p>
<p>who avowed their purpose to extend Slavery into the Territory at
</p>
<p>all hazards, and was altogether the most effective instrument in or-
</p>
<p>ganizing the subsequent armed invasions and forays. In the Lodges
</p>
<p>in Missouri, the affairs of Kansas were discussed, the force necessary
</p>
<p>to control the election was divided into bands, and leaders selected ;
</p>
<p>means were collected, and signs and badges were agreed upon. While
</p>
<p>tlie great body of the actual settlers of the Territory were relying
</p>
<p>upon the rights secured to them by the organic latv, and had fornk-

</p>
<p>ed no organization or combination whatever, this conspiracy against
</p>
<p>their riglits was  gathering strength in Missouri, and would liave
</p>
<p>been sufficient at their first election to have overpowered them, if
</p>
<p>they had been united to a man,"
</p>
<p>These meetings and secret organizations were abetted by the
</p>
<p>press of "Western Missouri, whose editorials, in their own pecu-
</p>
<p>liar style of ' bowie knife rhetoric,' called upon Missourians to
</p>
<p>exterminate the "invaders." Under their influence many bad
</p>
<p>deeds were perpetrated which, otherwise, never wojild have
</p>
<p>been conceived. What could be expected of a people, notori-
</p>
<p>ously addicted to whiskey, fast horses and negro trading, when
</p>
<p>the press applauded their ruffianism as "devotion to the
</p>
<p>South " ?
</p>
<p>In spite of these proceedings ISTorthern men daily made their
</p>
<p>way into the Territory, chiefly by the river. During October,
</p>
<p>however, the Missourians offered such outrages to the emigrants
</p>
<p> taking from them, first their arms, then their goods  that
</p>
<p>river travel was quite suspended, and even supplies were de-
</p>
<p>nied a transit except through well known ' Southern' hands
</p>
<p>for ' Southern' towns. The emigrants then were compelled to
</p>
<p>take the overland journey through Iowa and Nebraska  a te-
</p>
<p>dious and expensive route, but one used freely during the
</p>
<p>spring and summer of 1855.
</p>
<p>In pursuance of the policy indicated, President Pierce ap-
</p>
<p>pointed to territorial offices men of undoubted " Democratic"
</p>
<p>sympathies. Andrew H. Eeeder, the first Governor, arrived
</p>
<p>at Fort Leavenworth October 6th, to find a state of affairs quite
</p>
<p>distracted enough to distract him. Two parties were in the
</p>
<p>field contesting for the supremacy  one composed of Free
</p>
<p>State men, another of pro-slavery propagandists. The first
</p>
<p>was quiet but determined ; the other violent and ready for any
</p>
<p>deed of blood against what they termed "Northern aggression."
</p>
<p>It was in vain that Governor Reeder plead the right of North-
</p>
<p>ern men, under the organic act, to settle the Territory. Ac-

<p>cording to the Southern sentiment Kansas was not designed
</p>
<p>for a Free State, therefore free-soilers had no rights there which
</p>
<p>Southern men were bound to respect. Reeder, though a Dem-

<p>ocrat of sterling faith, and devoted to administration interests,

</p>
<p>could not yield to tlie proscriptive and outrageous faction then
</p>
<p>led by one John W. Whitfield, an Indian Agent and employee
</p>
<p>of the General Government, whose sentiments were expressed
</p>
<p>in one of his popular harangues, as follows :
</p>
<p>" We can recognise but two parties in the Territory  the pro-slavery
</p>
<p>and the anti-slavery parties. If the citizens of Kansas want to live in
</p>
<p>this community at peace and feel at home, they must become pro-slavery
</p>
<p>men ; but if they want to live with gangs of thieves and robbers, they
</p>
<p>must go with the abolition part.y. There can be no third party  no
</p>
<p>more than two issues  slavery and no slavery, in Kansas Teri"itory."
</p>
<p>The first election for delegate to Congress, was appointed for
</p>
<p>Nov. 29th, 1854. The Territory was divided into seventeen
</p>
<p>election districts. At the appointed time -voting took place
</p>
<p>with a result disagreeably illustrative of the operation of
</p>
<p>' squatter sovereignty.' Of two thousand eight hundred and'
</p>
<p>seventy-one votes cast, one thousand seven hundred and twen-
</p>
<p>ty-nine were afterwards ascertained to have been illegal ! Thus,
</p>
<p>district No. II., with a census of thirty-five legal voters, cast
</p>
<p>two hundred and thirty- five votes for Whitfield, the pro-slaver j
</p>
<p>candidate ; district No. IV., having thirty legal voters, cast
</p>
<p>one hundred and forty votes for Whitfield ; district No. VII.,
</p>
<p>having twenty legal voters, cast five hundred and ninety-seven
</p>
<p>votes for Whitfield ! Of course Whitfield was " elected," and
</p>
<p>he went to Washington as the accredited delegate to represent
</p>
<p>the interests of his constituents. These illegal votes were poll-
</p>
<p>ed by Missourians, or the boxes were simply " stuffed," and
</p>
<p>false lists returned. This course was determined upon before
</p>
<p>hand. For two weeks prior to the election Western Missouri^
</p>
<p>(tlie old triangle and river counties) was canvassed by David-
</p>
<p>K. Atchison (ex-Democratic Vice President of the United
</p>
<p>States) and by " General" B. F. Stringfellow, who openly call-
</p>
<p>ed upon the people of Missouri to " enter every election dis-
</p>
<p>trict in Kansas, in defiance of Eeeder and his vile myrmidoms,
</p>
<p>and vote at the point of the bowie knife and revolver" ; " it was

<p>enough that the slave-holding interest wills it, from which there
</p>
<p>is no appeal" ; for, if the Free State men should triumph "then
</p>
<p>Missouri and the other Southern States will have shown them-
</p>
<p>selves recreant to their interests and will deserve their fate."

<p>These words reveal as once the baseness of the fraud perpe-

</p>
<p>trnted and the design of that fraud  to make Kansas a Slave
</p>
<p>State at all hazards.
</p>
<p>It was not until after this invasion by " Border Euffians"
</p>
<p>that blood began to be shed. Up to that period much violence
</p>
<p>had been shown and many outrages committed. The town of
</p>
<p>Lawrence had been approached by a considerable body of Mis-
</p>
<p>sourians, bent upon its destruction, but they had been intimi-
</p>
<p>dated by the preparations to receive them. Free State men
</p>
<p>generally stood upon the defensive, and, in but few instances,
</p>
<p>up to Dec. 1st, resented the indignities put upon them. After
</p>
<p>that date, however, the ' hatchet was dug up,' and a war was
</p>
<p>waged whose details it is sickening to record. Robbery, ])il-
</p>
<p>lage, arson, murder, became matters of frequent occurrence, in-
</p>
<p>creasing in number and atrocity as the months passed ; and the
</p>
<p>struggle only ended when the Free State element became so
</p>
<p>overwhelmingly in the ascendant, during 1857, as to render
</p>
<p>Border Ruffian presence and Executive baseness no longer
</p>
<p>dangerous. Dr. John H. Stringfellow, having a paper at his
</p>
<p>command, published at Atcheson, Kansas, thus expressed the
</p>
<p>determination of the Southern men :
</p>
<p>" We can tell the iiDpertinent scoundrels of the iV. T. Tribune that tliey
</p>
<p>may exhaust an ocean of ink, their Emigrant Aid Societies spend their
</p>
<p>millions and billions, their representatives in Congress spout their heret-

<p>ical theories till doomsday, and His Excellency Franklin Pierce ajjpoint

</p>
<p>and Tiang^ to tar and feather, and drowu every white-livered abolitionist
</p>
<p>who dares to pollute our soil."
</p>
<p>Here we have the true animus of that class against whom
</p>
<p>the Northern settlers had to contend : to lynch and hang, tar
</p>
<p>and feather J'' became their conception of law. These inhuman
</p>
<p>announcements, and the numerous evidences of a settled de-
</p>
<p>sign, on the part of the Missourians, to keep out and suppress

</p>
<p>rights, can we elicit from that shocking reign of terror which
</p>
<p>now stands like a burning spot upon our National honor. Gov-
</p>
<p>ernors rapidly appointed, and as rapidly removed  the refusal
</p>
<p>to guarantee the sanctity of the ballot box  the uses of the
</p>
<p>military (regulars) to suppress Free State meetings and to ar-
</p>

<p>employment of a band of Georgia desperados as a posse comi'
</p>
<p>tatus to enforce " dbedience"  the instructions issued to the
</p>
<p>several Governors and the forced misconstruction of them by
</p>
<p>the National Executive  all are incidental witnesses which no
</p>
<p>political sorcery can allay: they rise up, along with the ghosis
</p>
<p>of murdered settlers and their heart broken wives, to impeach
</p>
<p>the memories of two Presidents with proofs of high crimes
</p>
<p>against the State and against humanity.]
</p>
<p>A second step in the organization of the Territory was the
</p>
<p>election of a General Assembly. This, Governor Eeeder or-
</p>
<p>dered for March 20th, 1856. It was accompanied by incidenis
</p>
<p>well calculated to bring the elective franchise into disgi-ace.
</p>
<p>As preliminary to a protection of the people against illegal in-
</p>
<p>terference at the ballot box, the Governor ordered a ceubus to
</p>
<p>be taken (during January and February) of the inhabitants
</p>
<p>and qualified voters of the Territory. The result was as fol-
</p>
<p>lows:

<p>4:6Q THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>Of the election wliicli followed the Congressional Committee
</p>
<p>spoke as follows :
</p>
<p>" On the same day the census was comijleted, the Governor issued his
</p>
<p>proclamation for an election to be held on the 30th of March, a. d. 1855,
</p>
<p>for members of the Legislative Asseml:)ly of the Territory. It prescribed
</p>
<p>the boundaries of the districts, the places for polls, the names of judges,
</p>
<p>the iippoiutment of members and recited the qualifications of voters. If
</p>
<p>it had been observed, a just and fair election would have reflected the
</p>
<p>will of the people of the Territory. Before the election, false and in-
</p>
<p>flammatory rumors were busily circulated among the people of Western
</p>
<p>Missouri. The number and character of the emigration then passing
</p>
<p>into the Territory were grossly exaggerated and misre^jresented. Through
</p>
<p>the active exertions of many of its leading citizens, aided by the secret
</p>
<p>societies before referred to, the passions and prejudices of the people of
</p>
<p>that Slate were greatly excited. Several residents there have testified
</p>
<p>to the character of the reports circulated among and credited by the
</p>
<p>people. These efforts were successful. By an organized movement,
</p>
<p>which extended from Andrew county in the north to Jasper county in
</p>
<p>the south, and as far eastward as Boone and Cole counties, companies
</p>
<p>of men were ari'anged in regular parties and sent into every council dis-
</p>
<p>tiict in the Territory, and into every representative district but one
</p>
<p>The numbers were so distrilsuted as to control the election in each dis-
</p>
<p>trict. They went to vote, and with the avowed design to make Kansas
</p>
<p>a Slave State. They were generally armed and equipped, carried with
</p>
<p>them their own provisions and tents, and so marched into the Territory.
</p>
<p>The details of this invasion from the mass of the testimony taken by
</p>
<p>your committee are so voluminous that we can here state but the lead-
</p>
<p>ing facts elicited."
</p>
<p>These " leading facts" were considered enough to prove to
</p>
<p>the- most incredulous that, in most of the districts, the election
</p>
<p>was worse than a mockery  it was a crime. So apparent was
</p>
<p>this from the returns and the known presence of bodies of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri ans, that Governor Reeder felt called upon to order special
</p>
<p>elections in several of the districts where invasion, bos stuffing

<p>and forged lists were too undisguised to pass them with Execu-
</p>
<p>tive sanction. This second election was set for May 2 2d. Of
</p>
<p>course it aroused the pro-slavery men to violent opposition. A
</p>
<p>meetmg was held at Leavenworth, April 80th, of those repre-
</p>
<p>senting "Southern rights." It was, as stated by local papers,

<p>ViGILAl<rCE COMMITTEE OPEEATIONS. 469
</p>
<p>Lecompt being Mr. Pierce's appointee to the higli office of
</p>
<p>Chief Justice of the Territory, The meeting resolved :
</p>
<p>" That the institution of slavery is known and recognised in this Ter-
</p>
<p>ritory; that we rejDel the doctrine that it is a moral and political evil,
</p>
<p>and we turn back with scorn upon its slanderous authors the charge of
</p>
<p>inhumanity; and we warn all persons not to come to our peaceful fire-
</p>
<p>sides to slander us, and sow the seeds of discord between the master and
</p>
<p>the servant ; for, as much as we deprecate the necessity to which we
</p>
<p>may be driven, we cannot be responsible for the consequences."
</p>
<p>And to cany out the resolve a committee of thirty was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed whose special duty it was to spy out and report all
</p>
<p>such as should, "by the expression of abolition sentiments
</p>
<p>produce a disturbance to the quiet of the citizens, or danger to
</p>
<p>their domestic relations; and all such persons, so offending,
</p>
<p>shall be notified, and made to leave the Territory." Under
</p>
<p>the operations of this committee a tyranny was instated as re-
</p>
<p>lentless as ever prevailed on a rice plantation. Orders were
</p>
<p>, issued to large numbers of Free State men, who were instract-
</p>
<p>, ed to leave the Territoiy in a specified number of days or suf-
</p>
<p>fer the penalty of death. Large numbers of settlers were
</p>
<p>driven from their homes, barely escaping with their wives and
</p>
<p>children, leaving behind them, to be appropriated by the
</p>
<p>Southern vagabonds, their homes and property. One case may
</p>
<p>Qie cited as an instance, j Among those who signed a protest
</p>
<p>against the election held in Leavenworth (March 20th) was a
</p>
<p>lawyer iianied William Phillips. He was, of course, among
</p>
<p>the first of those "warned' by the self-ccnstituted committee.
</p>
<p>Whereupon "he was, on the 17th of May, seized by a band of
</p>
<p>]non chleily from Missouri, who carried him eight miles up the
</p>
<p>river to Weston, where they shaved one half of his head, tarred
</p>
<p>and feathered him, rode him on a rail, and sold him at a mock
</p>
<p>auction by a negro, all of which he bore with manly fortitude
</p>
<p>and bravery, and then returned to Leavenworth and persisted
</p>
<p>in remaining, notwithstanding his life was constantly threaten-

<p>ed and in danger. He was subsequently murdered in his own
</p>
<p>nouse, by a company of ' law and order' men, or ' territorial
</p>
<p>militia,' under command of Captain Frederick S. Emory, sim-
</p>
<p>ply for refusing to leave the town." Eight days after this out-
</p>
<p>rage on his person, a second meeting was held in Leavenworth,

</p>
<p>over wliieli tlie memljer elect to the Assembly Council presid-
</p>
<p>ed. Judge Lecompte again "eloquently addressed" tlie assem-
</p>
<p>bly, and the following resolutions, presented by another inern-
</p>
<p>ber elect to the Assembly, were passed unanimously :
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That we heartily endorse the action of the committee of
</p>
<p>citizens that shaved, tarred and feathered, rode on a rail, and had sold
</p>
<p>by a negro, William Phillips, the moral perjurer.
</p>
<p>^^ Fenolved, That we return our thanks to the committee for faithfully
</p>
<p>performing the trust enjoined uj^on them by the pro-slavery party.
</p>
<p>'' Beaolved, That the committee be now discharged.
</p>
<p>'' Besolced, That we severely condemn those pro-slavery men who, from
</p>
<p>mercenary motives, are calling upon the pro-slavery party to submit
</p>
<p>without further action.
</p>
<p>" Itesolved, That in order to secure peace and harmony to the commu-
</p>
<p>nity, we now solemnly declare that the pro-slavery party will stand
</p>
<p>firmly by and carry out the resolutions reported by the committee ap-
</p>
<p>pointed for that purpose on the memorable 30th."
</p>
<p>This local action was responded to very generally by Mis-
</p>
<p>sourians, and the right of invasion sustained. Numerous meet-
</p>
<p>ings were held by them at which addresses were made by
</p>
<p>prominent citizens. Dr. Gihon, in his " History of Kansas,"
</p>
<p>quotes the following resolves, passed by a large public meeting
</p>
<p>held in Clay county, Mo., as giving a just impression of the
</p>
<p>ideas and feeling which prevailed :
</p>
<p>" Those who, in our State, would give aid to the abolitionists by in-
</p>
<p>ducing or assisting them to settle in Kansas, or would throw obstacles
</p>
<p>in the way of our friends, by fiilse and slanderous misrepresentations of
</p>
<p>the acts of those who took part in and contriluited to the glorious result
</p>
<p>of the late election in that Territory, should be driven from amongst us
</p>
<p>as traitors to their country.
</p>
<p>" That we regard the efforts of the Northern division of the Metho<list
</p>
<p>Episcopal Church to establish itself in our State as a violation of her
</p>
<p>plighted faith, and, pledged as its ministers must be to the anti-slavery
</p>
<p>principles of that church, we are forced to regard them as enemies to

</p>
<p>our institutions. We therefore fully concur with our friends in Platte
</p>
<p>county in resolving to permit no person belonging to the Northern Meth-
</p>
<p>odist Church to preach in our county.
</p>
<p>"That all persons who are subscribers to papers in the least tinctui-ed
</p>
<p>with free-soilism or abolitionism, are requested to discontinue them im-
</p>
<p>mediately."
</p>
<p>Shocking instances of violence occurred against their own citi-
</p>
<p>zens. All who ventured to signify a disapproval of these outrages
</p>
<p>THE INVASION. 471
</p>
<p>upon Kansas settlers and the ballot box were condemned as
</p>
<p>enemies to the South and were visited with persecution in va-
</p>
<p>rious ways. / Thus public sentiment was stifled, for few even of
</p>
<p>the wealthy and influential class cared to court the vengeance
</p>
<p>of the mob which presumed to hold the destiny of Kansas in
</p>
<p>its keeping. A newspaper office was mobbed in Parkeville,
</p>
<p>Platte county, because its venerable editor, Mr. Parke, had, in
</p>
<p>perfectly respectful terms, condemned the March invasion.
</p>
<p>The press, types, &c., were thrown into the river and the mob
</p>
<p>would have killed the assistant editor but for the interference
</p>
<p>of citizens. Mr. Parke being absent escaped lynching. His
</p>
<p>assistant was permitted to leave the town under penalty of
</p>
<p>death should he dare to return. Why did not the Governor
</p>
<p>of Missouri punish such crimes? Because they were commit-
</p>
<p>ted in behalf of the Southern cause! Why did not the law
</p>
<p>abiding citizens arm themselves against such villainy ? Because
</p>
<p>they would have been assassinated, their houses burned, their
</p>
<p>stock killed, by the incomparable scoundrels who shamed the
</p>
<p>Camanches in their revelry of wrong doing. Claiborne F. Jack-
</p>
<p>son, afterwards Governor of Missouri, headed one of the com-
</p>
<p>panies which invaded District No. I., March 80th. Said the
</p>
<p>Congressional Committee of this event : " The evening before
</p>
<p>and the morning of the day of election, about one thousand
</p>
<p>men from the above counties arrived at Lawrence, and encamp-
</p>
<p>ed in a ravine a. short distance from town, near the place of
</p>
<p>voting. They came in wagons  of which there were over one
</p>
<p>hundred  and on horseback, under command of Colonel Samu-
</p>
<p>el Young, of Boone county, Missouri, and Claiborne F. Jack-
</p>
<p>son, of Missouri. They were armed with guns, rifles, pistols
</p>
<p>and bowie knives, and had tents, music and flags with them.
</p>
<p>They brought with them two pieces of artillery, loaded wiih
</p>
<p>musket balls." It is not a matter of surprise that this Jackson
</p>
<p>should, as Governor of his State, afterwards have conspired to
</p>
<p>carry Missouri into the Southern Confederacy. He truly

<p>was a fit instrument for any political baseness. The surprise
</p>
<p>is that a man of his character should have been chosen Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor. Let us hope the day of public prostitution to such
</p>
<p>representatives of hateful elements is past, for Missouri-
</p>
<p>472 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>Against tliis second election numerous protests were entered ;
</p>
<p>and so palpably illegal were the returns that, in such instances
</p>
<p>as properly signed protests were filed, the Governor refused to
</p>
<p>issue certificates to members whose election was thus contested.
</p>
<p>This action resulted, as might have been expected, in excessive
</p>
<p>swearing on the part of the pro-slavery faction, who denounced
</p>
<p>Eeeder as "an Abolitionist," and who had the base ingratitude
</p>
<p>to charge upon the President a design to make Kansas a Free
</p>
<p>State  the crudest of returns for what tha President had done
</p>
<p>for Southern interests. Notwithstanding these threats, Eeeder
</p>
<p>ordered a third election to be held in six of the contested dis-
</p>
<p>tricts. One of the Missouri papers thereupon exclaimed :
</p>
<p>" We learn, just as we go to press, that Reeder has refused to give cer-
</p>
<p>tificates to four of the Councilmen and thirteen members of the House,
</p>
<p>He has ordered an election to fill their places on the 22d of May. This
</p>
<p>infernal scoundrel will have to be hemped yet."
</p>
<p>It was determined by the Southern party to let the special
</p>
<p>election, ordered for May 22d, go by default, as the committee
</p>
<p>on elections in their Assenibly would deny seats to all Free
</p>
<p>State men elected under it. Only in Leavenworth did the
</p>
<p>pro-slavery men go to the polls, but there they went only for
</p>
<p>mischief and the destruction of the ballot box. True to their
</p>
<p>decision every man then elected was denied a seat in the Assembly,
</p>
<p>which assembled at Pawnee, July 2d, 1855. The committee
</p>
<p>on elections, under various pretexts, deprived of seats every
</p>
<p>free-soiler except one, and this one, owing to the personal peril
</p>
<p>by which he was constantly surrounded, was compelled quickly
</p>
<p>to resign ! This gave the legislation of the territorial organic
</p>
<p>laws into the hands of the pro-slave propagandists, and the As-
</p>
<p>sembly at once proceeded to the work of " making their own
</p>
<p>laws and forming their own institutions." It was in session
</p>
<p>for a term of fifty days, and legislated in that short space of
</p>
<p>time enough to fill three portly volumes. The laws adopted
</p>
<p>occupied in bulk over one thousand octavo pages. This would

<p>seem to indicate extreme industry as well as executive ability
</p>
<p>on the part of the Assemblymen ; but, when the fact trans-
</p>
<p>pired that those " laws" were, simply, an adaptation of the
</p>
<p>Missouri code, with slight alterations and a few most scandal-
</p>
<p>ous additions, we are undeceived as to the character and ability
</p>
<p>THE EANSAS CODE. 473
</p>
<p>of that legislative bodj. Eefei:riiig to these extraordinary pi-o-
</p>
<p>ceedings in organizing the Territorj'-, the Congressional Com-
</p>
<p>mittee state :
</p>
<p>" The material differences in the Missouri and Kansas statutes are
</p>
<p>upon the following subjects : The qualifications of voters and of mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the Legislative Assembly ; the official oath of all officers, attor-
</p>
<p>neys and voters ; the mode of selecting officers and their qualifications ;
</p>
<p>tlie slave code, and the qualifications of jurors.
</p>
<p>" Upon these subjects, the provisions of the Missouri code are such as
</p>
<p>ai'e usual in many of the States. But by the 'Kansas Statutes' every of-
</p>
<p>fice in the Territory^ executite and judicial^ was to he ajjpointed ly tlie
</p>
<p>Legislature, or hy some officer appointed hy it. These appointments were
</p>
<p>not merely to meet a temporary exigency, but were' to hold over two
</p>
<p>regular elections, and until after the general election in October, 1857,
</p>
<p>at which the members of the new council were to be elected. The new
</p>
<p>Legislature is required to meet on the first Monday in January, 1858,
</p>
<p>Thus, by the terms of these " laws," the people have no control what-
</p>
<p>ever over either the Legislature, the executive or the judicial depart-
</p>
<p>ments of tlie Territorial Government until a time before which, by the
</p>
<p>natural progress of population, the Territorial Government will be super-
</p>
<p>seded by a State Government.
</p>
<p>" No session of the Legislature is to be held during 1856, but the,
</p>
<p>members of the House are to be elected in October of that year. A can-
</p>
<p>didate, to be eligible at this election, must swear to support the fugitive
</p>
<p>slave law; and each voter, if challenged, must take the same oath. The
</p>
<p>same oath is required of every officer elected or appointed in the Terri-
</p>
<p>tory, and of every attorney admitted to practice in the courts.
</p>
<p>" A portion of the militia is required to muster on the day of election,
</p>
<p>'Every free white male citizen of the United States, and every free male
</p>
<p>Indian who is made a citizen by treaty or otherwise, and over the age
</p>
<p>of twenty-one years, and who shall be an inhabitant of the Territory
</p>
<p>and of the county and district in which he offers to vote, and shall have
</p>
<p>paid a Territorial tax, shall be a qualified elector for all elective offices.'
</p>
<p>Two classes of persons were thus excluded, who by the organic act were

<p>allowed to vote, viz.: those who would not swear to the oath required,
</p>
<p>and those of foreign birth who had declared on oath their intention to
</p>
<p>become citizens. Any man of jjroper age who Avas in the Territory on
</p>
<p>the day of election, and who had paid one dollar as a tax to the Sheriff,
</p>
<p>who was required to be at the polls to receive it, could vote as an ' in-
</p>
<p>habitant,' although he had breakfasted in Missouri, and intended to re-
</p>
<p>turn there for supper. Tliere can be no doubt that this unusual and
</p>
<p>xmconstitutional provision was inserted to prevent a full a,nd fair ex-

<p>admit the right of holding slaves in the Territory, shall be a juror in any
</p>
<p>cause' affecting the right to hold slaves, or relating to slave property."
</p>
<p>It is not in the order of human events that men, in whose
</p>
<p>breasts remain one spark of self respect, should submit, as sub-
</p>
<p>jects, to such shocking perversions of law.' "We should have
</p>
<p>been surprised had the Free State settlers tamely abandoned,
</p>
<p>in that crisis, all their hopes and their rights under the Kansas-
</p>
<p>Nebraska Act. They moved quietly and resolutely forward,
</p>
<p>in the only path open for escape from lawlessness and usurpa-
</p>
<p>tion. After the invasion of March 30th, they circulated for
</p>
<p>signatures a memorial to Congress, citing, with graphic force
</p>
<p>* John M. Clayton, U. S. Senator from the State of Delaware, afterwards refer-
</p>
<p>ring to these laws thus characterised them : " Now, Sir, let me allude to that sub-
</p>
<p>cect which is the great cause of all this discord between the two Houses. The un-
</p>
<p>just, iniquitous, oppressive and infamous laws enacted by the Kansas Legislature,
</p>
<p>as it is called, ought to be repealed before we adjourn. * * * What are these
</p>
<p>laws ? One of them sends a man to bard labor for not less than two years for
</p>
<p>daring to discuss the question whether Slavery exists or does not exist in Kansas :
</p>
<p>not less than two years  it may be fifty ; and if a man could live to be as old as
</p>
<p>Mathuselah, it might be over nine hundred years. That act prohibits all freedom
</p>
<p>of discussion in Kansas, on the great subject directly referred to the exclusive de-
</p>
<p>cision of the people in that Territory ; strikes down the liberty of the press, too ;
</p>
<p>and is an act egregiously tyrannical as ever was attempted by any of the Stuarts,
</p>
<p>Tudors or Plantagenets of England, and this Senate persists in declaring that w<j
</p>
<p>are not to repeal that !
</p>
<p>" Sir, let us tender to the House of Representatives the repeal of that and of all
</p>
<p>other objectionable and infamous laws that were passed by that Legislature. I

</p>
<p>ities put upon them, praying for relief And when the char-
</p>
<p>acter of the Assembly legislation became apparent the North-
</p>
<p>ern settlers resolved to initiate a movement for the formation
</p>
<p>of a State Government, and to apply for admission at the com-
</p>
<p>ing session of Congress, Meetings were held in various locali-
</p>
<p>ties, when the subject was canvassed in a thorough manner.
</p>
<p>No violence was betrayed in their proceeding  only a spirit
</p>
<p>of determination to preserve their rights under the Constitution
</p>
<p>against the tyranny of Missourian and outside interference. A
</p>
<p>mass convention of Free State citizens and actual settlers was
</p>
<p>held at Lawrence, August 15th, 1855. A large representation
</p>
<p>of the best inhabitants of the Territory was present. The fol-
</p>
<p>lowing were adopted :
</p>
<p>" Whereas, The people of Kansas have been, since its settlement, and
</p>
<p>now are, -without any law-making power, therefore be it
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That we, the' people of Kansas Territory, in masi meeting
</p>
<p>assembled, irrespective of party distinctions, influenced by common ne-
</p>
<p>cessity, and greatly desirous of promoting the common good, do hereby
</p>
<p>call upon and request all lona fide citizens of Kansas Territory, of what-
</p>
<p>ever political views and i^redilectious, to consult together in their re-
</p>
<p>spective Election Districts and in mass conventions or otherwise, elect
</p>
<p>three delegates for each representative to which said Election District
</p>
<p>is entitled in the House of Representatives of the Legislative Assembly,
</p>
<p>by proclamation of Governor Reeder, of date 19th of March, 1855; said
</p>
<p>delegates to assemble in convention, at the town of Topeka, on the 19th
</p>
<p>day of September, 1855, then and there to consider and determine upon
</p>
<p>all subjects of public interest, and particularly upon that having refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the speedy formation of a State Constitution, with an intention
</p>
<p>of an immediate application to be admitted as a State into the Union
</p>
<p>of the United States of America."
</p>
<p>This action was endorsed by other assemblies of settlers and
</p>
<p>lona fide inhabitants, and delegates formally elected as desig-
</p>
<p>nated. The convention met at Topeka, Sept. 19th, 1855, and

<p>proceeded in regular form, to the work of preliminary or-
</p>
<p>ganization for a State Government. An Executive Committee,
</p>
<p>composed of seven leading and able citizens, was named and
</p>
<p>duly authorized, under prescribed regulations, to take steps
</p>
<p>for an election to be held on the second Tuesday of October
</p>
<p>following " for members of a Convention to form a Constitu-

</p>
<p>tion, adopt a Bill of Rights for the people of Kansas, and take
</p>
<p>all needful measures for organizing a State Government prepa-
</p>
<p>ratory to the admission of Kansas into the Union as a State."
</p>
<p>This Committee acted promptly, by issuing a proclamation ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to the legal voters of Kansas, requesting them to meet
</p>
<p>at their several precincts, at the time and places named in the
</p>
<p>proclamation, then and there to cast their ballots for members
</p>
<p>of a Constitutional Convention, to meet at Topeka on the 4th
</p>
<p>Tuesday of October following. The proclamation also desig-
</p>
<p>nated the places of elections, appointed judges, recited the
</p>
<p>qualifications of voters and the apportionment of members of
</p>
<p>the Convention. This call and action were responded to, by
</p>
<p>the actual settlers^ with great unanimity. Proof upon this point
</p>
<p>appears to be incontestible. The inhabitants felt that it was
</p>
<p>the lawful way to proceed, and all entered into the election
</p>
<p>with great good spirit. These elections passed off with har-
</p>
<p>mony, very full votes being polled in every district except two,
</p>
<p>where pro-slavery feeling reigned triumphant under the rule
</p>
<p>of a floating mob having no visible means of support nor any
</p>
<p>claims to citizenship except their temporary presence on Kan-
</p>
<p>sas soil. According to regulations prescribed, the Executive"
</p>
<p>Committee proclaimed the results of that election, and issued
</p>
<p>an order requiring' the members elect to convene at Topeka,
</p>
<p>October 23d, 1855, as a "Constitutional Convention," duly
</p>
<p>elected and legally constituted. The Convention accordingly
</p>
<p>met, and addressed itself to the work of forming a State Con-
</p>
<p>stitution. This being accomplished a respectful memorial was
</p>
<p>addressed to Congress praying for the admission of Kansas to
</p>
<p>the Union, under the Constitution adopted. As preliminary
</p>
<p>to this application to Congress, the Constitution was submitted
</p>
<p>to a vote of the people Dec. 15th, 1855, with a result as fol-
</p>
<p>lows : For Constitution 1731 against 46 ; for General Banki ng
</p>
<p>Law 1120  against 564 ; for Exclusion of Negroes and Mulat-
</p>
<p>toes from rights of citizenship 1287  against exclusion 453 ;

<p>total number of votes cast 1778. In " Leavenworth the poll
</p>
<p>book was destroyed. After this acceptance an election was
</p>
<p>ordered by the Executive Committee for State Officers (to be
</p>
<p>held Jan. 15th, 1856) and for members of a General Assembly.
</p>
<p>PROSCRIPTION OF FREE STATE MEN. 477
</p>
<p>This was duly lield and the result announced, pro forma, by
</p>
<p>the Committee. The members elect met at Topeka, March 1st,
</p>
<p>1856, and organized the first General Assembly. Dr. Charles
</p>
<p>Eobinson, Governor elect, took the oath of office. An election
</p>
<p>of United Senators was held, by which ex-Governor Eeeder
</p>
<p>and James H. Lane were chosen to take their seats when the
</p>
<p>State should be admitted to the Union. After transacting
</p>
<p>much im.portant business the Assembly adjourned, to meet
</p>
<p>again on the 4th of July following.
</p>
<p>The reader is now in possession of the leading facts concern-
</p>
<p>ing the organization of the two Governments, Territorial and
</p>
<p>State. One, done under the apparent sanction of the Organic
</p>
<p>Act was, in reality, in contravention of the entire spirit of our
</p>
<p>democratic institutions. The other, without appealing to the
</p>
<p>Organic Act for authority, proceeded, in the usual form, to or-
</p>
<p>ganize a government and to apply for admission to the Union
</p>
<p>directly as a State. That the latter represented a majority of
</p>
<p>the actual settlers of Kansas  the men who have since consti-
</p>
<p>tuted' the State's best population, has not been successfully de-
</p>
<p>nied. That th former was the offsprmg of fraud and outrage
</p>
<p>upon the elective franchise is equally unquestionable.
</p>
<p>The Pawnee Assembly so legislated as to strip the Governor
</p>
<p>of power to do "the cause" harm. They made, as we have
</p>
<p>seen, territorial offices legislative appointments so far as it was
</p>
<p>possible to do so under the Organic Act. This was aimed at
</p>
<p>Eeeder, who was regarded by the Missourians as inimical to
</p>
<p>their proceedings. It was a useless step, however. Eeeder
</p>
<p>was, upon a baseless pretext of land speculation, removed,
</p>
<p>July 31st, 1855. From that moment, until after October, '57,
</p>
<p>a period of over two years, as Dr. Gihon truthfully states,
</p>
<p>" there was hut one man^ and he the post-master at Lawrence, who
</p>
<p>held an office either under the Federal Government or hy appoint-
</p>
<p>ment of the Legislature, or through their agents, who was not in
</p>
<p>favor of introducing Slavery into the Territory and through any

</p>
<p>be borne in mind, as it is the key that unlocks the Pandora

<p>box of mischief which followed.

</p>
<p>calamities threatening. Its proceedings, looking, as tliej diil,
</p>
<p>to a total evasion of the territorial laws, were met by the pro-
</p>
<p>slavery partisans with threats of wholesale arrests for treason.
</p>
<p>Violence was to be expected ; yet the movement inaugurated
</p>
<p>at Lawrence gradually assumed definite shape. On the 9th
</p>
<p>of October, 1855, an election for -delegates to Congress  order-
</p>
<p>ed by the Executive Committee alreadj- referred to  resulted
</p>
<p>in the election of ex-Governor Eeeder, by the vote of 2827.1 In
</p>
<p>this election the Southern partisans did not participate. Their
</p>
<p>election for the same office transpired, by order of the Shawnee
</p>
<p>Mission Assembly,' October 1st, when Whitfield was returned
</p>
<p>by over three thousand votes  nearly or quite one thousand
</p>
<p>of them absolutely illegal. These two delegates went on to
</p>
<p>Washington, in December, but both, though paid mileage fees,
</p>
<p>were rejected by Congress. The Free State Constitution ac-
</p>
<p>cej)ted Dec. 15th, 1855, by vote of the people thereon  result-
</p>
<p>ed in the gathering at Topeka March 1st of the ofl&cers elect
</p>
<p>of the new government and of the newly elect State Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, at which the proceedings already recorded were had.
</p>
<p>Governor Eeeder was removed July 80th, and Wilson Shan-
</p>
<p>non appointed in his stead. Shannon was then a resident of
</p>
<p>the Territory, and a partisan of the pro-slave faction. He was
</p>
<p>a man of bad precedents, dissolute and reckless, i Why such
</p>
<p>a person should have been named to the responsible trust only
</p>
<p>those in power at Washington manipulating Kansas affairs, can
</p>
<p>tell. His reign, though brief, was characterised by a perfect
</p>
<p>confraternity with all the worst elements in the Territory. He
</p>
<p>addressed himself to the task of suppressing the Free State
</p>
<p>movement, and soon found an opportunity of calling out " the
</p>
<p>militia," by which was meant taking into his employ about
</p>
<p>eight hundred as wretched creatures as ever shouldered a mus-
</p>
<p>ket. The direct pretext for this act was the rescue, by his
</p>
<p>friends, from the hands of " Sheriff" Samuel J. Jones, of an old
</p>
<p>man named Branson, a Free State settler. This man, Jones,

</p>
<p>Mission chosen as the temporary seat of tlie territorial Government. Eeeder ve-
</p>
<p>toed' this act of removal, but it was repassed over his veto.
</p>
<p>THE "militia" called OUT. 479
</p>
<p>prison, when "he was quietly taken from Jones' custody. The
</p>
<p>facts of the case rendered the arrest one of outrageous impu-
</p>
<p>dence. Coleman, a pro-slave ruffian, deliberately and in cold
</p>
<p>blood shot down a young man named Dow. Branson took the
</p>
<p>body into his house, from whence it was buried. Coleman,
</p>
<p>after the horrid deed, fled and placed himself under the protec-
</p>
<p>tion of Sheriff Jones. The murderer liad two accomplices,
</p>
<p>who soon joined him. One of them swore out a peace warrant
</p>
<p>against Branson, as having threatened his life, and upon this
</p>
<p>warrant Jones, in company with a band of seven, including the
</p>
<p>two accomplices to the murder, proceeded to arrest Branson !
</p>
<p>The Free State men at once ralHed and, without violence, res-
</p>
<p>cued their friend. Whereupon Jones called upon Governor
</p>
<p>Shannon (Nov. 27th) for three thousand men to " carry out the
</p>
<p>laws"! Shannon at once ordered out "Major- General" Wm.
</p>
<p>P. Eichardson, a citizen of Missouri, but also a member of tho
</p>
<p>Kansas Council, and, by virtue of legislative appointment, Ma-
</p>
<p>jor-General of the territorial militia. As there were no "mili-
</p>
<p>tia" in the Territory the programme was to introduce armed
</p>
<p>partisans from Missouri. ; The most outrageous falsehoods were
</p>
<p>disseminated in regard to the rescue affair and the belligerent
</p>
<p>attitude of the Free State men. Shannon published numerous
</p>
<p>orders calculated to fan the excitement, and, on the 29th of
</p>
<p>Nov. issued his Proclamation calling upon all " good citizens"
</p>
<p>to come forward to assist him in reclaiming the prisoner. The
</p>
<p>friends of " law and order"  as the Southern partisans called
</p>
<p>themselves  spread the alarm. Missouri was expected to fur-
</p>
<p>nish men for the crisis. Numerous meetings were held along
</p>
<p>the border and down the Missouri .river to raise " troops for the
</p>
<p>war." The following circular was scattered, by special express-
</p>
<p>es, widely over the surrounding counties :
</p>
<p>" Independekce, Mo., Dec. 2d.
</p>
<p>" An express, in at ten o'clock last night, says all the volunteers, am-
</p>

<p>gress from Missouri but an active promoter of the several "in-
</p>
<p>vasions." A second circular was issued as follows, from tbe
</p>
<p>same headquarters of patriotism, viz.:
</p>
<p>"Independence, Dec. 3, 8 p. m.
</p>
<p>"Jones will not make a move until there is sufficient force in the field
</p>
<p>to ensure success. We have not more than three hundred men in the
</p>
<p>Territory. You will, therefore, urge all who are interested in the mat-
</p>
<p>ter to start immediately for the seat of war. There is no doubt in re-
</p>
<p>gard to having a fight, and we all know that a great many have com-
</p>
<p>plained because they were disappointed heretofore in regard to a fight.
</p>
<p>Say to them, now is tho time to show game, and, if we are defeated this
</p>
<p>time, the Territory is lost to the South."
</p>
<p>These appeals threw into Kansas about fifteen hundred cut- [
</p>
<p>throats ready for the work of " wiping out the Abolitionists/^
</p>
<p>The grand provocation had been offered ; and, as the circular
</p>
<p>last quoted said : "if defeated this time the Territory is lost to
</p>
<p>the South," it was a question of " Southern rights" to be de- .
</p>
<p>cided  a State to be lost or won. Shannon, afterwards seeking
</p>
<p>to exculpate himself from responsibility in this disgusting epi-
</p>
<p>sode of his reign, said : " These men came to the Wakarusa
</p>
<p>camp to fight ; they did not ask peace ; it was war  war to the
</p>
<p>knife. They ivoidd come] it was impossible to prevent them.
</p>
<p>What, then, was my policy ? Certainly this ; to mitigate an
</p>
<p>evil which it was impossible to suppress, by bringing under
</p>
<p>military control these irregular and excited forces. This was
</p>
<p>only to be accomplished by permitting the continuance of the
</p>
<p>course which had already been adopted, without my knowledge,
</p>
<p>by Generals Eichardson and Strickler ; that is, to have the vol
</p>
<p>unteers incorporated, as they came in, into the already organ-
</p>
<p>ized command. A portion of these men were mostly from
</p>
<p>Jackson county, Mo., reported themselves to Sheriff Jones, by
</p>
<p>giving in a list of their names, as willing to serve in his posse ;
</p>
<p>and he, after taking legal advice upon the question, determined
</p>
<p>to receive them. They were accordingly enrolled." And thus

<p>these assassins were adopted for the Governor's service,
</p>
<p>Kansas, for the moment, was at mercy of a mob over whose
</p>
<p>actions the Governor himself presumed to exercise no direct
</p>
<p>authority. "Sheriff" Jones alone was their accepted leader,

<p>nnder whose auspices the "Wakarusa War" was to be waged.

</p>
<p>Against this fierce horde the Free State men resolved to
</p>
<p>stand. "Governor" Eobinson and "Senator" Lane rapidly
</p>
<p>gathered at Lawrence a body composed of nearly one thousand
</p>
<p>men, armed with Sharpe's rifles. Eude fortifications were
</p>
<p>thrown up on Oread Hill and everything arranged for a de-
</p>
<p>fense of the town against the destruction impending, j Shannon
</p>
<p>saw this with dismay. What would the country  the world 
</p>
<p>say to his complicity in thus exciting a resort to arms ? He
</p>
<p>resolved to call in United States troops (regulars) to preserve
</p>
<p>the peace, and dispatched urgent appeals to Colonel (afterwards
</p>
<p>Major-General) Sumner, commanding at Fort Leavenworth, for
</p>
<p>aid.. This step the Southern men of course disapproved, and
</p>
<p>eftorts were made to intercept Shannon's dispatches to Sumner.
</p>
<p>The U. S. officer resolved, however, not to interfere without
</p>
<p>orders from the War Department at Washington. Still desir-
</p>
<p>ous of preventing a collision, and acting under advice of Sum-
</p>
<p>ner, Shannon issued orders to General Eichardson and " Sherifl""
</p>
<p>Jones to proceed no further until he should receive instructions
</p>
<p>from Washington. The "Sheriff" protested, in a note dated
</p>
<p>Camp Wakarusa, Dec. 4th, against any delay ; he insisted upon
</p>
<p>orders to go forward and make his "arrests," for which he had
</p>
<p>prepared a pocket full of warrants. But he was denied such
</p>
<p>oixlers ; and matters remained in statu quo, while various ne-
</p>
<p>gotiations were pending between Shannon and the Free State
</p>
<p>leaders, for a peaceful adjustment of differences. This was
</p>
<p>finally effected, and a document, " done in Lawrence, K. T.,
</p>
<p>Dec. 8th, 1855," signed by Wilson Shannon, Charles Eobinson
</p>
<p>and J. H. Lane, was published, setting forth the terms of treaty
</p>
<p>adopted. It was a most extraordinarj'- instrument of agree-
</p>
<p>ment, if, as Shannon and the pro-slave partisans averred, the
</p>
<p>Free State men were in rebellion. The Governor, on the 9 th,
</p>
<p>issued orders to Jones and Eichardson to disband their forces.*
</p>
<p>To the former he said : " Having made satisfactory arrange-

<p>Considering the late call to arms, and the Governor's procla-
</p>
<p>mation of Nov. 29th, denouncing the " numerous associations
</p>
<p>of lawless men, armed with deadly weapons and supplied with
</p>
<p>all the implements of war, combined and confederated together
</p>
<p>for the avowed purpose of opposing by force and violence, the
</p>
<p>execution of the laws of this Territory," this latter authoriza-
</p>
<p>tion and the disbanding of the Southern posse was a most re-
</p>
<p>markable evidence of the Governor's weakness or of the Free
</p>
<p>State strength. The posse disbanded in rage and disgust,
</p>
<p>making open threats that they soon would see town in ashes,
</p>
<p>in spite of Shannon.

<p>The application to Washington for permission to use the

<p>in February, 1856, authority to employ the Federal military to

<p>annual message Dec. 31st, 1855, and in his special message of
</p>
<p>Jan. 24th, argued the case of the territorial orgaQization, giving
</p>
<p>to the Southern men the most unqualified sympathy in their
</p>
<p>struggle with "fanaticism." His last message, indeed, read as
</p>
<p>if it had emanated from Messrs. Atcheson and Stringfellow  so

</p>
<p>strongly did it condemn the movement and programme of the
</p>
<p>Free State settlers. He followed this up with a proclamation
</p>
<p>denouncing the acts of the Topeka Convention and setting
</p>
<p>forth the territorial or Shawnee Mission Assembly as the only
</p>
<p>legal legislative power of the Territory. Orders were sent for-
</p>
<p>ward to the Western Military department for its commander to
</p>
<p>sustain Shannon in his efforts to enforce the laws of the Shaw-
</p>
<p>nee Assembly and to suppress the Topeka convocation. This
</p>
<p>action was sustained, in the Senate, by the majority report
</p>
<p>made by Mr. Douglas, March 12th, 1856, from the Committee
</p>
<p>on Territories, to which had been referred the special message
</p>
<p>on Kansas affairs. In this report the President's view of mat-
</p>
<p>ters was, substantially, endorsed.' It went into a somewhat
</p>
<p>minute history of Congressional legislation and the subsequent
</p>
<p>proceedings in Kansas up to the date of the message. It de-
</p>
<p>fended the course pursued by the Southern men as being efforts
</p>
<p>to counteract incendiary proceedings of Northern States and
</p>
<p>"Emigrant Aid Societies." The minority report of this same
</p>
<p>committee (composed of Judge Collamer of Vermont) gave a
</p>
<p>most thorough expose of the whole system by which the Kan-
</p>
<p>sas struggle was thrust upon the country. It forms one of the
</p>
<p>leaves of current history, embodying, as it does, a presentment
</p>
<p>of the case which ultimately triumphed in defiance of the tre-
</p>
<p>mendous power and patronage of two Presidents secretly
</p>
<p>committed to delivering Kansas over to the South.
</p>
<p>In the House a fierce struggle was waged over Kansas affaii's.
</p>
<p>While the Senate was applauding the Shawnee Mission As-
</p>
<p>sembly, and seeking to enforce its monstrous legislation at the
</p>
<p>point of Federal bayonets, the House was struggling to secure
</p>
<p>justice for the oppressed Free State settlers. Not, however,
</p>
<p>until March 19th, 1856, was a final vote had on the proposition
</p>
<p>of the Committee on Elections to send for persons and papers,.
</p>
<p>It was then so modified as to appoint a special committee of
</p>
<p>three to proceed to Kansas, with full powers to take testimony-

</p>
<p>and to compel attendance of witnesses. On this commission
</p>
<p>were placed Wm. A. Howard, of Michigan, John Sherman, of
</p>
<p>Ohio, and Oliver, of Missouri  the latter a known svmpathiser
</p>
<p>with the Southern faction. This commission reached Law-
</p>
<p>484 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>rence April 17th, and at once entered upon its most onerous
</p>
<p>as well as dangerous duties. The Southern partisans viewed
</p>
<p>it with extreme distrust. Well they might, since the revela-
</p>
<p>tions made by the committee came before the country to prove,
</p>
<p>beyond cavil, the worst charges preferred against the National
</p>
<p>and Territorial Executives and the rufl&ans whose reign of ter-
</p>
<p>ror had made Kansas soil red with blood.
</p>
<p>Just prior to the arrival of the commission in Kansas there
</p>
<p>passed into the Territory a regiment of desperados recruited
</p>
<p>chiefly in South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama by one " Colo-
</p>
<p>nel" Buford. By whose order they were thus recruited none
</p>
<p>cared to confess. The fact that they were, on their arrival,
</p>
<p>adopted by the U. S. Marshal Donalson, as a posse, and were
</p>
<p>armed by Governor Shannon with United States muskets,
</p>
<p>proved their advent to have been part of the programme for
</p>
<p>making Kansas a Slave State. / A few of them, it is stated,
</p>
<p>came as honest settlers, to better their fortunes ; but, the great
</p>
<p>majority were arrant villains who long proved a pest to the
</p>
<p>Territory as assassins, highway robbers, horse thieves and
</p>
<p>rogues ready for any bad service. Duiing the session of the
</p>
<p>commission the outrages against Northern settlers culminated
</p>
<p>in " official" acts of great severity/ Armed with authority from
</p>
<p>Washington to enforce the acts of the Shawnee Assembly,
</p>
<p>Shannon felt secure, and " Sheriff' Jones proceeded to put in
</p>
<p>force his long threatened arrest for treason of leading Free
</p>
<p>State men. As preliminary to this arrest Donalson placed Bu-
</p>
<p>ford's vagabonds in quarters around Lawrence, where they
</p>
<p>soon became a terror to all inhabitants. Ju^e LecoiuptaTon
</p>
<p>the 6th of May, delivered his charge to a grand jury convened
</p>
<p>in Douglas county. His words were :
</p>
<p>" This Territory was organized by an act of Congress, and so far its
</p>
<p>autliority is from the United S.ates. It has a Legislature elected in pur-
</p>
<p>suance of that Organic act. This Legislature, being an instrument of
</p>
<p>Congress, by -wliich it governs the Territory, has passed laws; these laws

</p>
<p>therefore, are of United States authority and making, and all that resist
</p>
<p>these laws, resist the power and authority of the United States, and are,
</p>
<p>therefore, guilty of high treason. Xow, gentlemen, if you find that any
</p>
<p>persons liave resisted these laws, then must you, under your oaths, find
</p>
<p>bills against such persons for high treason. If you find that no such.

</p>
<p>resistance has been made, but tbat combinations have been formed for
</p>
<p>the purpose of resisting them, and individuals of influence and no-
</p>
<p>toriety have been aiding and abetting in sucli combinations, tlicn must
</p>
<p>you still find bills for constructive treason, as the courts have decid-
</p>
<p>ed that to constitute treason the blow need not be struck, but only
</p>
<p>the intention be made evident."
</p>
<p>This sentiment was reciprocated fully bj the Missouri jury-
</p>
<p>men, who were not long in concocting a presentment "that,
</p>
<p>from the evidence before them" they had to report the two
</p>
<p>Free State journals  The Herald of Freedom and The Kansas
</p>
<p>Free State  were demoralizing and seditious sheets, which they
</p>
<p>(the jurymen) recommended should be abated as nuisances.
</p>
<p>Also that the building in Lawrence known as the "Free State
</p>
<p>Hotel" was constructed with a view to regular military occu-
</p>
<p>pation and defense, and it was therefore a nuisance also to be
</p>
<p>abated! /Writs were soon secured "from the proper authori-
</p>
<p>ties" against many prominent Free State citizens in Lawrence
</p>
<p>and vicinity and their service committed to the proper repre-
</p>
<p>sentative of Marshal Donalson. The citizens of Lawrence were
</p>
<p>reputed to be prepared for this advent of their old enemy,
</p>
<p>hence the Deputy Marshal did not attempt to enter the town.
</p>
<p>Donalson then issued a call to the people of Kansas, May 11th,
</p>
<p>1846, commanding all "law abiding citizens of the Territoi-y"
</p>
<p>to appear at Lecompton, as soon as practicable and in numbers
</p>
<p>sufficient for the execution of the law.
</p>
<p>At the very moment of this call Buford's men and several
</p>
<p>other organized military bodies were close to Lawrence ready
</p>
<p>for duty. Their near vicinity called from the people of the
</p>
<p>town and the farmers around an address to the Governor, stat-
</p>
<p>ing that these men were but robbers and asking from him pro-
</p>
<p>tection by the United States' troops at his disposal. The Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor flatly refused all protection so long as the citizens were
</p>
<p>in arms to resist the laws. That the entire proceeding of Le-
</p>
<p>compte, Donalson and Shannon was a gross libel on the acts

<p>and circumstances of the Lawrence men the reader need hard
</p>
<p>ly be told. A meeting of the citizens held May 13th, adopted
</p>
<p>the following explicit resolution :
</p>
<p>" Resolved, By this public meeting of the citizens of Lawrence, held
</p>
<p>this thirteenth day of May, 1856, that the allegations and charges

<p>60
</p>
<p>486 THE KANSAS-NEBRASE'A STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>against us, contained in the aforesaid j^roclamation, are wholly untnie
</p>
<p>in fact, and the conclusion which is drawn from them. The aforesaid
</p>
<p>deputy marshal was resisted in no manner whatever, nor by any person
</p>
<p>whatever, in the execution of said writs, except by him whose arrest the
</p>
<p>said dejjuty marshal was seeking to make. And that we now, as we
</p>
<p>have done heretofore, declare our willingness and determination, with-
</p>
<p>out resistance, to acquiesce in the service upon us of any judicial writs
</p>
<p>against us by the United States Deputy Marshal for Kansas Territory,
</p>
<p>and will furnish him with a posse for that purpose, if so requested ; but
</p>
<p>that we are ready to resist, if need be, unto death, the ravages and deso- 
</p>
<p>lation of an invading mob. J. A, Wakefield, President."
</p>
<p>This was sent to Shannon and Donalson. A letter, signed
</p>
<p>by a large committee of the best citizens, was addressed to the
</p>
<p>Marshal, also, explicitly denying that any opposition had been
</p>
<p>offered to any legal process, or that any such would be offered,
</p>
<p>and asking protection from the mob. Donalson's reply was,
</p>
<p>like Shannon's, a pledge to give no quarter to men armed with
</p>
<p>Sharpe's rifles and bound together by oaths and pledge to re-
</p>
<p>sist the laws. As if the Free State settlers would have been
</p>
<p>unarmed in view of the dangers by which they had for months
</p>
<p>been surrounded ! As for being banded together to " resist the
</p>
<p>laws," the solemn declai'ations above cited disprove the charge.
</p>
<p>The pre-deter77imed purpose of all that demonstration was not
</p>
<p>to " enforce the laws" but to sack and hum Laivrence, and thus,
</p>
<p>by one decisive stroke, to get rid of the Free State faction.
</p>
<p>That was the sole intent of Lecompte's charge, of the writs of
</p>
<p>arrest issued, and of the presence before Lawrence of that large
</p>
<p>armed mob composed almost exclusively of non-residents of
</p>
<p>the Territory, and who gathered for the openly acknowledged
</p>
<p>object of clearing the Territory of all "abolitionists." Writs
</p>
<p>were obtained upon the affidavit of any pro-slavery rascal who
</p>
<p>coveted his neighbor's goods. Tliese the "Sheriff" served,
</p>
<p>with a large |)osse always at his side, and soon the ja-il at Le-
</p>
<p>compton was filled with Northern men  many of them perfect-

<p>ly guiltless of any act which even the " friends of the South"
</p>
<p>could construe into an offense. ! Soon, gathering assurance,
</p>
<p>this officer visited Lawrence and made numbers of arrests for
</p>
<p>alleged petty offenses. On the 23d of AjDril he came in with a
</p>
<p>strong guard of United States dragoons from the fort and ar-
</p>
<p>THE SACKING OF LAWEENCE. 487
</p>
<p>rested several leading citizens, for "resistance to the laws," for
</p>
<p>"inciting sedition," for "being dangerous to the public peace,"
</p>
<p>&c &c. This last arrest greatly excited the populace, who
</p>
<p>read in it the fate in store for every man who had taken a part
</p>
<p>in the State movement./ The prisoners wre bc^rne to the
</p>
<p>"Sheriff's" camp and quartered among his posse, subjected to
</p>
<p>insults and occasional acts of violence. Some one, during the
</p>
<p>night, shot into Jones' tent, wounding him slightly. This act
</p>
<p>awakened a second frenzy among the pro-slave press, which
</p>
<p>teemed with articles eulogistic of the brave Jones and defaming
</p>
<p>Northern men. ' The moment for sacking and burning Law-
</p>
<p>rence had come. Several murders followed of a most atrocious
</p>
<p>character  the victims being Northern settlers.
</p>
<p>On the morning of May 21st Marshal Donalson ordered the
</p>
<p>advance upon Lawrence. Mount Oread had been seized during
</p>
<p>the night and two cannon planted there. " Governor" Eobin-
</p>
<p>son's house, located on the hill, was seized and converted at
</p>
<p>pnce to the uses of the armed mob. By eight o'clock the town
</p>
<p>was surrounded. No resistance was, or had been, offered. The
</p>
<p>parade was useless since the inhabitants of the place had re-
</p>
<p>solved to submit to the course of "justice" and trust to the fu-
</p>
<p>ture to restore them their liberty and their rights. A Deputy
</p>
<p>Marshal, with a strong posse, proceeded to make arrests of two
</p>
<p>active Free State partisans. This done the Marshal ordered
</p>
<p>his " forces" to retire ; the U. S, dragoons withdrew, but Jones
</p>
<p>soon appeared on the scene, accompanied by ex- Vice President
</p>
<p>David E. Atchison. This latter addressed the mob, using the
</p>
<p>coarsest language, informing them that the time had arrived to
</p>
<p>"wipe out the accursed Abolitionists." Led by Jones and
</p>
<p>Atchison the ruf&ans then proceeded to the work of destruc-
</p>
<p>tion. The " Free State Hotel," and the two newspaper offices
</p>
<p>already named as having been indicted by Judge Lecompte's
</p>
<p>jury, were soon a mass of ruins. The affair was thus chron-
</p>
<p>icled by the Lecompton Union, Judge Lecompte's "organ."

<p>" During this time a^jpeals were made to Slieriif Jones to save the Aid
</p>
<p>Society's Hotel. This news reached the company's ears, and was receiv-
</p>
<p>ed with one universal cry of ' No, no ! blow it up ! blow it up ! '
</p>
<p>" About this time a banner was seen fluttering in tlie breeze over the
</p>
<p>488 THE KANSAS-NEBRASK^ STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>office of TTie JTerald of Freedom. Its color was a lilood-red, with a lone
</p>
<p>star in the centre, and South Carolina al)ove. This banner was placed
</p>
<p>there i)y the Carolinians  Messrs. Wrights and a Mr. Cross. The effect
</p>
<p>was i^rodigious. One tremendous and long continued shout burst from
</p>
<p>the ranks. Thus floated in triumph the banner of South Carolina  that
</p>
<p>single white star, so emblematic of her course in the early history of our
</p>
<p>sectional disturbances. When every Southern State stood almost upon
</p>
<p>the verge of ceding their dearest rights to the North, Carolina stood
</p>
<p>boldly out, the firm and unwavering advocate of Southern institu-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>" Thus floated victoriously the first banner of Southern rights over
</p>
<p>the abolition town of Lawrence, unfurled by the noble sons of Caro-
</p>
<p>lina, and every whijj of its folds seemed a death stroke to Beecher
</p>
<p>propagandism and the fanatics of the East. O ! that its red folds
</p>
<p>could have been seen by every Southern eye !
</p>
<p>"Mr. Jones listened to many entreaties and finally replied that it
</p>
<p>was beyond his power to do any thing, and gave the occupants so
</p>
<p>long to remove all private property from it. He ordered two com-
</p>
<p>panies into each printing office to destroy the press. Both presses
</p>
<p>were broken up and thrown into the street, the type thrown in the
</p>
<p>river, and all the material belonging to each office destroyed. After
</p>
<p>this was accomplished, and the private property removed from the
</p>
<p>hotel by the different companies, the cannon was brought in front
</p>
<p>of the house and directed their destructive blows upon the walls. The
</p>
<p>building caught on fire, and soon its walls came with a crash to the
</p>
<p>ground. Thus fell the abolition fortress ; and we hope this will teach
</p>
<p>the Aid Society a good lesson for the future."
</p>
<p>Then followed a promiscuous plunder and sacking of the
</p>
<p>town, from which the inhabitants had fled in terror. Stores
</p>
<p>were gutted, private houses pillaged, and what could not be
</p>
<p>borne away was destroyed by mutilation or smashing. This
</p>
<p>work of ruin was only stayed by the absolute weariness or
</p>
<p>drunkenness of the rioters, who were acting under the forms
</p>
<p>of territorial law. At night the heavens were lit up by the

<p>burning of Eobinson's fine house on Mount Oread. The drunk-
</p>
<p>en horde then disappeared bearing with them stolen wagons
</p>
<p>loaded with stolen plunder, drawn by stolen horses.
</p>
<p>What a picture for American citizens to contemplate ! The
</p>
<p>creatures who perpetrated this outrage upon law and upon so-
</p>
<p>ciety acted by virtue of the orders of United States authority,
</p>
<p>enforcing the mandates of a Chief Justice named by the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent and long after continued in office by him and his succes-
</p>
<p>OLD JOHN BEOWN". 489
</p>
<p>sor. The miscreants whose hands wrought the deed were in
</p>
<p>the pay of the recognized government, and were mostly armed
</p>
<p>with United States muskets. Governor Shannon made no inter-
</p>
<p>ference  the United States troops were not permitted to inter-
</p>
<p>pose, and the deed passed as a just retribution for the aboli-
</p>
<p>tionists. V Said Jones, as he witnessed the work of destruction :
</p>
<p>" This is the happiest day of my life. I determined to make
</p>
<p>the fanatics bow before me in the dust and to kiss the territo
</p>
<p>rial laws, and I have done it."
</p>
<p>After these proceedings there was an end of peace. The
</p>
<p>young and most ardent of the Free State settlers, stung to des-
</p>
<p>peration by their wrongs, apparently gave up all hopes of ani
</p>
<p>confraternity with the Southern rights' representatives, and
</p>
<p>with the resolve of men ready to test their principles with tlieii
</p>
<p>strength, took up arms to wage a war of extermination. Some
</p>
<p>of the leading citizens and most reputable settlers condemned,
</p>
<p>in strong terms, this reign of violence, and sought, by every
</p>
<p>means in their power, to stay it ; but without avail. A carni-
</p>
<p>val of robbery, pillage, arson and murder, succeeded.
</p>
<p>Old John Brown then first appeared, clearly outlined against
</p>
<p>the dark background, as the spirit of vengeance. Around him
</p>
<p>rallied a small troop of determined characters, who, led by the
</p>
<p>old man's invincible will, soon became a territorial terror.
</p>
<p>Brown's four sons had moved into Kansas early in the Spring
</p>
<p>of 1855 to become permanent residents, having with them val-
</p>
<p>uable stock, implements, &c., but no arms. Settling in Lykins
</p>
<p>county, on the Pottawattomie creek, about eight miles from
</p>
<p>Ossawattomie, they were exposed to the visits of marauders,
</p>
<p>and suffered so many outrages that the boys united in a letter
</p>
<p>to their father  a man then fifty -five years of age  urging him
</p>
<p>to come to them with arms for all. The old man heard " the
</p>
<p>call," and, by the help of Gerritt Smith, of New York State,
</p>
<p>proceeded to Kansas, accompanied by three more of his sons.
</p>
<p>He was in Lawrence during the " siege" ready for fight, but,

<p>the Free State men having resolved, after conference, not to be
</p>
<p>the first to precipitate the conflict, submitted peaceably, as we
</p>
<p>have seen, to the writs and violence of the territorial autliori-
</p>
<p>ties. /After the sacking of Lawrence Old John Brown entered
</p>
<p><
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>490 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>upon ''liis work" in earnest/ by leading a small company of
</p>
<p>resolute spirits with which to sweep over the Territory. The
</p>
<p>first act of his agents was to seize and slay a party of Southern
</p>
<p>desperados who, as a self constituted vigilance committee, Md.
</p>
<p>arranged to murder a number of Free State immigrants.; These
</p>
<p>desperados richly deserved death but the summary proceeding
</p>
<p>of Brown's men failed to command the assent of many of the
</p>
<p>settlers. The old man was not present at the slaughter, but
</p>
<p>endorsed it as necessary and just. This act aroused the Mis-
</p>
<p>gourians to new deeds of retaliation. / New invasions followed,
</p>
<p>more tragedies ensued, and the United States dragoons were
</p>
<p>called upon to disperse contending hosts of the two factions.
</p>
<p>The first "army" of Missourians, under command of one Et.
</p>
<p>Clay Pate, after committing many outrages ahd crimes, was
</p>
<p>bagged by Old Brown in a skirmish. Another and a more
</p>
<p>formidable force, gathered by Whitfield, then took the field.
</p>
<p>The town of Franklin became their rendezvous and depot. On
</p>
<p>it Old Brown fell during the night of June 2d, and captured
</p>
<p>the place with its stores. A gathering of forces followed, with
</p>
<p>the intent of fighting a pitched battle, which Brown was anx-
</p>
<p>ious to bring on ; but the Federal dragoons interfered and easi-
</p>
<p>ly induced the Missourians to retire. In leaving they took
</p>
<p>Ossawattomie in their course and sacked the town (.June 9th)
</p>
<p>with every mark of brutality. Says Dr. Gihon ; " There were

<p>broken open, and their contents appropriated or destroyed.
</p>
<p>Even rings were rudely pulled from the ears and fingers of the

<p>derers to increased violence in the prosecution of their mis-
</p>
<p>chievous work. Having completely stripped the town, they
</p>
<p>set fire to several houses, and then beat a rapid retreat, carry-
</p>
<p>ing off a number of horses, and loudly calling each other to
</p>
<p>greater haste, as ' the d  d abolitionists were coming ! ' There
</p>
<p>are hundreds of well authenticated accounts of the cruelties
</p>
<p>practised by this horde of ruffians, some of them too shocking
</p>
<p>and disgusting to relate, or to be accredited, if told. The tears
</p>
<p>and shrieks of terrified women, folded in their foul embrace,
</p>
<p>failed to touch a chord of mercy in their brutal hearts, and the
</p>
<p>mutilated bodies of murdered men, hanging upon the trees, or
</p>
<p>left to rot upon the prairies or in the deep ravines, or furnish
</p>
<p>food for vultures and wild beasts, told frightful stories of bru-
</p>
<p>tal ferocity from which the wildest savages might have shrunk
</p>
<p>with horror."
</p>
<p>The state of aSairs during June and July was truly distress-
</p>
<p>ing. In all localities under jurisdiction of Southern or territo-
</p>
<p>rial emissaries, the families of Northern men suffered every de-
</p>
<p>gree of indignity. Numbers of citizens of Leavenworth were
</p>
<p>sent on board of steamers, without warning, and shipped down
</p>
<p>the river. Others were imprisoned and their possessions seiz-
</p>
<p>ed. All passengers arriving from below were searched, and,
</p>
<p>if Free State men, were robbed of their money and goods. It
</p>
<p>was truly a reign of the canaille. ' Life, liberty and the pur-
</p>
<p>suit of happiness' were permitted to no Free State man except
</p>
<p>as a special favor. The Federal authorities removed Colonel
</p>
<p>Sumner for his openly avowed disgust at the proceedings of
</p>
<p>the Missourians and the territorial officials. General Persifer
</p>
<p>F. Smith, a pro-slave partisan, was given the command and
</p>
<p>arrived in July just after the Topeka Legislature had been dis-
</p>
<p>persed by the United States' dragoons. This Legislature, it
</p>
<p>will be remembered, was adjourned to meet July 4th. It did
</p>
<p>so meet, but Colonel Sumner, acting' under orders from Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, entered Topeka on that day and forbade the assembly.

<p>the writs of Donalsou and made their way to Washington, to
</p>
<p>urge the adoption of the State Constitution by Congress. That
</p>
<p>Mr. Pierce did not order their arrest in the National Capital
</p>
<p>probably was owing to a fear of consequences. Yet, under tbe
</p>
<p>forms of the National Constitution in what respect had they
</p>
<p>sinned ?
</p>
<p>The contest in Congress was keenly renewed late in Junay
</p>
<p>In the House, the Committee on Territories, through Mr. Grow,
</p>
<p>its Chairman, reported a bill for the admission of Kansas as a
</p>
<p>State under the Constitution submitted. The debate which
</p>
<p>succeeded was acrimonious and persistent, and, after various
</p>
<p>manoeuvres by its opponents, the bill was lost : yeas 106 nays
</p>
<p>107. This vote was, by strenuous efforts of Northern men,
</p>
<p>reconsidered, and, on July 3d, the second vote on the act for
</p>
<p>admission resulted in its adoption : yeas 99, nays 97.
</p>
<p>The State movement fared adversely in the Senate. IMr
</p>
<p>Douglas, as Chairman of the Committee on Territories, report-
</p>
<p>ed a bill appointing five commissioners to take a census of the
</p>
<p>legal voters of the Territory ; the Territory to be apportioned
</p>
<p>into fifty-two districts, which should elect delegates to decide
</p>
<p>upon a State Constitution ; the delegates to meet in December,
</p>
<p>1856, and to have power to decide if it was expedient to form
</p>
<p>a Constitution ; and, if so, to proceed with the formation of
</p>
<p>that instrument. This bill was adopted July 8d, after an inef-
</p>
<p>fectual but tenacious opposition from the Northern free soil
</p>
<p>members. Being sent to the House, it remained on the Speak-
</p>
<p>er's table untouched at the day of adjournment, Aug. 18th.
</p>
<p>On the 8th of July Mr. Douglas reported the House bill to
</p>
<p>admit Kansas, and offered an amendment striking out all after
</p>
<p>its enacting clause, substituting the Senate bill above referred
</p>
<p>to as adopted July 8d. Against this the free soil Senators
</p>
<p>struggled Iruitlessly ; the substitute passed by the vote of yeas
</p>
<p>82, nays 13. This vote of course amounted to a rejection of
</p>
<p>the Kansas State Constitution, and in leaving the Shawnee

</p>
<p>But, the fifieuds of Free Kansas did not give over the strug-

</p>
<p>gle in Congress. Having a bare majority in the House they
</p>
<p>sought, by various means, to restrain the Administration from
</p>
<p>pushing its cruel mandates to the extremes of enforcing the
</p>
<p>odious territorial laws. Yet, all efforts failed. There stood
</p>
<p>the heavy pro-slave majority of the Senate in the way, and no
</p>
<p>act for the relief of the oppressed people could pass a chamber
</p>
<p>so long accustomed to Southern rule that a free soil member
</p>
<p>was regarded as an interloper. In the House, however, was
</p>
<p>vested a power which even the Senate could not override nor
</p>
<p>the Executive defy. Toward the close of its turbulent and
</p>
<p>long-protracted session the annual appropriation bills came up.
</p>
<p>To these the House attached provisions calculated to effect
</p>
<p>what the due course of direct legislation could not accomplish.
</p>
<p>Provisos- were inserted abolishing, repealing or suspending the
</p>
<p>most obnoxious features of the territorial Legislature. These
</p>
<p>provisions the Senate resisted and successfully so, as far as
</p>
<p>general appropriations were concerned ; but, one item, of
</p>
<p>$20,000, to pay the next session of that infamous territorial
</p>
<p>legislative body was abandoned by the Senate in order to save
</p>
<p>the civil appropriation bill from total defeat. /But the two"
</p>
<p>Houses came to a dead lock on a proviso "forbidding the em-
</p>
<p>ployment of the army to enforce the acts of the Shawnee Mis-
</p>
<p>sion assemblage, claiming to be a territorial Legislature of
</p>
<p>Kansas, when at noon on the 18th of August the Speaker's
</p>
<p>hammer fell, announcing the termination of the session, leaving
</p>
<p>the army bill unpassed. But President Pierce immediately
</p>
<p>issued a proclamation convening an extra session on the 21st
</p>
<p>(Thursday), when the two Houses reconvened accordingly, and
</p>
<p>a full quorum of each was found to be present. The House
</p>
<p>promptly repassed the army bill, again affixing a proviso for-
</p>
<p>bidding the use of the army to enforce the disputed territorial
</p>
<p>laws, which proviso the Senate as promptly struck out, and
</p>
<p>the House as promptly reinserted. The Senate insisted on its
</p>
<p>disagreement, but asked no conference, and the House (Aug.

<p>22d) by a close vote decided to adhere to its proviso, yeas 97,
</p>
<p>nays 93 ; but one of the yeas (Bocock, of Va.) was so given in
</p>
<p>order to be able to move a 'reconsideration ; so that the true
</p>
<p>division was 96 to 94, which was the actual division on a mo-

</p>
<p>tlon by Mr. Cobb, of Ga., that tlie House recede from its posi-
</p>
<p>tion. Finally, a motion to reconsider was made and laid on
</p>
<p>the table; yeas 97, nays 96, and the House thereupon ad-
</p>
<p>journed."
</p>
<p>" The struggle for the passage of the bill with or without the
</p>
<p>proviso continued until Saturday, Aug. 80th, when, several
</p>
<p>members, hostile to the proviso, and hitherto absent, unpaired,
</p>
<p>having returned, the House again passed the Army bill with
</p>
<p>the proviso modified as follows :
</p>
<p>" ' Provided, however, that no part of the military force of the United
</p>
<p>States, for the support of -which appropriations are made by this act,
</p>
<p>shall be employed in aid of the enforcement of any enactments hereto-
</p>
<p>fore made by the body claiming to be the Territorial Legislature of
</p>
<p>Kansas.'
</p>
<p>" The bill passed as reported (under the previous question) :
</p>
<p>yeas 99, nays 79, and was sent to the Senate, where the above
</p>
<p>proviso was stricken out, yeas 26, nays 7, and the bill thus re-
</p>
<p>turned to the House, when the Senate's amendment was con-
</p>
<p>curred in, yeas 101, nays 97.
</p>
<p>" So the proviso was beaten at last, and the bill passed, with
</p>
<p>no restriction on the President's discretion in the u.se of the
</p>
<p>army in Kansas ; just as all attempts of the House to direct
</p>
<p>the President to have a nolle prosequi entered in the case of the
</p>
<p>Free State prisoners in Kansas charged with aiding the forma-
</p>
<p>tion and adoption of the Free State Constitution as aforesaid
</p>
<p>had been previously beaten, after prevailing in the House^
</p>
<p>the Senate striking them out, and the House (by union of
</p>
<p>nearly all the supporters of Fillmore with nearly or quite all
</p>
<p>those supporting Buchanan) finally acquiescing.'"
</p>
<p>This result left the Free State party in Kansas under the
</p>
<p>ban of the law, and those in authority, for a few months, held
</p>
<p>wild riot in their success. Shannon was removed during Au-

<p>days prior to his receiving the seal of office, Atchison, Colonel
</p>
<p>Boone, Colonel Eussell and " General" B. F. Stringfellow, had
</p>
<p>issued a circular from Westport, Missouri, announcing that
</p>
<p>James H. Lane had entered Kansas with a large army  had
</p>
<p>captured Lecompton, and had liberated the State prisoners
</p>
<p>there confined  had committed other acts demanding ven-
</p>
<p>geance. The circular therefore called upon all " true men." to
</p>
<p>rally to their several rendezvous, there to organize to meet the
</p>
<p>daring liberator.' This call Woodson repeated in a proclama-
</p>
<p>tion dated August 25th, declaring the Territory in a state of
</p>
<p>rebellion and insurrection and calling for help to put down the
</p>
<p>insurrectionists and to bring to condign punishment all who
</p>
<p>were engaged with them. It was all a well concerted pro-
</p>
<p>gramme, to sanction a second overwhelming invasion. This
</p>
<p>Governor's call found about eleven hundred ruffians already
</p>
<p>gathered at Little Santa Fe, on the Missouri border, who soon
</p>
<p>were on their mission of " extermination.", A section of Atch-

<p>to be at that place with his body guard of about thirty meiL

<p>cannot go hitch up their wagons and throw in a few provisions, and get more as
</p>
<p>they come along by their neighbors, and bring them to Lexington on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>Let others bring horses and mules, and saddles and guns  all to come in on Wed-

<p>and, for three hours held the Missourians at baj. Not over-
</p>
<p>come, but in danger of being outflanked, he was compelled,
</p>
<p>under a sharp fire, to pass the creek, losing two of his party,
</p>
<p>killed. The Missourians' scouts, led by a preacher named
</p>
<p>White, a member of the Kansas Legislature, had, prior to the
</p>
<p>appearance of Eeid's force, come upon Brown's youngest son,
</p>
<p>Frederick, a boy of eighteen, and four others. These young
</p>
<p>men were not attached to any military command, .Young
</p>
<p>Brown was killed, together with one of his companions, who
</p>
<p>was shockingly mutilated. Another was left for dead in the
</p>
<p>road. Old Brown at that time was about two miles away, with
</p>
<p>only fifteen men. He fell back upon the town, hoping to de-
</p>
<p>fend it ; but, finding the enemy too powerful, he took to the
</p>
<p>woods, where, joined by twelve mounted men, he maintained
</p>
<p>the fight as above noted.
</p>
<p>After the " victory" Eeid's men entered the village, burned
</p>
<p>between twenty and thirty houses, robbed the post office, plun-
</p>
<p>dered the stores, seized all the horses, cattle and wagons, and,
</p>
<p>loaded with spoils made off in haste to Missouri to boast of
</p>
<p>having "wiped out another d  d -abolition hole." It cost the
</p>
<p>ruffians between twenty and thirty lives to secure that "glori-
</p>
<p>ous result."
</p>
<p>The main division of Atchison's forces marched toward Bull
</p>
<p>creek, to which spot Lane also directed his course with three
</p>
<p>hundred men. Before this array of Northern muskets the Mis-
</p>
<p>sourians retreated in haste, with a cowardice discreditable even
</p>
<p>to them. Thus this invasion temporarily ended. Lane then
</p>
<p>pushed on to Lecompton, whither a number of Free State men
</p>
<p>agam had been carried as prisoners. ' On the morning of Sept.
</p>
<p>4th he appeared, with his cannon, on Court House hill, com-
</p>
<p>manding the town. " General" Richardson refused to fight and
</p>
<p>threw up his commission in disgust at the running away of his
</p>
<p>constituents. Another "General" was found, who treated with
</p>
<p>Lane, agreeing to deliver up all the prisoners in his keeping.

<p>This he did, by sending them into Lawrence the next day,
</p>
<p>under an escort of United States dragoons ! Lane returned to

<p>Lawrence, but kept the field with his vigilant force until Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Geary issued his Inaugural Address, and Proclamation

</p>
<p>of Sept. 11th, 1856. These documents seemed so reassuring
</p>
<p>of peace that Lane disbanded his men and countermanded or-
</p>
<p>ders then dispatched to Lawrence for men and cannon to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed against a party of Missourians strongly housed at Hickory
</p>
<p>Point. The countermand came too late. Captain Harvey,
</p>
<p>with one hundred and ten men, left Lawrence Saturday, and,
</p>
<p>by a forced march, reached the point indicated, Sunday morn-
</p>
<p>ing. A short, sharp conflict resulted in the capture of the Mis-
</p>
<p>sourians, but Harvey's men were, in turn secured by a force
</p>
<p>of dragoons dispatched from Lecompton by orders of Governor
</p>
<p>Geary. The Governor regarded these men as the aggressors,
</p>
<p>and held them prisoners for trial.
</p>
<p>"^ At the moment these exciting incidents were transpiring
</p>
<p>great excitement prevailed in the vicinity of Lawrence. . The
</p>
<p>approach of a large body of Missourians was announced during

</p>
<p>lighting material of the town much alarm was felt for its safety.
</p>
<p>Old John Brown, however, was in the place and, under his ac-
</p>
<p>tive direction the citizens of the town were put into the extem-
</p>
<p>porised defenses, while, with a force of about fifty riflemen.
</p>
<p>Brown proceeded to an advanced position on the prairie to
</p>
<p>engage the invaders. By five o'clock a considerable body of
</p>
<p>the Missouri " militia" had crossed the Wakarusa, These the
</p>
<p>Lawrence men soon engaged to advantage, and darkness came
</p>
<p>to find the fight pressed sharply by the riflemen. Though full
</p>
<p>three hundred strong, and mounted, the Missourians were out-
</p>
<p>manoeuvred by Brown's excellent arrangements and were forced
</p>
<p>to retire upon their main body, then at Franklin..
</p>
<p>A messenger, dispatched in haste to the Governor, at Le-
</p>
<p>compton, informed him of this threatened attack. He at once
</p>
<p>ordered forward the dragoons under Colonel Cook, with in-
</p>
<p>structions to prevent a collision. Colonel Cook reached Law-

<p>rence Sunday evening to find the Lawrence men under Brown

<p>fellow, " determined to exterminate that place (Lawrence) and
</p>
<p>all its inhabitants." Said Geary, in his dispatch to Mr. Marc\^
</p>
<p>of Sept. 16th, 1856: " Fully appreciating the awfulcalamitiL'S
</p>
<p>that were impending, I hastened with all possible dispatcii to
</p>
<p>the encampment, assembled the ojEiicers of the militia, and in
</p>
<p>the name of the President of the United States, demanded sus-
</p>
<p>pension of hostilities. / I had sent in advance, the secretary and
</p>
<p>adjutant-general of the Territory, with orders to carry out the
</p>
<p>spirit and letter of my proclamations ; but, up to the time of
</p>
<p>my arrival, these orders had been unheeded, and I could dis-
</p>
<p>cover but little disposition to obey them. I addressed the
</p>
<p>officers in council at considerable length, setting forth the dis-
</p>
<p>astrous consequences of such a demonstration as was contem-
</p>
<p>plated, and the absolute necessity of more lawful and concilia-
</p>
<p>tory measures to restore peace, tranquillity and prosperity to
</p>
<p>the country. I read my instructions from the President, and
</p>
<p>convinced them that my whole course of procedure was in ac-
</p>
<p>cordance therewith, and called upon them to aid me in my ef-
</p>
<p>forts, not only'to carry o\it those instructions, but to support
</p>
<p>ajid enforce the laws, and the Constitution of the United States.
</p>
<p>I am happy to say, that a more ready concurrence in my views
</p>
<p>was met, than I had at first any good reason to expect. It
</p>
<p>was agreed, that the terms of my proclamations should be car-
</p>
<p>ried out by the disbandment of the militia; whereupon the
</p>

<p>Geary's arrival in the distracted Territory was, indeed, op

<p>portune. He was, seemingly, well qualified for his mission of
</p>
<p>peace. Had the President named him to the trust committed

<p>to the wretched Shannon, much of the tragedy of Kansas never
</p>
<p>would have been written. His first dispatch to the War De-

<p>condition. To show the reader that the record which we have

</p>
<p> infatuated adherents and advocates of conflicting politica] sentiments
</p>
<p>and local institutions and evil-disposed persons, actuated by a desire
</p>
<p>to obtain elevated positions ; but, worst of all, against the influence of
</p>
<p>men who have been placed in authority, and have employed all the de-
</p>
<p>structive agents around them to promote their own personal interests,
</p>
<p>at the sacrifice of every just, honorable and lawful consideration.
</p>
<p>" I have barely time to give you a brief statement of facts as I find
</p>
<p>them. The town of Leavenworth is now in the hands of armed bodies
</p>
<p>of men, who, having been enrolled as militia, perpetrate outrages of the
</p>
<p>most atrocious character under shadow of authority from the territorial
</p>
<p>Government. Within a few days these men have robbed and driven
</p>
<p>from their homes unoffending citizens ; have fired upon and killed others
</p>
<p>in their own dwellings ; and stolen horses and property under the pre-
</p>
<p>tence of employing them in the public service. They have seized per-
</p>
<p>sons who have committed no offense ; and, after stripping them of all
</p>
<p>their valuables, placed them on steamers, and sent them out of the Ter-
</p>
<p>ritory. Some of these bands, who have thus violated their rights and
</p>
<p>privileges, and shamefully and shockingly misused and abused the old-
</p>
<p>est inhabitants of the Territory, who had settled here with their wives
</p>
<p>and children, are strangers from distant States, who have no interest in,
</p>
<p>nor care for the welfare of Kansas, and contemplate remaining here only
</p>
<p>so long as opportunities for mischief and lolunder exist.
</p>
<p>'' The actual pro-slavery settlers of the Territory are generally as well
</p>
<p>disposed persons as are to be found in most communities. But there
</p>
<p>are among them a few troublesome agitators, chiefly from distant dis-
</p>
<p>tricts, who labor assiduously to keep alive the prevailing sentiment.
</p>
<p>" It is also true that among the free soil residents are many peaceable
</p>
<p>and useful citizens ; and if uninfluenced by aspiring demagogues, would
</p>
<p>commit no unlawful act. But many of these, too, have been rendered
</p>
<p>turbulent by officious meddlers from abroad. The chief of these is Lane,
</p>
<p>now encamped and fortified at Lawrence, with a force, it is said, of fif-
</p>
<p>teen hundred men. They are suflering for provisions, to cut off" the
</p>
<p>supplies of which, the opposing faction is extremely watchful and
</p>
<p>active.

<p>"In isolated or country places, no man's life is safe. The roads are
</p>
<p>filled with armed robbers, and murders for mere plunder are of daily
</p>
<p>occurrence. Almost every farm-house is deserted, and no traveller has
</p>
<p>the temerity to venture upon the highway without an escort."
</p>
<p>The reader will infer that the Governor's views, as to Lane's
</p>
<p>brigandism, underwent a change ere a month had passed, by
</p>
<p>which time he discovered that it tvas that leader's prowess alone
</p>
<p>which had saved the town of Lawrence from destruction and
</p>
<p>the Territory from utter subjugation by a foreign host. If the

<p>500 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>Governor afterwards prosecuted Harvey's men, whom he held
</p>
<p>as prisoners to be tried as violators of the peace, it was because
</p>
<p>they were so ; and that he permitted the army assembled be-
</p>
<p>fore Lawrence for its destruction to depart, was for the reason
</p>
<p>that those ruffians were there by virtue of the proclamation of
</p>
<p>the acting Governor Woodson  therefore they could not be ar-
</p>
<p>rested. That the Lawrence people welcomed the Governor 
</p>
<p>that Lane hastened to obey the injunctions of Geary's inaugu-
</p>
<p>ral message and proclamation, are incidents which show the
</p>
<p>character of the Free State men ; while the curses heaped upon
</p>
<p>the Governor by the invaders and the pro-slave faction general-
</p>
<p>ly, are evidences of their innate dislike of law and peace. Says
</p>
<p>Dr. Gihon (who was the Governor's private secretary and ac-
</p>
<p>companied Geary to the scene of hostilities before Lawrence) :
</p>
<p>" There, in battle array, were ranged at least tliree thousand
</p>
<p>armed and desperate men. They were not dressed in the usual
</p>
<p>habiliments of soldiers, but in every imaginable costume that
</p>
<p>could be obtained in that western region. Scarcely two pre-
</p>
<p>sented the same appearance, while all exhibited a ruffianly as-
</p>
<p>pect. Most of them were mounted, and manifested an unmis-
</p>
<p>takable disposition to be at their bloody work. In the back-
</p>
<p>ground stood at least three hundred army tents and as many
</p>
<p>wagons, while here and there a cannon was planted, ready to
</p>
<p>aid in the anticipated destruction. Among the banners floated
</p>
<p>black flags to indicate the design that neither age, sex nor con-
</p>
<p>dition would be spared in the slaughter that was to ensue.
</p>
<p>The arms and cannon also bore the black indices of extermi-
</p>
<p>nation.
</p>
<p>" In passing along the lines, murmurs of discontent and sav-
</p>
<p>age threats of assassination fell upon the Governor's ears ; but,
</p>
<p>heedless of these, and regardless, in fact, of everything but a
</p>
<p>desire to avert the terrible calamity that was impending, he
</p>
<p>fearlessly proceeded to the quarters of their leader. * * * To

<p>Atchison, he especially addressed himself, telling him that

</p>
<p>of men, with uncontrollable passions, and determined upon
</p>
<p>wholesale slaughter and destruction. He concluded his re-
</p>
<p>marks by directing attention to his proclamation, and ordered
</p>
<p>the army to be disbanded and dispersed. Some of the more
</p>
<p>judicious of the officers were not only willing but anxious to
</p>
<p>obey this" order ; whilst others, resolved upon mischief, yielded
</p>
<p>a very reluctant assent. General Clarke said he was for pitch-
</p>
<p>ing into thq United States troops, if necessary, rather than
</p>
<p>abandon the objects of the expedition. General Maclean didn't
</p>
<p>see any use of going back until they had whipped the d  d
</p>
<p>abolitionists. Sheriff Jones was in favor, now they had a suf-
</p>
<p>ficient force, of " wiping out" Lawrence and all the Free State
</p>
<p>towns. And these and others, cursed Governor Geary in not
</p>
<p>very gentle expressions, for his untimely interference with their
</p>
<p>well laid plans. They, however, obeyed the order, and retired,
</p>
<p>not as good and law-loving citizens, but as bands of plunderers
</p>
<p>and destroyers, leaving in their wake rained fortunes, weeping
</p>
<p>eyes and sorrowing hearts."
</p>
<p>The history of Geary's brief administration is one of exceed-
</p>
<p>ing novelty, as illustrative of the peculiar faculty for crime and
</p>
<p>disorder of the pro-slave partisans and the extraordinary facili-
</p>
<p>ty with which the Judges, United States Attorney and Marshal
</p>
<p>baffled the Governor's endeavors to bring criminals to justice.
</p>
<p>Only in a few instances did the Executive succeed in securing
</p>
<p>the trial of men whose hands were red with Free State blood ;
</p>
<p>but, even in the case of these awful criminals, Judge Lecompte's
</p>
<p>acceptance of worthless bail, or a pro-slave and packed jury,
</p>
<p>soon relieved the prison of its just prey. Yet, there was great
</p>
<p>progress toward order, and, by a rigid surveillance of the mu-
</p>
<p>nicipal and preliminary jurisdictions, a flattering state of affairs
</p>
<p>rapidly succeeded the Governor's efforts. An election, ordered
</p>
<p>by proclamation, came off October 6th. It was to elect mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the territorial House of Kepresentatives, a delegate to
</p>
<p>Congress and also to decide upon the question of a State Con-

<p>vention. About twenty-five hundred votes were polled  al-
</p>
<p>most exclusively by pro-slave men. The members elect were,
</p>
<p>therefore, of the old order of things, Whitfield was re-elected
</p>
<p>as delegate, and the Shawnee Mission laws were triumphant
</p>
<p>62
</p>
<p>502 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>In this election the Free State men did not participate, as their
</p>
<p>policy, at that time, was to ignoi-e the entire territorial govern-
</p>
<p>ment as a usurpation and a foreign body. They still adhered
</p>
<p>to their Topeka State organization, although it was outlawed
</p>
<p>and powerless. The Governor made an extended tour through
</p>
<p>the Territory, consuming the time from Oct 17th to ^ov. 8th.
</p>
<p>He reported to the War Department a favorable feeling, and
</p>
<p>spoke hopefully of the futilre. On the 20th of Nov. a large
</p>
<p>meeting of citizens was held in Leavenworth City, at which,
</p>
<p>among other resolutions passed, were the following :
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That we cordially approve any and all measures that may
</p>
<p>have a tendency to restore j^eace and harmony among tlie citizens of
</p>
<p>Kansas ; that in view of the jjast and impressed with the importance of
</p>
<p>the present, we earnestly imjjlore our fellow-citizens, without distinction
</p>
<p>of party, to aid in the preservation of peace and order by adopting a
</p>
<p>policy of conciliation.
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That whatever difference of opinion may prevail touching
</p>
<p>the circumstances that resulted in the adoption of existing laws, we
</p>
<p>deem it the dutj' of every man to suj^port and sustain these laws, in
</p>
<p>preference to having no laws at all, and continuing the anarchy that has
</p>
<p>too long prevailed.
</p>
<p>" Resolved, that we believe the existing territorial laws contain pro-
</p>
<p>visions that should be repealed, and we have confidence that the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature, at the next session, will, with a sj^irit of justice and moderation,
</p>
<p>correct oiipre&sive legislation."
</p>
<p>The meeting of the "adjourned session' of the Topeka Leg-
</p>
<p>islature came off Jan. 6th, 1857. It was arranged by the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor to dissolve the assembly simply by proclamation, with
</p>
<p>troops in reserve at Lecompton to enforce his order if it were
</p>
<p>resisted. But, " Sheriff" Jones pressed his unwelcome presence
</p>
<p>upon the public once more. Having obtained from Judge
</p>
<p>Cato writs for the arrest of the legislators for treason, he pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to Topeka on the opening day and served his j)rocesses.
</p>
<p>No opposition was offered, greatly to Jones' discomfiture. He

</p>
<p>had calculated upon a resistance to his oflGicious intermeddling,
</p>
<p>and a second outbreak in consequence  thus deranging the.
</p>
<p>Governor's peaceful programme. Quiet submission to arrest
</p>
<p>averted the solicited outbreak and preserved the peace. . Pre-
</p>
<p>vious to this descent of the vulture the legislators had assem-
</p>
<p>bled in informal meeting and prepared a second memorial to
</p>
<p>THE LECOMPTON ASSEMBLY. 503
</p>
<p>Congress. As prisoners of State tlie assemblymen were con-
</p>
<p>veyed by Jones to Tecumseh and were kept under arrest until
</p>
<p>the next day, w^lien all were admitted to bail on their own re-
</p>
<p>cognizances. A nolle prosequi afterwards was entered by the
</p>
<p>district attorney, and thus the designed outrage ended as a
</p>
<p>farce. The whole proceeding met with Geary's disapproval.
</p>
<p>The Shawnee Mission Territorial Assembly convened at
</p>
<p>Lecompton Jan. 12th, 1857  the Mission having ceased to be
</p>
<p>the capital. Governor Geary sent in his message. It was a
</p>
<p>document of so much force and pertinency as greatly to excite
</p>
<p>the Assembly. The Governor denounced their "territorial
</p>
<p>militia," and refused to regard their " law and order" jDartisans
</p>
<p>otherwise than as bandits. He also failed to denounce the
</p>
<p>Free State settlers for having arms and using them in their own
</p>
<p>defense. Six thousand copies of the unpalatable message were
</p>
<p>ordered to be printed, but the printers of State (the Lecompton
</p>
<p>Union of&ce) conveniently neither had paper nor types for the
</p>
<p>performance of the order  hence, the message was not circu-
</p>
<p>lated. A secret caucus of the members resolved to disregard
</p>
<p>the Governor's apprehended vetoes of their pre-determined leg-
</p>
<p>islation, and afterwards acted upon the understanding by re-
</p>
<p>passing at once every vetoed act. As already stated, the legis-
</p>
<p>lators, exercising the rights of "sovereigns," had passed acts
</p>
<p>stripping the Governor of all power except what was vested in
</p>
<p>him by the Organic act ; but this act was so printed and con-
</p>
<p>strued as to deny him the usual power of pardon or remission
</p>
<p>of sentence. Then the rogues resolved to use their usurped
</p>
<p>authority by depriving him of the veto power itself! Said Dr.
</p>
<p>Gihon : " The Governor was apprised of this fact, but scarcely
</p>
<p>believing so infamous a measure possible, attempted to arrest
</p>
<p>several bills, by offering the most tangible objections, which
</p>
<p>only served to excite the merriment of members and call down
</p>
<p>upon his own head the most violent anathemas. Indeed, the
</p>
<p>greater portion of the time of the session was taken up with

<p>long speeches denunciatory of his Excellency for his supposed
</p>
<p>impartiality, or, rather, his unwillingness to ' go in' heart and
</p>
<p>soul, with all his ability, influence and power, to advance the
</p>
<p>interests of the pro-slavery cause. So entirely were they de

<p>504 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>voted to this peculiar object, that it was a common expression
</p>
<p>of the idlers of the town, when no better employment was on
</p>
<p>hand, to say to each other, ' Come, let us go over to the House
</p>
<p>to hear Jenkins,' or Brown, or Anderson, or O'Driscoll, or
</p>
<p>Johnson, or some other prominent orator, 'abuse the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor.' "
</p>
<p>Thus passed the term of this session of drunkards  a body
</p>
<p>of bad men chiefly directed by such designing knaves as At-
</p>
<p>chison, Woodson, Whitfield, Stringfellow, Calhoun, etc., who,
</p>
<p>in turn, were but ministers of that powerful pro-slave coterie
</p>
<p>at Washington which controlled President, Cabinet and Senate.
</p>
<p>The entire legislation proved so corrupt, so wicked, so repug-
</p>
<p>nant to every sense of justice as to shock even the legislators
</p>
<p>themselves when they had time to dissipate the fumes of Jack
</p>
<p>Thompson's whiskey. Their acts stand on the historic record
</p>
<p>only as additional evidence of the disgusting debasement of
</p>
<p>all law and justice at the hands of those "friends of Southern
</p>
<p>institutions." And that class only was recognised by the Pre-
</p>
<p>sident as law-givers for the Territory ! The story of that Win-
</p>
<p>ter is so filled with violence and blood, personal outrages upon
</p>
<p>the Governor and his friends, infamous ofiicial proceedings and
</p>
<p>defilement of all the avenues of law, as to render its repetition
</p>
<p>humiliating. We pass it over with the sense of relief whicli
</p>
<p>one experiences when conscious that a leper has ceased to taint
</p>
<p>the air with his presence.
</p>
<p>To one act we must refer, owing to its connection with suc-
</p>
<p>ceeding political events of vital significance. The Legislature
</p>
<p>was supplied (from Washington it is said) with a census bill,
</p>
<p>providing for an enumeration of the inhabitants as preliminary
</p>
<p>to an election of delegates to a Convention for forming a State
</p>
<p>Constitution. The bill possessed highly objectionable features,
</p>
<p>and the Governor asked a conference with the chairmen of the
</p>
<p>House and Council Committees. The act, as then matured,
</p>
<p>forbid the people of the State to vote upon the Constitution,

</p>
<p>after its adoption by the Convention. This popular exclusion
</p>
<p>was engrafted upon the act to prevent the Free State expres-
</p>
<p>sion, and was so confessed to the Governor by the chairmen,
</p>
<p>in their conference. They stated, in their interview with Geary,
</p>
<p>THE LECOMPTON CENSUS ACT. 505
</p>
<p>that the question of submission to a vote of the people had
</p>
<p>been fully considered, and that it would not be admitted since
</p>
<p>it "would defeat the only object of the act, which was to se-
</p>
<p>cure, beyond any possibility of failure, the Territory of Kansas
</p>
<p>to the South as a Slave State. Any alteration in the bill would
</p>
<p>be fatal to their projects. Even should they allow the Spring
</p>
<p>immigration to take part in the election, their plans would be
</p>
<p>frustrated. This, they said, was their last hope, and they could
</p>
<p>not let the opportunity pass unimproved. They had already,
</p>
<p>in anticipation of the passage of the bill, so apportioned the
</p>
<p>Territory, and made such other preliminary arrangements, thai
</p>
<p>the success of this grand project was placed beyond the read
</p>
<p>of any contingency that might now occur." The census act,
</p>
<p>therefore, passed as first ordered. Geary vetoed it in a mes-
</p>
<p>sage setting forth, with much force and with perfect conclu-
</p>
<p>sions, its injustice and violation of all precedent ; but, the As-
</p>
<p>sembly repassed it without hesitation, over the veto, and it be-
</p>
<p>came the law. Under that act the mockery of a true census
</p>
<p>was taken  the Legislature naming all the processes of the
</p>
<p>enumeration, the officers, &c. Governor Geary, sickened and
</p>
<p>dismayed at this reign of faction, and obtaining from Washing-
</p>
<p>ton only implied censure for his " obstinacy," resigned, under
</p>
<p>date of March 4th  the resignation to take effect March 20th.
</p>
<p>He was forced to this step apparently by circumstances which
</p>
<p>could have been averted only by his utter abjuration of self-
</p>
<p>respect and honesty. That his reign was one of designed good
</p>
<p>is not now gainsayed : if he accomplished but little it was be-
</p>
<p>cause he labored without co-operation, and, ultimately, was
</p>
<p>left helpless before the power of the most wicked and most
</p>
<p>reckless body of legislators ever recognized by a civilized gov-
</p>
<p>ernment.
</p>
<p>How the census act was enforced we are told by numerous
</p>
<p>writers. All agree that it had not even the farce of form to
</p>
<p>commend it ; it was a mockery unworthy even of " border ruf-

<p>fian" dishonesty. Out of thirty-eight organised counties but
</p>
<p>twenty-six were entered for representation in the Constitution-
</p>
<p>al Convention. Of these twenty-six the actual census was
</p>
<p>taken in ten only. In some of these ten only a partial enume-
</p>
<p>506 THE KANSAS- NEBRASKA STRUGGLE
</p>
<p>ration was made. In six other counties the poll list was made
</p>
<p>up from the old jpoU hooks! No registry was made in the fine
</p>
<p>and well settled counties south of the Kansas river, for they
</p>
<p>were peopled with Free State families. By this manipulation
</p>
<p>of the " territorial authorities," quite three-fifths of the people
</p>
<p>were given no voice in the election of delegates. A strong
</p>
<p>pro-slave delegation of course was returned. So outrageous
</p>
<p>was the entire proceeding that, in counties where the Free State
</p>
<p>men were permitted to vote, they refused to participate and the
</p>
<p>election was all on one side. Yet, James Buchanan, President
</p>
<p>of the United States, in referring to this abstinence charged it
</p>
<p>to a revolutionary spirit, at the same time characterising the
</p>
<p>census act as, in the main, fair and just ! Let us quote his
</p>
<p>words :
</p>
<p>" On the 19tli of February previous, the territorial Legislature had
</p>
<p>passed a law providing for the election of delegates on the first Mon-
</p>
<p>day of June, to a convention to meet on the first Monday in Sei^tember,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of framing a Constitution preparatory to admission into
</p>
<p>the Union, This law was in the main fair and just ; and it is to be re-
</p>
<p>gretted that all the qualified electors had not registered themselves and
</p>
<p>voted under its provisions.
</p>
<p>" At the time of the election for delegates, an extensive organization
</p>
<p>existed in the Territory, whose avowed object it was, if need be, to put
</p>
<p>down the lawful government by force, and to establish a government of
</p>
<p>their own, under the so-called Topeka Constitution. The persons at-
</p>
<p>tached to this revolutionary organization abstained from taking any
</p>
<p>part in the election."
</p>
<p>They did abstain ; for what citizen, respecting the boon of
</p>
<p>an elective franchise, could participate in that prostitution of it
</p>
<p>to the most undemocratic ends ? The opinion, however, pre-
</p>

<p>Robert J. Walker, late of Mississippi  that the Constitution,

<p>The Free State men, therefore, were satisfied to await the vote

<p>upon ratification when they might, as legal voters, put their
</p>
<p>veto upon the whole " territorial" proceeding. It was enough
</p>
<p>for them to reply to Governor Walker's earnest request for
</p>
<p>them to go the polls June 15th, 1857, to vote for delegates,
</p>
<p>that in nineteen out of thirty-eight counties no registry even
</p>
<p>had been made, and that, in fifteen of the nineteen counties, no
</p>
<p>FIRST FREE STATE TRIUMPH. 507
</p>
<p>census had been taken hence those counties could not be rep-
</p>
<p>resented in the Convention. As those counties, lying south
</p>
<p>of the Kansas river, were filled with Free State towns and were
</p>
<p>teeming with Free State industry, it is not a matter of surprise
</p>
<p>that the friends of the Topeka Free State movement abstained
</p>
<p>from the mockery of voting for delegates to that prescriptive
</p>
<p>Convention.
</p>
<p>The entire vote cast at the election for delegates was but
</p>
<p>2200. The delegates elect assembled in Convention at Le-
</p>
<p>compton, Sept. 6th, but soon adjourned over to October, to
</p>
<p>await the result of the territorial election on the first Monday
</p>
<p>of that month. At this territorial election both parties nomi-
</p>
<p>nated candidates. At the request of Governor Walker, two
</p>
<p>thousand U. S. troops were in the Territory, and they were
</p>
<p>stationed so as to protect the polls as much as possible. Over
</p>
<p>eleven thousand votes were polled, after rejecting twenty-eight
</p>
<p>hundred as fraudulent and irregular, sixteen hundred of which
</p>
<p>were returned from the Oxford precinct, where, according to
</p>
<p>the census, there were but forty-three voters, and twelve hun-
</p>
<p>dred from McGee county, where no poll was opened. The re-
</p>
<p>sult of this election was the Free State party carried the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature and the delegate to Congress.
</p>
<p>" The Convention reassembled in October, according to ad-
</p>
<p>journment, and formed the Constitution now so famous as the
</p>
<p>Lecompton Constitution. When it became known that the
</p>
<p>Convention had refused to submit the entire Constitution to a
</p>
<p>vote of the people for ratification or rejection, and had submit-
</p>
<p>ted only a proposition in regard to slavery, and that in a form
</p>
<p>and under a test oath which would prevent the Free State
</p>
<p>people from voting, there was great excitement in the Territo-
</p>
<p>ry, threatening bloodshed. Under these circumstances acting
</p>
<p>Governor Stanton called (Governor Walker had resigned) an
</p>
<p>extra session of the territorial Legislature. The Legislature

<p>" Being over ten thousand majority against the Lecompton

</p>
<p>Here we have, in brief, the whole story of the celebrated
</p>
<p>"Lecompton Constitution." It was born of a Convention ille-
</p>
<p>gally constituted, contained features repugnant to the sense of
</p>
<p>the people, was sought to be forced upon the people despite
</p>
<p>their wishes, but, when they came to vote squarely on it, the
</p>
<p>thing was rejected by the overwhelming majority of over ten
</p>
<p>thousand ! Yet, despite this emphatic expression, James Bu-
</p>
<p>chanan used his tremendous influence as President to constrain
</p>
<p>Congress to accept the repudiated instrument. One month
</p>
<p>after that contemptuous rejection of it by the people, to wit:
</p>
<p>on Feb. 2d, 1858, he transmitted the Lecompton instrument to
</p>
<p>CoDgress, accompanied by a carefully prepared and labored
</p>
<p>argument urging its acceptance. In that Executive endorse-
</p>
<p>ment the President assumed the office of patron to the pro-slave
</p>
<p>faction. His words were :
</p>
<p>" When we speak of the affairs of KansdS, we are apt to refer merely
</p>
<p>to the existence of two violent political parties in that Territory, divid-
</p>
<p>ed on the question of slavery, just as we speak of such parties in the
</p>
<p>States. This presents no adequate idea of the true state of the case.
</p>
<p>The dividing line there, is not between two political parties, both ac-
</p>
<p>knowledging the lawful existence of the Government, but between those
</p>
<p>who are loyal to this Government and those who have endeavored to

<p>destroy its existence by force and by usurpation  between those who
</p>
<p>sustain, and those who have done all in their power to overthrow, the
</p>
<p>Territorial Government established by Congress. This Government they
</p>
<p>would long since have subverted had it not been protected from their

<p>Buchanan's LIBELS. 509
</p>
<p>assaults by the trooiDs of the United States. Such has been the condi-
</p>
<p>tion of affairs since my inauguration. Ever since that j^eriod a large
</p>
<p>portion of the people of Kansas have been in a state of rebellion against
</p>
<p>the Government, with a military leader at their head, of most turbulent
</p>
<p>and dangerous character. They have never acknowledged, but have
</p>
<p>constantly renounced and defied, the Government to which they o^Ve
</p>
<p>allegiance, and have been all the time in a state of resistance against its
</p>
<p>authority. They have all the time been endeavoring to subvert it and to
</p>
<p>establish a revolutionary Government, under the so-called Topeka Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, in its stead. Even at this very moment, the Topeka Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture are in session. Whoever has read the correspondence of Governor
</p>
<p>Walker with the State Department, recently communicated to the Sen-
</p>
<p>ate, will be convinced that this picture is not overdrawn."
</p>
<p>All of wliich either was wilful prevarication of the truth, or
</p>
<p>a shocking misapprehension of the character of the Free State
</p>
<p>settlers' resistance. Thej proposed to subvert no just autho-
</p>
<p>rity, for, to call that territorial Assembly a "Government" was
</p>
<p>degradiag to the idea. Nor was the "revolutionary" Topeka
</p>
<p>movement illegal. It was a clearly constitutional assoeiation,
</p>
<p>and had a perfect right to memorialize Congress as an informal
</p>
<p>body-other than that it never had nor ever preferred any claims.
</p>
<p>The force in the field under Lane was composed of men resolv-
</p>
<p>ed, not upon revolution but upon obtaining order and rights
</p>
<p>guaranteed by the Organic act itself  the rights of actual set-
</p>
<p>tlers to make their own laws and to dictate the institutions of
</p>
<p>the new State. That this class of men thus libeled by the
</p>
<p>President constituted the immense majority of the people not
</p>
<p>only was proven by the vote of Jan. 4th, 1858, but by the suc-
</p>
<p>ceeding vote of Aug. 3d, 1858, referred to hereafter  evidence
</p>
<p>not to be gainsay ed. But, overwhelming as was this voice of
</p>
<p>the "squatter sovereigns," it failed to convince President, Cab-
</p>
<p>inet, and the Southern party in Congress, and Kansas was
</p>
<p>doomed to a further two years' struggle to obtain what was
</p>
<p>clearly her rights and for her best interests.

<p>One act of the Lecompton instrument as sent into the Senate
</p>
<p>for ratification was of four sections, as follows :
</p>
<p>"  1. The right of property is before and higher than any constitu-
</p>
<p>tional sanction, and the right of the owner of a slave to such a slave
</p>
<p>and its increase is the same, and is inviolable, as the right of the ovvner
</p>
<p>of any property whatever.
</p>

</p>
<p>510 THE KANSAS-NEBEASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>"  2. The Legislature shall have no power to pass laws for the eman-
</p>
<p>cipation of slaves without the consent of their owners, or without pay-
</p>
<p>ing their owners, previous to emancipation, a full equivalent in money
</p>
<p>for the slaves so emancipated. They shall have no power to prevent
</p>
<p>emigrants to the State from bringing with them such persons as are
</p>
<p>deemed slaves by the laws of any one of the United States or Territories
</p>
<p>so long as any persons of the same age or description shall be continued
</p>
<p>slaves by the laws of this State ; provided, that such ijerson or slave be
</p>
<p>the honajide property of such emigrant; and provided, also, that laws
</p>
<p>may be passed to prohibit the introduction of slaves into this State who
</p>
<p>have committed high crimes in other States or Territories. They shall
</p>
<p>have power to jjermit the owners of slaves to emancipate them, saving
</p>
<p>the rights of creditors, and jDreventing them from becoming a public
</p>
<p>charge. They shall have power to oblige the owners of slaves to treat
</p>
<p>them with humanity  to j^i'ovide for their necessary food and clothing
</p>
<p> to abstain from all injuries to them, extending to life or limb  and,
</p>
<p>in case of neglect or refusal to comply with the direction of such laws,
</p>
<p>to have such slave or slaves sold for the benefit of the owner or owners.
</p>
<p>"  3. In the prosecution of slaves for crimes of higher grade than petit
</p>
<p>larceny, the Legislature shall have no power to deprive them of an im-
</p>
<p>partial trial by a petit jury,
</p>
<p>"  4. Any person who shall dismember or deprive a slave of life shall
</p>
<p>suflFer such punishment as would be inflicted in case the like oifense had
</p>
<p>been committed on a free white person, and on the like proof, except in
</p>
<p>case of insurrection of such slave."
</p>
<p>It was this provision alone which the Convention resolved
</p>
<p>to submit to the registered voters, Dec. 21st, 1857, with the re-
</p>
<p>sult already chronicled. The reader will not fail to observe
</p>
<p>this feature of that election : the ballots were " Constitution
</p>
<p>with Slavery" and " Constitution with no Slavery"  a vote for
</p>
<p>either being, a vote to adopt the Constitution^ orHj rejecting, in
</p>
<p>the latter ballot, the sections in regard to slavery. By what
</p>
<p>process of reasoning could the Northern settlers be required to
</p>
<p>vote on that specially privileged occasion ? Yet, for not so

<p>voting, they were censured by the President as malcontents !
</p>
<p>The feature above adverted to was but one of several odious
</p>
<p>proscriptions of the Lecompton instrument. Provisions were
</p>
<p>inserted to render any possible Free State majority or vote
</p>
<p>powerless to change the "peculiar institution."
</p>
<p>This Constitution, as submitted by the President, was re-
</p>
<p>ported on favorably in the Senate, by the Committee on Ter-
</p>
<p>LECOMPTON BILL IN COITGIIESS. 511
</p>
<p>ritories, wlio introduced, Feb. ITth, an act known as the Le-
</p>
<p>compton bill, accepting the Constitution as submitted, defining
</p>
<p>the boundaries of the new State and giving it its apportionment
</p>
<p>in the House. This bill passed the Senate March 23d, 1858,
</p>
<p>by the vote thirty-three to twenty-five  Mr. Douglas voting in
</p>
<p>the negative. John J. Crittenden, of Kentucky, offered and
</p>
<p>pressed a substitute for the bill, providing in substance that the
</p>
<p>Constitution be submitted to the people at once, and, if ap-
</p>
<p>proved, the President to admit Kansas by proclamation. If
</p>
<p>rejected, the people to call a Convention and frame a Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, The substitute made special provision against frauds at
</p>
<p>the election.
</p>
<p>This was lost by a vote of yeas 24, nays 34 The bill as
</p>
<p>passed by the Senate was taken up in the House April 1st,
</p>
<p>when, after various efforts to strangle it, a substitute was of-
</p>
<p>fered similar in character and language with that submitted by
</p>
<p>Mr. Crittenden in the Senate. This was, finally, adopted, by
</p>
<p>a vote of 120 to 112. With this bill the Senate resolved at
</p>
<p>once (April 2d) to disagree, by a vote of 34 to 22. The House
</p>
<p>thereupon voted (April 7th) to adhere to its amendment, by
</p>
<p>the vote of 119 to 111. On the 13th of April the Senate voted
</p>
<p>to insist on its resolve to disagree, and asked for a committee
</p>
<p>of conference, by the vote 30 to 24. To this the House tried
</p>
<p>to reply by a second vote on adherence, with a call for the pre-
</p>
<p>vious question. This call was lost by the casting vote of the
</p>
<p>Speaker, when Mr. English, of Indiana, moved the appoint-
</p>
<p>ment of a committee of conference, calling the previous ques-
</p>
<p>tion on the motion. This prevailed by the casting vote of the
</p>
<p>Speaker. The conference was then accepted. It resulted in
</p>
<p>the adoption of a new scheme, submitting the Constitution to
</p>
<p>a direct vote of the people of Kansas, Aug. 3d, 1858, and pro-
</p>
<p>viding, if the Lecompton instrument was accepted^ very liberal

<p>512 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>the Lecompton Constitution. That election determined, beyond
</p>
<p>any question, the character and purposes of the vast majority
</p>
<p>of Kansas' inhabitants, and demonstrated to a certainty how
</p>
<p>meagre was the number of settlers and authorised voters who
</p>
<p>had, by the aid of Government bayonets, reigned in terror over
</p>
<p>the land. But even that expression failed to stay the hand of
</p>
<p>oppression in its design to make Kansas a Slave State, and in
</p>
<p>defiance of the promised rights guaranteed by the Organic Act,
</p>
<p>that immense majority was doomed to a further prolongation
</p>
<p>of the reign of ignorance and vice called the Lecompton Legis-
</p>
<p>lature.
</p>
<p>Governors were rapidly changed. Walker resigned in dis-
</p>
<p>gust and indignation in the Summer of 1858. His secretarj'-,
</p>
<p>Stanton, reigned a brief period only, to enter his most solemn
</p>
<p>protest against the Southern order of affairs. Denver assumed
</p>
<p>the oflEice to find it too much even for his faith in the Admin-
</p>
<p>istration. He was followed, in the Fall of 1858, by Samuel
</p>
<p>Medary, the "wheel horse" of Ohio Democracy, whose rule was
</p>
<p>a commingled record of folly and inefficiency. He was chosen
</p>
<p>to "sustain the Administration"  as if, in the face of an over-
</p>
<p>whelming Free State population, any Governor, or even Fede-
</p>
<p>ral bayonets could compel that population to accept the Le-
</p>
<p>compton reign ! During Denver's, and the first months of
</p>
<p>Medary's term of of&ce, intense excitement  prevailed in the
</p>
<p>Southern counties. ^ In the Summer of 1856 all Free State
</p>
<p>settlers were driven from that section, abandoning claims, cul-
</p>
<p>tivated fields and houses. These were seized and appropriated
</p>
<p>by the Missouri borderers. Becoming reassured by their great-
</p>
<p>ly increased numbers, the Northern immigrants, during the
</p>
<p>Summer following, began to return to their old possessions, to
</p>
<p>find them tenanted by Missourians. They resolved to settle
</p>
<p>upon their original claims and then to submit their squatter
</p>
<p>rights to the Land Ofiice for decision. Seeing this, and deter-
</p>

<p>counties  for, once there, what should prevent the " Yankees"
</p>
<p>from swarming over into the fine domain of the Indian Terri-
</p>
<p>tory ?  the Southern men conspired for a second stand against
</p>
<p>their free soil emigration. Fort Scott was used as headquarters,

<p>Montgomery's opTiiRATiONS. 513
</p>
<p>from which, and the countrj adjacent, sallied parties who com-
</p>
<p>mitted atrocities of the most cold blooded nature. Cattle and
</p>
<p>other property were first stolen to provoke an outbreak, when,
</p>
<p>under the old dodge of writs from " the authorities," Federal
</p>
<p>bayonets could be called into requisition to enforce the South-
</p>
<p>ern  programme. All this worked auspiciously for awhile.
</p>
<p>But, a " Free State Squatter Court" organized early in Novem-
</p>
<p>ber, whose summary justice sent terror into the pro-slave ranks.
</p>
<p>A deputy U. S. Marshal, with a strong jposse^ essayed to break
</p>
<p>up the court, but was repulsed ; when the United States forct^s
</p>
<p>were ordered out by Governor Denver to assist in suppressing
</p>
<p>the 'illegal and riotous combination.' At this call Lane again
</p>
<p>took the field, and, for a moment there threatened a decisive
</p>
<p>civil war. This attitude of the Free State men alarmed both
</p>
<p>the Governor and the Missourians, and no attempt was made
</p>
<p>to enforce any Fort Scott processes of arrest or ejectment. A
</p>
<p>bitter partisan war followed, and Captain James Montgomery
</p>
<p>entered the service to catch and punish any Missouri assassin
</p>
<p>prowling around the settlement. Several shocking murders
</p>
<p>occurred during the Winter of 1857-8, perpetrated by bands
</p>
<p>led, in some instances, by members of the Lecompton Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture. Montgomery succeeded in securing several of these ban-
</p>
<p>dits, and, it is said, made short work of them. He was, at
</p>
<p>length, pursued (in April, 1858) by a body of dragoons from
</p>
<p>the Fort. These, with eight sharp shooters, he repulsed, kill-
</p>
<p>ing one and wounding five. Governor Denver then again de-
</p>
<p>termined to " suppress" the guerilla, and dispatched a messen-
</p>
<p>ger to the Fort to arrange plans for Montgomery's capture.
</p>
<p>This was answered satisfactorily, by the officer in command,
</p>
<p>and the messenger started on his return, bearing a letter de-
</p>
<p>tailing arrangements for the capture. This unluckily fell
</p>
<p>into Montgomery's hands. He opened the epistle and reen-
</p>
<p>closed it, accompanied by a note to the Governor, stating that
</p>
<p>he had only to protect Free State settlers in their rights

<p>and their peace to secure his withdrawal from the field  that,
</p>
<p>until such time, he would not permit his band to be dissolved.

</p>
<p>entered the Territory at tlie head of twentj-five men, passed to
</p>
<p>the settlements on the creek, seized eleven settlers, took them
</p>
<p>into a retired spot, formed them into a line and shot them.
</p>
<p>Five were killed, five wounded and one escaped by feigning
</p>
<p>death. The ruffians retired, unmolested, from their deed of
</p>
<p>blood ; nor was any action ever taken in the matter by Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor or President. This aroused a feeling of intense animosi-
</p>
<p>ty in the breasts of Northern men. Captain Montgomery
</p>
<p>found his strength fully equal to any, emergency, but no action
</p>
<p>for retaliation followed. Governor Denver, alarmed for the
</p>
<p>peace of the Territory, hastened to Montgomery's quarters, and,
</p>
<p>through the co-operation of Free State men, induced the
</p>
<p>Captain to sign a treaty of amnesty, in which it was agreed
</p>
<p>tliat the past should be forgotten  that all obnoxious officers
</p>
<p>should be removed, all processes destroyed, and no more dis-
</p>
<p>turbance permitted. All of which, for a while, seemed to an-
</p>
<p>swer a good purpose. Montgr.nv^ ' men return ed to their
</p>
<p>homes ; the Captain himself worked his farm in peace. But,
</p>
<p>in October the slave power broke out anew. lA court assem-
</p>
<p>bled at Fort Scott found a jury to indict the Captain and a
</p>
<p>number of his men. A reign of violence ensued. With a
</p>
<p>resolution characteristic of the times, Montgomery gathered a
</p>
<p>party of resolute followers, proceeded to the fort, seized court
</p>
<p>and jury, burned the indictments and thus ended that tribunal
</p>
<p>of territorial dignitaries. The settlements were once again
</p>
<p>under arms. Marauders from Missouri came in, eager for
</p>
<p>plunder and still anxious to "wipe out the abolitionists." Old
</p>
<p>John Brown took the field and fortified several good positions
</p>
<p>on the Little Osage river and the Little Sugar creek, not far

</p>
<p>for both Brown and Montgomery were absent from tlieir quar-
</p>
<p>ters when the descent was made.
</p>
<p>One of the latter's men was seized and imprisoned in Fort
</p>
<p>Scott. Dec. 16th, Montgomery, with one hundred and fifty
</p>
<p>followers, made his sudden appearance at the fort and released
</p>
<p>the Free State partisan. This act greatly incensed the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor. He ordered down from Fort Leavenworth four compa-
</p>
<p>nies of dragoons, and called into the field four companies of
</p>
<p>independent militia. '\ These assembled at Fort Scott. A largo
</p>
<p>body of Missourians gathered on the border ready to co-operate
</p>
<p>in the threatened arrest of every Free State man found in arms
</p>
<p>or who had participated in the rescue of Montgomery's man.
</p>
<p>Thus matters indeed looked serious, for, both guerilla Cap-
</p>
<p>tains were resolved to fight to the last. Suddenly, dispatch-
</p>
<p>es arrived from Washington, ordering a recal of the troops.
</p>
<p>The dragoons returned to Leavenworth, while the militia dis-
</p>
<p>banded. But, a body of Missourians having taken possession
</p>
<p>of the house of a blacksmith named Snyder, near the scene of
</p>
<p>the Marais des Cygnes butchery, the owner of the cabin fell
</p>
<p>upon it; the Missourians refused to surrender and opened fire
</p>
<p>on the Free State party. Snyder set fire to the premises and
</p>
<p>four of the inmates were consumed.
</p>
<p>John Brown, watching the still powerful body of Missouri-
</p>
<p>ans assembled at Falls' store, only eight miles from his quarters
</p>
<p>in Bourbon county, now performed an act which, at the time,
</p>
<p>created more of a sensation than any event of the year  'firing
</p>
<p>the Southern heart' to a degree of eruptive fury. He invaded
</p>
<p>Missouri and ran off the slaves of two plantations. His story
</p>
<p>of the liberation we may repeat :
</p>
<p>" On Sunday, December 19, a negro man called Jim came over to tlie
</p>
<p>Osage settlement, from Missouri, and stated that he, together -witli
</p>
<p>his wife, two children and auotlier negro man, was to be sold within a
</p>
<p>day or two, and begged for help to get away. On Monday, (the follow-
</p>
<p>ing) night, two small companies were made up to go to Missouri and

<p>forcibly liberate the five slaves, togethes with other slaves. One of these
</p>
<p>companies I assumed to direct. We proceeded to the place, surrounded
</p>
<p>the buildings, liberated the slaves, and also took certain jJroperty sup-
</p>
<p>posed to belong to tlie estate.
</p>
<p>" We, however, learned, before leaving, that a portion of the articles
</p>
<p>516 THE KANSAS-NEBEASKA STRUGGLE.
</p>
<p>we had tiken belonged to a man living on the plantation, as a tenant,
</p>
<p>and who was supposed to have no interest in the estate. We promptly
</p>
<p>returned to him all we had taken. "We then went to another plantation,
</p>
<p>where we found five more slaves, took some property and two white
</p>
<p>men. We moved all slowly away into the Territory for some distance,
</p>
<p>and then sent the white men back, telling them to follow us as soon as
</p>
<p>they chose to do so. The other company freed one female slave, took
</p>
<p>some property, and, as I am informed, killed one white man (the mas-
</p>
<p>ter), who fought against the liberation."
</p>
<p>The old campaigner thereupon instituted " a parallel," re-
</p>
<p>calling the Marais des Cygnes massacre, in these significant
</p>
<p>terms :
</p>
<p>"Eleven persons are forcibly restored to their natural and inaliesiable
</p>
<p>rights, with but one man killed, and all ' hell is stirred from beneath.'
</p>
<p>It is currently reported that the Governor of Missouri has made a re-
</p>
<p>quisition upon the Governor of Kansas for the delivery of all such as
</p>
<p>were concerned in the last-named ' dreadful outrage.' The Marshal of
</p>
<p>Kansas is said to be collecting a posse of Missouri (not Kansas) men at
</p>
<p>West Point, in Missouri, a little town about ten miles distant, to ' enforce
</p>
<p>the laws.' All pro-slavery, conservative Free State and doughface men,
</p>
<p>and Administi-ation tools, are filled with holy horror,"
</p>
<p>The panic which followed this invasion was ridiculous, con-
</p>
<p>sidering its provocation. A general stampede of slaves was
</p>
<p>apprehended; consequently the two counties of Bates and
</p>
<p>Vernon were soon quite cleared of their " chattels," which were
</p>
<p>sent into the interior or shipped to the South for sale. Brown,
</p>
<p>however, made no further "reprisals," but proceeded at once
</p>
<p>to remove his colored colony to Canada. The Governor of
</p>
<p>Missouri offered a reward of three thousand dollars for his ar-
</p>
<p>rest  a sum afterwards increased by the President by an ad-
</p>
<p>ditional reward of two hundred and fifty dollars. Proceeding
</p>
<p>north by way of Lawrence, Brown left that place Jan. 20th,
</p>
<p>en route for Canada through Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Mich-
</p>
<p>igan  all of which States he traversed with his body guard.

<p>Though closely followed by men thirsting for his blood, as well
</p>
<p>as eager for the rewards, his slow march over the States was
</p>
<p>unimpeded  it was like a little triumphal procession. The
</p>
<p>negroes were safely delivered into Victoria's dominions and

<p>became thriving settlers."

<p>This act was the finishing blow to Missouri violence. John

<p>Brown evidently had calculated results wlien he made the re-
</p>
<p>prisal. Frightened for the future security of their " property,"
</p>
<p>the pro-slave borderers became suddenly peaceful, anxious to
</p>
<p>recover the good will of their too-evidently invincible oppo-
</p>
<p>nents, and bearing, with as good a grace as possible, the unpal-
</p>
<p>atable fortune of a Free State on their western border. An
</p>
<p>"Amnesty Act" was adopted, pardoning all " political offenses ;"
</p>
<p>the Governor proclaimed it, and peace dwelt permanently in
</p>
<p>those fair domains.
</p>
<p>We approach the end of this most painful chapter in our
</p>
<p>National history. The election of August, 3d, 1858, was so
</p>
<p>emphatic a protest against minority reign that only the form
</p>
<p>of electing members to that territorial body was necessary to
</p>
<p>secure in it a majority of Free State representatives. This
</p>
<p>being gained, steps at once could be taken for a new State
</p>
<p>Constitutional Convention, to repudiate the past, and to offer
</p>
<p>to Congress such an instrument as it could not, in good faith,
</p>
<p>reject. At the succeeding election, therefore, for assemblymen,
</p>
<p>the Free State men participated and elected members enough
</p>
<p>to override the Missouri intruders. An act was passed (Feb.
</p>
<p>11th, 1859) "to refer the question to the people of a new Con-
</p>
<p>stitutional Convention, the election to be held on the first
</p>
<p>Tuesday in March, 1859. The election was held, and resulted
</p>
<p>in a majority of 3881 in favor of a Convention." This result
</p>
<p>being ascertained, the Governor issued his proclamation for an
</p>
<p>election of delegates. The old party organizations were now
</p>
<p>abandoned, and those of Kepublicans and Democrats substi-
</p>
<p>tuted, and it was on this basis that the canvass for the election
</p>
<p>of delegates proceeded. The Convention was to consist of
</p>
<p>fifty-two delegates. The Democrats proclaimed themselves
</p>
<p>disciples of Mr. Douglas and his Territorial Sovereignty doc-
</p>
<p>trine, and decidedly opposed to making Kansas a Slave State.

<p>which from its population was entitled to ten delegates  elect-
</p>
<p>ed the Democratic ticket, 'not, however, without the aid of
</p>
<p>fraudulent votes. But the Eepublicans, by their predominance

</p>
<p>518 THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE '
</p>
<p>in otlier parts of the Territory, succeeded in securing a majori-
</p>
<p>ty in the Convention of thirty-five to seventeen."
</p>
<p>This Convention met at Wyandot July 5th, and continued
</p>
<p>in session twenty-two days. The debates were somewhat ac-
</p>
<p>rimonious, owing to efforts of the "opposition" to absorb as
</p>
<p>much of Nebraslia as lay south of the Platte river, and for in-
</p>
<p>cluding within the lines, on the west, all the Pike's Peak re-
</p>
<p>gion. Being composed exclusively of Democrats, the opposi-
</p>
<p>tion also sought to engraft a provision in the Constitution ex-
</p>
<p>cluding free negroes from the State, and also to prohibit all
</p>
<p>bank issues. But, the Free State (Eepublican) majority was
</p>
<p>too great. The Constitution, adopted by a vote of 84 to 13,
</p>
<p>was a straight-forward, democratic affair, embodying the best
</p>
<p>features of the organic laws of the older States. To it was
</p>
<p>prefixed a bill of rights which included a prohibition of Slavery
</p>
<p>and made competent for testimony before the courts of persons
</p>
<p>of any religious belief
</p>
<p>This instrument was submitted to a vote of the people on
</p>
<p>the first Tuesday in October following. The result was its
</p>
<p>ratification by over four thousand majority. An election for
</p>
<p>members of the Territorial Legislature transpired in November,
</p>
<p>when the Free State men elected, the delegate to Congress and
</p>
<p>a majority of the Legislators. This latter election was regard-
</p>
<p>ed as but a mere form, for it was expected that Congress would
</p>
<p>accept the Wyandot Constitution at an early moment. An
</p>
<p>election for State ofiicers was held Dec. 6th, 1859, which re-
</p>
<p>sulted in the choice of an entire Free State (Eepublican) ticket,
</p>
<p>on which stood Dr. Charles Eobinson for Governor, and M. F.
</p>
<p>Conway for Congress. The Legislature chosen was largely
</p>
<p>Eepublican.
</p>
<p>The Constitution was accepted, by the House of Congress,
</p>
<p>April 11th, 1860, by a vote of 174 to 73  the Southern mem-
</p>
<p>bers and a few Northern "Democrats" voting against it. But,
</p>
<p>in the pro-slave Senate the acceptance was resisted success-

<p>fully. Mr. Seward (Feb. 21st, 1860), from the Committee on
</p>
<p>Territories, introduced the House bill for the admission of Kan-
</p>
<p>sas under the Wyandot Constitution. The matter lay over to
</p>
<p>June 5th, when it came up in its order. It was opposed by

</p>

</p>
<p>party vote, only two Northern Democrats being among the
</p>
<p>nays. June 7th, Mr. Wade, of Ohio, again moved to take up
</p>
<p>the bill, but, the motion was lost by the same vote as above ;
</p>
<p>and Congress adjourned leaving Kansas still a Territory.
</p>
<p>Thus, the Senate, which had repealed the time honored
</p>
<p>Compromise Act of 1822 in order to open the Western Terri-
</p>
<p>tories for competition in their settlement, refused to receive
</p>
<p>Kansas with a Constitution prohibiting S\r.very. Putting the
</p>
<p>first and last acts together, and throwing in as incidental testi-
</p>
<p>mony the extraordinary efforts mafle by two Administrations
</p>
<p>to fasten the Lecompton laws upor Kansas, we have irrefragi-
</p>
<p>ble proof of the collusion of Northern men with the South for
</p>
<p>the purpose of Slavery extension. This is now the historic
</p>
<p>verdict, unpalatable as it may be to those who co-operated
</p>
<p>with Mr. Toombs in his crusade against any restrictions to
</p>
<p>Slavery [See letter of Toombs, quoted on page 457, foot note].
</p>
<p>It was not until the session of 1860-61 when the Senate, by
</p>
<p>the secession of Southern members, permitted Kansas to enter
</p>
<p>the Union. During January, in the midst of extraordinary
</p>
<p>events transpiring in Congress and in the Southern States, the 
</p>
<p>friends of Kansas pressed the bill for its' admission to its suc-
</p>
<p>cessful passage. The Territory became a State, by approval
</p>
<p>of the President, January 29th, 1861, and Kansas soon
</p>
<p>was a commonwealth, as remarked for its loyalty to the
</p>
<p>General Government as for its fortitude under the awful vis-
</p>
<p>itations of those who had failed to make her a slave pen, and
</p>
<p>who gravitated toward the " Confederate" cause as naturally as

<p>THE CONSPIRACY OF JOM BROWN.
</p>
<p>The attempt of John Brown to excite a servile insurrection
</p>
<p>in Virginia was a revival of Nat Turner's scheme of a Negra
</p>
<p>independency in the South. It was not, as generally reported
</p>
<p>at the time of his arrest, trial and execution, a mere plan to
</p>
<p>run off slaves to Canada. The old man was, as we shall show,
</p>
<p>no " chattel thief" of this sort. His plans rather embraced a
</p>
<p>heavy accession from Canada of able bodied and resolute ne-
</p>
<p>groes to form the mountain army of his contemplated perma-
</p>
<p>nent occupation. There was a wildness in the conception
</p>
<p>which savored of insanity ; but, the plan was not conceived in
</p>
<p>a moment of frenzy  it was the matured enterprise of several
</p>
<p>years of thought and of much conference with certain emi-
</p>
<p>nent abolitionists. If it failed, and ended in the execution of
</p>
<p>all who survived the first conflict, it was, 1st, because, as in
</p>
<p>Nat Turner's case, the slaves did not rally to his call, and 2d,
</p>
<p>because he had underestimated the odds against him. Had
</p>
<p>the first stroke been successful he might have maintained
</p>
<p>hold upon Virginia soil. News of this success would have
</p>
<p>impelled great numbers of slaves and free negroes to his stand-
</p>
<p>ard ; accessions would have passed in from the North both of
</p>
<p>whites and free negroes, and thus his dream would have been
</p>
<p>realized of a liberating army too strong to be driven out yet
</p>
<p>too dangerous to be permitted to remain. Then would have
</p>
<p>followed the conflict which the old man counted on as neces-
</p>
<p>sary to spread the spirit of revolt among the plantations, and
</p>
<p>his beacon fires would have been lit along the Alleghanies from

</p>
<p>522 THE CONSPIEACY OF JOHN BROWN.
</p>
<p>swarms of black humanity whicli must answer to his call.
</p>
<p>The first stroke was a disaster with which fell a scheme that
</p>
<p>Federal arms alone could have suppressed.
</p>
<p>As early as the year 1839 John Brown had determined upon
</p>
<p>this slave insurrection, as we are expressly informed by his
</p>
<p>accredited biographer, Eedpath, who states :
</p>
<p>" It was in 1839 that he conceived the idea of becoming a Liberator
</p>
<p>of the Southern slaves. He had seen, during the twenty-five years that
</p>
<p>had elapsed since he became an abolitionist, every right of human na-
</p>
<p>ture, and of the Northern States, ruthlessly trodden under the feet of the
</p>
<p>tyrannical slave power. He saw it blighting and blasting the manhood
</p>
<p>of the nation ; and he listened to ' the voice of the poor that cried.' He
</p>
<p>heard Lafayette loudly praised, but he saw no helper of the bondman.
</p>
<p>He saw the peoj)le building the sepulchres of the fathers of '76, but
</p>
<p>lynching and murdering the prophets that were sent unto them. He
</p>
<p>believed that :
</p>
<p>' Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow.'
</p>
<p>But the slaves, scattered, closely watched, prevented from assembling
</p>
<p>to conspire, without arms, apparently overpowered, at the mercy of
</p>
<p>every traitor, knowing the white man only as their foe, seeing every
</p>
<p>where and always, that (as the Haytian proverb pithily expresses it,)
</p>
<p>' Zie Mane, ioidlle negues''  the eyes of the whites burn up the negroes 
</p>
<p>in order to arise and strike a blow for liberty, needed a positive sign
</p>
<p>that they had friends among the dominant race, who sympathized with
</p>
<p>them, believed in their right to freedom, and were ready to aid them in
</p>
<p>their attempt to obtain it, John Brown determined to let them know
</p>
<p>that they had friends, and prepcired himself to lead them to libertj'.
</p>
<p>From the moment that he formed this resolution, he engaged in no
</p>
<p>commercial speculations, which he could not, without loss to his friends
</p>
<p>and family, wind up in fourteen days. He waited patiently, ' Learn
</p>
<p>TO "Wait : I have waited twenty years,' he often said to the young men
</p>
<p>of principle and talent, who loved and flocked around him when in

<p>limited degree. He had age to render him venerable yet his
</p>
<p>frame was capable of great endurance. All were mastered by
</p>
<p>the deep devotion to an idea, or rather to a principle  that of
</p>
<p>war against human slavery. This principle was the compass
</p>
<p>of his life ; it rankled in his soul like a subterranean fire ; it
</p>
<p>impregnated his religion, his politics, his relations to man ; it
</p>
<p>was his Golden Rule and his sword of flame. Men called him
</p>
<p>a monomaniac ; but his mania was identical with that which
</p>
<p>sways the actions of all intense natures. Luther, Melancthon,
</p>
<p>Peter the Hermit, Savonarolla, Joan d'Arc, Cromwell, were
</p>
<p>monomaniacs ; but, unlike these. Brown was not a man of
</p>
<p>powerful intellectual perceptions; he was an irreconcilable
</p>
<p>zealot, possessed neither of a statesman's powers nor of a poli-
</p>
<p>tician's discretion. He occupies a place in history beside the
</p>
<p>religious enthusiast, Nat Turner, rather than an association
</p>
<p>with those named above. His admirers have exalted him to
</p>
<p>the Yalhalla of the Great ; a few New England idealists have
</p>
<p>classed him with that rare race of individuals of whom one oc-
</p>
<p>casionally appears to impersonate the revolutionary idea
</p>
<p>which marks the progress of human events toward perfect
</p>
<p>order ; lasting honor has crowned his career by embalming
</p>
<p>his memory in the rude lyric which moves men and masses
</p>
<p>like an inspiration : *

<p>John Brown's body lies mouldering in the grave,

<p>Glory, glory hallelujah,

<p>Glory, glory hallelujah.
</p>
<p>His soul is marching on.

<p>immortal from their interpretation of national emotion, it seems to have taken
</p>
<p>form insensibly, as the utterance of feeling otherwise unutterable. The sublime
</p>
<p>cadences of that wild song, chaunted by whole divisions, were the inspiration of
</p>
<p>the " Army of the Union" when it went into battle. No battle anthem ever so
</p>
<p>stirred men up to deeds of greatness. The leaders of the Union army acknowledge
</p>
<p>its superhuman power for inspiriting the ranks. One of the most eminent of De-
</p>
<p>partment commanders has said that that song " made heroes of all his men."

</p>
<p>But, considering his entire character and career, we at-
</p>
<p>tribute his posthumous fame less to any true greatness of his
</p>
<p>nature than to the fact that his " martyrdom" was rapidly fol-
</p>
<p>lowed by, if it did not, indeed, hasten, the shot on Sumter's
</p>
<p>walls. In some indefinable manner the Southern Eebellion
</p>
<p>came to be regarded as a fulfilment of his prophecies. He,
</p>
<p>hence, became a Jeremiah, who, though dead in the body, still
</p>
<p>lived in the hearts of the people : " his soul is marching on,"
</p>
<p>was but the refrain of the grand emotion swelling and surging
</p>
<p>in the popular breast.
</p>
<p>Brown's Kansas experiences doubtless served to confirm his
</p>
<p>purposes in regard to a slave insurrection. He there received
</p>
<p>new impressions regarding the baleful effects of the institution
</p>
<p>upon whites as well as blacks. The men who represented
</p>
<p>' Southern interests' and clamored lustily for ^ slavery were
</p>
<p>vicious and dissolute to a degree almost incomprehensible to a
</p>
<p>Northern mind. His impressions were much intensified by

<p>seeing and knoiving these men, and he returned from Kansas
</p>
<p>to the East late in the Fall of I806 to impart to the ' friends
</p>
<p>of freedom' what he had learned, as well as to perfect arrange-
</p>
<p>ments for the deliverance of the Territory from the grasp of
</p>
<p>the ' enemies of man.' During the Winter following he visited
</p>
<p>many places and addressed large audiences convened to hear
</p>
<p>the story of his experiences. Everywhere he made a profound
</p>
<p>WAS HE DEMENTED? 526
</p>
<p>impression, althougli a large class conceived him a dangerous,
</p>
<p>because an "incendiary", character. Said a leading free soil
</p>
<p>paper in Cleveland, Ohio, on the occasion of his visit to that
</p>
<p>place :
</p>
<p>" He M'as so demented as to suppose he could raise a regiment of men
</p>
<p>in Ohio to march into Missouri to make reprisals against the slave
</p>
<p>forces, and even asked a friend if the power of the State could not
</p>
<p>be enlisted in that matter. He was then told by many that he was
</p>
<p>a madman, and the poor man left, sorrowing that there was no sym-
</p>
<p>pathy here for the oppressed."
</p>
<p>And his own half-brother, a well-to-do farmer and a person
</p>
<p>of intelligence, regarded him as demented. He said  writing
</p>
<p>after the fatal termination of the Harper's Ferry emcufe:
</p>
<p>" After his return to Kansas he called on me, and I urged him to go
</p>
<p>home to his family and attend to his private affairs ; that [ feared his
</p>
<p>course would prove his destruction and that of his boys. This was
</p>
<p>about two years ago. He replied that he was sorry that I did not
</p>
<p>sympathize with him ; that he knew he was in the line of his duty,
</p>
<p>and he must pursue it, though it should destroy him and his family.
</p>
<p>He stated to me that he was satisfied that he was a chosen instrument
</p>
<p>in the hands of God to war against slavery. From his manner and from
</p>
<p>his conversation at this time, I had no doubt he had become insane
</p>
<p>upon the subject of slavery, and gave him to understand this was my
</p>
<p>opinion of him."
</p>
<p>But, he was not demented. He was, on the contrary, very
</p>
<p>clear headed. He saw things with a vision different from those
</p>
<p>around him ; and he was too self-denying, too persistent, to let
</p>
<p>any consideration move him from his conceived path of duty.
</p>
<p>Such men are rare in these days of mammon worship ; yet, are
</p>
<p>numerous enough to vitalize the great crust of society and
</p>
<p>keep it from settling down into the dull, heavy, mass which
</p>
<p>presages social dyspepsia. He was neither insane nor imprac-
</p>
<p>tical ; rather he was eminently rational and methodical. His

<p>conduct proves nothing against his sanity save that he loathed
</p>
<p>slavery with a sublime sense of dislike ; and the future, what-
</p>
<p>ever may be the legal verdict upon his career, will not cease
</p>
<p>to admire the soul which could press on to its conceived mis-
</p>
<p>sion with such patient reliance upon the idea that moved him.'

<p>526 THE CONSPIRACY OF JOHN BROWN. "^
</p>
<p>When in Boston, during January, 1857, he said: "I believe
</p>
<p>in the Golden Eule and the Declaration of Independence. I
</p>
<p>think they both mean the same thing ; and it is better that a
</p>
<p>whole generation should pass off the face of the earth  men,
</p>
<p>women and children  by a violent death, than that one jot of
</p>
<p>either should fail in this country."
</p>
<p>This was his idea, and he pursued it to the gallows. "Was
</p>
<p>he insane for entertaining it?
</p>
<p>In this visit to the East it is known that Brown conferred
</p>
<p>with leading abolitionists regarding his proposed descent on
</p>
<p>Virginia and received so much encouragement as to ai-range,
</p>
<p>somewhat definitively, for his long-contemplated crusade. He
</p>
<p>failed, however, to obtain funds, and returned to Kansas in the
</p>
<p>Summer of 1857 to form the nucleus of his liberating host.
</p>
<p>He there met by agreement Colonel Hugh Forbes, an English
</p>
<p>adventurer who had participated in the Hungarian and Italian
</p>
<p>revolutions, and had a good knowledge of Garabaldi's system
</p>
<p>of guerilla warfare. Brown sought to call around him those
</p>
<p>young men whom he already had tried and found ' true as steel,'
</p>
<p>though it would seem that some of the men were not informed
</p>
<p>as to the ultimate object of their organization. Want of means
</p>
<p>restricted movements so much that Brown retired to the "abo-
</p>
<p>lition" village of Tabor, in Iowa, where he remained from Au-
</p>
<p>gust to November, when Colonel Forbes abandoned the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy for reasons variously stated. He afterwards became
</p>
<p>an informer against Biown, and compelled the temporary sus-
</p>
<p>pension of the plot in 1858.
</p>
<p>In the Spring of 1858 the company, composed of nine, start-
</p>
<p>led from Tabor, for the East, taking with them considerable
</p>
<p>timate design of their arrest and extradition to Virginia for trial. He closely and
</p>
<p>cruelly pressed the old man, as he lay wounded on the floor of the guard house,
</p>
<p>but learned not a word to use as evidence against his political antagonists whom
</p>
<p>he hoped to see in Virginia dungeons. After his inquisition he wrote :

<p>" It is in vain to underrate either the man or the conspiracy. Captain John
</p>
<p>Brown is as brave and resolute a man as ever headed an insurrection, and in a good
</p>
<p>cause, and with a sufficient force, would have been a consummate partisan com-
</p>
<p>mander. He has coolne<f, daring persistency, the stoic faith and patience, and a
</p>
<p>firnuK-ss of will and purpose unconquerable. He is the farthest possible remove
</p>
<p>from the ordinary ruffian, fanatic or madman. Certainly it was one of the beat
</p>
<p>plamied and best exeouied conspiracies that ever failed."
</p>
<p>THE CHATHAM CONVENTION. 627
</p>
<p>stores, arms and ammunition, wliicli Brown and his friends
</p>
<p>had gathered. The arms consisted of about two hundred
</p>
<p>Sharpe's rifles and the same number of navy revolvers. These
</p>
<p>were transported to Ashtabula county, Ohio, thence to be
</p>
<p>borne, at the proper moment, to the rendezvous near Harper's
</p>
<p>Ferry.
</p>
<p>From Ohio Brown passed over into Canada West, where
</p>
<p>a preconcerted convention was held May 8th, 1858. This con-
</p>
<p>vocation was an important feature in the conspiracy. Its gen--
</p>
<p>eral nature and action were thus referred to by Cook, oae of
</p>
<p>the Conspirators afterwards caught and hanged by the Virgi-
</p>
<p>nians. In his confession he stated :
</p>
<p>" The place of naeeting was in one of the negro churches in Chatham.
</p>
<p>The convention, I think, was called to order by J. H. Kagi. Its object
</p>
<p>was then stated, which was to complete a thorough organization and the
</p>
<p>formation of a Constitution. The first business was to elect a President
</p>
<p>and Secretary. Elder Monroe, a colored minister, was elected President,
</p>
<p>and J. H. Kagi, Secretary. The next business was to form a Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion. Captain Brown had already drawn up one, which, on motion, was
</p>
<p>read by the Secretary. On motion it was ordered that each article of
</p>
<p>the Constitution be taken up, and separately amended and passed,
</p>
<p>which was done. On motion, the Constitution was then adopted as a
</p>
<p>whole. The next business was to nominate a Commander-in-Chief,
</p>
<p>Secretary of War, and Secretary of State. Captain John Brown was
</p>
<p>unanimously elected Commander-in-Chief, J. H. Kagi, Secretary of War,
</p>
<p>and Richard Realf, Secretary of State. Elder Monroe was to act as
</p>
<p>President until another was chosen. A. M. Chapman, I think, was to
</p>
<p>act as Vice President. Dr. M. K. Delaney was one of the Corresponding
</p>
<p>Secretaries of the Organization. There were some others from the Unit-
</p>
<p>ed States, whose names I do not now remember. Most of the delegates
</p>
<p>to the Convention were from Canada. After the Constitution was
</p>
<p>adopted, the members took their oath to support it. It was then signed
</p>
<p>by all present. During the interval between the call for the Convention

<p>and its assembling, regular meetings were held at Barbour's Hotel,
</p>
<p>where we were stopping, by those who were known to be true to the
</p>
<p>cause, at which meetings plans were laid and discussed. There were no
</p>
<p>white men at the Convention, save the members of our company. Men
</p>
<p>and money had both been promised from Chatham and other parts of
</p>
<p>Canada. When the Convention broke up, news was received that Col.
</p>
<p>H. Forbes, who had joined in the movement, had given information to
</p>
<p>the Government. This, of course delayed the time of attack. A day or
</p>
<p>two afterwards most of our party took the boat to Cleveland J. BL

</p>
<p>Kagi, Richard Realf, William H. Leemaii, Richard Robertson and Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Brown remaining. Captain Brown, however, started in a day or
</p>
<p>two for the East. Kagi, I think, went to some other town in Canada
</p>
<p>to set up the type and to get the Constitution jsrinted, which he com-
</p>
<p>pleted before he returned to Cleveland. We remained in Cleveland
</p>
<p>for some weeks, at which place, for the time being, the company dis-
</p>
<p>banded."
</p>
<p>Among the papers of Brown found at Harper's Ferry were
</p>
<p>minutes of the proceedings of this Convention, a list of its
</p>
<p>members, and copies of the "Constitution" as adopted. [See
</p>
<p>Appendix for so much of this instrument as the Virginia au-
</p>
<p>thorities permitted to be published.] But, there is yet much
</p>
<p>mystery concerning the affair. The Constitution itself was a
</p>
<p>queer document, judged by the light thus far shed upon it. It
</p>
<p>is probable, however, the conspiracy was but half unfolded 
</p>
<p>that the movement which miscarried at its first stroke, was one
</p>
<p>planned for ultimate results of an extended political as well as
</p>
<p>social nature. If further developements shall be made  as is
</p>
<p>not likely  what now in the Constitution and in Brown's pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings appear singular will assume at least an air of con-
</p>
<p>sistency.
</p>
<p>After the Chatham gathering it was not Brown's design to
</p>
<p>repair to Kansas, but, at once, to direct his steps to Harper's
</p>
<p>Ferry. The discovery of Forbes' defection and revelations
</p>
<p>to the President of the United States regarding the perfected
</p>
<p>plans of the "Liberators," compelled a change in their pro-
</p>
<p>gramma. Aside from this defection, when the moment lor
</p>
<p>action came Brown found that numerous friends, in the East
</p>
<p>and in Ohio, failed to come forward with their promised means.
</p>
<p>He went East, from Cleveland, during May, to confer with
</p>
<p>some of these friends, and then hastened to Kansas, having
</p>
<p>first dispatched Cook to Harper's Ferry to reconnoitre, to indi-
</p>
<p>cate depots for arms, and to report  all of which he did. The

<p>horrible massacre of ten Free State men on the Marais-des-
</p>
<p>Cygnes creek, in May, 1858, aroused all the lion in Brown's
</p>
<p>soul, and. he again repaired to Kansas to enlist in its defense.
</p>
<p>His proceedings there are detailed in the preceding article. He
</p>
<p>literally "carried the war into Africa," and struck the blow
</p>
<p>which ended all further Missouri raids over the border. The
</p>
<p>brown's second visit to the east. 529
</p>
<p>forcible abstraction by "him, of eleven slaves, from Missouri
</p>
<p>soil  the march to Detroit, Michigan, with liis prize, defying
</p>
<p>not only all pursuers but even tlie Fugitive Slave law and the
</p>
<p>United States authority, illustrates tbe resolution and the sym-
</p>
<p>pathies of the man. He safely delivered the slaves at Windsor.
</p>
<p>The moment then seemed to have arrived for the initiation
</p>
<p>of his schemes. He therefore earnestly set about gathering
</p>
<p>material resour(?es for his anti-slave crusade. From March to
</p>
<p>midsummer he pressed his arrangements so secretly and so
</p>
<p>successfully as to excite not a ripple of alarm among the op-
</p>
<p>ponents of his enterprise, who, at that time, comprised nine-
</p>
<p>teen-twentieths of the people. Yet, he did not proceed in dis-
</p>
<p>guise. Late in March he appeared, in company with his intel-
</p>
<p>ligent and devoted confederate, Kagi, at Cleveland, Ohio, and
</p>
<p>made a speech to the multitude convened to express sympathy
</p>
<p>with several leading citizens of Oberlin, then in prison by
</p>
<p>United States processes for assisting in the escape of runaway
</p>
<p>slaves. His words were those of scorn of the institution which
</p>
<p>made chattels of human beings. He related the particulars of
</p>
<p>his late expedition of liberation, and remarked that, though
</p>
<p>very poor, he still was worth three thousand two hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty dollars  that being the price fixed upon his head by the
</p>
<p>Governor of Missouri and the President of the United States.
</p>
<p>He was received with a " storm of applause." From Cleveland
</p>
<p>he proceeded first to Astabula county, Ohio, where he found
</p>
<p>friends and advisers in several well known men, and where his
</p>
<p>temporary depot of arms then was. Passing on to the East,
</p>
<p>he delivered a speech at Eochester, IST. Y., and spent a brief
</p>
<p>period with his friend Gerritt Smith, ut Peterboro, from whom
</p>
<p>he doubtless, received such final aid as enabled him to
</p>
<p>hasten the consummation of his plans. He visited Boston and
</p>
<p>New York city. At Collins ville. Conn., he ordered to be com-
</p>
<p>pleted the one thousand pikes, which, though contracted for in

</p>
<p>not finished. After a somewhat extended tour to the East,
</p>
<p>and a brief visit to his family at North Elba, New York, he
</p>
<p>returned to Northern Ohio  thence he made his way to Cham-
</p>
<p>bersburg, Penn., where he was joined by two of his sons and
</p>
<p>530 THE CONSPIRACY OF JOHN BEOWN.
</p>
<p>Captain Anderson. Witli these he proceeded to Hagerstown,
</p>
<p>Md.  there assuming the name of Smith. He was carried to
</p>
<p>Harper's Ferry in a public hack, and represented to inquirers
</p>
<p>that, tired of farming in Western New York, he was seeking
</p>
<p>for a sheep farm in that vicinity. Said the man who drove the
</p>
<p>adventurers over to the Ferry :
</p>
<p>" After looking around Harper's Ferry a few days, and prowling
</p>
<p>througli the mountains in search of minerals, as they said, they came
</p>
<p>across a large farm with three unoccupied houses  the owner, Dr
</p>
<p>Booth Kennedy, having died in the Spring. These houses they rented
</p>
<p>from the family till next March, and paid the rent iu advance, and also
</p>
<p>purchased a lot of hogs from the family for cash, and agreed to take
</p>
<p>care of the stock until a sale could be had ; and they did attend most
</p>
<p>faithfully to them, and have it all in first rate order ; were gentlemen, and
</p>
<p>Jcind to every hody. After living there a few weeks, others joined them,
</p>
<p>until as many as twelve were in these three houses, and every few days
</p>
<p>a stranger would ajjpear and disappear again without creating the least
</p>
<p>surprise."
</p>
<p>This Kennedy farm was located about five miles from the
</p>
<p>Ferry, on the Maryland side, in a well settled but somewhat
</p>
<p>wild region. It was an admirably chosen rendezvous, accessi-
</p>
<p>ble yet not too exposed. The men there quietly gathered, but
</p>
<p>kept from sight, spending much time in wandering singly, over
</p>
<p>wide distances of the mountainous regions around the Ferry,
</p>
<p>to become well acquainted with its wild and intricate features.
</p>
<p>Their goods, arms, ammunition and stores, were carted, with-
</p>
<p>out notice, from Chambersburg to the farm, which soon became
</p>
<p>quite an arsenal.
</p>
<p>Here the conspirators remained undisturbed until the hour
</p>
<p>of action. Says Brown's biographer: " It was the original in-
</p>
<p>tention of Captain Brown to sieze the arsenal at Harper's Ferry
</p>
<p>on the night of the 24th of October, and to take the arms there
</p>
<p>deposited to the neighboring mountains, with a number of the

<p>its foundations, on the night of the 17th. One of the men who
</p>
<p>fought at Harper's Ferry gave me as the chief reason for the
</p>
<p>precipitate movement, that they suspected there was a J a-
</p>
<p>THE "work" begun. 531
</p>
<p>das in their company. That the reasons were just and impor-
</p>
<p>tant, the prudence that John Brown had always hitherto man-
</p>
<p>ifested satisfactorily proves. But this decision, however
</p>
<p>necessary, was unfortunate ; for the men from Canada, Kansas,
</p>
<p>New England and the neighboring Free States, who had been
</p>
<p>told to be prepared for the event on the 24th of October, and
</p>
<p>were ready to do their duty at Harper's Ferry at that time,
</p>
<p>were unable to join their Captain at this earlier period.
</p>
<p>" Many, who started to join the Liberators, halted half way ;
</p>
<p>for the blow had already been struck, and their Captain made
</p>
<p>a captive. Had there been no precipitation, the mountains of
</p>
<p>Virginia, to-day, would have been peopled with free blacks,
</p>
<p>properly ofl&cered and ready for field action.
</p>
<p>" The negroes, also, in the neighboring counties, who had
</p>
<p>promised to be ready on the 24th of October, were confused
</p>
<p>by the precipitate attack ; and, before they could act in concert
</p>
<p> which they can only do by secret nocturnal meetings  were
</p>
<p>watched, overpowered, and deprived of every chance to join
</p>
<p>their heroic Liberators.
</p>
<p>" Having sent off the women who lived at their cabins 
</p>
<p>Cook's wife and others  the neighbors began to talk about 'the
</p>
<p>singularity of the proceeding ; and it became necessary, on thafe
</p>
<p>account, also, to precipitate an attack on Harper's Ferry."
</p>
<p>On the evening of the 17th, Brown convened his friends and
</p>
<p>gave them his general as well as specific instructions  among
</p>
<p>which was to take no life not actually necessary to their own
</p>
<p>self-preservation an injunction followed to the letter.
</p>
<p>At night fall, October 17th, 1859, the Conspirators passed
</p>
<p>from the farm to the Ferry. The number detailed to the town
</p>
<p>was twenty-two, viz.: seventeen whites, and five blacks. Seve-
</p>
<p>ral squads were dispatched to positions above and below the
</p>
<p>town for the purpose of cutting away the telegraph wires and
</p>
<p>for tearing up the railway track  thus to sever all communi-

<p>cation with the Ferry and to give the Conspirators time to con-
</p>
<p>summate their work. The first steps were to sieze the town
</p>
<p>and some of its citizens as hostages for the safety of any " Lib-
</p>

</p>
<p>thus to obtain the necessary equipments for the powerful
</p>
<p>force which it was conceived would soon be at the leader's
</p>
<p>disposal, composed of whites and negroes on their way from
</p>
<p>the North, and ot slaves for whose liberation the movement
</p>
<p>was made ; then, all having been accomplished, the armed host
</p>
<p>was to retire to the fastnesses of the mountains before the mi-
</p>
<p>litia which would, it was supposed, gather for an attack. The
</p>
<p>general plan, as divulged by Cook, Brown and Kagi,' compris-
</p>
<p>ed a permanent occupation of the Virginia mountains ; no slaves
</p>
<p>were to be run off to Canada, except such as preferred to go ;
</p>
<p>communications with the North, through Pennsylvania, were
</p>
<p>to be preserved ; the standard of revolt was to be borne along
</p>
<p>the mountains to the South, but no war was to be made other
</p>
<p>than one of strict defense, and such as might be necessary to
</p>
<p>aid the negroes in making their way from the plantations to
</p>
<p>the mountains. This was the general scheme conceived by the
</p>
<p>daring leader. That it could have succeeded is, indeed, most
</p>
<p>questionable ; for, had Brown been able to retire, as arranged,
</p>
<p>to the mountains, and had he proven too strong for the militia,
</p>
<p>the Federal Grovernment itself must have assumed the offen-
</p>
<p>sive. It doubtless was expected by the friends of the move-
</p>
<p>ment that, in event of the General Government calling out its
</p>
<p>forces, a large accession of Northern men, to Brown's numbers
</p>
<p>would at once take place and thus render him too formidable
</p>
<p>for suppression. However, nothing is now in existence to prove
</p>
<p>that it was his design actually to resist the Federal Govern-
</p>
<p>ment in the field, though we can well conceive that the perma-
</p>
<p>nent occupation arranged for, and the " provisional government"
</p>
<p>ordained by the Chatham Convention, meant nothing if
</p>
<p>not war against all comers. Kagi, in his revelation, it is true,
</p>
<p>put a less revolutionary face on the movement. Thus, the au-
</p>
<p>thority who reports his evidence, says :
</p>
<p>" As fast as possible other bands besides the original ones were to be

<p>formed, and a continuous chain of posts established in the mountains.
</p>
<p>* Kagi was killed early in the first affray. Before leaving Kansas, in 1858, he
</p>
<p>divulged the programme of deliverance and of operations in Virginia. This pro-
</p>
<p>gramme was followed out so closely as to make it appear that Kagi's revelation
</p>
<p>embodied the main features of Brown's stupendous plans.
</p>
<p>OCCUPATION OF THE TOWN. 533
</p>
<p>They were to be supported by provisions taken from the farms of the
</p>
<p>oppressors. They expected to be speedily and constantly reenforced ;
</p>
<p>first, by the arrival of those men, who, in Canada, were anxiously look-
</p>
<p>ing arid praying for the time of deliverance, and then by the slaves them-
</p>
<p>selves. The intention was to hold the egress to the Free States as long
</p>
<p>as possible, in order to retreat when that was advisable. Kagi, howev-
</p>
<p>er, expected to retreat southward, not in the contrary direction. The
</p>
<p>slaves were to be armed with pikes, scythes, muskets, shot guns and
</p>
<p>other simple instruments of defense ; the officers, white or black, and
</p>
<p>such of the men as were skilled and trustworthy, to have the use of the
</p>
<p>Sharpe's rifles and revolvers. They anticipated procuring provisions
</p>
<p>enough for subsistence by forage, as also arms, horses and ammunition.
</p>
<p>Kagi said one of the reasons that induced him to go into the enterprise
</p>
<p>was a full conviction that, at no very distant day, forcible efforts for
</p>
<p>freedom would break out among the slaves, and that slavery might be
</p>
<p>more speedily abolished by such efforts than by any other means. He
</p>
<p>knew by observation in the South, that in no point was the system more
</p>
<p>vulnerable than in its fear of a slave rising. Believing that such a blow
</p>
<p>would soon be struck, he wanted to organize it so as to make it more
</p>
<p>effectual, and also, by directing and controlling the negroes, to prevent
</p>
<p>some of the atrocities that would necessarily arise from the sudden up-
</p>
<p>heaval of such a mass as the Southern slaves. The Constitution adopt-
</p>
<p>ed at Chatham was intended as the framework of organization among
</p>
<p>the emancipationists, to enable the leaders to effect a more complete
</p>
<p>control of their forces. Ignorant men, in ftict all men, were more easily
</p>
<p>managed by the forms of law and organization than without them. This
</p>
<p>was one of the jjurposes to be served by the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>Another was to alarm tlie Oligarchy by the discipline and the show of
</p>
<p>organization. In their terror they would imagine the whole North was
</p>
<p>upon them pell-mell, as well as all their slaves. Kagi said John Brown
</p>
<p>anticipated that by a system of forbearance to non-slaveholders many
</p>
<p>of them might be induced to join them."

<p>armory secured  its watchmen being taken prisoners and lock-
</p>
<p>ed up in the guard house. A watchman on the railway
</p>
<p>bridge over the Potomac also was seized. A second watchman
</p>
<p>coming on at midnight was ordered to surrender, but ran and
</p>
<p>gave the first alarm at the hotel, though nothing followed. A
</p>
<p>passenger train from the West, bound to Baltimore and Wash-

</p>
<p>kindness prevailed over his sense of prudence, it would ap-
</p>
<p>pear, for he finally permitted it to pass. It then flew on its
</p>
<p>way to the east to spread the alarm, and, early on the 18th,
</p>
<p>the country was electrified with most startling announce-
</p>
<p>ments of the "insurrection." Newspaper " extras" issued in
</p>
<p>the cities. East, west, north and south the excitement which
</p>
<p>succeeded was boundless. The most eager curiosity prevailed
</p>
<p>for more news, and more news soon was forthcoming ; each
</p>
<p>hour added to the store of reports " from the scene of conflict."
</p>
<p>Great numbers of adventurers and newspaper reporters took
</p>
<p>early trains to reach the centre of interest.
</p>
<p>/' The first steps taken by Brown were followed by the arrest
</p>
<p>of every citizen who appeared on the street. By day -break
</p>
<p>about fifty had thus been borne to the guard house. As the
</p>
<p>morning progressed, so quietly had affairs been managed, that
</p>
<p>numbers of workmen turned out for their day's labor, uncon-
</p>
<p>scious, until taken prisoners, that the town was under martial
</p>
<p>occupancy. The detail of squads for guarding important
</p>
<p>points was necessarily small. Thus, Brown, his Iwo sons, Aaron
</p>
<p>D. Stevens and two blacks held the armoiy ; John Kagi, with
</p>
<p>Wm. H. Leeman, Stewart Taylor, Lewis Leary, Anderson and
</p>
<p>Copeland (the two latter colored men) held the rifle works and
</p>
<p>patrolled the lower town ; John E. Cook, with Owen Brown,
</p>
<p>C. P. Tidd, R J. Merriam and Barclay Coppoc remained at
</p>
<p>the Kennedy farm cabins and school house to care for the pro
</p>
<p>perty there and to act as a reserve ; a few men stood on guard
</p>
<p>at the bridge and street corners. What an army of invasion !
</p>
<p>During the forenoon shots were fired by citizens who began
</p>
<p>to pluck up resolution. A man named Barclay who fired upon
</p>
<p>the guard was killed mstantly. About half a dozen Virgini-
</p>
<p>ans, gathered in a building commanding the armory grounds,
</p>
<p>succeeded in killing one of Brown's men and in mortally

<p>wounding his son Watson. This random firing continued un-
</p>
<p>til after mid-day. Shortly after noon a detachment of militia
</p>
<p>from Charlestown, Va., arrived, one hundred strong. This was
</p>
<p>the beginning of the end. These troops, in conjunction with
</p>
<p>citizens, soon obtained possession of the Shenandoah bridge,

</p>
<p>the rifle works and other available points. Brown, seeing his
</p>
<p>position untenable, retired to the armory engine bouse. Kagi
</p>
<p>and his men, pressed into the river, swam to rocks in its cen-
</p>
<p>tre, which four of them reached. They were there met by the
</p>
<p>lire of one hundred muskets. Kagi literally was riddled with
</p>
<p>balls. His body floated down stream, soon to be accompanied
</p>
<p>by that of Anderson. Leary was mortally wounded and
</p>
<p>Copeland taken prisoner. Leeman's brains were blown out by
</p>
<p>a German militiaman. Having been sent to confer with Brown,
</p>
<p>he was wounded and was pursued into the water there to be
</p>
<p>shot down. The engine house soon was under siege. One by
</p>
<p>one the "Liberators" began to fall. Newby, a negro, and Jim,
</p>
<p>Colonel Washington's coachman, fell early in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>Also a free negro. All of these negroes fought intrepidly.
</p>
<p>Two Virginians were killed in the first assault on the engine
</p>
<p>house, viz.: Captain Turner and Mr. Beckman, Mayor of the
</p>
<p>town. In revenge, William Thompson, one of Brown's men,
</p>
<p>held as a prisoner, was taken out on the bridge and shot, with
</p>
<p>many accompaniments of atrocity. A townsman held as a
</p>
<p>hostage prevailed on Brown to let Stevens and himself pass
</p>
<p>out, under a flag of truce, to try and arrange matters. Brown
</p>
<p>consented, when Stevens and the citizen passed out. The flag
</p>
<p>was violated ; Stevens was shot, and the citizen failed to return
</p>
<p>to Brown's quarters. Night at length came to find the lion-
</p>
<p>hearted old warrior closely besieged by a force of over one
</p>
<p>thousand well arm^ed and infuriated men. His case was hope-
</p>
<p>less. Why he did not escape to the mountains before he be-
</p>
<p>came so helplessly hemmed in is not known. Should he hold
</p>
<p>out until morning then the force against him would be two
</p>
<p>thousand men, for the President of the United States, the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor of Virginia and the City of Baltimore all had dispatched
</p>
<p>troops to the spot. Said Eedpath : "The result of the day's

<p>the remains of Oliver Brown and Dauphin Thompson ; while

</p>
<p>Watson, the Captain's son, lay without hope of recovery. The
</p>
<p>only unwounded survivors of the Liberators in the engine
</p>
<p>house were Captain Brown, Jerry Anderson, Edwin Coppoc,
</p>
<p>and Shields Green, the negro. Eight Virginia hostages, and a
</p>
<p>small number of armed negroes were with them."
</p>
<p>The morning of Tuesday, October 19th, brought, as was ex-
</p>
<p>pected, such an array as would have appalled any other heart
</p>
<p>than that of John Brown. There was no tremor in his nerves.
</p>
<p>He calmly awaited the last shock, determined, with his three
</p>
<p>unbounded men, to receive the charge of the host without but
</p>
<p>not to surrender, /' A company of United States troops, having
</p>
<p>arrived during the night, with two pieces of artillery, took po-
</p>
<p>sition before the engine house, but forbore to open on it as
</p>
<p>within were Colonel Washington and seven other Virginians,
</p>
<p>held as hostages. A parley was called, therefore, under a flag
</p>
<p>of truce. Brown was pressed earnestly to surrender. He
</p>
<p>firmly refused except upon terms equivalent to his escape, viz.:
</p>
<p>to be permitted to march out with his men and arms, taking
</p>
<p>his prisoners with him ; to proceed to the second toll gate be
</p>
<p>yond the bridge, where he would free the prisoners ; there the
</p>
<p>troops might enter upon the pursuit and catch the "Liberators"
</p>
<p>if they could.
</p>
<p>The direct assault followed. A heavy ladder used as a bat-
</p>
<p>tering ram laid open the doors and the United States troops
</p>
<p>entered, ; One only of the assailants was seriously wounded,
</p>
<p>although four rifles were fired into the crowd. One of Brown's
</p>
<p>men was killed, and he himself shockingly cut by sabre strokes
</p>
<p>on his head after he had ceased resistance, and, after he was
</p>
<p>down, was twice bayonetted. /'Only Coppoc and Green escaped)

</p>
<p>fled to the mountains, to become a seven days' terror, and to
</p>
<p>enlist, in his pursuit, half the able bodied inhabitants of the
</p>
<p>surrounding country, as well as several bodies of militia and
</p>
<p>the United States' marines.
</p>
<p>It is needless here to detail the incidents which followed this
</p>
<p>capture. That they were numerous and exciting is true, but
</p>
<p>they belong rather to local than to general history. Governor
</p>
<p>Wise and U. S. Senator Mason, both of Virginia, hastened to
</p>
<p>the Ferry, where they held an interview with Brown and Ste-
</p>
<p>vens in the guard house.' They learned nothing aside from
</p>
<p>what Brown confessed to be his general design to liberate slaves.
</p>
<p>The premises at Kennedy's farm were searched, and, in a car-
</p>
<p>pet bag iilled with papers, were found copies of the Chathan
</p>
<p>Constitution, which Brown acknowledged to be his own con-
</p>
<p>ception. He produced on his visitors, by his fearless but kind
</p>
<p>demeanor, an impression singularly at variance with the hate
</p>
<p>of the infuriated crowd who gathered to " get a sight of the
</p>
<p>monster." Said the Governor, after his return to Richmond :
</p>
<p>" They are themselves mistaken who take him to be a madman. He
</p>
<p>is a bundle of the best nerves I ever saw, cut and thrust, and bleeding
</p>
<p>and in bonds. He is a man of clear head, of courage, fortitude and
</p>
<p>simple ingenuousness. He is cool collected and indomitable, and it
</p>
<p>is but just to him to say, that he was humane to his prisoners, as
</p>
<p>stated to me by Colonel Washington and Mr. Mills, and he inspired
</p>
<p>me with great trust in his integrity as a man of truth. He is a fa-
</p>
<p>natic, vain and garrulous, but firm, and truthful and intelligent. Hia
</p>
<p>men, too, who survive, except the free negroes with him, are like him.
</p>
<p>He professes to be a Christian, in communion with the Congregational
</p>
<p>Church of the North, and openly preaches his purpose of universal
</p>
<p>emancipation : and the negroes themselves were to be the agents, by
</p>
<p>means of arms, led on by white commanders."
</p>
<p>There were found stored in the buildings at the farm, and
</p>
<p>in the log school house near by, a considerable quantity of

<p>town jail, accompanied by Governor Wise and a strong escort
</p>
<p>of U. S. marines. ; Watson Brown had died in the guard house
</p>
<p>Wednesday morning. His body was given over to the doctors
</p>
<p>for dissection.' The remaining bodies were gathered and
</p>
<p>buried together in a pit. A preliminary ' court' composed of
</p>
<p>eight justices of the peace, convened on the 25th of October.
</p>
<p>This court was but a form to bind the prisoners over to the
</p>
<p>Circuit Court. Brown protested against it. His fearless speech
</p>
<p>in the court room has often been cited. He said :
</p>
<p>" If a fair trial is to be allowed us, there are mitigating circumstances,
</p>
<p>that I would urge in our favor. But if we are to be forced with a mere
</p>
<p>form  a trial for execution you might spare yourselves that trouble.
</p>
<p>I am ready for my fate. I do not ask a trial. I beg for no mockery of
</p>
<p>a trial  no insult  nothing but that which conscience gives or coward-
</p>
<p>ice would drive you to practise.
</p>
<p>" I ask again to be excused from the mockery of a trial. I do not know
</p>
<p>what the special design of this examination is. I do not know what is
</p>
<p>to be the benefit of it to the Commonwealth. I have now little further
</p>
<p>to ask, other than that I may not be foolishly insulted, only as cowardly
</p>
<p>barbarians insult those Who fall into their power."
</p>
<p>The examination, however, proceeded. The evidence of
</p>
<p>course was such as to commit all for final trial, before the high-
</p>
<p>er tribunal, which assembled at once  so hurried were the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings. Great alarm existed in the community. Eumors
</p>
<p>of the wildest character prevailed regarding a rescue by North-
</p>
<p>ern men, and also in regard to the strength of Cook, still in
</p>
<p>the mountains. Said a dispatch from the Charlestown tele-
</p>
<p>graph office :
</p>
<p>" There is an evident intention to hurry the trial through, and bxccute
</p>
<p>the prisoners as soon as possible fearing attempts to rescue them. It
</p>
<p>is rumored that Brown is desirous of making a full statement of his mo-
</p>
<p>tives and intentions through the press, but the court has refused all ac-
</p>
<p>cess to reporters  feariug that he may put forth something calculated

<p>to influence the public mind, and to have a bad effect on the slaves."
</p>
<p>" The reason given for hurrying the trial is, that the people of the
</p>
<p>whole country are kej)t in a state of excitement, and a large armed
</p>
<p>force is required to prevent attempts at rescue."
</p>
<p> The students of Winchester Medical College skinned the body, separated the
</p>
<p>muscular and venous systems and injected the veins, dried and varnished the bones,
</p>
<p>and kept the whole on exhibition in their anatomical museum. The skin was to
</p>
<p>liave been stuifed, but was, it is understood, prepared into leather and used for
</p>
<p>inaking various articles of viriu.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 539
</p>
<p>The grand jury was called at two o'clock p. m., Tuesday,
</p>
<p>(Oct. 25th,) and charged by Judge Parker. The charge was
</p>
<p>a queer commingling of judicial honesty and pro-slave pre-
</p>
<p>judgment. While it demanded for Brown an impartial hear-
</p>
<p>ing, it assumed his guilt as certain, and used such terms as
</p>
<p>must infl.ame the minds of Virginians against the prisoners.
</p>
<p>The jurymen did not perfect their indictment until noon of
</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 26th, when a " true bill" was reported against
</p>
<p>each of the prisoners arraigned : first, for conspiring with ne-
</p>
<p>groes to incite an insurrection; second, for treason to the Com-
</p>
<p>monwealth of Virginia; third, for murder. Upon all these
</p>
<p>counts of the indictment the trial at once proceeded  not upon
</p>
<p>one, as is usual. Brown, still ill and feeble from wounds, ask-
</p>
<p>ed for a short delay to recover his strength and to prepare his
</p>
<p>case; but, it was refused. The prisoners all plead "not guilty."
</p>
<p>Their appearance was thus noticed by a correspondent of a
</p>
<p>Richmond paper :
</p>
<p>" The prisoners were brought into court, accompanied by a body of
</p>
<p>armed men. Cannon were stationed in front of the court house, and an
</p>
<p>armed guard were jjatrolling round the jail. Brown looked something
</p>
<p>oetter, and his eye was not so much swollen. Stevens had to be sup-
</p>
<p>j)orted, and reclined on a matti-ess on the floor of the court room  evi-
</p>
<p>dently unable to sit. He has the appearance of a dying man, breathing
</p>
<p>with great diflaculty. The prisoners were compelled to stand during
</p>
<p>the indictment, but it was with difficulty. Stevens being held uj)right
</p>
<p>by two liailiffs."
</p>
<p>The State elected to try Brown first, when Lawson Botts,
</p>
<p>the counsel assigned for his defense, by the court, asked for
</p>
<p>delay, citing Brown's unfitness for trial. No respite, however,
</p>
<p>was permitted. The court evidently deemed it impolitic to
</p>
<p>give the culprit chance for sturdy defense. A jury was im-
</p>
<p>panneled during the afternoon, after much labor to obtain those

<p>tried to do his duty, evidently did not care to face public sen-
</p>
<p>timent ; the j Liry was impanneled and sworn in without a chal-
</p>
<p>lenge.
</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, October 27th, John Brown's trial
</p>
<p>opened. It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings. Counsel

<p>for the prisoners, which had been sent for, almost hourly was

</p>
<p>expected; but, no suspension of the trial was permitted.
</p>
<p>Thursday and Friday were spent in the examination of wit-
</p>
<p>nesses. Brown's counsel elicited many facts going to prove his
</p>
<p>client's humanity ; but, before the court stood those who had
</p>
<p>witnessed, or participated in, the conflict of Monday and Tues-
</p>
<p>day : no Virginia jury could be expected to regard Brown, in
</p>
<p>the face of their testimony, other than as a criminal of the worst
</p>
<p>class. One of those who had assisted in the murder of Thomp-
</p>
<p>son, confessed the deed and its brutal circumstances ; but, not
</p>
<p>a thought prevailed of crime in his case. Counsel for Brown
</p>
<p>arrived Friday. A brief respite was asked by them to look
</p>
<p>into the case; still, all delays, for any cause, were denied.
</p>
<p>During Saturday witnesses for the defense were introduced.
</p>
<p>The most sought to be proven by them was Brown's freedom
</p>
<p>from malice in his acts and his merely defensive attitude jn all
</p>
<p>cases where life was taken. These points appear to have been
</p>
<p>well sustained. His counsel (composed of Messrs. Geoi-ge H.
</p>
<p>Hoyt, of Boston, Hiram Griswold, of Cleveland, 0., and Sam'l
</p>
<p>Chilton, of Washington City) sought, by various technicalities,
</p>
<p>to gain time  to try on one count only, &c., but, all efforts
</p>
<p>failed. Monday the prosecution and defense made their argu-
</p>
<p>ments. At two o'clock the jury retired, and, in less than an
</p>
<p>hour, returned with a verdict of guilty on all the counts of the
</p>
<p>indictment. One present wrote of the proceedings, at this
</p>
<p>point :
</p>
<p>" Not the slightest sound was beard in the vast crowd as this ver-
</p>
<p>dict was returned and read. Not the slightest expression of elation or
</p>
<p>triumph was uttered from the hundreds present, who, a moment before,
</p>
<p>outside the court, joined in heaping threats and imprecations on his
</p>
<p>head ; nor was this strange silence interruj^ted during the whole of the
</p>
<p>time occupied by the forms of the court. Old Brown himself said not
</p>
<p>even a Avord, but, as on any previous day, turned to adjust hisiJallet,
</p>
<p>and then composedly stretched himself upon it.

<p>"Mr. Chilton moved an arrest of judgment, both on account of errors
</p>
<p>in the indictment and errors in the verdict. The objection in regard to
</p>
<p>the indictment has already been stated. The prisoner had been tried
</p>
<p>for an offense not appearing on the record of the grand jury. The ver-
</p>
<p>dict was not on each count separately, but was a general verdict on the
</p>
<p>whole indictment."
</p>
<p>This motion was argued on the succeeding day but denied,
</p>
<p>brown's speech. 541
</p>
<p>and Brown was remanded to jail for sentence. Coppoc's case
</p>
<p>was then taken up (Nov. 1st) and ended (Nov. 2d) in his con-
</p>
<p>viction. Brown, to save tinie, was brought into court for sen-
</p>
<p>tence, during the absence of the jury r.i the second case. He
</p>
<p>was able to stand, and addressed the court. We may quote :
</p>
<p>"In the first place, I deny every thing but what I have all along ad-
</p>
<p>mitted  the design on my j^art to free the slaves. I intended certainly
</p>
<p>to have made a clear thing of that matter, as I did last Winter, when I
</p>
<p>went into Missouri, and there took slaves without the snapjiing of a
</p>
<p>gun on either side, moved them through the country, and finally left
</p>
<p>them in Canada. I designed to have done the same thing again, on a
</p>
<p>larger scale. That was all I intended. I never did intend murder or
</p>
<p>treason, or the destruction of projierty, or to excite or incite slaves to
</p>
<p>rebellion, or to make insurrection.
</p>
<p>" I have another objection : and that is, it is unjust that I should suf-
</p>
<p>fer such a penalty. Had I interfered in the manner which I admit, and
</p>
<p>which I admit has been fairly proved  (for I admire the truthfulness
</p>
<p>and candor of the greater portion of the witnesses who have testified in
</p>
<p>this case)  had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the
</p>
<p>intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either
</p>
<p>father, mother, brother, sister, wife or children, or any of that class, and
</p>
<p>suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have
</p>
<p>been all right, and every man in this court would have deemed it an act
</p>
<p>worthy of reward rather than iDunishment.
</p>
<p>" This court acknowledges, as I suppose, the validity of the Law of
</p>
<p>God. I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the Bible, or, at
</p>
<p>least, the New Testament. That teaches me that all things ' whatsoever
</p>
<p>I would that men should do unto me, I should do even so to them.' It
</p>
<p>teaches me further, to ' remember them that are in bonds as bound with
</p>
<p>them.' I endeavored to act up to that instruction. I say, I am yet too
</p>
<p>young to understand that God is any respecter of persons. I believe
</p>
<p>that to have interfered as I have done, as I have always freely admitted
</p>
<p>I have done, in behalf of His despised jioor, was not wrong, but right.

<p>Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the fur-
</p>
<p>therance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the
</p>
<p>blood of my children, and with the blood of millions in this slave coun-
</p>
<p>try whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel and unjust enactments
</p>
<p> I submit : so let it be done.
</p>
<p>" Let me say one word further.
</p>
<p>" I felt entirely satisfied with the treatment I have received on my
</p>
<p>trial. Considering all the circumstances, it has been more generous than
</p>
<p>I expected. But I feel no consciousness of guilt. I have stated from
</p>
<p>the first what was my intention and what was not. I never had any

</p>
<p>design against the life of any person, nor any disposition to commit
</p>
<p>treason, or excite slaves to rebel, or make any general insurrection. I
</p>
<p>never encouraged any man to do so, but always discouraged any idea
</p>
<p>of that kind.
</p>
<p>" Let me say, also, a word in regard to the statements made by some
</p>
<p>of those connected with me. I hear it has been stated by some of them
</p>
<p>that I have induced them to join me. But the contrary is true. I do
</p>
<p>not say this to injure them, but regretting their weakness. There is not
</p>
<p>one of them but joined me of his own accord, and the greater part at
</p>
<p>their own expense. A number of them I never saw, and never had a
</p>
<p>word of conversation with, till the day they came to me, and that was
</p>
<p>for the purpose I have stated.
</p>
<p>" Now I have done."
</p>
<p>He was sentenced to be hanged on Friday, Dec. 2d. He was
</p>
<p> kept a close prisoner, and a powerful military guard was de-
</p>
<p>tailed for duty. The excitement which waited upon these
</p>
<p>proceedings was prodigious. In every section of the South all
</p>
<p>classes were anxious for news. The Virginians, fearing a res-
</p>
<p>cue, acted with extreme caution. Brown was kindly treated ;
</p>
<p>wrote and received many letters ; had free frequent interviews
</p>
<p>with visitors and friends; and, would appear to have enjoyed
</p>
<p>perfect serenity of mind. His letters, indeed, are remarkable
</p>
<p>evidences of his clear understanding, his devotion to what he
</p>
<p>deemed duty, and his resignation. They are, at once, very in-
</p>
<p>spiriting and very pathetic, and have not failed to extort from
</p>
<p>his worst enemies words of admiration. One other significant
</p>
<p>feature of his case must be mentioned : the letters of condo-
</p>
<p>lence and of money contributions which flowed in upon him
</p>
<p>from most unexpected sources. These letters proved that sym-
</p>
<p>pathy for him and his work was wide spread : if Brown was
</p>
<p>insane so were his thousand sympathisers.' Many ministers of

<p>man sympathizing with slavery, as a Christian. He gave the same reason yester-
</p>
<p>day for his refusal to accept the services of some clergymen who called upon hiin.
</p>
<p>He also said he would as soon be attended to the scaffold by blacklegs or robbers
</p>
<p>of the worst kind as by slaveholding ministers, or ministers sympathizing with
</p>
<p>slavery, and that if he had liis choice he would prefer being followed to the scaf-
</p>
<p>fold by barefooted, barelegged, ragged negro children, and their old gray-headed
</p>
<p>slave-mother, than by clergymen of this character. He would feel, he said, much
</p>
<p>prouder of such an escort, and wished he could have it." There is an Apostolic

<p>Bublimity ia thia.
</p>
<p>THE FINAL SCENE. 54S
</p>
<p>the Gospel, among others, gained access to his room  some of
</p>
<p>them to argue the divine right of man in man. All of these
</p>
<p>Brown dismissed peremptorily. He refused, in all instances,
</p>
<p>the prayers of every man who was of pro-slavery views. His
</p>
<p>stern, outspoken hate of the " accursed institution" excited the
</p>
<p>astonishment, we are told, of Virginians.
</p>
<p>By November 24th excitement became so great that the
</p>
<p>military force in and around Charlestown was largely augment-
</p>
<p>ed and martial law was proclaimed. After that it was difficult
</p>
<p>to obtain access to the town, and we only have detached pic-
</p>
<p>tures of his life up to the day of execution. He spent the lat-
</p>
<p>ter portion of his days in preparing a document for his family
</p>
<p> understood to be not so much a defense as an exposition of
</p>
<p>his acts and his views. This interesting document never
</p>
<p>reached its direction. It doubtless was destroyed by the Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia authorities, who, in court and out of it, betrayed much
</p>
<p>anxiety to suppress the utterance of anti-slavery views. Upon
</p>
<p>that point comment might prove interesting.
</p>
<p>Wednesday before the execution, Mrs. Brown, under escort
</p>
<p>of the military, reached Charlestown and had an interview with
</p>
<p>her husband. It was a very sad meeting, but Brown was
</p>
<p>thoroughly resigned and resolute. His wife bore the affliction
</p>
<p>with a fortitude worthy of all praise.
</p>
<p>The execution took place on the day allotted by law, in the
</p>
<p>midst of an iniposing military display. ; The spot chosen was
</p>
<p>on a hill-side near to the town, from which the vast concourse
</p>
<p>of spectators could behold the sight. Brown was invincible to
</p>
<p>the last  betraying not a shadow of fear. He went into eter-
</p>
<p>nity like one gliding off into repose. After death the body
</p>
<p>was given over to Mrs. Brown, and, by her, borne to their farm
</p>
<p>at North Elba, N. Y., where it was buried with circumstances
</p>
<p>of profound interest. Wendall Phillips, of Boston, pronounced
</p>

</p>
<p>laurels of martyrdom.

<p>The execution of Stevens, Copeland, and Green passed off

<p>Brown's exit from life.
</p>
<p>Thus closed the tragedy of John Brown's scheme for slavo
</p>
<p>liberation. Its sad results elicited, from a large majority of
</p>
<p>the North, not a word of regret The act of Brown was at
</p>
<p>war with the peace of society and the comity of States ; it had
</p>
<p>for its aim the overthrow of recognized institutions and the
</p>
<p>instatement of a reign of terror ; its ends could only be attain-
</p>
<p>ed through desolation and blood. But a select few were " rad-
</p>
<p>cal" enough to sustain his course, much as the majority of
</p>
<p>men might have admu-ed his heroism and his truth of souL
</p>
<p>For a season abolitionists of the Garrisonian school reposed
</p>
<p>under a load of obloquy, and it appeared as if slavery were
</p>
<p>strengthened by the war of words which succeeded. When
</p>
<p>Congress assembled the subject was introduced, and Mr. Dou-
</p>
<p>glas, by a bill to punish sedition, sought to render further in-
</p>
<p>vasions high State crimes. In the debates which ensued par-
</p>
<p>tisan capital was sought to be made against the party then for
</p>
<p>the first time in the ascendancy  the anti-slavery, or "Kepub-
</p>
<p>lican" party. But, the Eepublican leaders disclaimed any
</p>
<p>sympathy with Brown, whose cause they censured as revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary and reprehensible. , A feeling of uneasiness prevailed,
</p>
<p>in Southern circles ; some danger seemed impending ; vague'
</p>
<p>apprehensions of further invasion were entertained ; and such I
</p>
<p>intimations were made by Mr. Mason and other Southern Sen- '

<p>' 15th, 1860. Great excitement followed attempts to seize these
</p>
<p>persons. Brown and his neighbors armed, and defied the officer
</p>
<p>detailed for his arrest Sanborn was seized at Concord, N. H.,
</p>
<p>at night, but was rescued by his neighbors, and, under a writ
</p>
<p>^^of habeas corpus, had a hearing before Chief Justice Shaw, who
</p>
<p>declared the arrest illegal. Bedpath eluded the writ of arrest.
</p>
<p>Hyatt was borne to Washington. March 9th he appeared,
</p>
<p>with eminent counsel, before the Senate, to answer, 1st, why
</p>
<p>he had refused to obey the first summons to testify, and 2d, if
</p>
<p>he was then willing to appear before the committee and to an-
</p>
<p>swer such questions as might be required of him. Very ex-
</p>
<p>citing proceedings ensued. Hyatt's reply was, in substance,
</p>
<p>that the committee was commissioned with " powers such as
</p>
<p>were never before known or contemplated in this Eepublican
</p>
<p>Government ; powers that were inimical to freedom, subversive
</p>
<p>of liberty and in violation of the fundamental law of the land ;
</p>
<p>and to be resisted, 1st, because contrary to reason, and 2d, be-
</p>
<p>cause contrary to the Constitution," In support of this he sub-
</p>
<p>mitted his written argument  a very able paper, surveying the
</p>
<p>whole question involved, of congressional po Wei's and personal
</p>
<p>rights. In view of this protest Mason introduced a resolution
</p>
<p>to commit Hyatt to the common jail of the District, there to
</p>
<p>be kept in close custody until he should signify his willingness
</p>
<p>to answer such questions as might be propounded by the se-
</p>
<p>lect committee. Pending discussion on this order of incarce-
</p>
<p>ration, Hyatt was remanded to the custody of the Sergeant at
</p>
<p>Arms. March 12th, the resolution for close confinement vras
</p>
<p>passed, by a vote of 44 to 10. Hyatt, accordingly, was com-
</p>
<p>mitted to the common jail, and was, in most respects, treated
</p>
<p>as a common felon. An effort was made. May 28th, to grant

<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>JEFFERSON'S EIENTUCKY RESOLUTIONS OF '98.
</p>
<p>In the paper on the " Alien and Sedition Troubles" we refer to the
</p>
<p>celebrated Kentucky Resolutions of Nullification and State Supremacy
</p>
<p>which have ever since formed one of the fundamental princii^les of the
</p>
<p>"democratic" party. Their importance requires their repetition here
</p>
<p>at length. As passed, in their modified form, by the Kentucky Lecris-
</p>
<p>lature (Nov. 10th, 15th, 1798), they read:
</p>
<p>1. Resolved, That the several States composing the United States of America, are
</p>
<p>not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government;
</p>
<p>but by compact, under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States,
</p>
<p>and of amendments thereto, they constituted a general government for special pur-
</p>
<p>poses, delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each State
</p>
<p>to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government ; and, thatf when-
</p>
<p>soever the General Government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unau-
</p>
<p>thoritative, void and of no force ; that to this compact each State acceded as a
</p>
<p>State, and is an integral party ; that this government, created by this compact,
</p>
<p>was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to
</p>
<p>itself ; since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution the
</p>
<p>measure of its powers; but, that, as in all other cases of compact among parties
</p>
<p>kaving no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for Itself, as well
</p>
<p>of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.
</p>
<p>2. Resolved, That the Constitution of the United States having delegated to Con-
</p>
<p>gress a power to punish treason, counterfeiting the securities and current coin of
</p>
<p>the United States, piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and ofi'enses
</p>
<p>against the laws of nations, and no other crimes whatever; and it being true, as a
</p>
<p>general principle, and one *f the amendments to the Constitution having also de-
</p>
<p>clared, " that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
</p>
<p>nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to
</p>
<p>the people," therefore also the same act of Congress, passed on the 14th day of
</p>
<p>July, 1798, and entitled " An act in addition to act entitled An act for the punish-
</p>
<p>ment of certain crimes against the United States ;" as also the act passed by them

<p>on the 27th day of June, 1798, entitled " An act to punish frauds committed on the
</p>
<p>Bank of the United States," (and all other their acts which assume to create, define

</p>
<p>54:8 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>crimes is reserved, and of right appertains solely and exclusively, to tlie respective
</p>
<p>States, each within its own territory.
</p>
<p>6. Resolved, That it is true, as a general principle, and is also expressly declared
</p>
<p>by one of the amendments to the Constitution, that " the powers not delegated to
</p>
<p>the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited bynt to the States, are re-
</p>
<p>Berved to the States respectively, or to the people;" and that no power over the
</p>
<p>freedom of religion, freedom of speech, or freedom of the press being delegated to
</p>
<p>the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, all lawful
</p>
<p>powers respecting the same did of right remain, and were reserved to the States
</p>
<p>or to the people ; that thus was manifested their determination to retain to them-
</p>
<p>selves the right of judging how far the Ifcentiousness of speech and of the press
</p>
<p>may be abridged without lessening their useful freedosn, and how far those abuses
</p>
<p>which cannot be separated from their use should be tolerated rather than the use
</p>
<p>be destroyed ; and thus also they guarded against all abridgement by the United
</p>
<p>States of the freedom of religious principles and exercises, and retained to them-
</p>
<p>selves the right of protecting the same, as this State, by a law passed on the gene-
</p>
<p>ral demand of its citizens, had already protected them from all human restraint or
</p>
<p>interference ; and that, in addition to this general principle and express declara-
</p>
<p>tion, another and more special provision has been made by one of the amendments
</p>
<p>to the Constitution which expressly declares, that " Congress shall make no laws
</p>
<p>respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or
</p>
<p>abridging the freedom of speech or of the press," thereby guarding in the same
</p>
<p>Bentence, and under the same words, the freedom of religion, of speech and the
</p>
<p>press, insomuch that whatever violates either, throws down the sanctuary which
</p>
<p>covers the others ; and that libels, falsehood and defamation, equally with heresy
</p>
<p>and false religion, are withheld from the cognizance of Federal tribunals. That
</p>
<p>therefore the act of the Congress of the United States, passed on the 14th of July,
</p>
<p>1798, entitled " An act in addition to the act entitled An act for the punishment of
</p>
<p>certain crimes against the United States," which does abridge the freedom of the
</p>
<p>press, is not law, but is altogether void and of no force.
</p>
<p>4. Resolved, That alien friends are under the jurisdiction and protection of the
</p>
<p>laws of the State wherein they are ; that no power over them has been delegated
</p>
<p>to the United States, nor prohibited to the individual States distinct from their

</p>
<p>power over citizens ; and it being true, as a general principle, and one of the
</p>
<p>amendments to the Constitution having also declared, that " the powers not dele-
</p>
<p>gated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the States, are
</p>
<p>reserved to the States respectively, or to the people," the act of the Congress of
</p>
<p>the United States, passed the 22d day of June, 1798, entitled " An act concerning
</p>
<p>aliens," which assumes power over alien friends not delegated by the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, is not law, but is altogether void and of no force.
</p>
<p>5. Resolved, That in addition to the general principle as well as the express de-
</p>
<p>claration, that powers not delegated are reserved, another and more special pro-
</p>
<p>vision inferred in the Constitution, from abundant caution has declared, " that the
</p>
<p>migration and importation of such persons as any of the States now existing sliall
</p>
<p>think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year
</p>
<p>1808." That this commonwealth does admit the migration of alien friends describ-
</p>
<p>ed as the subject of the said act concerning aliens ; that a provision against pro-
</p>
<p>hibiting their migration, is a provision against all acts equivalent thereto, or it
</p>
<p>THE KENTUCKY KESOLUTIONS. 649
</p>
<p>would be nugatory ; tliat to remove them when migrated Is equivalent to a prohi-
</p>
<p>bition of their migration, and is, therefore, contrary to the said provision of the
</p>
<p>Constitution, and void.
</p>
<p>6. Besolved, That the imprisoument of a person under the protection of the laws
</p>
<p>of this commonwealth on his failure to obey the simple order of the President to
</p>
<p>depart ou^ of the United States, as is undertaken by said act, entitled, " An act
</p>
<p>concerning aliens," is contrary to the Constitution, one amendment in which has
</p>
<p>provided, that " no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law,"
</p>
<p>and that another having provided, " that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused
</p>
<p>shall enjoy the right to a public trial by sm. impartial jury, to be informed as to the
</p>
<p>nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against
</p>
<p>him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have
</p>
<p>assistance of counsel for his defense," the same act undertaking to authorize the
</p>
<p>President to remove a person out of the United States who is under the protection
</p>
<p>of the law, on his own suspicion, without jury, without public trial, without con-
</p>
<p>frontation of the witnesses against him, without having witnesses iu his favor,
</p>
<p>without defense, without counsel, is contrary to these provisions also of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, is therefore not law, but utterly void and of no force.
</p>
<p>That transferring the power of judging any person who is under the protection
</p>
<p>of the laws, from the courts to the P^-esident of the United States, as is undertaken
</p>
<p>by the same act concerning aliens, is against the article of the Constitution which,
</p>
<p>provides, " that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in the
</p>
<p>courts, the judges of which shall hold their office during good behavior," and that
</p>
<p>the said act ft void for that reason also ; and it is further to be noted that this
</p>
<p>transfer of judiciary power is to that magistrate of the General Government who
</p>
<p>already possesses all the executive, and a qualified negative on all the legislative
</p>
<p>powers.
</p>
<p>7. Resolved, That the construction applied by the General Government (as is
</p>
<p>evident by sundry of their proceedings) to those parts of the Constitution of the
</p>
<p>United States which delegate to Congress power to lay and collect taxes, duties,
</p>
<p>imposts, excises ; to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and gene-
</p>
<p>ral welfare of the United States, and to make all laws which shall be necessary
</p>
<p>and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the Constitution in

</p>
<p>the Government of the United States, or any department thereof, goes to the de-
</p>
<p>struction of all the limits prescribed to their power by the Constitution: That
</p>
<p>words meant by that instrument to be subsidiary only to the execution of the lim-
</p>
<p>ited powers, ought not to be so construed as themselves to give unlimited powers,
</p>
<p>nor a part so to be taken as to destroy the whole residue of the instrument : Tliat
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the General Government under color of those articles, will be
</p>
<p>a fit and necessary subject of revisal and correction at a time of greater tranquility,
</p>
<p>while those specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate redress.
</p>
<p>8. Resolved, That the preceding resolutions be transmitted to the senators and
</p>
<p>representatives in Congress from this commonwealth, who are ejijoined to present
</p>
<p>the same to their respective Houses, and to use their best endeavors to procure at
</p>
<p>the next session of Congress a repeal of the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnox-
</p>
<p>ious acts.
</p>
<p>9. Resolved lastly, That the Governor of this commonwealth be, and is hereby
</p>
<p>authorized and requested to communicate the preceding resolutions to the Legis-
</p>
<p>550 APPENDIX
</p>
<p>latureg of the seveial States, to assure tliera tliat this commonwealth considers
</p>
<p>union for special National purposes, and particularly for those specified in their
</p>
<p>late Federal compact, to be friendly to the peace, happiness and prosperity of all
</p>
<p>the States  that, faithful to that compact, according to the plan, intent and mean-
</p>
<p>ing in which it was so understood and acceded to by the several parties, it is sin-
</p>
<p>cerely anxious for its preservation; that it does also believe, that to take from the
</p>
<p>States all the powers of self-government, and transfer them to a general and con-
</p>
<p>solidated Government, without regard to the special delegations and reservations
</p>
<p>solemnly agreed to in that compact, is not for the peace, happiness or prosperity
</p>
<p>of these States ; and that, therefore, this commonwealth is determined, as it doubts
</p>
<p>not its co-States are, to submit to undelegated and consequently unlimited powers
</p>
<p>in no man or body of men on earth ; that if the acts before specified should stand,
</p>
<p>these conclusions would flow from them; that the General Government may place
</p>
<p>any act they think proper on the list of crimes and punish it themselves, whether
</p>
<p>enumerated or not enumerated by the Constitution as cognizable by them ; that
</p>
<p>they may transfer its cognizance to the President or any other person, who may
</p>
<p>himself be the accuser, counsel, judge and jury, whose suspicions may be the evi-
</p>
<p>dence, his order the sentence, his officer the executioner,. and his breast the sole
</p>
<p>record of the transaction ; that a very numerous and valuable description of the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of these States, being by this precedent reduced as outlaws to the ab-
</p>
<p>solute dominion of one man, and the barriers of the Constitution thus swept from
</p>
<p>us all, and no rampart now remains against the passions and the power of a majo-
</p>
<p>rity of Congress, to protect from a like exportation or other grievous punishment
</p>
<p>the minority of the same body, the Legislatures, judges, governors and counsellors
</p>
<p>of the States, nor their other peaceable inhabitants who may venture to reclaim
</p>
<p>the constitutional rights and liberties of the States and people, or who, for other
</p>
<p>causes, good or bad, may be obnoxious to the views or marked by the suspicions
</p>
<p>of the President, or be thought dangerous to his or their elections or other inte-
</p>
<p>rests, public or personal; that the friendless alien has been selected as the safest
</p>
<p>subject for a first experiment ; but the citizen will soon follow, or rather has al-
</p>
<p>ready followed ; for, already has a Sedition act marked him as a prey : that these
</p>
<p>and successive acts of the same character, unless arrested on the threshold, may
</p>
<p>tend to drive these States into revolution and blood, and will furnish new calum-

<p>nies against republican governments, and new pretexts for those who wish it to
</p>
<p>be believed that man cannot be governed but by a rod of iron ; that it would be a
</p>
<p>dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears
</p>
<p>for the safety of our rights ; that confidence is everywhere the parent of despot-
</p>
<p>ism ; free government is founded in jealousy and not in confidence ; it is jealousy
</p>
<p>and not confidence which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom
</p>
<p>we are obliged to trust with power ; that our Constitution has accordingly fixed
</p>
<p>the limits to which, and no farther, our confidence may go ; and let the honest ad-
</p>
<p>vocates of confidence read the Alien and Sedition acts, and say if the Constitution
</p>
<p>has not been wise in fixing limits to the government it created, and whether we
</p>
<p>should be wise in destroying those limits ? Let him say what the government is,
</p>
<p>if if be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice have conferred on the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, and the President of our choice has assented to and accepted over the friendly
</p>
<p>strangers, to whom the mild spirit of our country and its laws has pledged hospi-
</p>
<p>tality and protection ; that the men of our choice have more respected the bare

<p>suspicions of the President tlian the solid rights of innocence, the claims of jnstifi.
</p>
<p>cation, the sacred force of truth, and the forms and substance of law and justice-
</p>
<p>In questions of power, then, let no more be said of confidence in man, but bind
</p>
<p>him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution. That this common-
</p>
<p>wealth does therefore call on the co-States for an expression of their sentiments
</p>
<p>on the acts concerning aliens, and for the punishment of certain crimes hereinbe-
</p>
<p>fore specified, plainly declaring whether these acts are or are not authorized by
</p>
<p>the Federal compact. And it doubts not that their sense will be so announced as
</p>
<p>to prove their attachment to limited government, whether general or particular,
</p>
<p>and that the rights and liberties of their co-States will be exposed to no dangers
</p>
<p>by remaining embarked on a common bottom with their own ; but they will con-
</p>
<p>cur with this commonwealth in considering the said acts as so palpably against the
</p>
<p>Constitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration, that the compact is not
</p>
<p>meant to be the measure of the powers of the General Government, but that it will
</p>
<p>proceed in the exercise over these States of all powers whatsoever. That they
</p>
<p>will view this as seizing the rights of the States and consolidating them in the
</p>
<p>hands of the General Government, with a power assumed to bind the States (not
</p>
<p>merely in cases made Federal) but in all cases whatsoever, by laws made, not with
</p>
<p>their consent, but by otliers against their consent ; that this would be to surren-
</p>
<p>der the form of government we have chosen, and live under one deriving its pow-
</p>
<p>ers from its own will, and not from our authority ; and that the co-States, recur-
</p>
<p>ring to their natural rights in cases not made Federal, will concur in declaring
</p>
<p>these void and of no force, and will each unite with this commonwealth in request-
</p>
<p>ing tneir repeal at the next session of Congress.

<p>MADISON'S VIRGINIA EESOLUTIONS OF '98.
</p>
<p>Following np the Kentucky Resolutions above given, Madison, in
</p>
<p>concert with Jefferson, ijroposed this series of resolves which were j)ass-
</p>
<p>ed by the Virginia Legislature Dec. 21st, 24th, 1798 :
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the General Assembly of Virginia doth unequivocally express a
</p>
<p>firm resolution to maintain and defend the Constitution of the United States, and
</p>
<p>the Constitution of this State, against every aggression, either foreign or domestic ;
</p>
<p>and that they will support the Government of the United States in all measures
</p>
<p>warranted by the former.

</p>
<p>That this Assembly most solemnly declares a warm attachment to the Union of
</p>
<p>the States, to maintain which it pledges its powers ; and, that for this end, it is
</p>
<p>their duty to watch over and oppose every infraction of those principles which
</p>
<p>constitute the only basis of that Union, because a faithful observance of them can
</p>
<p>alone secure its existence and the public happiness.
</p>
<p>That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the
</p>
<p>powers of the Federal Government, as resulting from the compact to which the
</p>
<p>States are parties, as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrumen*
</p>
<p>constituting that compact, as no further valid than they are authorized by the
</p>
<p>grants enumerated in that compact; and that, incase of a deliberate, palpable
</p>
<p>and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by the said compact, the
</p>
<p>552 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>States, who are paHies thereto, have the right, and are in duty hound, to inter-
</p>
<p>pose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their re-
</p>
<p>spective limits the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.
</p>
<p>That the General Assembly doth also express its deep regret, that a spirit has,
</p>
<p>in sundry instances, been manifested by the Federal Government, to enlarge ita
</p>
<p>powers by forced constructions of the constitutional charter which defines them ;
</p>
<p>and that indications have appeared of a design to expound certain general phrases
</p>
<p>(which having been copied from the very limited grant of powers in the former
</p>
<p>Articles of Confederation, were the less liable to be misconstrued) so as to destroy
</p>
<p>the meaning and effect of the particular enumeration which necessarily explains
</p>
<p>and limits the general phrases, and so as to consolidate the States hy degrees into
</p>
<p>one sovereignty, the obvious tendency and inevitable result of which would be, to
</p>
<p>tra&sform the present republican system of the United States Into an absolute, or
</p>
<p>at best, a mixed monarchy.
</p>
<p>Thf^t the General Assembly doth particularly protest against the palpable and
</p>
<p>alarming infractions of the Constitution, In the two late cases of the " Alien and
</p>
<p>Sedition Acts," passed at the last session of Congress ; the first of which exercises
</p>
<p>a power nowhere delegated to the Federal Government, and which, by uniting
</p>
<p>legislative and judicial powers to those of the executive, subverts the general
</p>
<p>principles of free government, as well as the particular organization and positive
</p>
<p>provisions of the Federal Constitution ; and the other of which acts exercises, in
</p>
<p>like manner, a power not delegated by the Constitution, but, on the contrary, ex-
</p>
<p>pressly and positively forbidden by one of the amendments thereto ; a power
</p>
<p>which, more than any other, ought to produce universal alarm, because it is lev-
</p>
<p>eled against the right of freely examining public characters and measures, and of
</p>
<p>free communication among the people thereon, which has ever been justly deemed
</p>
<p>the only eflfectual guardian of every other right.
</p>
<p>That this State having by its Convention, which ratified the Federal Constitution,
</p>
<p>expressly declared, that among other essential rights, " the liberty of conscience
</p>
<p>ind the press cannot be canceled, abridged, restrained, or modified by any autho-
</p>
<p>rity of the United States," and from its extreme anxiety to guard these rights from
</p>
<p>every possible attack of sophistry or ambition, having with other States recom-
</p>
<p>mended an amendment for that purpose, which amendment was, in due time, an-

</p>
<p>nexed to the Constitution, it would mark a reproachful inconsistency and criminal
</p>
<p>degeneracy, if an indifference were now*shown to the most palpable violation of
</p>
<p>one of the rights, tlius declared and secured ; and to the establishment of a prece-
</p>
<p>dent which may be fatal to the other.
</p>
<p>That the good people of this Commonwealth having ever felt, and continuing to
</p>
<p>feel, the most sincere affection for their brethren of the other States, the truest
</p>
<p>anxiety for establishing and perpetuating the Union of all, and the most scrupu-
</p>
<p>lous fidelity to that Constitution which is the pledge of mutual friendship and the
</p>
<p>instrument of mutual happiness, the General Assembly doth solemnly appeal to
</p>
<p>the like dispositions in the other States, in confidence that they will concur with
</p>
<p>this Commonwealth In declaring, as it does hereby declare, that the acts aforesaid
</p>
<p>are unconstitutional ; and that the necessary and proper measures will be taken
</p>
<p>toy each for co-operating with this State, in maintaining, unimpaired, the authori-
</p>
<p>ties rights and liberties, reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.
</p>
<p>That the Governor be desired to transmit a copy of the foregoing resolutions to
</p>
<p>MR. MADISONS DEFENSE 553
</p>
<p>the executive authority of each of the other States, with a request that the same
</p>
<p>iay be communicated to the Legislatures thereof; and that a copy be furnished
</p>
<p>to eacli of the Senators and Representatives representing this State in the Con-
</p>
<p>gress of the United States.
</p>
<p>These resolves -were sent out to the States accompanied by an Ad-
</p>
<p>dress, prepared also by Madison, setting forth the reasons for their adop-
</p>
<p>tion and urging responses from the several States. None of the States
</p>
<p>responded favoralily to the resolutions, but, on the contrary, Maryland,
</p>
<p>Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. New York, Connecticut, Rhode
</p>
<p>Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont disavowed the
</p>
<p>doctrine set up of a right in the State Legislatures to decide upon the
</p>
<p>validity of acts of Congress. The reply of Massachusetts, likewise, main-
</p>
<p>tained the constitutionality of the Alien and Sedition Laws as being
</p>
<p>justified by the exigency of the moment, and by the power of Congress to
</p>
<p>provide for the common defense.
</p>
<p>JA:MES MADISON'S DEFENSE.
</p>
<p>Throughout all of Madison's career, from the date of his service as
</p>
<p>President up to his decease, he wrote powerfully to combat the heresies
</p>
<p>of secession and nullification. His published works (Congressional
</p>
<p>edition) contain numerous papers valuable as expositions of the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution, of the power of Congress, of the Judiciarj^, &c. Did we not
</p>
<p>know that he was the author of the Virginia Resolutions of '98, and of
</p>
<p>the Address accompanying them, we should give them double weight as
</p>
<p>authority.
</p>
<p>In a letter to Nicholas P. Trist, not given in the " Madison Papers,"
</p>
<p>we have the ex-President's views directly on the issues excited by South
</p>
<p>Carolina's attitude of nullification, in 1832, and also his own interpre-
</p>
<p>tation of the Virginia resolves. We quote this letter in order to place
</p>
<p>before our readers Madison's defense of himself and Jeflferson against
</p>
<p>the construction placed upon their '98 labors by the opponents of the
</p>
<p>State Rights dogmas,
</p>
<p>MoNTPELiER, Dec. 23d, 1832.

<p>pers. There is in one of them some interesting views of the doctrine of secession,
</p>
<p>among which, one that had occurred to me, and which for the first time I have
</p>
<p>seen in print ; namely, that if one State can at will withdraw from the others, the
</p>
<p>others can withdraw from her, and turn her, nolentem volentem, out of the Union.
</p>
<p>Until of late there is not a State that would have abhorred such a doctrine more
</p>
<p>than South Carolina, or more dreaded an application of it to herself. The same
</p>
<p>may be said of the doctrine of nullification, which she now preaches as the only
</p>
<p>doctrine by which the Union can be saved.
</p>
<p>I partake of the wonder that the men you name should view secession in the
</p>
<p>554 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>light mentioned. The essential difference between a free government and govern
</p>
<p>ments not free, is, that the former is founded in compact, the parties to which are
</p>
<p>mutually and equally bound by it. Neither of tliem, therefore, can have a greater
</p>
<p>right to break off from the bargain than the other or others have to hold him to it.
</p>
<p>And certainly there is nothing iu the Virginia resolutions of '98 adverse to tliis
</p>
<p>principle, which is that of common sense and common justice. The fallacy which
</p>
<p>draws a different conclusion from them, lies in confounding a single party with the
</p>
<p>parties to the constitutional c ompact of the United States. The latter having
</p>
<p>made the compact, may do what they will with it. The former, as one of the par-
</p>
<p>ties, owes fidelity to it till released by consent, or absolved by an intolerable abuse
</p>
<p>of the power created. In the Virginia resolutions and report, the plural number
</p>
<p>(States) is in every instance used, whenever reference is made to the authority
</p>
<p>which presided over the Government. As I am now known to have drawn those
</p>
<p>documents, I may say, as I do with a distinct recollection, that it was intentional.
</p>
<p>It was in fact required by the course of reasoning employed on the occasion. The
</p>
<p>Kentucky resolutions, being less guarded, have been more easily perverted. The
</p>
<p>pretext for the liberty taken with those of Virginia is the word " respective" pre-
</p>
<p>fixed to the " rights," &c., to be secured within the States.  Could the abuse of
</p>
<p>the expression have been foreseen or suspected, the form of it would doubtless
</p>
<p>have been varied. But what can be more consistent with common sense, than that
</p>
<p>all having the rights, &c., should unite in contending for the security of them to
</p>
<p>each?
</p>
<p>It is remarkable how closely the nullifiers, who make the name of Mr. Jefferson
</p>
<p>the pedestal for their colossal heresy, close their eyes and lips whenever his autho-
</p>
<p>rity is ever so clearly and emphatically against them. You have noticed * what lie
</p>
<p>Bays in his letters to Monroe and Carrington (p. 43 and 202, vol. 2d) with respect
</p>
<p>to the power of the old Congress to coerce delinquent States ; and his reasons for
</p>
<p>preferring for the purpose a naval to a military force ; and moreover, his remark
</p>
<p>that it was not necessary to find a right to coerce in the Federal articles, that be-
</p>
<p>ing inherent in the nature of a compact. It is high time that the claim to secede
</p>
<p>at will should be put down by the public opinion, and I am glad to see the task
</p>
<p>commenced by one who understands the subject.*
</p>

<p>ESSAGE OF JEFFERSON. 555
</p>
<p>JEFFERSON'S MESSAGE ON BURR'S CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, January 22d, 1807, the President sent in to Congress a
</p>
<p>special message relating to the Conspiracy of Aaron Burr and the action
</p>
<p>taken to bring the Conspirator to justice. It was as follows:
</p>
<p>To the Senate and House of
</p>
<p>Representatives of the United States :
</p>
<p>Agreeably to the request of tlie House of Representatives, communicated in their
</p>
<p>resolution of the 16th instant, I proceed to state under the reserve therein express-
</p>
<p>ed, information received touching an illegal combination of private individuals
</p>
<p>against the peace and safety of the Union, and a military expedition planned by
</p>
<p>them against the territories of a power in amity with the United States, with the
</p>
<p>measures I have pursued for suppressing the same.
</p>
<p>I had for some time been in the constant expectation of receiving such further
</p>
<p>information as would have enabled me to lay before the Legislature the termina-
</p>
<p>tion as well as the beginning and progress of this scene of depravity, so far as it
</p>
<p>has been acted on the Ohio and its waters. From this, the state of safety of the
</p>
<p>lower country might have been estimated on probable grounds ; and the delay
</p>
<p>was indulged the rather, because no circumstance had yet made it necessary to
</p>
<p>call in the aid of the legislative functions. Information, now recently communi-
</p>
<p>cated, has brought us nearly to the period contemplated. The mass of what I
</p>
<p>have received in the course of these transactions, is voluminous ; but little has
</p>
<p>been given under the sanction of an oath, so as to oonstitute formal and legal evi-
</p>
<p>dence. It is chiefly in the form of letters, often containing such a mixture of ru-
</p>
<p>mors, conjectures and suspicions, as renders it difiicult to sift out the real facts,
</p>
<p>and unadvisable to hazard more than general outlines, strengthened by current
</p>
<p>information, on the particular credibility of the relator. In this state of the evi-
</p>
<p>dence, delivered sometimes, too, under the restriction of private confidence, nei-
</p>
<p>ther safety nor justice will permit the exposing names, except that of the principal
</p>
<p>actor, whose guilt is placed beyond question.
</p>
<p>Some time in the latter part of September, I received intimations that designa
</p>
<p>were in agitation in the Western country unlawful and unfriendly to the peace of
</p>
<p>the Union ; and that the prime mover in these was Aaron Burr, heretofore distin-
</p>
<p>guished by the favor of his country. The grounds of these intentions being incon-

</p>
<p>clusive, the objects uncertain, and the fidelity of that country known to be firm,
</p>
<p>it.' For the seeming arrogance of tbis locution, some apology, if not a perfect warrant, will be
</p>
<p>found in the following extract from another letter of Mr. lladison, dated Sept. 23, 1831 :
</p>
<p>" ' Interruptions from my rheumatism, and a succession of less imwelcome guests, have de-
</p>
<p>layed the thauIvS now roudered for your several printed communications ; particularly the pam-
</p>
<p>phlet of Jlr. Everett, and the paper headed '' Nullification Theory." The former is an able and
</p>
<p>well written performance, and will be denied this character by few of the adverse party. If the
</p>
<p>latter does not silence the adversary, the explanation will lie between an impenetrable stupidity
</p>
<p>and an incurable prejudice. I hope the antidote will find its way into the channels which have
</p>
<p>most successfully circulated the poison.' "
</p>
<p>2 This refers to an article on " secession," under the signature " One of the '98 School," which
</p>
<p>had appeared in the Richmond Enquirer a few days before. Mr. Trist was the writer of the
</p>
<p>article.
</p>
<p>556 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>the only measure taken was to urge the informants to use their best endeavors to
</p>
<p>get fill ther insight into the designs and proceedings of the suspected persons, and
</p>
<p>to communicate them to me.
</p>
<p>It was not till the latter part of October, that the objects of the conspiracy be-
</p>
<p>gan to be perceived ; but still so blended and involved in mystery, that nothing
</p>
<p>distinct could be singled out for pursuit. In this state of uncertainty as to the
</p>
<p>crime contemplated, the acts done, and the legal course to be pursued, I thought
</p>
<p>it best to send to the scene, where these things were principally in transaction, a
</p>
<p>person in whose integrity, understanding and discretion, entire confidence could
</p>
<p>be reposed, with instructions to investigate the plots going on, to enter into con-
</p>
<p>ference (for which he had suflScient credentials) with the Governors and all other
</p>
<p>officers, civil and military, and, with their aid, to do on the spot whatever should
</p>
<p>be necessary to discover the designs of the conspirators, arrest their means, brmg
</p>
<p>tlieir persons to punishment, and to call out the force of the country to suppress
</p>
<p>any unlawful enterprise in which it should be found they were engaged. By this
</p>
<p>time it was known that many boats were under preparation, stores of provisions
</p>
<p>collecting, and an unusual number of suspicious characters in motion on the Ohio
</p>
<p>and its waters. Besides dispatching the confidential agent to that quarter, orders
</p>
<p>were at the same time sent to the Governors of the Orleans and Mississippi Terri-
</p>
<p>tories, and to the commanders of the land and naval forces there, to be on their
</p>
<p>guard against surprise, and in constant readiness to resist any enterprise which
</p>
<p>might be attempted on the vessels, posts, or other objects under their care ; and
</p>
<p>on the 8th of November instructions were forwarded to General Wilkinson, to has-
</p>
<p>ten an accommodation with the Spanish commandant on the Sabine, and as soon
</p>
<p>as that was effected, to fall back with his principal force to the hither bank of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, for the defense of the interesting points on that river. By a letter re-
</p>
<p>ceived from that officer on the 25th of November, but dated October 21st, we
</p>
<p>learnt that a confidential agent of Aaron Burr had been deputed to him with com-
</p>
<p>munications, partly written in cypher and partly oral, explaining his designs, ex-
</p>
<p>aggerating his resources, and making such offers of emolument and command, to
</p>
<p>engage him and the army in his unlawful enterprise, as he had flattered himself
</p>
<p>would be successful. The General, with the honor of a soldier and fidelity of a
</p>
<p>good citizen, immediately dispatched a trusty officer to me, with information of

</p>
<p>what had passed, proceeding to establish such an understanding with the Spanish
</p>
<p>commandant on the Sabine, as permitted him to withdraw his force across the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, and to enter on measures for opposing the projected enterprise.
</p>
<p>The General's letter, which came to hand on the 25th of November, as has been
</p>
<p>mentioned, and some other information received a few days earlier, when brought
</p>
<p>together, developed Burr's general designs, different parts of which only had been
</p>
<p>revealed to different informants. It appeared that he contemplated two distinct
</p>
<p>objects, which might be carried on either jointly or separately, and either the one
</p>
<p>or the other first, as circumstances should direct. One of these was the severance
</p>
<p>of the Union of these States by the Alleghany mountains ; the other an attack on
</p>
<p>Mexico A third object was provided, merely ostensible, to wit, the settlement
</p>
<p>of a pretended purchase of a tract of country on the Wachita, claimed by a Baron
</p>
<p>Bastrop. This was to serve as the pretext for all his preparations, an allurement
</p>
<p>for such followers as really wished to acquire settlements in that country, and a
</p>
<p>MESSAGE OF JEFFERSON. 657
</p>
<p>cover under wLicli to retreat in the event of a final discomfiture of both branches
</p>
<p>of liis real design.
</p>
<p>He found at once that the attachment of the Western country to the present
</p>
<p>Union was not to be shaken; that its dissolution could not be effected with tlie
</p>
<p>consent of its inhabitants, and that his resources were inadequate, as yet, to effect
</p>
<p>it by force. He took his course then at once, determined to seize on New Orleans,
</p>
<p>plunder the bank there, possess himself of the military and naval stores, and pro-
</p>
<p>ceed on his expedition to Mexico, and to this object all his means and preparations
</p>
<p>were now directed. He collected from all the quarters where himself or his agents
</p>
<p>possessed influence, all the ardent, restless, desperate and disaffected persons, who
</p>
<p>were ready for any enterprise analagous to their characters. He seduced good
</p>
<p>and well meaning citizens, some by assurances that he possessed the confidence
</p>
<p>of the Government, and was acting under its secret patronage, a pretence which
</p>
<p>procured some credit from the state of our differences with Spain ; and others bj
</p>
<p>offers of land in Bastrop's claim on the Wachita.
</p>
<p>This was tlie state of my information of his proceedings about the last of Novem^
</p>
<p>ber, at which time, therefore, it was first possible to take specific measures to
</p>
<p>meet them. The proclamation of November 27th, two days after the receipt of
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson's information, was now issued. Orders were dispatched to
</p>
<p>every interesting point on the Ohio and Mississippi, from Pittsburg to New Orleans,
</p>
<p>for the employment of such force, either of the regulars or of Ihe militia, and of
</p>
<p>such proceedings also of the civil authorities, as might enable them to seize on all
</p>
<p>the boats and stores provided for the enterprise, to arrest the persons concerned,
</p>
<p>and to suppress, effectually, the further progress of the enterprise. A little before
</p>
<p>the receipt of these orders in the State of Ohio, our confidential agent, who had
</p>
<p>been diligently employed in investigating the conspiracy, had acquired iaformation
</p>
<p>sufficient to open himself to the Governor of that State, and apply for the immedi-
</p>
<p>ate exertion of the authority and power of the State to crush the combination'.
</p>
<p>Governor TiflBn and the Legislature, with a promptitude, an energy, and patriotic
</p>
<p>zeal, which entitle them to a distinguished place in the affection of their sister
</p>
<p>States, effected the seizure of all the boats, provisions, and other prepnrationa
</p>
<p>within their reach, and thus gave a first blow, materially disabling the enterprise
</p>
<p>in its outset.

</p>
<p>In Kentucky a premature attempt to bring Burr to justice, without a sufficient
</p>
<p>evidence for his conviction, had produced a popular impression in his favor, and a
</p>
<p>general disbelief in his guilt. This gave him an unfortunate opportunity of hasten-
</p>
<p>ing his equipments. The arrival of the proclamation and orders, and the applica-
</p>
<p>tion and information of our confidential agent, at length awakened the authorities
</p>
<p>of that State to the truth, and then produced the same promptitude and energy
</p>
<p>of which the neighboring State had set the example. Under an act of their Legis-
</p>
<p>lature, of December 23d, militia was instantly ordered to different important points,
</p>
<p>and measures taken for doing whatever could yet be done. Some boats (accounts
</p>
<p>vary from five to double or treble that number) and persons (differently estimated
</p>
<p>from one to three hundred) had in the mean time passed the Falls of Ohio, to
</p>
<p>rendezvous at the mouth of the Cumberland, with others expected down that
</p>
<p>river.
</p>
<p>Not apprised, till very late, that boats were building on the Cumberland, the
</p>
<p>effect cf the proclamation had been trusted to for some time in the State of Teu-
</p>
<p>69
</p>
<p>558 APPEJ3-t)is-
</p>
<p>hesseB; But, on tlie l9tli of Cecembel-, similar Communications and instructions,
</p>
<p>with those to the neighboring States, were dispatched by express to the Governor,
</p>
<p>and a General officer of the Western division of the State ; and, on the 23d of De-
</p>
<p>cember, our confidential agent left Frankfort for Nashville, to put into activity the
</p>
<p>means of that State also. But, by information received yesterday, I learn that on
</p>
<p>the 23d of December, Mr. Burr descended the Cumberland with two boats merely
</p>
<p>of accommodation, carrying with him from that State no quota toward his unlawful
</p>
<p>enterprise. Whether, after the arrival of the proclamation, of the orders, or of
</p>
<p>our agent, any exertion which could be made by that State, or the orders of the
</p>
<p>Governor of Kentucky for calling out the militia at the mouth of the Cumberland,
</p>
<p>would be in time to arrest these boats, and those from the Falls of the Ohio, is
</p>
<p>still doubtful.
</p>
<p>On the whole, the fugitives from the Ohio, with their associates from Cumber-
</p>
<p>land, or any other place in that quarter, cannot threaten serious danger to the city
</p>
<p>of New Orleans.
</p>
<p>By the same express of December 19th, orders were sent to the Governors of
</p>
<p>Orleans and Mississippi, supplementary to those which had been given on the 25th
</p>
<p>of November, to hold the militia of their Territories in readiness to co-operate, for
</p>
<p>their defense, with the regular troops and armed vessels then under command of
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson. Great alarm, indeed, was excited at New Orleans by the ex-
</p>
<p>aggerated accounts of Mr. Burr, disseminated through his emissaries, of the armies
</p>
<p>and navies he was to assemble there-. General Wilkinson had arrived there him-
</p>
<p>self on the 24th of November, and had immediately put into activity the resources
</p>
<p>of the place, for the purpose of its defense ; and, on the 10th of December, he was
</p>
<p>joined by his troops from the Sabine. Great zeal was shown by the inhabitants
</p>
<p>generally ; the merchants of the place readily agreeing to the most laudable exer-
</p>
<p>tions and sacrifices for manning the armed vessels with their seamen ; and the other
</p>
<p>citizens manifesting unequivocal fidelity to the Union, and a determined spirit of
</p>
<p>resistance to their expected assailants.
</p>
<p>Surmises have been hazarded that this enterprise is to receive aid from certain
</p>
<p>foreign powers. But these surmises are without proof or probability. The wis-
</p>
<p>dom of the measures sanctioned by Congress at its last session, has placed us in
</p>
<p>the paths of peace and justice with the only powers with whom we had any differ-

<p>ences ; and nothing has happened since which makes it either their interest or
</p>
<p>ours to pursue another course. No change of measures has taken place on our
</p>
<p>part ; none ought to take place at this time. With the one, friendly arrangement
</p>
<p>was then proposed, and the law, deemed necessary on the failure of that, was sus-
</p>
<p>pended to give time for a fair trial of the issue. With the same power friendly ar.
</p>
<p>rangement is now proceeding, under good expectations, and the same law deemed
</p>
<p>necessary on failure of that, is still suspended, to give time for a fair trial of the
</p>
<p>issue. With the other, negotiation was in like manner then preferred, and pro-
</p>
<p>visional measures only taken to meet the event of rupture. With the same power
</p>
<p>aegotiation is still preferred, and provisional measures only are necessary to meet
</p>
<p>the event of rupture. While, therefore, we do not deflect in the slightest degree
</p>
<p>from the course we then assumed, and are still pursuing, with mutual consent, to
</p>
<p>restore a good understanding, we are not to impute to them practices as irrecon-
</p>
<p>cilable to interest as to good faith, and changing necessarily the relations of peace
</p>
<p>and justice between us to those of war. These surmises, are, therefore, to be im-

<p>puted to the vauntings of the author of this enterprise, to multiply his partisans by
</p>
<p>magnifying tlie belief of his prospects and support.

<p>By letters from General Wilkinson, of the 14th and 18th of December, which
</p>
<p>came to hand two days after the date of the resolution of the House of Represent-
</p>
<p>atives, that is to say, on the morning of the 18th instant, I received the important
</p>
<p>affidavit, a copy of which I now communicate, with extracts of so much of the let-
</p>
<p>ters as comes within the scope of the resolution. By these it will be seen that of
</p>
<p>three of the principal emissaries of Mr. Burr, whom the General had caused to be
</p>
<p>apprehended, one had been liberated by habeas corptis, and two others, being those
</p>
<p>particularly employed in the endeavor to corrupt the General and Army of the
</p>
<p>United States, have been embarked by him for ports in the Atlantic States, proba-
</p>
<p>bly on the consideration that an impartial trial could not be expected during the
</p>
<p>present agitation of New Orleans, and that that city was not as yet a safe place of
</p>
<p>confinement. As soon as these persons shall arrive, they will be delivered to the
</p>
<p>custody of the law, and left to such course of trial, both as to the place and pro-
</p>
<p>gress, as its functionaries may direct. The presence of the highest judicial authori-
</p>
<p>ties, to be assembled at this place within a few days, the means of pursuing a
</p>
<p>sounder course of proceedings here than elsewhere, and the aid of the Executive
</p>
<p>means, should the judges have occasion to use them, render it equally desirable
</p>
<p>for the criminals as for the public, that, being already removed from the place
</p>
<p>where they were first apprehended, the first regular arrest should take place here,
</p>
<p>and the course of proceedings receive here the proper dii-ection.

<p>The consequences to which this extraordinary defiance of the just authority of

<p>ble for me to hesitate as to my own duty in such an emergency.
</p>
<p>The ordinance had been passed, however, without any certain knowledge of the
</p>
<p>recommendation which, from a view of the interests of the nation at large, the
</p>
<p>Executive had determined to submit to Congress; and a hope was it bulged that,
</p>
<p>by frankly explaining his sentiments, and the nature of those duties which the cri-
</p>
<p>Bis would devolve upon him, the authorities of South Carolina might be indyiced to
</p>
<p>560 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>retrace their steps. In this hope, I determined to issue my proclamation of the
</p>
<p>loth of December last, a copy of which I now lay before Congress.
</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that these reasonable expectations have not been realized,
</p>
<p>and that the several acts of the Legislature of South Carolina, which I now lay be-
</p>
<p>fore you, and which have, all and each of them, finally passed, after a knowledge
</p>
<p>of the desire of the Administration to modify the laws complained of, are too well
</p>
<p>calculated, both in their positive enactments, and in the spirit of opposition which
</p>
<p>they obviously encourage, wholly to obstruct the collection of the revenue within
</p>
<p>the L'-xits of that State.
</p>
<p>Up to this period, neither the recommendation of the Executive in regard to oui
</p>
<p>financial policy and impost system, nor to the disposition manifested by Congress
</p>
<p>promptly to act on that subject, nor the unequivocal expression of the public will,
</p>
<p>in all parts of the Union, appears to have produced any relaxation in the measures
</p>
<p>of opposition adopted by the State of South Carolina ; nor is there any reason to
</p>
<p>hope that the ordinance and laws will be abandoned.
</p>
<p>I have no knowledge that an attempt has been made, or that it is in contempla-
</p>
<p>tion, to reassemble either the convent oner the Legislature; and it will be per-
</p>
<p>ceived that the interval before the 1st of February is too short to admit of the pre-
</p>
<p>liminary steps necessary for that purpose. It appears, moreover, that the State
</p>
<p>authorities are actively organizing their military resources, and providing the
</p>
<p>means, and giving the most solemn assurances of protection and support to all who
</p>
<p>shall enlist in opposition to the revenue laws.
</p>
<p>A recent proclamation of the present Governor of South Carolina has openly de-
</p>
<p>fied the authority of the Executive of the Union, and general orders from the head
</p>
<p>quarters of the State announced his determination to accept the services of volun-
</p>
<p>teers, and his belief that, should their country need their services, they will be
</p>
<p>found at the post of honor and duty, ready to lay down their lives in her defense.
</p>
<p>Under these orders, the forces referred to are directed to " hold themselves in
</p>
<p>readiness to take the field at a moment's warning ;" and in the city of Charleston,
</p>
<p>within a collection district and a port of entry, a rendezvous has been opened for
</p>
<p>the purpose of enlisting men for the magazine and municipal guard. Thus South
</p>
<p>Carolina presents herself in the attitude of hostile preparation, and ready even for
</p>
<p>military violence, if need be, to enforce her laws for preventing the collection of

</p>
<p>the duties within her limits.
</p>
<p>Proceedings thus announced and matured must be distinguished from menaces
</p>
<p>of unlawful resistance by irregular bodies of people, who, acting under temporary
</p>
<p>delusion, may be restrained by reflection, and the influence of public opinion. In
</p>
<p>the present instance, aggression may be regarded as committed whea it is officially
</p>
<p>authorized, and the means of enforcing it fully provided.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, there can be no doubt that it is the determination
</p>
<p>of the authorities of South Carolina fully to carry into effect their ordinance and
</p>
<p>laws after the 1st of February. It therefore becomes my duty to bring the sub-
</p>
<p>ject to the serious consideration of Congress, in order that such measures as they,
</p>
<p>in their wisdom, may deem fit, shall be seasonably provided ; and that it may be
</p>
<p>thereby understood that, while the Government is disposed to remove all just
</p>
<p>cause of complaint, as far as may be practicable consistently with a proper regard
</p>
<p>to the interests of the community at large, it is, nevertheless, determined that the
</p>
<p>apremacy of the laws shall be maintained.
</p>
<p>MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT JACKSON". 561
</p>
<p>In making this communication, it appears to me to be proper not only that 1
</p>
<p>should lay before you the acts and proceedings of South Carolina, but that I should
</p>
<p>also fully acquaint you with those steps which I have already caused to be taken
</p>
<p>for the due collection of the revenue, and with my views of the subject generally,
</p>
<p>that the suggestions which the Constitution requires me to make, in regard to your
</p>
<p>future legislation, may be better understood.
</p>
<p>This subject having early attracted the anxious attention of the Executive, as
</p>
<p>soon as it was probable that the authorities of South Carolina seriously meditated
</p>
<p>resistance to the faithful execution of the revenue laws, it was deemed advisable
</p>
<p>that the Secretary of the Treasury should particularly instruct the officers of the
</p>
<p>United States in that part of the Union as to the nature of the duties prescribed by
</p>
<p>the existing laws.
</p>
<p>Instructions were accordingly issued on the 6th of November to the Collectors
</p>
<p>in that State, pointing out their respective duties, and enjoining upon each a firm
</p>
<p>and vigilant, but discreet performance of them in the emergency then appre-
</p>
<p>hended.
</p>
<p>I herewith transmit copies of these instructions, and of the letter addressed to
</p>
<p>the District Attorney requesting his co-operation. These instructions were dic-
</p>
<p>tated in the hope that, as the opposition to the laws by the anomalous proceeding
</p>
<p>of nullification was represented to be of a pacific nature, to be pursued, substan-
</p>
<p>tially, according to the forms of the Constitution, and without resorting, in any
</p>
<p>event, to force or violence, the measures of its advocates would be taken in con-
</p>
<p>formity with that profession ; and, on such a supposition, the means afforded by
</p>
<p>the existing laws would have been adequate to meet any emergency likely to
</p>
<p>arise.
</p>
<p>It was, however, not possible altogether to suppress apprehehsion of the excess-
</p>
<p>es to which the excitement prevailing in that quarter might lead ; but it certainly
</p>
<p>was not foreseen that the meditated obstruction to the laws would so soon openly
</p>
<p>assume its present character.
</p>
<p>Subsequently to the date of those instructions, however, the ordinance of the
</p>
<p>convention was passed, which, if complied with by the people of that State, must
</p>
<p>eflectually render inoperative the present revenue laws'within her limits.

</p>
<p>This solemn denunciation of the laws and authority of the United States has been
</p>
<p>followed up by a series of acts on the part of the authorities of that State, which
</p>
<p>manifest a determination to render inevitable a resort to those measures of self-
</p>
<p>defense which the paramount duty of the Federal Government requires ; but, upon
</p>
<p>the adoption of which, that State will proceed to execute the purpose it has avow-
</p>
<p>ed in this ordinance, of withdrawing from the Union. * * *
</p>
<p>I transmit a copy of Governor Hamilton's message to the Legislature of South
</p>
<p>Carolina, of Governor Hayne's inaugural address to the same body, as also of his
</p>
<p>proclamation, and a general order of the Governor and commander-in-chief, dated
</p>
<p>the 20th of December, giving public notice that the services of volunteers will be
</p>
<p>accepted under the act already referred to.
</p>
<p>If these measures cannot be defeated and overcome by the power conferred by
</p>
<p>the Constitution on the Federal Government, the Constitution must be considered
</p>
<p>as incompetent to its own defense, the supremacy of the laws is at an end, and the
</p>
<p>rights and liberties of the citizens can no longer receive protection from the Gov-
</p>
<p>562 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>ernment of the Union. They not only abrogate the acts of Congress, commonTy
</p>
<p>called the tariff acts of 1828 and 1832, but they prostrate and sweep away at once
</p>
<p>and without exception, every act, and every part of every act, imposing any
</p>
<p>amount whatever of duty on any foreign merchandise ; and, virtually, every exist-
</p>
<p>ing act which has ever been passed authorizing the collection of the revenue, in-
</p>
<p>cluding the act of 1816, and also, the collection law of 1799, the constitutionality
</p>
<p>of which has never been questioned. It is not only those duties which are charged
</p>
<p>to have been imposed for the protection of manufactures that are thereby repealed,
</p>
<p>but all others, though laid for the purpose of revenue merely, and on articles in no
</p>
<p>degree suspected of being objects of protection. The whole revenue system of
</p>
<p>the United States in South Carolina is obstructed and overthrown ; and the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment is absolutely prohibited from collecting any part of the public revenue
</p>
<p>within the limits of that State. Henceforth, not only the citizens of South Caroli-
</p>
<p>na and of the United States, but the subjects of foreign states, may import any
</p>
<p>description or quantity of merchandise into the ports of South Carolina, without
</p>
<p>the payment of any duty whatsoever. That State is thus relieved from the pay-
</p>
<p>ment of any part of the public burdens, and duties and imposts are not only ren-
</p>
<p>dered not uniform throughout the United States, but a direct and ruinous prefer-
</p>
<p>ence is given to the ports of that State over those of all the other States of the
</p>
<p>Union, in manifest violation of the positive provisions of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>In point of duration, also, those aggressions upon the authority of Congress,
</p>
<p>which, by the ordinance, are made part of the fundamental law of South Carolina,
</p>
<p>are absolute, indefinite, and without limitation. They neither prescribe the period
</p>
<p>when they shall cease, nor indicate any conditions upon which those who have
</p>
<p>thus undertaken to arrest the operation of the laws are to retrace their steps, and
</p>
<p>rescind their measures. They ofier to the United States no alternative but uncon-
</p>
<p>ditional submission. If the scope of the ordinance is to be received as the scale of
</p>
<p>concession, their demands can be satisfied only by a repeal of the whole system
</p>
<p>of revenue laws, and by abstaining from the collection of any duties and imposts
</p>
<p>whatsoever.
</p>
<p>It is true, that in the address to the people of the United States by the Conven-
</p>
<p>tion of South Carolina, after announcing the "fixed and final determination of the
</p>
<p>State in relation to the protecting system," they say " that it remains for us to

</p>
<p>submit a plan of taxation, in which we would be willing to acquiesce, in a liberal
</p>
<p>spirit of concession, provided we are met in due time, and in a becoming spirit, by
</p>
<p>the States interested in manufactures." In the opinion of the convention, an equi-
</p>
<p>table plan would be, that " the whole list of protected articles should be imported
</p>
<p>free of all duty, and that the revenue derived from import duties should be raised
</p>
<p>exclusively from the unprotected articles, or that whenever a duty is imposed upon
</p>
<p>protected articles imported, an excise duty of the same rate shall be imposed upon
</p>
<p>all similar articles manufactured in the United States." The address proceeds to
</p>
<p>state, however, that " they are willing to make a large offering to preserve the
</p>
<p>Union, and with a distinct declaration that it is a concession on our part, we will
</p>
<p>consent that the same rate of duty may be imposed upon the protected articles
</p>
<p>W\at shall be imposed upon the unprotected, provided that no more revenue be
</p>
<p>i.'''?cd than is necessary to meet the demands of the Government for constitutional
</p>
<p>p- )rpose^, and provided also that a duty substantially uniform be imposed upon all
</p>
<p>f /reign imports."
</p>
<p>MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT JACKSON. 6G3
</p>
<p>It is also true, that, in his message to the Legislature, when urging the necessity
</p>
<p>of providing " means of securing their safety by ample resources for repelling
</p>
<p>force by force," the Governor of South Carolina observes that he " cannot but
</p>
<p>think that, on a calm and dispassionate review by Congress, and the functionaries
</p>
<p>of the General Government, of the true merits of this controversy, the arbitration,
</p>
<p>by a call of a convention of all the States, which we sincerely and anxiously seek
</p>
<p>and desire, will be accorded to us."
</p>
<p>From the diversity of terms indicated in these two important documents, taken
</p>
<p>in connection with the progress of recent events in that quarter, there is too much
</p>
<p>reason to afjprehend, without in any manner doubting the intentions of those pub-
</p>
<p>lic functionaries, that neither the terms proposed in the address of the convention,
</p>
<p>nor those alluded to in the message of the Governor, would appease the excite-
</p>
<p>ment which has led to the present excesses. It is obvious, however, that, should
</p>
<p>the latter be insisted on, they present an alternative which the General Govern-
</p>
<p>ment of itself can by no possibility grant, since, by an express provision of the
</p>
<p>Constitution, Congress can call a convention for the purpose of proposing amend-
</p>
<p>ments only " on the application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the States."
</p>
<p>And it is not perceived that the terms presented in the address are more practica-
</p>
<p>ble than those referred to in the message.
</p>
<p>It will not escape attention that the conditions on which it is said, in the address
</p>
<p>of the convention, they " would be willing to acquiesce," form no part of the ordi-
</p>
<p>nance. While this ordinance bears all the solemnity of a fundamental law, is to be
</p>
<p>authoritative upon all within the limits of South Carolina, and is absolute and un-
</p>
<p>conditional in its terms, the address conveys only the sentiments of the convention
</p>
<p>in no binding or practical form ; one is the act of tUe State, the other only the ex-
</p>
<p>pression of the opinion of the members of the convention. To limit the effect of
</p>
<p>that solemn act by any terms or conditions whatever, they should have been em-
</p>
<p>bodied in it, and made of import no less authoritative than the act itself. By the
</p>
<p>positive enactments of the ordinance, the execution of the laws of the Union is ab-
</p>
<p>solutely prohibited; and the address offers no other prospect of their being again
</p>
<p>restored, even in the modiiied form proposed, than what depends upon tlie impro-
</p>
<p>bable contingency, that, amid changing events and increasing excitement, tlie
</p>
<p>sentiments of the present members of the convention, and of their successors, will

</p>
<p>remain the same.
</p>
<p>It is to be regretted, however, that these conditions, even if they had been offer-
</p>
<p>ed in the same binding form, are so undefined, depend upon so many contingencies,
</p>
<p>and are so directly opposed to the known opinions and interests of the great body
</p>
<p>of the American people, as to be almost hopeless of attainment. The majority of
</p>
<p>the States and of the people will certainly not consent that the protecting duties
</p>
<p>shall be wholly abrogated, never to be re-enacted at any future time, or in any
</p>
<p>possible contingency. As little practicable is it to provide that " the same rate of
</p>
<p>duty shall be imposed upon the protected articles that shall be imposed upon the
</p>
<p>unprotected ;" which, moreover, would be severely oppressive to the poor, and,
</p>
<p>in time of war, would add greatly to its rigors. And though there can be no ob
</p>
<p>jection to the principle, properly understood, that no more revenue shall be raised
</p>
<p>than is necessary for the constitutional purposes of the Government, which prin-
</p>
<p>cipal has been already recommended by the Executive as the true basis of taxa-
</p>
<p>564 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>lion, yet it is very certain that South Carolina alone cannot be permitted to decide
</p>
<p>W'liat these constitutional purposes are. * * *  * #
</p>
<p>By these various proceedings, therefore, the State of South Carolina has forced
</p>
<p>the General GovM-nment unavoidably, to decide the new and dangerous alternative
</p>
<p>of permitting a State to obstruct the execution of the laws within its limits, or see-
</p>
<p>ing it attempt to execute a threat of withdrawing from the Union. That portion
</p>
<p>of the people at present exercising the authority of the State, solemnly assert
</p>
<p>their right to do either, and as solemnly announce their determination to do one or
</p>
<p>tlie other.
</p>
<p>In my opinion, both purposes are to be regarded as revolutionary in their char-
</p>
<p>acter and tendency, and subversive of the supremacy of the laws and of the integ-
</p>
<p>rity of the Union. The result of each is the same ; since a State in which, by a
</p>
<p>usurpation of power, the constitutional authority of the Federal Government is
</p>
<p>openly defied and set aside, wants only the form to be independent of the Union.
</p>
<p>The right of a people of a single State to absolve themselves at will, and without
</p>
<p>the consent of the other States, from their most solemn obligations, and hazard the
</p>
<p>liberties and happiness of the millions composing this Union, cannot be acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged. Such authority is believed to be utterly repugnant both to the principles
</p>
<p>upon which the General Government is constituted, and to the objects which it is
</p>
<p>expressly formed to attain.
</p>
<p>Against all acts which may be alleged to transcend the constitutional power of
</p>
<p>the Government, or which may be inconvenient or oppressive in their operation,
</p>
<p>the Constitution itself has prescribed the modes of redress. It is the acknowledged
</p>
<p>attribute of free institutions, that, under them, the empire of reason and law is
</p>
<p>substituted for the power of the sword. To no other source can appeals for sup-
</p>
<p>posed wrongs be made, consistently with the obligations of South Carolina; to no
</p>
<p>other can such appeals be made with safety at any time ; and to their decisions,
</p>
<p>when constitutionally pronounced, it becomes the duty, no less of the public au-
</p>
<p>thorities than of the people, in every case to yield a patriotic submission.
</p>
<p>That a State, or any other great portion of the people, suffering under long and
</p>
<p>intolerable oppression, and having tried all constitutional remedies without the
</p>
<p>hope of redress, may have a natural right, when their happiness can be no other-
</p>
<p>wise secured, and when they can do so without greater injury to others, to absolve

</p>
<p>themselves from their obligations to the Government, and appeal to the last resort,
</p>
<p>needs not, on the present occasion, be denied.
</p>
<p>The existence of this right, however, must depend upon the causes which may
</p>
<p>justify its exercise. It is the ultima ratio, which presupposes that the proper ap-
</p>
<p>peals to all other means of redress have been made in good faith, and which can
</p>
<p>never be rightfully resorted to unless it be unavoidable. It is not the right of the
</p>
<p>State, but of the individual, and of all the individuals in the State. It is the right
</p>
<p>of mankind generally to secure, by all the means in their power, the blessings of
</p>
<p>liberty and happiness ; but when, for these purposes, any body of men have vol-
</p>
<p>untarily associated themselves under a particular form of Government, no portion
</p>
<p>of them can dissolve the association without acknowledging the correlative right
</p>
<p>in the remainder to decide whether that dissolution can be permitted consistently
</p>
<p>with the general happiness. In this view, it is a right- dependent upon the power
</p>
<p>to enforce it. Such a right, though it may be admitted to pre-exist, and cannot
</p>
<p>be wholly surrendered, is necessarily subjected to limitations in aU free govern-

</p>
<p>ments, and in compacts of all kinds, freely and voluntarily entered into, and in which
</p>
<p>the interest and welfare of the individual become identified with those of the com-
</p>
<p>munity of which he is a member. In compacts between individuals, however
</p>
<p>deeply they may affect their relations, these principles are acknowledged to create
</p>
<p>a sacred obligation ; and in compacts of civil government, involving the liberties
</p>
<p>and happiness of millions of mankind, the obligation cannot be less.
</p>
<p>Without adverting to the particular theories to which the Federal compact has
</p>
<p>given rise, both as to its formation and the parties to it, and without inquiring
</p>
<p>whether it be merely federal, or social, or national, it is sufficient that it must be
</p>
<p>admitted to bo a compact, and to possess the obligations incident to a compact ;
</p>
<p>to be " a compact by which power is created on the one hand, and obedience ex-
</p>
<p>acted on the other ; a compact freely, voluntarily and solemnly entered into by
</p>
<p>the several States, and ratified by the people thereof, respectively ; a compact by
</p>
<p>which the several States, and the people thereof, I'espectively, have bound them-
</p>
<p>selves to each other, and to the Federal Government, and by which the Federal
</p>
<p>Government is bound to the several States, and to every citizen of the United
</p>
<p>States." To this compact, in whatever mode it may have been done, the people
</p>
<p>of South Carolina have freely and "'^luntarily given their assent : and to the whole
</p>
<p>and every part of it, they are, -ap^u every principle of good faith, inviolably bound.
</p>
<p>Under this obligation they are bound, and should be required to contribute their
</p>
<p>portion of the public expense, and to submit to all laws made by the common con-
</p>
<p>sent, in pursuance of the Constitution, for the common defense and general wel-
</p>
<p>fare, until they can be changed in the mode which the compact has provided for
</p>
<p>the attainment of those great ends of the Government and the Union. Nothing
</p>
<p>less than causes which would justify revolutionary remedy, can absolve the people
</p>
<p>from this obligation ; and for nothing less can the Government permit it to be done
</p>
<p>without violating its own obligations, by which, under the compact, it is bound to
</p>
<p>the other States, and to every citizen of the United States.
</p>
<p>These deductions plainly flow from the nature of the Federal compact, which is
</p>
<p>one of limitations, not only upon the powers originally possessed by the parties
</p>
<p>thereto, but also upon those conferred on the Government, and every department
</p>
<p>thereof. It will be freely conceded that, by the principles of our system, all power
</p>
<p>is vested in the people ; but to be exercised in the mode, and subject to the checks

</p>
<p>which the people themselves have prescribed. These checks are, undoubtedly,
</p>
<p>only different modifications of the same great popular principle which lies at the
</p>
<p>foundation of the whole, but are not, on that account, to be loss regarded or less
</p>
<p>obligatory.
</p>
<p>Upon the power of Congress, the veto of the Executive, and the authority of the
</p>
<p>Judiciary, which is to extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, and laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, are the obviou3
</p>
<p>checks; and the sound action of public opinion, with the ultimate power of amend-
</p>
<p>ment, is the salutary and only limitation upon the powers of the whole.
</p>
<p>However it may be alleged that a violation of the compact, by the measures of
</p>
<p>the Government, can affect the obligations of the parties, it cannot even be pre-
</p>
<p>tended that such violation can be predicated of those measures until all the consti-
</p>
<p>tutional remedies shall have been fully tried. If the Federal Government exercise
</p>
<p>powers not warranted by the Constitution, and immediately affecting individuals, it
</p>
<p>will scarcely be denied that the proper remedy is a recourse to the judiciary. Such,

</p>
<p>undoubtedly, is the remedy for those who deem the acts of Congre;53 laying duties
</p>
<p>and imposts, and providing for their collection, to be unconstitutional. The whole
</p>
<p>operation of such laws is upon the individuals importing the merchandise. A State
</p>
<p>is absolutely prohibited from laying imposts or duties on imports or exports, with-
</p>
<p>out the consent of Congress, and canuot become a party, under these laws, without
</p>
<p>importing in her own name, or wrongfully interposing her authority against them
</p>
<p>By thus interposing, however, she cannot rightfully obstruct the operation of the
</p>
<p>laws upon individuals. For their disobedience to, or violation of, the laws, the
</p>
<p>ordinary remedies through the judicial tribunals would remain. And in a case
</p>
<p>where an individual should be prosecuted for any offense against the laws, he could
</p>
<p>not set up, in justification of his act, a law of the State, which, being unconstitu-
</p>
<p>tional, would therefore be regarded as null and void. The law of a State cannot
</p>
<p>authorize the commission of a crime against the United States, or any other act
</p>
<p>which, according to the supreme law of the Union, would be otherwise unlawful.
</p>
<p>And it is equally clear, that, if there be any case in which a State, as such, is af-
</p>
<p>fected by the law beyond the scope of judicial power, the remedy consists in ap-
</p>
<p>peals to the people, either to effect a change in the representation, or to procure
</p>
<p>relief by an amendment of the Constitution. But the measures of the Government
</p>
<p>are to be recognized as valid, and, consequently, supreme, until these remedies
</p>
<p>shall have been effectually tried; and any attempt to subvert those measures, or
</p>
<p>to render the laws subordinate to State authority, and, afterwards, to resort to
</p>
<p>constitutional redress, is worse than evasive. It would not be a proper resistance
</p>
<p>to " a Government of unlimited powers," as has been sometimes pretended, but
</p>
<p>unlawful opposition to the very limitations on which the harmonious action of the
</p>
<p>Government, and all its parts, absolutely depends. South Carolina has appealed
</p>
<p>to none of these remedies, but, in effect, has defied them all. While threatening
</p>
<p>to separate from the Union, if any attempt be made to enforce the revenue laws
</p>
<p>otherwise than through the tribunals of the country, she has not only appealed in
</p>
<p>her own name to those tribunals which the Constitution has provided for all cases
</p>
<p>in law or equity arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, but
</p>
<p>has endeavored to frustrate the proper action on her citizens, by drawing the cog-
</p>
<p>nizance of cases under the revenue laws to her own tribunals, specially prepared
</p>
<p>and fitted for the purpose of enforcing the acts passed by the State to obstruct

<p>those laws, and both the judges and jurors of which will be bound, by the import
</p>
<p>of oaths previously taken, to treat the Constitution and laws of the United States
</p>
<p>in this respect as a nullity. Nor has the State made the proper appeal to public
</p>
<p>opinion, and to the remedy of amendment. For, without waiting to learn whether
</p>
<p>the other States will consent to a convention, or, if they do, will construe or amend
</p>
<p>the Constitution to suit her views, she has, of her own authority, altered the import
</p>
<p>of that instrument, and given immediate effect to the change. In fine, she has set
</p>
<p>her own will and authority above the laws, has made herself arbiter iu her own
</p>
<p>cause, and has passed at once over all intermediate steps to measures of avowed

<p>resistance, which, unless they be submitted to, can be enforced only by the

<p>sword.

<p>In deciding upon the course which a high sense of duty to all the people of the

<p>United States imposes upon the authorities of the Union, in this emergency, it can-

<p>MESSAGE OF PEESIDEJST T JACKSON". 567
</p>
<p>Misrule and oppression, to warrant tlie disruption of the free institutions of the
</p>
<p>Union of these States, should be great and lasting, defying all other remedy. For
</p>
<p>causes of minor character, the Government coutd not submit to such a catastrophe
</p>
<p>without a violation of its most sacred obligations to the other States of the Union
</p>
<p>who have submitted their destiny to its hands.
</p>
<p>There is, in the present instance, no such cause, either in the degree of misrule
</p>
<p>or oppression complained of, or in the hopelessness of redress by constitutional
</p>
<p>means. The long sanction they have received from the proper authorities, and
</p>
<p>from the people, not less than the unexampled growth and increasing prosperity
</p>
<p>of so many millions of freemen, attest that no such oppression as would justify or
</p>
<p>even palliate such a resort, can be justly imputed either to the present policy or
</p>
<p>past measures of the Federal Government. The same mode of collecting duties,
</p>
<p>and for the same general objects, which began with the foundation of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and which has conducted the country, through its subsequent steps, to its
</p>
<p>present enviable condition of happiness and renown, has not been changed. Tax-
</p>
<p>ation and representation, the great principle of the American Eevolution, have
</p>
<p>continually gone hand in hand ; and at all times, and in every instance, no tax of
</p>
<p>any kind, has been imposed without their participation ; and in some instances
</p>
<p>which have been complained of, with the express assent of a part of the Ecpre-
</p>
<p>sentatives of South Carolina in the councils of the Government. Up to the present
</p>
<p>period, no revenue has been raised beyond the necessary wants of the country and
</p>
<p>the authorized expenditures of the Government. And as soon as the burden of the
</p>
<p>public debt is removed, those charged with the administration have promptly re-
</p>
<p>commended a corresponding reduction of revenue.
</p>
<p>That this system, thus pursued, has resulted in no such oppression upon South
</p>
<p>Carolina, needs no other proof than the solemn and ofiBcial declaration of the late
</p>
<p>Chief Magistrate of that State, in his address to the Legislature. In that he says,
</p>
<p>that " the occurrences of the past year, in connection with our domestic concerns,
</p>
<p>are to be reviewed with a sentiment of fervent gratitude to the Great Disposer of
</p>
<p>human events ; that tributes of grateful acknowledgment are due for the various
</p>
<p>and multiplied blessings he has been pleased to bestow on our people ; that abun-
</p>
<p>dant harvests, in every quarter of the State, have crowned the exertions of agri-
</p>
<p>cultural labor ; that health, almost beyond former precedent, has blessed our

</p>
<p>homes ; and that there is not less reason for thankfulness in surveying our social
</p>
<p>condition." It would, indeed, be difficult to imagine oppression where, in the so-
</p>
<p>cial condition of a people, there was equal cause of thankfulness as for abundant
</p>
<p>harvests, and varied and multiplied blessings with which a kind Providence had fa-
</p>
<p>vored them.
</p>
<p>Independently of these considerations, it will not escape observation that South
</p>
<p>Carolina still claims to be a component part of the Union ; to participate in the
</p>
<p>national councils, and to share in the public benefits, without contributing to the
</p>
<p>public burdens ; thus asserting the dangerous anomaly of continuing in an associa-
</p>
<p>tion without acknowledging any other obligation to its laws than what depends
</p>
<p>upon her own will.
</p>
<p>In this posture of affairs, the duty of the Government seems to be plain. It in-
</p>
<p>culcates a recognition of that State as a member of the Union, and subjects her to
</p>
<p>itfl authority ; a vindication of the just power of the Constitution : tke presorvatioa
</p>
<p>568 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>of the integrity of tlie Union ; and the execution of the laws by all constitutional
</p>
<p>means.
</p>
<p>The Constitution, which his oath of oflSce obliges him to support, declares that
</p>
<p>the P]xecutive ' shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed," and in pro-
</p>
<p>viding that he shall, from time to time, give to Congress information of the state
</p>
<p>of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall
</p>
<p>judge necessary and expedient, imposes the additional obligation of recommending
</p>
<p>to Congress such more eflScient provision for executing the laws as may, from time
</p>
<p>to time, be found requisite.
</p>
<p>The same instrument confers on Congress the power not merely to lay and col-
</p>
<p>lect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the com-
</p>
<p>mon defense and general welfare, but " to make all laws which shall be necessary
</p>
<p>and proper for carrying into effect the foregoing powers, and all other powers
</p>
<p>vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any de-
</p>
<p>partment or officer thereof ;" and also to provide for calling forth the militia for
</p>
<p>executing the laws of the Union. In all cases similar to the present, the duties of
</p>
<p>the Government become the measure of its powers ; and whenever it fails to exer-
</p>
<p>cise a power necessary and proper to the discharge of the duty prescribed by the
</p>
<p>Constitution, it violates the public trusts not less than it would in transcending its
</p>
<p>proper limits. To refrain, therefore, from the high and solemn duties thus enjoin-
</p>
<p>ed, however painful the performance may be, and thereby tacitly permit the right-
</p>
<p>ful authority of the Government to be contemned, and its laws obstructed by a sin-
</p>
<p>gle State, would neither comport with its own safety, nor the rights of the great
</p>
<p>body of the American people.
</p>
<p>It being thus shown to be the duty of the Executive to execute the laws by all
</p>
<p>constitutional means, it remains to consider the extent of those already at his dis-
</p>
<p>posal, and what it may be proper further to provide.
</p>
<p>In the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury to the collectors in South
</p>
<p>Carolina, the provisions and regulations made by the act of 1799, and also the fines,
</p>
<p>penalties and forfeitures, for their enforcement, are particularly detailed and ex-
</p>
<p>plained. It may be well apprehended, however, that these provisions may prove
</p>
<p>inadequate to meet such an open, powerful, organized opposition, as is to be com-
</p>
<p>menced after the 1st of February next.

</p>
<p>Subsequently to the date of these instructions, and to the passage of the ordi-
</p>
<p>nance, information has been received, from sources entitled to be relied on, that,
</p>
<p>owing to the popular excitement in the State, and the effect of the ordinance de-
</p>
<p>claring the execution of the revenue laws unlawful, a sufficient number of persons,
</p>
<p>in whom confidence might be placed, could not be induced to accept the office of
</p>
<p>inspector, to oppose with any probability of success, the force which will, no doubt,
</p>
<p>be used when an attempt is made to remove vessels and their cargoes from the
</p>
<p>custody of the officers of the customs ; and, indeed, that it would be impracticable
</p>
<p>for the collector, with the aid of any number of inspectors whom he may be autho-
</p>
<p>rized to employ, to preserve the custody against such an attempt.
</p>
<p>The removal of the custom house from Charleston to Castle Pinckney was deem-
</p>
<p>ed a measure of necessary precaution ; and though the authority to give that di-
</p>
<p>rection is not questioned, it is nevertheless apparent that a similar precaution can-
</p>
<p>not be observed in regard to the ports of Georgetown and Beaufort, each of which,
</p>
<p>MESS AGE OF PRESIDENT JACKSON. 569
</p>
<p>nndcr the present laws, remains a port of entry, and exposed to tlie obstructions
</p>
<p>meditated in tliat quarter.
</p>
<p>In considering the best means of avoiding or of preventing the apprehended ob-
</p>
<p>struction to the collection of the revenue, and the consequences which may ensue,
</p>
<p>it would appear to be proper and necessary, to enable the ofiBcers of the customs
</p>
<p>to preserve the custody of vessels and their cargoes, which, by the existing laws,
</p>
<p>they are required to take, until the duties to which they are liable shall be paid or
</p>
<p>secured. The mode by which it is contemplated to deprive them of 'that custody,
</p>
<p>is the process of replevin, and that of capias in withernam, in the nature of a distress
</p>
<p>from the State tribunals organized by the ordinance.
</p>
<p>Against the proceeding in the nature of a distress, it is not perceived that the
</p>
<p>collector can interpose any resistance whatever ; and against the process of reple-
</p>
<p>vin authorized by the law of the State, he, having no common law power, can only
</p>
<p>oppose such inspectors as he is by statute authorized, and may find it practicable
</p>
<p>to employ ; and these, from the information already adverted to, are shown to be
</p>
<p>wholly inadequate.
</p>
<p>The respect which that process deserves must, therefore, be considered.
</p>
<p>If the authorities of South Carolina had not obstructed the legitimate action of
</p>
<p>the courts of the United States, or if they had permitted the State tribunals to ad-
</p>
<p>minister the law according to their oath under the Constitution, and the regulations
</p>
<p>of the laws of the Union, the General Government might have been content to look
</p>
<p>to them for maintaining the custody, and to encounter the other inconveniences
</p>
<p>arising out of the recent proceedings. Even in that case, however, the process of
</p>
<p>replevin from the courts of the State would be regular and unauthorized. It has
</p>
<p>been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that the courts of the
</p>
<p>United States have exclusive jurisdiction of all seizures made on land or water for
</p>
<p>a breach of the laws of the United States, and any intervention of a State authori-
</p>
<p>ty, which, by taking the thing seized out of the hands of the United States officer,
</p>
<p>might obstruct the exercise of this jurisdiction, is imlawful; that, in such case, tlie
</p>
<p>court of the United States having cognizance of the seizure, may enforce a re-de-
</p>
<p>Uvery of the thing by attachment or other summary process ; that the question un-
</p>
<p>der such a seizure, whether a forfeiture has been actually incurred, belongs exclu-
</p>
<p>sively to the courts of the United States, and it depends on the final decree whether
</p>

</p>
<p>the seizure is to be deemed rightful or tortuous ; and that not until the seizure be
</p>
<p>finally judged wrongful, and without probable cause, by the courts of the United
</p>
<p>Btates, can the party proceed at common law for damages in the State courts.
</p>
<p>But by making it " unlawful for any of the constituted authorities, whether of the
</p>
<p>United States or of the State, to enforce the laws for the payment of duties, and
</p>
<p>declaring that all judicial proceedings which shall be hereafter had in affirmance of
</p>
<p>the contract made with purpose to secure the duties imposed by the said acts, are,
</p>
<p>and shall be, held utterly null and void," she has, in effect, abrogated the judicial
</p>
<p>tribunals within her limits in this respect  has virtually denied the United
</p>
<p>States access to the courts established by their own laws, and declared it unlawful
</p>
<p>for the judges to discharge those duties which they are sworn to perform. In lieu
</p>
<p>of these, she has substituted those State tribunals already adverted to, the judges
</p>
<p>whereof are not merely forbidden to allow an appeal, or permit a copy of their
</p>
<p>record, but are previously sworn to disregard the laws of the Union, and enforce
</p>
<p>those only of South CaroUna; and thus deprived of the function essential to the
</p>
<p>570 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>judicial character, of inquiring into the validity of the law, and the rigK^ of the
</p>
<p>matter, become merely ministerial instruments in aid of the concerted obstruction
</p>
<p>of the laws of the Union.
</p>
<p>Neitlier the process nor authority of these tribunals, thus constituted, can be
</p>
<p>respected, consistently with the supremacy of the laws, or the rights and security
</p>
<p>of the citizen. If they be submitted to, the protection duc'from the Government
</p>
<p>to its officers and citizens is withheld, and there is, at once, an end, not only to the
</p>
<p>laws, but to the Union itself.
</p>
<p>Against such a force as the sheriff may, and which, by the replevin law of South
</p>
<p>Caralina, it is his duty to exercise, it cannot be expected that a collector can re-
</p>
<p>tain his custody with the aid of the inspectors. In such case, it is true, it would
</p>
<p>be competent to institute suits in the United States courts against those engaged
</p>
<p>in the unlawful proceeding; or the property might be seized for a violation of the
</p>
<p>revenue laws, and, being libelled in the proper courts, an order might be made for
</p>
<p>its redelivery, which would be committed to the marshal for execution. But, in
</p>
<p>that case, the fourth section of the act, in broad and unqualified terms, makes it
</p>
<p>the duty of the sheriff "to prevent such recapture or seizure, or to redeliver the
</p>
<p>goods, as the case may he," " even under any process, order or decrees, or other
</p>
<p>pretext, contrary to the true intent and meaning of the ordinance aforesaid." It
</p>
<p>is thus made the duty of the sheriflf to oppose the process of the courts of the United
</p>
<p>States ; and, for that purpose, if need be, to employ the whole power of the coun-
</p>
<p>ty ; and the act expressly reserves to him all power which, independently of its
</p>
<p>provisions, he could have used. In this reservation, it obviously contemplates a
</p>
<p>resort to other means than those particularly mentioned.
</p>
<p>It is not to be disguised that the power which it is thus enjoined upon the sheriS
</p>
<p>to employ, is nothing less than the posse comitatus, in all the rigor of the ancient
</p>
<p>common law. This power, though it may be used against unlawful resistance to
</p>
<p>judicial process, is, in its character, forcible, and analogous to that conferred upon
</p>
<p>the marshals by the act of 1795. It is, in fact, the embodying of the whole mass
</p>
<p>of the population, under the command of a single individual, to accomplish, by
</p>
<p>their forcible aid, what could not be effected peaceably, and by the ordinary means.
</p>
<p>It may properly be said to be the relict of those ages in which the laws could be
</p>
<p>defended rather by physical than moral force, and, in its origin, was conferred upon

</p>
<p>the sheriffs of England to enable them to defend their country against any of the
</p>
<p>King's enemies when they came into the land, as well as for the purpose of execut-
</p>
<p>ing process. In early and less civilized times, it was intended to include " the aid
</p>
<p>and attendance of all knights and others who were bound to have harness." It
</p>
<p>includes the right of going with arms and militai-y equipment, and embraces larger
</p>
<p>classes and greater masses of population than can be compelled by the laws of
</p>
<p>most of the States to perform militia duty. If the principles of the common law
</p>
<p>are recognized in South Carolina, (and from this act it would seem they are,) the
</p>
<p>power of summoning the^osse comitatus will compel, under the penalty of fine and
</p>
<p>imprisonment, every man over the age of fifteen, and able to travel, to turn out at
</p>
<p>the call of the sheriff, and with such weapons as may be necessary ; and it may
</p>
<p>justify beating, and even killing, such as may resist. The use of the posse comitaim
</p>
<p>is, therefore, a direct application of force, and cannot be otherwise regarded than
</p>
<p>as the employment of the whole militia force of the country, and in an equally ef-

<p>MESSAGE OF PRESIDED T JACKSON. 571
</p>
<p>ficient form under a different name. No proceeding which resorts to this power,
</p>
<p>to ihe extent contemplated by the act, can be properly denominated peaceable.
</p>
<p>The act of South Carolina, however, does not rely altogether upon this formida-
</p>
<p>ble remedy. For even attempting to resist or obey  though by the aid only of the
</p>
<p>ordinary oflScers of the customs  the process of replevin, the collector and all con-
</p>
<p>cerned are subjected to a further proceeding, in the nature of a distress of their
</p>
<p>personal effects ; and are, moreover, made guilty of a misdemeanor, and liable to
</p>
<p>be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand, nor more than five thousand
</p>
<p>dollars, and to imprisonment not exceeding two years, and not less than six months;
</p>
<p>and even for attempting to execute the order of the court for retaking the proper-
</p>
<p>ty, the marshal, and all assisting, would be guilty of a misdemeanor, and liable to
</p>
<p>a fine of not less than three thousand dollars, nor more than ten thousand, and to
</p>
<p>imprisonment not exceeding two years, nor less than one ; and, in case the goods
</p>
<p>should be retaken under such process, it is made the absolute duty of the sheriff
</p>
<p>to retake them.
</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed that, in the face of these penalties, aided by the power-
</p>
<p>ful force of the county, which would doubtless be brought to sustain the State
</p>
<p>officers, either that the collector would retain the custody in the first instance, or
</p>
<p>that the marshal could summon suSicient aid to retake the property, pursuant to
</p>
<p>the order or other process of the court.
</p>
<p>It is, moreover, obvious that in this conflict between the powers of the officers
</p>
<p>of the United States and of the State, (unless the latter be passively submitted to,)
</p>
<p>the destruction to which the property of the officers of the customs would be ex-
</p>
<p>posed, the commission of actual violence, and the loss of lives, would be scarcely
</p>
<p>avoidable.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, and the provisions of the act of South Carolina, the
</p>
<p>execution of the laws is rendered impracticable even through the ordinary judicial
</p>
<p>tribunals of the United States. There would certainly be fewer difficulties, and
</p>
<p>less opportunity of actual collision between the officers of the United States and
</p>
<p>of the State, and the collection of the revenue would be more effectually secured
</p>
<p> if indeed it can be done in any other way  by placing the custom-house beyond
</p>
<p>the immediate power of the county.
</p>
<p>For this purpose, it might be proper to provide that whenever, by any unlawful

<p>ticable faithfully to collect the duties, the President of the United States should be
</p>
<p>authorized to alter and abolish such of the districts and ports of entry as should be
</p>
<p>necessary, and to establish the custom-house at some secure place within some
</p>
<p>port or harbor of such State ; and, in such cases, it should be the duty of the col-
</p>
<p>lector to reside in such place, and to detain all vessels and cargoes until the duties
</p>
<p>imposed by law should be secured or paid in cash, deducting interest ; that in
</p>
<p>such cases it should be unlawful to take the vessel and cargo from the custody of
</p>
<p>the proper officer of the customs, unless by process from the ordinary judicial tri-
</p>
<p>bunals of the United States ; and that, in case of an attempt otherwise to take the
</p>
<p>property by a force too great to be overcome by the officers of the customs, it
</p>
<p>should be lawful to protect the possession of the officers by the employment of the
</p>
<p>land and naval forces, and militia, under provisions similar to those authorized by
</p>
<p>the 11th section of the act of the 9th of January, 1809.
</p>
<p>This provision, however, would not shield the officers and citizens of the United

<p>States, acting under the laws, from suits and prosecutions, in the tribunals of the
</p>

</p>
<p>it would be insufficient to insure a proper respect to the process of the constitu-
</p>
<p>tional tribunals in prosecutions for offenses against the United States, and to pro-
</p>
<p>tect tlie authorities of the United States, whether judicial or ministerial, in the per-
</p>
<p>formance of their duties. It would, moreover, be inadequate to extend the protec-
</p>
<p>tion due from the Government to that portion of the people of South Carolina,
</p>
<p>against outrage and oppression of any kind, who may manifest their attachment,
</p>
<p>and yield obedience to the laws of the Union.
</p>
<p>It may, therefore, be desirable to review, with some modifications betted adapt-
</p>
<p>ed to the occasion, the Gth section of the act of the 3d of March, 1815, which expir-
</p>
<p>ed on the 4th of March, 1817, by the limitation ot that of the 27th of April, 1816 ;
</p>
<p>and to provide that, in any case, where suit shall be brought against any individu-
</p>
<p>al in the courts of the State, for any act done under the laws of the United States,
</p>
<p>he should be authorized to remove the said cause, byp*tition, into the circuit court
</p>
<p>of the United States, without any copy of the record, s-xxd that the courts should
</p>
<p>proceed to hear and determine the same as if it had been originally instituted there-
</p>
<p>in. And that in all cases of injuries to the persons or property of individuals for
</p>
<p>disobedience to the ordinance, and laws of South Carolina m pursuance thereof,
</p>
<p>redress may be sought in the courts of the United States. It may be expedient,
</p>
<p>also, by modifying the resolution of the 3d of March, 1791, to authorize the mar-
</p>
<p>shals to make the necessary provision for the safe keeping of prisoners committed
</p>
<p>under the authority of the United States.
</p>
<p>Provisions less than these, consisting, as they do, for the mo.t part, rather of a
</p>
<p>revival of the policy of former acts called for by the existing emergency, than of
</p>
<p>the introduction of any unusual or rigorous enactments, would not cause the laws
</p>
<p>of the, Union to be properly respected or enforced. It is believed these would
</p>
<p>prove inadequate, unless the military forces of the State of South Carolina autho-
</p>
<p>rized by the late act of the Legislature, should be actually embodied and called out
</p>
<p>in aid of their proceedings, and of the provisions of the ordinance generally. Even
</p>
<p>in that case, however, it is believed that no more will be necessary than a few
</p>
<p>iiiodificatious of its terms, to adapt the act of 1795 to the present emergency, as, by

<p>tliat act, the provisions of the law of 1792 were accommodated to the crisis then
</p>
<p>existing ; and by conferring authority upon the President to give it operition dur-
</p>
<p>ing the session of Congress, and without the ceremony of a proclamation, whenever
</p>
<p>it shall be ofScially made known to him by the authority of any State, pt by the
</p>
<p>courts of the United States, that, within the limits of such State, the laws of the
</p>
<p>United States will be openly opposed, and their execution obstructed, by the ac-
</p>
<p>tual eraploymout of military force, or by any unlawful means whatsoerer, too
</p>
<p>great to be otherwise overcome.
</p>
<p>In closing this communication, I should do injustice to my own feelings no', to ex-
</p>
<p>press my confident reliance upon the disposition of each department of the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment to perform its duty, and to co-operate iu all measures necessary in the

<p>cessary, than in preserving the good order of society, and in the maintenance of
</p>
<p>well-regulated liberty.
</p>
<p>WhiJe a forbearing spirit may, and I trust will, be exercised towards the errors
</p>
<p>of our brethren in a particular quarter, duty to the rest of the Union demands that
</p>
<p>open and organized resistance to the laws should not be executed with impunity.
</p>
<p>The rich inheritance bequeathed by our fathers has devolved upon us the sacred
</p>
<p>obligation of preserving it by the same virtues which conducted thsm through the
</p>
<p>eventful scenes of the Revolution, and ultimately crowned their struggles with the
</p>
<p>noblest model of civil institutions. They bequeathed to us a Government of laws,
</p>
<p>and a Federal Union founded upon the great principle of popular representation.
</p>
<p>After a successful experiment of forty-four years, at a moment when the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment and the Union are the objects of the hopes of the friends of civil liberty
</p>
<p>throughout the world, and in the midst of public and individual prosperity unex-
</p>
<p>ampled in history, we are called to decide whether these laws possess any force,
</p>
<p>and that Union the means of self-preservation. The decision of this question by aa
</p>
<p>enlightened and patriotic people cannot be doubtful. For myself, fellow-citizena,
</p>
<p>devoutly relying upon that kind Providence which has hitherto watched over our
</p>
<p>destinies, and actuated by a profound reverence for those institutions I have so
</p>
<p>much cause to love, and for the American people, whose partiality honored me
</p>
<p>with their highest trust, I have determined to spare no effort to discharge the duty
</p>
<p>which, in this conjuncture, is devolved upon me. That a similar spirit will actuate
</p>
<p>the representatives of the American people, is not to be questioned; and I fervent-
</p>
<p>ly pray that the Great Ruler of nations may so guide your deliberations, and our
</p>
<p>joint measures, as that they may prove salutary examples, not only to the present,
</p>
<p>but to future times ; and solemnly proclaim that the Constitution and the laws are
</p>
<p>supreme, and the Union indissoluble.

</p>
<p>Preamble.  Whereas, Slavery, throughout its entire existence in the United
</p>
<p>States, is none other than the most barbarous, unprovoked and unjustifiable war
</p>
<p>of one portion of its citizens against another portion, the only conditions of which
</p>
<p>are perpetual imprisonment and hopeless servitude, or absolute extermination, in

<p>REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE (U. S. SENATE) ON
</p>
<p>THE HxiRPER'S FERRY AFFAIR.
</p>
<p>As stated (page 545) the reports of the Committee appointed to in-
</p>
<p>vestigate the Harper's Ferry scheme of John Brown, were presented to
</p>
<p>the Senate June 15th, The majority rejjort, signed by Messrs. Mason,
</p>
<p>Davis and Fitch, was a very lengthy document. Only its conclusion
</p>
<p>need here be cited. We quote :
</p>
<p>Upon the whole testimony, there can be no doubt that Brown's plan was to
</p>
<p>coumience a servile war on the borders of Virginia, which he expected to extend,
</p>
<p>and which he believed his means and resources were sufficient to extend through
</p>
<p>that State and throughout the entire South. Upon being questioned, soon after
</p>
<p>his capture, by the Governor of Virginia, as to his plans, he rather indignantly re-
</p>
<p>pelled the idea that it was to be limited to collecting and protecting the slaves
</p>
<p>nutil they could be sent out of the State as fugitives. On the contrary, he vehe-
</p>
<p>mently insisted that his purpose was to retain them on the soil, to put arms in their
</p>
<p>hands, with which he came provided for the purpose, and to use them as his sol-
</p>
<p>diery. (Pp. 61, 62.)

</p>
<p>This man (Brown) was uniformly spoken of, by those who seemed best to have
</p>
<p>known him, as of remarkable reticence in his habits, or, as they expressed it,
</p>
<p>" secretive." It does not appear that he intrusted even his immediate followers
</p>
<p>with his plans, fully, even after they were ripe for execution. Nor have the com-
</p>
<p>mittee been enabl^ed clearly to trace knowledge of them to any. The only excep-
</p>
<p>tion would seem to be in the instance of the anonymous letter received by the
</p>
<p>Secretary of War in the Summer preceding the attack, referred to in his testimo-
</p>
<p>ny. The Secretary shows that he could get no clue to the writer ; nor were the
</p>
<p>committee enabled in any way to trace him. Considering that the letter was anon-
</p>
<p>ymous, as well as vague and apparently incoherent in its statements, it was not at
</p>
<p>all rpTTiarkable, in the opinion of the committee, th.it it did not arrest the attention
</p>
<p>ol the officer to whom it was addiessed.
</p>
<p>g78 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>The point chosen for the attack seems to have been selected from the twofold
</p>
<p>inducement of the security afforded the invaders by a mountain country, and the
</p>
<p>large deposit of arms in the arsenal of the United States there situated. It result-
</p>
<p>ed in the murder of three most respectable citizens of the State of Virginia -.vith-
</p>
<p>out cause, and in the like murder of an unoffending free negro. Of the military
</p>
<p>force brought against them, one marine was killed, and one wounded ; whilst
</p>
<p>eight of the militia and other forces of the neighborhood were wounded, with more
</p>
<p>or less severity, in the several assaults made by them.
</p>
<p>Of the list of" insurgents" given in Colonel Lee's report, (fourteen whites and
</p>
<p>five negroes,) Brown, Stevens and Coppic, of the whites, with Shields, Green and
</p>
<p>Copeland, of the negroes, captured at the storming of the engine house, were sub-
</p>
<p>sequently executed in Virginia, after judicial trial ; as were also John E. Cook and
</p>

</p>
<p>livered up for trial to the authorities of Virginia^making in all seven thus execut-
</p>
<p>ed. It does not seem to have been very clearly ascertained how many of the
</p>
<p>party escaped. Brown stated that his party consisted of twenty-two in number.
</p>
<p>Seven were executed, ten were killed at the Ferry : thus leaving five to be ac-
</p>
<p>counted for. Pour of these five, it is believed, were left on the Maryland side in
</p>
<p>charge of the arms when Brown crossed the river, and who could not afterwards
</p>
<p>join him ; leaving but one, who, as it would appear is the only survivor of the
</p>
<p>party who accompanied Brown across the bridge, and whose escape is not ac-
</p>
<p>counted for.
</p>
<p>The committee, after much consideration, are not prepared to suggest any legis-
</p>
<p>lation, which, in their opinion, would be adequate to prevent like occurrences in
</p>
<p>the future. The only provision in the Constitution of the United States Afhich
</p>
<p>would seem to import any authority in the Government of the United States lo in-
</p>
<p>terfere on occasions affecting the peace or safety of the States, are found in the
</p>
<p>eighth section of the first article, among the powers of Congress " to provide for
</p>
<p>calling for the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and
</p>
<p>repel invasions ;" and in the fourth section of the fourth article, in the following
</p>
<p>words: " The United States shall guaranty to every State in this Union a republi-
</p>
<p>can form of Government, and shall protect each of them against invasion, and, on
</p>
<p>the application of the Legislature or of the Executive, (when the Legislatni-e can

</p>
<p>would seem to import an*invasion by the public force of a foreign power, or (if
</p>
<p>not so limited and equally referable to an invasion by one State of another) still it
</p>
<p>would seem that public force, or force exercised under the sanction of acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged political power, is there meant. The invasion (to call it so) by Brown and
</p>
<p>his followers at Harper's Ferry, was in no sense of that character. It was simply
</p>
<p>the act of lawless ruffians, under the sanction of no public or political authority-
</p>
<p>distinguishable only from ordinary felonies by the ulterior end in contemplation
</p>
<p>by them, and by the fact that the money to maintain the expedition, and the large
</p>
<p>arm&ment they brought with them, had been contributed and furnished by the
</p>
<p>citizens of other States of the Union, under circumstances that must continue to
</p>
<p>jeopard the safety and peace of the Southern States, and against which Congress
</p>
<p>has no power to legislate.

</p>
<p>peace of the Union, if not from fraternal feeling, do ilot hold it incumbent on them
</p>
<p>REPORT OF COMMITTEE. 579
</p>
<p>after the experience of the country, to guard in future by appropriate legislation
</p>
<p>against occurrences similar to the one here inquired into, the committee can find
</p>
<p>no guaranty elsewhere for the security of peace between the States of the Union.
</p>
<p>So far, however, as the safety of the public property is involved, the committee
</p>
<p>would earnestly recommend that provision should be made by the Executive, or
</p>
<p>if necessary, by law, to keep under adequate military guard the public armories
</p>
<p>and arsenals of the United States, in some way after the manner now practiced at
</p>
<p>the navy yards and forts.
</p>
<p>Before closing their report, the committee deem it proper to state that four per-
</p>
<p>sons summoQed as witnesses, to wit : John Brown, jr., of Ohio, James Redpatli, of
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, Frank B. Sanborn, of Massachusetts, and Thaddeus Hyatt, of New
</p>
<p>York, failing or refusing to appear before the committee, warrants were issued by
</p>
<p>order of the Senate for their arrest. Of these, Thaddeus Hyatt only was arrested ;
</p>
<p>and on his appearance before the Senate, till refusing obedience to the suminons
</p>
<p>of the committee, he was, by order of the Senate, committed to the jail of the Dis-
</p>
<p>trict of Columbia. In regard to the others, it appeared^ by the return of the mar-
</p>
<p>shal of the northern district of Ohio, as deputy of the Sergeant-at-Arms, that John
</p>
<p>Brown, jr., at first evaded the process of the Senate, and afterwards, with a num-
</p>
<p>ber of other persons, armed themselves to prevent his arrest. The marshal further
</p>
<p>reported in his return that Brown could not be arrested unless he was authorized
</p>
<p>in like manner to employ force. Sanborn was arrested by a deputy of the Ser-
</p>
<p>geant-at-Arms, and afterwards released from custody by the Judges of the Su-
</p>

<p>This truly NATIONAL WORK (characterized by a leading Jour-
</p>

</p>
<p>as the History, par excellence, of the Great Eebellion. It has received
</p>
<p>(as will be seen by reference to the letters and notices subjoined) the
</p>
<p>endorsement of the leading men and the leading journals of the coun-
</p>
<p>try. It is commended by those most qualified to judge, as such a Re-
</p>
<p>cord of the Rise, Progress, and Results of the War for the Union as
</p>
<p>EVERY INTELLIGENT CITIZEN SHOULD POSSESS.

<p>As each volume cotains more letter-press than any two volumes of other pro-

</p>
<p>Letter of Gov. E. D. Morgan, of New York.
</p>
<p>Sir : I have examined the second number of your " History of the Southern Rebellion," and I
</p>
<p>take pleasure in saying that it fully justifies the favorable opinion I had formed of the work
</p>
<p>from the first number.
</p>
<p>It is gratifying to know that competent hands have undertaken the delicate task of separating
</p>
<p>the true historical material from the immense mass ef printed matter which now flnds its way,
</p>
<p>through a thousand channels, to the public, and presenting it in a connected form convenient
</p>
<p>for present reference. Your publication, it seems to me, unites this with many other excelloucies.

<p>I am, very respectfully yours, E. D. MORGAN.

</p>
<p>Dear Sir : I have exammed the first number of your History of the Rebellion in the Soutnem
</p>
<p>States, and I consider it a publication of great value. Prepared immediately after the evsnts
</p>
<p>and occurrences it is intended to record, no important paper or essential fact is likely to be inst;
</p>
<p>and I sincerely hope tbe encouragement it receives from the public will ensure its continuance
</p>
<p>to the termination of the contest. I am, respectfully yom's, JOHN. A. DE.

<p>Letter of Gov. John A. Andrew, of Massaclmsetts,
</p>
<p>Dear Sm : I thank you for calling my attention to your history of the rise and progress of tlie
</p>
<p>Southern Kebellion. I have examined the pages of the first monthly part with some care, and
</p>
<p>have formed a very favorable opinion, not only of the plan of the work, but of the mauuur in
</p>
<p>which it is to be executed. Such a condensation of facts, and presentation of official docunnnls,
</p>
<p>relating to the present war, cantiot fail to be of great present interest and utility, and in future
</p>
<p>years will be invaluable to all who will wish to study the details of the great conspiracy against
</p>
<p>constitutional liberty and the rights of humanitv.

</p>
<p>Dear Sir : My engagements bave not permitted more than a hasty glance at -your " History
</p>
<p>gf the Sduthern Rebellion," but I am very much pleased with its general plan and the style ot
</p>
<p>Its puffclication. Such a work deserves, and, I think, cannot fail to meet with a gteat circu-
</p>
<p>lation. Very respectfully yours, A. G. CUKTIN.

<p>Letter of Hon. Edward Everett, of Boston.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir : I have looked cursorily over the first number of the monthly edition of the history
</p>
<p>of" The Southern Rebellion," and formed a favoi-able opinion of the plan and exiX-ution of the
</p>
<p>work. Respectfully yours, EDWARD EVERETT.
</p>
<p>Letter of Hon. N. P. Tallmadge.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir : 1 have read with attention seven numbers of your history of " The Southern Re-
</p>
<p>bellion." The plan of the work is admirable; the matter is selected with much care, and the
</p>
<p>narrative by which it is connected displays great judgment and ability. As a book of reference
</p>
<p>it is almost indispensable to the professional man and the statesman; and as a mere history it
</p>
<p>ought to be in the bands of every loyal citizen of the United States. There can nowhere else be
</p>
<p>found so true and succinct an account of this, the most stupendous, the most causeless, as well
</p>
<p>u the most infamous Rebellion ever known in the annals of the world.
</p>
<p>Very truly yours, N. P. TALLMADGE.
</p>
<p>Letter of Hon. John Sherman, of Ohio.
</p>
<p>Sir : I have carefully read the first number of your history of the Rise and Progress of the
</p>
<p>present Rebellion. I heartily approve of your undertaking.
</p>
<p>A carefully prepared record of the events connected with the present war will not only be of
</p>
<p>value now, but wiU be an Important magazine of facts for future historians. The history of this
</p>
<p>rebeUiou will hereafter be read with as much interest as, and will be regarded as of even great-
</p>
<p>er importance than that of the Pi-ench Revolution.
</p>
<p>Your work has already been of great servibo to me as a text-book, for dates of important
</p>
<p>events. Your Historical Summary is alone worth more than the whole cost of your book.
</p>
<p>Every intelligent reader will have occasion to refer to it to revive bis recollection.
</p>
<p>I therefore trust that you will receive such a liberal share of patronage as will justify you in
</p>
<p>executmg your plan. I am, very truly yours, JOHN SHERMAN.
</p>
<p>Letter of Gov. Wm. A. Buckingham, of Connecticut.
</p>
<p>Sir : I am in receipt of two num()ers of " The History of the Southern Rebellion," which pre-
</p>
<p>sent a concise view of events connected with our political and governmental history as they are
</p>
<p>now passing. I think it will prove a valuable record for future reference.

<p>Letter of Gov. Erastus Fairbanks, of Vermont.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir : I have received the first and second monthly numbers of yow " History of the
</p>
<p>Southern Rebellion," and have much pleasure in recommending it as a work of invaluable im-
</p>
<p>portance to every American citizen.
</p>
<p>The publication is timely, and the design excellent. It is thus far a graphic and truthful re-
</p>
<p>cord of the transactions and events preceding and connected with the rebellion, a convenient
</p>
<p>manual for present reference, and an important text for future historians.

<p>Respectfully yours, ERASTUS FAIRBANKS,

<p>Letter of Gov. N. S. Berry, of Wev? Hampshire.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir : By your politeness I have received the first and second numbers of your History
</p>
<p>of the Rebellion in the Southern States, and have devoted such attention to the work us my
</p>
<p>many duties at present will permit. I am deeply impressed with the importance, style and ex-'
</p>
<p>ecution of the same. As a history and text-book of dates of important events it must meet with
</p>
<p>great favor by an intelligent people. I hope you^wiU meet with such patronage and support as
</p>
<p>wm warrant you in the full prosecution of the work.

<p>Letter of Hon. S. S. Cox, of Ohio.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir : I have examined, with some critical care, the first number of your " Rebellion
</p>
<p>History." During the pendency of the matter described, and in the midst of the scenes por-
</p>
<p>trayed, I was a witness of what has transpired and which you have placed in enduring record.
</p>
<p>I think the design as patriotic and valuable, as the execution is creditable and truthful. In ar-
</p>
<p>rangement, style and matter, you certainly have been very felicitous.
</p>
<p>Yours, &c., S. S. COX.

<p>From a rapid examination of it, I am sure it will bo an invaluable record of the most import-
</p>
