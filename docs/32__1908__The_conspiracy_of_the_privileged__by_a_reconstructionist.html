<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>If, after the perusal of the following pages, the reader
</p>
<p>should come to the conclusion that the society in which he
</p>
<p>lives is like an illegal poolroom under the protection of the
</p>
<p>police, let him not be discouraged, but rather bring forth the
</p>
<p>best that is within him to work for a nobler society.
</p>
<p>The above comparison befits the situation. The windows
</p>
<p>announce the sale of bird seed, tobacco and pigeons. Upon
</p>
<p>entering, though, you find a lot of square-chinned gents en-
</p>
<p>gaged in betting on the fortunes of the people; the cues in
</p>
<p>their hands are the faith and the ignorance of the masses; the
</p>
<p>pigeons sold to customers are caught by watchers on the roof
</p>
<p>as soon as a buyer gives them the freedom to fly. If you re-
</p>
<p>turn to protest, your skull is broken or, if the dealers are
</p>
<p>merciful, you are ejected with threats that cannot be mistaken.
</p>
<p>The writer does not claim that he has said the best that
</p>
<p>may be said of the situation. But he claims that he uses the
</p>
<p>best in his abilities to arouse the reader to thinking and acting.
</p>
<p>Do likewise.

<p>THE SITUATION.
</p>
<p>It has come to such a pass in this land of the free that any utterance
</p>
<p>in favor of freedom is regarded a crime worse than the breaking of the ten
</p>
<p>commandments. For while the ten commandments were given in an advisory
</p>
<p>manner, to wit : thou shalt or thou sh<iU not, the statutes on our penal
</p>
<p>codes interdict free thought and free action in a compulsory way, to wit :
</p>
<p>thou must or thou must not. . . .
</p>
<p>In the last quarter of a century, when all other civilized or semi-civilized
</p>
<p>countries have moved upward to higher aspects of life, our country has
</p>
<p>made itself famous as an example for ignorant legislature. The citizen
</p>
<p>either is incapable of participating in the active work of reconstruction or
</p>
<p>is made indifferent by the cunning and whimsical actions of the politicians,
</p>
<p>while an ever increasing army of officials perplexes and rules him. Thus
</p>
<p>it hapiiens that a man who has not the backing of an influential party behind
</p>
<p>him, to save his personal liberty from the incumbency of jwlice persecution
</p>
<p>must lie low when he utters a word of warning to the persecuted.
</p>
<p>Seemingly, the world at large knows better the value of our inalienable
</p>
<p>rights than we know it ourselves. Dr. Eeden, the Dutch philanthropist and
</p>
<p>sociologist, in a lecture he delivered in New York City, called our common-
</p>
<p>wealth a Common Misery. But less noted men have ridiculed our police-
</p>
<p>ridden communities. We, though, taking examples from our politicians,
</p>
<p>ttand pat and do not learn to distinguish between benevolent criticism and
</p>
<p>malicious slander.
</p>
<p>Just now we are going through a very crucial point in the evolution of
</p>
<p>our destiny. But destiny is not what our rulers are pleased to make of the
</p>
<p>history of the nation, but what we are inclined to put forward by either our
</p>
<p>interest in the make-up of our social and political relations, or our indiffer-
</p>
<p>ence to the policies of our friends or foes.
</p>
<p>Let us clearly discern between the needs of a free people and the actions
</p>
<p>of its rulers. Let us, then, judge the words and actions of our friends,
</p>
<p>and, likewise, our enemies, by their merits or demerits, without prejudice.
</p>
<p>Let us unite in proclaiming our inalienable rights for happiness and general
</p>
<p>welfare, and in condemning the pretenses of the political and social upstarts.
</p>
<p>For we may, with the facts confronting us, declare that the affairs of
</p>
<p>the nation are not governed but the people ruled. The question foremost in

</p>
<p>the minds of the so-called administrators is not how to promote the general
</p>
<p>welfare of the people, but how to keep the majority in subjection while the
</p>
<p>minority is engaged in the division of the natural wealth of the land.
</p>
<p>It matters little under what disguise the politics of this minority are
</p>
<p>shaping themselves, whether under republican, or democratic, or whatever
</p>
<p>cloak. By virtue of their legal entrenchments they hold the rest of the
</p>
<p>nation in subjection. While the administration of the national affairs until
</p>
<p>recently was entirely under the domination of the money market, the ad-
</p>
<p>ministrators gaining their power and prestige from the influence of funds
</p>
<p>lollected by, and in the interest of, the money market, it gradually developed
</p>
<p>.nto semi-dictatorial power through the envious strife among that minority,
</p>
<p>through the imperialist policy of ruling a people without its consent, through
</p>
<p>the fortifying conditions of a greater army and navy until well nigh 56 per
</p>
<p>cent, of national revenue are spent for military purposes. Hand in hand
</p>
<p>with these preparations for a reactionary mode of government goes the
</p>
<p>decline of the popular intelligence, a harder struggle for existence forcing
</p>
<p>multitudes of parents to send their half-starved children to work instead of
</p>
<p>to school, impressing upon the people thus made indolent and hopeless th
</p>
<p>superstition of the paternal government, the influence of the central govern-
</p>
<p>ment to fight their battles against the aggressiveness of the combined forces
</p>
<p>of corporations and legislatures.
</p>
<p>But when a man has come to the conclusion that he no longer can look
</p>
<p>after his own affairs, he shall soon learn that the help he employs will be-
</p>
<p>come his master. A nation consisting of men who deny themselves tht
</p>
<p>capability of doing their own work, learns to obey the commands of one boss.
</p>
<p>Even while these lines are being penned, a high-handed act of the Postal
</p>
<p>Department is agitating the minds of all fair-minded people. A postmaster
</p>
<p>is given plenipotentiary powers in disposing of literature not in accord
</p>
<p>with his political convictions by restricting the permit of second-class matter.
</p>
<p>This institutes a new form of censorship in this country, the equivalent of
</p>
<p>which could only be found in Russia. Monarchical Europe, with the exception
</p>
<p>of the latter, does not interfere with the press in the resi>ective countries.
</p>
<p>A copy containing a seditious article might be confiscated, but the publica-
</p>
<p>tion as such is not interfered with. This encroachment upon the free ex-
</p>
<p>pression of one's opinion is entirely in line with the rest of limitations
</p>
<p>against free assemblage and free speech, and only a sequel to other objection-
</p>
<p>able amendments to the constitution enacted since the inauguration of th
</p>
<p>imperialist i)olicy begotten by the evil spirit of the Hanna Octopus. Quick
</p>
<p>as the monstrous development of governing the people turned into ruling
</p>
<p>it, from disarming the populace to gagging it, we may with due conclusions
</p>
<p>await the formation of barefaced despotism.
</p>
<p>THE VASSALS AND THE TRUSTS
</p>
<p>Take away the interest of the people in the preservation of their insti-
</p>
<p>tutions, and the downfall of the country is a foregone conclusion. Unite

</p>
<p>the wealth of a nation into the hands of a few, and the people become apa-
</p>
<p>thetic to the domestic or international affairs of their rulers.
</p>
<p>Egypt crumbled into dust when 3 per cent, of the population owned
</p>
<p>97 per cent, of all her wealth.
</p>
<p>Babylon, once the greatest city of the world, fell, when 2 per cent, of
</p>
<p>the population owned everything in the Empire, while the i)eople starved.
</p>
<p>^Vhen Persia ceased to exist, the land belonged to 1 per cent, of tht
</p>
<p>entire population.
</p>
<p>Among eighteen hundred men was divided the vast Empire when Rome
</p>
<p>was taken possession of by semi-savage conquerors.
</p>
<p>And yet we remain in the footsteps of these nations, shaping the laws
</p>
<p>in their fashion, treating the i)eople with their methods, moulding society
</p>
<p>in their forms. Are we to evade their fate by building larger navies, keeping
</p>
<p>stronger guards in our cities and establishing more courts, prisons, alms-
</p>
<p>houses, and insane asylums?
</p>
<p>While the land has been taken avray from the people as in the days of the
</p>
<p>ancient countries of Asia and Europe, a new factor arose in our days, that
</p>
<p>took the industries from the workers. The latter find themselves in a situ-
</p>
<p>ation analogous to the system of Feudalism in the middle ages. Their de-
</p>
<p>pendence is such that they must feel grateful for the permit to toil, for
</p>
<p>the chance of thus securing a livelihood for themselves and those relying
</p>
<p>on their supix)rt.
</p>
<p>Homage says the Treaties of Tenure is the most honorable service and
</p>
<p>the most humble service of revenue that a frank tenant may do to his lord,
</p>
<p>for when the tenant shall make homage to his lord, he shall be ungirt and
</p>
<p>his head uncovered, and his lord shall sit and the tenant shall kneel before
</p>
<p>him on both his knees and hold his hands jointly together between the hands
</p>
<p>of his lord, and shall say this : I become your man from this day on forward,
</p>
<p>of life and limb, and of earthly worship, and unto you shall be true and
</p>
<p>faithful, and bear your faith for the treatment that I claim to hold of you,
</p>
<p>saving the faith that I owe to the sovereign lord, the king; and then the
</p>
<p>lord so sitting shall kiss him.
</p>
<p>The conditions to-day are akin to those of the middle ages. The rela-
</p>
<p>tions of the tenant to his lord have given place to those of the toiler to the
</p>
<p>possessor of money and material. A change in nomenclature  a trust for
</p>
<p>a vassaldom, a wageearner for a tenant, a President for a King.
</p>
<p>The cause has been the same  here and there, to wit : The power of
</p>
<p>the few, the subjection of the many ; the growth of vast estates, the ex-
</p>
<p>pansion of poverty ; the subserviency of the aristocracy to the church, or vice
</p>
<p>versa, and the ignorance of the masses. Serfdom had not come over night ;
</p>
<p>it was gradually develoi)ed. The tillers of the soil, at first only tributary
</p>
<p>to the lords holding privileges from the hands of the king, in the course of
</p>
<p>time were robbed of their soil and the means of sustenance, their liberties
</p>
<p>remaining at the mercy of the king's vassals. The privileged aristocracy
</p>
<p>soon became arbitrary masters. The king, to fortify himself against the
</p>
<p>usurpations of his former vassals, had to appeal for aid to the towns them-
</p>
<p>selves hard pressed by the marauding conquerors. But both, the king and
</p>
<p>the vassals, were usurpers ; the king had risen to power through conquest,

</p>
<p>and his followers through his indebtedness to them. It was a question of
</p>
<p>might and privilege, of privilege and might, and by rendering assistance to
</p>
<p>the king, the towns did not mitigate the lot of the tillers of the soil.
</p>
<p>The system of government favoring the possessors of property and pro-
</p>
<p>tecting their interests  as the basic form of a society thus organized  united
</p>
<p>in the hands of a comparatively few the land and the industries of the coun-
</p>
<p>try. The great majority of the people are, if able to enter a contract for
</p>
<p>work, dependent on these iwssessors of money axid material. They are the
</p>
<p>bearers of the heaviest burdens of taxation. For whatever taxes the State
</p>
<p>might impose on the possessors of the means of sustenance, are by them in
</p>
<p>a higher ratio exacted from their dependencies ; so that the real burden of
</p>
<p>taxation falls mainly, although indirectly, on the shoulders of the poor.
</p>
<p>Industrial enterprise and governmental interference have been of mu-
</p>
<p>tual assistance to each other. The civil war and the Spanish-American
</p>
<p>war opened new avenues of exploitation. After each crisis plutocracy gained
</p>
<p>a stronger bold on the wealth of the nation. And in the selection of a Chief-
</p>
<p>Magistrate Wall Street became the main advisor. Thus a mutual under-
</p>
<p>standing had been reached, high finance assit^ting the strengthening of the
</p>
<p>central power, the administration favoring exploitations at home and in the
</p>
<p>colonies by transforming national and international xwlicies. The grip on
</p>
<p>the majority of the people tightened until they awoke one day to face a
</p>
<p>panic. The people have not learned that history repeated itself ; that the
</p>
<p>crisis marked a stepping stone in the evolution of the country's history.
</p>
<p>The Trusts, the modern Vassals, had become all-powerful, and, on the other
</p>
<p>band, the Administration, to save its face, was forced to show its authority.
</p>
<p>For the Trusts to become the absolute masters of the situation it was neces-
</p>
<p>sary to unite the banks, the means of circulation, under their domination
</p>
<p>without fear of any interference by the government and with the sanction of
</p>
<p>Ck>ngress. On the other hand, the lust of power and conquest had seized
</p>
<p>upon the administration and bureaucracy. Favoritism, the menace of all
</p>
<p>republics, and tlie thorn on the declining path of every government, marked
</p>
<p>every utterance of the highest courts and foremost administrators.
</p>
<p>The people, finding themselves in this maze of adversities, clamoring
</p>
<p>for the prosecution of the barefaced criminals at their throats, are ready to
</p>
<p>reach the ear of the man on horseback, always present on the precipice of a
</p>
<p>nation's history. By the old methods of catering to the brutal instincts of
</p>
<p>the mob or of sounding some meaningless high-tuned phrases, the man on
</p>
<p>horseback is trying to endear himself in the hearts of the unthinking masses.
</p>
<p>And thus, as in the days of the feudal system, the dominating political influ-
</p>
<p>ence is seeking to unite with those directly threatened by the lords of exploita-
</p>
<p>tation, in the hope of establishing a preeminent position of its own, that
</p>
<p>would tend to eliminate any signal opposition to its policies. And, as in the
</p>
<p>day of medieval feudalism, the sacrifices by the oppressed people for the
</p>
<p>sake of, seemingly, assured protection against the vassals of special priv-
</p>
<p>ileges, will not bring relief of their burden, but is calculated to strengthen
</p>
<p>the iron hand of the king.
</p>
<p>The period of depression under which we are now laboring is the force-
</p>
<p>ful expression of this fight for supremacy. Who should rule, is the ques-
</p>
<p>tion, and not, how are the affairs of the country to be governed? Shall the
</p>
<p>corporations favoring the continuance of subjecting the people to utter de-

</p>
<p>pendence upon them, frame the laws, as heretofore, with a view to closing
</p>
<p>all channels of individual enterprise, or shall the federal government inau-
</p>
<p>gurate a new mode of rule by which one person may, first and last, direct
</p>
<p>the means which strengthen his hand at the helm?
</p>
<p>The influences favoring the latter possibility are spread all over the
</p>
<p>country. An aristocracy following in the trail of federal absolutism has
</p>
<p>grown from the class of rich idlers, that for one and more generations
</p>
<p>has been aping the fancies of Asiatic or European nobilities. Other families
</p>
<p>are brought up in traditions of militarism and exclusion, fostering snubbery"
</p>
<p>and autocracy. And the great army of government employees, steadily in-
</p>
<p>creasing in numbers with the establishment of new offices, are, as servants
</p>
<p>always will be, tools of their masters.
</p>
<p>PREJUDICE AND PERSECUTION.
</p>
<p>It is self-explanatory that with the growth of power a government
</p>
<p>abrogate the rights and the liberties of the people. For nothing could bet-
</p>
<p>ter stay the progress of whim than the free expression of opinions. What-
</p>
<p>ever, therefore, parades under the banner of refonn emanating from the
</p>
<p>fertile mind of a ruling i>ower, is really repression or persecution. And in
</p>
<p>the review of those reforms wrought by the present administrator one must
</p>
<p>always read persecution for reform.
</p>
<p>"One of the most serious things," said Chancellor Day, November,
</p>
<p>1907, "for us to consider in regard to the administration of President Roose-
</p>
<p>velt, is the fact that he has really accomplished no reforms."
</p>
<p>He is not quite right. He forgot that reform spelled persecution. The
</p>
<p>hysterical messages in regard to immigration gave birth, ultimately, to the
</p>
<p>most stupid laws manufacturing, from year to year, a growino; mass of
</p>
<p>men without a country within the boundaries of the United States. In
</p>
<p>their wake followed curtailments of free speech, free press, free assemblage.
</p>
<p>The press, to a great extent, has raised a howl against the immigrant, like
</p>
<p>a pack of dogs at the command of a hunter. Some of the influential news-
</p>
<p>papers of the country  and it is not necessary to name them, so well are
</p>
<p>they known for their betrayal of peace at home  are openly charged with
</p>
<p>being in the pay of the Russian Government, and, at the behest of that
</p>
<p>mediaeval land of prejudice and persecution, to work in the interests of a
</p>
<p>foreign power. If conspiracy is charged to men who frankly dare oppose
</p>
<p>the whimsical ravings of a vain mind or the conscienceless pens of ill-begotten
</p>
<p>legislatures, what should be said of the men who have taken their oflSces on
</p>
<p>the oath of allegiance to the principles underlying this government and who
</p>
<p>with stealthy methods promote the welfare of the few, or of newspapers in
</p>
<p>secret coalition with foreign rulers? What should they be charged with
</p>
<p>who by suppression and persecution create strife and hatred in the country,
</p>
<p>appealing as it were to the lowest passions of ignorance in whipping one
</p>
<p>class of the working people against the other? In creating in the minds
</p>

<p>the barbarities of prejudices, superstition, and ignorance? Until less than a

</p>
<p>lations governing citizenship been instituted? Surely not in order to keep
</p>
<p>the toilers out, the competitors in the field of labor? For if this had been
</p>
<p>the object of the administration, our officials abroad, taking notice of the
</p>
<p>luring announcements of prosperity in America, as advertised by the agents
</p>
<p>of our manufacturers, could easily prevent the influx of immigration by
</p>
<p>exposing the conspirators abroad. Rather may the object be found in the
</p>
<p>attempt of the dominating influences, to divide in their country the popula-
</p>
<p>tion against itself, to cause strife here among the working class in general,
</p>
<p>and the different nationalities, in particular. For the greater the strife
</p>
<p>among the people, the more justified seems a show of force by the govern-
</p>
<p>ment. But the tighter the grip of force, the weaker sounds the cry for
</p>
<p>liberty.
</p>
<p>It is charged upon the immigrants that assaults on persons in exalted
</p>
<p>positious have been instigated and committed by liiein. Yet, the history of
</p>
<p>the assassinations in this country shows clearly that the committors of those
</p>
<p>untoward acts were all bom and bred in the confines of the United States.
</p>
<p>Johnson, who tried to kill President Jackson, Booth, the assasin of Lincoln,
</p>
<p>Guiteau, who murdered Garfield, Czolgocz, who fired the deadly shots at Mc-
</p>
<p>Kinley, Prendergast, who took it upon himself to mow down Mayor Harri-
</p>
<p>son, were all born in the North American Republic and educated in our
</p>
<p>schools, as were the men who are directly or indirectly responsible for the
</p>
<p>death of Governor Goebel, of Kentucky.
</p>
<p>In view of these facts, is there any justification for laying violence at
</p>
<p>the threshold of the immigrants, was there any lack of violence in the United
</p>
<p>States? Truly, there must be another reason for inciting popular prejudice
</p>
<p>against the newcomers, and, I fear, a reason at once revolting in its con-
</p>
<p>ception, and diabolical in its performance.
</p>
<p>The strategy of every foe of Truth, in dealing with adversities, centres
</p>
<p>on the golden rule of the Roman craftsman. Divide et impera. Gain com-
</p>
<p>mand by causing strife, is to-day no less the acme of wisdom in the actions
</p>
<p>of intrigue than it was two thousand years ago. It is necessary to keep
</p>
<p>the working men in distrust of each other. The distrust is the dam that
</p>
<p>keeps the flood of dissatisfaction from storming the fortress of capitalistic
</p>
<p>outrages. One part of the population is being inflated with its own superior-
</p>
<p>ity, suspicion is awakened in another, both are divided against one another
</p>
<p>by exalting the virtues of one and decrying the shortcomings of the other.
</p>
<p>What the workmen might not know is well understood by the agents
</p>
<p>and counselors of the powers that be. While proportionately the organized
</p>
<p>forces of the workmen are larger in numbers this side of the Atlantic, the
</p>
<p>European workmen have a^ clearer understanding of the questions of the
</p>
<p>day ; while the Americans are brought up to play with thoughts and things,
</p>
<p>or, as Judge Gaynor recently remarked, to think superficially, the Europeans
</p>
<p>excel in earnestness, the only key to thoroughness. In quoting the preamble
</p>
<p>to the Constiution of the Carpenters and Joiners we desire to show the con-
</p>
<p>servative view of labor at home, against whom our courts are so ready with
</p>
<p>injunctions, and our newspapers with invectives :
</p>
<p>"To rescue our trade from the level to which it has fallen, and, by
</p>
<p>mutu<il effort, to raise ourselves to that position in society to tchich we

</p>
<p>are justly entitled; to cultivate a feeling of friendship among the craft, and
</p>
<p>to elevate the moral, intellectual, and social conditions of all journeymen and
</p>
<p>carpenters. It is, furthermore, our object to assist each other to secure em-
</p>
<p>ployment ; to furnish aid in cases of death or permanent disability, and
</p>
<p>for mutual relief, and other benevolent purposes." (Convention of B. C. & J..
</p>
<p>Chicago, III., August 8 1881.)
</p>
<p>While the workmen in the United States are mainly interested in the
</p>
<p>welfare of their individual crafts, as shown above, their European brethren
</p>
<p>take, as a class, an af-tivc part in affairs political and social with a more or
</p>
<p>leas thorough understanding of the ideals of mankind at large. While the
</p>
<p>leaders of our workmen are fraternizing with the oppressors of the toilers,
</p>
<p>in Europe such actions would be looked upon with great suspicion. While
</p>
<p>for some time past it has been the tendency in the progressive states of
</p>
<p>Europe to extend the solitary .strike of a craft into a sympathetic strike of
</p>
<p>the industry, or a general strike of many or all industries, quite in confor-
</p>
<p>mity with the growing mutuality of the manufacturers' associations, the or-
</p>
<p>ganized workers at home rely, in most cases, on their meagre purses or the
</p>
<p>still poorer sympathy of the public. So long as antiquated methods in deal-
</p>
<p>ing with the industrial problem are followed, workmen have no chance of
</p>
<p>getting to what they are justly entitled. Capital, on the contrary, with the
</p>
<p>aid of the civil and military authorities, may dictate its terms as long as the
</p>
<p>individual craft is abandoned in its struggle by other branches directly or in-
</p>
<p>directly related to the cause of discontentment.
</p>
<p>And this is the reason why the laws now governing the regulations of
</p>
<p>immigration and citizenship are made to work in a way to persecute th
</p>
<p>thinking and observing element among the new arrivals, and not to exclude
</p>
<p>competitors on the market. This is the reason why men. of convictions ad-
</p>
<p>verse to the interests of plutocracy are singled out to pay the penalty for
</p>
<p>untoward acts committed by others that are strangers to them in conviction
</p>
<p>and action.
</p>
<p>Repression or suppression do not prevent ; persecution does not reform.
</p>
<p>They force the suppressed and persecuted to methods of greater secrecy, and
</p>
<p>beget hatred. Is such a policy advisable? Or is it rather desirable, in
</p>
<p>dealing with any kind of opposition, to act wisely and frankly with the
</p>
<p>arguments of nobler examples and the knowledge of the need of the
</p>
<p>opposition?
</p>
<p>Every now and then new opinions governing labor and capital emanate
</p>
<p>from our tribunals of justice. Every now and then the courts are appealed
</p>
<p>to in an endeavor to fight objectionable legislatiat). But as such proceedings
</p>
<p>are a question of money and, quite often, of influence, labor is mostly de-
</p>
<p>feated and capital triumphant. In their helplessness the workmen turn to
</p>
<p>petitioning Congress, or even to appealing to the President. They do not
</p>
<p>realize that such appeals weaken the cause of independence. But paternal-
</p>
<p>ism, however hopeless, seems more preferable to the hungry man than star-
</p>
<p>vation. And thus it happens that the very forces whose well-being depend!
</p>
<p>on a decentralized democracy, are working toward strengthening the force*
</p>
<p>of centralization, arming the hands of an individual with concentrated powar,
</p>
<p>or, in other words, popularizing autocracy through paternalism.
</p>
<p>MILITARISM.
</p>
<p>The popular man on horseback has always rested his position on arms.

</p>
<p>The greater a one-man-power, the more visible the show of arms. Where
</p>
<p>democracy is on the decline, militarism is on the increase. And the differ-
</p>
<p>ence between the citizen of the United States and the subject of Russia
</p>
<p>soon becomes one only in name.
</p>
<p>It cannot be argued in defense of military prowess that this hemisphere
</p>
<p>must protect itself against a possible aggression from Asia or Europe. No
</p>
<p>power on the earth would dream of attacking the United States so long as
</p>
<p>the people had any liberties to defend. And no enemy attacks a country
</p>
<p>without an assured possibility in bis knowledge of conditions, of defeating
</p>
<p>a nation. Armies might defeat armies, but not nations. Rome fell because
</p>
<p>it was divided against itself, and the great mass of the people had no interest
</p>
<p>in the preservation of the Empire. The Teutons, thoroughly awakened.
</p>
<p>were victorious in their struggle against Home, because their fight meant
</p>
<p>the liberties of their homes and person. China would be a great and noble
</p>
<p>commonwealth if the reigning dynasty had not put to sleep the intelligence
</p>
<p>of the people. Turkey, built on blood, crumbled to pieces by persecuting the
</p>
<p>people living under the dominion of the Half-Moon. Spain, intolerant in
</p>
<p>her persecution of freedom of thought and specih. in spitf of hor military
</p>
<p>prowess, is seething with discontent and lying in exhaustion. But when the
</p>
<p>France of the Kings was devastated by the English conquerors, the people
</p>
<p>rose to free themselves and, not relying on the royal armies, drove the
</p>
<p>English from the shores of their country. And again, after the defeat of
</p>
<p>Napoleon, when the united armies of Euroi>e were overrunning French soil,
</p>
<p>the irregular forces of the people combated the regular, well-drilled old
</p>
<p>warriors of Russia, England and Prussia. And our own history?
</p>
<p>A nation whose intelligence is kept awake and who has any cause for
</p>
<p>nurturing a love for the country, cannot be conquered, though the regular
</p>
<p>armies, fighting because they must, and not because they want, may be
</p>
<p>defeated.
</p>
<p>Militarism is, therefore, only an accompanyment to restrictions on
</p>
<p>liberty, and a precursor to despotism. It is not only no safeguard against
</p>
<p>any aggression from abroad, but a steady menace to civic justice at home.
</p>
<p>Especially when the majority of the population are not allowed to bear
</p>
<p>arms, an erratic official in an administration that grew strong upon a suc-
</p>
<p>cession of limitations on free speech, on the free expression of the people,
</p>
<p>might, following the examples given in ancient and modern history, use
</p>
<p>the military institution for aggressions on the civic rights of his opposition.
</p>
<p>In fact, where military preparations are made on a large scale, the
</p>
<p>government eo ipso signifies its distrust of the people. But where the
</p>
<p>people can no longer be trusted to uphold their institutions, the authorities
</p>
<p>must have acted in a manner deserving of the suspicion of the people. The
</p>
<p>government, then, surrounds itself with defenders of its policies
</p>
<p>and not with defenders of the will of the people. And if
</p>
<p>it be argued that the people acquiesce in the plans of their govern-
</p>
<p>ment, then may it be said that the people have been brought up in aimless
</p>
<p>acquiescence of the paternalism of blindly chosen superiors. If the minds
</p>
<p>of the people must be supported by those elected to office, the lack of self-

</p>
<p>reliance signifies the inability to elect.
</p>
<p>But, if a duty there be, it is the duty of society to make man self-
</p>
<p>reliant, so he may not become a tool in the hands of the cunning.
</p>
<p>Procreation itself is only in so far to be welcomed as it evolves a noble
</p>
<p>addition to the pride of man. And with the full development of the faculties
</p>
<p>of his species, man assumes the work of selection with self-reliance and ease.
</p>
<p>For, though it has often been cited and in various ways, it must be
</p>
<p>always remembered : Man is not born for government, but government is an
</p>
<p>artificial structure erected by man. Man is more sacred a thing than
</p>
<p>government, and government is sanctified or condemned by the happiness
</p>
<p>or the misery of the people. A government that rests in doubtful peace
</p>
<p>on force, is not the government by the people, but by the few, and is not apt
</p>
<p>to instill into the minds of the masses a love which alone is the safeguard
</p>
<p>of a country's peace.
</p>
<p>Militarism, ttie armed force, means violence sanctified by law. But law
</p>
<p>ought not to sanctify violence in any form since it condemns violence as a
</p>
<p>menace to civic justice. TTie law, therefore, that sanctifies violence as a
</p>
<p>governmental institution, is only pretending to abhor violence so long as it
</p>
<p>justifies the same thing in a certain body of men. If for the sake of defense
</p>
<p>the knowledge of the use of arms be essential, no body of men should be ex-
</p>
<p>empt from learning how to use them and from possessing them. But to
</p>
<p>disarm the population at large and keep a fighting force in their midst,
</p>
<p>must arouse the fears and suspicions of the observer.
</p>
<p>CHURCH AND FREE THOUGHT.
</p>
<p>Militarism is being fostered by the very institutions that profess to
</p>
<p>have at heart the uplifting of man's soul. The minds of the children are
</p>
<p>inculcated with the germ of militarism within the limits of ground that is
</p>
<p>supposed to be made holy by words of the fellowship of man and the god-
</p>
<p>liness of love. The churches of various denominations are resounding with
</p>
<p>discords of bugle calls, with fife and drum. It has become a common usage
</p>
<p>for the authorieties in the various churches to di-aw the children into their
</p>
<p>folds by composing drilling companies and dressing the boys in the uniforms
</p>
<p>of soldiers. Thus, instead of directing the young minds to nobler activities,
</p>
<p>the lowest temptations of savagery are given license to unfold to flaming
</p>
<p>passions. While the education of the children demands the abhorrence of
</p>
<p>violence, the formation of these drilling brigades aids in stifling the charitable
</p>
<p>tendencies in the nature of budding humanity.
</p>
<p>With superstition and prejudice to contend with from infancy, man's
</p>
<p>development is being hamjiered and his intellect chained. But our minds
</p>
<p>must be freed in order to make the forces of nature, known or to be dis-
</p>
<p>covered, subservient to the needs of man, whereas the blind belief in the
</p>
<p>doctrines of the church makes for the subserviencj- of our needs and thoughts
</p>
<p>to fear of natural phenomena. Fatalism is the logical result from the teach-
</p>
<p>ings of doctrinary belief, and religious mania besets the reasoning power
</p>
<p>at all times when natural phenomena are explained by supernatural or un-
</p>
<p>natural interference. The philosophy of Buddhism in' the hands of a priest-
</p>
<p>hood became no less a flageUa on the intellect of the people than the super-
</p>
<p>stitions of mediaeval Europe. The search for truth alone frees the intel-
</p>
<p>lect, and the knowledge of human achievements and of the natural evolution

<p>of things is the only instrument able to withstand the assaults of a priest-
</p>
<p>hood forever working on a science of superstition wherewith the people are
</p>
<p>kept groping in the dark.
</p>
<p>The Rev. John J. Glennon, Archbishop of St. Louis, in attacking the
</p>
<p>schools and universities, made this bid for notoriety :
</p>
<p>"The philosophy taught in your schools and universities today is just
</p>
<p>as hrutal as it is repugnant. This philosophy of evolution, emanating from
</p>
<p>the brain of Darwin and Spencer, makes for brutality and retards progress.
</p>
<p>What is the use of struggling if there is nothing to be attained? Where is
</p>
<p>there an appearance of charity in this system? The strong succeed and the
</p>
<p>weak perish.
</p>
<p>Evolution teaches us that environments shape the nature of man, and
</p>
<p>that man in society is responsible for the shaping of environments. Evolu-
</p>
<p>tion, therefore, excludes the fatalism of blind belief, auC opens the secrets
</p>
<p>of natural phenomena. It bids us strive for environments that may fully
</p>
<p>develop the human intellect and enthrone the noble and just aspirations of
</p>
<p>the brotherhood of mankind. It teaches us that progress is retarded by the
</p>
<p>ignoble interference by the enemies of truth, that while no species destroys its
</p>
<p>own kind, man is forever kept in artificial environments to struggle against
</p>
<p>his own kind, that through the interference of brutal environments man ia
</p>
<p>not permitted to develop along the lines of least resistance.
</p>
<p>Evolution would make man self-reliant ; artificial interference by the
</p>
<p>State or clergy would keep him, bodily and intellectually, dependent.
</p>
<p>Are the Sunday-schools not turned into gloomy chambers of superstition
</p>
<p>and prejudice? The minds of minors are filled with false illustrations
</p>
<p>of the ideals of other denominations or humane associations. In explanation
</p>
<p>of the severe task undertaken by their priests, Catholic teachers serve their
</p>
<p>pupils with horrid tales of their experiences. In treating on the subject of
</p>
<p>Free Masonry, a Sister gives the following narrative :
</p>
<p>A priest is captured in the dead of night by a delegation of that brother-
</p>
<p>hood, who ask him to come with them to take the confession of one of their
</p>
<p>confreres. After walking a short distance they shove him into a waiting
</p>
<p>carriage, blindfold and chain him and drive with him, in zig-zag movements,
</p>
<p>through the winding streets, then get on a ferryboat, and finally land across
</p>
<p>a water at some unknown destination, where he is taken to a big hall.
</p>
<p>Upon being released from chain and kerchief he sees himself in the midst of
</p>
<p>rough and silent men and surrounded by walls covered with crossbones, etc.
</p>
<p>At last the priest is left alone with an old man who confesses that he must
</p>
<p>die because he did not obey the commands of his brothers in Free Masonry,
</p>
<p>to commit murders, although the lot had fallen to him. . . . Horrors !
</p>
<p>Such are the means wherewith Free Thought is to be destroyed.
</p>
<p>And Free Thought? While church property is exempt from taxes,
</p>
<p>while church authorities are given every facility to express themselves and
</p>
<p>to influence communities, while the churches are accumulating riches in
</p>
<p>investments and land, while their slanders are repeated by the press and
</p>
<p>their prejudices are made the keynote in legislative repressions, while th
</p>
<p>infamous Oxford movement is being tried in underhand manner in thit
</p>
<p>country. Free Thought, all Thought not in accord with so-called religioua

<p>teachings, is at the mercy of the policeman's club, and may be prohibited
</p>
<p>if a police commissioner or a postmaster deem it improper.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Moore, during the Prohibitionists' campaign, threatened
</p>
<p>violence to the opponents of prohibition in a blood-curdling language ; but
</p>
<p>the authorities did not interfere with either Rev. Moore nor the campaign.
</p>
<p>Mining workers expressed their intention to strike, and, against the protest
</p>
<p>of a town, except the mining lords, the President ordered troops to the
</p>
<p>scene of dispute, although violence by the workmen was neither shown nor
</p>
<p>feared.
</p>
<p>Why, then, do the civil authorities aid the Church in its struggle with
</p>
<p>the ideals of advanced thinkers or, if you please, with its opponents? Why
</p>
<p>are liberal or radical associations and individuals not given the freedom to ex-
</p>
<p>press their opinions and criticisms in halls made available for such purposes
</p>
<p>and freed from taxes? Why are radical men not permitted to use the open
</p>
<p>squares and the highways of our towns for the presenting to the authorities
</p>
<p> who, by the way, are only suffered by the people, and not God-given 
</p>
<p>of the protest and decision of the masses?
</p>
<p>Supreme Court Justice John W. Gofif stigmatizes the character of the
</p>
<p>police  that are nowadays made the masters of the public  in the followinc;
</p>
<p>words, spoken April 27, to the members of the Riverside and Morningside
</p>
<p>Heights Associations :
</p>
<p>The evil in the force is largely of our own creating. The department
</p>
<p>is the creation of the citizens and they have created what they have. The
</p>
<p>police force of Neio York to day is virtually an oathhound secret society.
</p>
<p>Just think of it! Nearly 10,000 men leagued in a secret organization, th'J
</p>
<p>real object of which is not the performance of duty
</p>
<p>We find every grade organized from the patrolman up to and including
</p>
<p>the inspectors. Each grade has its own society, the ostensible object of
</p>
<p>which is sick benefit and the burial of needy members. If we search the
</p>
<p>records of the Legislature at Albany and the Board of Aldermen in New
</p>
<p>York, we shall find that the real objects are the promotion of the interests
</p>
<p>of individuals without regard to the performance of duty.
</p>
<p>But Mr. Goff is wrong in saying that the citizen is responsible for the
</p>
<p>corruption in the police force. The people have no say in the matter. They
</p>
<p>do not elect the officers or patrolmen. Corruption could only be stamped
</p>
<p>out with a blow at centralization. Only when the citizens of a given terri-
</p>
<p>tory will elect from their own midst, from their residential or mercantile
</p>
<p>neighborhood, men of their own acquaintance for vigilance duty in their
</p>
<p>respective parts of a locality, only with decentralization may a greater
</p>
<p>security of life and property be reached.
</p>
<p>The average citizen has no confidence in the police, no matter how much
</p>
<p>it may be praised by newspapers of the moral worth of the Evening Tele-
</p>
<p>gram. Some tenements from the basement to top floors, of sections of Xew
</p>
<p>York City, have been burglarized by day and night, and only a very few
</p>
<p>robberies have been reported to the police, for the reason that it was of no
</p>
<p>avail to appeal to the protectors of property unless you caught the thief,
</p>
<p>or have the means to engage private detectives.
</p>
<p>And these secret societies are the arbiters of justice. Said Justice
</p>
<p>Gaynor of Brooklyn before the People's Forum in New Rochelle :

<p>Who has the right to say that the people of New York may not peacably
</p>
<p>assemble for discussion? That right is guaranteed under the Constitution.
</p>
<p>Some years ago I saw a big Socialist gathering under a red flag in a public
</p>
<p>park in Edinburgh, with not a policeman in sight. Were such a gathering
</p>
<p>attempted in Central Park the assemblers would have their heads knocked
</p>
<p>off by the police in less than half an hour.
</p>
<p>What an uproar would result if the police were to enter without warrant
</p>
<p>the home of some Supreme Court justice in Manhattan and search out his
</p>
<p>closet skeletons and his household goods! But last night the police invaded
</p>
<p>in that unlawful manner the house of ten poor persons in the oity, and the
</p>
<p>outrage has attracted no attention.
</p>
<p>I warn you, all of you, that if you allow the humblest citizen's con-
</p>
<p>stitutional rights to be invaded in this way, the time may come, wnll come,
</p>
<p>sooner or later, when your otcn home rights loill be invaded in like manner.
</p>
<p>But the noblest struggle in which man may engage is the fight for
</p>
<p>freedom, for truth, the liberation of the intellect from prejudice, fear and
</p>
<p>superstition; for the mother of toleration, of peace and general veil-being.
</p>
<p>Despotism reigns through fear, and the tyranny of the Church is at the
</p>
<p>beck and call of the oppressive factors in a community, and it is only natural
</p>
<p>that the police and the State's attorneys, in reciprocation of the aid ren-
</p>
<p>dered by Church authorities, bend their energies on persecuting free think-
</p>
<p>ing men instead of looking after the criminals, in the lowest and highest
</p>
<p>strata of society, who rob the purse of the poor and the treasures of the

</p>
<p>SOCIALISM AND LAW.
</p>
<p>So long as there are no better arguments presented for the inter-
</p>
<p>ference by Church and State with the work of liberals and radicals
</p>
<p>than the vague statements that their teachings are breeding crime against
</p>
<p>society, the restrictions on their utterances, the persecution of their agitators,
</p>
<p>is nothing but an admission of the weakness of the position of Church
</p>
<p>and State. The agitation of both, attended often with great brutality,
</p>
<p>in slandering their adversaries and bodily harming them, Ls an admission
</p>
<p>of the weak ground whereon their doctrines are built. The powers that be
</p>
<p>have always called the brutal forces of suppression and mob rule to their
</p>
<p>assistance, when they feared that their initjuitous systems were cninib-
</p>
<p>llng to pieces. The cry of enemies of society have been raised by Nero
</p>
<p>and Torquemada, against the Christians in Rome, against the Hugenots,
</p>
<p>the Chartists. They have been fed to wild beasts, burnt at the stake. And
</p>
<p>the Auto-da-f may live in the memory of many a zealous clergyman whose
</p>
<p>heart longs for a strenuous attack on all independent thinkers.
</p>
<p>This is an easy way of getting rid of one's adversaries. But it smacks
</p>
<p>so much of the despotism of former ages that we are no longer deceived
</p>
<p>by that cry of enemies of society. In our days this cry has been raised
</p>
<p>particularly against the Anarchist, and, in a lesser degree, against the
</p>
<p>Socialist.
</p>
<p>Socialism expresses a general tendency to institute organizations of
</p>
<p>society constructed on a co-operative basis to take the place of our present
</p>
<p>organizations of a competitive system. The Fabians, the Single Taxers,
</p>
<p>the Anarchists, the Social Democrats, the Christian Socalists, are all striving

</p>
<p>toward the goal of fraternity, a social equality.
</p>
<p>Owing to the numerical strength of the Social Democrats and th
</p>
<p>scope of their political activities, the public is more familiar with their
</p>
<p>branch of Socialism and commonly apply to them the general term. Socialists.
</p>
<p>Quoting from their platform adopted in New York, July 9, 1896, we fail
</p>
<p>to find anything criminal in their intentions :
</p>
<p>The United States to obtain possession of the mines, rail-
</p>
<p>roads, canals, telegraphs, telephones, and all other means of pvblic trans-
</p>
<p>portation and communication, the employees to operate the same cO'
</p>
<p>operatively under control of the Federal Government, and to elect thei^
</p>
<p>oicn superior officers, but no employee shall be discharged for political
</p>
<p>reasons.
</p>
<p>The municipalities to obtain possession of the local railroads, ferries.
</p>
<p>tcaterworks, gasworks, electric plants, and all industries requiring municipal
</p>
<p>franchises J the employees to operate the same co-operatively under control
</p>
<p>of the municipal administration, and to elect their officers; hut no em-
</p>
<p>ployee shall he discharged for political reasons.
</p>
<p>It is argued that the control exercised by the federal and municipal admin-
</p>
<p>istrations favors a paternalism injurious to the individual development. But
</p>
<p>the paternalism of social democracy, to the masses, is a benevolent despotism,
</p>
<p>at its worst, if compared to that of industrial feudalism at its best. A so-
</p>
<p>cial democratic State or commonwealth would provide work, shelter, and edu-
</p>
<p>cation, while a progressed industrial feudalism would reduce the competing
</p>
<p>workmen to the physical and intellectual state of the coolie. If the social
</p>
<p>democratic organization may be compared to a workshop, the capitalist
</p>
<p>system builds a prison. In the first one is supplied with work and kept
</p>
<p>under a rigid supervision to effect the regulation of production and distribu-
</p>
<p>tion for the ostensible benefit of all concerned ; in the latter the workmen
</p>
<p>are arrayed against one another with a view to procuring the greatest pos-
</p>
<p>sible profit and comfort for a few owners and their satellites, are held in
</p>
<p>subjection by an armed constabulary, and, by an ever increasing difficulty
</p>
<p>to obtain redress in the courts of justice, are unable to express their griev-
</p>
<p>ances. Mr. Hillquit, a lawyer and social democrat, at the protest-meeting
</p>
<p>at Grand Central Palace, following the brutal attack by the police on March
</p>
<p>28, inst., asserted that the Socialists strictly abide by the laws of the land,
</p>
<p>and would not entertain an undertaking in defiance of law. If this be true,
</p>
<p>then the propaganda by the press and the authorities, municipal and fed-
</p>
<p>eral, against their agitation may spring from the fear that the Socialists
</p>
<p>through their participation in politics might snatch from the claws of plu-
</p>
<p>tocracy those multitudes whose indolence and patience foster the ideal cap-
</p>
<p>italistic Feudalism.
</p>
<p>But, if this be the case, then obedience to law is not recognized a vir-
</p>
<p>tue by the authorities. It is merely a pretense. For if obedience to law
</p>
<p>were a virtue, the poor worker would be a respected citizen, above all; the
</p>
<p>Socialists were held up as the ideals of mankind ; whereas, the saloonkeeper,
</p>
<p>with a side entrance open on Sunday, the policeman with a club at a
</p>
<p>peaceful meeting, St. Anthony poking his nose into other people's affairs,
</p>
<p>the postmaster abrogating the rights of free press, the legis-

</p>
<p>lators working in the sweat of the lobby, the bankers withholding
</p>
<p>an accumulated cash until granted ten per cent., in short, all non-productive
</p>
<p>elements in society with an income based on privileges made laws for un-
</p>
<p>lawful professions would be criminals and treated as such.
</p>
<p>But the respect for these laws is gradually disappearing. This truth
</p>
<p>we may learn even from the press that is mostly interested in the preserva-
</p>
<p>tion of the legal oracle. In an editorial on the injustice of the treatment
</p>
<p>of the poor in our courts, the writer has this to say :
</p>
<p>"We ask these people to have respect for laAv. How CAN they have
</p>
<p>respect for the kind of law that locks up the innocent because he is poor
</p>
<p>and simply as a matter of convenience, and sets the criminal free because
</p>
<p>some other criminal oft high in polities is willing to go on his bond?"
</p>
<p> Evening Journal. April 15.
</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the average man does not care to pain-
</p>
<p>fully obey the laws but to successfully evade the laws. No ordinary man
</p>
<p>knows the laws of his country. Neither do the courts interpret the laws in
</p>
<p>the same way. Law is forever a matter of dispute between lawyers, and a
</p>
<p>source of revenue for professional twisters of legal opinions. To a majority
</p>
<p>of the people a great many laws seem unjust in that they discriminate
</p>
<p>against the personal liberty of those whose views on moral or religious or
</p>
<p>economic questions differ from the point taken by the framers of legislation,
</p>
<p>whose range of knowledge of men and things is usually very small. The
</p>
<p>conviction that many laws are the product of cowardice and hysteria fills
</p>
<p>others with a contempt for them. The knowledge that many legal attain-
</p>
<p>ments swell the stocks of the few and empty the pockets of the dependent
</p>
<p>people fortifies a determined conscience to defend at least in its own acts
</p>
<p>the promise of the Constitution to procure general welfare.
</p>
<p>If all the laws were enforced, business soon would come to a standstill ;
</p>
<p>for many laws are made only as a source of revenue for ofiices created. If
</p>
<p>all regulations were obeyed, the brains of the people soon would stop work-
</p>
<p>ing. If they were not obeyed, yet were made to be followed, the greatest
</p>
<p>part of the population should be under lock and chain. If all incorporated
</p>
<p>associations had honest detectives to watch over the people and were to
</p>
<p>call on the police and district-attorney to assist them in raiding, and arrest-
</p>
<p>ing, there soon would rise a conflagration consuming the feuds between the
</p>
<p>ministers, lawyers, boards of health, of fire, of medical as.sociations, etc.,
</p>
<p>etc., and out of the ashes would emerge strife among the remnants of law-
</p>
<p>fearing citizens, and from warring upon supposed crime they would turn
</p>
<p>to warring upon themselves; so much would they be in each other's way.
</p>
<p>But they would find out that law is a maze, the entanglement of which is
</p>
<p>enough to confuse any mind, sane or insane.
</p>
<p>Laws, to a great extent, are made contrary to the natural and healthy
</p>
<p>inclinations of man. Law, then, is an artifice, foreign to the structure of
</p>
<p>natural organization ; it is a crown of thorns pressed on the head of the
</p>
<p>vital interests of humanity.

<p>Brooklyn, May 14, 1908.
</p>
<p>Is obedience to law a virtue? Or is it rather a crime in view of the
</p>
<p>evil resulting therefrom, both in stifling man's active participation in the
</p>
<p>well-being of his community and in sustaining wrongs committed by those
</p>
<p>in authority?
</p>
<p>Of all laws that are least regarded and most to be desired in a com-
</p>
<p>munity built on wage-earning are those securing the life and possessions of
</p>
<p>the working classes. The increase in murder, theft, burglary is felt in their
</p>
<p>quarters far more than elsewhere; accidents in the workshops are killing
</p>
<p>and maiming them. The police and judiciary, with very few exceptions, are
</p>
<p>unwilling or unable to cope with the situation. The manufacturers hold
</p>
<p>the lives of their prey too cheap and care not for their safety in the shops
</p>
<p>and at the machines. And when the Socialists pointing out these cruelties
</p>
<p>in modern industry, are urging the working people to join their ranks, in
</p>
<p>order to work the industries cooperatively under the control of a benevolent
</p>
<p>administration, is it to be wondered at that they meet with a hearty response
</p>
<p>from the tortured masses?
</p>
<p>CRIME AND THE ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Every conceivable crime has been ascribed to the Anarchists, but not one
</p>
<p>has been fastened upon Anarchism. President Roosevelt exclaimed that
</p>
<p>every question of the day paled in significance as compared to that of
</p>
<p>Anarchism. Is it so? Or is the utterance of the Chief Magistrate to be
</p>
<p>understood in the light of development toward centralization of power
</p>
<p>and limitation of freedom?
</p>
<p>The Anarchist is the logical enemy of centralization, he is the natural
</p>
<p>foe of ruling by force. He hopes for a society in which a sublime feeling
</p>
<p>of fraternity will pervade a self-reliant people as an incentive to work in
</p>
<p>mutual aid; history and natural history sustain him in his philosophy. Men
</p>
<p>and associations will combine for mutual aid and cooperative work ; they
</p>
<p>will not be under the control of an administration with ruling powers ; for
</p>
<p>power over a fellow-man breeds brutality and is apt to give birth to tyran-
</p>
<p>nical institutions. Men of an association will learn to adjust things them-
</p>
<p>selves, they will enter treaties, as it were, with other associations for the
</p>
<p>exchange of goods or material. Those who desire to live under communism,
</p>
<p>might form leagues of that nature ; those who reject communism, might
</p>
<p>work out their own salvation. But there shall be no forcible interference with
</p>
<p>the economical, moral, or political life of any man ; there should be no estab-
</p>
<p>lishment of a legislature, an army, or other institution threatening the lib-
</p>
<p>erty of the people. In the emergency of a dispute arising between individuals
</p>
<p>or associations those concerned shall directly, without the interference of
</p>
<p>outsiders, arrive to a settlement of their differences.
</p>
<p>Education and environment, the Anarchist claims, shape the nature of
</p>
<p>a people. Liberty makes man generous. And if conditions can be created,
</p>
<p>that make man reliant on the resources of his intellect and sympathy, so-
</p>
<p>ciety will not be found lacking in trust and assistance.
</p>
<p>Prince Kropotkin, writing on Anarchist Morality, says : The dis-
</p>
<p>tinction . . . between egoism and altruism is ahsurd in our eyes. That
</p>
<p>is why toe have said nothing of the compromise that man, if we are to believe
</p>
<p>the utilitariuns, is always making between his egoistic and altruistic senti-
</p>
<p>ments. Such compromise can have no existence for the man who knows his

<p>own mind. What really takes place in the present condition of life, if we
</p>
<p>teek to live in conformity with our principles of equality, is that at every
</p>
<p>step we feel them outraged. (Chapter X). Reviewing his argumentation,
</p>
<p>he concludes in the same chapter : We have seen the kind of morality which
</p>
<p>is even now shaping itself in the ideas of the masses and of the thinkers.
</p>
<p>This morality will issue no commands. It will refuse once and for all to
</p>
<p>model individuals according to an abstract idea, as it will refuse to mutilate
</p>
<p>them by religion, law, or government. It will leave to the individual man full
</p>
<p>and perfect liberty. It toill be but a simple record of facts, a science. And
</p>
<p>this science will say to man: ^'If you are not conscious of strength within
</p>
<p>you, if your energies are only just sufficient to maintain a colorless, monot-
</p>
<p>onous life, without strong impressions, without deep joys, but also without
</p>
<p>deep sorrows, keep to the simple principles of a just equality. In relation to
</p>
<p>equality j/ow usiU find probably the maximum of happiness possible to your
</p>
<p>feeble energies.
</p>
<p>But if you feel within you the strength of youth, if you xcish to live,
</p>
<p>if you icish to enjoy a perfect, full and overfloxcing life  that m, know the
</p>
<p>highest pleasures which a living being can enjoy  be strong, be great, be
</p>
<p>vigorous in all of you.
</p>
<p>Sow life around you. Take heed that if you deceive, lie. intrigue, cheat,
</p>
<p>you thereby demean yourself, confess your own weakness beforehand, play
</p>
<p>the part of the slave of the harem, who feels himself the inferior of the
</p>
<p>masters.
</p>
<p>Are such utterances not worthy of emulation? Are these appeals to
</p>
<p>everything that is noble in us, made by a recognized leader of communist-
</p>
<p>anarchist thought, criminal, as our Chief-Magistrate would make us believe?
</p>
<p>Outrages recently committed in the United States have been ascribed,
</p>
<p>directly and indirectly, to Anarchists. But upon investigation it was shown
</p>
<p>that in the case of two western occurrences neither of the accused was an
</p>
<p>anarchist or had been moved to his acts by the perusal of anarchistic liter-
</p>
<p>ature. And the connection of the New York anarchist with the bomb-
</p>
<p>throwing on Union Square is of a very flimsy nature and open to well-
</p>
<p>founded suspicion. But if we turn to Spain, the historical battlefield of the
</p>
<p>Anarchists, we find that bomb-throwing and the like outrages have been the
</p>
<p>work of the secret jwlice. The Black Hand (Manu ncra) for a long time
</p>
<p>filled Spain with terror, the Anarchists withal being taken for the perpe-
</p>
<p>trators of those heinous crimes until at last it came to light that no such
</p>
<p>society had existed, that the secret iwlice had invented this devilish chimera
</p>
<p>in order to drive the people to fury against the Anarchists, the supiwsed
</p>
<p>actors in this drama. And recently, about a month ago, another crime of the
</p>
<p>secret police was unearthed there ; an agent of the police having joined the
</p>
<p>ranks of some Anarchists in order to provoke them to untoward acts, upon
</p>
<p>failing to accomplish his ends, manufactured and exploded bombs in vari-
</p>
<p>ous sections of the land, thus uncovering "contemplated assassinations and
</p>
<p>assaults" and making a profitable income thereby. * Such occurrences are
</p>
<p>of so frequent a nature that it has become proverbial to look at the bomb-
</p>
<p>thrower as an agent of the police The late Governor Altgeld exonerated
</p>
<p>in a lengthy brief the Anarchists hanged in Chicago from a connection with

<p>the bomb-throwing on the hay market, 1887. Czolgocz's deed belongs in a
</p>
<p>class for itself. Whether he was an Anarchist or not is an open question.
</p>
<p>Anarchist or no, he was moved by the same kind of patriotism that directed
</p>
<p>the hands of Brutus or Booth. A vital and sudden change in national and
</p>
<p>imperialist policies was apt to react on men with firm convictions and
</p>
<p>strong passions in a compulsory manner. Brutus and Booth thought
</p>
<p>the interests of their countries outraged, and employed forcible means in an
</p>
<p>endeavor to awaken the public conscience. The act of Czolgocz may be,
</p>
<p>with equal justice, explained in like manner.
</p>
<p>But granted that the Anarchists did engage in violent propaganda as a
</p>
<p>means of calling the attention of the world to inhuman conditions, the
</p>
<p>amelioration of which is comparatively easy of accomplishment, but opposed
</p>
<p>to by those who profit by them. The responsibility for such acts rests
</p>
<p>with a society that does not permit the free development of ideas and ob-
</p>
<p>Trial in Barcelona of one Rull whom the Governor of Barcelona admitted as hav-
</p>
<p>ing been in his emplo]r.
</p>
<p>structs the open passage of a social movement. If you desire violence, re-
</p>
<p>strict freedom. If you have freedom, i)eace is at hand.
</p>
<p>Society, in permitting a government to regulate the relations of its
</p>
<p>citizens and the general welfare of all classes in a community, charges there-
</p>
<p>by the government with the duty to care for those under its protection. If
</p>
<p>the government fails in its task, society ought to replace it with another gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, provided it is not to get along without one. If society fails in this,
</p>
<p>individuals must remind it that in taking from men the rights to govern
</p>
<p>themselves and laying their welfare in the hands of a criminal government,
</p>
<p>society has played the role of a traitor on the individual, that from the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment being a lessee has risen a government with a slave-driver's whip in
</p>
<p>hand, who usurps the ownership of men and the settlement of affairs.
</p>
<p>But above all, this government has no right to decry violent actions
</p>
<p>since it rose to power and holds its prestige through violence. A teacher
</p>
<p>ridicules himself by upbraiding his scholars for brutalities they have learned
</p>
<p>from the master. President Roosevelt, to argue for a greater navy, insists
</p>
<p>that the pride of a nation and the honor of etc., etc., relies on the backing of
</p>
<p>might. Very well, then, this may be also the view of the Anarchist who has
</p>
<p>no other way of settling the dispute between himself and the State. Why,
</p>
<p>then, hiss the propagandist, if he be an Anarchist, and cheer the agitator,
</p>
<p>if he chances to be a republican, since both arrive in their philosophy of
</p>
<p>might and right at the same conclusion? If a difference of a degree of merit
</p>
<p>there be, that weighs heavier to the credit of the Anarchist. For while he is
</p>
<p>moved to his acts by the desire to free the people from burdens of taxation
</p>
<p>and exploitation, the jwlitician is using all means in his power to increase
</p>
<p>the public expenditures and to impose new rules ; while the first offers
</p>
<p>his own earnings and life on the altar of an ideal, the latter disposes of
</p>
<p>the earnings and lives of others for the sake of power.
</p>
<p>John Most, supposedly an avowed advocate of violence as a means
</p>
<p>for propaganda, defines in unmistakable terms the harm done to the cause of
</p>
<p>Anarchism by acts of violence undertaken without the object of liberation in
</p>
<p>view and without any tangible chances of success for the liberation of so-
</p>
<p>ciety from any of its forms of tyranny.* Yet anarchism and crime are
</p>
<p>constantly mentioned in one breath, as though anarchism meant crime and
</p>
<p>crime anarchism ; in spite of the fact that crime is growing more rampant

<p>as the power of the district-attorney and police commissioner are increasing
</p>
<p>in dimensions. A wave of unpunished crime always follows a refusal to
</p>
<p>grant them more money and men, and precedes each request for them.
</p>
<p>In fact, the only people that need to be in fear of the police and the district-
</p>
<p>attorney's ofiice are those aware of the injustices wrought and arrayed against
</p>
<p>them, and those who are in the employ of the wealthy. The lowest strata
</p>
<p>of society, the criminal rich and the professional thieves need not fear them ;
</p>
<p>the first because the respect for the rich must be maintained the same as
</p>
<p>that for the decisions of the courts  at all hazards, to prevent the down-
</p>
<p>fall of the iniquitous system;** the second, because of their show of deter-
</p>
<p>* Attentats- Reflexionen. Freiheit. August 28, 1892.
</p>
<p>**Governor Johnson, whose nomination for the Presidency is being urged by such
</p>
<p>influences as the World, is reported as saying that the decisions of the courts must be
</p>
<p>respected, even if unjust. An ideal President! Could there be a greater encourage-
</p>
<p>ment to unjust decisions than such utterances?
</p>
<p>mination, they must be left to wnr on llieir unfortunate fellow-men rather
</p>
<p>than be given n chance to openly attack the phitocrncy.
</p>
<p>But are we because of the conne<-tion of a man with a class, a move-
</p>
<p>ment, a church, to accuse them of crime committed by one of their members?
</p>
<p>Are we to call the police an association of burglars because members of the
</p>
<p>force have been found guilty of aiding and abetting in burglary? Are we
</p>
<p>to call the Roman Catholics murderers because in the month of April two
</p>
<p>most dastardly murdersf by Roman Catholic priests in Italy have come to
</p>
<p>light?
</p>
<p>Confusion reigns supreme, llie attack on Anarchism is really an at-
</p>
<p>tack on thought, an attack on self-reliance. The minds of the people are
</p>
<p>being confused, and once thoir apathy pcrmit.s the gagging of a class
</p>
<p>against which they have been prejudiced, the conspiracy against their free
</p>
<p>expressions of disapproval of usurpations of power will soon unmask its face.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile government is linked with ignorance as freedom with knowl-
</p>
<p>edge. Its despotism can be likened to the doings of a rageful woman who
</p>
<p>is whipping her child on the street and under the gaze of a generally in-
</p>
<p>different populace. She throws her offspring on the back, slaps it in the
</p>
<p>face, kicks it in the belly, and, in fear lest someone might be aroused to
</p>
<p>take the child from her fury, drags it into a dark hallway wiiere she may
</p>
<p>do things nobody can witness. And this is called justice, and justice is called
</p>
<p>charit-able, and charity is suppo.sed to be an attribute to civilization, and
</p>
<p>civilization means the height of culture, and culture the possession of
</p>
<p>knowledge, the development of man's faculties, the subserviency of natural
</p>
<p>forces to the welfare of humanity, and . . . But let it be enough. Justice
</p>
<p>is nothing of that sort. She is a rageful woman, deaf to the heartaches of
</p>
<p>the weak, blind to the wounds of the sick. She knows no charity, and the
</p>
<p>civilization she adores is that of the raiment; culture to her is wealth, and
</p>
<p>the welfare of humanity is meted out by her according to the price paid in
</p>
<p>money. Tliis justice is the justice of government. Rut, in spite of Roose-
</p>
<p>velt, man was before government, and, in spite of government, man will
</p>
<p>survive its justice.
</p>
<p>AWAKE !

<p>in crimes against the poor and the middle class by gangs of professionals,
</p>
<p>and by the lords of exploitation ; the growth of the wealth and influence
</p>
<p>of the Churches ; the dissemination of prejudice, are one lon^ chain
</p>
<p>wherewith the enslavement of the masses is to be performed.
</p>
<p>The more the masses will look up to "Washington for amelioration of
</p>
<p>their conditions, the stronger will the institution of centralized power
</p>
<p>become. In view of the historical fact that the grossest injustice assumed
</p>
<p>the noblest insignia to cover the dark thoughts in its breast, it is rational
</p>
<p>that the suppression of liberties be covered with bighsounding phrases.

</p>
<p>It is already a popular belief that oflRce carries graft and graft office,
</p>
<p>and it is high time that the people realize the deception practiced on them.
</p>
<p>Instead of applying for assistance against their various oppressors to the
</p>
<p>authorities in whom they have no faith, the workmen must needs co-operate
</p>
<p>to help themselves. And since the vote is an avenue to deception and
</p>
<p>oppression, the workmen should keep away from the voting booths.
</p>
<p>Citizenship has been made dependable on the value of the pocketbook
</p>
<p>and a man's political convictions. Citizenship has been thus made depend-
</p>
<p>able on stealth and lie. Its worth has been lowered. A prize has been set
</p>
<p>on cowardice, for he who shall lie may become a citizen. It is far nobler
</p>
<p>to do the duties of an honorable man than share in the privileges of a caste.
</p>
<p>All energies and possessions in money and labor should be spent on
</p>
<p>erecting homes of the various crafts, however small in the beginning, with
</p>
<p>the view of closer association and direct benefit. Groups should combine
</p>
<p>for co-operative work with a view to the beginning of communistic
</p>
<p>production and enjoyment of the fruit of their labor. If all money thrown
</p>
<p>away by workmen for political action, for salaries of leaders, for rent, for
</p>
<p>the profits of middle-men, for bureaus, etc., were to be used for the economic
</p>
<p>emancipation of labor, however small and hard the start may be, the work-
</p>
<p>man soon would outgrow all hardships of non-employment, and at last, never
</p>
<p>resting in his agitation for self-reliance of the class and the mutual in-
</p>
<p>terest of the worker, would own to what he is justly entitled.
</p>
<p>All hope for clean politics is vain. The essence of all institutions is
</p>
<p>fed by a system of espionage. If you bear no witness against your fellow
</p>
<p>man, if you do not spy on his acts and intentions, if you do not watch hi^^
</p>
<p>movements in trade and business, the courts and competition are at a stand-
</p>
<p>still. But while this system of espionage is a necessary implement to hold
</p>
<p>the modern state together, it is corrupting the faculties of man, blotting his
</p>
<p>soul with shame, killing his love for the fellow man. And thus brought up
</p>
<p>from childhood and contending with such evils during all his life, man
</p>
<p>becomes unconsciously hardened against the noblest sentiments of humanity,
</p>
<p>and accessible to all influences of corruption. The system of espionage
</p>
<p>thus breeds corruption.

<p>the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, in
</p>
<p>sketching the character of President Roosevelt, has this truth in mind when
</p>
<p>he says in Our Dumb Animals :
</p>
<p>If, in his boyhood. President Roosevelt had been humanely educated in
</p>
<p>a hand of mercy, probably he would have written very differently about the
</p>
<p>starving cattle on Western ranches, and the shooting of animals simply
</p>
<p>for the fun of wounding and killing them. He would not be so anxious
</p>
<p>to put rifles into the hands of American school boys that they might be
</p>
<p>better prepared to shoot human beings, and he icould not be engaged in
</p>
<p>his present controversy with Rev. William J. Long, whose charming stories
</p>
<p>of animal life are giving pleasure to thousands of readers.
</p>
<p>We tried very hard to prevent Mr. Roosevelt being Assistant Secretary
</p>
<p>of the Navy because  as we wrote Gov. Long  we felt sure if he received
</p>
<p>that appointment, we should get into war with something about something.

<p>We failed and the Cuban and Philippine wars have coat thousands of Uvea,
</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of dollars, an enormous increase in our pension list,
</p>
<p>and the end is not yet.
</p>
<p>We cannot help thinking of the President as a powder mill, liable at
</p>
<p>any time to explode and do vast damage, and we most earnestly wish  at
</p>
<p>we suggested some months ago  that he might have in his Cabinet as "Sec-
</p>
<p>retary of Peace" some strong man to "whose wise counsels he would respect-
</p>
<p>fully listen," so that he may studiously avoid everything which would plunge
</p>
<p>nation into another war.
</p>
<p>Roosevelt icent afield armed to the teeth with a repeating
</p>
<p>rifle, etc. His books are steeped in the blood of wanton slaughter, and he
</p>
<p>revels in the telling of the wounding of beasts, the kilUng of fawns and
</p>
<p>mother animals, and of the disregard of the umcritten laws of camp life
</p>
<p>in shooting camp confines.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Let us not be deceived as to the real meaning of these hard times and
</p>
<p>the succession of rpstrictions on liberty. It behooves us, above all, to raise
</p>
<p>our voice in mighty denunciation of the attacks on our own rights as men
</p>
<p>and women of an enlightened age. Our voice will be heard when it shall
</p>
<p>not be dumped into ballot boxes but cried out in the open to carry it to the
</p>
<p>ears of our oppressors. They look with silent contempt or pleasure at the
</p>
<p>ballot-box, but they will tremble when our voices are heard :
</p>
<p>Repeal your despotic measures ; hearken to the pangs of hunger !
</p>
<p>Let us open our eyes to the misery of the subjected colonies. Let us
</p>
<p>recognize the injustice they suffer from our hands, let us rectify the promises
</p>
<p>we have broken, let us investigate how much the enslavement of these
</p>
<p>foreign peoples has had to do with the enslavement of ourselves, how much
</p>
<p>to the exploitation in the colonies are due the hardships at home.
</p>
<p>And ere we strive toward the realization of a reconstruction of society,
</p>
<p>let us not forget that we must strive toward breaking the chains that try to
</p>
<p>fasten on our intellect. Only then is the human mind creative of greatness,
</p>
<p>both, in pleasure and worry. The intellect in pleasure is like the day on
</p>
<p>which a clear sky shines; the fogs of prejudice and superstition and fear
</p>
<p>have receded. And the intellect of a free mind in worry is like a stormy
