<p>THE GREAT CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jay's Address.
</p>
<p>My Fellow- Countrymen : 
</p>
<p>We have assembled to celebrate the eighty-sixth birth-
</p>
<p>day of American independence, and we come together under
</p>
<p>circumstances that seem to make us contemporaries and co-actors
</p>
<p>as it were, with our fathers of the revolution. The crisis which
</p>
<p>they met, ard which their heroism decided after a seven years'
</p>
<p>war with Great Britain, again meets us face to face. The early
</p>
<p>scenes of their struggle for constitutional liberty, have found
</p>
<p>in our recent experience an historic parallel of even chronologi-
</p>
<p>cal exactness.
</p>
<p>The blood of Massachussetts, shed at Lexington on the 19th
</p>
<p>of April 1775, was not shed more gloriously than that of the sons
</p>
<p>of the same old commonwealth, who, marching by our national
</p>
<p>highway, to the defence of our common capital, were slain at
</p>
<p>Baltimore on the 19th of April, 1861.
</p>
<p>The midnight ride of Paul Revere, famed in history and song,
</p>
<p>rousing the sleepers as he passed to hasten to defend their coun-
</p>
<p>try, created no deeper emotion among the colonists of that day,
</p>
<p>than did our electric wires flashing far and wide the news of
</p>
<p>the assault on Sumpter and the massacre at Baltimore, and thrill-
</p>
<p>ing with a simultaneous burst of sympathy the loyal heart of
</p>
<p>the American people.
</p>
<p>On the 4th of July 1776, the congress that met in the state
</p>
<p>house at Philadelphia approved the solemn instrument that de-
</p>
<p>clared the independenceof the American colonies, and announced
</p>
<p>to the world the birth of a nation. Eighty-five years have rolled

</p>
<p>by : the actors in that eventful scene have long since gone to
</p>
<p>their graves : their names belong to history : their sons have
</p>
<p>grown to manhood and age and have followed them to the nnseen
</p>
<p>world : and we of the third and fourth generation occnpy the
</p>
<p>stage they trod, and represent the nationality which then was
</p>
<p>born. Eighty-five years of almost uninterrupted prosperity and
</p>
<p>unexampled growth ! eighty-five years of culture and experience
</p>
<p>in a century of progress such as the world has never seen before 1
</p>
<p>eighty-five years of thoughtful reflection on the character of the
</p>
<p>men who laid the foundation of our national glory and of the
</p>
<p>broad principles of right on which they based the edifice oi Ameri-
</p>
<p>can freedom I
</p>
<p>Those years have passed ; their results are written on the map
</p>
<p>of America, on the page of history, and to-day, the itli of July
</p>
<p>1861, the American congress convenes again at the call of the
</p>
<p>president at the capital bearing the name of .Washington, to
</p>
<p>meet the question, whether the republic is to be maintained in
</p>
<p>its integrity wiih the constitution proclaimed by Washington
</p>
<p>based on the will of the majority, or whether it is to be sundered
</p>
<p>and shattered by a defeated faction that sets at defiance the will
</p>
<p>of the people and would trample tiio constitution in the dust.
</p>
<p>If ever the spirits of the departed are permitted to revisit the
</p>
<p>scenes they loved, and hover like angels around the steps of their
</p>
<p>successors, wo may suppose that Hancock, and the Adamses,
</p>
<p>Sherman and Wolcott, Carroll and Livingston, Jefferson and
</p>
<p>Franklin, Robert and Lewis Morris, Wilson and Rush, and all
</p>
<p>their noble compeers, look down from heaven in this hour upon
</p>
<p>the Congress at Washington ; and God grant that the sturdy
</p>
<p>spirit which inspired the first Congress may equally inspire the
</p>
<p>last I
</p>
<p>" Whatever may be our fate," said John Adams, with prophetic
</p>
<p>vision, after the adoption of the declaration,  " be assured that
</p>
<p>this declaration will stand. It may cost treasure and it may cost
</p>
<p>blood, but it will richly compensate for both. Through the thick
</p>
<p>gloom of the present I see the brightness of the future as the
</p>
<p>sun in heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day.

</p>
<p>When we are in our graves our children will honour it. They will
</p>
<p>celebrate it with thanksgiving, with festivities, Avith bon-fires,
</p>
<p>with illuminations. On its annual return they will shed tears, not
</p>
<p>of subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, butoi ex-
</p>
<p>ultation, of gratitude and of joy. Sir, before God, I believe the
</p>
<p>hour is come : all that I have, all that I am, all that I hope for in
</p>
<p>this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it, and I leave off as
</p>
<p>I began, that live or die, sink or swim, survive or perish, I am for
</p>
<p>the declaration. It is my living sentiment, and by the blessing
</p>
<p>of God it shall be my dying sentiment,  Independence now, and
</p>
<p>independence forever !"
</p>
<p>The integrity and independence of our country are again in
</p>
<p>peril, and to-day the issue is with us. We come together now,
</p>
<p>not as in past years, to rejoice over a national domain bound-
</p>
<p>less in extent, peopled by countrymen differing, it may be, in
</p>
<p>their views and institutions, but united in loyalty and affection,
</p>
<p>at peace in their own borders, and with the great arm of the
</p>
<p>union protecting its citizens alike on sea or land, at home or in
</p>
<p>foreign climes. But we meet in sadness to overlook a divided
</p>
<p>Dation, and to listen to tne tramp of martial forces larger than
</p>
<p>ever before trod the soil of America : the one army bearing
</p>
<p>proudly aloft the stars and stripes, and keeping step to the music
</p>
<p>of the union \ the other grasping the banner of rebellion and
</p>
<p>the black flag of piracy, proclaiming death to the constitution and
</p>
<p>the union, and rum to the commerce of the republic.
</p>
<p>Several states, about one-fourth of our whole number, profess
</p>
<p>to have resumed their sovereignty and seceded, as they term it,
</p>
<p>from the federal union : and certain persons professing to act in
</p>
<p>their name, have extemporized what they call the Southern Con-
</p>
<p>federacy, elected a president, Jefferson Davis, and a vice-presi-
</p>
<p>dent, Alexander H. Stephens, organized an army, issued letters
</p>
<p>of marq[ue, and declared war on the people and the government
</p>
<p>of the United States ; and they have publicly announced, through
</p>
<p>Walker, the secretary of Davis, their intention of speedily seiz-
</p>
<p>ing our capital at Washington, with its national archives and
</p>
<p>muniments of titles
</p>
<p>To meet the rebel force arrayed against the capital, president
</p>
<p>Lincoln has called upon the loyal states, and at the word, fresh

</p>
<p>from the plough, the loom and the workshop, fresh from col-
</p>
<p>lege seats and the professor's chair, from the bar, the pulpit,
</p>
<p>and the counting house, fresh from every department of Ameri-
</p>
<p>can industry, the army of the union is in the field, and the
</p>
<p>Avorld awaits the impending crisis. Europe looks on with un-
</p>
<p>disguised and wondering interest, and Avhile France and Ger-
</p>
<p>many seem instinctively to appreciate our situation, the British
</p>
<p>cabinet and the British press have straiigely blundered, and
</p>
<p>have muttered something we do not understand, about " rights
</p>
<p>of belligerents," " a wicked war," and the " bursting of the bub^
</p>
<p>ble of democrac}'."
</p>
<p>Such, in brief, is our position at home and abroad, and this day
</p>
<p>is destined to be memorable  perhaps as memorable in history
</p>
<p>as that which we have met to celebrate. The action of the con-
</p>
<p>gress now assembled will decide whether the national indepen-
</p>
<p>dence established against the united strength of the British
</p>
<p>empire in '76 is to fall ignominiously before the attacks of a
</p>
<p>rebel minority of our own countrymen in '61.
</p>
<p>It is to decide the question whether in the next century our
</p>
<p>descendants shall refer to the fourth of July as the forgotten
</p>
<p>birth-day of an extinct republic, or whether, when we shall sleep
</p>
<p>with our fathers and our children shall slumber by our side,
</p>
<p>their grandsons shall meet as we do this day to bless our memo-
</p>
<p>vies as we bless those of our revolutionary sires : to spread to
</p>
<p>the breeze from the Atlantic to the Pacific, on every hill side
</p>
<p>and in every valley, the flag of our union, the stars and stripes
</p>
<p>that we so proudly love, and join their voices in swelling the
</p>
<p>cry of Adams  "Independence now, and independence for-
</p>
<p>ever 1"
</p>
<p>While the great issue, the success or failure of the American
</p>
<p>experiment, the continuance of our union or its disintegration
</p>
<p>rests immediately with the president and with congress, it rests
</p>
<p>in an almost equal degree upon each one of us. The American
</p>
<p>people are at once citizens and sovereigns  the fountain and
</p>
<p>source of the supreme authority of the land, and to us the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, will our servants in congress naturally and properly look
</p>
<p>for guidance in this extremity. Already have you seen how
</p>
<p>fairly an honest executive represents the sentiments of the ma-

</p>
<p>jority of his countrymen, availing himself of their counsels, gath-
</p>
<p>ering strength from their energy and determination, and so di-
</p>
<p>recting the government that its action keeps time to the beat-
</p>
<p>ing of the national pulse. Already in response to the nation's
</p>
<p>call has the national government arisen in gigantic strength
</p>
<p>from the depths of imbecility to which it had fallen, to a posi-
</p>
<p>tion of grandeur, dignity and power, which has silenced the
</p>
<p>half uttered sarcasms of European declaimers about the inter-
</p>
<p>nal weakness ot popular institutions.
</p>
<p>Most of you  perhaps all of you  have made up your minds
</p>
<p>deliberately, intelligently and dispassionately in regard to your
</p>
<p>duty ; and it is a general and proper sentiment among us that
</p>
<p>this is a time for energetic action, not for discussion. But still
</p>
<p>as I am here, honoured by your appointment to say something-
</p>
<p>befitting the occasion, I think you will permit me, if indeed you
</p>
<p>do not regard it as my especial province, to speak frankly of our
</p>
<p>present duty ; to say something of the great theme which en-
</p>
<p>grosses the nation ; of which we think when we rise in the mor-
</p>
<p>ning and when we retire at night, as we go to our work and re-
</p>
<p>turn to our meals, when we open the morning paper for ne'^' .
</p>
<p>and close it for reflection, when we kneel at the family altar and
</p>
<p>by our own bed sides,-  the one great overwhelming subject,
</p>
<p>the issue of this rebellion, the destiny of our country.
</p>
<p>I can speak to you about it more familiarly, perhaps, than
</p>
<p>I should speak to strangers, for you are familiar with the whole
</p>
<p>matter, you know by heart the history of the revolutionary war
</p>
<p>in which the county of Westchester bore from the beginning
</p>
<p>so prominent a part, and from boyhood our thoughts and associa-
</p>
<p>tions have been intimately connected with the facts of our colo-
</p>
<p>nial dependence and the incidents that marked the struggle by
</p>
<p>which that dependence was at length terminated. Let me refer
</p>
<p>for an instant to some of the local memories which linger all
</p>
<p>around us. On the angle of Connecticut which juts into the
</p>
<p>State of New York, close by this town of Newcastle, stands
</p>
<p>the boundary rock, still bearing the initials " G. R.," brief me-
</p>
<p>mento of King George III., whose sovereignty over our fathers,
</p>
<p>loyal subjects though they were, and backed as was the crown
</p>
<p>by the armies of Great Britain, faded before the steadfastness

</p>
<p>of their resistance to unconstitutional usurpation.
</p>
<p>New York in '76 being selected by the British as the centrt.
</p>
<p>of their operations, commanding, as they did, the Hudson river,
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>and acting in connection with a force from Canada, their march
</p>
<p>into Westchester was designed to control the two principal
</p>
<p>routes to New England, by the way of Rye and Bedford, and so
</p>
<p>cut off the American army from its eastern supplies. Washing
</p>
<p>ton, penetrating their designs, skilfully conducted h-is forces
</p>
<p>northwardly from King's bridge, moving in a line parallel with
</p>
<p>the British, keeping a little in advance, facing them constantly
</p>
<p>Vv^th the Bronx in his front, the banks of the stream being for-
</p>
<p>tified in convenient places.
</p>
<p>I need not remind you of the battle of White Plains on the
</p>
<p>9^ih. October, 1776, where xVlexander Hamilton distinguished
</p>
<p>himself as a captain of artillery, nor of the heights of New-
</p>
<p>castle, to which Washington repaired after the battle. At Bed-
</p>
<p>ford, where we hold our farms under Indian titles bearing the
</p>
<p>mark of Katonah sagamore, that were confirmed by patent of
</p>
<p>Queen Anne, some houses were burned in '79 by lieut. colonel
</p>
<p>Tarlton, heading a detachment of the Queen's rangers, as related
</p>
<p>in his despatch to Sir Guy Carleton. At Poundridge and Hitch-
</p>
<p>ing's corner occurred bloody skirmishes. Then, there are near
</p>
<p>by us Mile-square, where the Americans kept a strong guard ;
</p>
<p>Pine's bridge, which served as tlie principal communication be-
</p>
<p>tween the hostile lines, and wliere Enoch Crosby, the West-
</p>
<p>chester spy  known to all readers of our great novelist as Har-
</p>
<p>vey Bicrh  commenced his career of secret service ; King's
</p>
<p>bridge, the barrier of the British lines on the Harlem river,
</p>
<p>commanded in New York by Lord Cathcart, where the cowboys
</p>
<p>made their rendezvous when they had plundered the surround-
</p>
<p>ing hills, and where a battle was fought between the Continen-
</p>
<p>tals and the Hessians. Indeed the whole of the " neutral
</p>
<p>ground," as pourtrayed by Fennimore Cooper, extending to the
</p>
<p>Croton, the banks of the Hudson, Northcastle and Salem, con-
</p>
<p>nected with the sad drama of Andre and the, till recently un-
</p>
<p>surpassed treason of Arnold, all abound with revolutionary inci-
</p>
<p>dents ; not forgetting Valentine's hill at Mile-square, where

</p>
<p>Washington was encamped in '76. Sir William Erskine in '78,
</p>
<p>and where in '82, as Mr. Bolton tells us. a grand foray was made
</p>
<p>with some 6,000 men by Sir Gny Carleton in person, attended
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>among other officers of note, by the young duke of Clarence,
</p>
<p>afterwards William the fourtli.
</p>
<p>Dwelling as you do amid scenes so suggestive, there should
</p>
<p>be no traitors in Westchester unless indeed, they are the des-
</p>
<p>cendants of the cow-boys and skinners, those pests of the Revo-
</p>
<p>lution, who were at once selfish, treacherous, cowardly, and cruel ;
</p>
<p>and if any traitors should again be found in our borders  ^men
</p>
<p>ready for their own selfish interests to betray either the nation-
</p>
<p>al principles, or the national integrity that our fathers bought
</p>
<p>for us at so great a price, do not forget to remin.d them that the
</p>
<p>" Cow-boy oak" yet stands near Yonkers, on which their traitor-
</p>
<p>ous ancestors were suspended with " a short shrift and a sure
</p>
<p>cord ;" and that equally patriotic oaks in every part of West-
</p>
<p>chester send forth their broad arms ready to perform for our
</p>
<p>country, should its safety at any time unhappily demand it, the
</p>
<p>same excellent service.
</p>
<p>You are familiar also with the history of our Constitution, and
</p>
<p>with those marked lines of distinction between the authority of
</p>
<p>the States and that of the Federal government, which to some
</p>
<p>of the statesmen and authors of England seem so difficult of com-
</p>
<p>prehension, and in regard to which, perhaps naturally enough,
</p>
<p>they occasionally fall into blunders, which unfortunately are not
</p>
<p>always as harmless as the droll liberties they are accustomed to
</p>
<p>take with our history, our geography, and our nomenclature.
</p>
<p>If ever the constitutional history of America shall receive in
</p>
<p>the education of English gentlemen a tithe of the attention be-
</p>
<p>stowed on the constitutions of Greece and Eome, or a share of
</p>
<p>that devoted to the fabulous heroes, the gods and goddesses of
</p>
<p>classic mythology, the British senate may occasionally find a
</p>
<p>famiharity with our institutions of no slight value, especially if it
</p>
<p>shall save them from rashly interrupting the cordial friendship
</p>
<p>of a kindred people.
</p>
<p>The universality of such knowledge here, makes us perhaps
</p>

<p>Franklin said during the last century, and the progress of edu-
</p>
<p>cation and improvements in our newspapers have made the re-
</p>
<p>mark more true of the present than of the past," we are more
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>thoroughly an enlightened people, with regard to our political
</p>
<p>interests than perhaps any other under heaven."
</p>
<p>You remember that in 1774 the members ot the first congress
</p>
<p>at Philadelphia, on behalf of the colonies which they represented,
</p>
<p>entered into certain articles of association " under the sacred
</p>
<p>ties of virtue, honour and love of country." That in 1778 the
</p>
<p>states united in a confederacy, or what they called " a firm league
</p>
<p>of friendship with each other," under the title of the United
</p>
<p>States, and that under this league made by the states, they con-
</p>
<p>tinued until 1789, when, " in order to form a more perfect union" 
</p>
<p>not the states, but  " We the people of the United States" or-
</p>
<p>dained and established the present federal constitution. You
</p>
<p>remember that from the date of the peace in '83, when we were
</p>
<p>a mere league of petty sovereignties, we sank rapidly, in the
</p>
<p>words of Mr. Motley, whose conclusive essay in the London
</p>
<p>Times has enlightened Europe, "into a condition of utter impo-
</p>
<p>tence, imbecility and anarchy," which continued until we were
</p>
<p>rescued from it by " The constitution of the United States,"
</p>
<p>which made us, in every sense, one nation  with one supreme
</p>
<p>government, although for convenience, we retained the plural
</p>
<p>title under which we had achieved our independence of " The
</p>
<p>United States."
</p>
<p>Any argument, therefore, addressed to you upon the constitu-
</p>
<p>tional right alleged by the rebels, of a state to secede from the
</p>
<p>union would be quite superfluous. Men have been allowed to
</p>
<p>talk of state sovereignty as it liked them, because ours is a free
</p>
<p>country and in ordinary times the utmost liberty of speech is
</p>
<p>permissible, but the doctrine has not even a respectable foothold.
</p>
<p>Washington, as if foreseeing the evil it has assisted to bring forth,
</p>
<p>denounced it as " that monster, state sovereignty." Webster and
</p>
<p>Jackson successively demolished it, and the argument now inso-
</p>
<p>lently advanced by leaders of the rebel states, that in seceding
</p>
<p>from the Union and seizing its property, they are only exercising
</p>
<p>their reserved rights under the Constitution, is one which to
</p>
<p>tation.

<p>every intelligent and loyal American carries with it its own refu-
</p>
<p>The man who attaches to it the Aveight of a feather, is either
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>singularly ignorant of American history, or liis reasoning powers
</p>
<p>are hopelessly perverted.
</p>
<p>The rebels, despite their pretended plea of constitutional right
</p>
<p>virtually admit its groundlessness, and fall back on the right o1
</p>
<p>revolution. That is a right which no American can deny, wher
</p>
<p>the causes of justification are sufficient. The simple cry of rebel
</p>
<p>and revolutionist has no terror for us who remember thai
</p>
<p>Washington and our ancestors occupied the position of both the
</p>
<p>one and the other.
</p>
<p>All then depends upon the reality and sufficiency of the as
</p>
<p>signed causes of this attempt at revolution. Are they such sa
</p>
<p>to justify the effort to break in pieces the American union? tc
</p>
<p>destroy this last experiment of popular government ?
</p>
<p>The arguments offered by the insurrectionists and their friends
</p>
<p>to shew that the federal government and the loyal states shoulc
</p>
<p>quietly allow them to depart and form a separate confederacy
</p>
<p>are these :
</p>
<p>That the rebellion or revolution is the act of the people oj
</p>
<p>those states exercising their sovereign will.
</p>
<p>That they have been compelled to this step in self defence hy
</p>
<p>the election of Mr. Lincoln, and the refusal of certain Northern
</p>
<p>states to fulfil the constitutional obligation of returnmg fugitive
</p>
<p>slaves.
</p>
<p>That the present position of the rebels, and the fact of their
</p>
<p>having ousted the federal government from its forts, and other
</p>
<p>property, exhibit their strength, make the revolution an accom-
</p>
<p>plished fact, and render the attempt to subjugate the Southern
</p>
<p>people utterly hopeless.
</p>
<p>That even if they were subjugated, harmonious feeling could
</p>
<p>never be restored, and that for these reasons, and especially the
</p>
<p>last, a war to marntain the integrity of the union would be alike
</p>
<p>wicked a-nd foolish.
</p>
<p>These, I believe, are their strong points fairly stated, and I will
</p>
<p>briefly state some of the grounds on which we believe them to

</p>
<p>be, one and ail, erroneous and delusive.
</p>
<p>In the first place, the fact is clear that the rebellion at the
</p>
<p>South was not in its inception like the rebellion of the American
</p>
<p>colonies,  a calm, deliberate, determined, movement of the pec
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>pie ; but that it was a conspiracy originating with a few ambi-
</p>
<p>tions pohticians, and was by them suddenly precipitated upon
</p>
<p>the people, whose right to pass upon their acts of secession has
</p>
<p>been purposely, systematically and practically denied. "There
</p>
<p>Is," said Webster,  and his words were never before so fearfully
</p>
<p>illustrated,  "no usurpation so dangerous as that which comes
</p>
<p>in the borrowed name of the people ; which calling itself their
</p>
<p>servant, exercises their power without legal right or constitu-
</p>
<p>tional sanction."
</p>
<p>You all remember the stern rebukes uttered by the Southern
</p>
<p>press, of the rash precipitancy of South Carolina, and the efforts
</p>
<p>made by their prominent statesmen, among whom Mr. Stephens
</p>
<p>was one, to stay the efforts of the rebel leaders to plunge the
</p>
<p>South into rebellion. Even after several states had by their
</p>
<p>conventions,  and the convention of Louisiana was elected by a
</p>
<p>a minority of the people  been declared out of the union ; and
</p>
<p>after delegates from those conventions had met in congress at
</p>
<p>Montgomery, and extemporized their new confederacy, the bolder
</p>
<p>part of the Southern press did not hesitate to denounce the
</p>
<p>usurpation.
</p>
<p>The " Augusta Chronicle and sentinel "  a leading paper of
</p>
<p>Georgia  openly declared th'" . the result had been produced by
</p>
<p>" wheedling, coaxing and buJying, and all the arts of deception."
</p>
<p>It said :
</p>
<p>' We know as well as any one living that the whole movement
</p>
<p>for secession and the formation of a new government, so far at
</p>
<p>least as Georgia is concerned, proceeded only on a quasi consent
</p>
<p>of the people, and was pushed through under circumstances of
</p>
<p>great excitement and frenzy by a fictitious majority." And then
</p>
<p>passing to the Montgomery congress, it added :
</p>
<p>" The Georgia convention and the confederate congress have
</p>
<p>gone forward in their work, as none can deny, without explicit
</p>
<p>and direct authority from the people." * * * " It is time
</p>
<p>that this assumption of power should cease, and that the people

</p>
<p>should bo heard. Sooner or later they must be heard. * * *
</p>
<p>Before the convention assumes to ratify the permanent consti-
</p>
<p>tution let them submit it to a vote of the people  or else, let us
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>have an election for a new convention. For union  for harmony
</p>
<p> for strength  we ask this simple act of justice."
</p>
<p>Simple justice was not the aim of Jefferson Davis and his co-
</p>
<p>conspirators. To this day the people of the South have been
</p>
<p>allowed no opportunity of passing upon the profoundest question
</p>
<p>that can affect a nation  the preservation or overthrow of its
</p>
<p>institutions; and the rebel government is an usurpation of the
</p>
<p>grossest kind, not only against the people of the United States
</p>
<p>in their sovereign capacity, but against the people of the States
</p>
<p>in whose name it assumes to act, and by whose will it pretends
</p>
<p>to have been established.
</p>
<p>The declaration, so solemnly made by the seceding conven-
</p>
<p>tions, appealing to the world for the justice of their cause, that
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's election, the non-execution of the fugitive slave
</p>
<p>law, and the personal liberty laws of northern States, compelled
</p>
<p>them to separate from a government that threatened their dear-
</p>
<p>est rights, is equally disproven out of their own mouths. Listen
</p>
<p>to the following utterances from the very leaders of the rebellion :
</p>
<p>Mk. Rhett said :  "The secession of Soutli Carolina is not the event of a
</p>
<p>day. It is not anything produced by Mr. l^incoln or by the non-esecution of
</p>
<p>the fugitive slave law. It is a matter wuich has been gathering head for
</p>
<p>years."
</p>
<p>Mr. Parker.  "It is no spasmodic effort that has come suddenly upon us,
</p>
<p>but it has been gradually culminating for a long series of years."
</p>
<p>Mr. Kkitt.  I have been engaged iii this movement ever since I entered
</p>
<p>political life."
</p>
<p>Mr. Inqlis.  Most of ns have had this matter unaer consideration for the
</p>
<p>the last twenty years."
</p>
<p>That these declarations had a broad basis of truth, and that a
</p>
<p>plot to destroy the union has been hatching for a long period
</p>
<p>and has been deferred only until a convenient opportunity, is no
</p>
<p>longer a matter of speculation. The election of Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>was not the cause but only the occasion. Mr. Everett, in a re-
</p>
<p>cent letter said, that he was "well avv^are, partly from facts

</p>
<p>within his personal knowledge, that leading Southern politicians
</p>
<p>had for thirty years been resolved to break up the union as soon
</p>
<p>as they ceased to control the United States government, and
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>that the slavery question was but a pretext for keeping up agi-
</p>
<p>tation and rallying the South."
</p>
<p>The Richmond Enquirer in 1856, declared, " If Fremont is
</p>
<p>elected the union will not last an hour after Mr. Pierce's term
</p>
<p>expires," and a careful examination will shew that from the at-
</p>
<p>tempt at nullification- by South Carolina in 1832, which was de-
</p>
<p>feated by the stern determination of General Jackson that the
</p>
<p>" union must and shall be preserved,'* a sentiment that was en-
</p>
<p>thusiastically responded to by the country at large, the design
</p>
<p>has been secretly cherished, by a knot of conspirators at the
</p>
<p>South, of destroying the union whenever the men entertaining
</p>
<p>this design should no longer be able to control its government.
</p>
<p>So long as they could enjoy its honors and emoluments, and use
</p>
<p>its prestige, its treasury, its army and its navy for their own
</p>
<p>purposes, they were content that it should stand ; but the mo-
</p>
<p>ment these were wrested from their grasp by the will of the
</p>
<p>people, that moment the union was to be destroyed.
</p>
<p>So long ago as the year 1799 Judge Marshall in a letter to
</p>
<p>Washington, dated at Richmond, remarked :
</p>
<p>" To me it seems that there are men who will hold power by
</p>
<p>any means rather than not hold it, and who would prefer a disso-
</p>
<p>lution of the union to the continuance of an administration not
</p>
<p>of their own party." And Mr. Stephens declared in regard to
</p>
<p>tlie present conspiracy that the ambition of disappointed office-
</p>
<p>seekers constituted " a great part of the trouble.
</p>
<p>General Jackson, after the South Carolina rebellion of 1832
</p>
<p>was suppressed, foretold its attempted revival at no distant pe-
</p>
<p>riod, remarking that " the first time the pretence was the tariff,
</p>
<p>and that next it would be the negro question."
</p>
<p>In 1836, twenty-five years ago, a political novel called the
</p>
<p>*' Partizan Leader," was published by Professor Beverly Tucker,
</p>
<p>of Wilham and Mary College, in Virginia. It excited no sensa-
</p>
<p>tion then, but it possesses a singular interest now. It proceeds
</p>
<p>upon the theory that the events it describes as then happening

</p>
<p>would happen twenty years after, that is, in 1856, when Fremont
</p>
<p>would have probably been elected but for the frauds in Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania ; and it gives, with singular accuracy, the programme of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy which is now in progress. The author describes
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>the southern states as seceding; " by a movement nearly simul-
</p>
<p>taneous," and immediately forming a southern confederacy. Let
</p>
<p>me quote a single paragraph :
</p>
<p>'' The suddenness of these measures was less remarkable than
</p>
<p>the prudence with which they had been conducted. The two
</p>
<p>together left little doubt that there had been a preconcert
</p>
<p>among the leading men of the several states, arranging previ-
</p>
<p>ously what should be done. * * Nor was it confined to the
</p>
<p>seceding states alone. In Virginia also there were men who en-
</p>
<p>tered into the same views. * * Not only had they sketched
</p>
<p>provisionally the plan of a southern confederacy, but they had
</p>
<p>taken measures to regulate their relations with foreign powers.''
</p>
<p>"What a flood of light is thrown upon the conspiracy by these
</p>
<p>few words from one of the earliest of the conspirators, who
</p>
<p>seems to have anticipated in part the role to be played by his
</p>
<p>own state of Virginia.
</p>
<p>There being indications of her ultimate accession to the con-
</p>
<p>foderacy, the author says :
</p>
<p>" The leading men" referred to " had determined to wait for
</p>
<p>her no longer, but to proceed to the execution of their plans,
</p>
<p>leaving her to follow."
</p>
<p>Could the acute novelist have anticipated the proceedings ol
</p>
<p>the pseudo-peace convention and the conduct of Virginia trai-
</p>
<p>tors, headed by an ex-President Tyler and an ex-Governor Wise,
</p>
<p>he might have eulogised the leaders of the ancient dominion for
</p>
<p>their treacherous skill in deluding the country with schemes ol
</p>
<p>compromise while the preparations of the rebels were advancing
</p>
<p>to completion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Everett, who was a warm advocate for the peace conven-
</p>
<p>tion, has told us that " those conciliatory demonstrations had no
</p>
<p>effect in staying the progress of secession, because the leaders ol
</p>
<p>that revolution were determined not to be satisfied."
</p>
<p>In reference to the measures referred to by Professor Tucker,
</p>
<p>looking towards the relations of the new confederacy with foreign

</p>
<p>powers, it may be worth while to allude to a recent statement,
</p>
<p>that in the days of Mr. Calhoun a plan for the dissolution of the
</p>
<p>union and the formation of a great slaveholding power, was
</p>
<p>presented by his friends to Lord Aberdeen, and that some words
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>attributed to that statesman, are supposed to have given rise to
</p>
<p>the hopes of British sympathy, in which soutliern politicians
</p>
<p>have so frequently indulged. It is said on high authority that
</p>
<p>at different times, and especially in 1851, these projects have
</p>
<p>been broached to members of the British ministry, and that on
</p>
<p>that occasion they were disclosed by Lord Palmerston to our
</p>
<p>minister, Mr. Abbott Lawrence, and that the southern commis-
</p>
<p>sioners disheartened by the coolness with which their overtures
</p>
<p>were received, and also by the fate of the Lopez expedition, re-
</p>
<p>turned discomfited to the United States.
</p>
<p>In 1857 Mr. Mason, '^of Virginia, announced as a fact, on the
</p>
<p>floor of the senate, that the British government had changed its
</p>
<p>opinion on the slavery question, but an early occasion was taken
</p>
<p>by that government to contradict the assertion of Mr. Mason,
</p>
<p>the Duke of Argyll declaring that he was instructed by her
</p>
<p>Majesty's ministers to do so.*
</p>
<p>Blind as we have all been to the catastrophe that awaited us,
</p>
<p>uncons'cious as were the people, both at the north and at the
</p>
<p>south, of this preconcert among ^ few leaders in the different
</p>
<p>states, we can now trace step b step the progress of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy and read the history . the last thirty years without an
</p>
<p>interpreter ; we can understand the motive of the Texan rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, the war with Mexico, the persistent efforts to secure
</p>
<p>Cuba, the fillibustering expeditions to Central America and the
</p>
<p>determination to re-open the African slave trade. Wo can ap-
</p>
<p>preciate, too, the caution with which the plan of the rebellion
</p>
<p>was concealed, and especially the adroitness with which the peo
</p>
<p>pie were allowed no time for reflection, noopportunity for action,
</p>
<p>their consent assumed on the plea of necessary haste, and the
</p>
<p>acts of secession pushed through the conventions, as charged by
</p>
<p>the Georgian editor, with no regard to popular rights and under
</p>
<p>circumstances of excitement and frenzy, by fictitious majorities.
</p>
<p>The doctrine of secession, earnestly as it had been advocated,
</p>
<p>failed to convince the capitalists, the planters, and the common-

<p>sense statesmen of the South  even in South Carolina.
</p>
<p>A few years eince Mr. Boyce of that State, late a member of

</p>
<p>by the Commeraal Advertiser, January 30, 1861.

</p>
<p>the house of representatives, in an address to the people, after
</p>
<p>shewing that by secession they would k)se the vitahty of a state,
</p>
<p>that they \vould exist only by tolerance, a painful and humili-
</p>
<p>ating spectacle, that it would involve a sacrifice of the present
</p>
<p>without in anywise gaining in the future, emidiatically declar-
</p>
<p>ed, " such is the intensity of my conviction on the subject, that if
</p>
<p>secession should take place, of which I have no idea, for I can-
</p>
<p>not believe in such stupendous madness, I shall consider the in-
</p>
<p>stitution of slavery as doomed, and that the great God in our
</p>
<p>blindness has made us the instrument of its destruction."
</p>
<p>Even so late as the autumn of 1860 and after the presidential
</p>
<p>election that announced the defeat of the slave power which had
</p>
<p>so long ruled the country, the leading men of the South who had
</p>
<p>not been in the plot battled manfully against it. On the 14th of
</p>
<p>November last, Mr. Stephens of Georgia, now the vice-president
</p>
<p>of the rebel confederacy, delivered a long and able speech in the
</p>
<p>Georgia house of representatives m which, in answer to the
</p>
<p>question whether the Southern states should secede in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of Mr. Lincoln's election, he said :
</p>
<p>" My countrymen, I tell you frankly, candidly, and earnestly,
</p>
<p>that I do not think that they ought."
</p>
<p>Reminding them of the sacred obligation resting on them to
</p>
<p>be true to their national engagements, he exclaimed :
</p>
<p>" If the republic is to go down, let us be found to the last mo-
</p>
<p>ment standing on the deck, with the Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States waving over our heads." And this sentiment was greeted
</p>
<p>with applause.
</p>
<p>He expressed his belief that Mr. Lincoln would do nothing to
</p>
<p>hazard their safety or security, and shewed them the wisdom of
</p>
<p>our system with its checks and guards. He reminded them that
</p>
<p>the president was powerless unless backed by congress  that
</p>
<p>the house of representatives was largely against him, and that
</p>
<p>there would be a majority of four against him in the senate, and

<p>state, could consistently hold office under Mr. Lincoln, remind-
</p>
<p>ed them that such office could be honorably held, for it would
</p>
<p>be conferred by the approval of a democratic senate  and this
</p>
<p>exposition was received with " prolonged applause."
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>Mr. Stephens frankly avowed that he would never submit to
</p>
<p>any republican aggression on their constitutional rights to pre-
</p>
<p>serve the union, but insisted that all their rights could be se-
</p>
<p>cured in the union, and emphatically declared, " That this gov-
</p>
<p>ernment of our fathers with all its defects, comes nearer the ob-
</p>
<p>jects of all good governments than any other on the face of the
</p>
<p>earth, is my settled conviction." * * "Have we not at the
</p>
<p>South, as well as at the North, grown great, prosperous, and hap-
</p>
<p>py under its operation ? Has any ^^art of the world ever shewn
</p>
<p>such rapid progress in the development of wealth, and all the
</p>
<p>material resources of national power and greatness as the South-
</p>
<p>ern States have under the general government, notwithstand-
</p>
<p>all its defects ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Stephens then, with jihilosophic skill, shewed that the in-
</p>
<p>stitutions of a people constitute the matrix from which spring
</p>
<p>all their characteristics of development and greatness. " Look,"
</p>
<p>he said, " at Greece. There is the same fertile soil, the same
</p>
<p>blue sky, the same inlets and harbours, the same Egean, the
</p>
<p>same Olympus ; there is the same land where Homer sung,
</p>
<p>where Pericles spoke ; it is the same old Greece  but it is living
</p>
<p>Greece no more." He pictured its ruin of art and civilization,
</p>
<p>and traced that ruin to the downfall fo its institutions. He
</p>
<p>drew the same lesson from Italy and Rome, once mistress of
</p>
<p>the world, and solemnly warned them that where liberty is once
</p>
<p>destroyed it may never return again.
</p>
<p>Coming back to the state of Georgia he referred to the anxi-
</p>
<p>ety of many there in 1850 to secede from the Union  and
</p>
<p>shewed that since 1850 the material wealth of Georgia, as a mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the Union, had nearly if not quite doubled.
</p>
<p>He spoke of the prosperity in agriculture, commerce, art,
</p>
<p>science, and every department of education, physical and mental,
</p>
<p>and warned thein against listening to the like temptation as that
</p>
<p>offered to our progenitors in the Garden of Eden  when they
</p>
<p>were led to believe that they would become as gods, and yielding

</p>
<p>in an evil hour saw only their own nakedness.
</p>
<p>" I look," he said, " upon this country, with its institutions, as
</p>
<p>the Eden of the world, the paradise of the universe. It maybe
</p>
<p>that out of it we may become greater and more prosperous ; but
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>I am candid and sincere in telling you, that I fear if we rashly
</p>
<p>evince passion and without sufficient cause shall take that step,
</p>
<p>that instead of becoming greater or more peaceful, prosperous
</p>
<p>and happy  instead of becoming gods, we will become demons,
</p>
<p>and at no distant day commence cutting one another's throats."
</p>
<p>There, my countrymen, we have the testimony of the vice-pres-
</p>
<p>ident of the rebel confederacy, and the fact that Mr. Stephens,
</p>
<p>like our progenitors of whom he spoke, yielded to temptation
</p>
<p>and became a chief abettor of the scheme of ruin which he so
</p>
<p>strongly deprecated, detracts nothing from the value of this re-
</p>
<p>markable speech. His treachery proves only his own weakness;
</p>
<p>it impeaches neither the truth of his facts, the aptness of his
</p>
<p>illustrations nor the conclusions to which he was led by his his-
</p>
<p>toric experience and irresistible logic.
</p>
<p>Already in South Carolina, first and chiefest of the seceding
</p>
<p>states, have men professing to be respectable, men whose names
</p>
<p>connect them in past generations, with Englishmen of gentle
</p>
<p>blood and Huguenots of heroic fame, men who for years have
</p>
<p>borne in foreign climes the proud title of American citizens, and
</p>
<p>who know the simple dignity of the American republic among
</p>
<p>the nations of the earth,  already are these men, since they
</p>
<p>discarded the protection of the federal government, so lost to
</p>
<p>self respect that they are not only ready to submit to a foreign
</p>
<p>yoke but, according to their eulogist, Mr. Russell, in a paragraph
</p>
<p>I will presently quote, they actually whimper like children for
</p>
<p>the privilege of becoming the vassals of an European princelet.
</p>
<p>We have glanced at the secret history of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Now, let me ask, on what ground does this usurping confederacy
</p>
<p>ask to be recognized as independent and admitted to the family
</p>
<p>of nations?
</p>
<p>In the convention of South Carolina, in reply to an objection
</p>
<p>that the declaration reported by the committee dwelt too much
</p>
<p>on the fugitive slave law and personal liberty bills, as giving it
</p>
<p>the appearance of special pleading, Mr. Memminger said : " Al-

</p>
<p>low me to say to the honorable gentleman, that when you take
</p>
<p>position that you have a right to break your faith, to destroy an
</p>
<p>agreement that you have made, to tear off your seal from the
</p>
<p>document to which it is affixed, you are bound to justify yourself
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>fullv to all the nations of the world, for there is nothincr that
</p>
<p>that casts such a stain upon tlie escutchc(M^. of a nation as a
</p>
<p>breach of faith."
</p>
<p>In this Mr. Memminger was clearly right, and the alleged breach
</p>
<p>of faith by the North, touching the execution of the fugitive
</p>
<p>slave law was resorted to as affording a plausible pretext for
</p>
<p>seceding from the union. But the debates shew that this pretext
</p>
<p>was a sham, and Mr. Rhett frankly declared that he regarded
</p>
<p>the fugitive slave law as unconstitutional, and that Mr. Webster
</p>
<p>and Mr. Keitt had expressed the same opinion.
</p>
<p>You have seen, too, from Mr. Stephens, that all the constitu-
</p>
<p>tional rights of the South were protected within the union  and
</p>
<p>that the South was indebted to the union for her safety, pros-
</p>
<p>perity and happiness.
</p>
<p>What then is the real ground on which the breach of faith
</p>
<p>committed by the seceding states is to be justified, if it can be
</p>
<p>justified at all ; on what ground is it recommended to the preju-
</p>
<p>dices of the South and to the impartial judgment of the world ?
</p>
<p>After secession was an accomplished fact, so far as their con-
</p>
<p>ventions could manage it by usurped authority and fictitious ma
</p>
<p>jorities, and Mr. Stephens had become not only a member but a
</p>
<p>prominent leader of the conspiracy, he said at Atlanta :
</p>
<p>"The foundations of our new government are laid, its corner-
</p>
<p>stone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to
</p>
<p>the white man ; that slavery, subordination to the superior race
</p>
<p>is his natural and moral condition. This our new government is
</p>
<p>the first in the history of the world based upon this great physi-
</p>
<p>cal, philosophical and moral truth."
</p>
<p>Mr. Stephens enlarged upon this distinguishing characteristic
</p>
<p>of the government, to establish which the union was to be dis-
</p>
<p>solved, sneered at the principle that all men are equal, enunciat-
</p>
<p>ed by our fathers in the declaration of independence " as the
</p>
<p>pestilent heresy of fancy politicians "  declared that " African
</p>
<p>inequality and the equality of white men were the chief corner-

<p>stone of the southern republic!" and claimed that with a gov-
</p>
<p>ernment so founded " the world would recognize in theirs the
</p>
<p>the model nation of history."
</p>
<p>Here we have their only apology for this rebellion, stripped
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>of all shams and disguises, and thus at length in the latter half
</p>
<p>of the nineteenth century, stand face to face in deadly conflict
</p>
<p>the antagonist systems of the new world.
</p>
<p>" All men," said the founders of the American republic, " are
</p>
<p>created free and equal and endowed with certain inalienable
</p>
<p>rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
</p>
<p>ness." " Let it ever be remembered," said the continental con-
</p>
<p>gress, " that the rights for which we have contended were the
</p>
<p>rights of human nature," and on that foundation arose the fair
</p>
<p>fabric of our liberties.
</p>
<p>The dark shadow arises of another confederacy which Davis
</p>
<p>and Keitt and Floyd and Toombs are striving to establish on the
</p>
<p>ruins of the republic erected by Washington and Franklin and
</p>
<p>Hamilton and Jefferson, and the one great plea wi:h which this
</p>
<p>new power seeks to recommend itself to the Christian world, is
</p>
<p>the assumption that the white man was born to be the master
</p>
<p>and the black man was created to be his slave
</p>
<p>The attempt of the slavery insurrectionists to bring into con-
</p>
<p>tempt the great principle of the declaration of independence,
</p>
<p>and their characterizing the men who uttered it and the men who
</p>
<p>beheve in it as " fancy politicians," shews how absolutely antago-
</p>
<p>nist in their principles were those who rebelled in '76 against
</p>
<p>unconstitutional acts of parliament, and those who in '61 are re-
</p>
<p>belling against the constitution of the United States. Even in
</p>
<p>the august year which we are met to celebrate, the principles
</p>
<p>and reasonings of our fathers commanded the admiration of
</p>
<p>Europe, and called forth in the house of Lords that magnificent
</p>
<p>eulogy of Chatham, when he said that for himself he must de-
</p>
<p>clare that he had studied and admired the free states of an-
</p>
<p>tiquity, the master states of the world : but that for solidity of
</p>
<p>; reasoning, force of sagacity and wisdom of conclusion, no body
</p>
<p>"*of men could stand in preference to the congress of Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia.
</p>
<p>Whatever may be the future of America the past is safe.

<p>The confederates of the slave republic, unrivalled as may be
</p>
<p>their skill in robbing us of material we-alth and power, cannot
</p>
<p>rob the founders of our union of their glory  cannot filch from
</p>
<p>us the treasures we possess in their great principles, cannot lea-
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>sen by the tithe of a hair, the truth and force of their exam-
</p>
<p>ple.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, tlie formation of the Southern confederacy
</p>
<p>adds new proof to their farsighted and prophetic sagacity.
</p>
<p>Look at the rebel states, plunged into anarchy and war by Jef-
</p>
<p>ferson Davis, with a fettered press, free speech silenced, forced
</p>
<p>loans, and an army enlarged by conscription, and then listen to
</p>
<p>a single passage from William Finkney, the great orator of
</p>
<p>Maryland, which occurs in a speech made in the Maryland house
</p>
<p>of delegates, in 1789 : and remember as you listen to it the proof
</p>
<p>I have already given j'ou that the so-called Southern confederacy
</p>
<p>is a military despotism, extemporized and precipitated on the
</p>
<p>people of the South, who have never been allowed to express
</p>
<p>their will in regard to the substitution of the Montgomery con-
</p>
<p>etitution, for the ancient constitution and government which the
</p>
<p>confederates are striving to destroy.
</p>
<p>Said Mr. Pinkney :
</p>
<p>" That the dangerous consequences of the system of bondage
</p>
<p>have not as yet been felt does not prove that they never will be.
</p>
<p>* * To me, sir, nothing for which I have not the evidence of
</p>
<p>my senses is more clear than that it will one day destroy that
</p>
<p>reverence for liberty which is the vital principle of a republic.
</p>
<p>" While a majority of your citizens are accustomed to rule
</p>
<p>with the authority of despots within particular limits, while your
</p>
<p>youth are reared in the habit of thinking that the great rights
</p>
<p>of human nature are not so sacred but they may with innocence
</p>
<p>be trampled on, can it be expected that the public mind should
</p>
<p>glow with that generous ardor in the cause of freedom which
</p>
<p>can alone save a government like ours from the lurl-wg demon of
</p>
<p>usurpation ? Do you not dread contamination of principle ?
</p>
<p>Have you no alarms for the continuance of that spirit, which
</p>
<p>once conducted us to victory and independence when the talons
</p>
<p>of power were unclasped for our destruction ? Have you no
</p>
<p>apprehension that when the votaries of freedom sacrifice also at

</p>
<p>the gloomy altars of slavery, they will at length become apos-
</p>
<p>tates from the former ? For my own part, I have no hope that
</p>
<p>the stream of general liberty will flow forever unpolluted through
</p>
<p>the foul mire of partial bondage, or that they who have been
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>habituated to lord it over others, will not in time be base enougl
</p>
<p>to let others lord it over them. If they resist it will be tht
</p>
<p>struggle o^ pride and selfishness, not o^ principled
</p>
<p>The hour so philosophically predicted seventy-two years ag(
</p>
<p>has come. The usurping hand is lifted against the most be
</p>
<p>nignant government the world has ever seen. The usurpatioi
</p>
<p>is unresisted, the country is precipitated into war : and populai
</p>
<p>government overthrown and a military rule established, the peo
</p>
<p>pie, it would seem, have cast to the world the historic memories
</p>
<p>we this day meet to celebrate. Mr. Russell, the corresponden
</p>
<p>of the London Times, now travelling at the South, treated witl
</p>
<p>every attention, charmed with their courtesy, and evidently in
</p>
<p>clined to regard their rebel movement with a favorable eye
</p>
<p>writes from South Carolina on the 30th April, and makes thii
</p>
<p>sad disclosure : " From all quarters have come to my ears th(
</p>
<p>echoes of the same voice ; it may be feigned, but there is no dis
</p>
<p>cord in the note, and it sounds in wonderful strength anr
</p>
<p>monotony all over the country. Shades of George III., of North
</p>
<p>of Johnson, of all who contended against the great rebellior
</p>
<p>which tore these colonies from England, can you hear the chorus
</p>
<p>which rings through the state of Marion, Sumpter anc
</p>
<p>Pinckney and not clap your ghostly hands in triumph? tha'
</p>
<p>voice says ' If we could only get one of the royal race of Eng
</p>
<p>land to rule over us we should be content.' "
</p>
<p>Let me say next a word of the means by which a conspirac}
</p>
<p>so contemptible in its origin, so destitute of moral weight and o:
</p>
<p>popular support has attained to its present dimensions, ousting
</p>
<p>the federal government of its jurisdiction in more than half ol
</p>
<p>our national territory to the East of the Rocky Mountains, anc
</p>
<p>obtaining possession of arsenals and navy yards and fortresses
</p>
<p>seventeen in number, which had cost the American people more
</p>
<p>than seven millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>On the 29th October, 1860, before the presidential election
</p>
<p>lieut. general Scott wrote a letter to president Buchanan in which

<p>he referred to the secession excitement which the leaders of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy were actively fanning at the South, and remarked,
</p>
<p>that if this glorious union were broken by whatever line politi-
</p>
<p>cal madness might contrive, there would be no hope of reuniting
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>the fragments, except by the laceration and despotism of the
</p>
<p>sword. Pointing out the dani^-er, he proceeded to jjoint out the
</p>
<p>prevention.
</p>
<p>" From a knowledge of our southern population," he said, " it
</p>
<p>is my solemn conviction that there is some danger of an early
</p>
<p>act of rashness preliminary to secession, viz. : the seizure of
</p>
<p>some or all of the following posts : Forts Jackson and Philip in
</p>
<p>the Mississippi, below New Orleans, both without garrisons ;
</p>
<p>Fort Morgan, below Mobile, without a garrison. Forts Pickens
</p>
<p>and McRae, Pensacola harbor, with an insufficient garrison for
</p>
<p>one ; Fort Pulaski below Savannah, Avithout a garrison ; Forts
</p>
<p>Moultrie and Sumpter, Charleston harbor, the former with an
</p>
<p>insufficient garrison, and the latter without any, and Fort Mon-
</p>
<p>roe, Hampton Roads, without a sufficient garrison. In my
</p>
<p>opinion all these works should immediately be so garrisoned as
</p>
<p>to make any attempt to take any one of them, by surprise or
</p>
<p>coiipde main, ridiculous.
</p>
<p>" With an army, faithful to its allegiance and the navy probably
</p>
<p>equally so, and with a federal executive for the next twelve
</p>
<p>months of firmness and moderation, which the country has a
</p>
<p>right to expect  moderation being an element of power, not less
</p>
<p>than firmness  there is good reason to hope that the danger of
</p>
<p>secession may be made to pass away without one conflict of
</p>
<p>arms, one execution or one arrest for treason."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, lieut. general Scott knew Avell, we all know, that
</p>
<p>"what he recommended Mr. Buchanan to do an honest executive
</p>
<p>might have done. Again and again in the history of our country
</p>
<p>have attempts been made to resist the execution of the laws, and
</p>
<p>again and again has the federal government triumphantly vindi-
</p>
<p>cated its supremacy.
</p>
<p>The first armed rebellion Avas that headed by Shay in Massa-
</p>
<p>chusetts in the Winter of 1787. The rebels attempted to seize
</p>
<p>the arsenal, and were met with cannon that killed three
</p>
<p>and wounded another of their number, and the state militia, un-

</p>
<p>der the command of Gen. Lincoln routed their forces, taking
</p>
<p>many prisoners, and peace was restored, not by any compromise
</p>
<p>but by the enforcement of the laws.
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>As a Lincoln suppressed the first rebellion, so will a Lincoln
</p>
<p>suppress the last.
</p>
<p>You will readily call to mind other similar occasions, where the
</p>
<p>federal government by prompt action maintained its supremacy
</p>
<p>unimpaired.
</p>
<p>Next came the whiskey rebellion in Pennsylvania during the
</p>
<p>administration of Washington, to suppress which the president
</p>
<p>called out fifteen thousand men from three different states led
</p>
<p>by their governors and general Morgan, whom Washington at
</p>
<p>first proposed himself to accompany across the Alleghanies.
</p>
<p>Next president Jefferson crushed in the bud the opening con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of Aaron Burr.
</p>
<p>President Madison during the war of 1816, when doubts were
</p>
<p>entertained of the loyalty of the Hartford conventionists, who
</p>
<p>were falsely reported to be in correspondence with the enemy,
</p>
<p>stationed major Jessup, of Kentucky, at Hartford with a regi-
</p>
<p>ment to suppress any sudden outbreak. Gen. Jackson, about
</p>
<p>the same time in New Orleans, proclaimed martial law in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of attempts by the civil authorities to embarrass the
</p>
<p>necessary measures of defence.
</p>
<p>President Jackson, in 1832, repressed by the arm of general
</p>
<p>Scott, and amid the hearty applause of the nation, the defiant
</p>
<p>nullification of South Carolina, and president Tyler, in 1843,
</p>
<p>with the approval of his secretary, Mr. John 0. Calhoun, sent
</p>
<p>United States troops to Rhode Island to suppress the state revo-
</p>
<p>lution organized by a majority ot the people of the state, but in
</p>
<p>violation of the existing state constitution, under the leadership
</p>
<p>of governor Thomas W. Doi'r.
</p>
<p>When in 1860 general Scott, in advance of any outbreak, recom-
</p>
<p>mended president Buchanan to reinforce the forts, instead of re-
</p>
<p>commending active measures of interference, such as his predeces-
</p>
<p>sors whom I have named did not hesitate to take, he simply asked
</p>
<p>of the president to do what any intelligent school boy could see
</p>
<p>was absolutely proper and essential  and what he could accom-

</p>
<p>plish by a single word. Mr. Buchanan guided by his secretary of
</p>
<p>war, the traitor and thief John B. Floyd, refused to order the re-
</p>
<p>inforcement of the fortresses ; all the forts named by general
</p>
<p>Scott, excepting fort Pickens, were seized by the confederates ;
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>and on the fact of their quiet possession, and the aid and com-
</p>
<p>fort thus given to the rebels by the federal cabinet, was based
</p>
<p>the secession of the traitorous states and the formation of the new
</p>
<p>confederacy.
</p>
<p>The fact thus becomes clear as day, that not simply all the
</p>
<p>strength the rebel confederacy originally possessed but its very
</p>
<p>organization and existence, were due not to the people of the
</p>
<p>South, on whom without their sanction it was precipitated, nor to
</p>
<p>the leaders, skillful as they may have been, who had neither arms
</p>
<p>nor armies to overpower the government, but they were due to
</p>
<p>the federal executive and his advisers of the cabinet. This fact
</p>
<p>is so interesting as a matter of history, it is so important to a
</p>
<p>right understanding of the whole subject, and bears so clearly
</p>
<p>upon the question, what is our duty as citizens and what the
</p>
<p>policy of our government, as regards the tolerance or suppression
</p>
<p>of this rebellion, that you will allow me to quote one authority
</p>
<p>upon the point from among the rebels themselves.
</p>
<p>The Richmond Examiner in an elaborate eulogy of Floyd, who
</p>
<p>in the extent and infamy of his treachery certainly excelled his
</p>
<p>fellow traitors in the cabinet, makes this plain avowal. " All who
</p>
<p>have attended to the developments of the last three months and
</p>
<p>knew aught of the movements of the Buchanan administration up
</p>
<p>to the time of Floyd's resignation, will justify the assertion that
</p>
<p>the southern confederacy would not and could not be in ex-
</p>
<p>istence at this hour, but for the action of the late secretary of
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>" The plan invented by general Scott to stop secession was like
</p>
<p>all campaigns devised by him, very able in its details and nearly
</p>
<p>certain of general success. The Southern states are full of arse-
</p>
<p>nals and forts commanding their rivers and strategic points :
</p>
<p>general Scott desired to transfer the army of the United States
</p>
<p>to these forts as speedily and as quietly as possible. The
</p>
<p>Southern states could not cut off communication between the
</p>
<p>government and the fortresses without a great fleet, which they

<p>can not build for years ; or take them by land without one hun-

<p>dred thousand men, many hundred millions of dollars, several
</p>
<p>campaigns, and many a bloody siege. Had Scott been able to

<p>27
</p>
<p>have got these forts in the condition he desired them to be, the
</p>
<p>southern confederacy woukl not now exist."
</p>
<p>Such is the truth fairly stated by the Richmond ^a^ammer, in
</p>
<p>the interest of the rebels. The union has been severed, not by
</p>
<p>violence from without, but by treachery within. It has been
</p>
<p>convulsed from its centre to its circumference, not from any in-
</p>
<p>ternal weakness in our federal system, but by the infernal vil-
</p>
<p>lainy of our federal rulers.
</p>
<p>Traitors have betrayed the union, traitors have betrayed our
</p>
<p>forts ; and the betrayal no more proves moral weakness in the
</p>
<p>one case than it does material weakness in the other. There is
</p>
<p>no fortification so impregnable but that a traitorous governor
</p>
<p>may yield it without a blow  neither is there any government
</p>
<p>on God's earth, that secret treachery may not enfeeble or tempo-
</p>
<p>rarily overthrow.
</p>
<p>" If," said Webster, " those appointed to defend the castle
</p>
<p>shall betray it, woe betide those within. Let us hope," he add-
</p>
<p>ed, and how vain the hope as regards ourselves ! " that we shall
</p>
<p>never see the time when the government shall be found in oppo-
</p>
<p>sition to the constitution, and whun the guardians of the union
</p>
<p>shall become its betrayers."
</p>
<p>I do not mean to say, gentlemen, that president Buchanan,
</p>
<p>who, at the close of his administration partially redeemed its
</p>
<p>character, by calling to his counsels those brave men and true
</p>
<p>patriots, Mr. Holt and general Dix, was personally privy to the
</p>
<p>designs of the f^ilse secretaries whom they replaced : but it is
</p>
<p>nevertheless true that he is the man who, under the constitution
</p>
<p>is directly responsible to the American people for the acts of
</p>
<p>his administration.
</p>
<p>In his position timidity was treason and inaction was crime.
</p>
<p>He alone could execute the laws, he had the power to execute
</p>
<p>them, and he did not execute them ; and for the simple want of
</p>
<p>their non-execution the country drifted rapidly towards destruc-
</p>
<p>tion. This was a case which the founders of our republic had

<p>not anticipated. As Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, aptly said, "the
</p>
<p>constitution provided against every probable vacancy in the
</p>
<p>office of president, but did not provide for utter imbecility."
</p>
<p>I am aware that Mr. Buchanan's friends attribute his conduct
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>in the whole matter to an amiable credulity and a humane desire
</p>
<p>to avoid the shedding of a drop of blood. I am sure that none
</p>
<p>of us would wish to deprive him of whatever benefit he may de-
</p>
<p>rive from the plea of virtuous motives, but allowing them all
</p>
<p>the force they are entitled to, we must still exclaim :
</p>
<p>" Curse on his virtues, they've undone his country !"
</p>
<p>For no other of the confederates in this great villainy will the
</p>
<p>candid historian venture with success, the apology of mental im-
</p>
<p>becility or moral cowardice. They are men who make the boast
</p>
<p>that for long years it has been the aimof tlieir existence to over-
</p>
<p>throw, not by open and honorable opposition, but secretly, trai-
</p>
<p>torously and by subornation ot treason, the most benignant
</p>
<p>government in the world, and one to which they were bound by
</p>
<p>solemn oaths and by sacred honor. They are men who, pretend-
</p>
<p>ing to be gentlemen, have made conspiracy a trade and perjury
</p>
<p>a habit. They have blended professions of patriotism with the
</p>
<p>practice of treason, linked the duties of a senator with the posi-
</p>
<p>tion of a spy, and made a seat in the cabinet the office of a thief.
</p>
<p>With a refinement of meanness that could belong to no chivalry
</p>
<p>but that of slaveholding, and would be practised by no knights
</p>
<p>save those of " the golden circle," they have to the last moment
</p>
<p>drawn their official salaries from the nation they were betraying ;
</p>
<p>they have perfected their schemes of plunder in the very capital
</p>
<p>which they were seeking to cripple, and beneath the folds of the
</p>
<p>flag that they were swearing to support and plotting to humble.
</p>
<p>They are men in brief  for the subject is a revolting one  avIio,
</p>
<p>imitating Judas and rivalling Arnold, have made their daily life
</p>
<p>simply and purely a clail}^ lie.
</p>
<p>Did time permit me, I would like briefly to refer to the national
</p>
<p>events that, following in quick succession, liave interrupted what
</p>
<p>Mr. Seward happily calls " the majestic march of our national
</p>
<p>progress ;" the successive seizure of Southern forts in obedi-
</p>
<p>ence to telegrams from the senate chamber, the spread of
</p>
<p>Southern treason like the wild fire of the prairies, the consterna-

<p>tion of the people, the apathy of the executive, the plot to seize
</p>
<p>the capitol, intended to be executed in January and repeatedly
</p>
<p>postponed till the attempt involved too serious danger, the sys-
</p>
<p>tematic efforts in the departments of the treasury, of the interior,
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>of war, and I fear also, of the navy, to cripple the United States,
</p>
<p>to strengthen the rebels, and to close the term of the administra-
</p>
<p>tion by a coitp d'etat, that should give to the new confederacy the
</p>
<p>power and the prestige of the old government, and the prepara-
</p>
<p>tions made by northern confederates whom the rebels had been
</p>
<p>taught to believe represented the great northern democracy, for
</p>
<p>assisting the plot and joining at the right moment in a general
</p>
<p>revolution.
</p>
<p>Lost themselves to a sense of honor, they ceased to believe in
</p>
<p>its existence at the North. They seem to have been unable to
</p>
<p>distinguish between a defence of the constitutional rights of
</p>
<p>slaveholders within the union and under the constitution, and a
</p>
<p>war in behalf of slavery for the severance of the union, the
</p>
<p>overthrow of the constitution, the desecration of our flag, and
</p>
<p>the humiliation of our country. Then came the interruption of
</p>
<p>their plans by the premature discovery of the theft of the In-
</p>
<p>dian bonds and other villanies, compelling the retirement of the
</p>
<p>traitorous secretaries Cobb, Thompson and Floyd : the advent
</p>
<p>of Holt and Dix reviving the hopes of the nation, and the im.
</p>
<p>mortal order of the latter, which rung like a trumpet through
</p>
<p>the land, " If any man shall attempt to pull down the national
</p>
<p>flag shoot him on the spot."
</p>
<p>Then came the ofiicial announcement to the country, by the
</p>
<p>counting of the electoral votes, of the people's choice, next the
</p>
<p>safe arrival of Mr. Lincoln in Washington, unharmed by the as-
</p>
<p>sassins who had sworn to take his life ; then the inauguration,
</p>
<p>simple and imposing, the oath administered by the chief jus-
</p>
<p>tice of the United States, and the quiet transfer of such rem-
</p>
<p>nants of the federal property as had not been stolen from the
</p>
<p>people under the retiring administration.
</p>
<p>A month of apparent inaction on the part of the new admin-
</p>
<p>istration, engaged in disentangling the web of treachery, and
</p>
<p>learning how much of treason lingered in the departments  a

<p>began to hear the bitter taunts of England at the spiritless
</p>
<p>people of the great North who were being driven to dissolution
</p>
<p>and infamy without an effort at resistance, and relinquishing
</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>tlieir nationality to a rebellion without striking a blow in its de-
</p>
<p>fence.
</p>
<p>We had a brief foretaste of the ignominy tliat awaits a nation
</p>
<p>which basely surrenders its integrity and its independence, and
</p>
<p>we heard the prelude of the shout that would greet the downfall
</p>
<p>of the union, and the epitaph that should record :
</p>
<p>* * " But yesterday it might
</p>
<p>Have stood against the world ; now lies it there
</p>
<p>And none so poor to do it reverence."
</p>
<p>Assured of the integrity and patriotism of the President and
</p>
<p>the wisdom of his cabinet, the North waited as only a brave
</p>
<p>people, conscious of their strength and of the justice of their
</p>
<p>cause could afford to wait. The strength of the government was
</p>
<p>gradually developed, the war and navy departments began to
</p>
<p>exhibit signs of life  and the great statesman of the West, who
</p>
<p>sacrificing political ambition and personal preferences, had con-
</p>
<p>sented to preside over a depleted Treasury, renewed the miracle
</p>
<p>attributed by Webster to Alexander Hamilton : "He smote the
</p>
<p>rock of the national resources, and abundant streams of revenue
</p>
<p>gushed forth. He touched the dead body of the public credit,
</p>
<p>and it sprang upon its feet."
</p>
<p>Desperate as our situation seemed, capitalists demanded no
</p>
<p>other security than the name of Chase, and when he asked for a
</p>
<p>loan of eight millions, more than thirty millions were instantly
</p>
<p>offered.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have not time to dwell on the attack onSumpter,
</p>
<p>the attack of ten thousand men on one hundred men, and the ill-
</p>
<p>judged boast of Governor Pickens that they had humbled the
</p>
<p>star-spangled banner for the first time in seventy years. They
</p>
<p>themselves by that act and that boast initiated an irresistible
</p>
<p>conflict that will hardly cease till the stars and stripes again float
</p>
<p>in their beauty from every fortress in our land.
</p>
<p>That bombardment, as was remarked by one of the Judges of the
</p>
<p>supreme court, " blew all the plots ot the traitors into the air,

</p>
<p>and inaugurated a change in the sentiment of th? country that
</p>
<p>seemed all but miraculous." It awoke the deep love of country
</p>
<p>which had slumbered beneath the platforms of party and com-
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>mercial interest. It ended at once the absurd cry of " no coer-
</p>
<p>cion," as applicable to a goverjiment in enforcing its laws, and
</p>
<p>protecting its existence. The rebels by that act closed the door
</p>
<p>of compromise and reconciliation which had thus far been kept
</p>
<p>open. They rejected the appeal to a convention of the American
</p>
<p>people, to which the president in his inaugural had assented 
</p>
<p>they selected instead the arbitrament of force, the great trial by
</p>
<p>battle. They struck at the very heart of the nation when they
</p>
<p>sought to humble the flag of our union that had protected them
</p>
<p>from infancy, and which from childhood we have loved. They
</p>
<p>themselves inaugurated war. They imposed upon us the most
</p>
<p>sacred duty that can devolve ur on a people of protecting their
</p>
<p>nationality, and the world that had wondered at a forbearance
</p>
<p>which they could not understand, now Vs^ondered again at the
</p>
<p>spontaneous uprising of a mighty nation.
</p>
<p>The threatened attack on Washington, the disloyalty of Balti-
</p>
<p>more, the cutting off of all communication by railroad and tele-
</p>
<p>graph between the national capital and the great North, com-
</p>
<p>pleted the work begun at Sumyjter.
</p>
<p>Party lines grew faint and vanished as completely as though they
</p>
<p>had never existed. Washington has been described as leaning
</p>
<p>in the darkest hour of the revolution, with one arm resting on
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, and the other on North Carolina. The faithless-
</p>
<p>ness of the latter to her historic memories, prevents the parallel
</p>
<p>being now complete, but we may say of Lincoln what can be
</p>
<p>said of no other president since Washington, that in this dark
</p>
<p>hour he rests with one great arm upon his political friends, and
</p>
<p>the other on his political opponents, and that, as he looks abroad
</p>
<p>over the country whose destinies ore in his keeping, he sees
</p>
<p>neither republicans, nor democrats  ^i either nativists, nor
</p>
<p>aliens  he sees but two classes, loyal citizens on the one side,
</p>
<p>and traitors on the other.
</p>
<p>The feeling exhibited throughout the loyal states is not as
</p>
<p>some Europeans have supposed, an ebullition of enthusiasm,

<p>based upon sudden and evanescent passion, but the expression of
</p>
<p>a profound conviction gradually forced upon them by a long
</p>
<p>train of facts that culminated at Sumpter, that both duty and
</p>
<p>liOiior imperatively demand that they shall crush this gigantic
</p>
<p>conspiracy against the integrity of the country.
</p>
<p>It was this that, within six weeks, called forth, as if by magic,
</p>
<p>an army of 200 000 men converting our cities into camaps and making
</p>
<p>I he repression of this rebellion the one great business of the
</p>
<p>American people.
</p>
<p>The scene has been one which, day by day, has thrdled us

<p>with emotion, one upon wliich the Bancroft and the Motley of
</p>
<p>the next century will linger with admiration.

<p>Massachussetts first in the field, as in the olden days of trial,
</p>
<p>shedding the first blood at Baltimore, first to occupy and protect
</p>
<p>the capital, where her great senator was stricken down, against
</p>
<p>the traitors, whose hatred to him foreshadowed their hatred to-
</p>
<p>wards the American constitution, of which he had been the faith-
</p>
<p>ful and eloquent expounder.

<p>New York, " herself the noblest eulogium on the union," fol-
</p>
<p>lowing close behind with her gallant Seventh, reaching Washing-
</p>
<p>ton by a march already famous, and insuring by their presence
</p>
<p>the safety of the Capital. The New England states, Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania and the great west, pouring in their quotas with generous
</p>
<p>rivalry, and our foreign population rising instantly to the gran-
</p>
<p>deur of the occasion, and hastening to the defence of their
</p>
<p>adopted country, present features of strength in the American
</p>
<p>republic of which the most ardent of its eulogists had liardly
</p>
<p>dreamed.

</p>
<p>versities, and graduates of the military schools of Europe who
</p>

<p>a whirlwind over the land. Call the roll of nationalities and you
</p>
<p>will have responses from England and Ireland,, Scotland and
</p>
<p>Wales, from natives of catholic France and protestant Germany
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p> you will have replies from Poles who yet dream of an inde-
</p>
<p>pendent Poland, from Hungarians in wliose ears still lingers the
</p>
<p>eloquence of Kossuth, from Italians rejoicing in a regenerated
</p>
<p>Italy, and who are fresh from executing the policy of the lamented
</p>
<p>Cavour and from fighting by the side of Garibaldi. Every peo,
</p>
<p>pie of Christendom has its representatives in the army of the
</p>
<p>union that has gone forth to fight for national unity, national in-
</p>
<p>dependence and the rights of human nature, against the confede-
</p>
<p>rated forces of slavery and treason.
</p>
<p>In this crisis of our national history it is natural that we should
</p>
<p>regard with interest the view taken of our course by the great
</p>
<p>powers of Europe, and especially by that country, with which,
</p>
<p>as colonies, we were so long connected, and which, despite the
</p>
<p>two wars that have been waged between us, we are accustomed
</p>
<p>to remember as our mother-land. Mingled with our Dutch and
</p>
<p>Huguenot ancestry, a very large proportion of the older families
</p>
<p>of America trace their descent from England, and many who do
</p>
<p>not are yet connected with her by no common ties. For myself,
</p>
<p>I may say that I have always entertained for her people an
</p>
<p>hereditary feeling of attachment, from the fact that my Huguenot
</p>
<p>ancestors, when they fled from Rochelle after the revocation by
</p>
<p>Louis XIV. of the edict of Nantz, found upon her soil a wel-
</p>
<p>come and a home : and that one of them volunteering for King
</p>
<p>William against James II., shed his blood for English freedom at
</p>
<p>the battle of the Boyne, that great era in English history, ending,
</p>
<p>as we hope forever her civil wars, from which dates the estab-
</p>
<p>lishment on a firm basis, of the unity, the strength and the world-
</p>
<p>wide dominion of the British empire. Such memories, and
</p>
<p>doubtless, my countrymen, you have many such, descend from
</p>
<p>father to son undimmed by national revolutions. They inspire
</p>
<p>sentiments of affection and kinship, that like family heir-looms
</p>
<p>gather new value from the lapse of time, and instead of fading
</p>
<p>as years and centuries roll by, seem the more sacred and im-
</p>
<p>perishable from the thought of the generations by whom they

<p>have been cherished and who have each in turn added a link
</p>
<p>to the chain of association.
</p>
<p>The recent visit of the prince of Wales, coming to us as the
</p>
<p>representative of the British nation, characterized, as it was, by
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>the most graceful courtesy and cordiality on his part, and by the
</p>
<p>heartiest welcome upon ours, with the single exception of the
</p>
<p>rude treatment he met at Richmond  now the head-quarters of
</p>
<p>the rebels  had accomplished what no diplomacy could have
</p>
<p>eifected. It seemed to have blotted out the last lingering rem-
</p>
<p>nrait of ill-feeling, and left on this side the Atlantic at least, the
</p>
<p>belief that henceforth there was a firm alliance between Eng-
</p>
<p>land and America, not based on treaty stipulations, but upon that
</p>
<p>heartfelt cordiality which springs from mutual regard, and from
</p>
<p>a common devotion to the great principles of right which belong
</p>
<p>to the institutions of both countries and which their example is
</p>
<p>recommending to the world ; nor should we overlook the belief
</p>
<p>cherished by many thoughtful men that if in the distant future
</p>
<p>England should be set upon by the despotisms of Europe, and
</p>
<p>should require the aid of her American daughter to save her
</p>
<p>froiu annihihition, that aid would be promptly, effectively and
</p>
<p>cordially given.
</p>
<p>It is with profound regret that we hav^e seen that friendly feel-
</p>
<p>ing suddenly converted into one of intense and bitter disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment by the conduct and tone of the English government and
</p>
<p>the ill-judged comments of the English press.
</p>
<p>The election of Mr. Lincoln for the first time entitled to the
</p>
<p>control of the federal government, a party with whose political
</p>
<p>principles the English people were supposed to sympathize. By
</p>
<p>a scheme of treachery unparalleled in baseness, a few of the
</p>
<p>defeated faction holding office in the cabinet, in congress, in the
</p>
<p>army and in the navy, conspire together to betray the forts
</p>
<p>arsenals and other property of the government into the hands of
</p>
<p>their confederates, with the view of destroying the union, and
</p>
<p>erecting upon its ruins a Southern confederacy, of which slavery
</p>
<p>is to be the grand permanent and distinguishing characteristic.
</p>
<p>They accomplish the seizure of the public property without dif-
</p>
<p>ficulty, for they themselves were entrusted with its guardianship,
</p>
<p>and they proceed to develop the great conspiracy and organize

<p>the rebel government, while the loyal citizens of the United
</p>
<p>States are helplessly compelled to await the inauguration of the
</p>
<p>new president. The 4th of March arrives at last, Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>takes the oath to maintain the constitution and the laws, and
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>when in obedience to that oath he orders the rebels to dispers(
</p>
<p>and calls upon the country for assistance, the loyal states, as on
</p>
<p>man, prepare to crush the conspiracy and restore the integrity an
</p>
<p>the honor of the nation. Neither from England nor from an
</p>
<p>foreign power have we asked or would we accept assistance i
</p>
<p>regulating our own household, but from England, of all the statt
</p>
<p>of the world, we thought we had a right to expect a ready syn
</p>
<p>pathy, and that moral support which is given by the countenanc
</p>
<p>of a great nation.
</p>
<p>The Southern rebels also counted upon the support of Englanc
</p>
<p>on the simple ground that her interest in cotton would inclin
</p>
<p>her to their side, but we, although well aware of the demoralizin
</p>
<p>effect of interest uj^on national principles, still believed it in
</p>
<p>possible that the British government could consent from pecun
</p>
<p>ary motives to look with complacency on the progress of a rebe
</p>
<p>lion whose only strength was gained by treachery, and whic
</p>
<p>was avowedly prosecuted for the maintenance of a system whic
</p>
<p>England herself had taught the world to regard with abhorrenct
</p>
<p>In thus believing, we were confirmed by the tone of the Englis
</p>
<p>press when the insurrection first began, one of the ablest repr(
</p>
<p>sentatives of which indignantly declared in substance that Mai
</p>
<p>Chester and Birmingham would be the first to reject as an insul
</p>
<p>the idea that they were to be moved from their position by pi
</p>
<p>cuniary appeals, and that it any British cabinet should sacrific
</p>
<p>the anti-slavery principles of the nation to the question of co
</p>
<p>ton, England would lose, and deservedly lose, her place at th
</p>
<p>council table of Europe.
</p>
<p>The exclamation of Lord John Russell in reply to a questio
</p>
<p>as to the position of England, " For God's sake let us keep or
</p>

<p>gerents."
</p>
<p>The British government is accustomed to preserve an attitud
</p>
<p>of neutrality towards contending nations, but it would seem the
</p>
<p>neutrality does not so far interfere with the sympathies and frc(
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>flom of its subjects as to comjDel it to issue proclamations against
</p>
<p>Irishmen enlisting with Francis Joseph, or Englishmen fighting
</p>
<p>for Victor Emanuel and Garibaldi.
</p>
<p>The proclamation in this case is so warmly eulogized by the
</p>
<p>British press as precisely the proclamation demanded by the
</p>
<p>crisis, they profess such profound astonishment that the
</p>
<p>American people are not satisfied with it, and rate so severely
</p>
<p>Mr. Cassius M. Clay for expressing with western, bluntness his
</p>
<p>frank surprise, that I will dwell for a moment on what seems to
</p>
<p>be its meaning and effect.
</p>
<p>What has the proclamation effected ? How did we stand be-
</p>
<p>fore it was issued, and how do we stand now ?
</p>
<p>In the case of the United States, the laws of England and its
</p>
<p>treaty stipulations with our government already forbade its sub-
</p>
<p>jects from engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow our institu-
</p>
<p>tions. The proclamation, therefore, in forbidding English sub-
</p>
<p>jects to fight in the service of the rebels against the United
</p>
<p>States, simply declared the law as it was already understood ;
</p>
<p>while in forbidding Englishmen to fight for the United States
</p>
<p>against the rebels, it intervened to change the existing practice,
</p>
<p>to revive the almost obsolete act of Geo. III. forbidding Eng-
</p>
<p>lish subjects from engaging in foreign service without the royal
</p>
<p>consent, which had slumbered in regard to Austria and Italy, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of forbidding Englishmen from assisting to main-
</p>
<p>tain in the United States constitutional order against conspira-
</p>
<p>cy and rebellion, and the cause of freedom against chattel slavery.
</p>
<p>The first effect of the proclamation, therefore, was to change
</p>
<p>the position in which England and Englishmen stood to the Uni-
</p>
<p>ted States, to the disadvantage of the latter. Before the procla-
</p>
<p>mation, for an Englishman to serve the United States govern-
</p>
<p>ment in maintaining its integrity was regarded honourable ; after
</p>
<p>the proclamation such service became a crime. The proclam-a-
</p>
<p>tion makes it an offence now for an Englishman to fight for the
</p>
<p>government at Washington as great as it was for Englishmen

</p>
<p>before the proclamation to fight for the rebels of Montgomery.
</p>
<p>It thus, in a moral view, lowered the American government to
</p>
<p>the level of the rebel confederacy, and in the next place, it pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded, in an international view, to place the rebel confederacy
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>on a par with the American government by recognizing them,
</p>
<p>not as rebels and insurgents to be dealt with by our government
</p>
<p>as our constitution and laws should determine, but as a belligerent
</p>
<p>power, to be classed with the United States (of which they were
</p>
<p>but a rebellious fraction), and equally entitled with the United
</p>
<p>States to the rights of belligerents under the law of nations.
</p>
<p>No ingenuity can blind us to the^e facts :  Before the procla-
</p>
<p>mation, to support our government was an honorable ojffice for
</p>
<p>the subjects of Great Britain, and the rebels were insurgents
</p>
<p>with no rights save under the American constitution. After the
</p>
<p>proclamation for an Englishman to serve the United States is a
</p>
<p>crime and the rebels are elevated into a belligerent power  and
</p>
<p>this intervention of England, depriving us of a support which her
</p>
<p>practice permitted, and giving the rebels a status and right they
</p>
<p>did not possess, we are coolly told is neutrality. Dr. Johnson in
</p>
<p>his famous letter gave us a sketch of a Chesterfieldean patron
</p>
<p>seeing a rnan struggling for life in the water, and when he reach-
</p>
<p>ed ground encumbering him with help. Lord John has taught
</p>
<p>us the meaning of British neutrality towards a nation supposed
</p>
<p>to be in like condition. Let us trust that the English people
</p>
<p>will not endorse the defiuition.
</p>
<p>What would England have said to such a proclamation of neu-
</p>
<p>trality from us in her domestic troubles in Canada, in Ireland or
</p>
<p>in India ? What would the English people have thought of a
</p>
<p>state paper from Washington, declaring it the sovereign will of
</p>
<p>the people of the United States to remain perfectly neutral in
</p>
<p>the contest being waged in Hindostan between the British gov-
</p>
<p>ernment on the one side and the Mogul dynasty on the other, and
</p>
<p>forbidding American citizens to enter the service of either of
</p>
<p>the said belligerents. What would they have thought of the
</p>
<p>American president intimating with cold etiquette that it was a
</p>
<p>matter of profound indifference to this government which of the
</p>
<p>belligerents should be victorious, the king of Oude and Nana
</p>
<p>Sahib, or Lord Canning and the immortal Havelock. Or is it

<p>that the British have become so enamored of rebellion, aye and
</p>
<p>of treachery too among their sepoys, that they thus court our
</p>
<p>great mogul and his fellow traitors of Montgomery ?
</p>
<p>This Queen's proclamation strikes not simply at the mcrrJ
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>position of our government, but according to the English press
</p>
<p>it strikes also at our right to execute our own laws against piracy ;
</p>
<p>and we are told by the London Times that if we venture to hang
</p>
<p>under these laws, a pirate who is licensed to plunder and mur-
</p>
<p>der by Jefferson Davis's letters of marquo, now endorsed by the
</p>
<p>sovereigns of England and France, it wiil be regarded as an
</p>
<p>outrage by the civilized world ; and this gentle intimation comes
</p>
<p>to us from a nation who are hardly recovered from the effects of
</p>
<p>a rebellion, to end which, without staying to ask the opinion
</p>
<p>of the world, they blew their rebels from the guns.
</p>
<p>It was intimated that the British cabinet were puzzled how to
</p>
<p>act in regard to the United States on the one hand, and her rebel
</p>
<p>conspirators on the other, and that after a careful search for pre-
</p>
<p>cedents, one was found in the royal proclamation touching the
</p>
<p>war between G-reece and Turkey, and that on that was based the
</p>
<p>proclamation which has so displeased and wounded the American
</p>
<p>people.
</p>
<p>It could not have escaped the cabinet in their search for pre-
</p>
<p>cedents, for we know with what tlioroughness such searches are
</p>
<p>mnde, that a very similar state of things existed but a few j^ears
</p>
<p>since between Great Britain and the United States, when the in-
</p>
<p>tegrity and honour of the British empire were assailed by her
</p>
<p>Canadian colonists, and she had occab.on to learn what in the
</p>
<p>oi)inion of the United States constitutes the duties of neutrality
</p>
<p>towards a friendly nation. Unsuccessful rebellions are soon for-
</p>
<p>gotten, and perhaps many Englishmen may be surprised on being
</p>
<p>told that the Canadian rebellion w^as so deeply seated and so
</p>
<p>widely spread, as seriously to threaten the crown with the loss
</p>
<p>of the Canadas. Mr. Leader declared in Parliament that all the
</p>
<p>English government could do, would be to subjugate and hold
</p>
<p>the principal cities, leaving the country occupied by rebels. The
</p>
<p>number of British troops under Sir John Colbourne was only
</p>
<p>20,000, while the rebels are said to have had 14,000 at Montreal,
</p>
<p>4000 at Napiersville, and thousands more in arms in different

<p>parts of the Canadas, fierce with indignation at the murder of a
</p>
<p>party of patriots by Indians in the employ of the British govern-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>In November '3Y two battles were fought between the British
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>and the rebels, the one at St. Dennis, and the other at St.Charles,
</p>
<p>which was taken from a force of 3,000 Canadians of whom 200
</p>
<p>were killed and 30 wounded.
</p>
<p>In December Mackenzie, the head rebel, who seems to have
</p>
<p>been the prototype of Davis, organized a provisional government,
</p>
<p>and assuming the right to dispose of " ten millions of acres of
</p>
<p>land, fair and fertile," took possession of Montgomery House near
</p>
<p>Toronto, with a band of insurgents, and sent a demand to Sir
</p>
<p>Francis B. Head to dissolve the provincial parHament, and to
</p>
<p>leave Toronto within fifteen days.
</p>
<p>Then came Lord Gosford's proclamation at Quebec, declaring
</p>
<p>martial law, and denouncing the conspiracy and rebellion, and on
</p>
<p>the 8th of January 1838 came the first proclamation from presi-
</p>
<p>dent Van Buren. After reciting the efforts made by him and by
</p>
<p>the governors of New York and Vermont to prevent any unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful interference on the part of our citizens in the contest unfortun-
</p>
<p>ately commenced in the British provinces, and that notwithstand -
</p>
<p>ing the presence of the civil officers of the United States who by
</p>
<p>his direction had visited the scenes of commotion, arms and amu-
</p>
<p>nition had been procured by the insurgents, in the United States,
</p>
<p>the proclamation proceeded :
</p>
<p>" Now, therefore, to the end that the authority of the laws may
</p>
<p>be maintained and the faith of treaties observed, I, Martin Van
</p>
<p>Buren, do most earnestly exhort all citizens of the United States
</p>
<p>who have violated their duties to ret'urn peaceably to their re-
</p>
<p>spective homes, and I hereby warn them that any persons loho
</p>
<p>shall compromise the neutrality of this government by interfering in
</p>
<p>an unlaioful manner with the affairs of the neighboring British
</p>
<p>provinces will render themselves liable to arrest and punishment
</p>
<p>under the laws of the United States," &c., &c.
</p>
<p>At the request of Lord Durham, Mr. Van Buren, had directed
</p>
<p>our commanding officer on Lake Ontario to co-operate in any
</p>
<p>measures which might be suggested by Lord Durham for rooting
</p>
<p>out the band of pirates who had their quarters among " the

<p>thousand isles," without the slightest regard to the official pro-
</p>
<p>clamation of their chief, Mr. William Johnson, holding a commis-
</p>
<p>sion from the patriot government, that the patriots would care-
</p>
<p>fully respect neutral waters and the rights of all citizens of the
</p>
<p>United States.
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>On the 21st November, 1838, president Van Buren issued a
</p>
<p>second proclamation, calling upon the misguided and deluded
</p>
<p>persons to abandon projects dangerous to their own country,
</p>
<p>fatal to those whom they profess a desire to relieve, impractica-
</p>
<p>ble of execution without foreign aid, which they cannot rationally
</p>
<p>expect to obtain, and giving rise to imputations, however un-
</p>
<p>founded, against the honor and good faith of their own govern-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>The proclamation further called upon " every officer, civil and
</p>
<p>military, and upon every citizen, by the veneration due by all
</p>
<p>freemen to the laws which they have assisted to enact for their
</p>
<p>own government, by his regard for the honour and good faith of
</p>
<p>his country, by his love of honour and respect for that sacred code
</p>
<p>of laws by which national intercourse is regulated, to use every
</p>
<p>power to arrest for trial and punishment every offender against
</p>
<p>the laws providing for the performance of our obhgations to the
</p>
<p>other powers of the world."
</p>
<p>On the 4th of December, 1838, the president, in his message to
</p>
<p>congress, declared, " If an insurrection existed in Canada the
</p>
<p>amicable disposition of the United States, as well as their duty to
</p>
<p>themselves, would lead them to maintain a strict neutrality, and
</p>
<p>to restrain its citizens from all violation of the laws which have
</p>
<p>been passed for its enforcement. But the government recognises
</p>
<p>a still higher obligation to repress all attempts on the part of its
</p>
<p>citizens to disturb the peace of a country where order prevails
</p>
<p>or has been re-established."
</p>
<p>Such was the neutrality on the part of the United States
</p>
<p>towards Great Britain. It recognized the rebels of Canada
</p>
<p>not as belligerents, but as insurgents, and it enforced its neu-
</p>
<p>trality not by forbidding its citizens to assist Great Britain to
</p>
<p>maintain its authority against the insurgents, but by forbidding
</p>
<p>them to interfere in an unlaiuful manner with the affairs of the
</p>
<p>provinces.

<p>of Grotius, or Puffendorf, or Vattel, or Wheaton, no definitions
</p>
<p>of the rights of belligerents and privateers from the Consolato
</p>
<p>del Mare, from Lampredi, Gahani, Moser or Hiibner, to enable us
</p>
<p>to appreciate the Avide difference between the neutrality wo
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>practiced towards England and lier rebels, and that whicli Eng-
</p>
<p>land lias inaugurated against us ; and no refinement of reason-
</p>
<p>ing, nor subtle glosses indulged in by the English press, have
</p>
<p>at all blinded the American people to the unfriendly character
</p>
<p>of this royal proclamation.
</p>
<p>The recognition of the independence of the southern confed-
</p>
<p>eracy is a matter in the discretion of England, and of all foreign
</p>
<p>nations. When this independence is established as a matter of
</p>
<p>fact we expect it to be recognized, but England does not so re-
</p>
<p>cognize it. She recognizes the confederacy as simply struggling
</p>
<p>for independence as were the insurgents in Canada, and pend-
</p>
<p>ing the struggle she volunteers, under professions of neutrality
</p>
<p>to ignore our constitutional right to subdue them, and to recog-
</p>
<p>nize their rebellion as lawful war. Bound to us by treaty
</p>
<p>stipulations, she elevates them to an equality of position as
</p>
<p>regards belligerent rights under the law of nations. She
</p>
<p>places their usurped government, based on treachery and slave-
</p>
<p>ry, on a par with that founded by Washington and his associ-
</p>
<p>ates on the broad consent of the American people. She intro-
</p>
<p>duces Jefferson Davis and his confederates to a limited extent
</p>
<p>into the family of nations, endorses the licenses given by them to
</p>
<p>pirates whose brutal cupidity is stimulated by bribes of blood
</p>
<p>money  twenty dollars for every murdered American ! and
</p>
<p>transforms them into letters of marque which the ships of all na-
</p>
<p>tions are bound to recognize, respect and obey.
</p>
<p>Had she treated them as insurgents they would have had no
</p>
<p>other rights on the sea than had Bill Johnson, the pirate of the
</p>
<p>St. Lawrence. Having proclaimed them belligerents she has
</p>
<p>given them a commission not simply to capture American prop-
</p>
<p>erty in American vessels, but to capture on the high seas Amer-
</p>
<p>ican property on board of whatever vessel it may be found, and
</p>
<p>to carry the neutral vessel and cargo into a belligerent port fo;'
</p>
<p>further examination. She recognizes the right of the men who
</p>
<p>have robbed our treasury, betrayed our forts and filched our

</p>
<p>the lawfulness of captures made by their commissioned cruisers,
</p>
<p>and brought into court for adjudication, and the title to be given

</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>This is what the proclamation of neutrality really means. This is
</p>
<p>the neutrality which England has inaugurated and which France
</p>
<p>has adopted ; and those two great powers who recently declared
</p>
<p>in the congress at Paris that jorivateering is and shall remain
</p>
<p>abolished,  by royal and imperial proclamation have countersign-
</p>
<p>ed letters of marque for the destruction of American ships, and
</p>
<p>which threaten with spoliation the commerce of the world. The
</p>
<p>aim and effect of the British proclamation seems to us so clearly
</p>
<p>unfriendly and injurious, that it is hardly worth while to note
</p>
<p>the discourtesy of adopting such a policy, and giving it a defi-
</p>
<p>nite and irreversible shape in advance of the arrival of Mr. Ad-
</p>
<p>ams, without allowing us the opportunity to offer a word of
</p>
<p>explanation or remonstrance. Mr. Adams reached Liverpool
</p>
<p>the 13th of Ma}". The next day the proclamation was printed
</p>
<p>in London.
</p>
<p>The United States by their neutrality broke the back of the
</p>
<p>Canadian rebellion, dashed the hopes cherished by the rebels ot
</p>
<p>effective American sympathy, in good faith assisted the British
</p>
<p>government in maintaining its autliority, and restoring order,
</p>
<p>and thus materially diminished the cost of treasure and of life at
</p>
<p>wdiich alone their subjection could have been accomplished.
</p>
<p>The British government by their neutrality have made our
</p>
<p>task far more difficult, apart from the injury we may anticipate
</p>
<p>from the fleet of privateers whose letters are so respectably
</p>
<p>countersigned. But we learn from this proclamation one les-
</p>
<p>son, that will be perhaps worth all that it shall cost us : we
</p>
<p>learn the treatment we may expect, if we fail to maintain our na
</p>
<p>tional integrity and the honour of our flag.
</p>
<p>If a mere supposition that the rebels of Montgomery are likel}^
</p>
<p>to be successful, can in a moment dash from the memory of the
</p>
<p>English government all recollection of past friendship, and induce
</p>
<p>her in our moment of trial to condescend to a course so different
</p>
<p>from that we had pursued towards her ; what treatment may
</p>
<p>we not expect from her, and from every other European cabinet,

</p>
<p>if we ourselves by our conduct admit that we are powerless at
</p>
<p>home ? How w^ill we be treated abroad, if we yield to the threats
</p>
<p>of a fraction of our oAvn population ? What will be our standing
</p>
<p>among nations if, consenting to separation, we lose nearly half of
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>our territory, and two-thirds of our Atlantic seaboard, and des-
</p>
<p>cend to the position of a third rate power ? Or what respect will
</p>
<p>be paid us, if to maintain our territory we compromise with rebeh
</p>
<p>lion ; if we yield at the cannon's mouth, what the people have
</p>
<p>deliberately refused at the polls , if we teach the world by such
</p>
<p>an example that we may be bullied with success, and that when
</p>
<p>we resist on principle unreasonable demands, it is only necessary
</p>
<p>to humble our flag, and to threaten Washington, to induce us
</p>
<p>ignominously to submit?
</p>
<p>Let us discard all reliance upon other help than that of God,
</p>
<p>a right cause and a strong arm, and let us recognize the stub
</p>
<p>born fact that " the government or nation that fails to protect
</p>
<p>itself against foes, whether foreign or domestic, deserves to perislf
</p>
<p>ingloriously."*
</p>
<p>Before leaving the question of England's neutrahty, I think
</p>
<p>we should distinguish between the hasty action of the British
</p>
<p>cabinet and the deliberate conviction of the British people.
</p>
<p>That the heart of that great nation is sound, and that as soon
</p>
<p>as they understand the motives and manner of this rebellion as
</p>
<p>you understand them, they will appreciate our position, approve
</p>
<p>our resolution and wish us God speed in our great work of res-
</p>
<p>toring the federal union to its integrity and its great original
</p>
<p>principles of freedom, I cannot, I will not doubt.
</p>
<p>Already their cabinet has partially atoned for the first pro-
</p>
<p>clamation by an order that will prevent the privateers of Davis
</p>
<p>from entering British ports, and both the government and the
</p>
<p>people must soon recognise the fact that we have the ability and
</p>
<p>the will to crush this rebellion and maintain our integrity, how-
</p>
<p>ever long the struggle, however great the cost ; and that we no
</p>
<p>more recognise the right of England nor of Europe to dictate to
</p>
<p>us in this matter, than England would have recognized our right
</p>
<p>to interfere between her and Nana Sahib. The material interests
</p>
<p>based on cotton must yield to the national and moral duties that
</p>
<p>to-day devolve upon the American people, in determining, per-

</p>
<p>The EngUsh people will see that our resolve to crush the con-
</p>
<p>* Guetauo Filangieri.
</p>
<p>44
</p>
<p>spiracy for the establishment of a slave empire, is not based on
</p>
<p>any evanescent burst of enthusiasm, but on the most sober calcu-
</p>
<p>lations of honor, duty, bale ty and economy ; and that it is the true
</p>
<p>interest of England, her pecuniary, her political and her moral
</p>
<p>interest, that the war should be as brief as possible, that the re-
</p>
<p>bels may no longer be deluded into the belief that any true Eng-
</p>
<p>lishman who understands the history and the object of tueir rebel-
</p>
<p>lion can regard it with other feelings, than those naturally aroused
</p>
<p>by a policy of fraud, treachery and oppression.
</p>
<p>That the restoration of the integrity of our union is to be ac-
</p>
<p>complished without a vast expenditure of treasure, and perhaps
</p>
<p>of blood, no one anticipates. We all know something of the cost

<p>of European wars, but we know also our own resources and the
</p>
<p>immense stake for which we will be fighting. Our fathers fought
</p>
<p>for seven years for our national freedom, and the spirit abroad
</p>
<p>throughout our land indicates that their sons, if necessary, will
</p>
<p>fight seven years more to save it from destruction and disgrace.
</p>
<p>Whether the debt incurred for its preservation shall be hun-
</p>
<p>dreds or thousands of millions, it will be a sacred legacy to future
</p>
<p>generations. A debt of five hundred millions, as remarked by
</p>
<p>an English journalist, would leave this nation less severely taxed
</p>
<p>than any nation of Europe.
</p>
<p>If any man supposes that this republic can be advantageously
</p>
<p>sundered into two, let him cast his eye upon the map and endea-
</p>
<p>vour to find a natural line to separate the two confederacies.
</p>
<p>The geographical formation of our country indicates that it is
</p>
<p>one : nature has provided no boundary line between the North
</p>
<p>and the South : no river like the Mississippi, no mountain chain
</p>
<p>like the Alleghanies, or the Rocky mountains, running from the
</p>
<p>West to the Atlantic, and forming an Alpine boundary to divide
</p>
<p>vhe sections. On the contrary, the father of waters stretches out
</p>
<p>his great arms to the East and to the West bearing on his bosom
</p>
<p>to the gulf, the generous products of the valleys which they fer-
</p>
<p>tilize, and carrying back in their place the cotton, rice and sugar

<p>of our Southern borders, and imports from foreign climes.
</p>
<p>The Mississippi, source and channel of prosperity to North and
</p>
<p>South alike in every mile of its progress : on the West to Mmuo-
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>sota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana ; on the East to
</p>
<p>Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, pro-
</p>
<p>clnims to the citizens of the immense region which it waters
</p>
<p>through thousands of miles in extent, from North to South,
</p>
<p>and East to West, that our country is one and indivisible.
</p>
<p>Our duty to the South forbids our acquiescence in this rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, for it would reverse the American policy for the last half
</p>
<p>century, and reconsign to foreign invasion, to anarchy and ruin,
</p>
<p>the immense territories which we have rescued from European
</p>
<p>sway, and united as parts of our great nation.
</p>
<p>Look back to the olden time and see what the Southern coun-
</p>
<p>try would again become. Trace the history of Florida from the
</p>
<p>days of Charles V., from the adventures of De Leon and DeSoto,
</p>
<p>the persecution of protestants from France, and the retaliation
</p>
<p>on the murderous Spaniards ; the capture of St. Augustine by Sir
</p>
<p>Francis Drake, the buccaneering inroads of the English, the
</p>
<p>transfer of Florida to the British crown ; its partial settlement
</p>
<p>from Italy and Greece, the privateering exploits in our revolu-
</p>
<p>tion, the capture of Baton Rouge and Pensacola, until its pur-
</p>
<p>chase by our government in 1819.
</p>
<p>Remember that the Spaniards navigated the gulf of Mexico
</p>
<p>for two centuries, without discovering that it was the outlet of
</p>
<p>the great river of the North, a fact which perhaps induces the
</p>
<p>Southern confederates to imagine that we also may be persuaded
</p>
<p>to forget its existence. Look at Louisiana from the days of Law
</p>
<p>and the Mississippi bubble to its cession to Spain in 1762, and its
</p>
<p>retrocession to France in 1800, when we hastened to buy it from
</p>
<p>the First Consul, and you will find nothing in Florida, in Louisiana,
</p>
<p>nor indeed in Texas, to indicate even the first beginning of the
</p>
<p>prosperity which has been so rapidly developed under the foster-
</p>
<p>ing protection of the federal government.
</p>
<p>Let the American union be dismembered, and what is to pre-
</p>
<p>vent foreign powers from re-entering upon our national domain
</p>
<p>from which at such great cost and labour they have been ousted '.'

<p>An old officer of the French empire writing to the Courrier des
</p>
<p>Etats-Unis, has predicted that in the first place France would
</p>
<p>retake Louisiana, according to ancient treaties, that Spain would
</p>
<p>reclaim Florida, that England perhaps would seek to appropriate
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>Oregon, and that Mexico, under foreign protection, would retake
</p>
<p>New Mexico, Texas and California ; or supposing that we should
</p>
<p>consent to tl:c establishment of the so-called Southern confederacy,
</p>
<p>which we know to bo a mere military despotism, what possible gua-
</p>
<p>rantee can we have for peace in. the future, when each state re-
</p>
<p>serves the right to secede at pleasure and enter at will into foreign
</p>
<p>alliances, inaugurating universal chiios and chronic dissolution!
</p>
<p>Even now, M-hile the struggle is being waged, the leading men of
</p>
<p>South Carolina, already sick of tbeii independence before it is ac-
</p>
<p>complished, repudiate republican institutions and sigh for a British
</p>
<p>prince to lend the odour of royalty to the aristocracy which they
</p>
<p>boast  an aristocracy based not upon historic deeds and noble
</p>
<p>heroism, but simply upon the colour of their skins, and their des-
</p>
<p>potic dominion over helpless slaves :  an aristocracy whose wealth
</p>
<p>is invested in human flesh, and whose revenues are col
</p>
<p>lected in the field by the lash, and on the auction block by the
</p>
<p>hammer !
</p>
<p>Let our union be divided with the view of accomplishing pre-
</p>
<p>sent peace, and not only would the United States fall from her
</p>
<p>position of a first class power to that of a minor republic, with
</p>
<p>a contracted sea-board and a defenseless border but the act
</p>
<p>of separation would inaugurate an exposure to hostilities,  first
</p>
<p>from our new and unfriendly neighbour, and then from every
</p>
<p>foreign power with which one or all of the Southern states might
</p>
<p>choose to form an alliance. Either contingency Avould necessarily
</p>
<p>change our national policv, require the maintenance of a standing
</p>
<p>army, and complicate endlessly our commercial relations. Noio,
</p>
<p>we stand aloof from the quarrels of the rest of the world and can
</p>
<p>devote our energies to the development of our marvellous re.
</p>
<p>sources and the extension of civilization and freedom over the
</p>
<p>American continent ; tlien we should be compelled to an attitude
</p>
<p>of perpetual self-defence to save us from constant entanglement
</p>
<p>in the web of European politics. Already have we had a fore-
</p>
<p>taste of the sort of treatment which Europe will accord to the

</p>
<p>severed fragments of the American republic.
</p>
<p>To maintain the respect of the world we must maintain first
</p>
<p>the integrity of our national territory, and next the integrity of
</p>
<p>our fundamental principles. As for the argument that if the re-
</p>
<p>4T
</p>
<p>bellion is crushed harmony can never be restored, Canada fur-
</p>
<p>nishes the refutation. The bloody feuds of 1838 have hardly left
</p>
<p>a trace to mar the tranquil prosperity which marks the progress
</p>
<p>of that great province. There is reason to believe that the union
</p>
<p>men of the South await but the coming of the federal torces in
</p>
<p>sufficient stength, to show themselves again the cordial supporters
</p>
<p>of the federal government. But even if this were not so, and there
</p>
<p>was reason to fear a long period of distrust and disaffection, the
</p>
<p>fact remains that the interests of the American people impera-
</p>
<p>tively demand that the integrity of the union shall be preserved,
</p>
<p>whether the slavery propagandists of the South like it or like
</p>
<p>it not.
</p>
<p>This is one of those decisive epochs that occur in the history
</p>
<p>of all great nations. One came to our fathers in 1776. Submis-
</p>
<p>sion to usurped authority, or national independence, was the issue :
</p>
<p>and on the day we commemorate they chose the latter ; and the
</p>
<p>force of their example on the world is yet to be determined.
</p>
<p>To day the imperious demand comes from slavery, " submit or be
</p>
<p>destroyed !" Already has a blow been struck by slavery at our
</p>
<p>republic, the force of which reverberates through the world.
</p>
<p>Two hundred millions of debts due from rebels to loyal citizens
</p>
<p>are repudiated, the business of the country is arrested, bank-
</p>
<p>ruptcy stares us in the face ; worse than all, our flag has been
</p>
<p>insulted, our prestige impaired, and, from foreign courts, we have
</p>
<p>received treatment that our American pride can illy brook.
</p>
<p>Honour, interest, self-respect and the highest duty call upon us
</p>
<p>to crush, and crush speedily, the insolent traitors whose secret
</p>
<p>and atrocious perfidy has temporarily crippled us : and while
</p>
<p>we recall the motives that combine to compel us to resist-
</p>
<p>ance, let us not forget the duty which this nation owes to the op-
</p>
<p>pressed race who are the innocent cause of all our troubles, and
</p>
<p>who have no friends to look to but ourselves, to prevent the
</p>
<p>spreading of slavery over every foot of American territory, and
</p>
<p>the waving of the flag of the slave trader over the fearful horrors

<p>of the middle passage.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, as in our revolutionary struggle our fathers had to
</p>
<p>contend with the timid and the avaricious, who feared the evils
</p>
<p>of war and continually cried peace I peace ! where there was no
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>peace, so may Tve expect to be constantly hampered by declaim-
</p>
<p>crs in favor of compromise. I do not stop to consider the fitness
</p>
<p>of our lending an ear to such a cry until the insult to our flag lias
</p>
<p>been atoned for and until our supremacy is acknowledged, for
</p>
<p>the great mass of the people of the country will be unanimous
</p>
<p>on this point ; they will regard the bare suggestion of treating
</p>
<p>with the rebels whose hands are stained with the blood of the
</p>
<p>sons of Massachusetts, of Ellsworth and of Winthrop, of Greble
</p>
<p>and of Ward, as a personal insult, and will rejily to it as did
</p>
<p>Patrick Henry  "We must fight ! I repeat it, sir, we must fight !"
</p>
<p>The sword is now the only pen with which we can Avrite " peace"
</p>
<p>in enduring characters on the map of America.
</p>
<p>The day of compromise is gone : " that sort of thing," as the
</p>
<p>secretary said, " ended with the fourth of March." We have had
</p>
<p>devices enough for saving the union, devices suggested by the
</p>
<p>men who are now striving to destroy it.
</p>
<p>There is one good old plan provided by the constitution that
</p>
<p>was successfully practiced by Washington and Jackson : we are
</p>
<p>about to try tliat : lot us try it thoroughly ; it is simply the due
</p>
<p>execution of the laws by whatever degree of force the exigency
</p>
<p>may require. If our army of 300,000 men is insufficient, a
</p>
<p>million stand ready to follow them to the field.
</p>
<p>It would be difficult, my countrymen, to exaggerate the solemn
</p>
<p>importance of our national position. A struggle for life and
</p>
<p>death has commenced between freedom and slavery, and on tlie
</p>
<p>event of the struggle depends our national existence. Let us
</p>
<p>falter, let us compromise, let us yield, and the work of our fa-
</p>
<p>thers and the inheritance of our children, our own honor and the
</p>
<p>hopes of the oppressed nationalities of the world will be buried
</p>
<p>in a common grave ! Let us be demoralized by defeat in the
</p>
<p>field, or what is infinitely worse, by submission to rebellion, and
</p>
<p>in foreign laruls ji man will blush and hang his head to declare
</p>
<p>himself an American citizen. A whipped hound should be the
</p>
<p>emblem of the Northern man Avho whimpers for a peace that can

</p>
<p>only be gained by dishonour.
</p>
<p>But let us remember our fathers who, eighty-five years ago, this
</p>
<p>day, made universal freedom and equal right the corner stone of
</p>
<p>this republic ; let us exhibit, as we have begun to do, their stern
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>resolve and high devotion in behalf of constitutional freedom,
</p>
<p>and we shall secure for our children and our children's children
</p>
<p>a gigantic and glorious nationality, based upon principles of
</p>
<p>Christian civilization, such as the world has never seen before.
</p>
<p>There is nothing impossible, nothing improbable in our speedy
</p>
<p>realization of a glorious future.
</p>
<p>The seeds of this rebellion have long lurked in our system : for
</p>
<p>years it has been coming to a head, and simply from want of
</p>
<p>proper treatment, it has now burst with angry violence : but the
</p>
<p>pulse of the nation beats cooly and calmly, the partial local in-
</p>
<p>flammation but serves to exhibit the lusty health of the body
</p>
<p>politic, and wheii this rebellion is extinguished, and i-ts cause re-
</p>
<p>moved, we may hope that we are safe from an organized rebel-
</p>
<p>lion for at least a century to come.
</p>
<p>With what speed this rebellion shall be crushed, depends sole-
</p>
<p>ly upon yourselves. Let public feeling lag throughout the land,
</p>
<p>and the war department will lag in Washington. Let us become
</p>
<p>careless and indifferent about the matter, and contractors will
</p>
<p>cheat our soldiers, incompetent officers will expose them to de-
</p>
<p>feat, official indifference will produce general demoralization.
</p>
<p>But let us keep ever in mind the lesson we have so dearly learned
</p>
<p> that eternal vigilance is the price of Kberty. Let the administra-
</p>
<p>tion and the army feel that their every act is canvassed by ai
</p>
<p>intelligent people, and when approved, greeted by a hearty ap-
</p>
<p>preciation : that every branch of industry awaits the ending of
</p>
<p>the war, and that from every part of the land comes the cry of
</p>
<p>" forward," and the arm of the union at Washington Avill obey the
</p>
<p>heart of the nation, whenever a prayer rises in its behalf, or its
</p>
<p>flag kisses the breeze of heaven.
</p>
<p>Let us with this sleepless vigilance on our part, repose a gene-
</p>
<p>rous confidence in our president who has won the generous ap-
</p>
<p>plause of his democratic opponents, nor scan too impatiently the
</p>
<p>warlike policy of Scott.
</p>
<p>Like all true-hearted and brave veterans he wishes to spare as

</p>
<p>far as possible the blood alike of loyal soldiers and deluded rebels,
</p>
<p>and to carry with the flag of our union not simply the power to
</p>
<p>make it respected but the more glorious attributes that cause it
</p>
<p>to be loved. "Not," to adopt the words of Gov. Andrew, of
</p>
<p>50
</p>
<p>Massachussetts, " to inaugurate a war of sections, not to avenge
</p>
<p>former wrongs, not to perpetuate ancient griefs or memories of
</p>
<p>conflict," will that flag move onwards until it floats again in its
</p>
<p>pride and beauty over Richmond, and Sumpter,and Montgomery,
</p>
<p>and New Orleans : but to indicate the majesty of the people, to
</p>
<p>retain and re-invigorate the institutions of our fathers, to rescue
</p>
<p>from the despotism of traitors the loyal citizens of the South, and
</p>
<p>place all, loyal or rebel, under the protection of a union that is
</p>
<p>essential to the welfare of the whole.
</p>
<p>The eyes of the whole world are thi^ day fixed upon you. To
</p>
<p>Europeans themselves, European questions sink to insignificance
</p>
<p>compared with the American question now to be decided. Rise,
</p>
<p>my countrymen, as did our fathers on the day we celebrate, to
</p>
<p>the majestic grandeur of this question in its two-fold aspect,
</p>
<p>as regards America, and as regards the world. Remember that
</p>
<p>with the failure of the American republic will fall the wisest
</p>
<p>system of republican govrnment which the wisdom of man
</p>
<p>has yet invented, and the hopes of popular freedom cherished
</p>
<p>throughout the globe.
</p>
<p>Let us, standing by our fathers' graves, swear anew and teach
</p>
<p>the oath to our children, that with God's help the American re-
</p>
<p>public, clasping this continent in its embrace, shall stand un-
</p>
<p>moved, though all the powers of slavery, piracy, and European
</p>
<p>jealousy should combine to overthrow it ; that we shall have in
</p>
<p>the future, as we have had in the past, one country, one consti-
</p>
<p>tution, and one destiny; and that when we shall have passed
</p>
<p>from earth and the acts of to-day shall be matter of history, and
</p>
<p>the dark power now seeking our overthrow shall have been itself
</p>
<p>overthrown, our sons may gather strength from our example in
</p>
<p>every contest with despotism that time may have in store to try
</p>
<p>their virtue, and that they may rally under the stars and stripes
</p>
<p>to battle for fi-eedom and the rights of man, with our olden war
</p>
<p>cry. " Liberty and union, now and forever, one and inseparable."
