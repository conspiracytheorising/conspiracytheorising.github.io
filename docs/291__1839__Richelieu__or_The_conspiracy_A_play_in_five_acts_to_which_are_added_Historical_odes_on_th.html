<p>Hist. Gen.
</p>
<p>PREFACE TO RICHELIEU.
</p>
<p>The administration of Cardinal Richelieu, whom
</p>
<p>(despite all his darker qualities) Voltaire and history
</p>
<p>justly consider the true architect of the French mon-
</p>
<p>archy and the great parent of French civilization, is
</p>
<p>characterized by features alike tragic and comic. A
</p>
<p>weak king, an ambitious favourite ; a despicable con-
</p>
<p>spiracy against the minister, nearly always associated
</p>
<p>with a dangerous treason against the state : these, with
</p>
<p>little variety of names and dates, constitute the event-
</p>
<p>ful cycle through which, with a dazzling ease and an
</p>
<p>arrogant confidence, the great luminary fulfilled its des-
</p>
<p>tinies. Blended together in startling contrast, we see
</p>
<p>the grandest achievements and the pettiest agents ; the
</p>
<p>spy, the mistress, the Capucliin ; the destruction of feu-
</p>
<p>dalism ; the humiliation of Austria ; the dismember-
</p>
<p>ment of Spain.
</p>
<p>Richelieu himself is still what he was in his own day,
</p>
<p>a man of two characters. If, on the one hand, he is
</p>
<p>justly represented as inflexible and vindictive, ci-afty
</p>
<p>and unscrupulous ; so, on the other, it cannot be de-
</p>
<p>nied that he was placed in times in which the long im-
</p>
<p>punity of every license required stern examples ; that
</p>
<p>he was beset by perils and intrigues, which gave a
</p>
<p>certain excuse to the subtlest inventions of self-de-
</p>
<p>fence ; that his ambition was inseparably connected
</p>
<p>with a passionate love for the glory of his country ;
</p>
<p>and that, if he was her dictator, he was not less her
</p>
<p>benefactor. It has been fairly remarked by the most
</p>
<p>impartial historians, that he was no less generous to
</p>
<p>merit than severe to crime ; that, in the various de-
</p>
<p>partments of the state, the army, and the church, he
</p>
<p>selected and distinguished the ablest aspirants ; that

<p>VI PREFACE.
</p>
<p>the wars which he conducted were, for the most part,
</p>
<p>essential to the preservation of France, and Europe it-
</p>
<p>self, from the formidable encroachments of the Austrian
</p>
<p>house ; that, in spite of those wars, the people were
</p>
<p>not oppressed with exorbitant imposts ; and that he left
</p>
<p>the kingdom he had governed in a more flourishing and
</p>
<p>vigorous state than at any former period of the French
</p>
<p>history, or at the decease of Louis XIV.
</p>
<p>The cabals formed against this great statesman
</p>
<p>were not carried on by the patriotism of public virtue
</p>
<p>or the emulation of equal talent : they were but court
</p>
<p>struggles, in which the most worthless agents had re-
</p>
<p>course to the most desperate means. In each, as I
</p>
<p>have before observed, we see the twofold attempt to
</p>
<p>murder the minister and to betray the country. Such,
</p>
<p>then, are the agents, and such the designs, with which
</p>
<p>truth, in the drama as in history, requires us to con-
</p>
<p>trast the celebrated cardinal; not disguising his foibles
</p>
<p>or his vices, but not unjust to the grander qualities
</p>
<p>(especially the love of country) by which they were
</p>
<p>often dignitied, and, at times, redeemed.
</p>
<p>The historical drama is the concentration of histor-
</p>
<p>ical events. In the attempt to place upon the stage the
</p>
<p>picture of an era, that license with dates and details
</p>
<p>which poetry permits, and which the highest author-
</p>
<p>ities in the drama of France herself have sanctioned,
</p>
<p>has been, though not unsparingly, indulged. The con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of the J3uc de Bouillon is, for instance, amalga-
</p>
<p>mated with the denouement of The Day of Dupes;* and
</p>
<p>circumstances connected with the treason of Cinq Mars
</p>
<p>(whose brilliant youth and gloomy catastrophe tend to
</p>
<p>subvert poetic and historic justice, by seducing us to
</p>
<p>forget his base ingratitude and his perfidious apostacy)
</p>
<p>are identified with the fate of the earlier favourite

<p>great importance at that time.
</p>
<p>NOTE.
</p>
<p>The length of the play necessarily requires curtailments on the
</p>
<p>etage, the principal of which are specified (as they occur) in mar-
</p>
<p>ginal notes. Many of the passages thus omitted, however immate-
</p>
<p>rial to the audience, must obviously be such as the reader would be
</p>
<p>least inclined to dispense with, viz., those which, without being ab-
</p>
<p>solutely essential to the business of the stage, contain either the
</p>
<p>subtler strokes of character, or the more poetical embellishments of
</p>
<p>description. A more important consequence of these suppressions is,
</p>
<p>that Richelieu himself is left, too often and too unrehevedly, to po-
</p>
<p>sitions which place him in an amiable light, without that shadowing
</p>
<p>forth of his more sinister motives and his fiercer qualities which is
</p>
<p>attempted in the written play. Thus, the character takes a degree of
</p>
<p>credit due only to the situation. To judge the author's conception of
</p>
<p>Richelieu fairly, and to estimate how far it is consistent with liistori-

<p>SCENE I.
</p>
<p>A room in the house of Marion de Lorme ; a table towards
</p>
<p>the front of the stage {ivith luine, fruits, dfc), at ivhich
</p>
<p>are seated Baradas, four courtiers, sflendidly dressed in
</p>
<p>the costume of 1641-2 ; the Duke of Orleans reclining on
</p>
<p>a large fauteuil ; Marion de Lorme, standing at the hack
</p>
<p>of his chair, offers him a goblet and then retires. At
</p>
<p>another table, De Bcringhen, De Mauprat, playing at
</p>
<p>dice; other courtiers, of inferior rank to those at the
</p>
<p>table of the duke, looking on.
</p>
<p>ORLEANS {drinking).
</p>
<p>Here's to our enterprise !
</p>
<p>BARADAS {glancing at Marion).
</p>
<p>Hush, sir !
</p>
<p>ORLEANS {aside).
</p>
<p>Nay, count,
</p>
<p>You may trust her ; she dotes on me ; no house
</p>
<p>So safe as Marion's.* At our stateher homes
</p>
<p>The very walls do play the eavesdropper.
</p>
<p>There's not a sunbeam creeping o'er our floors
</p>
<p>But seems a glance from that malignant eye
</p>
<p>"Which reigns o'er France ; our fatal greatness lives
</p>
<p>In the sharp glare of one relentless day.

<p>The myrtle hides ; and Marion's silken robe
</p>
<p>Casts its kind charity o'er fiercer sins

<p>Than those which haunt the rosy path between

<p>The lip and eye of beauty. Oh, no house

<p>(Whereto is joined the schedule of our treaty

<p>With the count-duke,* the Richeheu of the Escurial),

<p>Bouillon will join his army with the Spaniard,

<p>March on to Paris, there dethrone the king;
</p>
<p>You will be regent ; I and ye, my lords,
</p>
<p>Form the new council. So much for the core
</p>
<p>Of our great scheme.

<p>ORLEANS.

<p>But Richelieu is an Argus ;
</p>
<p>One of his hundred eyes will light upon us,
</p>
<p>And then  good-by to life.

<p>BARADAS.
</p>
<p>To gain the prize

<p>We must destroy the Argus : ay, my lords,

<p>Yes!

<p>Ambiton and revenge ; in you both blended.
</p>
<p>First for ambition : Julie is his ward ;

<p>Innocent, docile, pliant to his will,

<p>And vengeance by dishonour to his foe !

<p>BARADAS.
</p>
<p>You have the proof, the royal letter :
</p>
<p>Your strange exemption from the general pardon,
</p>
<p>Known but to me and Richelieu ; can you doubt
</p>
<p>Your friend to acquit your foe ? The truth is glaring;

</p>
<p>to Richelieu the bishopric of Lu(;on ; but his military propensities

</p>
<p>tration that occurs the last example of proclaiming war by the chiv-
</p>
<p>alric defiance of herald and cartel. Richelieu valued himself much
</p>
<p>on his personal activity, for his vanity was as universal as his ambi-
</p>
<p>tion. A nobleman of the house of Grammont one day found him
</p>
<p>employed in jumping, and, with all the savoir vivre of a Frenchman
</p>
<p>and a courtier, oft'ered to jump against him. He suffered the cardi-
</p>
<p>nal to jump higher, and soon after found himself rewarded by an ap-
</p>
<p>pointment. Yet, strangely enough, this vanity did not lead to a pat-
</p>
<p>ronage injurious to the state ; fur never before in France was ability
</p>
<p>made so essential a requisite in promotion. He was lucky in finding

<p>the cleverest fellows among his adroitest flatterers.

<p>into the administration, he therefore laid it down as a maxim neces-

<p>sary to the existence of the state, that " no crime should be com-

<p>Montmorcnci or Cinq Mars, were traitors in actual conspiracy against

<p>their country, and would have forfeited life in any land where the

<p>punishment of death existed, and the lawgiver was strong enough to

<p>consideration was, " what will be best for the country ?" He had no

</p>
<p>treaty of alliance and subsidies with the Catalan rebels for the estab-
</p>
<p>lishment of a republic in Barcelona ; to convulse other monarchies
</p>
<p>was to consolidate the growing monarchy of France. So he who

<p>the most essential aid to the Protestants abroad. There was, in-
</p>
<p>deed, a largeness of view in his hostility to French Huguenots,
</p>
<p>which must be carefully distinguished from the intolerance of the
</p>
<p>mere priest. He opposed them, not as a Catholic, but as a statesman.
</p>
<p>The Huguenots were strong republicans, and had formed plans for
</p>
<p>dividing France into provincial commonwealihs ; and the existence of
</p>
<p>Rochelie was absolutely incompatible with the integrity of the
</p>
<p>French monarchy. It was a second capital held by tlie Huguenots,
</p>
<p>claiming independent authority and the right to treat with foreign
</p>
<p>powers. Richelieu's final conquest was marked by a humanity that
</p>
<p>had nothing of the bigot. The Huguenots obtained a complete am-
</p>
<p>nesty, and had only to regret the loss of privileges and fortifications
</p>
<p>which could not have existed with any security to the rest of France.

<p>* Joseph's ambition was not, however, so moderate ; he refused a

<p>bishopric, and desired the cardinal's hat, for which favour Richelieu

<p>openly supplicated the Holy See, but contrived somehow or other

<p>never to effect it, although two ambassadors applied for it at Rome.

<p>t The peculiar religion of P^re Joseph may be illustrated by the

<p>following anecdote : An officer, whom he had dismissed upon an ex-
</p>
<p>pedition into Germany, moved by conscience at the orders he had re-
</p>
<p>ceived, returned for farther explanations, and found the Capuchin di-

<p>these people defend themselves" " KUi all" (Qu'on tue tout), an-
</p>
<p>swered the g^ood father, coatinmng his devotions.

<p>night :
</p>
<p>Trembling, I left my chamber, sought the queen,
</p>
<p>Fell at her feet, reveal'd the unholy peril,
</p>
<p>Implored her aid to flee our joint disgrace.
</p>
<p>Moved, she embraced and soothed me; nay, preserved ;
</p>
<p>Her word sufficed to unlock the palace gates :
</p>
<p>I hasten'd home, but home was desolate ;
</p>
<p>No Adrien there ! Fearing the worst, I fled
</p>
<p>To thee, directed hither. As my wheels

<p>Paused at thy gates, the clang of arms behind,
</p>
<p>The ring of hoofs

<p>+ Louis XIII. is said to have possessed some natural talents, and

<p>in earlier youth to have exhibited the germes of noble qualities ; but
</p>
<p>a blight seems to have passed over his maturer life. Personally
</p>
<p>brave, but morally timid ; always governed, whether by his mother
</p>
<p>or his minister, and always repining at the yoke. The only affec-
</p>
<p>tion atnountmg to a passion that he betrayed was for the sports of
</p>
<p>the field ; yet it was his craving weakness (and this throws a kind
</p>
<p>of false interest over his character) to wish to be loved. He him-
</p>
<p>self loved no one. He suffered the only woman who seems to have
</p>
<p>been attached to him to wither in a convent; he gave up favourite

<p>after favourite to exile or the block. When Richelieu died, he said
</p>
<p>coldly, " Voila un grand politique mort !" and when the ill-fated but
</p>
<p>unprincipled Cinq Mars, whom he called le cher ami, was beheaded,
</p>
<p>he drew out his watch at the fatal hour, and said with a smile, " I
</p>
<p>think at this moment that le cher ami fait une vilaine mine." Never-
</p>
<p>theless, his conscience at times (for he was devout and superstitious)
</p>
<p>made him gentle, and his pride and his honour would often, when
</p>
<p>least expected, rouse him into haughty but brief resistance to the
</p>
<p>despotism under which he lived.

</p>
<p>Sorrow 1 No, sire !

<p>LOUIS.
</p>
<p>Bah ! for hmdi?ig, man.
</p>
<p>And Richelieu's dead ; 'twould be an indecorum
</p>
<p>Till he is buried; {yaivns) life is very tedious.
</p>
<p>I made a madrigal on life last week :
</p>
<p>You do not sing,* count ? Pity ; you should learn.
</p>
<p>Poor Richelieu had no ear, yet a great man.
</p>
<p>Ah ! what a weary weight devolves upon me !
</p>
<p>These endless wars, these thankless parliaments,
</p>
<p>The snares in which he tangled states and kings,
</p>
<p>Like the old fisher of the fable, Proteus,
</p>
<p>Netting great Neptune's wariest tribes, and changing
</p>
<p>Into all shapes when craft pursued himself :
</p>
<p>Oh, a great man !
</p>
<p>BARADAS.
</p>
<p>Your royal mother said so,
</p>
<p>And died in exile.
</p>
<p>LOUIS {sadly).
</p>
<p>True : I loved my mother \\
</p>
<p>BARADAS.
</p>
<p>The cardinal dies. Yet day revives the earth ;
</p>
<p>The rivers run not back. In truth, my liege,
</p>
<p>Did your high orb on others shine as him.
</p>
<p>Why, things as dull in their own selves as I am
</p>
<p>Would glow as brightly with the borrow'd beam.J
</p>
<p>* Louis had some musical taste and accomplishment, wherewith
</p>
<p>he often communicated to his favourites some of that wearisome
</p>
<p>ennui under which he himself almost unceasingly languished.
</p>
<p>t One of Louis's most bitter complaints against Richelieu was the
</p>
<p>continued banishment of the queen mother. It is impossible, how-
</p>
<p>ever, not to be convinced that the return of that most worthless in-
</p>
<p>triguante was wholly incompatible with the tranquillity of the king-

<p>dom. Yet, on the other hand, the poverty and privation which she
</p>
<p>endured in exile are discreditable to the generosity and the grati-
</p>
<p>tude of Richelieu ; she was his first patron, though afterward his
</p>
<p>most powerful persecutor.
</p>
<p>X In his Memoirs, Richelieu gives an amusing account of the in-
</p>
<p>solence and arts of Baradas, and observes, with indignant astonish-
</p>
<p>ment, that the favourite was never weary of repeating to the king
</p>
<p>that he (Baradas) would have made just as great a minister as

<p>upon his banner, " Fiat voluntas tua."

<p>* Louis was called 'I'he Just, but for no other reason than that he
</p>
<p>was born under the Libra.
</p>
<p>t Louis XUI. did not resemble either his father or his son in the

<p>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE ODES.
</p>
<p>The connexion between the lyric and dramatic
</p>
<p>forms of poetical composition is sufficiently ancient
</p>
<p>and established to warrant me, I trust, in subjoining to
</p>
<p>an historical play three attempts, equally elaborate, in
</p>
<p>the less cultivated art of the historical ode. Written
</p>
<p>at least with the advantage of mature experience, I
</p>
<p>venture to express a hope that these odes may, in some
</p>
<p>degree, redeem the faults of poems put forth, a few
</p>
<p>years since, in the rashness of early youth. If I re-
</p>
<p>quire an additional apology for associating them with
</p>
<p>the drama of " Richelieu," let me frankly acknowledge
</p>
<p>that I am not influenced by the belief, that, should
</p>
<p>their more obtrusive companion meet with any suc-
</p>
<p>cess, they are likely to obtain a larger circle of readers,
</p>
<p>and, therefore, a fairer judgment, than, in the present
</p>
<p>indisposition to poetry, an author whose reputation,
</p>
<p>such as it may be, lies in other departments of litera-
</p>
<p>ture, could reasonably expect for a volume exclusively
</p>
<p>devoted to lyrical compositions : and, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, if impartial judges should pass an unfavourable
</p>
<p>verdict on the pretensions, I have, at least, put them
</p>
<p>forward in a more unassuming shape than that of a
</p>
<p>separate publication.

<p>O D E I.
</p>
<p>THE
</p>
<p>LAST DAYS OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.
</p>
<p>" Her delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes, with shedding
</p>
<p>tears, to bewail Essex."  Contemporaneous Correspondence.
</p>
<p>" She refused all consolation ; few words she uttered, and they
</p>
<p>were all expressive of some hidden grief which she cared not to re-
</p>
<p>veal. But sighs and groans were the chief vent which she gave to
</p>
<p>her despondency, and which, though they discovered her sorrows,
</p>
<p>were never able to ease or assuage them. Ten days and nights
</p>
<p>she lay upon the carpet leaning on cushions which her maids broxight
</p>
<p>her," &c.  Hume.
</p>
<p>Rise from thy bloody grave,
</p>
<p>Thou soft Medusa of the Fated Line,*
</p>
<p>Whose evil beauty look'd to death the brave ;
</p>
<p>Discrowned queen, around whose passionate shame
</p>
<p>Terror and grief the palest flowers entwine,
</p>
<p>That ever veil'd the ruins of a name
</p>
<p>With the sweet parasites of song divine !
</p>
<p>Arise, sad ghost, arise,
</p>
<p>And if revenge outlive the tomb,
</p>
<p>Thou art avenged. Behold the doomer brought to doom !
</p>
<p>Lo, where thy mighty murderess lies,
</p>
<p>The sleepless couch, the sunless room,
</p>
<p>And, quell'd the eagle eye and lion mien.
</p>
<p>The wo-worn shadow of the Titan queen !
</p>
<p>II.
</p>
<p>There, sorrow-stricken, to the ground,
</p>
<p>AlLke by night and day,

</p>
<p>The heart's blood from the inward wound
</p>
<p>Ebbs silently away.
</p>
<p>And oft she turns from face to face
</p>
<p>A sharp and eager gaze,
</p>
<p>As if the memory sought to trace
</p>
<p>The sign of some lost dwelling-place,
</p>
<p>Beloved in happier days ;
</p>
<p>Ah, what tiie clew supplies
</p>
<p>In the cold vigil of a hireling's eyes?
</p>
<p>Ah, sad in cluldless age to weep alone,
</p>
<p>And start and gaze, to find no sorrow save our own !
</p>
<p>Oh soul, thou speedest to thy rest away,
</p>
<p>But not upon the pinions of the dove ;
</p>
<p>When death draws nigh, how miserable they
</p>
<p>Who have outlived all love !
</p>
<p>As on tlie solemn verge of night
</p>
<p>Lingers a weary moon.
</p>
<p>She wanes, the last of every glorious light
</p>
<p>That bathed with splendour her majestic noon:
</p>
<p>The stately stars that, clustering o'er the isle,
</p>
<p>Luird into glittering rest the subject sea;
</p>
<p>Gone the great masters of Italian wile,
</p>
<p>False to the world beside, but true to thee !
</p>
<p>Burleigh, the subtlest builder of thy fame.
</p>
<p>The gliding craft of winding Walsinghame;
</p>
<p>They who exalted yet before thee bowed ;
</p>
<p>And that more dazzling chivalry, the band
</p>
<p>That made thy court a faery land.
</p>
<p>In which thou wert enshrined to reign alone,
</p>
<p>The Gloriana of the diamond throne :
</p>
<p>All gone, and left thee sad amid the cloud !

<p>Oh piteous mockery of all pomp thou art,

<p>Poor child of clay, worn out with toil and years !

<p>As, layer by layer, the granite of the heart
</p>
<p>Dissolving, melteth to the weakest tears
</p>
<p>That ever village maiden shed above
</p>
<p>The grave that robb'd her quiet world of love.
</p>
<p>Ten days and nights upon that floor
</p>
<p>Those weary Umbs have lain ;
</p>
<p>And every hour but added more
</p>
<p>Of heaviness to pain.
</p>
<p>As gazing into dismal air

<p>The last wild love of womankind ;
</p>
<p>That love which, in its dire excess,

<p>ODE 11.
</p>
<p>CROMWELL'S DREAM.
</p>
<p>[The conception of this ode originated in a popular tradition of Cronri-
</p>
<p>well's earher days. It is thus strikingly related by Mr. Forster, in
</p>
<p>his recent and very valuable Life of Cromwell : " He had laid
</p>
<p>himself down, too fatigued to hope for sleep, when suddenly the
</p>
<p>curtains of his bed were s.lovvly withdrawn by a gigantic figure,
</p>
<p>which bore the aspect of a woman, and which, gazing at him si-
</p>
<p>lently for a while, told him that he should, before his death, be the
</p>
<p>greatest man in England. He remembered when he told the
</p>
<p>story, and the recollection marked the current of his thoughts,
</p>
<p>that the figure had not made mention of the ii'ord king." Alteration
</p>
<p>has been made in the scene of the vision and the age of Cromwell.]
</p>
<p>The moor spread wild and far
</p>
<p>In the sharp whiteness of a wintry shroud,
</p>
<p>Midnight yet moonless ; and the winds ice-bound,
</p>
<p>And a gray dusk  not darkness  reign'd around,
</p>
<p>Save where the paleness of a sudden star
</p>
<p>Peer'd o'er some haggard precipice of cloud.
</p>
<p>Where on the wold, the triple pathway cross'd,
</p>
<p>A sturdy wanderer, wearied, lone, and lost,
</p>
<p>Paused and gazed round ; a dwarfd but aged yew
</p>
<p>O'er the wan rime its gnomelike shadow threw ;
</p>
<p>The spot invited, and by sleep opprcss'd,
</p>
<p>Beneath the boughs he laid him down to rest.
</p>
<p>A man of stalwart limbs and hardy frame.
</p>
<p>Meet for the antique time when force was fame,
</p>
<p>Youthful in years  the features yet betray
</p>
<p>Thoughts rarely mellow'd till the locks are gray ;
</p>
<p>Round the firm lips the lines of solemn wile
</p>
<p>Might warn the wise of danger in the smile;
</p>
<p>But the blunt aspect spoke more sternly still
</p>
<p>That craft of craft, the Stubborn Will :
</p>
<p>'I'hat which, let what may betide,
</p>
<p>Never halts nor swerves aside ;

<p>The loftiest fate will longest lie
</p>
<p>In unrevealing sleep ;
</p>
<p>And yet unknown the destined race.
</p>
<p>Nor yet his soul had walk'd with grace ;
</p>
<p>Still, on the seas of Time
</p>
<p>Drifted the ever-careless prime ;
</p>
<p>But many a blast that o'er the sky
</p>
<p>All idly seems to sweep,
</p>
<p>Still while it speeds may spread the seeds.
</p>
<p>The toils of autumn reap :

<p>And we must blame the soil, and not the wind,

<p>Was outlined from the air, no more

</p>
<p>chondria and sullen discontent. Here, as Mr. Forster impressively
</p>
<p>observes, " in the tenants that rented from him, in the labourers that
</p>
<p>served under him, he sought to sow the seeds of his after troop of
</p>
<p>Ironsides. . . . All the famous doctrines of his later and more cele-

<p>brated years were tried and tested in the little farm of St. Ives. . . .

<p>Before going to their fieldwork in the morning, they (his servants)

<p>The scourge and servant of the Lord,

<p>This hand the Bible, that the sword,
</p>
<p>The Phantom-Cromwell rides !
</p>
<p>A lurid darkness swallows the array,
</p>
<p>One moment lost ; the darkness rolls away,
</p>
<p>And o'er tlie slaughter done
</p>
<p>Smiles, with his eyes of love, the setting sun.
</p>
<p>Death makes our foe our brother ;
</p>
<p>And, meekly, side by side,
</p>
<p>Sleep scowhng Hate and sternly smiling Pride,
</p>
<p>On the kind breast of earth, the quiet mother !
</p>
<p>Lo, where the victor sweeps along,
</p>
<p>The Gideon of the gory throng,
</p>
<p>Beneath his hoofs the harmless dead.
</p>
<p>The sunlight glory on his helmed head,
</p>
<p>Before him steel-clad Victory bending,
</p>
<p>Around, from heaven to earth ascending,
</p>
<p>The fiery incense of triumphant song.
</p>
<p>So, as some orb above a mighty stream
</p>
<p>Sway'd by its law, and sparkling in its beam,
</p>
<p>A power apart from that tempestuous tide,
</p>
<p>Calm and aloft behold the Phantom-Conqueror ride !
</p>
<p>" Art thou content, of these the greatest Thou,
</p>
<p>Hero and patriot ?" murmur'd then the fiend.
</p>
<p>The unsleeping dreamer answer'd, " Tempter, nay,
</p>
<p>My soul stands breathless on the mountain's brow.
</p>
<p>And looks beyond .'" Again swift darkness screen'd
</p>
<p>The solemn chieftain and the fierce array.
</p>
<p>And armed glory pass'd, like happier peace, away.

<p>Had both been left to Nature's quiet law,

<p>* The reader will recall the well-known story of Cromwell open-
</p>
<p>ing the coffin of Charles with the hilt of a private soldier's sword, and,

<p>after gazing on the body some time, observing calmly, that it seemed
</p>
<p>made for long hfe. 
</p>
<p>143
</p>
<p>Rudely beside the gory clay were flung
</p>
<p>A broken sceptre and an antique crown,
</p>
<p>So, after some imperial tragedy
</p>
<p>August alike with sorrow and renown,
</p>
<p>We smile to see the gauds that moved our awe.
</p>
<p>Purple and orb, in dusty lumber lie ;
</p>
<p>Alas, what thousands, on the stage of Time,
</p>
<p>liUvied the bawbles and revered the mime !
</p>
<p>PLiced by the trunk, with long and whitening hair
</p>
<p>By dark-red gouts besprent, the severed head
</p>
<p>Up to the gazer's musing eyes, the while,
</p>
<p>Look'd with its livid brow and stony smile.
</p>
<p>On that sad scene his gaze the dreamer fed.
</p>
<p>Familiar both the living and the dead;
</p>
<p>Terror, and hate, and strife concluded there,
</p>
<p>Calm in his six-feet realm* the monarch lay ;
</p>
<p>And by the Avarning victim's mangled clay
</p>
<p>The Phantom-Cromwell smiled, and bending down
</p>
<p>"With shadowy fingers, toy'd about the shadowy crown.
</p>
<p>" Art thou content, at last, a greater thou
</p>
<p>Than one to whom the loftiest bent the knee.
</p>
<p>Brand to the false, but banner to the free 
</p>
<p>Avenger and deliverer !"
</p>
<p>" Fiend," replied
</p>
<p>The dreamer, " who shall palter with the tide 1
</p>
<p>Deliverer! Pilots who the vessel save
</p>
<p>Leave not the helm while winds are on the wave.
</p>
<p>The future is the haven of the now !"

<p>And night gave back to air the doomsman and the dead !

<p>by the rival to his throne " What share of territory wilt thou give

<p>t When Cromwell came down (leaving his musketeers without

<p>144
</p>
<p>And worn cheek lighted with a feverish glow ;
</p>
<p>It spoke, and at the aspect and the sound
</p>
<p>The dreamer breath'd a fierce and restless sigh ;
</p>
<p>An instinct bade him hate and fear
</p>
<p>That unknown shape, as if a foe were near;
</p>
<p>For, mighty in that mien of thoughtful youth,
</p>
<p>Spoke fraud's most deadly foe  a soul on fire with
</p>
<p>Truth ;
</p>
<p>A soul without one stain
</p>
<p>Save England's hallowing tears ; the sad and starry
</p>
<p>Vane !
</p>
<p>There enters on that conclave high
</p>
<p>A solitary man ;
</p>
<p>And rustling through the conclave high
</p>
<p>A troubled murmur ran ;
</p>
<p>A moment more  loud riot all 
</p>
<p>With pike and morion gleam the startled hall :
</p>
<p>And there, where, since the primal date
</p>
<p>Of Freedom's glorious morn,
</p>
<p>The eternal people solemn sate,
</p>
<p>The people's champion spat his ribald scorn!
</p>
<p>Dark moral to all ages ! Blent in one
</p>
<p>The broken fasces and the shatter'd throne ;
</p>
<p>The deed that damns immortally is done ;
</p>
<p>And F'oRCE, the Cain of nations, reigns alone !
</p>
<p>The veil is rent, the crafty soul lies bare !
</p>
<p>" Behold," the demon cried, " the Future Cromwell,
</p>
<p>there !
</p>
<p>Art thou content, on earth the greatest thou.
</p>
<p>Apostate and Usurper?" From his rest
</p>
<p>The dreamer started with a heaving breast,
</p>
<p>The better angels of the human heart
</p>
<p>Not dumb to his : the hell-born laugh'd aloud,
</p>
<p>And o'er the evil vision rush'd the cloud !

<p>Naples was evidently near, he applied to Cardmal Kufl'o and the

<p>liimself; was discovered in the disguise of a pea.sant, and carrifd on

<p>fluenced by an infatuated attachment to Lady Hamilton, then on

</p>
<p>of the Neapolitan Court made her forget what was due to the char-
</p>
<p>acter of her sex as well as of her country. The body was carried out
</p>
<p>to a considerable distance and sunk m the bay, with three double-
</p>
<p>headed shot, weighing 250 pounds, lied to its legs. Between two
</p>
<p>and three weeks afterward, when the king was on board the Fou-
</p>
<p>droyant, a Neapolitan fisherman came to the ship, and solemnly de-
</p>
<p>clared that Caraccioli had risen from the bottom of the sea, and wa
</p>
<p>coming as fast as he could to Naples, swimming half out of the water.

</p>
<p>The chaplain by his side.
</p>
<p>His hand he press'd, his cheek he kiss'd :
</p>
<p>" Look up,'" the captain cried ;
</p>
<p>" Twenty have struck and the rest have fled,
</p>
<p>We have won the victor}- 1''
</p>
<p>"Thank God, thank God," then feebly said
</p>
<p>The Sidney of the sea ;X
</p>
<p>"My duty is done."^ So the race was run,
</p>
<p>And thus our Nelson died.
</p>
<p> As often as a ship struck, the crew of the Victory hurra'd, and at
</p>
<p>every hurra a risible expression of joy gleamed in the eyes and
</p>
<p>marked the countenance of the dying hero.  Soiakev's iVekon.

<p>ity. Each insisted, at the last, that the surgeon should leave him

<p>and attend to those to whom Jie might be useful.
