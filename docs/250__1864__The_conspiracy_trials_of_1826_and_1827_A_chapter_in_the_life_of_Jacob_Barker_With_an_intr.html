<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>The appearance of the present volume, at a
</p>
<p>time so remote from the date of the transactions
</p>
<p>described, may be a matter of surprise to some;
</p>
<p>while, from the character of the subjects presented,
</p>
<p>others may think it were better the work had
</p>
<p>never been published. Many of the prominent
</p>
<p>actors in the events referred to, and their co-
</p>
<p>temporaries who were interested in them at
</p>
<p>the time of their occurrence, have passed away,
</p>
<p>and those who survive have reached a period of
</p>
<p>life when men seek to escape, in repose and tran-
</p>
<p>quillity, from the more stirring and exciting re-
</p>
<p>collections of earlier manhood. More than a
</p>
<p>generation stands between us and the events of
</p>
<p>1826 and 1827, a period into which has been
</p>
<p>crowded more of human history and human pro-
</p>
<p>gress than into centuries of the earlier time.
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker still lives, and in- the giant strides
</p>
<p>of the present generation has borne his part and
</p>
<p>helped to make its history. The octogenarian
</p>
<p>of to-day, who was a leading participant in the
</p>
<p>efforts of a past generation, has bridged the

</p>
<p>chasm of intervening years by incessant activi-
</p>
<p>ties, and now stands to receive, at the hands of
</p>
<p>his fellow-citizens, the verdict of censure or ap-
</p>
<p>plause, as he may have acted well or ill, in the
</p>
<p>conspicuous part he has played, for more than
</p>
<p>threescore years and ten, in the business and
</p>
<p>public affairs of his country.
</p>
<p>The events set forth in this volume form a
</p>
<p>chapter and constitute an exciting episode in the
</p>
<p>life of Mr. Barker. They not only live in the
</p>
<p>traditions of the period when they occurred, but
</p>
<p>are often reproduced in the current literature and
</p>
<p>appropriated by the biographer and historian of
</p>
<p>the present times, not unfrequently with a care-
</p>
<p>less disregard' to facts, and wanton indifference
</p>
<p>to the damaging influence their misstatements
</p>
<p>may have upon the reputation of those concerned.
</p>
<p>It is not strange that the name of one who has
</p>
<p>filled so large a place in the public eye as Jacob
</p>
<p>Barker should often appear in newspapers, pe-
</p>
<p>riodicals, and books which treat of the events of
</p>
<p>our past history; especially of those departments
</p>
<p>of business and public life in which he acted so
</p>
<p>prominent a part. It is with a view to correct
</p>
<p>false statements in regard to the events treated
</p>
<p>of in this volumfe, and as far as possible to pre-
</p>
<p>vent their repetition in future, as well as to
</p>
<p>gratify the wish of a number of Mr. Barker's
</p>
<p>friends, that he has consented to the present

<p>PREFACE. 6
</p>
<p>The commanding position and influence of Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker in the financial operations of the period
</p>
<p>referred to, aroused the jealousy of his rivals,
</p>
<p>who conspired to circumvent and destroy the
</p>
<p>man who had proved himself eminently their
</p>
<p>superior in the race of fair and honorable busi-
</p>
<p>ness competition. From the facts and statements
</p>
<p>contained in this work, the public wdll be able to
</p>
<p>judge of the means and agencies through which
</p>
<p>they sought to accomplish their object, and to
</p>
<p>see that, whatever may have been the nominal
</p>
<p>and legal' sequences of these Conspiracy Trials,
</p>
<p>the grand result was, the confusion and discom-
</p>
<p>fiture of the conspirators, and the manifestation
</p>
<p>not only of the innocence and integrity of their
</p>
<p>intended victim, but that his powers and re-
</p>
<p>sources were fully equal to the new and untried
</p>
<p>emergencies with which the malice of his ene-
</p>
<p>mies had so artfully surrounded him. A distin-
</p>
<p>guished writer, lately, referring to these trials,
</p>
<p>remarks, "Mr. Barker's defence was a prodigy
</p>
<p>of ability;" and so it will appear to those who
</p>
<p>may read this volume.
</p>
<p>The conspiracy charged against Mr. Barker was,
</p>
<p>.^ in fact, a conspiracy on the part of others to ruin
</p>
<p> him, in order to save themselves from the odium,
</p>
<p>and other consequences, arising out of the events
</p>
<p>which served as the occasion for these trials.
</p>
<p>At the inception of the scheme, Mr. Barker's
</p>
<p>high reputation and commanding position in the

</p>
<p>monetary affairs of the country, and especially
</p>
<p>among the leading business men, shielded him
</p>
<p>even from suspicion. But they sought a shining
</p>
<p>mark, and desired to make a costly sacrifice, in
</p>
<p>order more effectually to conceal their real object,
</p>
<p>which was to strike down the man whose con-
</p>
<p>ceded superiority had secured to him almost a
</p>
<p>controlling influence, and who, being made the
</p>
<p>scapegoat of sins not his own, would furnish
</p>
<p>them with the means of escape from impending
</p>
<p>perils, while, at the same time, it would remove
</p>
<p>out of their way the only one whom they feared
</p>
<p>in the competitions of business. Circumstances
</p>
<p>favored their plans and objects. Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>was connected with many of the banks and
</p>
<p>chartered companies of New York at that day,
</p>
<p>and his advice and assistance were sought by
</p>
<p>most. When, therefore, the crash came, and the
</p>
<p>community was startled by the failure of many
</p>
<p>of these banks and companies, it was natural that
</p>
<p>the public eye should turn to the man whose
</p>
<p>position and influence would seem to make him
</p>
<p>responsible. Still, he escaped suspicion, and
</p>
<p>others were implicated as the cause of these ca-
</p>
<p>lamities. But his enemies bided their time, and,
</p>
<p>led on by a distinguished legal gentleman, com-
</p>
<p>binations were formed, and plots were laid, which
</p>
<p>eventuated in bringing Mr. Barker before the
</p>
<p>tribunals as a suspected party. The failure

<p>pecuniary disaster among the stockholders, and
</p>
<p>embarrassed, in many ways, the operations of
</p>
<p>business and trade; and there was scarce any
</p>
<p>one who did not feel, more or less, their effects.
</p>
<p>A community thus smarting under pecuniary
</p>
<p>loss and embarrassment was the ready means in
</p>
<p>the hands of the conspirators, used against Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, and they did not fail to fan the flame of
</p>
<p>popular excitement, till the people became cla-
</p>
<p>morous against the supposed perpetrators of so
</p>
<p>great a wrong. So strong w^as the feeling thus
</p>
<p>aroused, that Mr. Barker was cut off from the
</p>
<p>ordinary means of self- vindication. The press,
</p>
<p>if not subsidized, had become overawed by the
</p>
<p>clamors of public opinion, and he was denied its
</p>
<p>use that he might reach the public mind and
</p>
<p>hold opinion in abeyance till his guilt or inno-
</p>
<p>cence could be proved. So far, his enemies had
</p>
<p>triumphed ; and he found himself on trial for
</p>
<p>high crimes, under the disadvantages of a pre-
</p>
<p>judgment, by an "outside pressure," which threat-
</p>
<p>ened to invade the rights of the citizen, in the
</p>
<p>only sanctuary where those rights are regarded
</p>
<p>as absolutely sacred and safe, under the guardian-
</p>
<p>ship of our constitutions and laws. While we
</p>
<p>would utter no word that would impair the feel-
</p>
<p>ing of reverence for law, or cast a stain upon the
</p>
<p>ermine of judicial sanctions, we are compelled, in
</p>
<p>view^ of the facts disclosed on the trial of Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, to believe that courts are not always

<p>above the range of popular clamor, or judges
</p>
<p>secure from the machinations of artful and de-
</p>
<p>signing counsel.
</p>
<p>One of the serious difficulties encountered by
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker, in the Conspiracy Trials, was the
</p>
<p>fact that some of the most influential inhabitants
</p>
<p>of the city, misled by false representations, and
</p>
<p>carried away by the excitement of the hour, gave
</p>
<p>their influence to those who had conspired for
</p>
<p>his downfall, who were themselves also men of
</p>
<p>influence. In bringing the present volume before
</p>
<p>the public, it becomes necessary to present the
</p>
<p>names of those who acted a prominent part in the
</p>
<p>transactions described. No man should object to
</p>
<p>meet the record of his acts, no matter when and
</p>
<p>where presented. Mr. Barker's friends have
</p>
<p>thought that great injustice was done him in the
</p>
<p>legal, or illegal, proceedings in the Conspiracy
</p>
<p>Trials, as well as, to some extent, in the opinions
</p>
<p>of social life. They therefore desire, in order
</p>
<p>that his fair fame should stand without taint or
</p>
<p>blemish, that the simple facts of the case should
</p>
<p>be permanently put on record before his death,
</p>
<p>and given to the public. More than a quarter
</p>
<p>of a century has elapsed, and most of those who
</p>
<p>acted with the men of the generation before
</p>
<p>ours, have passed from life ; but Mr. Barker still
</p>
<p>lives, and his deeds will live after him. And
</p>
<p>others still live; who were among those who con-

</p>
<p>both he and they will stand for trial before the
</p>
<p>present generation who may read this book. It
</p>
<p>is well its publication has been delayed so long.
</p>
<p>Time has cooled the passions and softened the
</p>
<p>prejudices of those who survive of a past gene-
</p>
<p>ration, while those of the present will judge
</p>
<p>with unbiased minds, and both, alike, rendej:
</p>
<p>their award, not of condemnation, but of acquittal,
</p>
<p>yea, of applause, to the man who then, in those
</p>
<p>trying scenes, and before, and since, through a
</p>
<p>long life, has done so much that deserves the
</p>
<p>admiration and gratitude of his countrymen.
</p>
<p>The materials of which the present volume is
</p>
<p>composed are presented in the form in which
</p>
<p>they were thrown together by Mr. Barker, about
</p>
<p>the time when the events occurred, without any
</p>
<p>intention of publishing them, and with no regard
</p>
<p>either to style or method. It is preferred that
</p>
<p>they should go forth as originally prepared, with-
</p>
<p>out embellishment, analysis, comparison, or argu-
</p>
<p>ment; believing that a view of the simple and
</p>
<p>naked facts of the case will be their best present-
</p>
<p>ment to an intelligent and discriminating public.
</p>
<p>The introduction is a simple resume of his life
</p>
<p>up to the time of the Conspiracy Trials; a run-
</p>
<p>ning outline, merely intended to furnish illustra-
</p>
<p>tions of character, without regard to historical
</p>
<p>sequence or fulness,  to be filled up, it is ex-
</p>
<p>pected, in a future volume. Such a volume, it is

<p>life of Jacob Barker; supplying what is oraitted

<p>in the Introduction to this book, and extending

<p>to the present period, or to the time of his death,

<p>therefore, the Introduction is, as it ought to be,
</p>
<p>simply intended to introduce the reader, by brief
</p>
<p>notices of the past, to that passage of his life
</p>
<p>unfolded in the following pages, it may also
</p>
<p>serve to increase the desire already felt for a
</p>
<p>complete record of one of the most strongly
</p>
<p>marked, and in many respects remarkable, cha-
</p>
<p>racters which our country has produced.

<p>Mr. Barker and the Free Negroes of New Orleans 323
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>On the little island of Nantucket, lying far off the
</p>
<p>New England coast, among its population of hardj and
</p>
<p>adventurous whalemen, who gathered their spoils in the
</p>
<p>polar zones and on every ocean, the young Quaker,
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker, in the last quarter of the last century,
</p>
<p>at the age of five years, found his home. Born, indee-d,
</p>
<p>in Maine, during a temporary residence of his parents,
</p>
<p>yet unfolding his childhood and youth on the island,
</p>
<p>he boasts Nantucket as the place of his nativity,  not
</p>
<p>born, but bred there.
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker and Benjamin Franklin descended
</p>
<p>from the same ancestral stock; Jacob Barker being
</p>
<p>third cousin in the paternal, and fourth cousin in the
</p>
<p>maternal, line, to Benjamin Franklin. There was a
</p>
<p>striking personal resemblance between these two re-
</p>
<p>markable men, as will be seen by comparing their por-
</p>
<p>traits ; nor were they unlike in their prominent traits
</p>
<p>of character. Both have made their mark in history.
</p>
<p>The one, by his genius and labors, illuminated the
</p>
<p>world of science and literature, and led in the counsels
</p>
<p>of statesmen and diplomats ; the other, turning his
</p>
<p>thoughts towards the more practical concerns of life,
</p>
<p>won distinction as a leader in mercantile and financial
</p>
<p>affairs, and has borne no unimportant part in the
</p>
<p>politics of his country. The mothers of both were
</p>
<p>born in Nantucket.

<p>16 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>The susceptible period of childhood he spent in his
</p>
<p>island home, in the midst of the ocean, where, within
</p>
<p>sound of its mighty roar and within sight of its sublime
</p>
<p>phenomena, it is not strange he early caught the
</p>
<p>inspiration of the sea ; and where, too, he listened,
</p>
<p>with a boy's wonder and admiration, to the stories of
</p>
<p>its maritime population, till his imagination was
</p>
<p>kindled with the romance of bold and daring adven-
</p>
<p>ture and hairbreadth escapes of a "life on the ocean-
</p>
<p>wave." Nor is it strange that in his boyish ambition
</p>
<p>he should choose the sea as the theatre on which to try
</p>
<p>his fortune in life. There, too, in his boyish sports, he
</p>
<p>showed his undaunted spirit, as he would launch his
</p>
<p>boat upon the troubled waves, and play with danger as
</p>
<p>if enamored of its perils,  fit emblem and foreshadow-
</p>
<p>ing of the fearless and indomitable courage which has
</p>
<p>characterized his conduct through a long and stormy
</p>
<p>life of unrest, amid the conflicts and competitions of
</p>
<p>business and public afi'airs. And it is a beautiful proof
</p>
<p>of his undying "first love," when we see him turn, in
</p>
<p>later years, from the exciting scenes of busy life, to
</p>
<p>visit, with filial afi'ection, the home of his childhood;
</p>
<p>to behold the venerable man of fourscore renewing his
</p>
<p>youth, by entering again with joyous hilarity into the
</p>
<p>sports of boyhood, surrounded by his grandchildren, in
</p>
<p>whose companionship and pastimes he seems almost to
</p>
<p>become young again. Wherever may have been his
</p>
<p>residence, he has always had another home in Nan-
</p>
<p>tucket, to which, with almost a pilgrim's devotion, he
</p>
<p>would resort whenever opportunity was allowed him to
</p>
<p>seek repose and relaxation from the cares and anxieties
</p>
<p>of business.

</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 17
</p>
<p>and mercantile pursuits displayed themselves at a
</p>
<p>remarkably early period of his life. While quite a
</p>
<p>boy, he would send any little sums of money he might
</p>
<p>have, by the captain of his older brother James's
</p>
<p>packet, as an adventure, to Boston, to purchase some-
</p>
<p>thing for the Nantucket market, which on the return
</p>
<p>of the packet he would sell on his own account. On
</p>
<p>several occasions his brother James allowed him to go
</p>
<p>as cabin-boy in his packet to New York and Boston.
</p>
<p>On one of these trips the passengers presented him
</p>
<p>with thirty-one and a quarter cents. This sum he
</p>
<p>invested at Boston in three iron tobacco-boxes, and took
</p>
<p>them to Nantucket, where he sold two of them at a
</p>
<p>penny apiece profit ; the other got a little rusty, and
</p>
<p>was sold at cost. When at Nantucket, forty years
</p>
<p>after, he met an old man leaning on his stajBf, who
</p>
<p>asked him, abruptly, ''Jacob, will you take a piece of
</p>
<p>tobacco?" at the same time presenting his box. Jacob
</p>
<p>declined his ofier, but recognized his old friend and the
</p>
<p>box he had sold him. On one occasion he accompanied
</p>
<p>his brother James up the Hudson, on a vessel laden
</p>
<p>for Troy. Ice-bound, however, at Poughkeepsie, his
</p>
<p>brother left the vessel and cargo in charge of the boy
</p>
<p>Jacob, who managed the matter quite to his brother's
</p>
<p>satisfaction, by exchanging the cargo for the produc-
</p>
<p>tions of the country ; ' and at the same time, by a little
</p>
<p>traffic on his own account, he returned to Nantucket
</p>
<p>with eight dollars in his pocket. Soon after his return
</p>
<p>from Poughkeepsie, he wrote a letter to his half-brother,
</p>
<p>Gideon Gardner, residing at Hudson, New York, in
</p>
<p>which he stated that he wished to go to sea, learn a
</p>
<p>trade, or go to school. This letter afterwards found its
</p>
<p>way into the newspapers, through Mr. Gardner's ex-

<p>18 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>ecutor. The orthograpliy of the letter justified the
</p>
<p>latter wish.
</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen, Jacob left Nantucket to enter
</p>
<p>the school of Professor Wall^ in New Bedford. It was
</p>
<p>here he first met and loved Miss Hazzard, who after-
</p>
<p>wards became his wife. He remained at school nearly
</p>
<p>a year, when, hearing of the death of his brother Isaac,
</p>
<p>he returned home. There for some months he served
</p>
<p>as a clerk in the store of John Elkins. But his aims
</p>
<p>were higher than the dull monotonies and quiet routine
</p>
<p>of a country store. Yielding to his early predilections,
</p>
<p>and stirred by his youthful ambition, he determined at
</p>
<p>once to enter upon the life of a sailor, and shipped as a
</p>
<p>raw hand on board a packet bound for New York, with
</p>
<p>the understanding that he might be discharged at that
</p>
<p>place could he procure a berth on board a ship bound
</p>
<p>for the East Indies.
</p>
<p>On reaching New York, his brother Abraham, then
</p>
<p>a clerk in a leading mercantile house, induced him to
</p>
<p>abandon his seafaring schemes and enter the counting-
</p>
<p>room of Isaac Hicks, a commission merchant of high
</p>
<p>standing in the city. On his arrival in New York, his
</p>
<p>capital consisted of one hundred dollars in money, the
</p>
<p>avails of his former trafficking in Nantucket, together
</p>
<p>with investments already made in absent adventures,
</p>
<p>which yielded another hundred : "af these, his importa-
</p>
<p>tions from Russia were the most profitable, and con-
</p>
<p>sisted of feather beds and diapers. So, at the age of
</p>
<p>seventeen, with two hundred dollars in his pocket and
</p>
<p>a situation in one of the first mercantile houses in New
</p>
<p>York, Jacob Barker may be said to have taken his start
</p>
<p>in the real business of life.

</p>
<p>On entering the counting-room of Mr. Hicks, he de-
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 19
</p>
<p>voted himself with alacrity and fidelity to the service
</p>
<p>of his employer, but neglected no opportunity which
</p>
<p>leisure or convenience ajQforded for indulging his early-
</p>
<p>formed habit of trading a little on his own account.
</p>
<p>One of his first experiments of this kind was in the
</p>
<p>purchase of a gold watch, at a street auction, for which
</p>
<p>he paid twenty dollars. At the time, he feared he had
</p>
<p>been overreached and outwitted ; but in the end it
</p>
<p>turned out a good speculation. As this transaction
</p>
<p>aifords a striking illustration of the character of young
</p>
<p>Jacob at this early period, we copy the full account
</p>
<p>of it, as told by another.
</p>
<p>"The circumstances of the sale were these. Jacob
</p>
<p>Barker was sent to Messrs. James and Samuel Watson,
</p>
<p>an extensive commission house of Front Street, by Mr.
</p>
<p>Hicks, for a note for sperm candles sold them. Those
</p>
<p>extensive merchants proposed to this small boy a sale
</p>
<p>of shipbread, saying his fellow-clerk, Mr. Samuel
</p>
<p>Hicks, often purchased the article of them in exchange
</p>
<p>for liver oil, for which article they frequently had
</p>
<p>orders from Virginia, with which bread he supplied the
</p>
<p>ships consigned to Mr. Hicks to profit. Jacob replied
</p>
<p>that he had no money wherewith to pay for bread :
</p>
<p>they proposed to give him credit, a confidence doubtless
</p>
<p>arising from his being in the employ of Mr. Hicks.
</p>
<p>He thanked them, but declined, saying he dare not
</p>
<p>incur a debt, adding that he had not any liver oil,
</p>
<p>nothing but a gold watch, which he should like to
</p>
<p>barter for bread. They asked to see the watch, which
</p>
<p>being exhibited, and the price named, payable in ship-
</p>
<p>bread, they proposed to have it left, and they would
</p>
<p>decide in the morning, if he could call when he went to

</p>
<p>the post-office for letters, to which he assented, saying,
</p>
<p>20 INTHODUCTION.
</p>
<p>'You wish to have it examined by a watchmaker. I
</p>
<p>have had that service performed, and know the watch
</p>
<p>to be good.'
</p>
<p>"He called in the morning, when the Messrs. Wat-
</p>
<p>son agreed to keep the watch on the terms proposed.
</p>
<p>" Here we have a barter trade between merchants of
</p>
<p>high standing in commercial circles and a green boy
</p>
<p>from Nantucket.
</p>
<p>" The next object of Jacob was to find a market for
</p>
<p>his bread. He w^as sent by Mr. Hicks to collect a note
</p>
<p>for codfish sold Thomas Knox, Esq., a very amiable,
</p>
<p>intelligent, and liberal merchant of Wall Street.
</p>
<p>" Inquiry w^as made of Mr. Knox if he did not wish
</p>
<p>to purchase some shipbread for stores for the vessel on
</p>
<p>board which the fish had been sent. The reply was
</p>
<p>that the stores were all on board, but that he had an
</p>
<p>order for three hundred barrels of bread for a ship
</p>
<p>which was undergoing repairs at the ship-yards, which
</p>
<p>would be wanted in about three weeks, and inquired of
</p>
<p>the lad at what price he would furnish that quantity.
</p>
<p>He had but ten barrels : his reply was that he would
</p>
<p>go for and bring immediately a sample, with the in-
</p>
<p>formation required, for which he repaired to the store
</p>
<p>of Messrs. Watson. They expressed a disposition to
</p>
<p>sell,  said it was a consignment from Virginia, had been
</p>
<p>long on hand, therefore they would sell cheap. A con-
</p>
<p>ditional bargain was made, they to take Mr. Knox's
</p>
<p>note at four months, without Jacob's endorsement, if he
</p>
<p>could not get it at a shorter period.
</p>
<p>" A sample of the bread was taken to Mr. Knox, the
</p>
<p>price named on a credit of sixty days. An answer
</p>
<p>was promised the next morning, for which Jacob was

</p>
<p>punctual to call, when he was informed that John
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 21
</p>
<p>Hyslop, an extensive baker, asked the same price for
</p>
<p>the same quality of bread on a credit of ninety days,
</p>
<p>Mr. Knox remarking, 'You are a pleasant little fellow,
</p>
<p>and if you will allow the same credit I will take the bread
</p>
<p>of you.' This being agreed to, Jacob observed that he
</p>
<p>should like to have a memorandum to that eftect. Knox
</p>
<p>smiled, gave the memorandum of the agreement, taking
</p>
<p>an order on the Messrs. Watson for the bread. When
</p>
<p>delivered, a note was drawn for the amount due them,
</p>
<p>and, as a matter of accommodation, Mr. Knox paid the
</p>
<p>money for the balance.
</p>
<p>'' Mr. Barker thus turned his watch into more money
</p>
<p>than he gave for it, and made one hundred and twenty-
</p>
<p>five dollars profit on the bread,  ^more than doubling the
</p>
<p>capital he brought with him from Nantucket, in a very
</p>
<p>few months after taking up his residence in New York."
</p>
<p>Once, during a sickly season, he was allowed by Mr.
</p>
<p>Hicks to visit Ballst(3n. At that place he purchased a
</p>
<p>horse, on which he made the journey to New Bedford,
</p>
<p>where he traded the animal for crude sperm oil, which
</p>
<p>he caused to be manufactured and shipped to New
</p>
<p>York, where it yielded him double the cost of the
</p>
<p>horse.
</p>
<p>One day Mr. Hicks pointed to a lot of soap which
</p>
<p>had been a long time in the store, and said, " Jacob,
</p>
<p>why does thee not sell that soap?" to which Jacob re-
</p>
<p>plied, "For want of an applicant," but remarked,
</p>
<p>at the same time, "I will purchase it at eight cents, if ,
</p>
<p>thee will give me four months' credit and allow me to
</p>
<p>send it as an adventure to Havana." Mr. H. said,
</p>
<p>in his usually rapid manner, "Take it, take it: I am
</p>
<p>tired of the sight of it." It was shipped by Jacob to
</p>

</p>
<p>Havana. Within six weeks he received returns of
</p>
<p>22 INTEODUCTION.
</p>
<p>fifty cents per pound in specie. Mr. Hicks entered the
</p>
<p>store while Jacob was counting his gold, and said, in
</p>
<p>surprise, "What is all this?" To which the fortunate
</p>
<p>young speculator replied, "Money for the soap; and I
</p>
<p>am now ready to pay for it, though not due for more
</p>
<p>than two months." Mr. Hicks passed on without reply,
</p>
<p>evidently pleased with his young friend's success.
</p>
<p>Another business exploit of young Barker about this
</p>
<p>time was of a bolder and more comprehensive character,
</p>
<p>involving much responsibility, and requiring enterprise,
</p>
<p>skill, and tact for its successful execution. We refer
</p>
<p>to the fact of his being sent, with the consent of his
</p>
<p>employer, Mr. Hicks, by several prominent merchants
</p>
<p>in New York, to Nantucket to purchase ships for them.
</p>
<p>The whaling business being depressed at that time, the
</p>
<p>owners of ships there desired to sell them. Young
</p>
<p>Jacob went twice to the island on this errand, and pur-
</p>
<p>chased three ships. The transactions in all their details
</p>
<p>were in the highest degree creditable to the young
</p>
<p>agent, and evinced a maturity of judgment, a readiness
</p>
<p>to comprehend emergencies, and a quickness and energy
</p>
<p>in executing his plans truly astonishing in one of his
</p>
<p>age. For these services his employer, Mr. Hicks, re-
</p>
<p>ceived a commission of two and a half per cent, on the
</p>
<p>entire amount of the purchase-money.
</p>
<p>The story so often told about Mr. Barker in refer-
</p>
<p>ence to a marine policy of insurance has never, we
</p>
<p>#believe, been correctly reported in print. Insurances,
</p>
<p>at the time referred to, were made after the manner of
</p>
<p>Lloyds, London,  by individual subscription. Young
</p>
<p>Barker, expecting the arrival of a vessel in whose cargo
</p>
<p>he had a small interest, called upon a celebrated under-

</p>
<p>writer who usually insured his adventures, and made a
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 23
</p>
<p>verbal agreement for insurance. The next day he
</p>
<p>learned that some disaster had overtaken the vessel.
</p>
<p>Desiring to possess himself of evidence of the contract
</p>
<p>already made, he wrote a note to the underwriter, re-
</p>
<p>questing that if the policy had been filled up it should
</p>
<p>be sent to him ; but if it had not been filled up, not to
</p>
<p>proceed in the matter till he should call and see him.
</p>
<p>The policy, however, had not been prepared, and the
</p>
<p>messenger who bore the note was detained till it could
</p>
<p>be made out, when it was sent by him. This simple
</p>
<p>transaction, which occurred during Mr. Barker's mino-
</p>
<p>rity, and which was satisfactorily settled between the
</p>
<p>parties, who were ever afterwards warm personal friends,
</p>
<p>has served as the ground of innumerable fictions and
</p>
<p>false statements from the time of its occurrence to the
</p>
<p>present day. .
</p>
<p>During his minority he not only traded with foreign
</p>
<p>countries, but became part owner in three ships and a
</p>
<p>brig, kept an account with the United States Branch
</p>
<p>Bank, and had his notes regularly discounted until he
</p>
<p>reached his majority, after which Isaac Hicks, referring
</p>
<p>to Jacob, told the directors jestingly they had been dis-
</p>
<p>counting the notes of boys. This caused Jacob's note,
</p>
<p>the next time it came round for renewal, to be thrown
</p>
<p>out, with the remark that the bank could not discount
</p>
<p>the paper of minors. They were informed Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>was no longer a minor; and his note was again dis-
</p>
<p>counted.
</p>
<p>Young Barker lived in the family of his employer the
</p>
<p>last two years that he was in his employ, and paid him
</p>
<p>for board one-half what he had paid at other places.
</p>
<p>The difference in the price of board was the only com-

</p>
<p>pensation he received for his services.
</p>
<p>24 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>The fruit of Mr. Barker's trafficking and specu-
</p>
<p>lations during his minority was the accumulation of
</p>
<p>five thousand dollars capital. In this simple fact we
</p>
<p>read the eulogy and comprehensive commentary on the
</p>
<p>character and conduct of his boyhood and youth. The
</p>
<p>result was brought about by no fortuitous chances and
</p>
<p>unreflected and thoughtless adventures, but was the
</p>
<p>reward of well-considered plans, restless activity, and
</p>
<p>an abiding and hopeful self-reliance. The value of the
</p>
<p>accumulation was not so much in its possession as in
</p>
<p>the self-training and discipline resulting from the
</p>
<p>efforts put forth to realize it ; fitting him, as these did,
</p>
<p>to step from his boyhood's probation into the unfettered
</p>
<p>arena of manhood's sterner competitions and severer
</p>
<p>struggles. "The boy was father of the man." It is
</p>
<p>such boys, when they grow to manhood, who are the
</p>
<p>pillars of society and framework of a nation's strength
</p>
<p>and grandeur. How few of our boys achieve so much
</p>
<p>in their minority, and commence their manhood with a
</p>
<p>capital of their own earning, and an experience of
</p>
<p>hardy discipline and self-denial which is the sure
</p>
<p>pledge of unfailing success!
</p>
<p>In 1801, Mr. Barker commenced business on his own
</p>
<p>account, having entered into a co-partnership with John
</p>
<p>Bard and Jonas Minturn, as commission merchants.
</p>
<p>On the 27th of August of the same year, he was mar-
</p>
<p>ried to his former schoolmate Elizabeth Hazzard,
</p>
<p>daughter of Thomas Hazzard, of New Bedford, and after-
</p>
<p>wards of New York. She died in New York, September
</p>
<p>18, 1861. While at his wedding-dinner, a letter was
</p>
<p>handed to him which informed him of the loss of all
</p>
<p>his property in consequence of having endorsed and

</p>
<p>of the wedding-party, and to whom Mr. Barker, after
</p>
<p>reading it, handed the letter. He also read it, and
</p>
<p>then, at Mr. B.'s invitation, took wine with him. The
</p>
<p>rest of the party Avere ignorant of the contents of the
</p>
<p>letter. Neither the equanimity of Mr. Barker nor
</p>
<p>the hilarity of the occasion^were disturbed by the unex-
</p>
<p>pected intelligence, and, full of joy and hope, he bore
</p>
<p>his young bride to his home in New York.
</p>
<p>To discharge the liabilities incurred in the unfortunate
</p>
<p>transaction with Mr. Deaves, required the sacrifice of
</p>
<p>all Mr. Barker's earnings up to that period. But the
</p>
<p>dishonored bills were paid, and he was enabled still to
</p>
<p>continue his business. His commission business had
</p>
<p>now become very extensive, and his connections in that
</p>
<p>line were with the most respectable merchants of the
</p>
<p>country. Not satisfied, however, with a large and suc-
</p>
<p>cessful commission business, he extended the scope of
</p>
<p>his operations, and, not merely from early predilections,
</p>
<p>but from its importance to the commerce of the country
</p>
<p>as well as its promising pecuniary results to himself,
</p>
<p>embarked also in maritime trade. Directing his ener-
</p>
<p>gies to this new field of enterprise, his ships soon began
</p>
<p>to float on every sea. With Russia especially he
</p>
<p>opened a large trade. He established a house in Liver-
</p>
<p>pool, and his foreign connections in business were very
</p>
<p>extensive. In the purchase and sale of ships his cus-
</p>
<p>tomers were found even among emperors. He con-
</p>
<p>tinued his maritime operations till he became the largest
</p>
<p>ship-owner in the country, with the exception of Wil-
</p>
<p>liam Gray, of Salem.
</p>
<p>In providing captains and other oflicers for his ships,
</p>
<p>he always gave a preference to the men of Nantucket,

<p>not only on account of their excellent seamanship, but
</p>
<p>26 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>from the force of early association, and the friendship
</p>
<p>he has ever borne the people of that island. This
</p>
<p>friendship he manifested on many occasions. During
</p>
<p>the War of 1812, intercourse with the mainland being
</p>
<p>interruj)ted and supplies cut off, the people of the
</p>
<p>island were suffering greatly for want of provisions.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker bought a fast-sailing pilot boat, sent her to
</p>
<p>Norfolk, and had her loaded with flour and despatched
</p>
<p>for Nantucket, for the relief of the suffering inhabit-
</p>
<p>ants. As the vessel neared the island, a heavy fog
</p>
<p>swept over the sea, and, on the lifting of the veil, she
</p>
<p>found herself in close vicinity to a British seventy-four,
</p>
<p>by which she was captured and the vessel and cargo
</p>
<p>were lost. His benevolent intentions were thus frus-
</p>
<p>trated, but the memory of his kindness still lives
</p>
<p>among the people. In 1825 the merchants and banks
</p>
<p>of Nantucket became greatly embarrassed. They sent
</p>
<p>a committee to New York, who, through Mr. Barker's
</p>
<p>ready and efficient aid, procured a loan of three hun-
</p>
<p>dred thousand dollars on a pledge of oil to be left on
</p>
<p>the island. He also supplied the island with steam
</p>
<p>communication, by furnishing the steamer Marco Boz-
</p>
<p>zaris to run between Nantucket and New Bedford.
</p>
<p>In the early part of his commercial career, ever on
</p>
<p>the alert for some venture promising success, and fa-
</p>
<p>miliar with the oil-trade of New Bedford and Nan-
</p>
<p>tucket, he conceived the idea of supplying the United
</p>
<p>States lighthouses with that article. It was a neces-
</p>
<p>sity, and the paymaster good. The dealers of those
</p>
<p>two marts rivalling each other in bids for the market,
</p>
<p>the oil fell to a not very compensating price. Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>mediated between his old friends, reconciled them to

<p>co-operation, and secured the agency for the supply

</p>
<p>of Government for one year. After that, they con-
</p>
<p>cluded to dispense with his services, as they had com-
</p>
<p>mand of all the oil in the country and could save his
</p>
<p>commissions. At the same time, they admonished him
</p>
<p>of the danger of risking on his own account. Not in-
</p>
<p>timidated, however, but keen-eyed and shrewd, he put in
</p>
<p>proposals quietly, and secured the contract for six suc-
</p>
<p>cessive years thereafter. The combination put their
</p>
<p>figures so high, presuming they had the control of the
</p>
<p>article, that they overshot the mark, whilst Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>confident of the arrival of other oil enough before it
</p>
<p>should be needed, slipped in his ofi'er and won the prize.
</p>
<p>A good lesson to those who are not willing to "let well
</p>
<p>enough alone," but stretch their consciences by asking
</p>
<p>exorbitant prices because Uncle Sam pays. Mr. Gal-
</p>
<p>latin, noted for his integrity and fair dealing towards
</p>
<p>his country as well as individuals, was then Secretary
</p>
<p>of the Treasury, and of course advertised for the oil.
</p>
<p>In 1806, Mr. Barker imported on consignment to him-
</p>
<p>self by a London house, for account of Robert Fulton,
</p>
<p>the first steam-engine ever used in the propulsion of
</p>
<p>vessels. For months it remained in Mr. B.'s store in
</p>
<p>South Street, Fulton, the public benefactor, being un-
</p>
<p>able to pay for it. At length it was placed in the boat
</p>
<p>intended for its reception, and Fulton first and suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully navigated the Hudson River by steam-power.
</p>
<p>Who can comprehend the emotions of the man of ge-
</p>
<p>nius, as he stood upon the deck of the little boat,
</p>
<p>watching with anxious but hopeful eye the prepara-
</p>
<p>tions for the grand experiment of his life? But the
</p>
<p>moment arrives ; at his signal, the complicated machinery
</p>
<p>begins to move, and the boat, like a thing of life, stems

<p>28 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>obedient to the forces of a mysterious and occult power
</p>
<p>almost as invisible as the beating heart of man. And
</p>
<p>as the artificial leviathan moved up the river, puffing
</p>
<p>out to the breeze its steam-flag of triumph, the people
</p>
<p>standing on its banks, who had sneered, in their incre-
</p>
<p>dulity, at the schemes of the visionary dreamer, and
</p>
<p>had come to witness their failure and laugh at his folly,
</p>
<p>were now filled w^ith amazement and loudest in their
</p>
<p>applause and congratulations. Fulton was a mighty
</p>
<p>man, and had enrolled himself on the scroll of fame.
</p>
<p>Who can estimate the present and future results of that
</p>
<p>initial experiment? In it Jacob Barker had a hand.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker was early led to the study of the laws
</p>
<p>and principles of trade, in their more comprehensive
</p>
<p>relations to the science of political economy, to trace
</p>
<p>the connections between the policy of government and
</p>
<p>the resulting conditions of commerce and finance. This,
</p>
<p>together w^ith his ardent patriotism, led him early to
</p>
<p>take an active part in politics, into which he carried all
</p>
<p>the zeal of his earnest and restless nature. He was a
</p>
<p>Democrat born and a Democrat bred. He sprung from
</p>
<p>the bosom of the sovereign masses, and had no bias or
</p>
<p>taint of aristocratic pretension or exclusiveness. His
</p>
<p>early and later associations helped to develop and foster
</p>
<p>his natural and instinctive tendencies. His father,
</p>
<p>father-in-law, and mercantile employer, Isaac Hicks,
</p>
<p>were all Democrats ; and Jacob Barker, in early man-
</p>
<p>hood, incited by the Alien and Sedition laws and the
</p>
<p>Stamp Act of John Adams, openly espoused the cause
</p>
<p>of Thomas Jefferson, and preserved his political stand-
</p>
<p>ing, although some of the measures of the President of
</p>
<p>his choice were detrimental to his private interests.

<p>The Embargo and Non-Importation Acts, so far from

<p>INTRODUCTION. 29
</p>
<p>advancing, tended to the utter ruin of his prosperity;
</p>
<p>yet he maintained and advocated them, whilst many of
</p>
<p>his fellow-Democrats united with the Federalists in a
</p>
<p>determined opposition, characterized by extreme viru-
</p>
<p>lence and abuse.
</p>
<p>On the purchase of Louisiana, he defended the course
</p>
<p>of Jefferson, denounced in the bitterest terms by the
</p>
<p>Federalists; yet who now would deny the sagacity of
</p>
<p>the distinguished statesman who recommended, and the
</p>
<p>wisdom of those who sustained, the measure? Spending
</p>
<p>an evening at the White House with Mr. Jefferson,
</p>
<p>just after the detection of Burr's conspiracy, and on
</p>
<p>the eve of the President's report of it to Congress,
</p>
<p>Blennerhassett's name naturally occurred in the con-
</p>
<p>versation, when Mr. Jefferson took occasion to express
</p>
<p>his views decidedly in favor of admitting immigrants
</p>
<p>early to the privileges of citizenship. This enlightened
</p>
<p>policy towards foreigners settling among us has always
</p>
<p>been strongly advocated by Mr. Barker; and he
</p>
<p>regarded the scheme of the so-called American Party
</p>
<p>as a libel on the American name and American prin-
</p>
<p>ciples. It has ever been our pride and our boast that
</p>
<p>America was not only the *' land of the free and the
</p>
<p>home of the brave," but the asylum of the oppressed
</p>
<p>of all nations. Tens of thousands have come at our
</p>
<p>bidding, and in exchange for the blessings of liberty
</p>
<p>and citizenship, which we have given them under our
</p>
<p>free institutions, they have filled vast unoccupied terri-
</p>
<p>tories with industrious populations, felling the forests,
</p>
<p>making the wilderness to blossom, and pouring into the
</p>
<p>channels of trade the teeming productions and golden
</p>
<p>harvests that enrich our country and increase the com-
</p>
<p>merce of the world. .Their strong arms have dug our

<p>thousands of miles of canals and built onr tens of
</p>
<p>thousands of miles of railroads, whose net-work covers
</p>
<p>the land, making a neighborhood of half a continent.
</p>
<p>They have swelled the population of our towns and
</p>
<p>cities with industrious artisans and intelligent and
</p>
<p>wealthy merchants, whose labor and capital have been
</p>
<p>a part of our common inheritance of national power.
</p>
<p>In the higher w^alks of professional life, they have
</p>
<p>furnished us with those who have adorned the bar, the
</p>
<p>bench, and the pulpit; while in literature, science, and
</p>
<p>art, the nation gratefully acknowledges her obligations
</p>
<p>to her adopted children. All these contributions from
</p>
<p>foreign lands to the moral, intellectual, and physical
</p>
<p>forces of the nation have helped to build up this
</p>
<p>mighty empire, the wonder and admiration of the world.
</p>
<p>And now, when the liberties and institutions they so
</p>
<p>much prize are threatened and imperilled by the demon
</p>
<p>of fratricidal war, they have rallied in countless num-
</p>
<p>bers to the standard of the Union ; and on every battle-
</p>
<p>field they have poured out their life-blood to attest their
</p>
<p>loyalty and show their love for their adopted country.
</p>
<p>It is a beautiful peculiarity of our institutions, that no
</p>
<p>sooner does their plastic hand touch the foreign element
</p>
<p>than it moulds it into harmony, and whatever may be
</p>
<p>discordant is wrought iiito homogeneous unity. On
</p>
<p>this subject' Mr. Barker has always inculcated the
</p>
<p>opinions of the illustrious statesman whose principles
</p>
<p>liave been the guide of his political life.
</p>
<p>When the British Orders in Council, and the Berlin
</p>
<p>and Milan Decrees of France, provoked a war on the
</p>
<p>part of the United States, Jacob Barker advocated
</p>
<p>restriction in trade, embargo, &c., instead of war,

<p>although an Administration measure. He differed with
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 31
</p>
<p>Governor Clinton, who took sides rather with the Oppo-
</p>
<p>sition; and yet, in order to conciliate Clinton to his
</p>
<p>party and retain him in the Democracy, he circulated at
</p>
<p>his own expense a thousand extra copies of a speech
</p>
<p>of Mr. Clinton's, which he thought might reconcile
</p>
<p>him to his cause. It failed, however, to have the de-
</p>
<p>sired effect, and Mr. Clinton went off under the flatter-
</p>
<p>ing attentions of the Federalists.
</p>
<p>The embargo not only prostrated the business and
</p>
<p>destroyed the prosperity of Jacob Barker and other
</p>
<p>shipping-merchants, but threw out of employment
</p>
<p>thousands of laboring men dependent on their daily toil
</p>
<p>for the sustenance of their families. Mr. Barker, having
</p>
<p>given employment to large numbers of these toiling
</p>
<p>men, whose natural affiliations were with the Demo-
</p>
<p>cracy, had acquired an influence over them so para-
</p>
<p>mount, that they would shout his praise on all occasions,
</p>
<p>and even rush, at times, to testify their esteem and
</p>
<p>confidence by bearing him on their shoulders through
</p>
<p>the streets. The anti-Administration party saw their
</p>
<p>opportunity whilst these unemployed laboring men
</p>
<p>were suffering from poverty and almost starvation from
</p>
<p>the acts of the Government, and they plied all their
</p>
<p>energies in popular addresses to the passions of the
</p>
<p>masses, and by every other appliance within the reach
</p>
<p>of an unscrupulous party, to win them over to the
</p>
<p>Federalist cause. But the untiring zeal and sharp
</p>
<p>good sense of Mr. Barker, his stirring and familiar
</p>
<p>appeals in language suited to their tastes, his un-
</p>
<p>bounded personal influence over them, growing out of
</p>
<p>his many acts of kindness, aided mainly in overpower-

</p>
<p>bound them fast to the Democratic party, to which
</p>
<p>they have ever since adhered.
</p>
<p>Indignation meetings were held by the Opposition,
</p>
<p>and inflammatory appeals were made to the populace,
</p>
<p>especially on the occasion of the killing of the captain
</p>
<p>of a schooner by a ball from a British man-of-war, near
</p>
<p>the Jersey shore, whose bleeding and mangled body,
</p>
<p>enshrouded in the national flag, was brought to the city
</p>
<p>and produced intense excitement among the people;
</p>
<p>but Jacob Barker lifted up his voice on the Battery, in
</p>
<p>the Park, and elsewhere; and wherever he appeared
</p>
<p>and addressed them, the multitude hurrahed for ''Jacob
</p>
<p>and Democracy." The "Public Advertiser," the only
</p>
<p>newspaper advocate of the restrictive system in the
</p>
<p>city, was also three times taken out of the hands of
</p>
<p>the sherifi" by Mr. Barker, at a loss to himself of three
</p>
<p>or four thousand dollars. In all these, and other
</p>
<p>ways, he manifested the strength of his devotion to the
</p>
<p>Democratic cause, as well as the determination and
</p>
<p>indomitable perseverance which characterized all his
</p>
<p>acts.
</p>
<p>The Federal party, as the opposition to Jefferson was
</p>
<p>called, was extremely bitter in its feelings and con-
</p>
<p>duct towards Mr. Barker, and spared no efl'ort to de-
</p>
<p>stroy his influence, especially with those in humble life.
</p>
<p>He had to meet their incessant artillery of stump-speech
</p>
<p>epithets, while their newspapers dealt heavy blows of de-
</p>
<p>nunciation of his every act. This but roused the daunt-
</p>
<p>less spirit within, and made him bold and fearless as a
</p>
<p>lion. The "Evening Post," the leading organ in the inte-
</p>
<p>rest of the Federalists, was so offensive that Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>on one occasion, required that paper to recant, or take the

</p>
<p>the next morning, of an article he had prepared jn
</p>
<p>reply, and which he exhibited to the conductors of the
</p>
<p>"Post." They notified him that its publication would
</p>
<p>make it necessary for Mr. Coleman, the editor, to de-
</p>
<p>mand satisfaction and a settlement on the duel-field
</p>
<p>of Hoboken. He shrank not from his purpose; the
</p>
<p>amende honorable was made in the ''Post" of that even-
</p>
<p>ing, and thenceforth Mr. Barker and Mr. Coleman were
</p>
<p>friends until the death of the latter.
</p>
<p>Jefi"erson's second term expired, and Madison became
</p>
<p>his successor in the Presidential chair. The embargo
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>had been repealed, and non-intercourse with Great
</p>
<p>Britain and her colonies substituted. This was con-
</p>
<p>tinued under Madison's administration ; but, proving
</p>
<p>ineffectual as a protection to our mercantile marine, and
</p>
<p>maritime rights, both parties aroused to a sense of the
</p>
<p>national honor,  the Federalists insisting on a war with
</p>
<p>France, the Democrats, with Jacob Barker as a warm
</p>
<p>advocate, as earnestly opposing it. The latter main-
</p>
<p>tained that France had no foreign commerce for us to
</p>
<p>assail on the ocean, while our merchant-ships would be
</p>
<p>at the mercy of privateers, and that the contest would
</p>
<p>hence be unequal; that an embargo would be all-suffi-
</p>
<p>cient-and effective; that Britain was our most formidable
</p>
<p>foe, with her naval power and commerce on the one
</p>
<p>hand, and her easy access to us by land, through her
</p>
<p>Canadian colonies, on the other. The Democracy pre-
</p>
<p>vailed, and President Madison, near the close of his
</p>
<p>first term, recommended a declaration of war against
</p>
<p>Great Britain, preceded by an embargo, enacted to be
</p>
<p>in force for ninety days.

</p>
<p>there was a split in the Democratic party of the State
</p>
<p>34 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>of New York, a majority preferring De Witt Clinton as
</p>
<p>the candidate, and among these Chief-Justice Spencer
</p>
<p>and Martin Van Buren. With them the Federalists
</p>
<p>united, despairing of electing any candidate of their
</p>
<p>own. Mr. Clinton regarded the recommended war with
</p>
<p>Great Britain as a mere party manoeuvre to secure the
</p>
<p>election of Madison ; and the leaders of his party de-
</p>
<p>manded war with France only, or, if not that, with both
</p>
<p>France and England. Notwithstanding this demand,
</p>
<p>however, and the opinion of Mr. Clinton that the
</p>
<p>question of war with Great Britain was a mere device,
</p>
<p>it was actually declared, on the 18th of June following.
</p>
<p>This led Chief-Justice Spencer to advise the with-
</p>
<p>drawal of Clinton, but, the latter refusing, their inter-
</p>
<p>course was interrupted till after the Avar, when, through
</p>
<p>the interposition of Mr. Barker, they were reconciled,
</p>
<p>and remained friends ever after.
</p>
<p>On information, by letter, from England, foreshadow-
</p>
<p>ing the speedy rescinding of the Orders in Council, Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker drew up a memorial, signed by men of the
</p>
<p>highest respectability in both political parties, headed
</p>
<p>by John Jacob Astor, asking Congress to continue the
</p>
<p>embargo and postpone the declaration of war. This
</p>
<p>memorial was presented in the Senate only the day be-
</p>
<p>fore the declaration of war, and hence was ineffectual,
</p>
<p>the party being unable to recede from their position
</p>
<p>and abandon their projected measures. Only twenty-
</p>
<p>one days after, before the news of war could reach
</p>

<p>an appeal to arms. Neither the war nor the Non-Im-
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 35
</p>
<p>portation Act was suspended, as was expected in Eng-
</p>
<p>land, on hearing of the rescission of the Orders in
</p>
<p>Council ; the President deeming their continuance ne-
</p>
<p>cessary to the settlement of other matters of difference
</p>
<p>between the two nations. Although Jacob Barker had
</p>
<p>drawn the petition for the suspension of the war move-
</p>
<p>ment in prospect of the recall of those hateful Orders
</p>
<p>in Council, yet when actual war came, no man was more
</p>
<p>prompt and cordial in rendering sympathy and aid to
</p>
<p>the Government in its time of need ; and he heartily
</p>
<p>rejoiced, with every good citizen, in the dignity, security,
</p>
<p>and power acquired by the republic in the issues of
</p>
<p>that war.
</p>
<p>The conduct of the war necessarily required large
</p>
<p>resources in money. Money is the sinew of war, and
</p>
<p>the life-blood of a nation's military powder. Without it
</p>
<p>armies can neither be mustered nor maintained, nor can
</p>
<p>navies be built or manned. And as the resources and
</p>
<p>agencies of Wall Street are essential to the execution
</p>
<p>of plans devised at the White House terminus of Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania Avenue, and as the present terrific civil war
</p>
<p>must cease in lack of the former, so in 1812, when no
</p>
<p>Wall Street existed, and the country was not only in
</p>
<p>peril but in penury, the Government was equally de-
</p>
<p>pendent on the contributions and aid of the rich. The
</p>
<p>banking institutions were then chiefly in the hands of
</p>
<p>the Federalists, who aimed at power and spoils by with-
</p>
<p>holding the means of prosecuting the war, and thus
</p>
<p>crippling the Administration. Their selfishness and love
</p>
<p>of gain, however, would hardly allow them to throw
</p>
<p>aw^ay opportunities of increasing their profits and
</p>
<p>making more money for themselves and their stock-

</p>
<p>holders. This Jacob Barker had the sagacity to see,
</p>
<p>36 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>and the ability to meet in his financial plans. The
</p>
<p>Administration was doomed, and his country in disgrace,
</p>
<p>unless the Secretary of the Treasury could command
</p>
<p>the money required for carrying on the war. There
</p>
<p>was then no green-back manufactory at the Capitol,
</p>
<p>from which to issue all the millions that might be
</p>
<p>needed. The sole dependence was on the banks. To
</p>
<p>these the Secretary applied in vain,  offering every pos-
</p>
<p>sible bonus, advertising the authorized loan, and using
</p>
<p>his own personal exertions to the utmost. Many feared
</p>
<p>the safety of the loan, not relying upon the security of
</p>
<p>the Government ; more closed their doors against the
</p>
<p>appeal from mere political views and partisan senti-
</p>
<p>ments. It seemed as if the Government would yield
</p>
<p>for want of support, and the nation bow cringing at the
</p>
<p>feet of Great Britain.
</p>
<p>These trying emergencies of the country awakened
</p>
<p>the patriotism and called out all the energies of Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker. In his counting-room, by the wayside, and on
</p>
<p>his bed, he was devising and determining the plans and
</p>
<p>processes by which he could help his country in her
</p>
<p>distress. With a thorough knowledge of the paper-
</p>
<p>money system, on which the banks relied for circulation
</p>
<p>and profits, and having large experience in commerce
</p>
<p>and finance, he resolutely undertook to raise and loan
</p>
<p>to the Government five million dollars. Although at
</p>
<p>the beginning of the war his losses on his property
</p>
<p>which was exposed at sea were very large, he yet saved
</p>
<p>enough to enable him, in March, when Mr. Gallatin
</p>
<p>advertised the sixteen-million dollar loan, to let him
</p>
<p>have twenty-five thousand dollars on his own account,
</p>
<p>whilst he also induced many friends to advance other

</p>
<p>amounts. Yet but four millions of dollars were raised
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. ^7
</p>
<p>in response to the Secretary's offer. Proposing better
</p>
<p>terms in a second advertisement, the deficiency was
</p>
<p>borrowed from Astor, Parish, and Girard of Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia.
</p>
<p>A vigorous blockade of our coast, and increased
</p>
<p>expenses of the Government, rendered a further loan
</p>
<p>necessary. This again emboldened the Opposition, who
</p>
<p>had for a time relaxed their antagonism ; but it also
</p>
<p>nerved Mr. Barker to redoubled efforts. In conference
</p>
<p>with friends of the country, many of them Federalists,
</p>
<p>he found and fostered among them a disposition to
</p>
<p>offer aid and to associate for that purpose. He there-
</p>
<p>fore opened a subscription, and, by painstaking and
</p>
<p>unwearied personal effort, secured offers to the amount
</p>
<p>of two million four hundred thousand dollars. He had
</p>
<p>urgently appealed to leading Federalists to take this
</p>
<p>agency, lest political prejudice should operate against
</p>
<p>him and the subscription, and in order, also, to shield
</p>
<p>himself from the charge of aiming only at the one-
</p>
<p>quarter of one per cent, commission,  a compensation
</p>
<p>certainly tempting on so large an amount, yet involving
</p>
<p>a service not free from onerous responsibility. Among
</p>
<p>the subscribers to the loan are found the names of
</p>
<p>prominent citizens of both political parties, of whose
</p>
<p>readiness to aid their country in its necessity their
</p>
<p>posterity may well be proud,  Barker, Rathbone, Liv-
</p>
<p>ingston, Allen, Post, Minturn, Howland, Clason, Fowler,
</p>
<p>Mumford, Costar, and others. To this loan Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>subscribed one hundred thousand dollars on his own
</p>
<p>account.
</p>
<p>With his subscription and his other arrangements to
</p>
<p>the same effect, he was prepared to offer to the treasury

<p>an additional loan of five millions of dollars. Rejoicing
</p>
<p>38 INTEODUCTION.
</p>
<p>in his success, and justly proud of his ability to reple-
</p>
<p>nish an exhausted treasury, he hastened to Washington
</p>
<p>to shoAV his patriotism and express his pleasure at this
</p>
<p>new opportunity of serving his country.
</p>
<p>On the very day of his arrival, Mr. Hanson, a mem-
</p>
<p>ber of Congress from Maryland, and reputed editor of
</p>
<p>the "Federal Republican," delivered an inflammatory
</p>
<p>speech, denouncing the Administration and declaring
</p>
<p>its utter inability to borrow the means necessary for
</p>
<p>carrying on the war ; asserting that creditors had
</p>
<p>already lost confidence, and that no capitalist or mer-
</p>
<p>chant would loan another dollar to the Government.
</p>
<p>In the evening of the same day, Mr. Barker had an
</p>
<p>interview with Messrs. Cheaves, Calhoun, and Bibb,
</p>
<p>and disclosed to them the object of his visit to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington. No one of either political party seemed to
</p>
<p>have heard of the effort in New York to raise money.
</p>
<p>The next day. Dr. Bibb replied to Mr. Hanson, making
</p>
<p>use of the statements of Mr. Barker, and so com-
</p>
<p>pletely falsified the assertions and dissolved the en-
</p>
<p>chanting views of the orator of the preceding day, that
</p>
<p>astonishment and alarm sat brooding on the brows of
</p>
<p>the Opposition. The logic of facts was irresistible ; Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker had proved the willingness of moneyed men to
</p>
<p>sustain the Administration and support the war. He at
</p>
<p>once became the object of calumny and persecution,
</p>
<p>not only in the newspapers, but by eminent men on the
</p>
<p>floor of Congress. This treatment by the Opposition
</p>
<p>served only to strengthen and fix his determination
</p>
<p>that the Administration should not fail for want of
</p>
<p>money. He repaired without delay to Mr. Sheldon,

<p>the then acting Secretary of the Treasury, and offered

</p>
<p>the loan of five millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 89
</p>
<p>During the pendency of the bill authorizing an addi-
</p>
<p>tional loan, certain statements were made in the Senate
</p>
<p>by Rufus King, of New York, charging Mr. Gallatin
</p>
<p>with appending improper conditions to the previous
</p>
<p>loan, which were kept secret between the parties. This
</p>
<p>led to an investigation by Mr. Barker, who was per-
</p>
<p>sonally interested and had induced others to become
</p>
<p>interested in that loan, which resulted in the discovery
</p>
<p>of only a very common condition of such loans, which
</p>
<p>fact, when it was made known and explained, silenced
</p>
<p>all opposition. It turned out that Mr. Sheldon had
</p>
<p>made impressions on the mind of Mr. King and others,
</p>
<p>which the facts disclosed, on investigation, did not
</p>
<p>justify. Thus were hushed for the time the boastings
</p>
<p>and denunciations of the Federalists, in and out of
</p>
<p>Congress. .
</p>
<p>Still the Government required more means as money
</p>
<p>became more scarce. Alarm spread through the com-
</p>
<p>munity, and apprehensions were everywhere felt for the
</p>
<p>safety of the State : when Mr. Barker, in concert with
</p>
<p>others, determined to make an effort for the establish-
</p>
<p>ment of a national bank, as the only feasible mode of
</p>
<p>supplying the requisite pecuniary resources to the
</p>
<p>Government.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker had been strenuous in his exertions to
</p>
<p>defeat the renewal of the charter of the old United
</p>
<p>States Bank, chiefly to gratify a feeling of personal
</p>
<p>resentment. Durino- its existence he had been emi-
</p>
<p>CD
</p>
<p>nently successful in his commercial operations, and had
</p>
<p>kept his account in the United States Branch Bank, of
</p>
<p>which Robert Lenox was the most influential director.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lenox, rightly or wrongly,  probably the latter,

<p>in case of a difficulty growing out of business transactions
</p>
<p>40 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>between Mr. Barker and a Mr. Scott, liad espoused the
</p>
<p>side of the latter, and took the responsibility of throw-
</p>
<p>ing out thenceforth, for several weeks, all Mr. Barker's
</p>
<p>paper offered for discount, and that, too, without the
</p>
<p>concurrence of several of the other directors. This,
</p>
<p>of course, seriously affected the business of Mr. Barker.
</p>
<p>The facts were made known to the mother bank at
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, and yet the directors reappointed Mr.
</p>
<p>Lenox.
</p>
<p>The charter of the United States Bank was about to
</p>
<p>expire; and this afforded Mr. Barker his opportunity.
</p>
<p>He enlisted the aid of Mr. Duane and Mr. English, in
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, and filled the columns of the "Aurora,"
</p>
<p>Mr. Duane's paper, and the "Public Advertiser," in
</p>
<p>New York, with the details of the Lenox case, and the
</p>
<p>latter paper with editorial articles tending to create
</p>
<p>a public sentiment against the bank. His personal
</p>
<p>efforts with members of Congress, also, in Washington,
</p>
<p>were persevering and ceaseless, until the rejection of
</p>
<p>the bill for renewal of the charter gave him rest from
</p>
<p>his labors, whilst his resentment cooled down to a quiet
</p>
<p>content.
</p>
<p>When, however, he now saw his country in peril from
</p>
<p>war with a mighty Power, and felt its inability to pro-
</p>
<p>vide the requisite means by appeals to private indivi-
</p>
<p>duals and State institutions, he took an active part in
</p>
<p>getting subscribers to a petition, to be presented to
</p>
<p>Congress, praying for the establishment of a national
</p>
<p>bank. He repaired to Washington, and for months
</p>
<p>together urged the memorial upon the attention of
</p>
<p>members of Congress, appealing also to the President
</p>
<p>and his cabinet, on the ground of the utter impossibility

</p>
<p>of relying upon loans. The measure, however, though
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 41
</p>
<p>proposed, failed in both Houses of Congress, the Fede-
</p>
<p>ral members generally opposing it. Abuse was natu-
</p>
<p>rally poured upon Mr. Barker and the advocates of the
</p>
<p>bank; and they were charged with intentionally hinder-
</p>
<p>ing the borrowing of money in order to secure their
</p>
<p>object. Mr. Barker contended that the renewal of
</p>
<p>the charter of the old bank and its existence then
</p>
<p>would not have removed the difficulty, because its cir-
</p>
<p>culation would have been scattered and coextensive
</p>
<p>with the country, and its money loaned to those unable
</p>
<p>to repay it during the war ; whereas a new national
</p>
<p>bank could have converted the entire issues to govern-
</p>
<p>mental uses.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of March, 1814, Congress authorized a
</p>
<p>loan of twenty -five millions of dollars, which was adver-
</p>
<p>tised to be closed on the 2d of May following. By
</p>
<p>publications, personal interviews, and otherwise, Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker endeavored to convince the heads of depart-
</p>
<p>ments and influential members of Congress that it
</p>
<p>would be impossible to borrow more than one-third of
</p>
<p>that sum, and that some other provision must be made
</p>
<p>in order to procure the necessary funds and save
</p>
<p>the country from ruin. Yet Congress adjourned with-
</p>
<p>out doing any thing further. Mr. Barker offered for
</p>
<p>five millions of dollars, one-half the sum then adver-
</p>
<p>tised for bids. No one believed that amount would be
</p>
<p>taken, and the Federalists, of course, rejoiced in that
</p>
<p>prevalent opinion, from selfish considerations; striving
</p>
<p>to spread it abroad, as also to justify it by withholding
</p>
<p>their co-operation. Mr. Barker's off'er was dependent
</p>
<p>on conditions, especially that funded stock should be
</p>
<p>issued to the creditors of the Government under this
</p>
<p>loan, and that banks furnishing the money should be

<p>favored with a certain portion of the financial business
</p>
<p>of the Government ; and that the holders should have
</p>
<p>the benefit of any more favorable terms that might be
</p>
<p>extended to subsequent takers of the loan. - These terms,
</p>
<p>though long combated, were at length accepted, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker was ready with the first instalment at the
</p>
<p>proper time. The Secretary, on his part, however, was
</p>
<p>not ready, and endeavored to vary the terms. This,
</p>
<p>of necessity, involved Mr. Barker in great difficulty
</p>
<p>with those of whom he had borrowed, and to whom he
</p>
<p>had given the pledges of the Government, and sub-
</p>
<p>jected him to abuse and obloquy, from which the
</p>
<p>Administration should rather have shielded him ; for no
</p>
<p>man of that day exhibited the same determination to
</p>
<p>save untarnished the fair fame of his country, nor like
</p>
<p>perseverance in filling her treasury with the means
</p>
<p>necessary to preserve her credit and her honor.
</p>
<p>Almost every possible obstacle was thrown in his
</p>
<p>way by interested parties, especially by the Chief Clerk
</p>
<p>and acting Secretary of the Treasury, acting, probably,
</p>
<p>in the interest of the Opposition. Scrip was substituted
</p>
<p>for stock, stock was issued without appended conditions,
</p>
<p>the issues were postj^oned and not ready to be delivered
</p>
<p>at the proper time, facilities promised to loaning banks
</p>
<p>were withheld, so as to compel him to sacrifice his own
</p>
<p>stock in order to meet the payments. Still he perse-
</p>
<p>vered, determined at all hazards that his country should
</p>
<p>have the means of carrying on the war and of coming
</p>
<p>out of it with victory and glory. Nevertheless, he was
</p>
<p>hunted and persecuted and maltreated by the Secre-
</p>
<p>, tary of the Treasury and his subordinates, in a manner

</p>
<p>and to an extent that any but the stoutest heart would
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 43
</p>
<p>have failed, any but the strongest arm would have been
</p>
<p>unnerved.
</p>
<p>Had the promised conditions been fulfilled, Jacob
</p>
<p>Barker had made such arrangements as would have
</p>
<p>enabled him to furnish the Government with all the
</p>
<p>means necessary for the entire conduct of the war.
</p>
<p>But when pledges given him by the Secretary, on the
</p>
<p>faith of which banks had agreed to loan him large
</p>
<p>amounts, were broken,  when the stipulated condition
</p>
<p>was withheld from the face of the stock, patronage,
</p>
<p>promised, not given to the banks,  when vexatious de-
</p>
<p>lays and disappointments dispirited those ready to aid
</p>
<p>with their means,  when the stock was depreciated by
</p>
<p>this vacillating policy and this want of good faith, and
</p>
<p>withholding the supplementary stock,  who could expect
</p>
<p>the six-million dollar loan to succeed ? And it did
</p>
<p>not.
</p>
<p>A national bank was now considered the only alter-
</p>
<p>native, and Mr. Barker directed his energies and finan-
</p>
<p>cial skill towards its establishment. He drew up a
</p>
<p>23lan of his own, and earnestly recommended New York
</p>
<p>as the proper locality for such an institution ; but Mr.
</p>
<p>Dallas, a Philadelphian, having succeeded to the ofiice
</p>
<p>of Secretary of the Treasury, a plan was matured by
</p>
<p>him and reported to Congress to establish a national
</p>
<p>bank and to locate it at Philadelphia. In conse-
</p>
<p>quence of news of peace having been received. Con-
</p>
<p>gress adjourned under the excitements of the hour, and
</p>
<p>just on the eve of the passage of the bill. At the

<p>following session of Congress, however, a United States
</p>
<p>Bank was established. Had the bill passed at the pre-
</p>
<p>vious session, it would have rewarded Mr. Barker

</p>
<p>abundantly, as it gave a preference of stock to holders
</p>
<p>44 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>of war loans, which stock would have advanced in
</p>
<p>value, probably, one hundred per cent. But now, in-
</p>
<p>stead of these advantages, he was obliged to sacrifice
</p>
<p>the stock he had pledged, at a very low rate, as security
</p>
<p>to those who had loaned money, and insisted on its
</p>
<p>return, that they mighf invest in the stock of the new
</p>
<p>bank and get the benefit of the expected rise in value.
</p>
<p>That cry of peace, therefore, which resounded through
</p>
<p>the halls of Congress and defeated the passage of the
</p>
<p>bank-bill the previous year, made a probable difference
</p>
<p>in the fortune of Mr. Barker of two millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>Thus again and again did the billows roll over him,
</p>
<p>sweeping away his bright hopes of success. That
</p>
<p>which had seemed a substantial reality proved but a
</p>
<p>phantom. Yet, never borne down or discouraged, he
</p>
<p>prosecuted with renewed vigor his business in New
</p>
<p>York, and resumed that in Liverpool, and also esta-
</p>
<p>blished the Exchange Bank in Wall Street.
</p>
<p>During this time, too, he was busily engaged in en-
</p>
<p>deavors to secure justice at the hands of the Government
</p>
<p>for the injuries done him in not recognizing the ce-
</p>
<p>lebrated "condition" in the loans he had made; but
</p>
<p>in vain. In these efforts, however, by a persistent and
</p>
<p>intelligent presentation of the truth and justice of
</p>
<p>his claims, he generally succeeded in gaining his point
</p>
<p>with the Administration ; for, however the Secretary of
</p>
<p>the Treasury might be disposed to look too exclusively
</p>
<p>to the interests of Grovernment against the rights of
</p>
<p>the creditors, whenever the matter was submitted to
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General, a fair review of it called forth
</p>
<p>an interpretation of the law and the ''condition" in
</p>
<p>favor of Mr. Barker. After exhausting his efforts with

<p>from Congress. The Judiciary Committee, to whom

<p>ing with what cheerful patriotism Mr. Jacob Barker gave
</p>
<p>his energies, his eminent financial talents, and his great
</p>
<p>pecuniary means, to sustain his country in the darkest
</p>
<p>and most perilous hour of the War of 1812, it can
</p>
<p>hardly be supposed that Congress will deny him the
</p>
<p>privilege of establishing, if he can, a clearly legal
</p>
<p>demand, arising out of a recorded contract which,
</p>
<p>while it benefited the Government, resulted in his own
</p>
<p>ruin."
</p>
<p>To show the spirit in which Mr. Barker labored to
</p>
<p>serve his country, we here insert an incident that oc-
</p>
<p>curred at the time. An esteemed friend and relative
</p>
<p>of Mr. Barker, but opposed to the war, remonstrated
</p>
<p>with him against the imprudence and risk of taking
</p>
<p>these war loans, and, among other things, said, "Jacob,
</p>
<p>the Government itself may be so embarrassed with
</p>
<p>this ruinous and expensive war that it will not be able
</p>
<p>to pay, and fail or break down before the war is ended."
</p>
<p>To which he replied, "If Government fails, I am will-
</p>
<p>ing to fail with it. Property and every thing else are
</p>
<p>of little or no consequence compared to the success of
</p>
<p>my country. I am willing to risk every thing I have for
</p>
<p>her." These were the utterances of his full heart,
</p>
<p>made in the privacy of his own home, but afterwards
</p>
<p>made public through those who heard them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker's claim, however, has never yet been
</p>
<p>allowed, and may never be. Still, he has pressed it
</p>
<p>through all the tortuous windings of official resistance,

<p>sent hour. And before the latter tribunal, where he
</p>
<p>has stood alone in its advocacy, the efforts of the old
</p>
<p>man of fourscore stand as a monument of skill, power,
</p>
<p>and perseverance without a parallel in our history. In
</p>
<p>all this he now seeks the awards of justice, not so much
</p>
<p>for their pecuniary value, but because they w*ould
</p>
<p>furnish a public recognition of his services on the part
</p>
<p>of his country, and thus gratify the proudest wish of
</p>
<p>his heart. The righteous judgment of posterity, as far
</p>
<p>as it may look into the case, will allow the validity of
</p>
<p>his claim, and of his arguments in support of it; while
</p>
<p>none can fail to admire his noble patriotism, and his
</p>
<p>unequalled aid to his country, amounting almost to its
</p>
<p>salvation. But so it is, that the best friends of the
</p>
<p>republic, the purest patriots, are too often rewarded
</p>
<p>with neglect and injustice.
</p>
<p>Whilst those who, in the present war, furnish aid to
</p>
<p>the Administration, favored though they be by abound-
</p>
<p>ins: wealth and the facilities of contracts and other
</p>
<p>means created by the war itself, are lauded and honored
</p>
<p>as patriots of the first water, what praise is due to him
</p>
<p>who, when money was scarce, banks were few, opposition
</p>
<p>strong, enemies bitter, friends few, gave of his own
</p>
<p>means, and by the most persevering efforts induced
</p>
<p>others to loan to the Government?  and when, too, but
</p>
<p>for the money furnished by him, the war must have
</p>
<p>flagged, England must have been triumphant, America
</p>
<p>must have bowed submissively and licked the dust be-
</p>
<p>fore the might of her conquering foe. Jacob Barker
</p>
<p>should be remembered as long as the "War of 1812 is
</p>
<p>remembered, and his name should be inscribed on the
</p>
<p>escutcheon of his country as one of her noblest sons

</p>
<p>His monetary transactions with the Government had
</p>
<p>led him to a deeper study of the principles, as well as
</p>
<p>the practical ' working, of finance and credit. And
</p>
<p>while still carrying on an immense outside business,
</p>
<p>he was, through the Exchange Bank and his large
</p>
<p>speculations in stocks, fast reaching the point to which
</p>
<p>his genius, and perhaps his ambition, pointed, of be-
</p>
<p>coming the chief regulator of the monetary affairs of
</p>
<p>the country. This success stimulated the jealousy of
</p>
<p>his enemies.
</p>
<p>His private bank was strenuously opposed in Wall
</p>
<p>Street. A suit was brouo;ht ao;ainst him for violation
</p>
<p>of the Restraining Act, which resulted in his favor.
</p>
<p>Alarm was created about his circulation and deposits,
</p>
<p>but these wer^ quieted by the promptness with which
</p>
<p>he met every demand ; yet a law was passed extending
</p>
<p>the restraining law to individuals as well as associations.
</p>
<p>This, together with the opposition to his banking busi-
</p>
<p>ness and the failure of his Liverpool house, the latter
</p>
<p>resulting from unfortunate business-complications caused
</p>
<p>by his partner there, overthrew his bank. Depositors,
</p>
<p>however, were paid, and his entire circulation redeemed.
</p>
<p>An illustration is found in a story told by Grant
</p>
<p>Thorburn, who says, after the failure of Mr. Barker's
</p>
<p>bank, a poor widow having a ten-dollar bill of this
</p>
<p>bank in her hands, came into his store, crying and
</p>
<p>making a great ado. He informed Mr. Barker, whom
</p>
<p>he knew well, of the fact, and he instantly cashed the
</p>
<p>bill and relieved the widow, as Mr. Thorburn says,
</p>
<p>"like an honest man."
</p>
<p>After the failure of the Exchano-e Bank, he availed
</p>
<p>himself of the use of many chartered institutions in

<p>operations, was supposed to have tlie control of un-
</p>
<p>limited capital.
</p>
<p>Although an active politician, he had never been am-
</p>
<p>bitious for office or sought political distinction. Yield-
</p>
<p>ing, however, to the wishes of his friends, he was
</p>
<p>elected by a large majority to the State Senate. In
</p>
<p>the discharge of his senatorial duties he displayed the
</p>
<p>same qualities that characterized him everywhere.
</p>
<p>Bold, fearless, and independent, and with a high sense
</p>
<p>of his responsibility, he did not fail to justify the fore-
</p>
<p>sight of those who had made him their representative.
</p>
<p>As Senator, under the usage then existing, he was
</p>
<p>counsellor to the Governor on appointments to office in
</p>
<p>his district. He unavoidably gave offence to many,
</p>
<p>who solicited, but did not obtain, his recommendation.
</p>
<p>A member of the Court of Errors also, as then con-
</p>
<p>stituted, he differed in opinion with Chancellor Kent
</p>
<p>in an insurance case. They were the only opinions re-
</p>
<p>ported in the case. ^'The chancellor contended that,
</p>
<p>if the master intended to deviate from the voyage as
</p>
<p>stated in the policy, the insurance was forfeited; and
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker, that forfeiture should only follow upon
</p>
<p>actual deviation." The court sustained Mr. Barker's
</p>
<p>opinion by a vote of 15 to 8 ; and this decision has
</p>
<p>been a law on the subject, in England, France, and
</p>
<p>America, ever since. Mr. Barker differed with his
</p>
<p>fellow-members of the Senate in regard to some points
</p>
<p>in the duelling-law then passed; and it is not a little
</p>
<p>singular that he was the first, and probably the only,
</p>
<p>person who ever felt its penalty. It was subsequently,
</p>
<p>however, amended in conformity to his original views.
</p>
<p>The questions of banks and canals were then domi-

</p>
<p>the banks, as a condition of their charters, and favoring
</p>
<p>the Erie Canal, always ascribing the honor of it to
</p>
<p>De Witt Clinton.
</p>
<p>At his own expense, Mr. Barker established the
</p>
<p>" Union" newspaper in New York, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>advocating the re-election of Governor Clinton. Mr.
</p>
<p>Crawford was at this time the prominent candidate for
</p>
<p>the Presidency, with General Jackson, Mr. Clay, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Adams. General Jackson's friends were unwilling
</p>
<p>to drop him for Mr. Crawford, as Mr. B. advised, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Crawford's supporters equally unwilling to desert
</p>
<p>him: so the question went to Congress, and Adams was
</p>
<p>elected. At a public meeting subsequently held in
</p>
<p>New York, presided over by Mr. Barker, General Jack-
</p>
<p>son was nominated for the Presidency, with Chief-Jus-
</p>
<p>tice Spencer for the Vice-Presidency. Mr. Van Buren
</p>
<p>with his friends cordially came into this arrangement,
</p>
<p>and Jackson was elected. The subjects of the currency
</p>
<p>and the United States Bank were now strongly exciting
</p>
<p>the public mind ; and in such questions a man like
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker could not but take a deep interest. He pre-
</p>
<p>pared and submitted to President Jackson a plan for a
</p>
<p>national bank, which the latter promised to sign should
</p>
<p>it pass into a law by the sanction of his leading friends
</p>
<p>in Congress. The pet-bank system, however, was sub-
</p>
<p>stituted for the United States Bank, and its failure
</p>
<p>called out the celebrated Specie Circular.
</p>
<p>We will now go back and glance at a few other
</p>
<p>events that occurred in the life of Mr. Barker, just
</p>
<p>antecedent to the trials which constitute the special
</p>
<p>subject of the present volume.

</p>
<p>whose incunilbent directors had paid for much of it with
</p>
<p>money borrowed from the bank itself. The new stock-
</p>
<p>holders designed to supersede them by men of their
</p>
<p>own choice, but failed through the conduct of packed
</p>
<p>inspectors of election, who declared the incumbents
</p>
<p>elected. This election was, however, set aside by the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court. One of these directors, a Mr. Rogers,
</p>
<p>was very abusive, and, as Mr. Barker thought, grossly
</p>
<p>insulted him. Mr. Barker demanded "the reparation
</p>
<p>due from one gentleman to another," and expected,
</p>
<p>through a friend, to obtain it by a suitable acknowledg-
</p>
<p>ment and amicable settlement; but, instead, he found
</p>
<p>himself prosecuted for sending a challenge in violation
</p>
<p>of statute. The cause was tried, and he convicted ; the
</p>
<p>jury having resolved, contrary to all right and to the
</p>
<p>spirit and intention of jury trials, that the verdict should
</p>
<p>be ''guilty," or "not guilty," according as three-fourths
</p>
<p>of their number voted. He pleaded his own cause, and
</p>
<p>asked for a new trial, chiefly on the ground of the
</p>
<p>illegal procedure of the jury and the unconstitution-
</p>
<p>ality of the law against duelling. But the court decided
</p>
<p>against him, and he was subjected to the disabilities of
</p>
<p>the law. These were, however, removed by Governor
</p>
<p>Clinton; and his restoration to citizenship called forth
</p>
<p>the congratulations of his friends.
</p>
<p>The failure of the Life and Fire Insurance Com-
</p>
<p>pany and other incorporations in New York now
</p>
<p>involved Mr. Barker in the most serious and painful
</p>
<p>difficulty of his life, and one which called for the dis-
</p>
<p>play of those high qualities of energy, promptitude, and
</p>
<p>sagacity which he possessed in so eminent a degree.

<p>directors. The communitj, embracing all classes who
</p>
<p>had suffered by these failures, were highly excited and
</p>
<p>exasperated, and the consequence was that criminal
</p>
<p>prosecutions were commenced against the supposed
</p>
<p>authors of these calamities, and indictments were found
</p>
<p>bj the Grand Jury. In these first proceedings Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker was not included. But his enemies, taking ad-
</p>
<p>vantage of his connection, directly or indirectly, with
</p>
<p>many of the institutions referred to, conspired to pro-
</p>
<p>cure his downfall and his ruin. The opportunity was
</p>
<p>rare and tempting, and the combined and powerful
</p>
<p>influence of the moneyed aristocracy and his old poli-
</p>
<p>tical enemies, led on by Hugh Maxwell, the Prosecuting
</p>
<p>Attorney, made-him the chief object of prosecution and
</p>
<p>persecution, and, by a trick and injustice, succeeded in
</p>
<p>including him in a second indictment obtained from the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury.
</p>
<p>This brings us up to the period included in the dis-
</p>
<p>closures forming the sj)ecial subject of the present
</p>
<p>volume, w^hich we leave to speak for themselves and
</p>
<p>tell their own story to the reader. These Conspiracy

</p>
<p>method of their inception, the manner and circum-
</p>
<p>stances connected with their prosecution, and their final
</p>
<p>results, constitute one of the most remarkable events in
</p>
<p>the judicial history of the country. It is a strange and
</p>
<p>stai'tling spectacle to behold a citizen, high in position
</p>
<p>and influence, struggling in the toils of an unrighteous

<p>combination, dragged before the tribunals, and, upon

<p>lend themselves as tlie instruments of injustice and wrong.
</p>
<p>But who can fail to admire the perseverance and manly
</p>
<p>bearing of him who, conscious of innocence and strong
</p>
<p>in his belief of ultimate justice and the triumph of
</p>
<p>truth, stood forth boldly in his own defence, and pleaded
</p>
<p>his own cause at the bar of the law,  and put it in so clear
</p>
<p>and strong a light as to call forth the admiration of the
</p>
<p>ablest lawyers and the sanction of some of the highest
</p>
<p>and purest judges in the State ? The verdict of the
</p>
<p>present generation, and of posterity, will doubtless be
</p>
<p>in his favor. In closing our allusions to these trials,
</p>
<p>we will here take occasion to correct a prevalent but
</p>
<p>erroneous opinion in respect to Mr. Barker's connec-
</p>
<p>tion with certain of those rotten institutions. He had
</p>
<p>nothing whatever to do with the Marble Manufacturing
</p>
<p>Company, Hudson Bank of Jersey City, Jefferson
</p>
<p>Insurance Company, nor with the managenient of the
</p>
<p>Eranklin Bank, and he had no dealings with Malapar
</p>
<p>& Pride,  all of which are attributed to him by the
</p>
<p>author of a work lately published, entitled "The Old
</p>
<p>Merchants of New York." These errors are but a
</p>
<p>specimen of the many misrepresentations which have
</p>
<p>from time to time been published concerning Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, both in reference to the Conspiracy Trials and
</p>
<p>to other events of his life, which not only justify the
</p>
<p>present publication, but would seem to call for a full
</p>
<p>history of the life of a man whose name is so often

<p>found in the public prints.

<p>now the further losses and embarrassments caused by

<p>INTRODUCTION. 53
</p>
<p>the Conspiracy Trials, had reduced Mr. Barker from
</p>
<p>the pinnacle of financial power to a state of compara-
</p>
<p>tively moderate means. Once he had employed some
</p>
<p>twenty clerks in his banking and other business,  many
</p>
<p>of whom, profiting by his example and teachings, have
</p>
<p>since risen to leading positions in financial and com-
</p>
<p>mercial circles. Now his bank was gone, and his
</p>
<p>other business was contracted within narrow limits.
</p>
<p>His spirit, his talent, his health, remained, and he
</p>
<p>cowered not before the dark dealings of Providence.
</p>
<p>Subsequently to these Conspiracy Trials, some mort-
</p>
<p>gages on Louisiana plantations, received by the Life
</p>
<p>and Fire Insurance Company, led him to New Orleans,
</p>
<p>which he made his home and where he has ever since
</p>
<p>resided. Here we might turn a new leaf and inscribe
</p>
<p>a new history in the life of Mr. Barker. But such an
</p>
<p>attempt would be a departure from the original purpose
</p>
<p>of this Introduction. That pleasing task, in its inte-
</p>
<p>resting details, must be left to his biographer. Yet it
</p>
<p>would be too abrupt a termination of these sketches,
</p>
<p>and might disappoint the expectation of the reader, if
</p>
<p>we should stop here, with no mention whatever of the
</p>
<p>subsequent passages in his life, extending over a period
</p>
<p>of time equal to the ordinary business-life of most
</p>
<p>men. What a wonderful instance of preserved and
</p>
<p>recuperative energy, to see a man who had lived more
</p>
<p>than half a century of incessant toil, having achieved
</p>
<p>the highest results of successful enterprise, when
</p>
<p>stricken down by misfortune, rally again, and in a new
</p>
<p>field, by thirty years of renewed labor, regain and
</p>
<p>maintain his lost position ! Such has been the life of
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker in New Orleans.

</p>
<p>gone only for the purpose of looking after the mort-
</p>
<p>gages referred to above, he was admitted by the
</p>
<p>judge to appear, ex gratia^ in the United States Dis-
</p>
<p>trict Court, as counsel in the argument in the suits
</p>
<p>brought on these mortgages. This privilege, however,
</p>
<p>was withdrawn, and, the suits being put over, Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker set himself to work to prepare for admission to
</p>
<p>the bar, in order to be able to manage these cases. He
</p>
<p>w^as rejected on his first examination; but, nothing
</p>
<p>daunted, he renewed his studies with double diligence,
</p>
<p>and very soon presented himself to the Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>and, after a second examination, was admitted to the
</p>
<p>bar. In the departments of commercial and maritime
</p>
<p>law, to which he specially devoted his attention, he held
</p>
<p>a high place among the most distinguished members of
</p>
<p>the profession.
</p>
<p>But, not liking the restraints of court practice and
</p>
<p>the petty competitions of litigation, he abandoned the
</p>
<p>regular practice of the law, and entered into other pur-
</p>
<p>suits, more congenial to his tastes and earlier habits.
</p>
<p>New Orleans, as the great mart of Southern trade and
</p>
<p>commerce, presented a rich field for enterprise and
</p>
<p>adventure ; and Mr. Barker, with his large experience
</p>
<p>and all the forces of his restless nature, soon identified
</p>
<p>himself with its mercantile and financial business and
</p>
<p>progress. There, too, he has always taken an active
</p>
<p>part in politics, and through the press and on the
</p>
<p>rostrum he has caused his opinions to be heard and
</p>
<p>felt. He has ever adhered to the well-considered poli-
</p>
<p>tical opinions of his earlier life, and, while he has never
</p>
<p>yielded himself to the promotion of mere party ends,
</p>
<p>few men have contributed more to the formation of a

<p>INTRODUCTION. 55
</p>
<p>On the Slavery question he inherited the opinions
</p>
<p>and feelings of the Quakers, from whom he sprung.
</p>
<p>And his practical efforts for the benefit of the colored
</p>
<p>race among us, eminently entitle him to the character
</p>
<p>of a philanthropist. While he has always regarded
</p>
<p>slavery as an evil, he has ever looked upon the schemes
</p>
<p>of the Abolitionists of the North as dangerous to the
</p>
<p>harmony and union of the States and injurious to the
</p>
<p>best interests of the slaves. He has considered all
</p>
<p>plans for the amelioration of the condition of the slaves
</p>
<p>as wrong which were not in harmony with the laws
</p>
<p>regulating the institution, and the compromises of the
</p>
<p>Constitution, which guaranteed to the slave-holding
</p>
<p>States the exclusive right to regulate and control the
</p>
<p>subject in their own way. On the question of the capa-
</p>
<p>city of the blacks for the higher w^alks and avocations
</p>
<p>of life, he has made many and very interesting experi-
</p>
<p>ments since he has been a resident of the South. He
</p>
<p>has sent colored youths both to Europe and to the
</p>
<p>North, with a view to educate and fit them for com-
</p>
<p>mercial and other occupations in the South, but with
</p>
<p>very little hopeful result. He has also, as a planter,
</p>
<p>experimented w^ith free foreign white labor at the
</p>
<p>South, having sent one of his vessels to Europe and
</p>
<p>brought over a number of Germans for that purpose ;
</p>
<p>but the result in this case was such as to compel him to
</p>
<p>abandon all hope of substituting that kind of labor for
</p>
<p>that of blacks, on any thing like a large scale, in the
</p>
<p>present state of things in regard to labor in that region.

<p>the world. We have presented to view his sterner

<p>and earnest worker in the great human hive. But
</p>
<p>56 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>there is anotlier aspect of his character, as exhibited
</p>
<p>in social life. No one was ever more warm-hearted
</p>
<p>and genial ; and his personal friendship, when once be-
</p>
<p>stowed, could only be lost by the unworthiness of its
</p>
<p>* object. This friendship expressed itself, not in sen-
</p>
<p>timent alone, but by substantial proofs, whenever occa-
</p>
<p>sion offered. Were we permitted to lift the veil from
</p>
<p>off the sanctuary of home, and show Mr. Barker in the
</p>
<p>midst of his family, he would there be seen in those
</p>
<p>lights and shades which bring out in strongest outline
</p>
<p>the mdst winning and attractive features of his cha-
</p>
<p>racter. There he has not only sought repose and
</p>
<p>relaxation from his many cares and labors, but, as the
</p>
<p>central orb, shed light and happiness upon all. Nor
</p>
<p>were his sympathies and influence restricted to his
</p>
<p>household and the members of his immediate family.
</p>
<p>His feelings took a wider range, and the welfare of all
</p>
<p>who bore his name or in whose veins was found his
</p>
<p>ancestral blood has always been the object of his solici-
</p>
<p>tude and care. But these portraitures of his domestic
</p>
<p>and social life must be painted on a broader canvas
</p>
<p>than the limits of these sketches will afford.
</p>
<p>At the outbreak of the present civil war, Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>expressed his fears for the safety of the Constitution
</p>
<p>and the Union. He was born before they were formed,
</p>
<p>and has lived through all their history, contributing
</p>
<p>largely to their maintenance, and illustrating in his life
</p>
<p>and fortunes their beneficence and value. With un-
</p>
<p>tiring and anxious vigilance he has watched the progress
</p>
<p>of events, and with voice and pen has given his coun-
</p>
<p>sels to his countrymen. He threw himself boldly into
</p>
<p>the breach; but neither the voice of age nor the warn-

</p>
<p>ings of patriotism could stay the fatal tide of rebellion.
</p>
<p>INTEODUCTION. 57
</p>
<p>He lias differed in opinion with the Administration in the
</p>
<p>radical measures adopted for suppressing the rebellion,
</p>
<p>believing them to be in violation of the Constitution
</p>
<p>and subversive of the rights and sovereignty of the
</p>
<p>States, and annulling those constitutional guarantees
</p>
<p>without which the Union would never have been formed,
</p>
<p>and to the observance of which the good faith and
</p>
<p>honor of the nation are sacredly pledged. These opi-
</p>
<p>nions he has freely and boldly expressed; and in order
</p>
<p>to diffuse them more widely, and to reproduce, for the
</p>
<p>public benefit, his political opinions published at an
</p>
<p>earlier period, he started and edited the "National
</p>
<p>Advocate," the publication of which was several times
</p>
<p>suspended by military authority. At length, not being
</p>
<p>willing to submit to the annoyance of a military censor-
</p>
<p>ship, he stopped its publication. But he still holds to
</p>
<p>his opinions, and stands fast by his loyalty to the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution and the Union.
</p>
<p>It is a pleasing reflection, with which we close these
</p>
<p>brief sketches, that Jacob Barker now, as he approaches
</p>
<p>the close of a long, active, and eventful life, is found in
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of comfort and prosperity, and to know
</p>
<p>that without that justice which should have been done
</p>
<p>him by the Government of the United States, which of
</p>
<p>itself would have given him an ample competency, he
</p>
<p>has been enabled to recover his fortunes, and gladden
</p>
<p>his own heart and the hearts of his friends by the pos-
</p>
<p>session of every means of tranquillity and happiness.
</p>
<p>As a type and representative of a class which has
</p>
<p>sprung from the bosom of our great commercial com-
</p>
<p>munities, those who, while they determine and control
</p>
<p>the operations of trade and finance, at the same time

<p>58 INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>politics, as well as the general progress of society,
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker never had his equal in America. An
</p>
<p>analysis of his mental and moral constitution, as ex-
</p>
<p>hibited in the ordinary affairs of life, and especially in
</p>
<p>more trying and difficult emergencies, would show a
</p>
<p>wonderful balance and harmony of faculties and powers,
</p>
<p>not, however, unaccompanied by occasional eccentrici-
</p>
<p>ties, caused by the preponderance of a controlling self-
</p>
<p>will. Unselfish and self-reliant, he often suffered loss
</p>
<p>and defeat of his plans by a too hasty expression of his
</p>
<p>convictions, and in reliance upon his own schemes in
</p>
<p>matters where ordinary men would have sought success
</p>
<p>through associated and organized efforts. His quickness
</p>
<p>of perception and soundness of judgment, combined with
</p>
<p>his impatience and impulsiveness of character, some-
</p>
<p>times caused him to rely upon his own powers alone,
</p>
<p>and move in advance and independently of that organ-
</p>
<p>ized co-operation which in certain cases is necessary to
</p>
<p>make success attainable. But it was this independence,
</p>
<p>clearness of judgment, and evident unselfishness of
</p>
<p>purpose, which gave his opinions so much weight with
</p>
<p>such men as Madison, Hamilton, Clinton, and others
</p>
<p>of high distinction. His mental powers were backed
</p>
<p>up and sustained by the highest physical courage,  a
</p>
<p>quality essential to true greatness in all the active con-
</p>
<p>cerns of life. In trying emergencies, where men of
</p>
<p>mere intellect often fail, he had the facility to command
</p>
<p>and make available, on the instant, all his powers and
</p>
<p>resources ; and with an impassive self-possession which
</p>
<p>nothing could disturb, and a clear-sighted comprehension
</p>
<p>of the difficulties to be overcome, he could meet and
</p>
<p>master the occasion. Readiness, promptness, and energy

</p>
<p>of character have marked every important act of his life.
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. 59
</p>
<p>While his plans, whether of business or otherwise, have
</p>
<p>been characterized by breadth of scope and general
</p>
<p>purpose, they have been wrought out and developed
</p>
<p>with the most studied regard to minuteness of detail.
</p>
<p>It was in thus combining the synthetic with the analytic,
</p>
<p>in the elaboration of his plans, that he eminently ex-
</p>
<p>celled. He had the rare facility of attending to many
</p>
<p>important things at the same time; and, while each
</p>
<p>separately seemed to engross his full powers, all were
</p>
<p>equally cared for. He was endowed with a physical
</p>
<p>organization and possessed a strength of constitution
</p>
<p>which gave him vast power of endurance and enabled
</p>
<p>him to perform an immense amount of intellectual labor.
</p>
<p>By habits strictly temperate, and abstinence from all
</p>
<p>wasting indulgences, he has preserved the vigor of his
</p>
<p>health and his strength of intellect up to the present
</p>
<p>time. And now, in the eighty-fifth year of his age,
</p>
<p>still erect, with a beaming eye and a bland expression,
</p>
<p>he stands at the post of duty and of labor. Such a
</p>
<p>man as Jacob Barker will never cease from labor, or
</p>
<p>desire rest, till he finds it in the final resting-place of
</p>
<p>all.
</p>
<p>With such powers and faculties, Jacob Barker would
</p>
<p>have distinguished himself in any business or profession.
</p>
<p>He was eminently fitted for the part he has borne in
</p>
<p>life. He has made his mark on the times in which he
</p>
<p>lived. His memory will live in the time to come.

<p>A CHAPTER
</p>
<p>IN THE
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BAEKER.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>IXSURANCE-COMPANIES.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jacob Barker commenced his career under tlib
</p>
<p>administration of John Adams, took an active part in
</p>
<p>the election of Thomas Jefferson, and in opposition to
</p>
<p>the Alien and Sedition law.
</p>
<p>At this time there were but few banks at New York.
</p>
<p>Their influence was so great that it was very difficult to
</p>
<p>procure bank-charters. Their directors, and nearly all
</p>
<p>the men engaged in foreign commerce, espoused the cause
</p>
<p>of the Federalists. Mr. Barker's energy, activity, and
</p>
<p>influence among the mechanics and laborers, very many
</p>
<p>of whom were employed in and about his numerous
</p>
<p>ships, invoked the hostility of what was then considered
</p>
<p>the British party, insomuch that he found it very diffi-
</p>
<p>cult to obtain bank-facilities. This determined him to
</p>
<p>establish a free bank in Wall Street. This institution
</p>
<p>was bitterly opposed by the said party. Notwithstand-
</p>
<p>ing their newspaper and town-meeting opposition, it
</p>
<p>succeeded well, when they brought a suit against him,
</p>
<p>alleging that the operations of his bank were in oppo-
</p>
<p>sition to the provisions of the restraining bill, which
</p>
<p>subjected it to a long and tedious litigation, which re-

</p>
<p>suited in establishing his right to bank without a
</p>
<p>charter.
</p>
<p>The next move was to send men to the legislature
</p>
<p>who would get a law passed inhibiting it,  in which they
</p>
<p>succeeded ; and, although he was compelled to wind up
</p>
<p>the concerns of this bank, his opponents had to yield
</p>
<p>what they considered their prerogative to confer bank-
</p>
<p>facilities on their favorites with impunity. The idea
</p>
<p>of free banking had taken such deep root that a perfect
</p>
<p>system was finally legalized. In consequence, there
</p>
<p>are now more than fifty banks in the city of New York.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker having to seek new occupation, and con-
</p>
<p>sidering that guaranteeing the payment of debts for
</p>
<p>merchandise sold promised great profits, he organized
</p>
<p>the Mercantile Insurance Company of New York, under
</p>
<p>the management of a wealthy set of directors, for con-
</p>
<p>ducting that business, issuing bonds payable at distant
</p>
<p>periods in exchange for commercial paper and other
</p>
<p>securities, receiving compensation therefor, always dis-
</p>
<p>counting such bonds at seven per cent, per annum,
</p>
<p>which greatly facilitated the vendors on long credit in
</p>
<p>converting their merchandise into money.
</p>
<p>This business succeeded well, furnishing capital as
</p>
<p>well as profit ; and so prudently and skilfully was the
</p>
<p>business managed, that the bonds of this company
</p>
<p>always commanded the money in Wall Street at or
</p>
<p>under seven per cent, per annum,  the lawful interest
</p>
<p>of New York.
</p>
<p>Henry Eckford, Esq., one of the directors of the said
</p>
<p>company, was so well pleased with the operation of this
</p>
<p>new business, that he informed Mr. Barker that if he
</p>
<p>had not any objection he would resign as such director

</p>
<p>and establish an institution to do the same description
</p>

</p>
<p>of business. Mr. Barker's reply was, that he could
</p>
<p>not object to his doing what every other man had a
</p>
<p>right to do.
</p>
<p>Application was made to the legislature, and an act of
</p>
<p>incorporation granted, entitled Life and Fire Insurance
</p>
<p>Company. The parties interested in this business were
</p>
<p>not allowed for any length of time to monopolize what
</p>
<p>was generally considered to be a very profitable busi-
</p>
<p>ness. Many other companies sprung into existence,
</p>
<p>intrusted to the management of incompetent men, flood-
</p>
<p>ing the market with bonds, without capital to meet them
</p>
<p>in the event of defalcation in the payment of the notes
</p>
<p>and other securities received in exchange for the bonds
</p>
<p>issued. The consequence was, a great depreciation in
</p>
<p>the market-price of the bonds. Mr. Barker, with the
</p>
<p>consent of the directors with whom he was associated,
</p>
<p>set about retiring the bonds of the three companies with
</p>
<p>which he was connected, investing their spare funds in
</p>
<p>life and fire bonds, for the payment of which Mr. Eck-
</p>
<p>ford gave them written guarantees.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>NORTH RIVER BANK.
</p>
<p>While this business of the insurance-companies was
</p>
<p>progressing, a number of wealthy citizens purchased,
</p>
<p>through Mr. Barker, a majority of the stock of the
</p>
<p>North River bank. This alarmed the directors very

</p>
<p>notes. One of tlie number,  David Rogers,  in the
</p>
<p>hope of prejudicing Mr. Barker with his associates and
</p>
<p>breaking up the opposition, took occasion to insult him
</p>
<p>on the Exchange so grossly that he felt called on to
</p>
<p>leave without a word of reply, immediately writing and
</p>
<p>delivering to him a letter in words following : 
</p>
<p>'' New York, January 29, 1822.
</p>
<p>"Sir:  You having without the least provocation
</p>
<p>grossly injured me, you are hereby required to make
</p>
<p>such reparation as is due from^ one gentleman to an-
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>" The friend that I expected to deliver this being ab-
</p>
<p>sent for the day, he will call on you to-morrow, or very
</p>
<p>soon thereafter, for your answer, &c.
</p>
<p>"Your obedient servant,
</p>
<p>"Jacob Barker.
</p>
<p>"Mr. David Rogers."
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker was under an en2^a2:ement to dine with a
</p>
<p>friend in company with a number of gentlemen, several
</p>
<p>of whom, including the host, were present at the Ex-
</p>
<p>change when Rogers made the assault. At the dinner-
</p>
<p>table the host said, "Jacob, we were much disappointed
</p>
<p>at the tame manner you submitted to the grave insult
</p>
<p>of Mr. Rogers."
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker's reply was, "On sudden emergencies the
</p>
<p>mind is not always prepared to do the best thing."

<p>CHIEF-JUSTICE SPENCER'S OPINION.
</p>
<p>The election of directors of tlie i!^ortli River Bank
</p>
<p>came on. Inspectors were appointed to sustain the sit-

<p>ting memb-ers. To make sure of this, one of their mem-

<p>bers resigned and was appointed inspector, the farce of
</p>
<p>an election was gone through, and the sitting members
</p>
<p>declared to have been re-elected. These proceedings

<p>were set aside bj the Supreme Oourt, which rendered a

</p>
<p>6Q LIFE OF JACOB BARKEE.
</p>
<p>*' On Friday Chief- Justice Spencer, delivered the
</p>
<p>opinion of the court, to the following efi'ect : 
</p>
<p>'''These applications being generally found on the
</p>
<p>ex parte affidavit of the relators, it has of late years,
</p>
<p>been usual in the English court of King's Bench and
</p>
<p>in this court to afford the defendant an opportunity of
</p>
<p>being heard against granting leave to file the informa-
</p>
<p>tion. A rule to show cause is, therefore, generally en-
</p>
<p>tered, and leave is afterwards granted or refused, as
</p>
<p>circumstances shall appear upon the cause shown. In
</p>
<p>the present case the application is for leave to file the
</p>
<p>information in the first instance. There is no doubt
</p>
<p>that the court are bound to exercise a reasonable dis-
</p>
<p>cretion on the subject; and this cause comes before us
</p>
<p>in a manner so peculiar, that w^e think it proper to
</p>
<p>except it from the general rule. The application does
</p>
<p>not rest upon a mere ex p?'fe affidavit. The evidence
</p>
<p>placed in our hands comes from the defendants them-
</p>
<p>selves, or from a source most favorable to them. Wo
</p>
<p>have the sworn answers of the defendants to a bill in
</p>
<p>chancery, filed in relation to the very election com-
</p>
<p>plained of. We have also the answers of the inspectors
</p>
<p>of that election. Upon a rule to show cause, nothing
</p>
<p>could be alleged by the defendants against granting
</p>
<p>leave to file the information which is not already urged,
</p>
<p>on their part, in the papers presented to the court.
</p>
<p>We have looked into the answers, and we find the de-
</p>
<p>fendants and the inspectors admitting a state of facts
</p>
<p>which not only render it proper to grant leave as ap-
</p>
<p>plied for, but which seem to us imperiously to require it
</p>
<p>at our hands. To give time, under such circumstances,
</p>
<p>would be an abuse of the discretion vested in this court.

</p>
<p>We will briefly advert to a part of the case as admitted
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 67
</p>
<p>by the defendants and inspectors. A controversy ex-
</p>
<p>isted among the stockholders of the bank, a portion of
</p>
<p>whom were desirous to effect a change in the direction.
</p>
<p>A few days before the election, a by-law was passed by
</p>
<p>the board of directors, of which board most of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants were members and then present, authorizing
</p>
<p>any stockholder to cheJlenge the votes offered at the
</p>
<p>election, and, if supported by affidavits or other pro-
</p>
<p>bable cause, to the satisfaction of the inspectors, that
</p>
<p>they might then require the person whose vote should
</p>
<p>be challenged to make, on oath, answer to the cause of
</p>
<p>challenge, the sufficiency of which should be determined
</p>
<p>by the inspectors ; and if such oath was refused, that
</p>
<p>the vote should be rejected. Under this by-law, votes
</p>
<p>given upon the proxies of several persons who appeared,
</p>
<p>from the books of the bank and the certificates of the
</p>
<p>cashier, as stockholders to a large amount, were chal-
</p>
<p>lenged on the ground that the persons in whose names
</p>
<p>the stock stood, and who held the certificates of the
</p>
<p>bank, were not the exclusive owners, but that some
</p>
<p>third person or persons had an equitable interest therein.
</p>
<p>This was considered by the inspectors as good cause of
</p>
<p>challenge ; and the persons whose proxies were thus ob-
</p>
<p>jected to were required, notwithstanding the most urgent
</p>
<p>remonstrance to the contrary, to make affidavits in wai-
</p>
<p>ting, in answer to these allegations, and to answ^er, under
</p>
<p>an oath prescribed by men who did not themselves act

<p>by the inspectors. It is evident, from the answers, that
</p>
<p>if all the votes received into the hands of the inspectors,
</p>
<p>from persons duly authorized to give such votes, had
</p>
<p>been estimated by the inspectors, that the result would
</p>

</p>
<p>"'Without entering any further, at this time,' say the
</p>

<p>opinion that the by-law and the proceedings under it at

<p>the election were most illegal and reprehensible. The

<p>be entitled to one vote on each share of the stock of the

<p>bank which he shall have held in his own name at the

<p>last fourteen days previous to the time of the voting.
</p>
<p>[Sess. 4:4c, cJi. 146,  8.) Further than this the inspectors
</p>
<p>had no right to inquire, as it was not competent for the
</p>
<p>directors to pass any by-law at variance with the positive
</p>
<p>provisions of the act incorporating the bank. We there-

</p>
<p>such explanations as Mr. Barker could consistently be
</p>
<p>satisfied with,  offering, at the same time, to furnish
</p>
<p>such information as would satisfy Mr. Rogers that he
</p>
<p>was totally mistaken in the opinions he had expressed, 
</p>
<p>when Mr. Rogers declared his willingness to see Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker on the subject, which, being proposed to him,
</p>
<p>he promptly agreed to see Mr. Rogers in the presence
</p>
<p>of Mr. Wells and a friend on the part of Mr. Rogers,
</p>
<p>but objected to seeing him alone; whereupon Mr. Wells
</p>
<p>wrote the following letter, which was delivered to Mr.
</p>
<p>Rogers on the evening of its- date : 
</p>
<p>" January 30, 1822.
</p>
<p>"Dear Sir:  I have seen Mr. Barker, who begs that
</p>
<p>you would name as early a time and place as possible at
</p>
<p>which he can see you, in presence of myself and a friend
</p>
<p>on your part, that he may have an opportunity of making
</p>
<p>the fullest explanation of his affairs. I have a private
</p>
<p>ofl&ce in my house (35 Murray street), which is entirely
</p>
<p>to your service, or you may appoint any other place.
</p>
<p>"I am, respectfully, your humble servant,
</p>
<p>"John Wells.
</p>
<p>"Mr. David Rogers."
</p>
<p>On the morning of the 31st January Mr. Seely called
</p>
<p>on Mr. Wells in behalf of Mr. Rogers, and by his con-
</p>
<p>versation evinced an indisposition to the proposed inter-
</p>
<p>view and explanations, and left Mr. Wells, observing
</p>
<p>that he might hear from him again in the course of one
</p>
<p>or two days. Nothing further being heard from him on
</p>
<p>that or the next day, Mr. Wells delivered to Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>the correspondence, saying nothing was likely to result

<p>from his interference. On the evening of that day Mr.

<p>" Sir :  Will you be pleased to send me hj the bearer,

<p>mj friend, William H. Allen, a written answer to my
</p>
<p>note of 29tli ultimo ?
</p>
<p>"Your obedient servant,
</p>
<p>"Jacob Barker.
</p>
<p>"Mr. David Eogers."
</p>
<p>This letter was delivered by Lieutenant Allen to Mr.
</p>
<p>Rogers, with the pressing demand of a categorical
</p>
<p>answer, w^hich was evaded by the plea that the affair
</p>
<p>was in the hands of Messrs. Wells and Seely, where-
</p>
<p>upon Mr. Wells wrote the following letter: 
</p>
<p>** February 5, 1822.
</p>
<p>"When I saw you last week (Thursday) on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of Mr. Rogers and Mr. Barker, on leaving me you
</p>
<p>said that you would see me again in a day or two : not

<p>having since heard from you, or seen you, I consider

<p>the business at an end as regards my agency in it.
</p>
<p>"Very respectfully, your humble servant,

</p>
<p>In place of affording the required satisfaction, com-
</p>
<p>plaint was made to the grand jury, before whom Mr.
</p>
<p>Rogers testified that Mr. Barker had challenged him to
</p>
<p>fight a duel, whereupon they indicted him for such an
</p>
<p>offence.
</p>
<p>The papers the following morning announced the
</p>

<p>MR. barker's speech  THE TRIAL FOR HAVING SENT A
</p>
<p>CHALLENGE.
</p>
<p>The trial of the alleged offence against the duelling-
</p>
<p>law came on, when David Rogers testified that he had
</p>
<p>not ever dealt with Mr. Barker; that, until the North
</p>
<p>River Bank affair, their acquaintance was so slight that
</p>
<p>they did not, in passing, recognize each other: that the
</p>
<p>remarks he made to Mr. B. on the Exchange, of which
</p>
<p>Mr. B. complained, detailing them, were from informa-
</p>
<p>tion derived from others; that Mr. B. left the room
</p>
<p>without saying a word; that in an hour thereafter he
</p>
<p>handed him the letter of the 29th January; that when
</p>
<p>he received it he considered it a challenge to fight a
</p>
<p>duel. Mr. Wells called upon him the following day ;
</p>
<p>that he considered him the person alluded to in Mr. B.'s
</p>
<p>letter; that their negotiations were of a pacific charac-
</p>
<p>ter; that Mr. Seely had, at his request, conferred with
</p>
<p>Mr. Wells on the subject, without any satisfactory result ;
</p>
<p>that he received the letter of Mr. B., of the 1st Febru-
</p>
<p>ary, from Lieutenant William H. Allen; that he had
</p>
<p>testified before the grand jury that he was sojyry to have
</p>
<p>been obliged to state the affair to them, that he told the

</p>
<p>Mr. Wells, a witness on the part of the prosecution,
</p>
<p>testified:  That on the occasion Mr. Barker called on
</p>
<p>him his feelings appeared to be strongly excited, and
</p>
<p>detailed the occurrence at the coffee-house; having, in
</p>
<p>the course of professional duty, had an opportunity of
</p>
<p>knowing the affairs of defendant- for several years, be-
</p>
<p>lieved that an amicable arrangement might be made if
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker had an opportunity of explaining his affairs
</p>
<p>to Mr. Rogers ; witness, with Mr. Barker's consent and
</p>
<p>concurrence, called on Mr. Rogers on the 30th January ;
</p>
<p>had a conversation with him, and requested of him to see
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker and hear an explanation of his affairs, and
</p>
<p>told him that Mr. B. had been injured by what had
</p>
<p>occurred at the coffee-house, and explained to him his
</p>
<p>views, saying that from the character the witness had
</p>
<p>ever understood that he (R.) sustained, he was led to
</p>
<p>believe, that if he was convinced that Mr. B. was really
</p>
<p>injured by any remarks he had made, he would not
</p>
<p>hesitate to say so, or words to that effect ; to which Mr.
</p>
<p>Rogers assented, or said certainly, promising to send a
</p>
<p>friend to confer with him. Mr. Seely called upon witness
</p>
<p>in behalf of Mr. Rogers ; they had some conversation and
</p>
<p>correspondence, from which no satisfactory result being
</p>
<p>probable, Mr. B. was notified thereof, and the corre-
</p>
<p>spondence delivered to him; that the part he took in
</p>
<p>the affair was wholly of a pacific nature. Witness
</p>
<p>added, in reference to the Exchange Bank notes, that,
</p>
<p>from his knowledge of the defendant and his business,
</p>
<p>the money would be paid for them, if Mr. Barker had
</p>
<p>it, as freely as the rain had ever fallen from the
</p>
<p>heavens. ^

<p>friends of Mr. Barker, in the expectation of establish-

</p>
<p>ing from his confidential conversations what he meant
</p>
<p>Mr. Rogers should understand from those letters.
</p>
<p>M. M. Noah, a witness for the prosecution, stated
</p>
<p>that defendant had called on him to publish the corre-
</p>
<p>spondence, which he had declined.
</p>
<p>James Orum, also a witness for the prosecution, stated
</p>
<p>that he had printed the pamphlet in evidence at the
</p>
<p>request of the defendant, but not a word was elicited
</p>
<p>from any witness going to show that Mr. Barker had
</p>
<p>undertaken to interpret his letters as meaning a
</p>
<p>challenge.
</p>
<p>The cause was ably summed up by Thomas Addis
</p>
<p>Emmit and Joseph Ogden Hoffman, Esqs., on the part
</p>
<p>of the defendant, and by Messrs, Maxwell, Benner, and
</p>
<p>Price, on the part of the prosecution, and given to the
</p>
<p>jury, who, on retiring, agreed that a vote should be
</p>
<p>taken and a verdict rendered "guilty" or "not guilty,"
</p>
<p>according as three-fourths of the twelve jurors should
</p>
<p>decide. The vote resulting against the defendant, the
</p>
<p>yerdict was rendered in accordance therewith.

<p>On the hearing of the motion for a new trial, he ap-

<p>peared without counsel and reviewed the whole case

</p>
<p>trine of jur j-trial, substituting the will of a portion for
</p>
<p>that of a unanimous vote.
</p>
<p>The recorder remarked, "Had this been proven by
</p>
<p>legal testimony, we have no hesitation in saying that
</p>
<p>the objection would be fatal. You brought the decla-
</p>
<p>rations of jurors to prove that the jury agreed that if
</p>
<p>nine of the panel should unite in a verdict the other
</p>
<p>three should fall in and find with them. Such conduct
</p>
<p>would, undoubtedly, be reprehensible, and this court
</p>
<p>takes this occasion to say that nothing would be more
</p>
<p>alarming than for our jurors to adopt such a method of
</p>
<p>making their verdicts. You have only the proof vrhich
</p>
<p>some of the jury themselves gave ; and it is a well-settled
</p>
<p>point that a juryman cannot be heard to disparage^ his
</p>
<p>own verdict."
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker responded; "My objections to the con-
</p>
<p>duct of the jury being overruled by your honor, I shall
</p>
<p>not press that matter further than to say, that when
</p>
<p>judgment shall be passed, I do hope the irregularity
</p>
<p>will not escape unnoticed ; that there may not, at least,
</p>
<p>be a recurrence of a practice fraught with such incalcu-
</p>
<p>lable mischief, and which must impress with awe every
</p>
<p>member of a community whose life, honor, liberty, or
</p>
<p>fortune may, in its turn, become the sport of chance.
</p>
<p>"I will proceed to show that the verdict was not
</p>
<p>supported by the evidence ; the charge of offence against
</p>
<p>the common law not having been sustained by legal
</p>
<p>proof, and so ruled by your honor. I shall devote my
</p>
<p>attention more particularly to the law of the State,
</p>
<p>which I consider to be unconstitutional, and to some of
</p>
<p>the remarks of the opposing counsel."
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker handled those gentlemen with great

</p>
<p>freedom, seeming to consider the threatened disfran-
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 75
</p>
<p>cliisement but a small penalty for the pleasure of the
</p>
<p>battle. He insisted that the damages to be awarded
</p>
<p>were to be measured by the provocation; hence all
</p>
<p>things relating thereto were fit subjects for inquiry.
</p>
<p>He referred to the language of Rogers, as sworn to
</p>
<p>by himself; his ignorance as to the matter spoken of;
</p>
<p>his refusal to hear testimony and to make the required
</p>
<p>explanations, and to the continued injurious course of
</p>
<p>the directors of the North River Bank, as described by
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court when they annulled the illegal
</p>
<p>election, and proceeded thus :
</p>
<p>^'The guilty words are, doubtless, 'My friend will
</p>
<p>call to-morrow,' and on the morrow Mr. Wells did call.
</p>
<p>How then can it be doubted that he was the friend
</p>
<p>alluded to? Still they insist he was not the man
</p>
<p>alluded to and again I ask them, what proaf they have
</p>
<p>of that? Mr. Wells on his examination said that if
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker meant that letter as a challenge, and the
</p>
<p>friend mentioned in it as a second, I could not have
</p>
<p>meant him, because I never said one word to him about
</p>
<p>fighting or challenging, or any thing more than the desire
</p>
<p>of an amicable explanation.
</p>
<p>"I felt, and do feel, the weight of my obligations to
</p>
<p>Mr. Wells, and that my whole life would not repay the
</p>
<p>friendship of such a man ; and I most solemnly declare
</p>
<p>that I never considered Mr. Wells in any other light
</p>
<p>than as a peacemaker, and that if I ever had an in-
</p>
<p>tention of dealing out justice with my own hand to Mr.
</p>
<p>Rogers, Mr. Wells was never thought of as a party to
</p>
<p>such a purpose. He has testified; his life and charac-
</p>
<p>ter speak volumes for the truth of what he utters, and
</p>
<p>because he says he never heard a word of fighting

</p>
<p>or of challenging, it must be that I sent some other
</p>
<p>76 LIFE OF JACOB BARKEK.
</p>
<p>friend to cliallenge, and that must be Lieutenant Allen,
</p>
<p>because I employed him to bear a harmless note and
</p>
<p>bring me a written answer. Now, I put it to the court
</p>
<p>to say whether this is putting a fair construction on the
</p>
<p>testimony, or whether it is not the fairer and more
</p>
<p>rational inference that Mr. Wells was the friend alluded
</p>
<p>to in my note of the 29th January, and that my only
</p>
<p>object was of a pacific character.
</p>
<p>"In affairs of honor, to be sure, it is a point of honor
</p>
<p>to keep the secret, and the gentlemen have said that I
</p>
<p>have exercised my accustomed sagacity in doing so. I
</p>
<p>certainly kept the secret, if there was one to be kept,
</p>
<p>with such marked fidelity that the gentlemen have not
</p>
<p>been able to find a human being who had the most dis-
</p>
<p>tant hint of it, although they spread their net wide
</p>
<p>indeed, sweeping my friends and associates at random
</p>
<p>into court, to give evidence touching my conversations ;
</p>
<p>but it was not in their power to extract a word of chal-
</p>
<p>lenging from all the circle of my friends and acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance, with all their diligence, which went so far that I
</p>
<p>wonder they had not called upon Mrs. Barker and her
</p>
<p>daughter, and other inmates of my house, to detail the
</p>
<p>conversation of the tea-table, &c. Therefore, I do think
</p>
<p>this will be awarded to me, unless it should be believed
</p>
<p>that there was not any secret to keep; and I confess
</p>
<p>that is the natural inference, and particularly so, as
</p>
<p>applicable to a person so fond of talking as everybody
</p>
<p>who knows Jacob Barker knows him to be. This is all
</p>
<p>well. Let no guilty man escape. I am content. But
</p>
<p>if the district attorney had been as active in doing his
</p>
<p>duty against others as he has against me, against whom
</p>
<p>he has done it nobly indeed, and vigorously, there might

</p>
<p>tain it is, that others have sent, carried, and accepted
</p>
<p>challenges, ha^ve fouo;ht duels, and some have killed
</p>
<p>their neighbors.
</p>
<p>''Mr. Allen was not called upon to testify: perhaps
</p>
<p>that might be from the apprehension that he might
</p>
<p>refuse to answer in crimination of himself, in which case,
</p>
<p>it is true, he would be protected by the law. But the
</p>
<p>question was asked, who is this William H. Allen?
</p>
<p>And this question was to make it appear that he was a
</p>
<p>lieutenant in the navy. I will now inform the gentle-
</p>
<p>men further, Mr. Allen is a lieutenant in the navy of
</p>
<p>the United States. He was second officer on board the
</p>
<p>Argus when the London editors accused her of having
</p>
<p>set the whole Irish Sea on fire; when at Lloyd's in-
</p>
<p>surance could not be made across the Irish Channel from
</p>
<p>Liverpool to Dublin under ten guineas per cent., not-
</p>
<p>withstanding the thousand British ships of war that
</p>
<p>covered all the seas; and when his commander and
</p>
<p>namesake was killed, and his superior officer wounded
</p>
<p>and taken below, he fought the Argus against the
</p>
<p>Pelican, a ship of double her force, for twenty minutes,
</p>
<p>until the wounds of the first officer were dressed, and
</p>
<p>he came again on deck, and ordered his flag to be
</p>
<p>lowered to save the further effusion of blood. The
</p>
<p>gentlemen now know all about Lieutenant Allen, and, if
</p>
<p>they can use this information to their advantage, they
</p>
<p>are welcome to it; and I very much doubt if they can
</p>
<p>give so good an account of themselves during the war.
</p>
<p>"If the letter of the 29th January had been a chal-
</p>

<p>guilty; whether he was or was not the friend alluded
</p>
<p>to in my letter of the 29th, can have no bearing on the
</p>
<p>question, and especially as it was not proved that he
</p>
<p>delivered any challenge whatsoever. But the first letter,
</p>
<p>they say, was the challenge, and the friend intended in
</p>
<p>that letter was Lieutenant Allen. '^
</p>
<p>"The district attorney opened this cause by saying
</p>
<p>that I had offended against the laws of God and man ;
</p>
<p>that I had a family ; that I owed something to the com-
</p>
<p>munity, and for that should be made to suffer ; and some
</p>
<p>spoke of my wife and children, and therefore that I
</p>
<p>should answer to the commmunity. It was the first
</p>
<p>time I had heard of a man's being punished for having
</p>
<p>a wife and children, though I had often heard it urged
</p>
<p>in mitigation of his sentence. I have, it is true, a wife
</p>
<p>whose bosom is replete with every virtue that dignifies
</p>
<p>the human character, and I have nine lovely children,
</p>
<p>just bursting upon the world in pursuit of honor, fame,
</p>
<p>and happiness; and may my heart cease to palpitate
</p>
<p>when it ceases to feel for them ! My honor is their
</p>
<p>honor ; and may my tongue cease to articulate, and my
</p>
<p>arm be unnerved, when they cease to vindicate the
</p>
<p>honor of such a family as God has given me to watch
</p>
<p>over and protect! But I do not come to ask for them
</p>
<p>the sympathy of this court, nor do I know why they
</p>
<p>have been mentioned in this cause. I equally disclaim
</p>
<p>being held guilty or innocent the more or the less
</p>
<p>because I have a family. Not one of my family, whilst
</p>
<p>one drop of their parent's blood thrills through their
</p>
<p>veins, would stoop to accept, much less solicit, men's
</p>
<p>compassion. Fallen as our fortunes are, our spirits
</p>
<p>remain unbroken. I cannot, perhaps, prevent their
</p>
<p>mourning over my misfortunes, but I can assure them

</p>
<p>action of mj life. They may regret that my enter-
</p>
<p>prises have not been crowned with more success, but
</p>
<p>they shall never have cause to be ashamed of me. It is
</p>
<p>true, also, that I owe much to the community, a part of
</p>
<p>w^hich is to oppose my feeble voice against all attempts
</p>
<p>to invade its laws and constitution : that debt I am this
</p>
<p>moment paying to the very best of my abilities.
</p>
<p>"I have been charged with ambition, and I acknow-
</p>
<p>ledge the weaknesses that belong to frail man. My
</p>
<p>greatest ambition is to hold fast by my rights, and on
</p>
<p>all occasions to defend them. Of the fame of having
</p>
<p>sent a challenge I am not, certainly, ambitious. No
</p>
<p>man holds a professed duellist in more contempt than I
</p>
<p>do. I wish it were not necessary, or held so in any
</p>
<p>case, not even in that most cogent of all exigencies, the
</p>
<p>vindication of a lady's honor. But public opinion has
</p>
<p>willed it otherwise, and I cannot help it, as I do not
</p>
<p>make public opinion, however much I may be under the
</p>
<p>painful necessity of yielding to it: we are all slaves.
</p>
<p>''One of the counsel thought I deserved to be con-
</p>
<p>victed for not having come out in the public prints and
</p>
<p>denied all intention to challenge Mr. Rogers, that he
</p>
<p>might have been spared the scoifs and sneers and ridi-
</p>
<p>cule of the world, and that the boys and girls, the
</p>
<p>young, the middle-aged, and the old, might not consider
</p>
<p>him as an object placed through life 'for the hand of
</p>
<p>scorn to point its slow unerring finger at.'
</p>
<p>"And did he think his employer entitled to this
</p>
<p>kindness from me after he had heard his evidence ? I
</p>
<p>cannot bring my mind to agree that such w^s my duty.

</p>
<p>me. Certainly he had no solid ground for a conviction,
</p>
<p>or he would not have seized with such avidity on so
</p>
<p>flimsy a pretext.
</p>
<p>'^ I shall now examine the circumstances of aggravated
</p>
<p>provocation under which I was placed. This cannot but
</p>
<p>be a fit subject of inquiry, if the penalty be in the dis-
</p>
<p>cretion of the court.
</p>
<p>"Your honors will recollect the time, place, and
</p>
<p>extent of the insult offered to me. I had in my pocket
</p>
<p>at that time an anonymous letter, which had been sent
</p>
<p>to my father-in-law through the post-ofiice, full of the
</p>
<p>same calumny, applied to me by name. [Here the de-
</p>
<p>fendant produced a letter, bat the reading of it was
</p>
<p>objected to, and he withdrew it.] Many of my friends
</p>
<p>have received similar letters, which we believed to have
</p>
<p>proceeded from the same source. And w^as I tamely to
</p>
<p>submit to these gross wrongs ? Was I to hear all and to
</p>
<p>say nothing ? And when I sent an honorable friend to
</p>
<p>demand some explanation, must I be punished? And,
</p>
<p>if considered culpable, will all this provocation go for
</p>
<p>nothing? Was my domestic peace to be invaded with
</p>
<p>impunity? Was my aged father-in-law, in the evening
</p>
<p>of life, to be harassed and disturbed on my account?
</p>
<p>Were these attempts to interrupt the confidence and
</p>
<p>affection of my own family to be repeated by these
</p>
<p>men, and I not allowed to use my feeble voice, my
</p>
<p>pen, my skill, nor to make any effort in defence of all
</p>
<p>that renders life desirable, or even supportable ? Forbid
</p>
<p>it, my fellow-citizens ! forbid it, this honorable court !
</p>
<p>forbid it, heaven !

</p>
<p>legal bearing on the case was that he gravely insulted

</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 81
</p>
<p>Ml
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>delivered to liim by myself one hour after the insult,
</p>
<p>and at tlie distance of one mile from the place where
</p>
<p>the insult was given; that Mr. Wells called on him the
</p>
<p>day following the date of that letter ; that he considered
</p>
<p>Mr. Wells the friend alluded to therein ; that Mr.
</p>
<p>Wells's conversation was entirely of a pacific character,
</p>
<p>and that my letter of the 1st of February was delivered
</p>
<p>to him by Lieutenant Allen. This, considering that I
</p>
<p>had to write a letter, look for a friend, find him out of
</p>
<p>town, write another letter, and seek him at so great a
</p>
<p>distance, was tolerably prompt,  perhaps not so much so
</p>
<p>as the insult merited.
</p>
<p>"The gentlemen have accused me of too much confi-
</p>
<p>dence. I have ahvays felt great confidence in the posi-
</p>
<p>tions I supported, and I have seen no cause to change
</p>
<p>my opinions ; and if I have succeeded in expressing the
</p>
<p>extent of the confidence I feel, I have at least been
</p>
<p>successful in one thing.
</p>
<p>" One of the grounds they urge for my conviction is
</p>
<p>my want of gravity. A very slight ground for conviction
</p>
<p>this. I do not know how to be very grave ; it is not in
</p>
<p>my nature to be so ; and, even under the accumulation
</p>
<p>of injury done me, I cannot but smile at their despera-
</p>
<p>tion every time I think of their pretended election for
</p>
<p>directors of the North River Bank the present week,
</p>
<p>by which I have been greatly injured in a pecuniary
</p>
<p>point of view. Yet I cannot be grave when talking to
</p>
<p>my friends on the subject. From this censure I wish
</p>
<p>to exempt Mr. Jay. . I consider him a gentleman, and
</p>
<p>a man of honor. He was not at the board when the
</p>
<p>illegal by-law was passed; and when he heard how

</p>
<p>his proxy; it having been used early in the morning, he
</p>
<p>was unfortunately too late.
</p>
<p>"They think I ought not to succeed, because the
</p>
<p>learned gentlemen who honored me with their aid on a
</p>
<p>former occasion did not urge at the trial the objections
</p>
<p>I have urged, and because they are not now by my side,
</p>
<p>supporting with their legal reputation and eloquence
</p>
<p>those principles for which I contend with so much zeal
</p>
<p>and confidence. They say that if they had not totally
</p>
<p>objected to risk their legal reputation in so desperate a
</p>
<p>cause, I should have had them here on this occasion, as
</p>
<p>I possess abundance of means of paying them. Now,
</p>
<p>in all this they are totally mistaken. I am not able to
</p>
<p>pay them, and I could not consent to tax their liberality
</p>
<p>further, by putting in requisition such transcendent
</p>
<p>talents, which they are now exerting in another part of
</p>
<p>this house, and for which they will receive that pecu-
</p>
<p>niary compensation they so richly merit, and which 
</p>
<p>being their profession  is their dependence for the
</p>
<p>support and fortune of their families, and I will not
</p>
<p>disguise that I felt competent to the task I have under-
</p>
<p>taken. I have not paid them one cent for the very
</p>
<p>able assistance they rendered me on the trial ; but I
</p>
<p>had on former occasions, when fortune smiled more
</p>
<p>kindly on me, employed them, and paid them too, and
</p>
<p>they, true to their well-known characters, did not hesi-
</p>
<p>tate to come forward in aid of an old friend, without
</p>
<p>stopping to inquire whether they would be paid or not;
</p>
<p>and, so far from their doubting the soundness of the objec-
</p>
<p>tions I have urged, one of them  Mr. Hoffman  told
</p>
<p>me that there could be no question as to the point of
</p>

<p>being abrogated by the new constitution. And I un-
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 83
</p>
<p>derstood Mr. Emmet to express the same opinion ; but
</p>
<p>I do not advance that with the same confidence, because
</p>
<p>my conversation with him was more general.
</p>
<p>"There can be no question but what the test oath
</p>
<p>was unconstitutional, and that it was abrogated by the
</p>
<p>new constitution ; the gentlemen say that the latter did
</p>
<p>not take efi"ect until December next ; every thing re-
</p>
<p>lating to the franchise of the citizen took effect in
</p>
<p>March last, and I insist that disqualifying an individual
</p>
<p>from holding office under the State relates directly to
</p>
<p>his franchise; they also insist that the test oath only
</p>
<p>was abrogated, and not the whole law; I insist that
</p>
<p>when the vital part of any law is abolished the whole
</p>
<p>falls.
</p>
<p>" To enable the court to decide whether the statute
</p>
<p>be made in the spirit of the constitution, or against it,
</p>
<p>it will be necessary to know its true character ; and, to
</p>
<p>ascertain this, we must look into its origin, birth, or
</p>
<p>first being.
</p>
<p>"When before this honorable court, on a former
</p>
<p>occasion, I read the journals of the Senate, showing the
</p>
<p>law to be founded upon a petition from the Rev. Dr.
</p>
<p>Milledoller, and several other reverend gentlemen ; one
</p>
<p>of whom, if not more, devoted at least a month to
</p>
<p>travelling through the State to collect signatures to the
</p>
<p>said petition. In respect for these reverend men I will
</p>
<p>not yield to any one. I visit their churches ; I listen to
</p>
<p>their eloquence from the pulpit with attention ; I hear
</p>
<p>them expound the divine law with delight ; I hear them

<p>exhort their fellow-beings to forsake their sins and
</p>
<p>become the disciples of Christ, with pleasing emotions
</p>
<p>which I lack words to express; and when they crave

</p>
<p>84 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>forgiveness, my heart is filled with reverence, and with
</p>
<p>them I crave from on high divine illumination. But,
</p>
<p>when I see them overleap their jDrescribed bounds by
</p>
<p>meddling with our political institutions, I turn from
</p>
<p>them with alarm and concern. And if I shall here be
</p>
<p>enabled to demonstrate to the satisfaction of this court
</p>
<p>the true character of this law, I think it will prove a
</p>
<p>wholesome admonition to these reverend gentlemen to
</p>
<p>confine their future labors to softening the heart and
</p>
<p>convincing the understanding."
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker insisted that if the law had not been abro-
</p>
<p>gated it was unconstitutional ; he opposed it on that
</p>
<p>ground as a member of the Senatorial Committee, again
</p>
<p>in the Senate, from which body the bill went to the council
</p>
<p>of revision, where, after a sharp conflict, it was sustained
</p>
<p>by a vote of four to three, and proceeded as follovrs : 
</p>
<p>"Chancellor Kent delivered a very able opinion in
</p>
<p>opposition, and when the subject was brought before the
</p>
<p>convention Mr. Jay observed 'that he had originally
</p>
<p>introduced this law; that he drafted the law; and,
</p>
<p>though it was altered in its passage through the house,
</p>
<p>he voted for it. It went to the council of revision,
</p>
<p>which was said to be divided. But I feel ready to con-
</p>
<p>fess, that if I had seen the objections to it presented by
</p>
<p>the honorable the chancellor, I should not have voted
</p>
<p>for it; and I am ready, therefore, to assent to the repeal
</p>
<p>of the law on those grounds.'
</p>
<p>"The court will please to remark what Mr. Jay con-
</p>
<p>sidered the question to be. 'I will,' said he, 'vote for
</p>
<p>the repeal of the law'  not the test oath, but the law.
</p>
<p>Chief-Justice Spencer considered the case originally
</p>
<p>unconstitutional, and proposed an amendment, but the

<p>convention, being bent on their purpose, were not to be
</p>
<p>86 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>The recorder illustrated this opinion with some feel-
</p>
<p>ing, and stated impressive cases which might occur if
</p>
<p>there should be a recurrence of such a practice, and
</p>
<p>continued : 
</p>
<p>"We have no hesitation to say that that objection
</p>
<p>would be fatal if established by legal evidence ; but you
</p>
<p>have only the proof which some of the jury themselves
</p>
<p>gave; and it is a well-settled point that a juryman
</p>
<p>cannot be heard to disparage his own verdict.
</p>
<p>"The defendant's points have all failed him. The
</p>
<p>sentence of the court therefore is, ^That you be in-
</p>
<p>capable of holding, or being elected to, any post of
</p>
<p>profit, trust, or emolument, civil or military, under this
</p>
<p>State.'"
</p>
<p>These disabilities were all removed, and Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>restored to all the rights of a citizen, by Governor
</p>
<p>Clinton.
</p>
<p>The New York city press was generally subservient
</p>
<p>to the moneyed aristocracy ; and it rarely happened that
</p>
<p>suflBcient moral courage was found among individuals
</p>
<p>to take part in resisting the storm which was raging
</p>
<p>against Mr. B. The character of this hesitation may
</p>
<p>be gathered from the following letter :

<p>diverted from abolishing the whole law: thej rejected

<p>the amendment 74 to 45.
</p>
<p>"The legislature are competent to impose any degree
</p>
<p>of punishment, provided they do not infringe the fran-
</p>
<p>chise of the citizen; this they cannot constitutionally
</p>
<p>do but for what the law denominates an infamous crime ;
</p>
<p>and the offence under consideration is at most but a
</p>
<p>misdemeanor. So far as they condemned me, under
</p>
<p>the common law, their doings are a nullity  they having
</p>
<p>done so without evidence."
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker failed to convince the court that the law
</p>
<p>of the State was unconstitutional, or that the abrogation
</p>
<p>of a portion of it had the effect of abrogating the whole.
</p>
<p>The court said, among other things, however, that it was
</p>
<p>unanimously of the opinion that it would not be just to
</p>
<p>inflict the penalty of both laws, and charged thus : 
</p>
<p>"As at common law we shall not consider the verdict,
</p>
<p>for, in the first place, we on the trial considered only
</p>
<p>the statutable offence. The proof not having sustained
</p>
<p>the count at common law, we put it to the jury only as .
</p>
<p>an offence against the statute, though they found a
</p>
<p>general verdict against you. Should we go further now,
</p>
<p>it would be inflicting a double punishment, and contrary

<p>to the testimony in the cause.
</p>
<p>"As to the ground that the jury found a verdict

<p>jurors to -prove that the jury agreed if nine of the panel

<p>CHAPTER YI.
</p>
<p>failure of the life and fire insurance company.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker continued his financial operations in
</p>
<p>Wall Street on a large scale. Most of the companies
</p>
<p>which had issued bonds became embarrassed. Mr.
</p>
<p>Eckford, considering the Life and Fire Insurance Com-
</p>
<p>pany solvent, that its portfolio would ultimately bring
</p>
<p>it out safe, undertook to sustain it with his individual
</p>
<p>credit and fortune, inducing Mr. Barker and the com-
</p>
<p>panies with which he was connected to advance to the
</p>
<p>Life and Fire Insurance Company large sums of money
</p>
<p>on his individual guarantee and other securities. He
</p>
<p>also made arrangements, in good faith, for a temporary
</p>
<p>exchange o'f two thousand shares of Fulton Bank
</p>
<p>Stock, with Mark Spencer and George W. Brown, who
</p>
<p>were directors of the Fulton Bank. Mr. Barker had
</p>
<p>not any interest in, agency, or knowledge of this nego-
</p>
<p>tiation, further than that Mr. Eckford, having occasion
</p>
<p>to visit Baltimore, leaving his partner, W. P. Rathbone,
</p>
<p>to carry the arrangements into effect, called on Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker and informed him of having made the said
</p>
<p>contract, requesting him to aid Mr. Rathbone in com-
</p>
<p>pleting the arrangement.

<p>88 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker with a letter from Mr. Eckford, in words
</p>
<p>following:  / -
</p>
<p>" New York, May 7, 1826.
</p>
<p>"Dear Sir:  In consequence of advice from Balti-
</p>
<p>more, it became necessary for me to go on to-day.
</p>
<p>Have the goodness to send me by to-day's mail the
</p>
<p>papers you talked of. It will be twelve o'clock to-
</p>
<p>morrow before I leave Philadelphia. You will have the
</p>
<p>goodness to give such aid as you can in completing the
</p>
<p>arrangement with Mr. Spencer.
</p>
<p>"Your friend,
</p>
<p>"H. Eckford.
</p>
<p>"To Jacob Barker, Esq."
</p>
<p>With this letter he submitted a draft of an agreement
</p>
<p>prepared by himself for the loan of two thousand shares
</p>
<p>of stock, to be returned by Mr. Eckford, at his option,
</p>
<p>at any time prior to the 1st of March following, asking
</p>
<p>his opinion as to its phraseology. Mr. Barker suggested
</p>
<p>that he had better add the words, "as fast, and in such
</p>
<p>proportions, as I deliver the Fulton Bank Stock." -
</p>
<p>This paper Bathbone took away from Mr. Barker's,
</p>
<p>office, had the clause suggested incorporated . therein
</p>
<p>before it was signed by Spencer and Brown or delivered
</p>
<p>to them, retaining the rough draft. The contract
</p>
<p>executed by the parties was not produced on either
</p>
<p>trial : had it been, it would have defeated the fraudulent
</p>
<p>use by Maxwell of the clause in Mr. Barker's hand-,
</p>
<p>writing on the back of the draft. The paper drawn by
</p>
<p>Bathbone called for the return of the whole at the same
</p>
<p>time. Mr. Barker suggested to Bathbone that it might
</p>
<p>be inconvenient to Mr. Eckford to return the whole at

</p>
<p>one time, when Bathbone requested Mr. Barker to
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 89
</p>
<p>draft such a condition, wliich, not supposing any injury
</p>
<p>could result therefrom, he did on the back of the -paper
</p>
<p>brought by Rathbone, and this paper was used for the
</p>
<p>vile purpose of purchasing his exemption, by making
</p>
<p>the innocent suffer for his own sins. I say fraudulent :
</p>
<p>the draft was drawn in the singular number,  meaning,
</p>
<p>I, Henry Eckford,  and signed for Henry Eckford.
</p>
<p>Maxwell read it to the jury, me  Henry Eckford  and
</p>
<p>William P. Rathbone, and insisted that the clause on
</p>
<p>the back, in my handwriting, being in the singular
</p>
<p>number, was to be signed by me ; meaning, as fast, and
</p>
<p>in such proportions, as I, Jacob Barker, and not I,
</p>
<p>Henry Eckford, deliver the stock.
</p>
<p>When the second trial came on, Hugh Maxwell, the
</p>
<p>public prosecutor, proclaimed in court that William P.
</p>
<p>Rathbone had rendered the State some service, there-
</p>
<p>fore would not be again tried ; that he was regenerated,
</p>
<p>but not disenthralled.
</p>
<p>Maxwell's excuse for letting off Rathbone was that he
</p>
<p>Wm. P. Rathbone had joined theunholy conspiracy to pro-
</p>
<p>cure the conviction of Mr. Barker, and his excuse for let-
</p>
<p>ting off Mr. Eckford w^as that he had been the victim of
</p>
<p>others, meaning of Jacob Barker. The letter of Mr. Eck-
</p>
<p>ford establishes that he was the principal in the business,
</p>
<p>be it right or wrong; that he solicited the aid of Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, and that all the aid he rendered was, on the
</p>
<p>application of Rathbone, to suggest the said prudent
</p>
<p>and harmless clause to be added to a contract drawn by
</p>
<p>Rathbone for the exchange of the Fulton Bank stock.
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford's conduct, although unfortunate, had
</p>
<p>been praiseworthy : his great fault was in not hurling

</p>
<p>boldly through, side by side with Mr. Barker; in
</p>
<p>place of which, he was beguiled by his counsel, William
</p>
<p>Price, and the public prosecutor, into the unfortunate
</p>
<p>doctrine of "save himself who can."
</p>
<p>The great discount at which the bonds of various
</p>
<p>companies sold tempted all classes to participate in the
</p>
<p>game. The avarice of the merchant, the clergyman,
</p>
<p>the widow, the lawyer, the doctor, the mechanic, the
</p>
<p>clerk, and the retired gentleman, the broker, and the
</p>
<p>banker, triumphed over their better judgment. The
</p>
<p>temptation of one, two, three, five, and sometimes ten
</p>
<p>per cent, per month for their money was too alluring : it
</p>
<p>overshadowed all other considerations.
</p>
<p>In June, 1826, the insolvent companies failed. The
</p>
<p>Life and Fire secured Mr. Barker and the companies
</p>
<p>he represented. This was done for the single purpose
</p>
<p>of protecting Mr. Eckford.
</p>
<p>The numerous class of creditors and stockholders
</p>
<p>became furious, filed a bill in chancery against Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker to make him return the securities, that they
</p>
<p>might be divided among them. The operation of the
</p>
<p>chancery suit being too slow to satisfy their impatience,
</p>
<p>they induced the district attorney, Hugh Maxwell, to
</p>
<p>apply to the grand jury for an indictment against the
</p>
<p>directors and Mr. Barker. They indicted the directors,
</p>
<p>refusing to include Mr. Barker, saying that there was
</p>
<p>not any evidence against him. Maxwell refused to
</p>
<p>bring these indicted individuals to trial until an other
</p>
<p>grand jury could be formed, which being done, a new
</p>
<p>application was made for the indictment of Jacob Bar-
</p>
<p>ker. He assured this new grand jury that if they
</p>
<p>included Mr. Barker he would give up the securities in
</p>
<p>eight days. He was successful in procuring the indict-

<p>CHAPTER yil.
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY TRIAL.
</p>
<p>The trial of the directors, Henrj Eckford, James G.
</p>
<p>Swift, William P. Rathbone, George W. Brown, Mark
</p>
<p>Spencer, Thomas Yerm^ilyea, and Jacob Barker, came on'.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker, relying on the integrity of his cause and
</p>
<p>his own capacity to establish his freedom from offence,
</p>
<p>declined the aid of his professional friends, conducting
</p>
<p>the defence himself, until near the close of the first trial.
</p>
<p>The testimony of the prosecution closed a day sooner
</p>
<p>than was anticipated, when the court called on the
</p>
<p>counsel to commence their defence. It was two o'clock.
</p>
<p>They asked until next m.orning to look over their
</p>
<p>notes, consult with each other, and arrange the order in
</p>
<p>which they would speak ; the court refused, saying
</p>
<p>they must commence at four o'clock, when Thomas J.
</p>
<p>Oakley, Esq., counsel for Mark Spencer, said, "Perhaps
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker will be willing to make his defence this after-
</p>
<p>noon ?" Mr. Barker replied, "Certainly." "Yes," said
</p>
<p>Mr. Emmet, who was counsel for Mr. Eckford, "if they
</p>
<p>were all to be hanged, Mr. Barker would say. Hang me
</p>
<p>first." The court adjourned, and met again at four
</p>
<p>o'clock, when Mr. Barker spoke thus:

<p>MR. barker's speech.

</p>
<p>understanding of its yarious details. What is it for
</p>
<p>which I come here? Do I not come to advocate the
</p>
<p>cause of the father,  the cause of jou, gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, of your wives and children, of this honorable
</p>
<p>court and their children,  the cause of the mother and
</p>
<p>the cause of a family heretofore happy and prosperous?
</p>
<p>But not for these purposes alone appear I before you.
</p>
<p>I advocate the cause of public justice, no less than the
</p>
<p>most powerful affections of human life. The sorrow
</p>
<p>this trial inflicts upon many innocent j^ersons is of the
</p>
<p>deepest kind. It is from you, gentlemen, that I confi-
</p>
<p>dently expect and hope for aid to wipe away those stains.
</p>
<p>But the number that will read an account of the re-
</p>
<p>deeming qualities of this trial are few in comparison
</p>
<p>with those who have listened to the slanders or believed
</p>
<p>the calumnies. For myself, I am willing to receive -all
</p>
<p>the consequences for the privilege of putting before the
</p>
<p>world proof of my innocence ; but I feel for others.
</p>
<p>"The subject of finance is one of great magnitude
</p>
<p>and mystery ; few understand it. I flatter myself that
</p>
<p>I have some experience on the subject, and it is on that
</p>
<p>account I am unwilling to trust to counsel. I am well
</p>
<p>aware that I am surrounded by great talents, greater
</p>
<p>than I have any pretensions to. To the whole bar I
</p>
<p>owe an apology for appearing here in my own person,
</p>
<p>to do for myself what all the world have told me they
</p>
<p>could do so much better for me; they will excuse me,
</p>
<p>for they know I do not intend any disrespect for them.
</p>
<p>They know the high estimation in which I hold their
</p>
<p>learning, their logic, their eloquence, and their justice ;
</p>
<p>and that venerable patriot, ihe pride and glory of two
</p>
<p>nations, knows how I love him, and how the story of

</p>
<p>his love of liberty warmed and swelled my bosom in
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 93
</p>
<p>"boyhood, how I greeted him welcome when, flying from
</p>
<p>prejudice and persecution, he first landed on this sacred
</p>
<p>spot, and how constant I hai^e been in my attachment
</p>
<p>to him ever since. With all this, I have no fears of
</p>
<p>kindling unkind feelings with those who love the law,
</p>
<p>and whose practice is to make manifest the excellence
</p>
<p>of that which merits their love.
</p>
<p>"I come here under many disadvantages. The odds
</p>
<p>are fearfully against me. I said that this business was
</p>
<p>very difiicult to understand, and had many conflicting
</p>
<p>interests. I dare not trust thjat I can separate them
</p>
<p>with sufficient clearness, but I will try ; and, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I rely on your intelligence to separate these conflicting
</p>
<p>interests. The past has been a great season of excite-
</p>
<p>ment among the dealers in stock, bonds, bank-notes,
</p>
<p>&c. In all these difficulties I have more or less mixed;
</p>
<p>in the financial concerns of this city I generally have
</p>
<p>had a hand. It has been made manifest, after four-
</p>
<p>teen days' investigation before you, in which I have
</p>
<p>stood here before my accusers, boldly bidding them
</p>
<p>to tell all they knew, that not a hem of my garment
</p>
<p>has been touched. I complain that I do not come here
</p>
<p>upon equal terms with any other man. Public prejudice
</p>
<p>has been excited against me. The newspapers long since
</p>
<p>called upon the grand jury to indict Jacob Barker ;
</p>
<p>his door has been chalked ; he has been called a rogue ;
</p>
<p>every species of reproach has been heaped upon him.
</p>
<p>During that time Jacob Barker pursued the even tenor
</p>
<p>of his way. Witness after witness had been examined,
</p>
<p>and that grand jury was dismissed without finding a bill of
</p>
<p>indictment against me. Hand-bills continued to be pub-
</p>
<p>lished ; poems have been written,  and all against Jacob

<p>Barker, stating that all was not unravelled. It was pub-
</p>
<p>94 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>lished that this and that institution had failed, the funds
</p>
<p>of which had all disappeared ; all this had been laid at
</p>
<p>mj door, and a second grand jury called to indict me.
</p>
<p>The moment I heard of the indictment, I was ready and
</p>
<p>anxious for trial. I wanted no books, no preparation ;
</p>
<p>I was willing to submit the cause, after all that could be
</p>
<p>brought up, to a candid jury, but was pressed on all
</p>
<p>sides not to go to trial. My friends told me that I
</p>
<p>could not get an impartial one. I was sorry to hear
</p>
<p>this, and I did not believe it. I knew it was the
</p>
<p>court and jury that had to try me, and I considered it
</p>
<p>impossible but that I should have a fair trial, and there-
</p>
<p>fore demanded it forthwith. You have heard it said in
</p>
<p>this court that an acquittal by you would do Jacob
</p>
<p>Barker no good. I know better ; and I will convince
</p>
<p>you, by the zeal, the ardor, the pertinacity with which
</p>
<p>I shall plead before you, that I place a high value on
</p>
<p>what the district attorney has dared to say would do
</p>
<p>me no good from such men as you. I knew your ver-
</p>
<p>dict would be valuable, and I asked it as such.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, I come here armed with justice, and,
</p>
<p>confident in the wisdom and integrity of my conduct, I
</p>
<p>come here to clear myself from the imputations that
</p>
<p>have so falsely been made against me. I have brought
</p>
<p>with me these four boys. [Here he pointed to four
</p>
<p>promising young men, a part of those twelve children
</p>
<p>to whom he alluded when speaking of the " beardless
</p>
<p>boy" who had been sent by the conspirators on his
</p>
<p>oath to insult their father.] I have brought them here
</p>
<p>that they may learn a useful lesson ; that they may see
</p>
<p>the excellence of the motto I have from their infancy
</p>
<p>endeavored to impress on their young minds,  'Be just,

</p>
<p>and fear not,'  that they may feel, in listening to my
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 95
</p>
<p>vindication, tlie force of trutli and justice over calumny
</p>
<p>and fraud, and that thej may know that they have not
</p>
<p>had, and will never have, cause to blush hereafter when
</p>
<p>they speak of their fatHer's memory or hear their
</p>
<p>father's name. To do myself justice is a great object;
</p>
<p>to do my children justice, a greater.
</p>
<p>^'In his opening speech the district attorney promised
</p>
<p>me a fair trial. The idea of such a promise  of being
</p>
<p>promised a fair trial  shocked me to the quick. What !
</p>
<p>is the trial to be given by the district attorney ? is its
</p>
<p>impartiality or fairness left to him ? No, gentlemen, it
</p>
<p>is not so. It is the judge on that bench, and the jury
</p>
<p>on these chairs, and not the district attorney, that can
</p>
<p>give me a fair trial. I am to be adjudged by you on
</p>
<p>the evidence that is produced and will be produced.
</p>
<p>But how dare the district attorney name such a thing to
</p>
<p>a free citizen ? Let your verdict, whether of guilt or
</p>
<p>innocence, be delivered on the evidence under your
</p>
<p>oaths, and who shall gainsay it ?
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, I was very unexpectedly called upon by
</p>
<p>counsel for the other defendants, after I came into court
</p>
<p>this morning, to make an opening,  which was the first
</p>
<p>intimation that it was their intention for me to lead the
</p>
<p>van ; and, as I always keep my powder dry, I make no
</p>
<p>complaint about being surprised into premature battle.
</p>
<p>I live in the country, or I should have heard the alarm-
</p>
<p>gun last evening, and made a little preparation : not
</p>
<p>having done so, I hope my deficiencies will be forgiven.
</p>
<p>So far as the trial has proceeded, I have reason, thank
</p>
<p>God, to be satisfied. I have no brief, and have taken
</p>
<p>no notes.
</p>

</p>
<p>and their testimony is mixed up in such a manner as
</p>
<p>96 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>will make it very difficult to be understood. There are
</p>
<p>the broker and usurer, there are the debtors to the
</p>
<p>company, and those who have failed to acquire fame in
</p>
<p>the management of the business of finance, all warring
</p>
<p>with each other, and at the same time warring against
</p>
<p>me and combining together for my destruction. The
</p>
<p>idea is shocking to them that amid the disasters, the
</p>
<p>wide-spread ruin which has desolated so many of our
</p>
<p>moneyed institutions, the affairs of the companies which
</p>
<p>have, in a considerable degree, been intrusted to my
</p>
<p>management should have been so ably, so prudently,
</p>
<p>and so successfully managed as to be preserved not
</p>
<p>only whole and sound, but their dividends not curtailed.
</p>
<p>The debtors of the Life and Fire Insurance Company,
</p>
<p>whose want of punctuality has been the sole cause of
</p>
<p>the failure, now wish to take advantage of the ruin
</p>
<p>their own bad faith has occasioned, and to purchase up
</p>
<p>the bonds for a mere song, and pay them back to the
</p>
<p>company at par; and to effect this they cry 'fraud,'
</p>
<p>'fraud,' against me, in the hope of invalidating the
</p>
<p>transfer of the securities to me. The bond-holders are
</p>
<p>mortified that I should have got my pay when they did
</p>
<p>not, and therefore unite in the cry of 'fraud,' 'fraud,' in
</p>
<p>the hope of getting an equal distribution of the assets
</p>
<p>of the company ; forgetting that they got thirty, forty,
</p>
<p>and fifty per cent, per annum for fheir money, and that
</p>
<p>mine was lent without interest, commission, discount, or
</p>
<p>usury, unaccompanied by any circumstance to cloud or
</p>
<p>mar the purity of the transaction.
</p>
<p>"The stockholders unite in the cry of 'fraud' against
</p>
<p>all parties, in the hope of dividing all the effects of the

<p>company and defrauding all the creditors of a parti-

<p>cipation therein, although the present effects of the
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 97
</p>
<p>company are almost exclusively tlie offspring, the fruits,
</p>
<p>the avails of the bonds out, or the bonds for which
</p>
<p>those out were given in renewal. This, gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, is the first time it has been pretended that
</p>
<p>partners in trade,  and stockholders in an incorporation
</p>
<p>cannot be considered in any other light,  it is, I say,
</p>
<p>the first time that partners in trade have avowed an
</p>
<p>intention to divide all the effects of the partnership
</p>
<p>among themselves, without paying a single debt of the
</p>
<p>firm. The records of the courts of all the Avorld do not
</p>
<p>furnish a single instance of such an enormity; and yet
</p>
<p>I am now on my trial for a fraud against these virtuous
</p>
<p>stockholders, for the single reason that I am now an
</p>
<p>obstacle to the consummation of their iniquitous schemes.
</p>
<p>A great portion of the securities I received came to my
</p>
<p>hands before I lent the money ; why should this pre-
</p>
<p>judice them against me? Industry, prudence, and
</p>
<p>talent will succeed in any business ; and after lending
</p>
<p>so much money to save the company from suspending
</p>
<p>its payments, and thereby protecting the stockholder
</p>
<p>and bondholder from loss, they arm against me because
</p>
<p>I could not advance more money for their exclusive
</p>
<p>benefit. With another difficulty I have to contend.
</p>
<p>Ancient prejudices are revived and brought here, and
</p>
<p>combined with the recent occurrences for the purpose
</p>
<p>of destroying me  prejudices growing out of misfor-
</p>
<p>tunes occasioned by circumstances over which I had no
</p>
<p>control  misfortunes I have been struggling to sur-
</p>
<p>mount as I would for the preservation of the apple of
</p>
<p>my eye; and I hope to satisfy all of the purity of my
</p>
<p>intentions. I admit the very great prejudice against
</p>
<p>me of the moneyed aristocracy of Wall Street, and that

</p>

</p>
<p>me. But this is a day of revolutions ; and I publicly

<p>make a most thorough and perfect revolution in the

<p>public opinion in relation to Jacob Barker's guilt, and

<p>I think I have done so. I love the world, and, if I
</p>
<p>could make the world love me, I should be happy.
</p>
<p>With the mechanic, the cartman, the laborer, the men
</p>
<p>who live by the sweat of their brow, and, consequently,
</p>
<p>who think honestly on all subjects,  ^with this most
</p>
<p>meritorious portion of our citizens, no such general pre-
</p>
<p>judice exists against Jacob Barker. With these, it is
</p>
<p>the pride and delight of my heart to stand well ; and of
</p>
<p>their friendship and confidence, I assert without the
</p>
<p>fear of contradiction, no individual possesses a larger
</p>
<p>share.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, it has been asked over and over again,
</p>
<p>why has Jacob Barker been indicted? In vain have I
</p>
<p>listened and looked for a justifiable cause. I give you
</p>
<p>my honor that I am yet ignorant, and therefore am
</p>
<p>obliged to fight in the dark. Imagine for what it is that
</p>
<p>you are to be required to convict me : you have heard
</p>
<p>the district attorney more than once tell me he would
</p>
<p>let me know when he comes to sum up the case. Observe,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, when he comes to sum up : then I shall be
</p>
<p>bound hand and foot, muffled and gagged ; then the rules
</p>
<p>of the court will not permit me to call a single witness,
</p>
<p>or to say a single word in explanation or vindication of
</p>
<p>what he may then be graciously pleased to say to my
</p>
<p>prejudice. It is then, and not till then, that I am to
</p>
<p>know for what I am now on my trial. I have said that
</p>
<p>I did not know for what reason this bill of indictment

</p>
<p>had been procured against me. There are two circum-
</p>
<p>LIFE OE JACOB BARKER. 99
</p>
<p>stances tliat may have led to it, which I will relate to
</p>
<p>you. First, when Mr. Boyd told me of a project he
</p>
<p>had for harmonizing the then existing disputes between
</p>
<p>the ins and outs of the Tradesmen's Bank, which was
</p>
<p>to leave in the pockets of the incautious sellers eighty-
</p>
<p>four thousand dollars profit, to have the bank returned
</p>
<p>to them, and for the 'great unknown' quietly to resign
</p>
<p>the bank, losing his eighty-four thousand dollars, for
</p>
<p>having dared to do what every man in the community
</p>
<p>considers himself at liberty to do, viz. : purchase bank-
</p>
<p>stock. When Mr. Boyd mentioned this splendid money-
</p>
<p>making scheme to me, I exclaimed, ' Preposterous ! non-
</p>
<p>sense ! if it was my case, I would make you disgorge
</p>
<p>your ill-gotten gains.' For this high offence  the high
</p>
<p>offence of expressing a sound opinion of and honest
</p>
<p>indignation at such a proposition  the parties, or some
</p>
<p>of them, which I know not, have been filling the ears
</p>
<p>/)f the district attorney with suspicions of me. The
</p>
<p>other circumstance was, that before my indictment I
</p>
<p>heard everywhere that the district attorney was pro-
</p>
<p>claiming, with apparent exultation, that the gentlemen
</p>
<p>then indicted would all, to a certainty, be convicted,
</p>
<p>and that he held in his pocket abundant evidence of
</p>
<p>their guilt. This being repeated in my presence at
</p>
<p>the funeral of Judge Van Ness, and my friend Mr.
</p>
<p>Eckford being one of the persons indicted,  although
</p>
<p>I was not, myself, at that time so unfortunate, I could
</p>
<p>not contain my indignation, and I did say that the dis-
</p>
<p>trict attorney was wrong ; that the oath of his ofiice
</p>
<p>imposed on him the same obligation to protect the inno-
</p>
<p>cent that it did to punish the guilty ; and that if such
</p>
<p>a man as Hem*y Eckford, after a long life of private

<p>100 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>hj a combination of circumstances, a mistaken confi-
</p>
<p>dence in those about bim, or a momentary relaxation
</p>
<p>of those rigid principles of morality which had hitherto
</p>
<p>regulated his every action, betrayed into error, it should
</p>
<p>fill the district attorney with grief and horror ; and that
</p>
<p>he should go on to discharge the duties of his ofiice
</p>
<p>with melancholy regret, and not go about the streets
</p>
<p>prejudging the case and prejudicing the public mind ;
</p>
<p>(adding to Mr. Price, who was present), I wish you
</p>
<p>would say these things to the district attorney, and tell
</p>
<p>him also that he has fallen, very much fallen, in my
</p>
<p>estimation. Now, it may have been better that I had
</p>
<p>listened in silence, and denied utterance to those ofi'end-
</p>
<p>ing words, and performed the difiicult task of restraining
</p>
<p>my tongue from pursuing its accustomed frank and
</p>
<p>fearless course.
</p>
<p>^' Gentlemen of the jury, nothing can be more obvious
</p>
<p>than that all these proceedings are a crusade against^
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker, who has done no wrong. The district
</p>
<p>attorney spread and drew, his net again and again with-
</p>
<p>out catching him. Others were indicted by the dozen ;
</p>
<p>those who had failed to protect the interests of the
</p>
<p>stockholder and creditor of the companies intrusted to
</p>
<p>their management were indicted ; and although this
</p>
<p>happened days, weeks, and almost months before he got
</p>
<p>me in the boat, yet he never thought to bring one of the
</p>
<p>individuals thus indicted to trial. At length he induced
</p>
<p>a too willing grand jury to gratify his wishes, by en-
</p>
<p>rolling Jacob Barker among the number who were to
</p>
<p>come here and meet their accusers. Please take notice,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, that Jacob Barker had preserved from the
</p>
<p>calamities of the times all the institutions which he had

</p>
<p>is urged for postponing the trial ; every other indict-
</p>
<p>ment is forgotten and left slumbering on the dusty
</p>
<p>shelves of the district attorney. The last of all is first
</p>
<p>called up, and for what? For fear lest the hideous
</p>
<p>monster, prejudice, which has been thus artificially got
</p>
<p>up in Wall Street, and about this house, should give
</p>
<p>way to calm reflection, to reason, and to a becoming
</p>
<p>sense of propriety. But, gentlemen of the jury, I do
</p>
<p>not complain; I have, from the hour of indictment,
</p>
<p>been impatient for a trial ; and, in truth I may say,
</p>
<p>the week which elapsed previous to its commencement
</p>
<p>has been the most impatient of my life. ^
</p>
<p>"[Mr. Barker having, when he first rose to address
</p>
<p>the jury, borrowed of the clerk the bill of indictment,
</p>
<p>and on the margin made a few pencil memorandums to
</p>
<p>use in lieu of notes, proceeded to comment on the alle-
</p>
<p>gations therein, in the order in wdiich they stood.]
</p>
<p>With the Mechanics' Fire Insurance Company (he said)
</p>
<p>I never had a single transaction, nor did I ever own a
</p>
<p>share of stock in that company ; and if the district
</p>
<p>attorney will ask its president and directors, they will
</p>
<p>one and all say, on their oaths, that Jacob Barker has
</p>
<p>not, directly or indirectly, defrauded that company.
</p>
<p>With the Tradesmen's Bank he has not had any dealings,
</p>
<p>and he never owned a single share in it during the
</p>
<p>whole course of his life. Eight hundred shares of its
</p>
<p>stock were transferred to Seth Sturtevant, a clerk in
</p>
<p>the Western Insurance Company, for the use of that
</p>
<p>company, by William P. Bathbone. Three hundred
</p>
<p>shares were transferred back in a day or two ; Mr.
</p>
<p>Rathbone wanted the whole, and, it not being conve-
</p>
<p>nient at the moment to transfer them, I, being the
</p>
<p>active officer of the Western Company, gave a memo-

<p>102 LIFE OF JACOB BAKKER.
</p>
<p>randum to Mr. Rathbone, promising to deliver to S. L.
</p>
<p>Groverneur, Esq., five hundred shares of bank-stock.
</p>
<p>Observe, 'promised to deliver;' not borrowed, not re-
</p>
<p>ceived, not to return, as has been proclaimed to you in
</p>
<p>triumph, but simply to ^delivery' and this promise was
</p>
<p>immediately thereafter openly and publicly complied
</p>
<p>with ; to do which, I drove to the Tradesmen's Bank
</p>
<p>at noonday, in my own carriage, amid the surrounding
</p>
<p>multitude, and publicly proclaimed my readiness to
</p>
<p>comply on the surrender of my memorandum. And is
</p>
<p>this open and prudent course to be considered evidence
</p>
<p>of fraud ? does it not rather indicate every thing else ?
</p>
<p>Had I been the ' great unknown' purchaser, had I
</p>
<p>been a secret conspirator, had I been guilty of the
</p>
<p>least impropriety, should I not have sent a clerk or a
</p>
<p>friend? If these men had been my agents, my tools,
</p>
<p>my creatures, with whom I had intrusted four or five
</p>
<p>thousand shares of stock, and the whole bank, should
</p>
<p>I have denied to them so publicly, and at so critical a
</p>
<p>moment, the trifling confidence of delivering five hun-
</p>
<p>dred shares of stock, relying on their fidelity to return
</p>
<p>the obligation for it? This single circumstance speaks,
</p>
<p>to my mind, volumes, but it is,like my every other act, to
</p>
<p>be tortured into evidence of guilt  is declared to be
</p>
<p>*my peculiar way of doing things,' and to have been
</p>
<p>planned on purpose to deceive.
</p>
<p>"I perceive, by the course of the examination, that
</p>
<p>a great flourish is to be made by the district attorney
</p>
<p>about this clerk's not being of age. On this subject I
</p>
<p>can only say that we are not apt to consider wrong the
</p>
<p>things we have openly practised through life. I traded
</p>
<p>a little when a boy, and before I was of age was in-

</p>
<p>terested in four ships and a brig, and had my note dis-
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 103
</p>
<p>counted and continued as an accommodation note at the
</p>
<p>United States Branch Bank. I have, since I became
</p>
<p>of age, confided a great portion of my business to young
</p>
<p>gentlemen not twenty-one years old, and it never oc-
</p>
<p>curred to me that such confidence could be made the
</p>
<p>foundation of a criminal prosecution. In addition to
</p>
<p>this practice, Mr. Catlin, Mr. Fleming, and I believe
</p>
<p>every witness who was examined on the subject, told
</p>
<p>you that it was the universal custom to pass stocks by
</p>
<p>blank powers, that is, without naming the purchaser or
</p>
<p>seller ; by which means it could pass through the hands
</p>
<p>of persons without number, and not one of them appear
</p>
<p>or be known. However, I will not detain you longer
</p>
<p>about this custom, but examine the legal operations of
</p>
<p>the system. Stock and all other property is the mere
</p>
<p>creature of the lav/, and is equally amenable to that
</p>
<p>law in the hands of a minor as in the hands of a person
</p>
<p>of age. If such minor has no interest in it, the chan-
</p>
<p>cellor can take it from him, the same as a court of law
</p>
<p>can take it from a person of full age ; therefore, this
</p>
<p>tale about the youth of Seth Sturtevant is got up for
</p>
<p>the sole purpose of making a great noise about nothing,
</p>
<p>and producing stage effect.
</p>
<p>"In connection with the Tradesmen's Bank there is
</p>
<p>another circumstance. Mr. Cox, who, during the ten
</p>
<p>days' reign of the new dynasty over that bank, was its
</p>
<p>cashier, was formerly in my employ ; at which time I
</p>
<p>left a message for him to write some Democratic
</p>
<p>tickets, for the then pending election, to be furnished
</p>
<p>to a stevedore, also in my employ, who could not write,
</p>
<p>and who had applied for them. Mr. Cox declined the
</p>
<p>service. I told him that it had not any thing to do

</p>
<p>with his political principles ; that I did not wish him to
</p>
<p>104 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>vote or give liis name to any tiling. He appeared
</p>
<p>totally to mistake the matter ; and, being unwilling to
</p>
<p>part with him, I recommended him to consult his friends.
</p>
<p>He did so. He consulted Mr. Lydig and others, and
</p>
<p>returned, saying he should adhere to his refusal. The
</p>
<p>consequence was, he left my employ, and the ^Evening
</p>
<p>Post' charged me with dismissing a most worthy clerk
</p>
<p>because he would not vote for the Democratic ticket.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox seeing this, and being an honest and generous
</p>
<p>man, although indignant at what he, no doubt, supposed
</p>
<p>to be on my part oppression, came immediately forward,
</p>
<p>and published to the world that I had not in the whole
</p>
<p>course of my life said one word to him about voting, or
</p>
<p>about his political principles, nor had I, to his know-
</p>
<p>ledge or belief, even allowed myself to talk on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject to a single clerk in my employ. Mr. Cox, as you
</p>
<p>may well conclude, soon found his way back into my
</p>
<p>counting-house, and served me faithfully for a long time.
</p>
<p>But in consequence of my misfortunes he had to seek
</p>
<p>employment elsewhere ; and for about seven years he
</p>
<p>had been in the employment of others, until the recent
</p>
<p>dijQBculty at the Tradesmen's Bank ; about which time
</p>
<p>he suddenly fell sick. I then, for the first time in my
</p>
<p>life, visited him, found him in a high fever, surrounded
</p>
<p>by a lovely wife, beautiful children, and two not less
</p>
<p>lovely sisters, all in tears. They, with trembling solici-
</p>
<p>tude, told me that they supposed Mr. Cox's apprehen-
</p>
<p>sions in relation to losing his place, on the salary of
</p>
<p>which his family depended, contributed greatly to in-
</p>
<p>crease his disorder. My reply was, 'No matter if he
</p>
<p>does lose his place: there are others as good as that.
</p>
<p>He has got into bad company ; and the sooner he clears

</p>
<p>out the better. Let him resign immediately, and when
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 105
</p>
<p>he gets well, if he wants employment, let him come
</p>
<p>back to me, and he shall not want. He is an honest
</p>
<p>man, and I dare employ him amid the cloud of suspicion
</p>
<p>that for the moment surrounds him.' These remarks
</p>
<p>animated him, and he approved of the suggestion. I
</p>
<p>immediately drafted for him a letter of resignation,
</p>
<p>which was instantly sent to Mr. Governeur, and when
</p>
<p>he got well he did come, and he found employment.
</p>
<p>And this, gentlemen of the jury, is to be urged upon
</p>
<p>you as evidence of my guilt. Wait, I beseech you, wait
</p>
<p>until these lovely women come into court and relate the
</p>
<p>tale for themselves. Yes,- 1 did more. Mr. Cox has
</p>
<p>also been indicted. I advised him not to employ any
</p>
<p>professional man to defend him, but to petition the
</p>
<p>court to grant that favor to me, urging on him that his
</p>
<p>whole duties could, in the language of General Gaines,
</p>
<p>be described in one word, and that word was obedience ;
</p>
<p>that his whole offence consisted in having been obedient
</p>
<p>to his superiors, to men whose duty it was to decide by
</p>
<p>their votes that by law he had no right to a voice in
</p>
<p>such decisions, but was imperiously bound to carry into
</p>
<p>full and prompt effect the decisions of the directors;
</p>
<p>that he had not, according to the best of my knowledge
</p>
<p>and belief, done any thing more than to be obedient,
</p>
<p>which, if I was allowed to plead his cause, I supposed I
</p>
<p>could make as manifest as the light of the sun to any
</p>
<p>jury on earth. This too, I suppose, is to be urged as
</p>
<p>further evidence of my crime. Mr. Beers called on
</p>
<p>me, as he did on others, shortly before the election of
</p>
<p>directors for the Tradesmen's Bank, and inquired if I
</p>
<p>knew who had purchased the bank, and told me that
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox was to be the cashier. I answered that I had

</p>
<p>not the least interest in it, and did not know who had,
</p>
<p>106 LIFE OF JACOB BAKKER.
</p>
<p>but that I supposed I could find out. He wished me to
</p>
<p>do so, and ascertain for him the terms on which it could
</p>
<p>be purchased. I told him I would not intermeddle to
</p>
<p>the prejudice of Mr. Cox,  that he had been one of mj
</p>
<p>boys, and been faithful, that he was an honest man,
</p>
<p>that it was a sine qua non with me that he must be pro-
</p>
<p>vided for if I interfered, that I did not know any thing
</p>
<p>about his views, that I had not seen him for more than
</p>
<p>a month, and did not before know that he was to be the
</p>
<p>cashier. Mr. Beers gave me to understand that every
</p>
<p>thing should be made satisfactory; and I made the
</p>
<p>effort to find out the purchaser : I did not succeed, and
</p>
<p>so reported the business.
</p>
<p>"The Morris Canal and Banking Company is also
</p>
<p>named as one of the institutions which I am charged
</p>
<p>with defrauding. This institution I saved from in-
</p>
<p>solvency. The president and directors have sworn that
</p>
<p>I acted with zeal, fidelity, and success, and that I did
</p>
<p>not defraud the Morris Canal and Banking Company.
</p>
<p>They promised me a fee of five thousand dollars ; and
</p>
<p>you have seen the devices resorted to for the purpose of
</p>
<p>chousing me out of the richly-earned commission. They,
</p>
<p>through Mr. Vermilyea, lent the Dutchess County In-
</p>
<p>surance Company ten thousand dollars, which sum was
</p>
<p>paid back to their cashier the first time it was applied
</p>
<p>for. When they were run for specie,  trembling, and
</p>
<p>expecting to stop every hour,  the Dutchess County In-
</p>
<p>surance Company lent them five thousand dollars, and
</p>
<p>agreed to wait six months for its return, without any
</p>
<p>other compensation than simple interest ; and the debt
</p>
<p>is still due from the Morris Canal and Banking Com-
</p>
<p>pany to the Dutchess Company. During the pressure

</p>
<p>on the bank, William Bayard, Esq., called on me with a
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 107
</p>
<p>letter from Mr. Eckford, soliciting my assistance to tlie
</p>
<p>amount of twenty-five thousand dollars, and guarantee-
</p>
<p>ing to the amount of ten thousand dollars. The ten
</p>
<p>thousand dollars I offered to furnish, without any other
</p>
<p>compensation than lawful interest, but, the solidity of
</p>
<p>the notes offered as security for the other fifteen thou-
</p>
<p>sand dollars being to me unknown, I declined taking
</p>
<p>them. At the same time, I stated that they could be
</p>
<p>negotiated at a discount of thirty or thirty-three and
</p>
<p>one-third per cent. This was deemed too much, and the
</p>
<p>negotiation fell through.
</p>
<p>" The district attorney, in his opening speech, told you
</p>
<p>that Mr. Yermilyea and myself had had the management
</p>
<p>of the finances of the Morris Canal and Banking Com-
</p>
<p>pany, and that Mr. Eckford had stood aloof, but that
</p>
<p>the funds had been purloined by Mr. Eckford, Mr.
</p>
<p>Davis, and some others. On the trial, the president,
</p>
<p>cashier, and clerks all swore that I had not, in a single
</p>
<p>instance, intermeddled with their funds, nor had I ever
</p>
<p>been in the office of the company ; but Mr. Gilchrist,
</p>
<p>the cashier, said that money to a vast amount was paid
</p>
<p>to the other gentlemen, and proved the checks of the
</p>
<p>Morris Canal Company on the Fulton Bank, in favor of
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford, Mr. Davis, &c., which checks had been paid
</p>
<p>and not accounted for, and no memorandum made of
</p>
<p>their indebtedness. This was no concern of mine, the
</p>
<p>witnesses all exonerating me ; but, as the district attorney
</p>
<p>had coupled my name with the alleged fraud, I took upon
</p>
<p>myself to interrogate Mr. Gilchrist, and exhibited by him
</p>
<p>the whole imposition attempted to be practised. My
</p>
<p>questions were, ' Is the published statement of the affairs
</p>
<p>of the Morris Canal Company true or false?' He an-

</p>
<p>the whole amount of the losses sustained by the bank
</p>
<p>from its commencement : did you mean that the whole
</p>
<p>losses of the bank had not been greater?' 'I did; and
</p>
<p>still think so.' 'Are any part of those losses formed by
</p>
<p>the money paid for those checks?' 'Not any.' 'Sup-
</p>
<p>pose the money had been borrowed by the Morris Canal
</p>
<p>Company of Mr. Eckford and others, and the same de-
</p>
<p>posited in the Fulton Bank to the credit of the Morris

<p>Canal Company, and those checks subsequently given
</p>
<p>to pay them therefor : would not the affairs of the com-
</p>
<p>pany have stood as they now stand?' 'They would.'
</p>
<p>' Then the company cannot have lost the money, or any
</p>
<p>part of it.' 'No: it has lost nothing by the money
</p>
<p>paid for those checks.' Here, gentlemen, you see how
</p>
<p>monstrous is the conduct of these men, who are en-
</p>
<p>deavoring to make it appear that giving checks to pay
</p>
<p>money borrowed was making a fraudulent use of the
</p>
<p>funds of the bank without security or compensation.
</p>
<p>You will also bear in mind that Mr. Bayard stated
</p>
<p>that Mr. Eckford had often lent the company money
</p>
<p>when it was in want, and that the company had never
</p>
<p>lent Mr. Eckford any.

</p>
<p>deed, that I am to be blamed for considering the laborer
</p>
<p>worthy of his hire. For you must always remember
</p>
<p>that I met at the threshold all applications for assist-

<p>twenty-five hundred shares of stock, and in the presence
</p>
<p>of Mr. Eckford and Mr. Ogden, both of whom were
</p>
<p>directors of that bank and members of its finance com-
</p>
<p>mittee. And yet you are told that I attempted to pro-
</p>
<p>cure a commission from both sides ! Now, I never did
</p>
<p>attempt to charge, or think of charging, Mr. Eckford
</p>
<p>any thing, and, if I had, it would not have been charging
</p>
<p>both sides ; for Mr. Eckford and Mr. Ogden were, as to
</p>
<p>the bargain to be made by me, on one and the same
</p>
<p>side, and the Fulton Bank was on the other side ; and
</p>
<p>surely it has not been, nor will it be, pretended that I
</p>
<p>charged the Fulton Bank a single cent for my services.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, the moment the interest of my employ-
</p>
<p>ers required a sacrifice on my part, I gratuitously oifer
</p>
<p>to surrender my whole commission, this mighty five
</p>
<p>thousand dollars, to the Fulton Bank ; and yet I am
</p>
<p>charged with attempting to defraud both institutions.
</p>
<p>"I am also charged with a conspiracy to defraud
</p>
<p>Messrs. H. and G. Barclay, B. H. Hough, and E. W.
</p>
<p>King. The two former gentlemen have been on the
</p>
<p>stand, and you have heard them examined. Not one
</p>
<p>word to my prejudice escaped their lips ; and the only
</p>
<p>conspiracy to defraud that I know of, in connection
</p>
<p>with them, is as sworn to by themselves ; that they, as
</p>
<p>stockholders, and, as I have before said, as partners in
</p>
<p>the concern, are endeavoring to divide the effects of the
</p>
<p>Life and Fire Insurance Company among the partners
</p>
<p>of the firm, to the exclusion of their creditors, on the
</p>
<p>dishonorable plea that the bonds were unlawfully issued.
</p>
<p>With such a conspiracy, gentlemen, please bear in mind
</p>
<p>that I had nothing to do,  as I was not a stockholder, a
</p>
<p>director, or an ofiicer of the Life and Fire Insurance
</p>
<p>Company, nor its agent in the issuing or selling a single

</p>
<p>bond. As to Alderman King, the district attorney has
</p>
<p>not dared to call him. He is an honest man, and my
</p>
<p>neighbor ; and should he be called, he would on his
</p>
<p>oath tell you that Jacob Barker has not either defrauded
</p>
<p>him or done him or his family an unkindness in his
</p>
<p>whole life. A lady is also introduced into this part of
</p>
<p>the plot, a most worthy woman, Miss Ann Titus ; and
</p>
<p>what did she swear? You must all remember how em-
</p>
<p>phatically she declared that Jacob Barker had not, to
</p>
<p>her knowledge, directly or indirectly defrauded her ;
</p>
<p>that she had never thought he had done so, nor had
</p>
<p>she ever said to a single human being aught to his
</p>
<p>prejudice.
</p>
<p>"We now, gentlemen of the jury, come to the most
</p>
<p>fruitful source of misrepresentation, the affairs of the
</p>
<p>Life and Fire Insurance Company. So far as I have
</p>
<p>been connected therewith, the district attorney has
</p>
<p>furnished abundant testimony that I have not had any
</p>
<p>part or lot in the management of their affairs, with the
</p>
<p>exception of lending them money on satisfactory se-
</p>
<p>curity, selling some Fulton Bank stock, and accepting a
</p>
<p>power of attorney to collect debts due, to pay all my lawful
</p>
<p>claims, and hand the excess over to the company ; that
</p>
<p>I have been faithful in my stewardship ; that I offered
</p>
<p>to return all the securities received on the payment of
</p>
<p>the money due ; and that, until a decision of the chan-
</p>
<p>cellor could be had thereon, I offered to pay all that
</p>
<p>could be collected into the hands of Lynde Catlin, Esq.,
</p>
<p>president of the Merchants' Bank. I never knew one
</p>
<p>word about the manner in which the books have been
</p>
<p>kept, until after the failure ; and, if I should remain on
</p>
<p>trial until doomsday, not a single witness could be

<p>brought who could gainsay that fact. I have had great
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. Ill
</p>
<p>confidence in that company, and uniformly said so, and
</p>
<p>all my conduct will square with that confidence.
</p>
<p>"I have sold but few, very few, bonds. To Garniss
</p>
<p>I sold some to raise money for the Dutchess Insurance
</p>
<p>Company to use during my absence, but I bought of
</p>
<p>him bonds to a far greater amount. In 1819, when the
</p>
<p>aristocracy of Vf all Street were levelling all their artillery
</p>
<p>at my Exchange Bank, and when other men of wealth
</p>
<p>were frightened off from my support, Mr. Eckford
</p>
<p>generously loosened his purse-strings, and, without pay,
</p>
<p>price, or security, lent me large sums of money ; the
</p>
<p>18th of June, 1819, when I had to lower my colors to
</p>
<p>the allied forces, I, accompanied by my friend Mr. Hal-
</p>
<p>leck, called him up at midnight and gave him security.
</p>
<p>'' Gentlemen of the jury, the individual who thus
</p>
<p>supported me in turn was disappointed in the receipts
</p>
<p>he had a right to have expected in the payment for the
</p>
<p>frigates he had built, which disappointment was wholly
</p>
<p>owing to the failure of the Goldsmidts,  great bankers
</p>
<p>of London. Under these circumstances, he applied to
</p>
<p>me to aid the Life and Fire Company. I did so, and, I
</p>
<p>believe, to his entire satisfaction. They secured me;
</p>
<p>and is Henry Eckford to be blamed for approving of
</p>
<p>having done for Jacob Barker in 1826 what Jacob
</p>
<p>Barker did for Henry Eckford in 1819 ?
</p>
<p>*'I have now gone through the motley group of
</p>
<p>offences in the indictment, in addition to which, gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the jury, the district attorney, in his opening,
</p>
<p>made some statements which may be deemed worthy of
</p>
<p>notice. Among other things, he said that I went to the
</p>
<p>iron chest of the Life and Fire Company, filled my

<p>pockets with bonds and mortgages, and went ofi" with

<p>them. This allegation I pronounce in all its parts des-

</p>
<p>titute of truth ; and, notwitlistanding the pomp and
</p>
<p>parade with which the district attorney put forth that
</p>
<p>flourish, he has not asked a single witness a word about
</p>
<p>it, although I have more than once lifted up to his re-
</p>
<p>collection the iron chest. The district attorney, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of casting an air of suspicion on my conduct,
</p>
<p>declared that the Mercantile Insurance Company and
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker are one and the same thing ; that Jacob
</p>
<p>Barker had appointed one of his creatures its president ;
</p>
<p>that he had so much of the stock as to regulate the
</p>
<p>election as he pleased ; and that his talk about William
</p>
<p>R. Thurston, or any other of the directors, was a mere
</p>
<p>flourish ; that as to William B. Thurston, he was a mere
</p>
<p>'creature of Jacob Barker,' a 'man of straw' in his
</p>
<p>fingers. On producing testimony of the worth of that
</p>
<p>gentleman, the district attorney admitted him to be a
</p>
<p>gentleman of exemplary conduct, an old inhabitant of
</p>
<p>this city, retired from a long life of commercial pursuits,
</p>
<p>living on the fruits of his industry and economy, and
</p>
<p>worth three hundred thousand dollars. It is not open
</p>
<p>for inquiry ; the district attorney gratuitously admitted
</p>
<p>it, I accepted it; he drove the nail, and I clinched it:
</p>
<p>that point is therefore at rest, but I should like to have
</p>
<p>a few more such men of straw in my fingers.
</p>
<p>"Now, gentlemen of the jury, I have always con-
</p>
<p>sidered a man of straw a very different sort of thing,
</p>
<p>and as I am ignorant of what your notions may be on
</p>
<p>the subject, and do not know of any other rule of judg-
</p>
<p>ment than by comparison, it becomes my duty to describe
</p>
<p>what in my judgment ought to be considered a man in
</p>
<p>the hands of another, viz. : the district attorney is a
</p>
<p>taller man than Jacob Barker, and probably stronger.

</p>
<p>If the testimony furnished by the records of our crimi-
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 113
</p>
<p>nal court is to be believed, the district attorney has had
</p>
<p>a collegiate education, and therefore has learned how to
</p>
<p>string together a great many high-flown and melodious
</p>
<p>words, and by their use to make a great mystery of very
</p>
<p>simple things, and when supported at his nightly meet-
</p>
<p>ings on the one hand by that demon Leavitt, and on
</p>
<p>the other by the grave Cheesbrough, with his argus
</p>
<p>eyes, he trims his midnight lamp, dips his malignant
</p>
<p>pen in gall, and records the hellish deeds to which these
</p>
<p>two preservers of the interests of absent stockholders
</p>
<p>are to swear in court, there Jacob Barker is a man of
</p>
<p>straw, a mere creature, which crumbles into dust in the'
</p>
<p>hands of the district attorney; but when he comes
</p>
<p>forth and meets Jacob Barker by the light of the meri-
</p>
<p>dian sun, before this learned and just court, restrained
</p>
<p>and regulated by the rules of evidence as laid down by
</p>
<p>Philips, to be passed upon by an honest jury, then it is
</p>
<p>that the district attorney is metamorphosed into a man
</p>
<p>of straw, a mere creature in the hands of Jacob Barker,
</p>
<p>and [here extending his arm and contracting his fingers
</p>
<p>in the most impassioned manner] I will crack him all to
</p>
<p>pieces, as I would a pipe-stem  [pausing and gently say-
</p>
<p>ing,] gentlemen of the jury, observe, I do not mean to
</p>
<p>do him any personal harm, no more than the jolly tar
</p>
<p>meant to do to the $20 bank-note, when he on his top-
</p>
<p>lifts went into the Mechanics' Bank and threw it down
</p>
<p>on the counter, exclaiming to the teller, ' There, damn
</p>
<p>you, crack it all to pieces ; I want some shiners that
</p>
<p>will jingle, jingle, jingle,' at the same time patting his
</p>
<p>pocket. Now, I only mean that I will here crack this
</p>
<p>district attorney, this mere man of straw, this creature
</p>
<p>in my fingers, all to pieces, the mere mention of which,
</p>
<p>in connection with the highly-celebrated iron chest, shall

<p>not only jingle, jingle, jingle, at his honor the mayor's
</p>
<p>levees, but at the tea-party of eA^ery lady in town, not
</p>
<p>even excepting that of the lady brought into court by
</p>
<p>the district attorney to detail the social conversations of
</p>
<p>the visitors to the family of her uncle, one of the
</p>
<p>prisoners at the bar.
</p>
<p>" The district attorney stated that Mr. Eckford and
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker had conspired to change the directors of
</p>
<p>the Fulton Bank about the middle of July for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of fraudulently using the funds of that bank, and
</p>
<p>that we had a meeting at the Bank Coffee House for the
</p>
<p>purpose of consummating the fraudulent schemes. Now,
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the jury, you must remember the testi-
</p>
<p>mony which has been adduced in support of this charge.
</p>
<p>The bank had very disastrous dealings. Reports were
</p>
<p>abroad that it had lost half its capital. Being very
</p>
<p>deeply interested in the stock, and feeling that a failure
</p>
<p>of the bank would prove disastrous to the moneyed
</p>
<p>interest of the city, I stated these things to Mr. Eck-
</p>
<p>ford, and he agreed with me in the opinion that the
</p>
<p>interest of the bank required that it should be placed
</p>
<p>under the administration of persons of great respecta-
</p>
<p>bility who resided in the neighborhood. I told him that
</p>
<p>all Brown and Spencer appeared to want was a loan;
</p>
<p>and that he and I, in connection with the bank, had
</p>
<p>better make such loan than for the bank to remain
</p>
<p>lonsier in their hands. He told me to do what I liked in
</p>
<p>the business, and if I lost by the operation he would
</p>
<p>bear one-half thereof. The negotiation was set on foot,
</p>
<p>and it was successful; and Messrs. Spencer, Brown,
</p>
<p>Bathbone, Franklin, McCready, and John Brown did
</p>
<p>resign on that day, and the day following the Bank

</p>
<p>Hazard, Jr., William R. Thurston, Nathan Comstock,
</p>
<p>Barney Corse, and Charles Dickenson were appointed
</p>
<p>to their places. Their respectability, wealth, and intel-
</p>
<p>gence, together with that of William W. Fox, William
</p>
<p>W. Mott, James Lovett, Robert C. Cornell, John R.
</p>
<p>Willis, and John Flack,  all of whom it is in proof that
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker endeavored to induce to accept of seats at
</p>
<p>that Board,  forbid the supposition that any improper
</p>
<p>use was to be made of the funds about to be placed
</p>
<p>under the control of such men.
</p>
<p>" Many of them have testified that Mr. Barker told
</p>
<p>them, when he applied to them to take part in the man-
</p>
<p>agement of the bank, that all he wanted was for them
</p>
<p>to make it a good bank in their own way. Mr. Eckford
</p>
<p>never took part nor lot in forming the new direction, nor
</p>
<p>intermeddled in the business further than to recommend
</p>
<p>to Messrs. Franklin and Rathbone to resign, and to go
</p>
<p>with Mr. Barker to the Bank Coffee House to unite in
</p>
<p>recommending G. W. Brown to do the same thing, and,
</p>
<p>further, to advance some of the money towards the loan
</p>
<p>to the Hudson Insurance Company. If Mr. Eckford
</p>
<p>wanted any influence at that bank, is it probable he
</p>
<p>would have recommended Messrs. Franklin and Rath-
</p>
<p>bone to resign ?
</p>
<p>" The hardship and injustice of this mighty mixture
</p>
<p>of insurance companies, banks, stock-dealers, carpenters,
</p>
<p>bankers, and brokers, are greatly beyond my power of
</p>
<p>description. The district attorney seems to be a great
</p>
<p>proficient in the art of compounding many simples into
</p>
<p>one great mystery; and he seems to have electrified his
</p>
<p>packed audience with the brilliant display of the gigan-

<p>116 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>quality, however, better adapted for an apothecary tlian
</p>
<p>the student of Blackstone and Coke.
</p>
<p>*'I have not, gentlemen of the jury, taken up your
</p>
<p>time in reading or referring to law-books, for a very
</p>
<p>good reason : I never read one in my life, although I
</p>
<p>have looked into many. I did in the early part of this
</p>
<p>trial read half a page from Burke, and I her beg leave
</p>
<p>to recommend to your grave consideration the sentiments
</p>
<p>of that great man, so beautifully expressed : 
</p>
<p>" ' My lords, the Commons wait the issue of this cause
</p>
<p>with trembling solicitude. Twenty-two years have been
</p>
<p>employed in it, seven of which have passed in this trial.
</p>
<p>They behold the dearest interests of their country
</p>
<p>deeply involved in it ; they feel that the very existence
</p>
<p>of this constitution depends upon it. Your lordship's
</p>
<p>justice stands pre-eminent in the world; but it stands
</p>
<p>amidst a vast heap of ruins which surrounds it in every
</p>
<p>corner of Europe. If you slacken justice, and thereby
</p>
<p>weaken the bonds of society, the well-tempered authority
</p>
<p>of this court, which, I trust in God, will continue to the
</p>
<p>end of time, must receive a fatal wound that no balm
</p>
<p>can cure, that no time can restore.
</p>
<p>" 'My lords, it is not the criminality of the prisoner,
</p>
<p>it is not the claims of the Commons to demand judg-
</p>
<p>ment to be passed upon him, it is not the honor and dig-
</p>
<p>nity of this court and the welfare of millions of the
</p>
<p>human race, that alone call upon you. When the de-

<p>vouring flames shall have destroyed this perishing globe
</p>
<p>and it sinks into the abyss of nature from whence it

</p>
<p>justice. It was the attribute of the great God of na-
</p>
<p>ture before worlds were, it will reside with him when
</p>
<p>they perish, and the earthly portion of it, committed to
</p>
<p>your care, is now solemnly deposited in your hands by
</p>
<p>the Commons of England.'
</p>
<p>''The district attorney, in his opening, also told you
</p>
<p>about erasures and false entries in the books of the Life
</p>
<p>and Fire Company. Be this true or false, I had no
</p>
<p>knowledge, part, or lot in it. It is enough for my pur-
</p>
<p>pose to know that the books of the companies in which
</p>
<p>I am employed are kept with marked exactness. I,
</p>
<p>however, beg leave of such of the defendants as are
</p>
<p>interested in that question to say that there is no evi-
</p>
<p>dence of false entries, and that the two cases of erasures
</p>
<p>appear to be a mere correction of a mistake in the
</p>
<p>original entry, and the entries thus corrected, as sworn
</p>
<p>by the receiver in chancery, are as they should be.
</p>
<p>"For the purpose of proving fraud on the bond-
</p>
<p>holders, the district attorney at one moment makes the
</p>
<p>Life and Fire Company utterly insolvent, and in the
</p>
<p>next, for the purpose of proving fraud on the stock-
</p>
<p>holders, he makes out that there is something left for
</p>
<p>them after paying all their debts. He reminds one
</p>
<p>of the expressions of Robinson Crusoe's man Friday
</p>
<p>to his master :  ' You blow to warm your fingers, you
</p>
<p>blow to cool your soup : you blow hot and you blow cold

<p>ever, a broker. I mean no disparagement to the gen-
</p>
<p>118 LIFE OF JACOB BARKEE.
</p>
<p>tlemen who belong to tliat profession. I know many
</p>
<p>of them to be among our most meritorious citizens.
</p>
<p>Many of them are my personal friends, whom I not only
</p>
<p>respect, but love. But I am so described on a sudden for
</p>
<p>a fraudulent purpose. A broker's commission is one-
</p>
<p>fourth of one per cent., while a commercial commission
</p>
<p>is two and a half to five per cent., according to circum-
</p>
<p>stances. I have charged the Life and Fire Insurance
</p>
<p>Company two and a half per cent., and this, for a broker,
</p>
<p>might well be considered a fraud, if it was unaccompa-
</p>
<p>nied with any redeeming explanation, while perfectly fair
</p>
<p>and proper in a commission merchant ; but under what
</p>
<p>circumstances is this made ? Mr. Eckford had rendered
</p>
<p>me great assistance when I was in difficulty, and in re-
</p>
<p>turn he had a right to expect me, when he requested it,
</p>
<p>to give aid to the Life and Fire Insurance Company,
</p>
<p>over which he presided, and in the support of which his
</p>
<p>purse and pride were enlisted.
</p>
<p>''He applied to me to become the agent; I cheerfully
</p>
<p>offered my services. He wished to stipulate for an ade-
</p>
<p>quate compensation ; I declined, and he promised to see
</p>
<p>me paid when it was over. You have seen with what
</p>
<p>fidelity and success I carried on all these negotiations.
</p>
<p>The object for which I embarked was lost in the failure
</p>
<p>of the company, and it then became a mere matter of
</p>
<p>interest. I therefore placed in the account rendered to
</p>
<p>the receivers a commercial commission of two and a half
</p>
<p>per cent., which I think I richly earned; but observe,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, the remarks I made when I delivered the
</p>
<p>account. Mr. Hoffman, one of the receivers, has told
</p>
<p>you, when called as a witness by the district attorney
</p>
<p>on the part of the people, that I stated that the charge

<p>the chancellor, explaining, at the same time, the terms
</p>
<p>on -which I had embarked, and that I considered the
</p>
<p>chancellor, when he should pass on the accounts, to be
</p>
<p>at perfect liberty to reduce or expunge the charge, if he
</p>
<p>should think proper to do so ; and that I should not
</p>
<p>insist on any pay. In consequence of this unexpected
</p>
<p>disclosure of the testimony, you will not hear one word
</p>
<p>from the district attorney about my being a broker, or
</p>
<p>the enormity of the charge, both which would otherwise
</p>
<p>have been most fruitful sources of crimination.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen of the jury, I have already mentioned
</p>
<p>that I had not taken a single note, nor have I read any
</p>
<p>of those taken by others. One of the gentlemen, how-
</p>
<p>ever, has furnished me with a list of the names of the
</p>
<p>witnesses, which will call to my recollection what they
</p>
<p>said; and, so far as I may consider such testimony as
</p>
<p>affecting me, I must examine it, although very unwill-
</p>
<p>ing to trespass so long on your time. These proceed-
</p>
<p>ings against me, gentlemen of the jury, I have more
</p>
<p>than once told you were urged on by the moneyed aris-
</p>
<p>tocracy of Wall Street. They have become desperate.
</p>
<p>They know it is now or never, and that if they do not
</p>
<p>now succeed in destroying Jacob Barker he will polish
</p>
<p>the paving of the vaults of such of the banks as have
</p>
<p>joined in this unholy war.
</p>
<p>" Seixas Nathan.  This witness stated that not one
</p>
<p>dollar was paid to me of the proceeds of the water or
</p>
<p>gas stock sold by him for the Life and Fire Insurance
</p>
<p>Company which had been received from Malapar ; and
</p>
<p>this, gentlemen of the jury, you vrill recollect, the dis-
</p>
<p>trict attorney said most boldly had been ^^ut into my
</p>
<p>pocket by Mr. Nathan.

</p>
<p>120 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>director and one of the finance committee of tlie Morris
</p>
<p>Canal and Banking Company, and that I had acted with
</p>
<p>fidelity, zeal, and capacity in the agency I undertook
</p>
<p>for that bank ; that I did all that was expected of me ;
</p>
<p>that Mr. Eckford was present when he requested my
</p>
<p>assistance, and when I required $5000 commission if
</p>
<p>successful, and if not successful no compensation, and
</p>
<p>that he promised to do all he could to get for me the
</p>
<p>fee, and the minutes of the proceedings of the directors
</p>
<p>of the Morris Canal and Banking Company prove
</p>
<p>that he had unlimited powers conferred on him to con-
</p>
<p>summate this negotiation ; and that after this, and after
</p>
<p>knowing my terms, he urged me to continue to exert
</p>
<p>myself ; that I had, either for myself, or for the Dutchess
</p>
<p>County Insurance Company, lent the Morris Canal and
</p>
<p>Banking Company $5000 for six months, without any
</p>
<p>other compensation than simple interest; and that I
</p>
<p>had not, to his knowledge, directly or indirectly de-
</p>
<p>frauded the Morris Canal Bank.
</p>
<p>" Robert Gilchrist, cashier of the Morris Canal Bank,
</p>
<p>confirmed the statement about the loan of $5000, its
</p>
<p>being yet due, and the return of the $10,000, and stated
</p>
<p>that I had not, to his knowledge, defrauded that bank.
</p>
<p>"Abraham Ogden, Esq., confirmed the statement of
</p>
<p>Mr. Gilchrist, adding that he had not before heard of
</p>
<p>the claim for the $5000, and that he did not think it
</p>
<p>right for me to claim it. Every one who knows Mr.
</p>
<p>Ogden will give full credit to his testimony, so far as
</p>
<p>to good intentions and the facts within his recollection;
</p>
<p>but he, no doubt, has forgotten the circumstance, as

<p>David Leavitt swore that he communicated the fact of

</p>
<p>^' William Bayard, Esq., the assistant president of
</p>
<p>the Morris Canal Bank, confirmed on his oath all my
</p>
<p>statements relative to that bank, so far as they had
</p>
<p>come to his knowledge.
</p>
<p>"A lad seventeen years of age swore that I had bor-
</p>
<p>rowed ten thousand dollars of the Morris Canal Bank ;
</p>
<p>that I had paid it ; that I had lent that bank five thou-
</p>
<p>sand dollars ; that it was yet due me ; but that my con-
</p>
<p>duct had been dishonorable. That he got his informa-
</p>
<p>tion from others ; that he had not seen me, nor heard
</p>
<p>me speak of the transaction to which he alluded, except
</p>
<p>that when Mr. Tallman sent him with part of the money
</p>
<p>to the Dutchess Company he saw me in the ofiice, and
</p>
<p>I pointed out Mr. Halleck, the secretary of that com-
</p>
<p>pany, as the proper person to receive it."*" On being
</p>
<p>asked why he accused me of dishonor, he stated that his
</p>
<p>object was to do away the testimony of Mr. Gilchrist,
</p>
<p>the cashier, who he supposed did not understand the
</p>
<p>subject. I asked him if he heard Mr. Gilchrist give his
</p>
<p>testimony. He said no, but that he had seen David
</p>
<p>Clarkson and Robert L. Reed together. That Mr. Reed
</p>
<p>had told him what Mr. Gilchrist had said, and that Mr.
</p>
<p>Clarkson had sent him to the district attorney to confer
</p>
<p>as to what he should say on the subject, and that he had
</p>
<p>been with the district attorney before to explain as to
</p>
<p>the testimony he was to give on this trial. On being
</p>
<p>questioned further as to his reasons for considering my
</p>
<p>* These $10,000 were in the notes of the Morris Canal Bank : to
</p>
<p>oblige the bank, Mr. Barker undertook to use them in the business
</p>
<p>of the Dutchess Company, so far as should be found convenient.
</p>
<p>Most of them, not having been used, were returned, with the money
</p>
<p>for such as had been used.

</p>
<p>conduct dishonorable, lie stated that Mr. Gilchrist had
</p>
<p>told him that I disputed the payment of a trifling claim
</p>
<p>for interest. He was then reminded of the debt of
</p>
<p>$5000, and asked if the bank could not pay themselves
</p>
<p>the trifling interest-claim out of it. He said no, because
</p>
<p>they had given security. The court then asked, What
</p>
<p>security ? He answered, Morris Canal stock. This last
</p>
<p>fact sufficiently proves that he did not understand what
</p>
<p>he was swearing to, and that he had been a trained wit-
</p>
<p>ness, sent here by the conspirators for my destruction,
</p>
<p>to insult me. Yes, gentlemen of the jury, a beardless
</p>
<p>boy, in the employ of a bank which I had saved from
</p>
<p>insolvency, was sent here to insult the father of twelve
</p>
<p>children. As to the security, the indebtedness of the
</p>
<p>company bound all their stock and effects, and if they
</p>
<p>could not pay the debt the stock was good for nothing.
</p>
<p>What would it avail the holder of a life and fire bond to
</p>
<p>have as security life and fire stock ? The object and
</p>
<p>effect of security is to have something to resort to in
</p>
<p>case the principal fails. The stock, in case of the failure
</p>
<p>of the company, would afford no such resort, any more
</p>
<p>than for a man to endorse his own note would give secu-
</p>
<p>rity for its payment.
</p>
<p>" David Leavitt swore that he had divulged to the
</p>
<p>directors of the Morris Canal Company the communica-
</p>
<p>tion that I had made in confidence to the directors of
</p>
<p>the Fulton Bank about my commissions. He swore that
</p>
<p>he, on behalf of the Fulton Bank, employed Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>to go and loan $20,000 to the Hudson Company, of
</p>
<p>which one-half was to be furnished by, and at the risk

</p>
<p>their difficulties; knowing at that time that the bank
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 123
</p>
<p>had a claim at sight for $163,000 on that company, with
</p>
<p>which he could overwhelm it at any moment, and know-
</p>
<p>ing also that they were on the eve of bankruptcy, and
</p>
<p>that he, a day or two before, had got all their securities
</p>
<p>that were considered of any value ; the whole of which
</p>
<p>he preserved a death-like secret from me.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, you saw how he winced and claimed
</p>
<p>protection from the court when I attempted to make
</p>
<p>him tell his connection with Malapar, and the white-lead
</p>
<p>works, and the marble bonds. You heard him ask me
</p>
<p>'if I expected him to impeach himself;' and because I
</p>
<p>could not help telling him that 4ie had already done it/
</p>
<p>this honorable court was greatly offended, and required
</p>
<p>me to promise to appear before them when this trial was
</p>
<p>over and answer for the offence. You saw how he pre-
</p>
<p>varicated and attempted to evade my every question put
</p>
<p>with the view, the single view, of wringing from him the
</p>
<p>secrets of his heart; and I am greatly indebted to the
</p>
<p>unexampled skill and success of Mr. Williams, counsel
</p>
<p>for the other defendants in* this case, in eliciting from
</p>
<p>him what I had failed to make him acknowledge. When
</p>
<p>this man first heard of my indictment, he clapped his
</p>
<p>hands, roared out a loud laugh in the presence of all the
</p>
<p>clerks in the bank, jumped over a bench standing by his
</p>
<p>side, and spun round in a joyous delirium at the pros-
</p>
<p>pect of glutting his vengeance. Not content with the
</p>
<p>mischief done me, he calls on that venerable gentleman,
</p>
<p>[pointing to Mr. Hazard,] whose head has been whitened
</p>
<p>wdth the snow of nearly seventy winters, and tells him
</p>
<p>that his son-in-law, Jacob Barker, was very much de-
</p>
<p>pressed and dispirited about this indictment. Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the jury, I put it to you to say whether I either look

<p>like, or have acted in any part of the trial like, a de-
</p>
<p>124 LIFE or JACOB BAEKER.
</p>
<p>pressed and dispirited man, one overwhelmed with con-
</p>
<p>scious guilt. Please look at me, gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>and say on your oaths whether or not you think any
</p>
<p>man could with truth have thus characterized me. But
</p>
<p>suppose it had been so, and that David Leavitt^ a hypo-
</p>
<p>critical professor, had known it : was it kind, was it fair.
</p>
<p>was it manly, for him to disturb the happiness of such a
</p>
<p>man as Mr. Hazard, and such a family as his, with the
</p>
<p>relation of the dishonor of a branch of that family ? No ;
</p>
<p>such conduct could not have emanated from any feeling
</p>
<p>but the most diabolical spirit of malignancy. He swore,
</p>
<p>on this trial, to state all the facts he knew ; in place of
</p>
<p>which he travelled out of the record to insult a prisoner
</p>
<p>at the bar, by swearing he had committed a fraud, with-
</p>
<p>out telling in what particular ; and, when he came to be
</p>
<p>cross-examined by that prisoner in person, it turned out
</p>
<p>that he, Leavitt, and not I, had committed the fraud.
</p>
<p>He swore that the negotiation for the return of Morris
</p>
<p>Canal stock was not completed, because Jacob Barker
</p>
<p>flew from his bargain. On fhe cross-examination it was
</p>
<p>proved that it was Leavitt, and not Barker, who had
</p>
<p>flown from the bargain, and, besides, that he had been
</p>
<p>treacherous to his associate directors in the business. He
</p>
<p>swore that Barker had nothing to do with the final close
</p>
<p>of the barcrain. On the cross-examination it turned out
</p>
<p>that Jacob Barker was the very pivot on which it turned.
</p>
<p>He swore fraud in the lump against an individual, and
</p>
<p>detailed facts which, if true, made that individual carry
</p>
<p>off half the capital of the bank ; and, at the very close
</p>
<p>of these denunciations, he swore that that individual had
</p>
<p>not intended to do any wrong. He swore that he had
</p>
<p>communicated to Clarkson the secrets of the bank, in

<p>violation of the resolution of the directors, and thus en-
</p>

</p>
<p>abled Clarkson, as he swore he did, to palm off upon me
</p>
<p>a large amount of stock at eighty which was only worth
</p>
<p>twenty-five. He, Leavitt, swore that my check received
</p>
<p>from Davis was only $1000 or $1200, when it was
</p>
<p>proved to be for $12,757 50. Yes, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, the man who swore fraud against me made all
</p>
<p>these false statements, and further admitted, on his
</p>
<p>cross-examination, the corrupt bargain he made with
</p>
<p>Mr. Cheesbrough ; that the bank paid eleven-tvfelfths of
</p>
<p>$2000 of the $6000 bonus, pui-suant to the terms of a
</p>
<p>resolution of the directors; every line of w^hich, when
</p>
<p>taken in connection with the deed it affected to hide
</p>
<p>from all the other dii^ectors, carries fraud, falsehood,
</p>
<p>and deception on the face of it. The residue of this
</p>
<p>bonus, say $4000, this Leavitt swore he paid to Chees-
</p>
<p>brough; that he received back $2000 of it from Mark
</p>
<p>Spencer; that Mr. Spencer was to be reimbursed for it
</p>
<p>by interest on overdrawings ; that he ordered the clerk
</p>
<p>of the bank to pay Mr. Spencer's checks for $68,000,
</p>
<p>without funds and without security, and to keep these
</p>
<p>checks in his drawer for three weeks, by which means
</p>
<p>his account did not appear overdi-awn ; and the facts of
</p>
<p>the case were thus hid from the directors, and Leavitt
</p>
<p>enabled to pocket these two thousand dollars interest-
</p>
<p>money received from Mr. Spencer, without appearing to
</p>
<p>rob the bank. He tells you, further, that he intended
</p>
<p>also to have got the other two thousand dollars from the
</p>
<p>vaults of the bank, but by what new device or fraud he
</p>
<p>did not vouchsafe to tell you.
</p>
<p>" The iniquity of this man does not end here. After
</p>
<p>having, under the guise of paying a president, and that
</p>
<p>in advance too, for his most faithful services until April,

<p>passage of that resolution, and from that time he him-
</p>
<p>self to have an equal salary from the stockholders, who
</p>
<p>had already lost almost their last dollar by the conduct
</p>
<p>of these rapacious men. But, finding himself disap-
</p>
<p>pointed in his election as president, he again resorts to
</p>
<p>bargaining, and agreed with Mr. Brown, if he would
</p>
<p>vote for his election, that he would allow him to receive
</p>
<p>the whole salary for one year.
</p>
<p>" The $68,000 before alluded to will be lost to the
</p>
<p>bank, if the stockholders do not enforce their legal
</p>
<p>rights against David Leavitt's personal property. How
</p>
<p>did the accounts stand during Mr. Cheesbrough's admi-
</p>
<p>nistration? Why, the Hudson Company and its presi-
</p>
<p>dent were in the habit of drawing through the day for
</p>
<p>what money they wanted, making the account good at
</p>
<p>three o'clock. In place of which, David Leavitt, as
</p>
<p>soon as he was elected president, according to his own
</p>
<p>account, orders the checks to be paid and not charged,
</p>
<p>but to be kept hid in the drawers for three weeks, to
</p>
<p>enable him to get his $2000 interest without being de-
</p>
<p>tected, and that too to the amount of $68,000, without
</p>
<p>a particle of security; and thus the Hudson Company
</p>
<p>and its president were released from all obligation to
</p>
<p>make deposits at three o'clock, or at any other time be-
</p>
<p>fore the expiration of three v,^eeks; and- before that
</p>
<p>time the Hudson Company and its president failed.

<p>^'Here, gentlemen of tlie jury, I have given you a

<p>this is the man who dared to swear fraud against me,

<p>and that I had paid him for it ; and he exultingly said,
</p>
<p>'You lost greatly by the bargain;' but he did not say
</p>
<p>that David Leavitt had communicated to him the disas-
</p>
<p>ters of the bank by which the value of the stock was
</p>
<p>reduced to twenty-five per cent., and that this enabled

<p>him to shave Mr. Barker. At the same time, gentle-

<p>men of the jury, when one David was, by his own oath,

<p>in constant communication with the other David about
</p>
<p>the secrets of the bank, he was, by the oath of Mr.

<p>Nevins, very reserved in his communications to that
</p>
<p>gentleman about the business of the bank. Mr. Clark-

<p>son also swore that when one hundred of those shares

</p>
<p>refused to take them, supposing they were part of the

</p>
<p>did paj $2000 on account, pursuant to agreement, and
</p>
<p>promised the balance in four days,  at the expiration
</p>
<p>of which he again refused, when some very hard words
</p>
<p>passed between us ; immediately after he sent his part-
</p>
<p>ner to me with an apology, and a thousand dollars on
</p>
<p>account, as a pledge of his sincerity. He further stated
</p>
<p>that the subject was before the grand jury, (gentlemen,
</p>
<p>observe, the grand jury which refused to find a bill
</p>
<p>against me,) when he refused com^plying with the terms
</p>
<p>of adjustment stipulated at the termination of his first
</p>
<p>dispute, no doubt, in the hope that the grand jury would
</p>
<p>furnish him with an excuse for not paying, by finding a
</p>
<p>bill against me. Mr. Clarkson, on his oath, admitted
</p>
<p>that he had refused to pay for fifty shares of Fulton
</p>
<p>Bank stock purchased of me, because they were a part
</p>
<p>of the two thousand shares received by the Life and
</p>
<p>Fire Company in exchange for Morris Canal and Bank-
</p>
<p>ing Company stock, which exchange he denominated a.
</p>
<p>swindling transaction, and that I had instituted a suit
</p>
<p>against him for the recovery thereof; therefore he must
</p>
<p>think if you should award the transaction fraudulent, it
</p>
<p>will insure him success against the pending suit for
</p>
<p>those fifty shares. A most disinterested witness, truly,
</p>
<p>to give testimony on this trial ! If this was a suit for
</p>
<p>five dollars, the testimony of such a witness would not
</p>
<p>be taken ; yet in a suit where every thing dear to man is
</p>
<p>at issue, we are not allowed to put forth that plea.

</p>
<p>clerk of the Mechanics' Bank, proved the check of Jacob
</p>
<p>Barker, received by Mr. Leavitt from Mr. Davis, to
</p>
<p>have been $12,757 50, on the 6th July; and this check,
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the jury, you will please to take notice,
</p>
<p>Leavitt swore was for only $1000 or $1200, although
</p>
<p>he never received but one check, perfectly recollected
</p>
<p>it, and the day on which he received it, and urged the
</p>
<p>smallness of the amount as an excuse for what he wished
</p>
<p>to make criminal in the clerks. When he swore to the
</p>
<p>amount, you must remember that I rose and cautioned
</p>
<p>him to be careful and to reflect ; that I meant to tax his
</p>
<p>recollection severely ; that I should hold him answerable
</p>
<p>for the mistake if he made any, and that, if he did not
</p>
<p>remember, he had nothing to do but to say so. He still
</p>
<p>persisted in averring that it was only for $1000 or
</p>
<p>$1200. Using the mildest terms, how frail was his re-
</p>
<p>collection ! and what reliance can you place on any part
</p>
<p>of his testimony?
</p>
<p>"I never entered into an association for purchasing a
</p>
<p>controlling influence over but one bank ; and that was
</p>
<p>several years past, in relation to the North River Bank,
</p>
<p>and for the most praiseworthy purposes. In that case,
</p>
<p>myself and my associates purchased and paid the money
</p>
<p>for a majority of the stock, and were opposed by those
</p>
<p>who held their stock by virtue of stock notes to the bank
</p>
<p>itself; and yet we brought such a hornets' nest about
</p>
<p>our ears, that we were glad to accept the first good offer
</p>
<p>and sell out, since which I have been well pleased to
</p>
<p>keep clear of such scrapes.

<p>humble myself to commissioners or directors, but I go

</p>
<p>every citizen, viz. to purchase and pay for as much or
</p>
<p>as little stock as I please, without holding myself ac-
</p>
<p>countable to a human being therefor.
</p>
<p>"John I. Boyd swore that I met him on Sunday
</p>
<p>morning and inquired the news; that he told me the
</p>
<p>Tradesmen's Bank had been enjoined; that I replied,
</p>
<p>* This is no news : I heard it at Bloomingdale last even-
</p>
<p>ing;' that I told him it would be a very serious thing
</p>
<p>for one of the city banks to stop payment, that there
</p>
<p>was no knowing where it would stop ; that he should go
</p>
<p>and see the president, and that they had better consult
</p>
<p>Mr. Catlin, Mr. Eckford, and others on the business,
</p>
<p>and that I would go to my office and wait two hours,
</p>
<p>where he, Mr. Boyd, might apply in case he could make
</p>
<p>me useful. And here is an attempt to. make it a crime
</p>
<p>in Jacob Barker to have heard in the evening, four miles
</p>
<p>in the country, a matter of fact known to the whole city
</p>
<p>early in the afternoon; a fact of such vast importance
</p>
<p>to the city and to the nation, and which related so im-
</p>
<p>mediately to the business in which he was very exten-
</p>
<p>sively engaged.
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen of the jury, if Jacob Barker had not
</p>
<p>known it that evening, the public would have considered
</p>
<p>him totally unworthy of the high reputation they had
</p>
<p>awarded him for keeping, as the sailors say, 'a bright
</p>
<p>look-out.'

</p>
<p>commerce of the country. It is like the heart of man,
</p>
<p>through which the blood from every extremity of the
</p>
<p>body has to circulate. Then, I ask you, was the solici-
</p>
<p>tude manifested by Jacob Barker, on the happening of
</p>
<p>what was likely to shock the fabric on which the finances
</p>
<p>of the nation depended, strange,  so strange as to war-
</p>
<p>rant the conclusion that he was a guilty conspirator ?
</p>
<p>Had he been interested in the bank, would not his own
</p>
<p>vanity, the confidence he feels in his own ability to con-
</p>
<p>duct a difiicult affair, have led him into the heat of the
</p>
<p>battle ? Would he not have done as he did at the Ful-
</p>
<p>ton Bank,  rushed into the thickest of it, placed himself
</p>
<p>in the front ranks, pledged his own money and stock,
</p>
<p>and exhorted the directors to save the bank from ruin ?
</p>
<p>But he goes quietly to his ofiice, promising to wait two
</p>
<p>hours, to be called on by Mr. Boyd, if he could be made
</p>
<p>useful: perhaps he wanted another $5000 fee.
</p>
<p>"In relation to the Fulton Bank and the Tradesmen's
</p>
<p>Bank, Mr. Barker's conduct was as different as the
</p>
<p>interest he felt in the two institutions ; and, although
</p>
<p>directly opposite, you, gentlemen of the jury, are called
</p>
<p>upon to construe both alike as evidence of a guilty con-
</p>
<p>spiracy.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Boyd tells you also that he was in the constant
</p>
<p>habit of consulting Mr. Barker about various branches
</p>
<p>of business ; that he held the opinions of Mr. Barker in
</p>
<p>high estimation, and that Mr. Barker always gave them
</p>
<p>freely and fearlessly, regardless of the consequences to
</p>
<p>himself or to others. Mr. Boyd also confirmed the state-
</p>
<p>ment about his plan for harmonizing the difficulties in
</p>
<p>relation to the Tradesmen's Bank, and stated that so far
</p>
<p>from considering it a secret, or myself interested, I jo-

</p>
<p>man Thorne, one of the disputants whom we happened
</p>
<p>to meet at the time, whereupon Mr. Boyd upbraided me
</p>
<p>for letting out his secrets. Mr. Boyd also swore that
</p>
<p>nothing had happened at any time, either before or after
</p>
<p>the election, that led him to suppose I had any interest
</p>
<p>or agency in the purchase of the bank.
</p>
<p>"I do not mean, gentlemen of the jury, to be under-
</p>
<p>stood, by the zeal manifested to rid myself from all sus-
</p>
<p>picion of being a participator therein, as subscribing to
</p>
<p>the doctrine that I had not as much right to purchase
</p>
<p>stock in the Tradesmen's Bank as any other stock. But,
</p>
<p>as the truth is that I had not any concern therein, I feel
</p>
<p>it my duty to have the whole truth set before you. Pur-
</p>
<p>chasers of public stock owe the stockholders no other
</p>
<p>duty than the common duty of being good citizens. Not
</p>
<p>so with the sellers in this case : they were directors, and
</p>
<p>became possessed of the power to control the bank prin-
</p>
<p>cipally by using its funds to buy up a majority of the
</p>
<p>stock. Whether this was right or wrong is not now the
</p>
<p>subject of inquiry; but it was certainly wrong to dispose
</p>
<p>of the control of the bank thus acquired to any person,
</p>
<p>and especially to an unhnown purchaser, without con-
</p>
<p>sulting the stockholders, whose money they had been
</p>
<p>thus diverting from legitimate banking to the acquisition
</p>
<p>of such power, and whose funds were thus to be set
</p>
<p>adrift, without compass or chart, while their own stock
</p>
<p>was most carefully withdrawn, and a bonus or prepaium
</p>
<p>of $84,000 obtained for the exclusive benefit of the sell-
</p>
<p>ing directors. I say, this was most certainly wrong.
</p>
<p>When I first heard of the sale, which was first mentioned
</p>
<p>to me by B. F. Butler, Esq., who had accidentally heard
</p>
<p>it in Wall Street, I exclaimed, 'If Jacob Barker had

<p>Q
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the jury, I do not mean to say that the
</p>
<p>professional or other men concerned in this sale supposed
</p>
<p>they were doing wrong : such a thing never entered
</p>
<p>their heads. Their whole life, and the faithful discharge
</p>
<p>of their judicial and official duties in the situations
</p>
<p>which some of them have so long and faithfully filled,
</p>
<p>forbid such a supposition; but they were deluded and
</p>
<p>captivated with the boon held up to their view, and a
</p>
<p>profit of 84,000 by a single bank speculation could not
</p>
<p>be resisted. They had heard of Lawton's, of Prime's,
</p>
<p>and of Garniss's splendid speculations, and wished to
</p>
<p>figure a little in the financial world ; and, having studied
</p>
<p>^ Coke upon Littleton,' more than they had 'Smith's
</p>
<p>Wealth of Nations,' they considered only their legal
</p>
<p>rights over the stock, forgetting at the moment their
</p>
<p>duty to the widow and orphan, of Avhose rights they had
</p>
<p>become the legal guardians. So bent were they on se-
</p>
<p>curing the prize, that about the very day of the election
</p>
<p>they distrusted the commissioners appointed by them-
</p>
<p>selves to superintend the election, and, without any fault
</p>
<p>on the part of those commissioners, ingloriously dis-
</p>
<p>missed them, and appointed others more likely to, con-
</p>
<p>summate their wishes. One of their own number resigned
</p>
<p>his seat as a director for the purpose of becoming one of
</p>
<p>those inspectors, and absolutely performed the ceremony
</p>
<p>in such a manner as the Supreme Court has since passed
</p>
<p>condemnation upon. Yet most of these men escape the
</p>
<p>notice of the district attorney further than to be brought
</p>
<p>here to aid him in the unholy work of destroying me for
</p>
<p>daring to tell them of their errors, and for having, as
</p>
<p>before stated, protected all the institutions intrusted to
</p>
<p>my care.

</p>
<p>to my prejudice, has not left any stone unturned. He
</p>
<p>sent an oiEcer to bring a sick man from Flushing to say
</p>
<p>that I had told him last October or November that I
</p>
<p>considered the Life and Fire bonds good, that I repeated
</p>
<p>the same thing to him in April or May, and that I was
</p>
<p>profiting by their purchase and supposed that he could
</p>
<p>not do a better business, and not that I offered to sell
</p>
<p>him any, either as principal or agent.
</p>
<p>"If the district attorney had asked me, I would have
</p>
<p>admitted that I should, had I been consulted, have ex-
</p>
<p>pressed every day in the year the same strong confi-
</p>
<p>dence, down to five days prior to the failure of the com-
</p>
<p>pany. That was my opinion; and I have never been
</p>
<p>known to disguise or withhold my opinion on any sub-
</p>
<p>ject. Mr. Nevins has also been called to say the same
</p>
<p>thing. To me it is astonishing, considering the pains
</p>
<p>the district attorney has taken, that he could not find
</p>
<p>more than two persons to say that I had intermeddled
</p>
<p>further with this branch of the business. Much stress is
</p>
<p>laid on the terms I used to convey the confidence I felt.
</p>
<p>These two witnesses say, I said I knew ; I have no re-
</p>
<p>collection of having used that word ; I meant to convey
</p>
<p>the most implicit confidence, and may have used it, but
</p>
<p>I never did intend to convey the idea that I had any
</p>
<p>other knowledge than that derived from the representa-
</p>
<p>tions of the ofiicers of the company. I believed, and yet
</p>
<p>believe, they were all sincere in their representations,
</p>
<p>and I cannot think myself culpable for confiding therein.
</p>
<p>Neither witness intimated that he supposed I meant
</p>
<p>any thing beyond what I have here stated, nor do I be-
</p>
<p>Jieve such a thought ever entered their heads; neither

<p>purchased in consequence of my recommendation; nei-

</p>
<p>frauded. And what better proof can you have that no
</p>
<p>evidence can be found against me, than the shifts to
</p>
<p>which the district attorney resorts in collecting together
</p>
<p>these straws and feathers 4ight as air,' on which to erect
</p>
<p>a fabric of guilt ? My principal offence appears to have
</p>
<p>been in inspiring confidence by purcTiasing, not selling,
</p>
<p>those bonds. Are not Colonel Fish, his broker, and all
</p>
<p>other purchasers alike chargeable with the same sin, if
</p>
<p>a sin it be? No one thinks of indicting, much less of
</p>
<p>convicting, either of them for a conspiracy, because they
</p>
<p>purchased and paid for those bonds, anymore than they
</p>
<p>do of indicting or convicting David Clarkson, or the
</p>
<p>numerous persons who had Fulton Bank stock trans-
</p>
<p>ferred to them, which they advanced money on, sold, paid
</p>
<p>for, or purchased, as best suited their pleasure or conve-
</p>
<p>nience. Thus, what is considered perfectly innocent in
</p>
<p>others is to be considered a crime in me.
</p>
<p>^'I beg you to remember that all my transactions
</p>
<p>with the Life and Fire Company have been of the most
</p>
<p>simple character, down to the day of the failure, when
</p>
<p>they appointed me their attorney in fact, to make certain
</p>
<p>collections for them. Since then my conduct has not
</p>
<p>been called in question. First, I lent them money.
</p>
<p>Second, I sold for them 1500 shares Fulton Bank stock,
</p>
<p>the account of w^hich the district attorney was pleased
</p>
<p>to say he had not the least doubt was correct, when he
</p>
<p>introduced it as evidence. And I did, at the instance of
</p>
<p>one of their directors, Mr. Rathbone, give an obligation
</p>
<p>to deliver Mr. Gouverneur five hundred shares Trades-
</p>
<p>men's Bank stock, which obligation was promptly ful-
</p>
<p>filled. It was given in consequence of the Western Com-

<p>connection with the Life and Fire Insurance Company ;
</p>
<p>and I would ask you to say, in the sincerity of your
</p>
<p>hearts, if I had not a perfect right to do all these things,
</p>
<p>without subjecting myself to the charge of impropriety
</p>
<p>of conduct or intention.

<p>"Several witnesses testified that I had been in the
</p>
<p>habit of regulating the price of the bonds of the Life and

<p>Fire Lisurance Company ; but, on being cross-examined,
</p>
<p>they all admitted that they only meant that the exten-
</p>
<p>sive purchases made by me disappointed them in a por-
</p>
<p>tion of the profits they would have got had I not been a
</p>
<p>competitor in the market. Hence the hostility of the

</p>
<p>by me at the boy being sent here from the Morris Canal

<p>bank from ruin. And if I should put my threat, to dis-
</p>
<p>miss that bank from Wall Street, into prompt and full

<p>effect, Avho would blame m.e? Should I not be perform-
</p>
<p>ing the duty of a good citizen? Has it not been abun-

<p>Kevins say that he had reasons for thinking I kne^v
</p>
<p>about the affairs of the Life and Fire ComjDanj, when
</p>
<p>he expressly swore that he had not any other reason for
</p>
<p>thinking so than the freedom with which I purchased the
</p>
<p>bonds, and the confidence I expressed in their goodness.
</p>
<p>"It has been attempted to urge as a crime the high
</p>
<p>fees I charge. Let it be remembered that it has been
</p>
<p>proved that I work at any time, and at all times, for my
</p>
<p>acquaintances when required to do so, without price or
</p>
<p>pay, and with equal zeal and fidelity as if I were to re-
</p>
<p>ceive the highest commission. And let it be always re-
</p>
<p>membered that every man has a right to fix his own
</p>
<p>price on his own property, and that a man's faculties are
</p>
<p>his property, as much as his horse or his barrel of sugar.
</p>
<p>It is the very law" of our nature to require pay for our
</p>
<p>labor. No one has been invited to employ me ; and those
</p>
<p>who have were told my terms at the commencement, and
</p>
<p>not surprised into a large claim after the service had

<p>been performed.

</p>
<p>1823, a bond for $2000, payable in tliree years. That
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker held it until May, 1826, when he returned
</p>
<p>it to the office and took in exchange for it two bonds,
</p>
<p>each for $1000, bearing equal date with the original
</p>
<p>bond, and payable on the same day that it became pay-
</p>
<p>able ; and it is hardly necessary for pie to tell you that
</p>
<p>nothing is more common in the mercantile world than
</p>
<p>when a note is found too large, to have it divided, pre-
</p>
<p>serving the original date and time ; and would it be
</p>
<p>fraudulent to return a hundred-dollar bank-note to the
</p>
<p>bank that had issued it, and take in lieu thereof two
</p>
<p>notes of fifty dollars each, or one hundred one-dollar
</p>
<p>notes, because these new notes bore the same date with
</p>
<p>the one-hundred-dollar bill given in exchange for them ?
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, my losses in foreign business, together
</p>
<p>with the money due from the Government, were the
</p>
<p>causes of the misfortunes of the Exchange Bank in
</p>
<p>1819 : since that time I have labored, and that too with
</p>
<p>great success, for the payment of the debts of that bank
</p>
<p>and of the Washington and Warren Bank. The debts
</p>
<p>of the latter were all paid, and its credit re-established,
</p>
<p>more than two years ago, and the Exchange Bank notes
</p>
<p>are nearly all redeemed from my new earnings.
</p>
<p>^' Gentlemen, if I am to be convicted, I pray that it
</p>
<p>may be for something you understand ; that you do not
</p>
<p>allow a mystery so wrought up to induce you to infer
</p>
<p>fraud on account of such mystery. I have been deno-
</p>
<p>minated a mysterious man,  the most mysterious man
</p>
<p>of the age. It has been so published in the daily papers.
</p>
<p>Prcy'udicial as such a character may be, 'there is to be

<p>powers, and so great a share of vanity has fallen to my
</p>
<p>140 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>lot that I would plead gnilty to tliat charge if I were to be
</p>
<p>the only suiFerer. But, as it may operate against the
</p>
<p>other defendants as well as all those connected with me
</p>
<p>by blood or feeling, I cannot consent to feast alone on
</p>
<p>that delicate morsel, knowing as I do that no one else
</p>
<p>can share with me in its delusive enjoyment. Therefore,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, I deny, boldly deny, that there is any mys-
</p>
<p>tery about me, and I put it to you to decide whether
</p>
<p>every thing that has come out has not been of the most
</p>
<p>frank, open, and candid character. Has there been the
</p>
<p>least appearance of trick, artifice, or device in a single
</p>
<p>one of the many transactions which have come under
</p>
<p>your notice on this trial ? Have I not told every witness
</p>
<p>to tell all he knew, as well as all he believed? Has not
</p>
<p>my conduct throughout sustained the first declaration I
</p>
<p>made ?  ' Let everything come out ; if I have been guilty,
</p>
<p>let the world know it.' History tells us that the Qua-
</p>
<p>kers were once put to death in our own country, on ac-
</p>
<p>count of the mysteries of their religion, and that in all
</p>
<p>ages religious sects of every denomination have, in turn,
</p>
<p>fallen victims to the dominant church on account of the
</p>
<p>mysteries of their religion. Every thing not understood
</p>
<p>by short-sighted men was considered as evidence of an
</p>
<p>evil spirit, and made the pretext for putting the inno-
</p>
<p>cent and the unofi"ending believer to death, for the
</p>
<p>single reason that he attended to the manifestations of
</p>
<p>truth in his own mind.
</p>
<p>"Now, I trust in God that those days of darkness
</p>
<p>and delusion, those days of murder and rapine, have
</p>
<p>passed away, and that they are not to be brought back
</p>
<p>in this enlightened age, and under our happy form of
</p>
<p>government, when it is our pride and boast that the

</p>
<p>human mind has been emancipated, and that reason and
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 141
</p>
<p>justice reign triumphantly, as well in our courts of law
</p>
<p>and justice as in our legislative halls and sanctuaries of
</p>
<p>religion. Again, I repeat, if I am to be convicted, let
</p>
<p>it be for something you understand, and not because the
</p>
<p>district attorney may so envelope in mystery and dark-
</p>
<p>ness any particular transaction that you cannot clearly
</p>
<p>see its purity.
</p>
<p>" My negotiations have been with Mr. Eckford. I
</p>
<p>am not conscious of meriting the censure of any one,
</p>
<p>but, on the contrary, consider myself entitled to the
</p>
<p>praise of 'well done, good and faithful servant.' Be
</p>
<p>that as it may, I hope that Mr. Eckford will not be
</p>
<p>made to suJBfer for any errors of mine, if errors there
</p>
<p>have been. If so, it will be more painful to me than all
</p>
<p>I have suffered or may suffer.
</p>
<p>" And here I beg leave to ask. Who is Henry Eckford ?
</p>
<p>Is he a needy adventurer? Is he a stock-speculator
</p>
<p>and a schemer ? No, gentlemen : he is a man who, by
</p>
<p>his mechanical skill, industry, and enterprise, has
</p>
<p>raised the character of our country. Within the last
</p>
<p>year he has built, fitted out, and equipped four sixty-
</p>
<p>four-gun ships. He has been the means of bringing
</p>
<p>nearly two millions of dollars into this country ; not,
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the jury, the fruits of stock-jobbing and
</p>
<p>other speculations, but of honest industry. It has been
</p>
<p>earned by the hewer and feller of timber, the ship-car-
</p>
<p>penter, the smith, and artisans in general. This money
</p>
<p>is the fruit of such enterprise as no mechanic has ever
</p>
<p>before displayed. In his case you have heard of no
</p>
<p>exorbitant commissions, no disputes with agents, no
</p>
<p>quarrels with foreign Governments, no revising to settle
</p>
<p>differences, nor any compromise by which one ship was

</p>
<p>to be sacrificed for the other. Who, I ask again, is
</p>
<p>142 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>Henry Eckford ? He is tlie same who, during the late
</p>
<p>war, when the storm howled along the frontier, built
</p>
<p>our fleets,  those fleets which led to victory and covered
</p>
<p>the nation with glory. This is the man, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>whom it is sought to immolate. And who, gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the jury, may I be allowed to ask, is Jacob Barker ?
</p>
<p>He is the man who,  and it is a matter of historic
</p>
<p>record,  during the darkest periods of that war, fur-
</p>
<p>nished the sinews of that war. He furnished the
</p>
<p>money without which those fleets could never have
</p>
<p>been equipped, without which the army could not have
</p>
<p>been fed or clothed, and without which even the bounty
</p>
<p>to the recruits could not have been paid. It was not
</p>
<p>all his own money, gentlemen ; but when the rich and
</p>
<p>fearful drew close their purse-strings, Jacob Barker, by
</p>
<p>the exercise of that talent for which he is here
</p>
<p>arraigned, brought capitalists together, and eff'ected
</p>
<p>arrangements by which five millions were cast into the
</p>
<p>treasury. Such ivas Jacob Barker during that memo-
</p>
<p>rable period ; such is the man who has now been
</p>
<p>arraigned here by a combination of rogues, who would
</p>
<p>run away by the light of the funeral pile upon which
</p>
<p>they would be happy to see him consumed.
</p>
<p>"Whether the conspiracies alleged in the bill of in-
</p>
<p>dictment have taken place or not, or whether the frauds
</p>
<p>have been committed or not, has nothing to do with my
</p>
<p>defence, so long as I had not the least participation
</p>
<p>therein. Hence it follows that the district attorney
</p>
<p>must request you to acquit me without leaving your
</p>
<p>seats, or he must expect you to convict me for having
</p>
<p>sold fifteen l;yindred shares Eulton Bank stock for
</p>
<p>account of the Life and Fire Insurance Company, and

</p>
<p>accounting therefor to the satisfaction of all parties ;
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 143
</p>
<p>for having, as the assistant president of the Western
</p>
<p>Insurance Company, advanced money on eight hundred
</p>
<p>shares of Tradesmen's Bank stock, and given them
</p>
<p>back in exchange for other securities, at the instance
</p>
<p>of the persons for whom they were received ; for having,
</p>
<p>in the most honorable manner, effected the most salutary
</p>
<p>change in the direction of the Fulton Bank ; for having,
</p>
<p>by the loan of all the money I could raise, endeavored
</p>
<p>to save from insolvency the Life and Fire Insurance
</p>
<p>Company, or for having preserved from failure the
</p>
<p>Morris Canal and Banking Company, and also the
</p>
<p>Fulton Bank. This I aver to be what I have done in
</p>
<p>the premises, and that there is not a particle of testi-
</p>
<p>mony to connect me with any of the frauds complained
</p>
<p>of, nor could there with truth have been any such
</p>
<p>evidence, as I had not the least connection therewith.
</p>
<p>But you have seen other conspiracies on the part of
</p>
<p>my accusers brought to light in the course of this
</p>
<p>tedious investigation, viz. : 
</p>
<p>"To get possession of the Morris Canal and Banking
</p>
<p>Company, through the instrumentality of the $40,000
</p>
<p>post note of the Phoenix Bank.
</p>
<p>"To cheat me more than once in the appointment of
</p>
<p>directors for the Fulton Bank.
</p>
<p>" To apply the funds of the bank to the private pur-
</p>
<p>poses of the two presidents.
</p>
<p>" To induce me to loan money to a company known
</p>
<p>to be insolvent.
</p>
<p>"To palm off on me Fulton Bank stock to a ruinous
</p>
<p>amount at eighty, by some of its directors and their
</p>
<p>associates, after they knew of the recent^ losses of the
</p>
<p>bank.

<p>It was now ten o'clock, when Mr. B. informed the

<p>court that he was very much exhausted, and asked an

<p>adjournment. The court refused, saying his argument

<p>not to occupy the court more than ten or fifteen minutes

<p>EXTRACT FROM THE SPEECH OF BENJAMIN F.
</p>
<p>BUTLER, ESQ.
</p>
<p>Benjamin F. Butler, Esq., made a very lucid and
</p>
<p>logical closing speech ; among other things, he said,- 
</p>
<p>^'It is known to jou, gentlemen of the jury, that I
</p>
<p>was introduced into this cause, and have hitherto
</p>
<p>appeared in it, as one of the counsel associated in the
</p>
<p>defence of Mr. Eckford ; my learned associates will
</p>
<p>render him all the aid his case requires, and with his
</p>
<p>consent I have yielded to the request of Mr. Barker to
</p>
<p>present his case ; you will therefore consider me as
</p>
<p>addressing you exclusively in his behalf, and you will
</p>
<p>consider him in thus committing his defence to a junior
</p>
<p>counsel, and that counsel a stranger, as giving the
</p>
<p>highest evidence he could give of his confidence in the
</p>
<p>justness of his cause, and in the intelligence and impar-
</p>
<p>tiality of those by whom it is to be decided. In that
</p>
<p>confidence, I can truly say, I fully participate ; yet it
</p>
<p>would be aftectation to deny that I enter on the duty
</p>
<p>assigned me with the liveliest solicitude. Not that I
</p>
<p>have found any thing in all that mass of testimony that
</p>
<p>has been laid before you to shake my faith in the inno-
</p>
<p>cence of my client. No, 'tis neither the evidence nor
</p>
<p>the learned counsel by whom it is to be enforced that I

<p>fear. I have other and more formidable antagonists.

<p>terested men,  ^men who have been disappointed in their
</p>
<p>hopes of gain, brokers, bondholders, and stockholders, 
</p>
<p>all, all have united in a crusade against him. It has
</p>
<p>suited the purposes of certain individuals, whose names
</p>
<p>and motives have been dragged to light in the course of
</p>
<p>this investigation, to charge on Mr. Barker all the evils
</p>
<p>of a financial nature that have recently fallen on this
</p>

</p>
<p>to the worst passions of our nature, by the most ex-
</p>
<p>travagant tales concerning his connection with the com-
</p>
<p>panies that failed, and the profits alleged to have been
</p>
<p>realized therefrom, by exciting the jealousy of the sus-

</p>
<p>bring down upon his head a storm of popular indigna-
</p>
<p>tion that should desolate him in its fury and destroy

<p>him forever. To a considerable extent, their efforts
</p>
<p>were successful. The multitude of bondholders and

<p>you should once suspect that your minds were about to

</p>
<p>"In the coui'se of my remarks I shall endeavor to
</p>
<p>guard you against some of those considerations which
</p>
<p>are most likely to mislead ; but there is one against
</p>
<p>which I feel it my duty to warn you at the very outset.
</p>
<p>An idea has gone abroad that stupendous frauds have
</p>
<p>been committed in the recent failures of your moneyed
</p>
<p>institutions, and that public justice demands the punish-
</p>
<p>ment of some one.
</p>
<p>"But, however this may be, it is obvious that these
</p>
<p>vague impressions that wrong has been committed, and
</p>
<p>this thirst for vengeance, is calculated to operate in a
</p>
<p>thousand forms, to the great injury of whosoever may
</p>
<p>chance to be accused as the author of that wrong ; and
</p>
<p>in no way more effectually than by inclining judges
</p>
<p>and jiu-ors to regard the prosecution in a favorable
</p>
<p>light.
</p>
<p>"Attempts have already been made, and they will
</p>
<p>doubtless be repeated, to impress it on your minds that
</p>
<p>this prosecution is entitled to your favor ; and, lest you
</p>
<p>should chance to have imbibed such an impression, I
</p>
<p>beg to direct your attention to the motives in which it
</p>
<p>originated, to the form in which it has been preferred,
</p>
<p>and to the mode in vfhich the public prosecutor has
</p>
<p>attempted to sustain it. A brief consideration of these
</p>
<p>three topics will enable you to determine how much
</p>
<p>encouragement it should receive at the hands of an
</p>
<p>honest jury.

</p>
<p>man can be put on trial without a copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment and a list of the witnesses by whose oath it was
</p>
<p>obtained. This salutary practice is in this State too
</p>
<p>generally neglected. It has not been adopted in the
</p>
<p>present case. We must, therefore, select the instigators
</p>
<p>of this proceeding from among the prosecutor's wit-
</p>
<p>nesses. Of the witnesses called by the district attorney,
</p>
<p>many  such, for example, as Mr. Catlin, Mr. Nevins,
</p>
<p>Mr. Fleming, and others  had no connection with the
</p>
<p>institutions alleged to have been defrauded, but were pro-
</p>
<p>duced for the mere purpose of proving independent facts,
</p>
<p>nowise suspicious in themselves, and never till now the
</p>
<p>subject of complaint. They were not the prosecutors.
</p>
<p>Others were connected with the defendants, or some of
</p>
<p>them, by the ties of friendship or of business. They
</p>
<p>also were not the prosecutors. Now, when you select
</p>
<p>from the witnesses on the part of the prosecution those
</p>
<p>who belong to the two classes I have named, all that
</p>
<p>remain have either strong personal enmities towards
</p>
<p>some or all of the defendants, or are deeply interested
</p>
<p>in the institutions alleged to have been defrauded, or in
</p>
<p>the employment of those institutions, or have lost money
</p>
<p>by those that have, failed. Let us run over the list:
</p>
<p>Mr. Crane, secretary of the Mechanics' Company;
</p>
<p>Mr. McCulloch, the worthy commissioner of the Morris
</p>
<p>Canal Bank, who would convict his brother commis-
</p>
<p>sioners as conspirators for doing that which his own
</p>
<p>conspiracy rendered necessary ; Mr. Gilchrist, cashier
</p>
<p>of the Morris Bank, and several of its directors ; Mr.
</p>
<p>Cheesebrough, who has long had his difficulties with
</p>
<p>two of the defendants, Leavitt, the president of the
</p>
<p>Fulton Bank, Sprague, his clerk ; St. John, the youth
</p>
<p>who was sent here by Clarkson and Reed ; Clarkson and

</p>
<p>Keed themselves ; Falls, the cashier of the Tradesmen's
</p>
<p>Bank ; the pugnacious Mr. Dyatt, and the whole corps
</p>
<p>of bondholders and stockholders. Some or all of
</p>
<p>these, it is reasonable to infer, are the real complainants.
</p>
<p>Without their oaths the prosecution could not have
</p>
<p>breathed an hour. You see, then, that the substratum
</p>
<p>of this prosecution has been laid by the testimony of
</p>
<p>witnesses under the double bias of personal animosity
</p>
<p>and private interest. But you will be told that all
</p>
<p>criminal proceedings are to be commenced by the com-
</p>
<p>plaint, and generally to be supported by the oath, of
</p>
<p>the party injured. This is true ; and when the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion springs from a real desire to advance the cause of
</p>
<p>justice, the public good requires that you should act,
</p>
<p>though even then with caution, on the evidence of those
</p>
<p>whose propeHy or whose persons have been the subject
</p>
<p>of depredations. But the present is no such case. It
</p>
<p>is the offspring of feelings, motives, and designs alto-
</p>
<p>gether personal. Many of the witnesses have shown
</p>
<p>this by their testimony or their conduct whilst under
</p>
<p>examination. As to McCulloch, Leavitt, Sprague, Dyatt,
</p>
<p>and several others, this was too palpable to escape your
</p>
<p>observation. As to the bondholders, one and all, I risk
</p>
<p>nothing in asking you whether there is one of them who,
</p>
<p>if he could have obtained his money, though at the
</p>
<p>expense of every other creditor, would not gladly have
</p>
<p>taken it and remained quietly at home, without dreaming
</p>
<p>of conspiracies or appealing to public justice.
</p>
<p>"2. I request your attention to the form which has
</p>
<p>been given to this prosecution. Unless I am deceived,
</p>
<p>you will find it such as to demand your unqualified
</p>
<p>condemnation. To enable you to understand it, I must

<p>detail the facts. On the 12th of August last, the grand
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 151
</p>
<p>jury presented an indictment against Messrs. Eckford,
</p>
<p>Swift, Rathbone, and Vermilyea, for conspiring to
</p>
<p>defraud the Morris Canal and Fulton Banks. That in-
</p>
<p>dictment was founded on the fraud alleged to have been
</p>
<p>committed in the exchange of stocks, one of the prin-
</p>
<p>cipal subjects of the present investigation. The de-
</p>
<p>fendants appeared, pleaded, and demanded an imme-
</p>
<p>diate trial. A trial was promised, but was deferred by
</p>
<p>the court from want of time and the pressure of busi-
</p>
<p>ness. On the 15th of the same month an indictment
</p>
<p>was found against the four persons just named, together
</p>
<p>with Messrs. Spencer and Brown and the cashier of the
</p>
<p>Morris Bank, Mr. Talman, for a conspiracy to defraud
</p>
<p>the Morris Canal Bank and the Fulton Bank. This
</p>
<p>indictment was founded on the same transactions as the
</p>
<p>former. On the same day, or the next, an indictment
</p>
<p>was found against John Franklin and Messrs. Eckford
</p>
<p>and Vermilyea, for a conspiracy to defraud the Me-
</p>
<p>chanics' Insurance Company, embracing the same sub-
</p>
<p>ject-matter, so far as that institution is concerned, that
</p>
<p>is now the subject of inquiry. A fourth indictment
</p>
<p>was presented against Messrs. Spencer and Brown,
</p>
<p>together with Leggett and Oakley, clerks in the Fulton
</p>
<p>Bank, for a conspiracy to defraud that institution by
</p>
<p>those overdratvings of which you have heard so much
</p>
<p>in the course of the present trial. And by the same
</p>
<p>grand jury a fifth indictment was preferred against Mr.
</p>
<p>Davis, in conjunction with Messrs. Reed, Grouverneur,
</p>
<p>and Cox, for a conspiracy to defraud the Tradesmen's
</p>
<p>Bank, in the various transactions which have been
</p>
<p>given in evidence before you. All these indictments
</p>
<p>are yet pending and untried.

</p>
<p>" Thus you perceive, gentlemen of the jury, that
</p>
<p>152 LIFE OP JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>every branch of the present accusation had been made
</p>
<p>the subject of separate prosecutions before the present
</p>
<p>indictment was preferred, and that all the parties now
</p>
<p>on trial, with a single exception, had been charged in
</p>
<p>one or other of the proceedings I have mentioned.
</p>
<p>That exception, however, did not spring from anj favor
</p>
<p>on the part of the public prosecutor : it was my client,
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker. Another grand jury was summoned;
</p>
<p>and such was the increase of prejudice, or of testimony,
</p>
<p>that he who in August was untouched by a single accu-
</p>
<p>sation was indicted in September as a party to all the
</p>
<p>conspiracies charged in five several indictments ! But
</p>
<p>mark the course of the public prosecutor. Instead of
</p>
<p>finding five new indictments, and including in each the
</p>
<p>name of Jacob Barker, one general indictment is found
</p>
<p>against him and his seven co-defendants, comprehending
</p>
<p>not only all the conspiracies embraced in the former
</p>
<p>prosecutions, but adding to the institutions alleged to
</p>
<p>have been defrauded the 'Life and Fire, and the stock-
</p>
<p>holders thereof.' Under this last indictment the de-
</p>
<p>fendants have been required to answer in the gross for
</p>
<p>all the transactions they have had for the last three
</p>
<p>years with either of the institutions enumerated ; and
</p>
<p>that, too, whether jointly, singly, or in pairs, with each
</p>
<p>other, or with parties not on trial.
</p>
<p>"This form of prosecution is not only extremely in-
</p>
<p>convenient, but, in my judgment, was adopted without
</p>
<p>necessity. The defendants, with the exception of Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, could have been tried under the former indict-
</p>
<p>ments. If there was ground to charge him, new bills
</p>
<p>could have been preferredj and his name inserted in
</p>
<p>each. If there was ground to charge the whole eight,

<p>their names could have been inserted in each bill. In

</p>
<p>either case, their trials would have been confined to
</p>
<p>acts afi"ecting some particular institution ; each trial
</p>
<p>would have been kept within moderate limits as to time :
</p>
<p>and justice might have been administered impartially,
</p>
<p>understandingly, and without embarrassment or doubt.
</p>
<p>The course pursued on this occasion was not only un-
</p>
<p>necessary, but unprecedented. Let the counsel for the
</p>
<p>prosecution produce its parallel if they can. Let them
</p>
<p>ransack our judicial records from the earliest period of
</p>
<p>the common law to the present hour, and they will find
</p>
<p>none. No, not even in the days of Jeffreys, nor among
</p>
<p>the L^sh state prosecutions.
</p>
<p>''You may think this but idle declamation. Advert
</p>
<p>then, I beseech you, to the evils that have flowed from
</p>
<p>the blending together of so many subjects of accusation.
</p>
<p>It has protracted this trial to a length hitherto unparal-
</p>
<p>leled in this State. It has plunged us into an ocean of
</p>
<p>evidence, through which none but a skilful pilot can
</p>
<p>steer in safety. No human memory, unaided by notes,
</p>
<p>can retain the details of the testimony you have heard.
</p>
<p>Your situation would not permit you to take notes, and
</p>
<p>you are therefore obliged to rely on memory or the
</p>
<p>statements of others. With all the helps you may
</p>
<p>receive, with all your circumspection, there is great
</p>
<p>danger that you may err. It is the prerogative of
</p>
<p>Heaven to review the complicated acts of a busy life,
</p>
<p>and to determine of the whole whether it demands
</p>
<p>punishment or reward. Man can only judge of separate
</p>
<p>transactions ; and the rule that forbids multifariousness
</p>
<p>in judicial proceedings is not only intended to promote
</p>
<p>the attainment of truth, but is rendered indispensable
</p>
<p>by the imperfection of our nature. This mode of prose-

<p>cution has also subjected you to a severe trial. The
</p>
<p>154 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>interests of tlie defendants being, in most cases, really
</p>
<p>distinct, and sometimes in opposition, they were obliged
</p>
<p>to employ separate counsel, who have worn out your
</p>
<p>patience, even in the necessary discharge of their duties.
</p>
<p>Nor is this all : Mr. Barker has omitted to call more
</p>
<p>than thirty witnesses, who were summoned but not
</p>
<p>examined, lest he should prolong your imprisonment
</p>
<p>and render insupportable the privations you have
</p>
<p>suffered. The defendants have also been deprived of
</p>
<p>their constitutional right to call each other as witnesses
</p>
<p>in regard to many of those transactions which are now
</p>
<p>the subjects of accusation. But two of the defendants
</p>
<p> Messrs. Eckford and Vermilyea  are implicated in
</p>
<p>the fraud alleged to have been practised on the Me-
</p>
<p>chanics' Company. Brown and Spencer are the only
</p>
<p>persons now on trial who are implicated in the over-
</p>
<p>drawings of the Fulton Bank ; but then there is not a
</p>
<p>particle of evidence to connect them with the Morris
</p>
<p>Canal, the Tradesmen's Bank, the Mechanics' Com-
</p>
<p>pany, or the Life and Fire. As to all of those subjects,
</p>
<p>they may have known facts of vital importance to their
</p>
<p>co-defendants. If the transactions connected with the
</p>
<p>several institutions alleged to have been defrauded had
</p>
<p>been separately examined, as they ought to have been,
</p>
<p>those of the defendants who were not affected by the
</p>
<p>testimony would have been acquitted at once, and might
</p>
<p>have been called as witnesses for the others. By linking
</p>
<p>them together in the present indictment, and including
</p>
<p>in that indictment so many distinct transactions, this
</p>
<p>has been prevented ; because there is no one of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants who is not affected by some portion of the
</p>
<p>evidence. Once more : by coupling together these eight

</p>
<p>defendants, they are brought to trial for the acts they
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 155
</p>
<p>have really committed, under such circumstances as
</p>
<p>necessarily to be prejudiced by the acts of others. Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker had no connection whatever with the Mechanics'
</p>
<p>Company nor with the overdrawings of the Fulton
</p>
<p>Bank; and yet he is to answer for his own sins in con-
</p>
<p>junction with the sins of others. We read in classic
</p>
<p>fable of a tyrant who bound together the living and the
</p>
<p>dead and buried both in one common grave. This prose-
</p>
<p>cution proceeds on the same principle, but its cruelty
</p>
<p>is more refined. The crime of the despot was not
</p>
<p>cloaked under the pretence that both were dead ; but,
</p>
<p>when your verdict shall have bound together the guilty
</p>
<p>and the innocent, the record will make you say, and say
</p>
<p>upon your oaths, that each was guilty of defrauding all
</p>
<p>the parties, political and natural, named in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. Yes ! if you convict my client, the record will
</p>
<p>make you say that he conspired to defraud the Me-
</p>
<p>chanics' Insurance Company, when you know in your
</p>
<p>consciences that, in that respect at least, this indict-
</p>
<p>ment is untrue.
</p>
<p>"Thus, gentlemen, you perceive that I spoke not
</p>
<p>lightly when I complained of the form which had been
</p>
<p>given to this prosecution. Why these parties were put
</p>
<p>upon trial at the same time, for so many distinct acts,
</p>
<p>it is not for me to say. Was it done to prevent them
</p>
<p>from calling each other as witnesses and explaining
</p>
<p>what is now said to be inexplicable ? I hope there was
</p>
<p>no such motive. Was it done in the belief that by con-
</p>
<p>necting together a thousand distinct transactions of
</p>
<p>various hue, some innocent and some doubtful, the good,
</p>
<p>the bad, and the indifferent,  was it hoped that by blend-

</p>
<p>to be condemned? Was that the object? Or was it
</p>
<p>hoped that the defendants, goaded on by their desire to
</p>
<p>protect themselves, or jostling amid their conflicting
</p>
<p>interests, might mutually contribute to the ruin of each
</p>
<p>other? Was this the charitable motive?
</p>
<p>"3. I pass to the third topic I proposed to discuss, 
</p>
<p>the manner in which this prosecution has been attempted
</p>
<p>to be sustained. I mean not in this place to enter into
</p>
<p>details. I only intend to call your attention to some
</p>
<p>of the prominent features of this trial,  features of
</p>
<p>strong mark, which give character to the cause. And,
</p>
<p>first of all, I remind you of the females, some of them
</p>
<p>clad in the habiliments of woe, that were brought here
</p>
<p>to tell you of their losses as bondholders or stockholders
</p>
<p>of the Life and Fire. Why were these respectable
</p>
<p>persons dragged from their firesides, their domestic
</p>
<p>avocations, their children and their friends, and kept in
</p>
<p>this hall from day to day, till, in the order of the proofs,
</p>
<p>it suited the convenience of the public prosecutor to call
</p>
<p>them to that stand and to receive from their lips the
</p>
<p>stoi^ of their sufferings ? Shall I be told there was any
</p>
<p>necessity for this? There is no man who will dare to
</p>
<p>utter such a declaration. Why, then, was it done ? There
</p>
<p>could have been but one motive. It was to enlist
</p>
<p>against the defendants those sympathies of our nature 
</p>
<p>the best and purest that have survived the fall  which
</p>
<p>flow out spontaneously when we see woman in distress;
</p>
<p>which prompt us to fly to her relief, and, without inquir-
</p>
<p>ing how or why, to ask but ivlio has done it, and then to
</p>
<p>avenge the wrong. Have we not a right to complain
</p>
<p>of this as cruel? Was it not enough that the defend-
</p>
<p>ants had been charged with guilt and pursued by public

<p>prejudice even to this last refuge of the oppressed?

</p>
<p>Was it riglit that mothers should be made to teach their
</p>
<p>children the story of that guilt, ere it was established
</p>
<p>by the verdict of an honest jury, or that such a ver-
</p>
<p>dict should be sought for, by exciting the sympathies
</p>
<p>and rousing the indignation of our judges ? This is not
</p>
<p>all. To sustain this prosecution, the friends and confi-
</p>
<p>dants of the accused have been called upon to testify, in
</p>
<p>the hope that, by violating the confidence reposed in
</p>
<p>them, they might contribute to the ruin of their friends.
</p>
<p>Fortunately for the defendants, they knew nothing to
</p>
<p>their prejudice, and the eflbrt was unavailing. But
</p>
<p>what are we to think of the cause that requires such a
</p>
<p>support? Confidence is the golden cord that binds
</p>
<p>society together. Destroy it, and man becomes a hermit,
</p>
<p>and the world a solitude. Never should a fibre be severed
</p>
<p>but from imperious necessity. This case presented no
</p>

</p>
<p>some others, what shall we say of that rude invasion
</p>
<p>of the domestic hearth which  dragged to this bar the
</p>
<p>orphan niece of one of the defendants,  which called
</p>
<p>on her to reveal the secrets of the family in which she
</p>
<p>found an asylum wdien both her parents were hurried

<p>to the grave? Is there any thing in all those accumu-

<p>lated charges which are heaped on the defendants, I do
</p>
<p>not ask to justify, but even to excuse, this attempt to
</p>
<p>extort, from the lips of one so circumstanced, evidence
</p>
<p>against her friend and benefactor, her more than father ?

<p>" Gentlemen, when I witness such an example of
</p>
<p>the .power of prejudice, when I see that even the
</p>
<p>greatest minds are fated to bear its yoke, I could weep
</p>
<p>over the frailty of man's nature. And I assure the
</p>
<p>public prosecutor that w^hat I have said on this point
</p>
<p>has been said in sorrow and not in anger. But I tell

<p>him to liis face, and in the presence of this great
</p>
<p>audience, that if he should succeed (which may Heaven
</p>
<p>forbid !) in sustaining this prosecution, he will have done
</p>
<p>to the cause of justice, and to this community, an injury
</p>
<p>for which not all the labors of his past life, useful as
</p>
<p>they have been, nor all the public services he may here-
</p>
<p>after render, can furnish an atonement ; for he will have
</p>
<p>succeeded . in establishing a precedent which, in times
</p>
<p>of popular excitement and in the hands of partial
</p>
<p>judges, may be wrested to purposes the most fatal to
</p>
<p>private rights and public liberty,  which may involve
</p>
<p>not eight, but eighty, in one sweeping charge, and offer
</p>
<p>up at once whole hecatombs of victims.
</p>
<p>"I will not detain you by entering into an exposition
</p>
<p>of the law of conspiracy. What does and what does not
</p>
<p>amount to conspiracy will be the subject of discussion
</p>
<p>on the part of the other counsel, and will be faithfully
</p>
<p>explained to you by the court ; but there are one or
</p>
<p>two general observations touching the law of this case
</p>
<p>that I cannot omit.
</p>
<p>"I refrain from entering into the discussion, because
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker has enjoined me to manage my argument in
</p>
<p>the same liberal and fearless spirit in which he con-
</p>
<p>ducted his defence ; and, above all things, he has com-
</p>
<p>manded me not to rest his cause on any technical
</p>
<p>ground.
</p>
<p>''This injunction, I can assure him, I mean faithfully
</p>
<p>to obey ; but as a sworn defender of the law, as a free-
</p>
<p>man and a lover of my country, I cannot suffer a prin-
</p>
<p>ciple so reasonable in itself, so necessary to the safety
</p>
<p>of the citizens, so indispensable to the due administra-

</p>
<p>without raising in its behalf the voice of warning and
</p>
<p>remonstrance. And I beg to assure mj client, and you
</p>
<p>also, gentlemen of the jury, that this is no technical
</p>
<p>objection. It stands on grounds of right reason and
</p>
<p>eternal justice. That no man shall be put on trial for
</p>
<p>one offence and convicted of another,  that he shall not
</p>
<p>be held to answer for a crime against which he is not
</p>
<p>admonished to defend himself; these are among the most
</p>
<p>obvious principles of that law which has been written on
</p>
<p>the heart of man by the hand of his Creator. They
</p>
<p>are, therefore, to be found in the penal code of every
</p>
<p>State that pretends to a rational jurisprudence. They
</p>
<p>are among the chief ornaments of our boasted common
</p>
<p>law, and, with the invaluable right of a trial by one's
</p>
<p>peers, create the difference between a trial in New York
</p>
<p>and one at Madrid or Algiers. Heaven grant that
</p>
<p>neither you, nor I, nor our remotest posterity may
</p>
<p>outlive their application in this favored land of liberty
</p>
<p>and law !
</p>
<p>''But I perceive that my client is impatient, whilst I
</p>
<p>thus linger at the threshold. He likes not these dis-
</p>
<p>tant approaches. He would have me attack the enemy in
</p>
<p>his strongholds, and would risk the issue on an open
</p>
<p>contest. I go, then, to the evidence in the cause, and shall
</p>
<p>examine in detail all that relates to Mr. Barker. And
</p>
<p>if He who is the author of reason shall only enable me
</p>
<p>to express with clearness the conceptions I have formed
</p>
<p>of this evidence, I hope to satisfy you that not a fact
</p>
<p>has been proved which can warrant you in believing that
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker ever intended, either separately or in con-
</p>
<p>junction with others, to defraud any one of the parties
</p>
<p>named in the indictment. In doing this I am aware that

<p>every part of tlie Union, but in every quarter of the
</p>
<p>globe. Wherever commerce has her patrons, those are
</p>
<p>to be found who take an interest in his welfare and who
</p>
<p>wait with breathless solicitude the issue of this trial.
</p>
<p>They shall know that, if condemned, he was not con-
</p>
<p>demned unheard. If acquitted, your vindication and
</p>
<p>his shall accompany your verdict.
</p>
<p>" To reduce the mass of evidence that has been
</p>
<p>offered to a manageable shape, I shall take up the corpo-
</p>
<p>rations and individuals named in the indictment in the
</p>
<p>order in whfch they are enumerated. I shall apply to
</p>
<p>each, as I proceed, all the evidence that touches Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, but shall not comment on that which relates to
</p>
<p>the other defendants.
</p>
<p>'^ I. The 3IecJianics' Insurance Company.  The facts
</p>
<p>relied on to show a conspiracy to defraud this company
</p>
<p>relate exclusively to John Franklin and Messrs. Eck-
</p>
<p>ford and Vermilyea. I will not enter into the discus-
</p>
<p>sion of those transactions, for Mr. Barker had no con-
</p>
<p>nection with either. He was never a director or stock-
</p>
<p>holder of the company ; he has had no dealings with it.
</p>
<p>After the consummation of the alleged frauds, and after
</p>
<p>the failure of the Life and Fire, it is in proof that the
</p>
<p>Life and Fire handed over to him, among other claims,
</p>
<p>one against the Mechanics' Company, which is now in
</p>
<p>suit. If it is a just claim, they ought to pay, and the
</p>
<p>court will see that they pay to the proper party. If it
</p>
<p>is not a just claim, they will be protected against it, and
</p>
<p>indemnified for the expenses of their defence. Perhaps
</p>
<p>I ought not to have detained you by alluding to a matter
</p>
<p>which evidently has nothing to do with this cause. But,

<p>which certificates are said to have been false.
</p>
<p>"5. In the loan of |10,000 to the Dutchess Com-
</p>
<p>pany.
</p>
<p>"I waive all discussion as to the four first topics; for
</p>
<p>there is not a particle of proof to connect Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>with either of them. And, in addition to this absence
</p>
<p>of proof against him, there is positive testimony that he
</p>
<p>was neither an applicant for the bank, nor a commis-
</p>
<p>sioner, nor a subscriber, real or fictitious, nor a stock-
</p>
<p>holder, director, or committee-man. Till the affair of
</p>
<p>the $10,000 loaned to the Dutchess County Insurance
</p>
<p>Company, his name was not mentioned by any of the
</p>
<p>witnesses. This was put forth by the district attorney
</p>
<p>as a fraudulent transaction, and, I take it for granted,
</p>
<p>will again form a topic of crimination. Let us see what
</p>
<p>it amounts to. It is admitted that the money was re-
</p>
<p>paid, but the charge is that it was procured by Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker without security, through the agency of Yer-
</p>
<p>milyea, and remained some time without interest. All
</p>
<p>the evidence before you in regard to this transaction is

</p>
<p>and the testimony of Newton St. John, Mr. Gilchrist,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Halleck. The memorandum of Talman simply
</p>
<p>states that $10,000 had been lent to Jacob Barker by
</p>
<p>T. Yermilyea, $5000 on the 29th of April, and $5000
</p>
<p>on the 11th of May. This memorandum, it may be
</p>
<p>proper to state, is not evidence against Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>Young St. John says that Yermilyea directed the
</p>
<p>$10,000 to be sent to Mr. Barker, and that he (St.
</p>
<p>John) took the money, or a part of it, to the ojffice of
</p>
<p>the Dutchess Company ; that he there saw Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>who pointed out Mr. Halleck, the secretary of the
</p>
<p>Dutchess, as the person to receive it, and that he paid
</p>
<p>it to that gentleman. He further testified that he never
</p>
<p>saw Mr. Barker in the Morris Canal Bank; and that he
</p>
<p>does not know that Mr. Barker had any thing to do with
</p>
<p>the money, except from the statements of others and
</p>
<p>from what passed in the ofiice of the Dutchess. He
</p>
<p>added that the money was returned about the 20th of
</p>
<p>July, principally in the bills of the Morris Canal Bank ;
</p>
<p>and that was all the young gentleman knew upon the
</p>
<p>subject. Mr. Gilchrist, the present cashier, had no
</p>
<p>knowledge upon the subject, except that the money had
</p>
<p>been repaid. Mr. Halleck told you that the Dutchess
</p>
<p>County Insurance Company, some two or three months
</p>
<p>before the 20th of July, received $10,000 in Morris
</p>
<p>Canal bills on loan from Mr. Yermilyea ; but whether
</p>
<p>he brought them in person or sent part by a boy he did
</p>
<p>not recollect ; that on or about the 20th of July, Mr.
</p>
<p>Yermilyea, accompanied by Mr. Talman, came to the
</p>
<p>office of the Dutchess, and requested that the money
</p>
<p>might be repaid to the Morris Canal Bank, and that he
</p>
<p>thereupon paid over the amount, chiefly in bills of the

</p>
<p>Morris Bank, to Mr. Talman, in the presence of Yermil-
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 163
</p>
<p>yea. He added that no application had previously
</p>
<p>been made, either by Mr. Vermilyea or the bank, for
</p>
<p>the money ; and that Mr. Barker had no interest in the
</p>
<p>loan except as a stockholder and officer of the Dutchess.
</p>
<p>Thus you perceive that there is no evidence to impeach
</p>
<p>the fairness of this transaction. Whether security was
</p>
<p>given by Mr. Vermilyea to the bank, or by the Dutchess
</p>
<p>Company to Vermilyea, does not appear. Nor is it
</p>
<p>material. The Dutchess Company was always able to
</p>
<p>repay it at a moment's warning. It was promptly re-
</p>
<p>turned on the first call ; and as to the trifling amount of
</p>
<p>interest, about which so much clamor has been made, if
</p>
<p>any interest was justly payable to the bank by the
</p>
<p>Dutchess, it can be deducted from the $5000 now owing
</p>
<p>to that company.
</p>
<p>"I have been thus minute in stating the testimony
</p>
<p>concerning this transaction, because, strange to tell, it
</p>
<p>was much insisted on by the district attorney. Neither
</p>
<p>the cashier nor any of the directors complained of it in
</p>
<p>their testimony : indeed, they all said they knew of no
</p>
<p>fraud committed by Jacob Barker upon their bank.
</p>
<p>But of what avail is their united tribute to the inno-
</p>
<p>cence of my client ? The district attorney has de-
</p>
<p>nounced the act as fraudulent, and young Mr. St. John
</p>
<p>has told us that, in his opinion, it was disJwnorable !
</p>
<p>Who shall doubt the justice of their decision?
</p>
<p>" This affair of the $10,000 was the only transaction
</p>
<p>of Mr. Barker's that was specified by the district attor-
</p>
<p>ney, in his opening speech, as a fraud on the Morris
</p>
<p>Canal ; but he asserted that Mr. Barker had an intimate
</p>
<p>connection with its concerns, and that many other cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances would come out in evidence to show the

</p>
<p>fraudulent nature of that connection. I have carefully
</p>
<p>164 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>examined tlie testimony, and I find but three other facts
</p>
<p>to connect Mr. Barker with that company. They are,
</p>
<p>first, the application for a loan made to him by Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayard; second, his agency in effecting the return of
</p>
<p>the 2500 shares of Morris Canal stock; and, third, the
</p>
<p>loan of $5000 to the bank.
</p>
<p>'' As to the application made by Mr. Bayard, that
</p>
<p>gentleman, who was the assistant president of the bank,
</p>
<p>called on Mr. Barker on the 21st of July with a hasty
</p>
<p>note from Mr. Eckford, stating that the bank was in
</p>
<p>distress, and begging his assistance ; that they wanted
</p>
<p>$25,000; that they would offer him securities, and that
</p>
<p>he (Mr. Eckford) would guarantee to the amount of
</p>
<p>$10,000. This was strange evidence to support a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. But the district attorney had an object in
</p>
<p>offering it. He desired to fix on Mr. Barker the charge
</p>
<p>of extortion; and he proved by Mr. Bayard that the
</p>
<p>former talked of taking the notes at a discount of 30
</p>
<p>or 33 per cent., which the latter was unwilling to allow;
</p>
<p>and thus the negotiation was, therefore, broken off. Mo-
</p>
<p>tives of delicacy restrained Mr. Barker from repelling
</p>
<p>this charge by calling for the names and condition of the
</p>
<p>parties to the notes ; but he did it with equal effect by
</p>
<p>asking Mr. Bayard whether he did not state his willing-
</p>
<p>ness to furnish the $10,000 which Mr. Eckford had
</p>
<p>offered to guarantee at a moment's warning and upon
</p>
<p>lawful interest. You heard his answer in the afiirm-
</p>
<p>ative, and you required nothing further on this point.
</p>
<p>" The agency of Mr. Barker in the return of the
</p>
<p>2500 shares is not complained of as injurious to the
</p>
<p>bank. On the contrary, it is admitted on all hands that
</p>
<p>if the return of this stock had not been effected the

</p>
<p>bank would have been ruined. And Mr. David B.
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 165
</p>
<p>Ogden, a director of the Morris Canal, charged with the
</p>
<p>negotiation on their part, testified that Mr. Barker had
</p>
<p>conducted the negotiation with great skill, fidelity, and
</p>
<p>success. Any agency, therefore, that he may have had in
</p>
<p>this transaction, instead of furnishing evidence to crimi-
</p>
<p>nate him, should entitle him to the thanks of the institu-
</p>
<p>tion; unless, indeed, the district attorney was correct
</p>
<p>in asserting, as he did in his opening speech, that the
</p>
<p>stock was not returned till after the complaint to the
</p>
<p>grand jury, and then only because 'they feared the
</p>
<p>penalties of the law.' I cannot suffer this observation to
</p>
<p>pass unanswered: it is important to notice it for the
</p>
<p>purpose of enabling you to form a just estimate of the
</p>
<p>character and motives of Mr. David Leavitt. It is also in
</p>
<p>proof, then, that the negotiation for the return of the 2500
</p>
<p>shares was not completed till the 10th day of August, when
</p>
<p>it was closed at the office of Mr. David B. Ogden. It is
</p>
<p>also in proof that a complaint was then pending before
</p>
<p>the grand jury, which resulted in a bill,  the first of the
</p>
<p>series. It is also true that Mr. Leavitt, who represented
</p>
<p>the Fulton Bank, had been before the grand jury prior to
</p>
<p>the closing of the negotiation; and when it became ne-
</p>
<p>cessary, for the purpose of consummating the arrange-
</p>
<p>ment, to deliver up the certificates of the 2500 shares,
</p>
<p>Mr. Leavitt stated to Mr. Eckford that the certificates
</p>
<p>were at the Fulton Bank, and left the office of Mr.
</p>
<p>Ogden under the pretence that he would go to the bank
</p>
<p>and obtain them. He was gone tvfo or three hours;
</p>
<p>and, when reproached for the detention, he for the first
</p>
<p>time informed the gentlemen that the certificates were
</p>
<p>in the hands of the grand jury and could not be ob-
</p>
<p>tained; and the business was, therefore, closed without

</p>
<p>their delivery. Till this disclosure by Mr. Leavitt,
</p>
<p>166 LIFE OF JACOB BARKEK.
</p>
<p>neither of the gentlemen with whom he was negotiating
</p>
<p>had any reason to suspect that the matter was in the
</p>
<p>hands of the grand jury. All this is in proof. But we
</p>
<p>have something further. You heard David Leavitt
</p>
<p>admit, on that stand, that when he left the office of Mr.
</p>
<p>Ogden under the pretence that the certificates were at
</p>
<p>the bank and that he was going thither to procure them,
</p>
<p> you heard him acknowledge, with his own lips, that he
</p>
<p>then knew that the certificates were in the hands of the
</p>
<p>grand jury, and that he intentionally concealed the fact
</p>
<p>from Mr. Echford^ Mr. Barker, and Mr. Ogden.
</p>
<p>" I make no comments on this fact. It is enough to
</p>
<p>state that whilst David Leavitt w^as negotiating with
</p>
<p>Henry Eckford as an honorable man, he was plotting
</p>
<p>the ruin of his character and the destruction of his
</p>
<p>peace !
</p>
<p>"But Mr. Barker claims a commission of $5000 for
</p>
<p>his services in this negotiation, the payment of which
</p>
<p>is to be resisted by the bank. Whether he is right or
</p>
<p>wrong in demanding this commission, is really irrelevant
</p>
<p>to the present inquiry. Even if his conduct in this
</p>
<p>respect was fraudulent, it would be no evidence of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy. In all the new law that this trial has fur-
</p>
<p>nished, it still seems to be admitted that the union of
</p>
<p>two or more minds is essential to a conspiracy ; and this
</p>
<p>is an affair that relates exclusively to Mr. Barker. Yet
</p>
<p>it is my duty to place it before you in its true light.
</p>
<p>The facts are simply these. After the failure of the
</p>
<p>Life and Fire Company, there was much excitement
</p>
<p>among the persons interested in the Morris Canal Com-
</p>
<p>pany, and among the holders of its bills, on account of

<p>the 2500 shares exchanged with the Life and Fire

<p>Company. David B. Ogden, Esq., one of the directors,
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 167
</p>
<p>had two or tliree interviews with Mr. Eckford, in which
</p>
<p>he pressed the return of the stock. The latter respect-
</p>
<p>fully declared that he would see the stock returned, but
</p>
<p>he declined binding himself by a written engagement to

<p>do so immediately. Mr. Barker was present at the last

<p>interview, having, at the request of Mr. Eckford, ac-
</p>
<p>companied him to Mr. Ogden's house, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>explaining the effect a written guarantee would have on
</p>
<p>the stock-market. The reasons he assigned were solid
</p>
<p>and forcible. The Morris Canal stock had been ex-
</p>
<p>changed with the Fulton Bank, and could not be libe-
</p>
<p>rated without returning the 2000 shares of Fulton Bank
</p>
<p>stock, or making some other arrangement with the
</p>
<p>Fulton Bank. Mr. Eckford had engaged to return the
</p>
<p>Fulton Bank stock on the 1st of March, 1827, but had
</p>
<p>not contemplated an earlier return. It was apparent to
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker that the attempt to procure, on a sudden,
</p>
<p>2000 shares of Fulton Bank stock would enhance the
</p>
<p>price of that stock, expose Mr. Eckford to extortion,
</p>
<p>and perhaps defeat the very object in view. Mr. Ogden
</p>
<p>felt the force of these objections, but so pressing were
</p>
<p>the necessities of the Morris Canal that he continued
</p>
<p>to urge upon Mr. Eckford the immediate return of the
</p>
<p>stock. The latter, though under no obligation to do
</p>
<p>this was willing to make the attempt, and, placing a just
</p>
<p>confidence in the skill of Mr. Barker, appealed to him
</p>
<p>as the person who should undertake the negotiation with
</p>
<p>the Fulton Bank. Mr. Barker replied to this appeal
</p>
<p>that he would do any thing for Mr. Eckford, but would
</p>
<p>not work for the Morris Canal without pay. Mr. Ogden
</p>
<p>asked what he would charge that company for his
</p>
<p>services. He demanded $5000. Mr. Ogden tells you

</p>
<p>lengtli engaged, if the result was successful, to use liis
</p>
<p>exertions to induce the bank to pay the stipulated fee.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker was too wise to leave the matter on this
</p>
<p>footing. He therefore suggested that Mr. Ogden should
</p>
<p>procure the sanction of the directors. The board was
</p>
<p>accordingly called, and a resolution passed authorizing
</p>
<p>Mr. Ogden to take such measures as he thought proper
</p>
<p>to effect the return of the stock. After this, being
</p>
<p>again urged by Mr. Ogden, Mr. Barker opened the ne-
</p>
<p>gotiation with the Fulton Bank, and prosecuted it with
</p>
<p>his accustomed perseverance until the desired end was
</p>
<p>accomplished and the Morris Canal saved from the ruin
</p>
<p>that threatened it. In the mean time, however, Mr.
</p>
<p>Leavitt had informed the directors of the Morris Canal
</p>
<p>of Mr. Barker's offer to relinquish his commission of
</p>
<p>$5000 in favor of the Fulton Bank. As Mr. Ogden
</p>
<p>had not thought it good policy, at. that stage of the busi-
</p>
<p>ness, to communicate to his fellow-directors the details
</p>
<p>of the arrangement with Mr. Barker, this information
</p>
<p>was a surprise to the board, and laid the foundation for
</p>
<p>the difference that now exists between them and Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker in regard to the commissions.
</p>
<p>"I have now given you a plain history of this trans-
</p>
<p>action as it appeared in the evidence, and I should like
</p>
<p>to know what there was in it that was wrong on the part
</p>
<p>of Mr. Barker. Was he bound to save the Morris
</p>
<p>Canal Company without compensation ? They were the
</p>
<p>parties chiefly interested, and he had a right to insist on
</p>
<p>a quid pro quo, before he devoted to their use his time,
</p>
<p>his funds, or his talents. ^ .

</p>
<p>tution, when he can do so to the prejudice of Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 169
</p>
<p>has volunteered a new objection to this charge, by
</p>
<p>which Mr. Barker is not only to be deprived of his com-
</p>
<p>pensation, but convicted of bad faith and perhaps of
</p>
<p>fraud. He has sworn that Mr. Barker ' did not effect
</p>
<p>the return of stock ; that he commenced the negotiation,
</p>
<p>but flew from his agreement, in consequence of Avhich
</p>
<p>he (Leavitt) requested Mr. Eckford to employ some
</p>
<p>other agent, or negotiate the business himself, and that
</p>
<p>thereupon he and Mr. Eckford closed the business them-
</p>
<p>selves.' This statement is entirely destitute of truth.
</p>
<p>Out of Mr. Leavitt's own mouth, aided by the testimony
</p>
<p>of Mr. Emmet and other unimpeachable witnesses, I will
</p>
<p>convict him of falsehood. It is painful to make such a
</p>
<p>charge, but I shall place it past doubt or cavil. And it
</p>
<p>is important to do so at this stage of the cause, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of testing the accuracy and credibility of Mr.
</p>
<p>Leavitt. You said then, Mr. Leavitt, that Jacob Bar-
</p>
<p>ker ' did not effect the return of the stock, and that the
</p>
<p>negotiation was closed without his agency.' Who opened
</p>
<p>the negotiation with the Fulton Bank? Jacob Barker^
</p>
<p>by his letter of the 31st of July. Who conducted it
</p>
<p>until the 9th of August, inclusive? Jacob Barker.
</p>
<p>When did you tell Mr. Eckford that you would no longer
</p>
<p>treat with Jacob Barker ? On the 10th of August.
</p>
<p>When and where was the negotiation finally closed ? On
</p>
<p>the 10th of August, at the office of- David B. Ogden.
</p>
<p>Whom did you see on that day at that office with Mr.
</p>
<p>Eckford ? Jacob Barker. Who waited two or three
</p>
<p>hours with Mr. Eckford when you went for the certifi-
</p>
<p>cates,  the same certificates which you said were at the
</p>
<p>bank, when you knew them to be in the hands of the
</p>
<p>grand jury ? Jacob Barker. Who, when the certificates
</p>
<p>could not be produced, and you supposed that the whole

</p>
<p>negotiation must therefore be broken off, and went with
</p>
<p>your counsel to Mr. Ogden's office to explain this to
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford,  who, I again ask, proposed the mode of
</p>
<p>closing the arrangement without them? Jacob Barker.
</p>
<p>Who delivered the five hundred shares of Fulton stock,
</p>
<p>and the one hundred shares of Morris Canal stock, in
</p>
<p>part execution of the arrangement? Jacob Barker.
</p>
<p>What then remained to close the business ? Securities
</p>
<p>were to be delivered for $50,000. Who gave you these
</p>
<p>securities, Mr. Leavitt? Jacob Barker. These answers
</p>
<p>are taken  mark it, gentlemen  from the testimony of
</p>
<p>Mr. Leavitt himself, drawn out by Mr. Barker on his
</p>
<p>cross-examination. But the efficient instrumentality of
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker in closing this negotiation does not rest
</p>
<p>merely on the admissions of Mr. Leavitt. All the testi-
</p>
<p>mony on this point concurs in representing Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>not only as the person who commenced and managed,
</p>
<p>but who closed, this difficult and important negotiation.
</p>
<p>Mr. David B. Ogden swore that Mr. Barker did effect
</p>
<p>the return of the stock. Mr. Emmet testified that he
</p>
<p>was present as counsel for the Fulton Bank, at the close
</p>
<p>of the arrangement, and that ' Jacob Barker took a very
</p>
<p>active part in the business.' He also confirmed the ad-
</p>
<p>mission of Mr. Leavitt, that when the lawyers were at
</p>
<p>fault, (and able ones they were, too,) in consequence of the
</p>
<p>non-production of the certificates, Mr. Barker, with that
</p>
<p>readiness and tact of which you have seen so many
</p>
<p>striking examples during this trial, suggested the expe-
</p>
<p>dient that was finally adopted for closing the business
</p>
<p>without them. And yet Mr. Leavitt had the temerity
</p>
<p>to swear that Jacob Barker did not effect the return of
</p>
<p>the stock.

</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 171
</p>
<p>stated that 'Jacob Barker flew from his agreement,
</p>
<p>and that he therefore declined any further negotiation
</p>
<p>with him,' &c. On his cross-examination, Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>showed a resolution purporting to have been passed by
</p>
<p>the directors of the Fulton Bank on the 9th of August,
</p>
<p>by which they agreed to the terms proposed by Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker in behalf of Mr. Eckford, provided the assent
</p>
<p>of Spencer and Brown was obtained, and provided,
</p>
<p>also, that the directors could be satisfied in regard to
</p>
<p>another matter specified in the resolution. He then
</p>
<p>asked Mr. Leavitt whether this resolution was not
</p>
<p>passed by the board ; to which he answered first in the
</p>
<p>affirmative, but afterwards doubtingly ; and he turned
</p>
<p>to the book of minutes, which was in proof, and told us
</p>
<p>there was no such resolution entered in the minutes.
</p>
<p>On being pressed by Mr. Barker, he admitted that the
</p>
<p>paper shown him was in the handwriting of one of the
</p>
<p>directors, and had been approved of by several, and
</p>
<p>that he had no doubt it had been delivered to Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>ker as a resolution of the board. He further admitted
</p>
<p>that the two points reserved were adjusted to the satis-
</p>
<p>faction of the board, and Mr. Barker notified thereof;
</p>
<p>that Mr. Barker was willing to deliver the securities in
</p>
<p>conformity to the resolution ; that he  Leavitt  then
</p>
<p>called the board together ; that all the directors except

<p>the president  David Leavitt  voted in favor of re-
</p>
<p>ceiving the securities and delivering up the Morris
</p>
<p>Canal stock agreeably to their engagement with Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker ; that a motion was then made to reconsider,
</p>
<p>which prevailed, and that a resolution was thereupon

<p>two of the directors, both testified that the unentered
</p>
<p>resolution was unanimously passed on the 9th of August ;
</p>
<p>that they and other directors delivered it to Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>a.s the act of the board; that they at the same time
</p>
<p>informed Mr. Barker that a committee had been aj)-
</p>
<p>pointed to inquire as to the two points reserved ; that
</p>
<p>they did so, and that, those points being satisfactorily
</p>
<p>disposed of, Mr. Barker was notified that the directors
</p>
<p>would meet forthwith to consummate the arrangement
</p>
<p>agreeably to the terms of the resolution; that the
</p>
<p>board did accordingly meet,  when, to the astonishment
</p>
<p>of themselves and their brother directors, Mr. Leavitt
</p>
<p>alone voted in the negative ; whereupon, suspecting
</p>
<p>that he intended to cast upon them the responsibility
</p>
<p>of the measure, one of them moved a reconsideration,
</p>
<p>which passed, and which was followed up by a resolu-
</p>
<p>tion rejecting the whole negotiation. This, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>was the 'flying from his agreement,' of which Mr.
</p>
<p>Leavitt spoke, and which he falsely charged on Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker.
</p>
<p>"You see that it was David Leavitt and not Jacob
</p>
<p>Barker who broke faith on that occasion ; and, I confess

<p>to you, I know not which is most reprehensible, the
</p>
<p>audacity of Mr. Leavitt in attempting to palm off this

<p>statement upon you, or his treachery to his brother

</p>
<p>agrees to the unentered resolution of the 9th of August.

</p>
<p>duct, interposes his v^to. The motive was too palpable
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 173
</p>
<p>to be misunderstood. Mr. Leavitt wanted a loophole
</p>
<p>through which to crawl in case the stockholders should
</p>
<p>complain of the arrangement as improvident ; consider-
</p>
<p>able excitement about the measure having by this time
</p>
<p>been created out-of-doors among the stockholders. In
</p>
<p>that event, his protest would enable him to say, ' It was
</p>
<p>not I who did it.' But Mr. Lawrence and the other
</p>
<p>directors had too much sense and too much spirit to be
</p>
<p>caught in the snare. They, therefore, broke off the
</p>
<p>negotiation, and compelled Mr. Leavitt to resume it in
</p>
<p>proper person. Ashamed to meet Mr. Barker, he
</p>
<p>applies on the same day or the next to Mr. Eckford,
</p>
<p>and, wanting some excuse for this step, he resorts to the
</p>
<p>pitiful expedient of charging on Mr. Barker the failure
</p>
<p>of the contemplated arrangement, and affects to be un-
</p>
<p>willing to treat with him any longer. And for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose, probably, of concealing the facts, the original re-
</p>
<p>solution was withheld from the minutes, although a
</p>
<p>copy was officially served upon Mr. Barker, which ought
</p>
<p>not to have been done until it had been recorded. The
</p>
<p>rest you know."
</p>
<p>[The cause went to the jury after a most inflammatory
</p>
<p>speech on the part of the district attorney, full of
</p>
<p>eloquence, full of sound rules, that ought to be observed
</p>
<p>in all well-regulated communities, but an entire mis-
</p>
<p>statement of the little testimony which he condescended
</p>
<p>to notice, and in fact had scarcely any reference to the
</p>
<p>case under consideration ; but it had its effect, and the
</p>
<p>jury could not agree. They were equally divided ;
</p>
<p>and, having at the commencement disagreed upon some
</p>
<p>cardinal points, they, although kept together nearly a
</p>
<p>week, never descended into particulars so as to form an
</p>
<p>opinion how far any one individual was, more than

<p>another, implicated in the matters snbmitted to them.
</p>
<p>They early communicated to the conrt that they could
</p>
<p>not, and would not, agree, to which they adhered with
</p>
<p>remarkable pertinacity, and were discharged at the end
</p>
<p>of about a week.]
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX,
</p>
<p>CONTEMPT OF COURT.
</p>
<p>During the trial, Mr. Barker, in his cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion of David Leavitt, pressed him very close. The
</p>
<p>district attorney interfered, and an appeal was made to
</p>
<p>the court : it expressed great dissatisfaction at the re-
</p>
<p>marks made by Mr. Barker to the witness, and said that
</p>
<p>when the trial should terminate he must appear and
</p>
<p>answer for those expressions.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, Mr. Barker, the moment the jury were
</p>
<p>dismissed, without waiting to be called to account, rose
</p>
<p>and stated that he presented himself before the court,
</p>
<p>in obedience to their requisition, and was amenable to
</p>
<p>their directions, if they were still of the same opinion as
</p>
<p>to the examination of David Leavitt.
</p>
<p>Judge Edwards said that the circumstances had war-
</p>
<p>ranted the course pursued by the court ; Mr. Leavitt
</p>
<p>was on the stand, and a question was put by Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, of which the court required an explanation, as
</p>
<p>its relevancy was not clearly perceived.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker said he intended to impeach the witness.
</p>
<p>Mr. Leavitt then asked if he intended that he should
</p>

</p>
<p>impeach himself. Mr. Barker answered that he had
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 175
</p>
<p>done so already, in his opinion ; now, to the court this
</p>
<p>declaration appeared highly offensive, and a departure
</p>
<p>from the respect due to the rights of the witness and to
</p>
<p>the dignity of the bench.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker disclaimed all intention of disrespect to
</p>
<p>the court; said that the recorded testimony of Leavitt
</p>
<p>established that he had sworn false, knowing it to be
</p>
<p>false ; that he could, by other evidence, prove it to be
</p>
<p>false, and that he knew it when he gave his testimony;
</p>
<p>that, if the court would permit the examination, if he
</p>
<p>failed to establish these facts he would make ample
</p>
<p>apology to Leavitt, but that he would not make any
</p>
<p>apology to a man obnoxious to the charges he made
</p>
<p>against Leavitt.
</p>
<p>The court said, ''This examination cannot take place:
</p>
<p>the question is not as to the accuracy of Mr. Leavitt 's
</p>
<p>testimony. The court will adjourn, take the case into
</p>
<p>consideration, and meet to-morrow morning, w^hen they
</p>
<p>will decide what atonement will be required."
</p>
<p>The court adjourned; met the next morning. The
</p>
<p>judge addressed Mr. Barker respecting the grounds on
</p>
<p>which the displeasure of the court had been founded,
</p>
<p>saying, " The insult to Mr. Leavitt could not be passed
</p>
<p>over ; the court is satisfied that you did not intend any
</p>
<p>disrespect to it, and yesterday you had an opportunity
</p>
<p>of making satisfactory explanations in relation to Mr.
</p>
<p>Leavitt, which you refused to do.
</p>
<p>'' On the stand you impeached him while under the pro-
</p>
<p>tection of the court, and for this offence you have, as far
</p>
<p>as the witness is concerned, offered no atonement, but
</p>
<p>rather confirmed the accusation. For this offence the
</p>
<p>judgment of the court is, that you pay a fine of one *

</p>
<p>paid. The smallness of the sum arises from our having
</p>
<p>taken into consideration the peculiar situation in which
</p>
<p>you were placed when you made the objectionable decla-
</p>
<p>ration, conducting your own defence, without the aid of
</p>
<p>counsel."
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker, smiling, turned to one of his clerks, who
</p>
<p>was in court, and said, "Go to Wall Street and bring
</p>
<p>me a hundred dollars in those yellow bags." Doubloons
</p>
<p>were immediately brought, and paid into court.
</p>
<p>The day previous, a ship arrived from Mexico with
</p>
<p>two hundred thousand dollars in Mexican doubloons,
</p>
<p>being a portion of the securities pledged by Mr. Eckford
</p>
<p>for moneys borrowed for the use of the Life and Fire
</p>
<p>Insurance Company.
</p>
<p>Elisha Williams, Esq., in his speech to the jury in
</p>
<p>defence of Mr. Eckford, stated that "Leavitt had, by
</p>
<p>his own testimony, driven the last nail in the coffin of
</p>
<p>his own reputation."
</p>
<p>CHAPTER X.
</p>
<p>SPEECH OF ME. BAEKEE.
</p>
<p>A SECOND trial took place, that of Eckford and Rath-
</p>
<p>bone being held over by the district attorney, who then
</p>
<p>said they would be tried at the proper time, and, sub-
</p>
<p>sequently Maxwell, the district attorney, said to the
</p>
<p>jury that Rathbone had rendered the State some ser-
</p>
<p>vice, and therefore he would not be tried ; that he was
</p>
<p>regenerated, but not disenthralled.

</p>
<p>Observe, not "disenthralled:" had he been, he could
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKEH. 177
</p>
<p>be examined as a witness ; and it is not perceived what
</p>
<p>other reason could have induced the district attorney to
</p>
<p>withhold a nolle prosequi from a man who was not to be
</p>
<p>tried, who had paid the price of his emancipation in the
</p>
<p>fraudulent use of those miserable scraps, those "wooden
</p>
<p>daggers," in themselves as harmless as the sweepings
</p>
<p>of a barber's shop, with which the district attorney
</p>
<p>imagined he could create a delusion, a mystery, opera-
</p>
<p>ting on the minds of the jury to Mr. Barker's prejudice.
</p>
<p>A new jury was empanelled, composed of men many
</p>
<p>of whom were hostile to Mr. Barker personally,  one of
</p>
<p>their number a director in the North River Bank,
</p>
<p>against whom he had preferred the charge of fraud.

<p>Most of them admitted, when challenged, that they
</p>
<p>were prejudiced against the defendants in relation to
</p>
<p>the matters to be tried ; yet they were admitted by the
</p>
<p>court as jurors in the case, although challenged and re-
</p>
<p>sisted by the defendants to the utmost of their capacity.
</p>
<p>After the evidence for the prosecution closed, Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker spoke thus : 
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen of the jury: I do not think you are such
</p>
<p>a jury as was contemplated by the framers of our happy
</p>
<p>Constitution, who provided that every accused citizen
</p>
<p>should be tried by an impartial jury ; that men who had
</p>
<p>prejudged the case, as most of you on oath admitted
</p>
<p>you had done, cannot, in my opinion, be legally con-
</p>
<p>sidered an impartial jury. No man on earth can be
</p>
<p>expected to admit that if he finds himself, by new tes-
</p>
<p>timony, in error, he is not open to conviction ; if not,
</p>
<p>is it sufficient for you to say, what every man might say,
</p>
<p>that he considered himself equal to the mighty task of
</p>
<p>conquering his own opinions and rendering an honest

</p>
<p>is for such things as will support and harmonize with
</p>
<p>our previously-expressed opinions ; not for an excuse
</p>
<p>for the conduct of the accused, not for circumstances
</p>
<p>that will induce us to give up unfavorable opinions
</p>
<p>formed, and to reconcile affairs in themselves of doubtful
</p>
<p>appearance with fairness, with candor, and with in-
</p>
<p>tegrity. As lamentable as this is, I venture to pro-
</p>
<p>nounce it a true picture of the human mind. If you
</p>
<p>are in judgment of the law an impartial jury, why are
</p>
<p>grand jurors and relations considered otherwise? I
</p>
<p>have taken a juror's oath ; I then considered my mind,
</p>
<p>as to the case to be tried, like a clean sheet of paper,
</p>
<p>ready to receive an entire new impression ; but not so
</p>
<p>with yours. These defendants have a twofold service
</p>
<p>to perform ; they have first to remove a very deep im-
</p>
<p>pression already made, before there is any room for
</p>
<p>another; the two cannot exist at the same time; our
</p>
<p>duty is therefore a very hard one. The law presumes
</p>
<p>every individual innocent until he is proved guilty.
</p>
<p>You have taken upon yourselves this trial, presuming
</p>
<p>the defendants guilty: you, therefore, are at variance
</p>
<p>with the law. Now, it can never have been the inten-
</p>
<p>tion for the law and the jury to be at variance. I admit
</p>
<p>the odds is vastly against us, and I feel thankful that I
</p>
<p>have been favored with fortitude and philosophy suffi-
</p>
<p>cient to come here and breast the storm, unaided by
</p>
<p>counsel or friends. But I come so strongly armed that
</p>
<p>I fear not ; my shield is justice, through which not one
</p>
<p>of the poisoned arrows of the conspirators could pene-
</p>
<p>trate ; they have all fallen harmless at my feet ; I will
</p>
<p>pick them up and hurl them back on my accusers. I

<p>["Turning to the district attorney, he requested to
</p>
<p>see the wooden daggers furnished by Alderman Rath-
</p>
<p>bone, describing the papers alluded to. Two or three
</p>
<p>were furnished. "I want another of a deeper hue than
</p>
<p>either," said Mr. Barker; when another was furnished.]
</p>
<p>This is it on which I have written a memorandum,
</p>
<p>which is as pure and harmless as the act of furnishing
</p>
<p>it is vile. It is a contract in the handwriting of Alder-
</p>
<p>man Rathbone, and dated the 10th of May. It sets
</p>
<p>forth that Mr. Eckford had borrowed from Messrs.
</p>
<p>Spencer and Brown two thousand shares Fulton Bank
</p>
<p>stock in exchange for twenty-five hundred shares stock
</p>
<p>in the Morris Canal and Banking Company; promising
</p>
<p>to exchange back, at his option, at any time prior to the
</p>
<p>1st of March next. This contract was signed for H. E.,
</p>
<p>W. P. R. ; and on its back is a memorandum in my
</p>
<p>handwriting in these words :  ' As fast and in such pro-
</p>
<p>portions as I deliver the Fulton Bank stock.'
</p>
<p>"Nothing can be more harmless, more innocent, than
</p>
<p>every part of the transaction, so far as described in this
</p>
<p>agreement and in this memorandum ; it is a simple
</p>
<p>exchange of stock, an every-day transaction. Nobody
</p>
<p>has, nobody will dare to say that it was wrong ; but if
</p>
<p>the stock had been fraudulently obtained, or if the cer-
</p>
<p>tificates were false, all parties to the transaction who
</p>
<p>knew of such frauds, or either of them, would be guilty.
</p>
<p>Now, as I knew nothing of either, and had not, at the
</p>
<p>time, the slightest reason to suspect that any thing was

</p>
<p>Rathbone ; he was a director in both, banks ; lie pro-
</p>
<p>cured the stock from the Morris Canal ; he knew
</p>
<p>whether or not it had been paid for ; and if the certifi-
</p>
<p>cates were false he knew it. The question that this
</p>
<p>memorandum presents is, 'Was the memorandum to
</p>
<p>form a part of the within contract, or is it a separate
</p>
<p>contract, intended to be signed by some other person ?'
</p>
<p>The district attorney read the signature to the agree-
</p>
<p>ment 'Henry Eckford and William P. Rathbone,' and
</p>
<p>not 'for Henry Eckford, William P. Rathbone,' as he
</p>
<p>should have done, which makes the memorandum 'I,'
</p>
<p>being written in the singular, appear not to belong to
</p>
<p>the contract ; and, in the absence of all proof, my hand-
</p>
<p>writing is to be considered as indicating a separate
</p>
<p>condition on my part, connecting me with the whole
</p>
<p>transaction. This error might have been to me fatal ;
</p>
<p>and, if I had not had the capacity or good fortune to
</p>
<p>have detected it, I must have suffered.
</p>
<p>"I will now, gentlemen of the jury, unveil to your
</p>
<p>view a nefarious attempt to sacrifice an unoffending
</p>
<p>man. In the absence of Mr. Eckford, Mr. Rathbone
</p>
<p>called at the office of the Mercantile Insurance Com-
</p>
<p>pany, and presented to me this paper, drawn up by his
</p>
<p>own hand, dated and signed before I saw it, and asked,
</p>
<p>as the friend of Mr. Eckford, if its conditions were
</p>
<p>clearly expressed. I suggested a slight alteration. He
</p>
<p>requested me to reduce to writing the suggested altera-
</p>
<p>tions. Not suspecting traps to be setting for me, I did
</p>
<p>so on the back of the agreement. Mr. Rathbone took
</p>
<p>the paper with him from the office, since which I have
</p>
<p>not seen or heard of it until produced by the district
</p>
<p>attorney, which circumstance, when taken in connection

</p>
<p>with Mr. Rathbone's being let off, forces on my mind
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 181
</p>
<p>the irresistible conclusion that he has furnished it for
</p>
<p>the purpose of fixing on me a crime of which he knew
</p>
<p>that I, at least, was not guilty. If roguery there
</p>
<p>be in the transaction, he is the rogue. W. P. Rath-
</p>
<p>bone I mean, gentlemen,  that man sitting there [turn-
</p>
<p>ing and pointing at Rathbone],  to describe the enor-
</p>
<p>mity of whose conduct requires powers far beyond my
</p>
<p>capacity. Another of these notable papers is a very
</p>
<p>rough memorandum, in the handwriting of Brown,
</p>
<p>Spencer, Rathbone, and myself, which seems to have
</p>
<p>reference to a negotiation for a loan of $100,000, to
</p>
<p>support the Hudson and the United States Lombard
</p>
<p>Companies, which took place a few days before their
</p>
<p>failure ; half of which it was expected would be fur-
</p>
<p>nished by the Fulton Bank, and the other half by
</p>
<p>Messrs. Eckford and Barker. There was nothing on
</p>
<p>this paper to connect Mr. Eckford with this transaction,
</p>
<p>except the handwriting of Mr. Rathbone, who was ^
</p>
<p>that time the partner of Mr. Eckford ; and the only
</p>
<p>thing to connect Mr. Barker with it was the last memo-
</p>
<p>randum on the paper, limiting the loan to $1000 per day,
</p>
<p>which was surely a prudent precaution, as, if the in-
</p>
<p>tended object failed, the obligation to loan ^ould cease ;
</p>
<p>and, if the object was obtained, the parties would bene-
</p>
<p>fit so much by their collections during the hundred
</p>
<p>days that it would compensate them for their great
</p>
<p>exertions to raise the $100,000. But, so far from the
</p>
<p>companies meeting their payments as long as Napoleon
</p>
<p>reigned, after his return from Elba they both failed
</p>
<p>within one week ; and although they got more than
</p>
<p>$17,000 of the money, ten thousand times has it been
</p>
<p>alleged, to my prejudice, that they Avould not have
</p>
<p>failed if I had performed my promise. I consider the

</p>
<p>production of this supposed dagger, although intended
</p>
<p>for my destruction, a most fortunate feature in the plot,
</p>
<p>as it frees me most triumphantly from one charge ; and,
</p>
<p>although the last I knew of this paper it was in the
</p>
<p>hands of Mr. Brown, I am not prepared to believe that
</p>
<p>he furnished it ; and nothing can be more honorable to
</p>
<p>Messrs. Spencer and Brown than the part this negotia-
</p>
<p>tion locates on them. The whole object, scope, and ten-
</p>
<p>dency is to borrow money on the best securities they
</p>
<p>held, for theuse of the companies under their manage-
</p>
<p>ment. The next in order is a memorandum in my hand-
</p>
<p>writing, purporting to be a contract, dated the 21st day
</p>
<p>of July, written for Messrs. Brown and Spencer to
</p>
<p>sign, for the settlement of the contract of $61,000
</p>
<p>Fulton Bank stock, which was not agreed to or signed
</p>
<p>by either. The last I knew of this paper it was in their
</p>
<p>hands. It is perfectly harmless, except as another
</p>
<p>evidence of the guilty conspiracy to destroy me.
</p>
<p>And now we come to the fourth and last of these
</p>
<p>weapons of destruction : it is a plain contract for the
</p>
<p>purchase and sale of six hundred and ten shares of
</p>
<p>Fulton Bank stock, dated the 21st of January, which
</p>
<p>stock I held at the time. What possible use of this
</p>
<p>contract the district attorney intends to make, I cannot
</p>
<p>imagine, and therefore will not remark on it. The last
</p>
<p>I knew of this paper it was in the hands of Mr.
</p>
<p>Spencer. The parties now on trial can, and I trust
</p>
<p>will, satisfactorily explain how they lost possession of
</p>
<p>them. At present I am inclined to believe that Rath-
</p>
<p>bone either furnished, or was instrumental in furnishing,
</p>
<p>them all: perhaps he borrowed them for the purpose of
</p>
<p>negotiating for the exoneration of a greater number of

</p>
<p>the defendants ; but, as the district attorney could not
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 183
</p>
<p>have found in them sufficient for their ransom, Rathbone
</p>
<p> if my conjecture is right  converted the whole to save
</p>
<p>himself. At these contrivances  as at all my enemies
</p>
<p> I boldly hurl defiance, knowing that all the contri-
</p>
<p>vances in the world cannot convert innocence into guilt.
</p>
<p>Now, Mr. District Attorney, if you have any more
</p>
<p>papers that bear the mark of the finger of Jacob, let
</p>
<p>him have them, that he may dispose of the whole pack
</p>
<p>at the same time.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen of the jury, the district attorney took
</p>
<p>particular pains, in his opening speech, to draw down
</p>
<p>public indignation upon me. It was for the public, and
</p>
<p>not you, as he has not followed up his most aggravated
</p>
<p>allegations with a particle of proof. For instance, he
</p>
<p>stated that within six months immediately preceding
</p>
<p>the failure of the Life and Fire Insurance Company I
</p>
<p>had, as their agent, palmed oif on the community their
</p>
<p>bonds to the amount of $300,000, knowing them to be
</p>
<p>bad,  thus leading every bondholder to suppose I had
</p>
<p>defrauded him of their amount,  when it has been proved
</p>
<p>over and over again that I never sold a bond for the
</p>
<p>company, that I only sold ten thousand dollars' worth,
</p>
<p>and that they belonged to the Mercantile and Western
</p>
<p>Insurance Companies, and not to me or to the Life and
</p>
<p>Fire Company; and that of the person to whom I sold
</p>
<p>them I purchased a greater amount, and of others to a
</p>
<p>vast amount.
</p>
<p>''Not even an off'er, on my part, to sell has been
</p>
<p>proved, although he has unintentionally proved that

<p>SECOND TRIAL  RESOLUTIONS OF INSURANCE COM-

</p>
<p>The testimony was mucli the same as that adduced
</p>
<p>on the first trial, on which Mr. Barker remarked very
</p>
<p>much as he had then done, insisting that the public
</p>
<p>prosecutor had not established either of the charges
</p>
<p>made against him, and that he was as free from having
</p>
<p>done any wrong as a new-born babe. The case resulted
</p>
<p>unfavorably, however.
</p>
<p>On the evening of that day, when surrounded by his
</p>
<p>family and many sympathizing friends, the bell an-
</p>
<p>nounced another call, when the servant brought a letter
</p>
<p>from a gentleman of the first respectability, as follows : 
</p>
<p>"Friday Evening, December 1, 7 o'clock.
</p>
<p>" Sir :  This moment the writer learns from 'Butler's
</p>
<p>Bulletin' that the jury have returned a verdict of

<p>guilty in your trial, with others, for a conspiracy, &c.

<p>no interested motive in addressing these lines to you.
</p>
<p>But he cannot resist the impulse to say to you and
</p>
<p>your family, in the hope of in some degree assuaging
</p>
<p>the feelings which this occurrence must produce, that
</p>
<p>there is at least one wholly disinterested observer of

</p>
<p>as a victim to public prejudice. This opinion he has

<p>opinion.
</p>
<p>"That individual is your obedient servant,

</p>
<p>In a 'few days thereafter, he was presented with
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the directors of the insurance com-
</p>
<p>panies with which he was connected, as follows :

<p>"Mercantile Insurance Company, New York,

<p>the conduct of Jacob Barker in relation thereto, as

<p>appointed to perform that service."

<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 191
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII.
</p>
<p>JUDGE WOODWORTH'S OPINION.
</p>
<p>Thomas Vermiljea and others,
</p>
<p>adsm.
</p>
<p>The People.
</p>
<p>*'The defendants were convicted at a Court of Oyer
</p>
<p>and Terminer, held in the city of New York, of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to defraud certain incorporated companies and
</p>
<p>individuals of their goods, chattels, and effects. Appli-
</p>
<p>cation is now made for the allowance of a certiorari to
</p>
<p>remove the record and proceedings into the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court, for the purpose of reviewing the decision of the
</p>
<p>court below, on a challenge taken to some of the jurors,
</p>
<p>and also on the ground of fatal variance between the
</p>
<p>proof offered at the trial and the charges contained in
</p>
<p>the indictment. As to the latter, I will merely observe
</p>
<p>that a certiorari removes the record only; and, as the
</p>
<p>evidence produced on the trial forms no part of the re-
</p>
<p>cord, the writ would be a nugatory process. In criminal
</p>
<p>cases, where questions of law arise at the trial, either
</p>
<p>as to the admission of testimony, or its legal effect
</p>
<p>when admitted, if doubts are entertained, the facts are
</p>
<p>brought before this court in the form of a report, or case
</p>
<p>agreed on; if the objections afford reasonable ground
</p>
<p>for doubt, the presumption is that judgment would be
</p>
<p>suspended until the opinion of the superior court be

</p>
<p>known. As far as I know, questions of this descrip-
</p>
<p>192 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>tion have always been submitted to the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>in that manner. The experience of half a century has
</p>
<p>not called for any legislative provision to vary this
</p>
<p>course, or practice, nor am I aware that complaints have
</p>
<p>ever been made that the exercise of this discretion has
</p>
<p>been rigorous as respects the accused. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>it will be found that the cases from inferior tribunals,
</p>
<p>which have been reviewed, furnish no inconsiderable
</p>
<p>evidence of the solicitude and tenderness of our courts
</p>
<p>in allowing even to the greatest culprits the benefit of
</p>
<p>every legal objection.
</p>
<p>"If, however, in any given case the inferior court
</p>
<p>should erroneously refuse to interfere, it would afford no
</p>
<p>ground for a certiorari, because the remedy does not
</p>
<p>apply to or reach the error sought to be corrected.
</p>
<p>"If a bill of exceptions would lie in a criminal case,
</p>
<p>the difficulty would be removed; but it is well settled
</p>
<p>that it does not.
</p>
<p>"With respect to the admission of the jurors, I will
</p>
<p>confine my observations to the case of Andrew S. Nor-
</p>
<p>wood. From the affidavits and certificates of the clerk,
</p>
<p>it appears that Mr. Norwood was challenged for princi-
</p>
<p>pal cause, and the decision of the challenge referred to
</p>
<p>the court, without any objection on the part of the dis-
</p>
<p>trict attorney. The specific ground of the challenge
</p>
<p>was not in the first instance stated. The juror testified
</p>
<p>that he had heard all the evidence given on the former
</p>
<p>trial, having been present at it; that he had made up
</p>
<p>his opinion perfectly on the evidence that the defend-
</p>
<p>ants were all guilty, and had frequently expressed his
</p>
<p>opinion to that efi'ect; upon being inquired of by the
</p>
<p>district attorney, he stated that he felt no bias or par-

</p>
<p>tiality against any of the defendants ; that if the testi-
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 193
</p>
<p>mony given on this trial should appear as it did on the
</p>
<p>former, he should certainly find the defendants all
</p>
<p>guilty ; and added, that he thought he felt competent to
</p>
<p>give a verdict according to his oath and the evidence as
</p>
<p>it should appear.
</p>
<p>"The court decided that the juror stood indifferent,
</p>
<p>and that the challenge was not true ; he was accordingly
</p>
<p>sworn, and sat on the trial.
</p>
<p>"On this evidence two questions arise: first, whether
</p>
<p>the challenge forms a part of the record so as to be the
</p>
<p>subject of removal by certiorari? Second, whether the
</p>
<p>exception to the juror was well taken?
</p>
<p>" The first question depends on this : do the facts con-
</p>
<p>stitute a principal cause of challenge? This arises
</p>
<p>when there is a manifest presumption of partiality; in
</p>
<p>that case it excludes the juror; but a challenge to the
</p>
<p>favor, where the partiality is not apparent, must be left
</p>
<p>to the discretion of triers. The facts relied on generally
</p>
<p>consist of slight circumstances, respecting which the law
</p>
<p>has not laid down any certain rule: in such cases the
</p>
<p>judgment of the triers is conclusive. The question
</p>
<p>arising on such a challenge is altogether extrinsic of the
</p>
<p>record. Evidence may be reviewed in a superior court
</p>
<p>by a demurrer, or bill of exceptions ; but neither applies
</p>
<p>to evidence in support of a challenge for favor.
</p>
<p>"The next inquiry is, whether a principal cause of
</p>
<p>challenge may become parcel of the record, and under
</p>
<p>what circumstances? If it cannot in any case, it is
</p>
<p>unnecessary to consider the objection taken to the
</p>
<p>juror.
</p>
<p>"It is laid down in 3 Bac. 766, that 4f a challenge
</p>
<p>be taken and the other side demur, and it be debated,
</p>
<p>and the judge overrules it, it is entered upon the

</p>
<p>original record; and if at Nisi Prius, it appears upon
</p>
<p>the postea what the judge hath done; but if the judge
</p>
<p>overruled the challenge upon debate without a demurrer,
</p>
<p>then it is proper for a bill of exceptions.' Chittj, I. v.
</p>
<p>548, recognizes the same doctrine: he refers to Skin.
</p>
<p>101, and Hut. 24; it is also said, p. 549, that if a de-
</p>
<p>murrer be resolved on either to the array or to the polls,
</p>
<p>there is no occasion for those circumstances which must
</p>
<p>attend a demurrer to a plea, such as the signature of
</p>
<p>counsel ; but it is good as soon as agreed on at the bar,
</p>
<p>and the prothonotaries ought of right to enter it on
</p>
<p>the record. These cases suppose a principal cause of
</p>
<p>challenge, and establish the proposition, that where the
</p>
<p>facts alleged as cause of challenge are not disputed,
</p>
<p>the question is decided summarily by the court. On the
</p>
<p>argument before me, the attorney-general conceded the
</p>
<p>law to be, that if the challenge was good for principal
</p>
<p>cause, and the other party demurred, it became parcel
</p>
<p>of the record and might be removed: he contended,
</p>
<p>however, that this was not a challenge of that descrip-
</p>
<p>tion; that the facts made out a challenge for favor, and
</p>
<p>that the judge was substituted in the place of triers by
</p>
<p>consent of parties, and consequently that the question
</p>
<p>was to be viewed in the same manner as if it had been
</p>
<p>actually decided by the latter.
</p>
<p>"If it should turn out that the defendants have not
</p>
<p>established a principal cause of challenge, the argument
</p>
<p>is well founded. The real difficulty, if any exists, is in
</p>
<p>ascertaining whether the public prosecutor is to be con-
</p>
<p>sidered as having demurred to the challenge. The pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings in this stage were somewhat informal. The
</p>
<p>more regular course would have been to have stated in

</p>
<p>the first instance the facts relied on for cause; the
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 195
</p>
<p>prosecution would then, probably, have elected to plead
</p>
<p>or demur. It seems, however, that the juror was chal-
</p>
<p>lenged without specifying the cause, and the question
</p>
<p>referred to the court. What was referred to the court ?
</p>
<p>The juror was examined; there was no dispute about
</p>
<p>facts ; when that happens in the case of a principal
</p>
<p>challenge, as well as in that for favor, triers are ap-
</p>
<p>pointed. The court were called upon to pronounce the
</p>
<p>law to decide whether the facts made out a principal
</p>
<p>cause of challenge ; or, in other words, whether thej are
</p>
<p>sufficient to exclude the juror. I admit, if the facts
</p>
<p>were only proper to be submitted to triers, in support of
</p>
<p>a challenge for favor, the defendants are concluded by
</p>
<p>the decision of the judge ; but if per se they formed a
</p>
<p>principal cause, they may avail themselves as such. A
</p>
<p>demurrer is an admission of the fact, submitting the law
</p>
<p>arising on that fact to the court. On a demurrer to a
</p>
<p>challenge, no strict technical form seems to be required.
</p>
<p>Have not both parties conceded that the testimony of
</p>
<p>the juror was true? And have they not called on the
</p>
<p>court to declare the law arising on that testimony?
</p>
<p>Will it be denied that this is in substance a demurrer ?
</p>
<p>Or will it be gravely contended that because the party
</p>
<p>may not have said in terms he demurred to the chal-
</p>
<p>lenge, but submitted to the court whether it was suffi-
</p>
<p>cient in point of law, therefore a substantial difference
</p>
<p>exists between the two cases,  that the one shall be en-
</p>
<p>tered on the record and shall be subject to review, while
</p>
<p>the other is final and conclusive? I cannot persuade
</p>
<p>myself that the rights of any party are held by such a
</p>
<p>tenure, and, particularly, in a criminal case where there
</p>
<p>is no remedy by bill of exceptions. I am, therefore, of

</p>
<p>opinion that the judge having been called upon to de-
</p>
<p>196 LIFE OE JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>cide whether the challenge was valid in law, it is in
</p>
<p>substance the same as if the party had demurred in ex-
</p>
<p>press terms. If viewed in the light of a demurrer, it
</p>
<p>becomes parcel of the record, and is liable to be re-
</p>
<p>moved bj certiorari. That the counsel for the defend-
</p>
<p>ants considered the decision on the challenges as subject
</p>
<p>to the revision of a superior tribunal, and did all that
</p>
<p>was deemed necessary to secure that right, is apparent
</p>
<p>from the fact alleged in the affidavit of Mr. Hoyt, who
</p>
<p>says that the defendants' counsel requested the court to
</p>
<p>take down the testimony as to the competency of the
</p>
<p>jurors, in order to give the parties the benefit of review-
</p>
<p>ing the decision, and that the presiding judge, upon
</p>
<p>such request, read over the notes of evidence, and cor-
</p>
<p>rected the same in some particulars on the suggestion
</p>
<p>of the defendants' counsel. It is, however, contended
</p>
<p>that this case falls within that part of the doctrine laid
</p>
<p>down by Chitty and Bacon, where it is said that if the
</p>
<p>challenge is overruled without demurrer, on being de-
</p>
<p>bated, the objection may afterward be made the subject
</p>
<p>of a bill of exceptions; and, as no bill was taken, the
</p>
<p>decision could not be brought before the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>unless by consent. It seems to me this rule does not
</p>
<p>apply in criminal cases. Whether the counsel demurs
</p>
<p>the challenge, or merely argues that it is not good in
</p>
<p>law, creates no material distinction. If the distinction
</p>
<p>was ever entertained in the English courts, it must have
</p>
<p>been founded on a belief that a bill of exceptions would
</p>
<p>lie. But if it be a conceded point that no bill of excep-
</p>
<p>tions will lie, I think it goes far to show that the rule
</p>
<p>laid down is not applicable to criminal but civil cases.
</p>
<p>I have traced the doctrine to its source by examining

<p>the cases laid down by Chitty. They are to be found
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 197
</p>
<p>in Skinner 101, Hut. 24. The case from Skinner was
</p>
<p>decided 35 Charles XL, between the king and the city
</p>
<p>of Worcester. It was an information in the nature of
</p>
<p>a quo warranto. The case states that the counsel for the
</p>
<p>citj of Worcester came with their bill of exceptions ;
</p>
<p>thej challenged the array because the venire was re-
</p>
<p>turned as by both the coroners, when, in truth, but one
</p>
<p>of them returned it. They likewise challenged the polls,
</p>
<p>for want of freehold, which was overruled. No ques-
</p>
<p>tion was raised whether a bill of exceptions would lie.
</p>
<p>Saunders, Chief-Justice, said if the judge overruled the
</p>
<p>challenge upon debate without a demurrer, then it is
</p>
<p>proper for a bill of exceptions. There are several an-
</p>
<p>swers to this case if pressed on this application. The
</p>
<p>case in Skinner was not strictly a criminal proceeding.
</p>
<p>Informations at the common law partook of the nature
</p>
<p>of a civil remedy, and in modern times are considered
</p>
<p>as a civil remedy only. It must, I apprehend, have
</p>
<p>been so considered by the court, otherwise a bill of ex-
</p>
<p>ceptions would not have been suggested. This is evident
</p>
<p>from the fact that prior to the 35th of Charles II. the
</p>
<p>judges in England had expressed an opinion on this
</p>
<p>point.
</p>
<p>" In the cases of Sir Henry Yane, reported in Keelyn
</p>
<p>15, 2 St. Tri. 443, 14 Cat. 2, a construction is given to
</p>
<p>the statute, and held by all the judges, that the statute
</p>
<p>of W. 2 C. 31, which gives the bill of exceptions, extends
</p>
<p>only to civil causes, and not to criminal. Keelyn
</p>
<p>states that the court agreed, the words of the statute
</p>
<p>are as plain to this point. So, also, I. Keb. 324, where
</p>
<p>the same case is reported, the judges observe a bill of
</p>
<p>exceptions is not within the statute, or ever heard of,
</p>
<p>the statute not extending to any indictment. This case

<p>198 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>having been decided before the case of Skinner, it is
</p>
<p>manifest the court had no reference to criminal pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings when speaking of a bill of exceptions as ap-
</p>
<p>plicable to a challenge disposed of without demurrer.
</p>
<p>As a civil remedy, it may, undoubtedly, be pursued if
</p>
<p>there is no demurrer to the challenge in form; but
</p>
<p>even then, in a civil case, its necessity may well be
</p>
<p>questioned^ as will presently be shown. The case then
</p>
<p>leaves the principle untouched, that where the judge
</p>
<p>decides the law on a principal challenge, whether arising
</p>
<p>on demurrer or by a submission of the question, an
</p>
<p>entry is made on the record, which may be reviewed.
</p>
<p>" The decision in Skinner, upon which Chitty and
</p>
<p>Bacon rest, is an authority to prove there is a remedy
</p>
<p>where a good cause of challenge is overruled: it is an
</p>
<p>admission of this principle. The public prosecutor
</p>
<p>cannot be compelled to %emur : shall his refusal or
</p>
<p>omission deprive the accused of a right ? Can the right

<p>the case of Hesketh vs. Braddock, 3 Burrows, 1347, de-
</p>
<p>cided on a writ of error, proceeded. The record states

<p>that the defendant challenged the array, to which the

<p>defendant then ore tenus, in open court, challenged the

<p>the!^eupon the issue was tried, and a verdict found for
</p>
<p>the plaintiff. The Court of King's Bench considered

<p>the validity of the challenge and passed upon it as parcel

<p>of the record ; there was no suggestion by the court or

</p>
<p>murred to, but it was disallowed. On what principle
</p>
<p>did it become a part of the record? Manifestly because
</p>
<p>the decision of the court upon it was substantially the
</p>
<p>same as if a demurrer had been filed in form.
</p>
<p>"In 3 Woodeson, 357, N. in the form of the record in
</p>
<p>the case from Burrow is given. The challenge to the
</p>
<p>polls is thus entered :  ' And hereupon the said S. B.
</p>
<p>^ ore temts, in open court challengeth the polls, because
</p>
<p>he says that the jurors are citizens and freemen of the
</p>
<p>city of Chester ; which said challenge by the court here
</p>
<p>is disallowed.' Professor Woodeson states that the chal-
</p>
<p>lenge ore tenus was omitted in the first engrossment of
</p>
<p>the record ; that the defendant alleged diminution ; and
</p>
<p>that it was then inserted by rule. The case sanctions
</p>
<p>the doctrines contended for by the defendant's counsel,
</p>
<p>that the challenge may be removed as parcel of ,the
</p>
<p>record, provided it was a principal cause of challenge.
</p>
<p>"The only remaining question is, whether the facts
</p>
<p>stated by the juror constituted a principal cause of chal-
</p>
<p>lenge.
</p>
<p>"It will not be denied that every man, whether in a
</p>
<p>civil or criminal case, is entitled to an impartial jury.
</p>
<p>Though our constitution merely preserves the trial by
</p>
<p>jury inviolate forever, and does not, in express terms,
</p>
<p>guarantee an impartial jury, yet, ex vi termini, it is em-
</p>
<p>braced in its provisions, as much so, as that the judges
</p>
<p>shall be impartial men. The same general principle is
</p>
<p>adopted by the English law: the only question is as to
</p>
<p>the application of the principle. Can a juror be im-
</p>
<p>partial or indifferent to the question who from a know-
</p>
<p>ledge of the facts confesses that he has made up his
</p>
<p>mind that the accused are guilty? It is a fallacy to

</p>
<p>suppose such a man stands impartial, merely because he
</p>
<p>200 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>has no malice or ill will against the defendant. This
</p>
<p>doctrine, however, has* been strenuously urged, and cases
</p>
<p>have been cited to show that the law is so understood in
</p>
<p>England.
</p>
<p>''The case of the King vs. Edmunds and others, 4
</p>
<p>Barn, and Al. 170, Chief-Justice Abbot observes, that
</p>
<p>expressions used by a juryman are not a cause of chal-
</p>
<p>lenge, unless they are to be referred to something of
</p>
<p>personal ill will toward the party challenging. He re-
</p>
<p>lies on the doctrine laid down in the year-books, 7 Hen.
</p>
<p>6, fol. 25, where Babington, Justice, says, ' If the juror
</p>
<p>has sai(f he will pass with the one party, for the know-
</p>
<p>ledge he has of the matter, and of the truth, he is indif-
</p>
<p>ferent; but if he has said so for any affection of the
</p>
<p>party, he is favorable.' Hawkins, B. 2, ch. 43, S. 28,
</p>
<p>is also referred to. He observes, 'that it hath been
</p>
<p>allowed a good cause of challenge, that the juror hath
</p>
<p>declared his opinion beforehand, that the party is guilty,
</p>
<p>or will be hanged, or the like.' Hawkins adds, 'Yet it
</p>
<p>hath been adjudged that if it shall appear that the juror
</p>
<p>made such declaration from his knowledge of the cause,
</p>
<p>and not out of any ill will to the party, it is no cause
</p>
<p>of challenge.' The opinion of the Court of King's
</p>
<p>Bench, in Barn, and AL, rests on these ancient authori-
</p>
<p>ties; it does not profess to consider the soundness of
</p>
<p>the doctrine advanced. Now, admitting the law had
</p>
<p>been so applied at an early day, when the prisoner did
</p>
<p>not possess even the right of producing testimony, I
</p>
<p>apprehend that after the lapse of centuries, when the
</p>
<p>rights of parties are better understood, and have been
</p>
<p>more accurately defined, it would not be presumption
</p>
<p>to inquire whether the common law relative to the right

</p>
<p>of challenge had not, in this instance, been misapplied ;
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 201
</p>
<p>or whether it was consistent with the law as laid down
</p>
<p>by Lord Coke, B. 2, 155 a., who says, 'The rule of law
</p>
<p>is, that the juror must stand indifferent as he stands un-
</p>
<p>sworn.' It seems to be admitted in some of the old
</p>
<p>cases, that an opinion formed and expressed is good
</p>
<p>cause of challenge. Upon what is this founded? On
</p>
<p>the supposition that it creates a bias. All experience
</p>
<p>goes to prove the infirmity of huni^n nature is such,
</p>
<p>that we cannot, at pleasure, get rid of preconceived
</p>
<p>opinions. The question is not how great is the bias, but
</p>
<p>does any exist? The least is suflScient to exclude. Can
</p>
<p>the source from whence it is derived be material? As
</p>
<p>to the accused, it is the same thing whether the bias
</p>
<p>proceeds from a preconceived opinion, or malice and
</p>
<p>ill will; be it either, he is equally affected. Why,
</p>
<p>then, superadd the necessity of proving malice or ill
</p>
<p>will? Without it, the parties do not contend on equal
</p>
<p>ground, by requiring it to be proved in order to exclude
</p>
<p>the juror, it only shows the disparity to be greater. If
</p>
<p>the question was entirely novel, I should think our
</p>
<p>courts would incline to take a different view of the ques-
</p>
<p>tion. But it has occurred here, and has been well con-
</p>
<p>sidered. The Supreme Court decided in the case of
</p>
<p>Blake vs. Millspaugh, J. John. 316, it was good cause of
</p>
<p>challenge to a juror that he had previously given his
</p>
<p>opinion on the question in controversy between the
</p>
<p>parties. The case of Durree vs. Mosher, 8 John. 445,
</p>
<p>is not contradictory : there the juror said, if the reports
</p>
<p>of the neighbors were correct, the defendant was wrong
</p>
<p>and the plaintiff was right ; no definite opinion was ex-
</p>
<p>pressed or formed ; the court so adjudged, and observed
</p>
<p>that the declaration wa-s hypothetical. It is no more

<p>than saying, if the defendant has done an illegal act,
</p>
<p>202 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>let him answer for it, which is no evidence of partiality.
</p>
<p>In the case of Pringle vs. Huse, 1 Cowan, 432, a juror
</p>
<p>was challenged for having expressed an opinion against
</p>
<p>the plaintiff; it was held that this was a principal cause
</p>
<p>of challenge, and should be tried bj the court, and that
</p>
<p>the juror challenged may be called as a witness. In
</p>
<p>the case of Coleman vs. Hagerman, the same prin-
</p>
<p>ciple was adopted by the Supreme Court. The late
</p>
<p>Chief-Justice Spencer has furnished me with a manu-
</p>
<p>script opinion of his in that cause. It was an action
</p>
<p>for an assault and battery of an aggravated character;
</p>
<p>the verdict was for four thousand dollars damages.
</p>
<p>The grounds of the motion were that Graham, one of
</p>
<p>the jury, had made use of language indicating an
</p>
<p>opinion that the defendant ought to be exemplarily
</p>
<p>punished. It appeared that Graham was wholly unac-
</p>
<p>quainted with the parties until after the trial, and that
</p>
<p>the opinions expressed by him were founded on news-
</p>
<p>paper publications. He swore that he had no bias
</p>
<p>against, or partiality for, either of the parties, and per-
</p>
<p>sonally knew nothing of the assault and battery com-
</p>
<p>plained of: yet the court unanimously awarded a new
</p>
<p>trial, on the ground that Graham did not stand indiffer-
</p>
<p>ent, in consequence of the opinions he had expressed.
</p>
<p>In the manuscript opinion referred to, the late chief-
</p>
<p>justice stated the principles adopted by him, on the
</p>
<p>then recent trial of Van Anstyne for the murder of
</p>
<p>Huddlestone. It was thus :  If a person had formed or
</p>
<p>expressed an opinion for or against the prisoner on the
</p>
<p>knowledge of any of the facts attending the murder, or
</p>
<p>from information of those acquainted with the facts, he
</p>
<p>considered it good cause of challenge ; but if the opinions

</p>
<p>of the jurors were formed on mere rumors and report, he
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 203
</p>
<p>decided that such opinions did not disqualify the jurors ;
</p>
<p>and, as I understood, the opinions delivered on that
</p>
<p>solemn occasion met the decided approbation of the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court.
</p>
<p>''The principle upon which these cases were decided
</p>
<p>was, that any opinion formed and expressed by a juror
</p>
<p>is of itself evidence that he did not stand indifferent
</p>
<p>between the parties. I do not perceive how the case
</p>
<p>before me can be distinguished. On the trial of Fries
</p>
<p>for treason, before Judge Iredell, on an application for
</p>
<p>a new trial, one question was as to the competency of a
</p>
<p>juror who had expressed himself in strong terms as to
</p>
<p>the prisoner's guilt. That learned judge put the ques-
</p>
<p>tion on this ground, that when a predetermined opinion
</p>
<p>is formed, from whatever motives, it creates an im-
</p>
<p>proper bias extremely difficult to get rid of, and may
</p>
<p>influence an honest man unwarily to give a wrong ver-
</p>
<p>dict ; that he becomes less able to discriminate facts.
</p>
<p>The reasoning of Chief-Justice Marshall on the trial
</p>
<p>of Colonel Burr (vol. 1, pp. 370, 419) is directly in
</p>
<p>point. He has shown in the most satisfactory manner
</p>
<p>that a juror who has given his opinion cannot be con-
</p>
<p>sidered impartial ; that the natural tendency of pre-
</p>
<p>conceived opinions in a juror is to obstruct the impar-
</p>
<p>tial administration of justice. He asks why a distant
</p>
<p>relative, or he who has prejudices, cannot serve on a
</p>
<p>jury ? Because he is presumed to have a bias. He
</p>
<p>may declare that, notwithstanding, he is determined to
</p>
<p>listen to the evidence and be governed by it ; but the
</p>
<p>law will not trust him. The chief-justice observes,
</p>
<p>'Is there less reason to suspect him who has prejudged
</p>
<p>the case and deliberately formed and delivered an

<p>opinion upon it ? The law suspects him, and not with-

</p>
<p>out reason : he will listen with more favor to that testi-
</p>
<p>mony which confirms than to that which would change
</p>
<p>his opinion. It is not to be expected that he will weigh
</p>
<p>evidence or argument as fairly as a man whose judg-
</p>
<p>ment is not made up in the case.' These enlightened
</p>
<p>views place the question upon the true ground ; not
</p>
<p>whether the juror feels resentment or ill will, but
</p>
<p>whether, for any cause, he has a bias on his mind that
</p>
<p>may disqualify him from deciding with strict impar-
</p>
<p>tiality. I entirely concur in the reasoning of that case
</p>
<p>as containing a luminous exposition of the ground upon
</p>
<p>which the rule is founded.
</p>
<p>"The result of my opinion is, that enough has been
</p>
<p>shown to render the decision in the court below ques-
</p>
<p>tionable ; that the challenge forms a part of the record ;
</p>
<p>and that the defendants are entitled to the allowance of
</p>
<p>a certiorari."

<p>CHAPTER XIII.
</p>
<p>MAXWELL BEFORE THE GRAND JURY.
</p>
<p>The reader of the preceding pages will have no diffi-
</p>
<p>culty in discovering that the bone of contention in the
</p>
<p>conspiracy against Mr. Barker has, in addition to the
</p>
<p>efforts of the guilty to escape by creating suspicions
</p>
<p>against the innocent, been the securities received from
</p>
<p>the Life and Fire Company.
</p>
<p>A conspiracy was formed immediately after the first

<p>trial, by a portion of the accused and others connected
</p>
<p>with the incorporations in question,  in which transac-

<p>tions Mr. Barker had no part or lot,  to shield the guilty
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BAllKEH. 205
</p>
<p>and make Mr. Barker answerable for the errors of the
</p>
<p>real offenders. This conspiracy was in part concocted at
</p>
<p>the house of Josiah Haden. Maxwell there met many
</p>
<p>of the untried individuals, who were made to understand
</p>
<p>that, if Jacob Barker could be convicted. Maxwell
</p>
<p>would be satisfied to let the others off. Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>having obtained what he considered sufiicient evidence
</p>
<p>of that conspiracy, went before the grand jury and
</p>
<p>made a formal complaint against some of the parties ;
</p>
<p>it was near the close of the session of the grand jury,
</p>
<p>so that they had no time to investigate the matter. On
</p>
<p>receiving notice of this fact, Mr. Barker repaired again
</p>
<p>to the jury-room and requested a return of his proofs ;
</p>
<p>Maxwell, appearing before them, resisted his application,
</p>
<p>demanding to have the papers delivered to him ; Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker objected, saying to the grand jury that if they
</p>
<p>allowed Maxwell to have them, he would not allow him the
</p>
<p>use of them on his trial ; that his object was to protect
</p>
<p>others at his expense. The grand jury offered to return
</p>
<p>them to Mr. Barker if he would withdraw his complaint :
</p>
<p>this he refused to do, when Maxwell insisted on their
</p>
<p>being filed in court, to be handed to the next grand jury
</p>
<p>as unfinished business, pledging himself that Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>should have the benefit of them on his trial, whereupon
</p>
<p>they filed them in court, to be presented to the next
</p>
<p>grand jury.
</p>
<p>Maxwell followed the grand jury into court the
</p>
<p>moment they had delivered the papers to the clerk ; he
</p>
<p>took up the bundle, selected therefrom six letters from
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford to Mr. Barker, and attempted to leave the
</p>
<p>court. Mr. Hatfield, the clerk, called him back before
</p>
<p>he reached the door, that he might take a memorandum
</p>
<p>of the papers he was about carrying off. He did so ;

</p>
<p>and these letters were never thereafter seen by the
</p>
<p>court, nor by Mr. Barker, nor by the clerk of the court,
</p>
<p>until after the whole proceedings had been dismissed.
</p>
<p>So sacred have the files of the court heretofore been
</p>
<p>considered, that papers once placed there could not be
</p>
<p>obtained for the use of any other court, except brought
</p>
<p>by its authority, and then always accompanied by the
</p>
<p>clerk, their legal guardian.
</p>
<p>Pending the negotiation between Maxwell and the
</p>
<p>conspirators to let them off if they would furnish
</p>
<p>evidence to convict Jacob Barker, a lady called at Mr.,
</p>
<p>Barker's house in the night, and informed him that she
</p>
<p>had overheard a conversation of these men, or some of
</p>
<p>them, when it was stated that they must destroy Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, or he would destroy them.
</p>
<p>The judge having made many errors in stating the
</p>
<p>evidence to the jury, and Maxwell's published speech
</p>
<p>being calculated to mislead, Mr. Barker, knowing him-
</p>
<p>self to be innocent, reviewed the case, and made some
</p>
<p>remarks about his previous difficulties with one of the
</p>
<p>jury, and about the manner in which they were drawn,
</p>
<p>which the district attorney denominated libels and
</p>
<p>brought two suits therefor. On the trial, the ruling of
</p>
<p>the recorder was such, that Mr. Barker took exceptions
</p>
<p>thereto, the recorder promising to give him an opportu-
</p>
<p>nity to have the case reviewed by the Supreme Court;
</p>
<p>in consequence of which, relying on the soundness of
</p>
<p>his exceptions, he refused to sum up.
</p>
<p>The jury, under an illegal charge from the recorder,
</p>
<p>sustained the complaint.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker made the necessary statement to have the
</p>
<p>case reviewed by the Supreme Court. The recorder pro-

</p>
<p>ing on this promise, and that judgment would conse-

<p>quently be deferred until the decision of the Supreme

<p>case sooner.

<p>CHAPTER XIV. '
</p>
<p>RICHARD RIKER, RECORDER OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
</p>
<p>On the last day of the term, when, but foi* the afore-
</p>
<p>said arrangement, it would have been regular for judg-
</p>
<p>ment to have been pronounced, the recorder, on going
</p>
<p>into court, met Dudley Selden, Esq., the friend of Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, and informed him that if he had any thing to
</p>
<p>say on the subject of his case, it must be said before
</p>
<p>one o'clock that day. Mr. Barker was notified thereof,
</p>
<p>and hastened to the court for the purpose of remon-
</p>
<p>strating. On his way thither he had the good fortune
</p>
<p>to meet his friend, Thomas Addis Emmett, Esq., who

<p>accompanied him to the court and made the following

<p>with the facts set forth in the afiidavit read to the court,
</p>
<p>208 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>induced me to believe that an argument would not now
</p>
<p>be required.
</p>
<p>"Although unprepared, I hope, from general reason-
</p>
<p>ing upon the law of libel, to be able to satisfy the court
</p>
<p>that they ought not to suffer sentence to pass against
</p>
<p>the defendant. The argument I am about to offer to the
</p>
<p>court I can present with the more confidence, from being
</p>
<p>able to say that when I read the testimony and pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings on t'his trial in the public newspapers, and
</p>
<p>before I was engaged in, or could have anticipated any
</p>
<p>connection with, this cause, when it passed under my
</p>
<p>review merely as a common observer, noting it among
</p>
<p>the occurrences of the day, I was surprised at the law
</p>
<p>laid down in the course of the trial, and seriously
</p>
<p>doubted its accuracy.
</p>
<p>" Setting aside the particular facts of this case, it
</p>
<p>seems to me that a rule has been laid down by this
</p>
<p>court which is matter of vast public concern, and which
</p>
<p>it behooves us all to examine well, if we Avould sustain
</p>
<p>the liberty of the press, and give full and proper scope
</p>
<p>to the freedom of discussion.
</p>
<p>"I need not tell the court that I allude to that rule
</p>
<p>wherein they have said that malice is not a constituent
</p>
<p>part of the offence to be passed upon by the jury, and
</p>
<p>wherein they have also said that unless the defendant
</p>
<p>can prove the truth of the libel, proof of the motive
</p>
<p>with which he published it is not to be addressed to the
</p>
<p>jury, but to the court in mitigation of punishment after

<p>much more so in an indictment. I scarcely know,
</p>

</p>
<p>indeed, I may say, there is not in the whole range of
</p>
<p>criminal law, a case, except where an act has been
</p>
<p>created a positive oiFence by statute, where the motives
</p>
<p>of the defendant do not become the subject of proof
</p>
<p>before the jury. In murder there must be predeter-
</p>
<p>mined malice proved or inferred. Even in man-
</p>
<p>slaughter accidental killing is not enough: there must
</p>
<p>be proof of sudden passion, or death arising from an
</p>
<p>intentional wrong of some kind.
</p>
<p>" Let me not be understood that the prosecutor must
</p>
<p>prove malice apart from the libel. The doubt which
</p>
<p>may arise relative to the proposition which I have laid
</p>
<p>down is not on account of any defect in the proposition,
</p>
<p>but in the introduction and application of testimony.
</p>
<p>Thus, in murder, when it is proved that one man killed
</p>
<p>another, the jury may infer, from proof of the fact and
</p>
<p>manner of killing, that it was done maliciously, but it
</p>
<p>will not be urged that the party charged cannot show it
</p>
<p>was done in self-defence. So in libel the jury may
</p>
<p>infer from reading the libel itself that the motive of the
</p>
<p>publication was malicious, and they ought so to infer
</p>
<p>when it calumniates character without cause and with-
</p>
<p>out excuse ; yet still the publisher may show from other
</p>
<p>parts of the publication, and from extrinsic facts, that
</p>
<p>the publication was without malice and for justifiable
</p>
<p>cause.
</p>
<p>" It may, perhaps, be said that malice is a question
</p>
<p>of law and not of fact. To a certain extent, high
</p>
<p>authorities may be produced to support and contradict
</p>
<p>that position, but only to a certain extent ; for I believe
</p>
<p>it never has been maintained except where the defend-
</p>
<p>ant has offered no evidence to establish a justifying
</p>
<p>excuse. Where he has offered any, that, and with that

</p>
<p>the whole matter, must be submitted to the jury. But,
</p>
<p>as it is unnecessary to discuss that point, I shall content
</p>
<p>myself with saying that I think the judges who have
</p>
<p>considered malice under any circumstances as an in-
</p>
<p>ference of law have confounded prima facie presump-
</p>
<p>tions from uncontradicted and unexplained testimony,
</p>
<p>and therefore conclusive presumptions from evidence,
</p>
<p>with legal infer encef. I do not believe that malicious in-
</p>
<p>tention is projDorly a presumption of law, either in civil
</p>
<p>or criminal cases ; but even if it be, that can make no
</p>
<p>difference in criminal prosecutions, wherein our system
</p>
<p>of the law expressly provides that the jury are judges
</p>
<p>of the law as well as of the facts ; and, therefore, in
</p>
<p>either point of view they are to pass on the intention of
</p>
<p>the publisher as a constituent part of the offence. Two
</p>
<p>of the jurors, at different times, clearly expressed their
</p>
<p>opinions that malice was not imputable to Mr. Barker;
</p>
<p>perhaps the others thought the same thing. So strong
</p>
<p>was that opinion, that the jury came in to ask the
</p>
<p>opinion of the court whether they might acquit the de-
</p>
<p>fendant if they thought he had no malice. To which
</p>
<p>the court replied by the charge of which I most re-
</p>
<p>spectfully but strenuously complain. Suppose the jury
</p>
<p>had brought in their verdict that Mr. Barker had pub-
</p>
<p>lished the matter set forth in the indictment, but not
</p>
<p>maliciously: could the court consider this anything but
</p>
<p>a general verdict of acquittal ? At any rate, could the
</p>
<p>court convict the defendant on it ? How then can it
</p>
<p>be- said they have nothing to do with the question of
</p>
<p>malice or no malice, when their verdict negativing it
</p>
<p>would have acquitted the defendant? And can any

<p>man undertake to say that if the jury had not received
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 211
</p>
<p>this explicit or erroneous charge from the court, they
</p>
<p>would ever have brought in a verdict of guilty ?
</p>
<p>"During the struggles in England relative to the law
</p>
<p>of libel, I do not believe that it was ever seriously con-
</p>
<p>tended that malice was not at the foundation of the
</p>
<p>offence. In all the inroads which were made upon the
</p>
<p>law of libel before, and more especially by, Lord Mans-
</p>
<p>field and his successors, and to restore which the act of
</p>
<p>Parliament was passed, the doctrine that the malicious
</p>
<p>intent of the writer or publisher was not, either as
</p>
<p>matter of law or fact, the test whereby the crime was
</p>
<p>to be judged, was never avowed. I consider that the
</p>
<p>decisions which went to restrain the rights of jurors to
</p>
<p>judge whether the publication was a libel or not,
</p>
<p>whether it improperly reflected upon the conduct or
</p>
<p>character of the prosecutor, which prevented the truth
</p>
<p>from being evidence, were innovations upon the com-
</p>
<p>mon law, and that the intervention of legislative
</p>
<p>power was not to correct any error or supply any de-
</p>
<p>ficiency in that law, but to put an end to the inno-
</p>
<p>vations upon the rights of jurors which Lord Mansfield
</p>
<p>particularly had attempted to make. * The English
</p>
<p>statutes and our statutes were passed, not for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of giving more extended liberty to writers and
</p>
<p>publishers, but to restore these rights in those parts
</p>
<p>where they have been invaded, and for that reason their
</p>
<p>phraseology and provisions are confined to those rights.
</p>
<p>We must, therefore, not look to the statutes for the
</p>
<p>purpose of ascertaining what defence the publisher may
</p>
<p>make, or to show to what extent he may prove his
</p>
<p>motives, or that he published without malice, but we
</p>
<p>must look to the common law, and, although the statute

</p>
<p>says nothing as to the malicious intent of the party, the
</p>
<p>212 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>strong and only inference is that in this particumr the
</p>
<p>rights of the press had not been openly violated.
</p>
<p>''If the motives of the party be matter to be passed
</p>
<p>upon by the jury as a constituent part of the offence,
</p>
<p>then I say proof of those motives is to be addressed to
</p>
<p>them, and not to the court in mitigation of punishment.
</p>
<p>Nothing is to be submitted exclusively to the court by
</p>
<p>affidavit that goes to the gist of the crime. The facts
</p>
<p>which are to be presented to the court in mitigation are
</p>
<p>properly those which cannot be resorted to as a defence,
</p>
<p> facts which do not go to show that a verdict of guilty
</p>
<p>ought not to be rendered, but that, although the crime
</p>
<p>has been committed, it has been committed under such
</p>
<p>circumstances as to call for iliercy, even at the hands of
</p>
<p>justice.
</p>
<p>"If I am right in what I have said, then the defend-
</p>
<p>ant ought to have been allowed to give in evidence any
</p>
<p>facts, whether they constitute a part of the publication
</p>
<p>or not, which can by any possibility be associated with .
</p>
<p>the motive for jDublication, however slight that connec-
</p>
<p>tion may be, and the jurors, either as passing on the
</p>
<p>law or the fact, are to judge of the motive, whether just
</p>
<p>or malicious, and the weight and bearing of the testi-
</p>
<p>mony. Were it otherwise, the court, by keeping back the
</p>
<p>testimony, would constitute themselves the sole judges
</p>
<p>of the purpose of the publication, and of the malice
</p>
<p>of the publisher. Under this view it appears to me
</p>
<p>that the testimony which was rejected by the cou'^t, and
</p>
<p>which is set forth in the third and fourth points of the
</p>
<p>case read, ought to have been admitted. As to the
</p>
<p>pamphlet itself, it seems to me not susceptible of a

<p>doubt but that the defendant was entitled to have the

</p>
<p>"But let us examine the libel itself as set forth in
</p>
<p>the indictment, and the testimony given for the purpose
</p>
<p>of seeing whether the testimony ought not to have been
</p>
<p>received, in order to show the truth of the publication.
</p>
<p>"The nature of that publication, I confess, as treated
</p>
<p>by the court, seems to me to have been misunderstood.
</p>
<p>It has been taken for granted as charging Mr. Hatfield
</p>
<p>with corrupt conduct, and on that interpretation of it
</p>
<p>most of the decisions of the court depend, I view it
</p>
<p>differently. It charges no corruption on Mr. Hatfield ;
</p>
<p>it only states facts, from which the reader would be led
</p>
<p>to infer corruption; but it would be the inference of the
</p>
<p>mind, not the allegation of Mr. Barker. He stated
</p>
<p>them as circumstances which caused him alarm and
</p>
<p>anxiety, and he did no more. As to him, then, the
</p>
<p>only inquiry should have -been. Were the facts true ?
</p>
<p>Were the alarm and anxiety real, and had they a
</p>
<p>rational foundation ? If these matters were proved, he
</p>
<p>could certainly avail himself of the constitutional de-
</p>
<p>fence that he published the truth wdth good motives
</p>
<p>and for a justifiable end; and, as the first thing to be
</p>
<p>proved was that he published the truth, he should have
</p>
<p>been permitted to give in evidence every thing that
</p>
<p>tended to prove the truth of the facts he had stated in
</p>
<p>his publication.
</p>
<p>"In addition to other facts, he has proved that after
</p>
<p>the general panel had been drawn  which consisted of
</p>
<p>two hundred  he informed Mr. Strong that there were
</p>
<p>three on that pnnel who ought not to sit on a jury to
</p>
<p>try him, that they were personally hostile to him, and
</p>
<p>that Mr. Davenport and Mr. Norwood were two of
</p>
<p>them, and he thinks Mr. Mead was the third ; that Mr.

</p>
<p>Davenport was the first juror drawn from that panel.
</p>
<p>214 LIFE OF JACOB BAllKER.
</p>
<p>and Mr. Norwood the second, and Mr. Mead the fifth ;
</p>
<p>that the mode in which the box containing the ballots
</p>
<p>of jurors was shaken by Mr. Hatfield attracted the
</p>
<p>observation of a bystander, who thought it was moved
</p>
<p>in a manner not to agitate the ballots ; and at the
</p>
<p>time it so much excited the defendant's attention that
</p>
<p>he went to the clerk and asked for the liberty to
</p>
<p>shake the ballot-box, which was refused. This testi-
</p>
<p>mony was given or ofi'ered to prove the truth of the
</p>
<p>libel, by showing that the facts averred in the publica-
</p>
<p>tion were truly stated, that there was apprehension 
</p>
<p>and, if the court please, good ground to apprehend 
</p>
<p>as to the accidental drawing of the jury, and that the
</p>
<p>mind of the defendant was truly and justifiably filled
</p>
<p>with doubt and alarm. Indeed, there is but one asser-
</p>
<p>tion upon the face of this libel the truth of which is not
</p>
<p>entirely proved.
</p>
<p>^'I humbly contend that the court erred in their view
</p>
<p>of the publication when they charged the jury that they
</p>
<p>must either convict Mr. Hatfield  a witness in the case
</p>
<p> or Mr. Barker. As the bringing home a paper by
</p>
<p>the accredited agent, who received it from a member of
</p>
<p>the legislature, was not criminal, and, therefore, if an
</p>
<p>innocent though mistaken allegation of that kind was
</p>
<p>made, it was not a libel ; and also that the court erred
</p>
<p>when they rejected all proof that did not go to establish
</p>
<p>corruption in Mr. Hatfield, and refused to admit proof
</p>
<p>of the facts stated in the publication as the foundation
</p>
<p>for the defendant's alarm, and which would unquestion-
</p>
<p>ably show that there was very justifiable cause for
</p>
<p>alarm.

<p>proved by the defendant, as they must have presented
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 215
</p>
<p>themselves to liis mind, it must be obvious that it would
</p>
<p>have required more than common confidence in in-
</p>
<p>dividual integrity, not to have apprehended that this
</p>
<p>was not all the result of accident, and more especially
</p>
<p>when we consider the situation of the defendant as one
</p>
<p>on trial. Here are twelve jurors to be drawn from a
</p>
<p>panel of two hundred. The chance that Mr. Davenport
</p>
<p>was to be drawn first was as one to two hundred.
</p>
<p>The chance that Mr. Davenport and Mr. Norwood
</p>
<p>would be drawn the two first was as the square of
</p>
<p>two hundred, or as one to forty thousand. When
</p>
<p>we consider, in connection with this, that Mr. Mead
</p>
<p>was also on the jury, that the chances that Mr. Daven-
</p>
<p>port, Mr. Norwood, and Mr. Mead, the only three per-
</p>
<p>sons previously designated as objectionable and hostile
</p>
<p>by Mr. Barker, would not all be on the jury, would
</p>
<p>be infinitely greater ; and, further, that the two first
</p>
<p>jurors might become triers of the qualifications of the
</p>
<p>other jurors, and admit them into the jury-box, and that
</p>
<p>these two jurors were the personal enemies of the de-
</p>
<p>fendant ; and I ask what ordinary mind could withstand
</p>
<p>the conclusion that all was not accidental in the drawing
</p>
<p>of the jury. With chances forty thousand  yes, forty
</p>
<p>millions  to one against the happening of an event that
</p>
<p>did happen, attended with the other circumstances which
</p>
<p>arose on that trial, who will tell me that the mind of
</p>
<p>any man whose interests were deeply involved in the
</p>
<p>result would have no misgivings,  that the party on trial
</p>
<p>would be filled with doubt and alarm ? It is impossible;
</p>
<p>a mind so situated could not resist such doubts ; no con-
</p>
<p>fidence is strong enough to encounter these things and
</p>
<p>not hesitate. I, who in these latter days am more

</p>
<p>them, they must have believed that there was good
</p>
<p>ground for doubt, apprehension, and alarm."
</p>
<p>This speech availed nothing. The recorder, being bent
</p>
<p>on his purpose, proceeded to fine Mr. Barker for the
</p>
<p>alleged offence two hundred and fifty dollars in each case ;
</p>
<p>they were taken to the Supreme Court, which decided that,
</p>
<p>the penalty being inflicted, and the money paid, they could
</p>
<p>not interfere ; that if they should reverse the judgment
</p>
<p>their decision would be a nullity, the money having passed

<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 219
</p>
<p>he drew inferences unfavorable to some of the officers
</p>
<p>of the court and jury. That he may have been, and no
</p>
<p>doubt was, mistaken in ascribing improper motives to
</p>
<p>some of them ; but his peculiar situation, his ignorance
</p>
<p>of the facts which have since been developed, and his
</p>
<p>knowledge that there was fraud somewhere, will, he
</p>
<p>hopes and trusts, furnish good reasons to believe that
</p>
<p>his publication was without malice.
</p>
<p>"And jour memorialist further represents that for
</p>
<p>such publication the said district attorney procured two
</p>
<p>several bills of indictment for libel against your memo-
</p>
<p>rialist, the one for a libel upon Abraham B. Mead, one
</p>
<p>of the jury, and the other for a libel upon Richard Hat-
</p>
<p>field, clerk of the court of oyer and terminer, which he
</p>
<p>tried before the court of sessions, in which the said
</p>
<p>Richard Riker presided. That the indictment for a
</p>
<p>libel on the said Richard Hatfield was first tried. That
</p>
<p>the said Richard Riker there refused to allow your me-
</p>
<p>morialist to jDrove that there was no malice in the said
</p>
<p>publication, noted the exceptions made by your memo-
</p>
<p>rialist, and promised to give him an opportunity of
</p>
<p>having the case reviewed before the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>That relying upon that promise, and upon the certainty
</p>
<p>that his errors were palpable and conclusive, and alto-
</p>
<p>gether sufficient to render void the whole proceedings,
</p>
<p>your memorialist declined summing up. That the said
</p>
<p>Richard Riker charged the jury that malice was not
</p>
<p>necessary to sustain an indictment for a libel, and that
</p>
<p>the matters published . being true was no justification.
</p>
<p>That by such means he induced the jury to pronounce

<p>the said publication a libel, although they, at the time,

</p>
<p>coming in of the verdict in the case of the said Richard
</p>
<p>Hatfield to the said Richard Riker for a statement of
</p>
<p>the case to be taken to the Supreme Court, and he
</p>
<p>promised Dudley Selden, Esq., the counsel of your me-
</p>
<p>morialist, that the subject should be considered during
</p>
<p>the coming vacation ; on which promise, as also on the
</p>
<p>previous promise of giving your memorialist an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of having the case reviewed, your memorialist
</p>
<p>relied, and did not prepare to oppose a final decision at
</p>
<p>that term. That, on the last day of the term, the said
</p>
<p>Richard Riker met the said Dudley Selden as he was
</p>
<p>going into court, and stated to him, that if your memo-
</p>
<p>rialist had any thing to say on the subject of his case,
</p>
<p>it must be said before one o'clock on that day. That
</p>
<p>your memorialist procured the assistance of the
</p>
<p>late Thomas Addis Emmett, Esq., who reminded the
</p>
<p>said Richard Riker of his promise to consider the case
</p>
<p>during the coming vacation, and pointed out the unpre-
</p>
<p>pared state of your memorialist for the argument, his
</p>
<p>cause for alarm, the absence of malice, and the errors
</p>
<p>of the said Richard Riker in rejecting testimony and in
</p>
<p>laying down the law, and entreated a new trial, or, at
</p>
<p>any rate, delay until the opinion of the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>should be known; but all was unavailing. That the said
</p>
<p>Richard Riker proceeded immediately to pass sentence,
</p>
<p>imposing on your memorialist a heavy fine, and requiring
</p>
<p>him to give security in his own bond for two thousand
</p>
<p>dollars, and two sureties of one thousand dollars each,
</p>
<p>for his good conduct for two years. That this latter

<p>condition was, in the opinion of your memorialist, a

<p>, violation of the Constitution of the State, and that, had

</p>
<p>such a decision, much less was the said Richard Riker

<p>warranted in trampling on the law, and violating the
</p>
<p>Constitution, to oppress jour memorialist in a case
</p>
<p>where he knew the innocence of jour memorialist, and

<p>his own guilt, in relation to the transactions which gave

<p>rise to the imputations against jour memorialist, and
</p>
<p>from which jour memorialist, bj the said publication,
</p>
<p>w^as endeavoring to vindicate himself. That the said
</p>
<p>Richard Riker further stated from the bench, when he
</p>
<p>thus imposed a fine upon jour memorialist and placed
</p>
<p>him under the heavj bonds above mentioned, that he
</p>
<p>might have been much more severe ; that the law author-
</p>
<p>ized him to send jour memorialist to prison ; that he had
</p>
<p>been tampered with out of court, which he afterward said
</p>
<p>was to induce him to send jour memorialist to prison;
</p>
<p>that thereupon jour memorialist demanded that the said
</p>
<p>Richard Riker should state to the court, and to the
</p>
<p>public, the names of the persons who had thus dared to

<p>tamper with a court of justice, that thej might be dealt

<p>with in a manner befitting their high ofi'ence; but the
</p>
<p>said Richard Riker utterlj refused to give publicitj to
</p>
<p>their names, or exert the power of his court for their
</p>
<p>punishment. That, in stating the case for the Supreme

<p>Court, the said Richard Riker omitted the testimonj of

<p>George W. Strong, Esq., and much other testimonj,
</p>
<p>erroneouslj stated the testimonj of Samuel H. Macj,

<p>and denied or evaded the fact that he charged the jurj

</p>
<p>against him contrary to the evidence, and that the conrt
</p>
<p>has misconceived the law; that the court, in the first
</p>
<p>case, not only excluded testimony which ought to have
</p>
<p>been admitted, but rendered a judgment not warranted
</p>
<p>by laAV, and, in both cases, misdirected the jury. If this
</p>
<p>be so,  if the court has mistaken the law, or the jury
</p>
<p>found contrary to the facts,  Mr. Barker ought to have
</p>
<p>relief. It is always the duty of the court to give to the
</p>
<p>accused in a criminal case every legal advantage. The
</p>
<p>maxim that it is better for ten guilty men to escape than
</p>
<p>that one innocent man should suffer, has its foundation
</p>
<p>in the unchangeable principles of equity as well as of
</p>
<p>humanity. If, therefore, the jury have found verdicts
</p>
<p>not justified by the proof, if the court has rejected any
</p>
<p>evidence which ought to have been admitted, if the court
</p>
<p>misdirected to the prejudice of the defendant, or has
</p>
<p>rendered a judgment not warranted by law, the mistake
</p>
<p>of the court, or the misfinding of the jury, ought to be
</p>
<p>corrected. Every impartial tribunal, and every upright
</p>
<p>judge, can have no vfish but to do justice according to
</p>
<p>law. If an error be committed, especially if against
</p>
<p>the accused, let it be set right.
</p>
<p>"'To enable the defendant to avail himself of any
</p>
<p>error committed by the court or jury, the court will

<p>now proceed to state all the material facts and circum-
</p>
<p>stances which arose in each case, and all the material

<p>principles of law which were ruled by the court. If

</p>
<p>counsel all participation in making up the said state-
</p>
<p>ment, and would not allow either of them to see it until
</p>
<p>he should have pronounced it in court, where he read it
</p>
<p>from the bench, and handed it immediately to a reporter
</p>
<p>for the newspapers for publication. That your memo-
</p>
<p>rialist protested against such a course, and entreated
</p>
<p>the said Richard Riker not to poison the public mind with
</p>
<p>a jDublication fraught with errors and falsehoods, until
</p>
<p>he should have an opportunity of having it corrected,
</p>
<p>agreeable to the promise contained in that very state-
</p>
<p>ment. That all the efforts of your memorialist were
</p>
<p>unavailing, and the said reporter took away from court
</p>
<p>the said case thus read. That, it not appearing in the
</p>
<p>newspapers for some days, your memorialist inquired
</p>
<p>the cause, and learned that the engagements of the
</p>
<p>editor, to whom it had been handed, with the business
</p>
<p>of a theological convention then in session, had pre-
</p>
<p>vented its publication for a few days. That your memo-
</p>
<p>rialist availed himself of this delay by attempting to
</p>
<p>procure a sight of the said statement for the purpose
</p>
<p>of correction before it should be published, his then

<p>critical situation rendering it particularly desirable that
</p>
<p>no further excitement should be created in the public

</p>
<p>availing, and the said editor assured him that he was

<p>instructed not to let any one see the said statement, and

<p>particularly not to let your memorialist see it. That
</p>
<p>after the publication took place your memorialist availed

<p>himself of the apparent fairness of the promise therein

</p>
<p>that of Mr. Macy having, as aforesaid, been erroneously
</p>
<p>stated, and that of Mr. Strong, the most material wit-
</p>
<p>ness in the cause, entirely omitted; whereupon the said
</p>
<p>Riker certified to the accuracy of the statement of your
</p>
<p>memorialist, as to the testimony of the said George W.
</p>
<p>Strong, recapitulating it, and as to that of the said
</p>
<p>Samuel H. Macy, he remarked in the words following :
</p>
<p>" 'Mr. Macy swore, as stated by Mr. Barker, that, by
</p>
<p>this certificate, it will be seen that the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>could not know to what the said Samuel H. Macy had
</p>
<p>testified, without the said afiidavit.' That, notwithstand-
</p>
<p>ing, the said Richard Riker, unknown to your memo-
</p>
<p>rialist, wrote a private letter to the judges of the said
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, objecting to their receiving the affidavits,
</p>
<p>and consequently requesting in substance that, if they
</p>
<p>should pass judgment at all, they should pass it on the
</p>
<p>false statement, which leads to the conclusion that the
</p>
<p>said Richard Riker intentionally denied your memorialist
</p>
<p>a fair trial; that he intentionally made a false state-
</p>
<p>ment of the case; that, being conscious thereof, he
</p>
<p>inserted the deceptive clause, promising to correct his
</p>
<p>errors, if there were any, and that he never meant to
</p>
<p>give your memorialist an opportunity to have the case
</p>
<p>reviewed. The above-mentioned letter was in the fol-
</p>

<p>the questions of law which arose upon the trials. Mr.

<p>Barker has lately submitted his own deposition^ and the

<p>are marked " submitted.'' It is proper that the Supreme

<p>Court should be apprized that it is 7iot intended by the
</p>
<p>court below, or by the recorder, to admit either the ac-

</p>
<p>"And your memorialist further represents that the
</p>
<p>judges of the Supreme Court, aware of their duty not
</p>
<p>to permit any side bar influence, and too much the
</p>
<p>lovers of justice to allow any secret ex lyarte proceed-

</p>
<p>that they considered it equivalent to a request that they
</p>
<p>should not consider the case, as they never gave advice
</p>
<p>at the instance of the parties, and only when requested
</p>
<p>by the court below. That, on hearing the said very ex-

<p>Supreme Court continued to refuse to consider the case,
</p>
<p>not on account of any thing said in the above letters,
</p>
<p>but 'because,' as the chief-justice remarked, 'the court
</p>
<p>below had proceeded to pass sentence before the case
</p>
<p>could be got before them, which was unprecedented in
</p>
<p>judicial proceedings, it being the universal practice (in
</p>
<p>consulting that court) to defer sentence until the opinion
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Court was known.' That Judge Wood-
</p>
<p>worth added, 'And this, too, when the counsel for the
</p>
<p>party only suggested that there was good reason to sup-
</p>
<p>pose an error had been committed by the judge who
</p>
<p>tried the cause ; and in a case where that judge had pro-
</p>
<p>mised to give the party an opportunity to have the case

<p>reviewed by the Supreme Court, the obligation to have

<p>suspended further proceedings was much greater ; yet the

<p>court of sessions proceed to fine Mr. Barker, and the

<p>money has been paid and passed beyond the control of

<p>this court: therefore, if it should interfere and attempt

<p>to reverse the proceedings below, such reversal would

<p>was wanting in fidelity, and calculated to sacrifice the

<p>that his motive for such conduct was individual gain,

</p>
<p>The Governor so far sustained tlie petition as to
</p>
<p>transmit a copy to the recorder, requiring an answer to
</p>
<p>the several charges. Before this answer was received,
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Buren accepted from General Jackson the
</p>
<p>appointment of Secretary of State, vacating the execu-
</p>
<p>tive chair, leaving it to be filled by the Lieutenant-
</p>
<p>Governor, who received from the recorder his vindica-
</p>
<p>tion, and let him off mainly on his own averment that
</p>
<p>he meant no wrong by the proceedings of which Mr.

<p>Barker complained.

<p>Mr. Barker addressed the court thus on the venire: 
</p>
<p>"Believing, as I do, that I cannot get a fair trial
</p>
<p>except I be tried by men capable of understanding the
</p>
<p>merits of the case and the law, and the public prose-
</p>
<p>cutor having promised me a fair trial, I will now test his
</p>
<p>sincerity. It is a conceded fact that the moneyed interests
</p>
<p>of the city have considered my operations for the last
</p>
<p>ten years as adverse to their interests, and have viewed
</p>
<p>me as competing with them for the same boon. Hence

<p>they feel a degree of opposition or hostility to me. Yet
</p>
<p>232 LIFE OF JACOB BAEKER.
</p>
<p>I am willing to be tried bj them. If they are pre-
</p>
<p>judiced, I am not afraid of it. There is too much
</p>
<p>integrity and intelligence among them for me to fear
</p>
<p>any danger of my cause in their hands ; and I now pro-
</p>
<p>pose to be immediately tried at the bar of this com*t,
</p>
<p>and by a struck jury; that the panel jury be taken
</p>
<p>from the presidents of all the banks in this city, sixteen
</p>
<p>in number, the surplusage of four to be stricken off by
</p>
<p>the court after hearing argument. Let the public prose-
</p>
<p>cutor agree to this, and I eno-aa-e not to challeno-e a
</p>
<p>single man, and not to appeal if the verdict should be
</p>
<p>against me. If objections should be made on account
</p>
<p>of the smallness of such a general panel, let the cashiers
</p>
<p>of all the banks be added, which will make thirty-two;
</p>
<p>and if the general panel should still be considered too
</p>
<p>small, let the directors of all the banks be added, which
</p>
<p>will amount to two or three hundred and will make the
</p>
<p>panel unusually large. The power of the court thus to
</p>
<p>form a jury, with the consent of both parties, cannot, I
</p>
<p>think, be disputed; but, if I am mistaken, there are
</p>
<p>many other ways in which they can direct a struck jury ;
</p>
<p>but if I cannot have an immediate trial at the bar of
</p>
<p>this court, I will consent to the records being sent to a
</p>
<p>distant county for the trial of the others, and as soon as
</p>
<p>their trial is over I shall apply to this court to bring
</p>
<p>me back to New York for trial, as I can never consent
</p>
<p>to be tried elsewhere than in New York, unless it should
</p>
<p>become necessary for me to do so to procure justice for
</p>
<p>the other defendants. I have grown up with the city,
</p>
<p>to its inhabitants I am indebted for the little considera-

</p>
<p>despise me ; but I will not flj from them. I will not

<p>attempt to seek protection from their frowns at the hands
</p>
<p>of distant jurors. Be public opinion favorable or un-
</p>
<p>favorable, I am anxious to meet it. Here let me rise or
</p>
<p>fall. I cannot and will not quit my home,  a home of
</p>
<p>which I am proud. I know my fellow-citizens are just
</p>
<p>and generous, and, although they may be deceived for a
</p>
<p>season, truth will ultimately prevail. There are many
</p>
<p>reasons why this cause should not go back to the court of
</p>
<p>oyer and terminer : they are to be found in the manner
</p>
<p>in w^hich that court is constituted, principally of lay-
</p>
<p>men, totally destitute of law-knowledge or pretensions,
</p>
<p>thereto, and it is composed of the same or nearly the
</p>
<p>same members as constitute the court of sessions, Vhere
</p>
<p>the two libel causes were tried; and these causes are a
</p>
<p>branch of the conspiracy cause, all one great conspiracy
</p>
<p>for the destruction of Jacob Barker. The strange posi-
</p>
<p>tions assumed by the judge who tried the aforesaid causes
</p>
<p>are sufficiently within the knowledge of this court to
</p>
<p>remove all necessity for commenting on them here, and,
</p>
<p>I trust, will furnish sufficient reason for not placing my
</p>
<p>cause again into their hands. Nearly one-half of the mem-
</p>
<p>bers have sat on one or the other of the causes, and two
</p>
<p>of the members are by law ex-officio directors of the
</p>
<p>United States Lombard Company, one of the institu-

</p>
<p>bone was a member of that court ; and you have the

<p>recorder's certificate that the district attorney had tes-
</p>
<p>tified that Bathbone furnished the papers on which the
</p>
<p>public prosecutor endeavored to procure my conviction

<p>of a crime, of which crime Bathbone knew me to be

<p>innocent when he gave the papers. Another member

<p>found, by the testimony given on tlie trials, to liave been
</p>
<p>implicated in the transactions. The court of oyer and
</p>
<p>terminer severely reprimanded me, and fined me one
</p>
<p>hundred dollars for having told a witness of a mistake
</p>
<p>he had made in. his testimony, in which mistake I de-
</p>
<p>tected him while on the stand. At the same time they
</p>
<p>imposed this fine, the presiding judge declared that the
</p>
<p>court were perfectly satisfied that I meant no disrespect
</p>
<p>to them, and the court of oyer and terminer have
</p>
<p>fined me twice, two hundred and fifty dollars each
</p>
<p>time, for having published the most candid and sincere
</p>
<p>statement of my cause of complaint which I had the
</p>
<p>power of writing,  a publication totally void of malice,
</p>
<p> and in one instance for the mere publication of a pe-
</p>
<p>tition presented to the court by permission previously
</p>
<p>obtained, and which petition was received and enter-

<p>tained by the said court, and this court know the obsta-

<p>cles that have been thrown in the way of my getting

<p>those decisions reviewed here. Under such circum-
</p>
<p>stances, can it be considered proper to send me back to
</p>
<p>be tried again by those men ? And although none of the
</p>
<p>members thus circumstanced will sit on a new trial, if it
</p>
<p>should be sent back to that court, yet their constant
</p>
<p>intercourse with the other members on political and offi-

<p>cial subjects gives them an imperceptible influence, which
</p>
<p>might prove very prejudicial to me, without the members
</p>
<p>who should try the cause intending to do the least
</p>
<p>wrong or being aware of such influence. I will now
</p>
<p>proceed to suggest the reasons for my asking a separate

<p>as manifested in the separate trial of General Swift,
</p>
<p>which occupied but little more than one day; that the
</p>
<p>grand jurors who found many of the indictments refused
</p>
<p>to couple me with the others; the efforts to get Mr.
</p>
<p>Oakley to join in the crusade against me, which he
</p>
<p>indignantly rejected; the conduct of Rathbone, in con-
</p>
<p>nection with whom I am still liable to be tried, and that
</p>
<p>three of the counsel for some of the other defendants
</p>
<p>assailed me on the last trial. Their attacks were the
</p>
<p>most violent, unfounded, unprovoked, and unmerited
</p>
<p>ever made in a court of justice, and which the interest
</p>
<p>of their clients in no wise called for. So unwarrantable
</p>
<p>and improper was their conduct, that it appeared to
</p>
<p>have excited the sympathy of the public prosecutor, in-
</p>
<p>somuch that he rose to call one of them to order,
</p>
<p>strongly reprobating the course they were pursuing.
</p>
<p>He would not allow them to usurp his franchise. That
</p>
<p>all the persons presented in the same indictment with
</p>
<p>me were directors or officers of one or more of the insti-
</p>
<p>tutions alleged to have been defrauded, except myself,
</p>
<p>and that I occupied no such station in either of the com-
</p>
<p>panies. The improper attempts made on the court of

<p>names and circumstances having been withheld from the

<p>public by that court, the facts disclosed by Mr. Ray-

<p>mond's affidavit produced by the district attorney, from

<p>which it is fairly to be inferred that all the artificial ex-
</p>
<p>citement that has been produced has been levelled at
</p>
<p>me ; that the others are nowise connected with me, nor

<p>I with them;- and, finally, that the court of oyer and ter-

<p>" I have throughout this business avoided doing or
</p>
<p>236 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>saying any thing which could militate against the other
</p>
<p>defendants, and I hope that what I am here called upon
</p>
<p>to say will not have that eiFect; but I am constrained
</p>
<p>to dissent from the opinion entertained by them, that
</p>
<p>there is a widely-extended prejudice.
</p>
<p>" Grreat pains have been taken, by the conspirators
</p>
<p>for my destruction, to give every thing that appearance ;
</p>
<p>but it is all fraud, all trick, all device,  the result of
</p>
<p>measures got up to destroy me. Men were sent to the
</p>
<p>hall to make an excitement, as they were sent to the
</p>
<p>judges of the court of sessions to influence their de-
</p>
<p>cision. The gentleman who has made the deposition
</p>
<p>that he thinks a fair trial cannot be had in New York is
</p>
<p>"doubtless sincere in what he has stated, and has not been,
</p>
<p>to my knowledge, concerned in the conduct of which I
</p>
<p>complain; and there have been so many false lights ex-
</p>
<p>hibited that it would be strange if he did not think there
</p>
<p>was a widely-extended prejudice. The repeated de-
</p>
<p>cisions of the jurors are relied upon as evidence of this
</p>
<p>prejudice. Their decisions amount to nothing. The
</p>
<p>manner of drawing and empanelling the jury, who
</p>
<p>convicted of conspiracy without examining the papers,
</p>
<p>is known to the court ; and this court have before them the
</p>
<p>depositions of three of the jurors who convicted for libel ;
</p>
<p>one of them on his oath says that he does not now and
</p>
<p>never did think Jacob Barker had any malicious inten-
</p>
<p>tion in the publication, and that he had good reason
</p>
<p>for alarm, and that in substance he, the juror, did not
</p>
<p>know the law, and therefore looked up to the court for
</p>
<p>it; and the others also testify to my freedom from
</p>
<p>offence ; and this honorable court will know, when they

</p>
<p>the law when he charged the jury. The jury are not
</p>
<p>LIFE OE JACOB BARKER. 237
</p>
<p>to blame; from the very nature of the case they could
</p>
<p>not know the law, and, like most other jurors, occupied
</p>
<p>in daily pursuits to obtain for themselves and families
</p>
<p>an honest livelihood by hard labor, they have no leisure
</p>
<p>to study the law; and the law-makers, aware of this,
</p>
<p>place a court over them, to whom it is the duty of all
</p>
<p>jurors to look up for law, light, and truth whenever
</p>
<p>they are in doubt or darkness. I do not believe there
</p>
<p>was a particle of prejudice or unfriendly feeling towards
</p>
<p>Jacob Barker in the breast of a single juror who sat on
</p>
<p>either of the libel cases ; and, indeed, one of them swore,
</p>
<p>as your honors will see by the affidavit in your posses-
</p>
<p>sion, that it was a general conversation among the
</p>
<p>jury, after they retired to consider the case, that Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker had not any malicious intention, and that he
</p>
<p>had good cause for alarm ; and that juror further swore
</p>
<p>that he believed every one of the jury was of that opi-
</p>
<p>nion; and, although I have produced depositions from
</p>
<p>but three, I believe they would all have given the same
</p>
<p>testimony if they had been applied to : three were
</p>
<p>deemed sufficient, and the first three applied to gave the
</p>
<p>evidence freely. This testimony admonishes all of the
</p>
<p>necessity of having an unprejudiced, impartial court
</p>
<p>that knows the Law. I am now in the hands of such
</p>
<p>a court, and I trust they will not part with my case
</p>
<p>leaving any uncertainty about my having a fair trial.
</p>
<p>They have a full view of the frightful state of things
</p>
<p>w^hich surround me, and I am sure this court never will
</p>
<p>expose to chance the right of a citizen to having a fair
</p>
<p>trial, and no trial can be considered fair except it be by
</p>
<p>men competent to understand the case. As to prejudice,

</p>
<p>opinions of parties directly or indirectly interested into
</p>
<p>238 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>prejudice, and because the parties to this business are
</p>
<p>vastly numerous they think it is public prejudice. If
</p>
<p>the public, who were not interested, entertained these
</p>
<p>adverse opinions, I should think there was public preju-
</p>
<p>dice. I know they do not, and that a different opinion
</p>
<p>prevails. The numerous companies that either failed
</p>
<p>or lost their funds, the numerous stockholders in those
</p>
<p>companies, and the numerous creditors of those who
</p>
<p>were made insolvent by their losses by the failures of
</p>
<p>the companies, embraced many thousand persons, and
</p>
<p>they may all be considered interested in those prosecu-
</p>
<p>tions: hence the vast odds against the defendants. So
</p>
<p>many thousands on one side against a half-dozen indivi-
</p>
<p>duals on the other is a frightful difference ; but it is not
</p>
<p>prejudice. So great was the prospect of gain in the pur-
</p>
<p>chase- of bonds, that almost every man, woman, and child
</p>
<p>in the city, who had an idle hundred dollars, was tempted
</p>
<p>to go in for a share. They could not resist the prospect
</p>
<p>of getting sixty or one hundred per cent, for their money ;
</p>
<p>and when the hopes of one and all were swept into the
</p>
<p>common vortex, mortified and disappointed in not realiz-
</p>
<p>ing the golden harvest they had expected, they thought
</p>
<p>of nothing but their gold, their lost gold, and, in place
</p>
<p>of ascribing their disappointment to their own impru-
</p>
<p>dence and their own inordinate appetites for gain, for
</p>
<p>usurious interest, they were, without a particle of evi-
</p>
<p>dence, easily led astray, and joined in the cry of fraud
</p>
<p>against the innocent, got up by those who wish to hide
</p>
<p>their own guilt by diverting public attention therefrom.
</p>
<p>And when the trick is discovered, we are told it is pre-
</p>
<p>judice, public prejudice, that has convicted the innocent.
</p>
<p>It is no such thing: it was the frauds, the falsehoods,

<p>*'I will not, at this late hour, trespass further on the
</p>
<p>time of the court ; but I must be allowed to press on
</p>
<p>them the importance of my case. It is for reputation I
</p>
<p>am contending; it is not to avoid the penalties of the
</p>
<p>law. I care not for them, further than my character is
</p>
<p>concerned. I was in hopes, before this argument had come

<p>on, that my counsel would have been heard in the libel

<p>cases. They would have told the court that to get back

<p>the $500 taken from me in those causes was the least of
</p>

<p>to remove from the record the stain. Yf hen that argu-

<p>facts as will make every heart shudder at the enormities
</p>
<p>committed on Jacob Barker; but, as the court are in
</p>
<p>possession of documents sufficient to establish how just
</p>
<p>is his cause of complaint, I will only repeat the appall-
</p>
<p>ing fact that the jury whose verdict was to consign him
</p>
<p>and his unoffending family to misery did not examine
</p>
<p>the papers proved in the case, and on which he relied for
</p>
<p>his entire exculpation. I can never believe that a
</p>
<p>verdict given under such circumstances will be con-
</p>
<p>sidered of the least validity or evidence of guilt : yet it
</p>
<p>furnishes an additional reason why the case should be
</p>
<p>tried by men who understand financial matters, and this
</p>
<p>can only be attained by granting a struck jury, such a
</p>
<p>jury as will be capable of understanding the true merits
</p>
<p>of the case, in whom the public have implicit confidence,
</p>
<p>and whose verdict, if favorable, will silence the tongue
</p>
<p>of the slanderer. I beseech the court, as they value the
</p>
<p>cause of truth and justice, not to send me for trial
</p>
<p>where the jury, from the very nature of the case and of
</p>
<p>their occupation, will have to look to the court for the

</p>
<p>240 LIFE OP JACOB BAEKER.
</p>
<p>is, that the court and jury who are to try me be capable
</p>
<p>of deciding whether I am guilty or innocent. I know

<p>myself to be innocent; and all T ask is an opportunity
</p>
<p>to demonstrate such innocence."
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court did not sustain this application.

<p>THIRD TRIAL.
</p>
<p>On this trial, Mr. Barker was defended by Chief-
</p>
<p>Justice Spencer, Thomas Addis Emmett, and George
</p>
<p>Grriffin, Esqs. From the speeches of the tAvo former the
</p>
<p>following extracts are taken :

</p>
<p>" Gentlemen of the jury, it may perhaps surprise
</p>
<p>you that I should appear in this cause,  that I should
</p>
<p>now be addressing you in behalf of this defendant.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is not from pecuniary motives : no reward
</p>
<p>in the power of Mr. Barker to bestow could have in-
</p>
<p>duced me to lend my aid to his cause. I became ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with his case from having been engaged in
</p>
<p>the argument on the case before alluded to, and I came
</p>
<p>here under a perfect conviction, from that knowledge, of
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker's innocence. I have known Mr. Barker for the
</p>
<p>last twenty years. I know that there have been reports
</p>
<p>and prejudices concerning him; the voice of calumny
</p>
<p>has been raised against his character. Yet, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>believe it not, it strikes at all, and I here proclaim, and

</p>
<p>were I trumpet-tongued I would cry it aloud to the
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 241
</p>
<p>world, that I believe him an honest, an honorable, and a
</p>
<p>high-minded man. Gentlemen, we have much to com-
</p>
<p>plain of in this case.
</p>
<p>''Mr. Barker is indicted of a conspiracy, with intent
</p>
<p>to defraud the Morris Canal and other companies, eight
</p>
<p>in the whole. To prove this conspiracy a number of
</p>
<p>transactions have been offered in evidence before you.
</p>
<p>The district attorney does not rely upon the overt act ;
</p>
<p>but he has spread out these transactions, and now means
</p>
<p>to urge them as proofs of the conspiracy. We come here
</p>
<p>hoodwinked; we cannot tell what use the learned gen-
</p>
<p>tleman intends to make of these transactions. We are
</p>
<p>groping in the dark. Transactions innocent in them-
</p>
<p>selves are to be coupled together for our destruction.
</p>
<p>It is of this we complain, this blind groping. The law
</p>
<p>on this subject is an anomaly. There is no other offence
</p>
<p>in the whole catalogue of crimes where a defendant
</p>
<p>cannot fully and clearly understand the defence he is to
</p>
<p>make. In this we are totally in the dark. The mind
</p>
<p>of man can scarcely conceive to what extent it may be
</p>
<p>carried. It was formerly customary in the country
</p>
<p>from which we derive our laws to indict men for high
</p>
<p>treason without setting forth the overt acts ; and many
</p>
<p>illustrious men have been brought to the block without
</p>
<p>knowing until the hour of trial the offence for which
</p>
<p>they were to suffer. This law, in the wisdom of Eng-
</p>
<p>lish jurisprudence, was altered and amended so as to
</p>
<p>require the definite crime to be set forth. The law of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy still exists as it did before. Yet so sensible were
</p>
<p>our legislators of the necessity of a change in this re-
</p>
<p>spect, that the Senate of our State, at their last session,
</p>
<p>passed a bill to that effect, requiring the overt act to be
</p>
<p>Bet forth in trials for conspiracy; and this bill is still

<p>pending before the other house. I mention this, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, that you may perceive the peculiar hardship of
</p>
<p>our case. I suspect, gentlemen, you will find the task
</p>
<p>imposed on you one of great difficulty; and if the ques-
</p>
<p>tion were now put to you to say what particular acts have
</p>
<p>been proved against Mr. Barker, you would find it impos-
</p>
<p>sible to point them out. There has been an accumulation
</p>
<p>of evidence, a throwing in of testimony, for what pur-
</p>
<p>pose I do not know, though the district attorney says
</p>
<p>we shall know by-and-by. So that you may perceive
</p>
<p>we are still groping in the dark, even as to the use to be
</p>
<p>made of this testimony.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, you may suppose me bold, but, believing
</p>
<p>it as I do, I dare utter it, that when you come to an ex-
</p>
<p>amination of the testimony in this cause, you will not
</p>
<p>only not find a single particle of evidence of guilt, but,
</p>
<p>so far from it, you will not find cause for suspicion
</p>
<p>against my client. The gentlemen may put it down : I
</p>
<p>have said it, and I will vindicate it. I have carefully
</p>
<p>listened to the testimony that has been given, and be-
</p>
<p>stowed upon the case all the thought of which I am
</p>
<p>capable; and if all my capacity to understand and to
</p>
<p>discriminate between right and wrong has not forsaken
</p>
<p>me, I am not mistaken when I say that the testimony
</p>
<p>which has been given makes my client's conduct praise-
</p>
<p>worthy throughout. This I say conscientiously, and I

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.
</p>
<p>THE SPEECH OF THOMAS ADDIS EMMETT, ESQ.
</p>
<p>* Gentlemen of the jury, I most sincerely concur in
</p>
<p>the opinion expressed by my learned friend, who has so
</p>
<p>emphatically told you that our client stood before you,
</p>
<p>after near three weeks' investigation, untouched by the
</p>
<p>testimony. Nothing can be more manifest than his
</p>
<p>freedom from offence. It is in proof that his every act
</p>
<p>throughout this whole business has been not only blame-
</p>
<p>less, but praiseworthy. This I declare to be my sincere
</p>
<p>opinion, and I felt peculiar pleasure in hearing Judge
</p>
<p>Spencer put forth corresponding sentiments in a manner
</p>
<p>that convinced all of his sincerity. His course of read-
</p>
<p>ing and thinking, his judicial duties, his habit of view-
</p>
<p>ing both sides of all subjects brought before him, have
</p>
<p>particularly qualified him to form a correct opinion of
</p>
<p>this very complicated case: therefore it is to me a
</p>
<p>source of much gratification to know that he thinks, with
</p>
<p>me, that there is not even a cause of suspicion against
</p>
<p>my client; and yet we find a most numerous array of
</p>
<p>counsel brought here to endeavor to procure his convic-
</p>
<p>tion. It naturally occurs, by whom are they employed?
</p>
<p>They have too much reputation, and their time is too
</p>
<p>valuable, for them to come here and waste a month in
</p>
<p>pursuit of fame only. They must be paid by somebody;
</p>
<p>and I demand to know who that somebody is. I ask,

</p>
<p>Who pays them ? To this question I demand an answer.
</p>
<p>244 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>My client is entitled to the information. Every accused
</p>
<p>man is entitled to know Avho his prosecutor is. He has
</p>
<p>a right to show to the jury, as matter of defence, the
</p>
<p>motives, the malice, the character and conduct of those
</p>
<p>who instigate or carry on proceedings against him.
</p>
<p>He has a right to proceed against them for a malicious
</p>
<p>prosecution, and on that account to know who they are.
</p>
<p>It is not a sufficient answer to shelter them under the
</p>
<p>assertion that the people prosecute. The king prose-
</p>
<p>cutes in England; but that does not deprive the subject
</p>
<p>of the right to know who maintains the prosecution.
</p>
<p>The district attorney says he employs them ; but the
</p>
<p>question still recurs. Who pays them ? The Governor has
</p>
<p>not ordered their employment. The corporation have not
</p>
<p>done it. No order for that purpose appears on their
</p>
<p>minutes, and they have no right to interfere or divert the
</p>
<p>city funds for that purpose. The legislature have not
</p>
<p>done it. I ask, then, Who has, and studiously keeps him-
</p>
<p>self concealed ? I say again to the public prosecutor,
</p>
<p>Who pays and hides himself? Mr. Barker has always
</p>
<p>charged this prosecution to be a wicked conspiracy
</p>
<p>s to destroy him ; and if the public prosecutor will tell
</p>
<p>I who pays and keeps concealed, it will give a clue to this
</p>
<p>foul conspiracy. Let us know who are secretly devoting
</p>
<p>their thousands to destroy an innocent man, and we shall
</p>
<p>have no difficulty in developing the whole plot.
</p>
<p>"The peculiar qualities of my client's mind and dis-
</p>
<p>position have rendered it utterly impossible for his
</p>
<p>counsel to keep him within those professional rules
</p>
<p>which would have governed them had the case been left
</p>
<p>entirely to them ; but you have witnessed that he would
</p>
<p>not be regulated by our advice : he has provoked the. ire

</p>
<p>of our opponents, and they have promised to retaliate
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 245
</p>
<p>to the extent of their ability. 'Let them do it,' says
</p>
<p>my client. Although we do not approve of his course,
</p>
<p>we are persuaded that you see sufficient provocation
</p>
<p>for it. His outraged feelings at the enormity of these
</p>
<p>proceedings, at the tricks and devices that have been
</p>
<p>resorted to to procure his conviction, the constant at-
</p>
<p>tempts to misrepresent all his conduct, and to infer
</p>
<p>fraud from the most praiseworthy and disinterested of
</p>
<p>his acts, are enough to fill a mind less acute, less sensi-
</p>
<p>tive than his, with indignation. Boiling over as he is
</p>
<p>under a sense of the wrongs done him, he seems to have
</p>
<p>thrown off prudential restraint, and to have had more
</p>
<p>pleasure in rebuking the gentlemen who are pursuing
</p>
<p>this course towards him than in any other branch of his
</p>
<p>defence. I admire the spirit that has prompted this
</p>
<p>bold and manly course, while I regret its want of pru-
</p>
<p>' , dence. Yet there is, nevertheless, an advantage in it.
</p>
<p>] Such a course is utterly inconsistent with guilt. None
</p>
<p>but honorable, honest, and high-minded feelings could
</p>
<p>have enabled him to pursue it and carry it through.
</p>
<p>Consider this well; give to it the influence to which it
</p>
<p>is entitled, and you will say that the whole nature of
</p>
<p>man has been changed in the formation of Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>or that he is an innocent man. It has been thought to
</p>
<p>procure his conviction chiefly on the testimony of David
</p>
<p>Leavitt. He has stated that Mr. Barker told him, about
</p>
<p>four days after the failure of the Hudson Insurance
</p>
<p>Company, (which he fixed to be on the 8th of July,) and
</p>
<p>before the failure of the Life and Fire Insurance Com-
</p>
<p>pany, that he had the control of the notes deposited in
</p>
<p>the Fulton Bank for collection by that company; and
</p>
<p>that Mr. Barker told him, on Saturday, the 15th of
</p>
<p>July, three days before the failure, that it was question-

</p>
<p>able whether the Life and Fire could sustain itself or
</p>
<p>not. Had all this been so, there was no harm in it.
</p>
<p>Barker had the right to have the control over the
</p>
<p>property of any individual or corporate company that
</p>
<p>thought proper to give it to him and owed him largely;
</p>
<p>and in this case, from the advances proved by the prose-
</p>
<p>cution to have been made by him, there would have been
</p>
<p>a peculiar fitness in their having given him the control
</p>
<p>of those notes ; and, as to his telling Leavitt that it was
</p>
<p>doubtful if the Life and Fire would be enabled to sus-
</p>
<p>tain itself, what harm was there in that? The bank
</p>
<p>was itself, at that very time, hard pressed; Barker
</p>
<p>deeply interested and actively engaged in sustaining it;
</p>
<p>the Hudson Company's failure that day, overdrawn
</p>
<p>more than one hundred thousand dollars, without secu-
</p>
<p>rity, to the Fulton Bank ; a great excitement about the
</p>
<p>Tradesmen's Bank ; all confidence lost in the bond com-
</p>
<p>panies; the Life and Fire having a great issue; its
</p>
<p>dealers failing daily: was there not cause enough to
</p>
<p>induce a prudent man to give a word of caution to the
</p>
<p>presiding officer of a bank in which he himself was
</p>
<p>deeply interested and in which that company kept their
</p>
<p>account ?
</p>
<p>" With this view of the subject, I should not have
</p>
<p>attempted to contradict the witness, however incorrect
</p>
<p>the testimony he gave ; but my client, knowing it to be
</p>
<p>untrue, and persuaded that it was contrived to injure
</p>
<p>him, decided instantly to detect the misstatements ; and
</p>
<p>he succeeded to his heart's content.
</p>
<p>" The point of the evidence was to make out that Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker had the control of the efi"ects of the Life and
</p>
<p>Fire before the failure of the company, when the power

<p>of attorney was given ; to make out Barker's knowledge

</p>
<p>that the company was bad, and also to breed a further
</p>
<p>quarrel between Barker and the Life and Eire gentle-
</p>
<p>men, by making them believe that Barker had not acted
</p>
<p>in good faith with them. Had the district attorney
</p>
<p>given credit to this improbable tale of his own witness,
</p>
<p>would he not have asked the clerks of the Life and Fire
</p>
<p>if Mr. Barker had any such control ? if he ever
</p>
<p>attempted to exercise any? if he ever spoke of those
</p>
<p>notes, ever looked at their bank-book, or asked for
</p>
<p>authority to draw them ? Had he asked these questions
</p>
<p>he would have been told, 'No, never !' The public prose-
</p>
<p>cutor knew better than to ask any such question. And
</p>
<p>would Mr. Leavitt, who boasts of his vigilance at this
</p>
<p>time in watching over the concerns of the bank,  would
</p>
<p>he, I ask, have permitted the daily payment, to a great
</p>
<p>amount, without funds, of the checks of a company in full
</p>
<p>business, who had given to any individual not connected
</p>
<p>with such company the control over their bills receiv-
</p>
<p>able ? The story is too ridiculous, too absurd, to gain
</p>
<p>credit for a moment. But my client does not depend
</p>
<p>upon inferences to silence these calumnies ; and I will
</p>
<p>give you a short statement of the testimony in relation
</p>
<p>to Mr. Leavitt.
</p>
<p>''Mr. David B. Ogden told you that Mr. Leavitt
</p>
<p>intentionally deceived Mr. Eckford, and those concerned
</p>
<p>in the settlement for the Morris stock, on the day of
</p>
<p>settlement, in this, that he said the certificates were at
</p>
<p>the bank, when he knew them to be in the hands of the
</p>
<p>grand jury; and if he has sacrificed the truth on one
</p>
<p>occasion, he must expect his testimony to be more scru-
</p>
<p>pulously canvassed on another.

<p>Barker after the failure of the Hudson Company, and
</p>
<p>248 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>before the failure of the Life and Fire. That in one of
</p>
<p>those conversations Barker told him that he had the
</p>
<p>control over the notes in the Fulton Bank deposited by
</p>
<p>the Life and Fire, and that, as near as he could recol-
</p>
<p>lect, this conversation took place about four days after
</p>
<p>the failure of the Hudson Company, and a week before
</p>
<p>the failure of the Life and Fire. That the Hudson
</p>
<p>failed the 8th of July. That, in speaking of the over-
</p>
<p>drawing of the Life and Fire, Barker mentioned the
</p>
<p>note of Allaire as one on which calculation could be
</p>
<p>made toward the payment of such overdrawings. That
</p>
<p>subsequently the Life and Fire withdrew the note of
</p>
<p>Allaire ; that such withdrawal took place after the notice
</p>
<p>from Barker that he had the control of that note ; when
</p>
<p>Barker heard of it, he complained, alleging that the
</p>
<p>bank had no right to give it to any other person than
</p>
<p>himself.
</p>
<p>"Kingsland testified that the note was withdrawn by
</p>
<p>himself, pursuant to the orders of the officers of the com-
</p>
<p>pany, after the failure of the Life and Fire, and before
</p>
<p>the account was made good. Leavitt stepped up and dis-
</p>
<p>puted Kingsland's testimony, and testified that if it was
</p>
<p>withdrawn before the account was made good, that it
</p>
<p>was withdrawn before the failure of the company, and
</p>
<p>before the overdrawings; that he had never given up
</p>
<p>security while the account remained over. Kingsland
</p>
<p>was recalled, and examined the books, and testified that
</p>
<p>the note became payable on the 24th of July; that it
</p>
<p>was withdrawn after the failure and before it was pro-
</p>
<p>tested; he could not say on what day, but it was on or'
</p>
<p>about the 24th of July, he believed, on the very day it

<p>became due; it was not protested; it would have been,

</p>
<p>fied that it would have been protested if it re-
</p>
<p>mained in the bank until due ; if paid, it would have
</p>
<p>been entered to the credit of the Life and Fire ; neither
</p>
<p>had happened ; but from the erasure on the note-book
</p>
<p>it had been withdrawn either on the day it fell due or
</p>
<p>before.
</p>
<p>" Kingsland, being further examined, testified that
</p>
<p>when he went to the bank to withdraw the note the
</p>
<p>clerk refused to give it to him, alleging that the Life
</p>
<p>and Fire account was withdrawn, and that the note
</p>
<p>could not be given up until the account was made good.
</p>
<p>Leavitt was present; the clerk spoke to him, and after
</p>
<p>some time spent in conference and examination it vfas
</p>
<p>determined that, as there were other satisfactory notes
</p>
<p>in the bank sufficient to secure the amount overdrawn,
</p>
<p>Allaire's note might be given up, whereupon the clerk
</p>
<p>gave to Kingsland the note.
</p>
<p>" Leavitt swore that Clinch came up to the board of
</p>
<p>directors on Monday, the ITth of July, and said Barker
</p>
<p>had forbid the payment of Life and Fire checks ; that
</p>
<p>he came down and stated to Barker that they must pay
</p>
<p>to the extent of funds in hand, to which Barker made no
</p>
<p>reply. Clinch stated that Barker did not attempt to
</p>
<p>forbid the payment of any check, or did he intimate that
</p>
<p>Life and Fire checks ought not to be paid to the extent
</p>
<p>of funds in hand; that Barker called on Monday, the
</p>
<p>17th of July, at. the close of the business of the day,

</p>
<p>the directors' room; that he did not tell Leavitt that
</p>
<p>250 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>Barker had forbid the payment of Life and Fire checks,
</p>
<p>nor did he intimate to Leavitt that Barker had said
</p>
<p>they ought not to be paid to the amount of funds in
</p>
<p>hand, but that he told Leavitt that Barker had inti-
</p>
<p>mated that it would be prudent not to pay them beyond
</p>
<p>funds in hand. Leavitt testified that Barker told him
</p>
<p>on Saturday, the 15th of July, that he considered it
</p>
<p>uncertain whether or not the Life and Fire would be
</p>
<p>enabled to sustain itself; that he did not, on receipt of
</p>
<p>this information, give any caution to the clerks of the
</p>
<p>bank not to pay Life and Fire checks beyond funds in
</p>
<p>hand, because the clerks had previously received per-
</p>
<p>emptory general orders not to pay beyond funds in
</p>
<p>hands. Clinch testified that they were in the daily
</p>
<p>habit of paying Life and Fire checks for large amounts
</p>
<p>in the course of the day without money in hand, relying
</p>
<p>on its being made good before three o'clock; that this
</p>
<p>practice continued down to the day of the failure; that
</p>
<p>Leavitt knew all about it; that no order had, to his
</p>
<p>knowledge, been given to refuse or to examine Life and
</p>
<p>Fire checks; that large amounts would have been paid
</p>
<p>on the day of failure, had they been presented, whether
</p>
<p>there had been money in the bank to the credit of the
</p>
<p>Life and Fire or not.
</p>
<p>" Kingsland testified that the Fulton Bank were in
</p>
<p>the daily habit of paying checks for large amounts as
</p>
<p>they were presented, without money in hand, and that
</p>
<p>he made the account good daily by depositing about a
</p>
<p>quarter before three o'clock. The amount overdrawn was
</p>
<p>about $1400 or $1500, and happened the day the com-
</p>
<p>pany failed, which was made good, partly on the 21st
</p>
<p>of July and the residue on the 11th of August, by the

<p>collection of notes; that the residue of the notes had
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 251
</p>
<p>been delivered to the receivers ; and that none of them
</p>
<p>had been delivered to Barker.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Franklin testified that he resigned his seat as a
</p>
<p>director of the Fulton Bank about the 13th of July, and
</p>
<p>that the Hudson Company did not fail until a day or
</p>
<p>two after such resignation. Leavitt then came forward
</p>
<p>again to correct his testimony, and said he had been
</p>
<p>mistaken as to the time the Hudson Company failed ;
</p>
<p>that they had paid all their bonds on the 14th of July.
</p>
<p>Leavitt came forward again to explain, stating that he
</p>
<p>had several conversations with Barker about the state
</p>
<p>of the Life and Fire ; that he had not refreshed his
</p>
<p>mind by examining the notes of the former trial, but
</p>
<p>that he thought the conversation about his having the
</p>
<p>control of the notes was before the failure of the Life
</p>
<p>and Fire; he also restated that all his conversations
</p>
<p>with Barker in relation to the Life and Fire notes were
</p>
<p>subsequent to the failure of the Hudson Company. Mr.
</p>
<p>Butler and Mr. Sparhawk stated that Mr. Leavitt had
</p>
<p>testified on the former trial of this cause, that when
</p>
<p>Barker told him that he had the control of the Life and
</p>
<p>Fire notes deposited in the Fulton Bank, they were con-
</p>
<p>versing about the overdrawings of the Life and Fire,
</p>
<p>which overdrawings took place on the day of the failure
</p>
<p>of the Life and Fire ; that Leavitt stated it was after the
</p>
<p>failure that this conversation took place, but how long
</p>
<p>after Mr. Butler said he did not recollect; that he had
</p>
<p>put down on his notes at the time, that Leavitt stated
</p>
<p>that such conversation was after the failure of the Life
</p>
<p>and Fire, without mentioning how long after. Mr. Spar-
</p>
<p>hawk stated that Leavitt had, on a former trial, stated
</p>
<p>that the first conversation about the overdrawing was

<p>on Monday, after the failure of the Life and Fire. The
</p>
<p>252 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER..
</p>
<p>Life and Fire failed on Tuesday, tlie IStli of July. The
</p>
<p>Monday after was the 24th, the very day when Mr. Al-
</p>
<p>laire's note became payable, and of course the very day
</p>
<p>of all others when the parties would be most likely to
</p>
<p>talk of it, and that after this it was that Barker told
</p>
<p>him that he had control of the notes of the Life and
</p>
<p>Fire deposited in the Fulton Bank. Leavitt further
</p>
<p>testified on the present trial, but at an early stage of
</p>
<p>his examination, that he considered Barker had been
</p>
<p>instrumental in getting him removed from the presidency
</p>
<p>of the Fulton Bank; superadding, 'but I have no preju-
</p>
<p>dice against him.' And when pressed to say whether or
</p>
<p>not Barker had been employed by the directors of the
</p>
<p>Fulton Bank, to assist them in sustaining the bank at
</p>
<p>the time it was run, (the 17th of July,) he insisted that
</p>
<p>B.arker was a volunteer, and seemed unwillingly to
</p>
<p>admit that Barker's assistance was either acceptable or
</p>
<p>beneficial ; the guarantee of Leavitt and others expressly
</p>
<p>recognized Barker as assisting by their request. Mr.
</p>
<p>Lawrence and Mr. Carter testified to that fact; and
</p>
<p>Mr. Hicks testified that he heard Leavitt, during the
</p>
<p>run on the Fulton Bank, request Barker to send the
</p>
<p>specie immediately, and to get a carriage for that
</p>
<p>purpose.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Leavitt said, in answer to a question put by
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker, ' Do you not believe that if Messrs. Spencer
</p>
<p>and Brown, and those directors of the Fulton Bank
</p>
<p>under their influence, had not resigned, and Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>had not rendered aid, that the bank would have been
</p>
<p>compelled to stop payment?' 'I think not.' 'Do you
</p>
<p>mean to say that the bank could have met all its en-
</p>
<p>gagements punctually, after the Hudson Company had

</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 253
</p>
<p>had continued tlieir controlling influence over the direc-
</p>
<p>tion of the Fulton Bank?' 'I think so.' 'Do you
</p>
<p>recollect the great excitement in the city, and particu-
</p>
<p>larly against those men ; the total prostration of credit ;
</p>
<p>that the specie in the bank was reduced to J3000 ; and,
</p>
<p>in the language of Mr. Clinch, that the bank was sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by a mob to get their bills redeemed?' 'Not-
</p>
<p>withstanding all this, I think the bank would have met its
</p>
<p>engagements, because an arrangement had been made
</p>
<p>by which the necessary aid w^as to have been procured
</p>
<p>from the Tradesmen's Bank.' 'That is news to m^.
</p>
<p>Let us have the particulars.' Mr. Leavitt did not make
</p>
<p>any explanation. Here let it be remembered, as an
</p>
<p>established fact, on the testimony of Falls and Nevins,
</p>
<p>that the Tradesmen's Bank w^as placed under an injunc-
</p>
<p>tion on the 15th of July, and that the run on the Fulton
</p>
<p>was on the 17th of July, and that, therefore, it could
</p>
<p>not have got a dollar from the Tradesmen's Bank.
</p>
<p>" The Rathbone paper is dated 12th of July. Messrs.
</p>
<p>Burrell and Humphreys were elected on that day, as
</p>
<p>appears by the minutes of the bank in proof. Mr.
</p>
<p>Catlin testified that they were elected very soon after
</p>
<p>the conference between himself, Mr. Leavitt, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, about new directors; that he believed the very
</p>
<p>next morning ; could not say the precise time, but that
</p>
<p>he perfectly recollected they were elected very soon
</p>
<p>after such conference. Mr. Carter testified that Messrs.
</p>
<p>Hazard, Corse, Lawrence, Thurston, and Comstock
</p>
<p>were elected expressly on the ground of their being
</p>
<p>Barker's friends, and that those five g.entlemen were
</p>
<p>very fit men for the situation, and that the aff"airs of the
</p>
<p>bank were safe in their hands. The minutes of the

<p>14tli of July, and by Leavitt and his friends, as neither
</p>
<p>Brown, Spencer, Rathbone, Franklin, nor their friends,
</p>
<p>were at the board when the election of either of them
</p>
<p>took place; although only one at a time had resigned,
</p>
<p>and not another until the previous vacancy had been
</p>
<p>filled. Mr. Carter stated, also, that the bank had advanced
</p>
<p>$9000, and that he understood that Barker, or Eckford
</p>
<p>and Barker, had advanced an equal sum for the support
</p>
<p>of the Hudson Company. This plainly proves that
</p>
<p>these things were all done in pursuance of some arrange-
</p>
<p>r&ent with Spencer and Brown, growing out of the ne-
</p>
<p>gotiation to which this paper. No. 3 and 4, was a part;
</p>
<p>but it does not prove the precise terms of the agree-
</p>
<p>ment, when the negotiation reached the form of an agree-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>^' Here we have the testimony of David B. Ogden,
</p>
<p>Esq., as to the inaccuracy of Mr. Leavitt's declarations
</p>
<p>on settling for the Morris stock. We confront Mr.
</p>
<p>Leavitt's declaration on this occasion, that Barker told
</p>
<p>him he had the control of the Life and Eire notes a
</p>
<p>week before their failure, with his oath on the former
</p>
<p>trial, where he said it was after the failure of the Life
</p>
<p>and Fire that Mr. Barker told him this ; for which we
</p>
<p>have the testimony of Mr. Sparhawk and Mr. Butler,
</p>
<p>sustained by their separate notes taken at the time.
</p>
<p>And since we are obliged to credit the oath he now
</p>
<p>makes, or the oath he then made, we prefer trusting his
</p>
<p>recollections for four rather than for twelve months;
</p>
<p>as he would be much more likely to relate accurately
</p>
<p>while the circumstances were fresh in his recollection
</p>
<p>than after a lapse of a year, especially as in the inte-
</p>
<p>rim he said he had been removed from the presidency

</p>
<p>" He stands contradicted by several witnesses, as to
</p>
<p>the period of the failure of the Hudson Insurance Com-
</p>
<p>pany. Kingsland contradicts him positively, as to the
</p>
<p>withdrawal of Allaire's note. Clinch contradicts him
</p>
<p>positively, as to Mr. Barker's forbidding him to pay Life
</p>
<p>and Fire checks. And will any one believe, if Barker
</p>
<p>had given him the alleged information on Saturday, that
</p>
<p>he would not, under the circumstances, have given an
</p>
<p>intimation to the clerks of the bank? Clinch swears
</p>
<p>that if the checks of the Life and Fire Company had
</p>
<p>been presented on the day of the failure, to the amount
</p>
<p>of 20 or 30,000 dollars, they would have been paid with-
</p>
<p>out funds and without examination.
</p>
<p>"Leavitt swore that he had no pique against Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, and this, too, without being asked. He may
</p>
<p>not be conscious of it; but can you believe that asser-
</p>
<p>tion, gentlemen of the jury, after the testimony you
</p>
<p>have heard? Why, then, did he, when asked if Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker had not been invited to assist the bank in its
</p>
<p>troubles, elude the admission, and declare Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>to have been a volunteer?
</p>
<p>''On this subject how differently did Mr. Lawrence,
</p>
<p>Mr. Catlin, Mr.-Selden, and Mr. Carter testify! And
</p>
<p>Mr. Hicks stated that he heard Leavitt apply to Barker
</p>
<p>to assist the bank, to send the specie immediately, and
</p>
<p>to get a carriage for the purpose.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Clinch testified that Barker brought the specie
</p>
<p>in the time of their greatest need. And, gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, you heard Leavitt swear that the Rathbone
</p>
<p>paper, dated the 12tli of July, did not relate to the
</p>
<p>negotiation for change of directors, which took place
</p>
<p>in the Fulton Bank. The express words of that paper

</p>
<p>book and Mr. Carter proved to you tliere never were
</p>
<p>two vacancies on any other day. They were filled by
</p>
<p>Messrs. Burrell and Humphreys that very day.
</p>
<p>"And Mr. Catlin further tells you that Mr. Leavitt
</p>
<p>and Mr. Barker called at his house, to consult him and
</p>
<p>to procure his assistance in selecting two good directors
</p>
<p>for the bank, the preceding evening. Now, after having
</p>
<p>heard all this testimony, I should like to see the man
</p>
<p> if there be one  hardy enough to ask a jury to place
</p>
<p>any reliance on the testimony of the witness in question.
</p>
<p>Be the misstatements he has fallen into the result of a
</p>
<p>defective memory or not, they are so great and glaring
</p>
<p>that a discreet jury would never permit themselves to
</p>
<p>act on its evidence."
</p>
<p>The excitement against the accused was terrific, fuel
</p>
<p>being added to the fire by discourses from the pulpit.
</p>
<p>Four of the clergy disgraced their clerical robes by
</p>
<p>preaching renown to Maxwell for the zeal he manifested
</p>
<p>in the prosecution.
</p>
<p>The Common Council, one-half of whose members
</p>
<p>were implicated in the stock speculations which were
</p>
<p>denounced as fraudulent, gave Maxwell from the public
</p>
<p>chest a thousand dollars extra fee or salary for the
</p>
<p>additional services rendered in the matter.
</p>
<p>A service of plate was also presented to him by a few
</p>
<p>of the moneyed aristocracy, as evidence of their appro-
</p>
<p>bation of his nefarious conduct.
</p>
<p>Three of the counsel employed by the guilty parties,
</p>
<p>in their speeches on the trial, assailed Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>violently. Application was made to a fourth  Thomas
</p>
<p>J. Oakley, Esq.  to join in the attack, which was in-
</p>
<p>dignantly rejected by that honorable gentleman.

<p>To grapple with such a cause, and triumphantly fight

</p>
<p>He seems to have been made for the occasion : his pre-

<p>sence of mind and confidence in the final issue never

<p>for a moment forsook him.

<p>CHAPTER XIX.
</p>
<p>APPLICATION FOR A NEW TRIAL.
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>This trial resulting unfavorably, Mr. Barker having
</p>
<p>taken many exceptions to the proceedings on the trial,
</p>
<p>on which he intended to apply to the Supreme Court to
</p>
<p>set aside the verdict, it became important that the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court should be furnished with a full state-
</p>
<p>ment of the case. This was also necessary to enable
</p>
<p>the court to regulate the degree of punishment, in case
</p>
<p>they should confirm the verdict. Mr. Barker therefore
</p>
<p>prepared a statement of the whole case, and presented
</p>
<p>it to the district attorney, who refused to look at it or
</p>
<p>make any counter-statement; whereupon Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>accompanied by his counsel, George Griffin, Esq.,
</p>
<p>applied to Judge Edwards, and requested him to furnish
</p>
<p>a copy of his notes in the case, with a copy of his
</p>
<p>charge to the jury, which the judge utterly refused to
</p>
<p>furnish,, adding that his notes were not full, nor could
</p>
<p>he rely upon their accuracy; and that he would not
</p>
<p>make any report of the trial to the Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>unless that court should require him to do so ; but that,
</p>
<p>if Mr. Barker should make a case, serve it on the dis-
</p>
<p>trict attorney, and furnish a list of exceptions, and the

</p>
<p>parties afterward appear before liim with, such case and
</p>
<p>exceptions, he would settle the same. Mr. Griffin then
</p>
<p>informed the judge that Mr. Maxwell refused either to
</p>
<p>look at that prepared by the defendant or to prepare
</p>
<p>one himself, notwithstanding which, the judge adhered
</p>
<p>to his refusal with great pertinacity. Mr. Barker then
</p>
<p>gave the district attorney notice to appear before the
</p>
<p>Hon. John Savage, chief-justice, at his chambers in
</p>
<p>Albany, to show cause why a case should not be made
</p>
<p>for the use of the Supreme Court. On reaching
</p>
<p>Albany, Mr. Barker found Judge Edwards and Mr.
</p>
<p>Maxwell there ; he informed Chief- Justice Spencer, his
</p>
<p>counsel, of Judge Edwards's refusal. "Very strange,
</p>
<p>this," replied the judge: "let us go and see him: he will
</p>
<p>not refuse me." Mr. Barker responded that such an
</p>
<p>application would be useless, that he would certainly
</p>
<p>adhere to his refusal. "Impossible," said the chief-
</p>
<p>justice: "let us go and see." They did so, and repeated
</p>
<p>the application for a report of the case from the judge,

<p>or fojL' a copy of his notes and charge to the jury,
</p>
<p>which he again refused to furnish. The motion before
</p>
<p>Chief-Justice Savage coming on, Mr. Maxwell ap-
</p>
<p>peared and made one of his boisterous and inflam-
</p>
<p>matory speeches, to which Mr. Barker was about
</p>
<p>replying, when the chief-justice observed to him that a
</p>
<p>reply was unnecessary, that all he had to do was to
</p>
<p>verify his own statement, and the court would, under
</p>
<p>the circumstances, consider it the case to be- passed
</p>
<p>upon.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of establishing before the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court that Maxwell did not present the complaint of

<p>further says, that he was one of the grand jury for the
</p>
<p>court of sessions for the month of July, 1827, and that
</p>
<p>he acted as foreman thereof; that Mr. Jacob Barker

<p>applied to this deponent to know if sundry papers had

<p>said Barker alleged that he had placed' in the hands of

<p>over to the court of sessions as unfinished business, for

</p>
<p>"Was about to argue thereon, among other things, that
</p>
<p>the verdict was against evidence, when the district
</p>
<p>attorney requested to have such argument deferred
</p>
<p>until the judge's report of the case should come in,
</p>
<p>which he stated to the court was in progress of copy-
</p>
<p>ing. At that time Judge Edwards was in Utica, where
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court was sitting, on his way to Penfield.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker made application to him to know if he was
</p>
<p>preparing a report of the case. On being informed
</p>
<p>that he was not, and should not, unless required to do
</p>
<p>so by the Supreme Court, being again requested to
</p>
<p>examine the case prepared by Mr. Barker, he declined.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker then requested him to examine his state-
</p>
<p>ment of the judge's charge, and to certify the same if
</p>
<p>correctly stated; if not correctly stated, to point out
</p>
<p>the errors for the use of the Supreme Court, w^hich he
</p>
<p>utterly refused to do, and repeated that he would not
</p>
<p>do any thing about the case, neither for the one party
</p>
<p>or the other ; that he had determined not to look at any
</p>
<p>statement made by either, and, unless the court should
</p>
<p>require of him a report, he would not make any.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker then informed him of Maxwell's motion
</p>
<p>and statement to the Supreme Court, and requested
</p>
<p>him to defer his departure for the West until the court
</p>
<p>should meet the next day, that he  Mr. Barker  might
</p>
<p>have time to apply for such order, which he declined to
</p>
<p>do, and departed from Utica without making any report.
</p>
<p>After his departure, the district attorney sent a mes-
</p>
<p>senger to him with a statement of the trial, prepared
</p>
<p>under the direction of the district attorney, by his
</p>
<p>clerk or partner, without reference to or aid of the
</p>
<p>notes from the judge.

</p>
<p>Mr. Barker was assisted by Ambrose Spencer, Esq.,
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKEB. 261
</p>
<p>who insisted that there was sufficient error in the record
</p>
<p>to quash the whole proceedings; and, therefore, it was
</p>
<p>unnecessary to await the return of the public prose-
</p>
<p>cutor's messenger.
</p>
<p>The writ of error was taken up and discussed at
</p>
<p>great length hj the counsel on both sides, in which
</p>
<p>Judge Spencer distinguished himself, as usual, making
</p>
<p>a very logical, learned, and impressive speech.
</p>
<p>The court sustained the writ of error. In pro-
</p>
<p>nouncing their decision, they said, among other things,
</p>
<p>that in the district attorney's answer to Mr. Barker's
</p>
<p>application on the trial to produce the papers delivered
</p>
<p>by Mr. Barker to the grand jury, and removed by him
</p>
<p>from the files of the court, he said "he had them not,"
</p>
<p>Vy'hen he had them. This appears in the decisions of
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of New York for 1827. After this
</p>
<p>decision. Maxwell left Utica; his messenger had not
</p>
<p>then returned. When he came back he brought the
</p>
<p>case which had been prepared by Maxwell, certified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>"Upon comparing the foregoing case witn my notes,
</p>
<p>I believe it to be substantially a correct report of the
</p>
<p>testimony of the witnesses as given on the trial. The
</p>
<p>books and other documents, including the affidavits as
</p>
<p>to the testimony of General Swift, will, I understand,

</p>
<p>Court until ordered by them to do so, is not less sur-
</p>
<p>prising than that he should continue to withhold a copy
</p>
<p>of his minutes and of his charge, and certify as correct
</p>
<p>the statement of the district attorney, without giving
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker an opportunity of pointing out the mani-
</p>
<p>fold errors and discrepancies which run through the
</p>
<p>whole document; which document the judge states in
</p>
<p>his certificate he had compared with his own notes,
</p>
<p>without saying that his notes were short and imperfect,
</p>
<p> a fact within his own knowledge, and which had in-
</p>
<p>duced him to declare to Mr. Grij0&n and Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>that he could not rely upon them,  and yet he refers to
</p>
<p>his own notes in his certificate in such terms as would,
</p>
<p>in the opinion of Mr. Barker, lead the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>to suppose they were full and accurate, and entitled to
</p>
<p>implicit confidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker, wishing the public to understand the
</p>
<p>district attorney's version of all that had occurred,
</p>
<p>borrowed the document from the messenger, and, with
</p>
<p>the assistance of three or four friends, took a copy of
</p>
<p>it before the rising of the sun on the following day ;
</p>
<p>which copy, although imperfect and full of errors, he
</p>
<p>caused to be immediately published in pamphlet form.
</p>
<p>The public mind was constantly poisoned by the
</p>
<p>erroneous statements of Maxwell, his inflammatory
</p>
<p>speeches and newspaper misrepresentations ; in refuting
</p>
<p>which James Gordon Bennett, Esq., then editor of the
</p>
<p>'' National Advocate," was particularly useful, and did
</p>
<p>more to disabuse the public mind than all the other

<p>under lasting obligations.

<p>CHAPTER XX.
</p>
<p>CHANCERY SUIT.
</p>
<p>The conspiracy trials being over, and tlie chancery
</p>
<p>suit continued, Mr. Barker caused many members of
</p>
<p>the grand jury, the district attorney, clerk of the court,
</p>
<p>many of the directors and officers of the institutions
</p>
<p>alleged to have been defrauded, to be examined, under
</p>
<p>oath, as witnesses before the master in chancery, to
</p>
<p>whom the case had been referred, from some of whom
</p>
<p>he obtained the original records of the parties to the
</p>
<p>fraud on the Tradesmen's Bank, fixing the date when it
</p>
<p>happened, at which time he was not in the State of New
</p>
<p>York; proved that he had been wrongfully deprived of
</p>
<p>his papers by Hugh Maxwell, who promised the grand
</p>
<p>jury that they should be forthcoming on the trial ; that
</p>
<p>Maxwell took from the clerk of the court Mr. Barker's
</p>
<p>proofs as soon as the grand jury filed them, and selected
</p>
<p>therefrom. the letters, six in number, from Mr. Eckford
</p>
<p>to Mr. Barker, which went to contradict the declaration
</p>
<p>that Maxwell graciously made, viz. : '' that Mr. Eck-
</p>
<p>ford had been made the victim of others." When he
</p>
<p>promised to restore him to the good opinion of his
</p>
<p>acquaintances, the letters he took off, leaving the
</p>
<p>other papers. When called upon to produce them on
</p>
<p>the trial, he said he had them not. Mr. Hatfield proved
</p>
<p>he had them in court, and that he knew he had them
</p>
<p>there. The trial went on, and he did not produce them ;

</p>
<p>that when he was constrained by the court of chancery,
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 265
</p>
<p>long after the trial, to account for them, he filed, with
</p>
<p>the clerk of the court from which he took them, seven
</p>
<p>letters ; the seventh was not addressed to nor intended
</p>
<p>for Mr. Barker, who had never seen it ; thus furnishing
</p>
<p>the strongest presumptive evidence that an unworthy
</p>
<p>intrigue had been going on between the public prose-
</p>
<p>cutor and an indicted and unacquitted individual. This
</p>
<p>testimony also established Mr. B.'s entire freedom from
</p>
<p>all the offences charged ; whereupon he called a public
</p>
<p>meeting at the Merchants' Exchange, in Wall Street,
</p>
<p>and exhibited the record of the midnight conspirators
</p>
<p>against the Tradesmen's Bank. The said record was in
</p>
<p>the handwriting of the recorder, Richard Riker, who had
</p>
<p>wrongfully made Mr. B. pay five hundred dollars for
</p>
<p>publishing alleged libels in relation to the conspiracy
</p>
<p>trials, and put him under bonds not to do so again. He
</p>
<p>urged on the grand jury the importance of these papers,
</p>
<p>stating he relied upon them as a shield in the approach-
</p>
<p>ing trial; that the object of the district attorney in de-
</p>
<p>manding to have them delivered to him was to shield
</p>
<p>those against whom the complaint under consideration
</p>
<p>was made for conspiring to make Mr. B. answerable for
</p>
<p>their own sins, and if he did get possession they would
</p>
<p>not be forthcoming on the trial. The grand jurors tes-
</p>
<p>tified to Mr. Barker's extreme reluctance at leaving
</p>
<p>them. Depriving an accused party of the evidence on
</p>
<p>which he relied for his defence, which was documentary,
</p>
<p>in his own possession, and his own property, was as
</p>
<p>great an outrage as was ever committed by the public
</p>
<p>prosecutor of any country.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker, from anxiety that the public should be
</p>
<p>kept informed of all the facts of the case, applied to many

<p>of the city papers for the publication of the necessary

<p>again. The district attorney stated that the court was
</p>
<p>a safe deposite for those papers, and that Mr. Barker
</p>
<p>could have them when required. Mr. Barker gave them
</p>
<p>up with great reluctance. He considered the district

<p>to the court.

<p>that there was a suit coming on shortly against him for
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 271
</p>
<p>an alleged conspiracy, in which those papers would be
</p>
<p>of the most essential service to him. Mr. Barker parted
</p>
<p>with them with great reluctance.
</p>
<p>"Being examined by Mr. Hoffman, says, He knows
</p>
<p>of no schedule of said papers being made ; cannot enu-
</p>
<p>merate them. There may have been one or two of them
</p>
<p>which were not read. Says there may have been from
</p>
<p>twelve to fifteen papers, perhaps more, perhaps less; he
</p>
<p>cannot speak with certainty as to their number ; rather
</p>
<p>thinks there were rising twelve; there were probably

<p>three letters from Mr. Eckford.

</p>
<p>over to him, he says the same is correct, and is a fair
</p>
<p>statement of what took place before the grand jury on
</p>
<p>that occasion. Says it was perfectly understood by the
</p>
<p>grand jury that Mr. Barker was to have the benefit of
</p>
<p>the papers at the approaching trial for the alleged con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and that when Mr. Barker objected to leaving
</p>
<p>his papers with the grand jury, the question was put to
</p>
<p>him whether he waS willing to leave the papers rather
</p>
<p>than withdraw his complaint. Mr. Barker replied, if he
</p>
<p>could not have them back on any other terms he would
</p>
<p>rather leave them ; and he left them with extreme re-
</p>
<p>luctance. Mr. Maxwell argued his right to appear be-
</p>
<p>fore the grand jury at that time, and it was opposed by
</p>
<p>some of the grand jury.

</p>
<p>a member of the grand jury the fore part of last sum-
</p>
<p>mer. The testimony of Clarkson Crolius and Edward
</p>
<p>Probyn being read over to him, he says said testimony
</p>
<p>is generally correct. The district attorney claimed that
</p>
<p>these documents belonged to the court, and that as
</p>
<p>such it was his duty not to allow them to be returned
</p>
<p>to Mr. Barker, but that they would at all times be access-

</p>
<p>The testimony of Clarkson Crolius, Edward Probyn,
</p>
<p>and Anson G. Phelps being read over to him at his
</p>
<p>request, he says it is generally correct throughout, and
</p>
<p>is substantially true. Mr. Maxwell was present, and
</p>
<p>insisted upon his right to be present, before the grand
</p>
<p>jury. Some of the jury were very much opposed to it.
</p>
<p>There was some discussion among fhe jury. There was
</p>
<p>a considerable number of papers laid before the grand
</p>
<p>jury by Mr. Barker : they were handed to the foreman.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker objected very strongly to their being re-

<p>tained by the jury and kept from him. These papers
</p>
<p>were handed to the court. The district attorney told

<p>the foreman of the grand jury to retain them and hand

<p>them to the court, and not to return them to Mr. Barker.

<p>referred to were left with Mr. Hatfield some two or

<p>three weeks ago. The four papers denominated the

</p>
<p>"Being asked, Have they remained in your posses-

</p>
<p>that he, the district attorney, had them ?

</p>
<p>very soon thereafter, on wliieh they were received from
</p>
<p>the grand jury ; I think it was in court where they
</p>
<p>were received ; I handed him the bundle to look at ;
</p>
<p>he selected out the letters of Mr. Eckford, and was
</p>
<p>about taking them away, leaving the others. I requested
</p>
<p>him to stop until I could take a list of them. He did
</p>
<p>so ; I made a memorandum on the bundle that six letters
</p>
<p>from Henry Eckford to Mr. Barker had been taken out
</p>
<p>and delivered to the district attorney, with Mr. Barker's
</p>
<p>deposition, or words to that effect,
</p>
<p>"Being asked, Did Mr. Maxwell leave some papers
</p>
<p>with you, on Friday, the twenty-fifth day of January,
</p>
<p>one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, denomi-
</p>
<p>nated the Rathbone papers? and how many?
</p>
<p>"He answers. He left four papers with me, marked
</p>
<p>1 2, 3, 4.
</p>
<p>"Being asked. Did Mr. Maxwell require a receipt
</p>
<p>for said papers ?
</p>
<p>"He answers. He did; I gave it.
</p>
<p>"Being asked, Were those papers ever in your pos-
</p>
<p>session before?
</p>
<p>"He answers, Never before.
</p>
<p>"Being asked, Were they not among any papers
</p>
<p>previously filed by you as clerk ?
</p>
<p>"He answers, They were not.'*
</p>
<p>The reader will observe that Mr. Maxwell, under the
</p>
<p>solemnity of his oath, says, "If the mistake had been
</p>
<p>explained, they would have been exhibited;" and that
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, under the solemnity of his oath, says,
</p>
<p>"That on receiving the subpoena to produce the papers,
</p>

<p>and informed the district attorney that he, Hatfield, had
</p>
<p>280 LIFE OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>them not, but that he, the district attorney, had them."
</p>
<p>Thus, we see, the alleged mistake was explained, and
</p>
<p>yet the papers were not produced, and to believe they
</p>
<p>were forgotten requires an uncommon share of charity;
</p>
<p>and in forming an opinion on this solemn point the mind
</p>
<p>is irresistibly led to review the whole conduct of the dis-
</p>
<p>trict attorney in the case, especially the manner in
</p>
<p>which he obtained the papers, the solemn promise made
</p>
<p>to the grand jury that the papers should be produced
</p>
<p>on trial, the unlawful manner of removing them from
</p>
<p>the files of the court, the indignity with which he
</p>
<p>treated the Supreme Court in defying their authority,
</p>
<p>by telling them he would not submit to its exercise,
</p>
<p>when they refused to allow the cause to go back to the
</p>
<p>court of oyer and terminer, and by subsequently apply-
</p>
<p>ing to the grand jury for new indictments to enable him
</p>
<p>to carry that defiance into effect. The few individuals
</p>
<p>who have contributed their money towards the purchase
</p>
<p>of a service of plate for the district attorney are re-
</p>
<p>quested to consider these things, and also to read the
</p>
<p>preceding testimony, that they may know the character
</p>
<p>and conduct that they have undertaken to sustain.
</p>
<p>When I detected and exposed the appalling fact that
</p>
<p>the district attorney had accepted of three hundred dollars
</p>
<p>from Mr. Eckford, and other sums from divers others
</p>
<p>of the indicted, immediately after the first trial, it was
</p>
<p>attempted by Mr. Maxwell or his friend, through the
</p>
<p>columns of the Enquirer, to induce the public to believe
</p>
<p>that the letters from Mr. Eckford, of which the district
</p>
<p>attorney deprived me, were of no consequence; I ask
</p>
<p>the reader to consider that of the 7th of May, and also
</p>

</p>
<p>"Being asked. Were you both directors of the Life

</p>
<p>" He answers, Witness thinks he was, and he be-
</p>
<p>lieves William P. Bathbone was, during June and July,

<p>never met him there.

</p>
<p>name, which it was agreed between the committee of
</p>
<p>the bank, of which witness was one, and Rathbone, should
</p>
<p>not be transferred.
</p>
<p>"Being asked. Was Rathbone's account settled by
</p>
<p>Gouverneur with the bank, and was all the stock which
</p>
<p>h{fd been transferred to Rathbone delivered to the
</p>
<p>bank ?
</p>
<p>" He answers, The account was so settled, and the
</p>
<p>stock so delivered.
</p>
<p>'' Being asked, Did the stock so delivered to the bank
</p>
<p>embrace eight hundred shares which had been trans-
</p>
<p>ferred by Rathbone to Seth Sturtevant ?
</p>
<p>" He answers. It did.
</p>
<p>" Being asked. Did you make the bargain for the
</p>
<p>sale of the whole of the stock transferred to Rathbone ?
</p>
<p>'' He answers. He did.
</p>
<p>" Being asked. With whom ?
</p>
<p>" He answers. With Mr. M. L. Davis, as agent, as
</p>
<p>he (Davis) said, and not himself (Davis) interested a
</p>
<p>shilling.
</p>
<p>'' Being asked. Did he tell you for whom he made
</p>
<p>such purchase ?
</p>
<p>" He answers. He did not in distinct terms, but gave
</p>
<p>him to understand, and in such manner that Mr. Davis
</p>
<p>could not but have known at the time the impression
</p>
<p>made on witness's mind, which was, that Davis had been
</p>
<p>acting in the business as agent of Mr. Eckford. His
</p>
<p>reasons for thinking so were, that Mr. Davis previously
</p>
<p>informed him he had consulted with Mr. Eckford relative
</p>
<p>to said purchase, and that about the time of concluding
</p>
<p>the purchase Mr. Davis told witness he had to consult
</p>
<p>two persons, who were all that knew of the negotiation

<p>for the purchase, except Mr. Davis. Witness then
</p>
<p>284 LIFE or JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>asked Mr. Davis who those persons were ; to which
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis replied, One is William P. Rathbone, and
</p>
<p>hesitated about naming the other, when witness said the
</p>
<p>other must be Mr. Eckford ; and witness said so because
</p>
<p>Davis had previously told him that he had consulted
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford. Upon witness naming Mr. Eckford, Mr.
</p>
<p>Davis smiled, and confirmed the impression upon wit-
</p>
<p>ness's mind, that he was acting for Mr. Eckford.
</p>
<p>"Being asked, Did Mr. Davis enjoin upon you not
</p>
<p>to let Mr. Barker know any thing about the purchase of
</p>
<p>the said bank ?
</p>
<p>" He answers, He enjoined him not to let any one
</p>
<p>know about it, but did not mention Mr. Barker in par-
</p>
<p>ticular, further than saying Mr. Barker knew nothing
</p>
<p>about it.
</p>
<p>" Being asked. Did you ever have any conversation
</p>
<p>with Mr. Barker relative to the purchase or sale of said
</p>
<p>bank-stock ?
</p>
<p>'' He answers, Never.
</p>
<p>'' Being asked. Did Josiah Hedden call upon you to
</p>
<p>obtain a contract for the purchase of the Tradesmen's
</p>
<p>Bank,, after the recent indictments for alleged conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>" He answers. He did.
</p>
<p>" Being asked, Did not Mr. Hedden tell you, that if
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker could be convicted, Mr. Maxwell would be
</p>
<p>satisfied, and all the rest would be let ojff ?
</p>
<p>"Witness answers, He did tell him so; but it was at
</p>
<p>a previous conversation to the one in which he applied
</p>
<p>for a contract.
</p>
<p>" Being asked, Did you not reply to Mr. Hedden,
</p>
<p>that you would not give up the contract to be used
</p>
<p>against Mr. Barker, without being called on the stand

<p>as a witness, where you could explain it, and how it
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 285
</p>
<p>came to your hands, and, by the God that made you,
</p>
<p>Barker had nothing to do with it ?
</p>
<p>" He answers, That he held such conversation appli-
</p>
<p>cable to a paper in witness's possession, which Hedden
</p>
<p>alleged that he knew witness was in possession of, which
</p>
<p>paper purported to be a contract for the purchase and
</p>
<p>sale of the aforesaid stock of the Tradesmen's Bank,
</p>
<p>but which had not been executed by witness ; and told
</p>
<p>Mr. Hedden that I would not part with it to be used
</p>
<p>to the prejudice of Mr. Barker, excepting I was called
</p>
<p>as a witness to explain how it came into my hands.
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis told me that Mr. Barker knew nothing about
</p>
<p>the purchase of the bank, and, by the God that made
</p>
<p>me, it shall never be used, without an explanation, to the
</p>
<p>injury of Mr. Barker.
</p>
<p>" Being asked. Did you not afterwards meet Mr.
</p>
<p>Maxwell at Hedden' s house ?
</p>
<p>"Witness answers, He did meet him there; but he
</p>
<p>does not know whether it was before or after the afore-
</p>
<p>said application by Mr. Hedden.
</p>
<p>" Being asked. Did Mr. Maxwell say to you at that
</p>
<p>time that he considered you innocent of the charges
</p>
<p>made against you in relation to the Tradesmen's Bank ?
</p>
<p>*' He answers, Mr. Maxwell said he was perfectly
</p>
<p>satisfied with witness's conduct in relation to the Trades-
</p>
<p>men's Bank, and that he should discharge the indict-
</p>
<p>ment ; witness says it was in the presence of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Hedden.
</p>
<p>"Being asked. Did the said paper, for which Hedden
</p>
<p>applied, mention Mr. Barker's name, or any thing to
</p>
<p>lead you to suppose that he. Barker, had any thing to
</p>
<p>do with the purchase of the said stock in the Trades-

</p>
<p>"He answers, It did not.
</p>
<p>" Being further asked by Mr. Barker, Did some of
</p>
<p>the stockholders of the Tradesmen's Bank meet at your
</p>
<p>house on the subject of disposing of their stock as afore-
</p>
<p>said; if yea, when, and who were they, and what was
</p>
<p>done ?
</p>
<p>'^ He answers, That about the middle of June, 1826,
</p>
<p>he thinks it was on the evening of the 14th, a number
</p>
<p>of stockholders met at his house, when he stated to
</p>
<p>them that he had been offered twenty-four per cent., and
</p>
<p>to retain the dividend of four per cent, then about to be
</p>
<p>declared. The payment as before stated, or, if we pre-
</p>
<p>ferred it, (in lieu of the Life and Fire bonds,) could
</p>
<p>have the post notes of the Morris Canal and Banking
</p>
<p>Company, payable on the 15th of July then ensuing;
</p>
<p>and that he felt it his duty to submit said proposition to
</p>
<p>them for their consideration. That he then left the
</p>
<p>room for a few minutes, and on his return was informed
</p>
<p>that they had concluded to dispose of their stock, in
</p>
<p>amount $300,000, including the stock of one other
</p>
<p>person not then present, each retaining twenty-eight
</p>
<p>shares, excepting the Honorable Richard Riker, who re-
</p>
<p>tained thirty shares. They then authorized the Honor-
</p>
<p>able R. Riker, Judah Hammond, Esq., and witness to
</p>
<p>dispose of our stock in the way and manner before men-
</p>
<p>tioned.
</p>
<p>" Being asked by Mr. Barker, Are the minutes of
</p>
<p>the meeting referred to in writing ? and, if so, are they
</p>
<p>in your possession, and will you produce them ?
</p>
<p>"He answers, I shall decline answering the question,
</p>
<p>on the ground that I have interest depending which may
</p>
<p>be materially affected.

<p>cept* Rodman Bowne, and as to him he cannot speak

<p>with certainty. They all agreed to the sale of said

<p>after the difficulties in the bank arose; then Mr. Reed

<p>showed me such a paper.
</p>
<p>^' Being asked. Did Mr. Reed deliver said paper to
</p>
<p>you?
</p>

</p>
<p>may be mistaken as to its being a contract for the sale

<p>of the stock.
</p>
<p>"Being asked. Will you search for said paper, and,
</p>
<p>if you find it, will you leave it with the master ?

<p>the master.

<p>therein named also attend that meeting, and was the

<p>object of the meeting as specified in said paper ?
</p>
<p>"He answers, I did attend at Mr. Reed's; it was

<p>probably the meeting referred to, and most, if not all

<p>the gentlemen named were present, and it related to the

<p>sale of the Tradesmen's Bank stock.

<p>found it?

<p>found it; that he believes it to be the paper referred to,
</p>
<p>and has it now with him; he received the paper, as he

<p>verily believes, from Matthew Reed, late president of

<p>'' MattJietv Meed, being called again and asked by
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker to state more precisely the amount received
</p>
<p>for premium on the stock of the Tradesmen's Bank,
</p>
<p>sold in 1826, than when formerly examined on the
</p>
<p>subject.
</p>
<p>^'He answers, The agreement was for six thousand
</p>
<p>shares of stock, which at par amount to $300,000, on
</p>
<p>which we were to receive twenty-eight per cent, pre-
</p>
<p>mium."
</p>
<p>It appears by the proceedings of the midnight meet-
</p>
<p>ing, in the handwriting of the recorder, that there
</p>
<p>were fourteen persons present, who clubbed six thousand
</p>
<p>three hundred and ninety-four shares of stock ; the
</p>
<p>unknown purchaser would only take a sufficiency to
</p>
<p>control the bank, say six thousand shares ; the remain-
</p>
<p>ing three hundred and ninety-four the sellers agreed to
</p>
<p>divide equally, when the recorder makes the following
</p>
<p>calculation:

</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>114
</p>
<p>112
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>By reference to the paper, it will be seen that these
</p>
<p>fourteen directors agree each to retain twenty-eight
</p>
<p>shares, and the recorder also agrees to take those two
</p>
<p>remaining shares, in addition to the twenty-eight,  in
</p>
<p>all thirty.

<p>am not mistaken when I say it was at the instance of

<p>faint recollection about it. It might have been at the

</p>
<p>directly or not he cannot say.
</p>
<p>"Being asked, Did you mention to Jacob Barker

<p>about July 3, 1826; and if so, from whom did you re-
</p>
<p>ceive the list of directors for whom you voted?

<p>to look at a paper which I Jiud previously draivn at the
</p>
<p>LIFE or JACOB BARKER. 301
</p>
<p>office of the Life and Fire Insurance Company, and to
</p>
<p>see if it sufficiently explained the object it professed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker looked over it, and remarked it was a large
</p>
<p>amount, was the guarantee of Mr. Eckford, who was
</p>
<p>absent, and that a single word might make a variation
</p>
<p>in its import, and suggested that a clause be added
</p>
<p>allowing Mr. Eckford to return the stock in parcels, as
</p>
<p>might suit the convenience of Mr. Eckford. As it was
</p>
<p>then drawn, Mr. Barker stated, Mr. Eckford would be
</p>
<p>obliged to return the whole stock together. Mr. Barker

<p>heard said paper read by Mr. Maxwell, the district
</p>
<p>attorney, on the late conspiracy trials."
</p>
<p>When the testimony was about closing, Mr. Biker
</p>
<p>appeared before the master and made the following ex-
</p>
<p>planations, which, in my opinion, afford no justification
</p>
<p>for the sale of the bank to a concealed purchaser, much
</p>
<p>less for withdrawing good notes to the amount of two
</p>
<p>or three hundred thousand dollars, and leaving in lieu

<p>thereof the checks of an irresponsible person who had
</p>
<p>no money in the bank.

<p>conversations with Mr. Reed about the time of the

<p>agreement to sell the stock of the Tradesmen's Bank,
</p>
<p>and frequently since, and even to this time, deponent is

<p>firmly convinced that Mr. Reed fully believed that Mr.
</p>
<p>Henry Eckford was the purchaser or principal purchaser
</p>
<p>of the stock of said bank, agreed to be sold through
</p>
<p>Mr. Reed, as hereinbefore testified by deponent. He is
</p>
<p>so convinced because Mr. Reed assigned to deponent

<p>several reasons why he thought Mr. Eckford to be such

<p>purchaser, among which were that Mr. Eckford no

</p>
<p>doubt wished to increase his influence in the upper part
</p>
<p>of the city, and that the control of the bank would
</p>
<p>greatly enable him to do so ; and . he, deponent, thinks
</p>
<p>Mr. Reed said it would be beneficial in his business.
</p>
<p>The deponent believes that Mr. Reed also referred to
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford's business as connected with his ship-
</p>
<p>yards.
</p>
<p>"Deponent recollects very well that Mr. Reed men-
</p>
<p>tioned that Mr. Eckford was ambitious. Mr. Reed has
</p>
<p>frequently agreed with deponent that the stock of said
</p>
<p>bank, if well managed by Mr. Eckford, under the ad-
</p>
<p>vantages he possessed, might be made a nine per cent,
</p>
<p>stock; and witness believes Mr. Reed had no doubt Mr.
</p>
<p>Eckford was a very wealthy man. Deponent further
</p>
<p>says that Mr. Reed has not only, as far as this depo-
</p>
<p>nent know^s, spoken of Mr. Eckford as being the pur-
</p>
<p>chaser, as he believed  though he never has said that
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford was the purchaser, of his own knowledge
</p>
<p> yet has at no time intimated, to deponent's know-
</p>
<p>ledge, that any other person was said purchaser. And
</p>
<p>deponent is fully satisfied that Mr. Reed, as well as this
</p>
<p>deponent, has frequently declared that Mr. Barker had
</p>
<p>nothing to do with said purchase, as he or this deponent
</p>
<p>knew or believed; and, as an additional reason, Mr.
</p>
<p>Gouverneur, according to the best of this deponent's
</p>
<p>recollection and belief, in open court, on the first trial,
</p>
<p>or subsequent to the conspiracy case, testified that Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker had nothing to do with the purchase of the
</p>
<p>stock of the Tradesmen's Bank. And this deponent
</p>
<p>further says that it is his present belief, and that depo-
</p>
<p>nent has never concealed from any one the fact, that
</p>
<p>the deponent believed Mr. Eckford to be the purchaser,

<p>chase, though deponent must acid that he has never
</p>
<p>been distinctly informed by Mr. Reed who was the pur-
</p>
<p>chaser. Mr. Rathbone attended at the bank and re-
</p>
<p>ceived the transfer of deponent's stock. The witness
</p>
<p>conceived Mr. Rathbone to be the agent of Mr. Eckford,
</p>
<p>and that, among other things, greatly confirmed depo-
</p>
<p>nent in the belief that Mr. Eckford was the purchaser."
</p>
<p>The following persons, who were concerned in manag-
</p>
<p>ing the business of the companies said to have been de-
</p>
<p>fra/uded, were also examined in the said chancery suit;
</p>
<p>they, one and all, testified that Mr. Barker had not had
</p>
<p>any agency or concern therein :  William Bayard, David
</p>
<p>B. Ogden, Abraham Ogden, S. L. Gouverneur, J. J. Boyd,
</p>
<p>Matthew L. Davis, Thomas Vermilyea, Wm. P. Rath-

<p>A perusal of the testimony elicited in the chancery

<p>suit, after the termination of the "conspiracy trials,"
</p>
<p>will satisfy the reader as to their true character. It
</p>
<p>establishes, 
</p>
<p>1st. That Jacob Barker was to be offered up as a
</p>
<p>victim for the supposed errors of others.
</p>
<p>2d. That Hugh Maxwell, the district attorney, de-
</p>
<p>prived him, in the most illegal and arbitrary manner,
</p>
<p>of papers which established his freedom from offence.
</p>
<p>3d. That Hugh Maxwell had those papers in court
</p>
<p>during the trial, denying that he had them, and not only
</p>
<p>refused Mr. Barker the benefit of their use, but kept
</p>
<p>them long after the trials were all over, and, when

</p>
<p>4tli. That tlie grand jury were induced to deprive
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker of his papers by the positive promise of
</p>
<p>Huo;h Maxwell that he should have the benefit of their
</p>
<p>use on the approaching trial, he asserting that it was
</p>
<p>the duty of the grand jury, whether they found a bill
</p>
<p>or not, on the complaint of Mr. Barker, to retain the
</p>
<p>papers to go before the next grand jury; that they
</p>
<p>would always be safe on the files of the court, where
</p>
<p>either party could have access to them.
</p>
<p>5th. That the excuse oifered by the district attorney
</p>
<p>for refusing to produce them on the trial of Mr. Barker,
</p>
<p>namely, that he forgot the papers were in his possession,
</p>
<p>was of the most extraordinary character. Mr. Hatfield
</p>
<p>stated, on his oath, that during the trial, being called
</p>
<p>on by Mr. Barker for his papers, he applied to Maxwell
</p>
<p>for the letters of Mr. Eckford, which he (Maxwell) took
</p>
<p>from the file of the court, of which he (Hatfield) was
</p>
<p>clerk. That Maxwell admitted to him in court, at the
</p>
<p>very time they were called for, that he had them,
</p>
<p>although when first charged by Mr. Hatfield with having
</p>
<p>them he denied it.
</p>
<p>6th. That the district attorney considered himself so
</p>
<p>far above the law that he dispossessed himself of those
</p>
<p>documents, after he was served with a process from the
</p>
<p>court of chancery to produce them, and otherwise dis-
</p>
<p>obeyed the mandate of the court, to escape from which
</p>
<p>he placed them in the ofiice of the clerk of the court
</p>
<p>where the conspiracy trials took place. This disposition
</p>
<p>of the papers was after his difficulties with Mr. Eckford
</p>
<p>had been renewed, and after it became public that he
</p>
<p>had received $300 from that gentleman.
</p>
<p>These papers falsified his declaration that "Mr. Eck-

</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 305
</p>
<p>8tli. That Hugh. Maxwell accepted of money from
</p>
<p>"indicted but untried and unacquitted individuals."
</p>
<p>The professed object may have been to conduct civil
</p>
<p>suits for these "indicted but untried and Unacquitted
</p>
<p>individuals:" yet these "indicted but untried and unac-
</p>
<p>quitted individuals" were not either of them brought to
</p>
<p>> trial after the receipt of their money.
</p>
<p>The district attorney promised to say to his acquaint-
</p>
<p>ances "that Mr. Eckford had been the victim of others,"
</p>
<p>and that he would on all proper occasions, both public
</p>
<p>and otherwise, state it as his opinion that he considered
</p>
<p>that Mr. Eckford was justly entitled to the same degree
</p>
<p>of confidence in society that he enjoyed at any former
</p>
<p>period, and that he had full confidence in his integrity
</p>
<p>and honor.
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford demanded a certificate to that efi*ect,
</p>
<p>which Mr. Maxwell refused to sign, saying, in a letter
</p>
<p>addressed to him, under date of 27th November, 1827,
</p>
<p>"The circumstances to which I alluded, as inducing the
</p>
<p>belief that you had been the victim of individuals who
</p>
<p>had abused your confidence, may, when more severely
</p>
<p>examined, admit of a less charitable construction."
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford, failing to induce Maxwell to put his
</p>
<p>often-repeated declaration on paper over his signature,
</p>
<p>demanded personal satisfaction, which being refused,
</p>
<p>\ he published him in the following terms: 
</p>
<p>"New York, Tuesday Evening, December 18, 1827.
</p>
<p>"Sir:  Your real character is at length unmasked.

</p>
<p>tool of other artful and vindictive miscreants.
</p>
<p>"Henry Eckford.
</p>
<p>"Hugh Maxwell, iVezi; YorJc.''
</p>
<p>The "New York American," of the 21st of December,
</p>
<p>1827, says that Hugh Maxwell, the district attorney,
</p>
<p>had Mr. Eckford taken up for sending a challenge, and
</p>
<p>William T. McCowen and John P. Decatur, his accom-
</p>
<p>plices, bound over to keej) the peace.
</p>
<p>Colonel Decatur took the message to Maxwell from
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford, demanding satisfaction for his faithless-
</p>
<p>ness. The colonel returned, reporting that Maxwell had
</p>
<p>replied that Mr. Eckford had better remember that he
</p>
<p>paid me three hundred dollars to procure the conviction
</p>
<p>of Barker and be quiet. "No," says Eckford, "pro-
</p>
<p>claim it to the world. I gave him the money as the
</p>
<p>unarmed traveller, with a pistol at his breast, hands his
</p>
<p>purse to the highwayman." Thus the report came first
</p>
<p>to my knowledge, when I immediately addressed to
</p>
<p>Maxwell a letter, in words and figures following : 
</p>
<p>'New York, January 1, 1828.
</p>
<p>" Sir :  Colonel Decatur stated, that when he called
</p>
<p>on you in behalf of Mr. Eckford, you told him that you
</p>
<p>had received three hundred dollars from Mr. Eckford to
</p>
<p>aid in the late prosecution of Jacob Barker.
</p>
<p>"This statement becoming public led to an inquiry
</p>
<p>of Mr. Eckford if he had joined in a plan for my
</p>
<p>conviction. He assured me that, although he did write
</p>
<p>you a letter enclosing three hundred dollars in January

<p>last, (which you know was immediately after the illegal
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 807
</p>
<p>verdict,) and although jon did receive the money and
</p>
<p>did keep it, yet that the object of sending it has been
</p>
<p>misrepresented. The letter in which the money was en-
</p>
<p>closed, now in your possession, may explain the true
</p>
<p>object for which the money was paid. Will you please
</p>
<p>furnish a copy for publication? Mr. Eckford says he
</p>
<p>has no objection. After you heard all the testimony on
</p>
<p>the trial, you made a most inflammatory speech against
</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford, and in resisting his motion, in December,
</p>
<p>to have his trial postponed, you stated that the offended
</p>
<p>laws required that there should be no delay; but, after
</p>
<p>the receipt of the three hundred dollars, you stated that
</p>
<p>' he was made the victim of persons who abused his con-
</p>
<p>fidence,' and did not bring on his trial. The source
</p>
<p>of revenue to yourself was cut off by Mr. Eckford
</p>
<p>having been placed beyond your reach by a 230wer above
</p>
<p>your control ; since which you said, in a letter addressed
</p>
<p>to him, under date of the 27th of November last, 'The
</p>
<p>circumstances to which I alluded, as inducing the belief
</p>
<p>that you had been the victim of individuals who had
</p>
<p>abused your confidence, may, when more severely ex-
</p>
<p>amined, admit of a less charitable construction.'
</p>
<p>"You having thus taken back your friendly declara-
</p>
<p>tions, the motive no longer exists which induced you, in
</p>
<p>the most arbitrary manner, to get possession of my four
</p>
<p>letters from Mr. Eckford, and to withhold them in viola-
</p>
<p>tion of your solemn promise to the grand jury, and to

<p>to, when you used my name to Colonel Decatur, and,

<p>consequently, when you said that Mr. Eckford had

</p>
<p>To this letter no reply was made ; but, on or about the
</p>
<p>same day. Maxwell, after having kept the money about
</p>
<p>eleven months, attempted to return it to Eckford.
</p>
<p>Eckford refused to receive it, when, as I was informed
</p>
<p>and believe, Maxwell took it to the United States

<p>Branch Bank, New York, and deposited it to the credit

<p>of Eckford, where it remained when Mr. Barker last

</p>
<p>himself from the imputation pressed very heavily against

<p>CHAPTER XXII.

<p>CHANCERY SUIT AND ITS DISCLOSURES.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker was indebted to Mrs. Josiah Headen for
</p>
<p>discovering the conspiracy to make him the victim of the
</p>
<p>guilty party. It was concocted, in other words, in her
</p>
<p>presence, or within her hearing: she mentioned it in
</p>
<p>confidence to some female friends, from whom it reached
</p>
<p>Mr. Barker. Having got the scent, he traced the various
</p>
<p>ramifications until he thought he had sufiicient proof to
</p>
<p>cage the game, when he presented the case to the grand
</p>
<p>jury. It was the last day but one of their term of
</p>
<p>service. Maxwell insisted on being present ; Barker
</p>
<p>objected; they sustained his objection, and excluded
</p>
<p>Maxwell. They had a special afternoon session to inves-
</p>
<p>tigate the subject; they determined that there was

</p>
<p>not sufiicient time; notified Barker and Maxwell that
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 311
</p>
<p>the case must go over to the next grand jury. Max-
</p>
<p>well demanded the papers;  Barker objected, told the
</p>
<p>grand jury that Maxwell's object was to get hold of
</p>
<p>them to protect the other indicted but untried indi-
</p>
<p>viduals whom he had promised, on conditions, to let off,
</p>
<p>that they were all-important for his (Barker's) defence.
</p>
<p>He promised the grand jury that Barker should have
</p>
<p>the benefit of them on the trial. Barker replied, that
</p>
<p>if Maxwell got them they would not be ever again seen.
</p>
<p>The grand jury told Barker they would return them to
</p>
<p>him if he would withdraw the complaint. He replied,
</p>
<p>he never would do that. They then said they must re-
</p>
<p>turn them to the court to be presented to the next grand
</p>
<p>jury, proceeded to the court and handed them to the
</p>
<p>clerk. Maxwell followed and took them from the clerk
</p>
<p>before he had time to take a list of them, and was about
</p>
<p>leaving the court-room, when the clerk called him back
</p>
<p>from the door that he might make a memorandum of
</p>
<p>what they were. He did so. Among the number there
</p>
<p>were six letters from Henry Eckford addressed to Mr.
</p>
<p>Barker, which he retained until long after all the trials
</p>
<p>for conspiracy had terminated, without presenting them
</p>
<p>to the next or to any other grand jury.
</p>
<p>In the progress of the chancery suit, Mr. Barker re-
</p>
<p>quired the attendance of Maxwell and the production
</p>
<p>of the papers. He appeared, refusing to answer many
</p>
<p>of the questions propounded by Barker, and took ad-
</p>
<p>vantage of a witness's right to have them reduced to
</p>
<p>writing; for which purpose the case was adjourned, and
</p>
<p>Maxwell refused to attend again, and left the city; on
</p>

</p>
<p>papers." Had they been produced on the conspiracy
</p>
<p>trials, the clerk of the court of oyer and terminer would
</p>
<p>have been the proper custodian.
</p>
<p>Had they been returned to Mr. Hatfield before the
</p>
<p>service of the subpoena duces tecum from the master in
</p>
<p>chancery, he would have been the proper person. Not
</p>
<p>having done so, it was his duty to have produced them
</p>
<p>to the master.
</p>
<p>When the last conspiracy trial came on, a subpoena
</p>
<p>duces tecum was served on Maxwell to attend as a wit-
</p>
<p>ness and produce those papers. He attended, and said,
</p>
<p>in the language of the Supreme Court in the case of the
</p>
<p>people vs. Jacob Barker and others in 1827, " he had
</p>
<p>them not, when he had them."
</p>
<p>When these papers were produced in the chancery
</p>
<p>suit by Mr. Hatfield, clerk of the court of general ses-
</p>
<p>sions, there was among them a seventh letter from Mr.
</p>
<p>Eckford, not addressed to Mr. Barker, which he had not
</p>
<p>ever seen ; it bore an endorsement in the handwriting
</p>
<p>of Mr. Eckford's counsel, which Maxwell, in his great
</p>
<p>haste to get rid of them, in contempt of the master's
</p>
<p>notice to produce the papers delivered to Mr. Hatfield,
</p>
<p>unintentionally including the seventh letter.
</p>
<p>These disclosures should have admonished Maxwell
</p>
<p>and Rathbone not to have appeared again in New York;
</p>
<p>they should have consigned them, with Leavitt, to the
</p>
<p>contempt of all honest men.

<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>DEATH OF LIEUTENANT WILLIAM H. ALLEN.
</p>
<p>' Very soon after this trial, Mr. Barker was called upon
</p>
<p>to mourn the untimely death of his friend, Lieutenant
</p>
<p>William H. Allen.
</p>
<p>^'Lieutenant William Howard Allen, whose enviable
</p>
<p>reputation is the common property of the nation, was
</p>
<p>born in the city of Hudson, on the 8th of July, 1790.
</p>
<p>''He possessed strong and Aagorous intellectual
</p>
<p>powers, and he mastered the sciences with ease and laid
</p>
<p>a solid foundation for future usefulness. He always
</p>
<p>^^availed himself of every opportunity that offered for
</p>
<p>distinguishing himself, and as occasion required he
</p>
<p>evinced both skill and courage. He was appointed a
</p>
<p>midshipman in 1808, and served on the gun-boats, ships
</p>
<p>Chesapeake and United States. In 1811 he obtained a
</p>
<p>furlough, and made a voyage to Archangel in command
</p>
<p>of the ship Rodman. On the approach of war he re-
</p>
<p>turned to the United States service,  was promoted to
</p>
<p>the second lieutenancy in 1812, when he entered on
</p>
<p>board of the Argus. Her cruise continued prosperous
</p>
<p>until she came in conflict with the British sloop-of-war

</p>
<p>Pelican. Altlioiigh^this vessel was superior to her in
</p>
<p>burden, men, and metal, yet the battle was long, severe,
</p>
<p>and bloody. Early in the action, Captain William
</p>
<p>Henry Allen was mortally wounded and carried below :
</p>
<p>shortly after, the first lieutenant, William H. Watson,
</p>
<p>was severely wounded, and taken to the wardroom.
</p>
<p>The command of the Argus then devolved on Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant William Howard Allen ; his conduct was cool,
</p>
<p>deliberate, and such as received the admiration of the
</p>
<p>crew and the approbation and praise of his superior
</p>
<p>ofiicers. After fighting was useless, the Argus was
</p>
<p>surrendered to the Pelican, a perfect wreck. This was
</p>
<p>on the 13th of August, 1813. Lieutenant Allen was
</p>
<p>taken to Ashburton, England, where he was detained
</p>
<p>eighteen months a prisoner of war. In 1817, he was
</p>
<p>promoted to a first lieutenancy, and served on frigates
</p>
<p>United States, Independence, Columbus, and Congress.
</p>
<p>He sailed as first lieutenant of the latter in 1819 to the
</p>
<p>China seas. She returned in 1821, and he was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed to the command of the Alligator in 1822.
</p>
<p>Sailed from New York on the 3d of August of that
</p>
<p>year, on a cruise against the pirates, in which he
</p>
<p>plucked a wreath of glory, but the shaft of death was *
</p>
<p>in it.
</p>
<p>"On his arrival at Havana, he was informed that a
</p>
<p>gang of pirates, having in possession some merchant-
</p>
<p>vessels, had stationed themselves in the Bay of Le
</p>
<p>Juapo, in the neighborhood of Matanzas. Without
</p>
<p>coming to an anchor, he immediately proceeded in
</p>
<p>search of them. He approached the place, saw the
</p>
<p>pirate vessels, three in number, well armed and supplied,
</p>
<p>and manned with a hundred or more of these despera-

</p>
<p>the mast. In possession of these outhiws were five
</p>
<p>merchantmen and several American citizens ; this pro-
</p>
<p>perty, and these citizens, the gallant Allen determined
</p>
<p>to rescue. The Alligator, in consequence of the shoal-
</p>
<p>ness of the water, could not approach them ; he ordered
</p>
<p>the boats to be manned with about thirty of his crew,
</p>
<p>put himself in the van, and led the attack and boarded
</p>
<p>them. The outlaws resisted, but were driven from their
</p>
<p>flag-vessel, of which he took possession. They fled to
</p>
<p>the other vessels; he pursued them amidst a shower of
</p>
<p>musketry; a musket-ball struck him in the head, still
</p>
<p>he pressed forward, cheering his men, and when about
</p>
<p>to board them, another pierced his breast; this was
</p>
<p>mortal ; still he cheered his gallant little crew as they
</p>
<p>lifted him on board of the prize schooner and laid him
</p>
<p>on the deck he had so dearly won, and he died of his
</p>
<p>wounds about three hours after. He called his officers
</p>
<p>about him, gave directions respecting the prizes,  for
</p>
<p>the merchant-vessels had been rescued,  conversed
</p>
<p>freely and cheerfully ; hoped that his friends and his
</p>
<p>country would be satisfied that he had fought well. He
</p>
<p>said he died in peace w^ith the world, and looked for his
</p>
<p>reward in the next. Although his pain, from the nature
</p>
<p>of his wounds, was excruciating, yet he did not com-
</p>
<p>plain, but died like a martyr, without a sigh or a groan,
</p>
<p>and the spirit of a braver man never entered the unseen
</p>
<p>world. The body of the martyred Allen was conveyed
</p>
<p>to Matanzas, in Cuba, where it was interred on the
</p>
<p>11th ]!^ovember, 1822, with the honors due to his dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished merit.
</p>
<p>"Soon after the reception of this sad intelligence at
</p>
<p>Hudson,  which cast a gloom over the city,  the citi-
</p>
<p>zens of Hudson assembled at the city hall ; and it was

<p>a more mimerous meeting than had ever been witnessed
</p>
<p>in that city. This was on the 5th of December, 1822,
</p>
<p>and on motion of Elisha Williams, the honorable Alex-

<p>ander Coffin was called to the chair, and on motion of

<p>Lieutenant William Howard Allen.
</p>
<p>I "The common council of the city of Hudson re-
</p>
<p>quested of the Navy Department to have the remains
</p>
<p>of Lieutenant Allen brought from Matanzas to New

<p>15th of December, 1827, the schooner Grampus arrived
</p>
<p>at New York, having on board the remains of the
</p>
<p>lamented hero. On the reception of this intelligence,
</p>
<p>the common council of the city of Hudson deputed Mr.

<p>recorder, to receive and bring them to his native city.
</p>
<p>On the Wednesday following, they were Removed from

<p>the navy-yard at Brooklyn, under the escort of the
</p>
<p>marine corps of that station, and accompanied by Com-
</p>
<p>modore Chauncey and a numerous body of naval officers.
</p>
<p>The colors at the yard and at New York were at half
</p>
<p>mast, and the procession landed at New York amid the
</p>
<p>firing of a salute from the Grampus, which had been
</p>
<p> moored in the stream for that purpose. At New York

<p>the procession was joined by the common council of

</p>
<p>322 LIFE OF JACOB BAEKER.
</p>
<p>tinguislied for tlieir liberality and patriotism, erected
</p>
<p>in 1833 a splendid monument to his memory.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the career of one whose merits as a
</p>
<p>citizen, son, brother, friend, and officer have never been
</p>
<p>excelled and rarely equalled.
</p>
<p>Before the trial of the indictment. Lieutenant Allen
</p>
<p>sailed in command of the United States vessel of war
</p>
<p>Alligator, in pursuit of the pirates who then infested
</p>
<p>the West Indies, and was killed in 1822 by a shot from
</p>
<p>a piratical boat when pursuing them at the head of his
</p>
<p>boats' crew, inside a reef on which there was not suffi-
</p>
<p>cient water for the Alligator to pass.
</p>
<p>The following lines, from the pen of Halleck, com-
</p>
<p>memorate his lamented fate : 
</p>
<p>" He hath been mourn'd as brave men mourn the brave,
</p>
<p>And wept as nations weep their cherish'd dead,
</p>
<p>With bitter, but proud tears, and o'er his head
</p>
<p>The eternal flowers whose root is in the grave,
</p>
<p>The flowers of fame are beautiful and green;
</p>
<p>And by his grave's side pilgrim feet have been, ^
</p>
<p>And blessings, pure as men to martyrs give,
</p>
<p>Have there been breathed by those who died to save.
</p>
<p>Pride of his country's banded chivalry,
</p>
<p>His fame their hope, his name their battle-cry ;
</p>
<p>He lived as mothers wish their sons to live,
</p>
<p>He died as fathers wish their sons to die.
</p>
<p>If on the grief- worn cheek the hues of bliss,
</p>
<p>Which fade when all we love is in the tomb.
</p>
<p>Could ever know on earth a second bloom.
</p>
<p>The memory of a gallant death like his
</p>
<p>Would call them into being  but the few,
</p>
<p>Who as their friend, their brother, or their son,
</p>
<p>His kind, warm heart and gentle spirit knew.

</p>
<p>And life's best joys were sori'ows but with him ;
</p>
<p>And when  the burning bullet in his breast 
</p>
<p>He dropp'd, like summer fruit from off the bough,
</p>
<p>There was one heart that knew and loved him best:  
</p>
<p>It was a mother's,  and is broken now."
</p>
<p>MR. BARKER AND THE FREE NEGROES OF NEW
</p>
<p>ORLEANS.
</p>
<p>Before his removal to the South, Mr. Barker had
</p>
<p>always taken a deep interest in the welfare of that un-
</p>
<p>fortunate class, the free negroes of the North, and was
</p>
<p>recognized by them as one of their best friends, and
</p>
<p>one to whom they could always resort for advice and
</p>
<p>assistance. On taking up his residence in New Orleans,
</p>
<p>he found there many free people of color, who were
</p>
<p>treated, as he thought, with great harshness, under the
</p>
<p>existing laws and customs. Mr. Barker interposed on
</p>
<p>their behalf, and publicly advocated their cause. This
</p>
<p>interposition, on his part, led to the following publi-
</p>
<p>cation :  ^
</p>
<p>"to the public.
</p>
<p>"My opinions and conduct having been grossly mis-
</p>
<p>represented, I beg to be allowed to speak for myself.
</p>
<p>All my exertions have been, and will continue to be,

<p>confined to sending out of and keeping away from the
</p>
<p>824 Lli'E OF JACOB BARKER.
</p>
<p>State free men of color. This, when properly considered,
</p>
<p>will be approved by every slave-holder.
</p>
<p>'' On the 3d July instant, I wrote to a gentleman at
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, who had employed me to present to court
</p>
<p>the proof of the freedom of a man confined in prison,
</p>
<p>as follows : 
</p>
<p>^'^You should publish in the newspapers, and other-
</p>
<p>wise admonish all free people of color to keep away
</p>
<p>from this place, and especially if they have had their
</p>
<p>freedom established here they should keep away, as all
</p>
<p>such persons are notified to quit the State within sixty
</p>
<p>days, and if they remain or return again after the sixty
</p>
<p>days, but for an hour, they are sent to the penitentiary
</p>
<p>for twelve months, and then ordered to quit in thirty
</p>
<p>days, and if they remain, or return again after the thirty
</p>
<p>days, they are sent to the penitentiary for life.
</p>
<p>'"There is no safety for free men of color not born
</p>
<p>here, or here before 1825, but to keep away from this
</p>
<p>place. This community is justly afraid of their con-
</p>
<p>taminating influence on the slaves, and they cannot be
</p>
<p>permitted to mingle with each other; and while I shall
</p>
<p>at all times be willing to aid in securing to free men the
</p>
<p>exercise of their just right, without regard to color, I
</p>
<p>advocate all constitutional and legal measures for keep-
</p>
<p>ing free people of color away from slave-holding States.
</p>
<p>I think their friends in yourl:^uarter cannot do them a
</p>
<p>better service than to admonish them not to come here.'
</p>
<p>''My conduct has always corresponded with these
</p>
<p>opinions. I have not, in the whole course of my life,
</p>
<p>to my recollection, written or said a word, in or out of
</p>
<p>court, at variance therefrom.

<p>" When admitted to appear in the courts of Louisiana,
</p>
<p>LIFE OF JACOB BARKER. 325
</p>
<p>the laws of the Sttite, as well as mj duty, imposed the
</p>
<p>obligation of fidelity to my clients; and it is strange
</p>
<p>that any one should complain of my having complied
</p>
<p>with the requisites of that obligation. It must have
</p>
<p>been misrepresentation that has led them to do so.
</p>
<p>''If any man feels aggrieved, he has but to point out
</p>
<p>in what particular, and I will afi'ord him all the satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion in my power ; when he will discover that he had
</p>
<p>no just cause of complaint.
</p>
<p>"Why pass laws protecting free men of color, if it is
</p>
<p>to be considered wrong for counsel to appear in their
</p>
<p>behalf? No one will pretend that they are capable of
</p>
<p>maintaining in court their own rights. And if they
</p>
<p>were, they  at work in irons on the highway  could
</p>
<p>not get their cases before the court with the proper
</p>
<p>proofs.
</p>
<p>"It may be here proper for me to state, for the in-
</p>
<p>formation of the public, some of the many facts which
</p>
<p>have come to my knowledge in relation to the treatment
</p>
<p>of free men of color in the prison of the Second Muni-
</p>
<p>cipality. Having occasion to visit that prison, very
</p>
<p>many prisoners poured forth their complaints through
</p>
<p>the grates as I was passing through the road, declaring
</p>
<p>themselves free, that they were unlawfully detained and
</p>
<p>kept at work on the highway in chains. It would have
</p>
<p>been inhuman to have turned a deaf ear. Many of
</p>
<p>them appeared to be so white as for the law to presume
</p>
<p>them free. I immediately represented the case to his
</p>
<p>honor the recorder, who had six of them brought up,
</p>
<p>and pronounced five of them free, from their com-
</p>
<p>plexion, without argument and without requiring any

<p>other testimony; and on my inquiring why they had
</p>
<p>not been liberated the morning 'after their arrest, their
</p>
<p>degree being as visible then as at any other time, hi;3
</p>
<p>honor replied that they bad been placed in the chain-
</p>
<p>gang by the officers of the prison without having them
</p>
<p>brought up before him for examination. Was it wrong
</p>
<p>to interfere in behalf of these men ?
</p>
<p>'^ Public justice, as well as every principle of humanity,
</p>
<p>requires that prisoners, however great their offence,
</p>
<p>should have free communication with their counsel.
</p>
<p>'* On two occasions I was denied all access to prisoners
</p>
<p>in the Second Municipality, in whose defence I had been
</p>
<p>requested to assist, on the plea that no such persons
</p>
<p>were confined. After many months' perseverance, by the
</p>
<p>aid of his honor the recorder, I had an interview with
</p>
<p>one of them, and the only excuse offered for his con-
</p>
<p>cealment was that I had inquired for Charles Chandler,
</p>
<p>when his name was Charles C. Chandler ; and by the
</p>
<p>aid of his honor the mayor, with the other after less
</p>
<p>delay: the excuse for his concealment was that I in-
</p>
<p>quired for James Lloyd Warner, when they had him on
</p>
<p>the prison-books only by the name of Warner. Are
</p>
<p>such practices to be tolerated in this enlightened age?
</p>
<p>There was not any pretence that either of these men
</p>
<p>was a slave.
</p>
<p>'' On a recent occasion, I was informed that a colored
</p>
<p>man, born in my native State, Maine, of free parents,
</p>
<p>was in the chain-gang at work on the highway; had
</p>
<p>been there since September last, although the driver
</p>
<p>of the gang knew him to be free, was born in the same
</p>
<p>town, went to school with him, and had known him from

<p>his childhood. I communicated these facts to his honor

</p>
<p>the recorder ; he had the matter promptly inquired into,
</p>
<p>and the man liberated, but without a penny's compen-
</p>
<p>sation for nine months' services improving the Second
</p>
<p>Municipality.
</p>
<p>"At the prisons of the First and Third Municipality I
</p>
<p>have been treated with the greatest politeness, and
</p>
<p>every facility afforded by the officers and keepers in
</p>
<p>bringing the law to the relief of the prisoners.
</p>
<p>"Again, it was the practice unlawfully to retain pri-
</p>
<p>soners in the Second Municipality for their board, doc-
</p>
<p>tor's bills, &c., after their freedom had been established,
</p>
<p>until I brought the matter before a higher court ; and,
</p>
<p>on one occasion, without crediting on the account ren-
</p>
<p>dered the money taken from him when arrested. The
</p>
<p>public will please to observe that the rule in the Second
</p>
<p>Municipality was to allow prisoners three picayunes a
</p>
<p>day for such days as they labor on the public road, and
</p>
<p>to charge three picayunes a day for their board, in addi-
</p>
<p>tion to the clothing supplied, the doctor's bills, &c.
</p>
<p>Hence, as they cannot labor on Sundays, holidays, or in
</p>
<p>stormy weather, they are brought in debt as soon as
</p>
<p>confined, the amount of which is augmented weekly,
</p>
<p>and, as these men seldom have money, and have no
</p>
<p>means of earning any during their confinement, their
</p>
<p>simple arrest, without being charged with the slightest
</p>
<p>offence, would amount to a decree of perpetual imprison-
</p>
<p>ment if no person from humane feelings had been allowed
</p>
<p>to interfere, and no counsel allowed to bring their case
</p>
<p>before the tribunals of the country.
</p>
<p>"If the police-officers of the Second Municipality
</p>
<p>expect to escape exposure by their attempts to light up

<p>tlieir unlawful and inliuman conduct toward their pri-
