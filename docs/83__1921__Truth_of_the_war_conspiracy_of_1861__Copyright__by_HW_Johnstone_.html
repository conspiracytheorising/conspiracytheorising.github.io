<p>A FOREWORD.
</p>
<p>During President Washington's administration, at a banquet
</p>
<p>of the notables at Richmond, a young man, John Randolph of
</p>
<p>Roanoke, was called on for sentiment. Randolph arose, raised
</p>
<p>his glass, and said :
</p>
<p>^'George Washington, may he be damned" 
</p>
<p>Instantly there was a howl of protest, a threatening move-
</p>
<p>ment. Randolph calmly waited ; then continued 
</p>
<p> ' ' if he signs Jay 's Treaty ! "
</p>
<p>There was a shout of approval.
</p>
<p>I have somewhat to say.

<p>Hear me through, then howl, or shout, as you may feel.
</p>
<p>MEMORANDA
</p>
<p>The crucial period in which the premeditated schemes of the
</p>
<p>fanatics were put into operations, so as to inaugurate actual
</p>
<p>war, was from March 4th, to July 4th, 1861 ; before Congress
</p>
<p>was allowed to meet, to consider it.
</p>
<p>From May 1861 to January 1862 I served in the "5th Geor-
</p>
<p>gia Volunteers," C. S. A. at Pensacola, Florida.
</p>
<p>About July 1st, 1861 an expedition under our Colonel, John
</p>
<p>K. Jackson, attacked "Billy Wilson's Zouaves" (of Boston),
</p>
<p>on Santa Rosa Island, at night. We drove them,  pell mell  
</p>
<p>into Fort Pickens; captvired, and burned, their camps and im-
</p>
<p>mense stores. As we were returning to our boats we were at-
</p>
<p>tacked by a force of "regulars" of the U. S. Army. We drove
</p>
<p>them back; and my Captain, S. W. Mangham, captured their
</p>
<p>commanding officer, Major Vogdes, (who was mounted on a
</p>
<p>mule. )
</p>
<p>Twenty years later, at Fort Adams, R. I., I met General
</p>
<p>Vogdes, who remembered the incident and discussed it. In his
</p>
<p>remarks he stated that he had reinforced Fort Pickens iefore
</p>
<p>Fort Sumter was attacked; hut, that his act was overshadowed
</p>
<p>by the clamor and furore ahoict Fort Sumter.
</p>
<p>That was the first intimation I ever had of that fact. It led
</p>
<p>me to search for some proof of it. I read Stephens, Davis,
</p>
<p>Semmes, Taylor, Maury, ShouJer,  and hundreds of authentic
</p>
<p>magazine articles,  but none cleared the mystery enveloping
</p>
<p>that vital point. It was not until the Records were opened to
</p>
<p>research,  nearly twenty years later,  that I found confirma-
</p>
<p>tion of Vogdes' statement, which led me through devious ways
</p>
<p>to other facts as to M. C. Meigs, H. A. Adams, J. L. Worden,
</p>
<p>D. D. Porter, and many others.
</p>
<p>The mystifying dis  arrangement of those records was a work
</p>
<p>of genius. It seems easy now, but I was years in getting the
</p>
<p>facts into chronological sequence.
</p>
<p>In 1917 I succeeded in perfecting proofs fixing the responsi-
</p>
<p>bility for the "War Between the States," 1861-1865, on one

</p>
<p>man,  Abraham Lincoln.
</p>
<p>My unconscious monitor, Vogdes, was one of the prisoners of
</p>
<p>war designated,  by the Confederate War Department,  to
</p>
<p>suffer the same fate a.s the Federal authorities threatened to
</p>
<p>execute on officers and men,  (part of Admiral Semmes' com-
</p>
<p>mand,)  captured at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
</p>
<p>1861. The "pirates" were not executed; so, Vogdes was saved.
</p>
<p>One of the keenest obsei'vers I ever met was in Washington
</p>
<p>at the time of this secret "War Conspiracy, Admiral Raphael
</p>
<p>Semmes, C. S. N. In 1870 a friend at Mobile invited me to ac-
</p>
<p>company him to the "Anchorage,"  the home of the Admiral, 
</p>
<p>and for an hour I enjoyed tho Admiral's reminiscences. As I
</p>
<p>left he said to me: "Captain, the secret treachery that caused
</p>
<p>the war will come to light, and justify the South. Truth is
</p>
<p>deathless!"
</p>
<p>That was twenty-five years before the "secret" causes were
</p>
<p>unearthed ; and then, were not comprehended, by the employees
</p>
<p>who handled them.
</p>
<p>In the Encyclopedia Brittanica Lincoln's biographer (who
</p>
<p>sign S. F. and L. S.) says: "In early life Lincoln adopted these
</p>
<p>three maxims :
</p>
<p>"1st. Never to swear;
</p>
<p>"2nd. Never to touch liquor;
</p>
<p>"3rd. Ne-ver to lie;
</p>
<p>"And, he never did!"
</p>
<p>I know nothing of his "swears."
</p>
<p>I know Lamon and Herndon picture Lincoln waving a bottle
</p>
<p>in the midst of a drunken mob; and I remember, it was told,
</p>
<p>that he prescribed  "liquor like General Grant drinks!"
</p>
<p> As to his "3rd maxim  Never to lie," I rest on the facts as
</p>
<p>will appear in this article.
</p>
<p>From the same source I quote from Lincoln's first inaugural
</p>
<p>;uldre.ss, March 4th, 1861 :
</p>
<p>(B) "In your hands, my dissatisfied countrymen, and not in
</p>
<p>mine, is the momentous issue of civil war.
</p>
<p>"The Government will not assail you; you can have no con-
</p>
<p>flict without being yourselves the aggressors.''
</p>
<p>That too, With hLs "3rd maxim," I leave to be answered

<p>by the facts of record, as set forth in this article. Bear in mind
</p>
<p>that there was no "Civil War," (except in Missouri); I am
</p>
<p>treating of the "War between the (Sovereign) States."
</p>
<p>In this labor of many years, I have held frequent "imaginary
</p>
<p>conversations," discussions, arguments, with my loyal, trusted
</p>
<p>friend, the Blade  (my old service sword, which hangs on the
</p>
<p>wall, environed by books, records, and memories.)
</p>
<p>The Blade speaks for the Truth ; and points to the record in
</p>
<p>this paper. I bespeak for my trusty friend your patience.
</p>
<p>A word as to the spirit in which this paper is prepared.
</p>
<p>If this article expresses my belief, it is because it sustains it.
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln is, to me, exactly what his own record makes
</p>
<p>him. It would be the same were the Prince of Peace the actor.
</p>
<p>I served four years in the "War between the States." I
</p>
<p>know what it is to meet men armed with a torch in one hand,
</p>
<p>lhe sword of diabolism in the other. (All were not so, else all
</p>
<p>would have died.) I know somewhat of the inferno of "Recon-
</p>
<p>struction." I saw my people suffer, my father's house van-
</p>
<p>dalized, my mother's tomb desecrated, I saw the South des-
</p>
<p>olate !
</p>
<p>Then, I saw my people rise; and, with a courage unequaled,
</p>
<p>restore our waste places and force a re-entrance to "Our Father's
</p>
<p>house, to stay, thank God ! "
</p>
<p>My intent is to discover the facts, establish the Truth, as to
</p>
<p>the responsibility for the horrors of that war.
</p>
<p>To attempt to describe such a tragic drama in cold, i)hilosoph-
</p>
<p>ie terms, would be to fail. If the acts be not set forth in
</p>
<p>words which portray their infamy it might be false, instead of
</p>
<p>an historical Truth.
</p>
<p>Truth is not slander ; nor partisan.
</p>
<p>So, if a just indignation finds vent in good old English, oc-
</p>
<p>casionally, remember the South 's sixty years of foul wrongs;
</p>
<p>and, if your view is worth notice, you will at least smile,  as I

<p>Truth of War Conspiracy
</p>
<p>1861
</p>
<p>When Washington was made President there was no party
</p>
<p>line. John Adams succeeded him, in 1797, without any definite
</p>
<p>party cleavage; but the laws passed under Adams' administra-
</p>
<p>tion,  by Hamilton's influence,  aroused Thomas Jefferson, and
</p>
<p>James Madison, who wrote into the Resolutions of 1798-9 "the
</p>
<p>first clear definite platform of Republican-Democratic princi-
</p>
<p>ples;" which, supplemented b^> "Madison's Report," and epit-
</p>
<p>omized in Jefferson's first inaugural address, set forth the basic
</p>
<p>principles of true Democracy.
</p>
<p>The people rallied to them. Hamilton's Federalism was con-
</p>
<p>demned and Jeffersonian Democracy voted into power.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to recall that the first political struggle in
</p>
<p>Virginia, after these Resolutions were promulgated, was led by
</p>
<p>Jefferson's young kinsman, John Randolph, of Roanoke, then
</p>
<p>26 years old, and his first contest for office. He was opposed by
</p>
<p>the influence of Washington, Marshall, and even Patrick Henry
</p>
<p>w^as somehow against him ; but Randolph was elected, 1799, and
</p>
<p>became a powerful Democratic leader.
</p>
<p>May I ask a pertinent question?
</p>
<p>How long since you read those "Resolutions," or "Madison's
</p>
<p>Report," or Jefferson's first "Inaugural," or Calhoun's "Res-
</p>
<p>olutions of 1833 and 7," or Jefferson Davis's "Resolutions"
</p>
<p>in the U. S. Senate in I860?
</p>
<p>If you are ignorant of them, how do you know what you be-
</p>
<p>lieve ; or that you are a Democrat ?
</p>
<p>There was never a truer patriot in America than John Adams ;
</p>
<p>yet his administration caused his personal friend, Jefferson, to
</p>
<p>write the following in the noted Kentucky Resolutions.
</p>
<p>Hark ye, the father of Democracy speaks:
</p>
<p>^A) "This Commonwealth is determiiied to submit to no undele-
</p>
<p>gated and consequently unlimited power, in no man, or body
</p>
<p>of men on earth,  even the President, whose suspicions may be
</p>
<p>the evidence, his orders the sentence, his officers the executioner

</p>
<p>and his breast the sole record of the transaction.
</p>
<p>"When powers are assumed which have not been delegated, a
</p>
<p>nullification of the act is the rightful remedy; and every state
</p>
<p>has a nntnral right ,in cases not within the compact,  casus-
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>non federis,  to nullify of their own authority all tussumptions
</p>
<p>of povvev by clhers witliin tlicr limits.
</p>
<p>"It would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence (in the
</p>
<p>men or our choice) t.t silence our fears for the safety of our
</p>
<p>rights. Confidence is everyv.here the parent of despotism.
</p>
<p>Jealousy, and not confidence, pi'escribes limited constitutions to
</p>
<p>bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power.
</p>
<p>"In questions of power then, let there be no more heard of
</p>
<p>eonfidf;neo in man; but bind him down from mischief by the
</p>
<p>chains of the constitution."
</p>
<p>Had Abraham Lincoln heeded these great truths, there would
</p>
<p>have been no "War between the States."
</p>
<p>Partisan books, labeled "History," have taught false theories
</p>
<p>until their practice has obtained, in press and pulpit, to a dan-
</p>
<p>gerous ex.Lent. The truth is not always comfortable; but, it is
</p>
<p>always safe.
</p>
<p>A few days ago some of my old veteran comrades cheered the
</p>
<p>sentiment that "Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, et al, estah-
</p>
<p>Ushed and defended Democratic principles."
</p>
<p>My veneration for Washington isolates him from all other
</p>
<p>men ; yet, I love to think he was just human ; and at times so
</p>
<p>near anti-republican centralism, that the cleavage between razed
</p>
<p>his plume,  lofty as it was. Wisely he trusted Jefferson. The
</p>
<p>heritage he left to John Adams brought on the political revolu-
</p>
<p>tion of 1798-1800, led by Jefferson and Madison, as noted.
</p>
<p>Antagonizing those principles is dangerous.
</p>
<p>If the Constitutional principles then established, and prac-
</p>
<p>ticed, by Jefferson, were ever practiced or defended, by Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln, will not some one cite us to the time, the occasion, and
</p>
<p>tlie proof?
</p>
<p>I have not found either.
</p>
<p>My friend, the Blade, has rot withered with age, nor bent
</p>
<p>to cringe and aspostatize. The grip and housings are somewhat
</p>
<p>battered; but, the steel grey bod}' is as keen, as ready, as reliable,
</p>
<p>as when it clanged at a camp fire dance, or gleamed, midst those

</p>
<p>dear "Grey Riders" when our dauntless Chieftain,  Hampton, 
</p>
<p>led the way! My eyes are a little dimmed, my hand less steady,
</p>
<p>my step less elastic,' than when the Blade and I were "first ac-
</p>
<p>quaint;" but, our hearts are st'-'angely young, and still burn as
</p>
<p>w(^ recall those scenes lang syne
</p>
<p>In the night silences the Blade and I often commune,  with-
</p>
<p>out words,  a kind of flow of soul. In one of these reveries, a
</p>
<p>7
</p>
<p>bit. ago, there came, softly, musically, through the stillness
</p>
<p>"I never shall forget the day  "
</p>
<p>I turned to the Blade, inquiringly, and realized it was voices,
</p>
<p>of long ago, singing "Kitty Wells." Then followed "Ben Bolt,"
</p>
<p>and "Lorena." After a pause, "Her Bright Smile Haunts Me
</p>
<p>Still," floated to us on "Evening Breezes," bringing memories
</p>
<p>of a tryst with "Sweet Belle Mahone" at "Killarney," midst
</p>
<p>"Scenes That Are Brightest;' and thence, to meet "Robin
</p>
<p>Adair," and "John Anderson My Jo," "Within a Mile of
</p>
<p>Edinboro Town."
</p>
<p>Will the "old songs" waft the fragrance of the past to the
</p>
<p>' ' Grey Shades, ' ' ' ' Beyond the River ? ' '
</p>
<p>I hope so.
</p>
<p>The Blade presses closer, and whispers of a clean-cut English-
</p>
<p>man who came to us and volunteered to wear "grey." He rode
</p>
<p>with us,  near the front, too,  when danger was abroad.
</p>
<p>I wonder if any others are left who remember how, in the
</p>
<p>stilly night, this quiet man, Frederick Crouch, would sing his
</p>
<p>appeal to her he loved so loyally, and pleaded to so long, 
</p>
<p>"Kathleen Mavourneen?"
</p>
<p>Across all the years I can hear Crouch voicing this,  his own
</p>
<p>song,  with his whole heart in it. A talented man, whose life
</p>
<p>was shadowed by sorrow, he had few intimates ; but ,was a gal-
</p>
<p>lant "Grey Rider," and good to know. He died, at Baltimore,
</p>
<p>with " Mavourneen 's" hand in his, many years ago.
</p>
<p>In all the changes that have come since those days our Dem-
</p>
<p>ocratic principles,  the ba.sis of that four years' struggle,  have
</p>
<p>remained unchanged, steadfast. Our experience in the Greely
</p>
<p>episode taught u.s that a Democrat, in spirit, and in truth,  
</p>
<p>cannot always follow the vagaries of the party.
</p>
<p>As I now write,  1917,  I am oppressed by the fact that the
</p>
<p>"party" has "lost its tag;"- abandoned its basic principles;
</p>
<p>swallowed Hamilton 's whole creed and practice ; established mil-
</p>
<p>itary autocracy to an unknown limit; forgotten Washington's
</p>
<p>and Jefferson's advice and warnings; and, is "off agin," to

</p>
<p>a funeral !
</p>
<p>The Blade soothingly assures me, "Principles don't have
</p>
<p>funerals. We are safe while wo keep a sure grip on our prin-
</p>
<p>ciples."
</p>
<p>Recently the Blade and T were discussing these topics and I
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>read aloud that "The Civil War began when Fort Sumter was
</p>
<p>tired on by the South."
</p>
<p>Instantly the Blade was alert; there was a sound of steely
</p>
<p>friction.
</p>
<p>Then I read an extract from Abraham Lincoln's message to
</p>
<p>Congress, December 1864, and emphasized this sentence:
</p>
<p>"I simply mean to say that the war will cease, on the part of
</p>
<p>the Government, whenever it shall cease on the part of those who
</p>
<p>began it."
</p>
<p>"What's that?" The metallic ring of the restless Blade was
</p>
<p>ominous.
</p>
<p>"Why, the United States Government and Abraham Lincoln
</p>
<p>began the war by committing c't least four flagrant acts of war,
</p>
<p>against two vital points in the South, weeks before Fort Sumter
</p>
<p>was fired on. That these acts w'ere secret, and the most
</p>
<p>treacherous known to civilized diplomacy, does not weaken the
</p>
<p>force of the facts. The seerec.y emphasizes the treachery.
</p>
<p>"Had secret orders been obeyed, or other like orders not
</p>
<p>miscarried, war would have been openly inaugurated at a point
</p>
<p>five hundred miles from Fort Sumter, long before 'Fort Sumter
</p>
<p>was fired on.'
</p>
<p>"That the first open clash was at Fort Sumter, was an acci-
</p>
<p>dent, caused by a misfit in Abraham Lincoln's schemes to force
</p>
<p>war 'at any risk or cost.' "
</p>
<p>I reminded the Blade. There was a solemn agreement, an
</p>
<p>Armistice, existing at Charleston, entered into by the United
</p>
<p>States Government and South Carolina officials on December
</p>
<p>6th, I860; and a special agreement, armistice, at Pensacola,
</p>
<p>entered into by the United States and Florida authorities on
</p>
<p>January 29th, 1861, (both filed in United States War and
</p>
<p>Navy Departments) by which the United States agreed not to
</p>
<p>attempt to reinforce Major Anderson, nor Fort Pickens; and
</p>
<p>South Carolina, Florida and the Confederate authorities, agreed
</p>
<p>to make no attack on Major Anderson, or Fort Pickens, while
</p>
<p>these solemn agreements were observed.

</p>
<p>To violate an armistice is considered a treacherous act of war.
</p>
<p>For either party to prepare to act against a point covered by
</p>
<p>an armistice, is an act of war. It has been held, and rightly,
</p>
<p>that for any person to visit a fortification, where an armistice
</p>
<p>exists, with the intent to advise or plan means or methods, to
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>strengthen such fortification is the act of a spy, a reinforce-
</p>
<p>ment, and an act of war.
</p>
<p>The first who renders force necessary to defend and protect
</p>
<p>a right, is the "aggressor" in a war.
</p>
<p>So that any act, any order intended to change the existing
</p>
<p>status quo at any vital point, especially where an armistice ex-
</p>
<p>ists, by strengthening, or arranging to strengthen, such a place,
</p>
<p>thus making force necessary, is a treacherous act of war.
</p>
<p>Yet, you say that the United States Government, and Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln, ordered, and secretly organized and sent, armed expedi-
</p>
<p>tions, under "secret" instructions, to commit acts in violation
</p>
<p>of existing "armistices."
</p>
<p>Why to organize such a force, to mobilize it, for such a pur-
</p>
<p>pose, is an act of war. Where an armistice exists, such an order
</p>
<p>is a flagrant act of war.
</p>
<p>You are making very serious charges, my friend.
</p>
<p>The Blade firmly rejoined :
</p>
<p>"I am stating facts, incontrovertible truths, and I am citing
</p>
<p>them from secret places, to establish who began war.
</p>
<p>"If the facts establish who was innocent, don't worry about
</p>
<p>the guilty, for the Prince of Darkness cares for his own,  makes
</p>
<p>them 'angels' in his torrid country. In our country we honor
</p>
<p>them in monumental stone, and send them, in 'bronze,' to teach
</p>
<p>foreign nations,  especially Russia,  how to obtain and pre-
</p>
<p>serve Liberty i " '
</p>
<p>Again I reminded the Blade ;
</p>
<p>History does not state these "facts" as you do.
</p>
<p>The Blade flashed back :
</p>
<p>"History dhn't have to tell the truth; I wish it did; it would
</p>
<p>prevent an enormous waste of sentiment in this countrj^ Much
</p>
<p>of this sentiment is so ignorant, hysterical, blind, that it often
</p>
<p>antagonizes truth. Some of us remember its suppressing books
</p>
<p>because they contained the truth, or even a truthful quotation.
</p>
<p>Why was Lam on 's 'Life of Lincoln' so suppressed?
</p>
<p>"Dr. A. T. Bledsoe noticed it at length in the old Southern

<p>Quaricrhi Review. Was its truth its crime?
</p>
<p>"Ward H. Lamon knew Lincoln, was his law partner. Lin-
</p>
<p>coln made him a colonel in the 'Secret Service,' and he was
</p>
<p>active in the events I am noting. Evidently Lincoln trusted
</p>
<p>Lamon; used Lamon. Why, and by whom, was Lamon 'sup-
</p>
<p>pressed '  later ?
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>"When Mr. Davis, Mr, Stephens, Generals 'Dick' Taylor,
</p>
<p>Dabney Maury, Admiral Semmes and others wrote defenses of
</p>
<p>the South, many vital, illuminating facts were not available.
</p>
<p>They charged deceit and treachery ; but it w'as denied, scoffiugly.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Stephens weakened his charges by making personal ex-
</p>
<p>cuses for Lincoln. My Bible teaches that the personal accom-
</p>
<p>plishments of the fallen Lucifer enable him to lead us to the
</p>
<p>regions below. A man's liberty is very like his religion, both
</p>
<p>free to all; but only at the price of 'Eternal vigilance.'
</p>
<p>"The truth must be preserved by constant care. Falsehood
</p>
<p>fattens on the public common.
</p>
<p>"I repeat, the United States Government committed an act of
</p>
<p>war within eight days after Lincoln was inaugurated, with ap-
</p>
<p>proval of Lincoln; and, this same day, Lincoln, personally, com-
</p>
<p>mitted an act clearly demonstrating his intent and purpose to
</p>
<p>bring on war.
</p>
<p>"Bear in mind that Captain Vogdes, U. S. Araiy, was sent
</p>
<p>with an armed force, on the U. S. S. Brooklyn, to reinforce Fort
</p>
<p>Pickens, in January 1861; but was estopped by the 'armistice'
</p>
<p>of January 29th, at Pensacola bar; and that this armed force
</p>
<p>remained there, under Captain Vogdes, on the Brooklyn.
</p>
<p>"As soon as Lincoln became President and Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Chief, these facts became known to him, officially ; and the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing order was sent to violate the eristing armistice, reinforce
</p>
<p>Fort Pickens, and inaugurate icar. It is well known that Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Scott was opposed to war; but he obeyed the Commander-
</p>
<p>-in-Chief, Abraham Lincoln. I quote the record.

<p>"This order was sent by U, S. S. Crusader, and received by

<p>11
</p>
<p>Captain Vogdes, off Pensacola, on Marcli 31st, 1861. The next
</p>
<p>morning he sent to Captain H. A. Adams, the following:

</p>
<p>"Sir:
</p>
<p>(D) Herewith 1 send yon a copy of an order received by me last

<p>night. You will see by it that I am directed to land my com-

<p>that you will place at my disposal such boats and otlier means as

</p>
<p>To Captain H. A. Adams,
</p>
<p>Commanding Naval Forces off' Pensacola."
</p>
<p>"Captain Adams averted open war on April 1st 1S61, by re-
</p>
<p>fusing to obey this order.
</p>
<p>' ' In his ' Report ' to the Secretary of the Navy, Captain Adams
</p>
<p>says:
</p>
<p>(E) "It would be considered not only a declaration but an act of
</p>
<p>war; and would be resisted to the utmost.
</p>
<p>"Both sides are faithfully observing tlie agreement (armis-
</p>
<p>tice) entered into by the United States Government and Mr.
</p>
<p>Mallory and Colonel Chase, which binds us not to reinforce Fort
</p>
<p>Pickens unless it shall be attacked or threatened. It binds them
</p>
<p>not to attack it unless we should attempt to reinforce it."
</p>
<p>Upon receipt of this precise "Report" from Captain Adams,
</p>
<p>tlie Secretary of the Navy, regardless of the existing armistice,
</p>
<p>sent the following, (note its secrecy) :

<p>Secty. of the Navy.

<p>To Captain H. A. Adams,
</p>
<p>Commanding Naval Forces off Pensacola."
</p>
<p>(G) "This order was sent by a special messenger, Lieut. J, L.
</p>
<p>Worden, U. S N. "Worden went by rail, via Richmond, Augusta,
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>Atlanta (Georgia) ; when near Atlanta he became alarmed from
</p>
<p>some cause, and he opened the dispatches, committed them to
</p>
<p>memory; then 'destroyed them'; (the act of a spy.) He arrived
</p>
<p>at Pensacola at 'midnight, April 10th.'
</p>
<p>"On 11th of April Worden saw General Bragg, and assured
</p>
<p>General Bragg that he 'only had a verbal message of a pacific
</p>
<p>nature for Captain Adams.'
</p>
<p>"The Lieutenant was allowed to go out to Captain Adams,
</p>
<p>under this 'pacific' assurance, and the existing 'armistice.'
</p>
<p>" 'Eough weather' prevented Worden from reacliing Captain
</p>
<p>Adams on the 11th. (It also prevented open war on April 11th,
</p>
<p>1861, by delaying Worden.)
</p>
<p>"On April 12th Worden delivered, 'verbally, from memory,'
</p>
<p>the order to reinforce Fort Pickens.
</p>
<p>"Worden returned to Pensacola about 5:30 P. M., April 12th.
</p>
<p>He avoided seeing General Bragg and boarded a train for Mont-
</p>
<p>gomery, en route back to Washington.
</p>
<p>(J) " Worden 's actions aroused suspicion, and he was followed
</p>
<p>and arrested next morning at Montgomery. By some means he
</p>
<p>escaped a spy's fate and was held 'as a prisoner of war.'
</p>
<p>"About a year later Worden commanded the iron clad 'Mon-
</p>
<p>itor' in her fight wnth the C. S. S. Virginia (Merrimac.)
</p>
<p>(K) "To avoid a spy's fate Worden made a 'statement,' April
</p>
<p>]6th, 1861 to L. P. Walker, Confederate States Secretary of
</p>
<p>War.
</p>
<p>(H) "On April 14th General Bragg reported his experience witli
</p>
<p>Worden.
</p>
<p>(G) "It was not until four years later, September, 1865, (when
</p>
<p>the war was over, and the spy safe) that Worden reported these
</p>
<p>facts to the U. S. Navy Department. This report proves his
</p>
<p>'statement' to Secretary Walker to have been a tissue of lies.
</p>
<p>(L) "Captain Adams reported having landed Vogdes, and rein-
</p>
<p>forced Fort Pickens, on April IIWi; but, the fact is, that Vogdes,
</p>
<p>impatient of delay, actually landed a part of his armed force
</p>
<p>and reinforced Fort Fickens after '9 F. M.' on the night of

<p>April nth, lS6t.' Here is my authority:
</p>
<p>(M) "April 11th at 9 P. M. the Brooklyn got under way and
</p>
<p>fetood in toward the harbor ; and during the night landed troops
</p>
<p>and marines on board, to reinforce Fort Pickens.'
</p>
<p>"That is from the official 'Log' of a U. S. Ship of War, as
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>reported to, and filed in, the V. S. Navy Department. It con-
</p>
<p>firms Vogdes' statement at Fort Adams.
</p>
<p>"Captain Adams averted open war by refusing to obey orders
</p>
<p>twelve days before 'Fort Sumter was fired on.'
</p>
<p>''Captain Vogdes committeed an act of war, at Fort Pickens,
</p>
<p>the night before ' Sumter .was fired on. '
</p>
<p>"The instant that order was issued, March 12th, 1861, War
</p>
<p>was inaugurated, just one month before 'Sumter was fired on.'
</p>
<p>"The instant a military order is issued the whole power of
</p>
<p>the Government enforces it.
</p>
<p>"The intent was to use this power to force the South to sub-
</p>
<p>mit to Lincoln's uneonstitutional theories and acts, (confessed
</p>
<p>so, by Lincoln himself; and, held so, by Congress) or, defend our
</p>
<p>rights.
</p>
<p>"That order inaugurated war inevitably. A sense of honor
</p>
<p>in a naval officer averted open war twelve days before 'Sumter'
</p>
<p>was summoned to surrender. For this, this officer w^as officially
</p>
<p>reproved, and a special, secret, 'confidential' order was sent to
</p>
<p>him by a spy messenger, to obey the original order, (of March
</p>
<p>12th, 1861), 'that object being the wish and intention.'
</p>
<p>"This shows that on March 12th, 1861, when that order was
</p>
<p>issued, it was the 'wish and intention' of the U. S. Government
</p>
<p>to begin war.
</p>
<p>"There is no possible escape from this.
</p>
<p>"The official record proves it.
</p>
<p>"In addition to this, Captain Adams obeyed the secret spy's
</p>
<p>orders, and inaugurated open war at Fort Pickens, on April
</p>
<p>12th, 1861, the same day that 'Sumter was fired on' five hundred
</p>
<p>miles away; and it ivas more than a iveek hefore it was known at
</p>
<p>either Fort ivhat had occurred at the other. The treacherous
</p>
<p>collusion was secretly held in Abraham Lincoln's 'yearning'
</p>
<p>mind."
</p>
<p>The Blade paused, and I interposed :
</p>
<p>Do you mean that all this was done secretly, while the Con-
</p>
<p>federate Peace Commission was kept waiting? (being deceived

<p>by Seward and Lincoln.)
</p>
<p>(N) Why, Seward assured them, through Judge Campbell, on
</p>
<p>March 15th, that "Sumter will be evacuated in ten days;" and,
</p>
<p>there "is no intent to reinforce Fort Sumter." This assurance
</p>
<p>was repeated on March 20th; Seward pleading for time and
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>alleging that certain men were urging the Government to use
</p>
<p>force ; and that time was necessary to enable the Government to
</p>
<p>overcome this demand for force, and make a peaceable settle-
</p>
<p>ment. Seward also assured Judge Campbell "as to Fort Pick-
</p>
<p>ens, he, (Judge Campbell), should h^ve notice of any design to
</p>
<p>alter the existing status there."
</p>
<p>I am quoting Judges John A. Campbell, and Samuel Nelson,
</p>
<p>of the U. S. Supreme Court, who were both present at all these
</p>
<p>interviews; and, whose veracity, unlike Seward's, has never
</p>
<p>been questioned.
</p>
<p>You know the Confederate States Peace Commissioners pre-
</p>
<p>sented their request on March 12th, 1861 ; the very day you say
</p>
<p>the order was sent to "reinforce Fort Pickens."
</p>
<p>The Blade pressed in.
</p>
<p>(0) "Yes; and on that same day, Mar. 12th, 1861, (through one
</p>
<p>of his Cabinet, Montgomery Blair), telegraphed to Blair's kins-
</p>
<p>man, G V. Fox, to come to Washington to arrange for an expe-
</p>
<p>dition to reinforce Fort Sumter.
</p>
<p>"These facts prove two other facts.
</p>
<p>"First: That the South was diligently using every means pos-
</p>
<p>sible to preserve and establish peace; and used no treacheiy.
</p>
<p>"Second: That the United States Government, and Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln, deceived the people; deceived Congress, deceived the
</p>
<p>Confederate States Commissioners, by hypocritical 'yearnings,'
</p>
<p>and 'private,' 'confidential' and secret official acts, all done to
</p>
<p>insure Lincoln 's scheme to force war on the South.
</p>
<p>"On March 15th, 1861, Senator Stephen A. Douglas intro-
</p>
<p>duced a Resolution in the U. S. Senate 'To withdraw all U. S.
</p>
<p>forces from the forts in the seceded states, except at Key West
</p>
<p>and Tortugus' (which were isolated, and really international
</p>
<p>in scope.)
</p>
<p>"Mr. Douglas also made a strong plea for peace and justice;
</p>
<p>and he clearly defined the limit of the President's powers.
</p>
<p>"Senators Clinghara and Breckenridge introduced like Res-
</p>
<p>olutions; but the Senate adjourned March 28th, without action

</p>
<p>on either Resolution.
</p>
<p>"Does any man believe this Senate would have 'adjourned' if
</p>
<p>it had even suspicioned Lincoln's secret treachery? The Sen-
</p>
<p>ate was deceived by the hypocrisy of the conspirators, led by
</p>
<p>Lincoln and Seward.
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>"Of this action and its effect Mr. Stephens says (Vol. II, 354) :
</p>
<p>" 'But the understanding in the city (Washington), at the
</p>
<p>time of Mr Douglas' speech, and the time the assurance was
</p>
<p>given to the Confederate States Commissioners was, that Fort
</p>
<p>Sumter was to be immediately evacuated.
</p>
<p>" 'This intelligence was telegraphed throughout the country
</p>
<p>on the 14th of March ; the second day after the date of the Con-
</p>
<p>federate States Commissioners' note to Mr, Seward, and the day
</p>
<p>before the first meeting Mr. Seward had with Judge Campbell.
</p>
<p>I have little doubt, therefore, that, at that time, Mr. Lincoln had
</p>
<p>decided to withdraw all United States forces from the limits of
</p>
<p>the Confederate States.'
</p>
<p> "No man believes that General Scott ordered Captain Vogdes
</p>
<p>to commit an act of war without the order or the approval of
</p>
<p>the Commander-in-Chief, Abraham Lincoln; for, it was known
</p>
<p>that General Scott was opposed to war, and advised against it.
</p>
<p>(Jeneral Scott's words were: 'Let the wayward sisters go in
</p>
<p>peace.'
</p>
<p>' ' That order emanated from Abraham Lincoln. No other power
</p>
<p>could have forced it. General Scott obeyed orders.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Stephens wrote in ignorance of the fact that Lincoln
</p>
<p>had secretly committed an act of war the very day the Con-
</p>
<p>federate Peace Commissioners presented their peace proposal,
</p>
<p>March 12th, 1861, a week after Lincoln was inaugurated, and
</p>
<p>three days before Mr. Douglas introduced his Resolution.
</p>
<p>"Another fact is here established; that the first move by each
</p>
<p>party was on March 12th, 1861. The South comes for peace,
</p>
<p>openly ; and Lincoln comes with a war order,  in secret !
</p>
<p>"Had Lincoln died a natural death, that 'cunning which was
</p>
<p>genius,' would have destroyed the evidence of his 'secret,' 'pri-
</p>
<p>vate,' 'confidential,' treacherous acts of war, which he covered
</p>
<p>up by complaining of his soul being 'burdened,' and his heart
</p>
<p>'yearning for peace and union,' while he secretly, viciously, re-
</p>
<p>morselessly inaugurated the war against the South !

<p>says pointedly, that the object of his 'plans' was 'the reinforc-
</p>
<p>ing of Fort Sumter.' In his detailed statement (1865) he says
</p>
<p>On February 6th, (1861) I met, by arrangement (at Army
</p>
<p>Headquarters) Lieutenant Norman J. Hall, who had been sent
</p>
<p>from Fort Sumter by Major Anderson' and 'we discussed the
</p>
<p>question of relieving Fort Sumter. 'Lieutenant Hall's plan'
</p>
<p>was discussed. So, Hall, whom Anderson 'sent,' had a plan.
</p>
<p>(R) On Mar 8th, 1861, Fox writes to General Scott: 'Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Hall and myself have had several free conferences; and, if he
</p>
<p>is permitted by South Carolina authorities to re-enter Fort
</p>
<p>Sumter, Major Anderson will comprehend the 'plan' for his
</p>
<p>relief. '
</p>
<p>"This can only mean that Anderson was in collusion with
</p>
<p>Fox, Hall, Blair, Lincoln and others in their 'plans' to 'rein-
</p>
<p>force Sumter' and inaugurate war; for 'Hall' was 'sent hy Maj.
</p>
<p>Anderson.' and met and conferred with Fox 'by arrangement ;'
</p>
<p>and was intending, if 'permitted,' to 're-enter Fort Sumter,'
</p>
<p>and naturally report to Maj. Anderson who would 'comprehend,
</p>
<p>the plan' to 're-enforce and relieve Fort Sumter.'
</p>
<p>(S) "Remember that Maj. Anderson commanded Fort Moultrie
</p>
<p>with its garrison when South Carolina seceded December 20th,
</p>
<p>1860. On December 26th, the country was electrified by the
</p>
<p>news that 'during the previous night, Major Anderson had
</p>
<p>dismantled Fort Moultrie, spiked his guns, burned his gun car-
</p>
<p>riages, and removed his command to Fort Sumter.'
</p>
<p>"Up to that time South Carolina had not seized a fort. This
</p>
<p>action violated the agreement not to change the existing militray
</p>
<p>status; and South Carolina at once took possession of the other
</p>
<p>forts and defences.
</p>
<p>"Anderson was now scheming witli Fox, Blair, Hall, and

<p>Lincoln on a 'plan' to reinforce Sumter.
</p>
<p>Every one of them knew it meant war. Not a word, not an
</p>
<p>act, in the whole 'phnis' could be twisted into a 'yearning for
</p>
<p>peace and union.'
</p>
<p>(0) "G. Y. Fox arrived at Wa.shington on 'Mar. 13th' and had
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>several interviews with Lincoln, Blair, and General Scott. It
</p>
<p>appears that General Scott still opposed any forcing of war.
</p>
<p>''On March 19th Fox at his own suggestion, was sent to Fort
</p>
<p>Sumter where he had an interview with Major Anderson the
</p>
<p>21st, and arranged for Anderson to hold out until 'April 15th.'
</p>
<p>Fox then returned to Washington, made his report, and the
</p>
<p>expedition took shape. So that Fox was simply Lincoln's spy
</p>
<p>and his arrangement with Anderson (which Fox denies, but
</p>
<p>facts sustain) was, and was intended to be, a 'reinforcement.'
</p>
<p>"The U. S. Senate was in 'executive session;' but no mention
</p>
<p>of these secret matters was made to this Senate (or any other),
</p>
<p>by Lincoln. Postmaster General Blair was the active supporter
</p>
<p>of the Lincoln-Fox war expedition.
</p>
<p>"Montgomery Blair w'as a West Point graduate, and ex-offi-
</p>
<p>cer of the U. S. Army, who left the service to practice law. He
</p>
<p>was counsel for Dred Scott in the noted case before the U. S.
</p>
<p>Supreme Court ; and was now urging the Fox ' expedition, '
</p>
<p>knowing it meant W'ar.
</p>
<p>"On March 28th the Senate adjourned. The next day Lin-
</p>
<p>coln began to act, and sent the following order to the Secretary
</p>
<p>of the Navy :
</p>
<p>"Executive Mansion,
</p>
<p>March 29th, 1861.
</p>
<p>"Sir:
</p>
<p>(T) I desire that an expedition, to move by sea be got r3ady to

<p>sail as early as the 6th of April next, the whole according to

</p>
<p>tary of War for that object.

<p>Your obedient servant,

</p>
<p>"The memorandum attached called for^  from the Navy 
</p>
<p>three ships of war. The Pocahontas, the Pawnee, and the Har-

</p>
<p>(0) " On Mar. 30th Lincoln sent G. V. Fox to New York to pre-
</p>
<p>pare transports, etc., for the Fort Sumter expedition; and the
</p>
<p>(V) Secretary of the Navy issued orders, marked 'private' for
</p>
<p>the three ships of war, named by Lincoln, to be ready by April
</p>
<p>6th."

</p>
<p>Again I questioned the Blade :
</p>
<p>(N) Have you forgotten that on Saturday, March 30th, Judge
</p>
<p>Campbell, who was the intermediary selected by Secretary Sew-
</p>
<p>ard to communicate between Lincoln, Seward and the Confed-
</p>
<p>erate States Commissioners, saw Mr. Seward about a telegram
</p>
<p>from Governor Pickens (of South Carolina), making inquiries
</p>
<p>as to rumors about Fort Sumter; and that Seward reassured
</p>
<p>Judge Campbell, and promised "a satisfactory answer to the
</p>
<p>Governor's telegram by next Monday, April 1st?"
</p>
<p>This telegram from Governor Pickens inquired concerning
</p>
<p>Colonel Lamon, who was in Charleston, "ostensibly to arrange
</p>
<p>the proposed evacuation of Fort Sumter."
</p>
<p>On Monda}^, April 1st, Mr. Seward stated to Judge Campbell,
</p>
<p>"The President may desire to supply Fort Sumter but will not
</p>
<p>do so ; " and added, ' ' There is no design to reinforce Fort Sum-
</p>
<p>ter."
</p>
<p>Do you mean to say that in the face of these official, peaceful
</p>
<p>assurances, which held the Confederates Commission waiting;
</p>
<p>that these war expeditions were secretly ordered, and organized
</p>
<p>by Lincoln and Seward, to reinforce Fort Pickens and Fort Sum-
</p>
<p>ter? Why that was actual, active war!
</p>
<p>The Blade responded pointedly :
</p>
<p>"Yes! I mean to say that; and more. Remember that Sew-
</p>
<p>ard and Shouler both clearly state that Lincoln was privy to all
</p>
<p>of Seward's actions. April 1st, 1861, was a very red letter day
</p>
<p>for what Seward described as that 'cunning which was genius'
</p>
<p>in Abraham Lincoln,
</p>
<p>The following order by General Scott varies the usual military
</p>
<p>form so as to place the responsibility on higher authority. The
</p>
<p>first sentence clearly indicates this to any one conversant with
</p>
<p>military affairs. Lincoln's written approval fastens the fact.

</p>
<p>Approved April 2iid, 1861.
</p>
<p>"(Signed) ABRAHAM LINCOLN."
</p>
<p>"Evidently General Scott required Lincoln's written author-
</p>
<p>ity before committing this act of war.
</p>
<p>"Lincoln, to insure the intent of this 'order,' issued a special
</p>
<p>order, as follows :
</p>
<p>(Enclosure) "Executive Mansion,
</p>
<p>Washington, April 1st, 1861.
</p>
<p>(X) "All officers of the Army and Navy, to whom this order may
</p>
<p>be exhibited will aid by every means in their power the expedi-
</p>
<p>tion under the command of Colonel Brown; supply him with
</p>
<p>men and material; and co-operating with him as he may desire.
</p>
<p>(Signed) ABRAHAM LINCOLN."
</p>
<p>The Blade paused and I remarked :
</p>
<p>You have cited two expeditions to "reinforce Fort Pickens" 
</p>
<p>Vogdes, and Brown; and the Fox expedition to "reinforce Fort
</p>
<p>Sumter."
</p>
<p>(N) Yet, that same day, Apr. 1st, 1861, Seward had solemnlyas-
</p>
<p>sured Judge Campbell that he should have notice of any design
</p>
<p>to change the "existing status at Fort Pickens" and reasserted
</p>
<p>there was "no design to reinforce Fort Sumter."
</p>
<p>The Blade resumed :
</p>
<p>"Well, Seward had his part in the Lincoln scheme and played
</p>
<p>it; just as Chase did in the Peace Congress. It was all in keep-
</p>
<p>ing with Lincoln's creed and practice.
</p>
<p>"In 1848 Lincoln was an avowed 'Revolutionist.' In 1858,
</p>
<p>after seventy years of phenomenal growth and prosperity, he
</p>
<p>declared 'this government cannot continue to exist lialf slave
</p>
<p>and half free."
</p>
<p>"That was a good anti-constitutional 'Revolutionist' text.
</p>
<p>"In December, 1860, Senator Douglas introduced in the U.
</p>
<p>S. Senate a measure to protect the states in their constitutional
</p>
<p>rights ; and to punish those guilty of inter-state insurrection or
</p>
<p>invasions such as John Brown's Harper's Ferry murder and

</p>
<p>arson raid.
</p>
<p>"In a speech at Cooper Union, New York, Lincoln denounced
</p>
<p>this Douglas Resolution, or measure, as a 'Sedition Bill.' Was
</p>
<p>not that protecting and defending John Brown's 'raid' of arson
</p>
<p>and murder; and such like crimes against society and govern-
</p>
<p>ment? If so, how Mdll you designate such a character?
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>"Fort Sumter will be supplied, peaceably if allowed, forcibly
</p>
<p>"Considered as an incident, (Lincoln being elected but not
</p>
<p>yet inaugurated), it suggests that perhaps such a measure as
</p>
<p>Senator Douglas introduced would have hampered Lincoln's
</p>
<p>secret designs.
</p>
<p>"I have alluded to the public announcement by S. P. Chase,
</p>
<p>Lincoln's avowed^jgpokesman, in the 'Peace Congress' in 1861;
</p>
<p>thirty days before Lincoln was inaugurated,
</p>
<p>(xx) "That was the most open, direct, defiant, disunion speech
</p>
<p>ever made by a representative of any party in the United States,
</p>
<p>to that date, outside of New England. Radicals, like Thad
</p>
<p>Stevens, paralleled it later.
</p>
<p>"It asserted, unequivocally, that the election of 1860 empow-
</p>
<p>ered Lincoln's 'party' to enforce their political theories on the
</p>
<p>country, regardless of the Constitution, the laws, the rights of
</p>
<p>the states, or the decisions of the Supreme Court; and that Lin-
</p>
<p>coln would do so.
</p>
<p>"And he did.
</p>
<p>(Y) "Five days before Lincoln was inaugurated Congress passed
</p>
<p>a Resolution pronouncing the practice of political theories (as
</p>
<p>promulgated by S. P. Chase and several Northern states), to be
</p>
<p>violations of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>"The new Congress (elected in 1860), was more favorable to
</p>
<p>the constitution being upheld than was the outgoing Congress,
</p>
<p>which passed the Resolutio^i cited; and knowing this, Lincoln
</p>
<p>did not convene this Congress until war was actually assured."
</p>
<p>T questioned the Blade :
</p>
<p>"That being true, as you state, w^hat of Lincoln's 'yearning
</p>
<p>for peace and union,' which so 'burdened his soul?' You would
</p>
<p>put him in the class with John Brown.
</p>
<p>After a moment the Blade answered :
</p>
<p>"I have no desire to insult John Brown. I am citing facts,
</p>
<p>in the interest of justice and truth. If these facts indicate that
</p>
<p>Lincoln was an enlarged edition of the Harper's Ferry anarch-
</p>
<p>ist, these same facts make the inference to result from Lincoln's

<p>own actions.
</p>
<p>"If Lincoln 'yearned' for peace, why did he refuse to even
</p>
<p>discuss peace with the Peace Commissioners who were there in
</p>
<p>Washington, deceived and waiting?
</p>
<p>"If 'peace and union burdened' his soul, why did he not con-
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>vene Congress to assume the 'burden' of peace, or war, as the
</p>
<p>Constitution required 1
</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten Lincoln's attack on the Virginia Con.
</p>
<p>vention ? This Sovereign Convention met at Richmond Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary 13th, 1861. It voted down several secession resolutions
</p>
<p>about three to one. It was for the Constitutional Union.
</p>
<p>(Z) "This Convention remained in session waiting impatiently
</p>
<p>for Lincoln to put into actual practice his avowed 'peace and
</p>
<p>unon' intent and purpose; but this Convention was also on
</p>
<p>guard ; ready to protect Virginia from any unconstitutional acts.
</p>
<p>Lincoln's consciousness of his own secret perfidy made him fear
</p>
<p>this Convention ; and he attempted to have it dissolved, so as to
</p>
<p>leave Virginia open to his schemes, a la Maryland.
</p>
<p>"On April 2nd, 1861, the very day he had approved a secret
</p>
<p>act of war, i. e., to 'reinforce Fort Pickens,' Lincoln and Seward
</p>
<p>selected  as Lincoln's confidential messenger  a gentleman, a
</p>
<p>Virginian, a constitutional union man, then practicing law in
</p>
<p>Washington ; and at that time Judge Advocate of the U,
</p>
<p>S. Naval Court Martial. This was Allan B. Magruder.
</p>
<p>"Lincoln instructed Magruder to go to Richmond, see Judge
</p>
<p>George W. Summers (a leading union member of the Virginia
</p>
<p>Convention, one of the five delegates to the 'Peace Congress')
</p>
<p>and urge Summers to 'come to Washington, at once, by next
</p>
<p>Friday' to confer with Lincoln on 'matters of great import-
</p>
<p>ance,' and if Summers could not come, then for Summers to
</p>
<p>'select a union man to come.'
</p>
<p>"Magruder went to Richmond that night (Tuesday, April
</p>
<p>2nd). He saw Judge Summers, who, being unable to leave Rich-
</p>
<p>mond, consulted other union men, and they selected and sent
</p>
<p>John B. Baldwin, a fellow member, union man, to 'confer with
</p>
<p>Lincoln.'
</p>
<p>"Baldwin was in secret conference with Lincoln, Thursday
</p>
<p>morning, April 4th. Baldwin advised, urged Lincoln to call a
</p>
<p>conference of the states, and to issue a 'peaceful union proclama-
</p>
<p>tion,' giving official assurance of what Lincoln had so broadly

<p>preached of 'j'^earning for peace.'
</p>
<p>"Lincoln said, 'I fear you are too late.' Lincoln knew he
</p>
<p>then had four secret war expeditions moving.
</p>
<p>"Lincoln appealed to Baldwin:
</p>
<p>'Why don't you adjourn the convention? Yes, I mean sine
</p>
<p>die. It is a standing menace to me.'
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>''Lincoln was afraid of that convention.
</p>
<p>"Baldwin refused to have the convention 'adjourned,' and
</p>
<p>warned Lincoln: 'If a gun is fired, Virginia will secede in 48
</p>
<p>hours. '
</p>
<p>"Baldwin could get no assurance from Lincoln, whose object
</p>
<p>was to 'adjourn' that convention.
</p>
<p>"As Baldwin left, he met, and spoke to, 'Seven Governors'
</p>
<p>waiting in Lincoln's rooms.
</p>
<p>"This is the only authentic statement I have seen of these
</p>
<p>mysterious 'Seven Governors' who wei'e credited willi urging
</p>
<p>Lincoln to 'use force.'
</p>
<p>"Lincoln had made the war inevitable, before this meeting.
</p>
<p>"Ten days later, after three of Lincoln's secret and treacher-
</p>
<p>ous acts had culminated in open war, this collosal 'yearning' hyp-
</p>
<p>ocrit 'proclaimed' war, and gave as his excuse that the South
</p>
<p>fired on Fort Sumter. He also called Congress to meet in special
</p>
<p>session; but 'cunningly' postponed its assembling eighty days
</p>
<p>to July 4th, 1861.
</p>
<p>"He could have convened Congress in ten days. He did "con-
</p>
<p>vene' an army at Washington, in less than ten days. To com-
</p>
<p>vene Congress in ten days would have hampered Lincoln's
</p>
<p>schemes.
</p>
<p>"That Virginia Convention had not 'adjourned,' and that
</p>
<p>union convention voted to secede, 88 to 55, ' within 48 hours, ' as
</p>
<p>Col. Baldwin had warned ; Baldwin and Summers both voting
</p>
<p>for secession.

<p>I commented again :
</p>
<p>Why, fhe official notice sent to Governor Pickens was that
</p>
<p>"Fort Sumter will be supplied, peaceably if allowed, forcibly
</p>
<p>if necessary." These are orders to "reinforce Fort Sumter."
</p>
<p>You are questioning the truth of this official notice.
</p>
<p>"Exactly that," responded the Blade.
</p>
<p>The Blade mused a moment, then continued :
</p>
<p>"There is more yet of April 1st. Having three 'expeditions'
</p>
<p>under way to ' reinforce ' Forts Pickens and Sumter, each an act
</p>
<p>of war, Lincoln decided to send a fourth expedition, to hasten,
</p>
<p>and insure war, by a direct and violent use of force.
</p>
<p>"This expedition he planned and organized personally. In it
</p>
<p>he deceived his Secretary of the Navy ! and kept the "War De-

<p>was over.

<p>"For this expedition Lincoln selected Lieutenant D. D. Por-

</p>
<p>(3) You will fit out the Powhatan without delay. Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Porter will relieve Captain Mercer in command of her. She is

<p>bound on secret service; and you will under no circumstances
</p>
<p>communicate to the Navy Department the fact that she is fitting

<p>out.

<p>(14) "The Powhatan had just made the run Havana to New
</p>
<p>York in five days. She could probably make New York to Pen.
</p>
<p>sacola in the same time.
</p>
<p>"The signatures of these conspirators to these orders brands
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln's 'yearnings' as hypocritical whinings; his
</p>
<p>inaugural assurances, ' The Government will not assail you, ' and
</p>
<p>his statements to A. B. Magruder and John B. Baldwin as ex-
</p>
<p>actly characteristic.
</p>
<p>"It brands every statement of his henchmen and co-conspira-
</p>
<p>tor, Seward, to which Lincoln was privy, as deliberate, willful,
</p>
<p>malicious, conspiring treachery.

<p>' ' On this same day, April 1st, the Secretary of the Navy, being
</p>
<p>ignorant of Lincoln's secret orders to Powhatan, added the Pow-
</p>

</p>

<p>Porter answered, as follows:
</p>
<p>"April 6th, 1861.
</p>
<p>(8) "I received my orders from the President, and shall proceed
</p>
<p>and exef'ute them.
</p>
<p>(Signed) D. D. PORTER
</p>
<p>To Hon. Wm. H. Seward."
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>"Before sailing on 6th, Lieutenant Porter instructed the Navy-
</p>
<p>Yard officials, 'Detain all letters for five days.'
</p>
<p>"He evidently expected to reacTi his destination by 'April
</p>
<p>11th.'
</p>
<p>" 'Storms' and 'defective boilers' delayed the Powhatan, and
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Porter did not reach Pensacola at the expected time.
</p>
<p>When he arrived he had the Powhatan 'disguised' and 'flying
</p>
<p>English colors.' Being ignorant of events at Fort Pickens (and
</p>
<p>Sumter) he headed direct for the channel, to force an entrance
</p>
<p>to 'Pensacola harbor.' Here is what Porter himself says, in his
</p>
<p>Report :
</p>
<p>do) " 'I had disguised the ship, so that she deceived those who
</p>
<p>had known her, and was standing in (unnoticed), when the
</p>
<p>Wyandotte commenced making signals, which I did not answer,
</p>
<p>but stood on.
</p>
<p>The steamer then put herself in my way and Captain Meigs,
</p>
<p>who was aboard, hailed me and I stopped.
</p>
<p>In twenty minutes more I should have been inside (Pensacola
</p>
<p>harbor) or sunk.
</p>
<p>(Signed) D. D. PORTER, U. S. Navy."
</p>
<p>"This action, itself, was eloquent of the design, purpose, of
</p>
<p>Lincoln's secret, specific 'orders' to Lieutenant Porter dated
</p>
<p>April 1st, 1861, to force war!
</p>
<p>"Lincoln's 'cunning which was genius' was exemplified in
</p>
<p>tlie fact that he had four 'expeditions' at the same time, to force
</p>
<p>w^ar, at points five hundred miles apart, and neither of the offi-
</p>
<p>cers in command of an 'expedition' knew of the existence, the
</p>
<p>object nor the destination of either of the others.
</p>
<p>"That these 'secret expeditions' seem to have been designed
</p>
<p>to culminate on 'the 11th instant" is a remarkably suggestive,
</p>
<p>if not indicative, coincidence.
</p>
<p>" 'Rough weather, 'gales,' 'storms,' 'defecetive boilers,' caus-
</p>
<p>ing delays; and Adams' refusal to obey orders, all combined to
</p>
<p>make a rather tangled web of 'Honest Abe's' secret treachery.
</p>
<p>But notwithstanding all these delays and misfits, the facts estab-

<p>lish that open war was averted on April 1st, 1861, by Captain
</p>
<p>Adams, who was reproved for it ; that this delayed act was ac-
</p>
<p>complished by Vogdes, on the niglif of April 11th, 1861; he fore
</p>
<p>Fort Sumter wa.^ 'fired on' (April 12th, 1861.)
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>'^Ilad Fort Sumter not existed, there would have been open
</p>
<p>war forced on the South, at Fort Pickens, on April 1st, 1861, if
</p>
<p>Captain Adams had obeyed positive 'orders.' That tvas the
</p>
<p>avowed Urish and intention.' "
</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, I commented :
</p>
<p>(12) I recall that Captain Barron of U. S. Navy, made a special
</p>
<p>report on the good faith being observed by both parties to the
</p>
<p>"armistice" existing at Pensacola; and that Captain Poor, U.
</p>
<p>S. Navy, reported that the Powhatan attempted to force an en-'
</p>
<p>trance to Pensacola harbor, (9) "flying English colors."
</p>
<p>(13) Also, that dispatches were captured, at Charleston, which
</p>
<p>divulged that Captain Fox acted the part of a spy, and so de-
</p>
<p>ceived Governor Pickens.
</p>
<p>It is strange that histories and biographies do not mention
</p>
<p>these facts.
</p>
<p>The Blade retorted :
</p>
<p>"Histories and biographies are very much like Lincoln, who
</p>
<p>was often made to say things to fit into the designs of a powerful
</p>
<p>political faction. His first inaugural address was so 'doctored.'
</p>
<p>When Lincoln read that 'Gettysburg Speech' he must have won-
</p>
<p>dered at his own eloquence; for he never voiced it (as printed.)
</p>
<p>"I am not guided by what histories and biographies may say;
</p>
<p>nor by the opinions of any friend, or foe, of Lincoln.
</p>
<p>"I credit Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,
</p>
<p>with knowing what his office required him to know, and he cer-
</p>
<p>tainly knew. That premise fixed, his own words, and acts, are
</p>
<p>his passport; 
</p>
<p>"This is, Coilantogle Ford!"
</p>
<p>"Lincoln fixed upon himself the responsibility for war, by
</p>
<p>telling only a part of the Truth.
</p>
<p>"It is significant, that he never convened Congress until July
</p>
<p>4th, 1861, months after he had the war actively inaugurated.
</p>
<p>In his message to this Congress, he acknowledged having com-
</p>
<p>mitted unconstitutional acts.
</p>
<p>"The flimsy sophisms by which he attempted to excuse his

<p>usurpations would not be allowed in any covirt. Any school
</p>
<p>debating club would ridicule such an argument.
</p>
<p>"Congress, dazed by war, inaugurated without its knowledge
</p>
<p>or consent, (as the constitution required), received his 'mes-
</p>
<p>sage' July 4th, 1861.
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>(i6) "On eTuly 10th, a joint Resolution was introduced in the U.
</p>
<p>S. Senate to legalize Lincoln's unconstitutional acts. The first
</p>
<p>sentence of this 'Joint Resolution' fixes its character.
</p>
<p>" Whereas, since the adjournment of Congress on the 4th day
</p>
<p>of March last, a formidable insurrection in certain states of this
</p>
<p>Union has arrayed itself in armed hostility to the government
</p>
<p>of the United States, constitutionally administered, etc'
</p>
<p>"It is evident from the facts cited in lliis paper (which were
</p>
<p>not available for years after this Resolution was penned), that
</p>
<p>there was no 'Government of the United States constitutionally
</p>
<p>administered,' in existence, at the time noted. There was un-
</p>
<p>constitutional 'armed hostility' secretly organized, and sent to
</p>
<p>invade the South, while the Southern Peace Commission was in
</p>
<p>Washington 'urging' peace; and deceived by assurances of
</p>
<p>'peaceful intent.'
</p>
<p>"The 'Joint Resolution' itself is based on Lincoln's acknoul-
</p>
<p>edgment that the 'Government' was not 'constitutionally admin-
</p>
<p>istered;' and the avowed object and intent of the 'Resolution'
</p>
<p>itself was to legalize the unconstitutional administration of the
</p>
<p>'Government of the LTnited States, by Abraham Lincoln, whose
</p>
<p>'oath' bound him to 'preserve, protect, and defend the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution of the United States.'
</p>
<p>"Had Abraham Lincoln kept his oath and 'preserved' the
</p>
<p>'Constitution,' the Union would have been 'preserved;' and
</p>
<p>there would have been no war.
</p>
<p>"No one knew this better than Abraham Lincoln, and his
</p>
<p>spokesman, S. P. Chase, whose defiant 'notice' I have cited.
</p>
<p>Lincoln made that 'notice' good; not his 'oath.'
</p>
<p>"The 'Joint Resolution' names the following six unconstitu-
</p>
<p>tional acts, as confessed by Lincoln :
</p>
<p>"He calls for 75,000 men, April 15th, 1861.
</p>
<p>"He proclaims a 'blockade,' April 19th, 1861.
</p>
<p>"He proclaims a second blockade, April 27th, 1861.
</p>
<p>"He authorizes a military officer to suspend Habeas Corpus in
</p>
<p>Maryland and Pennsylvania, April 27th, 1861.

<p>"He calls for 35,000 volunteers. May 3rd, 1861.
</p>
<p>"He authorizes a military officer to suspend Habeas Corpus in
</p>
<p>Florida, May 10th, 1861.

<p>"Here is the enacting clause of that 'Joint Resolution "

</p>
<p>*' 'Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
</p>
<p>of the United States in Congress assembled ; That all the extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary acts, proclamations, and orders hereinbefore mention-
</p>
<p>ed be and the same are hereby approved, and declared to be in
</p>
<p>all respects legal and valid, to the same, and with the same
</p>
<p>effect as if they had been issued and done under the previous
</p>
<p>express authority, and direction, of the Congress of the United
</p>
<p>States.'
</p>
<p>"In this enacting clause Congress itself brands Lincoln's acts
</p>
<p>as illegal, invalid, unconstitutional."
</p>
<p>Here, I interposed to say :
</p>
<p>There is no allusion in that ' ' Joint Resolution ' ' to the secret,
</p>
<p>unconstitutional "orders" and "expeditions" you have cited,
</p>
<p>and which inaugurated the war, months before this Congress
</p>
<p>was allowed to convene.
</p>
<p>Lincoln's confession begins with his "proclamation" April
</p>
<p>15th. He secretly inaugurated war March 12th. He had four
</p>
<p>seeret war "expeditions" before April 5th, 1861.
</p>
<p>Why did not Lincoln tell all the truth  to Congress?
</p>
<p>The Blade seemed astonished by my question :
</p>
<p>"Don't think Lincoln was a fool! He was a knave. He never
</p>
<p>told all the truth even 'part of the time.'
</p>
<p>"He was a 'joker,' and never knew all he told. That is wliy
</p>
<p>he was called 'Honest Abe.'
</p>
<p>"To have this 'Joint Resolution' adopted by Congress, all the
</p>
<p>influence of Lincoln, his Cabinet, and his 'party' was exerted,
</p>
<p>but, having no power to legalize ^rime. Congress refused.
</p>
<p>"The 'Joint Resolution' was never even acted on to this good
</p>
<p>day!
</p>
<p>"You may conjecture from this what would have happened
</p>
<p>if Senator Douglas had lived and been in his seat; or, if Lin-
</p>
<p>coln had told 'all the truth,' (the facts as here stated), to that
</p>
<p>Congress which was opposed to the Chase doctrines.
</p>
<p>"Impeachment was not, in either case, an improbability.

</p>
<p>"A citizen of Maryland was arrested and imprisoned in a
</p>
<p>military stronghold. The citizen sued out a writ of Habeas _
</p>
<p>Corpus.
</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>"Chief Justice, Roger B. Taney, of the U. S. Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>ordered the parties to appear before him at Baltimore.
</p>
<p>"The military officer refused to supply the court with a copy
</p>
<p>of the order of arrest; and refused to obey the writ. His ex-
</p>
<p>cuse was, that he was 'authorized by the President to suspend
</p>
<p>the writ of Habeas Corpus at his discj-etion,' and, that he 'sus-
</p>
<p>pends it in this case.'
</p>
<p>"Judge Taney proceeded to hear the case, ex parte, and ren-
</p>
<p>dered the court's decision.
</p>
<p>'He pronounced every phase of the proceedings to be uncon-
</p>
<p>stitutional, null and void. He denied the power of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent to suspend Habeas Corpus under any circumstances ; much
</p>
<p>lers the power to authorize a military officer to exercise it.
</p>
<p>"He ordered 'a copy' of this decision, under the seal of the
</p>
<p>United States Supreme Court, to be delivered, by a court mes-
</p>
<p>senger 'to the President of the United States.'
</p>
<p>"That was the most just and masterly rebuke ever delivered
</p>
<p>since Elijah denounced Ahab for crimes far less!
</p>
<p>"Remember, too, that Ahab also went 'softly, yearningly,' but
</p>
<p>that 'in his son's days,' God struck!
</p>
<p>"The venerable Chief Justice died during Lincoln's first term,
</p>
<p>and Lincoln appointed the constitution-defying Salmon P.
</p>
<p>Chase to succeed him.
</p>
<p>"It is pertinent to remember, that Senator Stephen A.
</p>
<p>Douglas had pointedly declared the limit of the President's
</p>
<p>powers ; and Douglas knew Lincoln. Had Mr. Douglas lived to
</p>
<p>meet with the Senate July 4th, 1861, it is almost a certainty that
</p>
<p>he would have begun impeachment proceedings ; but Mr. Douglas
</p>
<p>died June 3rd, 1861. The dying words of Mr. Douglas, to his
</p>
<p>sons were eloquent of his thought, his patriotism: 'Obey the
</p>
<p>law, and support the Constitution.'

<p>ing challenge in it.
</p>
<p>"No Southern statesman; no advocate of State's Rights; ever
</p>
<p>denounced the Constitution ; or tVie Constitutional Union ; or de-
</p>
<p>fied the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, in
</p>
<p>any speech, address, or party announcement, ever made.
</p>
<p>"No Southern state ever failed to comply, loyally, with her
</p>
<p>obligations to every other state, or to the United States, as pre-
</p>
<p>scribed, and required, by the Constitution of the United States.
</p>
<p>"I challenge refutation!"
</p>
<p>The Blade ceased.
</p>
<p>Do you wonder that I love the Blade for the dangers we have
</p>
<p>shared, and the un-afraid Truth that is in it ?
</p>
<p>Its "Challenge" stands!

</p>
<p>To those who may resent the thrusts of the Blade :
</p>
<p>I assert that the South did a lion's share to win the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can Revolution. This, my friends, is "our" country.
</p>
<p>We fought for it when blood was its price. We paid for its
</p>
<p>institutions w^hen gold was the price.
</p>
<p>B^ide the Blade, a brace of fine old pistols rest, bearing
</p>
<p>many scars of service in that Revolution. In virtue of one I
</p>
<p>can wear the "Eagle" of the Cincinnati; of the other the South-
</p>
<p>ern "Cross." One typifies victory for  the other suppression of
</p>
<p> the same principles and rights.
</p>
<p>Principles abide !
</p>
<p>Try and realize, my friends, that no individual is necessary to
</p>
<p>our security or our happiness ; and, that the most irritating bur-
</p>
<p>den to a proud people is injustice ; and that injustice to the right
</p>
<p> the patriotism of a courageous people  is to them the most
</p>
<p>hideous.
</p>
<p>When a jury of our peers consider the facts and so find one
</p>
<p>guilty  do we expect or hear denunciation of the facts, or the
</p>
<p>verdict ? Is not every good citizen earnest and diligent to sup-
</p>
<p>port justice and right?
</p>
<p>If this is true in our communities, our States, why not so feel,
</p>
<p>so act, in this greater matter?
</p>
<p>I may regret the necessity, but, neither I nor any lover of
</p>
<p>truth and justice should regret the result.
</p>
<p>If I know myself it has been in this broad view that I have
</p>
<p>seen  and labored to bring before my countrymen  the jury: 
</p>
<p>the facts set forth in this article ; and I appeal to you to so con-
</p>
<p>sider and so judge my work.
</p>
<p>So, there stands before you as true a "Traitor"  as loyal a
</p>
<p>"Rebel"  as ever descended from Revolutionary loins.

<p>JUDGE CAMPBELL'S LETTERS
</p>
<p>"Extracts."
</p>
<p>"Sunday Morning, April 7th, 1861.
</p>
<p>(13) "Memorandum.
</p>
<p>"The (Confederate Peace) Commissioners have been under
</p>
<p>anxiety and concern for two or three days by reports, that have
</p>
<p>some appearance of authority, of conversations. of the President
</p>
<p>relative to Southern affairs, troops, and by the sailing of the
</p>
<p>Atlantic*
</p>
<p>"I have assured them that the Government will not under-
</p>
<p>take to supply Sumter without giving notice to Governor Pick-
</p>
<p>ens, and that I should have notice whenever any measure chang-
</p>
<p>ing the existing status prejudicially to the Confederate States
</p>
<p>is contemplated as respects Fort Pickens.
</p>
<p>"I do not experience the same anxiety or concern as they
</p>
<p>express. But if I have said more than I am authorized I pray
</p>
<p>that you will advise me.
</p>
<p>JOHN A. CAMPBELL.
</p>
<p>This letter was addressed to Wm. H. Seward, Secretary of
</p>
<p>State. But this is left out in compiling the record, and, a sen-
</p>
<p>tence is added  from Judge Campbell's report to the Confeder-
</p>
<p>ate authorities as to this incident.
</p>
<p>Mr. Seward's ansicer to this letter is also suppressed. That
</p>
<p>answer was : ' ' Faith as to Sumter fully kept. Wait and see. ' '
</p>
<p>That answer was in writing.
</p>
<p>Why was Seward's name, as addressed, and Seward's answer
</p>
<p>left out of the record, and foreign matter inserted totally irrele-
</p>
<p>vant to the question at issue?
</p>
<p>Judge Campbell ivaited, and saw. Then wrote the following
</p>
<p>letter to Wm. H. Seward :
</p>
<p>"Washington City, Saturdav, April 13, 1861.
</p>
<p>"Sir:
</p>
<p>(N) "On the 15th of March, ultimo, I left with Judge Crawford,
</p>
<p>one of the Commissioners of the Confederate States, a note in
</p>
<p>\vriting to the effect following:

</p>
<p>" 'I feel entire confidence that Fort Sumter will be evacu-
</p>
<p>ated in the next ten days, and this measure is felt as imposing
</p>
<p>great responsibility on the Administration.
</p>
<p>" 'I feel entire confidence that no measure changing the exist-
</p>
<p>ing status prejudicially to the Southern Confederate States, is
</p>
<p>at present contemplated.
</p>
<p>* The "Atlanic" carried the secret esperlition under Brown nsainst Fort
</p>
<p>Piokens.
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>" 'I feel entire confidence that an immediate demand for an
</p>
<p>answer to the communication of the Commissioners will be pro-
</p>
<p>ductive of evil and not of good. I do not believe that it ought,
</p>
<p>at this time, to be pressed.'
</p>
<p>"The substance of this staement I communicated to you the
</p>
<p>same evening by letter. Five days elapsed and I called with a
</p>
<p>telegram from General Beauregard to the effect that Sumter
</p>
<p>was not evacuated, but that Major Anderson was at work making
</p>
<p>repairs.
</p>
<p>"The next day, after conversing with you, I communicated
</p>
<p>to Judge Crawford, in writing, that the failure to evacuate
</p>
<p>Sumter was not the result of bad faith, but was attributable to
</p>
<p>causes consistent with the intention to fulfill the engagement,
</p>
<p>and that, as regarded Pickens, I should have notice of any
</p>
<p>design to alter the existing status there.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Jvistice Nelson was present at these conversations, three
</p>
<p>in number, and I submitted to him each of my written com-
</p>
<p>munications to Judge Crawford, and informed Judge Crawford
</p>
<p>that they had his (Judge Nelson's) sanction. I gave you, on
</p>
<p>the 22nd of March, a substantial copy of the statement I had
</p>
<p>made on the 15th. '
</p>
<p>"The 30th of March arrived, and at that time a telegram
</p>
<p>came from Governor Pickens inquiring concerning Colonel
</p>
<p>Lamon, whose visit to Charleston he siipposed had a connection
</p>
<p>Avith the proposed evacuation of Fort Sumter. I left that with
</p>
<p>you, and was to have an answer the following Monday morning
</p>
<p>n.st of April. On the 1st of April I received from you the state-
</p>
<p>ment in writing : ' I am satisfied the Government will not under-
</p>
<p>take to supply Fort Sumter without giving notice to Governor
</p>
<p>P. ' The words, ' I am satisfied ' were for me to use as expression
</p>
<p>of confidence in the remainder of the declaration.
</p>
<p>"The proposition as originally prepared was: 'The President
</p>
<p>may desire to supply Sumter, but will not do so," etc., and your
</p>
<p>verbal explanation was that you did not believe any such at-
</p>
<p>tempt would be made, and that there was no design to rein-

</p>
<p>force Sumter.
</p>
<p>"There was a departure here from the pledges of the previous
</p>
<p>month, but, with the verbal explanation, T did not consider it a
</p>
<p>matter then to complain of. I simply stated to you that I had
</p>
<p>'hat assurance previously.
</p>
<p>"On the 7th of April I addressed you a letter on the subject
</p>
<p>of the alarm that the preparations by the Government had
</p>
<p>created, and asked you if the assurances I had given were well
</p>
<p>or ill founded. In respect to Sumter your reply was: 'Faith as
</p>
<p>to Sumter fully kept. Wait and see.'
</p>
<p>"Tn the morning's paper I read: 'An authorized messenger
</p>
<p>86
</p>
<p>from President Lincoln informed (jiovernor i'icken.s and General
</p>
<p>Beauregard that provisions will be sent to Fort Sumter  peace-
</p>
<p>ably, or otberwise by force.
</p>
<p>"This was the 8th of April, at Charleston  the day following
</p>
<p>your last assurance and is the last evidence of the full faith
</p>
<p>I was invited to irait for and see. In the same paper 1 read that
</p>
<p>intercepted dispatches disclosed the fact that Mr. Fox, who had
</p>
<p>been allowed to visit Major Anderson, on the pledge. that his
</p>
<p>purpose was pacific, employed his opportunity to devise a plan
</p>
<p>for supplying the fort by force, and that this plan had been
</p>
<p>adopted by the Washington Government, and was in process of
</p>
<p>execution.
</p>
<p>"My recollection of the date of Mr. Fox's visit carries it to
</p>
<p>p day in March. I learn that he is a near connection of a" mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the Cabinet.
</p>
<p>"My connection with the Commissioners and yourself was
</p>
<p>superinduced by the conversation with Justice Nelson. He in-
</p>
<p>formed me of your strong disposition in favor of peace and
</p>
<p>that you were oppressed with a demand of the Commissioners
</p>
<p>of the Confederate States for a reply to their first letter, and
</p>
<p>that you desired to avoid it if possible at that time.
</p>
<p>"I told him I might, jjerhaps, be of sonu; service in arranging
</p>
<p>th(> difficulty. 1 came to your office entirely at his re(|uest, and
</p>
<p>without the knowledge of either of the (Confederate) Commis-
</p>
<p>sioners. Your depression was obvious to both Judge Nelson and
</p>
<p>myself. I was gratified at the character of the counsels you
</p>
<p>were desirous of pursuing, and much impressed with your ob-
</p>
<p>servation that a civil war might be ])revented by the success of
</p>
<p>7ny mediation. You read a letter of Mi". (Thurlow) Weed, to
</p>
<p>show how irksome and responsible the withdrawals of troops
</p>
<p>from Sumter was. A portion of my communication to Judge
</p>
<p>Crawford on the 15th of March, was founded upon these re-
</p>
<p>marks, and the pledge to evacuate Sumter is less forcible than
</p>
<p>the words you employed. Th(>se words were: 'Before this letter
</p>
<p>reachas you, (a proposed letter by me to President Davis),

</p>
<p>Sumter will have been evacuated.'
</p>
<p>"The (Confederate) Commissioners who received those com-
</p>
<p>munications conclude they have been abused and overreached.
</p>
<p>The Montgomery Government hold the same opinion. The Com-
</p>
<p>missioners have supi)Osed that my communications were with
</p>
<p>you, and uj)on the hypothesis were prepared to arraign you be-
</p>
<p>fore the country in connection with the President. I placed a
</p>
<p>peremptory prohibition u})on this as being contrary to the terms
</p>
<p>of my communications with them. I pledged myself to them to
</p>
<p>communicate information upon what I considered as the best
</p>
<p>authority, and they were to confide in the ability of myself,
</p>
<p>aided by Judge Nelson, to determine upon the credibility of
</p>
<p>my informant.
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>"1 think no candid man will read over what I have written,
</p>
<p>and consider for a moment what is going on at Sumter, but will
</p>
<p>agree that the equivocating conduct of the Administration, as
</p>
<p>measured and interpreted in connection with these promises, is
</p>
<p>the proximate cause of the great calamity.
</p>
<p>"I have a profound conviction that the telegrams of the
</p>
<p>Sth of April of General Beauregard, and of the lOtli of April
</p>
<p>of General Walker, the Secretary of War, can be referred to
</p>
<p>nothing else than their belief that there has been systematic
</p>
<p>duplicity practiced on them through me. It is under an im-
</p>
<p>pressive sense of the weight of this responsibility that I submit
</p>
<p>to you these things for your explanation.
</p>
<p>' ' Very respectful Iv,
</p>
<p>"JOHN A. CAMPBELL,
</p>
<p>"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, LTnited States.
</p>
<p>"Hon. Wm. H. Seward,
</p>
<p>"Secretary of State."
</p>
<p>To this there was no answer.
</p>
<p>A week later Judge Campbell wrote the following :
</p>
<p>"Washington, April 20th, 1861.
</p>
<p>"Sir:
</p>
<p>"I enclose you a letter, corresponding very nearly with one I
</p>
<p>addressed to you one week ago (13th April), to which I have
</p>
<p>not liad any reply. The letter is simply one of inquiry in
</p>
<p>reference to facts concerning which, I think, I am entitled to
</p>
<p>an explanation. I have not adopted any opinion in reference
</p>
<p>to them which may not be modified by explanation; nor have I
</p>
<p>affirmed in that letter, nor do I in this, any conclusion of my
</p>
<p>own unfavorable to your integrity in the whole transaction.
</p>
<p>All that I have said and mean to say is, that an explanation is
</p>
<p>due from you to myself. ~
</p>
<p>"I will not say what I shall de> in case this request is not
</p>
<p>complied with, but I am justified in saying that I shall feel at
</p>
<p>liberty to place these letters before any person wlio is entitled
</p>
<p>to such an explanation of myself.

<p>These papers, and every paper connected with this affair, (in
