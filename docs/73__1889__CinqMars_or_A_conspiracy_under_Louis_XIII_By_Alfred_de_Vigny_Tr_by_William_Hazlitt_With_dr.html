</p>
<p>Je crois fermement en une vocation ineffable qui m'est donnee, et
</p>
<p>j'y crois k cause de la pitie sans bornes que m'inspireut les hommes, mes
</p>
<p>compagnons en misere, et aussi a cause du desir que je me sens de leur
</p>
<p>tendre la main et de les clever sans cesse par des paroles de commise'ra-
</p>
<p>tion et d'amour. A. DE VIGNY, Stello, p. 38.
</p>
<p>BEYOND the Champs-Ely sees, in one of the quietest
</p>
<p>streets of Paris, stands a house of modest appearance,
</p>
<p>towards which, once a week, a joyous phalanx of literary
</p>
<p>men and artists, young and old, illustrious and obscure,
</p>
<p>set forth on a pilgrimage. This house is inhabited by the
</p>
<p>most graceful, the most chaste, the most temperate of our
</p>
<p>poets. That musing man with the large forehead, the
</p>
<p>gentle voice, the noble and melancholy look, who lives
</p>
<p>here buried in reflection, meditation, and the solitude
</p>
<p>" which is holy," as the Docteur Noir says in " Stello," is
</p>
<p>the Comte Alfred de Vigny.
</p>
<p>Of all who have received the gift of poesy, none has ever

</p>
<p>consecrated to his muse a more fervid and a purer worship.
</p>
<p>VI M. ALFRED DE VIGNY.
</p>
<p>He has not dragged that muse into the street to "harness
</p>
<p>her, yelling, to the car of faction ; " he has not mutilated
</p>
<p>her to adapt her as food for all the appetites of the day.
</p>
<p>He has not urged her on to premature production, to cold
</p>
<p>transports or unfruitful caresses ; nor has he turned her
</p>
<p>aside from the things of the present to impress on her a
</p>
<p>puerile and egoistical contemplation. He has shown her
</p>
<p>life, but he has done so from on high, and without allowing
</p>
<p>her white robe to be sullied by it. He has told her to give
</p>
<p>ear to the thousand sounds of the world, and to reproduce
</p>
<p>them in melodious song ; and then, as the voice of the muse
</p>
<p>awakened, soft and sad, in the heart of the poet, the song
</p>
<p>of the poet was sad also, but of a softened, repressed,
</p>
<p>modified sadness, like a distant sound, prolonging and re-
</p>
<p>fining itself, passing through a double echo.
</p>
<p>He will lose his way who should seek to construct the
</p>
<p>biography of M. de Vigny by the aid of his books, or ques-
</p>
<p>tion his life for the secret of that tinge of melancholy
</p>
<p>which is the groundwork and charm of his inspirations.
</p>
<p>The faculty of suffering in others is the privilege of lofty
</p>
<p>souls, and an inexhaustible source of poetry. Sorrow im-
</p>
<p>agined is sometimes more favorable to powerful description
</p>
<p>than sorrow felt. The latter irritates, exaggerates itself,
</p>
<p>and cries out ; the former listens intent, analyzes itself,
</p>
<p>and weeps. In the works of M. de Vigny, the religion of
</p>
<p>self, common enough in more than one poet who sings him-
</p>
<p>self, or always loves to personify himself in his hero, is by
</p>
<p>no means conspicuous. We may see, upon looking closely,
</p>
<p>that he who has so well appreciated the rude trials of the
</p>
<p>poet and the secret agonies of the soldier, has appropriated
</p>
<p>with passion sufferings not his own ; that whether in the
</p>
<p>uniform or out of it, he has gone through life more as a

<p>spectator than as an actor, but as an attentive, interested,
</p>
<p>M. ALFRED DE VIGNY. vii
</p>
<p>and silent spectator, glowing with charity, loving sorrow as
</p>
<p>others love joy, giving himself heart and soul to its exami-
</p>
<p>nation, dissecting it deliberately, and, still young, turning,
</p>
<p>as he himself has said, all things to future profit.
</p>
<p>M. le Comte Alfred de Vigny descends from an old mili-
</p>
<p>tary race, originally of Beauce. His father, a cavalry
</p>
<p>officer under Louis XV. and Louis XVI., married, in Tou-
</p>
<p>raine, the daughter of Admiral Baraudin ; and it was in the
</p>
<p>pretty little town of Loches that on the 27th of March,
</p>
<p>1799, our poet was born. His childhood was passed in the
</p>
<p>chateau of Tronchet in Beauce. While quite a boy he was
</p>
<p>grave and studious.
</p>
<p>"I always loved to listen," he said at a later period of his life;
</p>
<p>" and when I was quite a child, I early acquired this taste on the
</p>
<p>wounded knees of my old father. He first fed me with the history
</p>
<p>of his campaigns, and on his lap, I found war seated by my side ; he
</p>
<p>showed me war in his wounds, war in the parchments and blazonry
</p>
<p>of his fathers, war in their great portraits in armor, hung on the walls
</p>
<p>of the old chateau. I saw in the nobility a great family of hereditary
</p>
<p>soldiers ; and I thought only of rising to the height of a soldier."
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the empire the young Alfred de
</p>
<p>Vigny was sent to Paris and placed in the establishment
</p>
<p>of M. Hix. Here again we shall let him speak for
</p>
<p>himself :
</p>
<p>" I was," says he, " a very absent student. War in my eyes stood
</p>
<p>erect in the lyceum ; the drum in my ears drowned the words of the
</p>
<p>masters ; and the mysterious voice of books spoke to me but a cold
</p>
<p>and pedantic language. Logarithms and tropes were in my eyes
</p>
<p>merely steps to ascend to the star of the Legion of Honor, the
</p>
<p>finest star in the heavens for boys."
</p>
<p>The young scholar did not remain long in his school ;
</p>
<p>his family, alarmed at his ardent passion for war, at an

</p>
<p>epoch when France began to be weary of it, confided him to
</p>
<p>Vlll M. ALFRED DE VIGNY.
</p>
<p>the cares of a private tutor, and endeavored, but in vain,
</p>
<p>to divert the bent of his inclinations ; it was absolutely
</p>
<p>necessary to make him a soldier. Meanwhile came the
</p>
<p>Restoration ; and scarcely sixteen years of age, the young
</p>
<p>De Vigny received a commission in the red household
</p>
<p>musketeers. Every one knows that in the Hundred Days,
</p>
<p>the red companies attended Louis XVIII. to the frontier ;
</p>
<p>M. de Vigny went with them, and during fourteen years
</p>
<p>service, destiny willed that this should be his first and only
</p>
<p>campaign. In 1816 the red companies were disbanded, and
</p>
<p>he passed into the infantry of the guard. Then began the
</p>
<p>disenchantment of the warlike gentleman ; he had dreamed
</p>
<p>of the field of battle ; he found the Champ de Mars. For
</p>
<p>a camp, he had the barracks, and the parade instead of a
</p>
<p>battle-field. As a boy, he had seen himself entering van-
</p>
<p>quished towns as a conqueror ; as a soldier, he had to carry
</p>
<p>an inoffensive sabre from garrison to garrison.
</p>
<p>Not finding in the trade of arms what he sought there,
</p>
<p>war, M. de Vigny turned towards poetry, or rather, he
</p>
<p>felt then what he expressed at a later period, that he had
</p>
<p>taken a youthful flame for an irresistible vocation ; that
</p>
<p>his first career had been a mistake ; that into an entirely
</p>
<p>active life he carried a wholly contemplative nature ; that
</p>
<p>he was born a poet, and that he was wrong in having be-
</p>
<p>come a soldier. And yet he waited a long time, not ventur-
</p>
<p>ing for honor's sake to quit the sword, fearing lest the day
</p>
<p>of his resignation should be the eve of a campaign. In
</p>
<p>1823, he passed into the line, hoping that it would at last be
</p>
<p>permitted him to burn powder in Spain. Fate denied him
</p>
<p>this favor ; he was fain to accompany an expedition with
</p>
<p>sheathed swords, cantoned in the Pyrenees ; and the only
</p>
<p>trophies he brought back were two of his poems,

<p>" Dolorida " and " Le Deluge." At last, two years after his
</p>
<p>M. ALFRED DE VIGNY. ix
</p>
<p>marriage, which took place in 1826, he determined upon
</p>
<p>ridding himself of the prosaic gorget, and forever to lay
</p>
<p>aside his epaulettes of captain of infantry, so tediously
</p>
<p>and painfully acquired.
</p>
<p>During the interval, the wings of his muse had grown ;
</p>
<p>poetry gained ground, and his verse ran more freely from
</p>
<p>the more developed source. In the year 1822, there was
</p>
<p>certainly not in the whole French army an officer of three-
</p>
<p>and-twenty like him. While all that vain, smoking, gam-
</p>
<p>bling, fighting youth crowded to the taverns round the
</p>
<p>billiard-tables, or such places, the poet, altogether out of
</p>
<p>his place, grave and thoughtful, would walk apart for a
</p>
<p>portion of the day with a few old officers of the empire,
</p>
<p>men of stooping backs and gray mustaches, soldiers of
</p>
<p>fortune, sons of the sword, silent and cold as Trappists
</p>
<p>before presumptuous sub-lieutenants, stuffed with pseudo-
</p>
<p>science, but kindly open and conversive with this young
</p>
<p>companion-in-arms, who venerated their manly character,
</p>
<p>gave a serious and eager attention to their rough stories,
</p>
<p>beautified by truth, and loved them as Desdemona loved
</p>
<p>Othello, for the dangers they had faced. At night, M. de
</p>
<p>Vigny would return to his solitary room, open his Bible
</p>
<p>or Homer, murmur a few fragments of Andre Chenier,
</p>
<p>published by M. de Chateaubriand in the " Genie du Chris-
</p>
<p>tianisme ; " and in proportion as the beloved night mounted
</p>
<p>the heavens, the poetic inspiration descended into his soul,
</p>
<p>diffused itself in harmonious waves, and he wrote his
</p>
<p>poems, strange poems for the period, and which one
</p>
<p>would imagine far rather to have grown under the gown of
</p>
<p>some young, fervent, simple, thoughtful Benedictine than
</p>
<p>under the shako of a sub-lieutenant. 1 Not that his poems

<p>about this period, or rather, two years later, at the end of 1824, from
</p>
<p>x M. ALFRED DE VIGNY.
</p>
<p>do not partake of the general movement which then began
</p>
<p>to draw men's minds into the paths of idealism ; that they
</p>
<p>may not, up to a certain point, be named in connection
</p>
<p>with the early inspirations of Larnartine and Victor Hugo ;
</p>
<p>but there is in them a certain character of strangeness in
</p>
<p>the form, something elaborately negligent, a certain vague-
</p>
<p>ness which leaves the soul unsatisfied, though gently moved,
</p>
<p>softly lulled. With the exception of a few poems, such as
</p>
<p>" Eloa," " Moise," and " Helena," which are complete and
</p>
<p>finished creations, most of the pieces that form the collec-
</p>
<p>tion of M. de Vigny have reference to fugitive thoughts,
</p>
<p>suddenly caught, and immediately framed into a brief
</p>
<p>drama. We feel that the inspiration was abundant, but that
</p>
<p>the poet was unwilling to give it all its development, in
</p>
<p>fear of its losing its freshness ; they are so many epopees
</p>
<p>in the rudimental state, admirable sketches, but still only
</p>
<p>sketches.
</p>
<p>Let us rapidly glance over them in the order of their
</p>
<p>production. "Symetha," which is dated 1815 (the poet
</p>
<p>was then sixteen), is a Greek elegy in the manner of
</p>
<p>Andre Chenier. It is a reminiscence of the blanche neere.
</p>
<p>" Neere, ne va pas te confier aux flots
</p>
<p>De peur d'etre deesse," etc,
</p>
<p>said Chenier.
</p>
<p>Pau, where he was garrisoned. At this time he had already published
</p>
<p>some of his poetry. The letter I speak of is chiefly upon political
</p>
<p>matters. Upon them the young officer expresses very decided Royalist
</p>
<p>ideas, but it closes with a few lines far more valuable to me, inasmuch
</p>
<p>as they plainly show the disposition of mind which I have mentioned
</p>
<p>above. "My Bible," he here says, "and some English prints, follow
</p>
<p>me about like my penates, and here, as everywhere else, I pass regu-
</p>
<p>larly from my sword to my pen. I know nothing of Paris, where, I am
</p>
<p>told, they have excommunicated me, as I predicted to yon, and yet I
</p>
<p>work j ust the same as though I were to be read ; every one has his illu-

<p>" Je vais mourir, helas ! Symetha s'est fiee
</p>
<p>Aux flots profonds ; 1'Attique est par elle oubliee,"
</p>
<p>says M. de Vigny. There is the same antique perfume in
</p>
<p>the thought and form, but it is imitation. M. de Vigny is
</p>
<p>not yet himself. The same may be said of " La Dryade,"
</p>
<p>of " Le Bain," of " La Somnambule," and some other pieces
</p>
<p>which belong to this first period of the life of the poet.
</p>
<p>" Moise " flows from another source of inspirations. De-
</p>
<p>spite its biblical title, " Moses " is an entirely modern psycho-
</p>
<p>logical study, full of daring and depth. The nothingness
</p>
<p>of power, the painful isolation of genius, walking sad and
</p>
<p>solitary in his glory, which can neither love nor be loved,
</p>
<p>and which would " sleep the sleep of the earth," such is
</p>
<p>the idea that M. de Vigny has developed in beautiful verses.
</p>
<p>In this pious and precocious instinct of the secret sorrows
</p>
<p>of genius struggling with itself, awaiting the time when it
</p>
<p>shall appear to the poet struggling with the external world,
</p>
<p>we may already see the dawn of " Stello." " La Fille de
</p>
<p>Jephte," the grand and magnificent scene of " Le Deluge,"
</p>
<p>"La Femme Adultere," glitter with that profusion of images
</p>
<p>peculiar to the biblical genius. The opening of the last
</p>
<p>piece reminds me of the beautiful verses of the " Moise "
</p>
<p>of M. de Chateaubriand. The similarity of ideas and form
</p>
<p>is so much the more striking from its being purely fortui-
</p>
<p>tous, for the " Moise," composed, I believe, at this time
</p>
<p>(1819). did not appear until much later. "Dolorida" is
</p>
<p>the most beautiful of all the little dramas of two hundred
</p>
<p>verses, so much loved by M. de Vigny, and which he has
</p>
<p>reproduced in " M. de Soubise la Neige," " Le Cor," and
</p>
<p>some other pieces. Dolorida, meditated at the foot of the
</p>
<p>Pyrenees, is a jealous Spaniard. Her husband deceives
</p>
<p>her ; he is at the feet of another. She waits for him ; he

<p>returns to implore her pardon before dying, for he feels
</p>
<p>Xll M. ALFRED DE VIGNY.
</p>
<p>himself consumed by an unknown flame that circulates
</p>
<p>through his veins. She listens to him patiently, and he
</p>
<p>" Oh, parle ! mon cceur fuit, quitte ce dur langage.
</p>
<p>Qu'uu regard Mais quel est ce blauchatre breuvage,
</p>
<p>Que tu bois a longs traits et d'un air iusense' ?
</p>
<p>Le reste du poisoii qu'hier je t'ai verse."
</p>
<p>With this matter others would have composed a thick
</p>
<p>book. M. de Vigny has painted a delicious miniature,
</p>
<p>somewhat incomplete perhaps, for the transitions are ab-
</p>
<p>rupt, but still full of life and action, pure, harmonious,
</p>
<p>irreproachable as to form, with the exception of two para-
</p>
<p>phrases which appear to me somewhat far-fetched, one
</p>
<p>implying chemise and the other pendule.
</p>
<p>I now come to " Eloa," M. de Vigny's poetical chef-
</p>
<p>d'&uvre, which dates from the same year, 1823, and which
</p>
<p>was composed in the Vosges. " Eloa " has often been com-
</p>
<p>pared with the " Messiah " of Klopstock. I could never
</p>
<p>myself understand what connection there could be between
</p>
<p>an immense poem, brilliant in parts, but unequal, devoid of
</p>
<p>unity and ensemble, sometimes spun out in incomprehen-
</p>
<p>sible pathos and lost in endless prolixities, like that of
</p>
<p>Klopstock, and a poem of which it is not the least merit
</p>
<p>that it forms a whole, admirably finished in its minuteness,
</p>
<p>modelled with exquisite art from the first verse to the last,
</p>
<p>uniformly clear and harmonious in form, uniformly logical
</p>
<p>in the deduction of its ideas, and so happily compounded of
</p>
<p>grace, splendor, warmth, and passion. Fiissly said, and not
</p>
<p>without reason, of the " Messiah " that the first ten cantos
</p>
<p>are the song of a swan, and the last ten the croaking of a
</p>
<p>raven. From beginning to end " Eloa " is the song of a
</p>
<p>swan. The grand rock upon which poetry that is princi-
</p>
<p>pally founded upon intuitive speculation strikes is obscur-

</p>
<p>ity, a rock which the great Milton himself has not
</p>
<p>M. ALFRED DE VIGNY. xiii
</p>
<p>steered clear of, and which appears more especially in the
</p>
<p>descriptive portion of such poems. It is, in fact, difficult
</p>
<p>to paint with perspicuity what is only seen with the eyes
</p>
<p>of the mind. All ecstatic visions, beginning with the
</p>
<p>Apocalypse, - the sublime of that class of composition,
</p>
<p>present an eternal confusion, resulting from the mixture of
</p>
<p>terrestrial reality and seraphic ideality. Man is a fallen
</p>
<p>angel whose " thoughts are turned back to heaven," says a
</p>
<p>poet. True, but they are turned only vaguely, as men turn
</p>
<p>towards their early childhood; and when he speaks of it,
</p>
<p>and more especially when he describes it in writing, his
</p>
<p>language is often confused, illogical, incoherent, velut cegri
</p>
<p>somnia. M. de Vigny, having to speak of heaven, has
</p>
<p>availed himself greatly of earth, and he has done well. I
</p>
<p>know no one who has a right to determine in what consists
</p>
<p>the local coloring in the description of paradise. M. de
</p>
<p>Vigny has very lightly passed over the description of the
</p>
<p>abode of God and the angels, and here again he has done
</p>
<p>well. On the other hand, he has dwelt on the dramatic
</p>
<p>portion of his work. In being ideal, he has not entirely
</p>
<p>ceased to be human. His Eloa is a woman, though a dei-
</p>
<p>fied woman. By this means M. de Vigny has succeeded in
</p>
<p>composing a religious poem which embraces, with beauties
</p>
<p>of the highest order, all the interest of a simple and touch-
</p>
<p>ing romance. I would fain quote some passages of it for
</p>
<p>those who by chance may not have read it, but it would be
</p>
<p>useless to quote less than all. I shall content myself with
</p>
<p>analyzing the leading idea of the poem, which in the most
</p>
<p>eminent degree presents that character of delicacy and
</p>
<p>spiritual fervor peculiar to M. de Vigny.
</p>
<p>Lazarus is just dead. Jesus is affected at the sight of
</p>
<p>the corpse. He is about to restore to life, and drops a tear.

</p>
<p>" On vit alors, du sein de Turne eblouissante,
</p>
<p>S'elever une forme et blanche et grandissante."
</p>
<p>This is Eloa. The virgin is so beautiful that all the in-
</p>
<p>habitants of heaven press round to admire her. Born from
</p>
<p>a tear of pity, Eloa will live only to console and bless.
</p>
<p>She will be the guardian angel of angels. On a certain day
</p>
<p>her companions relate to her the history of Lucifer, the
</p>
<p>rebel banished from heaven and hurled to the lowest gulf
</p>
<p>of the abyss, where he is alone, where he groans, and where
</p>
<p>no one loves him.
</p>
<p>" Et Ton crut qu'Eloa le maudirait ; mais non,
</p>
<p>L'Effroi n'altera point sou paisible visage."
</p>
<p>A tear only glittered on her eyelid. This was a tear of
</p>
<p>pity, and already almost a tear of love. Pensive and sad
</p>
<p>at the thought that there existed a sorrow which she could
</p>
<p>not control, the virgin-archangel opened her golden wings,
</p>
<p>flew apart towards unknown spheres, and there hovering
</p>
<p>thoughtfully over the abyss, saw at a distance a pale and
</p>
<p>beautiful youth lying voluptuously on a bed of vapor. A
</p>
<p>sweet, sad voice reached her,
</p>
<p>" D'oii viens-tu, belle archange ? ou vas-tu ? " etc.
</p>
<p>Nothing can equal the grace with which the poet has
</p>
<p>described this scene of seduction. The insinuating deceit
</p>
<p>of Lucifer ; the chaste alarm of the virgin, who at first flees
</p>
<p>away, like a surprised bather, mounts recoiling in her
</p>
<p>starry path, and closes her golden eyelids to avoid the im-
</p>
<p>pure glance that fascinates her ; the voice of the tempter
</p>
<p>pursues her, more and more affecting, suppliant, broken by

</p>
<p>and fear ; the feigned remorse and ardent prayer of the
</p>
<p>one, the hesitation and anguish of the other, moved by that
</p>
<p>feigned sorrow, and who would fain console its despair, yet
</p>
<p>trembles in face of the danger her timid innocence fore-
</p>
<p>sees, descends, reascends, hovers at a distance, blushes,
</p>
<p>hesitates, and weeps, all these delicate shades are admi-
</p>
<p>rably touched. Similitudes and images abound ; the whole
</p>
<p>poem seems a shower of diamonds. At last, Modesty is
</p>
<p>conquered by Pity.
</p>
<p>" Descends jusqu'k moi, car je ne puis monter,"
</p>
<p>cries the perfidious voice.
</p>
<p>" Je 1'aime et je descends ; mais que diront les cieux ?
</p>
<p>murmurs Eloa, falling into the arms of the seducer; and
</p>
<p>then the voice rises triumphant, cruel, infernal,
</p>
<p>" J'enleve mon esclave et je tiens ma victime.
</p>
<p>Tu paraissais si bon ! oh ! qu'ai-je fait ? Un crime,"
</p>
<p>answers the pitiless voice.
</p>
<p>" Seras-tu plus heureux du moins ; es-tu content ?
</p>
<p>Plus triste que jamais. Qui done es-tu ? Satan."
</p>
<p>The last verse but one is sublime. Those simple words
</p>
<p>of Eloa, almost consoling herself in her own destruction
</p>
<p>with the hope that she may mitigate the suffering of
</p>
<p>another, is a perfect personification of woman in that
</p>
<p>which in her is most ethereal, most divine, self-denial
</p>
<p>and devotion. I have never read this verse without sub-
</p>
<p>siding into revery. It seems to me that he who created it
</p>
<p>must have been something more than poet, however great
</p>
<p>a poet. It is one of those lines which at once fix them-
</p>
<p>selves on the memory, but which nothing but the memory

</p>
<p>xvi M. ALFRED DE VIGNY.
</p>
<p>A critic, as elegant in his language as he is sound in his
</p>
<p>judgment, whom it is dangerous to read when one desires
</p>
<p>as a writer to remain at all one's self, and whom I have per-
</p>
<p>haps read too attentively for the present notice to be alto-
</p>
<p>gether my own in its ground-work, M. Sainte-Beuve,
</p>
<p>in speaking of the curious process of crystallization to which
</p>
<p>M. de Vigny subjects his thought, points out the terrestrial
</p>
<p>features of the admirable poem of "Eloa." I have myself
</p>
<p>observed that this faculty of idealizing the real without
</p>
<p>destroying the reality is the finest characteristic of M. de
</p>
<p>Vigny's poetry. In his verses, as in his romances, lie is at
</p>
<p>times extremely minute, perhaps in a degree affected, but
</p>
<p>always elevated and always intelligible. In description,
</p>
<p>more especially, he is admirable for fertility, perspicuity,
</p>
<p>and truth. Head "Eloa," " Stello," or " Laurette." In
</p>
<p>well-nigh every page you will meet with a little picture,
</p>
<p>full of grace in the disposition of the figures and of charm
</p>
<p>in the contours. If I were a painter like Scheffer, I would
</p>
<p>learn the writings of M. de Vigny by heart, and so provide
</p>
<p>myself with an ample store of charming subjects for years
</p>
<p>and years to come.
</p>
<p>As a poet, we conceive that the author of " Eloa " stands
</p>
<p>in the very first rank among us. How is it, then, that
</p>
<p>under this head, the common run of people place him
</p>
<p>rather in the second rank ? For there is no denying that
</p>
<p>his poems are far from enjoying equal popularity with
</p>
<p>those of Victor Hugo or Lamartine. Perhaps, indeed, it
</p>
<p>was this comparative want of success in the outset that
</p>
<p>chiefly served to direct to prose an intellectual organization
</p>
<p>eminently rhythmical, if I may so express myself. The
</p>
<p>public indifference with respect to the poems of M. de
</p>
<p>Vigny arises from several causes, which it is needless here

</p>
<p>to develop, and of which I will refer only to the principal.
</p>
<p>M. ALFRED DE VIGNY. xvil
</p>
<p>In 1824, the period when most of M. de Vigny's poems
</p>
<p>were published, the spiritualist and morbidly pensive ten-
</p>
<p>dency had very decidedly manifested itself. Byron in
</p>
<p>England, and then Lamartine, had created and encouraged
</p>
<p>the movement ; but this tendency was altogether full of
</p>
<p>individuality. Poetry was converted into a personal his-
</p>
<p>tory, men describing themselves either directly, as did the
</p>
<p>author of the " Meditations," or indirectly, like the author
</p>
<p>of "Childe Harold." And it was just at the moment, when
</p>
<p>the public had taken a great fancy to this analytical lyrism,
</p>
<p>this poetical psychology, that M. de Vigny offered to it
</p>
<p>verses whose strange and novel form partook of no other
</p>
<p>poet's style, except perhaps and that only here and there
</p>
<p>of Chenier's ; and the groundwork of which, though it
</p>
<p>was allied to the epoch in its idealism, was visibly removed
</p>
<p>from it by a very decided impress of generalization, by a
</p>
<p>turn of thought, human, not individual. The poemes an-
</p>
<p>tiques, bibliques, and modernes of the young officer were ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly little appreciated out of a few select circles in
</p>
<p>Paris, which he frequented very assiduously while in the
</p>
<p>household troops, and which he visited from time to time
</p>
<p>only when he had passed into the line. Even now, whether
</p>
<p>it be that the prose-writer has made the world forget the
</p>
<p>poet, or whether it arises from the general indifference to
</p>
<p>poetry altogether, the first coolness of the public with ref-
</p>
<p>erence to M. de Vigny's verses still subsists ; and that is
</p>
<p>precisely the reason why I have dwelt the more upon them.
</p>
<p>For I repeat that of all our age has produced fine in poetry,
</p>
<p>I know nothing finer than "Eloa."
</p>
<p>"Cinq-Mars," commenced at the foot of the Pyrenees,
</p>
<p>continued from garrison to garrison, completed by means
</p>
<p>of frequent journeys to Paris and long studies at the

<p>Bibliotheque Royale, was published in 1826. Its success
</p>
<p>xvin Af. ALFRED DE VIGNY.
</p>
<p>was as great as it was legitimate. Before 1829, the work
</p>
<p>had already gone through four editions. There is no occa-
</p>
<p>sion to analyze a book which all have judged for them-
</p>
<p>selves. There is no person of any reading who has not
</p>
<p>present in his memory the charming creation of Marie de
</p>
<p>Gonzaga, the touching episode of Urbain Grandier, the tall
</p>
<p>and 'noble figure of De Thou, the slight but genuine sketch
</p>
<p>of Anne of Austria, the portrait, somewhat exaggerated,
</p>
<p>but really fine, of Cinq-Mars, the mournful and feeble vis-
</p>
<p>age of Louis XIII. The delineation of Kichelieu, I must
</p>
<p>confess, I don't so much like, because I think it scarcely
</p>
<p>just. M. de Vigny seems to have regarded the cardinal-
</p>
<p>generalissimo too much with the eyes of Bassompierre.
</p>
<p>In 1828, M. de Vigny translated Shakspeare's " Othello,"
</p>
<p>which was performed at the Theatre Fra^ais, on the 25th
</p>
<p>of October, 1829, with no great success. The " Marechal
</p>
<p>d'Ancre," played in 1830, also met with limited honors.
</p>
<p>In 1832, M. de Vigny published "Stello," an episode of
</p>
<p>which " Chatterton " was prepared for the stage, and
</p>
<p>produced at the Theatre Fran9ais on the llth of February,
</p>
<p>1835. M. de Vigny has since published "Servitude et
</p>
<p>Grandeur Militaires," three charming tales, and " Le
</p>
<p>Sauvage," "La Mort du Loup," and "La Flute."
</p>
<p>M. de Vigny was elected a member of the academy in
</p>
<p>1846. 1

<p>THOUGHTS ON TRUTH IN ART.
</p>
<p>THE study of social progress is to-day not less needed in
</p>
<p>literature than is the analysis of the human heart. We
</p>
<p>live in an age of universal investigation, and of exploration
</p>
<p>of 'the sources of all movements. France, above all, loves
</p>
<p>at the same time history and the drama, because the one
</p>
<p>explores the vast destinies of humanity, the other the
</p>
<p>individual lot of man. These embrace the whole of life.
</p>
<p>But it is the province of religion, of philosophy, of pure
</p>
<p>poetry only, to go beyond life, beyond time, into eternity.
</p>
<p>Of late years (and it is perhaps a result of our political
</p>
<p>changes), art has borrowed from history more than ever.
</p>
<p>All of us have our eyes fixed on our chronicles, as though,
</p>
<p>having reached manhood while going on towards greater
</p>
<p>things, we had stopped a moment to cast up the account of
</p>
<p>our youth and its errors. We have had to double interest
</p>
<p>by adding to it recollection.
</p>
<p>As France has carried farther than other nations this
</p>
<p>love of facts, and as I had chosen a recent and well-remem-
</p>
<p>bered epoch, I thought that I ought not to imitate the

</p>
<p>the men who dominate their history. I placed ours in the
</p>
<p>foreground of the scene; I made them the leading actors
</p>
<p>in this tragedy, in which I endeavored to represent the
</p>
<p>three kinds of ambition by which we are influenced, and
</p>
<p>with them the beauty of self-sacrifice to a noble ideal. A
</p>
<p>treatise on the fall of the feudal system, on the position,
</p>
<p>at home and abroad, of France in the seventeenth century,
</p>
<p>on foreign alliances, on the justice of parliaments or of
</p>
<p>secret commissions, and on accusations of sorcery, would
</p>
<p>not perhaps have been read. The romance was read.
</p>
<p>I do not mean to defend this last form of historical com-
</p>
<p>position, being convinced that the real greatness of a work
</p>
<p>lies in the substance of the author's ideas and sentiments,
</p>
<p>and not in the literary form in which they are dressed.
</p>
<p>The choice of a certain epoch will necessitate a certain
</p>
<p>treatment, to another epoch it would be unsuitable ;
</p>
<p>these are mere secrets of the workshop of thought which
</p>
<p>there is no need of disclosing. What is the use of theo-
</p>
<p>rizing as to wherein lies the charm that moves us ? We
</p>
<p>hear the tones of the harp, but its graceful form con
</p>
<p>ceals from us its springs of iron. Nevertheless, since I
</p>
<p>have been convinced that this book has in it some vitality,
</p>
<p>I cannot help throwing out these reflections on the liberty
</p>
<p>which the imagination should employ in weaving into its
</p>
<p>woof all the leading figures of an age, and in order to give
</p>
<p>more consistency to their acts, in making the reality of fact
</p>
<p>give way to the idea which each of them should represent
</p>
<p>in the eyes of posterity ; in short, on the difference which
</p>
<p>I find between the Truth of art and the True in fact.
</p>
<p>Just as we descend into our consciences to judge of
</p>
<p>actions which our minds cannot weigh, can we not also
</p>
<p>search in ourselves for the feeling which gives birth to

<p>forms of thought, always vague and cloudy ? We shall
</p>
<p>THOUGHTS ON TRUTH IN ART. xxi
</p>
<p>find in our troubled heart, where discord reigns, two needs
</p>
<p>which seem to be at variance, but which mingle, as I think,
</p>
<p>in a common source ; the one is love of the true, the other
</p>
<p>love of the fabulous.
</p>
<p>On the day when man told the story of his life to man,
</p>
<p>history was born. But of what use is the memory of
</p>
<p>facts, if not to serve as an example of good or of evil ? But
</p>
<p>the examples which the slow train of events presents to us
</p>
<p>are scattered and incomplete. They lack always a tangible
</p>
<p>and visible coherence leading straight on to a moral con-
</p>
<p>clusion. The acts of the human race on the world's stage
</p>
<p>have doubtless a coherent unity, but the meaning of this
</p>
<p>vast tragedy which it enacts there will be visible only to
</p>
<p>the eye of God, until the end, which will reveal it perhaps
</p>
<p>to the last man. All systems of philosophy have sought
</p>
<p>in vain to explain it, ceaselessly rolling their rock, which,
</p>
<p>never reaching the top, falls back upon them, each raising
</p>
<p>its frail structure on the ruins of the others, only to see it
</p>
<p>fall in its turn.
</p>
<p>I believe, then, that man, after having satisfied his first
</p>
<p>longing for facts, wanted something fuller, some grouping,
</p>
<p>some adaptation to his capacity and his experience, of the
</p>
<p>links of this vast chain of events which his sight could not
</p>
<p>take in ; for thus he hoped to find in the historic recital
</p>
<p>examples which might support the moral truths of which
</p>
<p>he was conscious. Few single careers could satisfy this
</p>
<p>longing, being only incomplete parts of the elusive whole
</p>
<p>of the history of the world ; one was a quarter, as it were,
</p>
<p>the other a half of the proof ; imagination did the rest and
</p>
<p>completed them. From this, without doubt, sprang the
</p>
<p>fable. Man created it true, because it was not given him
</p>
<p>to see more than himself end nature, which surrounds him :

<p>but he created it true with a truth all its own.
</p>
<p>XXll THOUGHTS ON TRUTH IN ART.
</p>
<p>This Truth, so beautiful, so intellectual, which I feel,
</p>
<p>which I see, and long to define, the name of which I here
</p>
<p>venture to distinguish from that of the True, that I may
</p>
<p>the better make myself understood, is the soul of all the
</p>
<p>arts. It is the selection of the characteristic token in all
</p>
<p>the beauties and the grandeurs of the visible True ; but it
</p>
<p>is not the thing itself, it is something better : it is an ideal
</p>
<p>combination of its principal forms, a luminous tint made
</p>
<p>up of its brightest colors, an intoxicating balm of its purest
</p>
<p>perfumes, a delicious elixir of its best juices, a perfect har-
</p>
<p>mony of its sweetest sounds, in short, it is a concentra-
</p>
<p>tion of all its good qualities. For this Truth, and nothing
</p>
<p>else, should strive those works of art which are a moral
</p>
<p>representation of life, dramatic works. To attain it, the
</p>
<p>first step is undoubtedly to learn all that is true in fact of
</p>
<p>every period, to become deeply imbued with its general
</p>
<p>character and with its details ; this involves only a cheap
</p>
<p>tribute of attention, of patience, and of memory. But then
</p>
<p>one must fix upon some chosen centre, and group every-
</p>
<p>thing around it; this is the work of imagination, and of
</p>
<p>that sublime common-sense which is genius itself.
</p>
<p>Of what use were the arts if they were only the reproduc-
</p>
<p>tion and the imitation of life ? Good heavens ! we see only
</p>
<p>too clearly about us the sad and disenchanting reality, the
</p>
<p>insupportable lukewarmness of feeble characters, of shallow
</p>
<p>virtues and vices, of irresolute loves, of tempered hates, of
</p>
<p>wavering friendships, of unsettled beliefs, of constancy
</p>
<p>which has its height and its depth, of opinions which
</p>
<p>evaporate. Let us dream that once upon a time have lived
</p>
<p>men stronger and greater, who were more determined for
</p>
<p>good or for evil ; that does us good. If the paleness of
</p>
<p>your True is to follow us into art, we shall close at once

<p>the theatre and the book, to avoid meeting it a second time.
</p>
<p>THOUGHTS ON TRUTH IN ART. xxiii
</p>
<p>What is wanted of works which revive the ghosts of hu-
</p>
<p>man beings is, I repeat, the philosophical spectacle of man
</p>
<p>deeply wrought upon by the passions of his character and
</p>
<p>of his epoch ; it is, in short, the artistic Truth of that man
</p>
<p>and that epoch, but both raised to a higher and ideal
</p>
<p>power which concentrates all their forces. You recognize
</p>
<p>this Truth in works of the imagination just as you cry out
</p>
<p>at the resemblance of a portrait of which you have never
</p>
<p>seen the original; for true talent paints life rather than
</p>
<p>the living.
</p>
<p>To banish finally the scruples on this point of the
</p>
<p>consciences of some persons, timorous in literary matters,
</p>
<p>whom I have seen affected with a personal sorrow on
</p>
<p>viewing the rashness with which the imagination sports
</p>
<p>with the most weighty characters of history, I will hazard
</p>
<p>the assertion that, not throughout this work, I dare not
</p>
<p>say that, but in many of these pages, and those perhaps
</p>
<p>not of the least merit, history is a romance of which the
</p>
<p>people is the author. The human mind, I believe, cares
</p>
<p>for the True only in the general character of an epoch.
</p>
<p>What it values most of all is the sum-total of events and
</p>
<p>the advance of civilization, which carries individuals along
</p>
<p>with it ; but, indifferent to details, it cares less to have
</p>
<p>them real than noble, or rather, grand and complete.
</p>
<p>Examine closely the origin of certain deeds, of certain
</p>
<p>heroic expressions, which are born one knows not how ;
</p>
<p>you will see them leap out ready-made from hearsay and
</p>
<p>the murmurs of the crowd, without having in themselves
</p>
<p>more than a shadow of truth, and, nevertheless, they will
</p>
<p>remain historical forever. As if by way of pleasantry, and
</p>
<p>to put a joke upon posterity, the public voice invents sub-
</p>
<p>lime utterances to lend, during their lives and under their

</p>
<p>they may, as not deserving so much glory * and as not being
</p>
<p>able to support so high renown. In vain ; their disclaimers
</p>
<p>are not received. Let them cry out, let them write, let
</p>
<p>them print, let them sign, they are not listened to.
</p>
<p>Their utterances are inscribed in bronze ; the poor fellows
</p>
<p>remain historical and sublime in spite of themselves. And
</p>
<p>I do not find that all this is done in the ages of barbarism
</p>
<p>alone ; it is still going on, and it moulds the history of yes-
</p>
<p>terday to the taste of public opinion, a Muse tyrannical
</p>
<p>and capricious, which preserves the general purport and
</p>
<p>scorns detail. Which of you has not been present at its
</p>
<p>transformation ? Do you not see with your own eyes the
</p>
<p>chrysalis fact assume by degrees the wings of fiction ?
</p>
<p>Half formed by the necessities of the time, a fact is hidden
</p>
<p>in the ground, obscure and incomplete, rough, sometimes
</p>
<p>badly constructed, like a block of marble not yet rough-
</p>
<p>hewn. The first who unearth it, and take it in hand, would
</p>
<p>wish it differently shaped, and pass it, already a little
</p>
<p>rounded, into other hands ; others polish it as they pass it
</p>
<p>along ; in a short time it is exhibited transformed into an
</p>
<p>immortal statue. We disclaim it; witnesses who have
</p>
<p>seen and heard pile refutations upon explanations ; the
</p>
<p>1 In our time has not a Russian general denied the fire of Moscow,
</p>
<p>which we have made heroic, and which will remain so ? Has not a
</p>
<p>French general denied the utterance on the field of Waterloo which will
</p>
<p>immortalize it ? And if I were not withheld by my respect for a sacred
</p>
<p>event, I might recall that a priest has felt it to be his duty to disavow in
</p>
<p>public a sublime speech which will remain the noblest that has ever been
</p>
<p>pronounced on a scaffold : " Son of Saint Louis, rise to heaven ! " When
</p>
<p>I learned not long ago its real author, I was overcome by the destruction
</p>
<p>of my illusion, but before long I was consoled by a thought that does
</p>
<p>honor to humanity in my eyes. I feel that France has consecrated this
</p>
<p>speech, because she felt the need of re-establishing herself in her own
</p>
<p>eyes, of blinding herself to her awful error, and of believing that then

<p>and there an honest man was found who dared to speak aloud.

</p>
<p>learned investigate, pore over books, and write. No one
</p>
<p>listens to them any more than to the humble heroes who
</p>
<p>disown it ; the torrent rolls on and bears with it the whole
</p>
<p>thing under the form which it has pleased it to give to
</p>
<p>these individual actions. What was needed for all this
</p>
<p>work ? A nothing, a word ; sometimes the caprice of a
</p>
<p>journalist out of work. And are we the losers by it ? No.
</p>
<p>The adopted fact is always better composed than the real
</p>
<p>one, and it is even adopted only because it is better. The
</p>
<p>human race feels a need that its destinies should afford it
</p>
<p>a series of lessons ; more careless than we think of the
</p>
<p>reality of facts, it strives to perfect the event in order to
</p>
<p>give it a great moral significance, feeling sure that the
</p>
<p>succession of scenes which it plays upon earth is not a
</p>
<p>comedy, and that since it advances, it marches towards an
</p>
<p>end, of which the explanation must be sought beyond what
</p>
<p>is visible.
</p>
<p>For my part, I acknowledge my gratitude to the voice
</p>
<p>of the people for this achievement ; for often in the finest
</p>
<p>life are found strange blemishes and inconsistencies which
</p>
<p>pain me when I see them. If a man seems to me a perfect
</p>
<p>model of a grand and noble character, and if some one
</p>
<p>comes and tells me of a mean trait which disfigures him, I
</p>
<p>am saddened by it, even though I do not know him, as by a
</p>
<p>misfortune which affects me in person ; and I could almost
</p>
<p>wish that he had died before the change in his character.
</p>
<p>Thus, when the Muse (and I give that name to art as a
</p>
<p>whole, to everything which belongs to the domain of
</p>
<p>imagination, almost in the same way as the ancients gave
</p>
<p>the name of Music to all education), when the Muse has
</p>
<p>related, in her impassioned manner, the adventures of a
</p>
<p>character whom I know to have lived ; and when she re-

</p>
<p>shapes his experiences into conformity with the strongest
</p>
<p>xxvi THOUGHTS ON TRUTH IN ART.
</p>
<p>idea of vice or virtue which can be conceived of him,
</p>
<p>filling the gaps, veiling the incongruities of his life, and
</p>
<p>giving him that perfect unity of conduct which we like to
</p>
<p>see represented even in evil, if in addition to this, she
</p>
<p>preserves the only thing essential to the instruction of the
</p>
<p>world, the spirit of the epoch, I know no reason why we
</p>
<p>should be more exacting with her than with this voice of
</p>
<p>the people which every day makes every fact undergo so
</p>
<p>great changes.
</p>
<p>The ancients carried this liberty even into history ; they
</p>
<p>wanted to see in it only the general march, and broad
</p>
<p>movements of peoples and nations ; and on these great
</p>
<p>movements, brought to view in courses very distinct and
</p>
<p>very clear, they placed a few colossal figures, symbols
</p>
<p>of noble character and of lofty purpose.
</p>
<p>One might almost reckon mathematically that, having
</p>
<p>undergone the double composition of public opinion and
</p>
<p>of the author, their history reaches us at third hand and
</p>
<p>separated by two stages from the truth of fact.
</p>
<p>It is because in their eyes history too was a work of art;
</p>
<p>and in consequence of not having realized that such is its
</p>
<p>real nature, the whole Christian world still lacks an his-
</p>
<p>torical monument like those which dominate antiquity and
</p>
<p>consecrate the memory of its destinies, as its pyramids,
</p>
<p>its obelisks, its pylones, and its porticos still dominate the
</p>
<p>earth which was known to them, and thereby commemorate
</p>
<p>the grandeur of antiquity.
</p>
<p>If, then, we find everywhere evidence of this inclination
</p>
<p>to desert the positive, to bring the ideal even into historic
</p>
<p>annals, I believe that with greater reason we should be
</p>
<p>completely indifferent to historical reality in judging the
</p>
<p>dramatic" works, whether poems, romances, or tragedies,

</p>
<p>ought never to be considered except in its relations with its
</p>
<p>ideal beauty. Let it be said that what is true in fact is
</p>
<p>secondary merely; it is only an illusion the more with
</p>
<p>which it adorns itself, one of our prejudices which it
</p>
<p>respects. It can do without it, for the Truth by which it
</p>
<p>must live is the truth of observation of human nature, and
</p>
<p>not authenticity of fact. The names of the characters
</p>
<p>have nothing to do with the matter. The idea is every-
</p>
<p>thing ; the proper name is only the example and the proof
</p>
<p>of the idea.
</p>
<p>So much the better for the memory of those who are
</p>
<p>chosen to represent philosophical or moral ideas ; but, once
</p>
<p>again, that is not the question. The imagination can pro-
</p>
<p>duce just as fine things without them ; it is a power wholly
</p>
<p>creative ; the imaginary beings which it animates are en-
</p>
<p>dowed with life as truly as the real beings which it brings
</p>
<p>to life again. We believe in Othello as we do in Richard
</p>
<p>III., whose tomb is in Westminster; in Lovelace and in
</p>
<p>Clarissa as in Paul and in Virginia, whose tombs are in the
</p>
<p>Isle of France. It is with the same eye that we must
</p>
<p>watch the performance of its characters, and demand of
</p>
<p>the Muse only her artistic Truth, more lofty than the True,
</p>
<p>whether collecting the traits of a character dispersed
</p>
<p>among a thousand entire individuals, she composes from
</p>
<p>them a type whose name alone is imaginary; or whether
</p>
<p>she goes to their tomb to seek and to touch with her gal-
</p>
<p>vanic current the dead whose great deeds are known, forces
</p>
<p>them to arise again, and drags them dazzled to the light of
</p>
<p>day, where in the circle which this fairy has traced, they
</p>
<p>retake unwillingly their passions of other days, and begin
</p>
<p>again in the sight of their descendants the sad drama of

<p>LORD BYRON.
</p>
<p>IP in the months of summer you have traversed fair
</p>
<p>Touraine, you have no doubt followed with enchantment
</p>
<p>the tranquil Loire ; you have regretted the impossibility
</p>
<p>of determining upon which of its banks you would choose
</p>
<p>to dwell in the society of a beloved being. Upon the
</p>
<p>right bank, valleys peopled with charming white houses
</p>
<p>surrounded with woods, hills yellow with vines or white
</p>
<p>with the blossoms of the cherry-tree, old walls covered
</p>
<p>with budding honeysuckles, gardens of roses from which

</p>
<p>a pointed roof suddenly rises, everything reminds you
</p>
<p>either of the fertility of the land or of the antiquity of its
</p>
<p>monuments ; and everything interests you in the labors
</p>
<p>of its industrious inhabitants. Nothing has proved use-
</p>
<p>less to them ; it seems as if in their love for so beautiful
</p>
<p>a country, the only province of France never occupied
</p>
<p>by the foreigner, they have desired not to lose the
</p>
<p>least portion of its soil, the smallest grain of its sand.
</p>
<p>You fancy that this old ruined tower is inhabited only
</p>
<p>by the hideous birds of night ? No ; at the sound of
</p>
<p>your horse's hoofs, the smiling face of a young girl
</p>
<p>issues from the ivy, whitened with the dust from the
</p>
<p>high-road. If you climb a hillside bristling with vines,
</p>
<p>a light column of smoke makes you aware that there is
</p>
<p>a chimney at your feet ; for the very rock is inhabited,
</p>
<p>and families of vine-dressers breathe in its profound cav-
</p>
<p>erns, sheltered at night by the nutritious earth which
</p>
<p>they laboriously cultivate during the day. The good
</p>
<p>people of Touraine are as simple as their life, gentle
</p>
<p>as the air which they respire, and strong as the power-
</p>
<p>ful earth whicli they dig. Their countenances, like their
</p>
<p>characters, have something of the openness of the true
</p>
<p>people of Saint Louis ; their chestnut locks are still long
</p>
<p>and rounded about their ears, as in the stone statutes
</p>
<p>of our old kings ; their language is the purest French,
</p>
<p>without slowness, rapidity, or accent, the cradle
</p>
<p>of the language is there, hard by the cradle of the
</p>
<p>monarchy.
</p>
<p>But the left bank of the Loire is of a more serious
</p>
<p>aspect ; here in the distance you see Chambord, which,

</p>
<p>with its blue domes and little cupolas, seems like some
</p>
<p>THE ADIEU. 3
</p>
<p>great Eastern city ; there is Chanteloup, lifting its grace-
</p>
<p>ful pagoda in the air. After these, however, a more
</p>
<p>simple building attracts the eves of the traveller by its
</p>
<p>magnificent position and imposing size; it is the chateau
</p>
<p>of Chaumont. Constructed upon the highest hill of the
</p>
<p>shore, it frames its broad summit with its lofty walls
</p>
<p>and its enormous towers ; high steeples of slate in-
</p>
<p>crease their loftiness, and confer upon the entire build-
</p>
<p>ing that air of a convent, that religious form of all our
</p>
<p>old chateaux, which casts a character of gravity over the
</p>
<p>landscape of most of our provinces. Black and tufted
</p>
<p>trees surround this ancient mansion, and resemble from
</p>
<p>afar the plumes which encircled the hat of King Henri.
</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill, and connected with the chateau
</p>
<p>by a narrow path winding through the rock, lies a pretty
</p>
<p>village, whose white houses seem to have sprung from
</p>
<p>the golden sand ; a chapel stands halfway up the hill ;
</p>
<p>the lords descended and the villagers ascended to its
</p>
<p>altar, the realm of equality, situated like a neutral
</p>
<p>city between misery and grandeur, which have been too
</p>
<p>often opposed to one another in battle array.
</p>
<p>It was here that one morning in the month of June,
</p>
<p>1639, the bell of the chateau having, as usual, rung at
</p>
<p>midday, the dinner hour of the family, there were pass-
</p>
<p>ing, in this ancient dwelling, occurrences of an unusual
</p>
<p>kind. The numerous domestics observed that in re-
</p>
<p>peating the morning prayer to the assembled house, the
</p>
<p>Mare'chale d'Effiat had spoken with a broken voice and
</p>
<p>with tears in her eyes, and that she had appeared in a
</p>
<p>deeper mourning than was customary. The people of

<p>tua, who had at that time retired for a while to Chau-
</p>
<p>raont, saw with surprise that preparations were suddenly
</p>
<p>making for departure. The old domestic of the Marechal
</p>
<p>d'Effiat, himself dead six months, had taken again to his
</p>
<p>travelling-boots, which he had sworn before to abandon

<p>forever. This brave fellow, named Grandchamp, had

<p>followed the chief of the family everywhere in the wars,

<p>and in his financial labors ; he had been his equerry in
</p>
<p>the first, and his secretary in the last. He had recently
</p>
<p>returned from Germany, to acquaint the mother and
</p>
<p>the children with the death of the marechal, whose last
</p>
<p>sighs he had heard at Luzzenstein. He was one of those
</p>
<p>faithful servants, the like of whom are become too rare
</p>
<p>in France ; who suffer with the misfortunes of the fam-
</p>
<p>ily, and rejoice with their joys : who advocate the forma-
</p>
<p>tion of marriages, that they may have to educate young
</p>
<p>masters ; who scold the children and often the fathers ;
</p>
<p>who expose themselves to death for them ; who serve
</p>
<p>them without wages in revolutions ; who labor for their
</p>
<p>sustenance ; and who in prosperous times follow them
</p>
<p>everywhere, and exclaim at their return, " Behold our
</p>
<p>vines ! " He had a severe and remarkable face, a cop-
</p>
<p>per complexion, silvery-gray hair, of which, however,
</p>
<p>some few threads, black as his thick eyebrows, made
</p>
<p>him appear harsh at first, but a gentle countenance
</p>
<p>softened this first impression. At present, the sound
</p>
<p>of his voice was loud. He busied himself much that
</p>
<p>day in hastening the dinner, and ordered about all the
</p>
<p>people of the house, who were in mourning like himself.
</p>
<p>" Come," said he, " make haste to serve the dinner,

<p>while Germain, Louis, and Etienne go and saddle their
</p>
<p>THE ADIEU. 5
</p>
<p>horses ; M. Henri and I must be far away hence by
</p>
<p>eight o'clock this evening. And you, gentlemen, Ital-
</p>
<p>ians, have you admonished your young princess ? I
</p>
<p>wager that she is gone to read with her ladies at the
</p>
<p>other end of the park, or upon the banks of the lake.
</p>
<p>She always comes in after the first course, and makes
</p>
<p>every one get up from the table."
</p>
<p>" Ah, my good Grandchamp," said in a low voice a
</p>
<p>young chambermaid who was passing, and paused, " do
</p>
<p>not speak of the duchesse ; she is very sorrowful, and I
</p>
<p>believe that she will remain in her apartment. Santa
</p>
<p>Maria! what a shame to travel to-day! depart on a
</p>
<p>Friday, the 13th of the month, and the day of Saint
</p>
<p>Gervais and Saint Protais, the day of two martyrs !
</p>
<p>I have been telling my beads all the morning for M. de
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars ; verily, I could not help thinking of these
</p>
<p>things. And my mistress thinks of them too, great lady
</p>
<p>as she is ; so that you need not laugh ! "
</p>
<p>With these words the young Italian girl glided like a
</p>
<p>bird across the large dining-room, and vanished into a
</p>
<p>corridor, startled at seeing the double folds of the great
</p>
<p>doors of the saloon opened.
</p>
<p>Grandchamp had scarcely attended to what she had
</p>
<p>said, and seemed to have been only occupied with the pre-
</p>
<p>parations for dinner; he fulfilled the important duties
</p>
<p>of major-domo, and cast severe looks at the domestics,
</p>
<p>to see if they were all at their posts, placing himself be-
</p>
<p>hind the chair of the eldest son of the house, when all
</p>
<p>the inhabitants of the mansion successively entered the
</p>
<p>saloon. Eleven persons, men and women, seated them-

<p>selves at table. The marechale came in last, giving
</p>
<p>6 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>her arm to a fine old man, magnificently attired, whom
</p>
<p>she placed upon her left hand. She seated herself in a
</p>
<p>great gilt armchair at the centre of the table, which was
</p>
<p>oblong in form. Another seat, rather more ornamented,
</p>
<p>was at her right, but it remained empty. The young
</p>
<p>Marquis d'Effiat, seated in front of his mother, was to
</p>
<p>assist her in doing the honors of the table. He was not
</p>
<p>more than twenty years old, and his countenance was
</p>
<p>insignificant ; much gravity and distinguished manners
</p>
<p>proclaimed, however, a sociable nature, but nothing
</p>
<p>more. His young sister of fourteen, two gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the province, three young Italian noblemen of the
</p>
<p>suite of Marie de Gonzaga (Duchesse de Mantua), a
</p>
<p>lady-iii-waiting, the governess of the young daughter of
</p>
<p>the marechale, and an abbe of the neighborhood, old
</p>
<p>and very deaf, composed the assembly. A seat at the
</p>
<p>right of the eldest sou still remained vacant.
</p>
<p>The mare*chale, before seating herself, made the sign
</p>
<p>of the cross, and repeated the B6nedicit6 aloud ; every
</p>
<p>one responded by making the complete sign, or upon the
</p>
<p>breast alone. This custom was preserved in many fami-
</p>
<p>lies in France up to the revolution of 1789 ; some
</p>
<p>still retain it, but more in the provinces than in Paris,
</p>
<p>and not without some embarrassment and some prelim-
</p>
<p>inary words upon the fine weather, accompanied by a
</p>
<p>smile of excuse when a stranger is present, for it is
</p>
<p>too true that goodness has also its blush.
</p>
<p>The mare'chale was a woman of imposing figure, and
</p>
<p>her large blue eyes were of a remarkable beauty. She
</p>
<p>did not appear to have yet attained her forty-fifth year ;

</p>
<p>but oppressed with sorrow, she walked slowly and spoke
</p>
<p>THE ADIEU. 1
</p>
<p>with difficulty, closing her eyes, and suffering her head
</p>
<p>to fall for a moment upon her breast, after she had been
</p>
<p>obliged to raise her voice. At such times her hand
</p>
<p>pressed to her bosom showed that she experienced acute
</p>
<p>pain. She therefore saw with satisfaction that the per-
</p>
<p>sonage who was seated at her left, having at the begin-
</p>
<p>ning engrossed the conversation, without having been
</p>
<p>requested to converse by any one, persisted with an im-
</p>
<p>perturbable coolness in engrossing it to the end of the
</p>
<p>repast. This was the old Marechal de Bassoinpierre ;
</p>
<p>he had preserved beneath his white hairs an air of youth
</p>
<p>and vivacity curious to see. His noble and polished man-
</p>
<p>ners had somewhat of a gallantry antiquated like his
</p>
<p>costume, for he wore a ruff in the fashion of Henri
</p>
<p>IV., and slashed sleeves in that of the former reign, an
</p>
<p>absurdity which was unpardonable in the eyes of the
</p>
<p>beaux of the court. This would not have appeared more
</p>
<p>singular than anything else at present ; but it is ad-
</p>
<p>mitted that in every age we laugh at the costume of our
</p>
<p>fathers, and, save the Eastern people, I know of none
</p>
<p>who are -not affected with this evil.
</p>
<p>One of the Italian gentlemen had scarcely finished ask-
</p>
<p>ing the mare'chal what he thought of the way in which
</p>
<p>the cardinal treated the daughter of the Due de Mantua,
</p>
<p>than he exclaimed in his familiar language,
</p>
<p>" Zounds, sir ! what are you talking about ? what can
</p>
<p>I comprehend of this new system under which France is
</p>
<p>living ? We old companions in arms of the late king can
</p>
<p>ill understand the language which is spoken by the new
</p>
<p>court, and that in its turn does not comprehend ours.

</p>
<p>mournful country, for all the world is silent before the
</p>
<p>cardinal ; this haughty little vassal looks upon us as old
</p>
<p>family portraits, which every now and then he abridges
</p>
<p>by the head, but happily the motto always remains. Is
</p>
<p>it not so, my dear Puy-Laurens ? "
</p>
<p>This guest was about the same age as the marechal,
</p>
<p>but being more grave and cautious than he, answered
</p>
<p>in vague and few words, and made a sign to his contem-
</p>
<p>porary in order to induce him to observe the unpleasant
</p>
<p>emotions which he had caused to the mistress of the
</p>
<p>house by reminding her of the recent death of her hus-
</p>
<p>band and speaking thus of the minister, his friend. But
</p>
<p>it was in vain, for Bassompierre, contented with the sign
</p>
<p>of semi-approbation, emptied at one draught a great gob-
</p>
<p>let of wine, a remedy which he lauds in his memoirs
</p>
<p>as infallible against the plague and against reserve ; and
</p>
<p>leaning back to receive another from his esquire, he es-
</p>
<p>tablished himself more firmly than ever upon his chair,
</p>
<p>and in his favorite ideas.
</p>
<p>" Yes, we are in the way here ; I said so the other
</p>
<p>day to my dear Due de Guise, whom they have ruined.
</p>
<p>They number the minutes that we have to live, and
</p>
<p>shake the sand to hasten its descent. When M. le
</p>
<p>Cardinal-Due beholds in a corner three or four of our
</p>
<p>tall figures, who never quitted the side of the late king,
</p>
<p>he feels that he is unable to stir those statues of iron,
</p>
<p>and that to do it would require the hand of a great
</p>
<p>man ; he passes quickly by, and dares not meddle with
</p>
<p>us, who fear him not. He believes that we are always
</p>
<p>conspiring ; and at this very moment they say that there

<p>is talk of putting me in the Bastille."
</p>
<p>THE ADIEU. 9
</p>
<p>" Eh ! M. le Mare'chal, why do you delay your de-
</p>
<p>parture ? " said the Italian. " I know nowhere, save
</p>
<p>Flanders, where you can find shelter."
</p>
<p>" Ah, sir ! you do not know me. So far from flying, I
</p>
<p>sought out the king before his departure, and I told him
</p>
<p>that I did so in order to save people the trouble of look-
</p>
<p>ing for me ; and that if I knew when he wished to send
</p>
<p>me, I would go myself without being taken. He was as
</p>
<p>good as I expected that he would be, and said to me,
</p>
<p>* How, my old friend, could you have thought that I
</p>
<p>desired to send you there ? You know well that I love
</p>
<p>you.' "
</p>
<p>" Ah, my dear mare'chal, let me compliment you,''
</p>
<p>said Madame d'Effiat, in a soft voice. " I recognize the
</p>
<p>benevolence of the king in these words ; he remembers
</p>
<p>the affection which the king, his father, had towards
</p>
<p>you. It appears to me that he ever accorded to you all
</p>
<p>that you desired for your friends," added she, with
</p>
<p>animation, in order to put him into the track of praise,
</p>
<p>and to draw him from the discontent which he had so
</p>
<p>loudly declared.
</p>
<p>" Assuredly, Madame," answered he ; " no one is more
</p>
<p>willing to recognize his virtues than Frangois de Bassom-
</p>
<p>pierre. I will be faithful to him to the end, because I
</p>
<p>gave myself, body and goods, to his father at a ball ; and
</p>
<p>I swear that with my consent at least, none of my fam-
</p>
<p>ily shall ever fail in their duties towards the King of
</p>
<p>France. Although the Besteins are foreigners and Lor-
</p>
<p>rains, a shake of the hand from Henri IV. gained us for-
</p>
<p>ever. My greatest grief has been to see my brother die

</p>
<p>nephew to say that I will disinherit him if he passes over
</p>
<p>to the emperor, as report speaks of his doing."
</p>
<p>One of the gentlemen who had as yet said nothing, and
</p>
<p>who was remarkable for the profusion of knots, ribbons,
</p>
<p>and tags which covered his dress, and for the black cor-
</p>
<p>don of the order of Saint Michael which adorned his
</p>
<p>neck, bowed, observing that it was thus that all faithful
</p>
<p>subjects ought to speak.
</p>
<p>" I' faith, M. de Launay, you deceive yourself very
</p>
<p>much," said the mare'chal, to whom the recollection of
</p>
<p>his ancestors now occurred ; " persons of our blood are
</p>
<p>subjects in heart, for God has caused us to be born as
</p>
<p>much lords of our lands as the king is of his. When
</p>
<p>I came into France, it was that I might take my ease,
</p>
<p>accompanied by my gentlemen and pages. I perceive,
</p>
<p>however, that the farther we go, the more we lose sight of
</p>
<p>this idea, especialty at the court. But here comes a young
</p>
<p>man who arrives very opportunely to hear me."
</p>
<p>The door indeed opened, and there entered a young
</p>
<p>man of fine form. He was pale ; his hair was brown,
</p>
<p>his eyes black, his expression sorrowful and careless. It
</p>
<p>was Henri d'Effiat, Marquis de Cinq-Mars (a name taken
</p>
<p>from an estate of his family). His dress and his short
</p>
<p>cloak were black ; a collar of lace fell from his neck half-
</p>
<p>way down his breast ; his stout, small, and very wide
</p>
<p>boots and his spurs made so much noise upon the flags
</p>
<p>of the saloon that his approach was heard at a distance.
</p>
<p>He walked right up to the mare'chale, bowing low, and
</p>
<p>kissing her hand.
</p>
<p>" Well, Henri," said she, " are your horses ready ?

<p>At what hour do you depart ? "
</p>
<p>THE ADIEU. 11
</p>
<p>" Immediately after dinner, Madame, if you will allow
</p>
<p>me " said he to his mother, with the ceremonious respect
</p>
<p>of the times ; and passing behind her, he saluted M. de
</p>
<p>Bassompierre before seating himself upon the left hand
</p>
<p>of his eldest brother.
</p>
<p>" Well, then," said the mare'chal, continuing to eat
</p>
<p>with an excellent appetite, " you are about to depart, my
</p>
<p>son ; you are going to the court, a slippery place nowa-
</p>
<p>days. I am sorry for your sake that it is not now what
</p>
<p>it used to be. In former times, the court was simply
</p>
<p>the drawing-room of the king, in which he received his
</p>
<p>natural friends ; nobles of great family, his peers, who
</p>
<p>visited him to show their devotion and their friendship,
</p>
<p>lost their money with him, and accompanied him in his
</p>
<p>pleasure parties, but never received anything of him,
</p>
<p>except permission to bring their vassals with themselves
</p>
<p>to break their heads in his service. The honors which
</p>
<p>a man of quality received did not enrich him, for he paid
</p>
<p>for them out of his purse. I sold an estate for every
</p>
<p>grade I ascended ; the title of colonel-general of the
</p>
<p>Swiss cost me four hundred thousand crowns, and at
</p>
<p>the baptism of the present king I had to buy a costume
</p>
<p>which cost me a hundred thousand francs."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " said the mistress of the house, smiling, " you
</p>
<p>must acknowledge for once that you were not obliged to
</p>
<p>do that. We have all heard of your splendid dress of
</p>
<p>pearls ; but I should be much vexed if it were still the
</p>
<p>custom to wear such."
</p>
<p>" Oh, Madame la Marquise, do not fear, those times of
</p>
<p>magnificence will never return. We committed follies,

<p>no doubt, but they proved our independence ; it is clear
</p>
<p>12 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>that it would then have been hard to seduce from their
</p>
<p>allegiance to the king servants who were attached to
</p>
<p>him by love alone, and whose coronets contained as
</p>
<p>many diamonds as his own locked-up crown. It is also
</p>
<p>manifest that ambition could not then attack all classes,
</p>
<p>since such expenses could only come from rich hands,
</p>
<p>and since gold comes only from mines. Those great
</p>
<p>houses which are being so furiously assailed were not
</p>
<p>ambitious, and frequently desiring no employment from
</p>
<p>the Government, maintained their places at court by
</p>
<p>their own weight, existed upon their own foundation, and
</p>
<p>might say, as one of them did say, ' The prince conde-
</p>
<p>scends not ; I am Rohan.' It was the same with every
</p>
<p>noble family, to which its own nobility sufficed ; the king
</p>
<p>himself expressed it in writing to one of my friends,
</p>
<p>' Money is not common goods between gentlemen like
</p>
<p>you and me.' "
</p>
<p>" But, M. le Mardchal," coldly and with extreme po-
</p>
<p>liteness interrupted M. de Launay, who perhaps in-
</p>
<p>tended to anger him, " this independence has pro-
</p>
<p>duced many civil wars and revolts, as those of M. de
</p>
<p>Montmorency."
</p>
<p>" Zounds, sir ! I cannot consent to hear these things
</p>
<p>spoken," said the fiery mare'chal, leaping up in his arm-
</p>
<p>chair. " Those revolts and wars, sir, had nothing to do
</p>
<p>with the fundamental laws of the State, and could no
</p>
<p>more have overturned the throne than a duel could have
</p>
<p>done so. Of all the great party-chiefs, there was not
</p>
<p>one who would not have laid his victory at the feet of

<p>the king, had he succeeded, knowing well that all the

<p>other lords who were as great as himself would have
</p>
<p>THE ADIEU. 13
</p>
<p>abandoned the enemy of the legitimate sovereign. Arms
</p>
<p>were taken against a faction, and not against the sover-
</p>
<p>eign authority ; and, this destroyed, all things went on
</p>
<p>again in their old course. But what have you done in
</p>
<p>crushing us ? You have crushed the arm of the throne,
</p>
<p>and have not put anything in its place. Yes, I no
</p>
<p>longer doubt but that the cardinal-due will wholly ac-
</p>
<p>complish his design ; the great nobility will leave and
</p>
<p>lose their lands, and ceasing to be great proprietors, they
</p>
<p>will cease to be a great power. The court is already
</p>
<p>no more than a palace where people beg ; by-and-by it
</p>
<p>will become an antechamber, when it will be only com-
</p>
<p>posed of those who constitute the suite of the king.
</p>
<p>Great names will begin by ennobling vile offices ; but
</p>
<p>by a terrible reaction, those offices will end by render-
</p>
<p>ing great names vile. Estranged from their homes,
</p>
<p>the nobility will be dependent upon the employments
</p>
<p>which they shall have received ; and if the people, over
</p>
<p>whom they will no longer have any influence, choose
</p>
<p>to revolt "
</p>
<p>" How dismal you are to-day, Mare'chal ! " interrupted
</p>
<p>the marquise ; " I hope that neither I nor my children
</p>
<p>will ever see that time. I no longer perceive your
</p>
<p>cheerful character, now that you assume the politician ;
</p>
<p>I expected to hear you give advice to my son. Henri,
</p>
<p>what is the matter with you ? You seem very absent."

<p>Cinq-Mars, with eyes fixed upon the great bay-window
</p>
<p>of the dining-room, looked sorrowfully upon the mag-
</p>
<p>nificent landscape which stretched beyond. The sun

</p>
<p>14 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>The sky was azure, the waves of a transparent yellow,
</p>
<p>the isles of a brilliant green; behind their rounded
</p>
<p>forms rose the great sails of the merchant vessels like
</p>
<p>a fleet in ambuscade.
</p>
<p>" Nature, Nature ! " mused he ; " beautiful Nature,
</p>
<p>adieu ! Soon will my heart have ceased to be of sim-
</p>
<p>plicity enough to feel you ; soon you will no longer
</p>
<p>charm my eyes. This heart is already burned by a deep
</p>
<p>passion ; and the mention of the interests of men casts
</p>
<p>into it hitherto unknown agitation. I must, however,
</p>
<p>enter this labyrinth ; I may, haply, lose myself there,
</p>
<p>but for Marie
</p>
<p>At this moment, aroused by the words of his mother,
</p>
<p>and fearing to exhibit a childish regret at leaving his
</p>
<p>beautiful country and his family, he said,
</p>
<p>" I am thinking, Madame, of the road which I shall
</p>
<p>take to Perpignan, and also of that which shall lead me
</p>
<p>back to you."
</p>
<p>" Do not forget to take that of Poitiers, and to go to
</p>
<p>Loudun to see your old tutor, our good Abb6 Quillet ;
</p>
<p>he will give you serviceable advice touching the court.
</p>
<p>He is on very good terms with the Due de Bouillon ;

<p>and besides, though he may not be very necessary to
</p>
<p>you, it is a mark of deference which you owe him."
</p>
<p>"Is it, then, to the siege of Perpignan that you are
</p>
<p>going?" asked the old mare'chal, who began to think
</p>
<p>that he had been silent a long time. " Ah ! it is well
</p>
<p>for you. Plague upon it ! a siege ! 't is an excellent
</p>
<p>opening. I would have given much to have assisted the
</p>
<p>late king at a siege, upon my arrival in his court ; it

<p>would have been better to have been disembowelled then

<p>THE ADIEU. 15
</p>
<p>than at a tourney, as I was. But we were at peace ;
</p>
<p>and I was compelled to go and pistol the Turks with the
</p>
<p>Rosworm of the Hungarians, in order that I might not
</p>
<p>afflict my family by my idleness. For the rest, may his
</p>
<p>Majesty receive you as amiably as his father received
</p>
<p>me ! It is true that the king is brave and good ; but
</p>
<p>they have unfortunately taught him that old Spanish eti-
</p>
<p>quette which arrests all the impulses of the heart. He
</p>
<p>restrains himself and others by an immovable presence
</p>
<p>and look of ice ; as for me, I confess that I am always
</p>
<p>waiting for the moment of thaw, but in vain. We were
</p>
<p>accustomed to other manners from the witty and simple-
</p>
<p>hearted Henri ; and we had at least the liberty to tell
</p>
<p>him that we loved him."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, with eyes fixed upon those of Bassom-
</p>
<p>pierre as if to force himself to attend to his discourse,
</p>
<p>asked him what was the manner of the late king in
</p>
<p>talking.
</p>
<p>" Lively and frank," said he. " Some time after my
</p>
<p>arrival in France, I played with him and with the
</p>
<p>Duchesse de Beaufort at Fontainebleau ; for he wished,
</p>
<p>he said, to win my gold-pieces, my fine Portugal bits.
</p>
<p>He asked me why I came into this country. ' I' faith,
</p>
<p>Sire,' said I, frankly, ' I came with no intention of en-
</p>
<p>listing myself in your service, but only with a mind to
</p>
<p>pass some time at your court, and afterwards at that of
</p>
<p>Spain ; but you have charmed me so much that instead
</p>
<p>of going farther, if you desire my service, I will devote
</p>
<p>myself to it till death.' Then he embraced me, and as-
</p>
<p>sured me that I could not find a better master, or one

</p>
<p>who would love me more. Alas ! I have found it so.
</p>
<p>16 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>And for my part, I sacrificed all to him, even my love ;
</p>
<p>and I would have done more, had it been possible to do
</p>
<p>more than renounce Mademoiselle de Montmorency."
</p>
<p>The good inare'chal had tears in his eyes ; but the
</p>
<p>young Marquis d'Effiat and the Italians, looking at
</p>
<p>each other, could not help smiling at thinking that at
</p>
<p>present the Princesse de Cond^ was very far from young
</p>
<p>and pretty. Cinq-Mars remarked this interchange of
</p>
<p>looks, and also smiled, but bitterly.
</p>
<p>" Is it then true," said he to himself, " that the affec-
</p>
<p>tions have the same destiny with the fashions, and that
</p>
<p>a few years can cast the same ridicule upon a costume
</p>
<p>and upon love ? Happy is he who does not survive his
</p>
<p>youth and his illusions, and who carries his treasure
</p>
<p>. with him to the grave ! "
</p>
<p>But again with effort breaking the melancholy course
</p>
<p>of his thoughts, and wishing that the good mare'chal
</p>
<p>should read nothing unpleasant upon the countenance
</p>
<p>of his hosts, he said,
</p>
<p>" People spoke, then, with much freedom to King
</p>
<p>Henri ? Perhaps, though, lie had need to assume that
</p>
<p>tone at the beginning of his reign ; but when he was
</p>
<p>master did he alter it?"
</p>
<p>" Never ; no, never, to his last day, did our great king
</p>
<p>cease to be the same. He did not blush at being a man,
</p>
<p>and spoke to men with vigor and sensibility. Ah ! I
</p>
<p>fancy I see him now, embracing the Due de Guise in
</p>
<p>his carriage, the very day of his death ; he had hit off
</p>
<p>one of his lively pleasantries to me, and the due said
</p>
<p>to him, ' You are, to my taste, one of the most agree-

<p>able men in the world, and our destiny ordained us for

</p>
<p>each other. For if you had been but an ordinary man, I
</p>
<p>should have taken you into my service at whatever
</p>
<p>price ; but since Heaven ordained that you should be
</p>
<p>born a great king, it has necessarily happened that I
</p>
<p>belong to you.' Oh, great man ! " cried Bassompierre,
</p>
<p>with tears in his eyes, and perhaps a little excited by
</p>
<p>the frequent bumpers he had drunk, " you said well,
</p>
<p>' When you have lost me you will learn my value.' "
</p>
<p>During this sally, the different persons at the table
</p>
<p>had assumed various attitudes, according to their posi-
</p>
<p>tion in public affairs. One of the Italians pretended to
</p>
<p>chat and laugh in a subdued manner with the young
</p>
<p>daughter of the marechale ; the other took care of the
</p>
<p>deaf old abbe", who, putting his hand behind his ear
</p>
<p>that he might hear, was the only one who seemed at-
</p>
<p>tentive. Cinq-Mars had sunk back into his melancholy
</p>
<p>abstraction, after having cast a glance at the mare'chal,
</p>
<p>as one looks aside after having thrown a tennis-ball
</p>
<p>until its return ; his eldest brother did the honors of the
</p>
<p>table with the same calm. Puy-Laurens watched the
</p>
<p>mistress of the house with attention ; he was devoted to
</p>
<p>the Due d'Orleans, and dreaded the cardinal. As for
</p>
<p>the mare'chale, she had an anxious and afflicted air.
</p>
<p>Inconsiderate words had often recalled the death of her
</p>
<p>husband or the departure of her son ; and oftener still,
</p>
<p>she feared lest Bassompierre should compromise him-
</p>
<p>self. And she had many times touched him, looking at
</p>
<p>the same time towards M. de Launay, whom she knew
</p>
<p>little of, and whom she had reason to believe devoted to
</p>
<p>the prime minister ; but to a man of his character, such
</p>
<p>warnings were useless. He appeared not to perceive

</p>
<p>them ; and on the contrary, crushing that gentleman with
</p>
<p>his bold looks and the sound of his voice, he affected
</p>
<p>to turn himself towards and to direct all his conversa-
</p>
<p>tion to him. As for the latter, he assumed an air of
</p>
<p>indifference and of assenting politeness, which he never
</p>
<p>abandoned until the moment when the folding-doors
</p>
<p>opened, and " Mademoiselle la Duchesse de Mantua "
</p>
<p>was announced.
</p>
<p>The conversation which we have transcribed so length-
</p>
<p>ily passed, however, rapidly ; and the dinner was but
</p>
<p>half over when the arrival of Marie de Gonzaga caused
</p>
<p>everybody to rise. She was small, but very well made,
</p>
<p>and although her eyes and her hair were black, her com-
</p>
<p>plexion was as dazzling as the beauty of her skin. The
</p>
<p>mare'chale arose to acknowledge her rank, and kissed
</p>
<p>her on the forehead, in recognition of her goodness and
</p>
<p>lovely age.
</p>
<p>" We have waited long for you to-day, dear Marie,"
</p>
<p>said she, placing her beside her ; " fortunately you re-
</p>
<p>main with me to replace one of my children, who is
</p>
<p>about to depart."
</p>
<p>The young duchesse blushed, dropped her head and
</p>
<p>her eyes, in order that no one might see their redness,
</p>
<p>and said in a timid voice,
</p>
<p>" Madame, that may well be, since you are to me in
</p>
<p>the place of a mother."
</p>
<p>And a glance made Cinq-Mars, at the other end of
</p>
<p>the table, turn pale.
</p>
<p>This arrival changed the conversation ; it ceased to
</p>
<p>be general, and each conversed in a low voice with

</p>
<p>the person next him. The mare'chal alone continued to
</p>
<p>THE ADIEU. 19
</p>
<p>utter a few sentences concerning the magnificence of
</p>
<p>the old court, his wars in Turkey, the tournaments,
</p>
<p>and the avarice of the new court ; but to his great 're-
</p>
<p>gret, no one took up his words, and the company were
</p>
<p>leaving the table, when the clock having struck two,
</p>
<p>five horses appeared in the courtyard. Four only were
</p>
<p>mounted by domestics, cloaked and armed ; the other
</p>
<p>horse, black and very spirited, was held by old Grand-
</p>
<p>champ, it was the steed of his master.
</p>
<p>" Ah, ah ! " exclaimed Bassompierre ; " see, there, our
</p>
<p>battle-horses saddled and bridled. Come, young man,
</p>
<p>we must say, with our old Marot,
</p>
<p>" ' Adieu la cour, adieu les dames !
</p>
<p>Adieu les filles et les femmes !
</p>
<p>Adieu vous dy pour quelque temps ;
</p>
<p>Adieu vos plaisants passe-temps !
</p>
<p>Adieu le bal, adieu la dance ;
</p>
<p>Adieu rnesure, adieu cadance,
</p>
<p>Tabourins, hautbois, violons,
</p>
<p>Puisqu'ii. la guerre nous aliens ! ' "
</p>
<p>These old verses and the air of the mare'chal made all
</p>
<p>the table laugh, save three persons.
</p>
<p>" Heavens ! " continued he, " it seems to me as if, like
</p>
<p>him, I were but seventeen years old ; he will return to
</p>
<p>us all embroidered. Madame, we must leave a chair
</p>
<p>vacant for him."
</p>
<p>Here the marechale grew suddenly pale, left the table
</p>
<p>suffused with tears, and every one rose with her ; she
</p>
<p>could only take two steps, and sank into another chair.
</p>
<p>Her sons and her daughter and the young duchesse

</p>
<p>came anxiously around her, and made out the follow-
</p>
<p>20 CINQ- MARS.
</p>
<p>ing words, amid the sighs and tears which she strove
</p>
<p>to restrain : -
</p>
<p>" Pardon, my friends ! it is foolish of me childish;
</p>
<p>but 1 am weak at present, and am not mistress of my-
</p>
<p>self. We were thirteen at table ; and you, my dear
</p>
<p>duchesse, were the cause of it. But it is very wrong of
</p>
<p>me to show so much weakness before him. Farewell, my
</p>
<p>child ; give me your forehead to kiss, and may God con-
</p>
<p>duct you ! Be worthy of your name* and of your father."
</p>
<p>Then, as Homer says, smiling under tears, she raised
</p>
<p>herself, pushed him from her, and said :
</p>
<p>" Come, let us see you on horseback, fair sir."
</p>
<p>The silent traveller kissed the hand of his mother, and
</p>
<p>afterwards made a low bow to her ; he also bowed to the
</p>
<p>duchesse, without raising his eyes. Then, embracing his
</p>
<p>elder brother, pressing the hand of the marechal, and
</p>
<p>kissing the forehead of his young sister almost simulta-
</p>
<p>neously, he went forth, and was on horseback in an
</p>
<p>instant. Every one went to the windows which over-
</p>
<p>looked the court, except Madame d'Effiat, who was
</p>
<p>still seated and suffering.
</p>
<p>" He departs at full gallop. That is a good sign,"
</p>
<p>said the mare'chal, laughing.
</p>
<p>" Oh, God ! " cried the young princess, retiring from
</p>
<p>the bay-window.
</p>
<p>" What is the matter ? " said the mother.
</p>
<p>" Nothing, nothing ! " said M. de Launay. " Your son's
</p>
<p>horse stumbled under the gateway ; but he soon pulled
</p>
<p>him up. See, he salutes us from the road."
</p>
<p>" Another ominous presage ! " said the marquise, upon

<p>THE ADIEU. 21
</p>
<p>Every one imitated her by being silent or speaking
</p>
<p>low.
</p>
<p>The day was mournful and the supper in the evening
</p>
<p>silent at the chateau of Cb.au mont.
</p>
<p>At ten o'clock in the evening, the old mare'chal, con-
</p>
<p>ducted by his valet, retired to the northern tower near
</p>
<p>the gateway, and opposite to the river. The heat was
</p>
<p>extreme ; he opened the window, and enveloping himself
</p>
<p>in his great silk robe, placed a heavy candlestick upon
</p>
<p>the table, and desired to be left alone. His window
</p>
<p>looked out upon the plain, which the moon, in her first
</p>
<p>quarter, indistinctly lighted ; the sky was charged with
</p>
<p>heavy clouds, and all things disposed the mind to mel-
</p>
<p>ancholy. Although Bassompierre had nothing of the
</p>
<p>dreamer in his character, the turn which the conversa-
</p>
<p>tion had taken at dinner came to his memory, and he
</p>
<p>began to reconsider the course of his life, the mournful
</p>
<p>changes which the new reign had wrought in it, a reign
</p>
<p>which seemed to have breathed upon him a wind of mis-
</p>
<p>fortune, the death of a cherished sister ; the irregular-
</p>
<p>ities of the heir of his name ; the loss of his lands and
</p>
<p>of his favor at court ; the recent end of his friend, the
</p>
<p>Mare'chal d'Effiat, whose chambers he now occupied.
</p>
<p>All these thoughts drew from him an involuntary sigh,
</p>
<p>and he placed himself at the window to breathe.
</p>
<p>At this moment he thought he heard the tramp of a
</p>
<p>troop of horse at the side of the wood ; but the wind,
</p>
<p>which was rising, made him conclude that he had been
</p>
<p>mistaken, and the noise suddenly ceasing, he forgot it.
</p>
<p>He still watched for some time all the lights of the

<p>chateau, which became successively extinguished, after
</p>
<p>22 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>having wound among the windows of the staircases and
</p>
<p>rambled about the courtyards and the stables ; after-
</p>
<p>wards, falling back in his great tapestried armchair, his
</p>
<p>elbow resting on the table, he abandoned himself to his
</p>
<p>reflections. And after a while, drawing from his breast
</p>
<p>a medallion which hung concealed, suspended by a black
</p>
<p>ribbon, he said,
</p>
<p>u Come, my good old master, talk with me as you have
</p>
<p>so often done ; come, great king, forget your court for
</p>
<p>the smile of a true friend ; come, great man, consult me
</p>
<p>concerning ambitious Austria ; come, inconstant cheva-
</p>
<p>lier, speak to me of the lightness of thy love, and of the
</p>
<p>fidelity of thine inconstancy ; come, heroic soldier, com-
</p>
<p>plain to me again that I balk you in the combat. Ah,
</p>
<p>have I not done it in Paris ? Why did I not receive thy
</p>
<p>wound ? With thy blood the world has lost the benefits
</p>
<p>of thine interrupted reign "
</p>
<p>The tears of the mardchal obscured the glass which
</p>
<p>covered the large medallion, and he was effacing them
</p>
<p>with respectful kisses, when, his door being roughly
</p>
<p>opened, he seized upon his sword.
</p>
<p>" Who goes there ? " cried he, in his surprise, which
</p>
<p>was much increased when he saw M. de Lauriay, who,
</p>
<p>hat in hand, advanced towards him, and said to him
</p>
<p>with embarrassment,
</p>
<p>" Sir, it is with a heart pierced with grief that I am
</p>
<p>forced to tell you that the king has commanded me to
</p>
<p>arrest you. A carriage awaits you at the gate, attended
</p>
<p>by thirty of the cardinal-due's musketeers."
</p>
<p>Bassompierre had not risen ; and he still held the

<p>medallion in his right hand, and the sword in the other.
</p>
<p>THE ADIEU. 23
</p>
<p>He tendered it disdainfully to this man, and said to
</p>
<p>him,
</p>
<p>" Sir, I know that I have lived too long, and it is that
</p>
<p>of which I was thinking ; it is in the name of the great
</p>
<p>Henri that I restore this sword peacefully to his son.
</p>
<p>Follow me."
</p>
<p>He accompanied these words with a look so firm that
</p>
<p>De Launay was depressed, and followed him with droop-
</p>
<p>ing head, as if he had himself been arrested by the noble
</p>
<p>old man, who, seizing a, flambeau, issued from the court
</p>
<p>and found all the doors opened by horse-guards, who
</p>
<p>had terrified the people of the chateau in the name of
</p>
<p>the king, and commanded silence. The carriage was
</p>
<p>ready, and departed rapidly, followed by many horses.
</p>
<p>The inarechal, seated beside M. de Launay, began to
</p>
<p>sleep, rocked by the movement of the vehicle, when a
</p>
<p>voice cried to the driver, " Stop ! " and as he continued,
</p>
<p>a pistol-shot followed. The horses stopped.
</p>
<p>" I declare, sir, that this is done without my participa-
</p>
<p>tion," said Bassompierre. Then putting his head out at
</p>
<p>the door, he saw that they were in a little wood, and a
</p>
<p>road too narrow to allow of the horses passing to the
</p>
<p>right or to the left of the carriage, a great advantage
</p>
<p>for the aggressors, since the musketeers could not ad-
</p>
<p>vance ; he tried to see what was going on when a cavalier,
</p>
<p>having in his hand a long sword, with which he parried
</p>
<p>the strokes of the guard, approached the door, crying,
</p>
<p>" Come, come, M. le Mare'chal ! "
</p>
<p>" What ! is that you, you madcap, Henri, who are
</p>
<p>playing these pranks? Sirs, sirs, let him alone; he

<p>is a mere bov."
</p>
<p>24 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>And De Launay, having culled to the musketeers to
</p>
<p>cease, had time to look about him.
</p>
<p>" And how the devil came you here ? " cried Bassom-
</p>
<p>pierre. " 1 thought you were at Tours, or even farther,
</p>
<p>if you had done your duty ; but here you are returned
</p>
<p>to make a fool of yourself."
</p>
<p>" Truly, it was not for you I returned, but for a secret
</p>
<p>affair," said Cinq-Mars, in a lower tone ; " but as I take
</p>
<p>it, they are going to introduce you to the Bastille, I 'in
</p>
<p>sure you will not betray me, for that delightful edifice is
</p>
<p>the very Temple of Discretion. Yet had you thought
</p>
<p>fit," he continued, aloud. ;t I would have released you
</p>
<p>from these gentlemen in the wood here, which is so thick
</p>
<p>that their horses would not have been able to stir. A
</p>
<p>peasant informed me of the insult passed upon us, more
</p>
<p>than upon you, by this violation of my father's house."
</p>
<p>" It is the king's order, my son, and we must respect
</p>
<p>his will ; reserve this ardor for his service, though I
</p>
<p>thank you with all my heart. Now adieu, and let me
</p>
<p>proceed on my agreeable journey."
</p>
<p>De Launay interposed, " I may inform you, M. de
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, that I have been desired by the king himself
</p>
<p>to assure M. le Mardchal that he is deeply afflicted at the
</p>
<p>step he has found it necessary thus to take, and that it
</p>
<p>is solely from an apprehension that M. le Mare'chal may
</p>
<p>be led into evil that his Majesty requests him to reside
</p>
<p>for a few days in the Bastille." 1
</p>
<p>Bassompierre turned his head with a hearty laugh to

</p>
<p>" I will go, then," said Henri ; u this is the last time
</p>
<p>I shall play the knight-errant for people against their
</p>
<p>will ; " and re-entering the wood as the carriage dashed
</p>
<p>off at full speed, he proceeded along by by-paths towards
</p>
<p>the castle, followed at a short distance by Grandchamp
</p>
<p>and his small escort.
</p>
<p>On reaching the foot of the western tower, he pulled
</p>
<p>in his horse. He did not alight, but approaching so near
</p>
<p>the wall that he could rest his foot upon an abutment, he
</p>
<p>stood up, and raised the blind of a window on the ground-
</p>
<p>floor.
</p>
<p>It was now past midnight, and the moon was hidden
</p>
<p>behind the clouds. No one but a member of the family
</p>
<p>could have found his way through so profound an obscu-
</p>
<p>rity. The towers and the roof formed one dark mass,
</p>
<p>which stood out in but indistinct relief upon the sky,
</p>
<p>scarcely less dark ; no light shone throughout the cha-
</p>
<p>teau, all whose inmates seemed buried in slumber. Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, enveloped in a large cloak, and his face hidden
</p>
<p>under the broad brim of his hat, awaited in suspense a
</p>
<p>reply to his signal.
</p>
<p>It came ; a soft voice was heard from within,
</p>
<p>" Is that you, M. de Cinq-Mars ? "
</p>
<p>" Alas, who else should it be ? Who else would return
</p>
<p>like a malefactor to his paternal house, without entering
</p>
<p>it, without bidding one more adieu to his mother ? Who
</p>
<p>else would return to complain of the present, without a
</p>
<p>hope from the future, but I ? "
</p>
<p>The gentle voice replied, but its tones were agitated,
</p>
<p>and perceptibly accompanied with tears, " Alas, Henri,

</p>
<p>of what do you complain ? Have I not already done
</p>
<p>26 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>more, far more than I ought to have done ? It is not my
</p>
<p>fault, but my misfortune, that my father was a sovereign
</p>
<p>prince. One cannot choose one's birthplace or one's
</p>
<p>rank. Yet how miserable is the lot of princesses ! From
</p>
<p>the cradle, the sentiments of the heart are prohibited to
</p>
<p>them ; and when they have advanced beyond childhood,
</p>
<p>they are ceded like a town, and must not even weep.
</p>
<p>Since I have known you, what have I not done to bring
</p>
<p>my future life within the reach of happiness, in removing
</p>
<p>it far from a throne ? For two years I have struggled in
</p>
<p>vain, at once against my evil fortune, that separates me
</p>
<p>from you, and against you, who estrange me from the
</p>
<p>duty I owe to my family. I have sought to diffuse a be-
</p>
<p>lief that I was dead ; I have almost sighed for revolu-
</p>
<p>tions. I should have blessed a change which deprived
</p>
<p>me of my rank, as I thanked Heaven when my father
</p>
<p>was dethroned ; but the court wonders at my absence ;
</p>
<p>the queen requires me to attend her. Our dreams are at
</p>
<p>an end, Henri ; we have already slumbered too long. Let
</p>
<p>us awake, and courageously think no more of those dear
</p>
<p>two years, forget all in the one recollection of our great
</p>
<p>resolve. Have but one thought ; be ambitious for be
</p>
<p>ambitious for my sake."
</p>
<p>" Must we, then, indeed, forget all, Marie ? " murmured
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>She hesitated.
</p>
<p>" Yes, forget all that I myself have forgotten."
</p>
<p>Then after a moment's pause she resumed with earnest-
</p>
<p>ness, "Yes, forget our happy days together, our long
</p>
<p>evenings, even our walks by the lake and through the

</p>
<p>father was marechal. Be you more ; be you constable,

</p>
<p>loved "
</p>
<p>" Beloved forever ? " said Henri.
</p>
<p>" Forever, here and hereafter."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, tremulously extending his hand to the
</p>
<p>window, exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Well, then, I swear, Marie, by the Virgin, whose
</p>
<p>name you bear, that you shall be mine, or my head
</p>
<p>shall fall on the scaffold!"
</p>
<p>" Oh, Heaven ! what is't you say ?" she cried, taking
</p>
<p>his hand in her own. " Swear to me that you will share
</p>
<p>in no guilty efforts ; that you will never forget that the
</p>
<p>King of France is your master. Ever love him next to
</p>
<p>her who will sacrifice all for you, who will await you
</p>
<p>amid suffering and sorrow. Take this little gold cross
</p>
<p>and wear it upon your heart ; it has often been wet with
</p>
<p>my tears, and those tears will flow still more bitterly
</p>
<p>if ever you are culpable towards the king. Give me the
</p>
<p>ring I see on your finger. Oh, heavens, my hand and
</p>
<p>yours are red with blood ! "
</p>
<p>" Oh, a scratch. Did you hear nothing, some hour
</p>
<p>ago?"
</p>
<p>" No ; but listen. Hear you nothing now ? "
</p>
<p>" No, Marie, nothing but some bird of night on the
</p>
<p>tower."
</p>
<p>" I heard whispering near us, I am sure. But whence
</p>
<p>this blood ? Tell me and then depart."
</p>
<p>" Yes, I will go, while the clouds are still dark above
</p>
<p>us. Farewell, celestial creature ; in my hour of danger

</p>
<p>" And forget not mine."
</p>
<p>" Can they ever be separated ? "
</p>
<p>" Never," exclaimed Marie, passionately, " but by
</p>
<p>death."
</p>
<p>" Alas, I fear absence still more," said Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" Farewell ! 1 tremble ; farewell ! " repeated the be-
</p>
<p>loved voice, and the window was slowly drawn down,
</p>
<p>the joined hands not .parting till the latest instant.

<p>The black courser had all the while been pawing the

<p>earth, and tossing back his noble head with impatience.

<p>Cinq-Mars, as agitated and restless as his horse, gave it

<p>the rein ; and the whole party was speedily under the
</p>
<p>walls of Tours. To the infinite discomfiture of old

<p>THE STREET.

<p>Je m'avan^ais d'un pas penible et mal assure vers le but de ce
</p>
<p>convoi tragique. NODIER, Smarra.
</p>
<p>THE reign a few years of which we are about to paint
</p>
<p>a reign of feebleness, which was, as it were, an eclipse
</p>
<p>of the crown between Henri IV. and Louis le Grand
</p>
<p>afflicts the eyes which contemplate it with more than
</p>
<p>one dark stain of blood, and these not all the work of
</p>
<p>one man, but participated in by great and grave bodies.
</p>
<p>It is melancholy to observe in this age, still full of dis-
</p>
<p>order, that the clergy, like a nation, had its populace, as
</p>
<p>it had its nobility, its ignorant and its criminal prelates,
</p>
<p>as well as its learned and virtuous prelates. Since that
</p>
<p>period, its remnant of barbarism has been refined away
</p>
<p>by the long reign of Louis XIV., and its corruptions
</p>
<p>washed out in the blood of the martyrs whom it offered
</p>
<p>up to the revolution of 1793.

</p>
<p>We felt it necessary to pause for a moment to ex-
</p>
<p>30 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>press this reflection ere we entered upon the recital of
</p>
<p>the facts presented by the history of the period, and
</p>
<p>to intimate that notwithstanding this consolatory re-
</p>
<p>flection, we have found it incumbent upon us to pass
</p>
<p>over many details too odious to occupy a place in our
</p>
<p>pages, groaning but too heavily in spirit at those guilty
</p>
<p>acts which it was necessary to give, as in relating the
</p>
<p>life of a virtuous old man, we should lament over the
</p>
<p>impetuosities of his passion-led youth, or over the cor-
</p>
<p>rupt tendencies of his riper age.
</p>
<p>When the cavalcade entered the narrow streets of
</p>
<p>Loudun, they heard unusual noises all around them.
</p>
<p>The streets themselves were filled with agitated masses ;
</p>
<p>the bells of the church and of the convent were ringing
</p>
<p>furiously, as though they were warning one-half the
</p>
<p>town that the other half was in flames ; and the whole
</p>
<p>population, without paying the least attention to the
</p>
<p>travellers, was pressing tumultuously towards a large
</p>
<p>edifice that adjoined the church. Here and there large
</p>
<p>crowds were collected together, listening in silence to
</p>
<p>some voice that seemed raised in exhortation, or engaged
</p>
<p>in emphatic reading ; anon, furious cries, mingled with
</p>
<p>pious exclamations, would arise from the crowd, which,
</p>
<p>then dispersing, showed the travellers that the orator
</p>
<p>was some Capuchin or Franciscan friar, who, a wooden
</p>
<p>crucifix in one hand, with the other pointed to the
</p>
<p>large building which was attracting such universal
</p>
<p>interest.
</p>
<p>" Jesu Maria ! " exclaimed an old woman, ' who could
</p>
<p>ever have thought that the Evil Spirit would choose our

</p>
<p>"Ay, or that the pious Ursulines should be pos-
</p>
<p>sessed ? " said another.
</p>
<p>" They say that the demon who torments the superior
</p>
<p>is called Legion," cried a third.
</p>
<p>" One, say you ? " interrupted a nun ; " there were
</p>
<p>seven in her poor body, whereunto, doubtless, she had
</p>
<p>attached too much importance, by reason of its great
</p>
<p>beauty, though now 't is but the receptacle of evil spirits.
</p>
<p>The prior of the Carmelites yesterday expelled the demon
</p>
<p>Eazas through her mouth ; and the reverend Father
</p>
<p>Lactantius has driven out in like manner the demon
</p>
<p>Beherit. But the other five have refused to stir, and
</p>
<p>when the holy exorcists, (whom Heaven support !) sum-
</p>
<p>moned them in Latin to withdraw, they replied inso-
</p>
<p>lently that they would not go till they had thoroughly
</p>
<p>given proof of their power, to the conviction even of
</p>
<p>the Huguenots and heretics, who, misbelieving wretches,
</p>
<p>seem to doubt it. The demon Elimi, the worst of them
</p>
<p>all, as you know, has threatened to take off M. de Lau-
</p>
<p>bardemont's calotte to-day, and dangle it in the air at

</p>
<p>" Holy Virgin ! " rejoined the first speaker, " I'm all
</p>
<p>of a tremble as it is ! And to think that I've over
</p>
<p>and over again got this magician Urbain to say
</p>
<p>masses for me ! "
</p>
<p>"Ay," exclaimed a girl, crossing herself; " and I who
</p>
<p>confessed to him ten months ago! No doubt in the
</p>
<p>world I should have been possessed myself, but for
</p>
<p>the relic of Saint Genevieve I luckily had about me,

</p>
<p>" Luckily, indeed, Martine," interposed a fat gossip ;
</p>
<p>32 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" for, no offence, you, as I remember, were long enough
</p>
<p>with the handsome sorcerer."
</p>
<p>" Pshaw ! " laughingly said a young soldier, who had
</p>
<p>joined the group, smoking his pipe, " there was no luck
</p>
<p>in the matter ; only, you see, pretty Martine was dis-
</p>
<p>possessed a month ago."
</p>
<p>The girl hlushed, and drew the hood of her black
</p>
<p>cloak over her face. The elder gossips cast a glance of
</p>
<p>indignation at the reckless trooper, and finding them-
</p>
<p>selves now close to the door of the building, and thus
</p>
<p>sure of making their way in among the first when it
</p>
<p>should be thrown open, sat down upon the stone bench at
</p>
<p>the side, and by an interchange of the latest wonders,
</p>
<p>raised the expectations of all as to the delight they
</p>
<p>were about to have in being spectators of something
</p>
<p>marvellous, an apparition, perhaps, but at the very
</p>
<p>least, an administration of the torture.
</p>
<p>" Is it true, Aunt," asked Martine of the eldest gossip,
</p>
<p>" that you have heard the demons speak ? "
</p>
<p>" Ay, child, true as I see you ; there are many and
</p>
<p>many can say the same ; and 't was to convince you
</p>
<p>of it I brought you with me here, that you may see the
</p>
<p>power of the Evil One, and be edified."
</p>
<p>"What voice has he?" continued the girl, glad to
</p>
<p>encourage a conversation which diverted from herself
</p>
<p>the invidious attention procured her by the soldier's
</p>
<p>raillery.
</p>
<p>" Oh, he speaks with the voice of the superior herself,
</p>
<p>to whom our Lady be gracious ! Poor young woman !

<p>to see her writhing about and tearing herself and turn-
</p>
<p>THE STREET. 33
</p>
<p>ing her arms and her legs first one way and then an-
</p>
<p>other, and then, all of a sudden, twisting them together
</p>
<p>behind her back. When the holy Father Lactantius
</p>
<p>pronounced the name of Urbain Grandier, the foam
</p>
<p>came out of her mouth, and she talked Latin for all the
</p>
<p>world as though she were reading the Bible. Of course,
</p>
<p>I did not understand what she said, and all I can re-
</p>
<p>member of it now is, ' Urbanus Magicus rosas diabolica,'
</p>
<p>which they tell me means that the magician Urbain had
</p>
<p>bewitched her with some roses the Devil had given
</p>
<p>him ; and so it must have been, for while Father Lac-
</p>
<p>tantius spoke, there came out of her ears and neck a
</p>
<p>quantity of flame-colored roses, all smelling of sulphur
</p>
<p>so strongly that the judge-advocate called out for every
</p>
<p>one present to stop their noses and eyes, for that the
</p>
<p>demons were about to come out."
</p>
<p>" Ah, look ye there now ! " exclaimed with shrill
</p>
<p>voices and a triumphant air the whole bevy of assem-
</p>
<p>bled women, turning towards the crowd, and more
</p>
<p>particularly towards a group of men attired in black,
</p>
<p>among whom was standing the young soldier who had
</p>
<p>just before so unceremoniously jested with Martine.
</p>
<p>" Hear the noisy old idiots ! " exclaimed the soldier.
</p>
<p>" They think they 're at the Sabbat ; but I don't see their
</p>
<p>broomsticks."
</p>
<p>" Young man, young man ! " said a citizen, with a
</p>
<p>mournful air, " jest not upon such subjects in the open
</p>
<p>air, or in such a time as this, the wind of Heaven may
</p>
<p>become gushing flames and devour you."
</p>
<p>" Bah ! a fig for your exorcists ! " returned the soldier ;

<p>better spirit-sprinkler than the whole set of you can
</p>
<p>produce."
</p>
<p>And significantly grasping the handle of his rapier in
</p>
<p>one hand, with the other he turned up his light-brown
</p>
<p>mustache, as he looked fiercely around ; but meeting
</p>
<p>no glance which returned the defiance of his own, he
</p>
<p>slowly withdrew, left foot foremost, and sauntered along
</p>
<p>the dark narrow streets with all the reckless noncha-
</p>
<p>lance of a young soldier who has just donned his uni-
</p>
<p>form, and true military contempt for all who wear not
</p>
<p>the cloth.
</p>
<p>Meantime some eight or ten of the more considerable
</p>
<p>and more rational inhabitants of the town traversed in
</p>
<p>a body, slowly and silently, the agitated throng ; they
</p>
<p>seemed overwhelmed with painful amazement at the agi-
</p>
<p>tation and excitement they witnessed in every direction,
</p>
<p>and as each new instance of the popular frenzy pre-
</p>
<p>sented itself, they interchanged glances of wonder and
</p>
<p>apprehension. Their mute depression communicated its
</p>
<p>uneasiness to the working people, and to the peasants
</p>
<p>who had flocked in crowds from the adjacent country,
</p>
<p>and who all sought a direction for their opinions in the
</p>
<p>countenances of the principal townsmen, also for the
</p>
<p>most part proprietors of the surrounding districts; they
</p>
<p>saw there that something calamitous was on foot, and
</p>
<p>resorted accordingly to the only remedy open to the
</p>
<p>ignorant and the beguiled, apathetic resignation.
</p>
<p>Yet there is in the character of the French peasant a
</p>
<p>certain scoffing finesse of which he makes effective use,
</p>
<p>sometimes with his equals, and almost invariably with

<p>his superiors. He puts questions to power as embar-
</p>
<p>THE STREET. 35
</p>
<p>rassing as are those which infancy puts to mature age.
</p>
<p>He affects the very excess of humility, in order to con-
</p>
<p>fuse him whom he addresses with the very height of his
</p>
<p>isolated elevation. He aggravates the awkwardness of
</p>
<p>his manner and the rudeness of his expressions, as a
</p>
<p>means of covering his real thoughts under the appear-
</p>
<p>ance of mere uncouthness ; yet, despite all his self-
</p>
<p>command, there is something in his air, certain fierce
</p>
<p>contortions of countenance, which betray him to the
</p>
<p>close observer, who discerns in his sardonic smile, and
</p>
<p>the marked emphasis with which he leans on his long
</p>
<p>staff, the hopes that secretly nourish his soul, and the
</p>
<p>aid upon which he ultimately relies.
</p>
<p>One of the most venerable of the peasants whom we
</p>
<p>have indicated came vigorously on, followed by ten or
</p>
<p>twelve young men, his sons and nephews, all wearing
</p>
<p>the broad-brimmed hat and the blue frock or blouse of
</p>
<p>the ancient Gauls, which the peasants of France still
</p>
<p>wear over their other garments, as peculiarly adapted to
</p>
<p>their humid climate and their laborious habits.
</p>
<p>When the old man had made his way to the group of
</p>
<p>personages of whom we have just spoken, he took off his
</p>
<p>hat, an example immediately followed by his whole
</p>
<p>family, and showed a face darkened with exposure to
</p>
<p>the weather, a forehead bald and wrinkled with age, and
</p>
<p>long white hair hanging behind. His shoulders were
</p>
<p>bent with years and labor, but he was still a hale and
</p>
<p>sturdy man. He was received with an air of welcome
</p>
<p>and even of respect by one of the gravest of the grave
</p>
<p>group he had approached, who, without, however, un-

<p>" What ! good Father Guillaume Leroux ! " said he,

<p>" and have you too left our farm of La Chena'ie to visit

<p>though your oxen were to unharness themselves and go

<p>a hunting, quitting their work to see a poor hare run
</p>
<p>down ! "
</p>
<p>"Faith, M. le Comte du Lude," replied the farmer,
</p>
<p>" for that matter, sometimes the hare runs into our way
</p>
<p>of itself ; but, in truth, I 've got a notion that some of
</p>
<p>the people here want to make fools of us, and so I 've
</p>
<p>come to see the rights of it."
</p>
<p>" Enough of that, my friend," returned the comte ;
</p>
<p>" here is M. Fournier, the advocate, who assuredly will
</p>
<p>not deceive you, for he resigned his office of attorney-
</p>
<p>general last night that he might henceforth devote his
</p>
<p>eloquence to the service of his own noble thoughts. You
</p>
<p>will hear him, perhaps, to-day, though truly, I dread his
</p>
<p>appearing for his own sake as much as I desire it for
</p>
<p>that of the accused."
</p>
<p>" I care not for myself," said Fournier ; " truth is with
</p>
<p>me a passion, and I would have it inculcated in all times
</p>
<p>and all places."
</p>
<p>He that spoke was a young man, whose face, pallid in
</p>
<p>the extreme, was full of the noblest expression. His
</p>
<p>blond hair, his light-blue eyes, his thinness, the delicacy
</p>
<p>of his frame made him at first sight seem younger
</p>
<p>than he was; but his thoughtful and earnest counte-
</p>
<p>nance indicated that mental superiority and that preco-
</p>
<p>cious maturity of the soul which are developed by deep
</p>
<p>study in youth, combined with natural energy of char-

<p>acter. He was attired wholly in black, with a short
</p>
<p>THE STREET. 37
</p>
<p>cloak in the fashion of the times, and carried under his
</p>
<p>left arm a roll of papers, which, when speaking, he would
</p>
<p>take in the right hand and grasp convulsively, as a war-
</p>
<p>rior in his anger grasps the pommel of his sword. At
</p>
<p>one moment it seemed as though he were about to un-
</p>
<p>furl the scroll, and from it hurl lightning upon those
</p>
<p>whom he pursued with looks of fiery indignation, three
</p>
<p>Capuchins and a Franciscan, who had passed by.
</p>
<p>"Pere Guillaume," pursued M. du Lude, "how is it
</p>
<p>you have brought with you only your sons, and they
</p>
<p>armed with their staves ? "
</p>
<p>"Faith, sir, I have no desire that our girls should
</p>
<p>learn to dance of the nuns ; and, moreover, just now the
</p>
<p>lads with their staves may bestir themselves to better
</p>
<p>purpose than their sisters would."
</p>
<p>" Take my advice, my old friend," said the comte,
</p>
<p>" and don't bestir yourselves at all ; rather stand quietly
</p>
<p>aside to view the procession which you see approaching,
</p>
<p>and remember that you are seventy."
</p>
<p>" Ah, ah ! " murmured the old man, drawing up his
</p>
<p>twelve sons in double rank, soldier-fashion, " I fought
</p>
<p>under good King Henriot, and can play at sword and
</p>
<p>pistol as well as the worthy ligueurs ; " and shaking
</p>
<p>his head he leaned against a post, his knotty staff be-
</p>
<p>tween his crossed legs, his hands clasped on its thick
</p>
<p>butt-end, and his white bearded chin resting on his
</p>
<p>hands. Then, half closing his eyes, he seemed ab-
</p>
<p>sorbed in recollections of his early life.
</p>
<p>The bystanders observed with interest his dress,
</p>
<p>striped in the fashion of Henri IV., and his resemblance

<p>to the Be*arnese monarch in the latter years of his life,
</p>
<p>38 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>though the king's hair had been prevented by the assas-
</p>
<p>sin's stroke from acquiring the whiteness which that of
</p>
<p>the old peasant had placidly attained. A furious peal-
</p>
<p>ing of the bells, however, attracted the general attention
</p>
<p>to the end of the great street, down which was seen filing
</p>
<p>a long procession, whose banners and glittering pikes
</p>
<p>rose above the heads of the crowd, which successively
</p>
<p>and in silence opened a way for the at once absurd and
</p>
<p>awful train.
</p>
<p>First, two and two, came a body of archers, with
</p>
<p>pointed beards and large plumed hats, armed with long
</p>
<p>halberds, who, ranging in a single file on each side of
</p>
<p>the centre of the street, formed an avenue along which
</p>
<p>marched in solemn order a procession of Gray Peni-
</p>
<p>tents, men attired in a long gray robe, the hood of
</p>
<p>which entirely covered the head, a mask of the same
</p>
<p>stuff terminating below the chin in a point, like a beard,
</p>
<p>having merely three holes in it for the eyes and nose.
</p>
<p>Even at the present day we see these costumes at fu-
</p>
<p>nerals, more especially in the Pyrenees. The Penitents
</p>
<p>of Loudun carried enormous wax candles, and their
</p>
<p>slow, uniform movement, and their eyes, which seemed
</p>
<p>to glitter under their masks, gave them the appearance
</p>
<p>of phantoms.
</p>
<p>The people expressed their various feelings in an
</p>
<p>undertone :
</p>
<p>u There 's many a knave hid under those masks," said
</p>
<p>a citizen.
</p>
<p>" Ay, and with a face uglier than the mask itself,"
</p>
<p>added a young man.

</p>
<p>" They make me afraid," tremulously exclaimed a girl.
</p>
<p>THE STREET. 39
</p>
<p>" I 'm only afraid for my purse," said the first speaker.
</p>
<p>" Ah, Jesu ! there are our holy brethren, the Peni-
</p>
<p>tents," cried an old woman, throwing back her hood, the
</p>
<p>better to look at them. " See you the banner they bear ?
</p>
<p>Ah, neighbors, 't is a joyful thing to have it among us !
</p>
<p>Beyond a doubt it will save us; see, it shows the Devil
</p>
<p>in flames, and a monk fastening a chain round his neck
</p>
<p>to keep him there. Ah, here come the judges, - worthy
</p>
<p>gentlemen ! dear gentlemen ! Look at their red robes ;
</p>
<p>how beautiful ! Blessed be the Virgin, they 've been
</p>
<p>well chosen ! "
</p>
<p>" Every man of them a personal enemy of the cure,"
</p>
<p>whispered the Comte du Lude to the advocate Fournier,
</p>
<p>who took a note of the information.
</p>
<p>"Don't you know them, neighbors?" pursued the
</p>
<p>shrill, sharp voice of the old woman, as she cuffed one
</p>
<p>and pinched another of those about her to attract their
</p>
<p>attention to the objects of her admiration ; " see, there's
</p>
<p>excellent M. Mignon, whispering to Messieurs the Coun-
</p>
<p>sellors of the court of Poitiers ; Heaven's blessings on
</p>
<p>them all, say I ! "
</p>
<p>" Ay, there are Roatin, Richard, and Chevalier,
</p>
<p>the very men who tried to have him dismissed a year
</p>
<p>ago," continued M. du Lude, in undertones, to the
</p>
<p>young advocate, who, surrounded and hidden from pub-
</p>
<p>lic observation by the group of dark -clad citizens, was
</p>
<p>writing down his observations in a note-book under
</p>
<p>his cloak.
</p>
<p>" Here ; look, look ! " screamed the old woman.
</p>
<p>" Make way ! here 's M. Barre, the Cure" of St. Jacques

<p>at Chinon."
</p>
<p>40 CIA'Q-MARS.
</p>
<p>" A saint ! " murmured one bystander.
</p>
<p>" A hypocrite ! " exclaimed a manly voice.
</p>
<p>" See how thin he is with fasting ! "
</p>
<p>" Sec how pale he is with remorse ! "
</p>
<p>" He 's the man to drive away devils ! "
</p>
<p>" Ay, but not till he 's quite done with them for his
</p>
<p>own purposes."
</p>
<p>The dialogue was interrupted by the general exclama-
</p>
<p>tion, " How beautiful she is ! "
</p>
<p>The superior of the Ursulines advanced, followed by
</p>
<p>all her nuns. Her white veil was raised ; in order that
</p>
<p>the people might witness the features of the possessed
</p>
<p>ones, it had been ordered that it should be thus with her
</p>
<p>and six of the sisterhood. Her attire had no distin-
</p>
<p>guishing feature, except an immense rosary extending
</p>
<p>from her neck nearly to her feet, and from which hung
</p>
<p>a gold cross ; but the dazzling pallor of her face, ren-
</p>
<p>dered still more conspicuous by the dark hue of her
</p>
<p>capuchon, at once fixed the general regard upon her.
</p>
<p>Her brilliant dark eyes, which bore the impress of some
</p>
<p>deep and burning passion, were crowned with brows so
</p>
<p>perfectly arched that Nature herself seemed to have
</p>
<p>taken as much pains to form them as the Circassian
</p>
<p>women to mark out theirs with artistic pencilling ; but
</p>
<p>between them a slight fold revealed the powerful agita-
</p>
<p>tion within. In her movements, however, and through-
</p>
<p>out her whole bearing, she affected an entire calm; her
</p>
<p>steps were slow and cadenced, and her beautiful hands
</p>
<p>were crossed on her bosom, as white and motionless as
</p>
<p>those of the marble statues joined in eternal prayer in

<p>monumental sculptures.

</p>
<p>" See, Aunt," ejaculated Martine ; " see how Sister
</p>
<p>Agnes and Sister Claire are weeping, next to the
</p>
<p>superior ! "
</p>
<p>" Ay, Niece, they weep because they are the prey of
</p>
<p>the demon."
</p>
<p>" Or rather," interposed the same manly voice we have
</p>
<p>already heard, " because they repent them of having
</p>
<p>mocked Heaven."
</p>
<p>A profound silence now pervaded the assembled mul-
</p>
<p>titude ; riot a word was heard, not a movement, scarcely
</p>
<p>a breath. Every one seemed paralyzed by some sudden
</p>
<p>enchantment, when, following the nuns, between four
</p>
<p>Penitents who held him in chains, appeared the cure* of
</p>
<p>the church of Ste. Croix, attired in his pastor's robe.
</p>
<p>His was a noble, fine face, with grandeur of mind in its
</p>
<p>whole expression, and gentleness in every feature ; af-
</p>
<p>fecting no scornful indifference to his position, he looked
</p>
<p>calmly and kindly around, as though he sought on his
</p>
<p>dark way the affectionate glances of those who loved
</p>
<p>him. Nor did he seek in vain ; ever and anon he en-
</p>
<p>countered those glances, and joyfully returned them.
</p>
<p>Nay, more, he heard sobs, and he saw hands extended
</p>
<p>towards him, hands, many of which grasped weapons.
</p>
<p>But no gesture of his encouraged these mute offers of
</p>
<p>physical aid ; he would lower his eyes to the ground,
</p>
<p>and wend on, careful not to compromise those who so
</p>
<p>trusted in him, or to involve them in the contagion of
</p>
<p>his own misfortunes. This was Urbain Grandier.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the procession stopped, at a signal from the
</p>
<p>man who brought up its van, and who seemed to com-

<p>mand its movements. He was tall, meagre, pale ; his
</p>
<p>42 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>dross was a long black robe, with a cap of the same
</p>
<p>material and color ; he had the face of a Don Basilio,
</p>
<p>with the eye of Nero. He motioned the guards to
</p>
<p>surround him more closely, when he saw with affright
</p>
<p>the dark group we have mentioned, and the strong-
</p>
<p>limbed and resolute peasants who seemed in attendance
</p>
<p>upon them. Then placing himself somewhat in advance
</p>
<p>of the canons and Capuchins who were with him, he
</p>
<p>pronounced in a shrill voice this singular decree :
</p>
<p>" We, Sieur de Laubardemont, referendan', being dele-
</p>
<p>gated and invested with discretionary power in the matter of
</p>
<p>the trial of the magician Urbain Grandier upon the various
</p>
<p>articles of accusation brought against him, assisted herein
</p>
<p>by the reverend Fathers Mignon, canon, Barre, cure of St.
</p>
<p>Jacques at Chinon, Father Lactantius, and all the other
</p>
<p>judges appointed to try the said magician, have preliminarily
</p>
<p>decreed as follows : Primo, the factitious assembly of pro-
</p>
<p>prietors, noble-citizens of this town and its environs, is dis-
</p>
<p>solved, as tending to a popular sedition ; its proceedings are
</p>
<p>declared null, and its letter to the king, against us the
</p>
<p>judges, which has been intercepted, shall be publicly burned
</p>
<p>in the market-place as calumniating the good Ursulines and
</p>
<p>the reverend fathers and judges. Secundo, it is forbidden to
</p>
<p>say, publicly or in private, that the said nuns are not pos-
</p>
<p>sessed by the Evil Spirit, or to doubt of the power of the
</p>
<p>exorcists, under pain of a fine of twenty thousand livres, and
</p>
<p>corporal punishment.
</p>
<p>" Let the bailiffs and sheriffs obe} r this. Given the 18th
</p>
<p>of June, in the year of grace 1639."

</p>
<p>murmurs that followed its proclamation, and amid

<p>which Laubardemorit urged forward the procession,
</p>
<p>which precipitately entered the great building already
</p>
<p>referred to, an ancient convent, whose interior having
</p>
<p>crumbled away, its walls now formed one vast hall,
</p>
<p>well adapted for the purpose to which it was about to
</p>
<p>be applied. Laubardemont did not deem himself safe
</p>
<p>until he was within the building and had heard the

<p>heavy double doors creak on their hinges as, closing,

<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>THE GOOD PRIEST.
</p>
<p>L'homme de paix me parla ainsi. VICAIRE SAVOYARD.
</p>
<p>Now that the diabolical procession is in the arena des-
</p>
<p>tined for its spectacle, and is arranging its gloomy and
</p>
<p>sanguinary representation, let us" inquire what Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars had been doing amid the agitated crowd. He
</p>
<p>was endowed by nature with great tact, and felt that
</p>
<p>it would be no easy matter for him to attain the object
</p>
<p>he had in view, of seeing the Abbe Quillet, at a time
</p>
<p>when the excitement of men's minds was at its height.
</p>
<p>He therefore remained on horseback with his four
</p>
<p>domestics in a small and very dark street that led
</p>
<p>into the main street, from which he could easily see all
</p>
<p>that passed. No one at first paid any attention to him;
</p>
<p>but when public curiosity had no other aliment, he
</p>
<p>became an object of general observation. Weary of so
</p>
<p>many scenes of excitement, the inhabitants looked upon

</p>
<p>him with some exasperation, and half aloud inquired
</p>
<p>THE GOOD PRIEST. 45
</p>
<p>of one another whether this was another exorcist come
</p>
<p>among them. Feeling that it was time to take a decided
</p>
<p>course, he advanced with his attendants, hat in hand,
</p>
<p>towards the group in black of whom we have spoken,
</p>
<p>and addressing him who appeared its most distinguished
</p>
<p>member, said, " Sir, where can I find M. l'Abb<$ Quillet?"
</p>
<p>At this name, all around regarded him with an air
</p>
<p>of terror, as though he had pronounced that of Lucifer.
</p>
<p>Yet no anger was exhibited ; on the contrary, it seemed
</p>
<p>that the question had operated a favorable change for
</p>
<p>him in the minds of all who heard him. Moreover,
</p>
<p>chance had served him well in his choice ; the Comte
</p>
<p>du Lude came up to his horse, and saluting him, said,
</p>
<p>" Dismount, sir, and I will give you some useful infor-
</p>
<p>mation regarding him."
</p>
<p>After having spoken a while in whispers, the two gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen separated with all the ceremonious politeness of
</p>
<p>the period. Cinq-Mars remounted his black horse, and
</p>
<p>passing through numerous narrow streets, was soon out
</p>
<p>of the crowd with his retinue.
</p>
<p>" How happy I am ! " he soliloquized, as he proceeded
</p>
<p>on his way ; " I shall, at all events, for a moment see
</p>
<p>the good and kind minister who brought me up ; even
</p>
<p>now I seem to have before me his features, his calm air,
</p>
<p>his voice so full of benevolence."
</p>
<p>As these thoughts ran through his mind, he found
</p>
<p>himself in the small and very dark street which had
</p>
<p>been indicated to him ; it was so narrow that the knee-
</p>
<p>pieces of his boots touched the wall on either side. At
</p>
<p>the end of the street he came to a wooden house of one

<p>story, and in his eagerness knocked with repeated strokes.
</p>
<p>46 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Who is there ? " cried a furious voice within ; and at
</p>
<p>the same moment, the door opening exhibited a little
</p>
<p>man, very short, very stout, and with a very red face,
</p>
<p>attired in a black suit, with an immense white ruff and
</p>
<p>riding-boots which engulfed his short legs in their vast
</p>
<p>depths. In his hands were a pair of horse pistols.
</p>
<p>" I will sell my life dearly ! " he cried ; " and "
</p>
<p>" Softly, Abbe", softly," said his pupil, taking his arm ;
</p>
<p>" we are friends."
</p>
<p>" Ah, my son, is it you ? " said the worthy man, let-
</p>
<p>ting fall his pistols, which were picked up by a domes-
</p>
<p>tic, also armed to the teeth. " What do you here ?
</p>
<p>The abomination has entered the town, and I only await
</p>
<p>the night to depart hence. Make haste in, my dear
</p>
<p>boy, with your people ; I took you for the archers of
</p>
<p>Laubardemont, and, i' faith, I was going to take a part
</p>
<p>somewhat out of my line. You see the horses in the
</p>
<p>courtyard there ; they will convey me to Italy, where
</p>
<p>I shall rejoin our friend, the Due de Bouillon. Jean !
</p>
<p>Jean ! hasten and close the great gate after these brave
</p>
<p>domestics, and recommend them not to make too much
</p>
<p>noise, although for that matter we have no habitation
</p>
<p>near us."
</p>
<p>Grandchamp obeyed the intrepid little abbe, who then
</p>
<p>embraced Cinq-Mars four consecutive times, raising him-
</p>
<p>self on the points of his boots, so as to attain the middle
</p>
<p>of his pupil's breast. He then hurried him into a small
</p>
<p>room, which looked like a deserted granary ; and seat-
</p>
<p>ing him beside himself upon a black leather trunk, he
</p>
<p>said with earnestness,

<p>" Well, my son, whither go you ? How came Madame
</p>
<p>THE GOOD PRIEST. 47
</p>
<p>la Mare'chale to let you come here ? See you not what
</p>
<p>they are doing against an unhappy man, whose death
</p>
<p>alone will content them ? Alas, merciful Heaven ! was
</p>
<p>this the first spectacle my dear pupil was to have before
</p>
<p>him ? And you at that delightful period of life when
</p>
<p>friendship, love, confidence, should alone encompass
</p>
<p>you ; when all around you should be of a nature to give
</p>
<p>you a favorable opinion of your species, at your very
</p>
<p>entry into the great world ! How unfortunate ! alas,
</p>
<p>why are you come ? "
</p>
<p>When the good abbe had followed up this lamenta-
</p>
<p>tion by affectionately pressing both hands of the young
</p>
<p>traveller in his own, so red and wrinkled, the latter at
</p>
<p>length answered,
</p>
<p>" Can you not guess, my dear abbe, that I came to

<p>Loudun because you were here ? As to the spectacle
</p>
<p>you speak of, it appears to me simply ridiculous ; and 1
</p>
<p>vow to you that I do not a whit the less on its account

<p>love that human race of which your virtues and your

<p>matter ; but answer me, whither go you, and for what ? "
</p>
<p>" I am going to Perpignan, where the cardinal-due is
</p>
<p>to present me to the king."
</p>
<p>At this the worthy but hasty abbe* rose from his box,
</p>
<p>and walked, or rather ran, up and down the room, stamp-
</p>
<p>ing. " The cardinal ! the cardinal ! " he repeated,
</p>
<p>almost choking, his face becoming scarlet, and the
</p>
<p>tears rising to his eyes ; " poor child ! they will destroy

<p>him! Ah, mon Dieu! what part would they have him
</p>
<p>48 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>play there. What would they with him ? Ah, who will
</p>
<p>protect thee, my son, in that dangerous place?" con-
</p>
<p>tinued he, reseating himself, and again taking his
</p>
<p>pupil's hands in his own with a paternal solicitude, as
</p>
<p>he endeavored to read his thoughts in his countenance.
</p>
<p>" Why, I do not exactly know," said Cinq-Mars, look-
</p>
<p>ing up at the ceiling; "but I suppose it will be the
</p>
<p>Cardinal de Richelieu, who was the friend of my father."
</p>
<p>" Ah, my dear Henri, you make me tremble ; he will
</p>
<p>ruin you unless you become his docile instrument.
</p>
<p>Alas, why cannot I go with you ? Why must I act the
</p>
<p>young man of twenty in this unfortunate affair ? Alas,
</p>
<p>I should be perilous to you ; I must, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>conceal myself. But you will have M. de Thou near
</p>
<p>you, my son, will you not ? " said he, trying to reas-
</p>
<p>sure himself ; " he was your friend in childhood, though
</p>
<p>somewhat older than yourself. Heed his counsels, my
</p>
<p>child, he is a wise young man ; he is a man of mature
</p>
<p>reflection, and of solid ideas."
</p>
<p>" Oh, yes, my dear abbe", you may depend upon my
</p>
<p>tender attachment for him ; I have never ceased to love
</p>
<p>him."
</p>
<p>" But you have ceased to write to him, have you not?"
</p>
<p>asked the good abbe", half smilingly.
</p>
<p>" I beg your pardon, my dear abbe*, I wrote to him
</p>
<p>once, and again yesterday, to inform him that the car-
</p>
<p>dinal has invited me to court."
</p>
<p>" How ! has he himself desired your presence ?"
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars hereupon showed the letter of the cardinal-
</p>
<p>due to his mother, and his old tutor grew gradually

<p>more tranquil.
</p>
<p>THE GOOD PRIEST. 49
</p>
<p>" Come, come ! " said he to himself, " this is not so
</p>
<p>bad, perhaps, after all. It looks promising; a captain
</p>
<p>of the guards at twenty, that sounds well ! " and the
</p>
<p>worthy abba's face actually became all smiles.
</p>
<p>The young man, delighted to see these smiles, which
</p>
<p>so harmonized with his own thoughts, fell upon the neck
</p>
<p>of the abb and embraced him, as though he had thus
</p>
<p>assured to him a futurity of pleasure, glory, and love.
</p>
<p>But the good abbe", with difficulty disengaging himself
</p>
<p>from this warm embrace, resumed his walk and his re-
</p>
<p>flections and his gravity. He often hemmed and shook
</p>
<p>his head ; and Cinq-Mars, not venturing to pursue the
</p>
<p>conversation, followed him with his eyes, and became
</p>
<p>sad as he saw him become serious.
</p>
<p>The old man at last sat down, and in a mournful tone
</p>
<p>addressed his pupil thus :
</p>
<p>" My friend, my son, I have for a moment yielded like
</p>
<p>a father to your hopes ; but I must tell you, and it is
</p>
<p>not to afflict you, that they appear to me excessive and
</p>
<p>unnatural. If the cardinal's sole aim were to show at-
</p>
<p>tachment and gratitude towards your family, he would
</p>
<p>not have carried his favors so far ; no, the extreme prob-
</p>
<p>ability is that he has designs upon you. From what
</p>
<p>has been told him he thinks you adapted to play some
</p>
<p>part, as yet impossible for us to divine, but which he
</p>
<p>himself has traced out in the deepest recesses of his
</p>
<p>mind. He would educate you up for this ; he would drill
</p>
<p>you into it. Allow me the expression in consideration
</p>
<p>of its accuracy, and think seriously of it when the time
</p>
<p>shall come. But still I am inclined to believe that as
</p>
<p>matters are you had better follow up this vein in the

<p>great mine of State ; it is thus that high fortunes have
</p>
<p>begun. You must only take heed not to be blinded and
</p>
<p>led at will. Let not favors make you giddy, my poor
</p>
<p>child, and let not elevation turn your head. Be not so
</p>
<p>indignant at the suggestion ; the thing has happened to
</p>
<p>older men than yourself. Write to me often, as well as
</p>
<p>to your mother ; see M. de Thou, and we will together
</p>
<p>try to keep you in good counsel. Now, my son, be good
</p>
<p>enough to close that window through which the wind
</p>
<p>comes upon my head, and I will tell you what has been
</p>
<p>going on here."
</p>
<p>Henri, trusting that the moral part of the discourse
</p>
<p>was over, and anticipating nothing in the second part
</p>
<p>but a narrative more or less interesting, closed the old
</p>
<p>casement, festooned with cobwebs, and resumed his seat
</p>
<p>without speaking.
</p>
<p>" Now that I reflect further," continued the abbe*, " I
</p>
<p>think it will not perhaps be unprofitable for you to have
</p>
<p>passed through this place, although it be a sad expe-
</p>
<p>rience you shall have acquired ; but it will supply what
</p>
<p>I may not have formerly told you of the wickedness of
</p>
<p>men. I hope, moreover, that the result will not be fatal,
</p>
<p>and that the letter we have written to the king will
</p>
<p>arrive in time."
</p>
<p>" I heard that it had been intercepted," interposed
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" Then all is over," said the Abb6 Quillet ; " the cur
</p>
<p>is lost. But listen. God forbid, my son, that I, your
</p>
<p>old tutor, should seek to assail my own work, and at-

<p>where that simple creed of which your noble family has
</p>
<p>THE GOOD PRIEST. 51
</p>
<p>given you the example, which our fathers possessed in a
</p>
<p>still higher degree than we, and of which the greatest
</p>
<p>captains of our time are not ashamed. Always while
</p>
<p>you wear a sword, remember that you hold it for the
</p>
<p>service of God. But at the same time, when you are
</p>
<p>among men, avoid being deceived by the hypocrite. He
</p>
<p>will encompass you, my son; he will assail you on the
</p>
<p>vulnerable side of your ingenuous heart, in addressing
</p>
<p>your religion ; and seeing the extravagancy of his af-
</p>
<p>fected zeal, you will fancy yourself lukewarm as com-
</p>
<p>pared with him. You will think that your conscience
</p>
<p>cries out against you ; but it will not be the voice of
</p>
<p>conscience that you hear. And what cries would not
</p>
<p>that conscience send forth, how fiercely would it not
</p>
<p>rise upon you, did you contribute to the destruction of
</p>
<p>innocence by invoking Heaven itself as a false witness
</p>
<p>against it?"
</p>
<p>" Oh, my father ! can such things be possible ? "
</p>
<p>exclaimed Henri d'Effiat, clasping his hands.
</p>
<p>" It is but too true," continued the abbd ; " you saw
</p>
<p>the execution of it in part this morning. God grant
</p>
<p>you may not witness still greater horrors ! But listen ;
</p>
<p>whatever you may see here, whatever crime they dare
</p>
<p>to commit, I conjure you, in the name of your mother
</p>
<p>and of all that you hold dear, utter not a word; make
</p>
<p>not a gesture that may indicate any opinion whatever
</p>
<p>upon the affair. I know the impetuous character that
</p>
<p>you derive from the mare'chal your father; curb it,
</p>
<p>or you are lost. These little ebullitions of passion pro-
</p>

</p>
<p>much. Oh, did you but know the advantage that a calm
</p>
<p>temper gives one over men ! The ancients stamped it
</p>
<p>on the forehead of the divinity as his finest attribute,
</p>
<p>since it shows that he is superior to our fears and to our
</p>
<p>hopes, to our pleasures and to our pains. Therefore, my
</p>
<p>dear child, remain passive in the scenes you are about
</p>
<p>to witness ; but see them you must. Be present at this
</p>
<p>sad trial ; for me, I must suffer the consequences of my
</p>
<p>school-boy folly. I will relate it to you ; it will prove to
</p>
<p>you that with a bald head one may be as much a child
</p>
<p>as with your fine chestnut curls."
</p>
<p>And the excellent old abbe", taking his pupil's head
</p>
<p>affectionately between his hands, continued as follows :
</p>
<p>" Like other people, my dear son, I was curious to see
</p>
<p>the devils of the Ursulines ; and knowing that they pro-
</p>
<p>fessed to speak all languages, I had the imprudence to
</p>
<p>leave the Latin tongue and question them in Greek. The
</p>
<p>superior is very pretty, but she does not know Greek.
</p>
<p>Duncan, the physician, observed aloud that it was sur-
</p>
<p>prising that the demon, who knew everything, should
</p>
<p>commit barbarisms and solecisms in Latin, and not be
</p>
<p>able to answer in Greek. The young superior, who was
</p>
<p>then upon her show-bed, turned towards the wall to
</p>
<p>weep and said in an undertone to Father Barre", 'I can-
</p>
<p>not go on with this, sir.' I repeated these words aloud,
</p>
<p>and infuriated all the exorcists ; they cried out that I
</p>
<p>ought to know that there are demons more ignorant
</p>
<p>than peasants, and said that as to their power and physi-
</p>
<p>cal strength, it could not be doubted, since the spirits

<p>Asmodeus, had promised to carry off the calotte of M.

<p>THE GOOD PRIEST. 53
</p>
<p>de Laubardemont. They were preparing for this, when
</p>
<p>the physician Duncan, a learned and upright man, but
</p>
<p>somewhat of a scoffer, took it into his head to pull
</p>
<p>a cord he discovered fastened to a column like a bell-
</p>
<p>rope, and which hung down just close to the referen-
</p>
<p>dary's head ; hereupon they called him Huguenot, and
</p>
<p>I am satisfied that if Mare"chal de Bre'ze' were not his
</p>
<p>protector, it would have gone ill with him. The Comte
</p>
<p>du Lude then came forward with his customary sang-
</p>
<p>froid, and begged the exorcists to perform before him.
</p>
<p>Father Lactantius, the Capuchin with the dark visage and
</p>
<p>hard look, proceeded with Sister Agnes and Sister Claire ;
</p>
<p>he raised both his hands, looking at them as a serpent
</p>
<p>would look at two doves, and cried in a terrible voice,
</p>
<p>' Quis te misit, Diabole?' and the two sisters answered,
</p>
<p>as with one voice, 'Urbanus.' He was about to continue,
</p>
<p>when M. du Lude, taking out of his pocket with an air
</p>
<p>of veneration a small gold box, said that he had in it a
</p>
<p>relic left by his ancestors, and that though not doubting
</p>
<p>the fact of the possession, he wished to test it. Father
</p>
<p>Lactantius seized the box with delight, and scarcely had
</p>
<p>he touched the foreheads of the two sisters with it than
</p>
<p>the} 7 made immense leaps and twisted about their hands
</p>
<p>and feet. Lactantius shouted forth his exorcisms ; Barre
</p>
<p>threw himself upon his knees with all the old women ;
</p>
<p>and Mignon and the judges applauded. The impassible
</p>
<p>Laubardemont made the sign of the cross (without being
</p>
<p>struck dead for it!). When M. du Lude took back his
</p>
<p>box the nuns became still. ' I think,' said Lactantius,
</p>
<p>insolently, ' that you will not question your relics now.'

<p>'No more than I do the possession,' answered M. du
</p>
<p>54 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>Ludc, opening his box and showing that it was empty.
</p>
<p>' Sir, you mock us,' said Lactantius. I was indignant at
</p>
<p>these mummeries, and said to him, * Yes, sir, as you
</p>
<p>mock God and men.' And this, my dear friend, is why
</p>
<p>you see me in my seven-league boots, so heavy and so
</p>
<p>big that they hurt my legs, and with long pistols ; for
</p>
<p>our friend Laubardemont has ordered my person to be
</p>
<p>seized, and I don't choose it to be seized, old as it is."
</p>
<p>" What, is he so powerful, then ? " cried Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" More so than is supposed, more so than could
</p>
<p>be believed. I know that the possessed abbess is his
</p>
<p>niece, and that he is provided with an order in council
</p>
<p>directing him to judge, without being deterred by any
</p>
<p>appeals lodged in parliament, the cardinal having pro-
</p>
<p>hibited the latter from taking cognizance of the matter
</p>
<p>of Urbain Grandier."
</p>
<p>" And what are his offences ? " asked the young man,
</p>
<p>already deeply interested.
</p>
<p>" Those of a strong mind and of a superior genius, an
</p>
<p>inflexible will which has irritated power against him,
</p>
<p>and a profound passion which has driven his heart and
</p>
<p>him to commit the only mortal sin with which I believe
</p>
<p>he can be reproached ; and it was only by violating the
</p>
<p>sanctity of his private papers, which they tore from
</p>
<p>Jeanne d'Estie~vre, his mother, an old woman of eighty,
</p>
<p>that they discovered his love for the beautiful Madeleine
</p>
<p>de Brou. This girl had refused to marry, and wished to
</p>
<p>take the veil. May that veil have concealed from her
</p>
<p>the spectacle of this day ! The eloquence of Grandier
</p>
<p>and his angelic beauty drove the women half mad ;

<p>they came miles and miles to hear him. I have seen
</p>
<p>THE GOOD PRIEST. 55
</p>
<p>them faint during his sermons; they declared him an
</p>
<p>angel, and touched his garment and kissed his hands
</p>
<p>when he descended from the pulpit. It is certain that
</p>
<p>unless it be his beauty, nothing could equal the sub-
</p>
<p>limity of his discourses, ever full of inspiration. The
</p>
<p>pure honey of the gospel combined on his lips with the
</p>
<p>flashing flame of the prophecies ; and one recognized in
</p>
<p>the sound of his voice a heart overflowing with holy
</p>
<p>pity for the evils to which mankind are subject, and
</p>
<p>swollen with tears, ready to flow forth for us."
</p>
<p>The good priest paused, for he himself had his voice
</p>
<p>and his eyes swollen with tears ; his round and naturally
</p>
<p>joyous face was more touching than a graver one under
</p>
<p>the same circumstances, for it seemed as though it bade
</p>
<p>defiance to sadness. Cinq-Mars, even still more moved,
</p>
<p>pressed his hand without speaking, fearful of interrupt-
</p>
<p>ing him. The abbe took out a red handkerchief, wiped
</p>
<p>his eyes, and continued,
</p>
<p>" This is the second attack upon Urbain by his com-
</p>
<p>bined foes. He had already been accused of bewitching
</p>
<p>the nuns ; but examined by holy prelates, by enlight-
</p>
<p>ened magistrates, and learned physicians, he was imme-
</p>
<p>diately acquitted, and the judges indignantly imposed si-
</p>
<p>lence upon these demons of human construction. The
</p>
<p>good and pious Archbishop of Bordeaux, who had him-
</p>
<p>self chosen the examiners of these pretended exor-
</p>
<p>cists, drove the prophets away and shut up their hell.
</p>
<p>But humiliated by the publicity of the result, annoyed
</p>
<p>at seeing Grandier well received by our good king when
</p>
<p>he cast himself at his feet at Paris, they saw that if

<p>he triumphed they were lost, and would be universally
</p>
<p>56 CINQ-MARS,
</p>
<p>regarded as impostors ; already the convent of the Ursu-
</p>
<p>lines was looked upon only as a theatre for disgraceful
</p>
<p>comedies, and the nuns themselves as shameless actresses.
</p>
<p>More than a hundred persons, furious against the curd,
</p>
<p>had compromised themselves in the hope of destroying
</p>
<p>him. Their plot, instead of being abandoned, has gained
</p>
<p>strength by its first check ; and here are the means that
</p>
<p>have been set to work by his implacable enemies.
</p>
<p>" Do you know a man called L 'Eminence Grrise, that
</p>
<p>formidable Capuchin whom the cardinal employs in all
</p>
<p>things, consults upon some, and despises invariably ? It
</p>
<p>was to him that the Capuchins of Loudun addressed
</p>
<p>themselves. A woman of this place, of low birth,
</p>
<p>named Hamon, having been so fortunate as to please
</p>
<p>the queen when she passed through Loudun, was taken
</p>
<p>into her service. You know the hatred that separates
</p>
<p>her court from that of the cardinal ; you know that
</p>
<p>Anne of Austria and M. de Richelieu have for some
</p>
<p>time disputed for the king's favor, and that, of her two
</p>
<p>suns, France never knew in the evening which would
</p>
<p>rise next morning. During a momentary eclipse of
</p>
<p>the cardinal, -a satire appeared, issuing from the plan-
</p>
<p>etary system of the queen ; it was called, La cordon-
</p>
<p>niere de 'la reine-mere. Its tone and language were
</p>
<p>vulgar; but it contained things so insulting about the
</p>
<p>birth and person of the cardinal that the enemies of
</p>
<p>the minister took it up and gave it a publicity which
</p>
<p>irritated him. There were revealed in it, it is said,
</p>
<p>many intrigues and mysteries which he had deemed im-
</p>
<p>penetrable. He read this anonymous work, and de-

<p>sired to know its author. It was just at this time that
</p>
<p>THE GOOD PRIEST. 57
</p>
<p>the Capuchins of this town wrote to Father Joseph
</p>
<p>that a constant correspondence between Grandier and
</p>
<p>La Hamon left no doubt in their minds as to his being
</p>
<p>the author of this diatribe. It was in vain that he had
</p>
<p>previously published religious books, prayers, and medi-
</p>
<p>tations, the style of which alone ought to have absolved
</p>
<p>him from having put his hand to a libel written in the
</p>
<p>language of the market-place ; the cardinal, long since
</p>
<p>prejudiced against Urbain, was determined to fix him as
</p>
<p>the culprit. He was reminded that when he was only
</p>
<p>prior of Coussay, Grandier disputed precedence with him
</p>
<p>and gained it ; I fear this achievement of precedence in
</p>
<p>life will make poor Grandier precede the cardinal in
</p>
<p>death also."
</p>
<p>A melancholy smile played upon the lips of the good
</p>
<p>abb as he uttered this involuntary pun.
</p>
<p>" What ! do you think this matter will go so far as
</p>
<p>death ? "
</p>
<p>" Ay, my son, even to death ; they have already taken
</p>
<p>away all the documents connected with his former abso-
</p>
<p>lution that might have served for his defence, despite
</p>
<p>the opposition of his poor mother, who preserved them
</p>
<p>as her son's license to live. Even now they affect to
</p>
<p>regard a work against the celibacy of priests, found
</p>
<p>among his papers, as destined to propagate schism.
</p>
<p>It is a culpable production, doubtless, and the love
</p>
<p>which dictated it, however pure it may be, is an enor-
</p>
<p>mous sin in a man consecrated to God alone ; but this
</p>
<p>poor priest was far from wishing to encourage heresy,
</p>
<p>and it was simply, they say, to appease the remorse of

<p>was so evident that his real faults would not suffice
</p>
<p>to condemn him to death that they have revived the
</p>
<p>accusation of sorcery, long since disposed of ; but feign-
</p>
<p>ing to believe which, the cardinal has established a new
</p>
<p>tribunal in this town, and has placed Laubardcmont at
</p>
<p>its head, a sure sign of death. Heaven grant that you
</p>
<p>never become acquainted with what the corruption of
</p>
<p>governments call coups-d'etat ! "
</p>
<p>At this moment a terrible shriek sounded from beyond
</p>
<p>the wall of the courtyard ; the abb6 arose in terror, as
</p>
<p>did Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" It is the cry of a woman," said the old man.
</p>
<p>"Tis heart-rending!" exclaimed Cinq-Mars. "What
</p>
<p>hear you ?" he asked his people, who had all rushed out
</p>
<p>into the courtyard.
</p>
<p>They answered that they heard nothing further.
</p>
<p>" Well, well," said the abbe", " make no noise." He
</p>
<p>then shut the window, and put his hands before his
</p>
<p>eyes.
</p>
<p>" Ah, what a cry was that, my son ! " he said, with
</p>
<p>his face of an ashy paleness, " what a cry ! It pierced
</p>
<p>my very soul ; some calamity has happened. Ah, holy
</p>
<p>Virgin ! it has so agitated me that I can talk with you
</p>
<p>no more. Why did I hear it, just as I was speaking to
</p>
<p>you of your future career ? My dear child, may God
</p>
<p>bless you ! Kneel."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars did as he was desired, and knew by a kiss
</p>
<p>upon his head he had been blessed by the old man, who
</p>
<p>then raised him up, saying,
</p>
<p>" Go, my son, the time is advancing ; they might find

</p>
<p>They embraced once more, promising to write to each
</p>
<p>other, and Henri quitted the house. The abbs', still fol-
</p>
<p>lowing him with his eyes from the window, cried,
</p>
<p>" Be prudent, whatever may happen," and sent him

<p>with his hands one more paternal blessing, saying,

<p>THE TRIAL.

</p>
<p>SHAKSPEAEE.
</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING the usage of secret trials, then freely
</p>
<p>countenanced by Richelieu, the judges of the Cure* of
</p>
<p>Loudun had resolved that the court should be open to
</p>
<p>the public ; but they soon repented this measure. They
</p>
<p>were all interested in the destruction of Urbain Gran-
</p>
<p>dier ; but they desired that the indignation of the country
</p>
<p>should in some degree sanction the sentence of death
</p>
<p>they had received orders to pass and to carry into effect.
</p>
<p>Laubardemont was a kind of bird of prey, whom the
</p>
<p>cardinal always let loose when he required a prompt
</p>
<p>and sure agent for his vengeance ; and on this occasion
</p>
<p>he fully justified the choice that had been made of him.
</p>
<p>He committed but one error, that of allowing a pub-
</p>
<p>lic trial, contrary to the prevalent usage ; his object had
</p>
<p>been to intimidate and to dismay. He dismayed, indeed,

</p>
<p>but he also created a feeling of indignant horror.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 61
</p>
<p>The crowd whom we left outside the gates had waited
</p>
<p>there for two hours, during which time the sound of
</p>
<p>hammers indicated that within the great hall they were
</p>
<p>hastily completing their mysterious preparations. At
</p>
<p>length the archers laboriously turned the heavy gates
</p>
<p>opening into the street upon their hinges, and the crowd
</p>
<p>eagerly rushed in. The young Cinq-Mars was carried
</p>
<p>in with the second enormous wave, and, placed behind
</p>
<p>a thick column, stood there, so as to be able to see with-
</p>
<p>out being seen. He observed with vexation that the
</p>
<p>dark group of citizens was near him ; but the great
</p>
<p>gates, closing, left the part of the court where the people
</p>
<p>stood in such darkness that there was no likelihood of
</p>
<p>his being recognized. Although it was only midday, the
</p>
<p>hall was lighted with flambeaux ; but they were nearly
</p>
<p>all placed at the farther end, where rose the judges'
</p>
<p>bench behind a long table. The chairs, tables, steps,
</p>
<p>were all covered with black cloth, and cast a livid hue
</p>
<p>over the faces of those near them. A seat reserved
</p>
<p>for the prisoner was placed upon the left, and on the
</p>
<p>crape robe which covered him flames were represented
</p>
<p>in gold embroidery to indicate the nature of the offence.
</p>
<p>Here sat the accused, surrounded by archers and his
</p>
<p>hands still bound in chains, held by two monks, who,
</p>
<p>with simulated terror, affected to start from him at his
</p>
<p>slightest motion, as though they held in bonds a tiger
</p>
<p>or enraged wolf, or as though the flames depicted on
</p>
<p>his robe could communicate themselves to their cloth-
</p>
<p>ing. They also carefully kept his face from .being seen
</p>
<p>by the people.

</p>
<p>The impassible countenance of M. de Laubardemont
</p>
<p>62 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>was there to dominate the judges of his choice ; almost
</p>
<p>a head taller than any of them, he was placed upon a
</p>
<p>scat more elevated than theirs, and each of his glassy
</p>
<p>and uneasy glances seemed to convey an order to them.
</p>
<p>He wore a long, full scarlet robe, and a black cap cov-
</p>
<p>ered his head ; he seemed occupied in arranging papers,
</p>
<p>which he then passed to the judges. The accusers, all
</p>
<p>of them ecclesiastics, sat on the right hand of the
</p>
<p>judges ; they wore their albs and stoles. Father Lac-
</p>
<p>tantius was distinguishable among them by his simple
</p>
<p>Capuchin habit, his tonsure, and the extreme hardness
</p>
<p>of his features. In a side gallery sat the Bishop of Poi-
</p>
<p>tiers, hidden from view ; other galleries were filled with
</p>
<p>veiled women. Below the bench of judges, a number of
</p>
<p>men and women, the dregs of the populace, stood behind
</p>
<p>six young Ursuline nuns, who seemed full of disgust at
</p>
<p>their proximity ; these were the witnesses.
</p>
<p>The rest of the hall was occupied with an immense
</p>
<p>crowd of people, gloomy and silent, clinging to the
</p>
<p>arches, the gates, and the beams, and full of a terror
</p>
<p>which communicated itself to the judges, for it arose
</p>
<p>from an interest in the accused. Numerous archers,
</p>
<p>armed with long pikes, formed, as it were, the frame
</p>
<p>a worthy one of this lugubrious picture.
</p>
<p>At a sign from the president, the witnesses withdrew
</p>
<p>through a narrow door opened for them by an usher.
</p>
<p>As she passed M. de Laubardemont, the superior of the
</p>
<p>Ursulines was seen to advance, and heard to say to him,
</p>
<p>" You have deceived me, sir." He remained immov-
</p>
<p>able, and she went on. A profound silence reigned

<p>throughout the whole assembly.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL, 63
</p>
<p>Rising with all the gravity he could assume, but still
</p>
<p>with visible agitation, one of the judges, named Hou-
</p>
<p>main, judge-advocate of Orleans, read a sort of indict-
</p>
<p>ment in a voice so low and so hoarse that it was
</p>
<p>impossible to follow it. He only made himself heard
</p>
<p>when what he had to say was calculated to impose upon
</p>
<p>the minds of the people. He divided the evidence into
</p>
<p>two classes, one, the depositions of seventy -two wit-
</p>
<p>nesses ; the other, more convincing, that resulting from
</p>
<p>" the exorcisms of the reverend fathers here present,"
</p>
<p>said he, crossing himself.
</p>
<p>Fathers Lactantius, Barre", and Mignon bowed low,
</p>
<p>repeating the sacred sign.
</p>
<p>. " Yes, my lords," said Houmain, addressing the
</p>
<p>judges, " this bouquet of white -roses and this manu-
</p>
<p>script, signed with the blood of the magician, a counter-
</p>
<p>part of the contract he has made with Lucifer, and which
</p>
<p>he was obliged to carry about him in order to preserve
</p>
<p>his power, have been recognized and brought before you.
</p>
<p>We read with horror these words written at the bottom
</p>
<p>of the parchment, ' The original is in hell, in Lucifer's
</p>
<p>private cabinet.'' "
</p>
<p>A burst of laughter, which seemed to emanate from
</p>
<p>stentorian lungs, was heard in the crowd. The presi-
</p>
<p>dent reddened, and made a sign to the archers, who in
</p>
<p>vain endeavored to discover the perturbator. The judge-
</p>
<p>advocate continued :
</p>
<p>" The demons have been forced to declare theirnames
</p>
<p>by the mouths of their victims. Their names and deeds
</p>
<p>are deposited upon this table : they are called Astaroth,

<p>of the order of Seraphim ; Eazas, Celsus, Acaos, Cedron,
</p>
<p>64 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>Asmodeus, of the order of Thrones ; Alex, Zebulon,
</p>
<p>Cham, Uriel, and Achas, of the order of Principali-
</p>
<p>ties, and so on, for their number is infinite. For their
</p>
<p>actions, who among us has not been a witness of
</p>
<p>them?"
</p>
<p>A lengthened murmur arose from the assembly, but
</p>
<p>upon some halberdiers advancing, all became silent.
</p>
<p>" We have seen with grief the young and respectable
</p>
<p>superior of the Ursulines tear her bosom with her own
</p>
<p>hands and grovel in the dust ; we have seen the sisters,
</p>
<p>Agnes, Claire, and others, deviate from the modesty of
</p>
<p>their sex by impassioned gestures and unseemly laugh-
</p>
<p>ter. When impious men have inclined to doubt the
</p>
<p>presence of the demons, and we ourselves felt our con-
</p>
<p>victions shaken, because they refused to answer to
</p>
<p>unknown questions in Greek or Arabic, the reverend
</p>
<p>fathers have, to establish our belief, deigned to explain
</p>
<p>to us that the malignity of evil spirits being extreme, it
</p>
<p>was not surprising that they should feign this ignorance
</p>
<p>in order that they might be less pressed with questions ;
</p>
<p>and that in their answers they had committed various
</p>
<p>solecisms and other grammatical faults in order to
</p>
<p>bring contempt upon themselves, so that out of this dis-
</p>
<p>dain the holy doctors might leave them in quiet. Their
</p>
<p>hatred is so inveterate that just before performing one
</p>
<p>of their miraculous feats, they suspended a rope from a
</p>
<p>beam in order to involve the reverend personages in a
</p>
<p>suspicion of fraud, whereas it has been deposed on oath
</p>
<p>by credible people that there had never been a cord in
</p>
<p>that place.

<p>THE TRIAL. 65
</p>
<p>explaining itself by the mouths of its holy interpreters,
</p>
<p>another light has just been thrown upon us. At the very
</p>
<p>time the judges were absorbed in profound meditation,
</p>
<p>a loud cry was heard near the hall of council ; and upon
</p>
<p>going to the spot, we found the body of a young lady
</p>
<p>of high birth. She had just sent forth her last breath
</p>
<p>in the public street, in the arms of the reverend Father
</p>
<p>Mignon, canon ; and we have learned from the said
</p>
<p>father here present, and from several other grave per-
</p>
<p>sonages, that suspecting the young lady to be possessed,
</p>
<p>by reason of the rumor for some time past current of
</p>
<p>the admiration Urbain Grandier had for her, an idea of
</p>
<p>testing it happily occurred to the canon, who suddenly
</p>
<p>said, approaching her, ' Grandier has just been put to
</p>
<p>death,' whereat she uttered one loud scream and fell
</p>
<p>dead, deprived by the demon of the time necessary for
</p>
<p>giving her the assistance of our holy Mother, the
</p>
<p>Catholic Church."
</p>
<p>A murmur of indignation arose from the crowd,
</p>
<p>among whom the word " assassin " was loudly re-echoed ;
</p>
<p>the halberdiers commanded silence with a loud voice,
</p>
<p>but it was obtained rather by the judge resuming his
</p>
<p>address, the general curiosity triumphing.
</p>
<p>" Oh, infamy ! " he continued, seeking to fortify him-
</p>
<p>self by exclamations ; " upon her person was found
</p>
<p>this work, written by the hand of Urbain Grandier,"
</p>
<p>and he took from among his papers a book bound in
</p>
<p>parchment.
</p>
<p>" Heavens ! " cried Urbain, from his seat.
</p>
<p>" Look to your prisoner," cried the judge to the
</p>
<p>archers who surrounded him.

</p>
<p>66 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" The demon doubtless is about to manifest himself,"
</p>
<p>said Father Lactantius, in a sombre voice ; " tighten
</p>
<p>his bonds." He was obeyed.
</p>
<p>The judge-advocate continued. " Her name was Ma-
</p>
<p>deleine de Brou, aged nineteen."
</p>
<p>" God ! this is too much ! " cried the accused, as he
</p>
<p>fell senseless on the ground.
</p>
<p>The assembly was deeply agitated ; for a moment
</p>
<p>there was an absolute tumult.
</p>
<p>" Poor fellow ! he loved her," said some.
</p>
<p>" So good a lady ! " cried the women.
</p>
<p>Pity began to predominate. Cold water was thrown
</p>
<p>upon Grandier, without his being taken from the court,
</p>
<p>and he was tied to his seat. The judge-advocate went
</p>
<p>on,
</p>
<p>" We are directed to read the beginning of this book
</p>
<p>to the court," and he read as follows :
</p>
<p>" ' It is for thee, dear and gentle Madeleine, it is to set at
</p>
<p>rest thy troubled conscience that I have described in this
</p>
<p>book one thought of my soul. All those thoughts tend to
</p>
<p>thee, celestial creature, because in thee they return to the
</p>
<p>aim and object of my whole existence ; but the thought I
</p>
<p>send thee, as 't were a flower, conies from thee, exists only
</p>
<p>in thee, and returns to thee alone.
</p>
<p>" ' Be not sad because thou lovest me ; be not afflicted
</p>
<p>because I adore thee. The angels of heaven, what is it that
</p>
<p>they do? The souls of the blessed, what is it that is prom-

<p>ised them? Are we less pure than the angels? Are our
</p>
<p>souls less separated from the earth than they will be after

</p>
<p>ask for early death to take us while yet youth and love are
</p>
<p>ours ? Or that, musing together beneath the funereal trees
</p>
<p>of the churchyard, we yearned for one grave, smiling at the
</p>
<p>idea of death, and weeping at life? Or that, when thou
</p>
<p>kneelest before me at the tribunal of penitence, and speaking
</p>
<p>in the presence of God, thou canst find nought of evil to
</p>
<p>reveal to me, so wholly have I kept thy soul in the pure
</p>
<p>reo-ions of heaven? What then could offend our Creator?
</p>
<p>O
</p>
<p>Perhaps 3*es ! perhaps some spirit of heaven may have
</p>
<p>envied me my happiness when on Easter day I saw thee
</p>
<p>kneeling before me, purified by long austerities from the
</p>
<p>slight stain which the original sin had left in thee ! Beau-
</p>
<p>tiful, indeed, wert thou! Thy glance sought thy God in
</p>
<p>heaven, and my trembling hand held his image to thy pure
</p>
<p>lips, which human lip had never dared to breathe upon.
</p>
<p>Angelic being ! I alone participated in the secret of the
</p>
<p>Lord, in the one secret of the entire purity of thy soul ; I it
</p>
<p>was united thee to thy Creator, who at that moment de-
</p>
<p>scended also into my bosom. Ineffable espousals, of which
</p>
<p>the Eternal himself was the priest, you alone were per-
</p>
<p>mitted between the virgin and her pastor ! the sole joy of
</p>
<p>each was to see eternal happiness commencing for the other,
</p>
<p>to inhale together the perfumes of heaven, to drink in already
</p>
<p>the harmony of the spheres, and to feel assured that our
</p>
<p>souls, unveiled to God and to ourselves alone, were worthy
</p>
<p>together to adore him.
</p>
<p>" ' What scruple still weighs upon thy soul, O my sister?
</p>
<p>Dost thou think I have offered too high a worship to thy
</p>
<p>virtue? Fearest thou so pure an admiration should deter
</p>
<p>me from that of the Lord?'"
</p>
<p>Houmain had reached this point when the door
</p>
<p>through which the witnesses had withdrawn suddenly
</p>
<p>opened. The judges anxiously whispered together.

<p>signed to the fathers to let him know whether this was
</p>
<p>some scene executed by their orders ; but seated at
</p>
<p>some distance from him, and themselves taken by sur-
</p>
<p>prise, they could not make him understand that they
</p>
<p>had not prepared this interruption. Besides, ere they
</p>
<p>could exchange looks, to the stupefaction of the assem-
</p>
<p>bly, three women, en chemise, with naked feet, each
</p>
<p>with a cord round her neck and a wax taper in her
</p>
<p>hand, came through the door and advanced to the
</p>
<p>middle of the platform. It was the superior of the
</p>
<p>Ursulines, followed by Sisters Agnes and Claire. Both
</p>
<p>the latter were weeping ; the superior was very pale,
</p>
<p>but her bearing was firm, and her eyes fixed and tear-
</p>
<p>less. She knelt ; her companions followed her example.
</p>
<p>Everything was in such utter confusion that no one
</p>
<p>thought of checking them ; and in a clear, firm voice
</p>
<p>she pronounced these words, which resounded in every
</p>
<p>corner of the hall :
</p>
<p>" In the name of the Holy Trinity, I, Jeanne de
</p>
<p>Belfiel, daughter of the Baron de Cose, I, the unworthy
</p>
<p>superior of the convent of the Ursulines of Loudun, ask
</p>
<p>pardon of God and man for the crime I have committed
</p>
<p>in accusing the innocent Urbain Grandier. My posses-
</p>
<p>sion was feigned, my words dictated ; remorse over-
</p>
<p>whelms me."
</p>
<p>" Bravo ! " cried the spectators, clapping their hands.
</p>
<p>The judges arose ; the archers, in doubt, looked at the
</p>
<p>president ; he shook in every limb, but did not change
</p>
<p>countenance.

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 69
</p>
<p>This man felt himself supported by so a strong hand
</p>
<p>that nothing could affright him, for no thought of
</p>
<p>Heaven ever visited him.
</p>
<p>"What think you, my fathers 2" said he, making a
</p>
<p>sign to the monks.
</p>
<p>" That the demon seeks to save his friend. Obmu-
</p>
<p>tesce, Satanas ! " cried Father Lactantius, in a terrible
</p>
<p>voice, affecting to exorcise the superior.
</p>
<p>Never did fire applied to gunpowder produce an effect
</p>
<p>more instantaneous than did these two words. Jeanne
</p>
<p>de Belfiel started up in all the beauty of twenty, which
</p>
<p>her awful nudity served to augment ; she seemed a soul
</p>
<p>escaped from hell appearing to her seducer. With her
</p>
<p>dark eyes she cast fierce glances upon the monks ;
</p>
<p>Lactantius lowered his beneath that look. She took
</p>

<p>Agnes indeed had scarcely uttered these words than,
</p>
<p>turning towards the people, she cried, " Help me ! they
</p>
<p>will punish me ; they will kill me ! " And hurrying
</p>
<p>away her companion, she threw herself into the crowd,
</p>
<p>who affectionately received them. A thousand voices
</p>
<p>swore to protect them. Imprecations arose ; the men
</p>
<p>struck their staves against the floor ; the officials dared
</p>
<p>not prevent the people from passing the sisters on from
</p>
<p>arm to arm into the street.
</p>
<p>During this strange scene the amazed and panic-
</p>
<p>struck judges whispered, M. Laubardemont looked at
</p>
<p>the archers, indicating to them the points they were es-
</p>
<p>pecially to watch, among which, more particularly, was
</p>
<p>that occupied by the group in black. The accusers
</p>
<p>looked towards the gallery of the Bishop of Poitiers, but
</p>
<p>discovered no expression in his apathetic countenance.
</p>
<p>He was one of those old men whom death appears to
</p>
<p>take possession of ten years before all motion entirely
</p>
<p>ceases in them. His eyes seemed veiled by a half sleep ;
</p>
<p>his gaping mouth mumbled a few vague and habitual
</p>
<p>words of prayer without meaning or application ; the
</p>
<p>entire amount of intelligence he retained was the dis-
</p>
<p>tinguishing the man who had most power, and him
</p>
<p>he obeyed, regardless at what price. He had accord-
</p>
<p>ingly signed the sentence of the doctors of the Sorbonne
</p>
<p>which declared the nuns possessed, without even deduc-
</p>
<p>ing thence the consequence of the death of Urbain ; the
</p>
<p>rest seemed to him one of those more or less lengthy
</p>
<p>ceremonies, to which he paid not the slightest attention,
</p>
<p>accustomed as he was to see and live among them,

</p>
<p>therefore gave no sign of life on this occasion, merely
</p>
<p>preserving an air at once perfectly noble and null.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Father Lactantius, Ijaving had a moment
</p>
<p>to recover from the sudden attack made upon him,
</p>
<p>turned towards the president and said.
</p>
<p>" Here is a clear proof, sent us by Heaven of the pos-
</p>
<p>session, for the superior has never before forgotten the
</p>
<p>modesty and severity of her order."
</p>
<p>" Would that all the world were here to see me ! " said
</p>
<p>Jeanne de Belfiel, firm as ever. " I cannot be suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently humiliated upon earth, and Heaven will reject
</p>
<p>me, for I have been your accomplice."
</p>
<p>The perspiration rolled down the forehead of Lau-
</p>
<p>bardemont, but he essayed to recover his composure.
</p>
<p>" What absurd tale is this, my sister ; what has influ-
</p>
<p>enced you herein?"
</p>
<p>The voice of the girl became sepulchral ; she collected
</p>
<p>all her strength, pressed her hand upon her heart as
</p>
<p>though she desired to stay its throbbing, and looking at
</p>
<p>Urbain Grandier, answered, " Love."
</p>
<p>A shudder ran through the assembly. Urbain, who
</p>
<p>since he had fainted had remained with his head hang-
</p>
<p>ing down as if dead, slowly raised his eyes towards
</p>
<p>her, and returned entirely to life only to undergo a fresh
</p>
<p>sorrow. The young penitent continued,
</p>
<p>" Yes, the love which he rejected, which he never fully
</p>
<p>knew, which I have breathed in his discourses, which
</p>
<p>my eyes drew in from his celestial countenance, which
</p>
<p>his very counsels against it have increased. Yes, Urbain
</p>
<p>is pure as an angel, but good as a man who has loved.

<p>I knew not that he had loved ! It is you," she said,

</p>
<p>more energetically, pointing to Lactantius, Barre*, and
</p>
<p>Mignon, and changing her passionate accents for those of
</p>
<p>indignation, "it is you who told me that he loved;
</p>
<p>you, who this morning have too cruelly avenged me by
</p>
<p>killing my rival with a word. Alas, I only sought to
</p>
<p>separate them ! It was a crime ; but by my mother I
</p>
<p>am an Italian. I burned with love, with jealousy ; you
</p>
<p>allowed me to see Urbain, to have him as a friend, to
</p>
<p>see him daily." She was silent for a moment, then ex-
</p>
<p>claimed, " People, he is innocent ! Martyr, pardon me,
</p>
<p>I embrace thy feet ! "
</p>
<p>She prostrated herself before Urbain and burst into
</p>
<p>a torrent of tears.
</p>
<p>Urbain raised his closely-bound hands, and giving her
</p>
<p>his benediction, said gently,
</p>
<p>" Go, my sister ; I pardon thee in the name of him
</p>
<p>whom I shall soon see. I have before said to you, and
</p>
<p>you now see, the passions work much evil, unless we
</p>
<p>seek to turn them towards heaven."
</p>
<p>The color a second time rose to Laubardemont's fore-
</p>
<p>head. " Miscreant ! " he exclaimed, " darest thou pro-
</p>
<p>nounce the words of the Church ? "
</p>
<p>" I have not quitted her bosom," said Urbain.
</p>
<p>" Remove the girl," said the president.
</p>
<p>When the archers went to obey, they found that she
</p>
<p>had tightened the cord round her neck with such force
</p>
<p>that she was of a livid hue and almost lifeless. Fear
</p>
<p>had driven all the women from the assembly ; many
</p>
<p>had been carried out fainting, but the hall was no less

<p>crowded. The ranks thickened, for the men out of the

<p>The judges arose in terror, and the president at-

<p>on their hats, stood in alarming immobility. The archers
</p>

<p>RAYNOUARD, Les Templiers.
</p>
<p>THE continuous interest of this half-trial, the solemnity
</p>
<p>of its preparations, its interruptions, everything had held
</p>
<p>the minds of the people in such attention that no pri-
</p>
<p>vate conversation had taken place. When, however, the
</p>
<p>people were left to themselves, there was, as it were, an
</p>
<p>explosion of clamorous sentences.
</p>
<p>There was at this epoch enough of primitive simplic-
</p>
<p>ity among the lower classes for them to be persuaded
</p>
<p>by the mysterious tales of the political agents who were
</p>
<p>playing upon them ; so that a large portion of the crowd
</p>
<p>present in the hall of trial, not venturing to revise their
</p>
<p>judgment, though upon the manifest evidence just af-
</p>
<p>forded them, awaited in painful suspense the return of
</p>
<p>the judges, interchanging with an air of mystery and
</p>
<p>inane importance the usual remarks dictated on such

<p>" One does not know what to think, sir ?"
</p>
<p>" Truly, Madame, most extraordinary things."
</p>
<p>" We live in strange times ! "
</p>
<p>" I guessed as much ; but, i' faith, it does not do to
</p>
<p>say what one thinks."
</p>
<p>" We shall see what we shall see," and so on, the
</p>
<p>unmeaningnesses of the crowd, which merely serve to
</p>
<p>show that it is at the command of the first who lays
</p>
<p>a strong hand upon it. Much more emphatic things
</p>
<p>were heard from the group in black.
</p>
<p>" What ! shall we let them do as they please, in this
</p>
<p>manner ? What ! dare to burn our letter to the king ! "
</p>
<p>" If the king knew it ! "
</p>
<p>" The barbarian impostors ! how skilfully is their plot
</p>
<p>contrived. What ! shall murder be committed under our
</p>
<p>very eyes? Shall we be afraid of these archers ?"
</p>
<p>" No, no, no ! "
</p>
<p>Attention was turned towards the young advocate,
</p>
<p>who, standing on a bench, began by tearing to pieces a
</p>
<p>roll of paper ; then raising his voice, he cried,
</p>
<p>" Yes, I tear and scatter to the winds the defence I
</p>
<p>had prepared for the accused. They have suppressed
</p>
<p>discussion ; I am not allowed to speak for him. I can
</p>
<p>only speak to you, people ; I rejoice that I can do so.
</p>
<p>You heard these infamous judges. Which of them can
</p>
<p>hear the truth. Which of them is worthy to listen to an
</p>
<p>honest man ? Which of them will dare to look him in
</p>
<p>the face ? Yet what do I say ? They all know the truth.

<p>They carry it in their guilty breasts ; it preys upon their

<p>because they have heard the cries of three misled women.
</p>
<p>What was I about to do ? I was about to speak for
</p>
<p>Urbain Grandier ! What eloquence could equal that
</p>
<p>of these unfortunates ? What words could better have
</p>
<p>shown you his innocence ? Heaven has taken up arms
</p>
<p>for him in bringing these to repentance and to devotion ;
</p>
<p>Heaven will finish its work "
</p>
<p>"Vade retro, Satanas," was heard through a high
</p>
<p>window in the hall.
</p>
<p>Fournier stopped for a moment, and then
</p>
<p>" You hear these voices parodying the divine language ?
</p>
<p>If I mistake not, these instruments of an infernal power
</p>
<p>are, by this song of theirs, preparing some new spell."
</p>
<p>" But," cried those who surrounded him, " what shall
</p>
<p>we do ? What have they done with him ? "
</p>
<p>" Remain here ; be immovable, be silent," replied the
</p>
<p>young advocate. " The inertia of a people is all-power-
</p>
<p>ful ; that is its true wisdom, that its strength. Look
</p>
<p>on closely, and in silence; and you will make them
</p>
<p>tremble."
</p>
<p>" They surely will not dare to show themselves again,"
</p>
<p>said the Comte du Lude.
</p>
<p>" I should like to have another look at the tall scoun-
</p>
<p>drel in red," said Grand-Ferre*, who had lost nothing of
</p>
<p>what passed.
</p>
<p>" And that good gentleman, the curd," murmured old
</p>
<p>Father Guillaume Leroux, looking at all his indignant
</p>
<p>children, who were talking together in a low tone, meas-
</p>

</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, still leaning with his back to the pillar
</p>
<p>behind which he had first placed himself, still enveloped
</p>
<p>in his black cloak, eagerly watched all that passed, lost
</p>
<p>not a word of what was said, and filled his heart with
</p>
<p>hate and bitterness. Violent desires for slaughter and
</p>
<p>revenge, an indefinite desire to strike, took possession of
</p>
<p>him, despite himself ; this is the first impression which
</p>
<p>evil produces on the soul of a young man. Afterwards
</p>
<p>sadness takes the place of fury, then indifference and
</p>
<p>scorn, later still, a selfish admiration for the great vil-
</p>
<p>lains who have been successful ; but this is only when
</p>
<p>of the two elements which constitute man, earth gains
</p>
<p>the day over the spirit. Meanwhile, on the right of the
</p>
<p>hall near the judges' platform, a group of women were
</p>
<p>attentively regarding a child of about eight years old,
</p>
<p>who had taken it into his head to climb up to a cornice
</p>
<p>by the aid of his sister Martine, whom we have seen
</p>
<p>jested with in such unmeasured terms by the young
</p>
<p>soldier, Grand-Ferre*. The child, having nothing to look
</p>
<p>at after the court had left the hall, had mounted by
</p>
<p>means of his hands and feet to a small window which
</p>
<p>admitted a faint light, and which he imagined to contain
</p>
<p>a swallow's nest or some other boyish treasure ; but
</p>
<p>when he was well established with his feet on the cor-
</p>
<p>nice of the wall, and his hands holding on by the bars of
</p>
<p>an old shrine of Saint Jerome, he wished himself any-
</p>
<p>where else, and cried out,
</p>
<p>" Oh, Sister, Sister, lend me your hand to get down ! "
</p>
<p>" What is it you see there ? " asked Martine.
</p>
<p>" Oh, I dare not tell ; but I want to get down ; " and

<p>he began to cry.
</p>
<p>78 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Stay there, my child ; stay there ! " said all the
</p>
<p>women. " Don't be afraid ; tell us all that you see."
</p>
<p>" Well, then, they 've put the curd between two great
</p>
<p>boards that squeeze his legs, and there are cords round
</p>
<p>the boards."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! that is the rack," said one of the townsmen.
</p>
<p>"Look, my little friend, what do you see now?"
</p>
<p>The child, more confident, looked again through the
</p>
<p>window, and then withdrawing his head, said,
</p>
<p>" I cannot see the cure* now, because all the judges
</p>
<p>stand round him, and are looking at him, and their
</p>
<p>great robes prevent me from seeing. There are also
</p>
<p>some Capuchins, stooping down to speak to him in a
</p>
<p>low voice."
</p>
<p>Curiosity brought more people under the boy's feet ;
</p>
<p>every one was silent, awaiting anxiously to catch his
</p>
<p>words, as though all their lives depended on them.
</p>
<p>" I see," he went on, " the executioner driving four
</p>
<p>little pieces of wood between the cords, after the
</p>
<p>Capuchins have blessed the hammer and nails. Ah,
</p>
<p>heavens ! Sister, how enraged they seem with him, be-
</p>
<p>cause he will not speak. Mother ! Mother ! give me
</p>
<p>yonr hand, I want to come down!"
</p>
<p>Instead of his mother, the child, upon turning
</p>
<p>round, saw only male faces, looking up to him with a
</p>
<p>mournful eagerness, and signing him to proceed. He
</p>
<p>dared not descend, and looked again through the win-
</p>
<p>dow, trembling.
</p>
<p>" Oh ! I see Father Lactantius and Father Barre*
</p>
<p>themselves forcing in more pieces of wood, which

<p>ing. There, his head falls back, as if he were dying !
</p>
<p>Oh, take me away ! "
</p>
<p>And he fell into the arms of the young advocate, of
</p>
<p>M. du Lude, and of Cinq-Mars, who had come to support
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>" Deus stetit in synagoga deorum : in medio autem
</p>
<p>Deus dijudicat " chanted strong and nasal voices,
</p>
<p>issuing from the small window, which continued in full
</p>
<p>chorus one of the psalms, interrupted by blows of the
</p>
<p>hammer, an infernal deed beating time to celestial
</p>
<p>songs. One might have supposed one's self near a
</p>
<p>smith's shop, but that the blows were dull, and mani-
</p>
<p>fested to the ear that the anvil was a man's body.
</p>
<p>" Silence ! " said Fournier, " he speaks. The chanting
</p>
<p>and the blows stop."
</p>
<p>A weak voice within said with difficulty, " Oh, my
</p>
<p>fathers, mitigate the rigor of your torments, for you will
</p>
<p>reduce my soul to despair, and I might seek to destroy
</p>
<p>myself!"
</p>
<p>At this, the fury of the people burst forth like an ex-
</p>
<p>plosion, echoing along the vaulted roofs ; the men
</p>
<p>fiercely sprang upon the platform, thrust aside the
</p>
<p>surprised and hesitating archers ; the unarmed crowd
</p>
<p>drove them back, pressed them, almost suffocated them
</p>
<p>against the walls, and held them fast, then dashed
</p>
<p>against the doors which led to the question-chamber,
</p>
<p>and making them shake beneath their blows, threatened

<p>to drive them in ; imprecations resounded from a thou-

</p>
<p>The multitude at once stopped short, and changing
</p>
<p>the direction of their steps, fled from this detestable
</p>
<p>place and rapidly spread through the streets. There
</p>
<p>an extraordinary confusion prevailed.
</p>
<p>Night had come on during the long sitting, and the
</p>
<p>rain was pouring down in torrents. The darkness was
</p>
<p>fearful. The cries of women slipping on the pavement
</p>
<p>or driven back by the horses of the guards ; the shout
</p>
<p>of the assembled and furious men ; the incessant toll-
</p>
<p>ing of the bells which had been keeping time with the
</p>
<p>strokes of the question ; the roll of distant thunder, all
</p>
<p>combined to increase the disorder. If the ear was as-
</p>
<p>tonished, the eyes were no less so. A few dismal torches
</p>
<p>lighted up the corners of the streets, and casting flitting
</p>
<p>gleams showed soldiers, armed and mounted, dashing
</p>
<p>along, regardless of the crowd, to assemble in the Place
</p>
<p>de St. Pierre le Marche" ; tiles were sometimes thrown
</p>
<p>at them on their way, but missing the distant culprit,
</p>
<p>fell upon some unoffending neighbor. The confusion
</p>
<p>was bewildering, and became still more so, when, hurry-
</p>
<p>ing through all the streets towards the Place de St.
</p>
<p>Pierre, the people found it barricaded on all sides, and
</p>
<p>filled with mounted guards and archers. Carts, fastened
</p>
<p>to the posts at each corner, closed each entrance, and
</p>
<p>sentinels, armed with arquebuses, were stationed close
</p>
<p>to the carts. In the midst of the Place, arose a pile
</p>
<p>composed of enormous beams placed crosswise upon one
</p>
<p>another, so as to form a perfect square ; these were cov-
</p>
<p>ered with a whiter and lighter wood ; an immense stake

<p>found silence ; for an instant nothing was heard hut the
</p>
<p>sound of the rain, which fell in torrents, and of the
</p>
<p>thunder, which came nearer and nearer.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cinq-Mars, accompanied by MM. du Lude
</p>
<p>and Fournier and all the more important personages
</p>
<p>of the town, had taken shelter from the storm under
</p>
<p>the peristyle of the church of Ste. Croix, raised upon
</p>
<p>twenty stone steps. The pile was in front, and from
</p>
<p>this height they could see the whole of the square. The
</p>
<p>centre was entirely clear, large streams of water alone
</p>
<p>traversed it; but all the windows of the houses were
</p>
<p>gradually lighted up, and showed the heads of the men
</p>
<p>and women who thronged them.
</p>
<p>The young D'Effiat sorrowfully contemplated this
</p>
<p>lugubrious preparation ; brought up in sentiments of
</p>
<p>honor, and far removed from the black thoughts which
</p>
<p>hatred and ambition arouse in the heart of man, he
</p>
<p>could not conceive that such wrong could be done with-
</p>
<p>out some powerful and secret motive. The daring of
</p>
<p>such a condemnation seemed to him so enormous that
</p>
<p>its very cruelty began to justify it in his eyes ; a secret
</p>
<p>horror crept into his soul, the same that silenced the
</p>
<p>people. He almost forgot the interest with which the
</p>
<p>unhappy Urbain had inspired him, in thinking whether
</p>
<p>it were not possible that some secret correspondence
</p>
<p>with the infernal powers had justly provoked such ex-
</p>
<p>cessive severity ; and the public revelations of the nuns,

<p>82 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>and the statement of his respected tutor, faded from his
</p>
<p>memory, so powerful is success, even in the eyes of su-
</p>
<p>perior men ! so strongly does force impose upon men,
</p>
<p>despite the voice of conscience !
</p>
<p>The young traveller was asking himself if it were
</p>
<p>not probable that the torture had forced some mon-
</p>
<p>strous confession from the accused, when the obscurity
</p>
<p>which surrounded the church suddenly ceased. Its two
</p>
<p>great doors were thrown open ; and by the light of an
</p>
<p>infinite number of flambeaux, appeared all the judges
</p>
<p>and ecclesiastics, surrounded by guards. In the midst
</p>
<p>of them was Urbain, supported or rather carried by six
</p>
<p>men clothed as Black Penitents, for his limbs, bound
</p>
<p>with bandages saturated with blood, seemed broken and
</p>
<p>incapable of supporting him. It was at most two hours
</p>
<p>since Cinq-Mars had seen him, and yet he could scarcely
</p>
<p>recognize the face he had so closely observed at the
</p>
<p>trial. All color, all roundness of form had disappeared
</p>
<p>from it ; a livid pallor covered a skin yellow and shin-
</p>
<p>ing like ivory ; the blood seemed to have left his veins ;
</p>
<p>all the life that remained within him shone from his
</p>
<p>dark eyes, which appeared to have grown twice as large
</p>
<p>as before, as he cast them languidly around him ; his
</p>
<p>long chestnut hair hung loosely down his neck and
</p>
<p>over a white shirt, which entirely covered him, or rather
</p>
<p>a sort of robe with large sleeves, and of a yellowish tint,
</p>
<p>with an odor of sulphur about it ; a long, thick cord
</p>
<p>encircled his neck and fell upon his breast. He looked
</p>
<p>like an apparition ; but it was the apparition of a
</p>
<p>martyr.

<p>Urbain stopped, or rather was set down upon the peri-
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM. 83
</p>
<p>style of the church ; the Capuchin Lactantius placed a
</p>
<p>lighted torch in his right hand, and held it there, as he
</p>
<p>said to him with his hard inflexibility,
</p>
<p>" Do penance, and ask pardon of God for thy crime
</p>
<p>of magic."
</p>
<p>The unhappy man raised his voice with great diffi-
</p>
<p>culty, and with his eyes to heaven said,
</p>
<p>" In the name of the living God, I cite thee, Laubarde-
</p>
<p>mont, false judge, to appear before him in three years.
</p>
<p>They have taken away my confessor, and I have been
</p>
<p>fain to pour out my faults into the bosom of God him-
</p>
<p>self, for my enemies surround me ; I call that God of
</p>
<p>mercy to witness I have never dealt in magic. I have
</p>
<p>known no mysteries but those of the Catholic religion,
</p>
<p>apostolic and Roman, in which I die ; I have sinned
</p>
<p>much against myself, but never against God and our
</p>
<p>Lord "
</p>
<p>" Proceed not ! " cried the Capuchin, affecting to close
</p>
<p>his mouth ere he could pronounce the name of the
</p>
<p>Saviour. " Obdurate wretch, return to the demon who
</p>
<p>sent thee ! "
</p>
<p>He signed to four priests, who, approaching with
</p>
<p>sprinklers in their hands, exorcised with holy water the
</p>
<p>air the magician breathed, the earth he touched, the
</p>
<p>wood that was to burn him. During this ceremony,
</p>
<p>the judge-advocate hastily read the decree, dated the
</p>
<p>18th of August, 1639, declaring Urbain Grrandier duly
</p>
<p>attainted and convicted of the crime of sorcery, witch-
</p>
<p>craft, and possession, in the persons of sundry Ursuline
</p>
<p>nuns of Loudun, and others, laymen, etc.

<p>The reader, dazzled by a flash of lightning, stopped
</p>
<p>84 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>for an instant, and, turning to M. dc Laubardemont,
</p>
<p>asked whether, considering the awful weather, the
</p>
<p>execution could not be deterred till the next day.
</p>
<p>" The decree," coldly answered Laubardemont, " com-
</p>
<p>mands execution within twenty-four hours. Fear not the
</p>
<p>incredulous people ; they will soon be convinced."
</p>
<p>All the most considerable persons of the town and
</p>
<p>many strangers were under the peristyle, and now
</p>
<p>advanced, Cinq-Mars among them.
</p>
<p>" The magician has never been able to pronounce the
</p>
<p>name of the Saviour, and repels his image."
</p>
<p>Lactantius at this moment issued from the midst of
</p>
<p>the Penitents, with an enormous iron crucifix in his hand,
</p>
<p>which he seemed to hold with precaution and respect ;
</p>
<p>he extended it to the lips of the sufferer, who indeed
</p>
<p>threw back his head, and collecting all his strength,
</p>
<p>made a gesture with his arm, which threw the cross
</p>
<p>from the hands of the Capuchin.
</p>
<p>"You see," cried the latter, "he has thrown down the
</p>
<p>cross ! "
</p>
<p>A murmur arose, the meaning of which was dubious.
</p>
<p>" Profanation ! " cried the priests.
</p>
<p>The procession moved on towards the pile.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cinq-Mars, gliding behind a pillar, had
</p>
<p>eagerly watched all that passed ; he saw with astonish-
</p>
<p>ment that the cross, in falling upon the steps, which
</p>
<p>were more exposed to the rain than the platform, smoked
</p>
<p>and made a noise like molten lead when thrown into
</p>
<p>water. While the public attention was elsewhere en-
</p>
<p>gaged, he advanced and touched it lightly with his hand,

</p>
<p>which was immediately scorched. Seized with indigna-
</p>
<p>THE MARTYRDOM. 85
</p>
<p>tiou, with all the fury of a true heart he took up the
</p>
<p>cross with the folds of his cloak, stepped up to Lau-
</p>
<p>bardemont, and striking him with it on the fore-
</p>
<p>head, cried,
</p>
<p>" Villain, bear the mark of this red-hot iron ! "
</p>
<p>The crowd heard these words, and rushed forward.
</p>
<p>" Arrest this madman ! " cried the unworthy magis-
</p>
<p>trate.
</p>
<p>He was himself seized by the hands of men who
</p>
<p>cried,
</p>
<p>" Justice ! justice, in the name of the king ! "
</p>
<p>" We are lost ! " said Lactantius ; " to the pile, to
</p>
<p>the pile ! "
</p>
<p>The Penitents dragged Urbain towards the Place,
</p>
<p>while the judges and archers re-entered the church,
</p>
<p>struggling with the furious citizens ; the executioner,
</p>
<p>having no time to tie up the victim, hastened to lay him
</p>
<p>on the wood, and to set fire to it. But the rain still
</p>
<p>fell in torrents, and each piece of wood had no sooner
</p>
<p>caught the flame than it became extinguished. In vain
</p>
<p>did Lactantius and the other canons themselves seek
</p>
<p>to stir up the fire ; nothing could overcome the water
</p>
<p>which fell from heaven.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the tumult which had commenced in the
</p>
<p>peristyle of the church extended throughout the square.
</p>
<p>The cry of " Justice ! " was repeated and circulated, with
</p>
<p>the information of what had been discovered ; two
</p>
<p>barricades were forced, and despite three volleys of
</p>
<p>musketry, the archers were gradually driven back
</p>
<p>towards the centre of the square. They in vain spurred

</p>
<p>their horses against the crowd ; it overwhelmed them
</p>
<p>86 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>with its swelling waves. Half an hour passed in this
</p>
<p>struggle, the guards still receding towards the pile,
</p>
<p>which they concealed as they pressed closer upon it.
</p>
<p>" On ! on ! " cried a man ; " we will deliver him ; do
</p>
<p>not strike the soldiers, but let them fall back. See,
</p>
<p>Heaven will not permit him to die ! The fire is out ;
</p>
<p>now, friend, one effort more ! That is well ! Throw
</p>
<p>down that horse ! Forward ! on ! "
</p>
<p>The guard was broken and dispersed on all sides.
</p>
<p>The crowd rushed to the pile, but there was no longer
</p>
<p>any light there : all had disappeared, even the execu-
</p>
<p>tioner. They tore up and threw aside the beams ; ohe
</p>
<p>of them was still burning, and its light showed
</p>
<p>under a mass of ashes and ensanguined mire a black-
</p>
<p>ened hand, preserved from the fire by a large iron
</p>
<p>bracelet and chain. A woman had the courage to
</p>
<p>open it ; the fingers clasped a small ivory cross and
</p>
<p>an image of Saint Magdalen.
</p>
<p>" These are his remains," she said, weeping.
</p>
<p>" Say, the relics of a martyr," exclaimed a citizen,

<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>THE DREAM.
</p>
<p>Nous sommes au printemps, et nos bois sont deserts,
</p>
<p>Et le printemps ii'a pas, ramenant ses concerts,
</p>
<p>Reveille les oiseaux eudormis sous les branches ;
</p>
<p>L'aubepine est en deuil, et les faibles pervenches
</p>
<p>De leurs boutons fle'tris s'e'chappent sans couleurs.
</p>
<p>Les vergers languissauts alte're's de chaleurs,
</p>
<p>Au lieu de nous donuer'des flours et de 1'ombrage,
</p>
<p>Balancent des rameaux de'pourvus de feuillages ;

<p>II semble que 1'hiver ue quitte pas les cieux.
</p>
<p>JULES LEFEVRE, Maria.
</p>
<p>MEANWHILE, Cinq-Mars, amid the fray which his out-
</p>
<p>break had provoked, felt his left arm seized by a hand
</p>
<p>as hard as iron, which, drawing him from the crowd to
</p>
<p>the bottom of the steps, pushed him behind the wall of
</p>
<p>the church, and he then saw the dark face of old Grand-
</p>
<p>champ, who said to him in a sharp voice,
</p>
<p>" Sir, your attacking thirty musketeers in a wood
</p>
<p>at Chaumont was nothing, because we were near you,
</p>
<p>though you knew it not, and, moreover, you had to do
</p>
<p>with men of honor ; but here 't is another thing. Your

</p>
<p>horses and people are at the end of the street ; I re-
</p>
<p>88 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>quest you to mount and leave the town, or to send me
</p>
<p>back to Madame la Mardchale, for I am responsible
</p>
<p>for your limbs, which you expose so freely."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, though somewhat confounded at this rough
</p>
<p>mode of having a service done him, was not sorry to
</p>
<p>extricate himself thus from the affair, having had time
</p>
<p>to reflect how very awkward it might be for him to be
</p>
<p>recognized, after having struck the head of the judicial
</p>
<p>authority and the agent of the very cardinal who was to
</p>
<p>present him to the king. He observed also that there
</p>
<p>was assembled around him a crowd of the lowest class
</p>
<p>of people, among whom he blushed to find himself. He
</p>
<p>therefore followed his old domestic without arguing the
</p>
<p>matter with him, and found the other three servants
</p>
<p>waiting for him. Despite the rain and wind he mounted,
</p>
<p>and was soon upon the high-road with his escort, having
</p>
<p>put his horse to a gallop to avoid pursuit.
</p>
<p>He had, however, no sooner got out of Loudun than
</p>
<p>the sandy road, furrowed by deep ruts completely filled
</p>
<p>with water, obliged him to slacken his pace. The rain
</p>
<p>continued to fall in torrents, and his cloak was almost
</p>
<p>saturated. He felt a thicker one thrown over his shoul-
</p>
<p>ders ; it was his old valet-de-chambre who had approached
</p>
<p>him, and thus exhibited for him a maternal solicitude.
</p>
<p>" Well, Grandchamp," said Cinq-Mars, " now that we
</p>
<p>are clear of the scuffle, tell me how you came to be there
</p>
<p>when I had ordered you to remain at the abba's."
</p>
<p>" Parbleu, Monsieur ! " answered the old servant, in a
</p>
<p>grumbling tone, " do you suppose that I should obey you
</p>
<p>more than I did M. le Mardchal ? When my late master,

<p>after telling me to remain in his tent, found me behind

</p>
<p>him in the cannon's smoke, he made no complaint, be-
</p>
<p>cause he had a fresh horse ready when his own was
</p>
<p>killed, and he only scolded me for a moment in his
</p>
<p>thoughts; but truly, during the forty years I served him,
</p>
<p>I never saw him act as you have done in the fortnight
</p>
<p>I have been with you. Ah ! " he added with a sigh,
</p>
<p>"we are going on at a fine rate; and if it continues,
</p>
<p>there 's no knowing what will be the end of it."
</p>
<p>" But knowest thou, Grandchamp, that these scoun-
</p>
<p>drels had made the crucifix red hot ? a thing at which
</p>
<p>there 's no honest man but would have been as much
</p>
<p>enraged as I was."
</p>
<p>" Except M. le Marshal, your father, who would not
</p>
<p>have done at all what you have done, sir."
</p>
<p>" What, then, would he have done ? "
</p>
<p>" He would very quietly have let this cure" be burned
</p>
<p>by the other cure's, and would have said to me, ' Grand-
</p>
<p>champ, see that my horses have oats, and let no one
</p>
<p>steal them ; ' or, ' Grandchamp, take care that the rain
</p>
<p>does not rust my sword or wet the priming of my pis-
</p>
<p>tols ; ' for M. le Marshal thought of everything, and
</p>
<p>never interfered in what did not concern him. That
</p>
<p>was his great principle ; and as he was, thank Heaven,
</p>
<p>alike good soldier and good general, he was always as
</p>
<p>careful of his arms as a recruit, and would not have stood
</p>
<p>up against thirty young gallants with a dress rapier."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars felt the force of the worthy servitor's epi-
</p>
<p>grammatic scolding, and feared that he had followed
</p>
<p>him beyond the wood of Chaumont ; but he would not
</p>
<p>ask, lest he should have to give explanations or to tell

</p>
<p>a falsehood or to command silence, which would at once
</p>
<p>90 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>have been taking him into confidence on the subject.
</p>
<p>As the only alternative, he spurred his horse and got
</p>
<p>before his old domestic ; but the latter had not yet had
</p>
<p>his say, and instead of keeping behind his master, rode
</p>
<p>up to his left and continued the conversation.
</p>
<p>" Do you suppose, sir, that I should allow you to go
</p>
<p>where you please ? No, sir, I ain too deeply impressed
</p>
<p>with the respect I owe to Madame la Marquise, to give
</p>
<p>her an opportunity of saying to me : ' Grandchamp, my
</p>
<p>son has been killed with a shot or with a sword ; why
</p>
<p>were you not before him ? ' Or, ' he has received a stab
</p>
<p>from the stiletto of an Italian, because he went at night
</p>
<p>beneath the window of a great princess ; why did you
</p>
<p>not seize the assassin ? ' This would be very disagree-
</p>
<p>able to me, sir, for I have never been reproached with
</p>
<p>anything of the kind. Once M. le Mare"chal lent me to
</p>
<p>his nephew, M. le Comte, to make a campaign in the
</p>
<p>Netherlands, because I know Spanish ; well, I fulfilled
</p>
<p>the duty with honor, as I always do. When M. le Comte
</p>
<p>received a bullet in his heart, I myself brought back his
</p>
<p>horses, his mules, his tent, and all his equipment, with-
</p>
<p>out so much as a pocket-handkerchief being missed ; and
</p>
<p>I can assure you that the horses were as well dressed
</p>
<p>and harnessed when we re-entered Chaumont as if
</p>
<p>M. le Comte had been about to go a-hunting. And
</p>
<p>accordingly I received nothing but compliments and
</p>
<p>agreeable things from the whole family, just in the
</p>
<p>way- 1 like."
</p>
<p>" Well, well, my friend," said Henri d'Effiat, " I may
</p>
<p>some day, perhaps, have these horses to take back ; but

<p>in the mean time take this great purse of gold, which I
</p>
<p>THE DREAM. 91
</p>
<p>have well-nigh lost two or three times, and thou shalt
</p>
<p>pay for me everywhere. The money wearies me."
</p>
<p>" M. le Mare'chal did not so, sir. He had been super-
</p>
<p>intendent of finances, and he counted every farthing he
</p>
<p>paid out of his own hand. I do not think your estates
</p>
<p>would have been in such good condition, or that you
</p>
<p>would have had so much money to count yourself, had
</p>
<p>he done otherwise ; have the goodness therefore to keep
</p>
<p>your purse, whose contents, I dare swear, you do not
</p>
<p>know."
</p>
<p>" Faith, not I."
</p>
<p>Grandchamp sent forth a profound sigh at his master's
</p>
<p>disdainful exclamation.
</p>
<p>" Ah, M. le Marquis ! M. le Marquis ! When I think
</p>
<p>that the great King Henri, before my eyes, put his
</p>
<p>chamois gloves into his pocket to keep the rain from
</p>
<p>spoiling them ; when I think that M. de Rosni refused
</p>
<p>him money when he had spent too much ; when I
</p>
<p>think "
</p>
<p>" When thou dost think, thou art egregiously tedious,
</p>
<p>my old friend," interrupted his master ; " and thou wilt
</p>
<p>do better in telling me what that black figure is that I
</p>
<p>think I see walking in the mire behind us."
</p>
<p>" It looks like some poor peasant woman who wants
</p>
<p>alms of us ; she may easily follow us, for we do not go
</p>
<p>at much of a pace in this sand, wherein our horses sink
</p>
<p>up to the hams. We shall go to the Landes perhaps
</p>
<p>some day, sir, and you will there see a country all the
</p>
<p>same as this sandy road, and great black firs all the
</p>
<p>way along. It looks like a churchyard ; this is an exact

<p>specimen of it. Look, now the rain has ceased and we

<p>92 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>can see a little ; there is nothing but furze-bushes on
</p>
<p>this great plain, without a village or a house. I don't
</p>
<p>know where we can pass the night ; but if you will take
</p>
<p>my advice, you will let us cut some boughs and bivouac
</p>
<p>where we are. You shall see how I can make a hut

<p>with a little earth as warm as a bed."
</p>
<p>" I would rather go on to the light I see in the
</p>
<p>horizon," said Cinq-Mars ; " for I fancy I feel rather
</p>
<p>feverish, and I am thirsty. But fall back, I would ride
</p>
<p>alone ; rejoin the others and follow."
</p>
<p>Grandchamp obeyed; he consoled himself by giving
</p>
<p>Germain, Louis, and Etienne lessons in the art of re-
</p>
<p>connoitring a country by night.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his young master was overcome with fa-
</p>
<p>tigue. The violent emotions of the day had profoundly
</p>
<p>affected his mind ; and the long journey on horseback,
</p>
<p>the last two days passed almost without nourishment,
</p>
<p>owing to the hurried course of events, the heat of the
</p>
<p>sun by day, the icy coldness of the night, all contributed
</p>
<p>to increase his indisposition and to weary his delicate
</p>
<p>frame. For three hours he journeyed on in silence be-
</p>
<p>fore his people, yet the light he had seen in the horizon
</p>
<p>seemed no nearer; at last he ceased to follow it with
</p>
<p>his eyes, and his head, feeling heavier and heavier, sank
</p>
<p>upon his breast. He gave the reins to his tired horse,
</p>
<p>which of its own accord followed the high-road, and
</p>
<p>crossing his arms, allowed himself to be rocked by the
</p>
<p>monotonous motion of his fellow-traveller, which fre-
</p>
<p>quently stumbled against the large stones that strewed
</p>
<p>the road. The rain had ceased, as had the voices of his

<p>domestics, whose horses followed in the track of their
</p>
<p>THE DREAM. 93
</p>
<p>master's. The young man abandoned himself to the
</p>
<p>bitterness of his thoughts; he asked himself whether the
</p>
<p>bright object of his hopes would not flee from him day by
</p>
<p>day, as that phosphoric light fled from him in the horizon,
</p>
<p>step by step. Was it probable that the young princess,
</p>
<p>almost forcibly recalled to the gallant court of Anne of
</p>
<p>Austria, would always refuse the hands, perhaps royal
</p>
<p>ones, that would be offered to her ? What chance that
</p>
<p>she would resign herself to renounce a present throne, in
</p>
<p>order to wait till some caprice of fortune should realize
</p>
<p>romantic hopes, or take a youth almost in the lowest
</p>
<p>rank of the army and lift him to the elevation she spoke
</p>
<p>of, till the age of love should be passed ? How could he
</p>
<p>be certain that even the vows of Marie de Gonzaga were
</p>
<p>sincere ? " Alas," he soliloquized, " perhaps she has
</p>
<p>blinded herself as to her own sentiments ; the solitude
</p>
<p>of the country had prepared her soul to receive deep
</p>
<p>impressions. I came ; she thought I was he of whom
</p>
<p>she had dreamed. Our age and my love did the rest.
</p>
<p>But when at court, she, the companion of the queen,
</p>
<p>has learned to contemplate from an exalted position the
</p>
<p>greatness to which I aspire, and which I as yet only see
</p>
<p>from a very humble distance ; when she shall suddenly
</p>
<p>find herself in actual possession of the future she aims
</p>
<p>at, and measures with a more correct eye the long road
</p>
<p>I have to journey over ; when she shall hear around her
</p>
<p>vows like mine, pronounced by lips which could undo
</p>
<p>me with a word, with a word destroy him whom she
</p>
<p>awaits as her husband, her lord, oh, madman that I
</p>
<p>have been ! she will see all her folly, and will be in-

</p>
<p>94 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>Thus did doubt, the greatest misery of love, begin to
</p>
<p>rack his sick heart ; he felt his hot blood rush to his
</p>
<p>head and oppress it. Ever and anon he fell forward
</p>
<p>upon the neck of his horse, and a half sleep weighed
</p>
<p>down his eyes ; the dark firs that bordered the road
</p>
<p>seemed to him gigantic corpses journeying by his side.
</p>
<p>He saw, or thought he saw, the same woman clothed in
</p>
<p>black, whom he had pointed out to Grandchamp, ap-
</p>
<p>proach so near as to touch his horse's mane, pull his
</p>
<p>cloak, and then run off with a jeering laugh ; the sand
</p>
<p>of the road seemed to him a river running beneath him,
</p>
<p>with opposing current, back towards its source. This
</p>
<p>strange sight dazzled his worn eyes ; he closed them
</p>
<p>and fell asleep on his horse.
</p>
<p>Ere long, he felt himself stopped, but he was numbed
</p>
<p>with cold and could not move. He saw peasants,
</p>
<p>lights, a house, a great room into which they carried
</p>
<p>him, a vast bed, whose heavy curtains were closed by
</p>
<p>Grandchamp ; and he fell asleep again, stunned by the
</p>
<p>fever that whirred in his ears.
</p>
<p>Dreams, that followed one another more rapidly than
</p>
<p>grains of sand before the wind, dashed through his
</p>
<p>brain ; he could not catch them, and moved restlessly
</p>
<p>on his bed. Urbain Grandier on the rack, his mother
</p>
<p>in tears, his tutor armed, Bassompierre loaded with
</p>
<p>chains, passed before him, making signs of farewell ;
</p>
<p>at last, as he slept, he instinctively put his hand to his
</p>
<p>head to fix the just passing dream, which then seemed
</p>
<p>to unfold itself before his eyes like a quicksand.
</p>
<p>There was a public square crowded with a foreign

<p>people, a northern people, who sent forth cries of joy,
</p>
<p>THE DREAM. 95
</p>
<p>but they were savage cries ; there was a line of guards,
</p>
<p>ferocious soldiers, these were Frenchmen. " Come
</p>
<p>with me," said the soft voice of Marie de Gonzaga,
</p>
<p>taking his hand. " See, I have a diadem ; here is thy
</p>
<p>throne, come with me." And she hurried him on,
</p>
<p>the people still shouting. He went on, on, on, a long
</p>
<p>way. " Why, then, are you sad, if you are a queen ? "
</p>
<p>he said, trembling. But she was pale, and smiled and
</p>
<p>spoke not. She ascended, step after step, up to a
</p>
<p>throne, and seated herself. " Mount," said she, forci-
</p>
<p>bly pulling his hand. But, at every movement, the
</p>
<p>massive stairs crumbled beneath his feet, so that he
</p>
<p>could not ascend. " Give thanks to love," she con-
</p>
<p>tinued ; and the hand, now more powerful, raised him
</p>
<p>to the summit. The people still shouted. He bowed
</p>
<p>low to kiss that helping hand, that adored hand; it
</p>
<p>was the hand of the executioner !
</p>
<p>" Oh, heavens ! " exclaimed Cinq-Mars, as, sending
</p>
<p>forth a deep sigh, he opened his eyes. A flickering
</p>
<p>lamp lighted the ruinous chamber of the inn ; he again
</p>
<p>closed his eyes, for he had seen, seated on his bed, a
</p>
<p>woman, a nun, so young, so beautiful ! He thought
</p>
<p>he was still dreaming, but she grasped his hand
</p>
<p>tightly. He opened his burning eyes, and fixed them
</p>
<p>upon her.
</p>
<p>" Is it you, Jeanne de Belfiel ? How the rain has
</p>
<p>drenched your veil and your black hair! What do
</p>
<p>you here, unhappy woman ? "
</p>
<p>" Hark ! awake not my Urbain ; he sleeps there in

</p>
<p>the mud has soiled them. But I have made a vow, I
</p>
<p>will not wash them till I have seen the king, and lie
</p>
<p>has granted me Urbain's pardon. I am going to the
</p>
<p>army to find him ; I will speak to him as G randier
</p>
<p>taught me to speak, and he will pardon him. And
</p>
<p>listen, I will also ask thy pardon, for I read it in thy
</p>
<p>face that thou too art condemned to death. Poor
</p>
<p>youth ! thou art too young to die, thy curling hair is
</p>
<p>beautiful ; but yet thou art condemned, for thou hast
</p>
<p>on thy brow a line that never deceives. The man
</p>
<p>thou hast struck will kill thee. Thou hast made too
</p>
<p>much use of the cross ; it is that will bring evil upon
</p>
<p>thee. Thou hast struck with it, and thou wearest it
</p>
<p>round thy neck by a hair chain. Nay, hide not thy
</p>
<p>face ; have I said aught to afflict the, or is it that
</p>
<p>thou lovest, young man ? Ah, reassure thyself, I will
</p>
<p>not tell all this to thy love. I am mad, but I am gentle,
</p>
<p>very gentle ; and three days since I was beautiful. Is
</p>
<p>she also beautiful ? Ah ! she will weep some day !
</p>
<p>Yet, if she can weep, she will be happy ! "
</p>
<p>And then all at once Jeanne began to recite the
</p>
<p>service for the dead in a monotonous voice, but with
</p>
<p>incredible volubility, still seated on the bed, and turning
</p>
<p>the beads of a long rosary.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the door opened ; she looked up, and fled
</p>
<p>through a door in the partition.
</p>
<p>" What the devil's that, an imp or an angel, saying
</p>
<p>the funeral service over you, and you under the clothes,
</p>
<p>as in a shroud ? "

<p>This abrupt exclamation came from the rough voice

<p>of Grandchamp, who was so astonished at what he had
</p>
<p>THE DREAM. 97
</p>
<p>seen that he dropped the glass of lemonade he was bring-
</p>
<p>ing in. Finding that his master did not answer, he
</p>
<p>became still more alarmed, and raised the bed-clothes.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars was crimson in the face, and seemed asleep,
</p>
<p>but his old domestic saw that the blood rushing to his
</p>
<p>head had almost suffocated him ; and seizing a pitcher
</p>
<p>full of cold water, he dashed the whole of it in his face.
</p>
<p>This military remedy rarely fails to effect its purpose,
</p>
<p>and Cinq-Mars returned to himself with a start.
</p>
<p>"Ah! it is thou, Grandchamp; what frightful dreams
</p>
<p>I have had!"
</p>
<p>" Peste! M. le Marquis, your dreams, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>are very pretty ones. I saw the tail of the last as I
</p>
<p>came in ; your choice is not bad."
</p>
<p>" What dost mean, blockhead?"
</p>
<p>" Nay, not a blockhead, sir ; I have good eyes, and
</p>
<p>I have seen what I have seen. But, really, ill as you
</p>
<p>are, M. le Mare*chal would never "
</p>
<p>" Thou art utterly doting, my friend, give me some
</p>
<p>drink, I am parched with thirst. Oh, heavens ! what
</p>
<p>a night! I still see all those women."
</p>
<p>" All those women, sir ? Why, how many are here ?"
</p>
<p>" I am speaking to thee of a dream, blockhead. Why
</p>
<p>standest there like a post, instead of giving me some
</p>
<p>drink?"
</p>
<p>" Enough, sir ; I will get more lemonade." And go-
</p>
<p>ing to the door he called over the staircase, " Germain !
</p>
<p>Etienne ! Louis ! "
</p>
<p>The innkeeper answered from below, " Coming, sir,
</p>
<p>coming ; they have been helping me to catch the mad-
</p>
<p>woman."

</p>
<p>" What mad-woman ? " said Cinq-Mars, getting up in bed.
</p>
<p>The host entered, and taking off his cotton cap, said
</p>
<p>respectfully, "Oh, nothing, M. le Marquis, only a
</p>
<p>mad-woman that came here last night on foot, and
</p>
<p>whom we put in the next chamber ; but she has escaped,
</p>
<p>and we have not been able to catch her."
</p>
<p>" Ah !" exclaimed Cinq-Mars, returning to himself and
</p>
<p>putting his hand to his eyes, " it was not a dream, then.
</p>
<p>And my mother, where is she ? and the mare'chal, and
</p>
<p>Ah ! and yet it is but a fearful dream ! Leave me."
</p>
<p>As he said this, he turned towards the wall, and again
</p>
<p>pulled the clothes over his head.
</p>
<p>The innkeeper, in amazement, touched his forehead
</p>
<p>three times with his finger, looking at Grandchamp as
</p>
<p>though to ask him whether his master were also mad.
</p>
<p>Grandchamp signed him away in silence, and in order
</p>
<p>to watch the rest of the night by the side of Cinq-Mars,
</p>
<p>who was in a deep sleep, he seated himself in a large
</p>
<p>armchair, covered with carpet-work, and began to squeeze
</p>
<p>lemons into a glass of water with an air as grave and
</p>
<p>severe as Archimedes calculating the inflammatory

</p>
<p>Ne cherchez point ailleurs un arbitre supreme. C. DE PQNS.
</p>
<p>LET us leave our young traveller sleeping ; he will soon
</p>
<p>pursue a long and beautiful route. Since we are at lib-
</p>
<p>erty to turn to all points of the map, we will fix our eyes
</p>
<p>upon the city of Narbonne.
</p>
<p>See the Mediterranean, not far distant, washing with
</p>
<p>its blue waters the sandy shores. Enter that city re-
</p>
<p>sembling Athens ; and to find him who reigns there,
</p>
<p>follow that dark and irregular street. Mount the steps
</p>
<p>of the old archiepiscopal palace, and enter the first and
</p>
<p>largest of its apartments.
</p>
<p>It was a very long saloon, lighted by a series of high
</p>
<p>ogee windows, of which the upper part only have re-
</p>
<p>tained the blue, yellow, and red panes that diffuse a

</p>
<p>mysterious light through the apartment. An immense
</p>
<p>100 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>round table occupied its entire breadth, near the great
</p>
<p>fireplace ; around this table, covered with a colored
</p>
<p>cloth and laden with papers and portfolios, were seated,
</p>
<p>bending over their pens, eight secretaries, busied in
</p>
<p>copying letters which were passed to them from a
</p>
<p>smaller table. Other men, cautiously walking to and
</p>
<p>fro on the carpeted floor, arranged the completed papers
</p>
<p>in the shelves of a bookcase, partly filled with books
</p>
<p>bound in black.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the number of persons assembled in
</p>
<p>the room, you might have heard the wings of a fly move.
</p>
<p>The only interruption to the otherwise dead silence was
</p>
<p>the sound of pens rapidly gliding over paper, and a
</p>
<p>shrill voice dictating, stopping every now and then to
</p>
<p>cough. This voice proceeded from a vast armchair
</p>
<p>placed by the side of the fire, which was blazing, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding the heat of the season and of the country.
</p>
<p>It was one of those armchairs that you still see in old
</p>
<p>castles, and which seem made to read you to sleep in,
</p>
<p>whatever the book may be, so easy is every part of it.
</p>
<p>You are received into a circular cushion of down ; if the
</p>
<p>head leans back, the cheeks sink into pillows covered
</p>
<p>with silk, and the seat juts out so far beyond the elbows
</p>
<p>that you may believe the provident upholsterers of our
</p>
<p>forefathers sought to provide that the book should make
</p>
<p>no noise in falling so as to awaken the sleeper.
</p>
<p>But to quit this digression, and proceed to the man
</p>
<p>who occupied the chair, and was very far from sleeping.
</p>
<p>He had a broad forehead, bordered with very white thin
</p>
<p>hair, large mild eyes, a wan, thin face, to which a small

<p>pointed white beard gave that air of subtlety and finesse
</p>
<p>THE CABINET. 101
</p>
<p>observable in all the portraits of the age of Louis XIII. ;
</p>
<p>a mouth almost without lips, which Lavater deems an
</p>
<p>indubitable sign of an evil mind, was framed, as it were,
</p>
<p>in a pair of slight gray mustaches and a royale, an or-
</p>
<p>nament then in fashion, and which somewhat resembled
</p>
<p>a comma in its form. The old man wore a red close cap,
</p>
<p>a large robe-de-chambre, and stockings of purple silk ;
</p>
<p>he was no less a personage than Armand Duplessis,
</p>
<p>Cardinal de Richelieu.
</p>
<p>Near him, round the small table of which we have
</p>
<p>spoken, were four youths of from fifteen to twenty ;
</p>
<p>these were pages, or domestics, according to the term
</p>
<p>then in use, which signified familiars, friends of the
</p>
<p>house. This custom was a remnant of feudal patronage,
</p>
<p>which still existed in our manners. The younger mem-
</p>
<p>bers of high families received wages from the great
</p>
<p>lords, and were devoted to their service in all things,
</p>
<p>challenging the first comer at a nod from their patron.
</p>
<p>The pages we speak of drew up letters from the outline
</p>
<p>previously given them by the cardinal, and after their
</p>
<p>master had thrown a glance over them, passed them to
</p>
<p>the secretaries, who made fair copies of them. The old
</p>
<p>due, for his part, wrote on his knee private notes upon
</p>
<p>small slips of paper, that he inserted in almost all the
</p>
<p>packets before sealing them, which he did with his own
</p>
<p>hand.
</p>
<p>He had been writing for some moments, when, in a
</p>
<p>mirror before him, he saw the youngest of his pages
</p>
<p>writing something on a sheet of paper much smaller
</p>
<p>than the official sheet. He hastily wrote a few words
</p>

</p>
<p>and then slipped it under the large sheet which, much
</p>
<p>102 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>against his inclination, lie had to fill ; but, seated behind
</p>
<p>the cardinal, he hoped that the difficulty with which the
</p>
<p>latter turned round would prevent him from seeing the
</p>
<p>little manoeuvre he seemed to exercise with much dex-
</p>
<p>terity. Suddenly Richelieu said to him dryly, " Come
</p>
<p>hither, M. Olivier."
</p>
<p>These words came like a thunder-clap on the poor boy,
</p>
<p>who seemed about sixteen. He however rose at once,
</p>
<p>and stood before the minister, his arms dependent at
</p>
<p>his side, and his head down.
</p>
<p>The other pages and the secretaries stirred no more
</p>
<p>than soldiers when a comrade is struck down by a ball,
</p>
<p>so accustomed were they to this kind of summons. The
</p>
<p>present one, however, was delivered in a more energetic
</p>
<p>tone than usual.
</p>
<p>" What were you writing ? "
</p>
<p>" My Lord, what your Eminence dictated."
</p>
<p>"How!"
</p>
<p>" My Lord, the letter to Don Juan de Braganza."
</p>
<p>" No evasions, sir ; you were doing something else."
</p>
<p>" My Lord," said the page, with tears in his eyes, " it
</p>
<p>was a letter to one of my cousins."
</p>
<p>" Let me see it."
</p>
<p>The page trembled in every limb and was obliged to
</p>
<p>lean against the chimney-piece, as he said in a scarcely
</p>
<p>audible tone, " It is impossible."
</p>
<p>" M. le Vicomte Olivier d'Entraigues," said the min-
</p>
<p>ister, without showing the least emotion, " you are no
</p>
<p>longer in my service." The page withdrew. He knew
</p>
<p>that there was no reply ; so slipping his letter into his

</p>
<p>to admit of his exit, he glided out like a bird escaped
</p>
<p>from his cage.
</p>
<p>The minister went on writing his note upon his knee.
</p>
<p>The secretaries were redoubling their zeal and silence,
</p>
<p>when the two wings of the door suddenly thrown back
</p>
<p>showed, standing in the opening, a Capuchin, who bow-
</p>
<p>ing, with his arms crossed over his breast, seemed wait-
</p>
<p>ing for alms or for an order to retire. He had a dark
</p>
<p>complexion, and was deeply pitted with the small-pox ;
</p>
<p>his eyes mild, but somewhat squinting, were almost
</p>
<p>hidden by his thick eyebrows, which met in the middle
</p>
<p>of his forehead ; on his mouth played a crafty, mis-
</p>
<p>chievous, and sinister smile ; his beard was straight
</p>
<p>and red, and his costume that of the order of Saint
</p>
<p>Francis in all its disgusting details, with sandals on
</p>
<p>his bare feet, that looked altogether unworthy to tread
</p>
<p>upon carpet.
</p>
<p>Such as he was, however, this personage seemed to
</p>
<p>create a great sensation throughout the room ; for with-
</p>
<p>out finishing the phrase, the line, or even the word com-
</p>
<p>menced, every person rose and went out by the door
</p>
<p>where he was still standing, some saluting him as they
</p>
<p>passed, others turning away their heads, and the young
</p>
<p>pages holding their fingers to their noses, but not till
</p>
<p>they were behind him, for they seemed to have a secret
</p>
<p>fear of him. When they had all passed out, he entered,
</p>
<p>making a profound reverence, because the door was still
</p>
<p>open ; but as soon as it was shut, unceremoniously ad-
</p>
<p>vancing, he seated himself near the cardinal, who, hav-
</p>
<p>ing recognized him by the general movement he created,

<p>saluted him with a dry and silent inclination of the head,
</p>
<p>104 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>regarding him fixedly, as if awaiting some intelligence,
</p>
<p>and unable to avoid knitting his brows, as at the aspect
</p>
<p>of a spider or some other disagreeable creature.
</p>
<p>The cardinal had been unable to resist this movement
</p>
<p>of displeasure, because he felt himself obliged, by the
</p>
<p>presence of his agent, to resume those profound and
</p>
<p>painful conversations from which he had for some days
</p>
<p>been free, in a country whose pure air, favorable to him,
</p>
<p>had somewhat mitigated the pain of his malady ; that
</p>
<p>malady had changed to a slow fever, but its intervals
</p>
<p>were long enough to enable him to forget during its
</p>
<p>absence that it must return. Giving, therefore, a little
</p>
<p>rest to his hitherto indefatigable mind, he had been
</p>
<p>awaiting, for the first time in his life perhaps, without
</p>
<p>impatience, the return of the couriers he had sent in all
</p>
<p>directions, as the rays of a sun which alone gave life
</p>
<p>and movement to France. He had not expected the
</p>
<p>visit he now received, and the sight of one of those
</p>
<p>men whom, to use his own expression, he steeped in
</p>
<p>crime, rendered all the habitual disquietudes of his
</p>
<p>life more present to him, without entirely dissipating
</p>
<p>the cloud of melancholy which just then obscured his
</p>
<p>thoughts.
</p>
<p>The beginning of his conversation was overcast with
</p>
<p>the gloomy hue of his late reveries ; but he soon issued
</p>
<p>from them more animated and vigorous than ever,
</p>
<p>when his powerful mind had perforce re-entered the
</p>
<p>real world.
</p>
<p>His confidant, seeing that he was to break the silence,
</p>
<p>did so in this abrupt fashion,

<p>" Well, my Lord, of what are you thinking ? "
</p>
<p>THE CABINET. 105
</p>
<p>"Alas, Joseph, of what should we all think, whoever
</p>
<p>we be, but upon our future happiness in a better life ?
</p>
<p>For many days past I have been reflecting that human
</p>
<p>interests have too much diverted me from this great
</p>
<p>thought; and I repent me of having spent some
</p>
<p>moments of my leisure in profane works, such as my
</p>
<p>tragedies of ' Europe ' and of ' Mirame,' despite the
</p>
<p>glory they have already gained me among our greatest
</p>
<p>wits, a glory which will extend unto futurity."
</p>
<p>Father Joseph, full of what he had to say, was at
</p>
<p>first surprised at this opening ; but he knew his master
</p>
<p>too well to manifest his feelings, and well skilled how
</p>
<p>to change the direction of his ideas, replied,
</p>
<p>" Yes, their merit is very great, and France will see
</p>
<p>with regret that these immortal works are not followed
</p>
<p>by others like them."
</p>
<p>" Yes, my dear Joseph ; but it is in vain that such
</p>
<p>men as Boisrobert, Claveret, Colletet, Corneille, and,
</p>
<p>above all, the celebrated Mairet, have proclaimed these
</p>
<p>tragedies the finest that the present or any past age has
</p>
<p>produced ; I reproach myself for them, I swear to you,
</p>
<p>as for a mortal sin, and I now, in my hours of repose,
</p>
<p>only occupy myself with my ' Methode des Contro-
</p>
<p>verses,' and my book on the ' Perfection du Chretien.'
</p>
<p>I bear in mind that I am fifty-six years old, and that
</p>
<p>1 have an incurable malady."
</p>
<p>" These are calculations which your enemies make
</p>
<p>as closely as your Eminence," said the priest, who began
</p>
<p>to be annoyed with this conversation, and was eager to
</p>
<p>proceed to other matters.

<p>" I know it ! 1 know it well ! " he said ; " I know all
</p>
<p>their black villany, and 1 am prepared for it. But what
</p>
<p>then is there new ? "
</p>
<p>"According to our arrangement, my Lord, we have
</p>
<p>removed Mademoiselle d'Hautefort, as Mademoiselle de
</p>
<p>la Fayette before her. So far it is well ; but her place is
</p>
<p>not supplied, and the king "
</p>
<p>" Well ! "
</p>
<p>" The king has ideas which he never had before."
</p>
<p>" Hah ! and which proceed not from me ? 'T is well,
</p>
<p>truly," said the minister, with an angry sneer.
</p>
<p>" Why, then, my Lord, leave the place of the favorite
</p>
<p>vacant for six whole days ? It is not prudent ; pardon
</p>
<p>me for saying so."
</p>
<p>" He has ideas, ideas ! " repeated Richelieu, with a
</p>
<p>kind of terror ; " and what are they ? "
</p>
<p>" He talks of recalling the queen-mother," said the
</p>
<p>Capuchin, in a low voice ; " of recalling her from
</p>
<p>Cologne."
</p>
<p>" Marie de Mddicis ! " cried the cardinal, striking the
</p>
<p>arms of his chair with his two hands. " No, by Heaven,
</p>
<p>she shall not again set her foot upon the soil of France,
</p>
<p>whence I drove her, step by step ! England has not
</p>
<p>dared to receive her, exiled by me ; Holland fears to
</p>
<p>be crushed by her ; and my kingdom to receive her !
</p>
<p>No, no, such an idea could not have originated with
</p>
<p>himself ! Recall my enemy ! recall his mother ! what
</p>
<p>perfidy ! he would not have dared to think of it."
</p>
<p>Then, having mused for a moment, he added, fixing
</p>
<p>a penetrating look still full of fiery anger upon Father

</p>
<p>" But iii what terms did he express this desire ?
</p>
<p>Tell me the exact words."
</p>
<p>" He said publicly, and in the presence of Monsieur,
</p>
<p>' I feel that one of the first duties of a Christian is to
</p>
<p>be a good son, and I will not resist the murmurs of
</p>
<p>my conscience.'"
</p>
<p>" Christian ! conscience ! these are not his expres-
</p>
<p>sions. It is Father Caussin ; it is his confessor who is
</p>
<p>betraying me," cried the cardinal. " Perfidious Jesuit !
</p>
<p>I pardoned thee thy intrigue with La Fayette ; but 1
</p>
<p>will not pass over thy secret counsels. I will have this
</p>
<p>confessor dismissed, Joseph ; he is an enemy to the
</p>
<p>State, I see it clearly. But I myself have acted with
</p>
<p>negligence for some days past; I have not sufficiently
</p>
<p>hastened the arrival of the young D'Effiat, who will
</p>
<p>doubtless succeed. He is handsome and intellectual,
</p>
<p>they say. What a blunder ! I myself merit disgrace.
</p>
<p>To leave that fox of a Jesuit with the king, without
</p>
<p>having given him my secret instructions, without a
</p>
<p>hostage, a pledge for his fidelity to my orders ! What
</p>
<p>neglect ! Joseph, take a pen, and write what I shall
</p>
<p>dictate for the other confessor, whom we will choose
</p>
<p>better. I think of Father Sirmond."
</p>
<p>Father Joseph sat down at the large table, ready to
</p>
<p>write, and the cardinal dictated to him those duties of a
</p>
<p>new kind, which shortly afterwards he dared to have
</p>
<p>given to the king, who received them, respected them,
</p>
<p>and learned them by heart as the commandments of
</p>
<p>the Church. They have come down to us, a painful

<p>by means of circumstances, intrigues, and audacity:
</p>
<p>108 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>"LA prince should have a prime minister, and that min-
</p>
<p>ister three qualities : (1) He should have no passion but for
</p>
<p>his prince ; (2) He should be able and faithful ; (3) He
</p>
<p>should be an ecclesiastic.
</p>
<p>"II. A prince ought perfectly to love his prime minister.
</p>
<p>" III. Ought never to change his prime minister.
</p>
<p>" IV. Ought to tell him all things.
</p>
<p>" V. To give him free access to his person.
</p>
<p>" VI. To give him sovereign authority over his people.
</p>
<p>" VII. Great honors and large possessions.
</p>
<p>" VIII. A prince has no treasure more precious than his
</p>
<p>prime minister.
</p>
<p>"IX. A prince should not put faith in what people sa}-
</p>
<p>against his prime minister, nor listen to any such slanders.
</p>
<p>" X. A prince should reveal to his prime minister all that
</p>
<p>is said against him, even though he has been bound to keep
</p>
<p>it secret.
</p>
<p>"XI. A prince should prefer not only the well-being of
</p>
<p>the State, but also his prime minister, to all his relations."
</p>
<p>Such were the commandments of the god of France,
</p>
<p>even less astonishing in themselves than the terrible
</p>
<p>naivet which made him bequeath them to posterity,
</p>
<p>as if posterity also were to believe in him.
</p>
<p>While he dictated his instructions, reading them
</p>
<p>from a small piece of paper, written with his own hand,
</p>
<p>a profound melancholy seemed to gain possession of
</p>
<p>him more and more at each successive word ; and when
</p>
<p>he had ended, he fell back in his chair, his arms crossed,
</p>
<p>and his head sunk on his breast.
</p>
<p>Father Joseph, quitting his pen, arose and was inquir-
</p>
<p>ing whether he were ill, when he heard issue from the
</p>
<p>depths of his chest these mournful and memorable

<p>words,

<p>THE CABINET. 109
</p>
<p>" What utter weariness ! what endless disgust ! If
</p>
<p>the ambitious man could see me, he would flee to a
</p>
<p>desert. What is my power? A miserable reflection
</p>
<p>of the royal power; and what labors to fix upon my
</p>
<p>star that incessantly wavering ray ! For twenty years
</p>
<p>I have been in vain attempting it. I cannot compre-
</p>
<p>hend that man. He dare not flee me ; but they take
</p>
<p>him from me, he glides through my fingers. What
</p>
<p>things could I not have done with his hereditary rights,
</p>
<p>had I possessed them ? But employing such infinite
</p>
<p>calculation in merely keeping one's balance, what of
</p>
<p>genius remains for high enterprises ? I hold Europe
</p>
<p>in my hand, and I myself am suspended by a trembling
</p>
<p>hair. What is it to me that I can cast my eyes confi-
</p>
<p>dently over the map of Europe, when all my interests
</p>
<p>are concentred in his narrow cabinet, and its few feet
</p>
<p>of space give me more trouble to govern than the whole
</p>
<p>country besides ? See then what is a prime minister !
</p>
<p>Envy me my guards, if ye can."
</p>
<p>His features were so contorted as to give reason to
</p>
<p>fear some accident; and at the same moment he was
</p>
<p>seized with a long and violent fit of coughing, which
</p>
<p>ended in a slight expectoration of blood. He saw that
</p>
<p>Father Joseph, alarmed, was going to seize a gold bell
</p>
<p>that stood on the table, and suddenly rising with all
</p>
<p>the vigor of a young man, he stopped him, saying,
</p>
<p>" 'T is nothing, Joseph ; I sometimes give way to these
</p>
<p>fits of depression ; but they do not last long, and I quit
</p>
<p>them stronger than before they came on. As for my

<p>the business in hand. What have you done at Paris ?
</p>
<p>110 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>I am glad to find the king has arrived in Be'arn, as I
</p>
<p>wished him ; we shall be able to keep a closer eye upon
</p>
<p>him. By what inducement did you get him away ?"
</p>
<p>" A battle at Perpignan."
</p>
<p>" Come, that is not bad. Well, we can arrange that
</p>
<p>for him ; the occupation will do as well as another just
</p>
<p>now. But the young queen, the young queen, what says
</p>
<p>she?"
</p>
<p>" She is still furious against you ; her correspondence
</p>
<p>discovered, the questioning to which you had subjected
</p>
<p>her "
</p>
<p>" Bah ! a madrigal and a momentary submission will
</p>
<p>make her forget that I have separated her from her
</p>
<p>house of Austria and from the country of her Bucking-
</p>
<p>ham. But what does she occupy herself with ? "
</p>
<p>" Machinations with Monsieur. But as we have his
</p>
<p>entire confidence, here are the daily accounts of their
</p>
<p>interviews."
</p>
<p>" I shall not trouble myself to read them ; while the
</p>
<p>Due de Bouillon remains in Italy, I have nothing to
</p>
<p>fear in that quarter. She may have as many petty plots
</p>
<p>with Gaston in the chimney corner as she pleases ; he
</p>
<p>never got beyond his excellent intentions, forsooth. He
</p>
<p>carries nothing into effect but his withdrawal from the
</p>
<p>kingdom. He has had his third now, I will manage a
</p>
<p>fourth for him whenever he pleases; he is not worth
</p>
<p>the pistol-shot you had the Comte de Soissons settled
</p>
<p>with, and yet the poor comte had scarce more energy
</p>
<p>than he."
</p>
<p>And the cardinal, reseating himself in his chair, began

<p>to laugh gayly enough for a statesman.
</p>
<p>THE CABINET. Ill
</p>
<p>" I always laugh when I think of their expedition to
</p>
<p>Amiens. They had me between them. Each had full
</p>
<p>five hundred gentlemen with him, armed to the teeth,
</p>
<p>and all going to despatch me, like Concini ; but the big
</p>
<p>Vitry was not there. They very quietly let me talk for
</p>
<p>an hour with them about the hunt and the Fete Dieu,
</p>
<p>and neither of them dared make a sign to their cut-
</p>
<p>throats. I have since learned from Chavigny that for two
</p>
<p>long months had they been waiting that happy moment.
</p>
<p>For myself, indeed, I observed nothing of it, except that
</p>
<p>little villain, the Abbe" de Gondi, 1 who prowled near me,
</p>
<p>and seemed to have something hidden under his sleeve ;
</p>
<p>it was he that made me get into the coach."
</p>
<p>" Apropos of the abbe*, my Lord, the queen insists upon
</p>
<p>making him coadjutor."
</p>
<p>" She 's mad ! he will ruin her if she connects herself
</p>
<p>with him ; he 's a musketeer in canonicals, the Devil in
</p>
<p>a cassock. Read his * Histoire de Fiesque ; ' you may
</p>
<p>see himself in it. He will be nothing while I live."
</p>
<p>" How is it that with a judgment like yours you
</p>
<p>bring another ambitious man of his age to court ? "
</p>
<p>" It is an entirely different matter. This young Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, my friend, will be a puppet, a mere puppet. He
</p>
<p>will think of nothing but his ruff and his shoulder-
</p>
<p>knots ; his handsome figure assures me of this. I know
</p>
<p>that he is gentle and infirm of purpose ; it was for this
</p>
<p>reason I preferred him to his elder brother. He will do
</p>
<p>all we wish."
</p>

<p>doubt, "I never place much reliance on people whose

</p>
<p>exterior is so calm ; the flame within is often all the
</p>
<p>more dangerous. Recollect the Marechal d'Effiat, his
</p>
<p>father."
</p>
<p>" But I tell you he is a boy, and I shall bring him up ;
</p>
<p>while Gondi is already an accomplished conspirator, an
</p>
<p>ambitious knave who sticks at nothing. He has dared to
</p>
<p>dispute Madame de la Meilleraie with me. Can you con-
</p>
<p>ceive it ? He dispute with me ! A petty priestling, who
</p>
<p>has no other merit than a little lively tittle-tattle and
</p>
<p>a cavalier air. Fortunately, the husband himself took
</p>
<p>care to get rid of him."
</p>
<p>Father Joseph, who listened with equal impatience to
</p>
<p>his master when he spoke of his bonnes fortunes and
</p>
<p>when he talked of his verses, made, however, a grimace
</p>
<p>which he meant to be very sly and insinuating, but
</p>
<p>which was simply unsightly and awkward ; he fancied
</p>
<p>that the expression of his mouth, twisted about like a
</p>
<p>monkey's, conveyed, " Ah ! who can resist your Emi-
</p>
<p>nence ? " But his Eminence only read there, " I am a
</p>
<p>clownish pedant who knows nothing of the great world.; "
</p>
<p>and without changing his voice, he suddenly said, taking
</p>
<p>up a despatch from the table,
</p>
<p>" The Due de Rohan is dead, that is good news ; the
</p>
<p>Huguenots are ruined. He 's a lucky man. 1 had him
</p>
<p>condemned by the parliament of Toulouse to be torn in
</p>
<p>pieces by four horses, and here he dies quietly on the
</p>
<p>battle-field of Rhinfeld. But what matters ? The result
</p>
<p>is the same. There's another great head laid low!

<p>How they have fallen since that of Montmorency ! 1

</p>
<p>assuredly they have nothing wherewith to reproach ine.
</p>
<p>I simply exercise against them the law of retaliation,
</p>
<p>treating them as they would have treated me in the
</p>
<p>council of the queen-mother. The old dotard Bassom-
</p>
<p>pierre shall he quit for perpetual imprisonment, and so
</p>
<p>shall the assassin Marechal de Vitry, for that was the
</p>
<p>punishment they voted me. As for Marillac, who coun-
</p>
<p>selled death, I reserve death for him at the first false step
</p>
<p>he makes, and I beg thee, Joseph, to remind me of him ;
</p>
<p>we must be just to all. There 's the Due de Bouillon still
</p>
<p>keeps up his head proudly on account of his Sedan, but
</p>
<p>I '11 make him give wav. Their blindness is trulv mar-
</p>
<p>o//
</p>
<p>vellous ! They think themselves all free to conspire,
</p>
<p>not perceiving that they are merely fluttering at the
</p>
<p>end of the threads that J hold in my hand, and which
</p>
<p>I lengthen now and then to give them air and space.
</p>
<p>Did the Huguenots yell as one man at the death of
</p>
<p>their dear due ? "
</p>
<p>" Less so than at the affair of Loudun, which is
</p>
<p>happily concluded."
</p>
<p>" How ! happily ? I hope that Grandier is dead ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes ; that is what I meant. Your Eminence may
</p>
<p>be fully satisfied. All was settled in twenty-four hours,
</p>
<p>he is no longer thought of. Only Laubardemont com-
</p>
<p>mitted a slight blunder in making the sitting public.
</p>
<p>This caused a little tumult ; but we have a description of
</p>
<p>the rioters, and measures are taken to seek them out."
</p>
<p>" This is well, very well. Urbain was too superior a
</p>
<p>man to be left there ; he was turning Protestant. I
</p>

<p>this ; and in cases of dcubt, remember, Joseph, it is
</p>
<p>always best to cut the tree before the fruit is gathered.
</p>
<p>These Huguenots, you see, are a regular republic in the
</p>
<p>State. If once they had a majority in France, the mon-
</p>
<p>archy would be lost ; they would establish some popular
</p>
<p>government which might be durable."
</p>
<p>" And what deep pain do they daily cause our holy
</p>
<p>Father the Pope!" said Joseph.
</p>
<p>" Ah," interrupted the cardinal, " I see ; thou wouldst
</p>
<p>remind me of his obstinacy in not giving thee the hat.
</p>
<p>Be tranquil ; I will speak to-day on the subject to the
</p>
<p>new ambassador we are sending, the Mare*chal d'Estre'es,
</p>
<p>and he will, on his arrival, doubtless obtain that which
</p>
<p>has been in train these two years, thy nomination to the
</p>
<p>cardinalate. t myself begin to think that the purple
</p>
<p>would become thee well, for it does not show blood-
</p>
<p>stains."
</p>
<p>And both burst into laughter, the -one as a master,
</p>
<p>overwhelming the assassin whom he pays with his utter
</p>
<p>scorn, the other as a slave resigned to all the humilia-
</p>
<p>tions by which he rises.
</p>
<p>The laughter which the ferocious pleasantry of the
</p>
<p>old minister had excited had scarce subsided, when the
</p>
<p>door of the cabinet opened, and a page announced several
</p>
<p>couriers who had arrived simultaneously from different
</p>
<p>points ; Father Joseph arose, and standing, his back
</p>
<p>leaning against the wall like an Egyptian mummy,
</p>
<p>allowed nothing to appear upon his face but a stolid
</p>
<p>contemplation. Twelve messengers entered successively,
</p>
<p>attired in various disguises ; one seemed a Swiss soldier,

</p>
<p>introduced into the palace by a secret staircase and
</p>
<p>corridor, and left the cabinet by a door opposite that at
</p>
<p>which they had entered, without any opportunity of
</p>
<p>meeting one another or communicating aught of their
</p>
<p>despatches. Each laid a rolled or folded packet of pa-
</p>
<p>pers on the large table, spoke for a moment with the
</p>
<p>cardinal in the embrasure of a window, and withdrew.
</p>
<p>Richelieu had risen on the entrance of the first mes-
</p>
<p>senger, and, careful to do all himself, had received them
</p>
<p>all, listened to all, and with his own hand closed the
</p>
<p>door upon all. When the last was gone, he signed to
</p>
<p>Father Joseph, and without speaking, both proceeded to
</p>
<p>open, or rather to tear open, the packets of despatches,
</p>
<p>and in a few words communicated to one another the
</p>
<p>substance of the letters.
</p>
<p>" The Due de Weimar pursues his advantage ; the
</p>
<p>Due Charles is defeated. Our general is in good spirits ;
</p>
<p>here are some of his exhilarant remarks at table.

</p>

</p>
<p>" Oh ! pass over them ; they cannot be dangerous. He
</p>
<p>is ever a good and honest man, in no way mixing him-
</p>
<p>self up with politics : so that he be given a little army
</p>
<p>to play at chess with, no matter against whom, he is
</p>
<p>content. We shall always be very good friends."

</p>
<p>" To death ! horrible ! "
</p>
<p>" I will read : ' His Majesty Charles I. has not had the
</p>
<p>courage to sign the sentence, but he has appointed four
</p>
<p>commissioners.' "
</p>
<p>. " Weak king, I abandon thee. Thou shalt have no
</p>
<p>more of our money. Fall, since thou art ungrateful !
</p>
<p>Unhappy Wentworth ! "
</p>
<p>A tear rose in the eyes of Richelieu as he said this ;
</p>
<p>the man who had but just played with the lives of so
</p>
<p>many others wept for a minister abandoned by his
</p>
<p>prince. The relation between that position and his own
</p>
<p>affected him, and it was himself he wept in the person
</p>
<p>of the foreign minister. He ceased to read aloud the
</p>
<p>despatches that he opened, and his confidant followed
</p>
<p>his example. He examined with scrupulous attention
</p>
<p>the detailed accounts of the most minute and most secret
</p>
<p>actions of each person of any importance, accounts
</p>
<p>which he always required to be added to the official
</p>
<p>despatches, by his able spies. The despatches to the
</p>
<p>king all passed through his hands, and were carefully
</p>
<p>revised so as to reach the king amended to the state in
</p>
<p>which he wished him to read them. The private notes
</p>
<p>were all carefully burned by the morik when the car-
</p>
<p>dinal had ascertained their contents. The latter, how-
</p>
<p>ever, seemed by no means satisfied, and he was walking
</p>
<p>quickly up and down the apartment with gestures ex-
</p>
<p>pressive of anxiety, when the door opened, and a thir-
</p>
<p>teenth courier entered. This one seemed a boy of
</p>
<p>scarce fourteen ; he held under his arm a packet sealed
</p>
<p>with black for the king, and gave to the cardinal only a

<p>small letter, of which a stolen glance from Joseph could
</p>
<p>THE CABINET. 117
</p>
<p>collect but four words. The due started, tore the billet
</p>
<p>into a thousand pieces, and bending down to the ear of
</p>
<p>the boy, spoke to him for a long time ; all that Joseph
</p>
<p>heard was, as the messenger went out :
</p>
<p>" Take good heed to this ; not until twelve hours from
</p>
<p>this time"
</p>
<p>During this aside of the cardinal, Joseph was occupied
</p>
<p>in concealing an infinite number of libels from Flanders
</p>
<p>and Germany, which the minister ever insisted upon
</p>
<p>seeing, however bitter they might be to him. In this
</p>
<p>respect, he affected a philosophy which he was far from
</p>
<p>possessing, and to deceive those around him he would
</p>
<p>sometimes pretend that his enemies were not wholly
</p>
<p>wrong, and would outwardly laugh at their pleasantries ;
</p>
<p>but those who knew his character better detected bitter
</p>
<p>rage lurking under this apparent moderation, and knew
</p>
<p>that he was never satisfied until he had got the hostile
</p>
<p>book condemned by the parliament to be burned in the
</p>
<p>Place de Greve, as " injurious to the king, in the person
</p>
<p>of his minister, the most illustrious cardinal," as we
</p>
<p>read in the decrees of the time, and that his only regret
</p>
<p>was that the author was not in the place of his book,
</p>
<p>a satisfaction he gave himself whenever he could, as in
</p>
<p>the case of Urbain Grandier.
</p>
<p>It was his colossal pride which he thus avenged, without
</p>
<p>avowing it even to himself, nay, laboring for a length
</p>
<p>of time, sometimes for a whole twelvemonth together, to
</p>
<p>persuade himself that the interest of the State was con-
</p>
<p>cerned in the matter. Ingenious in connecting his pri-
</p>
<p>vate affairs with the affairs of France, he had convinced

<p>himself that she bled from the wounds which he re-

</p>
<p>ceived. Joseph, careful not to irritate his ill temper at
</p>
<p>this moment, put aside and concealed a book, entitled,
</p>
<p>"Mysteries Politiques du Cardinal de la Rochelle;"
</p>
<p>also another, attributed to a monk of Munich, entitled,
</p>
<p>" Questions quolibetiques, ajuste'es au temps present, et
</p>
<p>Impie'td Sanglante du dicu Mars." The worthy advocate
</p>
<p>Aubery, who has given us one of the most faithful his-
</p>
<p>tories of the most eminent cardinal, is transported with
</p>
<p>rage at the mere title of the first of these books, and

<p>D'
</p>
<p>exclaims that " the great minister had good reason to
</p>
<p>glorify himself that his enemies, inspired against their
</p>
<p>will with the same enthusiasm which conferred the gift
</p>
<p>of rendering oracles upon the ass of Balaam, upon Caia-
</p>
<p>phas and others, who seemed most unworthy of the gift
</p>
<p>of prophecy, called him with good reason Cardinal de
</p>
<p>la Rochelle, since three years after their writing he re-
</p>
<p>duced that town ; thus Scipio was called Africanus for
</p>
<p>having subjugated that PROVINCE ! " Very little was
</p>
<p>wanting to make Father Joseph, who had necessarily
</p>
<p>the same feelings, express his indignation in the same
</p>
<p>terms ; for he remembered with bitterness the ridicu-
</p>
<p>lous part he had played in the siege of Rochelle, which,
</p>
<p>though not a province like Africa, had ventured to resist
</p>
<p>the most eminent cardinal, and into which Father Joseph,
</p>
<p>piquing himself on his military skill, had proposed to
</p>
<p>introduce the troops through a sewer. However, he re-
</p>
<p>strained himself, and had time to Conceal the libel in
</p>
<p>the pocket of his brown robe ere the minister had dis-
</p>
<p>missed his young courier, and returned to the table.
</p>
<p>" And now to depart, Joseph," he said. " Open the

<p>to the king, who awaits me at Perpignan ; this time I
</p>
<p>have him for good."
</p>
<p>The Capuchin drew back, and immediately the pages,
</p>
<p>throwing open the gilded doors, announced in succession
</p>
<p>the greatest lords of the period, who had obtained per-
</p>
<p>mission from the king to come and salute the minister.
</p>
<p>Some, even, under the pretext of sickness or business
</p>
<p>had departed secretly, in order not to be among the last
</p>
<p>at Richelieu's levee ; and the unhappy monarch found
</p>
<p>himself almost as alone as other kings find themselves
</p>
<p>on their death-beds. But with him, the throne seemed,
</p>
<p>in the eyes of the court, his dying couch, his reign a
</p>
<p>continual last agony, and his minister a threatening-
</p>
<p>successor.
</p>
<p>Two pages, of the first families of France, stood at the
</p>
<p>door, where the ushers announced each of the persons
</p>
<p>whom Father Joseph had found in the anteroom. The
</p>
<p>cardinal, still seated in his great armchair, remained
</p>
<p>motionless as the common courtiers entered, inclined
</p>
<p>his head to the most distinguished, and to princes alone
</p>
<p>put his hands on the elbows of his chair and slightly
</p>
<p>rose ; each person, having profoundly saluted him, stood
</p>
<p>before him near the fireplace, waited till he had spoken
</p>
<p>to him, and then, at the motion of his hand, completed
</p>
<p>the circle of the room, and went out by the same door
</p>
<p>at which he had entered, paused for a moment to salute
</p>
<p>Father Joseph, who aped his master, and who for that
</p>
<p>reason had been named his Gray Eminence, and at last
</p>
<p>quitted the palace, unless, indeed, he remained standing
</p>
<p>behind the chair, at the minister's intimation to that

<p>effect, which was considered a token of very great favor.

</p>
<p>He let pass several insignificant persons, and many
</p>
<p>whose merits were useless to him ; the first whom he
</p>
<p>stopped in the procession was the Mardchal d'Estre"es,
</p>
<p>who, then about to set out on an embassy to Rome, came
</p>
<p>to make his adieux ; all behind him stopped short. This
</p>
<p>circumstance gave notice to the anteroom that a longer
</p>
<p>conversation than usual was on foot, and Father Joseph,
</p>
<p>advancing to the threshold, exchanged with the cardinal
</p>
<p>a glance which seemed to say, on the one side, " Re-
</p>
<p>member the promise you just made me," on the other,
</p>
<p>" Set your mind at rest." At the same time, the expert
</p>
<p>Capuchin let his master see that he held upon his arm
</p>
<p>one of his victims, whom he was forming into a docile
</p>
<p>instrument ; this was a young gentleman who wore a
</p>
<p>very short green cloak, a pourpoint of the same color,
</p>
<p>close-fitting red breeches, with glittering gold garters
</p>
<p>below the knee, the costume of the pages of Mon-
</p>
<p>sieur. Father Joseph, indeed, spoke to him secretly,
</p>
<p>but not in the way the cardinal imagined ; for he con-
</p>
<p>templated being his equal, and was preparing other
</p>
<p>connections, in case of defection on the part of the
</p>
<p>prime minister.
</p>
<p>" Tell Monsieur not to trust in appearances, and that
</p>
<p>he has no servant more faithful than I. The cardinal
</p>
<p>is on the decline, and my conscience tells me to warn
</p>
<p>against his faults him who may inherit the royal power
</p>
<p>during the minority. To give your, great prince a proof
</p>
<p>of my faith, tell him that it is intended to arrest his
</p>
<p>friend, Puy-Laurens, and that he had better be kept
</p>
<p>out of the way, or the cardinal will put him in the

</p>
<p>While the servant was thus betraying his master,
</p>
<p>the master, not to be behindhand with him, betrayed
</p>
<p>his servant. His self-love, and some remnant of re-
</p>
<p>spect to the Church, made him shudder at the idea of
</p>
<p>seeing a contemptible agent invested with the same
</p>
<p>hat which he himself wore as a crown, and seated as
</p>
<p>high as himself, except as to the precarious position
</p>
<p>of minister. Speaking, therefore, in an undertone to
</p>
<p>the Mare"chal d'Estrees, he said,
</p>
<p>"It is not necessary to importune Urban VIII. any
</p>
<p>further in favor of the Capuchin you see yonder ; it is
</p>
<p>enough that his Majesty has deigned to name him for
</p>
<p>the cardinalate. One can readily conceive the repug-
</p>
<p>nance, of his Holiness to clothe this mendicant in the
</p>
<p>Roman purple.'*
</p>
<p>Then passing on to general matters, he continued,
</p>
<p>" Truly, I know not what can have cooled the holy
</p>
<p>Father towards us ; what have we done that was not for
</p>
<p>the glory of our holy Mother, the Catholic Church ? I
</p>
<p>myself said the first mass at Rochelle, and you see for
</p>
<p>yourself, M. le Mare'chal, that our habit is everywhere ;
</p>
<p>and even in your armies, the Cardinal de la Vallette
</p>
<p>has commanded gloriously in the palatinate."
</p>
<p>"And has just made a very fine retreat" said the
</p>
<p>marechal, laying a slight emphasis upon the word.
</p>
<p>The minister continued, without paying any attention
</p>
<p>to this little ebullition of professional jealousy, and
</p>
<p>raising his voice, said,
</p>
<p>" God has proved that he did not scorn to send the
</p>
<p>spirit of victory upon his Levites, for the Due de

<p>Weimar did not more powerfully aid in the conquest
</p>
<p>122 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>of Lorraine than did this pious cardinal, and never was
</p>
<p>a naval army better commanded than by our Archbishop
</p>
<p>of Bordeaux at Rochelle."
</p>
<p>It was well known that at this very moment the minis-
</p>
<p>ter was incensed against this prelate, whose haughtiness
</p>
<p>was so overbearing, and whose impertinent ebullitions
</p>
<p>were so frequent as to have involved him in two very
</p>
<p>disagreeable affairs at Bordeaux. Four years before,
</p>
<p>the Due d'Epernon, then governor of Guyenne, fol-
</p>
<p>lowed by all his train and by his troops, meeting him
</p>
<p>in the midst of his clergy in a procession, called him
</p>
<p>an insolent fellow, and gave him two smart blows with
</p>
<p>his cane; whereupon the archbishop excommunicated
</p>
<p>him. And again, recently, despite this lesson, he had
</p>
<p>quarrelled with the Mare'chal de Vitry, from whom he
</p>
<p>had received " twenty blows with a cane or stick, which
</p>
<p>you please" wrote the cardinal-due to the Cardinal de
</p>
<p>la Vallette, " and I think he would like to excommunicate
</p>
<p>all France." In fact, he did excommunicate the mare*-
</p>
<p>chal's baton, remembering that in the former case the
</p>
<p>pope had obliged the Due d'Epernon to ask his pardon ;
</p>
<p>but M. Vitry, who had caused the Mare'chal d'Ancre to
</p>
<p>be assassinated, stood too well at court for that, and the
</p>
<p>archbishop, in addition to his beating, got well scolded
</p>
<p>by the minister.
</p>
<p>M. d'Estre'es thought, therefore, with tact, that there
</p>
<p>might be some irony in the cardinal's manner of re-
</p>
<p>ferring to the warlike talents of the archbishop, and
</p>
<p>he answered with perfect sang-froid,
</p>
<p>" It is true, my Lord, no one can say that 't was upon

</p>

</p>
<p>His Eminence could not restrain a smile at this ; but
</p>
<p>seeing that the electrical effect of that smile had created
</p>
<p>others in the hall, as well as whisperings and conjec-
</p>
<p>tures, he immediately resumed his gravity, and familiarly
</p>
<p>taking the marshal's arm, said ,
</p>
<p>" Come, come, M. 1'Ambassadeur, you are ready at
</p>
<p>repartee. With you I should not fear Cardinal
</p>
<p>Albornos, or all the Borgias in the world, or all the
</p>
<p>efforts of their Spain with the holy Father."
</p>
<p>Then, raising his voice, and looking round him, as
</p>
<p>if addressing himself to the silent, and, so to speak,
</p>
<p>captive assembly, he continued,
</p>
<p>" I hope that we shall no more be reproached, as
</p>
<p>formerly, for having formed an alliance with one of the
</p>
<p>greatest men of our day ; but as Gustavus Adolphus is
</p>
<p>dead, the Catholic king will no longer have any pretext
</p>
<p>for soliciting the excommunication of the most Christian
</p>
<p>king. How say you, my dear Lord ? " addressing himself
</p>
<p>to the Cardinal de la Yallette, who now approached,
</p>
<p>fortunately without having heard the late allusion to
</p>
<p>himself. " M. d'Estre'es, remain near our chair ; we
</p>
<p>have still many things to say to you, and you are not
</p>
<p>one too many in our conversations, for we have no
</p>
<p>secrets. Our policy is frank, and open to all men ; the
</p>
<p>interest of his Majesty and of the State, nothing
</p>
<p>more."
</p>
<p>The mare'chal made a profound bow, fell back behind
</p>
<p>the chair of the minister, and gave place to the Cardinal
</p>
<p>de la Vallette, who, incessantly bowing and flattering and
</p>
<p>swearing devotion and entire obedience to the cardinal,

<p>d'Epernon, received in return a few vague words, to no

<p>meaning or purpose, the cardinal all the while looking
</p>
<p>towards the door, to see who should follow. He had

<p>even the mortification to find himself abruptly inter-
</p>
<p>rupted by the minister, who cried at the most flattering

<p>period of his honeyed discourse,

<p>" Ah ! is that you at last, my dear Fabert ? How I
</p>
<p>have longed to see you, to talk of the siege ! "
</p>
<p>The general, with a brusque and awkward manner,
</p>
<p>saluted the cardinal-generalissimo, and presented to him
</p>
<p>the officers who had come from the camp with him.
</p>
<p>He talked some time of the operations of the siege, and
</p>
<p>the cardinal seemed, as it were, to be paying him court
</p>
<p>now, in order to prepare him afterwards for receiving
</p>
<p>his orders even on the field of battle ; he spoke to the
</p>
<p>officers who accompanied him, calling them by their
</p>
<p>names, and questioning them about the camp.
</p>
<p>They all stood aside to make way for the Due d'An-
</p>
<p>goul(;nie, that Valois, who, after having struggled
</p>
<p>against Henri IV., now prostrated himself before
</p>
<p>Richelieu. He solicited a command, having been only
</p>
<p>third in rank at the siege of Rochelle. After him
</p>
<p>came young Mazarin, ever supple and insinuating, but
</p>
<p>already confident in his fortune.
</p>
<p>The Due d'Halluin came after them ; the cardinal
</p>
<p>broke off the compliments he was addressing to the
</p>
<p>others, to utter in a loud voic^,
</p>
<p>" M. le Due, I inform you with pleasure that the
</p>
<p>king has made you a marshal of France ; you will
</p>
<p>sign yourself Schomberg, will you not, at Leucate,

<p>delivered, as we hope, by you ? But pardon me, here

</p>
<p>is M. de Montauron, who has doubtless something
</p>
<p>important to communicate."
</p>
<p>" Oh, no, my Lord, I would only say that the poor
</p>
<p>young man whom you deigned to consider in your
</p>
<p>service is dying of hunger."
</p>
<p>" Pshaw ! at such a moment to speak of things like
</p>
<p>this ! Your little Corneille will not write anything
</p>
<p>good ; we have only seen the ' Cid ' and ' Les Horaces'
</p>
<p>as yet. Let him work, let him work ; it is known that
</p>
<p>he is in my service, and that is disagreeable. However,
</p>
<p>since you interest yourself in the matter, I give him a
</p>
<p>pension of five hundred crowns on my privy purse."
</p>
<p>And the chancellor of the exchequer retired, charmed
</p>
<p>with the liberality of the minister, and went home to
</p>
<p>receive with great affability the dedication of " Cinna,"
</p>
<p>wherein the great Corneille compares his soul to that of
</p>
<p>Augustus, and thanks him for having given alms a
</p>
<p>quelques Muses.
</p>
<p>The cardinal, vexed by this importunity, rose, ob-
</p>
<p>serving that the day was advancing, and that it was
</p>
<p>time to set out to visit the king.
</p>
<p>At this moment, and as the greatest noblemen present
</p>
<p>were offering their arms to aid him in walking, a man
</p>
<p>in the robe of a referendary advanced towards him,
</p>
<p>saluting him with a complacent and confident smile
</p>
<p>which astonished all the people there, accustomed to
</p>
<p>the great world, seeming as it did to say, " "We have
</p>
<p>secret affairs together ; you shall see how agreeable he
</p>
<p>makes himself to me. I am at home in his cabinet."
</p>
<p>His heavy and awkward manner, however, betrayed a

</p>
<p>Richelieu knit his brows when he saw him before him,
</p>
<p>and cast a glance at Joseph ; then turning towards those
</p>
<p>who surrounded him, he said with bitter scorn,
</p>
<p>" Is there some criminal about us to be apprehended ?
</p>
<p>Then turning his back upon the utterly discomfited
</p>
<p>Laubardemont, the cardinal left him redder than his
</p>
<p>robe, and preceded by the crowd of personages who were
</p>
<p>to escort him in carriages or on horseback, he descended
</p>
<p>the great staircase of the palace.
</p>
<p>All the people and authorities of Narbonne viewed
</p>
<p>this royal departure with stupefaction.
</p>
<p>The cardinal entered alone a spacious litter of a
</p>
<p>square form, in which he was to travel to Perpignan,
</p>
<p>his infirmities not permitting him to go in a coach, or to
</p>
<p>perform the journey on horseback. This kind of moving
</p>
<p>chamber contained a bed, a table, and a small chair for
</p>
<p>the page who wrote or read for him. This machine,
</p>
<p>covered with purple damask, was carried by eighteen
</p>
<p>men, who were relieved at intervals of a league ; they
</p>
<p>were selected from among his guards, and always per-
</p>
<p>formed this service of honor with uncovered heads,
</p>
<p>however hot or wet the weather might be. The Due
</p>
<p>d'Angouleme, the Marshals de Schomberg and d'Estrees,
</p>
<p>Fabert and other dignitaries, were on horseback beside
</p>
<p>the litter ; after them, among the most forward were
</p>
<p>observed Cardinal de la Vallette and Mazarin, with Cha-
</p>
<p>vigny, and the Mare'chal de Vitry, anxious to avoid the
</p>
<p>Bastille, with which it was said he was threatened.
</p>
<p>Two coaches followed for the cardinal's secretaries,
</p>
<p>physicians, and confessor ; then eight others, each with

<p>his luggage. Two hundred musketeers on foot marched
</p>
<p>close after him, and his company of men-at-arms of the
</p>
<p>guard and his light-horse, all of them gentlemen, rode
</p>
<p>before and behind him on splendid horses.
</p>
<p>Such was the equipage in which the prime minister
</p>
<p>proceeded to Perpignan; the size of the litter often made
</p>
<p>it necessary to enlarge the roads, and knock down the
</p>
<p>walls of some of the towns and villages on the way, into
</p>
<p>which it could not otherwise enter, " so that," say the
</p>
<p>authors and manuscripts of the time, full of a sincere

<p>admiration for all this luxury, " so that he seemed a

<p>THE INTERVIEW.
</p>
<p>" Mon genie etonne tremble devant le sien."
</p>
<p>THE pompous cortege of the cardinal stopped at the
</p>
<p>entrance to the camp. All the troops under arms were
</p>
<p>drawn up in the finest order ; and it was amid the sound
</p>
<p>of cannon and the music of each regiment that the litter
</p>
<p>traversed a long line of cavalry and infantry, formed
</p>
<p>from the outermost tent to that of the minister, pitched
</p>
<p>at some distance from the royal quarters, and which
</p>
<p>its purple covering distinguished at a distance. Each
</p>
<p>general of division obtained a nod or a word from the
</p>
<p>cardinal, who at length reaching his tent and dismissing
</p>
<p>his train shut himself in, waiting for the time to present
</p>
<p>himself to the king. But, before him, every person of
</p>
<p>his escort had repaired thither individually, and without
</p>
<p>entering the royal abode, collected in the long galleries
</p>
<p>covered with striped stuff, and arranged as became ave-

</p>
<p>groups, saluted one another and shook hands, regarding
</p>
<p>each other haughtily, according to their connections or
</p>
<p>the lords to whom they belonged. Others whispered to-
</p>
<p>gether and gave signs of astonishment, pleasure, or anger,
</p>
<p>which showed that something extraordinary had taken
</p>
<p>place. Among a thousand others, one singular dialogue
</p>
<p>occurred in a corner of the principal gallery.
</p>
<p>" May I ask, M. TAbbe", why you look at me so
</p>
<p>fixedly?"
</p>
<p>"Parbleu! M. de Launay, 'tis because I'm curious to
</p>
<p>see what you will do. All the world abandons your
</p>
<p>cardinal-due since your journey into Touraine ; if you
</p>
<p>do not believe it, go and ask the people of Monsieur or
</p>
<p>of the queen. You are behindhand ten minutes by the
</p>
<p>watch with the Cardinal de la Vallette, who has just
</p>
<p>shaken hands with Rochefort and the gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>late Comte de Soissons, whom I shall regret as long as
</p>
<p>I live." .
</p>
<p>"Well, M. de Gondi, I understand you; 'tis a chal-
</p>
<p>lenge with which you honor me ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, M. le Comte," answered the young abbe, salut-
</p>
<p>ing him with all the gravity of the time ; " I sought an
</p>
<p>occasion to challenge you in the name of M. d'Attichi,
</p>
<p>my friend, with whom you had something to do at
</p>
<p>Paris."
</p>
<p>" M. I'Abbe", I am at your command. I will seek my
</p>
<p>seconds ; do you the same."
</p>
<p>" On horseback, with sword and pistol, I suppose ? "
</p>
<p>added Gondi, with the air of a man arranging a party
</p>
<p>of pleasure, brushing the sleeve of his cassock with his
</p>
<p>finger.

</p>
<p>"If you please," replied the other. And they sepa-
</p>
<p>rated for a time, saluting one another with the greatest
</p>
<p>politeness, and with profound bows.
</p>
<p>A brilliant crowd of gentlemen circulated around them
</p>
<p>in the gallery. They mixed in it to procure friends for
</p>
<p>the occasion. All the elegance of the costumes of the
</p>
<p>day were displayed by the court that morning, small
</p>
<p>cloaks of every color, in velvet or in satin, embroidered
</p>
<p>with gold or silver ; crosses of Saint Michael and of the
</p>
<p>Holy Ghost ; the ruffs, the infinite hat-plumes, the gold
</p>
<p>shoulder-knots, the chains by which the long swords
</p>
<p>hung: all glittered and sparkled, yet not so brilliantly
</p>
<p>as did the fiery glances of those warlike youths, or their
</p>
<p>sprightly conversation, or their intellectual laughter.
</p>
<p>Amid the assembly, grave personages and great lords
</p>
<p>passed on, followed by their numerous gentlemen.
</p>
<p>The little Abbe" de Gondi, who was very short-sighted,
</p>
<p>made his way through the crowd, knitting his brows
</p>
<p>and half shutting his eyes, that he might see the better,
</p>
<p>and twisting his mustache, for ecclesiastics wore them
</p>
<p>in those days. He looked closely at every one in order
</p>
<p>to recognize his friends, and at last stopped before a
</p>
<p>young man, very tall and dressed in black from head to
</p>
<p>foot ; his sword, even, was of quite dark bronzed steel.
</p>
<p>He was talking with a captain of the guards, when the
</p>
<p>Abb de Gondi took him aside.
</p>
<p>" M. de Thou," said he, " I need you as my second in
</p>
<p>an hour, on horseback, with sword and pistol, if you will
</p>
<p>do me that honor."
</p>
<p>" Sir, you know I am entirely at your service on all

</p>
<p>" In front of the Spanish bastion, if you please."
</p>
<p>"Pardon me for returning to a conversation that
</p>
<p>greatly interests me. I will be punctual to the
</p>
<p>rendezvous."
</p>
<p>And De Thou quitted him to rejoin the captain. He
</p>
<p>had said all this in the gentlest of voices with unalter-
</p>
<p>able coolness, and even with somewhat of an abstracted
</p>
<p>manner.
</p>
<p>The little abb6 squeezed his hand with warm satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion, and continued his search.
</p>
<p>He did not so easily effect an agreement with the
</p>
<p>young lords to whom he addressed himself; for they
</p>
<p>knew him better than did De Thou, and when they saw
</p>
<p>him coming at a distance, they tried to avoid him, or
</p>
<p>laughed at him to his face, and would not engage to
</p>
<p>serve him.
</p>
<p>" Ah, Abbe* ! there you are hunting again ; I '11 engage
</p>
<p>it's a second you want," said the Due de Beaufort.
</p>
<p>" And I wager,'' added M. de la Rochefoucauld, " that
</p>
<p>it 's against one of the cardinal-due's people."
</p>
<p>" You are both right, gentlemen ; but since when
</p>
<p>laugh you at affairs of honor?"
</p>
<p>" The saints forbid I should," said M. de Beaufort.
</p>
<p>" Men of the sword like us ever reverence tierce, quarte,
</p>
<p>and octave ; but as for the folds of the cassock, I know
</p>
<p>nothing of them."
</p>
<p>" Pardieu ! sir, you know well enough that it does not
</p>
<p>embarrass my wrist, as I will prove to him who choose ;
</p>
<p>as to the gown itself, I should like to throw it into the
</p>
<p>gutter."

</p>
<p>La Rochefoucauld. "But remember, my dear abbe*,
</p>
<p>that you are inside it."
</p>
<p>Gondi turned round to look at the clock, anxious to
</p>
<p>lose no more time in such sorry jests ; but he had no
</p>
<p>better success elsewhere. Having stopped two gentlemen
</p>
<p>in the service of the young queen, whom he thought
</p>
<p>ill-affected towards the cardinal, and consequently glad
</p>
<p>to measure swords with his creatures, one of them said
</p>
<p>to him very gravely,
</p>
<p>" M. de Gondi, you know what has just happened ;
</p>
<p>the king has said aloud, ' Whether our imperious cardi-
</p>
<p>nal please or no, the widow of Henri le Grand shall no
</p>
<p>longer remain in exile.' Imperious ! the king never
</p>
<p>before said anything so strong as that, M. PAbbe', mark
</p>
<p>that. Imperious ! it is a clear disgrace. Assuredly no
</p>
<p>one will venture to speak to him ; he will quit the court
</p>
<p>this very day."
</p>
<p>" I have heard this, sir, but I have an affair "
</p>
<p>" It is lucky for you he stopped short in the middle of
</p>
<p>your career."
</p>
<p>" An affair of honor "
</p>
<p>" Whereas Mazarin is quite a friend of yours."
</p>
<p>" But will you, or will you not, listen to me ? "
</p>
<p>" Ay, a friend indeed ! your adventures are always run-
</p>
<p>ning in his head. Your fine duel with M. de Coutenan
</p>
<p>about the pretty little pin-seller, he even spoke of it to'
</p>
<p>the king. Adieu, my dear abbe*, we are in a great
</p>
<p>hurry ; adieu, adieu ! " And taking his friend's arm,
</p>
<p>the young banterer, without listening to another word,
</p>
<p>rapidly walked down the gallery and disappeared in the

<p>crowd.
</p>
<p>THE INTERVIEW. 133
</p>
<p>The poor abb6 was standing very mortified at only
</p>
<p>being -able to get one second, and watching grievously
</p>
<p>the departure of the hour and of the crowd, when he
</p>
<p>perceived a young gentleman whom he did not know,
</p>
<p>seated at a table, leaning on his elbow with a melan-
</p>
<p>choly air ; he wore mourning which indicated no con-
</p>
<p>nection with any great house or party, and seeming to
</p>
<p>await, without any impatience, the time for attending the
</p>
<p>king, looked with a heedless air at those who surrounded
</p>
<p>him, seeming not to notice or to know any of them.
</p>
<p>Gondi accosted him without hesitation :
</p>
<p>"Faith, sir, I have not the honor of your acquain-
</p>
<p>tance, but a fencing party can never be unpleasant to a
</p>
<p>man of honor ; and if you will be my second, in a quar-
</p>
<p>ter of an hour we shall be on the ground. I am Paul de
</p>
<p>Gondi ; and I have challenged M. de Launay, one of the
</p>
<p>cardinal's faction, but in other respects a very gallant
</p>
<p>fellow."
</p>
<p>The unknown, seeming in no way surprised at this
</p>
<p>address, answered without altering his position, " And
</p>
<p>who are his seconds ? "
</p>
<p>"Faith, I don't know; but what matters it who sec-
</p>
<p>onds him ? We stand no worse with our friends for
</p>
<p>having exchanged a thrust with them."
</p>
<p>The stranger smiled carelessly, paused for an instant
</p>
<p>to pass his hand through his long chestnut hair, and
</p>
<p>then said, drowsily looking at a large round watch which
</p>
<p>hung at his girdle,
</p>
<p>" Well, sir, as I have nothing better to do, and as I
</p>
<p>have no friends here, I am with you ; 't will pass the

</p>
<p>time as well as anything else."
</p>
<p>134 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>And taking his large black plumed hat off the table,
</p>
<p>he followed the warlike abbe", who hurried on before
</p>
<p>him, ever and anon running back to hasten him on, like
</p>
<p>a child running before his father, or a young dog that
</p>
<p>goes backwards and forwards twenty times before it gets
</p>
<p>to the end of a lane.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two ushers, clothed in the royal livery,
</p>
<p>opened the great curtains which separated the gallery
</p>
<p>from the king's tent, and silence became universal. The
</p>
<p>courtiers began to enter slowly, and in succession, the
</p>
<p>temporary dwelling of the prince. He received them all
</p>
<p>gracefully, and himself first met the view of each person
</p>
<p>introduced.
</p>
<p>Before a very small table surrounded with gilt arm-
</p>
<p>chairs stood Louis XIIL, encircled by the great officers
</p>
<p>of the crown. His dress was very elegant : a kind of
</p>
<p>fawn-colored vest, with open sleeves, ornamented with
</p>
<p>shoulder-knots and blue ribbons, covered him down to
</p>
<p>the waist. Wide breeches reached only to above the
</p>
<p>knee, and the yellow and red striped stuff of which they
</p>
<p>were composed was ornamented below with blue ribbons.
</p>
<p>His boots a VScuyere, reaching scarcely more than three
</p>
<p>inches above his ankle, were turned down with such a
</p>
<p>profusion of lace that they seemed to hold it as a vase
</p>
<p>holds flowers. A small mantle of blue velvet, on which
</p>
<p>was embroidered the cross of the Holy Ghost, covered
</p>
<p>the king's left arm, which rested on the hilt of his
</p>
<p>sword.
</p>
<p>His head was uncovered, and his pale and noble face
</p>
<p>was perfectly visible, lighted up by the sun, which pene-

</p>
<p>trated through the top of the tent. The small pointed
</p>
<p>THE INTERVIEW. 135
</p>
<p>beard then worn aggravated the thinness of his face,
</p>
<p>while it added to its melancholy expression ; by his lofty
</p>
<p>brow, his classical profile, his aquiline nose, was at once
</p>
<p>recognized a prince of the great race of Bourbon. He
</p>
<p>had all the characteristic traits of his ancestors except
</p>
<p>their potent glance ; his eyes seemed red with tears, and
</p>
<p>veiled with a perpetual sleep ; and the weakness of his
</p>
<p>sight gave him a somewhat vacant look.
</p>
<p>On this occasion, he ostentatiously called around him
</p>
<p>and was attentive to the greatest enemies of the cardinal,
</p>
<p>whom he expected every moment ; and balancing himself
</p>
<p>with one foot over the other, an hereditary habit of his
</p>
<p>family, he spoke quickly, but stopping from time to time
</p>
<p>to make a gracious inclination of the head, or a gesture
</p>
<p>of the hand, to those who passed before him with low
</p>
<p>bows.
</p>
<p>The court had been thus paying its respects to the
</p>
<p>king for two hours ere the cardinal appeared ; the whole
</p>
<p>court was collected in close ranks behind the prince,
</p>
<p>and in the long galleries which extended from his tent.
</p>
<p>Already a longer interval began to elapse between the
</p>

</p>
<p>" Shall we not see our cousin the cardinal ? " said
</p>
<p>the king, turning round, and looking at Montresor,
</p>
<p>one of Monsieur's gentlemen, as if to encourage him
</p>
<p>to answer.
</p>
<p>" He is said to be very ill just now, Sire," was the
</p>
<p>answer.
</p>
<p>" And yet I do not see how any but your Majesty can
</p>
<p>cure him," said the Due de Beaufort.

<p>" We cure nothing but the evil," replied Louis ; " and

</p>
<p>the complaints of the cardinal are always so mysterious
</p>
<p>that we own we cannot at all understand them."
</p>
<p>The prince thus essayed to brave his minister before-
</p>
<p>hand, gaining strength in jests, the better to break his
</p>
<p>yoke, so insupportable but so difficult to remove. He
</p>
<p>almost thought he had succeeded in this, and, supported
</p>
<p>by the joyous air of all who surrounded him, he already
</p>
<p>inwardly congratulated himself on having been able to
</p>
<p>assume the supreme empire, and for the moment enjoyed
</p>
<p>all the power he thought himself possessed of. An in-
</p>
<p>voluntary agitation in the depth of his heart had warned
</p>
<p>him indeed that, the hour passed, all the weight of the
</p>
<p>State would fall upon himself alone ; but he talked in
</p>
<p>order to divert the troublesome thought, and concealing
</p>
<p>from himself the firm assurance he had of his own in-
</p>
<p>ability to reign, he set his imagination to work upon the
</p>
<p>result of his enterprises, thus forcing himself to forget
</p>
<p>the tedious roads which led to them. Rapid sentences
</p>
<p>succeeded one another on his lips.
</p>
<p>" We shall soon take Perpignan," he said to Fabert,
</p>
<p>who stood at some distance.
</p>
<p>" Well, Cardinal, Lorraine is ours," he added to La
</p>
<p>Vallette. Then touching Mazarin's arm,
</p>
<p>" It is not so difficult to conduct a State as is sup-
</p>
<p>posed, eh?"
</p>
<p>The Italian, who was not so sure as most of the cour-
</p>
<p>tiers of the cardinal's disgrace, answered without com-
</p>
<p>promising himself,
</p>
<p>" Ah, Sire, the late successes of your Majesty at home
</p>
<p>and abroad manifest your skill in choosing your instru-

<p>THE INTERVIEW. 137
</p>
<p>But the Due de Beaufort, interrupting him with that
</p>
<p>self-sufficiency, that loud voice and air, which subse-
</p>
<p>quently procured him the surname of Important, cried
</p>
<p>out vehemently,
</p>
<p>" Pardieu ! Sire, it needs only to will. A nation is
</p>
<p>driven like a horse, with spur and bridle ; and as we
</p>
<p>are all good horsemen, there are plenty to choose
</p>
<p>among."
</p>
<p>This fine sally of the coxcomb due had not time to
</p>
<p>take effect, for two ushers cried at the same moment,
</p>
<p>" His Eminence ! "
</p>
<p>The king reddened involuntarily, as if surprised en
</p>
<p>flagrant delit. But immediately resuming confidence,
</p>
<p>he put on an air of resolute haughtiness, which was not
</p>
<p>lost upon the minister.
</p>
<p>The latter, attired in all the pomp of a cardinal, lean-
</p>
<p>ing upon two young pages, and followed by his captain
</p>
<p>of the guards and more than five hundred gentlemen at-
</p>
<p>tached to his house, advanced towards the king slowly
</p>
<p>and stopping at each step, as if forcibly arrested by his
</p>
<p>sufferings, but in reality to observe the faces before
</p>
<p>him. A glance sufficed.
</p>
<p>His suite remained at the entrance of the royal tent ;
</p>
<p>of all those within it, not one was bold enough to salute
</p>
<p>him, or to look towards him. Even La Vallette feigned
</p>
<p>to be deeply occupied in a conversation with Montre'sor ;
</p>
<p>and the king, who desired to give him an unfavorable re-
</p>
<p>ception, greeted him lightly and continued a conversation
</p>
<p>aside in a low voice with the Due de Beaufort.
</p>
<p>The cardinal was therefore forced, after the first

</p>
<p>salute, to stop and pass to the side of the crowd of
</p>
<p>138 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>courtiers, as though he wished to mix with them, but
</p>
<p>in reality to test them more closely ; they all recoiled as
</p>
<p>at the sight of a leper. Fabert alone advanced towards
</p>
<p>him with the frank and blunt air habitual with him,
</p>
<p>and making use of the terms belonging to his profession,
</p>
<p>said,
</p>
<p>" Well, my Lord, you make a breach in the midst of
</p>
<p>them like a cannon-ball ; I ask pardon in their name."
</p>
<p>"And you stand firm before me as before the enemy,"
</p>
<p>said the cardinal ; " you will have no cause to regret it
</p>
<p>in the end, my dear Fabert."
</p>
<p>Mazarin also approached the cardinal, but with cau-
</p>
<p>tion, and giving to his flexible features an expression of
</p>
<p>profound sadness, made him five or six very low bows,
</p>
<p>turning his back to the group gathered round the king,
</p>
<p>so that in the latter quarter they might be taken for
</p>
<p>those cold and hasty salutations which are made to a
</p>
<p>person one desires to be rid of, and, on the part of the
</p>
<p>due, for tokens of respect, blended with a discreet and
</p>
<p>silent sorrow.
</p>
<p>The minister, ever calm, smiled in disdain ; and as-
</p>
<p>suming that firm look and that air of grandeur which
</p>
<p>he wore so perfectly in the hour of danger, he again
</p>
<p>leaned upon his pages, and without waiting for a word
</p>
<p>or glance from his sovereign, he suddenly resolved upon
</p>
<p>his line of conduct, and walked directly towards him,
</p>
<p>traversing the whole length of the tent. No one had
</p>
<p>lost sight of him, although affecting not to observe him.
</p>
<p>Every one now became silent, even those who were
</p>
<p>talking to the king; all the courtiers bent forward to

<p>THE INTERVIEW. 139
</p>
<p>Louis XIII. turned round in astonishment, and all
</p>
<p>presence of mind totally failing him, remained motion-
</p>
<p>less, and waited with an icy glance, his sole force, but
</p>
<p>a vis inertia} very effectual in a prince.
</p>
<p>The cardinal, on coming close to the prince, did not
</p>
<p>bow; and without changing his position, his eyes
</p>
<p>lowered and his hands placed on the shoulders of the
</p>
<p>two boys half bending, he said,
</p>
<p>" Sire, I come to implore your Majesty at length to
</p>
<p>grant me the retirement for which I have long sighed.
</p>
<p>My health is failing; I feel that my life will soon be
</p>
<p>ended. Eternity approaches me, and before rendering an
</p>
<p>account to the eternal King, I would render one to my
</p>
<p>temporal sovereign. It is eighteen years, Sire, since you
</p>
<p>placed in my hands a weak and divided kingdom ; I
</p>
<p>return it to you united and powerful. Your enemies
</p>
<p>are overthrown and humiliated. My work is accom-
</p>
<p>plished. I ask your Majesty's permission to retire to
</p>
<p>Citeaux, of which 1 am abbot, and where I may end my
</p>
<p>days in prayer and meditation."
</p>
<p>The king, irritated with some haughty expressions in
</p>
<p>this address, showed none of the signs of weakness
</p>
<p>which the cardinal 'had expected, and which he had
</p>
<p>always seen in him when he had threatened to resign
</p>
<p>the management of affairs. On the contrary, feeling
</p>
<p>that he had the eyes of the whole court upon him, Louis
</p>
<p>looked upon him with the air of a king, and coldly
</p>
<p>replied,
</p>
<p>" We thank you, then, for your services, M. le
</p>
<p>Cardinal, and wish you the repose you desire."

</p>
<p>Richelieu was deeply angered, but no indication of his
</p>
<p>140 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>rage appeared upon his countenance. " Such was the
</p>
<p>coldness with which you left Montmorency to die,"
</p>
<p>he said to himself ; " but you shall not escape me
</p>
<p>thus." He then continued aloud, bowing at the same
</p>
<p>time,
</p>
<p>" The only recompense I ask for my services is that
</p>
<p>your Majesty will deign to accept from me, as a gift, the
</p>
<p>Palais-Cardinal \ have lately erected at my own cost in
</p>
<p>Paris."
</p>
<p>The king, astonished, bowed in token of assent. A
</p>
<p>murmur of surprise for a moment agitated the attentive
</p>
<p>court.
</p>
<p>" I also petition your Majesty to grant me the revo-
</p>
<p>cation of an act of rigor, which I solicited (I publicly
</p>
<p>confess it), and which I perhaps regarded as too bene-
</p>
<p>ficial to the repose of the State. Yes, when I was of
</p>
<p>this world, I was too forgetful of my old sentiments of
</p>
<p>personal respect and attachment, in my eagerness for
</p>
<p>the public welfare ; now that I already enjoy the enlight-
</p>
<p>enment of solitude, I see that I have been wrong, and I
</p>
<p>repent."
</p>
<p>The attention of the spectators was redoubled, and
</p>
<p>the uneasiness of the king became visible.
</p>
<p>" Yes, there is one person, Sire, whom I have always
</p>
<p>loved, despite her wrongs towards you, and the banish-
</p>
<p>ment which the affairs of the kingdom forced me to pro-
</p>
<p>cure for her ; a person to whom I have owed much, and
</p>
<p>who should be very dear to you, notwithstanding her
</p>
<p>armed attempts against you ; a person, in a word, whom
</p>
<p>I implore you to recall from exile, the queen Marie de

</p>
<p>THE INTERVIEW. 141
</p>
<p>The king sent forth an involuntary exclamation, so
</p>
<p>far was he from expecting to hear that name. A
</p>
<p>repressed agitation suddenly appeared upon every face.
</p>
<p>All awaited in silence the king's reply. Louis XIII.
</p>
<p>looked for a long time at his old minister without speak-
</p>
<p>ing, and this look decided the fate of France ; in that
</p>
<p>instant, he called to mind all the indefatigable services
</p>
<p>of Richelieu, his unbounded devotion, his wonderful
</p>
<p>capacity, and was surprised at himself for having wished
</p>
<p>to part with him. He felt deeply affected at this request,
</p>
<p>which hunted out, as it were, the exact cause of his
</p>
<p>anger at the bottom of his heart, rooted it up, and took
</p>
<p>from his hands the only weapon he had against his old
</p>
<p>servant; filial love brought the words of pardon to his
</p>
<p>lips and tears into his eyes. Delighted to grant what he
</p>
<p>desired most of all things in the world, he extended his
</p>
<p>hand to the due with all the nobleness and kindliness of
</p>
<p>a Bourbon. The cardinal bowed, and respectfully kissed
</p>
<p>it ; and his heart, which should have burst with remorse,
</p>
<p>only swelled in the joy of a haughty triumph.
</p>
<p>The prince, much moved, abandoning his hand to
</p>
<p>him, turned gracefully towards his court and said with
</p>
<p>a tremulous voice,
</p>
<p>" We often deceive ourselves, gentlemen, and espe-
</p>
<p>cially in our knowledge of so great a politician as this ;
</p>
<p>I hope he will never leave us, since his heart is as good
</p>
<p>as his head."
</p>
<p>Cardinal de la Vallette on the instant seized the arm
</p>
<p>of the king's mantle, and kissed it with all the ardor
</p>
<p>of a lover, and the young Mazarin did much the same

<p>with Richelieu himself, assuming with admirable Italian

</p>
<p>suppleness an expression radiant with joyful emotion.
</p>
<p>Two streams of flatterers hastened, one towards the
</p>
<p>king, the other towards the minister ; the former group,
</p>
<p>not less adroit than the second, although less direct,
</p>
<p>addressed to the prince thanks which could be heard by
</p>
<p>the minister, and burned at the feet of the one incense
</p>
<p>which was destined for the other. As for Kichelieu,
</p>
<p>bestowing a bow on the right and a smile on the left,
</p>
<p>he stepped forward, and stood on the right hand of the
</p>
<p>king, as his natural place. A stranger entering would
</p>
<p>rather have thought, indeed, that it was the king who
</p>
<p>was on the cardinal's left hand. The Mare'chal d'Es-
</p>
<p>tre*es, all the ambassadors, the Due d'Angouleme, the
</p>
<p>Due d'Halluin (Schomberg), the Marechal de Ch 3, till on,
</p>
<p>and all the great officers of the crown, surrounded him,
</p>
<p>each waiting impatiently for the compliments of the
</p>
<p>others to be finished, in order to pay his own, fearing
</p>
<p>lest some one else should anticipate him with the flatter-
</p>
<p>ing epigram he had just improvised, or the turn of
</p>
<p>adulation he was inventing. As for Fabert, he had
</p>
<p>retired to a corner of the tent, and seemed to have paid
</p>
<p>no particular attention to the scene. He was chatting
</p>
<p>with Montre'sor and the gentlemen of Monsieur, all
</p>
<p>sworn enemies of the cardinal, because, out of the crowd
</p>
<p>he avoided, he had found none but these to speak to.
</p>
<p>This conduct would have seemed extremely unskilful in
</p>
<p>one less known ; but he was a man who, though living
</p>
<p>in the midst of the court, was ever ignorant of its in-
</p>
<p>trigues. It was said of him that he returned from a
</p>
<p>battle he had gained, like the king's hunting horse,

</p>
<p>quarry, without seeking even to remember the part he
</p>
<p>had had in the triumph.
</p>
<p>The storm, then, seemed entirely appeased, and to
</p>
<p>the violent agitations of the morning there succeeded a
</p>
<p>gentle calm ; a respectful murmur, varied with pleasant
</p>
<p>laughter and protestations of attachment, was all that
</p>
<p>was heard in the tent. The voice of the cardinal arose
</p>
<p>from time to time : " The dear queen ! We shall, then,
</p>
<p>soon again see her ! I had never dared to hope such
</p>
<p>happiness while I lived ! " The king listened to him
</p>
<p>with full confidence, and did not attempt to conceal his
</p>
<p>satisfaction. "It was assuredly an idea sent to him
</p>
<p>from on high," he said ; " this good cardinal, against
</p>
<p>whom they had so incensed me, was thinking only of
</p>
<p>the union of my family. Since the birth of the dauphin
</p>
<p>I have not tasted greater joy than at this moment.
</p>
<p>The protection of the holy Virgin is manifested over
</p>
<p>the kingdom."
</p>
<p>At this moment, a captain of the guards came up and
</p>
<p>whispered in the king's ear.
</p>
<p>" A courier from Cologne ? " said the king ; " let him
</p>
<p>wait in my cabinet."
</p>
<p>Then, unable to restrain his impatience, " I come ! I
</p>
<p>come ! " he said, and entered alone a small square tent
</p>
<p>attached to the great one. In it was observed a young
</p>
<p>courier holding a black portfolio, and the curtains closed
</p>
<p>upon the king.
</p>
<p>The cardinal, left sole master of the court, concen-
</p>
<p>trated all its homage ; but it was observed that he no
</p>
<p>longer received it with his former presence o mind. He

<p>frequently inquired what time it was, and exhibited an
</p>
<p>CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>anxiety clearly unfeigned ; his hard, unquiet glances
</p>
<p>were cast towards the closet. It suddenly opened ; the
</p>
<p>king appeared alone, and stopped on the threshold. He
</p>
<p>was paler than usual, and trembled in every limb ; he
</p>
<p>held in his hand a large letter with five black seals.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen," said he, with a loud but broken voice,
</p>
<p>"the queen has just died at Cologne; and I perhaps am
</p>
<p>not the first who have heard of it," he added, casting a
</p>
<p>severe look towards the impassible cardinal, " but God
</p>
<p>knows all. To horse in an hour, and attack the lines !
</p>
<p>Marshals, follow me." And he turned his back ab-
</p>
<p>ruptly, and re-entered his cabinet with them.
</p>
<p>The court retired after the minister, who, without
</p>
<p>giving any sign of sorrow or annoyance, went forth as
</p>
<p>gravely as he had entered, but now a victor.

<p>THERE are moments in our life when we long for vigor-

<p>the soul, like the lion in the fable, wearied with the con-

<p>tinual attacks of the gnat, earnestly desires a mightier
</p>
<p>enemy and real dangers. Cinq-Mars experienced this
</p>
<p>condition of mind, which always results from a morbid

<p>sensibility in the organic constitution and a perpetual
</p>
<p>agitation of the heart. Weary of constantly turning over

<p>in his thoughts a combination of the events which he
</p>
<p>desired, and of those which he dreaded ; of calculating

<p>his chances to the best of his power ; of summoning to

<p>146 CINQ-MARS,
</p>
<p>his dreams, predictions, fancies, and all that imaginary
</p>
<p>world in which he had existed during his solitary jour-
</p>
<p>ney, he breathed freely upon finding himself thrown
</p>
<p>into a real world almost as full of agitation; and the
</p>
<p>sensation of two actual dangers restored circulation to
</p>
<p>his blood, and youth to all his being.
</p>
<p>Since the nocturnal scene at the inn near Loudun, he
</p>
<p>had not been able to resume sufficient empire over his
</p>
<p>mind to occupy himself with anything save his beloved
</p>
<p>though mournful reflections ; and consumption was al-
</p>
<p>ready threatening his frame, when happily he arrived at
</p>
<p>the camp of Perpignan, and happily also had the oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of accepting the proposition of the Abbe" de Gondi,
</p>
<p>for the reader has no doubt recognized Cinq-Mars
</p>
<p>in the person of that young stranger in mourning, so
</p>
<p>indifferent and so melancholy, whom the duellist in the
</p>
<p>cassock took for his second.
</p>
<p>He had ordered his tent to be pitched as a volunteer
</p>
<p>in the street of the camp assigned to the young noble-
</p>
<p>men who were to be presented to the king and were to
</p>
<p>serve as aides-de-camp to the generals ; he soon repaired
</p>
<p>thither, and was quickly armed, horsed, and cuirassed,
</p>
<p>according to the custom of the time, and proceeded alone
</p>
<p>to the Spanish bastion, the place of rendezvous. He
</p>
<p>was there first, and found that a small plot of turf,
</p>
<p>hidden among the works of the besieged place, had been
</p>
<p>well chosen by the little abbe" for his homicidal purposes ;
</p>
<p>for besides that no one would have suspected officers of

<p>going to fight one another immediately beneath the town

<p>precautions, for at that time it cost a man his head to
</p>
<p>give himself the satisfaction of hazarding his body.
</p>
<p>While waiting for his friends and adversaries, Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars had time to examine the south side of Perpignan,
</p>
<p>before which he stood. He had heard that these works
</p>
<p>were not those which were to be attacked, and he tried
</p>
<p>in vain to account for the besiegers' projects. Between
</p>
<p>this southern face of the town, the mountains of Albe"re,
</p>
<p>and the Col du Perthus, there might have been advanta-
</p>
<p>geous lines of attack, and redoubts against the accessible
</p>
<p>point ; but not a single soldier was stationed there. All
</p>
<p>the forces seemed directed upon the north of Perpignan,
</p>
<p>upon the most difficult side, against a brick fort called
</p>
<p>the Castillet, which surmounted the gate of Notre-Dame.
</p>
<p>He discovered that a piece of ground apparently marshy,
</p>
<p>but really very solid, led up to the very foot of the Span-
</p>
<p>ish bastion ; that this post was guarded with true Castil-
</p>
<p>ian negligence, although its sole strength lay entirely in
</p>
<p>its defenders, for its battlements, almost in ruin, were
</p>
<p>furnished with four pieces of cannon of enormous calibre,
</p>
<p>embedded in the turf, and thus rendered immovable,
</p>
<p>and impo'&Sible to be directed against a troop advancing
</p>
<p>rapidly to the foot of the wall.
</p>
<p>It was easy to perceive that these enormous pieces
</p>
<p>had discouraged the besiegers from attacking this point,
</p>
<p>and kept the besieged from any idea of addition to its
</p>
<p>means of defence. Thus, on the one side, the vedettes
</p>
<p>and advanced posts were at a distance, and on the other,
</p>
<p>the sentinels were few and ill supported. A young

</p>
<p>at his side and the burning match in his right hand,
</p>
<p>who was walking with nonchalance upon the rampart,
</p>
<p>stopped to look at Cinq-Mars, who was riding about the
</p>
<p>ditches and moats.
</p>
<p>" Senor caballero" said he, " are you going to take
</p>
<p>the bastion by yourself on horseback, like Don Quixote,
</p>
<p>Quixada de la Mancha ? "
</p>
<p>And at the same time he detached from his side the
</p>
<p>iron rest, planted it in the ground, and supported upon
</p>
<p>it the barrel of his gun in order to take aim, when a
</p>
<p>grave and older Spaniard, enveloped in a dirty brown
</p>
<p>cloak, said to him in his own tongue,
</p>
<p>"Ambrosio de Demonic, don't you know very well that
</p>
<p>it is forbidden to throw away powder uselessly, before
</p>
<p>sallies or attacks are made, merely to have the pleasure
</p>
<p>of killing a child not worth your match ? It was in this
</p>
<p>very place that Charles V. threw the sleeping sentinel
</p>
<p>into the ditch and drowned him. Do your duty, or I will
</p>
<p>follow his example."
</p>
<p>Ambrosio replaced his gun upon his shoulder, his rest
</p>
<p>at his side, and continued his walk upon the rampart.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars had been little moved by this menacing
</p>
<p>gesture, contenting himself with tightening the reins of
</p>
<p>his horse and approaching the spurs to his sides, knowing
</p>
<p>that with a single leap of the nimble animal he should
</p>
<p>be carried behind the wall of a cabin which stood hard
</p>
<p>by, and should then be sheltered from the Spanish fusil,
</p>
<p>before the operation of the fork and match could be
</p>
<p>completed. He knew too that a tacit convention be-
</p>
<p>tween the two armies prohibited marksmen from firing

<p>assassination. The soldier who had thus prepared him-
</p>
<p>self for attacking Cinq-Mars must have been ignorant of
</p>
<p>the understanding in this respect. Young P'Effiat there-
</p>
<p>fore made no visible movement ; and when the sentinel
</p>
<p>resumed his walk upon the rampart, he again betook
</p>
<p>himself to his ride upon the turf, and presently saw five
</p>
<p>cavaliers directing their course towards him. The two
</p>
<p>first, who came on at full gallop, did not salute him, but
</p>
<p>stopping close to him, leaped to the ground ; and he
</p>
<p>found himself in the arms of the Counsellor de Thou,
</p>
<p>who embraced him tender!}', while the little Abb de
</p>
<p>Gondi, laughing with all his heart, cried,
</p>
<p>" Behold another Orestes recovering his Pylades, and
</p>
<p>at the moment of immolating a rogue who is not of the
</p>
<p>family of the king of kings, I can tell you."
</p>
<p>" What ! is it you, my dear Cinq-Mars ? " cried De
</p>
<p>Thou ; " and I knew not of your arrival in the camp !
</p>
<p>Yes, it is indeed you ; I recognize you, although indeed
</p>
<p>you are very pale. Have you been ill, my dear friend ?
</p>
<p>I have often written to you j for my boyish friendship
</p>
<p>has remained deep in my heart."
</p>
<p>" And I," answered Henri d'Effiat, " I have been very
</p>
<p>culpable towards you ; but I will relate to you all the
</p>
<p>causes of my neglect. I can speak of them, but I was
</p>
<p>ashamed to write them. But how good you are ! Your
</p>
<p>friendship has never relaxed."
</p>
<p>" I knew you too well." replied De Thou ; " I knew
</p>
<p>that there could be no coldness between us, and that my
</p>
<p>soul had its echo in yours."
</p>
<p>With these words they embraced once more, their

</p>
<p>ill one's life, but with which it seems, nevertheless, that
</p>
<p>the heart is always charged, so much ease do they give
</p>
<p>in flowing.
</p>
<p>This moment was short ; and during these few words,
</p>
<p>Gondi had been constantly pulling them by the cloak,
</p>
<p>saying,
</p>
<p>" To horse ! to horse, gentlemen ! Pardieu ! you will
</p>
<p>have time enough to embrace, if you are so affectionate ;
</p>
<p>but do not delay. Let our first thought be to have done
</p>
<p>with our good friends who are now coming. We are
</p>
<p>in a precious position, with those three gaillards there
</p>
<p>before us, the archers close by, and the Spaniards up
</p>
<p>yonder ; we shall be under three fires."
</p>
<p>He was still speaking, when De Launay, finding him-
</p>
<p>self at about sixty paces from his opponents, with his
</p>
<p>seconds, who were chosen from his own friends rather
</p>
<p>than from among the partisans of the cardinal, put his
</p>
<p>horse to a canter, advanced gracefully towards his young
</p>
<p>adversaries, and gravely saluted them.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, I think that we shall do well to select
</p>
<p>our men, and to take the field; for there is talk of
</p>
<p>attacking the lines, and I must be at my post."
</p>
<p>" We are ready, sir," said Cinq-Mars ; " and as for
</p>
<p>selecting opponents, I shall be very glad to become
</p>
<p>yours, for I have not forgotten the Mare'chal de
</p>
<p>Bassompierre and the wood of Chaumont. You
</p>
<p>know my opinion concerning your insolent visit to

<p>my mother."

<p>to Madame, your mother, I fulfilled the duties of a man

<p>of the world ; towards the mare'chal, those of a captain
</p>
<p>THE SIEGE. 151
</p>
<p>of the guard ; here, those of a gentleman towards M.
</p>
<p>1'Abbe, who has challenged me ; afterwards I will
</p>
<p>have that honor with you."
</p>
<p>" If I allow you," said the abbe", who was already on
</p>
<p>horseback.
</p>
<p>They took sixty paces of ground, all that was af-
</p>
<p>forded them by the extent of the meadow which enclosed
</p>
<p>them. The Abbe de Gondi was stationed between De
</p>
<p>Thou and his friend, who sat nearest the ramparts, upon
</p>
<p>which two Spanish officers and a score of soldiers stood,
</p>
<p>as in a balcony, to witness this combat of six persons,
</p>
<p>a spectacle common enough to them. They exhibited
</p>
<p>the same signs of joy as at their bull-fights, and laughed
</p>
<p>with that savage and bitter laugh which their physiog-
</p>
<p>nomy derives from their Arab blood.
</p>
<p>At a sign from Gondi, the six horses set off at full
</p>
<p>gallop, and met, without coming in contact, in the
</p>
<p>middle of the arena ; at that instant, six pistol-shots
</p>
<p>were heard almost together, and the smoke covered the
</p>
<p>combatants.
</p>
<p>When it dispersed, of the six cavaliers and six horses
</p>
<p>there were but three men and three animals on their
</p>
<p>legs. Cinq-Mars was on horseback, giving his hand to
</p>
<p>his adversary, as calm as himself ; at the other end of
</p>
<p>the field, De Thou stood by his opponent, whose horse
</p>
<p>he had killed, and whom he was helping to rise. As for
</p>
<p>Gondi and De Launay, neither of them was to be seen.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, looking about for them anxiously, perceived
</p>
<p>the abbess horse, which, caracoling and curvetting, was
</p>
<p>dragging after him the future cardinal, whose foot was

<p>engaged in the stirrup, and who was swearing as if he
</p>
<p>152
</p>
<p>CINQ-MARS,
</p>
<p>had never studied anything but the language of the
</p>
<p>camp. His nose and hands were bloody with his fall and
</p>
<p>with his efforts to seize the grass ; and he was regard-
</p>
<p>ing with considerable dissatisfaction his horse, which in
</p>
<p>spite of himself he irritated with his spurs, making its
</p>
<p>way to the fosse, filled with water, which surrounded
</p>
<p>the bastion, when, happily, Cinq-Mars, passing between
</p>
<p>the edge of the swamp and the animal, seized its bridle
</p>
<p>and stopped its career.
</p>
<p>" Well, my dear abbe", I see that no great harm is
</p>
<p>come to you, for you speak with decided energy."
</p>
<p>" Corbleu!" cried Gondi, wiping the dust out of his
</p>
<p>eyes, " to fire a pistol in the face of that giant I had to
</p>
<p>lean forward and rise in my stirrups, and thus I lost
</p>
<p>my balance ; but I fancy that he is down too."
</p>
<p>" You are right, sir," said De Thou, coming up ;
</p>
<p>" there is his horse swimming in the fosse with its mas-
</p>
<p>ter, whose brains are blown out. We must think now
</p>
<p>of escaping."
</p>
<p>" Escaping ! that, gentlemen, will be rather difficult,"
</p>
<p>said the adversary of Cinq-Mars, approaching. " Hark !
</p>
<p>there 's the cannon-shot, the signal for the attack ; I did
</p>
<p>not expect it would have been given so soon. If we re-
</p>
<p>turn we shall meet the Swiss and the lansquenets, who
</p>
<p>are engaged in this direction."
</p>
<p>" M. de Fontrailles says well," said De Thou ; " but
</p>
<p>if we do not return, here are these Spaniards, who are
</p>
<p>running to arms, and whose balls we shall presently
</p>
<p>have whistling about our heads."
</p>
<p>" Well, let us hold a council," said Gondi ; " summon

<p>M. de Montre'sor, who is uselessly occupied in searching

<p>THE SIEGE. 153
</p>
<p>for the body of poor De Launay. You have not wounded
</p>
<p>him, M. de Thou ? "
</p>
<p>" No, M. PAbb ; every one has not so good an aim as
</p>
<p>you," said Montre*sor, bitterly, limping from his fall.
</p>
<p>" We shall not have time to continue with the sword."
</p>
<p>" As to continuing, I will not hear of it, gentlemen,"
</p>
<p>said Fontrailles ; " M. de Cinq-Mars has behaved too
</p>
<p>nobly towards me. My pistol went off too soon, and his
</p>
<p>was at my very cheek, I feel the coldness of it now,
</p>
<p>but he had the generosity to withdraw it and fire in the
</p>
<p>air. I shall not forget it ; and I am his in life and in
</p>
<p>death."
</p>
<p>" We must think of other things now," interrupted
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars ; " a ball has just whistled past my ear. The
</p>
<p>attack has begun on all sides ; and we are surrounded
</p>
<p>by friends and enemies."
</p>
<p>In fact, the cannonade was general ; the citadel, the
</p>
<p>town, and the army were covered with smoke. The bas-
</p>
<p>tion before them was unassailed, and its guards seemed
</p>
<p>less intent on defending it than on observing the fate of
</p>
<p>the other fortifications.
</p>
<p>" I believe that the enemy has made a sally," said
</p>
<p>Montre*sor, " for the smoke has subsided in the plain,
</p>
<p>and I see masses of cavalry charging under the protec-
</p>
<p>tion of the batteries."
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen," said Cinq-Mars, who had never ceased
</p>
<p>to observe the walls, " there is a very decided part which
</p>
<p>we could take, to enter this ill-guarded bastion."
</p>
<p>" An excellent idea, sir," said Fontrailles ; " but we
</p>
<p>are but five against at least thirty, and are open to view

<p>and easily counted."
</p>
<p>154 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>*' I' faith, the notion is not a bad one," said Gondi ;
</p>
<p>" it is better to be shot up there than hanged down here,
</p>
<p>as we shall be if we are found, for De Launay must be
</p>
<p>already missed by his company, and all the court is aware
</p>
<p>of our quarrel."
</p>
<p>** Parbleu ! gentlemen," said Montrdsor, " there is help
</p>
<p>coming."
</p>
<p>A troop of horse, numerous, but greatly in disorder,
</p>
<p>advanced towards them at full gallop ; their red uniform
</p>
<p>made them visible far off. It seemed to be their inten-
</p>
<p>tion to stop upon the very ground on which were our
</p>
<p>embarrassed duellists, for scarcely had the first cavalier
</p>
<p>reached it than cries of " Halt ! " were repeated and pro-
</p>
<p>longed by the voices of the chiefs who were mingled
</p>
<p>with their cavaliers.
</p>
<p>" Let us go to them ; these are the men-at-arms of
</p>
<p>the king's guard," said Fontrailles. " I recognize them
</p>
<p>by their black cockades. I also see many of the light-
</p>
<p>horse with them; let us mingle in the disorder, for I
</p>
<p>fancy they are ramengs"
</p>
<p>This is a polite phrase signifying in military lan-
</p>
<p>guage "put to the rout." All five advanced towards
</p>
<p>the animated and noisy troops, and found that this
</p>
<p>conjecture was right. But in place of the consterna-
</p>
<p>tion which one might have expected in such a case,
</p>
<p>they found nothing but a youthful and rattling gayety,
</p>
<p>and heard nothing but shouts of laughter in the two
</p>
<p>companies.
</p>
<p>" Ah, pardieu ! Cahuzac," said one, " thy horse runs
</p>
<p>better than mine ; I suppose thou 'st exercised it in the

</p>
<p>" Ah, I see, 'twas that we might be the sooner rallied
</p>
<p>that thou got'st here first," answered the other.
</p>
<p>" I think the Marquis de Coislin must, be mad, to make
</p>
<p>four hundred of us charge eight Spanish regiments."
</p>
<p>" Ah, ah, ah ! Locmaria, your plume is in fine trim ;
</p>
<p>it looks like a weeping willow. If we follow that,, it
</p>
<p>will be to our burial."
</p>
<p>" Ah, gentlemen, I told you before," angrily replied
</p>
<p>the young officer, " I was sure that that Capuchin
</p>
<p>Joseph, who meddles in everything, was mistaken in
</p>
<p>telling us to charge, upon the part of the cardinal. But
</p>
<p>would you have been satisfied if those who have the
</p>
<p>honor of commanding you had refused to "
</p>
<p>" No, no, no ! " answered all the young men, at the
</p>
<p>same time forming themselves quickly into ranks.
</p>
<p>" I said," interposed the old Marquis de Coislin, who,
</p>
<p>with a white head, had all the fire of youth in his eyes,
</p>
<p>" that if you were commanded to mount to the assault
</p>
<p>on horseback, you would do it."
</p>
<p>" Bravo ! bravo ! " cried all the men-at-arms, clapping
</p>
<p>their hands.
</p>
<p>" Well, M. le Marquis," said Cinq-Mars, approaching,
</p>
<p>" here is an opportunity of executing what you have
</p>
<p>promised. I am merely a volunteer ; but an instant
</p>
<p>ago these gentlemen and I examined this bastion, and
</p>
<p>I believe that it is possible to take it."
</p>
<p>" Sir, in the first place, we must examine the ditch to

<p>see "
</p>
<p>At this moment a ball from the rampart of which
</p>
<p>they were speaking struck the horse of the old officer,

<p>" Locmaria, De Mouy, take the command, and to the

</p>
<p>leader dead.
</p>
<p>" Stop a moment, gentlemen," said old Coislin, rising,
</p>
<p>" I will lead you, if you please. Guide us, sir volunteer,
</p>
<p>for the Spaniards invite us to this ball, and we must
</p>
<p>reply politely."
</p>
<p>Scarcely had the old man mounted another horse,
</p>
<p>which one of his men brought him, and drawn his
</p>
<p>sword than, without awaiting his order, all these ardent
</p>
<p>youth, preceded by Cinq-Mars and his friends, whose
</p>
<p>horses were urged on by the squadrons behind, had
</p>
<p>thrown themselves into the morass, wherein, to their
</p>
<p>great astonishment and to that of the Spaniards, who
</p>
<p>counted too much upon its depth in that place, the
</p>
<p>horses were only in the water up to their hams ; and in
</p>
<p>spite of a discharge of grape-shot from the two largest
</p>
<p>pieces, all reached pell-mell a slip of ground at the foot
</p>
<p>of the half-ruined ramparts. In the ardor of the onset,
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars and Fontrailles, with the young Locmaria,
</p>
<p>forced their horses on to the rampart itself ; but a brisk
</p>
<p>fusillade killed the three animals, which rolled over
</p>
<p>their masters.
</p>
<p>" Dismount all, gentlemen ! " cried the old Coislin ;
</p>
<p>" forward with pistol and sword ! Abandon your
</p>
<p>horses ! "
</p>
<p>All obeyed instantly, and threw themselves in a
</p>
<p>crowd upon the breach.

</p>
<p>his horse fell. He placed him on his feet, restored to

<p>him his sword, which had escaped from his hand, and
</p>
<p>said to him with the greatest calmness, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the balls which rained on all sides,

</p>

</p>
<p>And, in fact, the little Gondi, pushing on among the

</p>
<p>So saying, he cut and thrust at a tall Spaniard.
</p>
<p>The defence was not long. The Castilian soldiers
</p>
<p>were no match for the French officers, and not one of
</p>
<p>them had time or courage to recharge his carbine.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, we will relate this to our mistresses in
</p>
<p>Paris," said Locmaria, throwing his hat up in the air ;
</p>
<p>and Cinq-Mars, De Thou, Coislin, De Mouy, Londigny,
</p>
<p>officers of the red companies, and all the young noble-
</p>
<p>men, with swords in their right hands and pistols in
</p>
<p>their left, dashing, jostling, and doing each other by
</p>
<p>their eagerness as much harm as they did the enemy,
</p>
<p>finally dashed upon the platform of the bastion, as
</p>
<p>water poured from a vase, of which the opening is too
</p>
<p>narrow, leaps out by intermitted torrents.
</p>
<p>Disdaining to occupy themselves with the vanquished
</p>
<p>soldiers who cast themselves at their feet, they left
</p>
<p>them to look about the fort, without even disarming

</p>
<p>boys in their holidays, laughing with all their hearts, as
</p>
<p>if it had been a party of pleasure.
</p>
<p>A Spanish officer, enveloped in his brown cloak,
</p>
<p>watched them with a sombre air.
</p>
<p>" What demons are these, Ambrosio V " said he to a
</p>
<p>soldier. " I have never met with any such before in
</p>
<p>France. If Louis XIII. has an entire army thus com-
</p>
<p>posed, it is very good of him not to conquer Europe."
</p>
<p>" Oh, I do not believe that they are very numerous ,
</p>
<p>they must be some poor adventurers, who have nothing
</p>
<p>to lose, and all to gain by pillage."
</p>
<p>" You are right," said the officer ; " I will go and try
</p>
<p>to get one of them to let me escape."
</p>
<p>And slowly approaching, he accosted a young light-
</p>
<p>horseman, of about eighteen, who was sitting apart from
</p>
<p>his comrades upon the parapet. He had the white and
</p>
<p>red complexion of a young girl ; his delicate hand held
</p>
<p>an embroidered handkerchief, with which he wiped his
</p>
<p>forehead and his golden locks. He was looking at a
</p>
<p>great round watch set with rubies and suspended from
</p>
<p>his girdle by a knot of ribbons.
</p>
<p>The astonished Spaniard paused. If he had not seen
</p>
<p>him overthrow his soldiers, he would not have believed
</p>
<p>him capable of anything beyond singing a romance,
</p>
<p>reclined upon a couch. But filled with the suggestion
</p>
<p>of Ambrosio, he thought that he might have stolen
</p>
<p>these objects of luxury in the pillage of the apartments
</p>
<p>of a woman ; so, going abruptly up to him, he said,
</p>
<p>" Hombre ! I am an officer ; will you restore me to
</p>
<p>liberty, that I may once more see my country ? "

</p>
<p>The young Frenchman looked at him with the gentle
</p>
<p>THE SIEGE. 159
</p>
<p>air of his age, and thinking of his own family, he
</p>
<p>said,
</p>
<p>" Sir, I will present you to the Marquis de Coislin,
</p>
<p>who will, I doubt not, grant your request ; is your fam-
</p>
<p>ily of Castile or of Aragon ? "
</p>
<p>" Your Coislin will ask the permission of somebody
</p>
<p>else, and will make me wait a year. I will give you
</p>
<p>four thousand ducats if you will afford me the means
</p>
<p>of escape."
</p>
<p>That gentle face, those girlish features, became in-
</p>
<p>fused with the purple of fury ; those blue eyes shot
</p>
<p>forth lightning ; and exclaiming, " Money to me ! away,
</p>
<p>fool ! " the young man gave the Spaniard a ringing box
</p>
<p>on the ear. The latter, without hesitating, drew a long
</p>
<p>poniard from his breast, and seizing the arm of the
</p>
<p>Frenchman, thought to plunge it readily into his heart ;
</p>
<p>but, nimble and vigorous, the youth took him by the
</p>
<p>right arm, and lifting it with force above his head, sent
</p>
<p>it back with the weapon it held upon the head of the
</p>
<p>Spaniard, who was furious with passion.
</p>
<p>" Eh ! eh ! Softly, Olivier ! " cried his comrades, run-
</p>
<p>ning from all directions ; " there are Spaniards enough
</p>
<p>on the ground already."
</p>
<p>And they disarmed the hostile officer.
</p>
<p>" What shall we do with this madman ? "
</p>
<p>" I should not like to have him for my valet-de-
</p>
<p>chambre" returned another^
</p>
<p>" He deserves to be hanged," said a third ; " but,
</p>
<p>i' faith, gentlemen, we don't know how to hang. Send
</p>
<p>him to that battalion of Swiss which is now passing on

<p>the plain."
</p>
<p>160 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>And that calm and sombre man, enveloping himself
</p>
<p>anew in his cloak, began his march of his own accord,
</p>
<p>followed by Ambrosio, to join the battalion, pushed by
</p>
<p>the shoulders and urged on by five or six of these young
</p>
<p>madcaps.
</p>
<p>Meantime, the first troop of the besiegers, astonished
</p>
<p>at their success, had followed it out to the end ; Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, so advised by the aged Coislin, had made with him
</p>
<p>the circuit of the bastion, and found to their vexation
</p>
<p>that it was completely separated from the city, and that
</p>
<p>they could not follow up their advantage. They there-
</p>
<p>fore returned slowly to the platform, talking by the way,
</p>
<p>to rejoin De Thou and the Abbe" de Gondi, whom they
</p>
<p>found laughing with the young light-horsemen.
</p>
<p>" We have Religion and Justice with us, gentlemen ;
</p>
<p>we could not fail to triumph."
</p>
<p>" Yes, for they struck as hard as we."
</p>
<p>There was silence at the approach of Cinq-Mars, and
</p>
<p>they remained for an instant whispering and asking his
</p>
<p>name ; then all surrounded him, and took his hand with
</p>
<p>transport.
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you are right," said their old captain;
</p>
<p>" he is, as our fathers used to say, the lest doer of the
</p>
<p>day. He is a volunteer, who is to be presented to-day
</p>
<p>to the king by the cardinal."
</p>
<p>" By the cardinal ! we will present him ourselves.
</p>
<p>Ah, don't let him be a Cardinalist ; he is too good a
</p>
<p>fellow for that!" exclaimed all the young men, with
</p>
<p>vivacity.
</p>
<p>" Sir, I will disgust you with him," said Olivier

</p>
<p>his page. Rather serve in the red companies ; come,
</p>
<p>you will have good comrades there."
</p>
<p>The old marquis saved Cinq-Mars the embarrassment
</p>
<p>of answering by causing the trumpets to sound and
</p>
<p>rally his brilliant companies. The cannon was no longer
</p>
<p>heard, and a soldier announced that the king and the
</p>
<p>cardinal were traversing the lines to examine the results
</p>
<p>of the day ; he made all the horses pass through the
</p>
<p>breach, which was tolerably wide, and ranged the two
</p>
<p>companies in battle order, upon a spot whither it seemed
</p>
<p>impossible for any but infantry to penetrate.

<p>N. LEMERCIEH, Panhypocrisiade.
</p>
<p>RICHELIEU had said within himself, " To assuage the
</p>
<p>first paroxysm of the royal grief, to open a source of
</p>
<p>emotions which shall withdraw this wavering soul from
</p>
<p>its sorrow, let this city be besieged ; I consent. Let
</p>
<p>Louis go ; I will allow him to strike a few poor soldiers
</p>
<p>with the blows which he would, but dare not, inflict on
</p>
<p>me. Let his anger quench itself in this obscure blood ;
</p>
<p>I agree. But this caprice of glory shall not derange my
</p>
<p>immutable designs ; this city shall not fall yet. It shall
</p>
<p>not be French forever until two years have past ; it shall
</p>
<p>come into my nets only on the day which I have deter-
</p>
<p>mined in my own mind. Thunder, bombs and cannons ;
</p>
<p>meditate your operations, skilful captains ; hurry on,

<p>young warriors. I will silence your noise, I will dissi-
</p>
<p>THE REWARD. 163
</p>
<p>pate your projects, and make your efforts abortive ; all
</p>
<p>shall end in empty smoke, for I will conduct in order
</p>
<p>to mislead you."
</p>
<p>Such is pretty nearly what passed in the bald head
</p>
<p>of the old cardinal before the attack of which we have
</p>
<p>witnessed a portion. He was stationed on horseback, to
</p>
<p>the north of the city, upon one of the mountains of Salces;
</p>
<p>from this point he could see the plain of Roussillon be-
</p>
<p>fore him, sloping to the Mediterranean. Perpignan, with
</p>
<p>its ramparts of brick, its bastions, its citadel, and its
</p>
<p>spire, formed upon this plain an oval and sombre mass
</p>
<p>amid broad and verdant meads ; and the vast mountains
</p>
<p>surrounded it and the valley like an enormous bow bent
</p>
<p>from north to south, while, stretching its white line in
</p>
<p>the east, the sea seemed its silver cord. On his right
</p>
<p>rose that immense mountain which is called the Canigou,
</p>
<p>whose sides send forth two rivers into the plain below.
</p>
<p>The French line extended to the foot of this western
</p>
<p>barrier. A crowd of generals and of great lords were
</p>
<p>on horseback behind the minister, but at twenty paces'
</p>
<p>distance and profoundly silent. He had at first slowly
</p>
<p>followed the line of operations, but afterwards returned
</p>
<p>and stationed himself upon this height, whence his eye
</p>
<p>and his thought hovered over the destinies of besieg-
</p>
<p>ers and besieged. The army had its eyes upon him,
</p>
<p>and could see him from every point. The whole of the
</p>
<p>troops looked upon him as their immediate chief, and
</p>
<p>awaited the direction of his gesture before they acted.
</p>
<p>For a long time France had bent beneath his yoke ; and
</p>
<p>admiration shielded all his actions from the ridicule to

</p>
<p>which another would have been often subjected. At this
</p>
<p>164 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>moment, for instance, no one thought of smiling, or of
</p>
<p>feeling surprised even, that the cuirass should clothe the
</p>
<p>priest ; and the severity of his character and aspect sup-
</p>
<p>pressed every thought of ironical comparisons or imper-
</p>
<p>tinent conjectures. This day the cardinal appeared in
</p>
<p>a costume entirely warlike : he wore a coat of a reddish-
</p>
<p>brown, embroidered with gold, a water-colored cuirass, a
</p>
<p>sword at his side, pistols at his saddle-bow, and he had
</p>
<p>a plumed hat ; but this he rarely placed upon his head,
</p>
<p>which was still covered with the red cap. Two pages
</p>
<p>were behind him; one carried his gauntlets, the other
</p>
<p>his casque, and the captain of his guards was at his
</p>
<p>side.
</p>
<p>As the king had recently named him generalissimo of
</p>
<p>his troops, it was to him that the generals sent for their
</p>
<p>orders ; but he, knowing full well the secret motives of
</p>
<p>his master's present anger, ostentatiously referred to that
</p>
<p>prince all who sought a decision from his own mouth.
</p>
<p>It happened as he had foreseen; for he regulated and
</p>
<p>calculated the movements of that heart as those of a
</p>
<p>watch, and could have told with precision through what
</p>
<p>sensations it had passed. Louis XIII. came and placed
</p>
<p>himself at his side ; but he came as a pupil, forced to
</p>
<p>acknowledge that his master is in the right. His air
</p>
<p>was haughty and dissatisfied, his language brusque and
</p>
<p>dry. The cardinal displayed no emotion. It was re-
</p>
<p>marked that the king, in consulting him, employed the
</p>
<p>words of command, thus reconciling his weakness and
</p>
<p>his power of place, his irresolution and his pride, his
</p>
<p>ignorance and his pretensions, while his minister dictated

<p>laws to him in a tone of the most profound obedience.

</p>
<p>" I will have them attack immediately, Cardinal," said
</p>
<p>the prince, on coming up ; " that is to say," added he,
</p>
<p>with an air of carelessness, " when all your preparations
</p>
<p>are made, and you have determined with our generals
</p>
<p>upon the hour."
</p>
<p>" Sire, if I might venture to express my judgment, I
</p>
<p>should be glad did your Majesty think fit to commence
</p>
<p>the attack in a quarter of an hour, for that will give
</p>
<p>time enough to advance the third line."
</p>
<p>" Yes, yes ; right, M. le Cardinal ! I think so too. I will
</p>
<p>go and give my orders myself ; I wish to do everything
</p>
<p>myself. Schomberg, Schomberg ! in a quarter of an
</p>
<p>hour let me hear the signal gun ; I will have it so."
</p>
<p>And Schomberg, proceeding to take the command of
</p>
<p>the right wing, gave the order, and the signal was made.
</p>
<p>The batteries, arranged long since by the Mare'chal de
</p>
<p>la Meilleraie, began to batter a breach, but slackly, be-
</p>
<p>cause the artillerymen felt that they had been directed to
</p>
<p>attack two impregnable points , and because with their
</p>
<p>experience, and above all with the straightforward sense
</p>
<p>and rapid perception of French soldiers, any one of them
</p>
<p>could at once have indicated the point against which
</p>
<p>the attack ought to have been directed. The king was
</p>
<p>surprised at the slowness of the firing.
</p>
<p>" La Meilleraie," said he, impatiently, " these batteries
</p>
<p>do not play ; your cannoneers are asleep."
</p>
<p>With the mare'chal the principal artillery officers
</p>
<p>were present ; but no one answered a syllable. They
</p>
<p>had looked towards the cardinal, who remained as im-
</p>
<p>movable as an equestrian statue, and they imitated his

<p>example. The answer must have been that the fault
</p>
<p>166 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>was not with the soldiers, but with him who had ordered
</p>
<p>this false disposition of the batteries ; and this was
</p>
<p>Richelieu himself, who, pretending to believe them more
</p>
<p>useful as they were, had at once stopped the remarks
</p>
<p>of the chiefs.
</p>
<p>The king was astonished at this silence, and fearing
</p>
<p>that he had committed some gross military blunder by
</p>
<p>his question, slightly blushed, and approaching the group
</p>
<p>of princes who had accompanied him, said, in order to
</p>
<p>reassure himself,
</p>
<p>" D'Angouleme, Beaufort, it is very tiresome, is it
</p>
<p>not? We stand here like mummies."
</p>
<p>Charles de Yalois drew near, and said,
</p>
<p>" It seems to me, Sire, that they are not employing
</p>
<p>here the machines of the engineer Pompe"e-Targon."
</p>
<p>" Parbleu ! " said the Due de Beaufort, fixedly regard-
</p>
<p>ing Richelieu, " that is because we had more desire to
</p>
<p>take Rochelle than Perpignan at the time that Italian
</p>
<p>came. Here we have not an engine ready, not a mine,
</p>
<p>not a petard beneath these walls ; and the Marechal de
</p>
<p>la Meilleraie told me this morning that he had proposed
</p>
<p>to bring up some to open the breach with. It was
</p>
<p>neither the Castillet, nor the six great bastions which
</p>
<p>surround it, nor the half-moon, we ought to have
</p>
<p>attacked. If we go on in this way, the great stone
</p>
<p>arm of the citadel will show us its fist long enough
</p>
<p>yet."
</p>
<p>The cardinal, still motionless, said not a single word ;
</p>
<p>he only beckoned to him Fabert, who left the group in
</p>
<p>attendance, and ranged his horse behind that of the car-

</p>
<p>The Due de la Rochefoucauld, drawing near the king,
</p>
<p>said,
</p>
<p>" I believe, Sire, that our inactivity makes the enemy
</p>
<p>insolent, for see, here 's a numerous sally, directing it-
</p>
<p>self right towards your Majesty ; the regiments of Biron
</p>
<p>and De Fonts fall back after firing."
</p>
<p>" Well ! " said the king, drawing his sword, " let us
</p>
<p>charge, and force those vagabonds back again. Set
</p>
<p>on the cavalry with me, D'Angouleme. Where is it,
</p>
<p>Cardinal?"
</p>
<p>" Behind that hill, Sire, there are in column six regi-
</p>
<p>ments of dragoons, and the carabineers of La Roque ;
</p>
<p>below you are my men-at-arms and my light-horse,
</p>
<p>whom I pray your Majesty to employ, for those of your
</p>
<p>Majesty's guard are ill guided by the Marquis de Coislin,
</p>
<p>ever too zealous. Joseph, go tell him to return."
</p>
<p>He whispered to the Capuchin, who had accompanied
</p>
<p>him, huddled up in a military dress which he wore awk-
</p>
<p>wardly, and who immediately advanced into the plain.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, the compact columns of the old
</p>
<p>Spanish infantry issued from the gate of Notre-Dame
</p>
<p>like a dark and moving forest, while from another gate
</p>
<p>came forth the heavy cavalry, which drew up upon the
</p>
<p>plain. The French army, in battle-array at the foot of
</p>
<p>the hill where the king stood, behind fortifications of
</p>
<p>earth, behind redoubts and fascines of turf, perceived
</p>
<p>with alarm the men-at-arms and the light-horse pressed
</p>
<p>between these two forces, ten times their superiors in
</p>
<p>numbers.
</p>
<p>" Sound the charge ! " cried Louis XIII. ; " or my old

<p>Coislin is lost."
</p>
<p>168 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>And he descended the hill, with all his suite as ardent
</p>
<p>as himself ; but before he was on the plain and at the
</p>
<p>head of his musketeers, the two companies had taken
</p>
<p>their course, dashing off with the rapidity of lightning,
</p>
<p>and to the cry of " Vive le roi ! " fell upon the long
</p>
<p>column of the enemy's cavalry like two vultures upon
</p>
<p>the sides of a serpent ; and making a large and bloody
</p>
<p>gap, they passed beyond, and rallied behind the Spanish
</p>
<p>bastion, as we have seen, leaving the enemy's cavalry
</p>
<p>so astonished that they thought only of re-forming them-
</p>
<p>selves, and not of pursuing.
</p>
<p>The French army sent forth one shout of applause ;
</p>
<p>the king paused in amazement. He looked around him,
</p>
<p>and saw a burning desire for attack in all eyes ; the
</p>
<p>valor of his race shone in his own. He paused yet an-
</p>
<p>other instant in suspense, listening with intoxication to
</p>
<p>the roar of the cannon, respiring and snuffing up the
</p>
<p>odor of the powder ; he seemed to receive another life,
</p>
<p>and to become once more a Bourbon. All who looked
</p>
<p>on him felt as though they were commanded by another
</p>
<p>man, when, raising his sword and his eyes towards the
</p>
<p>sun, he cried,
</p>
<p>" Follow me, brave friends ! here I am King of
</p>
<p>France ! "
</p>
<p>His cavalry, deploying, dashed off with an ardor which
</p>
<p>devoured space, and raising billows of dust from the
</p>
<p>ground, which trembled beneath them, they were in an
</p>
<p>instant mingled with the Spanish cavalry, and both were
</p>
<p>swallowed up in an immense and fluctuating cloud.

<p>from their useless position ! Fabert, give your orders ;
</p>
<p>let them be all directed upon the infantry which slowly
</p>
<p>approaches to surround the king. Haste, save the
</p>
<p>king!"
</p>
<p>Immediately the cardinal's suite, hitherto sitting erect
</p>
<p>as so many statues, were in motion. The generals gave
</p>
<p>their orders ; the aides-de-camp galloped off into the
</p>
<p>plain, where, leaping over the ditches, barriers, and pali-
</p>
<p>sades, they arrived at their destination almost as rapidly
</p>
<p>as the thoughts that directed them and the glances that
</p>
<p>followed them.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the few and interrupted flashes which had
</p>
<p>shone from the before discouraged batteries became a
</p>
<p>continual and immense flame, leaving no room for the
</p>
<p>smoke, which rose to the sky in an infinite number of
</p>
<p>light and floating wreaths ; the volleys of cannon, which
</p>
<p>seemed of late like far and feeble echoes, changed into
</p>
<p>a formidable thunder whose roll was as unintermitted
</p>
<p>as that of drums beating the charge ; while from three
</p>
<p>opposite points large red flashes from fiery mouths fell
</p>
<p>upon the dark columns which issued from the besieged
</p>
<p>city.
</p>
<p>Meantime, without changing his position, but with
</p>
<p>ardent eyes and imperative gestures, Richelieu ceased
</p>
<p>not to multiply his orders, casting upon those who re-
</p>
<p>ceived them a look which implied a sentence of death if
</p>
<p>he was not at once obeyed.
</p>
<p>" The king has overthrown the cavalry ; but the foot

</p>
<p>guiores ! Take the enemy's columns in flank. Order
</p>
<p>the rest of the army to cease from the attack, and to
</p>
<p>remain motionless throughout the whole line. Some
</p>
<p>paper! I will write myself to Schomberg."
</p>
<p>A page alighted and advanced, holding a pencil and
</p>
<p>paper. The minister, supported by four men of his
</p>
<p>suite, also alighted with difficulty, sending forth a cry,
</p>
<p>wrested from him by pain; but he quelled it by an ef-
</p>
<p>fort, and seated himself upon the carriage of a cannon.
</p>
<p>The page presented his shoulder as a desk ; and the car-
</p>
<p>dinal hastily penned that order which contemporary
</p>
<p>manuscripts have transmitted to us, and which might
</p>
<p>well be imitated by the diplomatists of our day, who are,
</p>
<p>it would seem, more anxious to maintain themselves in
</p>
<p>perfect balance between two ideas than to wield those
</p>
<p>combinations which decide the destinies of the world,
</p>
<p>regarding the clear and obvious dictates of true genius
</p>
<p>as beneath their profound subtlety.
</p>
<p>" M. le Marechal, do not risk anything, and think well be-
</p>
<p>fore you attack. When you are thus told that the king
</p>
<p>desires you not to risk anything, you are not to understand
</p>
<p>that his Majestj" forbids you to fight at all ; but his inten-
</p>
<p>tion is that you do not engage in a general battle unless it
</p>
<p>be with a notable hope of gain from the advantage which a
</p>
<p>favorable situation may present, the responsibility of the
</p>
<p>battle naturally falling upon you."
</p>
<p>These orders given, the old minister, still seated upon
</p>
<p>the carriage of the gun, his arms resting upon the touch-
</p>
<p>hole, and his chin upon his arms, in the attitude of one
</p>
<p>who adjusts and points a cannon, continued in silence

</p>
<p>to watch the battle, like an old wolf, which, sated with
</p>
<p>THE REWARD. 171
</p>
<p>victims and torpid with age, contemplates in the plain
</p>
<p>the ravages of a lion among a herd of cattle, which he
</p>
<p>dares not himself attack. From time to time his eye
</p>
<p>glares ; the smell of blood rejoices him ; and, full of the
</p>
<p>recollection of past feasts, he passes his burning tongue
</p>
<p>over his toothless jaw.
</p>
<p>Upon that day, it was remarked by his servants or
</p>
<p>in other words, by all around him that from the time
</p>
<p>of his rising till night he took no nourishment, and so
</p>
<p>fixed all the application of his soul upon the events
</p>
<p>which he had to conduct that he triumphed over his
</p>
<p>physical pains, seeming in forgetting to have destroyed
</p>
<p>them. It was this power of attention, this constant
</p>
<p>presence of mind, that raised him almost to genius. He
</p>
<p>would have attained it quite, had he not wanted native
</p>
<p>elevation of soul and generous sensibility of heart.
</p>
<p>Everything passed upon the field of battle as he had
</p>
<p>planned, fortune attending him alike there and in the
</p>
<p>cabinet. Louis XIII. appropriated with -eager hand the
</p>
<p>victory which his minister had procured for him ; he
</p>
<p>had contributed personally, however, only that grandeur
</p>
<p>which consists in personal valor.
</p>
<p>The cannon had ceased to roar when the broken
</p>
<p>columns of infantry fell back into Perpignan.; the
</p>
<p>Spanish cavalry, greatly cut up, was already within
</p>
<p>the walls, and no living man was to be seen on the
</p>
<p>plain, save the glittering squadrons of the king, who
</p>
<p>followed him, forming their ranks as they went.
</p>
<p>He returned at -a walking pace, and contemplated
</p>
<p>with satisfaction the battle-field swept clear of enemies ;

</p>
<p>he passed haughtily under the very fire of the Spanish
</p>
<p>172 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>pieces, which, whether from unskilfulness, or by a secret
</p>
<p>agreement with the prime minister, or from very shame
</p>
<p>to kill a king of France, only sent after him a few balls,
</p>
<p>which, passing two feet above his head, fell in front
</p>
<p>of the lines, and merely served to increase the royal
</p>
<p>reputation for courage.
</p>
<p>At every step, however, that he made towards the
</p>
<p>place where Richelieu awaited him, his countenance
</p>
<p>changed and visibly fell ; he lost all the flush of combat ;
</p>
<p>the noble sweat of triumph died upon his brow. In
</p>
<p>proportion as he approached, his accustomed paleness
</p>
<p>returned to his face, as if having the right to sit alone
</p>
<p>on a royal head ; his look lost its transient fire, and
</p>
<p>at last, when he joined him, a profound melancholy
</p>
<p>entirely possessed him. He found the cardinal as he
</p>
<p>had left him, on horseback ; the latter, still coldly re-
</p>
<p>spectful, bowed, and after a few words of compliment,
</p>
<p>placed himself near Louis to traverse the lines and
</p>
<p>examine the results of the day, while the princes and
</p>
<p>great lords, riding at some distance before and behind,
</p>
<p>formed, as it were, a crowd around them.
</p>
<p>The skilful minister was careful not to say a word or
</p>
<p>make a gesture that could suggest the idea that he had
</p>
<p>the slightest share in the events of the day ; and it was
</p>
<p>remarkable that of all those who came up to give in
</p>
<p>their reports, each seemed to divine his thoughts, to be
</p>
<p>careful not to compromise his occult power by open
</p>
<p>obedience. Every report was made to the king. The
</p>
<p>cardinal then traversed, by the side of the prince, the
</p>
<p>right of the camp, which had not been under his view

<p>from the height where he had placed himself; and he
</p>
<p>THE REWARD. 173
</p>
<p>saw with satisfaction that Schomberg, who knew him
</p>
<p>well, had acted precisely as he had directed, bringing
</p>
<p>into action only a few of the light troops, and fighting
</p>
<p>just enough not to incur reproach for inaction, and
</p>
<p>not enough to obtain any distinct result. This line
</p>
<p>of conduct delighted the minister, and in no way dis-
</p>
<p>pleased the king, whose vanity cherished the idea of
</p>
<p>having been the sole conqueror that day. He even
</p>
<p>wished to persuade himself, and to have it supposed,
</p>
<p>that all the efforts of Schomberg had been ineffectual,
</p>
<p>telling him that he was not angry with him, that he
</p>
<p>had himself just had proof that the enemy before him
</p>
<p>was less despicable than had been supposed.
</p>
<p>" To show you that you have lost nothing in our esti-
</p>
<p>mation," he added, "we name you a knight of our order,
</p>
<p>and we give you public and private access to our person."
</p>
<p>The cardinal affectionately pressed his hand as he
</p>
<p>passed him, and the mare'chal, astonished at this deluge
</p>
<p>of favors, followed the prince with his head down, like
</p>
<p>a culprit, recalling, to console himself, all the brilliant
</p>
<p>actions of his career which had remained unnoticed,
</p>
<p>and mentally attributing to them these unmerited re-
</p>
<p>wards, as a salvo to his conscience.
</p>
<p>The king was about to retrace his steps, when the
</p>
<p>Due de Beaufort, with an amazed air, exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" But, Sire, have I still the powder in my eyes, or
</p>
<p>have I been struck mad with the sun? It appears to
</p>
<p>me that I see upon yonder bastion cavaliers in a red
</p>
<p>uniform who monstrously resemble your light-horse
</p>
<p>whom we thought to be killed."

<p>The cardinal knitted his brows.
</p>
<p>174 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Impossible, Monsieur," he said ; " the imprudence of
</p>
<p>M. de Coislin has destroyed his Majesty's men-at-arms
</p>
<p>and those cavaliers. It is for that reason I ventured
</p>
<p>just now to say to the king that if the useless corps
</p>
<p>were suppressed, it might be very advantageous in a
</p>
<p>military point of view."
</p>
<p>" Pardieu! your Eminence will pardon me," answered
</p>
<p>the Due de Beaufort ; " but I do not deceive myself, and
</p>
<p>there are seven or eight of them driving prisoners be-
</p>
<p>fore them."
</p>
<p>" Well ! let us go to the point," said the king ; " I
</p>
<p>shall be very glad to find my old Coislin there."
</p>
<p>It was with great caution that the horses of the king
</p>
<p>and his suite passed across the marsh, and with infinite
</p>
<p>astonishment that their riders saw on the ramparts the
</p>
<p>two red companies in battalia as on parade.
</p>
<p>" Vive Dieu ! " cried Louis ; " I don't think there's
</p>
<p>one of them missing. Well, -Marquis, you keep your
</p>
<p>word, you take walls on horseback."
</p>
<p>" The place taken was well selected," said Richelieu,
</p>
<p>contemptuously ; " it in no way advances the taking of
</p>
<p>Perpignan, and must have cost many lives."
</p>
<p>" I' faith, there you are right," said the king, for the
</p>
<p>first time since the intelligence of the queen's death
</p>
<p>addressing the cardinal without coldness or asperity ;
</p>
<p>" I regret the blood which must have been spilled
</p>
<p>here."
</p>
<p>" There have only been two of our young people
</p>
<p>wounded in the attack, Sire," said old Coislin ; " and
</p>
<p>we have gained new companions in arms, in the volun-

</p>
<p>THE REWARD. 175
</p>
<p>" Who are they ? " said the prince.
</p>
<p>"Three of them have modestly retired, Sire ; but the
</p>
<p>youngest, whom you see, was the firs't who. proposed the
</p>
<p>assault, and the first to venture his body in making it.
</p>
<p>The two companies claim the honor of presenting him
</p>
<p>to your Majesty."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, who was on horseback behind the old
</p>
<p>captain, took off his hat and showed his pale face, his
</p>
<p>large dark eyes, and his long chestnut hair.
</p>
<p>" Those features remind me of some one," said the
</p>
<p>king ; " what say you, Cardinal ? "
</p>
<p>The latter, who had already cast a penetrating glance
</p>
<p>at the new-comer, replied,
</p>
<p>" Unless I am mistaken, this young man is "
</p>
<p>. " Henri d'Effiat," said the volunteer, bowing.
</p>
<p>" Sire, it is the same whom I had announced to your
</p>
<p>Majesty, and who was to have been presented to you
</p>
<p>by me ; the second son of the mare'chal."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " said Louis, warmly, " I am glad to see the
</p>
<p>son of my old friend presented by this bastion. 'T is a
</p>
<p>suitable introduction, my boy, for one bearing your
</p>
<p>name. You will follow us to the camp, where we have
</p>
<p>much to say to you. But what ! you here, M. de Thou ?
</p>
<p>Whom came you to judge ? "
</p>
<p>" Sire," answered Coislin, " he has condemned to
</p>
<p>death, without judging, sundry Spaniards, for he was
</p>
<p>the second to enter the place."
</p>
<p>" I struck no one, sir," interrupted De Thou, red-
</p>
<p>dening ; " 't is not my business. Herein I have no
</p>
<p>merit; I merely accompanied my friend, M. de Cinq-

</p>
<p>176 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" We love your modesty alike with your bravery, and
</p>
<p>we will not forget this. Cardinal, is there not some
</p>
<p>presidency vacant ? "
</p>
<p>Richelieu did not like De Thou. And as the source
</p>
<p>of his dislike was always mysterious, it was difficult to
</p>
<p>guess the cause of this animosity ; it revealed itself in a
</p>
<p>heartless expression that escaped him. The motive
</p>
<p>was a passage in the history of the President De
</p>
<p>Thou, the father of the young man now in ques-
</p>
<p>tion, wherein he stigmatized in the eyes of posterity
</p>
<p>a grand-uncle of the cardinal, an apostate monk, sul-
</p>
<p>lied with every human vice.
</p>
<p>Richelieu, bending his head to the ear of Joseph,
</p>
<p>whispered,
</p>
<p>" You see that man ; his father put my name into his
</p>
<p>history. Well, I will put his into mine." And, truly
</p>
<p>enough, he subsequently wrote it in blood. At this
</p>
<p>moment, to avoid answering the king, he feigned not
</p>
<p>to have heard his question, and to be wholly intent upon
</p>
<p>the merit of Cinq-Mars and the desire to see him well
</p>
<p>placed at court.
</p>
<p>" I promised you beforehand to make him a captain
</p>
<p>in my guards," said the prince ; " let him be nominated
</p>
<p>to-morrow. I would know more of him, and raise him
</p>
<p>to a higher fortune, if he pleases me. Let us now
</p>
<p>retire ; the sun has set, and we are far from our army.
</p>
<p>Tell my two good companies to follow us."
</p>
<p>The minister, after repeating the order, omitting the
</p>
<p>implied praise, placed himself on the king's right hand,
</p>
<p>and the whole escort quitted the bastion, now confided

</p>
<p>The two red companies slowly defiled through the
</p>
<p>breach which they had effected with such promptitude ;
</p>
<p>their countenances were grave and silent.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars went up to his friend.
</p>
<p>" These are heroes but ill recompensed," said he ;
</p>
<p>" not a favor, not a compliment."
</p>
<p>" I, on the other hand," said the simple De Thou,
</p>
<p>"I, who came somewhat against my will, receive one.
</p>
<p>Such are courts, such is life ; but the true Judge is on
</p>
<p>high, whom men cannot blind."
</p>
<p>"This will not prevent us from meeting death to-
</p>
<p>morrow, if necessary," said the young Olivier, laughing.

<p>THE MISTAKES.
</p>
<p>Quand vint le tour de saint Guilin,
</p>
<p>II jeta trois des sur la table.
</p>
<p>Ensuite il regarda le diable,
</p>
<p>Et lui dit d'un air tres-malin :

<p>Jouons doiic cette vieille femme !

<p>Qui de nous deux aura son ame !
</p>
<p>Ancienne Leqende.
</p>
<p>IN order to appear before the king, Cinq-Mars had been
</p>
<p>fain to mount the charger of one of the light-horse,
</p>
<p>wounded in the affair, having lost his own at the foot
</p>
<p>of the rampart. As the two companies were marching
</p>
<p>out, he felt some one touch his shoulder, and turning
</p>
<p>round, saw old Grandchamp holding a very beautiful
</p>
<p>gray horse.
</p>
<p>"Will M. le Marquis mount a horse of his own?"
</p>
<p>said he. " I have put on the saddle and housings of
</p>
<p>velvet embroidered in gold that remained in the trench.

</p>
<p>their own ; and then, as the proverb says, ' What falls
</p>
<p>in the ditch is for the soldier.' They might also have
</p>
<p>taken the four hundred gold crowns that M. le Marquis,
</p>
<p>be it said without reproach, forgot to take out of the
</p>
<p>holsters. And the pistols ! Oh, what pistols ! I bought
</p>
<p>them in Germany ; and here they are as good, and with
</p>
<p>the locks as perfect as ever. It was quite enough to kill
</p>
<p>the poor little black horse, that was born in England
</p>
<p>as sure as I was at Tours in Touraine, without also
</p>
<p>exposing these valuables to pass into the hands of the
</p>
<p>enemy."
</p>
<p>While making his lamentation, the worthy man fin-
</p>
<p>ished saddling the gray horse. The column was long
</p>
<p>enough filing out to give him time to pay a scrupulous
</p>
<p>attention to the length of the stirrups and of the bands,
</p>
<p>all the while continuing his harangue.
</p>
<p>" I beg your pardon, sir, for being somewhat long
</p>
<p>about this ; but I slightly sprained my arm in getting
</p>
<p>up M. de Thou, who himself raised M. le Marquis during
</p>
<p>the grand scuffle."
</p>
<p>" How earnest thou there at all, blockhead ? " said
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars. " 'T is not thy trade. I told thee to remain
</p>
<p>in the camp."
</p>
<p>" Oh, as to remaining in the camp, that is out of the
</p>
<p>question. I can't keep there ; when I hear a musket-
</p>
<p>shot, I should be ill if I did not see the flash. As for
</p>
<p>my trade, my trade is to take care of your horses, and
</p>
<p>you are on them. Sir, think you I should not have
</p>
<p>saved the life of the poor black if I could ? Ah, how I

</p>
<p>did ! He would never take his corn but from his dear
</p>
<p>Grandchamp ; and then he would caress me with his
</p>
<p>head. The end of my left ear that he carried away one
</p>
<p>day, poor fellow, proves it, for it was not out of ill-will
</p>
<p>he bit it off, quite the contrary. You should have heard
</p>
<p>how he neighed with rage when any one else came near
</p>
<p>him ; that was why he broke Jean's leg. Good creature,
</p>
<p>I loved him so! When he fell. I held him on one side

<p>with one hand and M. de Locmaria with the other. 1
</p>
<p>thought at first that both he and that gentleman would
</p>
<p>recover ; but unhappily only one of them returned to
</p>
<p>life, and this was he whom I least knew. You seem to
</p>
<p>be laughing at what I say about your horse, sir; you
</p>
<p>forget that in times of war the horse is the soul of the
</p>
<p>cavalier. Yes, sir, his soul ; for what is it that intimi-
</p>
<p>dates the infantry ? 'T is the horse ! It certainly is not
</p>
<p>the man, who, once seated, is little more than a bundle
</p>
<p>of hay. Who is it that performs the fine deeds that
</p>
<p>men admire ? The horse. There are times when his
</p>
<p>master, who but just before would fain have been far
</p>
<p>away, finds himself victorious and rewarded for his
</p>
<p>horse's valor, while the poor beast gets nothing but
</p>
<p>blows. Who is it gains the prize in the race ? The
</p>
<p>horse, that scarcely sups better than usual, while the
</p>
<p>master pockets the gold, and is envied by his friends
</p>
<p>and admired by all the lords as though he had run him-
</p>
<p>self. Who is ft that hunts the roebuck, yet puts but a
</p>
<p>morsel in his own mouth ? Again, the horse ; sometimes
</p>
<p>the horse is even eaten himself, poor animal ! I remem-

<p>" Bind up my leg with something, a handkerchief, a
</p>
<p>strap, or what thou wilt. I feel a burning pain there ; I
</p>
<p>know not what."
</p>
<p>" Your boot is cut, sir. It may be some ball ; however,
</p>
<p>lead is the friend of man"
</p>
<p>" It is no friend of mine, at all events."
</p>
<p>"Ah, tvho loves, chastens! Oh, lead, lead must not be
</p>
<p>ill spoken of ! What is that
</p>
<p>While occupied in binding his master's leg below the
</p>
<p>knee, the worthy Grandchamp was about to hold forth
</p>
<p>in praise of lead as absurdly as he had done in praise
</p>
<p>of the horse, when he was fain, in common with Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, to lend an ear to a warm and clamorous dispute
</p>
<p>among some Swiss soldiers who had remained behind
</p>
<p>the other troops. They were talking with much gestic-
</p>
<p>ulation, and seemed busied with two men who were
</p>
<p>in the midst of about thirty soldiers.
</p>
<p>D'Effiat, still holding out his leg to his servant, and
</p>
<p>leaning on the saddle of his horse, tried, by listening
</p>
<p>attentively, to learn the subject of the controversy ; but
</p>
<p>he knew nothing of German, and could not comprehend
</p>
<p>the dispute. Grandchamp, who, still holding the boot,
</p>
<p>had also been listening very seriously, suddenly burst
</p>
<p>into loud laughter.
</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha! sir, here are two sergeants disputing
</p>
<p>which they ought to hang of the two Spaniards there ;
</p>
<p>for your red comrades did not take the trouble to tell
</p>
<p>them. One of the Swiss says that it 's the officer, the
</p>
<p>other that it's the soldier; a third has just made a
</p>
<p>proposition for meeting the difficulty."

<p>" And what says he ? "
</p>
<p>182 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" He suggests 'the hanging them both."
</p>
<p>" Stop ! stop ! " cried Cinq-Mars to the soldiers, at-
</p>
<p>tempting to walk ; but his leg would not support him.
</p>
<p>" Put me on my horse, Grandchamp."
</p>
<p>" You forget, sir, your wound."
</p>
<p>" Do as I bid thee, and then mount thyself."
</p>
<p>The old servant grumblingly obeyed, and then gal-
</p>
<p>loped off, in fulfilment of another imperative order, to
</p>
<p>stop the Swiss, who were on the point of hanging their
</p>
<p>two prisoners to a tree, or rather of letting them hang
</p>
<p>themselves ; for the officer, with the sang-froid of his
</p>
<p>nation, had himself passed the running noose of a rope
</p>
<p>round his own neck, and without being told, had as-
</p>
<p>cended a small ladder placed against the tree, in order
</p>
<p>to tie the other end of the rope to one of its branches.
</p>
<p>The soldier, with the same indifferent tranquillity, was
</p>
<p>looking on at the Swiss disputing around him, while
</p>
<p>holding the ladder.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars arrived in time to save them, gave his
</p>
<p>name to the Swiss sergeant, and employing Grandchamp
</p>
<p>as interpreter, said that the two prisoners were his, and
</p>
<p>that he would take them to his tent; that he was a
</p>
<p>captain in the guards, and would be responsible for
</p>
<p>them. The Germans, ever exact in discipline, made no
</p>
<p>reply ; the only resistance was on the part of the pris-
</p>
<p>oner. The officer, still on the top of the ladder, turned
</p>
<p>round, and speaking thence as from a pulpit, said with a
</p>
<p>sardonic laugh,-
</p>
<p>" I should much like to know what you do here ?
</p>
<p>Who told you I wanted to live ? "

<p>" I don't want to know anything about that," said

</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars ; " it matters not to me what becomes of
</p>
<p>you afterwards. All I propose now is to prevent an
</p>
<p>act which seenis to me unjust and cruel. You are quite
</p>
<p>welcome to kill yourself afterwards, if you like."
</p>
<p>" Well said," returned the ferocious Spaniard ; " you
</p>
<p>please me. I thought at first you meant to affect the
</p>
<p>generous in order to oblige me to be grateful, which is
</p>
<p>what I detest. Well, I consent to come down ; but I
</p>
<p>shall hate you as much as ever, for you are a French-
</p>
<p>man. Nor do I thank you, for you only discharge a debt
</p>
<p>you owe me, since it was I who this morning kept you
</p>
<p>from being shot by this young soldier while he was
</p>
<p>taking aim at you ; and he 's a man who never missed
</p>
<p>a chamois in the mountains of Leon."
</p>
<p>" Be it as you will," said Cinq-Mars ; " come down."
</p>
<p>It was his character ever to assume with others the
</p>
<p>mien they wore towards him ; and the savage ferocity
</p>
<p>of the Spaniard made him hard as iron towards him.
</p>
<p>" A singularly pleasant person, that, sir," said Grand-
</p>
<p>champ ; " in your place M. le Mardchal would certainly
</p>
<p>have left him on his ladder. Come, Louis, Etienne,
</p>
<p>Germain, escort Monsieur's prisoners, a fine acquisi-
</p>
<p>tion, truly ! if you don't regret it one of these days, I
</p>
<p>shall be very much surprised."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, suffering from the motion of his horse,
</p>
<p>rode only at the pace of his prisoners on foot, and was
</p>
<p>accordingly at a distance behind the red companies, who
</p>
<p>followed close upon the king. He meditated on his way
</p>
<p>what it could be that the prince desired to say to him.
</p>
<p>A ray of hope presented to his mind's eye the figure of

</p>
<p>Marie de Mantua in the distance ; and for a moment his
</p>
<p>184 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>thoughts were tranquil. But all his future lay in that
</p>
<p>brief sentence, " please the king ; " and he began to
</p>
<p>reflect upon all the bitterness in which this task might
</p>
<p>involve him.
</p>
<p>Ere long he saw approaching his friend, De Thou,
</p>
<p>who, anxious at his remaining behind, had sought him
</p>
<p>in the plain, eager to aid him if necessary.
</p>
<p>" 'T is late, my friend ; night approaches. You have
</p>
<p>been long on your way ; I feared for you. Whom bring
</p>
<p>you here ? What has detained you ? The king will
</p>
<p>soon be asking for you."
</p>
<p>Such were the rapid inquiries of the young counsellor,
</p>
<p>whose anxiety, more potent herein than the battle itself,
</p>
<p>had made quit his accustomed serenity.
</p>
<p>" I was slightly wounded ; I bring a prisoner, and I
</p>
<p>was thinking of the king. What can he want me for,
</p>
<p>my friend ? What must I do if he proposes to place me
</p>
<p>about his person ? I must please him ; and at this
</p>
<p>thought shall I own it ? I am tempted to fly. But I
</p>
<p>trust that I shall not have that fatal honor. ' To please,'
</p>
<p>how humiliating the word ! ' to obey,' how much more
</p>
<p>endurable ! A soldier runs the chance of death, and
</p>
<p>there 's an end. But what base compliances, what sac-
</p>
<p>rifices of himself, what compositions with his conscience,
</p>
<p>what degradation of his own thought, may not a courtier
</p>
<p>be involved in ! Ah, De Thou, my dear De Thou ! I
</p>
<p>am not made for the court ; I feel it, though I have seen
</p>
<p>it but for a moment. There is in my temperament
</p>
<p>a certain, so to speak, savageness, which education has
</p>
<p>only polished on the surface. At a distance, I thought

<p>myself adapted to live in this all-powerful world ; I even

</p>
<p>desired it, led by a cherished hope of my heart. But I
</p>
<p>shuddered at the first step; I shuddered at the mere
</p>
<p>aspect of the cardinal. The recollection of the last of his
</p>
<p>crimes, at which I was present, kept me from addressing
</p>
<p>him. He horrified me ; I never can speak to him. The
</p>
<p>king's favor, too, has that about it which dismays me,
</p>
<p>as though I knew it would be fatal to me."
</p>
<p>" I am glad to perceive this apprehension in you ; it
</p>
<p>may be most salutary," said De Thou, as they rode on.
</p>
<p>" You are about to enter into contact with power. Be-
</p>
<p>fore, you did not even conceive it ; now you will touch
</p>
<p>it with your very hand. You will see what it is, and
</p>
<p>what it is hurls the lightning. Heaven grant that light-
</p>
<p>ning may never strike you ! You will probably be
</p>
<p>present in those councils which regulate the destiny of
</p>
<p>nations ; you will see, you will perchance originate, those
</p>
<p>caprices whence are born sanguinary wars, conquests,
</p>
<p>and treaties ; you will hold in your hand the drop of
</p>
<p>water that proves the source of mighty torrents. It is
</p>
<p>from the high places of the world that men justly view
</p>
<p>human affairs ; you must look from the mountain-top
</p>
<p>ere you can appreciate the littleness of those things
</p>
<p>which from below appear to us great."
</p>
<p>" Ay, if I were on those heights, I should at least have
</p>
<p>the lesson you speak of ; but this cardinal, this man to
</p>
<p>whom I must be under an obligation, this man whom I
</p>
<p>know too well by his works, what will he be to me ? "
</p>
<p>" A friend, a protector, no doubt," answered De Thou.
</p>
<p>" Death were a thousand times preferable to his friend-
</p>
<p>ship ! I hate his whole being, his very name ; he spills

<p>the blood of men with the cross of the Redeemer."
</p>
<p>186 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" What horrors are you saying, my friend ? You will
</p>
<p>ruin yourself if you exhibit your sentiments respecting
</p>
<p>the cardinal to the king."
</p>
<p>" Never mind ; in the midst of these tortuous ways, I
</p>
<p>desire to take a new one, the right line. My whole opin-
</p>
<p>ion, the opinion of a just man, shall be unveiled to the
</p>
<p>king himself, if he interrogate me, even should it cost
</p>
<p>me my head. I have at last seen this king, who has
</p>
<p>been described as so weak to me ; I have seen him, and
</p>
<p>his aspect has touched me to the heart in spite of my-
</p>
<p>self. Certainly, he is very unfortunate, but he cannot
</p>
<p>be cruel ; he will listen to the truth."
</p>
<p>" Yes ; but he will not dare to make it triumph," an-
</p>
<p>swered the sage De Thou. " Beware of this warmth of
</p>
<p>heart, which often draws you by sudden and dangerous
</p>
<p>movements. Do not attack a colossus like Richelieu
</p>
<p>without having measured him."
</p>
<p>" That is just like my tutor, the Abb Quillet. My
</p>
<p>dear and prudent friend, neither one nor the other of
</p>
<p>you know me ; you do not know how weary I am of my-
</p>
<p>self, and whither I have cast my gaze. I must mount
</p>
<p>or die."
</p>
<p>" What ! already ambitious ? " exclaimed De Thou,
</p>
<p>with an extreme surprise.
</p>
<p>His friend inclined his head upon his hands,
</p>
<p>abandoning the reins of his horse, and did not
</p>
<p>answer.
</p>
<p>" What ! has this selfish passion of a riper age ob-
</p>
<p>tained possession of you at twenty, Henri ? Ambition
</p>
<p>is the most sorrowful of hopes."

<p>" And nevertheless, it possesses me entirely at pres-

<p>THE MISTAKES. 187
</p>
<p>ent, for I see but by it, and by it my whole heart is
</p>
<p>penetrated."
</p>
<p>"Ah, Cinq-Mars, I no longer recognize you! how
</p>
<p>different you were formerly ! I do not conceal from you
</p>
<p>that you appear to me to have much deteriorated. In
</p>
<p>those walks of our childhood, when the life, and, above
</p>
<p>all, the death of Socrates, caused tears of admiration
</p>
<p>and envy to run from our eyes ; when, raising ourselves
</p>
<p>to the ideal of the highest virtue, we wished that those
</p>
<p>illustrious sorrows, those sublime misfortunes, which
</p>
<p>create great men, might in the future come upon us;
</p>
<p>when we constructed for ourselves imaginary occasions
</p>
<p>of sacrifices and devotion, if the voice of a man had
</p>
<p>pronounced, between us two, the* single word, ' ambi-
</p>
<p>tion,' we should have believed that we were touching a
</p>
<p>serpent."
</p>
<p>De Thou spoke with the heat of enthusiasm and of
</p>
<p>reproach. Cinq-Mars went on without answering, and
</p>
<p>with his face in his hands. After an instant of silence
</p>
<p>he removed them, and allowed his eyes to be seen, full
</p>
<p>of generous tears. He strongly pressed the hand of his
</p>
<p>friend, and said to him with a penetrating accent,
</p>
<p>" M. de Thou, you have recalled to me the most beau-
</p>
<p>tiful thoughts of my earliest youth. Believe that I have
</p>
<p>not fallen ; I am consumed by a secret hope which I can-
</p>
<p>not confide even to you. I despise, as much as you, the
</p>
<p>ambition which will seem to possess me. All the world
</p>
<p>will believe it ; but what do I care for the world ? As for
</p>
<p>you, my noble friend, promise me that you will not cease
</p>
<p>to esteem me, whatever you may see me do. I swear by

<p>heaven that my thoughts are pure as it!"
</p>
<p>188 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Well," said De Thou, " I swear by it that I believe
</p>
<p>you blindly ; you give me back my life ! "
</p>
<p>They shook hands again with effusion of heart, and
</p>
<p>then perceived that they were arrived almost before the
</p>
<p>tent of the king.
</p>
<p>Day was nearly over ; but one might have believed
</p>
<p>that a softer day was rising, for the moon issued from
</p>
<p>the sea in all her splendor. The transparent sky of the
</p>
<p>south was not charged with a single cloud, and it seemed
</p>
<p>like a veil of pale blue sprinkled with silver spangles ;
</p>
<p>the air, still inflamed, was agitated only by the rare pas-
</p>
<p>sage of some breezes from the Mediterranean ; and all
</p>
<p>sounds had ceased upon the earth. The fatigued army
</p>
<p>reposed beneath their tents, the line of which was
</p>
<p>marked by the fires, and the besieged city seemed op-
</p>
<p>pressed by the same slumber ; upon its ramparts noth-
</p>
<p>ing was to be seen but the arms of the sentinels, which
</p>
<p>shone in the rays of the moon, or the wandering fire
</p>
<p>of the night-rounds. Nothing was to be heard but the
</p>
<p>gloomy and prolonged cries of its guards, who warned
</p>
<p>each other not to sleep.
</p>
<p>It was only around the king that all things waked,
</p>
<p>but at a great distance from him. This prince had dis-
</p>
<p>missed all his suite ; he walked alone before his tent,
</p>
<p>and stopping sometimes to contemplate the beauty of
</p>
<p>the heavens, he appeared plunged in a melancholy medi-
</p>
<p>tation. No one dared to interrupt him ; and those of
</p>
<p>the nobility who had remained in the royal quarters had
</p>
<p>gathered about the cardinal, who, at twenty paces from
</p>
<p>the king, was seated upon a little hillock of turf, fash-

</p>
<p>ioned into a seat by the soldiers. There he wiped his
</p>
<p>THE MISTAKES. 189
</p>
<p>pale forehead, fatigued with the cares of the day and
</p>
<p>with the unaccustomed weight of a suit of armor; he
</p>
<p>bade adieu in a few hurried but always attentive and
</p>
<p>polite words to those who came to salute him as they
</p>
<p>retired. He had now no one near except Joseph, who was
</p>
<p>talking with Laubardemont. The cardinal was looking
</p>
<p>at the king, to see if, before re-entering, this prince
</p>
<p>would not speak to him, when the sound of the horses
</p>
<p>of Cinq-Mars was heard. The guards of the cardinal
</p>
<p>questioned him, and allowed him to advance without
</p>
<p>followers, and only with De Thou.
</p>
<p>" You are come too late, young man, to speak with
</p>
<p>the king," said the cardinal-due, with a sharp voice.
</p>
<p>" One cannot make his Majesty wait."
</p>
<p>The two friends were going to retire, when the voice
</p>
<p>of Louis XIII. himself made itself heard. This prince
</p>
<p>was at that moment in one of those false positions which
</p>
<p>constituted the misfortune of his entire life. Profoundly
</p>
<p>irritated against his minister, but not concealing from
</p>
<p>himself that he owed the success of the day to him,
</p>
<p>desiring, moreover, to announce to him his intention to
</p>
<p>quit the army and to raise the siege of Perpignan, he was
</p>
<p>tossed between the desire of speaking to the cardinal
</p>
<p>and the fear lest his anger might be weakened. The
</p>
<p>minister, upon his part, dared not be the first to speak,
</p>
<p>being uncertain as to the thoughts which occupied the
</p>
<p>head of his master, and fearing to choose his time ill,
</p>
<p>but yet not able to decide upon retiring. Both found
</p>
<p>themselves precisely in the position of two lovers who
</p>
<p>had quarrelled and desired to have an explanation, when

<p>the king seized with joy the first opportunity of extri-
</p>
<p>190 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>eating himself. The chance was fatal to the minister.
</p>
<p>See upon what trifles depend those destinies which are
</p>
<p>called great !
</p>
<p>" Is it not M. de Cinq-Mars ? " said the king, in a loud
</p>
<p>voice. " Let him approach ; I am waiting for him."
</p>
<p>Young D'Effiat approached on horseback, and at some
</p>
<p>paces from the king desired to set foot to earth ; but
</p>
<p>scarcely had his leg touched the ground than he dropped
</p>
<p>upon his knees.
</p>
<p>" Pardon, Sire ! " said he, " I believe that I am
</p>
<p>wounded ; " and the blood issued violently from his
</p>
<p>boot.
</p>
<p>De Thou had seen him fall, and had approached to
</p>
<p>sustain him. Richelieu seized this opportunity of also
</p>
<p>advancing with dissembled eagerness.
</p>
<p>" Remove this spectacle from the eyes of the king,"
</p>
<p>said he. " You see very well that this young man is
</p>
<p>dying."
</p>
<p>" Not at all," said Louis, himself supporting him ; " a
</p>
<p>king of France knows how to see a man die, and has
</p>
<p>no fear of the blood which flows for him. This young
</p>
<p>man interests me. Let him be carried into my tent,
</p>
<p>and let him have doctors with him. If his wound is not
</p>
<p>serious, he shall come with me to Paris, for the siege
</p>
<p>is suspended, M. le Cardinal. Such is my desire ; other

<p>THE MISTAKES. 191
</p>
<p>The royal pavilion was closed, and Cinq-Mars borne
</p>
<p>in by De Thou and his people, while the Due de
</p>
<p>Richelieu, motionless and stupefied, still regarded the
</p>
<p>spot where this scene had passed. He appeared thun-
</p>
<p>derstruck, and incapable of seeing or hearing those who
</p>
<p>observed him.
</p>
<p>Laubardemont, still intimidated by his ill reception of
</p>
<p>the preceding day, dared not speak a word to him, and
</p>
<p>Joseph hardly recognized in him his former master. For
</p>
<p>an instant he regretted having given himself to him,
</p>
<p>and fancied that his star was waning ; but reflecting
</p>
<p>that he was hated by all men and had no resource save
</p>
<p>in Richelieu, he seized him by the arm, and shaking him
</p>
<p>roughly, said to him in a low voice, but with asperity,
</p>
<p>" Come, come, Monseigneur, you are chicken-hearted ;
</p>
<p>come with us."
</p>
<p>And seeming to sustain him by the elbow, but in fact
</p>
<p>drawing him in spite of himself, with the aid of Lau-
</p>
<p>bardemont, he made him enter his tent, as a school-
</p>
<p>master forces a schoolboy to rest, fearing the effects
</p>
<p>of the evening mist upon him.
</p>
<p>The prematurely aged man slowly obeyed the wishes
</p>
<p>of his two parasites, and the purple of the pavilion

<p>CHAPTER XII.
</p>
<p>THE NIGHT-WATCH.
</p>
<p>coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me !
</p>
<p>The lights burn blue. Is it not dead midnight ?
</p>
<p>Cold, fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
</p>
<p>What do I fear ? Myself ?
</p>
<p>1 love myself ! SHAKSPEARE.
</p>
<p>SCARCELY was the cardinal in his tent before he dropped,
</p>
<p>armed and cuirassed, into a great armchair ; and there,
</p>
<p>holding his handkerchief to his mouth with a fixed look,
</p>
<p>he remained in this attitude, letting his two dark con-
</p>
<p>fidants wonder whether contemplation or annihilation
</p>
<p>maintained him in it. He was deadly pale, and a cold
</p>
<p>sweat streamed upon his brow. In wiping it, with a
</p>
<p>sudden movement he threw behind him his red cap, the
</p>
<p>only ecclesiastical sign which remained upon him, and
</p>
<p>dropped again with his mouth upon his hands. The
</p>
<p>Capuchin on one side, and the sombre magistrate on the
</p>
<p>other, considered him in silence, and seemed with their
</p>
<p>brown and black costumes like the priest and the notary

<p>of a dying man.
</p>
<p>THE NIGHT-WATCH, 193
</p>
<p>The friar, drawing from the depth of his chest a voice
</p>
<p>which seemed better suited to repeat the service of the
</p>
<p>dead than to administer consolation, spoke first,
</p>
<p>" If Monseigneur will please to recall my counsels
</p>
<p>given at Narbonne, he will confess that I had a just
</p>
<p>presentiment of the troubles which this young man
</p>
<p>would one day cause him. '
</p>
<p>The magistrate continued,
</p>
<p>"I have learned from the old deaf abbe* who dined
</p>
<p>at the house of the Mare'chale d'Effiat, and who heard
</p>
<p>all, that this young Cinq-Mars exhibited more energy
</p>
<p>than one would have imagined, and that he attempted
</p>
<p>to rescue the Marshal de Bassompierre. I have still
</p>
<p>by me the detailed report of the deaf man, who played
</p>
<p>his part very well. His Eminence the Cardinal must
</p>
<p>be sufficiently convinced by it."
</p>
<p>"I have told Monseigneur," recommenced Joseph,
</p>
<p>for these two ferocious Seyds alternated their discourse
</p>
<p>like the shepherds of Virgil, "I have told him that it
</p>
<p>would be well to get rid of this young D'Effiat, and that
</p>
<p>I would charge myself with the business, if such were
</p>
<p>his good pleasure. It would be easy to destroy him in
</p>
<p>the opinion of the king."
</p>
<p>" It would be safer to make him die of his wound,"
</p>
<p>answered Laubardemont ; " if his Eminence would have
</p>
<p>the goodness to command me, I know intimately the
</p>
<p>assistant-physician, who has cured me of a blow on the
</p>
<p>forehead, and is now attending to him. He is a prudent
</p>
<p>man, who is quite devoted to Monseigneur the Cardinal-
</p>
<p>Due, and whose affairs have been somewhat embarrassed
</p>
<p>by gambling."

</p>
<p>" I believe," replied Joseph, with an air of modesty,
</p>
<p>mingled with a little bitterness, " that if his Excellency
</p>
<p>proposed to employ any one in this useful project, it
</p>
<p>would be rather his accustomed negotiator, who has had
</p>
<p>some success on past occasions."
</p>
<p>" I fancy that I could enumerate some signal in-
</p>
<p>stances," answered Laubardemont, " and very recent
</p>
<p>ones, of which the difficulty was great."
</p>
<p>" Ah, no doubt," said the father, with a bow and an
</p>
<p>air of consideration and politeness, "your most bold
</p>
<p>and skilfully executed commission was the trial of
</p>
<p>Urbain Grandier, the magician. But with Heaven's
</p>
<p>assistance one may be enabled to execute things as
</p>
<p>excellent and bold. It is not quite without merit, for
</p>
<p>instance," added he, dropping his eyes like a young
</p>
<p>girl, " to have vigorously extirpated a royal Bourbon
</p>
<p>branch."
</p>
<p>"It was not very difficult," answered the magistrate,
</p>
<p>with bitterness, " to select a soldier from the guards to
</p>
<p>kill the Comte de Soissons ; but to preside, judge "
</p>
<p>"And execute one's self," interrupted the heated
</p>
<p>Capuchin, " is certainly less difficult than to educate a
</p>
<p>man from infancy in the thought of accomplishing great
</p>
<p>things with discretion, and to bear all tortures, if neces-
</p>
<p>sary, for the love of Heaven, rather than reveal the name
</p>
<p>of those who have armed him with their justice, or to
</p>
<p>die courageously upon the body of him that he has
</p>
<p>struck, as did one who was commissioned by me. He
</p>
<p>uttered no cry at the blow of the sword of Riquemont,
</p>
<p>the squire of the prince. He died like a saint ; he was

<p>' " To give orders is a different thing from running
</p>
<p>risk one's self."
</p>
<p>" And did I risk nothing at the siege of Rochelle ? "
</p>
<p>" Of being drowned in a sewer, no doubt," said
</p>
<p>Laubardemont.
</p>
<p>" And you," said Joseph, " has your danger been
</p>
<p>that of catching your fingers in instruments of tor-
</p>
<p>ture ? And all this because the abbess of the Ursulines
</p>
<p>is your niece."
</p>
<p>" It was a good thing for your brothers of Saint
</p>
<p>Francis, who held the hammers ; but I, I was struck
</p>
<p>in the forehead by this same Cinq-Mars, who was lead-
</p>
<p>ing an enraged multitude."
</p>
<p>" Are you quite sure of that ? " cried Joseph, de-
</p>
<p>lighted. " Did he dare to act thus against the com-
</p>
<p>mands of the king ? " The joy which this discovery
</p>
<p>gave him made him forget his anger.
</p>
<p>" Fools ! " exclaimed the cardinal, suddenly breaking
</p>
<p>silence, and taking from his lips his handkerchief
</p>
<p>stained with blood. " I would punish your miserable
</p>
<p>dispute had it not taught me many secrets of infamy on
</p>
<p>your part. You have exceeded my orders ; I commanded
</p>
<p>no torture, Laubardemont. That is your second fault.
</p>
<p>You get me hated for nothing ; that was useless. But
</p>
<p>you, Joseph, do not neglect the details of this disturb-
</p>
<p>ance in which Cinq-Mars was engaged ; it may be of use
</p>
<p>in the end."
</p>
<p>"I have all the names and descriptions," said the
</p>
<p>secret judge, eagerly, bending his tall form and 1 thin
</p>
<p>and olive-colored visage, wrinkled with a servile smile,

</p>
<p>" It is well ! it is well ! " said the minister, pushing
</p>
<p>him back ; " but that is not the question yet. You,
</p>
<p>Joseph, be in Paris before this young upstart, who will
</p>
<p>be favorite, I am certain. Become his friend ; make him
</p>
<p>of my party or destroy him. Let him serve me or fall.
</p>
<p>But, above all, send me every day safe persons to give
</p>
<p>me verbal accounts. I will have no more writing for
</p>
<p>the future. I am very ill satisfied with you, Joseph.
</p>
<p>What a miserable courier you chose to send from
</p>
<p>Cologne ! He could not understand me. He saw the
</p>
<p>king too soon, and here we are still in disgrace in con-
</p>
<p>sequence. You have just missed losing me entirely.
</p>
<p>Go and watch what is about to be done at Paris. A
</p>
<p>conspiracy will soon be hatched against me ; but it will
</p>
<p>be the last. I remain here in order to let them all act
</p>
<p>more freely. Go, both of you, and send me my valet
</p>
<p>after the lapse of two hours ; I wish to be alone."
</p>
<p>The steps of these two men were still to be heard as
</p>
<p>Richelieu, with eyes fixed upon the entrance to the tent,
</p>
<p>seemed to pursue them with his irritated looks.
</p>
<p>" Wretches ! " exclaimed he, when he was alone, " go
</p>
<p>and accomplish some more secret work, and afterwards
</p>
<p>I will crush yourselves, impure instruments of my power.
</p>
<p>The king will soon succumb beneath the slow malady
</p>
<p>which consumes him. I shall then be regent; I shall
</p>
<p>be King of France myself ; I shall no longer have to
</p>
<p>dread the caprices of his weakness. I will destroy the

<p>haughty races of this country. I will be alone above

</p>
<p>" Ah, what do I say ? Unhappy victim that I am !
</p>
<p>Here am I, death-stricken ! My dissolution is near ;
</p>
<p>my blood flows, and my spirit desires to labor still.
</p>
<p>Why ? For whom ? Is it for glory ? 'T is an empty
</p>
<p>word. Is it for men ? I despise them. For whom, then,
</p>
<p>since I shall die, perhaps, in two or three years ? Is
</p>
<p>it for God ? What a name ! I have not walked with
</p>
<p>him ! He has seen all
</p>
<p>Here he let his head fall upon his breast, and his eyes
</p>
<p>met the great cross of gold which was suspended from
</p>
<p>his neck. He could not help throwing himself back in
</p>
<p>his chair ; but it followed him. He took it ; and con-
</p>
<p>sidering it with fixed and devouring looks, he said in
</p>
<p>a low voice,
</p>
<p>" Terrible sign ! thou followest me ! Shall I find thee
</p>
<p>elsewhere, divinity and suffering ? What am I ? What
</p>
<p>have I done ? "
</p>
<p>For the first time a singular and unknown terror
</p>
<p>penetrated him. He trembled, at once frozen and
</p>
<p>scorched by an invincible shudder. He dared not lift
</p>
<p>his eyes, fearing to meet some terrible vision. He
</p>
<p>dared not call, fearing to hear the sound of his own
</p>
<p>voice. He remained profoundly plunged in the contem-
</p>
<p>plation of eternity, so terrible for him, and he mur-
</p>
<p>mured the following kind of prayer :
</p>
<p>" Great God, if you hear me, judge me then, but do
</p>
<p>not isolate me in judging me ! Look upon me sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by the men of my generation ; consider the
</p>
<p>enormous work which I had undertaken ! Was not an
</p>
<p>enormous lever wanted to bestir those masses ; and if

<p>this lever in falling crushes some useless wretches, am

</p>
<p>I very culpable ? I seem wicked to men ; but thou, Su-
</p>
<p>preme Judge, dost thou regard me thus ? No ; thou
</p>
<p>knowest that it is boundless power which makes crea-
</p>
<p>ture culpable against creature. It is not Armand de
</p>
<p>Richelieu who destroys ; it is the prime minister. It is
</p>
<p>not for his personal injuries; it is to carry out a system.
</p>
<p>But a system what is this word ? Is it permitted me
</p>
<p>to play thus with men, to regard them as numbers for
</p>
<p>working out a thought, which perhaps is false ? I over-
</p>
<p>turn the framework of the throne. What if, without
</p>
<p>knowing it, I sap its foundations and hasten its fall !
</p>
<p>Yes, my borrowed power has seduced me. O labyrinth !
</p>
<p>weakness of human thought ! Simple faith, why did
</p>
<p>1 quit thy path ? Why am I not a simple priest ? If I
</p>
<p>dared to break with man and give myself to God, the
</p>
<p>ladder of Jacob would again descend in my dreams."
</p>
<p>At this moment his ear was struck by a great noise
</p>
<p>outside, laughter of soldiers, ferocious shouts and
</p>
<p>oaths, mingled with words which were a long time sus-
</p>
<p>tained by a weak and clear voice ; one would have said
</p>
<p>that it was the voice of an angel interrupted by the
</p>
<p>laughter of demons. He rose and opened a sort of
</p>
<p>linen window, worked in the sides of his square tent.
</p>
<p>A singular spectacle presented itself to his view ; he
</p>
<p>remained some instants contemplating it, attentive to
</p>
<p>the conversation which was going on.
</p>
<p>" Listen, listen, La Valeur ! " said one soldier to an-
</p>
<p>other. " See, she begins again to speak and to sing !
</p>
<p>Set her in the middle of the circle between us and

<p>another. " Here is Grand-Ferrd, who says that he knows
</p>
<p>her."
</p>
<p>" Yes, I tell you I know her ; and, by Saint Peter
</p>
<p>of Loudun, I will swear that I have seen her in my
</p>
<p>village, when I had leave of absence ; and it was upon
</p>
<p>an occasion at which one shuddered, but concerning
</p>
<p>which one dares not talk, especially to a Cardinalist
</p>
<p>like you."
</p>
<p>" Eh ! and pray why dare not one speak of it,
</p>
<p>you great simpleton ? " said an old soldier, raising his
</p>
<p>mustache.
</p>
<p>" It is not spoken of because it burns the tongue. Do
</p>
<p>you understand that ? "
</p>
<p>" No, I don't understand it."
</p>
<p>" Well, nor I neither ; but they were citizens who told
</p>
<p>it to me."
</p>
<p>Here a general laugh interrupted him.
</p>
<p>" Ha, ha, ha ! is he a fool ? " said one. " He listens
</p>
<p>to what the townsfolk tell him."
</p>
<p>" Ah, well ! if yoti listen to their jabber, you have
</p>
<p>time to lose," said another.
</p>
<p>"You do not know, then, what my mother said,

<p>greenhorn ? " said the eldest, gravely dropping his eyes
</p>
<p>with a solemn air, to get himself listened to.
</p>
<p>" Eh ! how can you think that I know it, La Pipe ?
</p>
<p>Your mother must have died of old age before my
</p>
<p>grandfather came into the world."

</p>
<p>round her neck in a barrel, and drank better than the
</p>
<p>best of us. She had fourteen husbands, all soldiers,
</p>
<p>who died upon the field of battle."
</p>
<p>" Ha ! that was a woman ! " interrupted the soldiers,
</p>
<p>full of respect.
</p>
<p>" And never once in her life did she speak to a towns-
</p>
<p>man, unless it was to tell him on coming to her lodging,
</p>
<p>' Light my candle, and warm my soup.' "
</p>
<p>" Well, and what is that your mother said to you ? "
</p>
<p>" If you are in such a hurry, you shall not know,
</p>
<p>greenhorn. She said habitually in her talk, ' A soldier
</p>
<p>is better than a dog ; but a dog is better than a
</p>
<p>bourgeois? "
</p>
<p>" Bravo ! bravo ! that was well said ! " cried the
</p>
<p>soldier, filled with enthusiasm at these fine words.
</p>
<p>" That," said Grand-Ferre*, " does not prove that the
</p>
<p>citizens who made the remark to me that it burned
</p>
<p>the tongue were unreasonable ; besides, they were not
</p>
<p>altogether citizens, for they had swords, and they were
</p>
<p>grieved at a cure* being burned, and so was I."
</p>
<p>" Eh ! what was it to you that they burned your cure*,

</p>
<p>fork of his arquebuse ; " after him another would come.

<p>who are all cure's at present ; for me, I am a Royalist,

<p>and I say it frankly."

<p>us in our amusements."

<p>you even know what it is to be a Royalist ? "
</p>
<p>THE NIGHT-WATCH. 201
</p>
<p>" Yes," said La Pipe ; " I know you all very well.
</p>
<p>Go, you are for the old self-called princes of the peace,
</p>
<p>together with the wranglers against the cardinal and
</p>
<p>the gabelle; there, am I right or not?"
</p>
<p>" No, old red-legs. A Royalist is one who is for the
</p>
<p>king; that's what it is. And as my father was the
</p>
<p>king's valet, I am for the king, you see ; and I have
</p>
<p>no liking for the red-legs, that's flat."
</p>
<p>" Ah, do you call me red-legs ? " answered the old
</p>
<p>soldier. "You shall give me satisfaction to-morrow
</p>
<p>morning. If you had made war in the Valteline, you
</p>
<p>would not talk in that style ; and if you had seen his
</p>
<p>Eminence marching upon the dike at Rochelle, with the
</p>
<p>old Marquis de Spinola, while volleys of cannon-shot
</p>
<p>were sent after him, you would have nothing to say
</p>
<p>about red-legs."
</p>
<p>" Come, let us amuse ourselves instead of quarrelling,"
</p>
<p>said the other soldiers.
</p>
<p>The men who conversed thus were standing round a
</p>
<p>great fire, which illuminated them more than the moon,
</p>
<p>beautiful as it was ; and in the middle of them was the
</p>
<p>object of their gathering together and their cries. The
</p>
<p>cardinal perceived a young woman arrayed in black and
</p>
<p>covered with a long white veil. Her feet were naked ; a
</p>
<p>thick cord clasped her elegant person; a long rosary fell
</p>
<p>from her neck almost to her feet; her hands, delicate
</p>
<p>and white as ivory, turned its beads and made them
</p>
<p>pass rapidly beneath her fingers. The soldiers with a
</p>
<p>barbarous joy amused themselves with laying little
</p>

</p>
<p>approaching it to the edge of her robe, said in a hoarse
</p>
<p>voice,
</p>
<p>" Come, madcap, tell me your history, or I will fill you
</p>
<p>with powder and blow you up like a mine ; take care,
</p>
<p>for I have already played that trick to others besides
</p>
<p>you, in the old wars of the Huguenots. Come, sing."
</p>
<p>The young woman, looking at him gravely, replied
</p>
<p>nothing, and let down her veil.
</p>
<p>" You don't manage her well," said Grand-Ferre", with
</p>
<p>a drunken laugh ; " you will make her cry. You don't
</p>
<p>know the fine language of the court ; let me speak to
</p>
<p>her." And touching her on the chin, " My little heart,"
</p>
<p>he said, " if you will please, my sweet, to recommence
</p>
<p>the little story you told just now to these gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I will pray you to travel with me upon the river Du
</p>
<p>Tendre, as the great ladies of Paris say, and to take a
</p>
<p>glass of brandy with your faithful chevalier, who met
</p>
<p>you formerly at Loudun, when you played a comedy in
</p>
<p>order to burn a poor devil."
</p>
<p>The young woman crossed her arms, and looking
</p>
<p>around her with an imperious air, cried,
</p>
<p>" Withdraw, in the name of the God of armies ; with-
</p>
<p>draw, impious men ! There is nothing in common be-
</p>
<p>tween us. I do not understand your tongue, nor you
</p>
<p>mine. Go, sell your blood to the princes of the earth at
</p>
<p>so many oboles a day, and leave me to accomplish my
</p>
<p>mission! Conduct me to the cardinal."
</p>
<p>A coarse laugh interrupted her.
</p>
<p>" Do you think," said a carabineer of Maurevert, " that
</p>
<p>his Eminence the Generalissimo will receive you with

<p>vour feet naked ? Go and wash them."
</p>
<p>THE NIGHT-WATCH. 203
</p>
<p>"The Lord has said, 'Jerusalem, lift thy robe, and
</p>
<p>pass the rivers of water,' " answered she, her arms still
</p>
<p>crossed. "Let me be conducted to the cardinal."
</p>
<p>Richelieu cried in a loud voice, " Bring the woman to
</p>
<p>me, and let her alone ! "
</p>
<p>All were silent ; they conducted her to the minister.
</p>
<p>" Why," said she, beholding him, " why bring me
</p>
<p>before an armed man ? "
</p>
<p>They left her alone with him without answering.
</p>
<p>The cardinal looked at her with a suspicious air.
</p>
<p>" Madame," said he, " what are you doing in the camp
</p>
<p>at this hour? And if your mind is not disordered, why
</p>
<p>these naked feet ? "
</p>
<p>" It is a vow ; it is a vow," answered the young
</p>
<p>woman, with an air of impatience, seating herself
</p>
<p>beside him abruptly. " I have also made one not to
</p>
<p>eat until I have found the man I seek."
</p>
<p>" My sister," said the cardinal, astonished and soft-
</p>
<p>ened, approaching to observe her, " God does not exact
</p>
<p>such rigors from a weak body, and particularly from one
</p>
<p>of your age, for you seem very young."
</p>
<p>" Young ! oh, yes, I was very young a few days
</p>
<p>ago ; but I have since passed two existences at least,
</p>
<p>so much have I thought and suffered. Look on my
</p>
<p>countenance."
</p>
<p>And she discovered a face perfectly beautiful. Black
</p>
<p>and very regular eyes gave life to it ; but in their ab-
</p>
<p>sence one might have thought her features were those
</p>
<p>of a phantom, she was so pale. Her lips were blue and
</p>
<p>quivered ; and a strong shudder made the encounter of

<p>her teeth audible.

<p>204 CINQ- MARS.
</p>
<p>"You are ill, my sister," said the minister, touched,
</p>
<p>taking her hand, which he felt to be burning hot. A
</p>
<p>sort of habit of inquiring concerning his own health,
</p>
<p>and that of others, made him touch the pulse of her
</p>
<p>emaciated arm; he felt the arteries lifted by the beatings
</p>
<p>of a terrible fever.
</p>
<p>" Alas," continued he, with more of interest, " you
</p>
<p>have killed yourself with rigors beyond human strength !
</p>
<p>I have always blamed them, and especially at a tender
</p>
<p>age. What, then, has induced you to this? Is it to
</p>
<p>confide it to me that you are come ? Speak calmly,
</p>
<p>and be sure of succor."
</p>
<p>" Confide in men ! " answered the } r oung woman ; " oh,
</p>
<p>no, never ! They have all deceived me. I will confide
</p>
<p>myself to no one, not even to M. Cinq-Mars, although
</p>
<p>he must soon die."
</p>
<p>" What ! " said Richelieu, contracting his brows, but
</p>
<p>with a bitter laugh, "what! do you know this young
</p>
<p>man ? Has he been the cause of your misfortune ? "
</p>
<p>" Oh, no ! He is very good, and hates wickedness ;
</p>
<p>that is what will ruin him. Besides," said she, suddenly
</p>
<p>assuming a harsh and savage air, " men are weak, and
</p>
<p>there are things which women must accomplish. When
</p>
<p>there were no more valiant men in Israel, Deborah
</p>
<p>arose."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! how came you with all this fine learning ? "
</p>
<p>continued the cardinal, still holding her hand.
</p>
<p>" Oh, I can't explain that ! " answered she, with a
</p>
<p>touching air of na'ivet^ and a very gentle voice ; " you
</p>
<p>would not understand me. It is the Devil who has

<p>taught me all, and who has destroyed me."
</p>
<p>THE NIGHT-WATCH. 205
</p>
<p>" Ah, my child ! it is always he who destroys us ;
</p>
<p>but he instructs us ill," said Richelieu, with an air
</p>
<p>of paternal protection and an increasing pity. " What
</p>
<p>have been your faults ? Tell them to me ; I have much
</p>
<p>power."
</p>
<p>" Ah," said she, with a look; of doubt, " you have
</p>
<p>much influence over warriors, brave men and generals !
</p>
<p>Beneath your cuirass there must beat a noble heart ;
</p>
<p>you are an old general who knows nothing of the tricks
</p>
<p>of crime."
</p>
<p>Richelieu smiled ; this mistake flattered him.
</p>
<p>" I heard you ask for the cardinal ; do you desire to
</p>
<p>see him ? Did you come here to seek him ? "
</p>
<p>The girl drew back and placed a finger upon her
</p>
<p>forehead.
</p>
<p>" I had forgotten it," said she ; " you have talked to
</p>
<p>me too much. I had overlooked this idea, and yet it
</p>
<p>an important one; it is for it that I have condemned
</p>
<p>myself to the hunger which kills me. I must accom-
</p>
<p>plish it, or I shall die first. Ah," said she, putting
</p>
<p>her hand beneath her robe in her bosom, whence she
</p>
<p>appeared to take something, " behold it ! this idea "
</p>
<p>She suddenly blushed, and her eyes widened extra-
</p>
<p>ordinarily. She continued, bending to the ear of the
</p>
<p>cardinal,
</p>
<p>" I will tell you ; listen. Urbain Grandier, my lover
</p>
<p>Urbain, told me this night that it was Richelieu who
</p>
<p>had been the cause of his death. I took a knife from
</p>
<p>an inn, and 1 come here to kill him ; tell me where
</p>
<p>he is."

<p>The cardinal, surprised and terrified, recoiled with
</p>
<p>206 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>horror. He dared not call his guards, fearing the cries
</p>
<p>of this woman and her accusations ; and nevertheless, a
</p>
<p>transport of this madness might be fatal to him.
</p>
<p>" This frightful history will pursue me everywhere ! "
</p>
<p>cried he, looking fixedly at her, and thinking within
</p>
<p>himself of the course he should take.
</p>
<p>They remained in silence, face to face, in the same
</p>
<p>attitude, like two wrestlers who contemplate before at-
</p>
<p>tacking one another, or like the pointer and his victim
</p>
<p>petrified by the power of a look.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, Laubardernont and Joseph had
</p>
<p>gone forth together ; and ere separating they talked for
</p>
<p>a moment before the tent of the cardinal, because they
</p>
<p>wanted mutually to deceive each other. Their hatred
</p>
<p>had just acquired new force by their quarrel ; and each
</p>
<p>had resolved to ruin his rival in the mind of his master.
</p>
<p>The judge began the dialogue, which each of them had
</p>
<p>prepared, taking the arm of the other as by one and the
</p>
<p>same movement.
</p>
<p>" Ah, reverend father ! how you have afflicted me by
</p>
<p>seeming to take in ill part some trifling pleasantries
</p>
<p>which I said to you just now."
</p>
<p>" Heavens, no ! my dear sir, I am far from that.
</p>
<p>Charity, where would be charity ? I have sometimes a
</p>
<p>holy warmth in conversation, for the good of the State
</p>
<p>and of Monseigneur, to whom I am entirely devoted."
</p>
<p>" Ah, who knows it better than I, reverend father ?
</p>
<p>But render me justice ; you also know how completely
</p>
<p>I am attached to his Eminence the Cardinal, to whom
</p>
<p>I owe all. Alas ! I have employed too much zeal in

<p>serving him, since he reproaches me with it."
</p>
<p>THE NIGHT-WATCH. 207
</p>
<p>" Reassure yourself," said Joseph ; " he bears no ill-
</p>
<p>will towards you. I know him well ; he can appreciate
</p>
<p>one's actions in favor of one's family. He too is a very
</p>
<p>good relative."
</p>
<p>" Yes, there it is," answered Laubardemont ; " con-
</p>
<p>sider niy condition. My niece was totally lost with her
</p>
<p>convent if Urbain had triumphed ; you feel that as
</p>
<p>well as I do, particularly as she did not quite compre-
</p>
<p>hend us, and acted the child when she was obliged
</p>
<p>to appear."
</p>
<p>" Is it possible ? In full audience ! What you tell
</p>
<p>me indeed makes me feel for you. How painful it
</p>
<p>must have been ! "
</p>
<p>" More so than you can imagine. She forgot, in her
</p>
<p>possession, all that she had been told, committed a
</p>
<p>thousand blunders in Latin, which we patched up as
</p>
<p>well as we could; and she even caused an unpleasant
</p>
<p>scene on the day of the trial, very unpleasant for me
</p>
<p>and the judges, there were faintings-away and shrieks.
</p>
<p>Ah, I swear that I would have scolded her well if I had
</p>
<p>not been forced to quit precipitately that little town
</p>
<p>of Loudun. But, look you, it is natural enough that
</p>
<p>I am attached to her. She is my nearest relative ; for
</p>
<p>my son has turned out ill, and no one knows what has
</p>
<p>become of him during the last four years. Poor little
</p>
<p>Jeanne de Belfiel ! I made her a nun, and then abbess,
</p>
<p>in order to preserve all for that scamp. If I had fore-
</p>
<p>seen his conduct, I would have retained her for the
</p>
<p>world."
</p>
<p>" She is said to have great beauty," answered Joseph ;

</p>
<p>" that is a precious gift for a family. She might have
</p>
<p>208 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>been presented at court, and the king Ah ! ah !
</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de la Fayette eh ! eh ! Mademoiselle
</p>
<p>d'Hautefort you understand ; it may be even possible
</p>
<p>to think of it yet."
</p>
<p>" Ah, that is like you, Monseigneur ! for we know
</p>
<p>that you have been nominated to the cardinalate ; how
</p>
<p>good you are to remember the most devoted of your
</p>
<p>friends ! "
</p>
<p>Laubardemont was yet talking to Joseph when they
</p>
<p>found themselves at the end of the line of the camp,
</p>
<p>which led to the quarter of the volunteers.
</p>
<p>" May God and his holy Mother protect you during
</p>
<p>my absence ! " said Joseph, stopping. " To-morrow I de-
</p>
<p>part for Paris; and as I shall have frequent business
</p>
<p>with this young Cinq-Mars, I will first go to see him,
</p>
<p>and learn news of his wound."
</p>
<p>" If I had been listened to," said Laubardemont, " you
</p>
<p>would not now have had this trouble."
</p>
<p>" Alas, you are right ! " answered Joseph, with a pro-
</p>
<p>found sigh, and raising his eyes to heaven ; " but the
</p>
<p>cardinal is no longer the same man. He will not take
</p>
<p>advantage of good ideas ; he will ruin us if he goes
</p>
<p>on so."
</p>
<p>And making a low bow to the judge, the Capuchin
</p>
<p>took the road which he had indicated to him.
</p>
<p>Laubardemont followed him for some time with his
</p>
<p>eyes, and when he was quite sure of the route which
</p>
<p>he had taken, he returned, or rather ran back, to the
</p>
<p>tent of the minister. "The cardinal sends him away,
</p>
<p>he tells me ; that shows that he is tired of him. I know

</p>
<p>to pay court to the future favorite. I will replace this
</p>
<p>monk in the favor of the minister. The moment is
</p>
<p>propitious. It is midnight ; he is to be alone for an
</p>
<p>hour and a half yet. Let me run."
</p>
<p>He arrived at the tent of the guards, which was before
</p>
<p>the pavilion.
</p>
<p>" Monseigneur gives audience to some one," said the
</p>
<p>captain, hesitating; "you cannot enter."
</p>
<p>" Never mind ; you saw me leave an hour ago, and
</p>
<p>there are things passing of which I must give an
</p>
<p>account."
</p>
<p>" Come in, Laubardemont," cried the minister ; " come
</p>
<p>in quickly, and alone."
</p>
<p>He entered. The cardinal, still seated, held the two
</p>
<p>hands of the nun in one of his, and with the other he
</p>
<p>imposed silence upon his stupefied agent, who remained
</p>
<p>motionless, not yet seeing the face of this woman. She
</p>
<p>spoke volubly, and the strange things she said contrasted
</p>
<p>horribly with the sweetness of her voice. Richelieu
</p>
<p>seemed moved.
</p>
<p>" Yes, I will stab him with a knife. It is the knife
</p>
<p>which the demon Beherith gave me at the inn ; but it
</p>
<p>is the nail of Sisera. It has a handle of ivory, look you ;
</p>
<p>and I have wept much over it. Is it not singular, my
</p>
<p>good general ? I will turn it in the throat of him who
</p>
<p>killed my friend, as he himself told me to do; and after-
</p>
<p>wards I will burn the body. There is like for like, the
</p>
<p>punishment which God permitted to Adam. You have
</p>
<p>an astonished air, my brave general ; but you would be
</p>
<p>much more so, if I were to repeat to you his song,

<p>the song which he sang to me again yesterday night, at

</p>
<p>the hour of the funeral- pyre, you understand? the
</p>
<p>hour when it rains, the hour when my hand burns, as
</p>
<p>now. He said to me, ' They are much deceived, the
</p>
<p>magistrates, the red judges. I have eleven demons at
</p>
<p>my command ; and I shall come to see you when the
</p>
<p>clock strikes, under a canopy of purple velvet, with
</p>
<p>torches, torches of resin to give us light ' Ah, that
</p>
<p>is beautiful ! Listen, listen to what he sings ! "
</p>
<p>And she sang a strange and melancholy strain to the
</p>
<p>air of De Profundis.
</p>
<p>" Is it not singular, my good general ? " said she,
</p>
<p>when she had finished ; " and I, I answer him every
</p>
<p>evening. Then he speaks, and speaks as spirits and
</p>
<p>prophets do. He says, ' Woe, woe to him who has shed
</p>
<p>blood ! Are the judges of the earth gods ? No, they
</p>
<p>are men who grow old and suffer, and yet they dare
</p>
<p>to say aloud, Let that man die ! The penalty of death,
</p>
<p>the pain of death, who has given to man the right of
</p>
<p>imposing it on man ? Is the number two ? One would
</p>
<p>be an assassin, look you ! But count well, one, two,
</p>
<p>three. Behold, they are wise and just, these grave and
</p>
<p>salaried criminals ! crime, the horror of Heaven ! If
</p>
<p>you looked upon them from above as I look upon them,
</p>
<p>you would be yet paler than I am. Flesh destroys flesh !
</p>
<p>That which lives by blood sheds blood coldly and with-
</p>
<p>out anger, like a God with power to create ! ' '
</p>
<p>The cries which the unhappy girl uttered, as she
</p>
<p>rapidly spoke these words, terrified Richelieu and Lau-
</p>
<p>bardemont so much that they still remained motionless.

<p>The delirium and the fever continued to transport

</p>
<p>" ' Did the judges tremble ? ' said Urbain Grandier to
</p>
<p>me. ' Did they tremble at deceiving themselves ? ' They
</p>
<p>work the death of the just. The question ! They bind
</p>
<p>his limbs with ropes to make him speak. His skin
</p>
<p>cracks, tears away, and rolls up like a parchment ; his
</p>
<p>nerves are naked, red, and glittering ; his bones crack ;
</p>
<p>the marrow spurts out. But the judges sleep ! they
</p>
<p>dream of flowers and spring. ' How hot the grand cham-
</p>
<p>ber is ! ' says one, awaking ; 'this man has not chosen to
</p>
<p>speak ! Is the torture finished ?' And pitiful at last, he
</p>
<p>dooms him to death, death, the sole fear of the living!
</p>
<p>death, the unknown world ! He sends before him a
</p>
<p>furious soul which will wait for him. Oh ! has he never
</p>
<p>seen the vision of vengeance ? Has he never seen before
</p>
<p>falling to sleep the flayed prevaricator?"
</p>
<p>Already, weakened by fever, fatigue, and grief, the
</p>
<p>cardinal, seized with horror and pity, exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Ah, for the love of God, let this terrible scene have
</p>
<p>an end ! Take away this woman ; she is mad ! "
</p>
<p>The frantic creature turned, and suddenly uttering
</p>
<p>loud cries, " Ah, the judge ! the judge ! the judge ! " she
</p>
<p>said, recognizing Laubardemont.
</p>
<p>The latter, clasping his hands, and trembling before
</p>
<p>the cardinal, said with terror,
</p>
<p>" Alas, Monseigncur, pardon me ! she is my niece,
</p>
<p>who has lost her reason. I was not aware of this mis-
</p>
<p>fortune, or she would have been shut up long ago.

</p>
<p>forgiveness of Monseigneur the Cardinal-Due."

<p>seemed wholly to paralyze this young and unhappy
</p>
<p>212 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>beauty. The flush which had animated her at first
</p>
<p>gave place to a deadly paleness, her cries to a motion-
</p>
<p>less silence, her wandering looks to a frightful fixed-
</p>
<p>ness of her large eyes, which constantly followed the
</p>
<p>agitated minister.
</p>
<p>" Take away this unfortunate child quickly," said he ;
</p>
<p>" she is dying, and so am I. So many horrors pursue
</p>
<p>me since that sentence that I believe all hell is loosed
</p>
<p>upon me."
</p>
<p>He rose as he spoke ; Jeanne de Belfiel, still silent
</p>
<p>and stupefied, with haggard eyes, open mouth, and head
</p>
<p>bent forward, yet remained beneath the shock of her
</p>
<p>double surprise, which seemed to have extinguished the
</p>
<p>rest of her reason and her strength. At the movement

<p>of the cardinal, she shuddered to find herself between
</p>
<p>him and Laubardemont, looked by turns at one and the
</p>
<p>other, let the knife which she held fall from her hand,
</p>
<p>and retired slowly towards the opening of the tent,
</p>
<p>covering herself completely with her veil, and looking
</p>
<p>wildly and with terror behind her upon her uncle who
</p>
<p>followed, like an affrighted lamb, which already feels
</p>
<p>at its back the burning breath of the wolf about to
</p>
<p>seize it.
</p>
<p>Thus they both went forth ; and scarcely in the open
</p>
<p>air, the furious judge caught the hands of his victim,
</p>
<p>tied them with a handkerchief, and easily led her, for
</p>
<p>she uttered no cry, not even a sigh, but followed him

<p>with her head still drooping upon her bosom, and as if

<p>CHAPTER XIII.
</p>
<p>THE SPANIARD.
</p>
<p>Qu'un ami veritable est une douce chose !
</p>
<p>II cherche vos besoms au fond de votre cceur ;
</p>
<p>II vous e'pargne la pudeur
</p>
<p>De les lui de'couvrir vous-meme.
</p>
<p>LA FONTAINE.
</p>
<p>IN the mean time, a scene of quite a different nature was
</p>
<p>passing in the tent of Cinq-Mars ; the words of the king,
</p>
<p>the first balm to his wounds, had been followed by the
</p>
<p>anxious care of the surgeons of the court. A spent ball,
</p>
<p>easily extracted, had been the only cause of his acci-
</p>
<p>dent. He was allowed to travel ; and all was ready.
</p>
<p>The invalid had received up to midnight friendly or
</p>
<p>interested visits ; among the first were those of little
</p>
<p>Gondi and of Fontrailles, who were also preparing to quit
</p>
<p>Perpignan for Paris. The ex-page, Olivier d'Entraigues,
</p>
<p>joined with them in complimenting the fortunate volun-
</p>
<p>teer, whom the king seemed to have distinguished. The
</p>
<p>habitual coldness of the prince towards all who sur-

</p>
<p>rounded him having caused those who knew of them to
</p>
<p>214 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>regard the few words he had spoken as assured signs
</p>
<p>of high favor, all came to congratulate him.
</p>
<p>At length, released from visitors, he lay upon his
</p>
<p>camp-bed. De Thou sat by his side, holding his hand,
</p>
<p>and Grandchamp at his feet, still grumbling at the
</p>
<p>numerous interruptions that had fatigued his wounded
</p>
<p>master. Cinq-Mars himself tasted one of those moments
</p>
<p>of calm and hope, which so refresh the soul as well as
</p>
<p>the body. The hand unoccupied by his friend secretly
</p>
<p>pressed the gold cross that hung next to his heart, and
</p>
<p>the beloved donor of which he was so soon to behold.
</p>
<p>It was but outwardly that with kindly looks he heard the
</p>
<p>counsels of the young magistrate ; his inward thoughts
</p>
<p>were all turned towards the object of his journey, the
</p>
<p>object, also, of his life. The grave De Thou went on
</p>
<p>in a calm, gentle voice, -
</p>
<p>" I shall soon follow you to Paris. I am happier than
</p>
<p>yourself at seeing the king take you there with him.
</p>
<p>You are right in looking upon it as the commencemen
</p>
<p>of a friendship which must be turned to profit. I have
</p>
<p>deeply reflected on the secret causes of your ambition,
</p>
<p>and I think I have divined your heart. Yes ; that
</p>
<p>feeling of love for France, which made it beat in your
</p>
<p>earliest youth, must have gained greater strength. You
</p>
<p>would be near the king in order to serve your country,
</p>
<p>in order to put in action those golden dreams of your
</p>
<p>early years. Certes, the thought is a vast one, and
</p>
<p>worthy of you ! I admire you ; I bow before you. To
</p>
<p>approach the monarch with the chivalrous devotion of
</p>
<p>our fathers, with a heart full of candor, and prepared

</p>
<p>for any sacrifice ; to receive the confidences of his soul ;
</p>
<p>THE SPANIARD. 215
</p>
<p>to pour into his those of his subjects; to soften the
</p>
<p>sorrows of the king by telling him the confidence his
</p>
<p>people have in him ; to cure the wounds of the people
</p>
<p>by laying them open to its master, and by the interven-
</p>
<p>tion of your favor thus to re-establish that intercourse
</p>
<p>of love between the father and his children which for
</p>
<p>eighteen years has been interrupted by a man whose
</p>
<p>heart is marble ; for this noble enterprise, to expose
</p>
<p>yourself to all the horrors of his vengeance and, what is
</p>
<p>even worse, to brave all the perfidious calumnies which
</p>
<p>pursue the favorite to the very steps of the throne,
</p>
<p>this dream was worthy of you. Pursue it, my friend.
</p>
<p>Be never discouraged. Speak loudly to the king of the
</p>
<p>merit and misfortunes of his most illustrious friends
</p>
<p>who are trampled on. Tell him fearlessly that his old
</p>
<p>nobility have never conspired against him ; and that
</p>
<p>from the young Montmorency to the amiable Comte de
</p>
<p>Soissons, all have opposed the minister, and never the
</p>
<p>monarch. Tell him that the old families of France
</p>
<p>were born with his race ; that in striking them he
</p>
<p>affects the whole nation ; and that if he destroy them,
</p>
<p>his own race will suffer, that it will stand alone exposed
</p>
<p>to the blast of time and events, as an old oak trembling
</p>
<p>and exposed to the wind of the plain, when the forest
</p>
<p>which surrounded and supported it has been destroyed.
</p>
<p>Yes," cried De Thou, growing animated, " this aim is a
</p>
<p>fine and noble one. Go on in your course with a reso-
</p>
<p>lute step ; expel even that secret shame, that bashfulness,
</p>
<p>which a noble soul experiences before it can resolve
</p>
<p>upon flattering, upon paying what the world calls its

</p>
<p>court. Alas, kings are accustomed to these continual
</p>
<p>216 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>expressions of false admiration for them ! Look upon
</p>
<p>them as a new language which must be learned, a
</p>
<p>language hitherto foreign to your lips, but which, believe
</p>
<p>me, may be nobly spoken, and which may express high
</p>
<p>and generous thoughts."
</p>
<p>During this warm discourse of his friend, Cinq-Mars
</p>
<p>could not refrain from a sudden blush ; and he turned
</p>
<p>his head on his pillow towards the tent, so that he
</p>
<p>might not be seen. De Thou stopped :
</p>
<p>" What is the matter, Henri ? You do not answer.
</p>
<p>Am I deceived ? "
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars gave a deep sigh, and was still silent.
</p>
<p>" Is not your heart affected by these ideas which I
</p>
<p>thought would have transported it ? "
</p>
<p>The wounded man looked more calmly at his friend,
</p>
<p>and said,
</p>
<p>" I thought, my dear De Thou, that you were not
</p>
<p>going to interrogate me farther, and that you were
</p>
<p>willing to have a blind confidence in me. What evil
</p>
<p>genius has moved you thus to sound my soul ? I am
</p>
<p>not a stranger to these ideas which possess you. Who
</p>
<p>told you that I had not conceived them ? Who told you
</p>
<p>that I had not formed the firm resolution of prosecuting
</p>
<p>them infinitely farther in action than you have put them
</p>
<p>into words ? Love for France, virtuous hatred of the
</p>
<p>ambition which oppresses and shatters her ancient insti-
</p>
<p>tutions with the axe of the executioner, the firm belief
</p>
<p>that virtue maybe as skilful as crime, these are my
</p>
<p>gods as much as yours. But when you see a man kneel-
</p>
<p>ing in a church, do you ask him what saint or what

</p>
<p>angel protects him and receives his prayer ? What
</p>
<p>THE SPANIARD. 217
</p>
<p>matters it to you, provided that he pray at the foot of
</p>
<p>the altars that you adore, provided that if called upon,
</p>
<p>he fall a martyr at the foot of those altars ? When our
</p>
<p>forefathers journeyed with naked feet towards the holy
</p>
<p>sepulchre, with a pilgrim's staff in their hands, did men
</p>
<p>inquire the secret vow which led them to the Holy
</p>
<p>Land ? They struck, they died ; and men, perhaps God
</p>
<p>himself, asked no more. The pious captain who led
</p>
<p>them never stripped their bodies to see whether the red
</p>
<p>cross and haircloth concealed any other mysterious sym-
</p>
<p>bol ; and in heaven, doubtless, they were not judged
</p>
<p>with any greater rigor for having aided the strength of
</p>
<p>their resolutions upon earth by some hope permitted
</p>
<p>to a Christian, some second or secret thought, more
</p>
<p>human, and nearer the mortal heart."
</p>
<p>De Thou smiled, and slightly colored, lowering his eyes.
</p>
<p>" My friend," he answered, gravely ; " this excitement
</p>
<p>may be injurious to you. Let us not continue this sub-
</p>
<p>ject ; let us not mingle God and heaven in our discourse.
</p>
<p>T is not well ; and draw the clothes over your shoulder,
</p>
<p>for the night is cold. I promise you," he added, cover-
</p>
<p>ing his young invalid with a maternal care, "I promise
</p>
<p>not to again offend you with my counsels."
</p>
<p>" And I," cried Cinq-Mars, despite the interdiction to
</p>
<p>speak, " swear to you by this gold cross you see, and by
</p>
<p>the holy Mary, to die rather than renounce the plan that
</p>
<p>you first traced out ! You may one day, perhaps, be
</p>
<p>forced to pray me to stop ; but then it will be 1 too late."
</p>
<p>" Well, well ! " repeated the counsellor, " now sleep ;
</p>
<p>if you do not stop, I will go on with you, wherever you

<p>lead me."
</p>
<p>218 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>And taking a prayer-book from his pocket, he began
</p>
<p>to read attentively ; in a short time he looked at Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, who was still awake. He made a sign to Grand-
</p>
<p>champ to put the lamp out of sight of the invalid ; but
</p>
<p>this new care succeeded no better. The latter, with his
</p>
<p>eyes still open, tossed restlessly on his narrow bed.
</p>
<p>" Come, you are not calm," said De Thou, smiling ;
</p>
<p>" I will read to you some pious passage which will put
</p>
<p>your mind in repose. Ah, my friend, it is here that
</p>
<p>true repose is to be found ; it is in this consolatory
</p>
<p>book, for, open it where you will, you will always see,
</p>
<p>on the one hand, man in the only condition that suits
</p>
<p>his weakness, prayer, and the uncertainty as to his des-
</p>
<p>tiny, and, on the other, God himself speaking to him
</p>
<p>of his infirmities ! What a glorious and heavenly spec-
</p>
<p>tacle ! What a sublime bond between heaven and earth !
</p>
<p>Life, death, and eternity are there ; open it at hazard."
</p>
<p>" Yes ! " said Cinq-Mars, rising with a vivacity which
</p>
<p>had something infantine in it ; " you shall read to me,
</p>
<p>but let me open the book. You know the old supersti-
</p>
<p>tion of our country, when the mass-book is opened with
</p>
<p>a sword, the first page on the left contains the destiny
</p>
<p>of him who reads, and the first person who enters after
</p>
<p>he has read is powerfully to influence the reader's future
</p>
<p>fate."
</p>
<p>" What childishness ! But be it as you will. There 's
</p>
<p>your sword ; put in the point. Let us see."
</p>
<p>"Let me read myself," said Cinq-Mars, taking one
</p>
<p>side of the book. Old Grandchamp gravely advanced
</p>
<p>his tawny face and his gray hair to the foot of the bed

</p>
<p>to listen. His master read, stopped at the first phrase,
</p>
<p>THE SPANIARD. 219
</p>
<p>but with a smile, perhaps slightly forced, he went on to
</p>
<p>the end.
</p>
<p>" I. Now it was in the city of Milan that they appeared.
</p>
<p>" II. The high-priest said to them, ' Bow down and
</p>
<p>adore the gods.'
</p>
<p>" III. And the people were silent, looking at their faces,
</p>
<p>which appeared as the faces of angels.
</p>
<p>" IV. But Gervais, taking the hand of Protais, cried,
</p>
<p>looking to heaven, and filled with the Hoi}" Ghost,
</p>
<p>"V. Oh, my brother! I see the Son of man smiling
</p>
<p>upon us ; let me die first.
</p>
<p>"VI. For if I see thy blood, I fear I shall shed tears
</p>
<p>unworthy of the Lord our God.
</p>
<p>" VII. Then Protais answered him in these words,
</p>
<p>" VIII. My brother, it is just that I should perish after
</p>
<p>thee, for I am older, and have more strength to see thee
</p>
<p>suffer.
</p>
<p>" IX. But the senators and people ground their teeth
</p>
<p>at them.
</p>
<p>" X. And the soldiers having struck them, their heads
</p>
<p>fell together on the same stone.
</p>
<p>"XI. Now it was in this same place that the blessed
</p>
<p>Saint Ambrose found the ashes of the two martyrs which
</p>
<p>gave sight to the blind."
</p>
<p>" Well," said Cinq-Mars, looking at his friend when
</p>
<p>he had finished, "what do you say to that?"
</p>
<p>" God's will be done ! but we should not scrutinize
</p>
<p>it."
</p>
<p>"Nor put off our designs for a child's play," said
</p>
<p>D'Effiat, impatiently, and pulling round him a cloak
</p>
<p>which was thrown over him. " Remember the lines we
</p>
<p>formerly so frequently quoted, ' Justum et tenacem

<p>my brain. Yes ; let the universe crumble around me,
</p>
<p>its wrecks shall carry me away still t resolute."
</p>
<p>" Let us not compare the thoughts of man with those
</p>
<p>of Heaven; and let us be submissive," said De Thou,
</p>
<p>gravely.
</p>
<p>"Amen!" said old Grandchamp, whose eyes had
</p>
<p>filled with tears, which he hastily brushed away.
</p>
<p>" What hast thou to do with it, old soldier ? Thou
</p>
<p>weepest," said his master.
</p>
<p>" Amen ! " said a voice, in a nasal tone, at the en-
</p>
<p>trance of the tent.
</p>
<p>" Parbleu, Monsieur ! rather put that question to his
</p>
<p>Gray Eminence, who comes to visit you," answered the
</p>
<p>faithful servant, pointing to Joseph, who advanced with
</p>
<p>his arms crossed, making a salutation with a frowning
</p>
<p>air.
</p>
<p>" Ah, it will be he, then ! " murmured Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" Perhaps I come mal a propos" said Joseph, sooth-
</p>
<p>ingly.
</p>
<p>" Perhaps very d propos" said Henri d'Effiat, smiling,
</p>
<p>with a glance at De Thou. " What can bring you here,
</p>
<p>Father, at one in the morning ? It should be some good
</p>
<p>work." \
</p>
<p>Joseph saw he was ill received ; and as he had always
</p>
<p>sundry reproaches to make himself with reference to all
</p>
<p>the persons whom he addressed, and as many resources
</p>
<p>in his mind for getting out of the difficulty, he fancied
</p>
<p>that they had discovered the object of his visit, and felt
</p>
<p>that it was not a moment of ill humor that he ought to
</p>
<p>select for preparing the way to friendship. Therefore,

</p>
<p>seating himself coldly near the bed, he said,
</p>
<p>THE SPANIARD. 221
</p>
<p>" I come, sir, to speak to you on the part of the car-
</p>
<p>dinal-generalissimo, of the two Spanish prisoners you have
</p>
<p>made ; he desires to have the most prompt information
</p>
<p>concerning them. I am to see and question them. But
</p>
<p>1 did not suppose you were still awake ; I merely wished
</p>
<p>to receive them of your people."
</p>
<p>After a forced interchange of politeness, they ordered
</p>
<p>into the tent the two prisoners, whom Cinq-Mars had
</p>
<p>almost forgotten.
</p>
<p>They appeared, the one, young and displaying an
</p>
<p>animated and rather wild countenance, was the sol-
</p>
<p>dier ; the other, concealing his form under a brown
</p>
<p>cloak, and his gloomy features, which had something
</p>
<p>ambiguous in their expression, under his broad-brimmed
</p>
<p>hat, which he did not take off, was the officer. He
</p>
<p>spoke first :
</p>
<p>" Why do you make me leave my straw and my sleep ?
</p>
<p>Is it to deliver me or hang me ? "
</p>
<p>" Neither," said Joseph.
</p>
<p>" What have I to do with thee, man with the long
</p>
<p>beard ? I did not see thee at the breach."
</p>
<p>It took some time after this amiable exordium to
</p>
<p>make the stranger understand the right a Capuchin had
</p>
<p>to interrogate him.
</p>
<p>" Well," he said, " what dost want? "
</p>
<p>" I would know your name and country."
</p>
<p>" I shall not tell my name ; and as for my country, I
</p>
<p>have the air of a Spaniard, but perhaps am not one, for
</p>
<p>a Spaniard never acknowledges his country."
</p>
<p>Father Joseph, turning towards the two friends, said,

</p>
<p>" Unless I deceive myself, I have heard his voice some-
</p>
<p>222 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>where. This man speaks French without any accent ;
</p>
<p>but it seems he wishes to give us enigmas, as in the
</p>
<p>East."
</p>
<p>" The East ? that 's it," said the prisoner. " A Span-
</p>
<p>iard is a man from the East ; he is a Catholic Turk ; his
</p>
<p>blood flags or boils ; he is lazy or indefatigable ; indo-
</p>
<p>lence makes him a slave, ardor a tyrant ; immovable in
</p>
<p>his ignorance, ingenious in his superstition, he wants
</p>
<p>only a religious book and a tyrannical master ; he obeys
</p>
<p>the law of the pyre ; he commands by that of the pon-
</p>
<p>iard ; at night he falls asleep in his bloodthirsty
</p>
<p>misery, nurses fanaticism, and awakes to crime. Who
</p>
<p>is this gentleman ? Is it the Spaniard or the Turk ?
</p>
<p>Guess ! Ah, ah ! you seem to discover that I have wit,
</p>
<p>because I light upon analogy. Truly, gentlemen, you
</p>
<p>do me honor ; and yet the idea may be carried much
</p>
<p>further, if desired. If I pass to the physical order, for
</p>
<p>example, may I not say to you, this man has serious
</p>
<p>and long features, a black and almond-shaped eye,
</p>
<p>rugged brows, a sad and changeable mouth, tawny,
</p>
<p>meagre, and wrinkled cheeks ; his head is shaved, and
</p>
<p>he covers it with a black handkerchief in the form of a
</p>
<p>turban ; he passes a whole day lying or standing under
</p>
<p>a burning sun, without motion, without utterance, smok-
</p>
<p>ing a pipe that intoxicates him. Is this a Turk or
</p>
<p>a Spaniard ? Are you content, gentlemen ? Truly, it
</p>
<p>would seem so ; you laugh, and what do you laugh at ?
</p>
<p>I, who have 'presented this idea to you, I have not
</p>
<p>laughed ; see, my countenance is sad. Ah 1 perhaps it
</p>
<p>is because the gloomy prisoner has suddenly become a

<p>I told you I knew a priest who ordered the death of
</p>
<p>some heretics before saying mass, and who, furious at
</p>
<p>being interrupted at the altar during the holy sacrifice,
</p>
<p>cried to those who asked for his orders, ' Kill them
</p>
<p>all ! kill them all ! ' should you all laugh, gentlemen ?
</p>
<p>No, not all ! This gentleman here, for instance, would
</p>
<p>bite his lips and his beard. Oh ! it is true he might an-
</p>
<p>swer that he did wisely, and that they were wrong to
</p>
<p>interrupt his unsullied prayer. But if I added that he
</p>
<p>concealed himself for an hour behind the curtain of
</p>
<p>your tent, M. de Cinq-Mars, to listen while you talked,
</p>
<p>and that he came to betray you, and not for me, what
</p>
<p>would he say ? Now, gentlemen, are you content ?
</p>
<p>May I retire after this display ? "
</p>
<p>The prisoner had uttered this with the rapidity of a
</p>
<p>quack vending his wares, and in so loud a voice that
</p>
<p>Joseph was quite confounded. He indignantly arose at
</p>
<p>last, and addressing himself to Cinq-Mars, said,
</p>
<p>" How can you suffer a prisoner who ought to have
</p>
<p>been hanged to speak to you thus, sir ? "
</p>
<p>The Spaniard, without deigning to attend to him
</p>
<p>any farther, leaned towards D'Effiat, and whispered in
</p>
<p>his ear,
</p>
<p>" I can be of no farther use to you ; give me my
</p>
<p>liberty. I might ere this have taken it ; but I would
</p>
<p>not do so without your consent. Give it me, or have
</p>
<p>me killed."
</p>
<p>" Go, if you will ! " said Cinq-Mars to him. " I as-

</p>
<p>to retire with the soldier, whom he wished to keep in
</p>
<p>his service.
</p>
<p>This was the affair of a moment. There no longer
</p>
<p>remained any one in the tent but the two friends, the
</p>
<p>abashed Joseph and the Spaniard, when the latter, tak-
</p>
<p>ing off his hat, showed a French but savage countenance.
</p>
<p>He laughed, and seemed to respire more air into his
</p>
<p>broad chest.
</p>
<p>" Yes, I am a Frenchman," he said to Joseph. " But
</p>
<p>I hate France, because she gave birth to my father, who
</p>
<p>is a monster, and to me, who have become one, and who
</p>
<p>once struck him. I hate her inhabitants, because they
</p>
<p>have robbed me of my whole fortune at play, and be-
</p>
<p>cause I have robbed them and killed them. I have been
</p>
<p>two years in Spain in order to kill more Frenchmen ;
</p>
<p>but now I hate Spain still more. No one will know why.
</p>
<p>Adieu ! I must live henceforth without a nation ; all
</p>
<p>men are my enemies. Go on, Joseph, and you will
</p>
<p>soon be as good as I. Yes, you saw me once before,"
</p>
<p>continued he, violently, pushing him in the breast and
</p>
<p>throwing him down. " I am Jacques de Laubardemont,
</p>
<p>the son of your worthy friend."
</p>
<p>At these words, quickly leaving the tent, he disap-
</p>
<p>peared like an apparition. De Thou and the servants,
</p>
<p>who ran to the entrance, saw him with two bounds
</p>
<p>spring over a surprised and disarmed soldier, and run
</p>
<p>towards the mountains with the swiftness of a hart,
</p>
<p>despite various musket-shots. Joseph took advantage
</p>
<p>of the disorder to slip away, stammering a few words of
</p>
<p>politeness, and left the two friends laughing at his ad-

<p>at seeing the spectacles of their pedagogue fall off, and
</p>
<p>at last preparing to seek a rest of which they both stood
</p>
<p>in need, and which they soon found, the wounded man
</p>
<p>in his bed, and the young counsellor in his chair.
</p>
<p>As for the Capuchin, he walked towards his tent,
</p>
<p>meditating how he should turn all this so as to take the
</p>
<p>greatest possible revenge, when he met Laubardemont,
</p>
<p>dragging by her two hands the young mad-woman. They
</p>
<p>recounted to one another their mutual and horrible
</p>
<p>adventures.
</p>
<p>Joseph had no small pleasure in turning the poniard
</p>
<p>in the wound of his friend's heart, by telling him of the
</p>
<p>fate of his son.
</p>
<p>" You are not singularly happy in your family," he
</p>
<p>added. " I advise you to shut up your niece and hang
</p>
<p>your son, if you are fortunate enough to find him."
</p>
<p>Laubardemont replied with a hideous laugh,
</p>
<p>" As for this idiot here, I am going to give her to an
</p>
<p>ex-secret judge, at present a smuggler in the Pyrenees
</p>
<p>at Oleron. He can make what he pleases of her, a
</p>
<p>servant in his posada, for instance. I care not, so that
</p>
<p>my Lord never hears of her."
</p>
<p>Jeanne de Belfiel, her head hanging down, gave no
</p>
<p>sign of sensibility. Every glimmer of reason was extin-
</p>
<p>guished in her ; one word alone remained upon her lips,
</p>
<p>and this she continually pronounced.
</p>
<p>" The judge ! the judge ! the judge ! " she said mur-
</p>
<p>muringly, and was silent.
</p>
<p>The uncle and Joseph threw her, almost like a sack

<p>of corn, on one of the horses which were led up by two
</p>
<p>servants. Laubardemont mounted another, and prepared

<p>NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS.
</p>
<p>WHEN this work appeared for the first time, 1 it appeared
</p>
<p>without notes, simply as a work of art, as a summary of a
</p>
<p>century. That it might be rightly judged by the public,
</p>
<p>the author would not surround it in any way with the
</p>
<p>apparent eclat of historical research, with which it is too
</p>
<p>easy to decorate a new book. He wished not to show the
</p>
<p>true in detail, but the epic work, the composition with its
</p>
<p>tragedy, the scenes of which comprise all the eminent per-
</p>
<p>sonages of the time of Louis XIII. The author, however,
</p>
<p>soon found it necessary to indicate the principal sources of
</p>
<p>his labors ; and as he had ever desired to go back to the
</p>
<p>purest sources, that is to say, to the manuscripts, and in
</p>
<p>their default, to their contemporary impressions, he added
</p>
<p>the present documents to the second edition of " Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars," 2 to correct the erroneous ideas prevalent as to the
</p>
<p>authenticity of some facts. Subsequently, he returned to
</p>
<p>the simple and primitive unity of his work. But now
</p>
<p>again that his production has been multiplied in editions
</p>
<p>far more numerous than he could have expected, he is
</p>
<p>desirous that minds inquisitive as to the details of the
</p>
<p>vrai anecdotique, need not have to seek elsewhere for the
</p>
<p>documents.

<p>Father Joseph.
</p>
<p>" In his youth," says the historian of Father Joseph, " his hair and
</p>
<p>beard were of a somewhat fiery red. He perceived that Louis XIII.
</p>
<p>could not bear this color ; and he accordingly took pains to turn it
</p>
<p>brown, with combs of lead and steel, until he learned the secret of turn-
</p>
<p>ing it white, which was afterwards communicated to him by a quack
</p>
<p>doctor. The king's horror for red hair was so great that one day his
</p>
<p>first gentleman of the chamber (whose brother held the finest governor-
</p>
<p>ship in the kingdom) having the honor to accompany his Majesty to
</p>
<p>Foutainebleau on a hunting expedition, it rained so hard that it washed
</p>
<p>away all the paint with which he concealed the redness of his hair.
</p>
<p>The prince, perceiving it, was terrified, and said to him, ' Good God,
</p>
<p>what do I see ? never appear again before me ! ' The gentleman was
</p>
<p>obliged to resign his post."
</p>
<p>PAGE 104.
</p>
<p>" His confidant."
</p>
<p>The same historian says : %
</p>
<p>" This too celebrated Capuchin, whom one of his historians calls the
</p>
<p>assistant spirit of the cardinal, was not only his confidant, but that of
</p>
<p>the king himself. Inflexible, pliant, and base, he strengthened the
</p>
<p>steps of the minister in the path of blood, and assisted him to draw
</p>
<p>thither the feeble prince. The history of this man is known every-
</p>
<p>where. Here are the details of one of his tricks, which is little
</p>
<p>known :
</p>
<p>" Montmorency was taken at Casteluaudary. Louis XIII. hesitated
</p>
<p>to execute him. Monsieur, who had abandoned him on the field of
</p>
<p>battle, earnestly demanded his pardon. The cardinal desired his death,
</p>
<p>but did not know how to obtain this precious favor. Bouillon was
</p>
<p>charged with the negotiation. It was he who counselled Gastou. To
</p>
<p>him Joseph first addressed himself.
</p>
<p>" He got hold of him with the address of a serpent, and through him
</p>
<p>counselled Monsieur not to demand assurances from the king of the
</p>
<p>young duke's pardon, but to remit the affair entirely to Louis's good-

</p>
<p>ness alone, whose heart, he said, was afflicted by the appearance of a
</p>
<p>NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS. 229
</p>
<p>doubt on the subject. Monsieur thought he saw in this suggestion an
</p>
<p>intention to pardon, insinuated by his brother himself, and made his
</p>
<p>peace for himself alone, without stipulating anything for the young
</p>
<p>duke, and referring him to the king's clemency. It was then that,
</p>
<p>in a conseil ctroit of the king, the cardinal, and Joseph, the latter ven-
</p>
<p>tured to speak first, and playing off the energy of his political vocifera-
</p>
<p>tions with the phlegmatic arguments of the cardinal, forced from Louis
</p>
<p>the promise, too well kept, that he would be inflexible."
</p>
<p>Brulart de Leon, ambassador at Eatisbon with Joseph,
</p>
<p>says that the Capuchin had nothing Christian about him
</p>
<p>but the name, and sought only to deceive all the world.
</p>
<p>A work in 1635, entitled " La Verite Defendue," speaks
</p>
<p>of him in these terms :
</p>
<p>" He is the grand inquisitor of the State, interrogates alleged crimi-
</p>
<p>nals, throws them into prison without any charge, preventing their
</p>
<p>justification being heard, and by panic terrors draws out declarations
</p>
<p>which serve to hide the cardinal's injustice. He shamefully makes use
</p>
<p>of heaven for his earthly purposes, and of the name of God for decep-
</p>
<p>tions, and of religion for the knaveries of the State."
</p>
<p>He was of a very good family ; the name, J)u Tremblay.
</p>
<p>I refer to the published life of this unworthy monk those
</p>
<p>who would be better acquainted with him.
</p>
<p>PAGE 107.
</p>
<p>"The cardinal dictated to him those duties of a new
</p>
<p>kind," etc.
</p>
<p>The insolent commands of the ministerial religion, laid
</p>
<p>down by Eichelieu, are extracted from a manuscript men-
</p>
<p>tioned in the history of Father Joseph.
</p>
<p>This is what the reverend and ingenious historian and
</p>
<p>genealogist, the continuator of the Abbe Eichard, says on
</p>
<p>the subject :
</p>
<p>" He composed, with the cardinal, a book entitled, ' L'Unite du

</p>
<p>light at the time, but in the king's hands ; and it is this treatise which
</p>
<p>determined his Majesty to vest the entire government of his kingdom
</p>
<p>iu his Eminence. I have seen this manuscript in folio ; it is well
</p>
<p>written. It is not difficult to see that Father Joseph is the author of
</p>
<p>it by reading the principal propositions set forth there, first, as Chris-
</p>
<p>tian truths ; secondly, as political truths. This work might be entitled,
</p>
<p>' Testament politique du P. Joseph..' All the great men of the past

<p>" As for Marillac," etc.
</p>
<p>" The Marechal de Marillac was deprived of his legitimate judges,
</p>
<p>the members of the parliament, who in vain endeavored to take cogni-
</p>
<p>zance of the affair, and saw Mole, their attorney-general, silenced.
</p>
<p>Dragged from tribunal to tribunal, without finding one sufficiently clever
</p>
<p>to detect a crime in him, the Marechal de Marillac finally fell under the
</p>
<p>decree of commissioners, read by a keeper of the ecclesiastical seals
</p>
<p>(Chateauneuf), a dispensation from Rome being got for him expressly
</p>
<p>to enable him to condemn a man without reproach. The cardinal
</p>
<p>laughed at the spectacles he had forcibly put on the noses of the judges,
</p>
<p>as he phrased it. What confusion ! what a time ! We cannot throw
</p>
<p>too great a light upon the principal points of history, to extinguish the
</p>
<p>puerile regrets for the past in some minds which do not sufficiently

<p>three of his men. In this confusion, he was approached by a single
</p>
<p>cavalier, whom his men did not recognize in this confusion as an
</p>
<p>enemy, and who fired a pistol at him below the eye, which killed him
</p>
<p>upon the spot. This great prmce, having no other design than to serve
</p>
<p>his Majesty and his kingdom, and to stop the violence of him who seeks
</p>
<p>to undermine all who were above him, he, the cardinal, has thus extir-
</p>
<p>pated a royal branch of Bourbon, having had this prince marked and
</p>
<p>shot by one of his guards, who had placed himself, with this horrible
</p>
<p>design and by his command, among this prince's men, being recog-
</p>
<p>nized as sucli on being killed on the spot, as the villain was, by Rique-
</p>
<p>mont, esquire of the same defunct prince." J
</p>
<p>There exists, in the " Bibliotbeque de Paris," a curious
</p>
<p>autograph, which shows how much the cardinal relied on
</p>
<p>such expeditions. It runs thus :
</p>
<p>Letter of M. des Noyers to M. le Marechal de Chatillon, after the battle

<p>of Sedan.

<p>The king has resolved to give a government and a pension for life to

<p>the soldier who killed the enemy's general. M. le Marechal will send

<p>gant, did they consider that this man after the entire ac-
</p>
<p>complishment of his projects only succeeded in hastening
</p>
<p>and confirming the fall of the absolute monarchy which he
</p>
<p>thought he had confirmed forever.
</p>
<p>To place these documents properly before the reader, it
</p>
<p>is necessary to omit the long technicalities of the proces-
</p>
<p>verbal, the dryness and confusion of which have, no doubt,
</p>
<p>disgusted all those who have looked at it. But it is desir-
</p>
<p>able to extract the singular and vivid facts which are
</p>
<p>distinguishable in the chaos, when we look attentively
</p>
<p>at it.
</p>
<p>As soon as M. de Cinq-Mars is arrested, and the Due
</p>
<p>d'Orleans has excused himself in the letter we have cited
</p>
<p>in the course of this work, 1 the first anxiety of the cardinal
</p>
<p>is to know whether M. de Bouillon is arrested. In this
</p>
<p>doubt, and fearing the return of Louis XIII. to his affec-
</p>
<p>tion for Cinq-Mars, he stops at Tarascon, and thus seeks
</p>
<p>to satisfy himself that his influence is in the ascendant.
</p>
<p>Like a gladiator preparing for battle, he essays his arms
</p>
<p>and balances his club.
</p>
<p>Instructions after the arrest of M. le Grand to MM. de Chavigny and
</p>
<p>des Noyers, being with the king, to learn, among other things, from
</p>
<p>his Majesty if his Eminence shall act, as heretofore, as he shall
</p>
<p>think Jit.
</p>
<p>If M. de Bouillon is taken, it is necessary to show promptly that lie
</p>
<p>has been justly arrested. To do this, it must be found out who of the
</p>
<p>friends of Madame have taken part in the matter ; and in case the said
</p>
<p>lady will not afford information, you must devise some plan by which it
</p>
<p>may appear that you have a knowledge of the matter. Tor this pur-
</p>
<p>pose all the prisoners must be separated, and not be allowed to speak
</p>
<p>with any one. By this means you may make one believe that another
</p>
<p>has confessed all he knows, and thus induce each to confess, or at least
</p>
<p>to believe the matter confessed elsewhere.

</p>
<p>It must be represented to the king that it is important not to say he
</p>
<p>has burned all the papers ; and in fact it is generally believed that he
</p>
<p>has not done so.
</p>
<p>If M. de Bouillon is taken, Italy must be provided with a general of
</p>
<p>great fidelity for several pressing reasons. One is wanted in Guyenne,
</p>
<p>another in Roussillon, it being doubtful whether M. de Tureune will
</p>
<p>serve, or whether, indeed, he ought to be left there alone. The king
</p>
<p>can see to this if he pleases.
</p>
<p>We see the snare here indicated. M. de Cinq-Mars was
</p>
<p>the first to fall into it.
</p>
<p>The answer is not long delayed. M. de Bouillon has

<p>been arrested. The king has consented to tell all the lies
</p>
<p>dictated to him ; and as a proof of his obedience, he
</p>
<p>writes with his own hand the following letter :
</p>
<p>Letter from the King to his Eminence.
</p>
<p>I am always happy to see you. I am much better since yesterday ;
</p>
<p>and after the capture of M. de Bouillon, which is a great stroke, I
</p>
<p>hope with the aid of God that all will go well, and that he will grant
</p>
<p>me perfect health. It is what I pray of him with all my heart.
</p>
<p>Louis.
</p>
<p>With this gage he could act. He menaced Monsieur,
</p>
<p>and answered him vaguely. Gaston again supplicated.
</p>
<p>The same day he wrote to the king, to Cardinal Mazarin,
</p>
<p>to M. des Noyers, to M. de Chavigny, and a second time to
</p>
<p>the cardinal. Kernark that it was of the latter he had at
</p>
<p>first demanded pardon, the 17th of June, before supplicat-
</p>
<p>ing the king on the 25th, following the hierarchy estab-
</p>
<p>lished by the cardinal. He asks pardon from every one,
</p>
<p>and promises a full confession.
</p>
<p>Hereupon, the cardinal sets his foot upon the king's
</p>
<p>brother, and crushes him by the cold letter in which he
</p>
<p>counsels him to confess all, and which is in the text of this
</p>
<p>book.

</p>
<p>address the cardinal, whose creature he incessantly calls
</p>
<p>himself. Chavigny laughs at Monsieur and the cholera-
</p>
<p>morbus (already known, as we see) which had seized the
</p>
<p>agent of this prince from the fear of being arrested.
</p>
<p>He counsels Gaston to withdraw from France. We see
</p>
<p>that the king does not venture to answer until the cardinal
</p>
<p>has corrected the letter he is to write.
</p>
<p>M. de Chavigny to his Eminence.
</p>
<p>The king spoke yesterday to M. de la Riviere as well and as firmly
</p>
<p>as one could wish. I have made him write down and sign all he said
</p>
<p>to him on the part of Monsieur, as your Eminence will see by the copy
</p>
<p>I send you ; and when he raised some difficulties in obeying the com-
</p>
<p>mands of his Majesty, his Majesty spoke to him as a master, and he was
</p>
<p>in such fear of being arrested that he was seized nearly with a faint-
</p>
<p>ing fit, and then with a species of cholera-morbus, of which he was
</p>
<p>only cured by reassuring his mind. The king was delighted that Mon-
</p>
<p>seigneur had no intention of seeing Monsieur. In speaking to M.
</p>
<p>de la Riviere, I made him fall insensibly into the idea of proposing to
</p>
<p>Monsieur himself to confess all betimes in a letter to the king, so
</p>
<p>that he may, after having seen his Majesty, go for a while out of the
</p>
<p>kingdom with his Majesty's good favor and that of your Eminence.
</p>
<p>He told me that he would make this proposition to Mouseigneur,
</p>
<p>and that he would get his guarantee for the safety of Monsieur, if he
</p>
<p>would confess everything in writing and come to the king, and after-
</p>
<p>wards quit France.
</p>
<p>In this case your Eminence will be pleased to inform your creature if
</p>
<p>Venice would not be the best place to which Monsieur could go, and
</p>
<p>what sum you think he should have allowed him annually.
</p>
<p>I send Monseigneur the king's reply, to be put at the foot of La
</p>
<p>Riviere's declaration, that it may be corrected as it shall please you, and
</p>
<p>then be placed in his hands when he shall pass.

</p>
<p>Note to MM. de Chavigny and des Noyers.
</p>
<p>I have no difficulty, if the king thinks fit, in giving my word to
</p>
<p>.M. de la Riviere that if Monsieur will declare to the king all that he
</p>
<p>knows in writing, without reservations, and shall come to see his
</p>
<p>Majesty before leaving the kingdom, according to the proposition which
</p>
<p>the said Sieur de la Riviere made to us, his Majesty will let him depart
</p>
<p>freely, relieve him well, if he leave with the king's consent. Venice is
</p>
<p>a suitable residence, and in that case he will require the king's permis-
</p>
<p>sion to set forth, not to return to France until it shall please the king
</p>
<p>to permit and order it.
</p>
<p>As to money, I think that he ought to be contented with what the
</p>
<p>King of Spain was to have given him ; namely, ten thousand crowns
</p>
<p>a month. To give him more, were to give him the means of doing ill ;
</p>
<p>and it being impossible for the king to consent that he should take with
</p>
<p>him the evil spirits who have misled him, he needs no more for himself
</p>
<p>and well-intentioned people. However, if we must go so far as four
</p>
<p>hundred thousand livres, I think we must not be stopped by so small a
</p>
<p>difference. I am entirely the friend of those who love me as you do.
</p>
<p>THE CARDINAL DE RICHELIEU.
</p>
<p>TARASCON, this last June, 1042.
</p>
<p>Either M. de la Riviere comes with a mere mouth-complirnent and a
</p>
<p>confession of a disguised fault, or charged to discover a part of what
</p>
<p>has been done. If the former, the king ought to believe or feign to be-
</p>
<p>lieve what he says, and answer that he readily pardons Monsieur, and
</p>
<p>that M. de la Riviere may tell him all he has upon his conscience with-
</p>
<p>out being troubled about it.
</p>
<p>If the latter, he should still feign to believe that what he says is all
</p>
<p>there is to say, and answer, " What you have just confessed surprises
</p>
<p>me, yet does not surprise me.
</p>
<p>" It surprises me because I did not expect this new proof of want of
</p>
<p>affection in my brother. It does not surprise me, because M. le Grand,
</p>
<p>now he is taken, inquires very anxiously whether he is not charged
</p>
<p>with an understanding with Monsieur.
</p>
<p>" M. de la Riviere, I will speak to you frankly. Those who have

</p>
<p>given my brother these evil counsels must expect nothing from me but
</p>
<p>the rigor of justice. As to my brother, if he discovers to me, without
</p>
<p>reservation, all he has done, he will find the effects of my goodness, as
</p>
<p>he has already done various times already."
</p>
<p>236 NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS.
</p>
<p>Whatever entreaties La Riviere may employ to obtain a promise of
</p>
<p>general pardon, without obligation of confessing all that has passed,
</p>
<p>the king shall adhere to his last reply, telling him that he himself could
</p>
<p>hardly desire to counsel him to do more than God, who requires a true
</p>
<p>repentance and unfeigned gratitude before he pardons an offence ; that
</p>
<p>he ought to be satisfied with the assurance that Monsieur will find the
</p>
<p>effects of his goodness, if he behaves towards his Majesty as he ought
</p>
<p>to do, namely, as is above set forth.
</p>
<p>We see here that the parts are written out word for
</p>
<p>word, and that the king is neither to add nor take anything
</p>
<p>from them. The agent of Monsieur (La Kiviere) hastens
</p>
<p>to him, and the cardinal sends him to the king to dictate
</p>
<p>beforehand his reply. With what pliancy every personage
</p>
<p>obeys the director of this sanguinary play !
</p>
<p>The political observers do not sleep. They excite Louis
</p>
<p>XIII. by all possible means against the scapegoat upon
</p>
<p>whom every sin is to fall. The prisoner is treated with
</p>
<p>redoubled rigor.
</p>
<p>Des Noyers writes on the 30th of June, 1642, to the
</p>
<p>cardinal :
</p>
<p>" The king has told me that he thinks M. le Grand capable of turn-
</p>
<p>ing Huguenot. I added that he would have turned Turk, if by that
</p>
<p>means he could reign and deprive his Majesty of what God had so legit-
</p>
<p>imately given him. Upon which the king said to me, ' I believe it.'
</p>
<p>" His Majesty told me this morning that Treville had conversed with
</p>
<p>M. le Marquis on the arrival of M. le Grand at Montpellier, and that
</p>
<p>on entering the citadel he said, ' Ah ! must I then die at twenty-two ?
</p>
<p>Thus 't is to conspire against one's country so early,' which he received
</p>
<p>very well."
</p>
<p>M. des Noyers to his Eminence.
</p>
<p>PARIS, July 1.
</p>
<p>His Majesty is more than ever irritated against M. le Grand, for he
</p>
<p>has discovered that during his illness this wretch whom Monsieur the
</p>
<p>first president truly calls le perfide public, had said, speaking of the

<p>king, " He will still linger on."
</p>
<p>NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS. 237
</p>
<p>Nothing is omitted that can irritate Louis XIII., though
</p>
<p>it is difficult to appreciate the point of the first president's
</p>
<p>phrase.
</p>
<p>The same man (Des Noyers) again writes, on the 1st of
</p>
<p>July, 1642, from Pierrelate: "His Majesty continues to
</p>
<p>give the greatest demonstrations of love for Monseigneur,
</p>
<p>and of an equal hatred to this wretched perfide public."
</p>
<p>Thus the bulletin of the royal anger is sent to the car-
</p>
<p>dinal every hour, and care is taken that the fever shall not
</p>
<p>abate. The parents of the two young men wish to petition ;
</p>
<p>they are prevented. M. de Cuavigny writes, the 3d July,
</p>
<p>1642 : " The Abbe d'Effiat and the Abbe de Thou came to
</p>
<p>see the king, as we have been assured. His Majesty
</p>
<p>thought proper to send to them and command them to
</p>
<p>withdraw."
</p>
<p>The correspondence is urgent ; the next day (July 4,
</p>
<p>1642), the cardinal writes from Tarascon :
</p>
<p>" The most obscure enigmas begin to be explained, le perfide public
</p>
<p>confessing, in the place where he is, that he had ill designs against the
</p>
<p>person of M. le Cardinal, but none to which the king had not given his
</p>
<p>consent ; the mischief is that the liberty lie has hitherto enjoyed, of
</p>
<p>walking twice a day, has occasioned this statement to be much spread
</p>
<p>in the province, which may produce very ill effects."
</p>
<p>A mortal fear agitated the cardinal lest it should be dis-
</p>
<p>covered that the king had been concerned in the conspiracy ;
</p>
<p>he makes the imprisonment still more strict. He adds :
</p>
<p>" Seyton, the lieutenant of the Scottish guards, sixty-six years of
</p>
<p>age, allowed M. le Grand to walk twice a day. He did so up to within
</p>
<p>these three days, which gives me reason to suppose that the former
</p>
<p>orders have been lost.
</p>
<p>"M. de Bouillon required only a doctor and two valets-de-chambre ;
</p>
<p>le perfide public has six attendants, who must be reduced. Otherwise,
</p>
<p>it is impossible to prevent his making known whatever he pleases ; no

</p>
<p>" You will adroitly introduce this subject, without mentioning my name
</p>
<p>in any way."
</p>
<p>Impatiently awaiting a good commissioner, he says :
</p>
<p>" I expect M. de Chaze, whom we will try with M. de Thou. Make
</p>
<p>him hasten by the Rhone, for time presses, and it is necessary I should
</p>
<p>be here to assist him in his interrogations, which I will give him ready
</p>
<p>arranged."
</p>
<p>As it is necessary to envenom the wound in the royal
</p>
<p>heart, he does not forget a circumstance which may have
</p>
<p>this effect.
</p>
<p>" It were well that the faithful Marquis de Mortemar tell the king
</p>
<p>how le perfide public said that Fontrailles had jested upon his illness ;
</p>
<p>namely, ' He is not yet bad enough.'
</p>
<p>" This will tend to prove that the perfide and his principal confidants
</p>
<p>were ill intentioned against the king."
</p>
<p>We see that no light word or youthful thoughtlessness,
</p>
<p>real or supposed, is omitted by political cuiming. Cha-
</p>
<p>vigny immediately answers in the same spirit.
</p>
<p>" The faithful marquis has not yet had an opportunity of saying what
</p>
<p>M. le Cardinal has directed ; it will be done to-morrow. We shall see
</p>
<p>what the king will say."
</p>
<p>Then the next day, the same Chavigny writes in all
</p>
<p>haste :
</p>
<p>" Mortemar has told the king what M. le Grand said. The king did
</p>
<p>not fail, immediately upon hearing it, to repeat it to M. de Chavigny.
</p>
<p>[The same who thus sneers at Louis XIII. for his docility ! ] And
</p>
<p>I think he is the same with M. des Noyers.
</p>
<p>" The king expressly commanded me to mention it to your Eminence,
</p>
<p>and to say to you that he believes M. le Grand quite detestable enough
</p>
<p>to have entertained this horrible thought, and that he remembers he
</p>
<p>had at Lyons more than fifty gentlemen dependent on him.
</p>
<p>" Nothing has been omitted to keep his Majesty in a good humor.
</p>
<p>The king has several times repeated that M. le Grand is the greatest
</p>
<p>liar in the world. Thus we may hope that friendship is tolerably worn

</p>
<p>The 6th of January, 1642 (mark this rapidity), the two
</p>
<p>creatures of the cardinal-due, Chavigny and Des Noyers,
</p>
<p>inform him of the result of their insinuations.
</p>
<p>" We humbly entreat Moiiseigneur to tranquillize his mind, and to
</p>
<p>believe that he was never so powerful with the king as he is now ; that
</p>
<p>his presence will effect all he wishes."
</p>
<p>That same day the cardinal-due writes very humbly to
</p>
<p>the king, in the tone of an innocent victim and priest,
</p>
<p>whom the king is defending.
</p>
<p>His Eminence to the King.
</p>
<p>" I have learned," says he, " the new discovery which the king has
</p>
<p>been pleased to make of the evil design M. le Grand had against me,
</p>
<p>against a cardinal who for twenty-five years has, by the permission of
</p>
<p>God, successfully served his master ; the greater the malice of this
</p>
<p>wretch, the more the goodness of your Majesty is apparent.
</p>
<p>"This Seventh July, 1642."
</p>
<p>And on the 7th, he sends for M. de Thou into his cham-
</p>
<p>ber, bringing him from the prison of Tarascon. I have
</p>
<p>before me this curious interrogatory, and give it here, as it
</p>
<p>has been preserved, word for word. It is not superfluous
</p>
<p>to point out the tone of exquisite politeness of these two
</p>
<p>personages, neither of whom forgets the rank and char-
</p>
<p>acter of the other, and who seem to have constantly in

<p>their minds the old adage: "One gentleman is as good

<p>After which the cardinal made him sit down on a chair
</p>
<p>at his bedside.
</p>
<p>M. LE CARDINAL. Monsieur, I entreat you to tell me the origin of
</p>
<p>these things that have just taken place.
</p>
<p>M. DE THOU. Monseigneur, no oue can know it better than your
</p>
<p>Eminence.
</p>
<p>M. LE CARDINAL. I have no correspondence with Spain which
</p>
<p>might inform me.
</p>
<p>M. DE THOU. The king having ordered these things, Monseigneur,
</p>
<p>it cannot have been without your being made acquainted with it.
</p>
<p>M. LE CARDINAL. Did you wnte to Rome and Spain ?
</p>
<p>M. DE THOU. Yes, Monseigneur, by the king's order.
</p>
<p>M. LE CARDINAL. Are you, then, secretary of State ?
</p>
<p>M. DE THOU. No, Monseigneur ; but the king having ordered me,
</p>
<p>I could do no otherwise than obey.
</p>
<p>M. LE CARDINAL. Have you any power ?
</p>
<p>M. DE THOU. Yes, Monseigneur, the king's word, and an order
</p>
<p>in writing.
</p>
<p>M. LE CARDINAL. Yet M. de Cinq-Mars has not said anything
</p>
<p>about it.
</p>
<p>M. DE THOU. He was wrong then, Monseigneur, for he received
</p>
<p>the order as well as I.
</p>
<p>M. LE CARDINAL. Where are these orders ?
</p>
<p>M. DE THOU. They are in good hands, to be produced when they
</p>
<p>are needed.
</p>
<p>But this is what it is desirable to avoid. The cardinal
</p>
<p>does not wish to be assured thus that the king has given
</p>
<p>orders against him. He sends to Paris for commissioners,
</p>
<p>one especially whom he indicates, M. de Lamon, to assist
</p>
<p>M. de Chaze in the fresh interrogatories applied to this
</p>
<p>same De Thou, so imposing, so firm, so grave, so honorable,
</p>
<p>and so formidable by his virtue.
</p>
<p>While the young magistrate is replying thus, Gaston

</p>
<p>the fidelity I owe to Mouseigneur the King, and desiring to
</p>
<p>render myself worthy of grace and pardon, I sincerely
</p>
<p>confess everything of which I ani guilty."
</p>
<p>Then follow the accusations against M. le Grand, upon
</p>
<p>whom he very handsomely throws the whole affair.
</p>
<p>Then a second confession accompanies the first, relating
</p>
<p>to the other offence.

<p>Monsieur the King's brother to his Eminence.

<p>D'AiGUEPERCE, July 7, 1642.
</p>
<p>Gaston, etc. Unable to express sufficiently to my cousin, the Car-
</p>
<p>dinal de Richelieu, ray extreme grief at having entered into relations
</p>
<p>and correspondence with his enemies, I protest before God, and entreat
</p>
<p>M. le Cardinal to believe, that I never had any knowledge of anything
</p>
<p>that might affect your person, and that were I to die for it I would
</p>
<p>never have lent my ear or my heart to tlie slightest proposition against
</p>
<p>you, etc.
</p>
<p>The politeness of terror can assuredly go no farther or
</p>
<p>lower.
</p>
<p>He sends his orders what Monsieur is to say if he wishes
</p>
<p>to be allowed to remain in the kingdom and to have where-
</p>
<p>with to subsist.
</p>
<p>Monsieur and M. de Cinq-Mars shall be confronted with
</p>
<p>each other.
</p>
<p>Instructions of his Eminence.
</p>
<p>When M. le Grand shall be brought to the place in which Monsieur
</p>
<p>is, Monsieur must say to him,
</p>
<p>" M. le Grand, although our rank is different, we are in the same
</p>
<p>difficulty, and we must have recourse to the same remedy. I confess
</p>
<p>our fault, and entreat the king to pardon it."
</p>
<p>Either M. le Grand will take the same step, and agree with what
</p>
<p>Monsieur has said, or he will play the innocent, in which case Monsieur
</p>
<p>will say,
</p>
<p>" You spoke to me in such a place. You told me so and so. You

<p>ever else it may Lave been." Then Monsieur will relate the rest of the
</p>
<p>story.
</p>
<p>He will do the same when M. de Bouillon shall be brought on.
</p>
<p>He will content himself with the promise of remaining in the king-
</p>
<p>dom, without pretending to any charge or office.
</p>
<p>I say this, after having well considered the affair, which may be the
</p>
<p>most important of this nature that has ever happened in this kingdom.
</p>
<p>But Monsieur raises great difficulties in the way of con-
</p>
<p>fronting the accused. He is afraid of wanting assurance
</p>
<p>before them. The king cannot venture to compel his
</p>
<p>brother to appear ; but it is necessary to find a subterfuge.
</p>
<p>The Chancellor Seguier devises one and despatches it.
</p>
<p>" I have proposed to the king to send M. Talon, councillor of State
</p>
<p>and solicitor-general, Le Bret, and Du Bignou, who are all learned in
</p>
<p>criminal matters, to confer with me upon all the propositions I shall
</p>
<p>make to him.
</p>
<p>" Their opinion is that we can dispense Monsieur from being present
</p>
<p>at the reading of his declaration to the accused.
</p>
<p>" This opinion is supported by precedents and reasons. As to prece-
</p>
<p>dents, we have the trial of La Mole and Coconuas, who were accused of
</p>
<p>high treason. In that trial the declarations of the King of Navarre,
</p>
<p>and of the Due d'Alenpon, were received and read to the accused,
</p>
<p>without confrontation, although the prisoners demanded it.
</p>
<p>" The deposition of a witness with infallible presumptions serves as
</p>
<p>proof and conviction against a person accused of high treason, wliich is
</p>
<p>not the case with other crimes."
</p>
<p>We see that the chancellor goes to work here with good
</p>
<p>will.
</p>
<p>Then follows the opinion given by Jacques Talon and
</p>
<p>Hierosme Bignon and Omer Talon, deciding " that no son
</p>
<p>of France has been heard in any trial, and that the declara-
</p>
<p>tion of such suffices for proof without confrontation."
</p>
<p>The chancellor receives Monsieur's declaration in the

</p>
<p>de Paris, Champigni, Miraumesnil, de Chaze, and de Seve,
</p>
<p>in which the Due d'Orleans confesses to have given two
</p>
<p>signed blanks to Fontrailles to treat with the King of Spain,
</p>
<p>at the instigation of M. le Grand, whom lie charges also
</p>
<p>with having seduced M. de Bouillon.
</p>
<p>According to these opinions, the cardinal is armed on
</p>
<p>every side and sure of success. He may go. He arrives
</p>
<p>at Paris ; and while at Lyons they are trying Cinq-Mars
</p>
<p>and De Thou, he places his hand upon the king, and par-
</p>
<p>dons Monsieur on condition of his political nullity, and M.
</p>
<p>de Bouillon in exchange for his fortress of Sedan.
</p>
<p>The indictment is very curious, but too extensive to be
</p>
<p>inserted here. It is found at the end of the interrogations.
</p>
<p>The reporter there accuses M. de Cinq-Mars, after having
</p>
<p>passed lightly over Monsieur and the Due de Bouillon.
</p>
<p>" As to M. le Grand, he is accused not only of being an accomplice
</p>
<p>in tin's conspiracy, but also of being its author and promoter.
</p>
<p>" M. le Grand poisons the mind of Monsieur by imaginary fears in-
</p>
<p>vented by himself. That is a crime.
</p>
<p>"To relieve him from his terrors, he persuades him to make a party
</p>
<p>in the State. Here are two crimes.
</p>
<p>" He persuades him to combine with Spain. This is a third.
</p>
<p>" He persuades him to destroy M. le Cardinal, and drive him from af-
</p>
<p>fairs. This is a fourth.
</p>
<p>" He persuades him to make war with France during the siege of
</p>
<p>Perpignan, in order to interrupt the happiness of this State. This is a
</p>
<p>fifth.
</p>
<p>" He himself draws up the treaty of Spain. This is a sixth.
</p>
<p>" He brings Fontrailles to Monsieur to be sent about the treaty, and
</p>
<p>to Monsieur, the Comte d'Aubigny. These results may be looked upon
</p>
<p>as a seventh crime, or at least the accomplishment of all the rest.
</p>
<p>" All of them are crimes of high treason, he who attacks the persons
</p>
<p>of the king's ministers being reputed by the ancient laws and consti-
</p>
<p>tutions of the emperors equally guilty with those who attack the per-

<p>" A minister serves his prince and the State. A man deprives the
</p>
<p>prince and the State of him. This is the same as if they were to de-
</p>
<p>prive the f.rst of an arm, and the second of a part of its power."

</p>
<p>I refer these arguments to the reflections of jurisconsults.
</p>
<p>They may think, perhaps, that there might have been some-
</p>
<p>thing to say in reply to them, were it considered possible
</p>
<p>to answer these absurdities of uncontrolled power. The
</p>
<p>grand fact of the Spanish treaty sufficed ; and I only trans-
</p>
<p>cribe what the reporter adds, to show the animosity which
</p>
<p>was prescribed him towards the enemy, the rival for favor
</p>
<p>of the first minister. 1
</p>
<p>If M. de Cinq-Mars had been less ardent, less haughty,
</p>
<p>and more able, he ought not to have placed himself in the
</p>
<p>wrong by a treaty with foreigners. He might have over-
</p>
<p>thrown the old minister at less expense, and without at-
</p>
<p>taching to his brow the label, ally of the foreigner, always
</p>
<p>detested by monarchical or republican nations, alike that
</p>
<p>of the Constable de Bourbon and of Coriolanus. But he
</p>
<p>was twenty-two years old, and his head was not entirely
</p>
<p>applied to great affairs. He acted hastily, prompted by
</p>
<p>passion, against a man of experience, who knew how to
</p>
<p>wait coldly for circumstances which would place his en-
</p>
<p>emy in a false position.
</p>
<p>Upon the secret interrogatory.
</p>
<p>(Extracted from the Registers.)
</p>
<p>" M. de Cinq- Mars avowed to M. le Chancelier that the strongest
</p>
<p>passion which had led him to act as he did was the desire to drive
</p>
<p>M. le Cardinal from State affairs, against whom he had an aversion
</p>
<p>which he could neither overcome nor moderate.
</p>
<p>" He said that six things had given him this aversion :
</p>
<p>" 1. The first, that after the siege of Arras, at the close of which he
</p>
<p>had been present, M. le Cardinal had spoken of him as of a person who
</p>
<p>had not much courage.
</p>
<p>1 There are few words as involuntarily and crnelly comical as those
</p>
<p>which he so often repeats : " He persuaded him to," etc. Monsieur is thus
</p>
<p>represented as a schoolboy under the age of reason and not responsible,
</p>
<p>whom a tutor leads in some trifling errors. Preceptor of twenty-two I

<p>" 2. That after the alliance of M. le Marquis de Sourdis and his
</p>
<p>brother, the cardinal had said that M. de Sourdis had done honor to
</p>
<p>his family.
</p>
<p>" 3. That having desired to be created duke and peer, M. le Cardi-
</p>
<p>nal had persuaded the king from it.
</p>
<p>" 4. That he had felt himself obliged to protect M. 1'Archeveque de
</p>
<p>Bordeaux, whom he thought they desired to ruin.
</p>
<p>"5. That, speaking to him of the Princesse Marie, he said that his
</p>
<p>mother wished to marry him to her. His Eminence said that his mother,
</p>
<p>Madame d'Effiat, was mad, and that if the Princesse Marie entertained
</p>
<p>the idea, she was more mad still; that having been proposed as the
</p>
<p>wife of Monsieur, he (Cinq-Mars) would be vain and presumptuous to
</p>
<p>pretend to her ; that it would be ridiculous.
</p>
<p>" 6. That the cardinal had objected to the king admitting him to the
</p>
<p>council, and had him expelled from it."
