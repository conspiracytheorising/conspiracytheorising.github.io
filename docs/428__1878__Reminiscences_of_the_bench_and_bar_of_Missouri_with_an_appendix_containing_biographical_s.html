<p>INTRODUCTION,
</p>
<p>The fact that the territory of Louisiana, out of which the
</p>
<p>state of Missouri was carved, was once under the dominion
</p>
<p>of Spain, and subsequently under that of France, rendered
</p>
<p>it indispensable to professional success that the early law-
</p>
<p>yers should become familiar w ith the Spanish and Civil law,
</p>
<p>and a want of knowledge of either unfitted the claimant to
</p>
<p>legal honors to cope with those who had devoted years of
</p>
<p>laborious study to their acquirement; hence most of the
</p>
<p>lawyers who became permanent residents were not only
</p>
<p>well versed in both, but, b}' persistent effort to become so,
</p>
<p>formed habits of study and application which gave them
</p>
<p>well-deserved eminence in their profession.
</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of the author to furnish a complete
</p>
<p>biography of the members of the profession who contributed
</p>
<p>so much to frame and establish our local jurisprudence, but
</p>
<p>to give the reader a partial idea of the difficulties and priva-
</p>
<p>tions the}' encountered, and to preserve some recollection of
</p>
<p>their professional career, and some of the incidents and
</p>
<p>anecdotes connected with their professional lives, which
</p>
<p>ought not to be suffered to pass into oblivion.
</p>
<p>That law\'ers as a class have exerted a most salutary in-
</p>
<p>fluence upon the morals and liberties of mankind, from the
</p>
<p>beginning of the world, no one can question who is convers-
</p>
<p>ant whh ancient and UKjdcrn history.

</p>
<p>have accomplished in our Revolution without the aid of such
</p>
<p>VI INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>patriots as Adams, Otis, Ames, Hamilton, King, Marshall,
</p>
<p>Henry, Lee, Jefferson, Livingston, Rutledge, Pinckney,
</p>
<p>Clinton, Granger, Gallatin, and hundreds of others who be-
</p>
<p>longed to the legal profession? Not only did they kindle
</p>
<p>the fires of the Revolution by their fervid eloquence, but
</p>
<p>they tendered to their country their property and their lives.
</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence alone  one of the ablest
</p>
<p>state papers that ever emanated from human thought, and
</p>
<p>which was from the pen of a lawyer  did more than every-
</p>
<p>thing else to satisfy the civilized world of the justice of our
</p>
<p>cause, and to secure our recognition as an independent
</p>
<p>government. The fact is, the legal mind ever has been, and
</p>
<p>ever will be, arrayed on the side of order, good morals, and
</p>
<p>good government. A lawyer's experience in dealing with
</p>
<p>the affairs of men, his habits of thought, reading, and re-
</p>
<p>flection, all tend in that direction ; hence it is that he be-
</p>
<p>comes the recipient of the most responsible fiduciary trusts,
</p>
<p>and his influence for good is wide-spread and unlimited.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, he is allotted but a small space in bio-
</p>
<p>graphical literature.
</p>
<p>The territory of Upper Louisiana was noted for its able
</p>
<p>and profound lawyers, whose love of adventure, romance,
</p>
<p>and novelty directed their steps to the distant West, where
</p>
<p>they encountered all the hardships and privations usually
</p>
<p>attending border life. These pupils of Blackstone, Coke,
</p>
<p>and Littleton were not only lawyers, but soldiers and pa-
</p>
<p>triots, for upon every Indian outbreak they shouldered their
</p>
<p>muskets and offered their lives in defense of the women and
</p>
<p>children over whose heads the bloody tomahawk and scalp-
</p>
<p>ing-knife were raised. And yet the lives and good deeds of
</p>
<p>these noble men have almost passed out of memory ; it s
</p>
<p>even questionable if human hand can trace a dozen of the

<p>When \vc coninicaccd these Reminiscences we had wo

<p>idea of sketching the Hves of an\' but the earl\' judges and
</p>
<p>lawA'ers, but have since been persuaded l)\' iJioniinenl mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the profession, to whom we submitted a few pages of
</p>
<p>our manuscript, to embrace in the undertaking all of any
</p>
<p>note down to the i)resent time, including, however, only
</p>
<p>those who have passed away  our object being to deal

<p>advanced in years, retains in a remarkable degree his men-
</p>

</p>
<p>their time, or professional or judicial standing, but shall ad-
</p>
<p>here to our original design of furnishing mere scattering
</p>
<p>recollections and reminiscences. The names of some have
</p>
<p>been omitted, from the fact that it has been impossible to
</p>
<p>obtain any reliable information respecting their lives. Some
</p>
<p>died bachelors, leaving no one to inherit their name and no
</p>
<p>relative to furnish any of the events of their lives. Their
</p>
<p>omission is, therefore, a matter of necessity. In a few in-
</p>
<p>stances the omission has resulted from the apathy and indif-
</p>
<p>ference of those who promised, but failed, to impart the
</p>
<p>desired information. We spared no effort to obtain the nec-
</p>
<p>essary information respecting the lives of John Wilson, of
</p>
<p>Howard; Judge Leonard, of Buchanan; and Sinclair Kirt-
</p>
<p>ley, of Boone, all of whom stood high in the profession, but
</p>
<p>failed to elicit the knowledge necessary for a biographical
</p>
<p>sketch. Wilson and Kirtley moved to California and died
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>We take pleasure in acknowledging our obligations to
</p>
<p>many persons, both in and out of the profession, not only in
</p>
<p>Missouri, but in several other states, for valuable informa-
</p>
<p>tion contributed, without which our undertaking would have
</p>
<p>been very incomplete. We cannot mention them by name
</p>
<p>without being invidious, but one in particular cannot be
</p>
<p>passed over in silence. We allude to Levi Pettibone, of
</p>
<p>Louisiana, Pike County, a brother of Rufus Pettibone, who
</p>
<p>from 1823 to 1825, inclusive, was one of the judges of our
</p>
<p>Supreme Court. This venerable gentleman is now in the
</p>
<p>ninety-eighth year of his age, in fine health, and in full pos-
</p>
<p>session of his mental faculties. He settled in Pike County,
</p>
<p>Missouri, in 1 818, and for many years was clerk of the Cir-
</p>
<p>cuit Court, both under the territorial and state governments.
</p>
<p>We had the pleasure of meeting him in St. Louis in May

</p>
<p>except deafness in one ear and a sliijht inij)ainnenl of liis
</p>
<p>visit)!!. W'e h.ul previously received from him a most inter-
</p>
<p>esting letter, containing eight or ten pages of foolscap, all
</p>
<p>in his own handwriting, detailing many incidents in the
</p>
<p>lives of the early lawyers which could be obtained from no
</p>
<p>other source. He is a most remarkable instance of unim-
</p>
<p>paired longevity. Ma\' his life be spared to us many
</p>
<p>years to come.
</p>
<p>We do not expect that this work will escape the usual
</p>
<p>criticism ; but when it is understood that it has been written
</p>
<p>within the last eight months, and while the author was daily
</p>
<p>engaged in the discharge of his professional duties, and that
</p>
<p>it is the first undertaking of the kind in Missouri, we have
</p>
<p>a right to hope that it will be received by a generous public
</p>
<p>with that forbearance and indulgence which so difficult a
</p>
<p>task entitles it to.
</p>
<p>In the sketch of Colonel Easton, page 78, will be found
</p>
<p>in fac-simile a letter from Colonel Aaron Burr to Colonel
</p>
<p>Easton, written while Burr was engaged in the conspiracy
</p>
<p>for which he was tried in Richmond ; also a letter from
</p>
<p>President Jefferson, defining his policy respecting appoint-
</p>
<p>ments to office, and one from Gideon Granger, postmaster-
</p>
<p>general under Jefferson, having reference to the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>In the Appendix will be found some interesting and valu-
</p>
<p>able letters from General Washington, General Putnam,
</p>
<p>Granger, and others, none of which letters have ever be-
</p>
<p>fore been published. Those of Burr and Granger are very
</p>
<p>important, as throwing additional light upon the famous
</p>
<p>conspiracy.
</p>
<p>It seems strange that no one has heretofore made an
</p>
<p>effort to keep alive the memory of those early judges and

</p>
<p>THOMAS H. BENTON.
</p>
<p>When we commenced noting our recollections of the early-
</p>
<p>members of the Missouri bar, a difficulty suggested itself
</p>
<p>which seemed almost insurmountable ; and that was how, in
</p>
<p>a work of so small a compass as this, we could hope to give
</p>
<p>even a meager outline of the professional life and public
</p>
<p>services of so distinguished a man as Thomas Hart Benton 
</p>
<p>an undertaking which would fill a good-sized volume. The
</p>
<p>reader must, therefore, accept as an apology for the brevity
</p>
<p>of this sketch the fact that we have in no instance attempted
</p>
<p>to furnish a minute biography of any one, but simply scat-
</p>
<p>tering and disconnected reminiscences.
</p>
<p>The time for writing the life of Colonel Benton has not
</p>
<p>yet arrived, and will not for some years to come ; and it
</p>
<p>is to be hoped that it will tlicn l)e undertaken by one com-
</p>
<p>petent to do justice to the memory of one of the greatest of
</p>
<p>American statesmen.
</p>
<p>It seems as if every civilized nation has had an era of
</p>
<p>great men, which never rolls around oftener than once in a
</p>
<p>century or two. It is certain that since F'ox, Chatham, Pitt,
</p>
<p>Burke, Sheridan, and men of that stamp sat together in the
</p>
<p>British Parliament, there has been no period in English his-

<p>parison to them; and, if we are permitted to judge of the
</p>
<p>future by the past, it will require at least another century to
</p>
<p>brine about another such era of mind and intellect. It was
</p>
<p>the classic age of American eloquence. The fact that
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton practiced law in Tennessee before his advent
</p>
<p>into Missouri, and also practiced under our territorial gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, would make a work, even of as little pretensions as
</p>
<p>this, imperfect with his name omitted. He was born near
</p>
<p>Hillsborough, North Carolina, March 14, 1782. Under
</p>
<p>whose tuition he was first placed we are unable to state, but
</p>
<p>he entered a grammar school when very young, and com-
</p>
<p>pleted his education at Chapel Hill University. Various
</p>
<p>reasons have been assigned why he did not graduate, but the
</p>
<p>only plausible one is that the removal of his mother, who
</p>
<p>was a widow, to Tennessee while he was in college placed it
</p>
<p>out of her power to meet the expense of keeping him there.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he succeeded in obtaining a very liberal
</p>
<p>education.
</p>
<p>After the family moved into Tennessee he studied law, at
</p>
<p>the same time teaching school on Duck River, near the town
</p>
<p>of Franklin, and after his admission to the bar, in 1808,
</p>
<p>opened an office in Franklin. It is said by Foote, in his
</p>
<p>" Bench and Bar of the South and South-west," that he had
</p>
<p>his office in a small, one-story brick tenement, which is yet
</p>
<p>standing, and is pointed out to the passing traveler by the
</p>
<p>residents of Franklin. After practicing a short time in
</p>
<p>Franklin he moved to Nashville, and opened a law-office in
</p>
<p>that city. In 181 1 he was elected to the State Legislature,

<p>but, upon the breaking-out of the War of 1812, joined the
</p>
<p>army and became aid-de-camp to General Jackson, and
</p>
<p>continued with him until the unfortunate rencounter between

<p>them, in which his brother, Jesse, participated, aad which

<p>resulted in General Jackson receiving a pistol-shot wound.

</p>
<p>Colonel Benton then joined a Tennessee regiment, and was
</p>
<p>made its colonel, and afterwards served as lieutenant-colonel
</p>
<p>in the Thirty-ninth Infantrw
</p>
<p>In 1 813 he moved to Missouri and opened a law-office in
</p>
<p>St. Louis, at the same time writing for the press, and a part
</p>
<p>of the time conducting a Democratic journal called the Sf.
</p>
<p>Louis En(jiiirfr. At this time he was retainctl in several im-
</p>
<p>portant land suits, but he paid more attention to politics than
</p>
<p>the law. As carl}- as 1817 the people of Missouri began to
</p>
<p>think seriously of applying for admission into the Union, and
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton took a very active part in furtherance of that
</p>
<p>object. He wrote several vigorous articles in behalf of it, and
</p>
<p>also addressed the people in its favor. In 1820 a convention
</p>
<p>met and a constitution was framed, and under it a legislature
</p>
<p>convened and elected David Barton and Colonel Benton
</p>
<p>United States senators. Colonel Benton was too prominent
</p>
<p>a man to escape strong opposition, and he was elected by
</p>
<p>only one vote; Judge John B. C. Lucas, Judge John D. Cook,
</p>
<p>and others were opposing candidates. One of the members,
</p>
<p>who was sick at the time, was carried into the House on a
</p>
<p>cot to vote for Colonel Benton, and died a few da3's after-
</p>
<p>wards. David Barton met with no opposition. The state
</p>
<p>was not finally admitted until 1 821, but no question was
</p>
<p>raised as to the validity of the senatorial election. In another
</p>
<p>part of this work will be found the reasons for the delay.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton, by successive elections, continued in the
</p>
<p>Senate thirty years, being the longest period that any senator
</p>
<p>ever served.
</p>
<p>To form an\' adequate conception of the great mental
</p>
<p>power of Colonel Benton, the reader must be familiar with
</p>
<p>his senatorial career; for the history of tiiat portion of his
</p>
<p>public service is the history of our country for the same time,
</p>
<p>and no one can fully understand either without comprehend-
</p>
<p>ing both. That he was inferior to Mr. Webster as a close,

<p>logical reasoner; that he was not the equal of Mr. Cla\' as an
</p>
<p>orator; and that Mr. Calhoun surpassed him in the power and
</p>
<p>condensation of language, all must admit. But in depth of
</p>
<p>mind, originality of thought, and the power to conceive and
</p>
<p>4 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>execute any great measure of public welfare, he was the
</p>
<p>equal of either, and, in some respects, the superior of all ; for
</p>
<p>the dominant characteristics of all were, to a great extent,
</p>
<p>combined in him. He had Webster's great depth of brain,
</p>
<p>Clay's nerve and power of will, and Calhoun's great moral
</p>
<p>integrit}'. Mr. Webster was, to some extent, a timid poli-
</p>
<p>tician, and rarely disclosed his views upon any great question
</p>
<p>until he ascertained the drift of public opinion, and what the
</p>
<p>merchants of Boston thought of it. Both Clay and Webster
</p>
<p>were deficient in that great moral power exhibited in Calhoun
</p>
<p>and Benton, and Mr. Calhoun's sectional views impaired his
</p>
<p>usefulness as a statesman. Yet none of these defects could
</p>
<p>be attributed to Colonel Benton. He loved Missouri, but he
</p>
<p>loved his country more ; and, in determining the course to
</p>
<p>take with reference to any public measure, he endeavored to
</p>
<p>ascertain its probable effect upon the whole country. He
</p>
<p>was the senator of a nation, and not of a state. He never
</p>
<p>permitted any personal motive to interfere with his convic-
</p>
<p>tions of duty, and this trait in his character was well illus-
</p>
<p>trated in his refusal to support his son-in-law, General Fre-
</p>
<p>mont, for the presidency, though he had no particular admi-
</p>
<p>ration for Mr. Buchanan. We heard him on two occasions
</p>
<p>assign as a reason that Fremont was too sectional in his
</p>
<p>views, and he thought Buchanan better qualified for the
</p>
<p>place by reason of his long experience in public life.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton was not a man of policy, for, if he had
</p>
<p>been, he would have succeeded General Jackson in the presi-
</p>
<p>dency.
</p>
<p>When he declared war upon what was known as the Nulli-
</p>
<p>fication Resolutions of the Missouri Legislature, he might
</p>
<p>have readily crushed his enemies if he had been the least dis-
</p>
<p>posed to conciliate those who were halting between two
</p>
<p>opinions. Though it was well known that he was opposed to
</p>
<p>the " Wilmot Proviso," yet, when Colonel Ferdinand Ken-

</p>
<p>nett, an influential member of the Democratic party, and
</p>
<p>friendly to his reelection, sent a slip of paper to the stand,
</p>
<p>from which Colonel Benton was speaking in the rotunda,
</p>
<p>of the court-house at St. Louis, requesting him to give pub-
</p>
<p>THOMAS II. BENTON. 5
</p>
<p>licity to his views on the proviso, he indifjnantly cast the
</p>
<p>paper from him, regarding tlie request as an act of hostiht)' ;
</p>
<p>and thus made an eneni)' of one who had always been his
</p>
<p>friend. Many such instances occurred all over the state, and
</p>
<p>it resulted in building up an opposition to him in his own
</p>
<p>party which he was powerless to resist.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton was one of the purest statesmen that our
</p>
<p>country has produced. As the right-bower of General Jack-
</p>
<p>son's adniiiiistration, he could control most any appointment
</p>
<p>within the gift of the president; )'et he would never permit
</p>
<p>an\' person connected with him b)- blood or marriage to ac-
</p>
<p>cept an\' moneyed appointment under the government, nor
</p>
<p>would he {axox an\' applicant for a government contract,
</p>
<p>though a political friend. Such purity in a public man is
</p>
<p>almost without a parallel.
</p>
<p>What a contrast to the course of President Grant, who
</p>
<p>fastened upon the treasury every relation, by marriage or
</p>
<p>otherwise, to the four hundred and forty-fourth cousin.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton's official position placed it in his power to
</p>
<p>amass any amount of wealth ; )'et he died poor. His success
</p>
<p>in public life was the result of brain-power, combined with an
</p>
<p>indomitable will and untiring energy. Whatever he under-
</p>
<p>took he would accomplish, if it took a life-time.
</p>
<p>When the resolution denouncing General Jackson for
</p>
<p>usurpation of power passed the Senate, he rose from his seat
</p>
<p>and gave notice that at an early day he would introduce a
</p>
<p>proposition to expunge it from the journal, and accordingly
</p>
<p>did so ; but at the time he was almost alone in its support,
</p>
<p>which gave rise to those memorable words :
</p>
<p>"Solitary and alone I set tliis liall in motion."
</p>
<p>Even the friends of General Jackson at first opposed it,
</p>
<p>upon the ground that it involved a desecration of the Senate
</p>
<p>record, and would furnish a bad precedent ; but Benton re-
</p>
<p>newed his resolution at every session, each time sending to

<p>the country an able speech in its behalf, and at each session
</p>
<p>it acquired additional strength, until finally it passed, and the
</p>
<p>6 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURT.
</p>
<p>obnoxious resolution was expunged by the secretary drawing
</p>
<p>black lines around it, and by writing across it in the presence
</p>
<p>of the Senate the words, " Expunged by order of the Sen-
</p>
<p>ate." The reader of American history will notice with what
</p>
<p>violence General Jackson was assailed for his veto of the bill
</p>
<p>to revive the charter of the old United States Bank. Colonel
</p>
<p>Benton had long been satisfied that the bank was exerting a
</p>
<p>deleterious influence upon the politics of the country ; that
</p>
<p>by flooding the states with its paper, thereby encouraging
</p>
<p>wild and extravagant speculation, and then suddenly cur-
</p>
<p>tailing its circulation, it could produce at will a money panic
</p>
<p>or crisis, which would enable it to control the elections ; that
</p>
<p>by loaning money to members of Congress, and others in
</p>
<p>authority, it would be able to direct legislation  in fine, that
</p>
<p>it was an institution dangerous to the liberties of the people,
</p>
<p>and not authorized by the Federal Constitution. He there-
</p>
<p>fore determined to oppose the renewal of the charter, and,
</p>
<p>as General Jackson concurred with him in opinion, a deter-
</p>
<p>mined opposition was then and there inaugurated, and Col-
</p>
<p>onel Benton brought the whole force of his intellect to defeat
</p>
<p>the bill ; but it passed Congress, and was vetoed by the
</p>
<p>president. This was followed by the inflammatory speeches
</p>
<p>of Clay, Webster, ct al., and the country was soon brought
</p>
<p>to the verge of bankruptcy; but Benton had his grip upon
</p>
<p>the throat of the monster, and never relaxed it until he
</p>
<p>heard its last dying groan. Nearly a half-century has since
</p>
<p>passed, and time has proved the wisdom of the Democratic
</p>
<p>party in its opposition to that great political and financial
</p>
<p>operator.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton was a hard-money man, and hence obtained
</p>
<p>the sobriquet of " Old Bullion." He reposed no confidence
</p>
<p>in banks, except those of mere deposit and exchange, and
</p>
<p>regarded paper money as of no intrinsic value, and thought
</p>
<p>gold and silver should be the basis of all values. He never

<p>changed his views upon this subject, and, if we mistake not,
</p>
<p>the judgment of mankind now is that it would be a public

<p>and national blessing if every bank in the country was buried

</p>
<p>W'c have (^ftcn been interrogated as to the secret of Col-
</p>
<p>onel l^enton's popularit\- with the people of Missouri; for it
</p>
<p>was well know n that near the exj)iration of his senatorial term
</p>
<p>\\'.'< 1 )emocratic candidate for the Legislature could he elected
</p>
<p>without a [)ledge to vote for his reelection. This pledge was
</p>
<p>exacted upon all occasions, ami a refusal to give it was death
</p>
<p>to the aspirant for legislative honors. There was no personal
</p>
<p>magnetism in Colonel Benton, for he was austere, reserved,
</p>
<p>and distant, and seldom mixed with the people ; and was only
</p>
<p>known b\' his public acts and his devotion to the interests of
</p>
<p>his constituents. His popularity proceeded from his zeal
</p>
<p>and activity in originating and carrying measures calculated
</p>
<p>to promote the welfare and interests of the immigrant and
</p>
<p>settler. He at an early period took the ground that the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment slundd ne\er depend upon the sale of the public
</p>
<p>domain as a source of revenue, but that the true policy was
</p>
<p>to aid and encourage immigration, by reducing the price of
</p>
<p>the public lands ; and, as most of the immigrants were poor,
</p>
<p>to give them ample time to pay for their homes. With this
</p>
<p>motive, he introduced a bill to reduce the price to Si. 25 per
</p>
<p>acre, and upon certain conditions to give them preemption
</p>
<p>and settlement rights; so that they could pay for their farms
</p>
<p>out of the proceeds of their labor. The eastern states opposed
</p>
<p>this policy, as tending to deprive them of a part of their pro-
</p>
<p>ductive population; but he succeeded in his efforts, and the
</p>
<p>people of the West felt grateful to him for his services in
</p>
<p>their behalf.
</p>
<p>Upon the subject of the tariff, he opposed high duties upon
</p>
<p> such articles as entered into the necessaries of life. F'or
</p>
<p>instance, he succeeded in procuring the repeal of the duty on
</p>
<p>salt, an article indispensable to the farmer, and for which,
</p>
<p>when transportation was dear, he necessarily paid a high price.
</p>
<p>The fact was that the laboring, mechanical, and agricultural
</p>
<p>interests never escaped his vigilant attention, and his true de-

</p>
<p>votion to the welfare of his constituents placed them under a
</p>
<p>heavy obligation to him.
</p>
<p>As an evidence of his great probit)- of character and high
</p>
<p>8 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>sense of honor and dut\', it is only necessary to refer to his
</p>
<p>course in the Senate with reference to the boundary ques-
</p>
<p>tion between the United States and Great Britain. The
</p>
<p>reckless course of a few politicians had almost committed the
</p>
<p>Democratic party and the country to the claim of what was
</p>
<p>known as 54 40', when we had no earthly right north of
</p>
<p>49. They had succeeded in raising the cry of 54 40' or
</p>
<p>fight, and but for the bold stand taken by Colonel Benton
</p>
<p>and a few others, would have plunged us into a most dis-
</p>
<p>graceful war with the British government. Colonel Benton
</p>
<p>threw himself into the breach, and opened the eyes of the
</p>
<p>American people to the folly of attempting to despoil a
</p>
<p>friendly power of a portion of her territory. It was a noble
</p>
<p>act, for which the American people never can be too grate-
</p>
<p>ful. And here permit us to say, if there is any nation in the
</p>
<p>world that can afford to be just and right towards all others,
</p>
<p>it is our own ; and he who attempts to place us in a false
</p>
<p>attitude is an enemy to free government.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton seldom traveled, except in going to and
</p>
<p>returning from Washington ; yet no living man better under-
</p>
<p>stood the topography, climate, and resources of the country
</p>
<p>from the Lakes to the Gulf, and from the Atlantic to the
</p>
<p>Pacific ; and often in the senatorial debates, particularly in
</p>
<p>reference to the organization of territorial governments, he
</p>
<p>was appealed to for information which no other senator
</p>
<p>could give. The fact was, he had for many years made it a
</p>
<p>point to invite to his house western adventurers, and even
</p>
<p>chiefs of Indian tribes, that he might exact from them all the
</p>
<p>knowledge they were capable of imparting. Upon one
</p>
<p>occasion we called to see him when he was visiting the late
</p>
<p>Colonel Brant in St. Louis, and found him closeted with the
</p>
<p>celebrated Kit Carson, who, in the midst of maps and charts,
</p>
<p>was explaining to him the character and location of what he
</p>
<p>considered the most desirable route between Independence

<p>and Santa Fe. Upon another occasion he introduced to us
</p>
<p>Collins, the great explorer and guide of the Indian country,
</p>
<p>whom he had invited to his house in Washington, and during
</p>

</p>
<p>an hour we spent with them the subject of conversation was
</p>
<p>confined to the topograph}- and character of the plains and
</p>
<p>Pacific slope.
</p>
<p>It is not strange, therefore, that a man of his retentive
</p>
<p>memory should show even a greater familiarity with the
</p>
<p>western wilds and savage tribes than many who had spent
</p>
<p>years in their midst.
</p>
<p>We have spoken of Colonel Benton as an austere man,
</p>
<p>but at his home and at his table he was one of the most
</p>
<p>interesting men we ever saw. He would frequently invite
</p>
<p>a few friends to dine with him, and upon such occasions
</p>
<p>he was the life and spirit of the party. We recollect receiv-
</p>
<p>ing a note from him one morning, in Washington City, stat-
</p>
<p>ing that Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Ritchie, of the old Rich-
</p>
<p>unvid Enquirer, would dine with him on that da\% and he
</p>
<p>would be pleased to have us present. After reaching his
</p>
<p>house he told us, aside, that he should place Mr. Buchanan
</p>
<p>and Mr. Ritchie opposite to each other at the table, and we
</p>
<p>might look for some fine specimens of wit and repartee
</p>
<p>between them  one of which we enjoyed hugely. After
</p>
<p>imbibing the usual allowance of champagne, old sherry, and
</p>
<p>hock, the scene opened by a thrust at Ritchie from Buchanan,
</p>
<p>which we here give : " Now," said Mr. Buchanan, "Father
</p>
<p>Ritchie, tell us what sudden impulse came over you to make
</p>
<p>you change your views upon the Sub-treasury Bill." " The
</p>
<p>same," said Mr. Ritchie, " that caused you, mi}' dear Buck,
</p>
<p>to declare in a public speech, when a }'oung man, that if
</p>
<p>you had a drop of Democratic blood in your veins, you
</p>
<p>would take a knife and let it out."
</p>
<p>To the reader who may not be posted as to the political
</p>
<p>life of either of the distinguished gentlemen, it ma}^ be
</p>
<p>proper to state that, in early life, Mr. Buchanan belonged to
</p>
<p>the old Federal party, and, like all }^oung politicians, was
</p>
<p>very zealous and ardent, and used the above expression in one

</p>
<p>of his public harangues; and the occasion of Mr. Buchanan's
</p>
<p>inquiry grew out of the fact that, during the administration
</p>
<p>of Mr. Van Buren, and while the Sub-treasury Bill was pend-
</p>
<p>ing in Congress, Mr. Ritchie made in his paper a most

<p>10 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOCBI.
</p>
<p>violent attack upon it, but, soon after it became a law,
</p>
<p>admitted his error, and supported it warml}'. Other passes
</p>
<p>between them relating to their little foibles and inconsist-
</p>
<p>encies took place, much to the amusement of all.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton was very temperate in his habits, and it
</p>
<p>was only on occasions like this that he ever indulged even
</p>
<p>in a glass of wine; but he was always fond of dining with
</p>
<p>a few friends, and it was the only kind of entertainment for
</p>
<p>which he manifested any decided inclination. In Washington
</p>
<p>City these dinner-parties were of daily occurrence, and might
</p>
<p>properly be called intellectual feasts, for they were often the
</p>
<p>occasion of fine specimens of wit and repartee. Shortly
</p>
<p>after General Scott's defeat for the presidency, he and Mr.
</p>
<p>Webster dined out with a friend, and several ladies graced
</p>
<p>the table. While they were all partaking of soup, Mr.
</p>
<p>Webster turned suddenly upon Scott and said, " Scott, I
</p>
<p>am suprised to see you eating soup, since that hasty plate of
</p>
<p>yours played the devil with us in 1840."
</p>
<p>A private dinner-party is privileged, and whatever there
</p>
<p>transpires is never expected to be given to the public ; and
</p>
<p>from that very fact a great latitude is given  more par-
</p>
<p>ticularly as many things are said under the influence of wine
</p>
<p>which would be indecorous and improper upon almost any
</p>
<p>other occasion.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton had the reputation of being a duelist,
</p>
<p>caused, no doubt, by his killing Charles Lucas, son of Judge
</p>
<p>J. B. C. Lucas, and brother of the late James Lucas, in a
</p>
<p>duel on Bloody Island, opposite St. Louis, on September
</p>
<p>27, 1817. The difficulty grew out of political excitement
</p>
<p>and controversy. It is no part of our province to determine
</p>

<p>the parties for some time, for at the August election Mr.
</p>
<p>Lucas challenged the vote of Colonel Benton, alleging in the
</p>
<p>presence of the judges that he had not the necessary prop-
</p>
<p>erty qualification which, under the law then existing, was
</p>
<p>THOMAS H. BENTON. I I
</p>
<p>required of electors. Benton stated that he owned slaves
</p>
<p>paid a tax upon them, and \\as qualified ; and concluded
</p>
<p>b}' calling Lucas an insolent puppy. Mr. Lucas thereupon
</p>
<p>challenged him, and they met on Bloody Island on August
</p>
<p>12, 1817; Luke E. Lawless being the second of Colonel
</p>
<p>Benton, and Joshua Barton of Mr. Lucas. But one fire took
</p>
<p>place, Lucas receiving a pistol-shot in the neck, and Benton
</p>
<p>one a little below the right knee. Mr. Lucas bled so pro-
</p>
<p>fusely that he was unable to renew the combat, and it was
</p>
<p>postponed to a future time. This gave rise to various rumors
</p>
<p>disparaging to Benton, which he supposed originated with
</p>
<p>the friends of Lucas, and on September 23d following he
</p>
<p>addressed Mr. Lucas the following note :
</p>
<p>' ' St. Louis, September-, 2j, 18 ij.
</p>
<p>" Sir : When I. released you from your engagement to return to the island, I
</p>
<p>yielded to a feeling of generosity in my own bosom, and to a sentiment of defer-
</p>
<p>ence to the judgment of others. From the reports which now fill the country it
</p>
<p>would seem that yourself and some of your friends have placed my conduct to
</p>
<p>very different motives. The object of this is to bring these calumnies to an end,
</p>
<p>and to give you an opportunity of justifying the great expectation which has
</p>
<p>been excited. Colonel Lawless will receive your terms, and I expect your dis-
</p>
<p>tance not to exceed nine feet.
</p>
<p>" T. H. Benton.
</p>
<p>" Charles Lucas, Esq.''''
</p>
<p>Mr. Lucas had gone to Jackson, Cape Girardeau County,
</p>
<p>on a business trip, and did not receive this note until the
</p>
<p>26th, but on that day returned the following answer:
</p>
<p>" St. Louis, Septcnihcr 26, iSij.
</p>
<p>"Sir: I received your note of the 23d instant this morning, on my arrival
</p>
<p>from below. Although I am conscious that a respectable man in society cannot
</p>
<p>be found who will say he has heard any of these reports from me, and that I think
</p>
<p>it more probable they have been fabricated by your own friends than circulated
</p>
<p>by any who call themselves mine, yet, without even knowing what reports you
</p>
<p>have heard, I shall give you an opportunity of gratifying your wishes, and the

<p>wishes of your news-carrier. My friend, Mr. Barton, has full authority to act
</p>
<p>for me."
</p>
<p>"Charles Lucas.
</p>
<p>" r. H. Benton, Esq."
</p>
<p>The parties again met on the morning of the next day, on
</p>
<p>the same island, took positions at ten paces, both fired at the
</p>
<p>12 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>same time, and Mr. Lucas fell mortally wounded, and died
</p>
<p>within an hour. Colonel Benton approached Mr. Lucas and
</p>
<p>expressed his sorrow at what had happened, when Mr. Lucas
</p>
<p>said, " I forgive you ; " and gave him his hand.
</p>
<p>Had the friends of both exerted themselves to bring about
</p>
<p>an amicable settlement of the difficulty, it could no doubt
</p>
<p>have been accomplished ; but in those days dueling was very
</p>
<p>common, and seemed to be sanctioned by public opinion.
</p>
<p>\\\ fact, no public man could remain in the country if he failed
</p>
<p>to respond to a call emanating from one who was entitled to
</p>
<p>the appellation of a gentleman ; but that Colonel Benton was
</p>
<p>opposed in principle to dueling we know from what we have
</p>
<p>heard him say on that subject. Indeed, he exerted himself
</p>
<p>to prevent the meeting between Mr. Randolph and Mr. Clay,
</p>
<p>and, though present at the exchange of shots, refused to par-
</p>
<p>ticipate as second when asked to do so by Mr.' Randolph.
</p>
<p>The reader has no doubt already asked himself how two
</p>
<p>persons so far apart in years and position as Colonel Benton
</p>
<p>and the author should be on such friendly terms. Our reply
</p>
<p>is that, when a member of the General Assembly, and one of
</p>
<p>the youngest, we exerted ourselves to the utmost to secure
</p>
<p>his reelection to the Senate, and at a time when a part of
</p>
<p>his own party were conspiring to defeat him. Afterwards,
</p>
<p>when occupying a seat in Congress, we alone of the entire
</p>
<p>Missouri delegation adhered to him, and he manifested his
</p>
<p>gratitude by extending to us his confidence.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton never could stand, with any composure,
</p>
<p>an imposition of any kind, particularly if it involved, or had
</p>
<p>an}' reference to, a member of his own family. Upon one
</p>
<p>occasion a shrewd Yankee, while on a visit to Washington
</p>
<p>City, became somewhat reduced in his finances, and struck
</p>
<p>upon an odd and ingenious plan to replenish them. He
</p>
<p>learned that in some part of Maryland there was a horse
</p>
<p>that had a most remarkable coat of hair  long, shaggy, and
</p>

</p>
<p>bearing a striking resemblance to wool. He bought him,
</p>
<p>brought him to Washington, and exhibited him under a tent
</p>
<p>within two blocks of Colonel Benton's residence. Over the
</p>
<p>entrance was a large placard stating that the n'oolly horse
</p>
<p>THOMAS H. BENTON. I
</p>
<p>J
</p>
<p>therein exhibited was caught in a wild state, on the plains,
</p>
<p>by General Fremont, and was regarded by naturalists as the
</p>
<p>greatest living curiosity of the age. Admittance, 25 cents;
</p>
<p>children, half-price. Thousands called to see the woolly
</p>
<p>horse captured by General Fremont, and our enterprising
</p>
<p>Yankee began to think that he had struck a gold mine, when
</p>
<p>out came a card from Colonel Benton denouncing it as a
</p>
<p>gross imposition. This only increased the public curiosity
</p>
<p>to see the wonderful animal, and the tent was crowded from
</p>
<p>morning till night. The colonel could stand it no longer,
</p>
<p>and took a warrant out against him charging him with a
</p>
<p>criminal offense  had him arrested and thrown into jail,
</p>
<p>and thus put an end to the exhibition of the woolly horse.
</p>
<p>The Yankee certainly deserved some credit for his bold at-
</p>
<p>tempt to humbug the intelligence of the nation assembled
</p>
<p>at the capital.
</p>
<p>It has been truly said by some writer that the inside view
</p>
<p>of the character of a great man is never disclosed to the pub-
</p>
<p>lic until long after his death. This is certainly true of Colo-
</p>
<p>nel Benton. It was generally supposed that he had very
</p>
<p>little reverence for the Christian religion, but there never
</p>
<p>was the least foundation for such a charge. During his
</p>
<p>thirty years in the Senate he always had a pew in church 
</p>
<p>generally the Presbyterian  and attended the service very
</p>
<p>regularly, and required the same of his family. We are not
</p>
<p>posted as to his peculiar religious tenets, but his moral life,
</p>
<p>and entire freedom from vice of all kinds, furnish the best
</p>
<p>refutation of this charge. We have often heard him allude
</p>
<p>to his wonderful escape at the time of the bursting of the big
</p>
<p>gun on the steamer Princeton as a providential interposi-
</p>
<p>tion. We shall again allude to this in connection with
</p>
<p>another charge imputed to him, equally unfounded.
</p>
<p>He was undoubtedly a man of strong prejudices, and often

</p>
<p>very vindictive, which led him frequently to do great injus-
</p>
<p>tice to others ; but that he possessed a cold, unforgiving, and
</p>
<p>unrelenting heart is not true  and we could give many
</p>
<p>incidents that came under our personal observation to prove
</p>
<p>the contrary, but we prefer to let another speak of him in
</p>
<p>14 BENCH AND BAR OB MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>this respect, whose word and authority will carry conviction
</p>
<p>to the minds of all. We allude to Mr. Webster, who was his
</p>
<p>compeer in the Senate, always opposed to him politically,
</p>
<p>and between whom, until late in life, there was but little feel-
</p>
<p>ing of kindness or friendship. The extract we give is from
</p>
<p>a most interesting book recently published, and entitled
</p>
<p>" Peter Harvey's Reminiscences and Anecdotes of Daniel
</p>
<p>Webster." Mr. Harvey was through life a warm personal
</p>
<p>and confidential friend of Mr. Webster, and his reminis-
</p>
<p>cences are entitled to the highest credit. Mr. Harvey says
</p>
<p>that a year or two before Mr. Webster's death he related to
</p>
<p>him an incident which illustrated the great change that came
</p>
<p>over Mr. Benton at one period of his life. Mr. Benton car-
</p>
<p>ried his political and party prejudices to the extreme.
</p>
<p>" We had had," said Mr. Webster, " a great many political
</p>
<p>controversies ; we were hardly on bowing terms. For many
</p>
<p>years we had been members of the same body, and passed in
</p>
<p>and out at the same door, without even bowing to each other,
</p>
<p>and without the slightest mutual recognition ; and we never
</p>
<p>had any intercourse except such as was official, and where it
</p>
<p>could not be avoided. There was no social relation what-
</p>
<p>ever between us.
</p>
<p>"At the time of the terrible gun explosion on board the
</p>
<p>'Princeton,' during Mr. Tyler's administration, Mr. Benton
</p>
<p>was on board, and he related to me, with tears, this incident.
</p>
<p>He said he was standing near the gun, in the ver)' best posi-
</p>
<p>tion to see the experiment. The deck of the steamer was
</p>
<p>crowded, and, with the scramble for places to witness the
</p>
<p>discharge of the gun, his position was perhaps the most
</p>
<p>favorable on the deck. Suddenly he felt a hand laid upon
</p>
<p>his shoulder, and turned ; some one wished to speak to him,
</p>
<p>and he was elbowed out of his place and another person took
</p>
<p>it, very much to his annoyance. The person who took his
</p>
<p>place was ex-Governor Gilmer, of Virginia, then secretary of

</p>
<p>the navy. Just at that instant the gun was fired, and the
</p>
<p>explosion took place. Governor Gilmer was killed instantly.
</p>
<p>Mr. Upshur, then secretary of state, was also killed, as was
</p>
<p>one other man of considerable prominence. Colonel Ben-
</p>
<p>THOMAS II. BENTON. I 5
</p>
<p>ton, in relating this circumstance, said : ' It seemed to me,
</p>
<p>Mr. Webster, as if that touch on my shoulder was the hand
</p>
<p>of the Almighty stretched down there, drawing me away
</p>
<p>from what otherwise would have been instantaneous death.
</p>
<p>I was merely prostrated on the deck, and recovered in a very
</p>
<p>short time. That one circumstance has changed the whole
</p>
<p>current of my thoughts and life. I feel that I am a different
</p>
<p>man, and I want, in the first place, to be at peace with all
</p>
<p>those with whom I have been so sharply at variance ; and so
</p>
<p>I have come to you. Let us bury the hatchet, Mr. Webster.'
</p>
<p>' Nothing,' replied I, * could be more in accordance with my
</p>
<p>own feelings.' We shook hands and agreed to let the past
</p>
<p>be past, and from that time our intercourse was pleasant and
</p>
<p>cordial. After this time there was no person in the Senate
</p>
<p>of the United States of whom I would have asked a favor 
</p>
<p>any reasonable and proper thing  with more assurance of
</p>
<p>obtaining it than of Mr. Benton."
</p>
<p>In the year of 1847, J'Jst after the discovery of gold in Cali-
</p>
<p>fornia, and after Colonel Fremont had wrested the territory
</p>
<p>from Mexican rule, a great deal was said about the glory of
</p>
<p>his achievements. There was a great rush of settlers to the
</p>
<p>newly-acquired territory, and universal excitement about it.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton was in " high feather " at the success of his
</p>
<p>son-in-law. Colonel Fremont, and was full of the topic, talk-
</p>
<p>ing of nothing else. In almost every debate in the Senate
</p>
<p>he alluded to it. Colonel Fremont's name was in every-
</p>
<p>body's mouth, and his wonderful deeds were the subject of
</p>
<p>general laudation. Everybody who went to California sought
</p>
<p>Benton to get letters to Fremont, who was a sort of viceroy
</p>
<p>out there.
</p>
<p>One day after dinner, as Mr. Webster was seated in his
</p>
<p>librar}', the servant announced " Mr. Wilson, of St. Louis,"
</p>
<p>and John Wilson came into the library. Mr. Webster at
</p>
<p>once rose and greeted him. Narrating the visit to Mr. Har-

<p>vey, he said :
</p>
<p>" Mr. Wilson was a gentleman whom I had known more
</p>
<p>or less for a quarter of a century ; a lawyer of pretty exten-
</p>
<p>sive practice, and with a good deal of talent ; a man of very
</p>

</p>
<p>violent prejudices and temper, who had spent most of liis
</p>
<p>pubhc hfe, after he had reached manhood, in violent opposi-
</p>
<p>tion to Colonel Benton. It was not so much an opposition
</p>
<p>to Colonel Benton's Democracy as it was a personal feud 
</p>
<p>as bitter and malignant as any that ever existed between two
</p>
<p>men. It was notorious in St. Louis that when Colonel Ben-
</p>
<p>ton went on the stump John Wilson would always be there
</p>
<p>to meet him, and to abuse him in the most virulent terms, and
</p>
<p>that Mr. Benton would return the fire. I had not seen Wil-
</p>
<p>son for a good many years, and had only met him occasion-
</p>
<p>ally in court. He came to me now a broken man, prema-
</p>
<p>turely old, with a wrecked fortune ; and after some conversa-
</p>
<p>tion, he said :
</p>
<p>'"I am going to emigrate to California in my old age, Mr.
</p>
<p>Webster. I am poor; have a family; and although it mat-
</p>
<p>ters but little to me, for the short time that remains to me,
</p>
<p>if I am poor, yet there are those who are dear to me, whose
</p>
<p>condition I might improve by going to a new country and
</p>
<p>trying to mend my fortunes. My object in calling on you is
</p>
<p>to trouble you for a letter to some one in California; merely
</p>
<p>to say that you know me to be a respectable person, worthy
</p>
<p>of confidence.'
</p>
<p>" After expressing my regret that he should feel obliged
</p>
<p>to emigrate to such a distance  for then it looked like a
</p>
<p>formidable undertaking to go to California  I asked him
</p>
<p>if he was fully determined.
</p>
<p>"'Yes,' said he, 'I have made up my mind.'
</p>
<p>"Then I set about thinking what I could do for him. I
</p>
<p>saw no way to give him assistance. I had no particular in-
</p>
<p>fluence with the government at that time, and finally I said :
</p>
<p>" ' I am sorry, Mr. Wilson, to say that, so far as I am aware,
</p>
<p>there is not a human being in California that I know. If I
</p>
<p>were to undertake to give you a letter to any one in Cali-
</p>
<p>fornia, I should not know to whom to address it.'

<p>"'That makes no difference,' said he; 'everybody knows
</p>
<p>you, and a certificate that you know me will be the most val-
</p>
<p>uable testimonial I could have.'
</p>
<p>" ' I will write one with great pleasure, although you prob-
</p>
<p>THOMAS H. BENTON. 1/
</p>
<p>ably overrate the influence of my name in California. I
</p>
<p>want to do you a service. I want to give you something
</p>
<p>that will be of benefit to you. Let me see, Mr. Wilson;
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton almost owns California, and he could give
</p>
<p>you a letter to Fremont and others that would be of first-
</p>
<p>rate service to you.'
</p>
<p>" He looked me in the face, half astonished and half in-
</p>
<p>quiringly, as much as to say, ' Can it be possible that you are
</p>
<p>ignorant of the relations between Colonel Benton and my-
</p>
<p>self?'
</p>
<p>" I said, 'I understand what you mean; I am perfectly
</p>
<p>well aware of the past difficulties between you and Mr. Ben-
</p>
<p>ton, and the bitter personal hostility that has existed. But
</p>
<p>I want to say to you that a great change has come over Colo-
</p>
<p>nel Benton since you knew him. His feelings and senti-
</p>
<p>ments are softened. We are all getting older. Our fiery,
</p>
<p>hot blood is getting cooled and changed. It is hardly worth
</p>
<p>while for men, when they are getting up pretty near the
</p>
<p>maximum of human life, to indulge in these feelings of en-
</p>
<p>mity and ill-will. It is a thing that we ought to rid ourselves
</p>
<p>of. Colonel Benton and I have been engaged in a war of
</p>
<p>words, as you and he have ; and up to two or three years
</p>
<p>ago we went out of the same door for years without so much
</p>
<p>as saying ' Good-morning ' to one another. Now, I do not
</p>
<p>know a man in the Senate to whom I would go with more
</p>
<p>certainty of having a favor granted than to Colonel Benton.
</p>
<p>He feels that age is coming upon him, and he is reconciled
</p>
<p>to many of his bitterest opponents."
</p>
<p>" ' Is thy servant a dog,' replied Wilson, ' that he should
</p>
<p>do this thing ? I would not have a letter from him, I would
</p>
<p>not speak to him, I would not be beholden to him for a fa-
</p>
<p>vor  not to save the life of every member of my family!
</p>
<p>No, sir ! The thought of it makes me shudder. I feel indig-
</p>
<p>nant at the mention of it. /take a letter from Mr. Benton?

</p>
<p>"'Stop, stop!' said I; 'that is the old man speaking in

<p>you. That is not the spirit in which to indulge. I know
</p>
<p>how you feel.' And while he was raving, and protesting and

</p>
<p>1 8 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>declaring, by all the saints in the calendar, his purpose to ac-
</p>
<p>cept no favor from Colonel Benton, I turned round to my
</p>
<p>desk and addressed a note to Benton, something like this :
</p>
<p>" 'Dear Sir: I am well aware of the disputes, personal and political, which
</p>
<p>have taken place between yourself and the bearer of this note, Mr. John Wilson.
</p>
<p>But the old gentleman is now old and is going to California, and needs a letter
</p>
<p>of recommendation. I know nobody in California to whom I could address a
</p>
<p>letter that would be of any service to him. You know everybody, and a letter
</p>
<p>from you would do him a great deal of good. I have assured Mr. Wilson that
</p>
<p>it will give you more pleasure to forget what has passed between you and him,
</p>
<p>and to give him a letter that will do him good, than it will hin^ to receive it. I
</p>
<p>am going to persuade him to carry you this note, and I know you will be glad
</p>
<p>to see him.'
</p>
<p>*' Wilson got through protesting, and I read him the note ;
</p>
<p>then I said, ' I want you to carry it to Benton.'
</p>
<p>" ' I won't ! ' he replied.
</p>
<p>" I coaxed and scolded and reasoned, and brought every
</p>
<p>consideration  death, eternity, and everything else  to
</p>
<p>bear, but it seemed to be of no use. Said I, 'Wilson, you
</p>
<p>will regret it.'
</p>
<p>"After awhile he got a little softened, and some tears
</p>
<p>flowed, and at last I made him promise, rather reluctantly,
</p>
<p>that he would deliver the note at Colonel Benton's door, if
</p>
<p>he did not do any more. He told me afterwards that it was
</p>
<p>the bitterest pill he ever swallowed. Colonel Benton's house
</p>
<p>was not far from mine. Wilson took the note, and, as he
</p>
<p>afterwards told me, went up with trembling hands, put the
</p>
<p>note, with his own card, into the hand of the girl who came
</p>
<p>to the door, and ran away to his lodgings. He had been
</p>
<p>scarcely half an hour in his room, trembling to think what
</p>
<p>he had done, when a note came from Colonel Benton, saying
</p>
<p>he had received the card and note, and that Mrs. Benton and
</p>
<p>himself would have much pleasure in receiving Mr. Wilson
</p>
<p>at breakfast, at nine o'clock the next morning. They would

<p>wait breakfast for him, and no answer was expected.
</p>
<p>"'The idea!' said he to himself, 'that I am going to

<p>not taken it. It doesn't seem to me as if I could go and
</p>
<p>sit there at that table. I lay awake,' said he afterwards, to
</p>
<p>me, ' that night thinking of it, and in the morning I felt as a
</p>
<p>man might feel who had had sentence of death passed upon
</p>
<p>him, and was called by the turnkey to get up for his last
</p>
<p>breakfast. I rose, however, made my toilet, and, after hesi-
</p>
<p>tating a great deal, went to Colonel Benton's house. My
</p>
<p>hands trembled as I rang the bell. Instead of the servant,
</p>
<p>the colonel himself came to the door. He took me cordially
</p>
<p>by both hands, and said, " Wilson, I am delighted to see
</p>
<p>you ; this is the happiest meeting I have had for twenty
</p>
<p>years. Give me your hand. Webster has done the kindest
</p>
<p>thing he ever did in his life." Leading me directly to the
</p>
<p>dining-room, he presented me to Mrs. Benton, and then we
</p>
<p>sat down to breakfast. After inquiring kindly about my
</p>
<p>family, he said, "You and I, Wilson, have been quarreling
</p>
<p>on the stump for twenty- five years. We have been calling
</p>
<p>each other hard names, but really with no want of mutual
</p>
<p>respect and confidence. It has been a mere foolish political
</p>
<p>fight, and let's wipe it out of mind. Everything that I have
</p>
<p>said about you I ask your pardon for." We both cried a
</p>
<p>little, and I asked his pardon, and we were good friends. We
</p>
<p>talked over old matters, and spent the morning till twelve
</p>
<p>o'clock in pleasant conversation. Nothing was said of the
</p>
<p>letter until just as I was departing. He turned to his desk,
</p>
<p>and said, " I have prepared some letters for you to my son-
</p>
<p>in-law and other friends in California," and he handed out
</p>
<p>nine sheets of fools-cap.
</p>
<p>"'It was not a letter, but a ukase  a command to
</p>
<p>" every person to whom these presents shall come, greet-
</p>
<p>ing ; " it was to the effect that whoever received them must
</p>
<p>give special attention to the wants of his particular friend,

<p>Colonel John Wilson, of St. Louis. Everything was to give
</p>
<p>way to that. He put them into my hands, and I thanked
</p>
<p>him and left.' "
</p>
<p>Mr. Webster continued : " Colonel Benton afterwards came
</p>
<p>20 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>to me and said, ' Webster, that was the kindest thing you
</p>
<p>ever did. God bless you for sending John Wilson to me !
</p>
<p>That is one troublesome thing off my mind. That was kind,
</p>
<p>Webster. Let us get these things off our minds as fast as
</p>
<p>we can; we have not much longer to stay; we have got
</p>
<p>pretty near the end ; we want to go into the presence of our
</p>
<p>Maker with as little of enmity in our hearts as possible.' "
</p>
<p>No more faithful portraiture of the natural heart and im-
</p>
<p>pulses of Colonel Benton could be given than is furnished by
</p>
<p>this extract from Mr. Harvey's interesting work. There is,
</p>
<p>however, in it a mistake of fact, which needs correction. Mr.
</p>
<p>Wilson did not reside in St. Louis, but during most of his
</p>
<p>public life was a resident of central and north-western Mis-
</p>
<p>souri. Nor did he and Colonel Benton ever meet on the
</p>
<p>stump ; for it was an invariable rule with the latter never to
</p>
<p>engage with one in a political discussion. When he wished
</p>
<p>to address his constituents, he appointed a day and hour,
</p>
<p>and upon closing his speech left the room or ground. He
</p>
<p>said that such discussions were seldom carried on with any
</p>
<p>courtesy, and were, therefore, productive of no good. Colo-
</p>
<p>nel Benton did not live to witness the civil war, but he left
</p>
<p>upon record his belief that such a strife was almost inevita-
</p>
<p>ble  indeed, his prediction seems like inspiration.
</p>
<p>He devoted several years of the latter part of his life to
</p>
<p>the preparation of two valuable works : one entitled " A
</p>
<p>Thirty Years' View ; or. History of the Workings of the
</p>
<p>American Government from 1820 to 1850," in two volumes,
</p>
<p>octavo; the other, "An Abridgment of the Debates in Con-
</p>
<p>gress from the Foundation of the Government to 1856."
</p>
<p>These works are of inestimable value, and are becoming
</p>
<p>better appreciated every day; and in time will form a part
</p>
<p>of every well-selected library in the country.
</p>
<p>After he left the Senate the people of the St. Louis Dis-
</p>
<p>trict elected him to Congress; and in 1856 he announced

<p>himself a candidate for governor, and canvassed the state in
</p>
<p>opposition to what was termed the Nullification Resolutions
</p>
<p>of the previous General Assembly. He was defeated by
</p>
<p>Governor Polk, and after this took but little interest in pub-
</p>
<p>THOMAS H. BENTON. 21
</p>
<p>lie affairs, devoting himself to the preparation of the works
</p>
<p>he afterwards published.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton was by no means free from faults  the
</p>
<p>chief of which was egotism. He loved to speak of his own
</p>
<p>exploits. On the day he made his celebrated speech against
</p>
<p>the " Omnibus Territorial Bill," which, by way of derision,
</p>
<p>he compared to old Dr. Jacob Townsend's sarsaparilla, and
</p>
<p>in which he kept the Senate for hours in a roar of laughter
</p>
<p>at the expense of Mr. Clay, who had opposed the bills sepa-
</p>
<p>rately, and supported them when consolidated, we overtook
</p>
<p>him on Pennsylvania Avenue as he was returning home.
</p>
<p>The first question he asked was, if we heard his speech ; and,
</p>
<p>on receiving an affirmative answer, said, " Didn't I give Clay
</p>
<p>h  1?" and every few minutes repeated it with evident
</p>
<p>delight and satisfaction. But he was so exemplary a man in
</p>
<p>all his private relations, and had so few faults, that his
</p>
<p>friends were disposed to overlook this, prominent as it was.
</p>
<p>In his family he was kind and domestic. It is known that
</p>
<p>Mrs. Benton for many years was greatly afflicted with
</p>
<p>paralysis ; but to enable her to enjoy the society of her
</p>
<p>friends he would take her in his arms like a child, and carry
</p>
<p>her to the parlor, and back again to her room. We have
</p>
<p>seen him do this at least a dozen times. She was a sister of
</p>
<p>Governor McDowell, of Virginia ; and no wife ever received
</p>
<p>greater devotion from her husband than she received from
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton.
</p>
<p>He died in Wasiiington City, on April lO, 1858, from the
</p>
<p>effects of cancer in the stomach. His remains were brought
</p>
<p>to St. Louis, exhibited in state for several days, and then
</p>
<p>interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery. As the casket contain-
</p>
<p>ing the corpse was borne from the church, at least 40,000
</p>
<p>people were gazing at the solemn scene. All business
</p>
<p>houses were closed, public buildings draped in mourning,
</p>
<p>flags in the harbor trailing at half-mast, and a deep gloom

<p>settled over the great city of the West. It was evident that
</p>
<p>a mighty man had fallen.
</p>
<p>Alas ! when will Missouri have another Benton ?
</p>
<p>George shannon.
</p>
<p>This strange and eccentric lawyer was born in Penns}-!-
</p>
<p>vania, in 1787. He was of Irish descent. When a mere
</p>
<p>boy he joined the expedition of Lewis and Clark to the
</p>
<p>Rocky Mountains, and in an engagement with the Indians
</p>
<p>received a wound in the leg, and on his return down the Mis-
</p>
<p>souri River stopped at St. Charles and had the limb ampu-
</p>
<p>tated. He procured a wooden leg shaped at the end like a
</p>
<p>peg, and from that time bore the sobnqiict of " Peg-leg
</p>
<p>Shannon."
</p>
<p>Lewis and Clark took him to Philadelphia, where he su-
</p>
<p>perintended the publication of their journal. While there
</p>
<p>he studied law, and was admitted to the bar, and soon after-
</p>
<p>wards commenced the practice in Lexington, Kentucky. He
</p>
<p>was eventually appointed a circuit judge, which office he
</p>
<p>held for three years.
</p>
<p>It was in his court that young De Shea, a son of the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor of Kentucky, was convicted of murder in the first de-
</p>
<p>gree. Judge Shannon, for reasons satisfactory to himself,
</p>
<p>granted a new trial, which greatly incensed the people, who
</p>
<p>attributed his action to executive influence. This no doubt
</p>
<p>induced the judge to leave Kentuck}', for in 1828 he moved
</p>
<p>to Missouri and located at Hannibal, and afterwards settled
</p>
<p>permanently at St. Charles. For a short time he occupied
</p>
<p>a seat in the State Senate, and was also United States attor-
</p>
<p>ney for Missouri, and became a candidate for United States
</p>
<p>senator at the time Colonel Benton obtained his second
</p>
<p>election. Judge Shannon was a man of considerable abilit\',
</p>
<p>and somewhat distinguished as a criminal lawyer.
</p>
<p>He died very suddenly at the court-house in Palmyra,
</p>
<p>while defending a man indicted for murder. He was, at the
</p>
<p>time, in his forty-ninth year.

<p>He was very young when his father died, leaving his
</p>
<p>GEORGE SHANNON. 2 1
</p>
<p>mother with a large family of children to maintain  among
</p>
<p>them four or five sons, all of whom in after-life became dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished for their talents. His brother Wilson Shannon
</p>
<p>was at one time governor of Ohio, and, in 1844, minister to
</p>
<p>Mexico, under President Tyler. He also served in Congress,
</p>
<p>and was appointed governor of Kansas Territory, and when
</p>
<p>Kansas was admitted as a state the people elected him as
</p>
<p>their governor. He died in Kansas in 1877.
</p>
<p>Another brother, by the name of James, became a distin-
</p>
<p>guished lawyer, and practiced many years in Lexington,
</p>
<p>Kentucky. Judge Shannon was a strong and vigorous
</p>
<p>speaker, and was esteemed by the profession as one of the
</p>
<p>most effective jury lawyers in the state. His knowledge of
</p>
<p>men was very great, and before addressing a jury he studied
</p>
<p>the character of each juror, and adopted a line of argument
</p>
<p>calculated to win their support.
</p>
<p>The county of Shannon, in this state, was named after
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>During the latter part of his life he became very dissi-
</p>
<p>pated, and when under the influence of liquor was wild, and at
</p>
<p>times desperate. Putting up one night at a country tavern,
</p>
<p>he became greatly annoyed at the loud ticking of a Yankee
</p>
<p>clock which hung over the fire-place in his room ; and being
</p>
<p>in that nervous condition usually attending a spree, imagined
</p>
<p>that the noise was intended for his special benefit, and address-
</p>
<p>ing himself to the clock, said : " Sir, your conversation dis-
</p>
<p>turbs my rest ; be kind enough to suspend." The clock fail-
</p>
<p>ing to comply with his request, he again said : " Sir, this
</p>
<p>impertinence cannot be endured ; and unless you instantly
</p>
<p>cease I will blow you to h  1." But the clock was obstinate,
</p>
<p>and failed to heed the threat, whereupon he rose from his bed,
</p>
<p>and taking from his saddle-bags a large-bored pistol, sent a
</p>
<p>ball through the face of his disturber, shattering it into fifty
</p>
<p>pieces, and at the same time exclaiming, " Take that for your

<p>impertinence, you d  d Yankee son of a b  h." The next
</p>
<p>morning, upon ascertaining what he had done, he asked the
</p>
<p>landlord what he had paid for his clock, and, on receiving a
</p>
<p>reply, promptly handed over the amount.

</p>
<p>Upon another occasion, while at Jefferson City during a
</p>
<p>session of the Legislature, and stopping at the Stone Hotel,
</p>
<p>on the bank of the "river, he became incensed at one of his
</p>
<p>comrades, a senator, and getting the distinguished represen-
</p>
<p>tative in a condition which offered no resistance, he led him
</p>
<p>to the river, put him in a skiff, turned the boat loose, and the
</p>
<p>unconscious senator floated about fifteen miles below the
</p>
<p>capital and landed on a sand-bar, when he was rescued in an
</p>
<p>almost perished condition.
</p>
<p>At another time, at the same hotel, he was in a merry
</p>
<p>crowd, and one of them proposed to him that if either would
</p>
<p>do a particular act, and the other should fail to follow suit,
</p>
<p>the delinquent should treat the crowd. Thereupon Shannon
</p>
<p>took off his wooden leg and threw it into the fire ; and as the
</p>
<p>other was not disposed to thus jeopardize a sound limb, he

</p>
<p>was forced to foot the bill.
</p>
<p>Edward Hempstead.
</p>
<p>By act of Congress approved June 4, 181 3, the name of the
</p>
<p>territory of Louisiana was changed to that of the territory of
</p>
<p>Missouri, and at an election held on the second Monday in
</p>
<p>November of that year the subject of this sketch was elected
</p>
<p>as the first delegate to Congress from the territory.
</p>
<p>He was born in New London, Connecticut, on June 3, ,
</p>
<p>1770, over a century ago, and came to the territory of
</p>
<p>Louisiana as early as 1804, traveling all the way on horse-
</p>
<p>back.
</p>
<p>At that period the facilities for traveling were very lim-
</p>
<p>ited  indeed, almost confined to horseback. There were
</p>
<p>no steamboats plying the western waters, and no stage routes
</p>
<p>west of the Alleghany Mountains. It is true that now and
</p>
<p>then the traveler, after reaching the Ohio River, would take
</p>
<p>passage on a flat-boat, but as a general thing he relied upon
</p>
<p>his horse  traveling weeks and months without shelter, and
</p>
<p>exposed to all the dangers and privations that a new and
</p>
<p>almost unexplored region subjected him to. When night
</p>
<p>overtook him, his place of rest was upon the bare ground,
</p>
<p>with his blanket around him and his saddle for a pillow, first
</p>
<p>having hobbled his horse and turned him loose to graze upon
</p>
<p>the shrubs and grass. Such were the facilities offered Mr.
</p>
<p>Hempstead to reach the Father of Waters.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hempstead received a classical education, and was
</p>
<p>admitted to the bar in 1801 ; and after practicing three years
</p>
<p>in Rhode Island, came West, remaining a brief period in
</p>
<p>Vincennes, then in the territory of Indiana, and settled in
</p>
<p>the town of St. Charles, from whence he removed, in 1805,
</p>
<p>to St. Louis, where he resided till his death.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hempstead filled many public positions, with great
</p>
<p>credit to himself and to the entire satisfaction of the govern-

</p>
<p>ment. In 1806 he received the appointment of deputy attor-
</p>
<p>26 BENCH AXD BAR UF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>ney-general for the District of St. Louis and St. Charles, and
</p>
<p>in 1809 became attorney-general for the territory of Upper
</p>
<p>Louisiana, which office he filled till 181 1. He was also the
</p>
<p>first delegate to Congress from the western side of the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi River, and represented Missouri Territory from 181 1
</p>
<p>to 1 8 14, and afterwards became speaker of the Territorial
</p>
<p>Assembly. It will be thus seen that almost his entire profes-
</p>
<p>sional life was spent during the territorial government, having
</p>
<p>died four years prior to the admission of Missouri as a state.
</p>
<p>There are a few still living who remember him well, and who
</p>
<p>delight to dwell upon his virtues and his talents.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hempstead died in St. Louis in August, 18 17, and
</p>
<p>though it was seldom that an obituary notice appeared in the
</p>
<p>press, we find the following in the Missouri Gazette of August
</p>
<p>16, 1817 :
</p>
<p>"Died, on Saturday night last, of a sliort illness, Edward Hempstead, Esq.,
</p>
<p>counselor and attorney at law, and formerly a delegate from this territory to
</p>
<p>Congress. In the dear relation of husband, son, and brother, the deceased is
</p>
<p>believed to have fully acted up to his duty. The sorrow of his widow and rela-
</p>
<p>tions offered the most eloquent expression of his domestic worth. On Monday
</p>
<p>the, corpse of the deceased was attended to the place of interment (at the plan-
</p>
<p>tation of his father, Stephen Hempstead, Esq.) by a greater number of respect-
</p>
<p>able citizens than we have ever witnessed here on a similar occasion."
</p>
<p>As a lawyer, Mr. Hempstead was more profound than bril-
</p>
<p>liant, and no one at the bar excelled him in the knowledge of
</p>
<p>the laws and regulations of the territory. He made a good
</p>
<p>delegate in Congress, and served his constituents most faith-

<p>fully.
</p>
<p>GREER W. DAVIS.
</p>
<p>It is with great pleasure we are able to give even a brief
</p>
<p>sketch of the professional life of one who has just passed
</p>
<p>from our midst, and who was justly entitled to the appella-
</p>
<p>tion of " Father of the Missouri Bar ; " for he practiced law
</p>
<p>in Cape Girardeau County fifty-seven consecutive years, and
</p>
<p>at the time of his death was the oldest licensed lawyer, and
</p>
<p>the oldest practitioner, in the United States.
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis was born near Washington, Mason County,
</p>
<p>Kentuck}^ in January, 1799, and removed to Jackson, Cape
</p>
<p>Girardeau County, Missouri, in February, 18 18, where he read
</p>
<p>law one year under the tuition of Timothy Davis, and one
</p>
<p>year in the office of Alexander Buckner, who afterwards rep-
</p>
<p>resented Missouri in the United States Senate. His oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity for acquiring a knowledge of the law could not have
</p>
<p>been better, for both Davis and Buckner were accomplished
</p>
<p>attorneys in full practice. He obtained his license on Febru-
</p>
<p>ary 12, 1820, and immediately entered upon the practice in
</p>
<p>Jackson, where he resided until his recent death.
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis' education commenced in the common schools
</p>
<p>of the country, and he afterwards entered Washington Acad-
</p>
<p>emy, and finally Transylvania University ; but whether or
</p>
<p>not he graduated we are unable to say. During his first
</p>
<p>year's practice he was appointed circuit attorney for his cir-
</p>
<p>cuit, and afterwards elected by the people, and held the
</p>
<p>office over seventeen years  proving a most able prose-
</p>
<p>cutor and a faithful public servant. During the first two or
</p>
<p>three years of his practice he was regarded as rather a fast
</p>
<p>young man  not, strictly speaking, dissipated, but given to
</p>
<p>frolic and pleasure ; but soon after, he sowed his wild oats,
</p>
<p>and devoted himself exclusively to his profession. He was
</p>
<p>frequently solicted to become a candidate for office, and was

</p>
<p>tendered the judgeship of his circuit, but nothing could in-
</p>
<p>28 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>duce hiin to leave his practice; for he loved his profession,
</p>
<p>and soon took rank among the ablest of our lawyers. He
</p>
<p>was, however, for several years register of the land-office
</p>
<p>at Jackson, a position he accepted at the urgent solicitation
</p>
<p>of the Department at Washington.
</p>
<p>As a speaker he was fluent, logical, and impressive, never
</p>
<p>indulging in a superfluity of words, or lengthy harangue;
</p>
<p>and, like Mr. Calhoun, had the power of condensation in a
</p>
<p>remarkable degree  which always gave him strength before
</p>
<p>a court, and more than ordinary influence with a jury. In his
</p>
<p>argument he selected the strong points of his case, exhibited
</p>
<p>them in the strongest light, leaving the minor ones to take
</p>
<p>care of themselves. He never committed the error of impair-
</p>
<p>ing a strong point in the attempt to give an undue importance
</p>
<p>to a weak one. He was always a very successful lawyer, for,
</p>
<p>in addition to his thorough knowledge of the law, he carried
</p>
<p>with him the most exalted character for honesty and integ-
</p>
<p>rity ; for nothing did he despise more than trickery or low
</p>
<p>cunning. No one can say that he was ever guilty of a mean
</p>
<p>act to win a cause or accomplish an end. He was, moreover,
</p>
<p>one of the most kind-hearted and benevolent of men 
</p>
<p>always ready to give to the poor and needy, and cheerfully
</p>
<p>responding to every call of deserved charity.
</p>
<p>One of the noblest traits of his professional character was
</p>
<p>a desire to keep his clients out of litigation, if the matter in
</p>
<p>dispute could be compromised upon fair and equitable terms ;
</p>
<p>indeed, it is said that he compromised more cases and settled
</p>
<p>more disputes than all the other lawyers of his bar combined.
</p>
<p>If in the attempt to compromise his fee was in the way, or
</p>
<p>presented any obstacle, he would remit a part, and sometimes
</p>
<p>the whole, rather than permit the litigation to continue 
</p>
<p>particularly if the strife was between neighbors. He was
</p>
<p>eminently a man of peace as well as law.

<p>Another peculiarity he possessed as a lawyer was the power
</p>
<p>to concentrate his thoughts upon any subject that engaged
</p>
<p>his mind. He could sit in court with clients around him,
</p>
<p>and subject to all the interruptions attending the session of a
</p>
<p>court, and draw up a pleading, contract, or any legal paper,

</p>
<p>with as much precision and accuracy as though sitting in his
</p>
<p>office free from all interruption. He was thoroughly versed in
</p>
<p>the common-law system of pleading, which gave him a great
</p>
<p>advantage, particularly over lawyers educated under a differ-
</p>
<p>ent system. Like mostof the old lawyers, he became greatly
</p>
<p>incensed at the introduction of the "Wells Code," regarding
</p>
<p>it as a mere contrivance to aid the uneducated and ignorant
</p>
<p>practitioners. In fact, most of the well-educated lawyers of
</p>
<p>the state opposed it, upon the ground that it was an unwise
</p>
<p>innovation upon a system of pleading that had been sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned and perfected by the legal learning of centuries. They
</p>
<p>subscribed to the legal maxim, " Oinuis innovatio plus novitaie
</p>
<p>pcrUirbat quam uiilitate prodcsty
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis died very recently, February 25, 1878, aged
</p>
<p>seventy-nine years and thirteen days. He joined the Meth-
</p>
<p>odist church as early as 1824, and lived the life of an exem-
</p>
<p>plary Christian. " His death was not the darkness of
</p>
<p>despair, but was radiant with the hope of a happy immor-
</p>
<p>tality beyond the grave."
</p>
<p>During the last winter we received several letters from
</p>
<p>him imparting valuable information in regard to the early
</p>
<p>bar of south-eastern Missouri. They are written in a round,
</p>
<p>legible hand, and a style indicating that he had lost none of
</p>
<p>the vigor of his mind. We had expressed to his son, who
</p>
<p>is a member of the St. Louis bar, our intention to dedicate
</p>
<p>this work to him as the only survivor of the territorial law-
</p>
<p>yers of Missouri; but, alas! before this manuscript could
</p>
<p>reach the hands of the printer, he was also gathered to his
</p>
<p>fathers.

<p>Nothing to him falls early, or too late."
</p>
<p>George Tompkins. "
</p>
<p>This gentleman was for many years presiding justice of
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of Missouri, and was appointed to the
</p>
<p>bench in 1824. He w^as born in Carohne County, Virginia,
</p>
<p>m March, 1780. He was of EngHsh descent, and his ances-
</p>
<p>tors were among the early settlers of Virginia, owned large
</p>
<p>tracts of land and many slaves, and were largely engaged in
</p>
<p>the cultivation of tobacco, which they shipped to the Old
</p>
<p>Country. His father had thirteen children, George being
</p>
<p>next to the youngest. It does not appear that his education
</p>
<p>was above that usually obtained in the common-field schools
</p>
<p>of the Old Dominion ; but he must have improved himself
</p>
<p>greatly by reading, for he became a very good English
</p>
<p>scholar. It is not known precisely what time he left Virginia,
</p>
<p>but it must have been near the time he attained his major-
</p>
<p>ity ; for on a blank leaf in an old arithmetic printed in 1797,
</p>
<p>which at his death was found among his books, there is a
</p>
<p>memorandum in his own handwriting from which it appears
</p>
<p>that on April 29, 1806, he located at the " Rapids of Ohio,"
</p>
<p>and had then been in Jefferson County, Kentucky, at least
</p>
<p>two years.
</p>
<p>He left home with $100 in his pocket, given to him by
</p>
<p>his father, and rode to Kentucky on horseback. Ten years
</p>
<p>afterwards his father died, and George became entitled to a
</p>
<p>share of his estate, but for some reason he refused to receive
</p>
<p>it  most probably from the fact that he had a large number
</p>
<p>of sisters, and wished them to retain it. He remained in
</p>
<p>Kentucky about six or seven years, teaching school most of
</p>
<p>the time, and reading such law-books as fell in his way. He
</p>
<p>could not have been long at the " Rapids," for it is stated in
</p>
<p>the Illustrated History of Missouri, by Davis and Durie,
</p>
<p>"that in 1804 the first English school was opened in St.

<p>Louis by a man named Rotchford, who was succeeded by
</p>
<p>GEORGE TOMPKINS. 3 1
</p>
<p>George Tompkins, a young Virginian, who rented a room
</p>
<p>on the north side of Market Street, between Second and
</p>
<p>Third, for his pupils, and studied law at the same time."
</p>
<p>The population of St. Louis could not then have exceeded
</p>
<p>1,500, for it had increased but little since 1799, and a census
</p>
<p>taken in that year places it at 925. It was a small village, and
</p>
<p>the inhabitants Creole French, with the exception of two
</p>
<p>American families by the name of Sullivan and Adams. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tompkins, while teaching, boarded in a French family, and
</p>
<p>there obtained his knowledge of that language. Among
</p>
<p>Judge Tompkins' pupils was Louis A. Benoist, who became
</p>
<p>a wealthy banker in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>In 1 8 16, the }-ear of the introduction of the common law
</p>
<p>into the territory of Missouri, he settled in old Franklin,
</p>
<p>Howard County, and entered upon the practice of the law.
</p>
<p>He was twice elected to the Territorial Legislature, which
</p>
<p>then sat at St. Charles.
</p>
<p>In 1824 he was appointed judge of the Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>which position he held till 1845, when he was compelled to
</p>
<p>retire by a constitutional provision which prohibited any per-
</p>
<p>son from holding the office after reaching the age of sixty-
</p>
<p>five. He died on his farm near Jefferson City, on April 7,
</p>
<p>1846, in his sixty-seventh year.
</p>
<p>As a lawyer he was very successful, but we shall deal with
</p>
<p>him as a judge ; for it is in that capacity he was best known
</p>
<p>to the people of Missouri. That he was a fine jurist, and a
</p>
<p>man of spotless integrity, admits of no question. His opin-
</p>
<p>ions published in the early volumes of our Reports evince
</p>
<p>much learning and legal research. He was a great stickler
</p>
<p>for precedent and authority, and upon one occasion led the
</p>
<p>court to a decision which was in violation of every principle
</p>
<p>of justice, and robbed many a widow and orphan of their
</p>
<p>patrimonial estate. We allude to the case of Lecompte vs.

<p>Seargent, reported in 7th Missouri Reports, page 351, where
</p>
<p>the court held " that no principle of la\v is better settled
</p>
<p>than that an executor or administrator is for every purpose
</p>
<p>the owner of the moneys of his testator or intestate which
</p>
<p>have come to his hands. Therefore, when an administrator
</p>
<p>32 BENCH AND BAR OF MlSSOriU.
</p>
<p>took a note for money loaned, in which note he was named
</p>
<p>A B, administrator, etc., the individual debts of the adminis-
</p>
<p>trator may be set off against the note."
</p>
<p>The same doctrine was held in Thomas vs. Relfe, 9th
</p>
<p>Missouri Reports, page 377 ; and such was held to be the
</p>
<p>law until the decision of Lessing, Mayer & Co. vs. Ver-
</p>
<p>trees, in 32d Missouri Reports, page 431. We were then on
</p>
<p>the bench, and delivered the opinion which overruled
</p>
<p>Lecompte vs. Seargent, and Thomas vs. Relfe. The rul-
</p>
<p>ing in these cases seemed to us so repugnant to every
</p>
<p>principle of right and justice that we took occasion to
</p>
<p>examine with much care the authorities bearing upon the
</p>
<p>point. The chief authority relied upon, and cited in
</p>
<p>Lecompte vs. Seargent, was Farr ct al. vs. Newman el al.,
</p>
<p>4th Durnford and East, page 347. Judge Tompkins was
</p>
<p>misled by a reference to the case in an old English di-
</p>
<p>gest which he carried from court to court in his saddle-
</p>
<p>bags. What he supposed was the opinion of the court was
</p>
<p>merely the dissenting opinion of Justice BuUer. He never
</p>
<p>saw the report of the case, for three of the judges held to
</p>
<p>the contrary, and their opinion became the judgment of the
</p>
<p>court.
</p>
<p>We have been particular in referring to this case for the
</p>
<p>purpose of showing the disadvantage under which the early
</p>
<p>judges labored for the want of access to books.
</p>
<p>Judge Tompkins resided the last part of his professional
</p>
<p>life on a farm about a mile west of Jefferson City. He took
</p>
<p>great delight in horticulture, and raised the finest fruit in
</p>
<p>that section of the state. We visited him in the winter of
</p>
<p>1836-7, and partook of some of his apples and pears, which
</p>
<p>for fine flavor and delicacy could hardly be excelled. He
</p>
<p>was a man full of whims, oddities, and eccentricities, and
</p>
<p>not unfrequently perpetrated some good, old, genuine

<p>mother wit. Many anecdotes of him have been handed down
</p>
<p>to us, some of which we shall give :
</p>
<p>Our visit to Jefferson City in the winter of 1836-7 was to
</p>
<p>obtain a law license, which could only be granted by one of
</p>
<p>the supreme judges, and then only upon a personal exami-
</p>
<p>GEORGR TOMPK'/XS. 33
</p>
<p>nation of the applicant by the judge himself. General Doni-
</p>
<p>phan, then the most prominent member of the General
</p>
<p>Assembl}% was kind enough to tender us a letter of intro-
</p>
<p>duction, and as he did so whispered in our ear, " Don't forget
</p>
<p>to arm yourself with plenty of good cigars, and a little old
</p>
<p>Kentucky bourbon." Thanking the general for his letter
</p>
<p>and time!)' advice, we started for the judge's residence, who
</p>
<p>gave us a hearty welcome and some good old cider of his own
</p>
<p>manufacture  for he had a splendid orchard, and would
</p>
<p>talk fruit and horticulture from morning till night. He was as
</p>
<p>much at home on that subject as General Grant is upon the
</p>
<p>subject of dogs and horses. Said he, " Have you a room by
</p>
<p>yourself at the hotel? " We replied, " Yes." " Then," said
</p>
<p>he (for it was getting near sun-down), " I will call upon you
</p>
<p>at nine o'clock in the morning." Promptly to the hour he
</p>
<p>called, and, after passing the usual compliments of the day,
</p>
<p>began the examination.
</p>
<p>" Can you tell me," said he, "whether Blackstone wore his
</p>
<p>hair long or short? " We replied that, from the pictures of
</p>
<p>him we had seen, he was represented with long curly hair,
</p>
<p>hanging to his shoulders, powdered white. " Wrong ! " said
</p>
<p>he, " for he had no hair  was bald as a marble slab  wore a
</p>
<p>wig." This attempt at humor put us on our guard, and gave
</p>
<p>us to understand what we might expect. We invited him to
</p>
<p>a cigar, which he readily took, and then, after a short disqui-
</p>
<p>sition on smoking, broke out in a perfect avalanche of ques-
</p>
<p>tions on the law of real estate, most of which we readily
</p>
<p>answered, but a few were entirely too abstruse for our dull
</p>
<p>comprehension ; and when he drove us to the wall we
</p>
<p>invited him to a new cigar, or a little bourbon, as the readi-
</p>
<p>est means of escape; and if that failed, we talked apples,
</p>
<p>pumpkins, and grapes, until he entirely lost the subject of
</p>
<p>his inquiry. In this way two long days of anxiety to us

</p>
<p>were spent, and as our cigars were about to give out, and
</p>
<p>the brandy had nearly reached the bottom of the jug, he
</p>
<p>asked if we had prepared the license. We told him we had
</p>
<p>not, as we had no assurance that he would grant it. " Oh,"
</p>
<p>said he, " I was ready to grant it after the first hour's exami-

</p>
<p>34 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>nation ; but your cigars were so good, and your whisky so
</p>
<p>palatable, that I could not resist the temptation to prolong
</p>
<p>my visit."
</p>
<p>We mention this by way of introducing the reader to
</p>
<p>other instances of eccentricity which we shall have occasion
</p>
<p>to refer to. The advice of General Doniphan was no doubt
</p>
<p>well intended, but it cost us no little mental anxiety, to say
</p>
<p>nothing of our expenditure in brandy and cigars. We
</p>
<p>never visited Jefferson City afterwards without receiving 
</p>
<p>when he was at home  an invitation to spend a night with
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>At times he was irritable on the bench, and would fre-
</p>
<p>quently interrupt counsel in their argument with some odd
</p>
<p>remark or sarcastic inquiry. He dressed very plain, but
</p>
<p>never could tolerate slovenliness in others. A lawyer from
</p>
<p>one of the south-eastern counties, by the name of Mendell,
</p>
<p>was once engaged in an argument in his court, when Judge
</p>
<p>Tompkins interrupted him, near the time of the adjourn-
</p>
<p>ing hour, by saying, " Mr. Mendell, it is impossible for this
</p>
<p>court to see any law through as dirty a shirt as you have on ;
</p>
<p>and this court will now adjourn until ten o'clock to-morrow
</p>
<p>morning, to give you an opportunity to change your linen."
</p>
<p>In our memoir of Peyton R. Hayden, the reader will see
</p>
<p>a fine piece of repartee on the part of Mr. Hayden, in
</p>
<p>reply to an inquiry of the judge. Both were eminent men,
</p>
<p>and probably no great amount of love was lost between
</p>
<p>them ; and, as both were somewhat irritable, many amusing
</p>
<p>scenes occurred between them. We will give one or more :
</p>
<p>Mr. Hayden, in his arguments before the court, seldom
</p>
<p>used the words "plaintiff" and "defendant," but called the
</p>
<p>parties b}' name. Upon one occasion he was making an
</p>
<p>argument in behalf of a client by the name of Jones, and
</p>
<p>repeated the name frequently. Said Judge Tompkins to

</p>
<p>him, " Mr. Hayden, will you do me a favor?" "Yes, sir,"
</p>
<p>said Hayden, " I have known your honor a long time, sir,
</p>
<p>and will be glad, sir, to do }'ou any reasonable favor in my
</p>
<p>power." " I thought," said the judge, " if you have no
</p>
<p>objection, you might be willing to tell me the iianic of your
</p>
<p>GEORGE TOMPKINS. 35
</p>
<p>client." [A loud laugh from the bar at the expense of Mr.
</p>
<p>Hayden.] "Of course, sir; my client's name, sir, is Will-
</p>
<p>iam Jones, sir. He lives down on the Moro [a small stream
</p>
<p>about four miles below Jefferson City], sir, just below Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son City, sir. His name is William Jones, sir." " I thank
</p>
<p>you," said the judge ; " proceed in your argument." Mr.
</p>
<p>Hayden continued his argument, and went over the same
</p>
<p>point with the same illustration several times, when the judge
</p>
<p>again became impatient, and, interrupting him, said, " I wish
</p>
<p>to know, ]\Ir. Hayden, if you will do me another favor."
</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir," said Hayden, "with great pleasure, sir."
</p>
<p>"Then, I wish to know," said the judge, "if you don't think
</p>
<p>that when a lawyer has said the same thing 150 times, that
</p>
<p>that is enough ? " Hayden paused a moment, and replied,
</p>
<p>" No, sir ; I don't think any such thing, sir, and will tell you
</p>
<p>why, sir. I suppose, sir, that if I had mentioned the name
</p>
<p>of my client, Jones, in this argument once, sir, I had done so
</p>
<p>150 times, sir, but after all, your honor, sir, forgot his name,
</p>
<p>and you asked me, sir, what it was, and I had to tell you.
</p>
<p>So, my plan is, not only to say a thing, btit to rub it in if I
</p>
<p>can!' [A roar of laughter by the bar and spectators at the
</p>
<p>expense of the judge.]
</p>
<p>Upon another occasion Mr. Hayden quoted a decision of
</p>
<p>a justice of the peace in support of his side of the cause,
</p>
<p>which greatly vexed Judge Tompkins, who said to him,
</p>
<p>" Wliat do you mean, Mr. Hayden, by quoting such an
</p>
<p>opinion here ; don't you know that it has no authority in this
</p>
<p>court? I am astonished at such reckless waste of the time
</p>
<p>of the court." "I don't know why, sir," said Mr. Hayden;
</p>
<p>" I frequently find that the decisions of these justices of the
</p>
<p>peace are quite as able as the opinions of this court. I
</p>
<p>sometimes appeal to the justices of the peace from the
</p>
<p>opinions of the Supreme Court, and sometimes I appeal

</p>
<p>from the opinions of the justices of the peace to this court ;
</p>
<p>and I never could tell whether the case was better settled
</p>
<p>ivhen I appealed up or lohen I appealed doiun."
</p>
<p>Judge Tompkins was not proof against flattery when
</p>
<p>judiciously applied. But in this he had many worthy exam-
</p>
<p>^6 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>pies among the judiciary. Lord Bacon, the most learned of
</p>
<p>the English jurists in the time of Elizabeth, was particularly
</p>
<p>susceptible to it, and it no doubt gave strength to the charges
</p>
<p>of misconduct against him which caused his downfall.
</p>
<p>A little flattery, particularl)- if mixed A\ith a little wit, is
</p>
<p>sometimes more effectual than the law.
</p>
<p>In a recent number of the Western Jurist there is related
</p>
<p>an anecdote of a countrywoman in one of the small courts
</p>
<p>of Germany, which is a good illustration. The attorney of
</p>
<p>her opponent pestered her with so much chicanery and legal
</p>
<p>subtleties that she lost all patience, and interrupted him
</p>
<p>thus: "My lord, the case is simply this: I bespoke of my
</p>
<p>opponent, the carpet-maker, a carpet with figures, which was
</p>
<p>to be as handsome as my lord the judge, and he wants now
</p>
<p>to force me to take one with horrible caricatures, uglier even
</p>
<p>than his attorney. Was I not right in breaking off the bar-
</p>
<p>gain ? " The court laughed at the comparison, the attorney
</p>
<p>was stupefied, and the woman won her suit.

<p>Judge Tompkins left no family.
</p>
<p>Nathaniel w. Watkins.
</p>
<p>General Watkins obtained his military title from services
</p>
<p>rendered in the state militia ; for he held the commission of
</p>
<p>brigadier-general. He was born in Woodford County, Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky, on January 28, 1796, and was a half-brother of Henry
</p>
<p>Clay. He came to this state in 1820, and located at Jack-
</p>
<p>son, Cape Girardeau County, where he practiced law until
</p>
<p>his death, which took place March 20, 1875, at the ripe age
</p>
<p>of seventy-nine.
</p>
<p>He served several terms in the State Legislature ; was a
</p>
<p>member of the Convention which met in St. Louis imme-
</p>
<p>diately preceding the war, to take into consideration the re-
</p>
<p>lations of the state towards the Federal government  in
</p>
<p>other words, it was called by the Legislature, a majority of
</p>
<p>whom were secessionists  to adopt a secession ordinance;
</p>
<p>but the people thwarted the attempt by electing Union men.
</p>
<p>General Watkins was also a member of the late Convention
</p>
<p>called to amend the Constitution, and rendered very efficient
</p>
<p>service in that body. He was too devoted to his profession
</p>
<p>to become an office-seeker; hence he occupied but few
</p>
<p>places of public trust. Had he possessed any ambition for
</p>
<p>public honors, no doubt he would have been gratified ; for he
</p>
<p>had traits of character and mind well calculated to secure
</p>
<p>public favor. He was personally popular, active, and ener-
</p>
<p>getic, and as a speaker very forcible, and at times impas-
</p>
<p>sioned and eloquent. In this respect he partook, though in
</p>
<p>a less degree, of the nature of his gifted half-brother. As a
</p>
<p>lawyer he always commanded a good practice, and was gen-

<p>erally successful. One of his faults was a habit of some-
</p>
<p>times denouncing the opposing counsel and party  a prac-
</p>
<p>tice that seldom accomplishes any good, and often results in
</p>
<p>the loss of a meritorious cause.

<p>General Watkins was a kind, amiable, and benevolent
</p>
<p>38 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>man, and exceedingly liberal to the poor. No appeal was
</p>
<p>ever made to his sympathy to which he did not cheerfully
</p>
<p>respond. lie was one of those men who took more pleasure
</p>
<p>in giving than receiving. In the younger members of the
</p>
<p>profession he always took a deep interest, and if it was in
</p>
<p>his power to do anything to aid and encourage them, he
</p>
<p>never failed to do it. He was a man of great personal mag-
</p>
<p>netism, easy and polite in his manners, and made friends
</p>
<p>wherever he went. As a jury lawyer he met with unbounded
</p>
<p>success, and {&\n criminals were ever convicted when he was
</p>
<p>retained on the part of the defense. He managed his cases
</p>
<p>with great adroitness, and always kept the opposing counsel
</p>
<p>uneasy.
</p>
<p>General Watkins had not the benefit of a classical educa-
</p>
<p>tion, for the circumstances of his parents would not admit
</p>
<p>of it. At an early period he showed an adaptation to the
</p>
<p>legal profession, and it was fortunate that he had it in his
</p>
<p>power to pursue a regular course of legal studies in the
</p>
<p>Transylvania Law School, at Lexington, in which institution
</p>
<p>he graduated with distinction. His fondness for flowers and
</p>
<p>shrubbery was proverbial; and had he pursued the study of
</p>
<p>botany, would no doubt have become quite proficient in it.
</p>
<p>Like most of the early lawyers, he had a farm, and devoted
</p>
<p>all his spare time to its cultivation.
</p>
<p>There seems to be an affinity between Law and Agricul-
</p>
<p>ture ; for you rarely find a good lawyer who does not at
</p>
<p>some period of his life engage in the cultivation of the
</p>
<p>ground. All the early presidents and jurists were farmers,
</p>
<p>and many became fine horticulturists. It is said that Mr. Jef-
</p>
<p>ferson would follow the plow for days and weeks preceding
</p>
<p>the planting season; and there is a story extant of Silas
</p>
<p>Wright, of New York, to the effect that a distinguished
</p>
<p>foreigner, on his way through western New York, called

<p>upon him and found him plowing in his field, with his panta-
</p>
<p>loons rolled up above his knees. Mr. Van Buren always
</p>
<p>lived on a farm adjoining Kinderhook, and Chief Justice
</p>
<p>IVIarshall was about as well versed in farming as in the law.
</p>
<p>Mr. Webster was never so happy as when toiling on his
</p>
<p>NATHANIEL W. W ATKINS. 39
</p>
<p>plantation at Marshfield. An amusing incident is told of
</p>
<p>him, which the reader no doubt recollects, but it will well bear
</p>
<p>repetition : A young man rather dandified in his appearance
</p>
<p>called upon the great lawyer at Marshfield, and when he
</p>
<p>reached the road in front of the house, found that he could
</p>
<p>not cross it without soiling his boots, as recent rains had
</p>
<p>deluged the country. Mr. Webster, whom the stranger had
</p>
<p>never seen, was standing a few rods off, and, seeing his vis-
</p>
<p>itor hesitate, approached him, and taking off his shoes and
</p>
<p>rolling up his pants, waded to him, took him on his shoulders,
</p>
<p>and landed him safely on dry ground. When they reached
</p>
<p>the house the visitor requested that his card might be sent
</p>
<p>to Mr. Webster. "Well," said Mr. Webster, "that is my
</p>
<p>name." "No," said the other, "I want to see Webster the
</p>
<p>great United States senator." " Well, sir, my name is Web-
</p>
<p>ster, and I am a United States senator, but by no means a
</p>
<p>great one." The scene became too ludicrous even for the
</p>
<p>gravity of Mr, Webster, and both broke out in a hearty
</p>
<p>laugh.
</p>
<p>All the early judges, and most of the early lawyers, of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri were farmers. Tompkins and Scott had farms in the
</p>
<p>vicinity of Jefferson City. Judge McGirk lived on one of
</p>
<p>the finest plantations of the state, on Lieuter Island, in
</p>
<p>Montgomery County. Edward Bates lived for a number
</p>
<p>of years on a fine farm in St. Charles County, but he was
</p>
<p>not a very successful cultivator of the soil, for he frequently
</p>
<p>said it took all that lawyer Bates could make to support
</p>
<p>farmer Bates.
</p>
<p>That, however, was not the case with General Watkins,
</p>
<p>for he was successful in both. But one of the chief causes
</p>
<p>of his success at the bar was the happy facility he possessed
</p>
<p>of winning the favor and confidence of witnesses, thereby
</p>
<p>enabling him to elicit more from them in behalf of his client,

<p>and keeping back more that might be unfavorable, than any

<p>of his legal associates. Probably the most laborious jDosition

<p>filled by General Watkins was that of speaker of the House

</p>
<p>ate head, capable of commanding, and, in times of great ex-
</p>
<p>citement, enforcing, obedience to the rules and regulations
</p>
<p>of the body. That General Watkins possessed these quali-
</p>
<p>ties in an eminent degree was conceded by all. Some men
</p>
<p>are peculiarly fitted for the place, and we can recall no one
</p>
<p>who was more so during our service in the Legislature than

<p>General Sterling Price. Both he and Watkins were en-

</p>
<p>ALEXANDER BUCKNER,
</p>
<p>One of the earliest of the United States senators from Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, was born in Jefferson County, Kentucky, about the
</p>
<p>year 1785, and moved from Kentucky to Indiana, where he.
</p>
<p>entered upon the practice of the law ; but, having become
</p>
<p>involved in a duel, emigrated to Missouri in 18 18, and
</p>
<p>located in Cape Girardeau County, where he purchased a
</p>
<p>farm, and combined farming with the practice of the law
</p>
<p> not unusual with the early members of the profession.
</p>
<p>Colonel Buckner was a member of the Convention called
</p>
<p>to frame a state constitution preparatory to the admission of
</p>
<p>Missouri into the Union ; and also served in the Legislature.
</p>
<p>In 1 83 1 he was elected to the United States Senate for a
</p>
<p>full term, but died in 1833, about forty-six or forty-seven
</p>
<p>years of age. We are not aware of his holding any other
</p>
<p>office, except that of circuit attorney, and, for a brief period,
</p>
<p>state senator.
</p>
<p>Mr. Buckner, or, as he was usually called, Colonel Buckner,
</p>
<p>was a lawyer of very considerable ability, and enjoyed for
</p>
<p>that period a lucrative practice ; but his fondness for polit-
</p>
<p>ical life led him into a different field, so that it is impossible
</p>
<p>to say what distinction he might have reached in his profes-
</p>
<p>sion had he devoted more time to the law, and less to poli-
</p>
<p>tics. In him were combined many qualities that usually con-
</p>
<p>tribute to success in both ; for he was sociable, genial, and
</p>
<p>industrious, and as a speaker, fluent, argumentative, and
</p>
<p>earnest. Pleasant in his address, agreeable and interesting
</p>
<p>in conversation, he impressed favorably all with whom he
</p>
<p>came in contact. He was not in the United States Senate
</p>
<p>long enough to obtain much reputation as a statesman, but
</p>
<p>he seldom failed to carry any reasonable measure in which his
</p>
<p>constituents were interested, which did not partake of a

<p>It is much to be regretted that so httle information can be

<p>obtained regarding the early Hfe and education of this gen-
</p>
<p>tleman. In fact, there is but little known of him outside of

<p>him the highest office within their gift.
</p>
<p>Russell Hicks.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, who for many years filled the office of
</p>
<p>circuit judge in the western part of Missouri, was born near
</p>
<p>the close of the last centur}% in Worcester County, Massa-
</p>
<p>chusetts. When not exceeding two or three years of age
</p>
<p>his parents moved into the western part of New York, where
</p>
<p>young Hicks lived till he reached his eighteenth year. He
</p>
<p>was, in the broadest sense of the term, a self-made man, for
</p>
<p>his education was only such as he could obtain from the
</p>
<p>common schools of that day. He worked during the summer
</p>
<p>to procure means to pay his way in the winter, for his father
</p>
<p>was unable to render him any assistance.
</p>
<p>As soon as he felt able he commenced teaching a small
</p>
<p>school, and by teaching and working alternately he was
</p>
<p>enabled to support himself, and improve his mind by reading.
</p>
<p>He became what might be termed an itinerant teacher ; for
</p>
<p>he traveled through many states, and never stopped long in
</p>
<p>any one place.
</p>
<p>His first appearance west of the Mississippi was at St.
</p>
<p>Genevieve, in this state, where he took a contract for maul-
</p>
<p>ing rails and cutting cord-wood. He next made his appear-
</p>
<p>ance in St. Louis, where he engaged for a short time as a
</p>
<p>common laborer. His next move was to Saline County,
</p>
<p>where he again engaged in cutting cord-wood. It was about
</p>
<p>this time that he conceived the idea of studying law. He
</p>
<p>borrowed law-books wherever he could obtain them, reading
</p>
<p>at night, and mauling rails and performing other manual
</p>
<p>labor during the day. As soon as he thought himself capable
</p>
<p>of entering upon the practice he applied for admission to
</p>
<p>the bar, and, with his sheep-skin in his pocket, traveled on
</p>
<p>foot to Independence, where he opened a law-office, and
</p>
<p>procured a job of writing in the office of the clerk of the

</p>
<p>Circuit Court. In due time he was appointed treasurer of
</p>
<p>44 BENCH AND BAK OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Jackson County, which office he held many years. After
</p>
<p>the judiciary became elective, he was placed on the circuit
</p>
<p>bench to fill a vacancy, and about 1856 was elected to the
</p>
<p>same office by the people, and held it until 1859.
</p>
<p>Upon the breaking out of the rebellion he boldly advo-
</p>
<p>cated secession, and made himself very unpopular with the
</p>
<p>Union party. He was very imprudent and indiscreet in his
</p>
<p>conversation upon the subject, and, apprehending an arrest,
</p>
<p>went to St. Louis, where he attempted to establish himself in
</p>
<p>the practice; but failing in this he took up his residence in
</p>
<p>Sedalia, and formed a partnership with Hon. John F. Phillips
</p>
<p>and Hon. George G. Vest. He soon after moved to War-
</p>
<p>rensburg, in Johnson County, where he died in 1875, at the
</p>
<p>age of seventy-five.
</p>
<p>It will be thus seen that his life was one of constant toil
</p>
<p>and labor, yet by diligent study he made himself an excel-
</p>
<p>lent jurist. He was a man of strong native intellect, and
</p>
<p>only wanted education and refinement to give him an ex-
</p>
<p>alted position at the bar or on the bench. W'e have heard
</p>
<p>persons, who were competent judges, state that in natural
</p>
<p>ability, vigor of thought, and close, logical reasoning, he had
</p>
<p>no equal at the bar of western Missouri. While he resided
</p>
<p>in St. Louis we often met him in the Law Library, where he
</p>
<p>spent most of his time reading. He always appeared to us
</p>
<p>agreeable and entertaining, but he had the reputation of be-
</p>
<p>ing cross and ill-grained. He was certainly unpopular with
</p>
<p>the lawyers in his circuit, though they respected him for his
</p>
<p>legal attainments. He enjoyed the reputation of being a
</p>
<p>fine stump-speaker, and it is said could always draw applause
</p>
<p>from a promiscuous assembly.
</p>
<p>The success of Judge Hicks, under the most adverse cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, shows what assiduity and determination will
</p>
<p>accomplish, and should encourage young men who are aim-

<p>ing at professional distinction.
</p>
<p>There is something in the life of Judge Hicks that reminds
</p>
<p>us of Justice Catron, late of the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>United States ; for he also performed manual labor to enable
</p>
<p>him to obtain the rudiments of an English education, and
</p>
<p>RUSSELL HICKS. 45
</p>
<p>continued to do so long after he entered upon the prac-
</p>
<p>tice of his profession. Indeed, it is asserted that almost up
</p>
<p>to the time that General Jackson gave him his commission
</p>
<p>as supreme judge, he was seen at almost every public gath-
</p>
<p>ering in his neighborhood, leading a stallion about, and des-
</p>
<p>canting upon his fine blood and pedigree.
</p>
<p>Judge Hicks was a very large, stout-built man, with high
</p>
<p>cheek-bones and dark complexion, and might readily have
</p>
<p>passed for a half-breed Indian.

</p>
<p>He left no family.
</p>
<p> John d. Cook.
</p>
<p>Of the place of nativity of this excellent jurist we have no
</p>
<p>information, but he came to Missouri during the territorial
</p>
<p>government, and settled in Cape Girardeau County, where he
</p>
<p>entered upon the practice of the law. He was a member of
</p>
<p>the Convention which framed our original state Constitution,
</p>
<p>and we are indebted to him for some of its best provisions.
</p>
<p>Upon the admission of the state into the Union he was
</p>
<p>appointed judge of the Supreme Court, but on the removal
</p>
<p>of Judge R. S. Thomas from the Circuit Court by the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature, in 1834, Judge Cook was appointed in his place 
</p>
<p>preferring that to the supreme bench  and presided over
</p>
<p>the Tenth Judicial Circuit for many years, and became a
</p>
<p>distinguished nisi-prius judge. He was a thorough lawyer,
</p>
<p>and understood the common law as well as any divine ever
</p>
<p>understood the Ten Commandments  indeed, it was a com-
</p>
<p>mon saying among his legal associates that the common law
</p>
<p>was born in him. All he wanted to make him the peer of
</p>
<p>any western lawyer was industry and energy, in both of
</p>
<p>which he was greatly wanting. He loved his ease and com-
</p>
<p>fort, and cared nothing for office or position, though his
</p>
<p>name was placed in nomination in the first State Legislature
</p>
<p>for United States senator  at the time Benton and Barton
</p>
<p>were elected. He was not versed in the classics, but was a
</p>
<p>fine English scholar, and well posted in English literature.
</p>
<p>Judge Cook was addicted to no bad habits, unless laziness is
</p>
<p>one. He had fine conversational powers, was genial, pleas-
</p>
<p>ant, and full of anecdote, and could entertain one by the
</p>
<p>hour in the recital of them.
</p>
<p>He died in Cape Girardeau many years ago.
</p>
<p>Judge Cook was an extremely ugly-looking man, and,
</p>
<p>what is strange, seemed to regard his repulsive looks as a

<p>fortunate gift. Upon one occasion he was selected, wath

</p>
<p>several others, to represent Cape Girardeau in the great
</p>
<p>Internal Improvement Convention which was held in Chicago
</p>
<p>a short time before the w^ar. They took passage on a
</p>
<p>steamer for St. Louis, and one of the party discovered
</p>
<p>a gentleman on board who struck him as being an uglier
</p>
<p>man than Cook. This gentleman proved to be Judge
</p>
<p>Wright, a distinguished man from Ohio, and on his way to
</p>
<p>the same Convention. On returning to his party the gentle-
</p>
<p>man who made the discovery offered to bet a bottle of wine
</p>
<p>that there was a man on board uglier than Judge Cook. A
</p>
<p>stranger overhearing the conversation, and who was an
</p>
<p>acquaintance of Wright, immediately turned his e}'e upon
</p>
<p>Cook, and said, " I will take that bet," and it was agreed
</p>
<p>that it should be decided by a disinterested committee of
</p>
<p>three. It was then proposed to bring about an introduction
</p>
<p>between the two judges, and when it took place each fixed
</p>
<p>his eye most intently upon the other for several seconds w^ith-
</p>
<p>out a word passing between them. At length Judge Cook
</p>
<p>broke silence by saying, "Judge Wright, before I left home
</p>
<p>I promised that if during my absence I found a man uglier
</p>
<p>than myself, I would immediately return ; and now, sir, I
</p>
<p>shall leave the boat at the next landing, and take the first
</p>
<p>one on the downward trip." " Stop, my dear sir," said
</p>
<p>Judge Wright, "you may be a good judge of law, but you
</p>
<p>are an exceedingly poor judge of beauty, and the only way to
</p>
<p>settle this question is to submit it to a disinterested tribunal,
</p>
<p>and I propose to let the bar decide it ; thereupon they all
</p>
<p>proceeded to the bar, and over several bottles of champagne
</p>
<p>drank to each other's health ; and it was lield, without a dis-
</p>
<p>se7iting opinion, after due deliberation, that two uglier men
</p>
<p>were never born of woman, and that they should be adjudged
</p>
<p>to pay the costs.
</p>
<p>Judge Cook was a man of large heart and great benevo-

<p>lence  in fact, almost prodigal in his gifts to the poor. He
</p>
<p>w^as, moreover, a warm friend to the younger members of the
</p>
<p>profession, ever ready to assist and encourage them. To an
</p>
<p>applicant for a law license it was almost impossible for him
</p>
<p>to give a refusal. A young cabinet-maker, with a few months'
</p>
<p>48 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>reading, imagined that he was cut out for a lawyer, and
</p>
<p>appHed to the judge for a hcense. The judge appointed a
</p>
<p>committee of the bar to examine him, who reported him dis-
</p>
<p>quahfied. Thereupon he made a request that the judge
</p>
<p>should examine him in person, which was accordingly done.
</p>
<p>"What do you understand law to be?"
</p>
<p>" Law, sir  law  yes, sir  it is that which governs the
</p>
<p>people, and out of which lawyers make a living."
</p>
<p>" But what does Blackstone say about it?"
</p>
<p>"Ah [pompously], excuse me, judge, I have not yet read
</p>
<p>the learned author."
</p>
<p>" Well, what does Kent say about it?"
</p>
<p>" Kent, Kent  well really, judge, to tell you the truth, I
</p>
<p>have not read him either ; but promise myself the pleasure
</p>
<p>of doing so at an early day."
</p>
<p>A few other questions followed, with no better result, when
</p>
<p>the judge, with one of his kindest smiles, said : " Mr. R., I
</p>
<p>will take pleasure in granting you a license, /"^-r / t/iiiik yoii
</p>
<p>can do as little harm hi the pi'ofession as any one I knozuT
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Judge Cook's amiability, he could, when
</p>
<p>the occasion called for it, be quite sarcastic. While holding
</p>
<p>a term of his court at Bloomfield, a young lawyer who had
</p>
<p>made himself very conspicuous, much to the annoyance of
</p>
<p>the court, rose  while the court and bar were awaiting in
</p>
<p>silence the return of a jury  and inquired in a pompous w^ay,
</p>
<p>" if there was anything before the court." The judge, taking
</p>
<p>a prolonged and significant look at him, replied, " Not much,
</p>
<p>I believe." The poor fellow felt the sting, and wilted down.
</p>
<p>This is not unlike the story of Curran, who was once
</p>
<p>addressing a jury when the judge, who was thought to be
</p>
<p>antagonistic to his client, intimated his dissent from the argu-
</p>

<p>JOHNSON RANNEY
</p>
<p>Was a prominent lawyer in Jackson, Cape Girardeau County,
</p>
<p>Missouri, having practiced in the south-eastern part of the
</p>
<p>state upwards of thirty years.
</p>
<p>He was born in Litchfield County, Connecticut, on Decem-
</p>
<p>ber 19, 1789, and came from good old Revolutionary stock,
</p>
<p>his father having been a soldier during the War of the Revo-
</p>
<p>lution and the War of 181 2, and during the latter was lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant-colonel of the Fourth United States Infantry. After
</p>
<p>the close of the war he settled down as a farmer in Connec-
</p>
<p>ticut, and being in poor circumstances, was unable to give
</p>
<p>his sons the advantages of a liberal education. Johnson, at
</p>
<p>a very early age, expressed a strong desire to acquire a good
</p>
<p>education, and entered one of the higher academies, render-
</p>
<p>ing personal service for his tuition. When old enough to
</p>
<p>take charge of a school he commenced teaching, and directed
</p>
<p>all his spare time to reading and prosecuting his own studies.
</p>
<p>He was often seen at night pursuing his studies by no other
</p>
<p>light than that afforded by a scanty fire. During the War of
</p>
<p>1812 he served as ensign in the Fourth United States In-
</p>
<p>fantry, and through life manifested a strong partiality for a
</p>
<p>military life. After coming to Missouri he was made a briga-
</p>
<p>dier-general of militia.
</p>
<p>It will be noticed that nearly all the Cape Girardeau law-
</p>
<p>yers held commissions in the state militia  most of them
</p>
<p>reaching the grade of brigadier-general. There were Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Watkins, General English, General Jackson, General
</p>
<p>Evans, and General Ranney ; and several colonels and ma-
</p>
<p>jors. In those days some knowledge of military tactics was
</p>
<p>regarded in a public man as an element of success, more
</p>
<p>particularly if he had political aspirations.
</p>
<p>The state militia at that time were under thorough organi-
</p>
<p>zation, and every able-bodied man between certain ages was
</p>
<p>compelled to muster quite frequently, or subject himself to

</p>
<p>tlie payment of a fine. The practice gradually fell into
</p>
<p>disrepute, until the Legislature was forced by public opinion
</p>
<p>to so amend the law as to require simply an enrollment. We
</p>
<p>mustered on several occasions, but failed to elicit any com-
</p>
<p>mendation from the officers in command, nor can we say
</p>
<p>that our militar)' education ever conferred much glory upon
</p>
<p>the state ; for the highest grade we reached was that of fourth
</p>
<p>corporal. While teaching, General Ranney devoted a por-
</p>
<p>tion of his time to the study of the law. He could not have
</p>
<p>been licensed in Connecticut, for as early as 1814 he came
</p>
<p>West and located at Indianapolis, Indiana, and practiced
</p>
<p>there a short time. He then came to Missouri, and opened a
</p>
<p>law-office in Jackson, Cape Girardeau County. Here he
</p>
<p>encountered a difficulty which he had not anticipated. The
</p>
<p>inhabitants of Cape Girardeau were mostly from Virginia,
</p>
<p>Kentucky, and Tennessee, and were strongly prejudiced
</p>
<p>against the Yankees. Wooden nutmegs had become an
</p>
<p>article of commerce, and were just beginning to find their
</p>
<p>way into the western settlements. Many of the people of
</p>
<p>Jackson determined that Mr. Ranney should leave, and
</p>
<p>sought every opportunity to involve him in personal rencoun-
</p>
<p>ters. In some of these fights he was badly used up, while
</p>
<p>in others he came off victorious, and showed so much pluck
</p>
<p>that he acquired the ai^pellation of the " Brave Yankee."
</p>
<p>From this time he rose rapidly in his profession, and soon
</p>
<p>obtained the confidence and good-will of the people. He
</p>
<p>practiced in the counties of Cape Girardeau, St. Genevieve,
</p>
<p>Perry, Washington, Madison, Wa}me, Scott, and New
</p>
<p>Madrid; and sometimes attended the court at Davidsonville,
</p>
<p>in Arkansas. As was the invariable practice in those days,
</p>
<p>the lawyers traveled from court to court on horseback, which
</p>
<p>led to those social and genial habits for which the western
</p>
<p>lawyer 13 particularly noted. He represented his county

</p>
<p>once in the Legislature, which convened at St. Charles, but
</p>
<p>with that exception we are not aware of his holding any civil
</p>
<p>office. He was too much devoted to his profession to let his
</p>
<p>name be used for office, though he was well versed in the
</p>
<p>political history of his country, and was fond of listening to
</p>
<p>the political contests on the hustings.
</p>
<p>JOHNSON RANNEY. 5 I
</p>
<p>General Ranne\' was a strong, well-read, reliable, and suc-
</p>
<p>cessful lawyer. He was not a pleasant speaker, though in
</p>
<p>the argument of a question of law was clear, concise, and
</p>
<p>logical, and alwa\-s commanded the close attention of the
</p>
<p>court. Before a jur}' he was not impressive, but his high
</p>
<p>character for integrit}-, and the confidence reposed in him,
</p>
<p>gave him an influence which w as alwa\'s felt in the jury-box.
</p>
<p>He ^\'as not a man given to convivialit)', hence there are
</p>
<p>no anecdotes that attach to him. He was slovenh- in his
</p>
<p>dress, and often wore a large overcoat in the hottest period
</p>
<p>of the summer. Upon one occasion he appeared in the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court to argue a case of importance, when he was
</p>
<p>reproved by one of the judges for the negligence of his
</p>
<p>toilet. The next morning he again appeared, but this time
</p>
<p>in the garb of a dandy  so completely metamorphosed that
</p>
<p>his own dog would not have known him. When he rose to
</p>
<p>resume his argument, he commenced by sa}'ing, in a serious
</p>
<p>and grave manner : " May it please the court, before proceed-
</p>
<p>ing further in the argument, I should like to know if the fas-
</p>
<p>tidious taste of the court interposes any obstacle to my
</p>
<p>recognition."
</p>
<p>General Ranney was licensed by Judge Silas Bent, on
</p>
<p>December 4, 181 5, and, to give the reader a knowledge of

<p>the form of an attorney's license under the territorial gov-

</p>
<p>General Ranney died on his farm near Jackson, in Au-
</p>
<p>gust, 1848, in his fifty-ninth }'ear. He was twice married,
</p>
<p>and left a large family in independent circumstances.
</p>
<p>John B. C. Lucas.
</p>
<p>This gentleman was one of the most remarkable men who
</p>
<p>ever settled west of the Mississippi River. He came to
</p>
<p>Missouri at a very early time, and soon acquired consider-
</p>
<p>able prominence as a jurist.
</p>
<p>He was born in Normand}-, France, in 1762; graduated at
</p>
<p>Caen, in 1782, as Doctor of the Civil and Common Laws;
</p>
<p>practiced almost two years in his native place, and then emi-
</p>
<p>grated to the United States, first settling on a small farm in
</p>
<p>the vicinity of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. It is said that at
</p>
<p>this time he seriously contemplated abandoning his profes-
</p>
<p>sion for the purpose of engaging in agricultural pursuits,
</p>
<p>suggested, no doubt, b)- a want of knowledge of the English
</p>
<p>language ; but he must have soon changed his mind, for he
</p>
<p>applied himself very closely to the study of it, and in 1792
</p>
<p>was elected to the Legislature. He also served for a time
</p>
<p>as judge of the Court of Common Pleas in his district; was
</p>
<p>sent to Congress from Pennsylvania in 1803, and in 1805
</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson appointed him judge of the United States
</p>
<p>Court in Upper Louisiana.
</p>
<p>He then took up his residence in St. Louis, where he re-
</p>
<p>mained till his death, which took place in 1842, at the age
</p>
<p>of eighty years.
</p>
<p>Judge Lucas also filled the office of commissioner of land
</p>
<p>titles, and this, no doubt, directed his attention to the acqui-
</p>
<p>sition of real estate. When he came to Missouri, St. Louis
</p>
<p>Avas a small French village, but he foresaw in the future a
</p>
<p>large commercial city, and possessed himself of all the soil
</p>
<p>he could obtain in and around it, which enabled him to leave
</p>
<p>a large estate, which, at this day, with the improvements,
</p>
<p>must exceed in value ;^ 1 5 ,000,000 ; but it is said that his net
</p>
<p>income at the time of his death was not over ^2,000. As he
</p>
<p>scarcely ever improved his property, and expended large

<p>Fourth Street running west, and embracing Market, Chestnut,
</p>
<p>Pine, and OHve Streets, fell by gift and inheritance to his
</p>
<p>two surviving children, James H. Lucas and Mrs. Ann Hunt.
</p>
<p>We well recollect the old stone house on the corner of
</p>
<p>Seventh and Market, which was his residence many years,
</p>
<p>and where he died. It is the lot on which now stands the
</p>
<p>Masonic Institution. He had a residence, also, in the neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood of Thirteenth and Olive, now enclosed as a public
</p>
<p>park. It was then in the woods, and so far from the village
</p>
<p>that the people predicted that in three months the Indians
</p>
<p>would have his scalp.
</p>
<p>It is evident from what has already been stated that Judge
</p>
<p>Lucas, in addition to a thorough and classical education, was
</p>
<p>a man of extensive learning and acquirements. His appoint-
</p>
<p>ment, by Mr. Jefferson, to a Federal judgeship, shows that he
</p>
<p>must have been regarded as a sound lawyer; for in those
</p>
<p>days men were selected for such positions on account of their
</p>
<p>fitness and qualification. He was also at one time acting
</p>
<p>governor of the territory, and at the first State Legislature
</p>
<p>was a candidate for the United States Senate.
</p>
<p>Our recollection of Judge Lucas is that he was rather
</p>
<p>small in stature, with dark complexion, and large and promi-
</p>
<p>nent features, and not much unlike his son, the late James
</p>
<p>H. Lucas.
</p>
<p>We never learned that any fault was found with his admin-
</p>
<p>istration of the laws  certainly no objection was made
</p>
<p>involving his capacity, for he understood the old Spanish and
</p>
<p>French titles as well as any man in the territory. That he
</p>
<p>was eccentric and irritable, and sometimes exhibited those
</p>
<p>defects on the bench, is unquestionable.
</p>
<p>Upon one occasion a pompous and self-conceited young
</p>
<p>lawyer made a spread-eagle speech to a jury in his court,
</p>
<p>which annoyed him exceedingly, and the next day young

<p>ALEXANDER GRAY.
</p>
<p>During the War of 1812 a large number of young lawyers
</p>
<p>in every part of the country joined the army; some as pri-
</p>
<p>vates and some holding subordinate positions. Among them
</p>
<p>was Alexander Gray, who reached the grade of captain.
</p>
<p>Where he was born, and where educated, is not known to us,
</p>
<p>nor have we been able to find any record that would show
</p>
<p>it. About the close of the war he came to Cape Girardeau,
</p>
<p>Missouri, and from there to St. Louis, quite a young man,
</p>
<p>and entered upon the practice of the law, and became judge
</p>
<p>of the Circuit Court, and afterwards judge of what was then
</p>
<p>called the Northern Circuit, comprised of the counties of
</p>
<p>St. Charles, Montgomery, and probably Howard  for there
</p>
<p>were then but few counties in the state, and none west of
</p>
<p>Howard.
</p>
<p>He was a man of fine attainments, vain of his personal
</p>
<p>appearance, and on the bench presided with much dignity.
</p>
<p>Before taking a seat on the bench he had acquired consider-
</p>
<p>able reputation as a lawyer, particularly a criminal lawyer. In
</p>
<p>the case of the government against Gentery, who was indicted
</p>
<p>for the murder of Carroll, a descendant of Charles Carroll of
</p>
<p>Carrollton, and register of the land-office at old Franklin, he
</p>
<p>was retained on the part of the defense, and made a speech
</p>
<p>which attracted the attention of the bar throughout the terri-
</p>
<p>tory, and gave him a high reputation as an advocate. He,
</p>
<p>however, became intemperate and dissolute in his habits,
</p>
<p>which caused his death sometime in 1826.
</p>
<p>By reference to the journal of the General Assembly of
</p>
<p>Missouri Territory which held its session in 1820, in the old
</p>
<p>Missouri Hotel, on Main Street in St. Louis, it will be seen
</p>
<p>that Judge Gray administered the oath of office to the mem-
</p>
<p>bers.

</p>
<p>Peyton R. Hayden.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, whose residence was in Boonville, Cooper
</p>
<p>County, was one of the most eminent lawyers in the state.
</p>
<p>We made his acquaintance as early as 1840, and always
</p>
<p>entertained a very high opinion of his legal attainments.
</p>
<p>His reputation as a lawyer was co-extensive with the state,
</p>
<p>and his practice was equal to, if not greater than, that of any
</p>
<p>other lawyer in central Missouri.
</p>
<p>He was a native of Kentucky, and born near Paris, Bour-
</p>
<p>bon County, February 8, 1796. He received an ordinary
</p>
<p>English education, such onl}' as could be obtained from the
</p>
<p>old-field schools of that state.
</p>
<p>Having fixed upon the law as his profession, he entered,
</p>
<p>in 181 1, the office of Judge Benjamin Mills, a prominent
</p>
<p>lawyer of that part of the state, and pursued his studies with
</p>
<p>great diligence until the fall of 18 17, when he came to Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, first settling in Cape Girardeau County, but in the
</p>
<p>following spring removed to old Franklin, in Howard
</p>
<p>County, and taught school in the neighborhood during the
</p>
<p>entire }'ear of 18 18. Kit Carson, the celebrated mountain-
</p>
<p>guide and explorer, was one of his pupils. While teaching
</p>
<p>he devoted his leisure time to his legal studies.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 18 19 he made a trip to St. Louis on horse-
</p>
<p>back, procured from the Supreme Court a license to prac-
</p>
<p>tice, and on his return remained overnight at a small log
</p>
<p>tavern in St. Charles, and there met for the first time Abiel
</p>
<p>Leonard. [The reader is referred to our sketch of Mr.
</p>
<p>Leonard for a very amusing account of this meeting, and
</p>
<p>what transpired between them on their way to old Franklin.]
</p>
<p>The town of Franklin at that time had a population of nearly
</p>
<p>2,000, and prospectively was considered the most desirable
</p>
<p>place in the territory for a good lawyer, St. Louis not

<p>excepted. In 18 19 Mr. Hayden married a sister of Judge
</p>
<p>5 8 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Wash. Adams, and immediately located in tlic village of
</p>
<p>Boonville, which continued to be his residence through life.
</p>
<p>Cooper County was originally a part of Howard, and con-
</p>
<p>tinued so until December, 1818, when it was organized as a
</p>
<p>separate county, and Boonville became the county-seat. The
</p>
<p>first Circuit Court was held at the house of William Bartlett,
</p>
<p>but the next year a court-house was erected. The new
</p>
<p>county embraced a very large territor}', extending from the
</p>
<p>Osage River on the east and south to the territorial line on
</p>
<p>the west, and contained a population of about 7,000. Over
</p>
<p>this extensive country the lawyers traveled on horseback,
</p>
<p>and, as the people were poor, the fees of the attorneys were
</p>
<p>necessarily small, and most of them paid in what was called
</p>
<p>in those days, " truck and turn-over." An old horse, blind in
</p>
<p>one eye and with little capacity to see out of the other, was
</p>
<p>considered a good fee. The lawyers who at that time reg-
</p>
<p>ularly attended the Cooper court were George Tompkins,
</p>
<p>Hamilton R. Gamble, Peyton R. Hayden, John S. Bricky,
</p>
<p>Cyrus Edward, Andrew McGirk, Abiel Leonard, John F.
</p>
<p>Ryland, Dabney Carr, William J. Redd, John Payne, Duff
</p>
<p>Green, Charles French, and one or two others. Duff Green,
</p>
<p>who became distinguished as a political writer and editor at
</p>
<p>Washington City, left at an early day, and turned over his
</p>
<p>business to Mr. Hayden. Most of the above-named became
</p>
<p>distinguished in their profession, and six of them afterwards
</p>
<p>sat on the bench of the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>David Todd was judge of the Circuit Court. Mr. Hayden
</p>
<p>and Abiel Leonard took the lead at the bar, and were on
</p>
<p>opposite sides in almost every important case ; and be it said
</p>
<p>to their credit that the utmost courtesy was observed be-
</p>
<p>tween them, and they continued warm friends through life.
</p>
<p>In his manner Mr. Hayden was rather dignified, but always
</p>
<p>kind, affable, and courteous in his intercourse with others

<p>dozen times a day, would each time greet you with a bow
</p>
<p>and a smile. He was very fond of the society of ladies, and
</p>
<p>in their company was extremely graceful and entertaining.
</p>
<p>PEYTON R. HAY DEN. 59
</p>
<p>He was also full of life and animation, had a ""ood fund of
</p>
<p>humor, fond of anecdotes, and told them admirably. He
</p>
<p>was often the subject of them himself, and while many were
</p>
<p>unquestionably true, others were manufactured out of whole
</p>
<p>cloth ; but below we give a few that are very well authenti-
</p>
<p>cated. He indulged largely in profane language, but his
</p>
<p>profanity was not Gi that kind which shocks one's sensibility,
</p>
<p>for it never proceeded from anger or depravity of heart; for
</p>
<p>no man ever lived with better or kinder impulses, or with a
</p>
<p>more enlarged reverence for good morals and Christian vir-
</p>
<p>tues. His habits, moreover, were moral, studious, and in all
</p>
<p>respects unexceptionable.
</p>
<p>We have already stated that as a lawyer he ranked among
</p>
<p>the ablest of the state, and always enjo}'ed a most extensive
</p>
<p>practice, and had he been a financier, would have accumu-
</p>
<p>lated a large fortune ; but he charged small fees, and fre-
</p>
<p>quently failed to collect them. He seemed to have but little
</p>
<p>knowledge of the value of money, and was often imposed
</p>
<p>upon by appeals for charity. He was a strong, vigorous, and
</p>
<p>argumentative speaker, never indulging in flights of oratory,
</p>
<p>but seldom failed to make a favorable impression on the
</p>
<p>minds of a jury. He prepared his cases with great care;
</p>
<p>was very methodical, and carried with him around the circuit
</p>
<p>a book which he called " Hayden's Digest." It contained
</p>
<p>a synopsis of each case in which he was retained, with the
</p>
<p>authorities upon which he relied. He had it in court with
</p>
<p>him on all occasions. He never prepared his speeches in
</p>
<p>advance, and, hence, all his efforts were extempore ; but he
</p>
<p>was fluent, and good at repartee. The younger members
</p>
<p>of the bar were greatly attached to him, for he was kind
</p>
<p>and indulgent to them, and ever ready to assist them with
</p>
<p>his advice and counsel.

<p>Mr. Hayden died in Boonville on December 26, 1855, in

<p>his sixtieth year.
</p>
<p>The following anecdote of Mr. Havden was related to us
</p>
<p>by himself, though we have often heard it from others : The
</p>
<p>judges and lawyers, in going from one court to another,
</p>
<p>traveled together on horseback, the distance between courts
</p>
<p>6o BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>being from fifty to lOO miles; and, in order to make the trip
</p>
<p>as little irksome as possible, all kinds of tricks and practical
</p>
<p>jokes were practiced upon each other by common consent,
</p>
<p>and he who complained was heavily fined in wines, liquors,
</p>
<p>and cigars  the payment of which was strictly enforced.
</p>
<p>On one of their trips to Liberty they stopped over night at
</p>
<p>their accustomed place, kept by a buxom widow, who well
</p>
<p>knew the time when to expect the judge and the attorneys,
</p>
<p>and was, consequently, prepared to receive them. Her first
</p>
<p>consideration was for Judge Todd, whose soft voice and
</p>
<p>affable and winning manners had won her esteem ; and she
</p>
<p>invariably vacated her room, the best in the house, for his
</p>
<p>use. The attorneys determined to rob the judge of his
</p>
<p>comfortable quarters, which was no easy task. The widow
</p>
<p>was a high-toned, virtuous woman, and above all things
</p>
<p>abhorred incontinence in either man or woman. To carry
</p>
<p>out their object, they hit upon the following plan : They
</p>
<p>must attack the chastity of the judge, and circumstances,
</p>
<p>person, etc., were opportune. It was Mr. Hayden's first
</p>
<p>visit in that part of the circuit, and, hence, the widow was
</p>
<p>unacquainted with him. In some respects Mr. Hayden was
</p>
<p>a fair representative of a female, for his face was full, round,
</p>
<p>and smooth, and almost destitute of beard, and his com-
</p>
<p>plexion very florid. He had long, fine, auburn hair, which
</p>
<p>he took great care of. It was nicely combed, coiled, and
</p>
<p>secured to the back of his head with a tucking-comb. He
</p>
<p>and the judge were riding together in the rear, at a moderate
</p>
<p>pace, while the conspirators. Gamble, French, Ryland, and
</p>
<p>others, hastened on and reached the widow's first. After
</p>
<p>paying the usual compliments, she inquired after the judge.
</p>
<p>Now was the time for action. In reply they gently and
</p>
<p>darkly hinted that the judge, since she last saw him, had
</p>
<p>lost caste among the bar and the people, by the disgraceful

</p>
<p>manner in which he had treated his wife.
</p>
<p>The widow was thunderstruck at the information, and
</p>
<p>insisted upon hearing all the particulars. They hesitated,
</p>
<p>and her anxiety increased, when finally, and regretfully, they
</p>
<p>told her that the judge had been for some time keeping com-
</p>
<p>PEYTON R. HAY DEN. 6 1
</p>
<p>pany with a bad woman disguised in men's clothes ; that he
</p>
<p>had carried her with him around the other portion of the cir-
</p>
<p>cuit; and that she was now with him, and they would be
</p>
<p>along presently. She exclaimed with horror, and raised
</p>
<p>hands  '' Did you ever.' They sha'n't put up here! I'll
</p>
<p>drive him and his nasty hussy away. To ihi/ik that I have
</p>
<p>put myself to so much trouble  vacated my comfortable
</p>
<p>room for him  Jic needn't think it! He sha'n't disgrace me
</p>
<p>and m}' house." She was terribly out of temper, and just
</p>
<p>then the judge and Mr. Hayden made their appearance.
</p>
<p>She turned on the judge, and in her excitement gave him a
</p>
<p>terrible tongue-scourging; and pointing with the finger of
</p>
<p>scorn at Mr. Hayden, her tongue fastened in the middle and
</p>
<p>loose at both ends, she let him have it hot and Jieavy :
</p>
<p>" You vile wretch ! You nast}', stinking hussy ! Dressed in
</p>
<p>men's clothes, and running around the country with judges
</p>
<p>and laivyers. You are a slianie and a disgrace to your sex.
</p>
<p>Leave here, both of you ! You sha'n't pollute my house with
</p>
<p>your presence." All this took place sooner than it can be
</p>
<p>told, and, notwithstanding the attempted explanation of the
</p>
<p>judge and his companion, the widow's wrath was undimin-
</p>
<p>ished, and the disgraced judge and his paramour had to
</p>
<p>remount their horses and ride ten miles further to procure a
</p>
<p>night's lodging.
</p>
<p>We have spoken of Mr. Hayden's harmless profanity, and
</p>
<p>the following anecdote is very characteristic : They were
</p>
<p>holding court in Boonville, and occupying the Methodist
</p>
<p>church until they finished a new court-house then in the
</p>
<p>course of erection. A Methodist preacher by the name of
</p>
<p>Smith had made an appointment to preach one night, and
</p>
<p>seeing a light in the church after the usual hour of holding
</p>
<p>court, went in to ascertain if he could occupy the premises.
</p>
<p>A lawyer was addressing the jury, and Mr. Hayden was tak-

</p>
<p>ing notes with the intention of replying. Brother Smith
</p>
<p>knew him very well, and took a seat beside him, and, cast-
</p>
<p>ing his eye upon the notes, discovered the following: "By
</p>
<p>God! he has traveled out of the record. By God! I will
</p>
<p>travel out of the record also." Smith looked at Hayden
</p>
<p>62 BENCH AND BAR OF MlSSOriU.
</p>
<p>with astonishment, and said, " Wliy, brother Hayden, do you
</p>
<p>indulge in profane language in court? " 1 Ia}-dcn immediately
</p>
<p>replied, "Who said I ever did ? If, brollicr Smith, \'ou hear
</p>
<p>ail}' person sa)- that I indulge in profane language, you are
</p>
<p>authorized to say for me that he is a d  d liar."
</p>
<p>Mr. Hayden was as unconscious of having violated the
</p>
<p>dix'ine law as the parson Confederate general, Bishop Polk,
</p>
<p>was when he made his famous prayer in the rifle-pits on the
</p>
<p>Mississippi River. As the Federal gun-boats, under com-
</p>
<p>mand of Commodore Foote, were on their way down the
</p>
<p>river, they had to encounter several Confederate batteries,
</p>
<p>and it became evident to the Confederates that if they suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded in passing a certain bend in the river, that no earthly
</p>
<p>power could prevent them from going below. The bishop
</p>
<p>and his forces were stationed in rifle-pits, and as the shells
</p>
<p>of the enemy came roaring and buzzing through the air and
</p>
<p>over their heacis, the good bishop fell upon his knees and
</p>
<p>offered a most fervent prayer to the throne of grace. He
</p>
<p>invoked the vengeance of the Almighty, and prayed that the
</p>
<p>thunderbolts of His wrath might fall upon the Yankee craft,
</p>
<p>and sink them to the lowest depths of the great Father of
</p>
<p>Waters ; and as he rose from his knees he saw one of the
</p>
<p>boats poking her nose around the bend, and instantly ex-
</p>
<p>claimed at the top of his voice, " There, by God, they come
</p>
<p>noiv !
</p>
<p>Another anecdote of Mr. Hayden is reliable. He was once
</p>
<p>employed to defend a fellow who was indicted in the Cooper
</p>
<p>Circuit Court for horse-stealing. The evidence was circum-
</p>
<p>stantial, but very strong, and through the exertion and inge-
</p>
<p>nuit}' of I\Ir. Hayden he escaped conviction. As they left
</p>
<p>the court-house, Hayden took him one side and told him that
</p>
<p>he had better leave at once, as the people were satisfied of
</p>
<p>his guilt, and Judge Lynch might take the case under his

</p>
<p>jurisdiction. "Why," said the fellow, "Mr. Hayden, how
</p>
<p>can I get away ? I have no money, am too lame to walk, and
</p>
<p>am without a horse." "Oh," said Hayden, in a jocular way,
</p>
<p>" you have stolen one horse, and I don't think it will disturb
</p>
<p>your conscience much to steal another." The ungrateful fel-
</p>
<p>PEYTOX R. HA YD EN. 63
</p>
<p>low took the hint, and that night broke into Hayden's stable
</p>
<p>and stole his best horse. Hayden went in pursuit, and over-
</p>
<p>took him on the Osage River, about sixty or sevent\- miles
</p>
<p>from Boonville, brought him back, and  the court being still
</p>
<p>in session  had him indicted, convicted, and sent to the pen-
</p>
<p>itentiarv, where he served out a full term.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ha}'den often cautioned his friends against trading
</p>
<p>with a preacher, " for," said he, " he will cheat you in spite
</p>
<p>of everything." The admonition was suggested by a trade
</p>
<p>he once made with a Baptist minister by the name of Jones.
</p>
<p>Hayden owned a stud-horse which he professed to value
</p>
<p>very highly, but nevertheless was anxious to get rid of him,
</p>
<p>as he was worthless. Jones, who lived in an adjoining
</p>
<p>county, had some business with Mr. Hayden, and in the course
</p>
<p>of conversation the preacher remarked that it was his inten-
</p>
<p>tion to remove to another county and engage in stock-
</p>
<p>raising, and would do so as soon as he could sell or trade
</p>
<p>off the little farm on which he lived. " Wh}%" said Mr. Hay-
</p>
<p>den, " possibly you and I can make a trade. I have a stud-
</p>
<p>horse, and if you will take him in part pa}% we can trade
</p>
<p>without any doubt." " Well," said Jones, " I am wanting a
</p>
<p>stallion, and would as lief have him as money. What do
</p>
<p>you value him at, Mr. Hayden." " Five hundred dollars,"
</p>
<p>was the reply. " What do you ask for your farm," said
</p>
<p>Hayden. " One thousand dollars," was the reply. The
</p>
<p>trade was closed, and Hayden handed over to the preacher
</p>
<p>his horse and $500 in cash, and received a deed for the
</p>
<p>land. A year afterwards, Hayden went to see his farm, and
</p>
<p>learned to his astonishment that it was not worth 200.
</p>
<p>"Why," said he, " notliing will grow on the d  d place but
</p>
<p>jimson-weeds and cockle-burrs.
</p>
<p>The following anecdote exhibits Mr. Hayden in the role
</p>
<p>of a wit, and it is said that in repartee he was often very

</p>
<p>happy and pungent : Upon one occasion, while arguing a case
</p>
<p>in the Supreme Court, Judge Tompkins interrupted him by
</p>
<p>saying, " Why is it, Mr. Hayden, that you spend so much time
</p>
<p>in urging the weak points of your case, to the exclusion of the
</p>
<p>more important ones? " " Because," replied Mr. Hayden, " I
</p>
<p>64 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>find in my long practice in this court that the weak points
</p>
<p>win fully as often as the strong ones."
</p>
<p>Mr. Hayden seldom read anything outside of his profes-
</p>
<p>sion  not even a newspaper, and his imperfect knowledge of
</p>
<p>history and geography often gave rise to amusing mistakes.
</p>
<p>He and Abiel Leonard were once engaged on the same side
</p>
<p>in the trial of an important divorce case, in which a wit-
</p>
<p>ness who was a foreigner was introduced by the opposing
</p>
<p>counsel. Mr. Hayden was put forward to conduct the cross-
</p>
<p>examination, and, knowing the strong feeling which existed
</p>
<p>in the community against foreigners, inteirogated him as fol-
</p>
<p>lows : "State, if you please, sir, to what nationality you
</p>
<p>belong." "I am a Dane, sir." "You are a Dane, are you.
</p>
<p>Now, will you be so kind as to tell us when you left Dajw /"
</p>
<p>" I never left Dcdic, sir; I left Denmark.
</p>
<p>A loud laugh followed this reply, at the expense of Mr.
</p>
<p>Hayden, when Mr. Leonard, whispering into his ear, said,

</p>
<p>ALBERT G. HARRISON.
</p>
<p>In 1838 we made the acquaintance of this gentleman, who
</p>
<p>was then a member of Congress from Missouri, and a col-
</p>
<p>league of Governor John Miller. The state at that time was
</p>
<p>only entitled to two members, and they were elected under
</p>
<p>the general-ticket system.
</p>
<p>Mr. Harrison was born in INIount Sterling, Kentucky, on
</p>
<p>June 26, 1800. At the age of eighteen he entered the junior
</p>
<p>class of the Academical Department of Transylvania Univer-
</p>
<p>sity, and in 1820 took the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He
</p>
<p>made himself familiar with the French and Spanish languages,
</p>
<p>which proved very advantageous to him in the prosecution
</p>
<p>of his profession. After completing his course in college he
</p>
<p>entered the Law Department of the same university, and in
</p>
<p>1 82 1 obtained the degree of Bachelor of Laws, and entered
</p>
<p>upon the practice of the law in Mount Sterling.
</p>
<p>In 1827 he removed to Callaway County, Missouri, and
</p>
<p>settled in Fulton. In 1828 President Jackson appointed him
</p>
<p>one of the visitors to attend the annual examination at West
</p>
<p>Point. In 1829 he was appointed one of the commissioners
</p>
<p>to adjust the land-titles growing out of Spanish grants ; and
</p>
<p>after holding the office a few years, resigned and became a
</p>
<p>candidate for Congress, and was elected for two successive
</p>
<p>terms, but died in 1838, before the expiration of his last term.
</p>
<p>With his fine education, popular manners, and decided
</p>
<p>ability, he bid fair to become one of the most prominent men
</p>
<p>of the West ; but death, which too often seeks a shining
</p>
<p>mark, cut him off in the prime of life.
</p>
<p>As a member of Congress he was very devoted to the
</p>
<p>interests of his constituents, and, although he seldom par-
</p>
<p>ticipated in debate, was regarded as a rising member. Mr.
</p>
<p>Harrison was well read in his profession, but embarked too
</p>
<p>early in political life to distinguish himself as a lawyer,

</p>
<p>though it is said by his contemporaries that he evinced much
</p>
<p>skill in the trial of a cause, and by his pleasant, insinuating
</p>
<p>manner won the confidence and good-will of a jury. Prior
</p>
<p>to going to P"ulton he discharged the duties of register or
</p>
<p>receiver of the land-office at St. Louis, but for what length
</p>
<p>of time we are unadvised.
</p>
<p>He was a man of fine personal appearance, very attractive in
</p>
<p>his manners, and possessed rare conversational powers, which
</p>
<p>made him popular with the people, and gave him a passport
</p>
<p>to public favor. In his social relations he was affable, and
</p>
<p>generous to a fault, and when thrown among strangers made
</p>
<p>friends rapidly. We have conversed with several of the old
</p>
<p>citizens of Callaway, and they speak of him with much feel-
</p>
<p>ing and reverence.

<p>Richard S. Blannerhassett.
</p>
<p>This gentleman became greatly distinguished at the St.
</p>
<p>Louis bar as a criminal lawyer. He was born at Conway
</p>
<p>Castle, Killorglin, county of Kerry, Ireland, in May, i8ii.
</p>
<p>His mother was a second cousin of O'Connell, the famous
</p>
<p>Irish orator and agitator, and was also related by blood to
</p>
<p>the Spottswoods, of Virginia. His father, Edward Blanner-
</p>
<p>hassett, of Tralee, was first cousin of Herman Blannerhas-
</p>
<p>sett, noted for his participation in the Burr conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>whose beautiful island home on the Ohio has been made
</p>
<p>historic by the eloquence of William Wirt,
</p>
<p>The subject of this memoir received his early education
</p>
<p>at Tralee, under the superintendence of an elder brother,
</p>
<p>who was a graduate of Trinity College. While very young
</p>
<p>he often attended the Irish courts to hear his kinsman,
</p>
<p>O'Connell, and it is said that he then formed the determina-
</p>
<p>tion to become a lawyer. In 1831 he married Miss Byran,
</p>
<p>a great-granddaughter of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and in
</p>
<p>the same year came with his father and family to America;
</p>
<p>landed at Quebec, and traveled from thence to Guelph,
</p>
<p>in Upper Canada, and after remaining there a short time,
</p>
<p>returned to Hamilton, where young Blannerhassett opened a
</p>
<p>school. From there he went to Lockport, and finally settled
</p>
<p>in Attica, western New York, where he taught school and
</p>
<p>studied law at the same time.
</p>
<p>In 1835 he was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Gen-
</p>
<p>esee and the adjoining counties until 1841, when he deter-
</p>
<p>mined to make his home in the West, and left for St. Louis,
</p>
<p>and obtained a license there from Judge Bryan Mullanphy, on
</p>
<p>October 2d. Before leaving Genesee the bar at that place

<p>died December 25, 1857, in his forty-seventh year, leaving a
</p>
<p>widow and several children to mourn his loss. His disease
</p>
<p>was apoplexy. The St. Louis bar held a meeting and
</p>
<p>adopted a series of resolutions expressing their high appre-
</p>
<p>ciation of him.
</p>
<p>In the If'ish Nezvs, a paper published in the city of New
</p>
<p>York by General Thomas Francis Meagher, there appeared
</p>
<p>a notice of his death, v/ith the following tribute :
</p>
<p>"A gifted, popular, generous, and brilliant Irishman lies dead there on the
</p>
<p>banks of the glorious Mississippi, and we, his countrymen, bring to his grave
</p>
<p>the ivy, the sweet heath, arbutus leaves, and shamrocks of his native Kerry."

<p>Mr. Blannerhassett as a criminal lawyer has never been
</p>
<p>excelled at our bar. He was not as eloquent or as flowery
</p>
<p>in his declamation as Uriel Wright, but as a close, logical
</p>
<p>reasoner he was his superior. He had a fine command of
</p>
<p>language ; was a ready, graceful talker, and his speeches
</p>
<p>RICHARD S. BLANNERHASSETT. 69
</p>
<p>abounded in wit, irony, and sarcasm. One of his chief
</p>
<p>characteristics was his perfect command of temper, which
</p>
<p>always gave him an advantage over his opponents. No
</p>
<p>man excelled him in the analyzation of testimony, and no
</p>
<p>man was his equal in the cross-examination of a witness.
</p>
<p>If satisfied that the witness was honest and disposed to tell
</p>
<p>the truth, he let him off with a very few questions; but woe
</p>
<p>be to the witness who might attempt the perpetration of a
</p>
<p>falsehood. He was certain to be floored and exposed.
</p>
<p>Another peculiarity of Mr. Blannerhassett w^as his perfect
</p>
<p>self-possession. No unexpected development in the evi-
</p>
<p>dence disturbed him for a moment. Upon one occasion we
</p>
<p>happened to be present in the St. Louis Criminal Court
</p>
<p>when he was defending a young attorney  or, rather, shyster
</p>
<p> who was indicted for forging a deed in the name of a
</p>
<p>colored woman. The accused had an accomplice, who was
</p>
<p>then in jail for another offense, and Mr. Blannerhassett was
</p>
<p>advised by his client that his evidence was material to him.
</p>
<p>He visited his cell, had a conversation with him, and with
</p>
<p>some little hesitation concluded that his testimony might be
</p>
<p>useful to his client, and thereupon brought him into court to
</p>
<p>testify. Contrary to his expectation, and contrary to what
</p>
<p>he had a right to hope from the conversation in the cell, the
</p>
<p>witness testified strongly against his client. We glanced at
</p>
<p>Mr. Blannerhassett, without being able to detect in his
</p>
<p>features any evidence of his disappointment. We remarked
</p>
<p>to him, " Mr. Blannerhassett, you were sold that time ; how
</p>
<p>will you get around it?" He replied, "Yes, the d  d
</p>
<p>scoundrel sold me; but if you will wait a few minutes, you
</p>
<p>will see how I will meet it." We did wait, and when Mr.
</p>
<p>Blannerhassett, in his argument to the jur}', came to that
</p>
<p>part of the evidence, he said :
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen of the jury : You were no doubt surprised at my introducing as

<p>a witness A B. I had an object in view which I could not then disclose to you.
</p>
<p>I have long Ijeen satisfied that this witness was the man who forged the deed,
</p>
<p>and to satisfy you what a consummate liar and scoundrel he is, I brought him
</p>
<p>here that you might see him, and witness the coolness and deliberation with
</p>
<p>which he can tell a lie."
</p>
<p>As was his custom, he had a quid of tobacco in his mouth
</p>
<p>JO BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>and rolled it from one side to the other with as much appa-
</p>
<p>rent indifference as any casual spectator in the room. It is
</p>
<p>a great misfortune that none of Mr. Blannerhassett's argu-
</p>
<p>ments have been preserved. In this respect there has been
</p>
<p>a great and inexcusable negligence, not only in the West,
</p>
<p>but throughout the country.
</p>
<p>In the American Lmv Review for January, 1878, there is a
</p>
<p>communication by C. H. Hill, in which reference is made to
</p>
<p>a famous argument delivered by Mr. Sohier, of Boston, in
</p>
<p>1865, in the case of Sturtevant vs. Allen, which was an action
</p>
<p>for slander, with an allegation of special damage, tried in
</p>
<p>the Supreme Judicial Court, before Chief Justice Bigelow,
</p>
<p>and in which there was a verdict for the plaintiff for $32,000.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hill says :
</p>
<p>"Those members of the Boston bar who had the privilege of hearing, thirteen
</p>
<p>years ago, Mr. Sohier's argument in the case of Sturtevant 7'^". Allen, listened to
</p>
<p>a speech worthy to rank as a piece of invective with the great efforts of
</p>
<p>Brougham ; but, unlike Brougham's speeches, no report of it exists, and many
</p>
<p>of his brother lawyers never even heard of it."
</p>
<p>This omission to preserve a record of the great efforts of
</p>
<p>American lawyers affords no excuse whatever, and now,
</p>
<p>when it is too late, we begin to see the sad effects of our
</p>
<p>negligence.
</p>
<p>Soon after coming to the United States Mr. Blannerhassett
</p>
<p>united with the Democratic party, and, though he seldom
</p>
<p>became a candidate for office, was ever ready to aid the
</p>
<p>cause. He often addressed the people on the eve of an
</p>
<p>election, and his efforts met with great applause.
</p>
<p>Mr. Blannerhassett had his faults, the chief of which was
</p>
<p>the birth of his generous and social feelings. He took a deep
</p>
<p>interest in the poor, and was ever ready to engage in any
</p>
<p>undertaking for their benefit. It is stated that on one occa-
</p>
<p>sion, while visiting the jail, a prisoner complained of suffering

</p>
<p>from cold ; whereupon Mr. Blannerhassett took off his
</p>
<p>overcoat and handed it to him, and returned home without
</p>
<p>any. It affected him greatly to see any one in distress.
</p>
<p>We shall conclude this sketch with a reference to the let-
</p>
<p>ter of C. C. Simmons, Esq., a member of the St. Louis bar,
</p>
<p>RICHARD S. BLANK ERH ASS ETT. 7 1
</p>
<p>and also at one time a law-partner of Mr. Blannerhassett.
</p>
<p>He says :
</p>
<p>"During Mr. Blannerhassett's term as city counselor many important public
</p>
<p>matters came up, and his opinions in the same became the laws that govern
</p>
<p>the city's jurisdiction in regard to streets, alleys, etc., at the present day. His
</p>
<p>most important public service to the city of St. Louis (and the West generally),
</p>
<p>however, was rendered in what was known as the St. Clair County suit, the
</p>
<p>circumstances of which were these: During Judge Krum's term of office as
</p>
<p>mayor the city of St. Louis decided on filling up the river on the Illinois side
</p>
<p>of Bloody Island. St. Clair County issued an injunction, which stopped the
</p>
<p>work. The case was decided in favor of the city of St. Louis in the St. Clair
</p>
<p>County Circuit Court, and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Illi-
</p>
<p>nois, where, after several days' argument, it was decided that the work inaugu-
</p>
<p>rated by the city of St. Louis could be carried on only by a special act of the
</p>
<p>Legislature of Illinois. Mr. Blannerhassett's argument before the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of Illinois has been cited as the finest ever listened to in that state. He
</p>
<p>remained in Springfield six weeks after the decision of the court, and succeeded
</p>
<p>in having the Legislature pass the required act. The benefits arising to St.
</p>
<p>Louis and Illinois were depicted by Mr. Blannerhassett in his argument before
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court, and prophecies made for the future, many of which have
</p>
<p>been verified  the connecting of the Illinois shore with Blooily Island having
</p>
<p>fulfilled all that he believed it would. Mr. Blannerhassett's salary at that time
</p>
<p>\vas $600 per annum; for this additional service the city paid him $500. Fees
</p>
<p>of thousands of dollars have been paid by the city, within the last few years,
</p>
<p>for services that bear no comparison with this.
</p>
<p>"One of the most important criminal cases defended by Mr. Blannerhassett
</p>
<p>was that of McLean, for the murder of Colonel Floyd, who resided in what
</p>
<p>was then a wilderness, but is now known as Cote Brilliant. Five men visited
</p>
<p>this gentleman's house at midnight for the purpose of robbery. Colonel Floyd
</p>
<p>was shot and lived thirty-six hours, declaring before his death that McLean was
</p>
<p>his murderer  he having been employed on the place two weeks previously in
</p>
<p>digging a well. Mrs. Floyd, whose life was spared, testified to the identity of
</p>
<p>one of the other men, Johnson, and upon her testimony he was executed. Mr.

</p>
<p>Blannerhassett always contended that neither Johnson nor McLean were among
</p>
<p>the five men; one of whom was a desperate character known as ' Buffalo Bill,'
</p>
<p>another, McCauley, and still another. Perry, byname; the names of the other
</p>
<p>two cannot be recalled. The case of McLean, which is a remarkable one, first
</p>
<p>came up for trial in the fall of 1842, the opening speech being made by Mr.
</p>
<p>Blannerhassett's partner, Mr. Simmons, and resulted in a verdict of guilty of
</p>
<p>murder in the first degree, and sentenced to be executed on March 17th, Saint
</p>
<p>Patrick's day. Mr. Blannerhassett declared no Irish client of his could be
</p>
<p>hanged on Saint Patrick's day; 'they shall hang me first.' He therefore
</p>
<p>carried the case to the Supreme Court, and gained a new trial. On the second
</p>
<p>trial seven of the jury were for conviction, five for acquittal. A third trial took
</p>
<p>place in the first week of August, 1844, when ten of the jury were for convic-
</p>
<p>tion, two for acquittal  having been out four days. A fourtli trial took place
</p>
<p>J 2 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>in April, 1S45. In closing the case, Mr. Blannerhassett's address to the jury
</p>
<p>was a model, his full power being brought to bear. It was a pleasant April
</p>
<p>evening ; the jury left the box, remaining out long enough to take tea, returned,
</p>
<p>and gave a verdict of 'not guilty.'
</p>
<p>"Another important case was that of the robbery of the State Bank of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri by its cashier, Nathaniel Childs. Mr. Blannerhassett cleared Childs on
</p>
<p>the plea that the bank could not prove the loss of any money. The O'Blenis
</p>
<p>case was another of Mr. lilannerhassett's best efforts ; where he tiiwarted tiie
</p>
<p>gallows, O'Blenis being sentenced to the penitentiary for ten years. In the
</p>
<p>year 1850, for services rendered the citizens of the First Ward, an elegant solid
</p>
<p>silver pitcher was presented to Mr. Blannerhassett. This was a contest between
</p>
<p>the owners of Duncan's Island and the city, in which the latter was victorious.
</p>
<p>' In 1849, when the cholera was raging with violence, Mr. Blannerhassett was
</p>
<p>one of twelve citizens who volunteered as a sanitary committee, both to suppress
</p>
<p>the disease and to relieve the suffering consequent upon the scourge. Mr. Blan-
</p>
<p>nerhassett worked faitlifully from attic to cellar, nursing the sick, bringing out
</p>
<p>the dead, and taking no heed or care of his own life. In May of the same year
</p>
<p>the 'great fire' took place, which added to the distressed condition of the city.
</p>
<p>As a member of the Board of Aldermen, Mr. Blannerhassett advised the issuing
</p>
<p>by the city of $50,000 in bonds, to meet the exigencies at hand  taking the risk
</p>
<p>of the Legislature sanctioning the act when they should again convene.

<p>"It is needless to add the Legislature did approve the act."
</p>
<p>James Evans.
</p>
<p>To show how rapidly men pass from our recollection, we
</p>
<p>question whether a dozen persons outside of the old Ninth
</p>
<p>Judicial Circuit can be found who ever knew that there was
</p>
<p>such a judge in the state as James Evans; yet he presided
</p>
<p>at one time over one of the oldest and most important cir-
</p>
<p>cuits in the state.
</p>
<p>He was a Virginian by birth, and came to the territory
</p>
<p>before the admission of Missouri as a state ; for in 1 818-19
</p>
<p>he had a fair practice in south-eastern Missouri, and for
</p>
<p>a time was brigadier-general in the state militia ; and, if we
</p>
<p>mistake not, a member of the Convention called to frame
</p>
<p>our state Constitution. He was considered at one time a
</p>
<p>very fair lawyer, fully equal to the average of attorneys, but
</p>
<p>soon became very dissipated, lost his practice, and was re-
</p>
<p>duced to indigence and poverty.
</p>
<p>About the year 1842 the death of Judge David Sterigere
</p>
<p>created a vacancy on the bench of the Ninth Circuit, which
</p>
<p>was filled by the appointment of Mr. Evans. We well
</p>
<p>recollect the circumstances under which he was elevated to
</p>
<p>the bench, for Governor Thomas Reynolds, who then occu-
</p>
<p>pied the executive chair, did us the honor to consult us
</p>
<p>about it. Party spirit then ran very high throughout the state,
</p>
<p>and the Democrats when united could claim a majority of
</p>
<p>only about 5,000, which caused the opposition to make a good
</p>
<p>fight at every election. Governor Reynolds, though a man
</p>
<p>of ability, and who had made a good judge both in this state
</p>
<p>and Illinois, was yet a timid politician, and always afraid of
</p>
<p>being charged with a want of fealty to his party. He sent
</p>
<p>for us and expressed great embarrassment with respect to
</p>
<p>filling the vacancy. There were but two Democratic lawyers
</p>
<p>in the circuit who were eligible, and neither was fit for the

</p>
<p>place ; and he was apprehensive that if he selected one from
</p>
<p>74 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>the opposite party, he would subject himself to the censure
</p>
<p>of his political friends. We candidly told him tliat in our
</p>
<p>judgment he had but one course to pursue. If he was un-
</p>
<p>able to find a suitable man in his own party, he should select
</p>
<p>the best man he could obtain from the opposition. He then
</p>
<p>requested us to name a man, and we gave the names of
</p>
<p>Philip Cole and Mason Frizell, of Washington County, either
</p>
<p>of whom we thought would make a good judge  giving the
</p>
<p>preference, however, to Mr. Cole, as the oldest and more ex-
</p>
<p>perienced of the two. He acquiesced in our views, and we
</p>
<p>left him, fully satisfied that Mr. Cole would receive the ap-
</p>
<p>pointment. Another reason for supposing that our recom-
</p>
<p>mendation would exercise an influence ^\ith the governor
</p>
<p>was that, in the Convention which nominated him, we (as a
</p>
<p>delegate) gave him a warm support; but, contrary to our
</p>
<p>expectations, he appointed Mr. Evans, who had not practiced
</p>
<p>law for nearly a quarter of a century, and whose dissipated
</p>
<p>habits rendered him totally unfit for the place. His judicial
</p>
<p>career was short, but it gave rise to many amusing incidents.
</p>
<p>Before opening his court in the morning he generally took
</p>
<p>aboard about a pint of whisky, and if he exceeded that, his
</p>
<p>mind became confused, and the only thing he seemed to
</p>
<p>recollect with much distinctness was the mode and manner
</p>
<p>of passing sentence upon prisoners. At a term of the Perry
</p>
<p>court an intoxicated man came into the court-room, and, by
</p>
<p>loud talking, disturbed his honor. Judge Evans directed
</p>
<p>the sheriff to put him out, which was promptly done. Be-
</p>
<p>fore adjourning his court in the evening he told the sheriff
</p>
<p>that he thought it was his duty to impose some punishment
</p>
<p>upon the offender, and directed that officer to hunt him up
</p>
<p>and bring him into court the next morning. At the opening
</p>
<p>of the court the next day the man was brought in, far more
</p>
<p>sober than the judge, and the following scene took place:

<p>" Prisoner, you came into this court yesterday in an
</p>
<p>intoxicated condition, and, by loud and profane language,
</p>
<p>greatly disturbed the proceedings ; and I have sent for you
</p>
<p>to impose such punishment as your conduct deserves. The
</p>
<p>court is informed that you are poor, and have a large family

<p>dependent upon your labor for support, in consideration of
</p>
<p>which you will be treated with much clemency and forbear-
</p>
<p>ance. Hold up your right hand. It is the judgment of this
</p>
<p>court that you be fined one dollar, and imprisoned in the
</p>
<p>county jail one hour; and may God Almighty have mercy on
</p>
<p>your soul."
</p>
<p>Upon another occasion one of the attorneys was guilty of
</p>
<p>a contempt of court, and, refusing to purge himself, the
</p>
<p>judge imposed upon him a fine of i cent, and imprisonment
</p>
<p>in the county jail until the fine was paid ; and concluded
</p>
<p>his sentence by saying, "And may this be a warning to you
</p>
<p>for all time to come.'''
</p>
<p>After the close of his judicial career he went to Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky, where he died. It was said that his domestic rela-
</p>
<p>tions were not of the happiest kind, which his friends
</p>
<p>assigned as one cause for his dissipated habits. He first
</p>
<p>located in Jackson, and later in life took up his residence in

<p>Perryville.
</p>
<p>Mason Frizell.
</p>
<p>]Mr. Frizell was a practicing lawyer for at least thirty years
</p>
<p>in Potosi, Washington County. He was a native of ]\Iassa-
</p>
<p>chusetts, and studied law part of his time with Philip Cole,
</p>
<p>of Potosi, and the remainder with Edward Bates, of St. Louis.
</p>
<p>He practiced in the Ninth Circuit until 1862, when Gov^er-
</p>
<p>nor Gamble appointed him judge of the St. Francois Circuit,
</p>
<p>which position he held till his death, in 1865. About 1863
</p>
<p>he took up his residence in Cape Girardeau County.
</p>
<p>He was a man of powerful frame, and had he been trained
</p>
<p>as a prize-fighter, would have proved a dangerous antagonist
</p>
<p>in the ring. His head was nearly a third larger than the aver-
</p>
<p>age man, his hands and feet of enormous dimensions, and
</p>
<p>his movements awkward and ungraceful, and by no means
</p>
<p>calculated to impress a stranger favorably ; and probably
</p>
<p>for this reason he seldom indulged in the society of ladies.
</p>
<p>Judge Frizell was well read in his profession, and yet, as
</p>
<p>a iiisi-pnus law\-er, a failure. He had but little, if any, com-
</p>
<p>mand of language, and no power to entertain a jury or audi-
</p>
<p>ence ; and in the trial of a cause manifested an utter want of
</p>
<p>tact and management. He was much better fitted for an
</p>
<p>office lawyer, and those who knew him well, appreciated him
</p>
<p>ver}' highly as a counselor and legal adviser. His briefs
</p>
<p>in the Supreme Court show much research and investigation,
</p>
<p>and whatever success he had was in that tribunal. He was
</p>
<p>an unassuming man, and one of his greatest drawbacks was
</p>
<p>a want of confidence in himself. Though a man of strong dis-
</p>
<p>likes and prejudices, he seldom became invoh'ed in a personal
</p>
<p>difficulty.
</p>
<p>After passing the meridian of life he was appointed, as
</p>
<p>before stated, a judge of one of the south-eastern circuits,
</p>
<p>and in that capacity was far more successful. His mind was

<p>There are few duties resting on mankind more sacred, and
</p>
<p>yet more generally neglected, than that of preserving a rec-
</p>
<p>ord of the lives and deeds of those who have gone before
</p>
<p>us, and who have devoted their days to the public welfare.
</p>
<p>How few can now be found who ever heard of the subject
</p>
<p>of this sketch ; yet he was one of the most profound lawyers
</p>
<p>of early Missouri, and has left the impress of his mind upon
</p>
<p>the laws, statutes, and institutions of our state.
</p>
<p>He was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, on May 4, 1774,
</p>
<p>little over a century ago. He came into life upon the dawn
</p>
<p>of our independence, and might properly have been called a
</p>
<p>child of that new birth which gave a new world to the down-
</p>
<p>trodden subjects of old empires. Of the parentage of Mr.
</p>
<p>Easton we know but little, but they were of English descent,
</p>
<p>and some of the family rendered good service in the Revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary War. It does not appear that young Easton was a
</p>
<p>graduate of any of our colleges, but he received a good
</p>
<p>education preparatory to entering upon the study of the
</p>
<p>law.
</p>
<p>When eighteen years of age, and in Februar}^ ^79^> 1''^
</p>
<p>became a student in the office of Ephraim Kirby, a promi-
</p>
<p>nent law}xr of Litchfield, and remained with him two years.
</p>
<p>He completed his studies elsewhere, but on reaching maturity
</p>
<p>obtained a license to practice in Connecticut. To what
</p>
<p>extent, if any, he practiced in that state is unknown, but at
</p>
<p>the opening of, or immediately preceding, the present century
</p>
<p>we find him at Rome, Oneida County, New York, where he
</p>
<p>soon became known as a promising young lawyer, anci
</p>
<p>attracted the attention of the prominent men of the Repub-
</p>
<p>lican party, as will appear from the following letter addressed

<p>to him by Gideon Granger, postmaster-general under Mr,
</p>
<p>RUFUS E AS TON. 79
</p>
<p>Jefferson, and a man of transcendent ability. The letter
</p>
<p>bears date April 23, 1802, and is as follows:*
</p>
<p>"General Post-office, April 2j, 1802.
</p>
<p>" Sir : Yours of the 5th of April is received. Samuel Carrington, late post-
</p>
<p>master at Utica, resigned his office on the 9th of March, and nominated John
</p>
<p>Carrington as his successor. I endeavored to procure a nomination from your
</p>
<p>delegates. Not meeting with success, and fearing the public service might
</p>
<p>suffer, some time afterwards before the receipt of your letter, I appointed John
</p>
<p>Harrington postmaster at that place. The case of Elizur Mossley shall be
</p>
<p>considered. You recommend Samuel Starr as postmaster for Rome, yet state
</p>
<p>no objections against the present postmaster. It has not been, and it is not
</p>
<p>my wish or design, to remove a postmaster who is fair and impartial in the
</p>
<p>discharge of his duties, and who enjoys the confidence of his fellow-men.

</p>
<p>It is apparent from this letter that the authorities at Wash-
</p>
<p>ington were accustomed to confer with Mr. Easton in regard
</p>
<p>to the appointments for western New York. Mr. Easton
</p>
<p>spent the winter of 1803-4 in Washington City, and the
</p>
<p>subject of the approaching presidential election was begin-
</p>
<p>ning to excite the public mind. DeWitt Clinton, of New
</p>
<p>York, then regarded as the foremost of American statesmen,
</p>
<p>was prominently mentioned as a candidate, and was in cor-
</p>
<p>respondence with the leading men of the Republican party.
</p>
<p>The following letter addressed by him to Colonel Easton
</p>
<p>(the original being in our possession) shows that he was in
</p>
<p>confidential communication with him :
</p>
<p>"Newtown / Sept. iSoj.
</p>
<p>"Sir: As you propose to visit the Seat of Govt, and as we are yet in the
</p>
<p>dark as to the arrangements that will be made on the subject mentioned in your
</p>
<p>letter, it will neither be necessary nor practicable for me to enter into any spe-
</p>
<p>cific detail, but as you will be there in person it will be in your po\s er to watch

<p>It was during that winter in Washington that Mr. Easton
</p>
<p>determined upon changing his residence to New Orleans,
</p>
<p>and left Washington in the early part of March, 1804, with
</p>
<p>the following letter of recommendation from Colonel Aaron
</p>
<p>]^urr to Mr. Ellery, of New Orleans (the original in our
</p>
<p>possession) :
</p>
<p>"Washington // March 1S04.
</p>
<p>"Dear Sir : I lil<e thai my friends shoukl 1)C kncjwn to each other, & hav-
</p>
<p>ing had reason to rank Mr. Easton in that number, he is introduced to you as such.
</p>
<p>\^ou will certainly be greatly amused to converse with a man who has passed
</p>
<p>the whole winter in this city  who has had free intercourse with the officers of
</p>
<p>Govt. iS; members of Congress-  who has discernment to see beyond the
</p>
<p>surface, and frankness and independence enough to speak his own sentiments.
</p>
<p>Mr. E. is this man. He has practiced law- several years with reputation in the
</p>
<p>interior of our state. Born and educated in N. England. He goes to try his for-
</p>
<p>tune at the liar in Louisiana. I recommend him to your notice and accjuaintance.
</p>
<p>"Your friend & svt.
</p>
<p>"A. Burr.
</p>
<p>" Al'/ii. A'. Ellery Esq.
</p>
<p>"N. Orleans:'
</p>
<p>This letter was never presented ; for Mr. Easton, after
</p>
<p>leaving Washington, concluded to locate at Vincennes, In-
</p>
<p>diana Territory, and obtained a license there to practice, but
</p>
<p>could not have remained long, for in the same year he lo-
</p>
<p>cated at St. Louis, which became his permanent residence
</p>
<p>until within a few years of his death, when he removed to
</p>
<p>St. Charles. Mr. Easton again visited Washington City in
</p>
<p>the winter of 1804-5, '^^'^'^ received considerable attention
</p>
<p>from men of prominence.
</p>
<p>It was during that winter that Colonel Burr made his ar-
</p>
<p>rangements to carry into effect his favorite project of estab-
</p>
<p>lishing a western empire, to embrace Mexico and the west-
</p>
<p>ern states and territories, with New Orleans for its capital.

<p>He no doubt then calculated upon the cooperation of Easton ;
</p>
<p>and, to increase Easton's influence, joined Granger and others
</p>
<p>in procuring for him the appointment of judge of the territory
</p>
<p>of Louisiana ; for on March 13, 1805, Easton's commission as
</p>
<p>such was signed by Mr. Jefferson, and five days afterwards
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr addressed the following letter to him :
</p>

<p>" ^VASHI^(;TO^ iS Mar. jSoj
</p>
<p>" Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>"You will have heard before this can reach you of your appointment to
</p>
<p>the office of Judge of the new Territory of Louisiana  This event gave me
</p>
<p>the utmost pleasure as well on your account as on that of several of my
</p>
<p>friends, who are about to remove thither 
</p>
<p>" The Gov Genl Wilkinson has been long my intimate friend, and Doctor
</p>
<p>Browne the Secretary is my near relative  You will be much gratified by the
</p>
<p>accjuaintance of these two gentlemen, and I shall take care to inspire them
</p>
<p>with a wish for your friendship & esteem.
</p>
<p>"I enclose you copies of the two acts which immediately respect your Ter-
</p>
<p>ritory, which I suppose to be the most acceptable thing I could send.
</p>
<p>" It is probable that I shall float down the Ohio & the Mississippi this
</p>
<p>season, & possible that I may visit Kas Kaskia & St. Louis 
</p>
<p>"At all times & in all places be assured of my great regard & esteem.
</p>
<p>" A. Burr.
</p>
<p>" The Hon Riifits Easfon.''
</p>
<p>There was nothing in this letter calculated to awaken any
</p>
<p>suspicion in the mind of Judge Easton as to Burr's designs,
</p>
<p>but he interpreted it, as well as several invitations previously
</p>
<p>sent to breakfast and dine with him (which we also have), as
</p>
<p>mere evidences of a friendly feeling, and a wish to promote
</p>
<p>his welfare ; but taken in connection with subsequent events,
</p>
<p>and Burr's travels through the West, the letter is of the
</p>
<p>utmost importance as foreshadowing the plot and conspiracy
</p>
<p>against the government, for which Burr was tried at Rich-
</p>
<p>mond.
</p>
<p>To properly understand the bearing of these letters and
</p>
<p>others which will follow, it becomes necessary to state, for
</p>
<p>the benefit of such of our readers as may not be fully posted
</p>
<p>in the history of the famous conspiracy, that after the fatal
</p>
<p>duel with Hamilton, in July, 1804, Colonel Burr left New
</p>
<p>York to avoid an arrest, and traveled until the meeting of

<p>Congress, in December following, when he repaired to
</p>
<p>Washington and took his seat as presiding officer of the
</p>
<p>Senate. It was during that winter that he planned his
</p>
<p>famous project of a western empire, and as his term of office
</p>
<p>of vice-president would expire by limitation on March 4, 1805,
</p>
<p>he, two days previously, took leave of the Senate in a speech
</p>
<p>which created a profound sensation. He was at that time,
</p>
<p>however, a bankrupt in fortune and politics, and saw in his

</p>
<p>contemplated revolution the only hope of again rising to the
</p>
<p>surface. His inordinate ambition rose far above any patri-
</p>
<p>otic feeling that ever animated his breast.
</p>
<p>At this time he was on the most intimate terms with Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Wilkinson, commander-in-chief of the army, and who, at
</p>
<p>the close of the session of Congress just referred to, was
</p>
<p>appointed governor of the territor}- of Louisiana. He and
</p>
<p>Wilkinson were in the expedition against Quebec in the
</p>
<p>winter of 1775-6, and for many years afterwards carried on
</p>
<p>an intimate and confidential correspondence. To hope for
</p>
<p>any success in liis treasonable undertaking, it was indispen-
</p>
<p>sably necessary that he should have the cooperation of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, which he no doubt obtained, as will appear from
</p>
<p>the evidences we hereafter give; but \\hen Wilkinson saw
</p>
<p>that exposure was inevitable, to save himself he turned
</p>
<p>against Burr, and placed in the hands of the government the
</p>
<p>cipher letter sent from Burr to Wilkinson, of which V/ilkin-
</p>
<p>son alone had the key, and which furnished the chief evi-
</p>
<p>dence against Burr upon his trial for treason. (See Appen-
</p>
<p>dix for a copy of this letter.) On leaving Washington at the
</p>
<p>end of his official term. Colonel Burr went to Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>and on April lOth left Philadelphia on horseback for Pitts-
</p>
<p>burg, and from there he proceeded by flat-boat down the
</p>
<p>Ohio River and landed at Marietta, just below which was
</p>
<p>Blannerhassett's Island, the home of an educated and ac-
</p>
<p>complished Irishman, whose wealth enabled him to entertain
</p>
<p>in a princely style. His \\'ife was a lad)' of beauty and re-
</p>
<p>finement, and possessing an ambition not usual in her sex,
</p>
<p>readily induced her husband to cooperate with Burr, who
</p>
<p>was then her guest, and whose fascinating manners com-
</p>
<p>pletely won her admiration and esteem. From that time
</p>
<p>Burr frequently visited her island home, which was described
</p>
<p>by Mr. Wirt as a heavenly paradise, and there he concocted

</p>
<p>From there he visited Cincinnati and Louisville, and at the

</p>
<p>In June he descended the Cumberland River, and resumed
</p>
<p>his voyage down the Ohio, and at Fort Massac, just below the
</p>
<p>mouth of the Cumberland, he again met Wilkinson, who gave
</p>
<p>him letters of introduction to persons in New Orleans, and
</p>
<p>fitted him out with an elegant barge, in which he proceeded to
</p>
<p>that city. On June 25, 1805, he landed in New Orleans, then
</p>
<p>a cit)- of about 9,000 inhabitants, and composed chiefly of
</p>
<p>French Creoles. Burr remained three weeks in New Orleans,
</p>
<p>where he was feasted with banquets, balls, and dinners. He
</p>
<p>went from New Orleans to Nashville in July, and again
</p>
<p>became a guest of General Jackson, and from there he pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to Louisville, Frankfort, and Lexington, and from
</p>
<p>Kentucky went to St. Louis, where he again met General
</p>
<p>Wilkinson. While, however, at Tennessee Ferry, Burr ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to Easton the following letter :
</p>
<p>' TflNNESSEE P'ERRY, JO flllv, iSoj.
</p>
<p> Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>"Your two very kind (S; friendly letters have been reed. One at Orleans
</p>
<p>& the other on my return last week through Natchez. It gave nie very great
</p>
<p>pleasure to be assured of your health & of the continuance of your friend-
</p>
<p>ship. Having barely time to salute you & to thank you for your letters I must
</p>
<p>defer till a more fit occasion to reply to them. Yet I hope to see you at .St.
</p>
<p>Louis early in Sept. In the meantime address to me at Lexington whither I
</p>
<p>am now bound.
</p>
<p> With great respect & attachment

<p> Hon. Judge Easton.''''
</p>
<p>In June preceding, however, Burr was at Massac, a govern-
</p>
<p>ment fort on the Ohio, just below the mouth of the Cumber-
</p>
<p>land River, and, in anticipation of his visit to St. Louis, was
</p>
<p>anxious to establish a good understanding between Easton and
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson, who was also governor of the territory,

</p>
<p>and for that purpose addressed to Easton a letter, the fac-
</p>
<p>simile of which we here give :
</p>
<p>" Massac, June 7, 180^.
</p>
<p>"Dear Sir: Before leaving Washington I transmitted you copies of such
</p>
<p>laws as I thought might amuse or interest you, accompanied by a few lines the
</p>
<p>principal object of which was to promote a friendship and mutual confidence
</p>
<p>between you and Governor Wilkinson. I have this object so much at heart, and

</p>
<p>deem il sd iniijortant to you, thnl I lake tlic liberty ngain to repeal and urge it.
</p>
<p>The governor is a man of higli sense of honor, of delicate feelings, and warm
</p>
<p>sentiments. A frank, ingenuous deportment on your part cannot fail to attach
</p>
<p>him. He is disposed to be useful to you, and will have it greatly in his power.
</p>
<p>I have prepared the way for you by exciting prepossessions in your favor, which
</p>
<p>you must foster.
</p>
<p>"The governor is intimately informed of the views of the executive. You
</p>
<p>need not be told that your standing with the administration will depend on
</p>
<p>the zeal and ability with which you shall promote those views.
</p>
<p>" I hope to see you in [or at] St. Louis in August or September, when il will
</p>
<p>afford me the highest gratification to find you, not only in harmony, but in con-
</p>
<p>fidence and friendship, with the governor.
</p>
<p>" Accept my assurance of the great respect and regard with which I am
</p>
<p>" Your friend and servant,
</p>
<p>"A. Burr.
</p>
<p>"The Hon. R. Eastonr
</p>
<p>That Wilkinson, who as before stated was then, not only
</p>
<p>governor of Louisiana Territory, but commander-in-chief of
</p>
<p>the United States army, was in full accord with Burr, aiding
</p>
<p>and assisting in the conspiracy, -cannot be well doubted, and
</p>
<p>the object of the meeting in St. Louis was to prepare the
</p>
<p>minds of the people for the contemplated movement, and to
</p>
<p>enlist in tlie cause Easton and other prominent men of the
</p>
<p>territory.
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Upper Louisiana were mostly creole
</p>
<p>French, and had just been transferred to the United States
</p>
<p>by treaty of 1803, and it was naturally supposed that they
</p>
<p>preferred a monarchy or empire to our form of government.
</p>
<p>It is certainly true that they opposed the change of govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and though the purchase of the territory from France
</p>
<p>by the United States immediately doubled the value of their
</p>
<p>possessions, yet they expressed much dissatisfaction and dis-
</p>
<p>content.

<p>Of this fact Burr and Wilkinson were well advised, and
</p>
<p>had nothing to fear but the opposition of the leading

<p>Americans.
</p>
<p>Burr came to St. Louis in September  found Wilkinson
</p>
<p>there awaiting him ; and soon had a conference with Easton

<p>and others which satisfied them that Easton would prove
</p>
<p>hostile to their plans ; so they refused to confide in him, and

<p>that ended all further conference so far as Easton was con-
</p>
<p>cerned.
</p>
<p>The latter at that time was boarding with the father of
</p>
<p>General Bernard Pratt, and Burr visited him at his room.
</p>
<p>Pratt then resided in a one-story house on the north-east
</p>
<p>corner of Market and Main Streets, built in old French
</p>
<p>style, with broad porches all around it. Before calling at
</p>
<p>Easton's room, however. Burr and Wilkinson visited the
</p>
<p>quarters and encampment of the United States soldiers at
</p>
<p>Bellefontaine, about ten miles north of St. Louis.
</p>
<p>After Burr left St. Louis, Wilkinson expressed a strong
</p>
<p>dislike for Easton, and was instrumental in circulating against
</p>
<p>him charges of official corruption, which he and others man-
</p>
<p>aged to bring to the ears of the president ; and when Easton's
</p>
<p>commission expired, Mr. Jefferson nominated another person
</p>
<p>to his office.
</p>
<p>Judge Easton immediately repaired to Washington, and
</p>
<p>sent a communication to the president, asking to be furnished
</p>
<p>with the charges made against him ; to which Mr. Jefferson
</p>
<p>replied, defining his policy in reference to appointments.
</p>
<p>We found this letter in a bundle of papers which Colonel
</p>
<p>Easton had carefully laid away, and which had not seen the
</p>
<p>light for seventy-two years. It is in Mr. Jefferson's hand-
</p>
<p>writing, and is important as defining the policy of his admin-
</p>
<p>istration in reference to applicants for oflfice. As there is
</p>
<p>no letter of his extant bearing so directly upon the subject,
</p>
<p>we here give a fac-simile of it :
</p>
<p>"Washington, February 22, 1S06.

</p>

</p>
<p>However, if you think proper to call on me, I will verbally state to you two
</p>
<p>or three facts, and hear anything you may wish to say respecting them. It is
</p>
<p>the first time it has ever been asked, and is most probably the last time it

<p>" Air. Eastoii."^
</p>
<p>Easton called upon him the next day, and the president
</p>
<p>doubtless became satisfied that the charges were unfounded,
</p>
<p>for, though he declined to reappoint him to the judgeship of
</p>
<p>the territory, he gave him the office of United States attor-
</p>
<p>ney.
</p>
<p>Gideon Granger, who was postmaster-general under Mr.
</p>
<p>Jefferson, was one of the most profound men of his day, and
</p>
<p>exhibited a strong friendship for Colonel Easton, resulting in
</p>
<p>a friendly and interesting correspondence between them.
</p>
<p>Some of his letters to Colonel Easton will be found in the
</p>
<p>Appendix. One of them bearing date December 5, 1806,
</p>
<p>written during the excitement of the Burr conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>shortly after learning that Colonel Easton was about to
</p>
<p>engage in a duel, is so interesting, and characteristic of
</p>
<p>Granger, that we are induced to give a fac-simile of it. The
</p>
<p>original, now in our possession, we found among Colonel
</p>
<p>Easton's papers, and it is not probable that it ever met
</p>
<p>the gaze of human eye after it was filed away, until we took
</p>
<p>it from a carefully tied-up bundle. A part of the old wax seal
</p>
<p>is attached, and it bears the frank of the postmaster-general,
</p>
<p>and is addressed as follows :

<p>and adhered to the wax, and upon it is the name Catali)ie,

</p>
<p>88 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>According to Mr. Granger's letter of December 5, 1806,
</p>
<p>the Burr conspiracy in an authentic shape was first made
</p>
<p>known to the president on October 16, 1806. A Cabinet
</p>
<p>meeting was immediately called, and steps taken to bring
</p>
<p>the conspirators to trial. Burr's movements were watched
</p>
<p>closely, and all officers of the government were called u pon to
</p>
<p>gTvFim information in their possession. A correspondence
</p>
<p>passed between Colonel Easton and the government, and
</p>
<p>the colonel frankly disclosed all the information he had been
</p>
<p>able to obtain. As early as January, 1805, he wrote to the
</p>
<p>president, in which he referred to the opposition of the
</p>
<p>inhabitants to a change of government, and their strong
</p>
<p>attachment to a monarchy or empire. He mentions the fact
</p>
<p>that when a rumor prevailed that there was to be a recession
</p>
<p>to Spain, joy gladdened their hearts. He expresses the
</p>
<p>belief that a traitorous project to divide the Union had
</p>
<p>existed for some time amongst influential characters of the
</p>
<p>Union. He had been conscious of the project for more than
</p>
<p>a year. On October 20, 1805, he wrote to the president
</p>
<p>" that General Wilkinson had put himself at the head of a
</p>
<p>party of a few individuals who were hostile to the best in-
</p>
<p>terests of America."
</p>
<p>We hope to find room in the Appendix for several ol these
</p>
<p>letters, and a few others from Burr, Granger, Clinton, Cal-
</p>
<p>houn, and others, addressed to Colonel Easton. In 1808
</p>
<p>the first post-office in St. Louis was established, and Colonel
</p>
<p>Easton became the first postmaster, proving conclusively
</p>
<p>that the government continued to repose the utmost confi-
</p>
<p>dence in his patriotism and integrity.
</p>
<p>During this time he was actively engaged in the practice
</p>
<p>of his profession, and became the leading lawyer of the ter-
</p>
<p>ritory, and enjoyed the most lucrative practice at the bar.
</p>
<p>He was more noted for the soundness and vigor of his intel-

</p>
<p>lect than for impassioned eloquence, though he was not with-
</p>
<p>out many of the graces of oratory. His perceptive faculties
</p>
<p>were strong, and he expressed himself with a logical clearness
</p>
<p>and force that always favorably impressed his hearers. He
</p>
<p>would have been esteemed a strong debater at any bar. In
</p>
<p>jRUFCS E AS TON. 89
</p>
<p>the argument of a question of law, he evinced so much candor
</p>
<p>and plausibiHty that it required an ingenious argument, well
</p>
<p>supported by authority, to overthrow his proposition. But
</p>
<p>his chief excellence consisted in his fine executive and ad-
</p>
<p>ministrative ability. He filled the offices of judge, United
</p>
<p>States attorney, delegate in Congress, and postmaster of
</p>
<p>St. Louis with great ability. No matter in what position
</p>
<p>of trust he was placed, he seemed to comprehend with great
</p>
<p>facilit}' its duties and obligations.
</p>
<p>From the time he came to the territory his popularity and
</p>
<p>influence gradually increased, and in 18 14 he was elected
</p>
<p>a delegate to Congress from the territory, and continued
</p>
<p>such for a period of four years. Upon the organization of
</p>
<p>the state government, in i82i,hewas appointed attorney-
</p>
<p>general, and continued in that office until sometime in 1826.
</p>
<p>He died in St. Charles, July 5, 1834, and his remains
</p>
<p>repose in Lindenwood Cemetery.
</p>
<p>Colonel Easton left a large family, including seven
</p>
<p>daughters, one of whom married Hon. Thomas L. Ander-
</p>
<p>son, of Palmyra; another became the wife of Hon. Henry
</p>
<p>S. Geyer; a third one married Archibald Gamble, Esq.,
</p>
<p>brother of Governor Gamble ; another, who recently died at
</p>
<p>a very advanced age, was the wife of Major Sibley, of St.
</p>
<p>Charles. When but fourteen years of age, she traveled on
</p>
<p>horseback from St. Louis to Washington City in company
</p>
<p>with her father. She was a lady of fine literary taste, and
</p>
<p>jointly with her husband founded and endowed the Linden -
</p>
<p>wood Female Seminary at St. Charles, which became noted
</p>
<p>as an institution of learning.
</p>
<p>His son Colonel Alton R. Easton is still a resident of St.
</p>
<p>Louis, and is one of the most influential and enterprising of
</p>
<p>our citizens. He organized and commanded a regiment in
</p>
<p>the Mexican War, known as the "St. Louis Legion."

</p>
<p>At one time Judge Easton was engaged in business with
</p>
<p>Mr. Russell, father-in-law of Thomas Allen, Esq. They en-
</p>
<p>tered largely in real estate speculations, which, by reason of
</p>
<p>a financial crisis, proved disastrous, and caused Judge Easton
</p>
<p>to become straitened in circumstances  a condition which
</p>
<p>90 BENCH AXD BAR OF M/S.SOrKI.
</p>
<p>greati}' pre}-ed upon his mind, and no doubt shortened his
</p>
<p>life. They owned the ground upon which the present city
</p>
<p>of Alton is located  in fiict, they laid out the town, which
</p>
<p>was named after Judge Easton's oldest son, Alton Rufus
</p>
<p>Easton. Abbey Street in Alton takes its name from his
</p>
<p>daughter Abbey, and the present Compton Avenue of St.
</p>
<p>Louis was also called Abbey, and changed to its present
</p>
<p>name ; and Easton Avenue, one of the most noted thorough-
</p>
<p>fares of St. Louis, takes its name after him.
</p>
<p>Judge Easton was a man of very kind heart, and contrib-
</p>
<p>uted to the full extent of his means to all meritorious
</p>
<p>objects of charit}'. He was very fond of company, and he
</p>
<p>and his accomplished lady dispensed a most generous hos-
</p>
<p>pitality. Few strangers of note visited St. Louis without
</p>
<p>being invited to his house.
</p>
<p>This recalls to mind what we have heard in regard to his
</p>
<p>absent-mindedness, which was occasionally a source of much
</p>
<p>embarrassment to his family.
</p>
<p>We give one instance as an illustration : He invited a
</p>
<p>distinguished officer of the army, who was on a visit to St.
</p>
<p>Louis, to dine with him on a particular day at three o'clock.
</p>
<p>The officer came promptly to the hour, but the family had
</p>
<p>already dined, and the judge was engaged writing in his
</p>
<p>office, having entirely forgotten the invitation, and having
</p>
<p>omitted to inform his wife of it. It proved, also, a source of
</p>
<p>much annoyance to him in his business, for, knowing this
</p>
<p>feature in his character, his clients, by way of refreshing his
</p>
<p>memory, were constantly repeating to him the story of their
</p>
<p>wrongs.
</p>
<p>In running our e}x over the Missouri Gazette of August
</p>
<p>2, 1808, we stumbled upon the following letter, which speaks
</p>
<p>for itself. The judge had no doubt dropped it on the street,
</p>
<p>and some one had found it and sent it to the paper:

<p>William M. Campbell.
</p>
<p>The people of Missouri will better recognize l\Ir. Camp-
</p>
<p>bell by the name of " Billy Campbell," for by that name he
</p>
<p>was universally called. He was a native of Virginia, and
</p>
<p>born in Lexington, Rockbridge County, June 19, 1805.
</p>
<p>He was a graduate of Washington College, now known as
</p>
<p>Washington and Lee University. He finished his legal
</p>
<p>studies in his native place, and in the fall of 1829 came to
</p>
<p>Missouri, and in the spring following opened a law-office in
</p>
<p>the town of St. Charles. He made no effort to obtain busi-
</p>
<p>ness, but his ability soon became known, and from that time
</p>
<p>he was able to command any practice he wished. The next
</p>
<p>year he was sent to the General Assembly, and finally chosen
</p>
<p>to represent his district in the State Senate, where he was
</p>
<p>retained until he removed to St. Louis, about 1844. The
</p>
<p>change of residence was occasioned by his being invited to
</p>
<p>take charge of the editorial department of TJie Neiv Era,
</p>
<p>a Whig daily evening paper published in St. Louis by Charles
</p>
<p>Ramsey, Esq.
</p>
<p>He was shortly afterwards again sent to the State Senate
</p>
<p>from St. Louis, and remained in that body until his death,
</p>
<p>which occurred December 30, 1849. He was also a member
</p>
<p>of the State Constitutional Convention held at Jefferson
</p>
<p>City in 1845. We are not aware of his holding any other
</p>
<p>office, except the presidency of the State Historical Society.
</p>
<p>During his editorial career he practiced but little at his
</p>
<p>profession, though he continued to attend the courts of St.
</p>
<p>Charles and Warren. Mr. Campbell was recognized as one
</p>
<p>of the ablest lawyers in the West, having, indeed, ver\^ few
</p>
<p>superiors at any bar ; and as a political writer was unsur-
</p>
<p>passed. He was a fine classical scholar, and spoke both
</p>
<p>French and Spanish. His retentive memory and fondness

</p>
<p>for reading enabled him to gather a store-house of informa-
</p>
<p>WILLIAM M. CAMPBELL. 93
</p>
<p>tion, which he called into requisition whenever he had a
</p>
<p>demand for it. His style of speaking was bold, logical, and
</p>
<p>fluent, and before a jury he was almost invincible. His per-
</p>
<p>sonal popularity was so great that no party discipline could
</p>
<p>defeat him before the people. Though a very decided
</p>
<p>Whie. the Democrats of St. Charles would vote for him as
</p>
<p>cordially as his own party. It was a popularity acquired
</p>
<p>without any effort on his part, for he was as indifferent to his
</p>
<p>own personal advancement as it was possible for any man to
</p>
<p>be. He would not turn on his heel to be president of the
</p>
<p>United States. Everybody liked him, and he loved every-
</p>
<p>body. No one ever saw his temper ruffled in the slightest
</p>
<p>degree. Nothing could disturb his equanimity ; nor any
</p>
<p>misfortune, his happiness. He never borrowed or antici-
</p>
<p>pated trouble, but accepted everything as though it was
</p>
<p>intended for his good. Upon one occasion, while attending
</p>
<p>the Legislature, the sheriff of St. Charles County went up
</p>
<p>to Jefferson City to pay into the state treasury some reve-
</p>
<p>nue. He called to see Mr. Campbell, who asked about the
</p>
<p>news from St. Charles. The sheriff replied, " Nothing new,
</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell ; but I am sorry to say that I had to sell out,
</p>
<p>last week, your house and lot for the debt you owed as
</p>
<p>security for Hill." " Oh, that is nothing," said Campbell,
</p>
<p>"the property is not lost  it has only changed hands."
</p>
<p>Mentally he was one of the most industrious men in the
</p>
<p>state ; physically, the most indolent. Put him in an arm-
</p>
<p>chair, with a table near him upon which he could hoist his
</p>
<p>feet, and he could write more in one hour than most men
</p>
<p>can in three. His mind moved as if driven by steam-power,
</p>
<p>while the least physical exertion was painful to him. More
</p>
<p>than half of the members of the Legislature got him to
</p>
<p>WTite their bills, reports, resolutions, etc. ; and we have heard
</p>
<p>the enrolling clerk say that half of the bills that came into

</p>
<p>his hand for enrollment were in the handwriting of Mr.
</p>
<p>Campbell. When the House adjourned at noon-time for
</p>
<p>dinner, he would frequently remain in his seat writing, rather
</p>
<p>than undergo the labor of walking two squares. While writ-
</p>
<p>ing he had the appearance of being half asleep, but he
</p>
<p>94 BENCH AND BAR OF .IZ/SSOrA'/.
</p>
<p>would throw off editorial after editorial for his paper, T/ie
</p>
<p>Nc'ii' Era, a statement of the proceedings of both Houses
</p>
<p>for that day, ready for the night's mail, and probably a dozen
</p>
<p>bills, and as many reports, for members who were sitting
</p>
<p>around him. He wrote with great rapidity and ease, and
</p>
<p>scarcely ever had occasion to make a correction. But his
</p>
<p>most extraordinary faculty was his wonderful memory. The
</p>
<p>following incident was related to us by Mr. Ramsey, proprie-
</p>
<p>tor of 77/r ycti.' Era :
</p>
<p>Bishop Soule, an eminent Methodist divine, visited St.
</p>
<p>Louis, and delivered a sermon on a subject of great interest,
</p>
<p>and it was the desire of some of the friends of the bishop
</p>
<p>that it should be reported, and one of them called upon Mr.
</p>
<p>Ramsey for that purpose. Mr. Ramsey said he had no short-
</p>
<p>hand reporter, but he thought Mr. Campbell might be induced
</p>
<p>to report it ; and Campbell, upon being requested, consented
</p>
<p>to do so. He took a seat in front of the pulpit, and to all
</p>
<p>appearances slept during the whole sermon. The next day,
</p>
<p>to the astonishment of the bishop and his friends, The New
</p>
<p>Era came out with a full report of the discussion, embracing
</p>
<p>three long columns. The bishop said it was a verbatim copy
</p>
<p>of his sermon, the only mistake being the substitution of the
</p>
<p>figure "8" for "3," which probably was a typographical
</p>
<p>error. Mr. Campbell, on returning to his office, had written
</p>
<p>it out from memory.
</p>
<p>Upon another occasion Mr. Campbell was l}'ing on a bench
</p>
<p>one night in the Senate chamber when the Democratic mem-
</p>
<p>bers came in to hold a caucus, with closed doors. They con-
</p>
<p>cluded not to disturb Campbell, who appeared to be asleep.
</p>
<p>In a few days a complete report of the proceedings, with a
</p>
<p>copy of the resolutions adopted, appeared in the St. Louis
</p>
<p>Republican. How their proceedings were divulged was a
</p>
<p>mystery to all, and the secretary of the meeting was charged

</p>
<p>with being bribed, etc. But when the excitement of the
</p>
<p>exposure blew over, Mr. Campbell admitted that he had
</p>
<p>reported them.
</p>
<p>He was a bachelor, had but few wants, and they were
</p>
<p>readily supplied. He placed no estimate upon the value of
</p>
<p>WILLIAM M. CAMPBELL. 95
</p>
<p>money, never asked a client for his fee, kept no account of his
</p>
<p>services, and if a chent called to pay him, was most likely to
</p>
<p>tell him that he had no charge against him. Upon one occa-
</p>
<p>sion he was appointed by the court in St. Charles to defend
</p>
<p>a man indicted for horse-stealing. His client had no money,
</p>
<p>but Campbell gave more than usual attention to his case, and
</p>
<p>produced his acquittal. The fellow seemed to be grateful,
</p>
<p>and said, "Mr. Campbell, I will pay you one of these days."
</p>
<p>About a year afterwards, while Campbell was writing an
</p>
<p>editorial at The Neiv Era office, the man came in and
</p>
<p>approached him, \\ith the remark, " Don't you recollect me?
</p>
<p>I am the man you defended in St. Charles for horse-stealing.
</p>
<p>You got me off, Mr. Campbell, but I stole the horse, never-
</p>
<p>theless ; and now I want to pay you for your services." " I
</p>
<p>have no charge against you," said Campbell. "Well, I
</p>
<p>intend to pay you anyhow," said his client, and laid a bank-
</p>
<p>bill on the table and walked out. Campbell did not appear
</p>
<p>to notice it, when Mr. Ramsey called his attention to it. It
</p>
<p>was a $ioo bill on the State Bank of Missouri.
</p>
<p>At another time a client called in and handed him a $50
</p>
<p>bill, which he laid on the table ; and when he went out,
</p>
<p>Ramsey found it among some loose, scattering papers.
</p>
<p>Campbell would never have missed it had not Mr. Ramsey
</p>
<p>reminded him of it.
</p>
<p>At one time he had a handsome property in St. Charles,
</p>
<p>but it was soon frittered away, for he indorsed for every-
</p>
<p>body. He would give something to every beggar he met;
</p>
<p>and if he went out in the street with a pocketful of change,
</p>
<p>he was certain to come back without a cent. He was noted
</p>
<p>all over the state for being slovenly and dirty in his apparel,
</p>
<p>and the anecdotes related of him in that respect are innu-
</p>
<p>merable. During one of the terms of the St. Charles court,
</p>
<p>Henry S. Geyer, who was attending the court, and whose

</p>
<p>love for fun was proverbial, saw Campbell come in with a
</p>
<p>clean shirt on and his beard newly shaved  an event that
</p>
<p>only occurred once in a month  and immediately rose and
</p>
<p>introduced him to the court, with the request that the name
</p>
<p>of the stranger might be entered upon the roll of attorneys.
</p>
<p>96 BENCH AX J) JLIR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>With a grave and solemn look, Mr. Campbell, with pen in
</p>
<p>hand, approached the clerk and signed the roll, amid the
</p>
<p>tumultuous laughter of the bar and audience.
</p>
<p>Upon another occasion, Hamilton R. Gamble and John F.
</p>
<p>Darby were attending court in St. Charles, and went together
</p>
<p>to Mr. Campbell's office to consult some law-books. An old
</p>
<p>sow was standing at the door of the office, eating water-
</p>
<p>melon rinds which Campbell had thrown out. Campbell had
</p>
<p>gone to the court-house. When the old sow had finished
</p>
<p>her repast, she poked her nose into the office and gave a loud
</p>
<p>grunt. Gamble gave her a kick, and told her to clear out 
</p>
<p>" for " said he, " Campbell is not here."
</p>
<p>Upon still another occasion, as he was about leaving for
</p>
<p>Jefferson City to attend a session of the Legislature, his good
</p>
<p>sister, who was devotedly attached to him, bought him a
</p>
<p>dozer) new shirts and packed them carefully in his trunk.
</p>
<p>" Now," said she, " brother, do be more particular about }'our
</p>
<p>dress, and don't forget to put on a clean shirt at least twice
</p>
<p>a week; for you don't know how mortifying it is to me to
</p>
<p>have you go about looking so dirty." When he returned
</p>
<p>home at the close of the session, she congratulated him
</p>
<p>upon looking so hearty. " Why," said she, " you have
</p>
<p>grown as fat as a pig; they must have fed you well at the
</p>
<p>capital!" "Yes," said he, "they take good care of us, for
</p>
<p>they are always in want of some appropriations." She then
</p>
<p>took a look at his trunk, and found but two shirts in it.
</p>
<p>" Where under heavens, brother," said she, "are all those new
</p>
<p>shirts I gave you?" "Don't you find them in the trunk?"
</p>
<p>said he. " No, brother, I see but two here." " Well," said
</p>
<p>he, "possibly I have some on me." Whereupon she com-
</p>
<p>menced examining his breast, and found six shirts on him.
</p>
<p>The cause of his great improvement in flesh became at once
</p>
<p>apparent.

<p>The late Henry S. Geyer was retained in a case pending
</p>
<p>in the St. Charles Circuit Court, involving a considerable
</p>
<p>amount of propert}% and Mr. Campbell was engaged on the
</p>
<p>opposite side, and knowing Mr. Campbell's great popularity
</p>
<p>with a St. Charles jury, he resorted to a little stratagem to
</p>
<p>WILLIAM M. CAMPBELL. gl
</p>
<p>gain the favor and good-will of the jury. Knowing that Mtr;.
</p>
<p>Campbell's slovenliness in dress was well understood, he:
</p>
<p>remarked in his opening speech to the jury that he came:
</p>
<p>into the case with the purest motives, and expected to be-
</p>
<p>met by the opposing counsel with a like fairness and candor,
</p>
<p>but was greatly surprised to find that Mr. Campbell had
</p>
<p>been guilty of offering a bribe to the jury. In an instant
</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell sprang to his feet, seemingly much astonished,',
</p>
<p>and demanded to know in what manner and by what means .
</p>
<p>he had attempted to bribe a jury composed of the most
</p>
<p>respectable citizens of St. Charles County. Mr. Geyer stated
</p>
<p>that he made the charge with a full knowledge of what he was
</p>
<p>saying, and was responsible for what he said. In a loud and
</p>
<p>threatening voice Mr. Campbell demanded an explanation
</p>
<p>of the charge, and said, " How, sir, did I attempt to bribe
</p>
<p>them?" When Mr. Geyer, during the most intense excite-
</p>
<p>ment in the court-room, replied, " By coming into court this,
</p>
<p>morning with a clean shirt ivi." In an instant the whole
</p>
<p>audience was convulsed with laughter, and with a significant
</p>
<p>smile Mr. Campbell thanked him for the compliment.
</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell remained a bachelor through hfe..

</p>
<p>RUFUS PETTTBONE.
</p>
<p>Rufus Pettibone, the son of Giles and Margaret Holcomb
</p>
<p>Pettibone, was born in the county of Litchfield, in the state
</p>
<p>of Connecticut, on May 26, 1784. In his boyhood Rufus was
</p>
<p>robust and healthy, and was among the foremost in his class
</p>
<p>at school, and a leader in their sports on the play ground.
</p>
<p>He was the youngest of a large family of children, and it
</p>
<p>was generally understood in the family that Rufus was to
</p>
<p>receive a collegiate education. With this understanding the
</p>
<p>course of study at the district school was so shaped that,
</p>
<p>when he applied to enter college, he experienced no difficulty
</p>
<p>whatever in passing the necessary examination. After the
</p>
<p>summer vacation following commencement in the year 1801,
</p>
<p>he applied for and was admitted to Williams College, in north-
</p>
<p>western Massachusetts, and passed four years of his life in
</p>
<p>diligent study at that college ; and at its expiration, in 1805,
</p>
<p>was graduated with high honors. After he graduated he
</p>
<p>returned to his father's house to debate and advise with him
</p>
<p>as to the battle of life, upon the threshold of which he was
</p>
<p>about to enter.
</p>
<p>Following the bent of his own mind, and conforming to
</p>
<p>the wishes and desires of his friends, he adopted law as his
</p>
<p>profession, and in the early part of 1806 began the study of
</p>
<p>law in the office of a lawyer of large practice, in Onondaga
</p>
<p>County, in the state of New York. He remained in this
</p>
<p>office for about two years, and then entered the office of
</p>
<p>Abraham Van Veckten, a leading lawyer of that day in the
</p>
<p>city of Albany, in the same state. After remaining here for
</p>
<p>one year he was, after examination, admitted to the practice
</p>
<p>as an attorney and counselor. This was in the latter part of
</p>
<p>the year 1808, or the early part of 1809.
</p>
<p>After looking around for a suitable location to practice

</p>
<p>his profession, he finally settled in the village of Vernon, in
</p>
<p>HUFUS PETTIBONE. 99
</p>
<p>the western part of the large and wealthy county of Oneida,
</p>
<p>in the year 1810, and was elected in 18 12 to represent the
</p>
<p>county in the lower branch of the State Legislature. While
</p>
<p>serving as a member of the Legislature he became ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with Louise Esther De Russey, to whom he was
</p>
<p>married in the same year. She was the daughter of Clau-
</p>
<p>dius Le Droit De Russey, who emigrated from France to
</p>
<p>the Island of San Domingo prior to the year 1791, but who
</p>
<p>during that year was fortunate enough to escape the insur-
</p>
<p>rection b}' taking refuge on board a vessel that took him
</p>
<p>and his family to New York, in which state he settled.
</p>
<p>\\\ 1 8 17 Rufus Pettibone concluded to remove to St.
</p>
<p>Louis, in the then territory of Missouri, and cast his lot
</p>
<p>among the pioneers of that section; and accordingly, in
</p>
<p>May, 1 8 18, reached St. Louis with his family, at that time
</p>
<p>consisting of his wife and three children. Upon his arrival
</p>
<p>he was offered a partnership in the practice of law by Col-
</p>
<p>onel Rufus Easton, one of the most experienced lawyers
</p>
<p>then at the St. Louis bar. This he accepted. During the
</p>
<p>agitation of the question of the admission of the then terri-
</p>
<p>tory as a state into the Federal Union, the subject of
</p>
<p>slavery was a most disturbing element in the settlement of
</p>
<p>the question of admission. A large number of the settlers
</p>
<p>in the territory of Missouri were opposed to the further
</p>
<p>spread of slavery, or its recognition in the then proposed
</p>
<p>Constitution. The persons who held to these views were in
</p>
<p>a great minority, but so earnest were they to give expression
</p>
<p>to their sentiments that a ticket with names of representative
</p>
<p>men thereon was presented to the people for their suffrages.
</p>
<p>On that ticket were John B. C. Lucas, Rufus Easton, Rufus
</p>
<p>Pettibone, Robert Simpson, and Caleb Bowles.
</p>
<p>The election of state officers followed close on the adop-

<p>election Alexander McNair was chosen governor, and Will-
</p>
<p>iam H. Ashley lieutenant-governor. The representatives
</p>
<p>chosen from the several counties assembled in St. Louis in
</p>
<p>September, 1820, and organized the first State Legislature.
</p>
<p>The remainder of the year 1820 had nearly passed before
</p>
<p>every department of the state government was organized 
</p>
<p>lOO BENCH AND RAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>especially was this the case in the judicial department. No
</p>
<p>courts were held under the state government until the year
</p>
<p>1 82 1. The senators chosen by the Legislature were David
</p>
<p>Barton and Thomas H. Benton, and were elected in the
</p>
<p>order here given.
</p>
<p>Rufus Pettibone was appointed judge of the Second Judi-
</p>
<p>cial Circuit, which was then composed of the counties of
</p>
<p>Ralls, Pike, Lincoln, St. Charles, Montgomery, and Calla-
</p>
<p>way on the north side of the Missouri River, and Gasconade
</p>
<p>County on the south side. After his appointment, Judge
</p>
<p>Pettibone removed to the town of St. Charles. His first
</p>
<p>court was held in Louisiana, Pike County, in February,
</p>
<p>1 82 1. He served the people of the circuit as judge, with
</p>
<p>credit to himself and acceptability to them, until 1823, when
</p>
<p>a vacancy occurred on the supreme bench of the state, which
</p>
<p>vacancy he was appointed to fill. He held the position of
</p>
<p>supreme judge of the state from the time of his appointment
</p>
<p>until July 31, 1825, when  in the prime of his power and
</p>
<p>usefulness  he died.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1824-5 the Legislature of the state chose

<p>Hon. Henry S. Geyer (afterward a United States senator
</p>
<p>from the state of Missouri) and Judge Rufus Pettibone to
</p>
<p>revise the laws of the state, and to prepare the same for enact-
</p>
<p>ment by the Legislature.
</p>
<p>Judge Pettibone was a ripe scholar and a sound lawyer,
</p>
<p>and in his death the young state of Missouri lost a most
</p>
<p>valuable citizen.
</p>
<p>For an account of the parentage and early life of Judge
</p>
<p>Pettibone we are indebted to a brother of his, Levi Pettibone,
</p>
<p>Esq., of Pike County, Missouri, who is now in his ninety-
</p>
<p>eighth year. At this advanced age he retains w ith wonder-
</p>
<p>ful power all of his faculties, and his letters addressed to Mrs.
</p>

<p>touching the life of his'brother, and the father of Mrs. Hunt,
</p>
<p>are remarkably clear, and most beautifully written.
</p>
<p>A notice of Judge Pettibone would hardly be complete
</p>
<p>without referring as we have to his elder brother, who, fifty-
</p>
<p>three years after the death of the former, is enabled to give
</p>
<p>us the data upon which this notice is predicated.
</p>
<p>John s. Brickey.
</p>
<p>We became acquainted with this venerable lawyer in the
</p>
<p>fall of 1836. He was a native of Richmond County, Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, and was born November 2, 1791. He was of French
</p>
<p>Huguenot descent. His education was obtained in the old-
</p>
<p>field schools. His father being in reduced circumstances,
</p>
<p>and incumbered with a large family, young Brickey deter-
</p>
<p>mined to go West and become the architect of his own
</p>
<p>fortune. When only eighteen years of age he went into the
</p>
<p>western part of the state, and taught school there the first
</p>
<p>winter. In the spring he took up his march for Tennessee,
</p>
<p>and in the summer opened a school there, and taught until
</p>
<p>1 8 10, when he again started for the West, landing at St.
</p>
<p>Genevieve, and after resting there a short time proceeded to
</p>
<p>Potosi, in Washington County, with the intention of opening
</p>
<p>a school there ; but changed his mind and proceeded to St.
</p>
<p>Louis, and entered the office of Edward Hempstead as a
</p>
<p>student at law. After completing his studies he was ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to the bar, and located at old Franklin, in Howard
</p>
<p>County. After practicing there about two years he returned
</p>
<p>to Washington County, and settled at Potosi.
</p>
<p>At the first session of the General Assembly after the or-
</p>
<p>ganization of the state government, in 1821, Mr. Brickey was
</p>
<p>chosen secretary of the Senate. At the election which re-
</p>
<p>sulted in the elevation of Mr. Monroe to the presidency, Mr.
</p>
<p>Brickey was chosen elector, and gave his vote for Monroe
</p>
<p>and Tompkins. He also represented Washington County
</p>
<p>several times in the Legislature, and for about eighteen years
</p>
<p>was prosecuting attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brickey had some experience in military life, having,
</p>
<p>in 1812, joined the Rangers, a body of men sent out by the
</p>
<p>government to protect the settlers from the ravages of the

</p>
<p>Indians, who had been instigated by the British government
</p>
<p>I02 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>to deeds of violence and cruelty. Mr. Brickey received a
</p>
<p>pension from the government, which was paid him regularly
</p>
<p>till his death.
</p>
<p>After becoming too far advanced in years to continue the
</p>
<p>practice of the law, he moved to a small farm in St. Louis
</p>
<p>Count}', and after remaining there a few years went to St.
</p>
<p>Louis, where he died in 1872, in the eighty-first year of his
</p>
<p>age.
</p>
<p>When we saw him last he presented a most patriarchal
</p>
<p>appearance ; his hair falling upon his shoulders, and his beard
</p>
<p>reaching nearly to his waist, and both perfectly white.
</p>
<p>When we made his acquaintance, in 1836, he was then
</p>
<p>prosecuting attorney for his judicial circuit, but we never
</p>
<p>regarded him as a very vigorous prosecutor, by reason of
</p>
<p>his inability to withstand the appeals to his mercy and clem-
</p>
<p>ency. Through his kindness and forbearance many a pris-
</p>
<p>oner escaped who well deserved severe punishment. He was
</p>
<p>a kind-hearted man, and as free from guile as a child. As
</p>
<p>a speaker he was fluent and pleasant, but seldom attempted
</p>
<p>a close, logical argument. He, however, had the faculty of
</p>
<p>impressing a jury with a sense of his great candor and
</p>
<p>earnestness, and, if it became necessary to invoke their
</p>
<p>sympathy, could shed tears and weep without an effort  in
</p>
<p>fact, his tears would flow as naturally as water from a fount-
</p>
<p>ain-head. In this way he once victimized us to our heart's
</p>
<p>content.
</p>
<p>Dr. ]\L, a man t)f wealth and a kind and estimable citizen,
</p>
<p>loaned a horse to one H., out of pure charity, with the under-
</p>
<p>standing that he was to be returned in a i^w weeks; but,
</p>
<p>instead of returning him, he sold him for a mere trifle to a
</p>
<p>German by the name of Coatjohn, who well knew that it
</p>
<p>was the doctor's property. We brought suit to recover him,
</p>
<p>and upon the trial established our title beyond question ; and

</p>
<p>the only proof that Mr. Brickey, who was retained for the
</p>
<p>defense, made was that Coatjohn had a wife and eight chil-
</p>
<p>dren, and not a dollar to support them ; and that his only re-
</p>
<p>liance for bread was upon making a little corn upon a small
</p>
<p>piece of rented land. The instruction of the court left the
</p>
<p>JOHN S. B RICKEY. IO3
</p>
<p>jur}' no alternative but to find for the plaintiff. Mr. Brickey,
</p>
<p>however, made a strong appeal to the jur}% alluding to the
</p>
<p>doctor's wealth and Coatjohn's poverty, and wound up by
</p>
<p>exclaiming: "Gentlemen of the jury ! Will you take from
</p>
<p>poor Coatjohn his only horse, and his only means of making
</p>
<p>bread for his poor starving children, and hand it over to this
</p>
<p>rich Shylock, who has not a child in the world, though able
</p>
<p>to support a hundred? No, gentlemen, you cannot do it.
</p>
<p>God forbid ! God forbid !" and down he sat, sobbing and
</p>
<p>crying as though his heart would break. We glanced at the
</p>
<p>jury, saw them wiping away their tears, and told the doctor
</p>
<p>his horse was gone. In vain did we direct the attention of
</p>
<p>the jury to the facts as developed by the evidence, to the in-
</p>
<p>struction of the court, to the oath they had taken, and their
</p>
<p>duty under the oath. In vain did we insist that the only
</p>
<p>issue they had to try was as to the ownership of the horse;
</p>
<p>that not an iota of proof had been given to sliow any title
</p>
<p>whatever in Coatjohn ; that the whole thing was a put-up
</p>
<p>job to swindle the doctor out of his horse; that it was not
</p>
<p>the mere value of the horse that the doctor was contending
</p>
<p>for, but he did not wish to be swindled out of his property in
</p>
<p>such a manner. We told them that they must not expect us
</p>
<p>to cry, as the value of the property was not sufficient to in-
</p>
<p>duce us to compete with Mr. Brickey in that respect. Our
</p>
<p>speech produced no visible effect, and the jury, after an ab-
</p>
<p>sence of five minutes, returned a verdict for the defendant.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brickey gained his case, and the doctor lost his horse.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brickey raised a large family, and was greatly esteemed
</p>
<p>throughout life. He was a very small man, not exceeding in
</p>
<p>stature five feet three inches, and always rode a very large
</p>
<p>horse, which gave him, in the saddle, rather a ludicrous
</p>
<p>appearance. He gave as a reason, that it enabled him to ford
</p>
<p>streams and rivers with greater facility ; but the real cause

</p>
<p>was, no doubt, his love of contrast, for he displayed the same
</p>
<p>taste in his marriage, as he united himself with a very large
</p>
<p>lady, and physically much his superior.
</p>
<p>JOSIAH SPALDING.
</p>
<p>No institution of learning in this country has been so
</p>
<p>proHfic in furnishing able men to the different professions as
</p>
<p>old Yale; and among those sent to the far West was Josiah
</p>
<p>Spalding, who graduated, about 1817, with the first honors of
</p>
<p>the institution.
</p>
<p>Mr. Spalding was a native of Connecticut, and after leav-
</p>
<p>ing Yale became a tutor in Columbia College, New York,
</p>
<p>and, while teaching, pursued the study of the law.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1819-20 he removed to St. Louis, where
</p>
<p>he entered upon the practice of his profession. For a short
</p>
<p>period he was connected with the editorial department of
</p>
<p>the Missouri Gazette, then published by Edward Charless.
</p>
<p>Though a strong and vigorous writer, he had little relish for
</p>
<p>political strife, and soon relinquished the editorial chair to
</p>
<p>devote himself to the duties of his profession ; and in a short
</p>
<p>time acquired a large and lucrative practice, which enabled
</p>
<p>him to accumulate a fair competency. Mr. Spalding ranked
</p>
<p>among such men asGeyer, Gamble, Bates, and Leonard. It
</p>
<p>has been said that his chief excellence was as a case lawyer,
</p>
<p>but this is a wide mistake ; for he had a logical, mathematical,
</p>
<p>and discriminating mind  qualities that are always wanting
</p>
<p>in a mere case lawyer. The error doubtless arose from the
</p>
<p>fact that he was prolific in authorities  always ready to sus-
</p>
<p>tain any position he advanced by reference to well-adjudged
</p>
<p>cases; but he used them as a means of success, and his
</p>
<p>love of 'research and investigation placed them at his com-
</p>
<p>mand. His briefs in the Supreme Court were not surpassed
</p>
<p>by those of any other lawyer, and always commanded the
</p>
<p>closest attention ; for lie never cited a case in which there
</p>
<p>was a mere apparent analogy, but selected such as squarely
</p>
<p>met the question involved, and which were founded upon

</p>
<p>reason and principle.
</p>
<p>J OS I AH SPALDING. IO5
</p>
<p>Like Judge Ezra Hunt, Mr. Spalding had no taste for
</p>
<p>public life, and avoided, rather than sought, popular applause.
</p>
<p>Though a very decided man in his political tenets, he seldom
</p>
<p>mixed with the people, and was but little known by them.
</p>
<p>Domestic and retiring, he lived in the midst of his immediate
</p>
<p>family, to whom he was devotedly attached, and who in
</p>
<p>return almost idolized him. He married an accomplished
</p>
<p>lady, who still survives him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Spalding was a true and consistent Christian, prac-
</p>
<p>ticing what he preached, and making his life comport with
</p>
<p>his profession. He was a good man without being a great
</p>
<p>man, and his heart never failed to respond to the calls of
</p>
<p>charity and benevolence. At this day his name is never
</p>
<p>mentioned among those who knew him without eliciting
</p>
<p>words of praise and commendation.
</p>
<p>In alluding to his Christian life, we are reminded of a pop-
</p>
<p>ular delusion which has been attached to the public mind
</p>
<p>from time immemorial, and that is that a successful lawyer
</p>
<p>cannot be a consistent Christian. It is one of those popular
</p>
<p>errors that are most difficult to disprove, because unsustained
</p>
<p>by reason or experience, and presenting no ground for dis-
</p>
<p>cussion. Not the shadow of a reason can be given why a
</p>
<p>lawyer should ever be required to resort to any act not con-
</p>
<p>sistent with truth and propriety. The law itself is based
</p>
<p>upon reason and good morals, and exacts from every citizen
</p>
<p>a strict compliance with every duty necessary to the welfare
</p>
<p>and happiness of mankind. And history teaches us that
</p>
<p>some of the greatest promoters of the Christian religion were
</p>
<p>to be found among the brightest ornaments of the legal pro-
</p>
<p>fession. The greatest of American lav/yers, Daniel Webster,
</p>
<p>though not given to any outward exhibition of religious
</p>
<p>feeling, has left upon record his high appreciation of the
</p>
<p>Christian religion, and the necessity of a proper observance

<p>of the Sabbath and the ordinances of the Church. Peter
</p>
<p>Harvey, in his reminiscences of Mr. Webster, publishes an
</p>
<p>extract from one of his letters to Charles W. Ridgely, Esq.,
</p>
<p>secretary of a society organized to promote the better
</p>
<p>observance of the Sabbath, in which Mr. Webster said :
</p>
<p>I06 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>"The longer I live the more highly do I estimate the importance of a
</p>
<p>proper oliservance of the Christian Sabbath, and the more grateful do I feel
</p>
<p>toward those who take pains to impress a sense of this importance on the
</p>
<p>community. The Lord's Day is the day on which the gospel is preached. It
</p>
<p>is the day of ]iul)lic worship throughout the Christian world ; and althcjugh we
</p>
<p>live in a reading age, and in a reading community, yet the preaching of the
</p>
<p>gospel is the human agency which has Ijeen, and still is, the most efficaciously
</p>
<p>employed for the good of men. That the poor had the gospel preached to
</p>
<p>them was an evidence of His mission which the Author of Christianity him-
</p>
<p>self proclaimed; and to the public worship of the Deity, and to the preach-
</p>
<p>ing of the gospel, the observance of the Sabbath is obviously essential."
</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey also says that at a private dinner-part}' in New
</p>
<p>York Mr. Webster was asked what was the most important
</p>
<p>thought that ever occupied his mind ; and his reply was :
</p>
<p>" The most important thought that ever occupied my mind
</p>
<p>was that of my individual responsibility to God." He be-
</p>
<p>longed from his boyhood to the orthodox Congregational
</p>
<p>church.
</p>
<p>The same reverence for the religion of our fathers has
</p>
<p>been entertained by the legal profession throughout the
</p>
<p>Christian world. We cannot deny the almost universal prev-
</p>
<p>alence of the opinion among mankind that a lawyer may
</p>
<p>utter a falsehood without incurring the opprobrium that
</p>
<p>would attach to a person of a different vocation. This is
</p>
<p>well exemplified in a good story we clipped out of a paper.
</p>
<p>It appears that there had been rumors afloat of a scan-
</p>
<p>dalous nature concerning the relations existing between
</p>
<p>a well-known Cincinnati woman of great beauty, but of
</p>
<p>doubtful virtue, and the two gentlemen in question. One
</p>
<p>day the lawyer, upon hearing those rumors for the first time,
</p>
<p>became very much agitated, and forthwith rushed into the
</p>
<p>private office of the banker, and in a state of great excite-
</p>
<p>ment told the banker what he had heard.

</p>
<p>"Well, Judge," said the banker, "what do you propose to
</p>
<p>do about it ? "
</p>
<p>"Do about it?" retorted the lawyer, " Why, sir, deny it.
</p>
<p>B}' G  d, sir, deny it."
</p>
<p>" Let us see about that," said the banker. " Now, you
</p>
<p>are a lawyer, and I am a banker. It may do very well for
</p>
<p>J OS I AH SPALDING. XOJ
</p>
<p>you as a lawyer to deny it, but as a banker I consider my
</p>
<p>reputation for truth and integrity of more consequence to
</p>
<p>me than my character for chastity."
</p>
<p>As a commercial lawyer Mr. Spalding had no superior, if
</p>
<p>any equal, at the St. Louis bar; for though he did not make
</p>
<p>that branch of the law a specialty, still most of his business
</p>
<p>grew out of commercial transactions. The early Reports
</p>
<p>of our Supreme Court are replete with his briefs, and to
</p>
<p>show his great power of research, reference is made to one
</p>
<p>of them filed by him in cause of Hamilton and Treat,
</p>
<p>Judges, vs. Saint Louis County Court, reported in the 15th
</p>
<p>Missouri Reports, page 3. By act of the General Assembly
</p>
<p>of March 3, 185 i, it was provided :
</p>
<p>" Sec. I. That the County Court of St. Louis County is hereby authorized
</p>
<p>and required to pay out of the county treasury of St. Louis County to the
</p>
<p>judge of the St. Louis Circuit Court, the judge of the St. Louis Court of Com-
</p>
<p>mon Pleas, and the judge of the St. Louis Criminal Court, each, such sum, in
</p>
<p>addition to the amount now allowed to such judge by law, as will make the total
</p>
<p>amount of compensation received by said judge not to exceed the sum of three
</p>
<p>thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>" Sec. 2. The additional compensation herein provided for shall be paid at
</p>
<p>the same stated periods as the salary of said judges respectively are now paid
</p>
<p>by law."
</p>
<p>The County Court, regarding the act as unconstitutional,
</p>
<p>refused to comply with it; whereupon the judges applied to
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court for a niandavnts to compel the County
</p>
<p>Court to audit and allow the claim, and a conditional nia/i-
</p>
<p>daiinis was awarded. The County Court made return to the
</p>
<p>writ  among other grounds  that the act of the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture was unjust, oppressive, void, repugnant to our system of
</p>
<p>government, and unconstitutional ; and that the payment of
</p>
<p>money to the judges out of the County treasury would be a
</p>
<p>misapplication of the county treasure, intrusted by law to

</p>
<p>the administration of the court." A peremptory nnn/uiaunis
</p>
<p>was asked for, and the constitutional question raised by the
</p>
<p>return of the County Court was thus brought directly before
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court. The most eminent counsel at the bar
</p>
<p>were retained in the case, and the constitutional question
</p>
<p>discussed at great length by Mr. Spalding and R. M. Field
</p>
<p>I08 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>for the relators, and Edward Bates and Thomas T. Gantt for
</p>
<p>the County Court.
</p>
<p>It is not our purpose to enter into a discussion of the
</p>
<p>merits of the case, but simply to direct the attention of the
</p>
<p>reader to the voluminous and exhaustive brief of Mr. Spald-
</p>
<p>ing, which exhibits in a marked degree his great powers of
</p>
<p>research and investigation, and his capacity to deal with an
</p>
<p>important constitutional question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Spalding made no pretensions to oratory, and his style
</p>
<p>of speaking was purely conversational. He was a very
</p>
<p>laborious man, prepared his cases thoroughly, and rarely had
</p>
<p>occasion to crave the indulgence of the court. He ^\rote
</p>
<p>with great facility, was a fine special pleader, and it was not
</p>
<p>often that a declaration or plea filed by him required an
</p>
<p>amendment.
</p>
<p>Our acquaintance with Mr. Spalding was very limited;
</p>
<p>indeed, we never saw him \\hile engaged in an\- important
</p>
<p>case, and hence have to rely upon the judgment of others for
</p>
<p>a proper elucidation of his professional characteristics.
</p>
<p>Mr. Spalding was one of those men that the public always
</p>
<p>look to for advnce in times oi peril and commotion, for he
</p>
<p>was a safe counselor  never led astray by excitement or.
</p>
<p>sudden impulse, nor would he ev^er permit party spirit to
</p>
<p>interfere with his sense of duty. He was, in fact, one oi
</p>
<p>those men whose great usefulness is never appreciated until
</p>
<p>death takes them from our midst.
</p>
<p>Mr. Spalding was a very hopeful man, and never indulged
</p>
<p>in those gloomy forebodings that are common after any
</p>
<p>great public disaster. He believed that Providence regulated
</p>
<p>everything for our good, and that in times of adversit}' we
</p>
<p>should be consoled with the hope of a better day. This
</p>
<p>hope has been beautifully described by Goldsmith:
</p>
<p>" Hope, like the gleaming taper's light,

</p>
<p>And still, as darker grows the light,

<p>Emits a brighter ray."
</p>
<p>He died leaving a large family to mourn his loss.
</p>
<p>Philip Cole.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1837 we made the acquaintance of Phihp
</p>
<p>Cole, John S. Krickey, and Mason Frizell, of the Washington
</p>
<p>County bar, all of whom enjoyed a^ fair practice and pos-
</p>
<p>sessed a large influence in that part of the state.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole was born in Belmont County, Virginia, February
</p>
<p>22, 1789, and studied law under Allen Taylor, of that state,
</p>
<p>and came to Potosi, Missouri, in 1820, where he resided dur-
</p>
<p>ing the remainder of his life. Potosi was then the largest
</p>
<p>town in south-east Missouri, and older than St. Louis. St.
</p>
<p>Genevieve, St. Charles, Potosi, and St. Louis are the oldest
</p>
<p>settlements in the state ; St. Genevieve and Potosi being
</p>
<p>noted for their wealth, and refined society. In the former
</p>
<p>lived the Vallcs, Rosiers, Seargants, Scotts, Menards, Bogy,
</p>
<p>Dodge, Jones, St. Gem, and, at a later period, Missouri's popu-
</p>
<p>lar senator, Dr. Louis F. Linn ; while in the latter, then called
</p>
<p>Mine la Burton, resided the Austins, Rectors, Whites, Caseys,
</p>
<p>Dunklins, McElvains, Bryants, and others. Both towns were
</p>
<p>in the center of a rich mining country, and exported large
</p>
<p>amounts of lead ; and as mining is always a fruitful source
</p>
<p>of litigation, it is not strange that many lawyers settled there
</p>
<p>in preference to St. Louis, which in that day was scarcely
</p>
<p>more than a mere French village.
</p>
<p>Philip Cole was one of the most profound lawyers in the
</p>
<p>state, and as a special pleader had no superior  indeed, it
</p>
<p>was claimed by his co-laborers in the law that upon all
</p>
<p>questions of pleading he was as good authority as old Chitty
</p>
<p>himself. He was a laborious student, and owned the best
</p>
<p>law library south of St. Louis, consisting of about 400 vol-
</p>
<p>umes of well-selected books of the then latest editions,
</p>
<p>embracing not only most of the text-books, but the leading
</p>
<p>American and English chancery and common-law reports,

</p>
<p>permit one to go out of liis office unless under the most
</p>
<p>imperious necessity.
</p>
<p>In declamation lie was very deficient, and rarely attempted
</p>
<p>a speech, even to a jury  his main reliance being his skill
</p>
<p>in pleading, and his ingenuity in drawing instructions. His
</p>
<p>want of adroitness in addressing a jury gave rise to an amus-
</p>
<p>ing incident which we witnessed. A boy by the name of P.,
</p>
<p>about seventeen years of age, and belonging to a noted fam-
</p>
<p>ily of horse-thieves, tvvo of whom were then in the peniten-
</p>
<p>tiar}', was indicted for grand larceny, an offense which then,
</p>
<p>as now, consisted under the statute of feloniously stealing
</p>
<p>and carr}'ing awa}^ property of the value of $10 or more.
</p>
<p>The boy was smart, shrewd, and, for his age, well educated in
</p>
<p>crime. His father emplo}'ed Mr. Cole to defend him. The
</p>
<p>state made out a strong case, leaving his counsel no possible
</p>
<p>ground upon which to predicate a defense. But it occurred
</p>
<p>to Mr. Cole that if he could impress the jury with the belief
</p>
<p>that his client was iion compos mentis, or at least so deficient
</p>
<p>in intellect as to be incapable of distinguishing between
</p>
<p>right and wrong, he might possibly produce an acquittal or
</p>
<p>a hung jury; and, acting upon this idea, he addressed the
</p>
<p>jury, first having obtained from the court an ingenious
</p>
<p>instruction applicable to such a defense. He stated that
</p>
<p>several of the boy's ancestors had died from insanity, and
</p>
<p>that the boy himself, on divers occasions, had given his
</p>
<p>parents serious apprehensions that he would probably take
</p>
<p>the same direction ; that witnesses had been summoned to
</p>
<p>prove acts and conduct that, even for his age, exhibited
</p>
<p>almost an entire want of mental capacity, but his client was
</p>
<p>without means, and unable to compel their attendance.
</p>
<p>"Why," said he, "gentlemen of the jury, you can see from
</p>
<p>his very appearance that he has no sense." Scarcely had the
</p>
<p>word "sense" left his lips, when the boy rose and told the

<p>jury that he had just as much sense as Mr. Cole, and, rather
</p>
<p>than be acquitted on the ground of being a fool, he preferred
</p>
<p>spending the balance of his days in h  1 or the penitentiary.
</p>
<p>In an instant the court, jury, and spectators burst out in
</p>
<p>tumultuous laughter, in the midst of which Mr. Cole picked
</p>
<p>PHILIP COLE. I I I
</p>
<p>up his hat and left the court-room, a thoroughly disgusted
</p>
<p>man. But the event saved the boy; for the jury were so
</p>
<p>pleased that they found him guilty simply of petit larceny,
</p>
<p>though the proof made a clear case of grand larceny. There
</p>
<p>being no sufficient jail in the county, the judge directed the
</p>
<p>sheriff to take him to his farm, work him a month, and then
</p>
<p>turn him loose.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole, though undoubtedly a man of integrity, would
</p>
<p>sometimes resort to a" mode of practice very reprehensible.
</p>
<p>He would quote decisions which had never been made, and
</p>
<p>cite authorities that existed only in his imagination  not
</p>
<p>unfrequently quoting book and page ; but the book was one
</p>
<p>which he supposed could not be produced, and in this way
</p>
<p>he would sometimes succeed in imposing on a stupid court.
</p>
<p>He was certainly an admirable case lawyer, and his briefs
</p>
<p>in the Supreme Court indicated much research and legal
</p>
<p>acumen, and no little familiarity with the rulings of the
</p>
<p>Federal and state courts. Like Rufus Choate, of Boston,
</p>
<p>he could scarcely ever read his own handwriting, and the
</p>
<p>lawyers gave him no little annoyance by calling upon him,
</p>
<p>in open court, to do so. He sometimes said, by way of
</p>
<p>apology, that any lawyer who could, was deficient in learn-
</p>
<p>ing. It bore some resemblance to a Chinese inscription
</p>
<p>upon an ancient tablet ; but it gave him one advantage, for,
</p>
<p>when assailed by criticism, he could give it any interpreta-
</p>
<p>tion that suited him.
</p>
<p>He died in Potosi, August i, 1862, in his seventy-first year.
</p>
<p>For some time immediately preceding his death he was
</p>
<p>afflicted with softening of the brain, involving a total loss of
</p>
<p>memory, particularly with reference to names. He was un-
</p>
<p>able to call by name some of the members of his own family.
</p>
<p>This strange mental disorder did not seem at first to have
</p>
<p>any visible effect upon his physical organization, for he con-

<p>tinued strong and robust till within a few weeks of his death.
</p>
<p>It was often said that Mr. Cole was wanting in candor and
</p>
<p>sincerity, but, though practicing in the same courts with him
</p>
<p>many years, we failed to observe it. We recall, however, one

<p>amusing incident that might be taken, unexplained, as evi-

</p>
<p>dence of it. A lawyer  whom we will designate as Mr. J. 
</p>
<p>re.siding in the same circuit, and on friendly terms with Mr,
</p>
<p>Cole, was once on his way to Potosi to attend court, and was.
</p>
<p>riding in company with a gentleman by the name of T., who
</p>
<p>was also an old acquaintance and client of Mr. Cole. When
</p>
<p>within a few miles of Potosi, Mr. J. suggested that as Mr.
</p>
<p>Cole had often invited him to call and spend a night with
</p>
<p>him, and as it was getting late, they would give him a call;,
</p>
<p>the propriety of which Mr. T. acquiesced in, saying he also
</p>
<p>had often received a similar invitation. When they reached
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole's residence, which was on the main road, and within
</p>
<p>two miles of Potosi, they dismounted at the gate, and,
</p>
<p>throwing their saddle-bags over their shoulders, started for
</p>
<p>the house, which was about seventy yards distant. Mr. Cole
</p>
<p>saw them from his porch and met them half way, and the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing took place : "Very glad to see you, gentlemen. On
</p>
<p>your way to Potosi, I presume ; but little over a mile ; will
</p>
<p>get there before dark. But you must be careful not to miss,
</p>
<p>the road ; it forks near the corner of my field. But to avoid,
</p>
<p>any mistake I will walk that distance with you, and put you
</p>
<p>on the right track." And suiting the action to the word,,
</p>
<p>he led them to the appointed place, and, bidding them good-
</p>
<p>night, returned to his house. The truth no doubt was that
</p>
<p>he had a dislike for T.
</p>
<p>He was a large, athletic man, and seldom failed to attend
</p>
<p>all the courts of his circuit. Mr. Cole displayed much inge-.
</p>
<p>nuity in collecting his fees, though his charges were usually
</p>
<p>very moderate. A man once called upon him to get a con-
</p>
<p>tinuance in a suit upon a promissory note. Under the law
</p>
<p>then in force, if a plea was filed, and verified by affidavit, the
</p>
<p>defendant was entitled to one continuance. Mr. Cole asked
</p>
<p>him if he had any defense to the action, and received for a.
</p>
<p>reply " that he had not," but that it w as very iiicoiivcnieiit for

</p>
<p>him to pay the debt at that time. " All right," said Mr..
</p>
<p>Cole, "hand me $\0, and I will file a plea." He received,
</p>
<p>the $io, and drew up the following plea : " Now at this day
</p>
<p>comes said defendant and says upon his solemn oath that it
</p>
<p>is not co7ivetiient for him to pay said debt at this time." The-
</p>
<p>rniLjr cole. 113
</p>
<p>plea was sworn to and filed, and the lawyer who brought
</p>
<p>the suit, neglecting to examine the plea, paid no further
</p>
<p>attention to the case, and it was continued.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole and Mr. B. were employed to bring a suit for
</p>
<p>trespass to land, and after a tedious trial obtained a judgment
</p>
<p>for ^45, which amount was paid to them, each taking $20,
</p>
<p>and leaving ^5 for their client. The fact was, their services
</p>
<p>were of much greater value, but the client complained bitterly
</p>
<p>that his lawyers had eaten the turkey and left him the bones
</p>
<p>to pick.
</p>
<p>This, however, is not half as bad as the case mentioned
</p>
<p>by Edwards, in his " Pleasantries," where a witty lawyer
</p>
<p>was stopped by a man holding a bank-note for $5 in his
</p>
<p>hand, with, "Mr. G., pray give me your opinion on this bill;
</p>
<p>is it a good one?" Mr. G. carefully examined it, and then
</p>
<p>said : " Yes, it is a good bill," at the same time deliberately
</p>
<p>putting it in his pocket. The interrogator expressed his
</p>
<p>thanks, and asked him to return the note ; but all he got
</p>
<p>was : " I never give an opinion under $5."
</p>
<p>Mr. Cole raised a large family, several of whom still
</p>
<p>survive him.

</p>
<p>John Scott.
</p>
<p>Among the prominent public men of Missouri who figured
</p>
<p>both before and after the state organization was John Scott,
</p>
<p>of St. Genevieve, a lawyer and politician of considerable
</p>
<p>eminence. He was born in Hanover County, Virginia, about
</p>
<p>the year 1782, and graduated at Princeton in 1802. He came
</p>
<p>West soon after graduating, and located in Indiana; and in
</p>
<p>1804 came to Missouri, and entered upon the practice of the
</p>
<p>law in St. Genevieve, where he remained until his death.
</p>
<p>In 18 17 he was chosen as a delegate in Congress from
</p>
<p>Missouri Territory, and upon the admission of Missouri as
</p>
<p>a state was elected to the Federal House of Representatives,
</p>
<p>the state being entitled to but one member.
</p>
<p>At one time he was as popular and almost as prominent in
</p>
<p>the state as Colonel Benton, but the unfortunate vote which
</p>
<p>he gave in the contest for the presidency between Jackson
</p>
<p>and Adams, in 1 824, drove him from public life, and destroyed
</p>
<p>his usefulness as a public man. He was the only represent-
</p>
<p>ative from Missouri, and gave the vote of the state to Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams, contrary to the wishes of his constituents, and
</p>
<p>against the expostulations of his most intimate personal and
</p>
<p>political friends. Mr. Scott was a warm admirer of Mr. Clay,
</p>
<p>who no doubt, to some extent, influenced his opinion. That
</p>
<p>he sincerely believed that it was not good policy to elevate
</p>
<p>to the office of chief magistrate a military man, and that
</p>
<p>Mr. Adams, in his opinion, possessed in a higher degree the
</p>
<p>qualifications of a statesman, is no doubt true; but he should
</p>
<p>have recollected that he was not casting his own vote, but
</p>
<p>that of his state, and should have conformed his action to
</p>
<p>what he must have known was the wish and will of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple. He made no further effort at political promotion, but
</p>
<p>spent the remainder of his life in the practice of the law.

<p>We met Mr. Scott at the Washington and St. Genevieve
</p>
<p>JOHN SCOTT. I 15
</p>
<p>courts several times. He was then in full practice, and in
</p>
<p>the full vigor of his intellect, and stood unquestionably at
</p>
<p>the head of the bar in his circuit. He made no effort at
</p>
<p>forensic display, but was a strong, logical, and impressive
</p>
<p>speaker. He was also a man of quick perception and un-
</p>
<p>bounded resources, which he could always command in a
</p>
<p>sudden emergency, as the following incident will illustrate :
</p>
<p>General Dodge, who became noted for his services in the
</p>
<p>Black Hawk War,, and Jack Smith T., a very noted man in
</p>
<p>Washington County, who had fought several duels and killed
</p>
<p>five or six men, were involved in a personal difficulty, and
</p>
<p>went armed to the teeth in anticipation of a meeting. Both
</p>
<p>were desperate and fearless, and it was well known that if
</p>
<p>they ever met it would result in the death of one or both.
</p>
<p>By the merest accident they arrived in St. Genevieve on the
</p>
<p>same day, and about the same hour, but fortunately put up at
</p>
<p>different hotels. Mr. Scott had business with Smith, and a
</p>
<p>specified time was agreed upon for a meeting at Scott's office ;
</p>
<p>but, near the time, Dodge called to see Scott, and as soon as
</p>
<p>he entered the office Scott remarked to him, "General, you
</p>
<p>had better leave, for I am expecting every minute Jack Smith
</p>
<p>T." Dodge, not wishing that his friend's office should be
</p>
<p>the scene of a personal encounter, said he thought so, too,
</p>
<p>and was in the act of taking up his hat, when Scott heard the
</p>
<p>step of Smith approaching his office, and, as there was no
</p>
<p>time for Dodge to escape, immediately opened the door,
</p>
<p>and taking Smith by the arm led him to Dodge, and said,
</p>
<p>" Colonel Sn^ith, permit me to introduce you to my friend.
</p>
<p>General Dodge," whereupon both bowed politely, and Dodge
</p>
<p>remarked, " I presume, gentlemen, you have business to-
</p>
<p>gether, and I will call at another time," and left the office.
</p>
<p>The ingenuity of Scott, and his remarkable presence of mind,
</p>
<p>enabled him to prevent his premises from being the scene of

</p>
<p>a bloody tragedy.
</p>
<p>He was a man of medium size, quick and active in his
</p>
<p>step, and very rapid in his enunciation. He always wore a
</p>
<p>cloth cap which almost covered his eyes, and no one ever
</p>
<p>Il6 BENCH AND BAN OF MISSOUKT.
</p>
<p>saw him with pantaloons that were not four times too large
</p>
<p>for him. In his attendance upon court he carried a large
</p>
<p>bag made of green baize, in which he placed his papers ;
</p>
<p>and that bag accompanied him wherever he went, even to
</p>
<p>the table, or on a visit to a friend. They were one and in-
</p>
<p>separable. The custom so common among English lawyers
</p>
<p>and barristers, of carrying green bags in Westminster Hall
</p>
<p>and the provincial courts, dates back to an early period ; for,
</p>
<p>according to Jeafferson, angry clients in the time of Charles
</p>
<p>II. were accustomed to revile their lawyers as "green bag
</p>
<p>carriers'' In Queen iVnne's time, to say that a man intended
</p>
<p>to carry a green bag was the same as saying that he meant
</p>
<p>to adopt the law as a profession. Mr. Jeafferson, in his ad-
</p>
<p>mirable and interesting work on lawyers, quotes the follow-
</p>
<p>ing passage from Dr. Arbuthnot's " History of John Bull," to
</p>
<p>show the prevalence of the phrase :
</p>
<p>" I am told, Cousin Diega, you are one of those that have
</p>
<p>undertaken to manage me, and that you have said you will
</p>
<p>carry a green bag yourself rather than we shall make an end
</p>
<p>of our lawsuit. I'll teach them, and you too, to manage."
</p>
<p>The green bag was regarded as a badge of honor, and the
</p>
<p>privilege of carrying it confined to a certain class of solicit-
</p>
<p>ors. In our own state we have no recollection of its being
</p>
<p>a constant habit with any lawyers except John Scott and
</p>
<p>Edward Bates; but it is more than probable that many
</p>
<p>others followed the same practice.
</p>
<p>In his intercourse with others, Mr. Scott was pleasant and
</p>
<p>entertaining, and took great delight in recounting the scenes
</p>
<p>of his youth and early manhood. Though an honorable
</p>
<p>man, he had his faults and frailties, among which was the
</p>
<p>habit of using profane language on all occasions, even in the
</p>
<p>society of ladies. Like a certain senator whose name it is un-
</p>
<p>necessary to give, he could not control it. It was said of the

<p>senator that on one occasion, when he arose to address the
</p>
<p>Senate, one of his friends, a Southern senator, requested him
</p>
<p>to yield for a moment, as he held in his hand a resolution
</p>
<p>which required the immediate action of the Senate ; and he
</p>
<p>JOHN SCOTT. I 17
</p>
<p>at once offered a resolution to suspend, until the senator
</p>
<p>from finished his speech, the rule of the Senate forbid-
</p>
<p>ding profanity in debate. Neither could make a grammat-
</p>
<p>ical speech without disobeying the third commandment.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scott was also in the habit of carrying pistols and
</p>
<p>knives about his person, a custom which he probably ac-
</p>
<p>quired in early life, when traveling from court to court on
</p>
<p>his circuit.
</p>
<p>In 18 17 he was chosen delegate to Congress, over Rufus
</p>
<p>Easton, by the following vote : Scott, 2,406; Easton, 2,014.
</p>
<p>When the returns came in from St. Charles, many votes were
</p>
<p>found for John Scoot, at which Scott became very indignant,
</p>
<p>supposing that it was an intentional mistake ; but the vote
</p>
<p>was counted for him, and no difficulty grew out of it.
</p>
<p>After he had passed his three score years and ten, we
</p>
<p>often met him at the Planters' House in St. Louis, and found
</p>
<p>him a most agreeable and entertaining gentleman. He took
</p>
<p>great delight in referring to his early days, and the early set-
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>tlement of the state, and recounted to us manv events in the
</p>
<p>pioneer life of the West which were not only new to us, but
</p>
<p>extremely interesting and entertaining. The people of St.
</p>
<p>Genevieve idolized him, and cherish his memory with the ut-
</p>
<p>most devotion ; for he was a man of the highest courage and
</p>
<p>most generous and noble impulses. He encountered several
</p>
<p>domestic afflictions, w'hich doubtless lessened his days. He
</p>
<p>died in St. Genevieve in 1861, in his eightieth year. He left

</p>
<p>There is no position more difificult to fill, and which fur-
</p>
<p>nishes so large a field for dissatisfaction and complaint, as
</p>
<p>that of a iiisi-prius ]\idgQ\ and it is gratifying to be able to
</p>
<p>name one whose judicial administration was the subject of
</p>
<p>universal praise.
</p>
<p>Judge Ezra Hunt for many years presided over the circuit
</p>
<p>comprising the counties of Pike, Lincoln, St. Charles, War-
</p>
<p>ren, Ralls, and Montgomery. He was born in Milford,
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, on April 7, 1790, and entered the freshman
</p>
<p>class at Harvard in 1812; became greatly distinguished in
</p>
<p>mathematics, which subject was assigned him at commence-
</p>
<p>ment when he graduated.
</p>
<p>Upon leaving college he was appointed preceptor of
</p>
<p>Leicester Academy, a position which he held till the latter
</p>
<p>part of 1 8 14, when he returned to Cambridge with the inten-
</p>
<p>tion of studying divinity, but was soon after persuaded to
</p>
<p>take charge of an academy in Pulaski, Tennessee. His
</p>
<p>health failing him there, he determined to cross the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi, and reached St. Louis in 1 8 19 or 1820, entered the
</p>
<p>law-office of Judge William C. Carr, and while pursuing his
</p>

<p>the advantages of a classical education, but was a diligent
</p>
<p>EZRA HUNT. I I9
</p>
<p>student throughout hfe. His fondness for literary pursuits,
</p>
<p>and his love for legal research, caused him to accumulate a
</p>
<p>fine librar\', by the use of which, aided by a discriminating
</p>
<p>and logical mind, he became a sound lawyer and ripe scholar.
</p>
<p>As a husband and father he was kind and indulgent ; and as
</p>
<p>a jurist, learned, just, and truer
</p>
<p>Our acquaintance with Judge Hunt commenced about
</p>
<p>1840, at Warrenton, where he w^as holding a term of his court.
</p>
<p>It was under circumstances which impressed us most favor-
</p>
<p>ably towards him. We had been retained in the Franklin
</p>
<p>court to defend a man charged with perjury, and upon exam-
</p>
<p>ining the indictment found it substantially defective, but did
</p>
<p>not think it advisable to move to quash, as the grand jur}'
</p>
<p>was in session and another indictment was certain to follow.
</p>
<p>We therefore deemed it gcfod policy to apply for a change
</p>
<p>of venue, and the case was sent to the Warren court. There
</p>
<p>we filed our motion to quash, containing eighteen objections
</p>
<p>to the indictment. The next morning it was called for argu-
</p>
<p>ment, when we arose and read it, and as we were about to en-
</p>
<p>ter upon the argument, Judge Hunt interrupted us with the
</p>
<p>remark, " The motion is sustained ; for any indictment which
</p>
<p>can elicit eighteen olijeetions must be fatally defective ^ Thus
</p>
<p>I lost my speech, but saved m}- client. Whispering to a law-
</p>
<p>yer near us, we remarked, " How does he know that the in-
</p>
<p>dictment is defective, when he has not heard it read? " The
</p>
<p>reply was, "Never you mind; he knows more about that
</p>
<p>indictment than you suppose." Seeing a smile upon the face
</p>
<p>of the clerk of the court, we asked him if the judge had seen
</p>
<p>the indictment. " Why," said he, " lie took it to his room last
</p>
<p>night, and kept it till early this mor^iingl'
</p>
<p>It has been said by some that he was wanting in dignity.
</p>
<p>This no doubt grew out of the fact that, when counsel were
</p>
<p>engaged in a long and tedious argument to the jury, he

</p>
<p>would frequently leave the bench and take a seat by some
</p>
<p>old farmer in the audience to indulge in a pleasant conversa-
</p>
<p>tion ; but we never regarded this as any exhibition of a want
</p>
<p>of that dignity which is necessary in the administration of
</p>
<p>justice. He was not a man who would attempt to impress
</p>
<p>I20 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>an audience witli ;i sense of his own importance, for he was
</p>
<p>ver\' iinassiiining, and cared notliing for office except so far
</p>
<p>as it enabled him to accomphsh sometliing for the pnbhc
</p>
<p>good.
</p>
<p>Judge Hunt had no pohtical aspirations, though in 1845
</p>
<p>he took a seat in the Convention called to revise our State
</p>
<p>Constitution ; but that was more of a judicial than polit-
</p>
<p>ical body  and gave a wide scope to the exercise of his
</p>
<p>judicial mind. He was made chairman of the Judiciary
</p>
<p>Committee, and rendered valuable service to his adopted
</p>
<p>state. In his private intercourse he was social and genial,
</p>
<p>and had a vivid appreciation of the humorous. We recol-
</p>
<p>lect upon one occasion, when a most ludicrous scene took
</p>
<p>place in the court-room, he left the bench, went to tlie rear
</p>
<p>of the court-house, and laughed till his very sides shook.
</p>
<p>He loved a good joke, and could take as well as perpetrate
</p>
<p>one. The sallies of wit that often passed between lawyers,
</p>
<p>and sometimes between the bench and the bar, he relished
</p>
<p>hugely.
</p>
<p>In the latter part of his life he was much troubled with
</p>
<p>weakness of his eyes, and when unable to read would cause
</p>
<p>others to read for him. He was, in fact, what is termed in
</p>
<p>common parlance a book-worm ; and to take from him the
</p>
<p>pleasure of reading, or hearing others read, was to deprive
</p>
<p>him of one of the chief enjoyments of life.
</p>
<p>One of his chief characteristics was his kindness to the
</p>
<p>younger members of the profession. He always received
</p>
<p>them on terms of intimacv, and in court endeavored to
</p>
<p>relieve them of the embarrassment that most generally
</p>
<p>attends a young practitioner. It was a pleasure to practice
</p>
<p>before him, and it was seldom that an)' one ever spoke dis-
</p>
<p>respectfully of his rulings or decisions. On his way from
</p>
<p>the court-room to the hotel he was accosted every i^w steps

<p>by some old farmer who desired to shake hands w ith him.
</p>
<p>In fact, he was a universal favorite with the people, and fully
</p>
<p>justified the confidence they reposed in him.
</p>
<p>His death occurred September 19, i860, and was very
</p>
<p>sudden. He was at the time engaged in a ver}- pleasant
</p>
<p>EZRA HUNT. 121
</p>
<p>conversation with a young lady, and in an instant fell and
</p>
<p>expired. Half an hour before, he had closed a speech in
</p>
<p>the court-house. He was over sri'aitj' years of age, and
</p>
<p>had been a citizen of Missouri about forty years.
</p>
<p>He fulfilled to a larger extent the requirements of a nisi-
</p>
<p>priiis judge than any one before whom we practiced ; and it
</p>
<p>was very gratif}'ing to witness the kind feeling existing
</p>
<p>between him and the bar. No murmur or expression of dis-
</p>
<p>appointment followed his decisions, and very few indeed
</p>
<p>were reversed by the appellate court.
</p>
<p>Judge Hunt, in his social and private relations, was one of
</p>
<p>the best men we ever met. He was never heard to speak in
</p>
<p>harsh terms of any one, and we question if his heart ever
</p>
<p>bore malice to an}- living being. In sentencing criminals he
</p>
<p>never indulged in harsh or unfeeling language, but, on the
</p>
<p>contrary, manifested much sympathy for their unfortunate
</p>
<p>condition  more particularly if the offender was young in
</p>
<p>years, and not inured to crime.
</p>
<p>To show the great confidence reposed in his honesty and
</p>
<p>uprightness, we give an incident that occurred when he was
</p>
<p>at the bar. An elderly lady called to retain him in a case
</p>
<p>in which she was a party, and commenced to relate the facts,
</p>
<p>when Judge H. interrupted her by saying, " Stop, stop,
</p>
<p>madam ; I am sorry to say that I am already engaged by your
</p>
<p>opponent, and am not allowed to acton both sides." " Why
</p>
<p>not?" said the good, confiding woman ; " I want nothing but
</p>
<p>what is right, and I know you will not do an}-thing that is
</p>
<p>wrong; so, why can you not settle this matter at once ?"
</p>
<p>It is said when he looked further into the case he found that
</p>
<p>there was really no substantial ground for a suit, and at his
</p>
<p>instance it was amicably settled to the satisfaction of both
</p>
<p>parties.
</p>
<p>Judge Hunt was noted for his illegible writing. A man by

<p>the name of Gregory once called upon him for his opinion
</p>
<p>in a land suit, and the judge promised to write out and send
</p>
<p>it to him as soon as he could consult his books. In due time
</p>
<p>the opinion came ; but neither Gregory nor any other person
</p>
<p>could read it. Some time afterwards Gregory called upon
</p>
<p>122 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>the judge to read it for him ; and after a partial examination
</p>
<p>of it, the judge said, " Some d  d fool has been trying to
</p>
<p>write, but failed." Gregory then said, "Judge, did you ever
</p>
<p>write to me about that case of mine?" The judge took the
</p>
<p>liiiit, got the cue, and read it off easily, saying, " Anybody
</p>
<p>but a d  d fool could read that."
</p>
<p>Judge Hunt greatly relished a piece of genuine wit, and
</p>
<p>was himself the author of many witty sayings, particularly
</p>
<p>when on the bench ; and, like Lord Ellenborough, never per-
</p>
<p>mitted any opportunity to pass without indulging in it.
</p>
<p>It is said that the great English jurist would not even spare
</p>
<p>an unoffending witness. In the progress of a trial before
</p>
<p>him a surgeon was placed on the witness-stand, and the first
</p>
<p>question put to him was as to his occupation. He replied,
</p>
<p>"I employ myself as a surgeon." "But," interposed Lord
</p>
<p>Ellenborough, " does anybody else employ you as a sur-

<p>geon ?"
</p>
<p>Samuel H. Gardner.
</p>
<p>Nothing affords us more pleasure than to place upon rec-
</p>
<p>ord our recollection of this gentleman, who was our dear
</p>
<p>friend, and who was greatly esteemed by the people of the
</p>
<p>city of St. Louis.
</p>
<p>His father was a very intelligent farmer in western New-
</p>
<p>York, and took great pains to educate his children ; and at
</p>
<p>a very early age sent Samuel to the academy in the village
</p>
<p>of Canajoharie, where he obtained the rudiments of a good
</p>
<p>English education. Li another institution of the same town,
</p>
<p>called the Ames Academy, where Latin, French, and the
</p>
<p>higher branches of mathematics were taught, he completed
</p>
<p>his education, and soon after commenced the study of the
</p>
<p>law in the office of Cagger & Hill, at Albany, a firm noted
</p>
<p>for their great ability and extensive practice. The studious
</p>
<p>habits of Mr. Gardner, and the great advantages he enjoyed
</p>
<p>under the tuition of such eminent men for a period of three
</p>
<p>years, could not otherwise than qualify him for the practice
</p>
<p>of his profession. He obtained a license to practice there,
</p>
<p>but not wath any intention of making New York his home,
</p>
<p>for he had determined upon emigrating to the West and
</p>
<p>joining his brother, A. M. Gardner, Esq., in St. Louis, then a
</p>
<p>practicing lawyer at that place. Mr. Gardner reached St.
</p>
<p>Louis in 1847, which must have been in his twenty-third
</p>
<p>year; for he was born some time in 1824.
</p>
<p>In 1852 the author moved to St. Louis, and opened an of-
</p>
<p>fice adjoining Mr. Gardner's, w-hich soon brought us in very
</p>
<p>intimate relations with him. We found him a whole-souled,
</p>
<p>genial gentleman, of generous impulses and a high sense
</p>
<p>of professional honor. He had a fair practice, which was
</p>
<p>daily increasing, and he was held in high estimation by his
</p>
<p>fellow-citizens.

</p>
<p>In 1856 the people of St. Louis selected him as one of
</p>
<p>124 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>their representatives in the State Legislature, where he soon
</p>
<p>took a prominent part both in llic debates and on important
</p>
<p>committees. His excellent judgment, business tact, and
</p>
<p>fine practical common sense gave him great weight with
</p>
<p>the members, and enabled him to accomplish much for the
</p>
<p>good of his constituents. His style of speaking was cogent
</p>
<p>and logical, and he aimed to convince the understanding
</p>
<p>rather tiian please the fancy. He regarded eloquence as a
</p>
<p>very desirable gift, but only useful when well directed. On
</p>
<p>his return from the Legislature he made a partnership with
</p>
<p>his brother, wliich continued till his death.
</p>
<p>\\\ 1862, during the height of the Rebellion, and when a
</p>
<p>reign of terror prevailed throughout the state, Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>appointed him collector of the internal revenue for the St.
</p>
<p>Louis District, which office he filled till his death, on De-
</p>
<p>cember 24, 1864. Considering the excited state of the pub-
</p>
<p>lic mind, and the embarrassed condition of the country, it
</p>
<p>was one of the most difficult and responsible offices to fill
</p>
<p>within the gift of the president. Millions upon millions of
</p>
<p>dollars had to pass through his hands, and he was daily
</p>
<p>called upon to give a construction to revenue laws of recent
</p>
<p>enactment. Yet, when his books and accounts were exam-
</p>
<p>ined, after his death, everything was found in perfect order,
</p>
<p>as he had accounted for every dollar that came into his
</p>
<p>hands. Mr. Lincoln had no better revenue officer during his
</p>
<p>administration; and' when Mr. Gardner died, the city of St.
</p>
<p>Louis lost one of her most valued and esteemed citizens.
</p>
<p>We loved him as a brother, stood at his bedside when
</p>
<p>his spirit took its flight, and beside the grave that was pre-
</p>
<p>pared to receive his mortal remains.
</p>
<p>His patriotic devotion to the Union, and his love of coun-
</p>
<p>try, showed most brightly during the darkest days of the
</p>
<p>Rebellion. In that eventful period, when the dark cloud of

<p>secession hung like a heavy pall over our state, and every-
</p>
<p>thing portended evil and disaster, his confidence in the final
</p>
<p>result never wavered for a moment. His support of IVIr.

<p>Lincoln's administration, aside from any interest growing out
</p>
<p>of the position he held, was steadfast and unwavering. He

</p>
<p>was in daily intercourse with Frank Blair and General Lyon
</p>
<p>at and during the Camp Jackson time, and the course pur-
</p>
<p>sued by General Lyon was in accord with his views.
</p>
<p>Among strangers Mr. Gardner was reserved and distant,
</p>
<p>but with his friends, full of life and merriment. Nothing gave
</p>
<p>him so much delight as to get a good joke on a friend, and
</p>
<p>he made it tell for all it was worth. He married a Miss
</p>
<p>Van Rensselaer, of Albany, New York, who, with three in-
</p>
<p>teresting children, survived him. His domestic relations were
</p>
<p>exceedingly happy, and to no man was life more desirable.
</p>
<p>The day before his death we drew his will, and when it was
</p>
<p>signed and witnessed he said, " I am content ; and the only
</p>
<p>regret I feel in meeting the summons is the necessity it im-
</p>
<p>poses of leaving behind me those I so dearly love." He

<p>eth forth like a flower, and is cut down."
</p>
<p>Edward Bates.
</p>
<p>In referring to the early lawyers of Missouri we can recall
</p>
<p>no one whose memory is more revered than that of the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of this sketch, who was attorney-general under President
</p>
<p>Lincoln.
</p>
<p>He was born in Belmont, Goochland County, Virginia,
</p>
<p>September 4, 1793, and received an academic education.
</p>
<p>His ancestors were Quakers, but his father, though belong-
</p>
<p>ing to that sect, was too fervid a patriot to stand by and see
</p>
<p>his country struggling for her independence without lending
</p>
<p>a helping hand. So he joined the army and fought through
</p>
<p>the Revolution ; and for so doing was disowned by the
</p>
<p>Quakers. He had twelve children, Edward being the
</p>
<p>seventh son. The latter came to Missouri in 18 14, his
</p>
<p>brother Frederick being secretary of the territory, and after-
</p>
<p>wards governor. He immediately entered upon the study of
</p>
<p>the law, in the office of Rufus Easton, and was admitted
</p>
<p>to the bar in 18 16, at the time we adopted the common
</p>
<p>law.
</p>
<p>In 1820 he was chosen a delegate to the State Constitu-
</p>
<p>tional Convention, and rendered valuable assistance in the
</p>
<p>formation of our fundamental law; and in the same year was
</p>
<p>appointed attorney-general. In 1822 he became a member
</p>
<p>of the first Legislature, the state not receiving final admission
</p>
<p>into the Union until 182 1. In 1824 lie was appointed, by
</p>
<p>President Monroe, United States attorney for the Missouri
</p>
<p>District. In 1827 he was elected to Congress and served a
</p>
<p>full term. In 1830 he was sent to the State Senate, and in
</p>
<p>1834 was a member of the popular branch of the General
</p>
<p>Assembly. In 1850 President Fillmore tendered him a seat
</p>
<p>in his Cabinet as secretary of war, which he declined, though
</p>
<p>he had been confirmed by the Senate. In 1853 he was

</p>
<p>elected judge of the St. Louis Land Court, a court created
</p>
<p>EDWARD BATES. I 2/
</p>
<p>for the purpose of taking special cognizance of cases involv-
</p>
<p>ing real-estate litigation.
</p>
<p>Upon the assembling of the Whig National Convention at
</p>
<p>Baltimore, in 1856, he was chosen president, and- presided
</p>
<p>over its deliberations with marked ability. In 1858 he was
</p>
<p>honored by Harvard University with the degree of Doctor
</p>
<p>of Laws. In 1861 he was selected by Mr. Lincoln as his
</p>
<p>attorney-general, and held the office until his resignation in
</p>
<p>1863, and died in St. Louis, March 25, 1869, at the age of
</p>
<p>seventy-six.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bates belonged to the old Whig party, and when we
</p>
<p>consider that he had allied himself to an organization which
</p>
<p>in Missouri was always in the minority, his public life was
</p>
<p>certainly a success. At one time he was regarded as a
</p>
<p>violent partisan, and published a pamphlet in denunciation
</p>
<p>of Colonel Benton marked with great vindictiveness and
</p>
<p>violent prejudice  so much so that it was regarded as an
</p>
<p>ebullition of ill-will, rather than a calm and dignified accu-
</p>
<p>sation. We have reason to believe that in after-life he much
</p>
<p>regretted it, and would have recalled it if it had been in his
</p>
<p>power, for it was in conflict with every instinct of his
</p>
<p>nature.
</p>
<p>Our acquaintance with Mr. Bates commenced in the win-
</p>
<p>ter of 1836-7, just before we obtained our majority. He was
</p>
<p>attending the Franklin Circuit Court, and was engaged in an
</p>
<p>important chancery suit, in which issues were framed and
</p>
<p>sent to a jury to be tried. The question^ involved were
</p>
<p>rather intricate, and after a tedious trial of several days the
</p>
<p>jury failed to agree, and were discharged. The fact leaked
</p>
<p>out that after the jury retired to consider of their verdict,
</p>
<p>one of them, a fellow by the name of Childers, rose and ad-
</p>
<p>dressed his fellow-jurors as follows : " Gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>without intending to arrogate to myself any superior wisdom,
</p>

<p>favor of that proposition will raise their hands;" and up
</p>
<p>went the hands of the entire panel. Bryan Mullanphy was
</p>
<p>attending the court, and made a profile of the jur)-, which
</p>
<p>circulated through the court-room to the great amusement
</p>
<p>of the bench and bar. Among the older citizens the panel
</p>
<p>is known to this day as the '' intelligent jury ^ In after-years
</p>
<p>Mr. Bates often alluded to it as an incident m his professional
</p>
<p>Hfe.
</p>
<p>Few men in the state were better known to the profession
</p>
<p>than Mr. Bates, for his social and genial habits rendered him
</p>
<p>a universal favorite ; and when lawyers from the different
</p>
<p>parts of the state visited St. Louis, they made it a point to
</p>
<p>call upon him. He always took a deep interest in those who
</p>
<p>were starting out in the profession, and gave them every aid
</p>
<p>in his power  invited them to his house, and introduced
</p>
<p>them to other attorneys. In his manner he was easy, polite,
</p>
<p>and affable, and if you met him a dozen times a day, he
</p>
<p>would each time salute you with a pleasant smile or word.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bates was a natural orator, and gifted with all the
</p>
<p>graces of elocution. He had a sweet, musical voice, and
</p>
<p>words fell from his lips without any apparent labor.
</p>
<p>Whether in a deliberative or promiscuous body, at a dinner-
</p>
<p>party or social gathering, he could make an interesting
</p>
<p>speech without a moment's preparation, and upon any sub-
</p>
<p>ject that could be introduced. No sudden or unexpected
</p>
<p>call could disconcert him for a moment. When he was called
</p>
<p>upon to preside-over the Internal Improvement Convention
</p>
<p>held in Chicago previous to the war, he arose to return his
</p>
<p>thanks, and delivered an address which perfectly electrified
</p>
<p>the assembly, and gave him a national reputation as an ora-
</p>
<p>tor. All his efforts were extemporaneous, and some of the
</p>
<p>finest were delivered upon the spur of the moment. In legal
</p>
<p>acumen we never thought him the equal of Mr. Geyer.

<p>tionist he was superior to either.
</p>
<p>In 1823 Judge Bates married Julia D. Coalter, of South
</p>
<p>Carolina, a most estimable lady, who still survives him. He
</p>
<p>also left eleven or twelve children. He was not only prolific

</p>
<p>himself, but came from a very prolific family, for he, as be-
</p>
<p>fore stated, was the seventh son out of a family of twelve
</p>
<p>children.
</p>
<p>While Mr, Bates was judge of the Land Court he did us
</p>
<p>a favor for which we have thanked him a thousand times, yet
</p>
<p>we then thought it an act of unkindness. In November, 1855,
</p>
<p>we received from the Pacific Railroad Company an invitation
</p>
<p>to join in the expedition to Jefferson City intended to cele-
</p>
<p>brate the opening of the road to that point. On the day set
</p>
<p>apart for the expedition we had a land case docketed for trial,
</p>
<p>and with other attorneys who had cases set for that day and
</p>
<p>the day following we united in a strong appeal to the judge to
</p>
<p>adjourn his court for a few days, to enable us to join in the
</p>
<p>celebration; but he positively refused, and seemed a little irri-
</p>
<p>tated at the request. Of course there was no otlier alternative
</p>
<p>but to remain. The next morning the train started with 600
</p>
<p>souls on board, and at the Gasconade Bridge fifty of them
</p>
<p>found their graves.
</p>
<p>It was one of the most terrible disasters that had occurred
</p>
<p>in any part of the United States. Nearly the whole train
</p>
<p>went down with the bridge, killing members of the General
</p>
<p>Assembly on their way to the seat of government, prominent
</p>
<p>ministers, physicians, merchants, and lawyers ; besides seri-
</p>
<p>ousl}' injuring a large number, some of whom can still be seen
</p>
<p>on the streets of St. Louis, hobbling about upon crutches.
</p>
<p>Judge Bates often referred to his refusal to adjourn court,
</p>
<p>and seemed to regard it as a providential act.
</p>
<p>There are a few anecdotes of Mr. Bates worth preserving.
</p>
<p>He was a great admirer of the common-law system of plead-
</p>
<p>ing, and could almost repeat Chitty from memory; but Chitty
</p>
<p>once involved him in a difficulty which resulted in the loss of a
</p>
<p>good friend. A man by the name of Mackay was the con-
</p>
<p>firmee of a Spanish grant in St. Charles County, embracing
</p>
<p>several thousand acres of fine land. Upon this grant, as was

</p>
<p>not unusual in those days, divers people had squatted and
</p>
<p>made good improvements, and were living comfortably by
</p>
<p>cultivating Mackay's soil ; and many were in the habit of
</p>
<p>cutting cord-wood and selling it to the boats plying on the

</p>
<p>Mississippi River. Upon the death of Alackay his widow
</p>
<p>and executrix determined to bring suit against those who
</p>
<p>had thus trespassed, and retained ]\Ir. Bates (who then
</p>
<p>resided in St. Charles) for that purpose. Mr. Bates had in
</p>
<p>his office some printed blank declarations for actions of
</p>
<p>trespass, after the form laid down by Chitty, and directed
</p>
<p>his clerk to fill them up against about fifteen defendants,
</p>
<p>which he did  charging each with cutting down 10,000 oak
</p>
<p>trees, 10,000 hickory trees, 1 0,000 ash trees, 10,000 maple
</p>
<p>trees, 10,000 sycamore trees, and 10,000 walnut trees.
</p>
<p>The sheriff of the county called upon the defendants to
</p>
<p>ser\^e them with process, one of whom  a man by the name
</p>
<p>of Burdyne  was a great admirer of Mr. Bates. When the
</p>
<p>sheriff finished reading the declaration to Burdyne, the latter
</p>
<p>became greatly excited, and remarked that it was " all a d  d
</p>
<p>lie," and he did not see how "so good a man as Mr. Bates
</p>
<p>could write so man\- d  d lies on so small a piece of paper."
</p>
<p>Burdyne no doubt became fully impressed with the moral
</p>
<p>deprav'ity of mankind in general, and ]Mr. Bates in partic-
</p>
<p>ular.
</p>
<p>In addressing juries ^Ir. Bates not unfrequently digressed
</p>
<p>from the subject under consideration, and launched forth into
</p>
<p>an interesting and elegant description of the early settle-
</p>
<p>ments, the habits, customs, and priv^ations of the pioneers, etc.
</p>
<p>More particularly was it the case when he found on the jury
</p>
<p>one or more men of advanced years. Upon one of these
</p>
<p>occasions, while engaged in the trial of a land suit in the
</p>
<p>United States Circuit Court at St. Louis, before Judge Catron,
</p>
<p>involving questions of boundary, settlement, and cultivation,
</p>
<p>Mr. Bates in his address to the jur\-, most of whom had
</p>
<p>passed the meridian of life, indulged freely in his favorite
</p>
<p>theme, and in the midst of one of his most eloquent flights,
</p>
<p>while a breathless silence pervaded the court-room. Judge

<p>suddenly interrupted him :
</p>
<p>"Mr. Bates,' said the judge, "you have given us a very
</p>
<p>interesting histor>^ of the early settlement of the countr}%
</p>
<p>and of tlie privations and difficulties encountered by the
</p>
<p>EDWARD BATES. 13I
</p>
<p>early inhabitants; you have given us a glowing description
</p>
<p>of the velvet forests w ith their creeping vines and h(jney-
</p>

</p>
<p>flowers ; you have talked of the red men and their scalping-
</p>
<p>knives and tomahawks  non', Mr. Bates, please tell iis some-
</p>
<p>thing about the case lue are trying!'
</p>
<p>In earl}' times Mr, Bates and Elijah Bettis, of Wayne
</p>
<p>County, were members of the Legislature. ]\Ir. Bates stood
</p>
<p>first on the roll, and Bettis next. They differed in politics,
</p>
<p>and a further distinction was, Bates was full of mischief, and
</p>
<p>Bettis knew as little how to vote as any member of the
</p>
<p>House. This annoyed him, and he was advised, whenever
</p>
<p>a political question was up, to watch Bates and vote just
</p>
<p>the opposite way. This came to Bates' ear, so he often
</p>
<p>voted wrong on purpose, and was followed by Bettis, who
</p>
<p>made it a point to be ''agin Bates." Then, when the call of
</p>
<p>the roll was through, Bates would arise and obtain leave to
</p>
<p>change his vote, and Bettis in turn would ask leave to change
</p>
<p>his. Bettis' " id-e-e was, so he voted agin Bates it was sartin
</p>
<p>to be Democratical."
</p>
<p>]\Ir. Bates was a monomaniac on the subject of " tax
</p>
<p>titles," and while on the bench of the Land Court resorted
</p>
<p>to every conceivable plan to overthrow a title predicated
</p>
<p>upon a tax sale. In an action of ejectment pending in his
</p>
<p>court the plaintiff relied upon a tax title, and when he in-
</p>
<p>troduced his deed in evidence the judge scrutinized it very
</p>
<p>closely, and found the land described as " N. E. qr. of
</p>
<p>S. .. qr. of S. 4, T. 40," and the following scene took
</p>
<p>place :
</p>
<p>" Mr. Counsel, what do the letters ' N. E.,' in this deed,
</p>
<p>stand for?"
</p>
<p>" North-east, if your honor please."
</p>
<p>" >sorth-east? North-east? What evidence is there before
</p>
<p>this court to show that they mean any such thing ? "

<p>"The letters 'X. E.' are usually used by surveyors to des-
</p>

<p>"The objection to the introduction of the deed is sus-
</p>
<p>tained upon the ground of uncertainty in the description of
</p>
<p>the premises. Plaintiff takes nonsuit, w ith leave," etc.
</p>
<p>Judge Bates at times was very technical, and would sustain
</p>
<p>a trivial objection if it afforded the means of getting rid of
</p>
<p>a case which he did not wish to try, or which he was satisfied
</p>
<p>was destitute of merit.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bates possessed many qualities which, combined, tend
</p>
<p>to form the highest type of character. His easy, dignified,
</p>
<p>and refined manner made him very accessible to all, and his
</p>
<p>society was greatly sought, particularly by the younger
</p>
<p>members of the profession, in whom he always took a deep
</p>
<p>interest. By them he was almost idolized.
</p>
<p>The want of a contemporaneous record of his speeches
</p>
<p>in some of the important criminal trials in St. Louis is greatly
</p>
<p>felt  particularly by the bar of our state. We have looked
</p>
<p>in vain to find even a synopsis of his great speech in case of
</p>
<p>the Montesquiou brothers, French counts, who were tried in
</p>
<p>our Criminal Court for murder, about thirty years ago. The
</p>
<p>state was represented by James R. Lackland and Uriel
</p>
<p>Wright, and the defense conducted by Mr. Bates, Henry S.
</p>
<p>Geyer, Wilson Primm, and Charles Gibson. There is no re-
</p>
<p>port of the trial in print. It was one of the most interesting
</p>
<p>cases that had transpired in the United States, and a de-
</p>
<p>tailed statement of the facts has been given to the St. Louis
</p>
<p>Historical Society in a recent communication from Charles
</p>
<p>Gibson, Esq., the only surviving counsel for the defense. By
</p>
<p>way of preserving some slight record of this novel and un-
</p>
<p>paralleled case, we give an extract from Mr. Gibson's com-

</p>
<p>"Gentlemen: I am the last survivor of the members of the bar who were

<p>connected witli the trial of the Counts de Montesquiou. As it was the most
</p>
<p>celebrated and dramatic trial that ever took place in Missouri, I presume it is

</p>
<p>proper for me to state, as nearly as I can now remember, all the facts con-
</p>
<p>nected with it, as a part of our local history.
</p>
<p>" It is within a few months of thirty years since these events occurred. The
</p>
<p>change in everything around me is so complete that I do not exaggerate
</p>
<p>when I say that I feel as if I am speaking to a new generation and another
</p>
<p>people. Those individual characteristics and peculiarities which then
</p>
<p>marked all our prominent citizens have yielded to the necessarily severe dis-
</p>
<p>cipline of a great city. The uniforms of the officers of the regular army,
</p>
<p>then so common on the streets and at all social gatherings, have gone, with
</p>
<p>the military posts, far to the west of us. The courtesy and civilities in man-
</p>
<p>ners and language which the then still existing code undoubtedly fostered and
</p>
<p>sustained, especially among members of the bar, have, to a certain extent,
</p>
<p>disappeared with the code itself. The contrast between a great criminal trial
</p>
<p>thirty years ago, in which the entire community took a profound interest, and
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the present day in the Four Courts, has to be seen in order
</p>
<p>to be understood and fully appreciated. Still, it may be useful to preserve
</p>
<p>the main facts of this case.
</p>
<p>"The Counts Gonzalve and Raymond de Montesquiou came to this country,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of making the tour of Canada and the United States for
</p>
<p>health and pleasure, in 1849. They first went to Canada, bearing letters of
</p>
<p>introduction from the French minister of foreign relations, one of which I
</p>
<p>have here. After spending some time at Niagara, they visited Chicago, and
</p>
<p>from there started out on a hunt through Illinois. In one day they killed
</p>
<p>two hundred and fifty-odd prairie chickens, showing, not only how plentiful
</p>
<p>the chickens then were, but how deadly was the aim of both of them.
</p>
<p>"After spending a day at Alton, they came on to St. Louis and took rooms
</p>
<p>at the City Hotel, corner of Third and Vine Streets, then kept by the late
</p>
<p>Theron Barnum, Esq. In the evening, after they had retired to their rooms,
</p>
<p>and about bed-time, but while some persons were still in the hall, Gonzalve,
</p>
<p>the elder one, who had previously given no sign of the deadly monomania
</p>
<p>which had seized him, took up his shot-gun, rushed out into the hall, and fired
</p>
<p>twice, killing Albert Jones and Kirby Barnum (a nephew of the landlord),
</p>
<p>and severely wounding three other men  all well-known and worthy citizens.
</p>
<p>Fortunately for the two brothers they were instantly arrested and hurried off

<p>to jail, corner of Sixth and Chestnut Streets, where the Laclede Hotel now
</p>
<p>stands. Afterwards a great and angry crowd, filling Chestnut and Sixth
</p>
<p>Streets for some distances assembled at the jail with the avowed purpose of
</p>
<p>lynching the prisoners. The danger became so great that they were slipped
</p>
<p>out of a side door and taken through the alley running from the jail to Mar-
</p>
<p>ket Street, and thence to Jefferson Barracks. The jail was guarded by the
</p>
<p>St. Louis Greys, Captain West, and the prisoners were escorted by them
</p>
<p>beyond the city. At first the opinion was general among all classes that they
</p>
<p>were not noblemen, but impostors and murderers. It soon became known,
</p>
<p>however, who and what they were. Their grandfather was a nobleman of the
</p>
<p>ancient rrginie, and also a high officer in the army of Napoleon. He was
</p>
<p>wounded in battle, the ball tearing away the skin of the abdomen, so that the
</p>
<p>bowels protruded; but he pushed them back, had himself wrapped round

</p>
<p>swept down in a shower of bullets. Their grandmother was the governess of
</p>
<p>the King of Rome, a great favorite of Napoleon, and is spoken of in Theirs'
</p>
<p>' Consulate and Empire ' as the good Mme. de Montesquieu. Their brother-in-
</p>
<p>law, the Viscount de Cessac, who came here from Paris to attend the trial,
</p>
<p>was the son of Lacue, duke and minister of war under the republic and the
</p>
<p>empire. He it was whom Bonaparte, when a young otificer, so importuned for
</p>
<p>a command that he was politely ordered out of the war office. The emperor,
</p>
<p>however, not only forgave the act, but loaded his faithful servant with the title
</p>
<p>of duke, and many other high honors. De Cessac had himself been decorated
</p>
<p>with the cross of the Legion of Honor by Napoleon HI. M. Borg, French
</p>
<p>vice-consul at New York, attended both trials in his official capacity.
</p>
<p>" The first trial was held in the west wing of the court-house, then in one
</p>
<p>apartment, covered with a brick floor. Judge J. B. Colt, who had been
</p>
<p>recently wounded in a duel on Bloody Island, presided. James R. Lackland
</p>
<p>was prosecuting attorney, and was assisted by Uriel Wright. The defense was
</p>
<p>conducted by Edward Bates and Henry S. Geyer, Wilson Primm, an accom-
</p>
<p>plished French scholar and lawyer, and myself, as a young attorney, assisting.
</p>
<p>Gonzalve declared all through that he killed the men by God's direction, and
</p>
<p>that he was ordered by a special providence to kill two men. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>Raymond was willing to die if they would release his poor insane brother.
</p>
<p>"The trial lasted many days. The forensic contention was magnificent.
</p>
<p>Lackland, severe and inexorable, and Wright, eloquent and brilliant, portrayed
</p>
<p>the scene which sent two innocent men so suddenly to early and bloody graves
</p>
<p>with such effects, and aroused the feelings of their personal friends and rela-
</p>
<p>tives and the native American and foreign elements to such fury, that a special
</p>
<p>guard was appointed to protect the prisoners in going to and from the jail to
</p>
<p>the court-house during the trial.
</p>
<p>" On the other side, the trial was largely attended, not merely by our best citi-
</p>
<p>zens, but nearly the whole of the spacious apartment was filled by the most
</p>
<p>refined and aristocratic ladies, old and young, of the city. Cool and sensible
</p>
<p>people considered the act of firing without the slightest cause upon a crowd of
</p>
<p>promiscuous strangers as, ipso facto, conclusive proof of insanity.

<p>touching to an extraordinary degree. He could not speak English, and was,
</p>
<p>therefore, practically deaf and dumb. He was in a foreign land, and belonged
</p>
<p>to an order opposed to its institutions and the feelings of its inhabitants. He
</p>
<p>was yet in his teens, and the brother, on whom he naturally would rely, was
</p>
<p>hopelessly insane. The Revolution of 1848 had driven kings and emperors
</p>
<p>from their thrones, and threatened the entire extinction of the nobility to which
</p>
<p>he belonged. Young, handsome, amiable, and intelligent, a nobleman of the
</p>
<p>first rank, with an ancestral name whose luster shone far back into the Middle
</p>
<p>Ages, he stood at the bar of justice to answer with his life and honor an indict-
</p>
<p>ment for murder I
</p>
<p>"Such a case as this, presented to the court and jury by such lawyers and
</p>
<p>orators as Geyer and Bates  peers of Clay and Webster, and the conceded
</p>
<p>leaders of the bar  could not fail to be thrilling and profoundly impressive.

</p>
<p>" The prosecution contended that both brothers had participated in the homi-
</p>
<p>cide. Botli of them wore long beards, had a certain family resemblance, and
</p>
<p>foreign airs and appearance. Now, prior to the Rebellion, the beard was almost
</p>
<p>unknown in the United States, and the prominence of these features obscured
</p>
<p>the observation of the by-standers to the distinctive individual traits. One or
</p>
<p>more of the witnesses testified that the man who did the shooting wore a pecu-
</p>
<p>liar dressing-gown. It was brought into court and identified. It was then put
</p>
<p>on Raymond, and was twice too large. It was then put on Gonzalve, and fit
</p>
<p>exactly. The case was plain enough ; but one man, named McPhetridge, a
</p>
<p>carpenter by trade and a Native American in politics, hung the jury. The sec-
</p>
<p>ond trial was held in the east front of the court-house, second floor. It was
</p>
<p>but a repetition of the first, and resulted likewise in a hung jury. The prison-
</p>
<p>ers were never acquitted by court or jury.
</p>
<p>" This was almost the last criminal trial conducted by either Geyer or Bates.
</p>
<p>"It was the last one generally attended by the elite of our female society.
</p>
<p>Nothing could exceed the interest they took in it. Besides the bloody tragedy
</p>
<p>on one side, and the poetic and touching misfortunes of the defendants, es-
</p>
<p>pecially Raymond, on the other side, it was so aristocratic to side with a hand-
</p>
<p>some young 7-eal French count, when set upon by Native American mechanics
</p>
<p>and German acht-nnd-vic7-ziger  forty-eighters.
</p>
<p>''A French count in those primitive days attracted much more attention and
</p>
<p>admiration than a king would now.
</p>
<p>"At that time the Creole element was still a very prominent, and perhaps even
</p>
<p>a preponderating, portion of our people. Always gentle, pure, and affectionate,
</p>
<p>devoted to their own 'Z Belle France'' and all its glorious histories and
</p>
<p>memories, they were, of course, deeply moved to see two of its illustrious
</p>
<p>noblemen charged with crime which was due to the visitation of God alone.
</p>
<p>Many of them, especially Mr. Charles P. Chouteau and his family, showed
</p>
<p>them devoted attention from first to last.
</p>
<p>" Their pardon by the governor was anomalous, and although I may have to
</p>
<p>act somewhat as my own trumpeter, it may not be uninteresting to relate the
</p>
<p>manner in which it was obtained.

<p>their pleasant recollections of him.
</p>
<p>William y. Slack
</p>
<p>Was a lawyer of some prominence when we first met him in
</p>
<p>the General Assembly of 1846-7. From the reputation he
</p>
<p>brought much was expected of him, and he soon evinced a
</p>
<p>readiness in debate, and during the entire session participated
</p>
<p>largely in the discussions. His style of speaking was by no
</p>
<p>means oratorical, for he never indulged in flights of fancy,
</p>
<p>nor was he very graceful in his manner. Earnestness, sincer-
</p>
<p>ity, and vigor, with a faculty of presenting facts in a strong
</p>
<p>light, were his chief characteristics as a debater. Being
</p>
<p>a very laborious man, he rendered efficient service on the
</p>
<p>committees  in fact, he was very attentive to all his legisla-
</p>
<p>tive duties; always on hand at the call of the roll, and never
</p>
<p>absent unless confined to his room by indisposition. He
</p>
<p>commanded the respect of all the members, and when ad-
</p>
<p>dressing the House was listened to very attentively. There
</p>
<p>was nothing particularly attractive about him, but his seem-
</p>
<p>ing candor and sincerity always enabled him to command
</p>
<p>the respect of his brother members.
</p>
<p>General Slack was a Kentuckian by birth, born in Mason
</p>
<p>County, on August i, 18 16. His parents moved to Missouri
</p>
<p>at an early day, and settled in Boone Count)', where the
</p>
<p>subject of our sketch received as good an English education
</p>
<p>as the schools of that day could afford, there being no state
</p>
<p>educational institution. The want of one was greatly felt,
</p>
<p>and it is said that General Slack took a very active part in es-
</p>
<p>tablishing the present University at Columbia. He pursued
</p>
<p>his studies with J. B. Gordon, an eminent lawyer of Boone,
</p>
<p>and upon being admitted to the bar, in 1837, located in
</p>
<p>Chillicothe, Livingston County, which continued to be his
</p>
<p>residence until his death. He manifested an inclination for
</p>
<p>military life at an early time, and in 1846 raised a company

</p>
<p>of volunteers for the Mexican War, became a captain, and
</p>
<p>13^ BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>joined the volunteer regiment of Colonel Sterling Price, and
</p>
<p>was with his regiment during its entire service.
</p>
<p>In 1848 he became a member of the State Convention
</p>
<p>called to revise the Constitution. During the time he served
</p>
<p>in the Legislature the subject of slavery had not become one
</p>
<p>of debate, for there was a great unanimity in opposition to the
</p>
<p>Wilmot Proviso, but Mr. Slack was understood to be a strong
</p>
<p>pro-slavery man in his views, and upon the breaking out of
</p>
<p>the Civil War earnestly espoused the cause of the South, and
</p>
<p>received from Governor Jackson a commission as brigadier-
</p>
<p>general in the state militia, and immediately entered upon
</p>
<p>active service, participating in the battle of Wilson Creek,
</p>
<p>where he was severely wounded. In the battle of Pea Ridge,
</p>
<p>which soon followed, he was mortally wounded, and died
</p>
<p>March 20, 1862, near the forty-sixth year of his age. He
</p>
<p>was a brave man, and in both battles sought the post of
</p>
<p>danger.
</p>
<p>General Slack was regarded as the leading lawyer at the
</p>
<p>Livingston bar; always commanded a good practice, and was
</p>
<p>generally successful. He was very laborious in the prepara-
</p>
<p>tion of his cases, and seldom went into trial unprepared.
</p>
<p>The qualities already referred to, in addition to the public
</p>
<p>confidence which he always inspired, gave him unusual
</p>
<p>weight with a jury.
</p>
<p>He was, also, a man of will, energy, and determination,
</p>
<p>and under strong opposition rose with the occasion, and ap-
</p>
<p>peared to greater advantage. As a soldier he was true,
</p>
<p>faithful, and brave, and though, in our judgment, under a
</p>
<p>mistaken apprehension as to his duty to his country, was

</p>
<p>nevertheless sincere and earnest.
</p>
<p>Charles Lucas,
</p>
<p>Son of Judge John B. C. Lucas, was born near Pittsburg,
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, September 25, 1792, and removed with his
</p>
<p>father to St. Louis in 1805, but was sent to Jefferson College,
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, to receive his education, where he remained
</p>
<p>five years, and in 181 1 returned to St. Louis and commenced
</p>
<p>the study of the law in the office of Colonel Rufus Easton.
</p>
<p>At the commencement of the war in 18 12 he joined a vol-
</p>
<p>unteer company in St. Louis, and afterwards organized with
</p>
<p>others a company of artillery, which was stationed near Port-
</p>
<p>age des Seoux. His brother Robert was captain of the com-
</p>
<p>pany, and upon his resignation Charles was commissioned to
</p>
<p>fill the vacancy. Li 18 14 he was admitted to the bar, and in
</p>
<p>the same year became a member of the Territorial Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, and was afterwards appointed United States attorney
</p>
<p>for the territory.
</p>
<p>On September 17, 18 17, he was killed by Colonel Benton
</p>
<p>in a duel on Bloody Island, opposite St. Louis, the particulars
</p>
<p>of which are given in the sketch of Colonel Benton's life.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lucas could not have been over twenty-five years of
</p>
<p>age when this unfortunate event occurred, and, therefore, was
</p>
<p>not old enough to have established' a high reputation at the
</p>
<p>bar; but from all we can learn he was regarded as a promis-
</p>
<p>ing young lawyer, and inherited much of the legal ability of
</p>
<p>his father.
</p>
<p>It has frequently been asserted that upon the occasion of
</p>
<p>his duel with Colonel Benton he was seized on the ground
</p>
<p>with fear and trepidation, but this is not sustained by those
</p>
<p>who were present. On the contrary, there is ample evidence
</p>
<p>that he acted with much coolness and deliberation. That
</p>
<p>he knew that Colonel Benton was the better shot, and that

<p>in all probability the meeting would prove fatal to him, is
</p>
<p>14"^ BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>clearly evidenced by the following letter, written the day
</p>
<p>before their first meeting, and which, after his death, was
</p>
<p>found among his papers:
</p>
<p>"St. Louis, August jj, iSij.
</p>
<p>"Dear Father: Embarked as I am in a hazardous enterprise, the issue of
</p>
<p>which you will know before you see this, I am under the necessity of bidding
</p>
<p>you, my brothers, sister, friends, adieu. May my brothers and sister pro-
</p>
<p>cure to you that consolation which I cannot. * * * I request my brothers
</p>
<p>William and James to pursue their studies with assiduity, preserving peace and
</p>
<p>good-will willi all good men. Father, sister, brothers, and friends  farewell.
</p>
<p>[Signed] "Charles Lucas."
</p>
<p>This meeting, however, resulted simply in the wounding
</p>
<p>of both, and Mr. Lucas became so weak from the loss of
</p>
<p>blood that it became necessary to postpone the fight to an-
</p>
<p>other day; andthey again met on September 27th following,
</p>
<p>when Mr. Lucas fell at the first shot, and died within an hour.
</p>
<p>After he fell, Colonel Benton approached him and expressed
</p>
<p>his regret at what had occurred, when Mr. Lucas extended
</p>
<p>to him his hand, saying, " I forgive you  I forgive yoti."
</p>
<p>The correspondence between them, and the particulars of the
</p>
<p>meeting, will be seen more at large in the sketch of Mr. Ben-
</p>
<p>ton's life.
</p>
<p>The death of Mr. Lucas was a serious loss to the profes-
</p>
<p>sion, not only on account of his exalted character, but be-
</p>
<p>cause he was rapidly rising as a lawyer.

<p>Five of his brothers met death by violence.
</p>
<p>Andrew S. Hughes.
</p>
<p>Clay County, Missouri, has always been noted for the
</p>
<p>ability of its bar, among whom still living are those distin-
</p>
<p>guished jurists. General A. W. Doniphan and Hon. George
</p>
<p>W. Dunn, and among the pioneers were John Thornton and
</p>
<p>Andrew S. Hughes.
</p>
<p>Of the life of Mr. Thornton we have already given a brief
</p>
<p>sketch, and will now endeavor to preserve some recollection
</p>
<p>of the latter, who was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky,
</p>
<p>on February 9, 1792. His father, David Hughes, was a gal-
</p>
<p>lant soldier of the Revolution, and emigrated from Virginia
</p>
<p>to Kentuck)' in 17S5, where the subject of this sketch
</p>
<p>received an academic education, and studied law in the office
</p>
<p>of his brother, James Hughes, and was admitted to the bar
</p>
<p>by the Supreme Court of Kentucky in 18 16. Mr. Hughes
</p>
<p>practiced law in his native state for eight or nine years^ and
</p>
<p>then removed to Clay County, in this state, where he con-
</p>
<p>tinued the practice till his death, in 1843. One of his sons,
</p>
<p>the Hon. Bela M. Hughes, is one of the most distinguished
</p>
<p>citizens of Colorado, and at the last election in that state was
</p>
<p>the Democratic candidate for governor. We served with him
</p>
<p>in the Legislature of Missouri.
</p>
<p>Andrew S. Hughes was a sound lawyer, and enjoyed a
</p>
<p>fine practice in north-west Missouri. He was, moreover, a
</p>
<p>man of fine literary tastes, and in English literature very few
</p>
<p>excelled him. Before leaving Kentucky he served in the
</p>
<p>Senate of that state, but after settling in Missouri, showed
</p>
<p>no inclination for public life  in fact, ignored politics alto-
</p>
<p>gether, and devoted himself to his profession, in which he
</p>
<p>was very successful. As a jury lawyer few excelled him, for
</p>
<p>he was noted for his keenness, wit, and great power of sar-
</p>
<p>casm. In his intercourse with others he was social, urbane,

</p>
<p>unbending integrity. There are some still living in Clay

<p>great force of character.

<p>make.
</p>
<p>Henry S. Geyer.
</p>
<p>The subject of this sketch, who was of German extrac-
</p>
<p>tion, his father having been a subject of Prussia, was born in
</p>
<p>Frederick County, Maryland, in 1798, and received an ordi-
</p>
<p>nary Enghsh education. His legal studies were pursued
</p>
<p>chiefly in the office of his maternal uncle, Daniel Sheaffee,
</p>
<p>who was a lawyer of considerable repute.
</p>
<p>Mr. Geyer volunteered in the War of 181 2, and reached
</p>
<p>the grade of pay-master, and was stationed for some time at
</p>
<p>Norfolk, Virginia.
</p>
<p>After the close of the war he removed to St. Louis, still
</p>
<p>holding the office of pay-master, at the same time pursuing
</p>
<p>the study of the law. At the end of the 5'ear he resigned,
</p>
<p>and entered upon the practice of his profession. About this
</p>
<p>time he was chosen captain of the first military company
</p>
<p>organized west of the Mississippi River; hence his title of
</p>
<p>captain, by which he was always afterwards known. Not
</p>
<p>long after this he became involved in a personal controversy
</p>
<p>with Captain George Kennerby, a most worthy gentleman,
</p>
<p>and who in after-life became one of our warmest friends.
</p>
<p>There is no living person who can give a reliable account
</p>
<p>of the origin of the difficulty, but it seems Captain Geyer
</p>
<p>considered himself affronted, and challenged Captain Ken-
</p>
<p>nerby, who without hesitation accepted it, and they met at
</p>
<p>Bloody Island, and, with pistols, at ten paces exchanged
</p>
<p>shots. Kennerby was wounded in the leg, and so severely as
</p>
<p>to be unable to stand, and therefore the parties separated to .
</p>
<p>renew the fight at another time ; but by the interposition of
</p>
<p>mutual friends the difficulty was honorably and amicably
</p>
<p>settled, and they continued friends through life.
</p>
<p>Captain Geyer was a prominent member of the Convention
</p>
<p>called to frame our State Constitution, and served two ses-

</p>
<p>sions in our State Legislature, during the last of which he was
</p>
<p>144 BENCH AND BAR OF M/SSOirAV.
</p>
<p>speaker. No man ever sat in our General Assembly who
</p>
<p>rendered more efficient service to the state than Captain
</p>
<p>Geyer, for there is scarcely an important law upon our
</p>
<p>statute-book which does not bear the impress of his labor and
</p>
<p>genius. Instead of spending his time in political discus-
</p>
<p>sions and party wranglings, he was constantly employed in
</p>
<p>amending and improving our laws, repealing such as had
</p>
<p>been found injurious, and adding to others such provisions
</p>
<p>as experience had shown necessary. Particularly did he
</p>
<p>give his attention to the Code of Practice as found in the
</p>
<p>revision of 1835. His handiwork can be traced to almost
</p>
<p>every page of the Practice Act under that revision; and if
</p>
<p>we live a thousand years we shall not have a better one.
</p>
<p>Pleading was then a science, founded upon the wisdom and
</p>
<p>experience of centuries ; but it was in the way of the legal
</p>
<p>quacks, and to-day we live under a s}'stem that is next to
</p>
<p>a farce, for half of the time of the courts is spent in a vain
</p>
<p>endeavor to ascertain what issues are to be tried  what is
</p>
<p>the real matter in controversy  and, at last, we go into trial
</p>
<p>blindfolded, feeling our way like the pilot of a vessel in a
</p>
<p>dense fog, and it is only when we approach the end of a
</p>
<p>trial that the court and jury begin to discover the real mat-
</p>
<p>ters in dispute. In 1825 he published the best digest of our
</p>
<p>laws we have ever had.
</p>
<p>Captain Geyer was retained in nearly all of the important
</p>
<p>land suits growing out of Spanish grants. New Madrid loca-
</p>
<p>tion, etc., and in the Supreme Court of the United States
</p>
<p>came in contact with the brightest lights of the profession,
</p>
<p>such as Webster, Ewing, Reverdy Johnson, and others; and
</p>
<p>it is no disparagement to them to say that, in the class of
</p>
<p>cases referred to, he was a match for any of them.
</p>
<p>In the Dred Scott case, which excited so much interest
</p>
<p>throughout the country, he made a masterly argument, and
</p>
<p>succeeded in eliciting a decision adverse to the preconceived

</p>
<p>opinions of the profession.
</p>
<p>But the case in which Captain Geyer gained his greatest
</p>
<p>reputation was that of The State vs. Darnes, which was tried
</p>
<p>in the Criminal Court of St. Louis in 1 840. Darnes was
</p>
<p>HENRY S. GEYKR. 1 45
</p>
<p>indicted for manslaughter for the kilHng of Davis, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Geyer appeared for the defense. Davis was the pubhsher
</p>
<p>of a Democratic newspaper called Tlie Argus, printed in St.
</p>
<p>Louis, and Colonel William Gilpin was the editor. An arti-
</p>
<p>cle appeared in the paper denouncing a certain class of
</p>
<p>politicians, and Mr. Darnes assumed that it applied to him,
</p>
<p>and addressed a note to Mr. Davis asking for an explanation.
</p>
<p>Davis refused to give it, and the next morning Colonel Gil-
</p>
<p>pin announced himself as the author, and proclaimed his
</p>
<p>readiness to give satisfaction to any person who felt himself
</p>
<p>aggrieved. Gilpin was well known to be a fighting man, while
</p>
<p>Davis, who had nothing to do with the editorial department
</p>
<p>of the paper, was a small, inoffensive man, who never
</p>
<p>engaged in broils or difficulties with any one. Darnes, who
</p>
<p>was a large, stout man, instead of meeting Gilpin, waylaid
</p>
<p>Davis and struck him several severe blows with an iron cane,
</p>
<p>the butt end of which was lead covered with leather. The
</p>
<p>first blow was struck with the small end, and the others with
</p>
<p>the butt end, resulting in some fractures of the skull. It
</p>
<p>occurred near the old National Hotel, on Third and Market
</p>
<p>Streets. Davis was immediately taken to the hospital, and
</p>
<p>died on the eighth day. On the day of the difficulty Dr.
</p>
<p>Beaumont, a skillful surgeon, in presence of other surgeons,
</p>
<p>performed the operation known as trephining.
</p>
<p>For the benefit of such of our readers as may not under-
</p>
<p>stand the nature of that operation, we would state that the
</p>
<p>trephine is a circular or cylindrical saw with a handle like
</p>
<p>that of a gimlet, and a little, sharp perforator, called the
</p>
<p>center-pin, and is used in fractures of the skull causing com-
</p>
<p>pression of the brain. The skull-bone is raised so as to re-
</p>
<p>lieve the compression. It is a dangerous operation, requir-
</p>
<p>ing great skill, and only resorted to in extreme cases. It
</p>
<p>was contended by Mr. Geyer that the death of Davis re-
</p>
<p>sulted from this operation, and not from the injury inflicted

<p>by Darnes.
</p>
<p>The most eminent surgeons and physicians of St. Louis
</p>
<p>were called upon to testif)' as to the nature and effects of the
</p>
<p>operation, and it was agreed between counsel that the writ-
</p>
<p>lO
</p>
<p>146 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>ings of Sir Astley Cooper and other eminent surgeons on
</p>
<p>that subject should be received as evidence in the cause.
</p>
<p>This opened a very wide field of inquiry, and Mr. Geyer
</p>
<p>spent two days in the delivery of one of the most profound
</p>
<p>arguments ever heard in a court of justice. It was published
</p>
<p>in pamphlet form, and republished in Boston, and to this
</p>
<p>day is referred to as authority b}- the New England bar in
</p>
<p>all analogous cases. It gave him at once a national reputa-
</p>
<p>tion as a lawyer and jurist.
</p>
<p>To give the reader some idea of his style of declamation,
</p>
<p>and the power of language which was always at his com-
</p>
<p>mand, we give an extract from that portion of his speech in
</p>
<p>which he referred to the licentiousness of the press :
</p>
<p>" There are other considerations which will account for the unusual throng,
</p>
<p>the deep concern in the issue, manifested here and elsewliere. It is, indeed, a
</p>
<p>trial of extraordinary importance, involving the most momentous questions, far
</p>
<p>exceeding in importance the mere conviction or acquittal of Darnes  questions
</p>
<p>aifecting the best interests of society, in which you, and I, and every member
</p>
<p>of this community, present or absent, are as deeply concerned as the accused.
</p>
<p>You are now called upon to decide whether the people of this country are to
</p>
<p>be exposed to the arbitrary tyranny of the press  the defenseless victims of
</p>
<p>its relentless cruelty ; whether it is to be cherished and encouraged in its li-
</p>
<p>centiousness, by denying to its victims all adequate redress, and punishing
</p>
<p>them as felons if they attempt to redress themselves and by accident or mis-
</p>
<p>fortune exceed the just measure of retribution; whether we shall foster and
</p>

</p>
<p>The prosecution brought into court a part of the skull of
</p>
<p>the deceased, for the purpose of letting the jury see the
</p>
<p>effect of the blows, and to better enable the surgeons who
</p>
<p>were witnesses in the case to explain the method of trephin-

<p>HENRY S. GEYER. 1 47
</p>
<p>celebrated case of John C. Colt, who was convicted, in 1842,
</p>
<p>of the murder of Samuel Adams, committed in the city of
</p>
<p>New York in September, 1841.
</p>
<p>Apprehensive that it might tend to prejudice the jury,
</p>
<p>Captain Geyer attempted to evade its effect by the following
</p>
<p>ingenious appeal. Said he :
</p>
<p>" I now approach a subject which I would gladly have avoided. It is one,
</p>
<p>however, which we did not introduce  it was pressed upon us against our
</p>
<p>wishes ; but, since our adversaries will have it in the case, I will not shrink from
</p>
<p>it, unpleasant as it is. Still, I enter upon it with reluctance, because, in speak-
</p>
<p>ing to the testimony, I may be compelled to deal harshly in relation to profes-
</p>
<p>sional acts of gentlemen toward whom I entertain no unkind feelings, and with
</p>
<p>whom, personally, I maintain friendly relations. But I am coerced into the
</p>
<p>examination by the extraordinary exhibition gotten up on this trial ; and for
</p>
<p>the consequences our adversaries, and not we, are responsible.
</p>
<p>" It seemed to me evident from the beginning, as well from what I saw as
</p>
<p>what I had heard, that some extraordinary appliances were to be resorted
</p>
<p>to, and that the gentlemen had determined upon a scene. The skull was pre-
</p>
<p>pared for the occasion, not for the purpose of scientific illustration, or the
</p>
<p>elucidation of any surgical question, but for show. It was exhibited, not as
</p>
<p>evidence, but for theatrical effect; and as soon as it had subserved its pur-
</p>
<p>pose it disappeared. Nor was it all brought  only so much of it as suited
</p>
<p>their purpose was exhibited. We had not even an opportunity allowed us to
</p>
<p>test the skill of the operators by an examination of the fragment ; even that
</p>
<p>vanished as soon as the show was over. [Mr. Engle tlien said, "It was deposited
</p>
<p>with the clerk."] It is on file, is it ? There let it remain ; nobody could expect
</p>
<p>to find it there  certainly I did not. It is well hidden where it is. I don't
</p>
<p>desire now to repeat the revolting exhibition."
</p>
<p>It is only necessary to state that the prisoner was con-
</p>
<p>victed of manslaughter in the third or fourth degree, amount-
</p>
<p>ing virtually to an acquittal. During the trial the most
</p>
<p>intense excitement prevailed throughout the city, and the
</p>
<p>court-room was densely packed from morning till night.
</p>
<p>The prosecution was conducted by Mr. Engle, the circuit

<p>attorney, and Hon. Thomas T. Gantt, late judge of our
</p>
<p>Court of Appeals ; and in the defense Captain Geyer was
</p>
<p>assisted by Beverly Allen, Esq., and Joseph B. Crockett,
</p>
<p>the latter being one of the present judges of the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court of California. This array of eminertt counsel
</p>
<p>added greatly to the interest of the case, and we regret that
</p>
<p>148 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>the scope of this work will not permit us to give a few
</p>
<p>extracts from the able speech of Judge Gantt.
</p>
<p>Captain Geyer was a bold, logical, fluent, and argumenta-
</p>
<p>tive speaker, never indulging in mere flights of rhetoric or
</p>
<p>oratory; but was without an equal in sarcasm, invective,
</p>
<p>irony, and ridicule, and when he had occasion to use them,
</p>
<p>was terrific. We do not claim that he was a finished orator,
</p>
<p>but one of the chief standards of oratory, the power to
</p>
<p>convince and sway the minds of his hearers, he certainly
</p>
<p>possessed in an eminent degree.
</p>
<p>If called upon to decide who, in our judgment, was the
</p>
<p>greatest lawyer at the Missouri bar, we should unhesitatingly
</p>
<p>say Henry S. Geyer ; not that he was the superior of Gam-
</p>
<p>ble, Leonard, or Field, in his knowledge of the law relating
</p>
<p>to real estate ; not that he was the equal of Josiah Spalding
</p>
<p>as a commercial lawyer; nor the equal of Edward Bates in
</p>
<p>impassioned eloquence; yet, taking everything into consid-
</p>
<p>eration, he was the superior of all.
</p>
<p>He mingled but little with the people, and was generally
</p>
<p>regarded as a cold, selfish, reserved, and austere man, which
</p>
<p>no doubt was in many respects true ; for no one  not even
</p>
<p>those who were allied to him by blood  could claim to be
</p>
<p>oi: terms of intimacy with him. He never manifested any
</p>
<p>feeling or fondness for any of his associates, and, outside of
</p>
<p>his (Hvn family, never reposed in any one that confidence
</p>
<p>A\ hich is indispensable to pure friendship. Notwithstanding
</p>
<p>this, he exhibited a relish for fun, humor, and anecdote, and
</p>
<p>not onl}' enjoyed a good joke himself, but was the author of
</p>
<p>many on others.
</p>
<p>He told a very good one on Governor Polk. He and Mr.
</p>
<p>Polk were attending court in one of the adjoining circuits,
</p>
<p>and one morning several prisoners were brought into court
</p>
<p>to receive sentence, and among them one who had been con-
</p>
<p>victed of murder in the first degree. An old lady came into

</p>
<p>the court- room, and seeing Captain Geyer sitting near the
</p>
<p>counsel-table, and supposing him to be a lawyer, requested
</p>
<p>him to point out the murderer. Mr. Polk was standing, at
</p>
<p>HENRY S. GEYER. 1 49
</p>
<p>the time, near the prisoners' dock, and Captain Geyer pointed
</p>
<p>to him. The old lady took a good look at him through her
</p>
<p>spectacles, and ejaculated, " The wretch ! What a horrible
</p>
<p>countenance ! The mark of Cain is upon his face."
</p>
<p>Upon another occasion, while attending court in Franklin
</p>
<p>County, the judge directed the sheriff, ^\ho had been lately
</p>
<p>appointed and knew but few of the lawyers, to call at the
</p>
<p>door Mason Frizell. The sheriff not hearing the name
</p>
<p>very distinctly, made inquiry of Captain Geyer, whom he
</p>
<p>supposed to be a lawyer, and received for reply, " Mason
</p>
<p>Freeze-hell." Three times did the sheriff call the name at
</p>
<p>the top of his voice, placing the accent upon the word " h  1."
</p>
<p>The court and audience were convulsed with laughter, and
</p>
<p>in the midst of it in stepped Mr. Frizell, greatly excited, and
</p>
<p>wanting to know why he was thus insulted. The sheriff,
</p>
<p>who had been made aware of his mistake, arose, and apolo-
</p>
<p>gized by stating that, being a little deaf, he did not catch the
</p>
<p>name as given b}' the court, and made inquiry of a gentle-
</p>
<p>man near him, and whom he supposed was an attorney, but
</p>
<p>who (taking a good look over the court-room) was not then
</p>
<p>present. Captain Geyer, seeing Mr. Frizell enter one door,
</p>
<p>quietly walked out of the other, and went to the hotel.
</p>
<p>In his long experience at the bar he sometimes became
</p>
<p>involved in personal difficulties, occasionally with counsel,
</p>
<p>and not unfrequently with parties litigant; but he had an
</p>
<p>adroit way of extricating himself.
</p>
<p>Upon one occasion he was defending a suit brought by
</p>
<p>one John Withington, a farmer in good circumstances, but
</p>
<p>afflicted with an inordinate love of litigation. He was nat-
</p>
<p>urally a good-hearted man, but took great delight in attend-
</p>
<p>ing the sessions of the court, and, to avoid the charge of
</p>
<p>loafing about the temple of justice, always contrived to
</p>
<p>have two or three cases of his own on the docket ; but if he
</p>
<p>ever met with success in one, it had escaped the recollec-

</p>
<p>tion of the oldest inhabitant of the county.
</p>
<p>Captain Geyer knew him well, for at least on one occasion
</p>
<p>he had been his counsel. In the case of which we are speak-
</p>
<p>ing, Withington received from the captain a terrible tongue-
</p>
<p>150 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>lashing, which he determined to resent; and, meeting liim
</p>
<p>after court, approached him with a raised cane and de-
</p>
<p>manded a complete retraction. " Withing on," said Captain
</p>
<p>Geyer, " what do you mean ? I have not said a word against
</p>
<p>you.". "Did you not," said Withington, "tell the jury that
</p>
<p>I was a pest to society; that I spent half of my days in cre-
</p>
<p>ating trouble among neighbors ; that I was a promoter of
</p>
<p>broils and dissensions ; and that I was an imp of the devil,
</p>
<p>and a most faithful servant of his satanic majesty? Did you
</p>
<p>not say all this, and much more?" "Why," said Geyer,
</p>
<p>"Jack, }'ou are a fool. Is it possible that after your long
</p>
<p>experience in the courts you have never yet learned that
</p>
<p>what falls from the lips of a lawyer in court his client is re-
</p>
<p>sponsible for  that it is his client speaking through him?"
</p>
<p>" Well," said Jack, " I had not thought of that, Captain, and
</p>
<p>I w^ill go and hunt up Smith and settle it with him."
</p>
<p>Jeafferson, in his book about lawyers, an English work,
</p>
<p>gives a somewhat similar scene between Curran and a wit-
</p>
<p>ness whom Curran had abused most unmercifull}'. The
</p>
<p>witness called at his room the next morning, before he
</p>
<p>was up, and, waking the barrister, said : " I am the gen-
</p>
<p>tleman whom you insulted yesterday in his majesty's court
</p>
<p>of justice, in the presence of the whole county; and I am
</p>
<p>here to thrash you soundly." Thus speaking, the intruder
</p>
<p>waved a horsewhip over the lawyer. "You don't mean to
</p>
<p>strike a man when he is lying down?" said Curran. "No,
</p>
<p>bedad, I'll just wait till you have got out of bed, and then I'll
</p>
<p>give it to }'ou sharp and fast." Curran's eye twinkled mis-
</p>
<p>chievously, as he rejoined, "If that's the case, by G  d I'll
</p>
<p>lie here all day." So tickled was the visitor with this humor-
</p>
<p>ous announcement, that he dropped his horsewhip, and, dis-
</p>
<p>missing his anger with a hearty roar of laughter, asked the
</p>
<p>counselor to shake hands with him.
</p>
<p>To speak of all his resources upon the trial of a cause

</p>
<p>would lengthen this sketch beyond proper limits. We will,
</p>
<p>however, refer to a few. If trying a cause before a jury,
</p>
<p>unexpected or damaging evidence never disconcerted him
</p>
<p>for a moment ; nor could the jury discover from his counte-
</p>
<p>HENR Y S. GE YEK. 1 5 I
</p>
<p>nance any apprehension as to its effect. Mr. Polk and Uriel
</p>
<p>Wright possessed the same faculty, but in a less degree.
</p>
<p>Another faculty which he often employed to good effect was
</p>
<p>the power to evade the effect of evidence by turning it into
</p>
<p>ridicule. There is no weapon that a lawyer can employ more
</p>
<p>profitably than this ; but very few possess it. No lawyer in
</p>
<p>the United States ever had it to such an extent as the late
</p>
<p>Rufus Choate, of Boston.
</p>
<p>In Parker's reminiscences of him the following instance is
</p>
<p>given. Mr. Choate was prosecuting a case against a railroad
</p>
<p>company for killing a man who was attempting to drive across
</p>
<p>the track. The theory of the defense was that death resulted
</p>
<p>from the carelessness of the deceased, and not from any fault
</p>
<p>or negligence of the employees of the road. A witness tes-
</p>
<p>tified that the deceased was intoxicated at the time, which
</p>
<p>doubtless contributed to the accident. In his comments on
</p>
<p>this part of the evidence, Mr. Choate said :
</p>
<p>" This witness swears he stood by the dying man in his last moments. What
</p>
<p>was he there for? Was it to administer those assiduities which are ordinarily
</p>
<p>proffered at the bedside of dying men ? Was it to extend to him the consola-
</p>
<p>tions of that religion which for eighteen hundred years has comforted the world?
</p>
<p>No, gentlemen of the jury. He leans over the departing sufferer; he bends his
</p>
<p>face nearer and nearer to him  and what does he do ? [In a voice of thunder]
</p>
<p>What does he do ? Smells gin and brandy ! "
</p>
<p>To show the control of Choate over his countenance, Mr.
</p>
<p>Parker says that he was once engaged in a trial in the Fed-
</p>
<p>eral court, and in cross-examining a witness (a seaman) who
</p>
<p>had turned state's evidence, and had stolen money from the
</p>
<p>ship on the distant shore, the witness stated that Choate's
</p>
<p>client instigated the deed. "Well," said Choate, " what did
</p>
<p>he say ? " " Well," said the witness, " he told us there was
</p>
<p>a man in Boston, named Choate, who would get us off if they
</p>
<p>caught us zuit/i the money in our boots." This terrible thrust
</p>
<p>at the counsel produced an uproar of laughter, and although
</p>

</p>
<p>every eye was turned upon Choate, not the slightest effect
</p>
<p>upon his countenance was observed ; and he continued the
</p>
<p>-examination as though nothing of the kind had occurred.
</p>
<p>We do not pretend that Captain Geyer had this power to
</p>
<p>152 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>the same extent, but he had it, and it added greatly to his
</p>
<p>efficiency as an advocate.
</p>
<p>We shall have occasion to refer to other notable instances
</p>
<p>of this rare gift when we come to speak of the life and char-
</p>
<p>acter of Mr. Blannerhassett, formerly of the St. Louis bar,
</p>
<p>and who was esteemed one of the ablest criminal lawyers in
</p>
<p>the state.
</p>
<p>Captain Geyer had often expressed a desire to obtain a
</p>
<p>seat in the United States Senate, and when he finally suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded, in 1 85 I, his friends entertained a strong hope that he
</p>
<p>would make a fine reputation as a statesman; but in this
</p>
<p>they were greatly disappointed, for he fell far below public
</p>
<p>expectation. The fact is, he was a mere lawyer, and as
</p>
<p>much out of his place in the Senate as he would have been
</p>
<p>at the helm of a ship. It is a great mistake to suppose that
</p>
<p>a successful lawyer necessarily makes a successful statesman.
</p>
<p>Some of the qualities of mind essential in one often prove
</p>
<p>detrimental in the other. In Mr. Webster, Mr. Pinckney, Mr.
</p>
<p>Berrien, and a few others there was a happy combination
</p>
<p>which enabled them to e.xcel in both ; but, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>Mr. Choate, who had no superior as a lawyer, made an in-
</p>
<p>different statesman, while Stephen A. Douglas, who had few
</p>
<p>superiors as a statesman, never exhibited any superiority as
</p>
<p>a lawyer. In Marsh.ill's short career in the Senate he dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished himself only by an argument in the Jonathan
</p>
<p>Robbins case, which was emphatically the work of a jurist.
</p>
<p>Had Judges Kent and Story been placed in the Senate, the
</p>
<p>probability is that they would have proved eminent failures.
</p>
<p>The course of education required in each is essentially dif-
</p>
<p>ferent ; and to succeed in both, one must be educated in
</p>
<p>both.
</p>
<p>It is not strange, therefore, that Captain Geyer, who had
</p>
<p>obtained a national reputation as a lawyer, should have failed
</p>
<p>as a senator to meet the expectations of his political friends.

<p>He died in St. Louis, March 5, 1859, ^^ the age of sixty-
</p>
<p>one. He was married three times, and left a widow, one
</p>
<p>son, and two daughters.

<p>Austin A. King.
</p>
<p>Missouri has been fortunate in the selection of her chief
</p>
<p>magistrates ; for, with few exceptions, they were men of
</p>
<p>learning, ability, and integrity. Such was Austin A. King,
</p>
<p>who was born in Sulliv^an County, Tennessee, on September
</p>
<p>21, 1 80 1. He came from an old Revolutionary family, and
</p>
<p>inherited their patriotism and love of country. He received
</p>
<p>an ordinar}' English education, but after determining to fol-
</p>
<p>low the law as a profession, took private lessons in Latin and
</p>
<p>Greek, and became a fair Latin scholar. His father was a
</p>
<p>farmer, and Austin rendered him efficient aid in the cultiva-
</p>
<p>tion of his farm, and by so doing acquired habits of industry
</p>
<p>and labor which proved very serviceable to him in after-life.
</p>
<p>After reaching his majority he commenced the study of the
</p>
<p>law, which he pursued for several years with great diligence ;
</p>
<p>then removed to Columbia, Boone County, Missouri, and
</p>
<p>commenced the practice, having to contend with such men
</p>
<p>as Leonard, Todd, Gordon, Rollins, Clark, and Davis.
</p>
<p>He had not long been a resident of Boone before he was
</p>
<p>elected to represent that county in the Legislature  no
</p>
<p>small honor when we reflect that Boone was then, as now,
</p>
<p>one of the oldest and most intelligent counties in the state,
</p>
<p>and the abode of some of our ablest men. He took an act-
</p>
<p>ive part in the debates of the House  proved an energetic,
</p>
<p>hard-working member, and soon acquired a wide influence in
</p>
<p>his party.
</p>
<p>In 1837 he removed to Ray County, and was soon after
</p>
<p>appointed judge of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, which office
</p>
<p>he held until the people of the state, in 1848, elected him
</p>
<p>to the office of governor. It was during his administration
</p>
<p>that the railroad system of the state, which has contributed
</p>
<p>so largely to our population and wealth, was inaugurated.

<p>He was a strong advocate of internal improvements, and
</p>
<p>154 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>lent his aid and influence to all public enterprises which he
</p>
<p>deemed worthy and commendable, particular!)- where they
</p>
<p>tended to develop our mineral and agricultural resources.
</p>
<p>He was, however, cautious and prudent, and avoided as far
</p>
<p>as possible the incurring of any unnecessary debt.
</p>
<p>At the expiration of his term of office he returned to the
</p>
<p>practice in Ray County, where he had to encounter such
</p>
<p>able jurists as Doniphan, Dunn, and Hughes, and soon took
</p>
<p>rank with them at the bar, and attained a large and lucrative
</p>
<p>business.
</p>
<p>In i860 he was selected to represent his district in the
</p>
<p>National Democratic Convention, and in the published pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of that body he is frequently referred to as partici-
</p>
<p>pating in the debates. When the dark cloud of civil war
</p>
<p>rolled over the country he raised his voice in behalf of his
</p>
<p>government, and was very bitter in his denunciation of
</p>
<p>secession.
</p>
<p>In 1862 he was selected by the Union party to represent
</p>
<p>his district in Congress, and voted for a vigorous prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion of the war, and for all measures necessary to put down
</p>
<p>the Rebellion. This closed his public life, and he died while
</p>
<p>on a visit to St. Louis, in April, 1870, in his sixty-ninth year.
</p>
<p>Governor King was a man of vigorous intellect, and ren-
</p>
<p>dered a faithful discharge of duty in every position to which
</p>
<p>he was called. In no sense was he brilliant, yet few surpassed
</p>
<p>him in forensic debate. He took that common-sense, prac-
</p>
<p>tical view of all public questions which gives strength to a
</p>
<p>speaker, and makes him formidable before a popular assem-
</p>
<p>blage. He was thoroughly posted in the political history
</p>
<p>of the government, and when he encountered in debate one
</p>
<p>who was not, he scarcely ever failed to win a signal victory.
</p>
<p>Though opposed by one of the most popular and gifted men
</p>
<p>of the state, his majority for governor was larger than that
</p>
<p>of any of his predecessors, showing the great confidence re-

<p>have obtained distinction ; for, though fluent and logical, he
</p>

<p>graces of gesture which are so effective in many of our pub-

</p>
<p>lie speakers. He was an eminently practical man, with great
</p>
<p>energy and endurance, which enabled him to overcome ob-
</p>
<p>stacles that to many would seem insurmountable. He was,
</p>
<p>moreover, a man of fine habits, and free from those vices
</p>
<p>which so frequently beset our public men.
</p>
<p>As a judge he was learned, patient, and impartial, and
</p>
<p>gave universal satisfaction to the bar; and with the younger
</p>
<p>members was a great favorite, for he was kind and indulgent
</p>
<p>to them, and, when it was in his power, would aid and assist
</p>
<p>them. In his private relations he was social and domestic,
</p>
<p>and a truly practical Christian. We met him on several
</p>
<p>occasions, transacted business with him when governor of
</p>
<p>the state, and always found him a practical, high-toned gen-
</p>
<p>tleman.

<p>filled positions of honor and trust.
</p>
<p>Jacob T. Tindall.
</p>
<p>Upon the bloody field of Shiloh fell many a patriot who
</p>
<p>died that his country might live. Such was Colonel Jacob
</p>
<p>Toriam Tindall, of Grundy County, Missouri, one of God's
</p>
<p>noblemen, and in the Grand River country universally
</p>
<p>esteemed for the kindness of his heart and the brightness
</p>
<p>of his intellect.
</p>
<p>Colonel Tindall was a native of Kentucky, born on April
</p>
<p>25, 1826, and with his parents removed to Howard County,
</p>
<p>Missouri, where the subject of our sketch was chiefly
</p>
<p>raised. When Jacob was only seventeen or eighteen }-ears
</p>
<p>of age, his father settled upon a farm near Trenton, Grundy
</p>
<p>Count\% and the only education received by the son was in
</p>
<p>the common schools of that day ; but his fondness for books
</p>
<p>enabled him to some extent to overcome the want of a col-
</p>
<p>legiate course. At intervals for two or three }xars he
</p>
<p>taught school, and when quite young developed a taste for
</p>
<p>fishing and hunting. It was his delight to stroll through the
</p>
<p>woods with his dog and gun, and the want of success never
</p>
<p>deterred him from its repetition. So devoted was he to this
</p>
<p>favorite source of amusement that his friends became appre-
</p>
<p>hensive that he never would apply himself to any profes-
</p>
<p>sional pursuit, or business of any kind ; but those ram-
</p>
<p>bles through the forest tended to enlarge his imagination,
</p>
<p>and give greater scope to his fancy. Many a speech did
</p>
<p>Patrick Henry make in the solitude of the forest, and it is not
</p>
<p>improbable that Mr. Tindall may have there acquired some
</p>
<p>of the graces of oratory which so distinguished him in after-
</p>
<p>life. As he grew up he developed a manhood that was com-
</p>
<p>manding and striking ; for he was fully six feet high, straight,
</p>
<p>as an Indian, with dark complexion and dark and piercing
</p>
<p>eyes  in fact, the whole contour of his face was so marked

<p>that a stranger could scarcely fail to notice him.
</p>
<p>JACOB T. TIN D ALL. I 57
</p>
<p>After pursuing the study of the law for about the usual
</p>
<p>period he was admitted to the bar, and in a short time took
</p>
<p>rank among the ablest lawyers of his portion of the state.
</p>
<p>There was no better logician in the Grand River countr)-, and
</p>
<p>his commanding figure, clear and distinct enunciation, and
</p>
<p>eas\', graceful gesture stamped him as an orator of no ordinary
</p>
<p>pretensions. He indulged largely in anecdote, and had a
</p>
<p>keen appreciation of the ludicrous, which he often employed
</p>
<p>to great advantage. Some thought that he impaired the force
</p>
<p>of his argument by too great indulgence in anecdote, but his
</p>
<p>happy application often gave them the force of argument,
</p>
<p>particularly when attempting to illustrate the weakness of
</p>
<p>his adversary's position. In cutting satire and bold invec-
</p>
<p>tive he had no superior at the bar. As a jur}' law}'er he was
</p>
<p>very successful. His methodical mind enabled him to grasp
</p>
<p>and present to the jury the facts of the case in the most
</p>
<p>impressive form, and his rapid enunciation gave him the
</p>
<p>power to say a great deal in a short time, and thus avoid
</p>
<p>encroaching upon their patience.
</p>
<p>In his intercourse with others Colonel Tindall was social,
</p>
<p>genial, and entertaining  in fact he was the life of any com-
</p>
<p>pany in which he was thrown ; and here his fine conversa-
</p>
<p>tional powers appeared to great advantage, for no one knew
</p>
<p>better how" to adapt himself to the taste and character of his
</p>
<p>hearers. His fund of humor was inexhaustible.
</p>
<p>Colonel Tindall was a great lover of horses, and it was
</p>
<p>said that no one could cheat him in a horse-trade, for he was
</p>
<p>a shrewd observer of their points and traits, and scarcely
</p>
<p>ever failed in his judgment of them. He was very much
</p>
<p>attached to a horse he called " Sam," which he usually rode
</p>
<p>on the circuit. He took " Sam " with him into the army,
</p>
<p>rode him in the battle of Shiloh, and there fell from his back,
</p>
<p>pierced through the heart with a musket-ball. " Sam " was
</p>
<p>also severely wounded, but whether he survived the battle is

<p>not known.
</p>
<p>Soldiers frequently form very strong attachments for their
</p>
<p>war-horses. General Taylor took old " Whitey " to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, and no one about the White House was more petted

</p>
<p>or accorded kinder attention. The general would go to the
</p>
<p>stable daily to hold pleasant converse with his good old steed,
</p>
<p>and " Whitey " was as much impressed with his importance
</p>
<p>as any other atlacJiv of the president.
</p>
<p>Colonel Tindall manifested very early in life a desire to
</p>
<p>engage in military service, and before his admission to the
</p>
<p>bar volunteered in the Mexican War, and served in the bat-
</p>
<p>talion of Missouri volunteers commanded by Lieutenant-
</p>
<p>Colonel Gilpin, in which he held an important commission,
</p>
<p>and obtained the entire confidence of his commander.
</p>
<p>When barely of the constitutional age he was elected to
</p>
<p>the Legislature ; but as he served but a single session, he had
</p>
<p>no time to establish much reputation as a law-maker.
</p>
<p>Colonel Tindall had a large, comprehensive mind, and in
</p>
<p>the performance of his duty as a citizen knew neither North
</p>
<p>nor South, East nor West, but took in his entire country,
</p>
<p>regarding the Union as a solemn compact sealed with the
</p>
<p>blood of our fathers, and too sacred to be touched by sacri-
</p>
<p>legious hands. He was opposed to secession in every shape
</p>
<p>and form, as furnishing no remedy for wrongs real or imag-
</p>
<p>inary. It could not be said of him that he was influenced
</p>
<p>in this respect by any prejudice against the institution of
</p>
<p>slavery, for he was born and reared in a slave state, and
</p>
<p>never lived in any other. He undoubtedly felt that many
</p>
<p>wrongs had been perpetrated against the South by incendiary
</p>
<p>publications and fanatical speeches, but in his judgment the
</p>
<p>floor of Congress was the place to obtain redress, and not in
</p>
<p>the severance and overthrow of the government. He
</p>
<p>esteemed it the duty of every citizen to aid in maintaining
</p>
<p>the Federal authority at all hazards, and he was among the
</p>
<p>first to tender his services to his government by creating
</p>
<p>and organizing the Twenty-third Missouri Regiment. He
</p>
<p>commanded that regiment in the battle of Shiloh, sought
</p>
<p>the post of danger, and was shot down while leading his

<p>column in the thickest of the fieht.
</p>
<p>Colonel Tindall manifested his devotion to the Union at
</p>
<p>the commencement of the Rebellion, by taking a seat as a
</p>
<p>Union delegate in the Convention called to take into consid-

</p>
<p>eration our relations towards the Federal government. He
</p>
<p>seldom spoke in the Convention, but when he did, took the
</p>
<p>strongest possible ground against secession. His main work
</p>
<p>was on the Military Committee, of which he was chairman.
</p>
<p>He framed and reported the bill under which the state mili-
</p>
<p>tia were organized. It was during one of the recesses of
</p>
<p>the Convention that he organized the regiment which he
</p>
<p>commanded at Shiloh. He possessed in an eminent degree
</p>
<p>those traits of mind and character which pave the way to
</p>
<p>distinction, but his career was cut short in the morning of
</p>
<p>his life. His memory is fondly cherished by the people of
</p>
<p>the Grand River country.
</p>
<p>As before stated, he fell at the head of his regiment, in
</p>
<p>the battle of Shiloh, April 6, 1862, in his thirty-sixth year.
</p>
<p>When the news of his death reached the Constitutional Con-
</p>
<p>vention, of which he was a member, that body adopted a
</p>
<p>series of resolutions, among which were the following :
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That in the death of Colonel Tindall this Convention has lost a
</p>
<p>valued member, whose intellect and energy, patriotism, and conservative views
</p>
<p>rendered him an able and efficient member of this body. That by his untimely
</p>
<p>fate the nation has lost a devoted patriot in the hour of her peril ; the army, a
</p>
<p>prudent commander ; the society in which he moved, an ornament ; and his
</p>
<p>family, an affectionate husband and father.
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That in testimony of our appreciation of the deceased, and
</p>
<p>from due regard to his memory, this Convention will now adjourn until to-mor-
</p>
<p>row morning at nine o'clock, and that the members wear the usual badge of
</p>
<p>mourning during the present session."
</p>
<p>No one who knew Colonel Tindall in life can visit the spot
</p>
<p>where his remains repose without dropping a tear upon his
</p>
<p>grave.

<p>" Death loves a shining mark, a signal blow."
</p>
<p>Carty Wells.
</p>
<p>The name of this gentleman is very familiar to the pro-
</p>
<p>fession, for he was not only a prominent lawyer, but a leading
</p>
<p>politician, and for many years judge of the Lincoln Circuit.
</p>
<p>He was born in Prince William County, Virginia, February'
</p>
<p>8, 1805, and moved with his father to Shelby County, Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky, in the fall of 18 10, where the subject of our sketch
</p>
<p>resided until he reached his twenty-second }ear. He never
</p>
<p>entered any college, but obtained as good an education as
</p>
<p>the schools of that day could give. He applied himself
</p>
<p>closely to his books, and became a good English scholar.
</p>
<p>After stud\-ing law upwards of a year, in the office of Judge
</p>
<p>Venable, he came, in 1827, to Missouri, and continued his
</p>
<p>studies under the instruction of Judge Beverly Tucker, of
</p>
<p>St. Charles, a prominent lawyer.
</p>
<p>To avoid some of the difficulties which the laws of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri imposed upon an applicant for a law license, ^Tr. Wells
</p>
<p>went to Jacksonville, Illinois, in the fall of 1828, and was
</p>
<p>there licensed by the Supreme Court of that state, and, re-
</p>
<p>turning to Missouri with his license in his pocket, applied to
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court, then in session at Bowling Green, Pike
</p>
<p>County, and obtained a license to practice in 3kIissouri ; set-
</p>
<p>tled in St. Charles, and attended the courts of St. Charles,
</p>
<p>Lincoln, Pike, Ralls, and iSIarion. Upon the organization of
</p>
<p>Warren County, in 1833 or 1834, Mr. Wells was appointed
</p>
<p>clerk of the Circuit and County Courts of that county, which
</p>
<p>office he held several years ; but, being desirous of returning
</p>
<p>to the practice, resigned and moved to a farm near Troy,
</p>
<p>Lincoln County, and about 1840 or 1842 was elected a rep-
</p>
<p>resentative to the Legislature from that county, became a
</p>
<p>prominent member, and took an active part in all the dis-
</p>
<p>cussions. About 1843 he again changed his residence, and

<p>removed to Palmvra, then the largest town in north-east
</p>
<p>CARTY WELLS. l6l
</p>
<p>Missouri, and practiced there until about 1846 or 1847, when
</p>
<p>he was appointed circuit judge of the Lincoln Circuit, then
</p>
<p>embracing the counties of Lincoln, Pike, St. Charles, War-
</p>
<p>ren, Montgomery, and Ralls, and returned to his farm near
</p>
<p>Troy. While living in Palmyra he was elected from the
</p>
<p>Marion District to the State Senate, made a useful and in-
</p>
<p>fluential member, and either at the expiration of his term, or
</p>
<p>shortly thereafter, received the appointment of circuit judge.
</p>
<p>As a politician, Judge Wells was not altogether successful ;
</p>
<p>for at times he failed to work in the harness with that de-
</p>
<p>votion to his party which was exacted of all Democratic
</p>
<p>politicians. Indeed, he was regarded as vacillating and un-
</p>
<p>reliable ; for in those days the least departure from the faith
</p>
<p>consigned a man to his political grave.
</p>
<p>As a speaker. Judge Wells was fluent and argumentative,
</p>
<p>but never made any pretensions to oratory. He was well
</p>
<p>posted in the political history of the country, and generally
</p>
<p>commanded the close attention of his audience. He never
</p>
<p>aimed at applause, and seldom received it ; for he addressed
</p>
<p>himself to the understanding of his hearers, and endeavored
</p>
<p>to secure their confidence and good-will. In his intercourse
</p>
<p>with others he was genial and pleasant, and readily made
</p>
<p>friends  mixed freely with the people, and never assumed
</p>
<p>an air of superiority. We knew him well, but our relations
</p>
<p>were not intimate.
</p>
<p>He died in Troy, in January, i860, or 1861, at the age of
</p>
<p>about fifty-five.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wells displayed much ingenuity in the cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion of a witness, but on one occasion was completely floored
</p>
<p>by an old English doctor, who was a witness in a case brought
</p>
<p>to contest the validity of a will, upon the ground of incapacity
</p>
<p>in the testator.
</p>
<p>The witness testified that he had known the testator for a
</p>
<p>long period of time, and that he did not think his intellect

</p>
<p>was sufficient to set the river on fire.
</p>
<p>"What," said Mr. Wells, "do you mean by that expres-
</p>
<p>sion ?
</p>
<p>II
</p>
<p>l62 B.NCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>"I mean what I say, that I do not think he had sufficient
</p>
<p>strength of intellect to set the river on fire !'
</p>
<p>" Could you name any well-known person in the com-
</p>
<p>munity, who, in your judgment, would come under that cate-
</p>
<p>gory  whose brain was not large enough to set the river
</p>
<p>on fire ? "
</p>
<p>" I think I can name several."
</p>
<p>" Name one, if you please."
</p>
<p>" Carty Wells."
</p>
<p>Amid a roar of laughter, Wells told the witness to stand
</p>
<p>aside.
</p>
<p>This is not unlike the following, told by Edwards :
</p>
<p>On a trial at Auburn, New York, the counsel for the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, after severely cross-examining a witness, suddenly put
</p>
<p>on a look of severity, and said :
</p>
<p>" Mr. Witness, has not an effort been made to induce you
</p>
<p>to tell a different story ?"
</p>
<p>" A different story from what I have told ? "
</p>
<p>"That is what I mean."
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; several persons have tried to get me to tell a
</p>
<p>different story from what I have told, but they couldn't."
</p>
<p>" Now, sir, upon your oath, I wish to know who these
</p>
<p>persons are."
</p>
<p>" Well, I guess you've tried as hard as any of 'em."
</p>
<p>It also reminds us of the story related by Jeafferson, of
</p>
<p>George Jeffreys, a celebrated barrister in the time of Charles
</p>
<p>II., who was famous at browbeating witnesses ; but upon one
</p>
<p>occasion he met his master in a countryman he was examin-
</p>
<p>ing. Said he : " You fellow in the leather doublet, pray
</p>
<p>what are you paid forswearing ? " The witness replied, look-
</p>
<p>ing the barrister full in the face, and speaking with a voice
</p>
<p>of hearty good humor, " God bless you, sir, and make you
</p>
<p>an honest man. If you had no more for lying than I have
</p>
<p>for swearing, you would wear a leather doublet as well as I."

</p>
<p>Judge Wells, while on the bench, frequently indulged in
</p>
<p>witticisms. In this respect he was not unlike Judge John
</p>
<p>W. Edmonds, of New York. Edwards, in his " Pleasantries,"
</p>
<p>CARTY WELLS. 1 63
</p>
<p>says that Edmonds once had a divorce case before him,
</p>
<p>which he took under advisement. He was asked by counsel
</p>
<p>to give a speedy decision.
</p>
<p>"Why," asked the judge, "what occasion is there for
</p>
<p>hurrying about it?"
</p>
<p>" If your honor please, my client is engaged to be married
</p>
<p>again, and is only waiting the termination of these pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings."
</p>
<p>" Well," said the judge, "can't they sleep together dc bote
</p>
<p>esse, and get married mine pro tune ? "
</p>
<p>Such pleasantries were not uncommon with Judge Wells,
</p>
<p>and those who attended the sessions of his court naturally
</p>
<p>expected them.
</p>
<p>He had, however, no patience with a witness who attempted
</p>
<p>to equivocate, and often reprimanded them very severely.
</p>
<p>Judges do not, as a general thing, make sufficient allowance
</p>
<p>for the oddities and peculiarities of men who are called upon
</p>
<p>to testify. In our experience we have heard witnesses give
</p>
<p>evidence who were undoubtedly honest, and under no -cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances would depart from the truth, and yet there was
</p>
<p>an evident disinclination to tell all they knew. Edwards
</p>
<p>mentions one of this character who testified in one of the
</p>
<p>New York courts. The case was this :
</p>
<p>Sol S. missed an ax, and remarked to a hired man he
</p>
<p>believed old Wheaton had stolen it. The latter, hearing of
</p>
<p>this, brought an action for defamation of character. Ben
</p>
<p>Beebe was a witness.
</p>
<p>" What is your name ? "
</p>
<p>"Bees."
</p>
<p>"Well, witness, are you acquainted with Mr. Wheaton?"
</p>
<p>" What, old Jo there ? Know him ? I should think so."
</p>
<p>" Well, what is Mr. Wheaton's general character in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood where he resides?"
</p>

<p>Samuel M. Bay
</p>
<p>Was born in the city of Hudson, state of New York, in the
</p>
<p>year i8iO; was educated chiefly in the Hudson Academy,
</p>
<p>an old and honored institution, in which, besides the ordi-
</p>
<p>nary branches of an Enghsh education, were taught Latin,
</p>
<p>Greek, and the higher branches of mathematics. For the
</p>
<p>benefit of his health, and to escape the severe winters of the
</p>
<p>North, he visited his uncle, Dr. Joseph Lovell, who was the
</p>
<p>surgeon-general of the United States army, holding his
</p>
<p>office in Washington City. He remained in Washington
</p>
<p>about two years, during which time he was a pupil in a pri-
</p>
<p>vate school taught by Salmon P. Chase, who afterwards be-
</p>
<p>came so distinguished in life, filling successsively the posi-
</p>
<p>tions of governor of Ohio, United States senator, secretary
</p>
<p>of the treasury under Mr. Lincoln, and chief justice of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States.
</p>
<p>Upon completing his studies with Mr. Chase, he returned
</p>
<p>to New York, and, with the purpose of becoming a merchant,
</p>
<p>entered as a clerk in a large French importing house in the
</p>
<p>city of New York. Such was the confidence reposed in him
</p>
<p>by the firm, that in less than fifteen months they sent him to
</p>
<p>Europe on business, where he remained five or six months.
</p>
<p>It was while there that he came to the determination to
</p>
<p>study law, and on his return to the United States took a trip
</p>
<p>to the West, and while in Columbus, Ohio, was persuaded
</p>
<p>by Judge Swayne, since one of the judges of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of the United States, to enter his office as a student.
</p>
<p>Judge Swayne often said that Mansfield Bay read more law
</p>
<p>in three months than any other student he ever had, in a
</p>
<p>year. His fondness for books commenced very early in life,
</p>
<p>for when a boy he would retire from the sports his comrades
</p>
<p>were engaged in to peruse some book that had fallen in his

</p>
<p>hands. This passion never deserted him, for he was a con-

</p>
<p>stant reader to the day of his death. Whenever a new law-
</p>
<p>book of any repute issued from the press, he was ahnost cer-
</p>
<p>tain to obtain it. He studied law as a science, and read it with
</p>
<p>as much delight as a school-girl would read the latest novel,
</p>
<p>but we never thought that he took the same pleasure in the
</p>
<p>practice, though he became a very successful practitioner.
</p>
<p>It is not strange that he should have taken to the law, for
</p>
<p>his father and grandfather were successful lawyers, the for-
</p>
<p>mer being contemporary with Martin Van Buren, Joseph D.
</p>
<p>Monnell, Elisha Williams, John W. Edmonds, Ambrose L.
</p>
<p>Jordan, James Van Derpool, and Killian Miller, all of whom
</p>
<p>practiced at the bar of Columbia County, New York, and
</p>
<p>became distinguished in the profession, and the latter the
</p>
<p>law-partner of Ambrose Spencer, who was for a long period
</p>
<p>presiding judge of the Supreme Court of New York.
</p>
<p>Shortly after returning from Europe he visited Columbia,
</p>
<p>South Carolina, and there met for the first time his grand-
</p>
<p>uncle, Judge Elisha Hall Bay, who was judge of the highest
</p>
<p>court in that state forty-nine years, and when he died, at the
</p>
<p>advanced age of eighty-six, was still a judge. President
</p>
<p>Jefferson tendered him a seat on the bench of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of the United States, which he declined. We have
</p>
<p>often thought that this visit to South Carolina had much to
</p>
<p>do in influencing his choice of a profession.
</p>
<p>In Judge O'Neall's "Sketches of the Bench and Bar of
</p>
<p>South Carolina" there is a fine biography of Judge Bay, in
</p>
<p>which he gives an anecdote of the judge that will bear
</p>
<p>repetition.
</p>
<p>He was engaged in the trial of a criminal, and the state's
</p>
<p>attorney, or solicitor, as he is there called, put upon the
</p>
<p>stand a rather quizzical sort of witness, to prove that the
</p>
<p>defendant had attempted to escape, and asked the question,
</p>
<p>" Did not the defendant elope? " The witness replied, " She
</p>
<p>pulled string." "Pull, pulled string," said the judge, "what

</p>
<p>do you mean by that?" "She cut dirt," was the witness'
</p>
<p>reply. "Cut, cut dirt?  pull, pull string  what do you
</p>
<p>mean?" said the judge. "I mean," said the witness, "she
</p>
<p>puffed the gravel." " Pull, pull string  cut, cut dirt  puff.
</p>
<p>SAMUEL M. BAY. 1 67
</p>
<p>puff the gravel ! " said the judge ; "the man is crazy ! Take
</p>
<p>him out of court, Mr. Sheriff." The sohcitor said, " He
</p>
<p>means that she eloped." " Well, well, my man, why could
</p>
<p>you not say so?" The witness replied, "Every man to his
</p>
<p>notion, as the woman said when she kissed her cow." This
</p>
<p>startled the judge, as a monstrous thing; and he said, in his
</p>
<p>most emphatic way, "This woman kiss a cow ! Take him
</p>
<p>out of court, Mr. Sheriff."
</p>
<p>O'Neall tells another anecdote of the judge : A case of
</p>
<p>assault and battery was pending in his court, and Mr. Bowie
</p>
<p>appeared for the defense. He pleaded mollitcr nianiis iin-
</p>
<p>posnit. The proof turned out that his client knocked down
</p>
<p>the plaintiff with a fence-rail. The judge, in his excitement,
</p>
<p>said, putting the accent on the first syllable of Mr. Bowie's
</p>
<p>name, " Mr Bowie, Mr. Bowie, do you call that molliter ma-
</p>
<p>ims imposiiit, to knock a man down with a fence-rail, like a
</p>
<p>bullock?"
</p>
<p>On completing his studies, in 1833, S. M. Bay came to
</p>
<p>Missouri, and settled in Union, the county-seat of Franklin
</p>
<p>County, and in the first year obtained the best practice at
</p>
<p>that bar. In 1836 he was elected to the Legislature, and at
</p>
<p>the close of his term removed to Jefferson City, where he
</p>
<p>soon obtained a lucrative practice. He was soon after ap-
</p>
<p>pointed, by Governor Boggs, attorney-general of the state,
</p>
<p>which, in addition to other duties, required him to perform
</p>
<p>the labor of prosecuting attorney for that circuit, embracing
</p>
<p>five or six counties, and also made him cx-ojftcio reporter of
</p>
<p>the decisions of the Supreme Court, all of which he dis-
</p>
<p>charged with ability and faithfulness. The decisions re-
</p>
<p>ported by him will be found in volumes 5, 6, 7, and 8, com-
</p>
<p>mencing in the year 1837 and terminating in 1843.
</p>
<p>He was a vigorous and successful prosecutor, and few^
</p>
<p>criminals escaped punishment during his administration of
</p>
<p>the office. His prosecution of Burr, who was convicted and

</p>
<p>executed in Jefferson City for the murder of his wife, gave
</p>
<p>Mr. Bay a wide reputation over the state. It was one of the
</p>
<p>most remarkable cases in the history of crime. Burr was
</p>
<p>living with his third wife, who was taken sick, and, after lin-
</p>
<p>1 68 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>gering several weeks with a slow fever, died. The disease
</p>
<p>completely baffled the skill of the attending physicians, who
</p>
<p>were unable to account for the strange symptoms which the
</p>
<p>case developed. Burr was a wagon-maker and blacksmith,
</p>
<p>and was carrying on a large and successful business in Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son City. He was, moreover, a man of excellent character,
</p>
<p>a class-teacher in the Methodist Church, a man of means,
</p>
<p>who took a large interest in all public enterprises. There
</p>
<p>had been no difficulty between him and his wife, and, to all
</p>
<p>outside appearances, they lived together happily and affec-
</p>
<p>tionately. It is not, therefore, strange that no suspicion of
</p>
<p>foul play was suggested until the funeral procession reached
</p>
<p>the cemetery. Then a young man who was an apprentice
</p>
<p>in the blacksmith-shop disclosed to General T. L. Price his
</p>
<p>belief that Burr had murdered her by administering pounded
</p>
<p>glass in her medicine. General Price did not think there
</p>
<p>was any foundation for the suspicion, but immediately ap-
</p>
<p>proached Burr, and advised him to insist upon a post-mortem
</p>
<p>examination, as the only means of escaping an unjust accu-
</p>
<p>sation. Burr opposed it, alleging as a reason that it would
</p>
<p>be harassing to his feelings. Price insisted, and caused the
</p>
<p>procession to return to the city, where an examination was
</p>
<p>had, which resulted in the finding in the stomach a large
</p>
<p>quantity of pulverized glass. Upon the coroner's inquest
</p>
<p>two of Burr's apprentices, who boarded with him, testified
</p>
<p>that on repeated occasions when they entered the shop, on
</p>
<p>returning from their meals, they heard Burr pounding some-
</p>
<p>thing above, and on going up after he left, found on the
</p>
<p>bench particles of pounded glass, which gave rise to their
</p>
<p>suspicions.
</p>
<p>Burr was immediately arrested and thrown in jail, and
</p>
<p>when his trial took place few believed that a conviction was
</p>
<p>possible, as there seemed to be no evidence except that of
</p>
<p>the apprentices, and that was only circumstantial. But Gen-

</p>
<p>eral Bay had given the case the closest scrutiny, and found
</p>
<p>many corroborating circumstances, among which was the
</p>
<p>fact that Burr himself administered to her the medicine pre-
</p>
<p>scribed by the physicians, and would not permit any other
</p>
<p>SAMUEL M. BAY. 1 69
</p>
<p>person to do it. It was also ascertained that his first and
</p>
<p>second wives died under similar circumstances, and with
</p>
<p>apparently the same disease. Upon the trial the state pro-
</p>
<p>duced a chain of circumstances pointing to his guilt which
</p>
<p>the ingenuity of his counsel was unable to break, and a con-
</p>
<p>viction necessarily followed. On the part of the defense
</p>
<p>many witnesses were introduced whose testimony tended
</p>
<p>to show that he had lived happily with all his wives, and
</p>
<p>nothing- had ever occurred to disturb their marital relations.
</p>
<p>After the conviction, Burr was manacled with the irons he
</p>
<p>had forged for others.
</p>
<p>Prior to his execution he made a confession of his guilt,
</p>
<p>and stated that he had murdered his other wives in the same
</p>
<p>way, and assigned as the only reason that he became tired
</p>
<p>of each, and wanted another wife.
</p>
<p>General Bay prosecuted several other cases of homicide
</p>
<p>which resulted in convictions and executions.
</p>
<p>Upon the trial of Judge Leland, of the Howard Circuit,
</p>
<p>before the Legislature, upon articles of impeachment alleging
</p>
<p>incompetency, General Bay and General Stringfellow were
</p>
<p>retained on the part of the defense, both of whom made
</p>
<p>powerful arguments ; but the point made by the defense in
</p>
<p>the summing up of the case, and which produced the
</p>
<p>greatest effect upon the minds of the triers, was the fact, as
</p>
<p>made evident b}' the production of the State Reports, that
</p>
<p>in proportion to the number of appeals taken to the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court from the decisions of the circuit judges, there
</p>
<p>were less reversals from Judge Leland's circuit than any
</p>
<p>other circuit in the state. This fact, though by no means
</p>
<p>conclusive of the defendant's competency, had a powerful
</p>
<p>effect upon the Legislature, and was no doubt the chief cause
</p>
<p>of the acquittal ; for a very few votes the other way would
</p>
<p>have procured a conviction. The fact that General Bay had
</p>
<p>been a reporter of the decisions led him to suppose that such

</p>
<p>might possibly be the case, and a most laborious investiga-
</p>
<p>tion on his part proved that his supposition was well-founded.
</p>
<p>But even if untrue, the managers had no time to make the
</p>
<p>investigation, and the fact was taken as confessed.
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>170 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>While General Bay resided in Jefferson City he formed
</p>
<p>a copartnership with the Hon. Abiel Leonard, of Howard
</p>
<p>County, in their practice in the Supreme Court, which con-
</p>
<p>tinued until the former removed to St. Louis, in the latter
</p>
<p>part of 1846 or early part of 1847.
</p>
<p>Shortly after General Bay commenced the practice in St.
</p>
<p>Louis he was appointed attorney for the State Bank, and
</p>
<p>soon attained a large and lucrative practice. In July, 1849,
</p>
<p>he fell a victix 1 to the cholera, which at that time was raging
</p>
<p>most fearfully. He had been for several months engaged in
</p>
<p>erecting a dwelling on the Carondelet Road, just outside of
</p>
<p>the city limits, and it was thought that in superintending it
</p>
<p>he had exposed himself too much to the sun.
</p>
<p>It is not strange that a man of his industry, energy, close
</p>
<p>application to business, and exemplary habits should be suc-
</p>
<p>cessful as a lawyer; but one element of his success must be
</p>
<p>attributed to his thorough knowledge of the common-law
</p>
<p>system of pleading, which was then in force in this state.
</p>
<p>If engaged in a cause the merits of which were against him,
</p>
<p>he was very apt to get some advantage in framing the issues,
</p>
<p>and often by adroit pleading forced the affirmative upon the
</p>
<p>opposite party, when he should have assumed it himself.
</p>
<p>Many a case did he win in this way, and counsel opposed to
</p>
<p>him always felt uneasy until the issues were fully made up.
</p>
<p>Not unfrequently were counsel forced to take a nonsuit,
</p>
<p>when they supposed that victory was within their reach.
</p>
<p>As a speaker, General Bay was fluent, concise, and logical,
</p>
<p>but never eloquent. He selected the strong points in his
</p>
<p>case and paid no attention to the weak ones. In drawing an
</p>
<p>instruction he was exceedingly ingenius, and often drew
</p>
<p>from the court a declaration of law which, though not objec-
</p>
<p>tionable as an abstract proposition, was yet calculated to
</p>
<p>mislead or deceive the jury. No counsel opposed to him

</p>
<p>felt safe until the final termination of the case.
</p>
<p>Had he have been spared a few years longer, he would
</p>
<p>unquestionably have ranked among the ablest lawyers of the
</p>
<p>West.
</p>
<p>General Bay was a strong political writer, and often con-
</p>
<p>SAMUEL M. BAY. I/I
</p>
<p>tributed to the press very able articles, more as a matter of
</p>
<p>pastime than anything else ; for he never appended his name
</p>
<p>to his articles, preferring that the5^ should appear as edito-
</p>
<p>rial. A short time before his death a series of papers
</p>
<p>appeared in the Missouri Democrat which attracted much
</p>
<p>attention, and were copied generally by the country press.
</p>
<p>After his death the Democrat announced that S. M. Bay was
</p>
<p>the author. He wrote and composed with great rapidity,
</p>
<p>and the press were constantl}^ besieging him for contribu-
</p>
<p>tions to their columns. Though affiliating with the dominant
</p>
<p>party of the state, he never would accept an office w^iich was
</p>
<p>not within the line of his profession.
</p>
<p>In his demeanor he was rather reserved and dignified,
</p>
<p>which made him appear to a stranger haughty and overbear-
</p>
<p>ing. His studious habits had much to do with this.
</p>
<p>He died comparatively young, leaving a widow and four
</p>
<p>children  three sons and a daughter  to mourn his loss.

<p>He was the oldest brother of the author.
</p>
<p>Ephraim B. Ewing.
</p>
<p>The gentleman whose name is at the head of this article
</p>
<p>was a prominent lawyer of the state, and for several years
</p>
<p>one of the judges of our Supreme Court. He was born in
</p>
<p>Todd County, Kentucky, in May, 1819, and was the youngest
</p>
<p>son of the Rev. Finis Ewing, a distinguished divine of the
</p>
<p>Cumberland Presbyterian Church. The family came to Mis-
</p>
<p>souri in 1820, and first settled in Boonville, Cooper County,
</p>
<p>and then removed to New Lebanon, in the same county.
</p>
<p>In 1 83 1 they again changed their residence to Lafayette
</p>
<p>County. Young Ewing received his primary education in
</p>
<p>the common schools, and was then sent to the Cumberland
</p>
<p>College, at Princeton, Kentucky, where he received a very
</p>
<p>thorough and classical education. On his return from col-
</p>
<p>lege he commenced the study of the law under Judge
</p>
<p>Buckner, a distinguished lawyer from Kentucky, who for a
</p>
<p>while taught a private law-school in St. Louis. He then
</p>
<p>went to Richmond, in Ray County, and completed his
</p>
<p>studies there in the office of his brother, Hon. Robert C.
</p>
<p>Ewing, an able lawyer, and at the present time the head of
</p>
<p>the Law Department of Trinity University, in Tehuacana,
</p>
<p>Texas. Ephraim was admitted to the bar in 1842, and com-
</p>
<p>menced the practice in Ray County, in partnership with his
</p>
<p>brother. In the winter of 1846-7 he was chosen secretary
</p>
<p>of the State Senate, and in 1848 a presidential elector on
</p>
<p>the Democratic ticket.
</p>
<p>In the following year he was appointed, by Governor
</p>
<p>Austin A. King, secretary of state, and continued in that
</p>
<p>office during Governor King's administration. The position
</p>
<p>was very responsible and laborious, for he was, ex officio,
</p>
<p>superintendent of common schools.
</p>
<p>In 1856 the triangular fight for governor took place.

<p>Colonel Benton was the candidate of one wing of the Demo-

<p>EPHRAIM B. EWING. IJ-i^
</p>
<p>cratic party, Trusten Polk of another, and an opposition
</p>
<p>convention in St. Louis nominated Mr. Ewing's brother,
</p>
<p>Judge Robert C. Ewing. The subject of our sketch was
</p>
<p>nominated for attorney-general on the ticket with Mr. Polk.
</p>
<p>It was a most exciting contest, and the two Ewing brothers
</p>
<p>frequently met on the stump in opposition, not permitting,
</p>
<p>however, their affectionate relations to be disturbed. The
</p>
<p>state was most thoroughly canvassed, and the ticket headed
</p>
<p>by Governor Polk elected.
</p>
<p>In 1859 ^^- Ewing resigned his office, and was elected
</p>
<p>judge of the Supreme Court in place of Judge John C.
</p>
<p>Richardson, resigned. In 1861, by an ordinance of the State
</p>
<p>Constitutional Convention, the judicial offices were declared
</p>
<p>vacant, and Judge Ewing resumed the practice in Jefferson
</p>
<p>City. We became one of the judges of the Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>and Judge Ewing appeared before us on several occasions
</p>
<p>in the argument of causes in which he was retained. In
</p>
<p>1864 he removed to St. Louis, and, after practicing several
</p>
<p>years at that bar, was elected judge of the St. Louis Circuit
</p>
<p>Court for a term of six years, but in 1872 resigned, and was
</p>
<p>again elected to the Supreme Bench, but in the following June
</p>
<p>fell a victim to cerebro-spinal meningitis, which was pre-
</p>
<p>vailing in a most malignant form. He was then in his fifty-
</p>
<p>third year. He left a large family, and his loss was greatly
</p>
<p>deplored in and out of the profession.
</p>
<p>Our opportunities of forming an estimate of Judge Ewing's
</p>
<p>professional ability were very good, for while, as before stated,
</p>
<p>we were on the bench of the Supreme Court he often ap-
</p>
<p>peared before us, as we had frequently appeared before him
</p>
<p>when he was clothed with the same position. To say that
</p>
<p>Judge Ewing filled every public office held by him with ability
</p>
<p>and fidelity is only according that merit which was univer-
</p>
<p>sally conceded to him. He was by no means a brilliant man,
</p>
<p>but was thoroughly educated in the law, and, in his argu

<p>ments before a court or jury, was clear, lucid, and logical ;
</p>
<p>indeed, he could not be otherwise, for he not only had a
</p>
<p>good legal mind, but was a diligent student, with unexcep-
</p>
<p>tionable habits, and pursued the study of the law with a
</p>
<p>1/4 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>devotion not excelled by any other member of the profes-
</p>
<p>sion.
</p>
<p>Judge Ewing had none of the gifts of oratory, but was
</p>
<p>always listened to with close attention, for he made but few
</p>
<p>points in a case, and presented them with force and perspi-
</p>
<p>cuity. His decisions on the bench read well, and are well
</p>
<p>sustained by authority, for he seldom made a citation which
</p>
<p>did not directly bear on the subject discussed.
</p>
<p>He was a very reserved man, seldom mingling with the
</p>
<p>masses, and the secret of his popularity can only be attrib-
</p>
<p>uted to the fact that the people of the state had unbounded
</p>
<p>confidence in his integrity and honesty of purpose.
</p>
<p>Upon the occasion of his funeral we listened to a very able
</p>
<p>discourse, delivered by the Rev. Dr. Linn, in the Methodist
</p>
<p>church, the subject being "The dead jurist." The church
</p>
<p>was very large, and filled to its utmost capacity, evincing the
</p>
<p>high appreciation of the people for Judge Ewing's public ser-
</p>
<p>vices, and his great moral worth.
</p>
<p>Judge Ewing was a tall, thin, spare-made man, with a very
</p>

<p>tribute of respect to his memory.
</p>
<p>JOHN THORNTON.
</p>
<p>Among the pioneers of the Missouri bar was John Thorn-
</p>
<p>ton, whose acquaintance we made in the winter of 1836-7.
</p>
<p>He was a native of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and
</p>
<p>born in 1786. When John was only seven years of age his
</p>
<p>father moved into Kentucky, and the son was sent to the
</p>
<p>schools of that day and received a common-school educa-
</p>
<p>tion. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar, but
</p>
<p>what success attended him in that state we are unable
</p>
<p>to say.
</p>
<p>In 1 8 16 he came to Missouri and located at old Franklin,
</p>
<p>where he practiced under the territorial government. In the
</p>
<p>same year the common law was introduced into Missouri,
</p>
<p>five years in advance of the state government. After resid-
</p>
<p>ing a few years in old Franklin he changed his residence to
</p>
<p>Liberty, in Clay County, where he continued during life.
</p>
<p>He had an extensive practice, and enjoyed a fine reputation
</p>
<p>as a law}^er. He also became a prominent Democratic poli-
</p>
<p>tician, and commenced public life as a member of the
</p>
<p>Legislature from Clay County in 1824. He continued in
</p>
<p>the Legislature until 1832, and was speaker of the House
</p>
<p>during the sessions of 1828 and 1830. The position was then
</p>
<p>regarded as next in the line of promotion to the governor.
</p>
<p>In 1836 he again represented Clay County in the General
</p>
<p>Assembly, and it was during this session that we first saw
</p>
<p>and became acquainted with him.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately for his political promotion, he opposed
</p>
<p>General Jackson's anti-nullification proclamation, which
</p>
<p>caused him to lose caste with the Jackson wing of his party,
</p>
<p>and he never again sought public life. He was an ardent
</p>
<p>State-rights Democrat of the Calhoun school, and looked
</p>
<p>upon the proclamation as a Federal measure, and in conflict

</p>
<p>1/6 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Colonel Thornton was a lawyer of considerable ability, al-
</p>
<p>ways able to command a good practice, and always occupy-
</p>
<p>ing a high position at the bar. He was a fluent and impress-
</p>
<p>ive speaker, and popular and genial in his manners. He had
</p>
<p>a tall, manly, and imposing figure, and was attractive in per-
</p>
<p>son. He possessed a large fund of humor and wit, the indul-
</p>
<p>gence of which on one occasion involved him in a personal
</p>
<p>difficulty with the landlady of the hotel at Jefferson City,
</p>
<p>where he was boarding during a session of the Legislature.
</p>
<p>His seat was at the head of the table, and in front of him
</p>
<p>was placed a roast pig, which appeared and reappeared for
</p>
<p>four or five successive days  a little oftener, in the opinion
</p>
<p>of Mr. Thornton, than was required by the etiquette of
</p>
<p>the table. On its last appearance, however, Mr. Thornton
</p>
<p>took his usual seat, and fixing his eye intently upon the face
</p>
<p>of the pig, remarked with a comical expression, and in the
</p>
<p>hearing of the landlady, " Your countenance is very familiar;
</p>
<p>we must have met frequently before." In an instant the
</p>
<p>good lady grasped the pig by both ears and hurled the car-
</p>
<p>cass at the head of Mr. Thornton, which barely escaped him.
</p>
<p>It occurred in tlie presence of forty or fifty boarders, and
</p>
<p>the scene can better be imagined than described.
</p>
<p>This story of the pig is not unlike the one told by Stephen
</p>
<p>F. Miller on the late Judge John M. Dooley, of Georgia.
</p>
<p>On one occasion he was most happy in giving a hint to a
</p>
<p>landlord in one of the counties of his circuit, who had been
</p>
<p>presenting the judge every day for dinner during the court a
</p>
<p>half-grown hog in the shape of a stuffed baked pig. The
</p>
<p>cXqnqx, piinctiial gentleuian had attended upon the table every
</p>
<p>day without injury ; no fork had pierced him. When first
</p>
<p>asked to take some of Xh^ pig, the judge replied that he was
</p>
<p>certainly a well-grown />z^ ; that he was much larger, and in
</p>
<p>better order, than any of his fattened hogs. At the close of
</p>
<p>the term, on finishing the dinner of the last day, he called

</p>
<p>his own recognizance to be and appear at the next term of

<p>the court, with the thanks of the court for his prompt and
</p>
<p>faithful, attendance during the term.
</p>
<p>JOHN THORNTON. 1 7/
</p>
<p>Colonel Thornton raised a large family; one of his
</p>
<p>daughters became the wife of that distinguished lawyer and
</p>
<p>soldier, General A. W. Doniphan. He was a high-toned
</p>
<p>man, and, in the enunciation of his opinions, outspoken and
</p>
<p>fearless, paying little regard to popular opinion  an element
</p>
<p>in his character not calculated to advance his political
</p>
<p>interests.
</p>
<p>He died in 1847, ^^ ^^^ sixty-first year of his age.

</p>
<p>Thomas R. Ansell.
</p>
<p>This lawyer was a resident of Fulton, Callaway County,
</p>
<p>Missouri, and practiced his profession there at least a quarter
</p>
<p>of a century. He was an Englishman, and born in London
</p>
<p>in 1796. He received a good English education, and at the
</p>
<p>age of twenty-five went upon the stage, and performed for
</p>
<p>several years with Edmund Keene and other distinguished
</p>
<p>actors. In 1828 he came to America, and took a tour
</p>
<p>through all our large cities, playing with Forrest, Parsons,
</p>
<p>and the elder Booth. At the conclusion of an engagement
</p>
<p>at Louisville he determined to abandon the stage, and went
</p>
<p>to Lexington, Kentucky, where he taught school for nearly
</p>
<p>two years.
</p>
<p>In 1833 he came to Missouri and opened a school in Cal-
</p>
<p>laway County, and was very successful as a teacher. He
</p>
<p>was rigid and exacting in his discipline, and exceedingly
</p>
<p>punctilious in his demands of grammatical accuracy upon
</p>
<p>the part of his pupils, however small and untutored. After
</p>
<p>teaching a few years he went into the office of J. C. Hock-
</p>
<p>aday, Esq., clerk and recorder of the county, and wrote for
</p>
<p>several months. In recording deeds he exhibited his wonted
</p>
<p>exactness by insisting upon changing the orthography where
</p>
<p>it was faulty, and reforming ungrammatical sentences; and
</p>
<p>but for the remonstrance of Mr. Hockaday would have made
</p>
<p>the record anything but a true transcript of the deed. While
</p>
<p>in Mr. Hockaday's office he acquired a taste for the law, en-
</p>
<p>tered upon its study at once, and in 1839 was admitted to
</p>
<p>the bar, and commenced the practice in Fulton, where he re-
</p>
<p>sided until his death, in September, 1866. He attempted,
</p>
<p>also, to cultivate a small tract of land, but as a farmer was
</p>
<p>eminently unsuccessful. He became a very laborious stu-
</p>
<p>dent, and was thoroughly read in the law, as is shown by his

<p>briefs in the Supreme Court, which have been rarely excelled
</p>
<p>THOMAS R. AN SELL. 1 79
</p>
<p>for legal research and learning. His proper field in the pro-
</p>
<p>fession was that of a counselor. As a practitioner he was
</p>
<p>too eccentric, vehement, impracticable, and tedious, and
</p>
<p>while addressing the court or jury would enter so largely
</p>
<p>into detail as to weary, if not exhaust, their patience. At
</p>
<p>times he would say something that was quite brilliant, yet in
</p>
<p>the next sentence destroy its effect by some act or remark
</p>
<p>which made himself the subject of ridicule. A noted in-
</p>
<p>stance of this occurred upon the trial of a cause in which he
</p>
<p>and Mr. Hayden were engaged, on opposite sides. He was
</p>
<p>arguing before the jury the proposition that the mere
</p>
<p>declaration of a party that he ivoidd do a certain thing was
</p>
<p>no evidence that he liad done it, and to illustrate his idea he
</p>
<p>hallooed out at the top of his voice, and in his dramatic way,
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen of the jury, I am going to jump out of that
</p>
<p>window [the window being about fifteen feet from where he
</p>
<p>was speaking]. I tell you I am going to jump out of that
</p>
<p>window ;" and suiting his action to the word, immediateh' ran
</p>
<p>for the window, placed his hands upon the sill, as though in
</p>
<p>the act of jumping, when Mr. Hayden, who had followed
</p>
<p>him, caught him by the shoulder, and, to make the thing as
</p>
<p>ludicrous as possible, cried out in his peculiar and solemn
</p>
<p>wa\', "Judge Ansell, don't jump out of that window  it
</p>
<p>will hurt you." A roar of laughter followed, and the judge's
</p>
<p>illustration was turned into a farce. But to recover himself
</p>
<p>he turned to the jury, when quiet was restored, and said,
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, I told you I would jump out of that window,
</p>
<p>but did I do it?" At this point Mr. Hayden replied, "No,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, he did not ; but it was because I prevented him."
</p>
<p>This produced another outbreak of laughter, which was only
</p>
<p>suppressed by the court fining Mr. Hayden ^5.
</p>
<p>As may well be supposed. Judge Ansell's (he obtained
</p>
<p>his title by serving on the bench of the County Court of
</p>
<p>Callaway County) style of speaking was very dramatic, and

</p>
<p>he was very profuse in his quotations from Shakspeare and
</p>
<p>other dramatic writers, and frequently with fine effect.
</p>
<p>He never entered the political arena but once, and that was
</p>
<p>during the war, when he became a candidate for the State

</p>
<p>Senate. Had he exhibited any prudence he might have
</p>
<p>been elected, for the people were disposed to gratify his po-
</p>
<p>litical aspirations ; but unfortunately he issued a circular deal-
</p>
<p>ing some heavy blows against disloyalty. In the concluding
</p>
<p>part (jf it he stated in italics that the sentiments he had
</p>
<p>expressed were intended for the she devils as well as the lie
</p>
<p>devils of his district. As a large majority of the people of
</p>
<p>Callaway were secessionists, and the ladies decidedly so,
</p>
<p>Judge Ansell's circular destroyed all prospects of his elec-
</p>
<p>tion, and he met with an inglorious defeat.
</p>
<p>The judge was a man of kind heart and generous im-
</p>
<p>pulses, and during his long professional career no one ever
</p>
<p>questioned his integrity. He was full of sympathy for the
</p>
<p>poor and unfortunate, and never failed to respond to the
</p>
<p>calls of charity. He had a high temper, was quick to resent
</p>
<p>an intentional insult, but ever ready to forgive upon the ten-
</p>
<p>der of a proper apology or reparation. Judge Ansell never
</p>
<p>married, though he was fond of the society of ladies, and
</p>
<p>placed a high estimate upon the gentler sex. In their com-
</p>
<p>pany he was very polite, but oftentimes committed gross
</p>
<p>blunders, producing much laughter among the girls, and yet
</p>
<p>he seemed totally unconscious of the cause of the mer-
</p>
<p>riment.
</p>
<p>At one time he was seized with a mania for hunting, and,
</p>
<p>being unable to distinguish one bird from another, frequently
</p>
<p>made himself the butt of ridicule. On one occasion he
</p>
<p>killed a buzzard, supposing it to be a wild turkey, brought
</p>
<p>it to his boardjng-house, and became so jubilant over his
</p>
<p>success that he directed how it should be cooked and
</p>
<p>dressed, and actually invited one or two friends to dine with
</p>
<p>him, and partake of the feast. Upon being told by the
</p>
<p>landlord of his mistake, he becaine greatly enraged, and left
</p>
<p>his house ; but it put an end to his hunting exploits.
</p>
<p>He once hired a horse to ride to Jefferson City, a distance

<p>of thirty miles, to attend a session of the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>He remained in Jefferson several days, and when about to
</p>
<p>leave for home, went to the stable for his horse, and the
</p>
<p>stable-keeper delivered him the wrong horse; but the judge
</p>
<p>THOMAS R. AN SELL. l8l
</p>
<p>rode him home, and never discovered the mistake until he
</p>
<p>went to return the animal he had hired.
</p>
<p>Our acquaintance with Judge Ansell commenced about
</p>
<p>thirty }'ears ago. We met on a steamer going up the Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, and both of us were on our way to the Chouteau
</p>
<p>Springs, at that time a favorite watering-place about ten
</p>
<p>miles from Boonville. There were at least thirty others on
</p>
<p>board destined for the same place, and when we landed at
</p>
<p>Boonville, a little after dark, we learned that the town was
</p>
<p>crowded with people, the occasion of which we do not now
</p>
<p>recollect. Mr. McPherson, the proprietor of the principal
</p>
<p>hotel in the place, came on board and expressed his regrets
</p>
<p>at not having a vacant bed in his house. The ladies of the
</p>
<p>party were in great tribulation, and the captain of the boat
</p>
<p>was obliging enough to remain over an hour to enable us to
</p>
<p>seek quarters for the night. Several reports came in that no
</p>
<p>quarters could be found. While the judge and myself were
</p>
<p>standing on the wharf, cogitating over our dilemma, Mr. S.,
</p>
<p>a young lawyer from St. Louis, with whom we had a slight
</p>
<p>acquaintance, approached us, and, after the usual salutation,
</p>
<p>remarked, " I understand you are looking for a place to put
</p>
<p>up ; I have a large room at McPherson's, with two double
</p>
<p>beds, one of which is at the service of yourself and friend."
</p>
<p>Most gladly we accepted the offer, and wound our way to
</p>
<p>the hotel. The room was one of the best in the house, and
</p>
<p>contained two large beds. At about twelve o'clock the
</p>
<p>judge and myself retired, and were soon in the land of happy
</p>
<p>dreams. S. came in about an hour afterwards, and
</p>
<p>ensconced himself in the other bed. About three o'clock
</p>
<p>in the morning we were aroused by S., who jumped into our
</p>
<p>bed, seized the judge by the throat, and a scuffle ensued
</p>
<p>which no language can describe. In a few minutes S. relin-
</p>
<p>quished his hold upon the judge, ran out of the room yell-
</p>
<p>ing at the top of his voice, and in a moment the hall was

</p>
<p>filled with guests in their night-clothes, male and female,
</p>
<p>greatly alarmed and wanting to know the cause of the dis-
</p>
<p>turbance. The judge looked wild and scared, unable to com-
</p>
<p>prehend the situation, until we told him that our quondam
</p>
<p>1 82 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>friend had mereh' received a visit from the man zvith the
</p>
<p>poker, and as soon as he could extricate himself from the
</p>
<p>snakes would be all right again. We brought S. back to the
</p>
<p>room, kept him awake for the remainder of the night, and
</p>
<p>next morning we started for the springs. In relating the
</p>
<p>adventure afterwards, Judge Ansell always called it the " bat-
</p>
<p>tle of the snakes."
</p>
<p>Shortly prior to the presidential election of 1844 the
</p>
<p>Democrats of central Missouri held a mass meeting at Fay-
</p>
<p>ette, and a number of speakers were invited from the differ-
</p>
<p>ent counties, and among them Mr. Ansell. He made an
</p>
<p>excellent speech, but near the close of it an incident
</p>
<p>occurred which completely destroyed its anticipated effect.
</p>
<p>He was depicting in glowing colors the different measures of
</p>
<p>General Jackson's administration, and enumerating the
</p>
<p>prominent acts of his life, and at the conclusion of each act
</p>
<p>would say, " Who did that ? " and without answering it, pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to another with the same inquiry, " Who did that ? "
</p>
<p>and after enumerating a dozen or more, raised his voice to
</p>
<p>the highest pitch and said, " I will tell you, gentlemen ; it
</p>
<p>was the great General  "and before he had time to finish
</p>
<p>the sentence some one in the audience hallooed out, " Jl/ac-
</p>
<p>deth." In an instant the meeting was convulsed with laugh-
</p>
<p>ter, which the presiding officer was unable to suppress, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Ansell sat down a thoroughl)^ disgusted man. The the-
</p>
<p>atrical attitude which he assumed, and his dramatic way of
</p>
<p>propounding the question, no doubt suggested the inter-

<p>ruption.
</p>
<p>JOE Davis
</p>
<p>Was a prominent and well-known lawyer in Fayette, Howard
</p>
<p>County. He was born in Christian County, Kentucky, Jan-
</p>
<p>uary 14, 1804, and came with his parents to Missouri in
</p>
<p>18 1 8, who settled near Fayette. Young Davis was very
</p>
<p>solicitous to obtain a good education, for when quite small
</p>
<p>he often expressed his intention to become a lawyer, but his
</p>
<p>father was able to give him only such advantages as the
</p>
<p>common schools of that day afforded. He, however, took
</p>
<p>private lessons in Latin from a gentleman in the neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood, and became a very good Latin scholar. This, added
</p>
<p>to his fondness for books and habits of reading, prepared
</p>
<p>him to enter upon the study of the law. He had procured
</p>
<p>a clerkship in the land-office at old Franklin, and devoted
</p>
<p>his leisure hours to study. He pursued the study of his
</p>
<p>profession part of the time with General John Wilson, of
</p>
<p>Fayette, and the remainder with Edward Bates, of St.
</p>
<p>Louis ; and on reaching his majority obtained a license to
</p>
<p>practice, and opened an office in old Franklin, but soon
</p>
<p>after removed to Fayette, where he continued to practice
</p>
<p>through life.
</p>
<p>Before commencing the practice, however, he was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed by the government one of the commissioners to
</p>
<p>mark and lay out a route for a road leading from our state
</p>
<p>border to Santa Fe, in New Mexico, which was a very labo-
</p>
<p>rious undertaking ; for the commissioners had not only to
</p>
<p>camp out in all kinds of weather, but were constantly
</p>
<p>exposed to attacks from hostile Indians, who were always
</p>
<p>jealous of any encroachments upon their hunting-grounds.
</p>
<p>Young Davis, however, was bold, fearless, and enterprising,
</p>
<p>and this early adventure gave him a taste for Indian war-
</p>
<p>fare ; for he afterwards served in two wars, in one of which

</p>
<p>he was colonel of a regiment in General J. B. Clark's brig-
</p>
<p>184 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>ade. When we became involved in what was known as the
</p>
<p>Mormon War, Governor Boggs placed him in command of a
</p>
<p>brigade of state militia.
</p>
<p>Our acquaintance with him commenced in 1844, and we
</p>
<p>served two sessions with him in the State Legislature com-
</p>
<p>mencing in that year, though he continued to represent How-
</p>
<p>ard County till 1864. He was very fond of political life, and
</p>
<p>at least once became a candidate for Congress on the Whig
</p>
<p>ticket; but, as his party was in the minority, had necessarily
</p>
<p>to encounter a defeat. He was regarded in the Legislature
</p>
<p>as a strong and vigorous speaker, severe and sarcastic upon
</p>
<p>his political adversaries, and took every occasion to give the
</p>
<p>Democrats a rap on the knuckles for alleged inconsistencies;
</p>
<p>but his attacks were characterized by so much fun and good
</p>
<p>humor that no offense was taken, and he in fact was popular
</p>
<p>with all parties. When he rose to speak, every one expected
</p>
<p>a good anecdote, and he scarcely ever disappointed them.
</p>
<p>In relating one he looked as grave and serious as a Quaker
</p>
<p>preacher, and the louder the laugh the graver he looked.
</p>
<p>He had a strong voice, generally raised it to a high pitch,
</p>
<p>and spoke slowly and with much deliberation.
</p>
<p>He took a deep interest in all efforts to advance the cause
</p>
<p>of education, and for years was a curator in the Central Col-
</p>
<p>lege at Fayette, and always contributed largely of his means

<p>esting family to mourn his loss.
</p>
<p>JOHN JAMEISON.
</p>
<p>Of the early public men of Missouri few were better
</p>
<p>known, and none more popular, than John Jameison, of Ful-
</p>
<p>ton, Callaway County. Of the early life of Mr. Jameison
</p>
<p>but little is known beyond the fact that his education was
</p>
<p>obtained in the common schools of Montgomery County,
</p>
<p>Kentucky, where he was born near the close of the eight-
</p>
<p>eenth century. In 1825 he came to Missouri, and settled in
</p>
<p>Fulton, entering the law-office of William Lucas, brother of
</p>
<p>the late James H. Lucas, with whom he completed his
</p>
<p>studies, which had been commenced before leaving Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky. In 1826 he was admitted to the bar, and opened a
</p>
<p>law-office in Fulton. He soon obtained a fair practice, con-
</p>
<p>sidering the small amount of litigation that then obtained.
</p>
<p>In 1830 he was elected from Callaway County to the
</p>
<p>lower house of the General Assembly, and served until 1836.
</p>
<p>During a part of the time he was speaker. He was by no
</p>
<p>means a thorough parliamentarian, yet few appeals were
</p>
<p>taken from his decisions, as both political parties reposed
</p>
<p>confidence in his judgment and integrity. In 1839 he was
</p>
<p>elected to Congress to fill a vacancy created by the death
</p>
<p>of Albert Harrison, and served three terms. At that time
</p>
<p>congressmen were elected in Missouri under the general-
</p>
<p>ticket system, and not by districts, as at present. Mr.
</p>
<p>Jameison's career in Congress was in no sense brilliant, yet
</p>
<p>he made a fair member, and proved a strong advocate of
</p>
<p>Western interests. His dislike for Speaker Winthrop was so
</p>
<p>great that he took particular pleasure in annoying him by
</p>
<p>appeals from his decisions, and by rising to points of order,
</p>
<p>and upon one occasion, when under considerable excitement,
</p>
<p>made a violent speech against him, charging him, among
</p>
<p>other things, with gross partiality. It was occasioned by the

</p>
<p>failure of Mr. Winthrop to award him the floor when he
</p>
<p>1 86 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>thought he was fairly entitled to it. Captain Jameison exer-
</p>
<p>cised considerable influence in Congress by his pleasant and
</p>
<p>affable demeanor, and by the good practical sense which he
</p>
<p>exhibited on all occasions; but his want of application and
</p>
<p>study prevented hini from obtaining a national reputation.
</p>
<p>As a lawyer he was not profound, but as a jury advocate
</p>
<p>was not excelled by any one in central Missouri, and by few,
</p>
<p>if any, in the state. His power consisted in his strong and
</p>
<p>forcible presentation of the strong points in his case, and in
</p>
<p>exposing the weak ones in his adversary's. He was, also, an
</p>
<p>excellent judge of men, and seemed to divine almost at a
</p>
<p>glance what particular line of argument w^ould reach and
</p>
<p>influence each juror  in fact, he could almost read by in-
</p>
<p>tuition the thoughts of each juror on the panel. If an
</p>
<p>instruction of the court was unfavorable to his cause, he
</p>
<p>would gradually lead the attention of the jury from it, and
</p>
<p>thus escape partially its pernicious effects.
</p>
<p>His reluctance to labor and research made it necessary for
</p>
<p>him to have a law-partner, and for many )'ears he was asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with the Hon. James K. Sheely, now of Independence,
</p>
<p>a fine lawyer, and a gentleman who has filled most credit-
</p>
<p>ably many places of public trust.
</p>
<p>We became Mr. Jameison's successor in Congress ; and
</p>
<p>soon after he studied divinity, and became a licensed
</p>
<p>preacher in the Christian Church. His success in the min-
</p>
<p>istry was by no means equal to that at the bar. He com-
</p>
<p>menced too late in life, and was wanting in animation and
</p>
<p>zeal.
</p>
<p>He died in 1855 or 1856, leaving a widow and four chil-
</p>
<p>dren.
</p>
<p>Captain Jameison was generous to a fault, and the mean-
</p>
<p>est beggar could impose on him. He was, also, a social
</p>
<p>and convivial man, and during that part of his life when
</p>
<p>engaged in politics he would sometimes imbibe a little too

<p>freely, producing a slight unsteadiness in his walk, which he
</p>
<p>seemed to apprehend would be noticed ; and it was said that^
</p>
<p>upon such occasions he would tie over his knee a large silk
</p>
<p>handkerchief, and complain of rheumatism, and if any one

</p>
<p>expressed sympathy for him, would remark, " Oh, it is
</p>
<p>immateriaL" Whether this was an invention of his friends
</p>
<p>(for he had no enemies), to produce a httle merriment at his
</p>
<p>expense, we are not advised; but the expression "it is
</p>
<p>immaterial " was used by him on all occasions, until he got
</p>
<p>the name of " Immaterial John " thoroughly fastened upon
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>There are many anecdotes told of Mr. Jameison which
</p>
<p>illustrate the influence he exercised with juries. He was
</p>
<p>once engaged in the defense of a man charged with stealing
</p>
<p>corn. The evidence disclosed the fact that the accused had
</p>
<p>been seen carrying away several small loads, but Mr. Jamei-
</p>
<p>son, b}^ an ingenious cross-examination of the state's wit-
</p>
<p>ness, forced him to admit that the corn was in shucks,
</p>
<p>and that he did not see what was in the shucks. He brought
</p>
<p>in several ears in shucks, and paraded them before the jury,
</p>
<p>and asked each by name if he could see any corn through
</p>
<p>the shuck ; and, in a manner peculiar to himself, asked the
</p>
<p>jury what faith they could put in the testimony of a man who
</p>
<p>would deliberately and coolly swear ''that he could see through
</p>
<p>shucks." The prisoner was acquitted, but the shuck story
</p>
<p>stuck to his counsel through life.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jameison was once engaged in an argument in the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court with Edward Bates on the opposite side, and
</p>
<p>frequently took occasion to say: "When the plaintiff did
</p>
<p>so and so, / turned round and did so and so." "When the
</p>
<p>plaintiff proved so and so by John Smith, I turned round 3.nd
</p>
<p>proved so and so by John Jones." " When the plaintiff  "
</p>
<p>Here he was interrupted by Judge Tompkins, who said, " Now,
</p>
<p>Mr. Jameison, do you really mean to state that upon every
</p>
<p>motion made by the plaintiff, and upon every step he took
</p>
<p>in the cause, you actually turned all the zvay round?" " I will
</p>
<p>explain, if you honor please," said Mr. Jameison; and, suiting
</p>
<p>the action to the word, turned upon his heel, and, picking

</p>
<p>up his hat, walked out of the court-room, to the great amuse-
</p>
<p>ment of the audience and the discomfiture of the court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jameison's tact in trying a cause before a jury was un-
</p>
<p>surpassed. He seemed to know how to turn everything to
</p>
<p>1 88 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>his own advantage, and how to bring ridicule upon his ad-
</p>
<p>versary.
</p>
<p>O'Neall, in his "Bench and Bar of South Carohna," gives
</p>
<p>a sketch of a lawyer in that state, by the name of Carnes,
</p>
<p>who had this power in a remarkable degree, and though un-
</p>
<p>educated, and with but little knowledge of the law, scarcely
</p>
<p>ever failed of success when he could get his case submitted to
</p>
<p>a jury. He gives the following as an illustration of his inge-
</p>
<p>nuity : He once brought an action for assault and battery,
</p>
<p>in which the lawyer for the defense pleaded, " uiollitcr manus
</p>
<p>iinposint." The proof showed an aggravated assault and bat-
</p>
<p>tery. When it came to Carnes' turn to address the jury, he
</p>
<p>said : " Gentlemen, you all know I am no Latin scholar, but
</p>
<p>I think I can translate the gentleman's plea : molliter, he
</p>
<p>mauled; niamis, the man; ivtpositit, and imposed on him.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, did you ever hear of such impudence?  to
</p>
<p>shamefully abuse my client, and then to come into court
</p>
<p>and brag of it ! " The argument was irresistible.
</p>
<p>We never saw Mr. Jameison in the pulpit, but it is said he
</p>
<p>occasionally delivered a sermon of much force and effect.
</p>
<p>He was greatly beloved by the people of Callaway, who

<p>fondly cherish his memory.
</p>
<p>William Porter.
</p>
<p>In 1848 we took a trip on horseback to the north-eastern
</p>
<p>part of the state, and spent one night and part of a day in
</p>
<p>Troy, the county-seat of Lincoln County, a pleasant village
</p>
<p>of about 400 or 500 inhabitants, and there became acquainted
</p>
<p>with Mr. Porter, a resident lawyer in good practice. He was
</p>
<p>a native of Virginia, born in Frederick County, about 1797
</p>
<p>or 1798. About 1825 he married Miss Ann Anderson, of
</p>
<p>Frederick, and about five years thereafter left Virginia for
</p>
<p>Missouri, and settled in Lincoln County, where he practiced
</p>
<p>law up to the time of his death, in 1866, living part of his
</p>
<p>time on a small farm near Troy. He survived his wife about
</p>
<p>fifteen years, and remained a widower until his death. He
</p>
<p>raised two children, both of whom married, and some of his
</p>
<p>descendants are now living in Ohio, and the remainder in
</p>
<p>Missouri. Mr. Porter's married life was a very happy one,
</p>
<p>and he took the death of his wife very hard, and went but
</p>
<p>little in society afterwards.
</p>
<p>He was a sound and reliable lawyer, and seemed much
</p>
<p>devoted to his profession ; and, although he took a deep in-
</p>
<p>terest in public affairs, never would permit himself to be
</p>
<p>drawn into politics. The only public position he ever filled
</p>
<p>was that of prosecuting attorney, and he would not have ac-
</p>
<p>cepted that had it not been in the line of his profession.
</p>
<p>Though not a brilliant man, he was very successful in his
</p>
<p>practice, for he was faithful to his client, and made his
</p>
<p>client's cause his own.
</p>
<p>In his habits he was frugal, moral, and industrious. He
</p>
<p>had been many years connected with the Presbyterian
</p>
<p>Church, and always appeared to be embarrassed when called
</p>
<p>upon in public to pray. He was once asked the cause of

<p>this, and in reply said it was one thing to address a judge or
</p>
<p>IQO BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>jury, and a very different thing to address the Almighty,
</p>
<p>from whose decrees there could be no appeal.
</p>
<p>Mr. Porter was a very domestic man, fond of the society
</p>
<p>of his friends, and to the poor, kind and benevolent. His
</p>
<p>death was regarded as a great loss, more particularly to the
</p>
<p>county of Lincoln, for the people were accustomed to look

</p>
<p>up to him for counsel and advice.
</p>
<p>Thomas B. Hudson.
</p>
<p>The subject of this sketch was a steadfast and highly-
</p>
<p>valued friend of the author for nearly a quarter of a century.
</p>
<p>Though belonging to the same political organization, and
</p>
<p>working side by side in a common cause and for the attain-
</p>
<p>ment of the same political end, we occasionally differed
</p>
<p>respecting both men and measures, but that difference of
</p>
<p>opinion never in the remotest degree disturbed the pleasant
</p>
<p>relations existing between us.
</p>
<p>Though the career of Mr. Hudson was not as eventful as
</p>
<p>that of some whom we have attempted to portray in this
</p>
<p>volume, yet it is in many respects more difficult to describe ;
</p>
<p>for no one can draw a life-like picture of him who did not
</p>
<p>know and see him in the various relations of life. His
</p>
<p>strong disinclination to assume a trait of character which
</p>
<p>did not belong to him not unfrequently led him to doubt the
</p>
<p>possession of others to which no person had a higher claim.
</p>
<p>He was . a self-made man, and the architect of his own
</p>
<p>fortune. With scarcely any of the advantages which tend
</p>
<p>to pave the way to success in life, he entered upon his pro-
</p>
<p>fessional career in a land of strangers, where he had to
</p>
<p>encounter the prejudice of wealth and the jealousy of
</p>
<p>strong competition, with no other weapons but a strong, vig-
</p>
<p>orous native intellect, and a self-reliant, indomitable will.
</p>
<p>He found at the St. Louis bar such men as Geyer, Gamble,
</p>
<p>Bates, Darby, Spalding, Allen, Lawless, and Mullanphy, who
</p>
<p>had already achieved professional distinction ; while others,
</p>
<p>nearer his own age, were rapidly ascending the ladder of
</p>
<p>fame. With all this formidable competition, Mr. Hudson
</p>
<p>soon obtained rank and position, and was never wanting in
</p>
<p>clients as long as his health did not interfere with the active
</p>
<p>pursuit of his profession.

</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson was born in Davidson County, Tennessee, in
</p>
<p>192 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>1 8 14. Mis father, who was orighially from Maryland, was
</p>
<p>an upright, intelhgent farmer, and, fully appreciating the
</p>
<p>advantages of an education, sent his son to the best schools
</p>
<p>that the country then afforded. He then took a regular aca-
</p>
<p>demic course, and at the age of eighteen commenced the study
</p>
<p>of the law with S. C. Pavet, an able lawyer of Tennessee.
</p>
<p>His mother was an excellent Christian lady, who implanted
</p>
<p>in the heart of her son that veneration for truth and integ-
</p>
<p>rity which adhered to him through life. It is not probable
</p>
<p>that Mr. Hudson applied for admission to the bar in Tennes-
</p>
<p>see, for on reaching his majority he came to St. Louis, and
</p>
<p>shortly afterwards was licensed by the Supreme Court of our
</p>
<p>state. The examination of students applying for admission
</p>
<p>to the bar at that time was very strict, and generally con-
</p>
<p>ducted by one or more of the supreme judges in person;
</p>
<p>and it is said that they complimented Mr. Hudson upon the
</p>
<p>good examination he had passed.
</p>
<p>The first public position held by him was as a member of
</p>
<p>the City Council of St. Louis, during the administration of
</p>
<p>Mayor John F. Darby. He made an efficient and active
</p>
<p>member, and originated several measures which proved
</p>
<p>highly advantageous to the city. From 1842 to 1843 he was
</p>
<p>city counselor of St. Louis.
</p>
<p>In 1842 he was elected by the people of St. Louis to a
</p>
<p>seat in the popular branch of our State Legislature, and was
</p>
<p>soon recognized as one of the leaders of the Democratic
</p>
<p>party. We held a seat in the same body from Franklin
</p>
<p>County. Mr. Hudson belonged to the old Jeffersonian
</p>
<p>school of strict constructionists. For one of his limited
</p>
<p>experience he was a good parliamentarian, and as a ready
</p>
<p>and fluent debater had but few equals in the House. He
</p>
<p>was not an orator in the usual acceptation of that term, for
</p>
<p>he had none of the graces of elocution, and seldom indulged
</p>
<p>in figurative speech. He aimed to convince the under-

</p>
<p>standing, rather than please the fancy. He belonged to the
</p>
<p>Douglas school of speakers, and his fine power of analyza-
</p>
<p>tion and discrimination, aided by a fervid and impressive
</p>
<p>delivery, made him a formidable oppon-ent in forensic debate.
</p>
<p>THOMAS B. HUDSON. 1 93
</p>
<p>He was also good at repartee, and not deficient in good old
</p>
<p>mother-wit.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson was at one time the law-partner of James B.
</p>
<p>Bowlin, and, at a later period, of James S. Thomas. They
</p>
<p>did a very large business, particularly in reference to boating
</p>
<p>and maritime contracts. We had no railroad connection
</p>
<p>then with the South, and had to rely almost exclusively upon
</p>
<p>boats for transportation. This gave rise in our courts, both
</p>
<p>Federal and state, to a large amount of litigation ; for under
</p>
<p>our law the employees of the boats, and all who furnished
</p>
<p>materials, had a lien upon the boat, and, to enforce the lien,
</p>
<p>had to go into the courts. Mr. Hudson had given this
</p>
<p>branch of business special attention, and had the credit of
</p>
<p>being the best maritime lawyer at the bar.
</p>
<p>In 1840 the country was brought to the highest state of
</p>
<p>excitement, growing out of the presidential contest between
</p>
<p>Harrison and Van Buren. Mr. Hudson was a Democratic
</p>
<p>candidate for the Legislature, and addressed the people at
</p>
<p>Creve Cceur Lake. It was a day for a general discussion, and
</p>
<p>all the candidates were present, and many delivered
</p>
<p>addresses. A disturbance at the meeting came very near
</p>
<p>resulting in a general row, and a writer in the Missouri
</p>
<p>Democrat, over the signature of " Veritas," undertook to
</p>
<p>assign the cause of it. This brought out a reply from Ves-
</p>
<p>pasian Ellis in the Missouri Republicaii, and on the day of
</p>
<p>its publication a paragraph appeared in the editorial col-
</p>
<p>umn, calling attention to Mr. Ellis' letter, and virtually charg-
</p>
<p>ing Mr, Hudson with being the author of " Veritas," and
</p>
<p>containing other matters that were deemed by Mr. Hudson
</p>
<p>offensive. He immediately challenged Colonel A. B. Cham-
</p>
<p>bers, who was editor and proprietor of the Republican, and
</p>
<p>the parties met and exchanged three shots on Bloody Island,
</p>
<p>on July 17, 1840. To properly understand the subject-mat-
</p>
<p>ter of the controversy we give the editorial which appeared

<p>on the 13th :
</p>
<p>" We invite the reader's attention to the communication of Mr. Ellis in to-
</p>
<p>day's paper, giving an account of the proceedings at Creve Coeur Lake meet-
</p>
<p>ing.
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>194 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>"We have the words of several gentlemen, and some of them Loco-focos,
</p>
<p>saying that a more disgraceful and imbecoming proceeding has not transpired
</p>
<p>during the canvass than this was. We particularly invite the attention of the
</p>
<p>author of 'Veritas,' reputed to be the 'bold and fearless Mr. Hudson,' to
</p>
<p>this communication.
</p>
<p>"As to the authorship of 'Veritas' but one opinion prevails in the com-
</p>
<p>munity, and that is that, in this as many other cases, this fellow is the trum.
</p>
<p>peter of his own 'bold and fearless' character.
</p>
<p>" If he did not write it, he at least furnished the materials for it. No one but
</p>
<p>himself would ever think of applying such terms to him."
</p>
<p>It will be seen that this paragraph not only contained an
</p>
<p>imputation upon Mr. Hudson's courage, but charged him
</p>
<p>with giving publicity to a false statement as to what occurred
</p>
<p>at the meeting. Colonel Chambers was evidently mistaken,
</p>
<p>not only as to the authorship of " Veritas," but as to the
</p>
<p>courage of Mr. Hudson, for a cooler and braver man never
</p>
<p>shouldered a musket.
</p>
<p>The reader must not conclude from the promptness with
</p>
<p>which this challenge was sent that Captain Hudson was a
</p>
<p>duehst, or favored that method of settling personal contro-
</p>
<p>versies ; for at that day the custom was sanctioned by long
</p>
<p>usage and a perverted public opinion ; and no young man,
</p>
<p>particularly if he belonged to the profession of the law, could
</p>
<p>live in this country without acknowledging its obligation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson was attended on the field by Charles Bent
</p>
<p>and John H. Watson, and Colonel Chambers by Martin
</p>
<p>Thomas and W. Gordon. The choice of ground and the
</p>
<p>privilege of giving the word was won by Mr. Gordon. They
</p>
<p>fought with rifles, at forty paces ; exchanged three shots
</p>
<p>without effect, and by the interference of friends the diffi-
</p>

<p>ing. We are happy to state that from that day Colonel
</p>
<p>Chambers and Captain Hudson were life-long friends. The
</p>
<p>attendants at the duel published a card complimenting both
</p>
<p>parties for their coolness and bravery.
</p>
<p>The election of 1844 was one of the most exciting ever
</p>
<p>THOMAS B. HUDSON. 1 95
</p>
<p>witnessed in Missouri. The Democratic party for the first
</p>
<p>time became divided  one wing adhering to Colonel Benton,
</p>
<p>and adopting his views upon the slavery question and the
</p>
<p>currency. They took the name of " Hards." The other
</p>
<p>took strong pro-slavery ground, and espoused the policy of
</p>
<p>Mr. Calhoun, taking the name of " Softs." Each wing
</p>
<p>brought a ticket into the field. The Whig party declined to
</p>
<p>make nominations, but quietly threw their votes to the anti-
</p>
<p>Benton party, hoping thereby to widen the breach and
</p>
<p>secure their own ascendency at a subsequent election.
</p>
<p>Captain Hudson and Leonard H. Sims were the anti-Ben-
</p>
<p>ton candidates for Congress, and canvassed the entire state;
</p>
<p>for at that time we had not abandoned the general-ticket
</p>
<p>system. The canvass was very spirited, and conducted with
</p>
<p>much ability on the part of Mr. Hudson. About ten days
</p>
<p>before the election Mr. Parsons, of Pike County, one of the
</p>
<p>Benton nominees, died ; and as we were then without any tel-
</p>
<p>egraphic communication with the remote Democratic coun-
</p>
<p>ties, the information did not reach there in time to secure
</p>
<p>their vote for the party substituted for Parsons. This ren-
</p>
<p>dered it certain that either Hudson or Sims would be elected,
</p>
<p>and as Captain Hudson was much the strongest man, it was
</p>
<p>generally conceded that the honor would fall upon him.
</p>
<p>Sims was clearly of that opinion, and not wishing to be left
</p>
<p>at home without company, suggested to the captain, as he
</p>
<p>did not think it Avould confer any honor upon either of them
</p>
<p>to go to Washington in a dead man's shoes, that the lucky
</p>
<p>one should decline. In this view Captain Hudson acquiesced,
</p>
<p>for he had already determined, and so informed his friends,
</p>
<p>that unless the returns showed that his election would have
</p>
<p>been secured without the death of Parsons, he would not ac-
</p>
<p>cept the certificate of election. To the surprise of all, Sims
</p>
<p>was elected ; for Captain Hudson had given the Whigs of St.
</p>
<p>Louis and the adjoining counties too many castigations upon

</p>
<p>the stump to secure their undivided vote. When the time
</p>
<p>approached for the assembling of the new Congress, Sims
</p>
<p>(who lived in Greene County), whose memory had become
</p>
<p>too treacherous to enable him to recall the understanding

</p>
<p>between Captain Hudson and himself, quietly pocketed his
</p>
<p>certificate and left for Washington City. He did not forget,
</p>
<p>however, to draw his mileage and per-dieni, and that was
</p>
<p>about the only thing he did during the two years he was in
</p>
<p>Congress.
</p>
<p>Upon the breaking out of the Mexican War, Captain Hud-
</p>
<p>son raised and equipped a cavalry company for General
</p>
<p>Doniphan's regiment, and was unanimously elected its cap-
</p>
<p>tain. This was one of the finest companies mustered into
</p>
<p>service, and accompanied Doniphan in his march to Chi-
</p>
<p>huahua  a march second only in modern historical impor-
</p>
<p>tance to Sherman's great march to the sea. Captain Hudson
</p>
<p>shared in all the danger and glory of that brilliant cam-
</p>
<p>paign, and proved himself a most gallant soldier.
</p>
<p>In 1844 he married Miss Eliza Chambers, daughter of
</p>
<p>Charles Chambers, Esq., and granddaughter, on the maternal
</p>
<p>side, of John Mullanphy. We knew her fiither well. He
</p>
<p>was an educated, high-bred, polished Irish gentleman, and
</p>
<p>for many }'ears dispensed the most liberal hospitality at his
</p>
<p>beautiful country residence in Florissant.
</p>
<p>About 1854 Captain Hudson's health began to fail, and
</p>
<p>he was advised by his physician to give up his practice alto-
</p>
<p>gether, and retire to the country. This he did, and spent
</p>
<p>the balance of his days at his country seat, "Glen Owen," in
</p>
<p>the beautiful valley of Florissant, about ten miles north of
</p>
<p>St. Louis. He there devoted himself to agricultural pur-
</p>
<p>suits, for which he had always manifested a fondness. He
</p>
<p>took an active part in the establishment and organization of
</p>
<p>our agricultural and mechanical fairs, which have not been
</p>
<p>excelled, if equalled, by any other part of the United States.
</p>
<p>He was one of the first directors, and contributed largely in
</p>
<p>time, talents, and money. He took great delight in fine
</p>
<p>stock, was a most excellent judge of horses and cattle, and
</p>
<p>a liberal patron of the turf as one of the means of stimulat-

<p>ing our farmers to laudable exertions in that behalf.
</p>
<p>Captain Hudson was a tall, spare-made man, with dark
</p>
<p>hair and eyes, and a very commanding person. No man had
</p>
<p>more personal friends, for he was social and genial in dispo-

</p>
<p>sition, and affable and agreeable in his manners. He always
</p>
<p>met you with a smile and a strong grip of the hand, denot-
</p>
<p>ing his gladness to see you. He had a warm heart, which
</p>
<p>never failed to respond to the calls of charity. He took a
</p>
<p>deep interest in all measures calculated to promote the inter-
</p>
<p>ests of his adopted state, and at one time was president of the
</p>
<p>North Missouri Railroad Company, in which position he de-
</p>
<p>veloped rare administrative capacity. He took a very active
</p>
<p>part in the construction of the Ohio and Mississippi road;
</p>
<p>procured a meeting of the citizens of St. Louis to be held at
</p>
<p>the court-house, at which he offered, and caused to be passed,
</p>
<p>the following resolution :
</p>
<p>'^Resolved, That a committee of seven be appointed by the chairman of
</p>
<p>this meeting, whose duty it shall be to petition the Legislature for the passage
</p>
<p>of a law authorizing the city of St. Louis to subscribe for $500,000 of stock in
</p>
<p>the Ohio & Mississippi Railroad, and that said committee be instructed to use
</p>
<p>all proper exertions to secure the passage of such law."
</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson was placed on the committee, drew the act,
</p>
<p>went to Jefferson City, and by his influence caused its pas-
</p>
<p>sage. The people of St. Louis sanctioned it by a vote at
</p>
<p>the polls, and the subscription contributed largely towards
</p>
<p>the construction of the road.
</p>
<p>Captain Hudson died at home, in the early part of May,
</p>
<p>1867, at the age of fifty-three. His death was not unex-
</p>
<p>pected, for he had been long suffering from debility, and
</p>
<p>weakness of the lungs. Still, it was a great shock to his
</p>
<p>friends, particularly his professional brethren, with whom he
</p>
<p>was always a favorite. They met at the court-house to take
</p>
<p>action with reference to the loss sustained by the bar in his
</p>
<p>death, and paid a feeling tribute to his memory.
</p>
<p>The MissoJiri Republican, the leading Whig paper of Mis-
</p>

</p>
<p>ically, thus announced his death :

<p>tively early age, is the occasion of much regret to a widely-extended circle of
</p>
<p>friends, who hold his memory in esteem as recalling much of personal worth,
</p>
<p>and many agreeable social qualities. Mr. Hudson commenced the practice of

<p>his profession as a lawyer in this cily, about tliirty years ago, and practiced
</p>
<p>with ability and success. An active politician, he was for some years among
</p>
<p>the prominent members and leaders of the Democratic party in Missouri. As
</p>
<p>a representative of St. Louis County in the Legislature he distinguished him-
</p>
<p>self as one of the most inlluential of its members. At one time he was presi-
</p>
<p>dent of the North Missouri Railroad Company. Latterly he had retired from
</p>
<p>the more public sphere in which he formerly moved, and devoted his time to
</p>
<p>the improvement of a handsome estate, and the pursuits of agriculture, at his

<p>home in the county, not far from St. Louis."
</p>
<p>Horatio cozens.
</p>
<p>Of the early life, birth, and education of this promising
</p>
<p>young lawyer there is no one living who is able to give any
</p>
<p>information. He came from Virginia to Missouri soon after
</p>
<p>the organization of our state government, and commenced the
</p>
<p>practice of the law in St. Louis. He had received a good
</p>
<p>academic education, and soon attracted the attention of the
</p>
<p>people by his good address and fine oratorical powers. At
</p>
<p>that time most of the litigation was conducted before magis-
</p>
<p>trates, and Mr. Cozens enjoyed a large practice in those
</p>
<p>courts. He was a ready, fluent, and attractive speaker, and
</p>
<p>was considered the most promising young advocate at the
</p>
<p>bar. There are a few of his contemporaries still living, and
</p>
<p>they represent him as a natural orator, and before a jury al-
</p>
<p>most invincible  in fact, no lawyer at the bar was thought
</p>
<p>to excel him in fervid and impassioned eloquence.
</p>
<p>When only about twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age
</p>
<p>he was involved in a personal difficulty with a lawyer by the
</p>
<p>name of George F. Strother, a dissipated and unprincipled
</p>
<p>man. Strother had a nephew named French Strother, also
</p>
<p>a young lawyer, and he undertook to vindicate his uncle.
</p>
<p>It was supposed that the matter in controversy grew out of
</p>
<p>some political misunderstanding. While Mr. Cozens was
</p>
<p>engaged in the trial of a cause before a justice of the peace
</p>
<p>by the name of Penrose, whose office was on Elm Street, be-
</p>
<p>tween Main and Second, French Strother entered the court-
</p>
<p>room, and indicated to Mr. Cozens, by signs, that he wished
</p>
<p>an interview with him. Mr. Cozens went out on the side-
</p>
<p>walk, and Strother immediately approached him, and, with a
</p>
<p>long dirk-knife, stabbed him to the heart. He died within
</p>
<p>a few minutes. It was a cold-blooded, unprovoked murder,
</p>
<p>and it was with the utmost difficulty that the officers who

<p>arrested Strother could save him from the immediate ven-

</p>
<p>geanee of the people. The murderer was taken before Peter
</p>
<p>Jolinson, ;i magistrate, and committed to jail to await the
</p>
<p>action of the grand jury. He soon, however, broke jail,
</p>
<p>escaped to Mexico, were he led a most dissipated life, and
</p>
<p>finally died at Matamoras with mania a potii. Thus, with-
</p>
<p>out a moment's warning, was this young and promising ad-
</p>
<p>vocate sent into the presence of his Maker. He left a wife

<p>and two or three children to mourn his loss.
</p>
<p>Edwin G. Pratte.
</p>
<p>We saw this gentleman for the first time at Pahnyra, in
</p>
<p>Marion County, in 1848. He was born and educated, and
</p>
<p>studied law, in the state of New York, and settled at Palmyra
</p>
<p>about 1833. His education was classical, and his knowledge
</p>
<p>of the law very profound, but as a practitioner at the bar he
</p>
<p>was neither brilliant nor attractive. He was about six feet
</p>
<p>high, with dark hair and complexion, and a large head, with
</p>
<p>a broad and expansive forehead. He was one of the earliest
</p>
<p>of the Marion lawyers, Benjamin Clark and John Anderson
</p>
<p>having preceded him. Mr. Pratte was a man of moral and
</p>
<p>studious habits, and wholly devoted to his profession.
</p>
<p>Though fluent, he was not an attractive or pleasant speaker,
</p>
<p>but greatly excelled in his knowledge of special pleading.
</p>
<p>His faithfulness to his client and his close attention to busi-
</p>
<p>ness gave him a fair practice. He neither held nor sought
</p>
<p>public office, but had the reputation of being a good political
</p>
<p>essayist. He wrote largely for the Palmyra Courier, a caustic
</p>
<p>and ably-conducted Whig paper which had a large circula-
</p>
<p>tion in north-eastern Missouri.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pratte was in some respects eccentric, and in address-
</p>
<p>ing a jury always commenced with some quaint and odd
</p>
<p>remark which invariably produced merriment in his audience.
</p>
<p>Upon one occasion he was appointed by the court to defend
</p>
<p>a negro woman charged with larceny. She was a most dis-
</p>
<p>agreeble specimen of the African race  very dark, and
</p>
<p>slovenly and dirty in her person. The day of the trial was
</p>
<p>exceedingly warm, and, occupying a seat between her coun-
</p>
<p>sel and the jury, she was very offensive to the nasal organs
</p>
<p>of both. Mr. Pratte opened his speech by saying :
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen of the jury, you have learned by this time

</p>
<p>Mr. Pratte married a Miss Wright, sister of Major Uriel
</p>
<p>Wright. But one child was born of the marriage. Mr.
</p>
<p>Pratte died in Knox County two or three years ago, leaving
</p>
<p>a widow and son to mourn his loss. He was a good-hearted
</p>
<p>man, and of unquestionable integrity. He had read a great

<p>deal, and his mind was well stored with varied learning.
</p>
<p>Silas Bent.
</p>
<p>Of the early inhabitants of St. Louis there are none Hving
</p>
<p>who do not recollect Judge Silas Bent, who was not only an
</p>
<p>influential and prominent man of the territory of Upper
</p>
<p>Louisiana, but for many years was a judge of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of Missouri Territory, and a lawyer of eminence and
</p>
<p>ability. He came from good old Revolutionary stock, for
</p>
<p>his father, Silas Bent, who was born in Ludbury, Massachu-
</p>
<p>setts, in 1744, and educated at Cambridge College, was com-
</p>
<p>mander of the " Tea Party Regiment " of Boston, and was
</p>
<p>one of the disguised men who threw the tea overboard from
</p>
<p>the British ships in Boston harbor. He had seven chil-
</p>
<p>dren, the eldest of whom, the subject of this sketch, was born
</p>
<p>in Massachusetts, April 4, 1768, and educated at Rutland,
</p>
<p>Worcester County, Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>In 1788 he came to Ohio, and was one of the earliest set-
</p>
<p>tlers of Marietta, where he purchased a home for his parents,
</p>
<p>who shortly afterwards moved to it. He then studied law
</p>
<p>under Philip Dodridge, at Wheeling, Virginia. After com-
</p>
<p>pleting his studies, he concluded to embark in mercantile
</p>
<p>pursuits, and opened a store at Charleston, Virginia, and
</p>
<p>soon after married Miss Martha Kerr, who resided near
</p>
<p>Winchester.
</p>
<p>In January, 1802, he was made postmaster at Brooke
</p>
<p>Court-house, Virginia, and in 1803 became a deputy in the
</p>
<p>office of Rufus Putnam, who was surveyor-general. On
</p>
<p>February 17, 1804, he was commissioned as associate judge
</p>
<p>of the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County,
</p>
<p>Ohio, by Governor Edward Tiffin. Li July, 1805, he be-
</p>
<p>came deputy surveyor under James Mainfield, who was sur-
</p>
<p>veyor-general. In July, 1806, he was appointed by the sec-
</p>
<p>retary of the treasury of the United States, Albert Gallatin,

<p>204 BENCH AND BAR OF I\flSSOrrRL
</p>
<p>was ordered to St. Louis, which place he reached on Sep-
</p>
<p>tember 17, 1806. On August 20, 1807, he was appointed
</p>
<p>by Frederick Bates (the secretary and acting governor of
</p>
<p>Louisiana) " first judge of the Court of Common Pleas and
</p>
<p>the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace for the District
</p>
<p>of St. Louis." In November, 1808, he was appointed, by
</p>
<p>Governor Merriweather Lewis, auditor of public accounts for
</p>
<p>the district of St. Louis. On November 9, 1809, he was made
</p>
<p>presiding judge of the St. Louis Court of Common Pleas,
</p>
<p>with Bernard Pratte and Lewis Lebaum as associates; and on
</p>
<p>that day signed the first charter for the town of St. Louis
</p>
<p>On January 5, 181 1, Frederick Bates, who was then secretary
</p>
<p>and acting governor, appointed him auditor of public ac-
</p>
<p>counts, and in September following he was commissioned
</p>
<p>judge of the Court of Common Pleas and Quarter Sessions,
</p>
<p>by Governor Benjamin Howard. On P'ebruary 21, 181 3,
</p>
<p>President Madison commissioned him as judge of the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court of Missouri Territory, and on January 21, 18 17,
</p>
<p>he was recommissioned as such by President Monroe, and
</p>
<p>held the office until it was abolished by the admission of
</p>
<p>Missouri into the Union, in 1 82 1.
</p>
<p>Upon the admission of the state he was appointed clerk of
</p>
<p>the St. Louis County Court, which, in addition to county
</p>
<p>business, exercised probate jurisdiction. Colonel Bent held
</p>
<p>this office some time, and until his death, which occurred on
</p>
<p>November 20, 1827, at his country residence, just north of
</p>
<p>the St. Louis Arsenal. He died in the sixtieth year of his age.
</p>
<p>He left seven children, the eldest of whom, Charles Bent,
</p>
<p>became governor of New Mexico, and was killed while gov-
</p>
<p>ernor, January 19, 1847. His second child, Julianna, married
</p>
<p>Governor Lilburn W. Boggs, and died in 1820. His third
</p>
<p>child, John Bent, became a noted lawyer in St. Louis, and
</p>
<p>died May 18, 1845. Dorcas, his fifth child, married Judge
</p>
<p>William C. Carr, and she is still living. His youngest son.

</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that almost the entire life of Judge
</p>
<p>Bent was spent in the public service, and the fact that no
</p>
<p>complaint was ever made against the manner in which he
</p>
<p>discharged these numerous and responsible trusts furnishes
</p>
<p>the best evidence of his marked ability and incorruptible
</p>
<p>integrity.
</p>
<p>He was not only an able jurist, but a man of varied and
</p>
<p>extensive information  just such a man as the government
</p>
<p>needed in the early settlement of the West. In early times
</p>
<p>it required months for any communication to pass between
</p>
<p>the government and its officials ; hence our public men had
</p>
<p>frequently to act without instructions, relying altogether upon
</p>
<p>their own judgment and sense of propriety. A man of Judge
</p>
<p>Bent's fine executive and administrative powers was too much
</p>
<p>needed to permit him to remain in private life ; hence we find
</p>
<p>him many years on the bench, and at other times discharg-
</p>
<p>ing the duties of United States surveyor  a most onerous
</p>
<p>position in the West, where the public domain had to be sub-
</p>
<p>divided for settlement and sale, to say nothing of the con-
</p>
<p>flicting claims growing out of Spanish concessions and the
</p>
<p>imperfect surveys thereunder.
</p>
<p>Judge Bent's life was one of great usefulness, and we who
</p>
<p>are now reaping the benefits of his labors should not permit
</p>
<p>his memory to pass away without at least this tribute to his
</p>
<p>worth.
</p>
<p>The proverbial honesty of our early public servants is a
</p>
<p>pleasant theme, in these days of degeneracy, for contempla-
</p>
<p>tion. Then dishonesty was an exception to the rule, and the
</p>
<p>official was content with the salary attached to his office,
</p>
<p>and he knew nothing of outside perquisites or inside steal-
</p>
<p>ings. But now, if he has the opportunity and fails to steal
</p>
<p>enough to start a bank or build a railroad, he is regarded as
</p>
<p>deficient in mental resources. Our government is but a cen-
</p>
<p>tury old ; yet we have made that progress in corruption

<p>Through the kindness of Judge Bent's son, Captahi Silas
</p>
<p>Bent, we are enabled to lay before our readers several letters
</p>
<p>and ancient documents which the judge left at his death,

<p>of his life in our midst.

</p>
<p>When he took possession, in 1806, of the surveyor-gener-
</p>
<p>al's office at St. Louis, he found everything in a state of the
</p>
<p>utmost derangement, as will appear from the following letter
</p>
<p>addressed by him to the department at Washington :
</p>
<p>" St. Louis, Sept. 22, 1806.
</p>
<p>"J. Mainfield
</p>
<p>" Surveyor Genl
</p>
<p>"Sir I arrived at this place on the 17th of this month, called on Mr. Soulard
</p>
<p>on the same day and demanded the records of survey, and all documents relative
</p>
<p>thereto for the territory. He informed me through an interpreter that none were
</p>
<p>in his possession  that he had delivered them over to the commissioners early
</p>
<p>the next morning (the i8th). I inquired for Judge Lucas at his house, as he
</p>
<p>was the only" commissioner then in town, but could not see him. I left my
</p>
<p>name, and stated my office  in the afternoon I heard that the commissioners
</p>
<p>were sitting, and addressed to them a note formally announcing my arrival and
</p>
<p>the office I held, which I delivered to their clerk at the Board. They examined
</p>
<p>my credentials and returned them without observation. On the 19th I called on
</p>
<p>them again for the records &c.  they said they would make some order on that
</p>
<p>subject, and direct their clerk to deliver to me such of them as they could dis-
</p>
<p>pense with.
</p>
<p>' I have called on the clerk regularly every day for such books records or
</p>
<p>papers as the Board of Commissioners had ordered delivered to me, but he
</p>
<p>has not been at leisure until this morning to attend to that business. He then
</p>
<p>delivered to me 10 books containing records or plats of survey principally
</p>
<p>in the French language  those which purported to have been kept under
</p>
<p>the Spanish government wore the appearance at first blush of accuracy
</p>
<p>except some confusion, and apparent alterations in the dates &c.  those
</p>
<p>kept since, though attempted to be in English, I can understand much less
</p>
<p>about  there are no field notes or documents of any kind accompanying
</p>
<p>them. The commissioners have in conversation informed me that they were
</p>
<p>about closing their business  that they believed some orders for surveying had
</p>
<p>been made by them, and that their clerk would inform me, but the clerk says
</p>
<p>there are no such orders entered by him. This affords but a dark prospect for
</p>
<p>my young family.

<p>Judge Bent went to work, and with labor and persever-
</p>
<p>ance brought order out of chaos ; and when he left the office
</p>
<p>everything was in perfect condition.
</p>
<p>In a letter addressed by him to the department, bearing
</p>
<p>date September 28, 1806, he thus alludes to the return of

</p>
<p>On June 14, 1807, Governor Frederick Bates issued the

</p>
<p>Charles H. Allen.
</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable and eccentric men connected
</p>
<p>with the early bar and judiciary of our state was Charles H.
</p>
<p>Allen, better known as " Horse " Allen.
</p>
<p>He was born and educated in Kentucky, and came to Mis-
</p>
<p>souri in 1830, when quite a young man, and settled in Pal-
</p>
<p>myra. Of his early life but very little is known, for in
</p>
<p>respect to it he was very reticent, and would permit no one
</p>
<p>to interrogate him in relation to his age. His educational
</p>
<p>advantages were certainly very limited, and he never im-
</p>
<p>proved himself much by study, for he had but little relish
</p>
<p>for books, and his knowledge of the law was very superficial.
</p>
<p>He practiced in Kentucky several years before coming
</p>
<p>to Missouri, and there acquired the sobriqjiet of "Horse"
</p>
<p>Allen. As to how he obtained this title there are several
</p>
<p>versions, the most reasonable of which we give: He was a
</p>
<p>loud, blustering declaimer, and upon one occasion was em-
</p>
<p>ployed in a case before a justice of the peace in Kentucky,
</p>
<p>and while addressing the jury an old man in the audience,
</p>
<p>intoxicated, cried out, " Go it, old horse." Allen imme-
</p>
<p>diately responded with the declaration, " Yes, I am a whole
</p>
<p>horse, and half alligator at that." From that day he was
</p>
<p>christened " Horse," and was universally so called till the
</p>
<p>day of his death.
</p>
<p>He was a fine declaimer, and most excellent stump-
</p>
<p>speaker, and was selected by the people of Marion County
</p>
<p>to represent them in the State Legislature.
</p>
<p>In 1835 he was appointed judge of the Benton Circuit, in
</p>
<p>south-western Missouri, but, disregarding the constitutional
</p>
<p>provision which required a circuit judge to reside within the
</p>
<p>limits of his circuit, he continued to live with his family in
</p>
<p>Palmyra. This brought upon him severe attacks from the

</p>
<p>press, but he was proof against newspaper criticism.
</p>
<p>CHARLES H. ALLEN. 211
</p>
<p>After Lilburn W. Boggs was installed into the office of
</p>
<p>governor, he promised Judge Allen to give him the Palmyra
</p>
<p>Circuit, one of the most important circuits in the state.
</p>
<p>The promise was no doubt made upon the representation
</p>
<p>that he would be acceptable to the bar and people of that
</p>
<p>circuit ; but upon the assembling of the Legislature the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor found that the entire bar was opposed to him, and tlie
</p>
<p>people almost unanimously remonstrated against his appoint-
</p>
<p>ment. The governor, therefore, was precluded from fulfill-
</p>
<p>ing his promise, but sent his name into the Senate for his
</p>
<p>old circuit, and he was immediately confirmed. The judge
</p>
<p>was in Jefferson City at the time, and, on learning the dis-
</p>
<p>position that had been made of him, became furious ; and,
</p>
<p>half intoxicated with liquor, repaired to the executive man-
</p>
<p>sion, and, standing on the sidewalk, cursed the governor up
</p>
<p>and down, denouncing him in the strongest language he was
</p>
<p>capable of, until quite a crowd gathered round him, when he
</p>
<p>was arrested by the authorities for disturbing the public
</p>
<p>peace. As soon as the Senate became informed of his con-
</p>
<p>duct they rescinded his nomination, and unanimously re-
</p>
<p>jected him.
</p>
<p>A few years afterwards he was again appointed to the Ben-
</p>
<p>ton Circuit, and we met him for the first time in Waynesville,
</p>
<p>Pulaski County, about 1842, where he was holding a term
</p>
<p>of his court. He traveled on horseback from Palmyra to
</p>
<p>his circuit, at least 200 miles ; and around the circuit,
</p>
<p>about 800 more. This he did three times a year, spend-
</p>
<p>ing nearly his whole time in the saddle. He was, how-
</p>
<p>ever, a strong, robust man, and capable of the greatest en-
</p>
<p>durance. He always traveled with a holster of large pistols
</p>
<p>in front of his saddle, and a knife with a blade at least a foot
</p>
<p>long. But for his dress a stranger might have readily taken
</p>
<p>him for a cavjilry officer.
</p>
<p>He was a man of strong natural abilities, but his mind

</p>
<p>was wholly uncultivated ; nevertheless he might have suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded very well but for his oddities and eccentricities,
</p>
<p>which were constantly making Inm the butt of ridicule. In
</p>
<p>charging a grand jury he made a regular stump speech, and
</p>
<p>212 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURT.
</p>
<p>became so violent in liis declamation tliat it was dangerous
</p>
<p>to come within reach of him.
</p>
<p>In those days it was common for people to settle their
</p>
<p>personal quarrels during court week. Three or four fights a
</p>
<p>day were not uncommon ; a ring was formed, seconds chosen,
</p>
<p>and the combatants, stripped to the waist, would enter the
</p>
<p>ring, shake hands, and go at it. Judge Allen took great de-
</p>
<p>light in these exhibitions, and would adjourn his court at any
</p>
<p>time to witness one. No Spaniard ever enjoyed a bull-fight
</p>
<p>more than he did these personal rencounters. Though by
</p>
<p>law a conservator of the peace, he deemed the peace bet-
</p>
<p>ter preserved by letting them fight it out.
</p>
<p>In 1844 a portion of the Democratic party in the state
</p>
<p>became disaffected, and were known by the appellation of
</p>
<p>" Softs." They rebelled against the regular Democratic
</p>
<p>nomination, and ran an independent ticket, expecting the
</p>
<p>aid of the Whig party. Judge Allen, though he had been
</p>
<p>up to that time a consistent Democrat, announced himself as
</p>
<p>an independent candidate for governor. The Whig party
</p>
<p>declined to make any nominations, and threw their entire
</p>
<p>vote upon the independent ticket. The judge made a bold
</p>
<p>and vigorous canvass ; and by a combination of circum-
</p>
<p>stances came very near being elected  in fact, if the elec-
</p>
<p>tion had taken place a month in advance of the time
</p>
<p>appointed by law, his election would have been assured.
</p>
<p>He had agreed with Judge Edwards, the Democratic nom-
</p>
<p>inee, to open the canvass at Waynesville on a specified day.
</p>
<p>Both appeared on the day before, and Edwards was sud-
</p>
<p>denly taken down with an attack of bilious fever, and had
</p>
<p>to be conveyed back to his residence in Cole County. This
</p>
<p>left the whole field to Allen, and his friends adroitly spread
</p>
<p>the report that Edwards was afraid to meet him. Allen's
</p>
<p>circuit was the strongest Democratic portion of the state,
</p>
<p>and this unfortunate occurrence had a most demoralizing

<p>effect upon the prospects oi the Democratic cause. The
</p>
<p>first day of the Circuit Court at Steelsville, in Crawford
</p>
<p>County, was fixed upon as the time and place for the second
</p>
<p>meeting. Though a candidate for the Legislature from
</p>
<p>CHARLES II. ALLEN. 213
</p>
<p>Franklin County, we repaired to Steelsville, at the urgent
</p>
<p>solicitation of the leading Democrats of that section, to meet
</p>
<p>Judge Allen in debate; and the scene that there followed
</p>
<p>no language can faithfully portray. The court-room was
</p>
<p>crowded to suffocation, and the judge commenced his speech
</p>
<p>about eleven o'clock, or immediately after charging the grand
</p>
<p>jury  for Crawford County was in his circuit. He spoke
</p>
<p>about two hours, and at the conclusion a general call was
</p>
<p>made upon us to reply. It is proper here to state that before
</p>
<p>opening his court the judge approached us to ascertain if
</p>
<p>we intended to reply to him. On learning that such was
</p>
<p>our conclusion, he remonstrated against it, and stated that
</p>
<p>he did not think we ought to interfere in the fight. We
</p>
<p>replied that we felt no disposition to do him any harm, nor
</p>
<p>had we any personal feeling in the matter, but the welfare
</p>
<p>of the entire Democratic party was at stake, and if he suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded it would throw the state ultimately in the hands of
</p>
<p>the Whigs. He replied that the Democrats had selected
</p>
<p>Judge Edwards as their standard-bearer, and it was his
</p>
<p>business to meet him, and not ours. We commenced speak-
</p>
<p>ing about one o'clock, the judge sitting near us on the
</p>
<p>bench. After speaking about an hour, we undertook to
</p>
<p>show that the "Softs" were coalescing with the Whigs, and
</p>
<p>the defeat of the Democratic party could only inure to the
</p>
<p>benefit of our old and common enemy; that if the indepen-
</p>
<p>dent movement was successful, the state would pass into the
</p>
<p>hands of the Whigs, who would then eschew both wings of
</p>
<p>the Democratic party. The judge saw that our line of argu-
</p>
<p>ment was producing a decided effect upon the audience, and
</p>
<p>without any previous intimation to us, and in a most discour-
</p>
<p>teous manner, cried out, " Sheriff, open court." At this
</p>
<p>unwarrantable interruption the crowd became greatly
</p>
<p>incensed, and adjourned to a wood-pile, where we finished
</p>
<p>our speech. Nothing could have tended more to unite the

<p>Democrats of Crawford County than Judge Allen's conduct
</p>
<p>on this occasion. That it did have that effect is evident
</p>
<p>from the large majority that Edwards received in that
</p>
<p>county. We did not see Allen again during the canvass.

</p>
<p>but the second sober thought seized the minds of the Dem-
</p>
<p>ocrats, and the state was saved by about 5,000 majority.
</p>
<p>Judge Allen died in Palmyra in 1862, leaving a wife and
</p>
<p>several children. It is said by those who knew him inti-
</p>
<p>mately that he had generous impulses, and was capable of
</p>
<p>strong attachments.
</p>
<p>During the gubernatorial canvass Judge Allen made a
</p>
<p>speech at Bowling Green, Pike County, where lived a law-
</p>
<p>yer by the same name. He was introduced to the judge,
</p>
<p>and while shaking hands remarked, "They call you ' Horse'
</p>
<p>Allen; I reckon I must be the colt," and from that time
</p>
<p>he was dubbed "Colt" Allen, and never got rid of the name.
</p>
<p>It not unfrequently happens that a very trifling incident
</p>
<p>attaches to a man a name which he is incapable of throwing
</p>
<p>off. In one of the north-eastern counties. Pike or Marion,
</p>
<p>there settled at an early period a young lawyer who was in
</p>
<p>the habit of practicing in justices' courts. On one occasion
</p>
<p>he was employed to defend a man in a civil suit in the county,
</p>
<p>in which the litigants were farmers, and walked ten miles to
</p>
<p>the place. The plaintiff had retained no attorney, not sup-
</p>
<p>posing that the defendant would have one, so he was forced
</p>
<p>to appear in his own behalf. The defendant's attorney, after

<p>the evidence closed, made a long speech, and quite an able

<p>one, for he was a good talker. After he closed, the plaintiff

<p>of this debt; he has tried to szveai'WiO. out of this debt; and

</p>
<p>attorney, who was exceedingly hard featured] to ugly

<p>Peter t. abell
</p>
<p>Was for a number of years a practicing lawyer in Bruns-
</p>
<p>wick, Chariton County, Missouri, and was a partner of
</p>
<p>General B. F. Stringfellow, one of the most eminent law-
</p>
<p>yers of the state.
</p>
<p>Mr. Abell encountered many difficulties through life, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly his early life, which to one of less energy and will
</p>
<p>would have proved very disheartening. He was a native of
</p>
<p>Kentucky, and born in Beardstown, July 29, 181 3, and while
</p>
<p>an infant became an orphan. He received the chief part of his
</p>
<p>education from Father Robert Abell, a Catholic priest, but
</p>
<p>while in college, at the early age of fourteen, he became
</p>
<p>afflicted with some affection of his eyes which compelled
</p>
<p>him to leave college, and for six years he suffered intensely,
</p>
<p>and finally lost the right eye. He was very ambitious to
</p>
<p>obtain a classical education, but for the reason just given
</p>
<p>was unable to do so.
</p>
<p>In June, 1833, he came to Keytesville, Chariton County,
</p>
<p>Missouri, and engaged in merchandising with his cousin, G.
</p>
<p>W. Givens, but soon took a distaste for mercantile life, and
</p>
<p>commenced the study of the law. General Stringfellow was
</p>
<p>kind enough to give him the use of his law library, and he
</p>
<p>studied at home, and, with his habits of industry and fond-
</p>
<p>ness for reading, soon prepared himself for admission to the
</p>
<p>bar, and was licensed to practice. He attended the courts
</p>
<p>of Chariton, Carroll, Linn, Livingston, and one or two
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p>In 1849 he and General Stringfellow formed a partnership
</p>
<p>at Brunswick, and practiced together, doing a large business,
</p>
<p>until in 1853, when Mr. Abell moved to Weston, in Platte
</p>
<p>County, where he remained about two years. Here his
</p>
<p>health began to give way, and under the advice of his phy-

<p>sician he went to Kansas, and settled at Atchison. He soon
</p>
<p>2l6 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>found that his failing health would not admit of a further
</p>
<p>prosecution of his profession, and he became president of the
</p>
<p>company that laid out the town of Atchison. His fine busi-
</p>
<p>ness habits and clear judgment greatly contributed to the
</p>
<p>advancement of the town, and he devoted his entire time and
</p>
<p>great energy to building up and promoting her railroad
</p>
<p>interests. In 1871 he was elected president of the Atchison
</p>
<p>& Nebraska Railroad, which position he occupied until his
</p>
<p>health forced him to abandon business altogether.
</p>
<p>He died in Atchison, on January 16, 1874, in his sixty-first
</p>
<p>year.
</p>
<p>Mr. Abell, notwithstanding the adverse circumstances
</p>
<p>which surrounded him, made himself an excellent lawyer;
</p>
<p>but his field was in his office, and not in the court-room.
</p>
<p>He was a safe and reliable counselor, but had but little
</p>
<p>ability as an advocate  in fact, he made no pretensions to
</p>
<p>oratory, though his speeches were characterized by a large
</p>
<p>amount of good sense, and a thorough knowledge of the
</p>
<p>law. His superior business habits made him a fit partner for
</p>
<p>a lawyer of General Stringfellow's brilliancy.
</p>
<p>We have always heard Mr. Abell spoken of as a kind-
</p>
<p>hearted, generous man, liberal to the poor, and liberal and
</p>
<p>free in his charities generally. His habits were of the most

<p>exemplary kind, and his integrity beyond suspicion.
</p>
<p>ROBERT A. EWING,
</p>
<p>A lawyer of Cole County, Missouri, and father of H. Clay
</p>
<p>Evving, late attorney-general of the state, was born in Rob-
</p>
<p>ertson County, Tennessee, in March, 1792, and when but two
</p>
<p>years of age his father removed to Logan County, Kentucky,
</p>
<p>where Robert was raised. It does not appear that the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of this sketch had any higher educational advantages
</p>
<p>than the common oountry schools of that day afforded. He
</p>
<p>studied law in the office of the Hon. John J. Crittenden, who
</p>
<p>became greatly distinguished as a lawyer and st^Aesman.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing was licensed in Kentucky, but he could not
</p>
<p>have practiced there long, for in 18 19 he came to Missouri
</p>
<p>and settled in Jefferson City, where he continued to practice
</p>
<p>with success until 1837, when he purchased a farm on the
</p>
<p>Missouri River, about six miles below Jefferson City, and
</p>
<p>devoted the balance of his days to agricultural pursuits, for
</p>
<p>which he evinced a fondness at an early period of his life.
</p>
<p>It was in 1837 or 1838 that we first met Mr. Ewing, in Jef-
</p>
<p>ferson City, and found him a most intelligent and agreeable
</p>
<p>gentleman.
</p>
<p>Soon after coming to the state Mr. Ewing married Miss
</p>
<p>Jane Ramsay, a daughter of General Jonathan Ramsay, of
</p>
<p>Callaway County, Missouri, by whom he had a large family
</p>
<p>of children, with several of whom we became well ac-
</p>
<p>quainted. Mr. Ewing had not retired from the practice of
</p>
<p>his profession long before the people of Cole County elected
</p>
<p>him as one of the justices of their County Court, at a time
</p>
<p>when the county was greatly embarrassed in her financial
</p>
<p>condition. When we consider that Judge Ewing was a very
</p>
<p>decided Whig in his politics, and a majority of the people
</p>
<p>were Democratic, his election to so responsible a position,
</p>
<p>under the existing circumstances, was a compliment that

</p>
<p>any man might have been proud of.
</p>
<p>21 8 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Judge Ewing, with the assistance of his associate judges,
</p>
<p>succeeded in reheving the county of her pecuniary embar
</p>
<p>rassment, and then expressed a desire to retire from the
</p>
<p>bench ; but the people had learned to appreciate his valu-
</p>
<p>able services, and continued to reelect him for many years
</p>
<p> in fact, as long as he could be induced to serve them.
</p>
<p>Probably no county in the state was more strongly wedded
</p>
<p>to the Democratic policy than Cole ; but every tax-payer
</p>
<p>felt an interest in the proper management of county af-
</p>
<p>fairs, and they were unwilling to dispense with the valuable
</p>
<p>services of Judge Ewing by reason of a difference in their
</p>
<p>political views. Moreover, he had become very popular, for
</p>
<p>he was exceedingly pleasant and affable in his address, and
</p>
<p>mingled freely with the people, whose confidence in his
</p>
<p>integrity was never diminished.
</p>
<p>Judge Ewing made no effort at forensic display. His chief
</p>
<p>excellence consisted in his fine administrative powers and
</p>
<p>his excellent business capacity, which fitted him for almost
</p>
<p>any public position. He had no ambition for notoriety, but
</p>
<p>was rather disposed to lead a quiet and domestic life ;
</p>
<p>hence, never became a candidate for office.
</p>
<p>His admiration for Kentucky's great statesman, Mr. Clay,
</p>
<p>was unbounded, and he adhered to him long after his polit-
</p>
<p>ical sun had set.
</p>
<p>In private life Judge Ewing was noted for his kindness and
</p>
<p>hospitality, and his death, in 1857, was universally regretted

</p>
<p>BRYAN MULLANPHY.
</p>
<p>The history of the Missouri bar furnishes few names more
</p>
<p>faniihar to the profession than that of Bryan MuUanphy, who
</p>
<p>was born in the city of Baltimore in 1809. His father, John
</p>
<p>MuUanphy, was a native of County Fermanagh, Ireland.
</p>
<p>His mother was Elizabeth Brown, of Youghal, County
</p>
<p>Waterford. They emigrated to America, landing in Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia in 1794, where they remained a short time, and then
</p>
<p>removed to Baltimore.
</p>
<p>In 1798 Mr. MuUanphy came West, and located in Frank-
</p>
<p>fort, Kentucky, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits.
</p>
<p>He built there a large store-house, laid the first pavement in
</p>
<p>that town, and carried on a very successful business. At
</p>
<p>least once a year he traveled on horseback to Baltimore to
</p>
<p>purchase goods, and became one of the most extensive and
</p>
<p>enterprising merchants in the West.
</p>
<p>In 1803 he built a schooner, and sent her, laden with
</p>
<p>produce, to the West Indies, under an experienced captain ;
</p>
<p>but she was finally lost in a gale, and it was supposed that
</p>
<p>all on board perished.
</p>
<p>In 1804 he again changed his residence, and settled in St.
</p>
<p>Louis, which at that time contained a population of about
</p>
<p>1,200, mostly Creole French, there being but two American
</p>
<p>families. It was during this year that George Tompkins,
</p>
<p>John Scott, Rufus Easton, Dr. William Carr Lane, and Ed-
</p>
<p>ward Hempstead came to St. Louis. Mr. MuUanphy spoke
</p>
<p>the French language very fluently, and might readily have
</p>
<p>been taken for a Frenchman. His foresight and sagacity soon
</p>
<p>convinced him that St. Louis was destined to become a large
</p>
<p>commercial city, and he invested all his spare means in real
</p>
<p>estate, which laid the foundation of the largest private for-
</p>
<p>tune that any one ever accumulated west of the Mississippi .

</p>
<p>with the improvements since made upon it, is at this time
</p>
<p>reasonably worth ^20,000,000.
</p>
<p>The facihties in St. Louis for educating his children were
</p>
<p>ver)' limited, and he sent them to Baltimore, to which place
</p>
<p>he removed his family, not, however, intending to abandon
</p>
<p>his residence in St. Louis. His son, Bryan, received his pri-
</p>
<p>mary education in private schools, but was eventually sent to
</p>
<p>Paris, in France, where he remained four years at the Jesuit
</p>
<p>College, in which he obtained a thorough knowledge of the
</p>
<p>French language. From there he was sent to Stonyhurst Col-
</p>
<p>lege, in England, in which institution he graduated with
</p>
<p>honor. At the age of eighteen he returned to the United
</p>
<p>States, and commenced the study of the law in St. Louis. It
</p>
<p>does not appear that he entered the law-office of any attor-
</p>
<p>ney, and the supposition is that he procured all the leading
</p>
<p>elementary works and studied them in his private room.
</p>
<p>Soon after reaching his majority he was licensed to practice.
</p>
<p>Being an only son out of eight children, he became the pride
</p>
<p>of the family, and his father indulged in the fond expecta-
</p>
<p>tion that his son would become a very polished gentleman.
</p>
<p>On his return from Europe, Bryan landed at New Orleans,
</p>
<p>and took passage on a steamer for St. Louis. On reaching
</p>
<p>a point about fifteen miles below the city, the boat was
</p>
<p>prevented from proceeding further by floating ice, and the
</p>
<p>passengers were forced to land and proceed to the city by
</p>
<p>any conveyance they could obtain. At that time we had no
</p>
<p>macadamized roads, and the mud was knee-deep from recent
</p>
<p>rains. Bryan hired a mule, and rode bare-back to the
</p>
<p>city, and when he reached the family residence he was
</p>
<p>covered with mud from head to foot, presenting a most
</p>
<p>deplorable sight. Upon the announcement of his arrival, his
</p>
<p>father came to the door to welcome him home, but instead
</p>
<p>of the polished and fine-appearing gentleman which his long-
</p>
<p>cherished hopes had led him to anticipate, he saw a man

</p>
<p>clothed in mud and mire, and, according to tradition, ex-
</p>
<p>pressed his displeasure and disappointment. It is even said
</p>
<p>that this incident caused him to change his will unfavorably
</p>
<p>to his son.
</p>
<p>BR YAN MULLANPH V. 221
</p>
<p>Bryan had seven sisters, one of whom married General
</p>
<p>Harney, of the United States army. Another became the
</p>
<p>wife of Judge Boyce, of Louisiana  she being a widow at
</p>
<p>the time of this marriage. A third married Major Thomas
</p>
<p>Biddle, of the army. He was a brother of Nick Biddle,
</p>
<p>president of the old United States Bank, and also of Com-
</p>
<p>modore Biddle, of the navy. He was killed in a duel with
</p>
<p>Spencer Pettis. Another sister married Charles Chambers,
</p>
<p>Esq., father of the present proprietor of the St. Louis Daily
</p>
<p>Times. The eldest, who was named Ellen, died in France,
</p>
<p>unmarried. The remaining sister became the wife of James
</p>
<p>Clemens, Jr., an influential merchant of St. Louis.
</p>
<p>They all received from their father large estates, and
</p>
<p>as Br\'an was an only brother, they admitted him to an
</p>
<p>equal share.
</p>
<p>These ladies became noted for their liberal charities, in-
</p>
<p>deed, benevolence and kindness to the poor  particularly the
</p>
<p>destitute orphan  have always been characteristics of the
</p>
<p>Mullanphy family. Mrs. Biddle established and endowed
</p>
<p>several institutions, among the most noted of which is the
</p>
<p>" Biddle Infant Asylum and Widows' Home," founded in
</p>
<p>1853, 3-'"'*^ located on the corner of Tenth and O'Fallon
</p>
<p>Streets. The good that this noble institution has done, and is
</p>
<p>still doing, is incredible. Thousands of abandoned children
</p>
<p>have been received inside of its walls, cared and provided
</p>
<p>for  some but a few days old, some a month, and many be-
</p>
<p>tween one and two years, abandoned by mothers who were
</p>
<p>either unable to maintain them or wished to conceal the dis-
</p>
<p>grace of their birth. A writer in one of the St. Louis papers
</p>
<p>of 1867 thus alludes to the infantile department:
</p>
<p>" It not unfrequently happens that a woman appears at the institution before
</p>
<p>the lady superior, holding a child in her arms, and states that the mother of the
</p>
<p>infant is dead. A glance at the child, and then at the woman, soon reveals the
</p>
<p>fact that the mother is there.

<p>"The lady superior seeing this, without any hesitancy proceeds to take
</p>
<p>the child, remarking, ' You, then, madam, have no further claim upon the
</p>
<p>child.' The mother recoils, hesitates, and then begs, while giving the child
</p>
<p>away, that she may see it again, and be apprised of its condition from time
</p>
<p>to time."

<p>Were it not foreign to the purpose of this work, we might
</p>
<p>refer to other charitable institutions which have had, and are
</p>
<p>still receiving, the fostering care of this family ; but it is to
</p>
<p>be hoped that some one equal to the task will yet furnish the
</p>
<p>public a detailed account of them, and the great benefits they
</p>
<p>are conferring, for it would be an interesting chapter in the
</p>
<p>history of our great city.
</p>
<p>It was stated that John Mullanphy realized a handsome
</p>
<p>fortune from the purchase and sale of the bales of cotton used
</p>
<p>by General Jackson in the defense of New Orleans. After
</p>
<p>the declaration of peace, cotton rose rapidly in value, and the
</p>
<p>foresight of Mr. Mullanphy enabled him to realize a rich re-
</p>
<p>ward from his investment.
</p>
<p>Bryan Mullanphy entered upon the practice of the law un-
</p>
<p>der the most favorable auspices. With a thorough classical
</p>
<p>education and a good legal mind, aided by wealth and fam-
</p>
<p>ily influence, there was nothing to prevent success but ill-
</p>
<p>health or gross inattention to business, neither of which
</p>
<p>could be charged to him, for he was a man of excellent con-
</p>
<p>stitution and studious habits, and manifested a fondness for
</p>
<p>his profession. He not only practiced in all the courts of St.
</p>
<p>Louis, but also in the Circuit Courts of Franklin and St.
</p>
<p>Charles Counties, and occasionally attended the courts of
</p>
<p>Washington and Jefferson Counties.
</p>
<p>We first became acquainted wath him at the Franklin
</p>
<p>Court, in the spring or fall of 1837. He, Edward Bates, and
</p>
<p>Trusten Polk were attending that court, and were engaged
</p>
<p>in several important trials  one, in particular, we recollect
</p>
<p>from an amusing incident that occurred. He and Mr. Polk
</p>
<p>were engaged in the argument of a case before a jury, being
</p>
<p>on opposite sides. Mr. Mullanphy, being for the plaintiff,
</p>
<p>had the concluding argument. It was an exceedingly hot
</p>
<p>day, and the atmosphere of the court-room very oppressive.
</p>
<p>Mr. Polk asked permission of the court to take off his coat,

</p>
<p>which was, of course, granted. When Mr. Mullanphy rose to
</p>
<p>reply, he asked and obtained the same privilege, and in the
</p>
<p>act of removing his coat discovered that he had no shirt on
</p>
<p>but a thin gauze undershirt. He instantly remarked that
</p>
<p>BRYAN MULLANPHY. 223
</p>
<p>he believed he would not avail himself of the indulgence of
</p>
<p>the court, as he had left his shirt in his room at the hotel ;
</p>
<p>and in the midst of a roar of laughter, which he seemed
</p>
<p>greatly to enjoy, began to rebutton his coat. At that time
</p>
<p>he was noted for his carelessness in dress, frequently ap-
</p>
<p>pearing with a boot on one foot and an untied shoe on the
</p>
<p>other, and half the time without a vest.
</p>
<p>A warm friendship then sprang up between Mr. Mullanphy
</p>
<p>and the author, which continued until the death of the for-
</p>
<p>mer. Speaking of Mr. MuUanphy's carelessness in dress re-
</p>
<p>minds us of a witty reply he once made to Mr. Polk, who was
</p>
<p>taking him to task for his slovenliness. " Why," said Polk,
</p>
<p>" I cannot get along with less than three clean shirts a week."
</p>
<p>" Nor could I," said Mr. Mullanphy, "if I was as dirty a fel-
</p>
<p>low as you." It is proper here to remark that Mr. Polk was
</p>
<p>very neat in his person.
</p>
<p>Though not an orator, Mr. Mullanphy was a fine logician,
</p>
<p>and a fluent, ardent, and impressive speaker, and seldom
</p>
<p>failed to rivet the attention of both court and jury. His
</p>
<p>mind was quick and active, and his thoughts flowed so rap-
</p>
<p>idly, one upon the other, that at times it gave his utterance
</p>
<p>the semblance of hesitation. He had just enough of the
</p>
<p>Irish accent to give his voice a pleasant and agreeable
</p>
<p>sound, and, unlike many advocates, seldom indulged in repe-
</p>
<p>tition or useless verbiage. He was thoroughly grounded
</p>
<p>in the principles of the law, and quick to detect the weak
</p>
<p>points of his adversary's case. He wasted no time in the dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of trivial matters. He believed in the legal maxim,
</p>
<p>" Dc iniitimis non curat lex." He was as well versed in the
</p>
<p>civil as in the common law, which gave him a great advan-
</p>
<p>tage in his practice, and proved highly serviceable to him
</p>
<p>when on the bench. He was also a fine belles-lettres
</p>
<p>scholar, and his reading and learning were varied and ex-
</p>
<p>tensive. It was impossible to converse with him on any

<p>subject which had not elicited more or less of his attention.
</p>
<p>In 1840 he was elected to the bench of the St Louis Cir-
</p>
<p>cuit Court, and discharged the arduous and responsible du-
</p>
<p>ties of that office with great ability and fidelity. Some of his

<p>Judge Mullanphy was a very eccentric man, and car-
</p>
<p>ried his eccentricities upon the bench. Upon one occasion,
</p>
<p>when engaged in the trial of a cause, word was brought to
</p>
<p>him that his mother was taken suddenly ill. He immedi-
</p>
<p>ately announced that the cotirf s mother was very sick, and
</p>
<p>directed the sheriff to adjourn the court until the next day.
</p>
<p>At another time he was insulted upon the street by an at-
</p>
<p>torney who took exception to his ruling, when he knocked
</p>
<p>the attorney down with his cane ; and, strange to say, the
</p>
<p>grand jury indicted him for an assault with intent to kill.
</p>
<p>While on the bench the fact was whispered in his ear, when
</p>
<p>he proclaimed, in a loud voice, "The conrt is indicted; sher-
</p>
<p>iff, adjourn court."
</p>
<p>Many other amusing incidents are related of him while
</p>
<p>exercising the functions of a judge, but space will not per-
</p>
<p>mit us to give more than one. A case involving the title to
</p>
<p>a cow was tried in his court, and warmly contested. Each
</p>
<p>party proved that he raised the cow from a calf, but it ap-
</p>
<p>peared in evidence that the defendant was unusually kind to
</p>
<p>the animal, providing for her an abundance of food, and a
</p>
<p>comfortable shelter in the winter. The testimony was so
</p>
<p>evenly balanced that the judge took the case under advise-
</p>
<p>ment, and the next day gave the following opinion :
</p>
<p>" I have carefully considered this case, and shall decide it upon the author-
</p>
<p>ity of the Bible. King Solomon was a good and wise man, and upon one
</p>
<p>occasion two women came before him claiming the same child. The king was
</p>
<p>unable to decide from the evidence, and called for a sword to cut the child in
</p>
<p>twain, so that each claimant could take half. One of the women threw her-
</p>
<p>self in the way of the sword, and said, ' Oh, my lord, give her the living
</p>
<p>child, and in nowise slay it.' But the other said, ' Let it be neither mine nor
</p>
<p>thine, but divide it.' Then the king said, 'Give her the living child, and in
</p>
<p>nowise slay it: she is the mother thereof.'

</p>
<p>" Now, in this case the testimony shows that the defendant has been kind to
</p>
<p>the cow, and provided liberally for her at all seasons of the year, and has
</p>
<p>manifested much feeling for the brute. This fact is entitled to much weight,
</p>
<p>and leaves me no alternative but to render judgment in his behalf."
</p>
<p>Judge Mullanphy was very fond of the drama, and ane
</p>
<p>BRYAN MULLANPHY. 225
</p>
<p>of its most liberal patrons. During one of the engagements
</p>
<p>of Jameison, the tragedian, he called upon him ;it the Plant-
</p>
<p>ers' House, and invited him to take a ride. They proceeded
</p>
<p>ten or twelve miles below the city, when they stopped at a
</p>
<p>saloon for a glass of wine. While Jameison was perusing a
</p>
<p>magazine which he found on the table, Judge Mullanphy qui-
</p>
<p>etl}' and unnoticed got into his buggy and drove rapidly
</p>
<p>back to the city, leaving the actor to get back the best way
</p>
<p>in his power. It was near night, and Jameison was forced
</p>
<p>to hire a conveyance at an extravagant price, and when he
</p>
<p>reached the theater, half an hour behind his time, he found
</p>
<p>the manager attempting to apologize to the audience for his
</p>
<p>absence. No reason for this whim of the judge was given,
</p>
<p>nor was Jameison able to assign any motive for it ; though it
</p>
<p>is more than probable that he had said something which dis-
</p>
<p>pleased the judge.
</p>
<p>In his intercourse with others he was sometimes abrupt,
</p>
<p>and not unfrequently appeared discourteous ; yet under that
</p>
<p>rough exterior he carried a heart that overflowed w ith kind-
</p>
<p>ness and benevolence. The poor of St. Louis never had,
</p>
<p>and never will have, a better friend. His bount)^ knew no
</p>
<p>limit, and the recipients of his charity were innumerable ;
</p>
<p>and though he has been in his grave twenty-seven years, not
</p>
<p>a day passes without a jjrayer to Heaven for his blessing, by
</p>
<p>some recipient of his bounty.
</p>
<p>With a unanimity almost unparalleled he was called upon,
</p>
<p>in 1847, to fill the office of mayor of St. Louis; and during
</p>
<p>his administration the cholera prevailed as an epidemic
</p>
<p>throughout the country, and particularly was it fatal among
</p>
<p>emigrants seeking homes in the West, who were exposed to
</p>
<p>it by the privations and hardships of a long journey. The
</p>
<p>mayor made daily visits to their encampments, and pro-
</p>
<p>vided for their necessities, furnishing them with wholesome
</p>
<p>food and medical attention, and leaving nothing undone to

</p>
<p>insure their health and comfort. In those daily visits he wit-
</p>
<p>nessed much suffering, and became impressed with the ne-
</p>
<p>cessity of adopting some method to supply their wants in the
</p>
<p>future. It was a grand conception, particularly in one born

<p>\\\ affluence, and who knew nothing personally of the bitter
</p>
<p>pangs of poverty ; and when we reflect that it has been ex-
</p>
<p>ecuted, and is still being executed, by his individual bounty,
</p>
<p>we cannot be too lavish in awarding to his memory that rev-
</p>
<p>erence which it so richly deserves.
</p>
<p>On one occasion, in 1849, ^'^^ ji-'^^gs invited a friend to
</p>
<p>take a social glass with him, and they entered a saloon which
</p>
<p>he occasionally visited. While drinking to each other's health,
</p>
<p>the judge asked the proprietor for a piece of writing-paper,
</p>
<p>which he was unable to furnish ; whereupon, seeing a book
</p>
<p>lying upon the counter, he tore out the fly-leaf, and upon it
</p>
<p>wrote his will, in the following words:
</p>
<p>"I, Bryan ^lullanphy, do make and declare the following to be my last will
</p>
<p>and testament: One equal undivided third of all my property, real, per-
</p>
<p>sonal, and iixed, I leave to the city of St. Louis, in the state of Missouri,
</p>
<p>in trust, to be and constitute a fund to furnish relief to all poor emigrants
</p>
<p>and travelers coming to St. Louis on their way, bona fide, to settle in the
</p>
<p>West.
</p>
<p>" I do appoint Felix Coste and Peter G. Camden executors of this my last
</p>
<p>will and testament, and of any other will or executory devise that I may
</p>
<p>leave. All and any such document will be found to be autograph, all in my
</p>
<p>own handwriting.
</p>
<p>"In testimony whereof, witness my hand and seal.
</p>
<p>[Signed,] " Bryan Mullanphy. \Seal.'\ "
</p>
<p>Calling upon two of his acquaintances to witness it, he
</p>
<p>folded it up and placed it in the hands of a friend for safe-
</p>
<p>keeping, and after his death, in 1851, it was regularly
</p>
<p>probated.
</p>
<p>An attempt was made by one of the interested parties to
</p>
<p>break the will upon several grounds, chiefly, however, the
</p>
<p>following :
</p>
<p>1. That the city of St. Louis was not competent to take
</p>
<p>the trust attempted to be created by the will.
</p>
<p>2. That the alleged will was void by reason of the uncer-

</p>
<p>tainty as to who were the beneficiaries.
</p>
<p>After a long and protracted litigation the will was sus-
</p>
<p>tained. The reader is referred to a report of the case in the
</p>
<p>29th Missouri Reports, page 543.
</p>
<p>By the will the city of St. Louis received, in trust, prop-

</p>
<p>erty then valued at $500,000. By an ordinance of the City
</p>
<p>Council a board was created to take charge of the property,
</p>
<p>and so invest it as to create an annual income ; and this in-
</p>
<p>come is expended in carrying out the will and design of the
</p>
<p>donor.
</p>
<p>Not a day passes in which some emigrant who has reached
</p>
<p>our city impoverished by sickness or otherwise is not sent
</p>
<p>forward rejoicing, through the bounty of this noble benefac-
</p>
<p>tor of mankind.
</p>
<p>Judge Mullanphy, in his charities, was as eccentric as in
</p>
<p>everything else. Almost every morning he visited the old
</p>
<p>market-house, then on Main Street, between Market and
</p>
<p>Walnut. On one of these visits he noticed a woman try-
</p>
<p>ing to sell a cow. She had several children with her, and
</p>
<p>though they appeared clean, they carried with them the evi-
</p>
<p>dences of want and poverty. The judge quietly requested a
</p>
<p>policeman to ascertain who she was, and her condition, and
</p>
<p>report to him. He learned that she was a widow from the
</p>
<p>opposite side of the river, who had recently lost her husband,
</p>
<p>and that she was endeavoring to sell her only cow to provide
</p>
<p>winter clothing for eight children. The judge immediately
</p>
<p>approached her and asked the price of the cow. " Twenty
</p>
<p>dollars," she replied. "Ah, my good woman," said he, "your
</p>
<p>cow is not worth half the amount, and it is an imposition
</p>
<p>to charge such a price." He abused her roundly until she
</p>
<p>became greatly frightened, when he said to her: "My wife
</p>
<p>(he was never married) is on a visit to Europe, and be-
</p>
<p>fore leaving home lost a favorite cow, which this greatly re-
</p>
<p>sembles, and I want to buy yours as a present for her on
</p>
<p>her return ; but she will not be back before spring, and I
</p>
<p>have no place to keep her. Now, I will give you the $20
</p>
<p>you ask, and $\o additional, if you will take her home and
</p>
<p>keep her until I call for her." The good woman received
</p>
<p>the $30, and, if still alive, is no doubt wondering why the

</p>
<p>judge has not called for his cow.
</p>
<p>Upon another occasion lie was riding in the lower part of
</p>
<p>the city, and, in passing a row of small one-story tenements
</p>
<p>belonging to him, noticed that one of them, which had been
</p>
<p>228 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>for some time vacant, was occupied. He dismounted, and
</p>
<p>found in the premises a poor woman with six or seven small
</p>
<p>children, destitute of all the necessaries of life, and with no
</p>
<p>furniture but an old straw bed and a tea-pot and skillet.
</p>
<p>He wanted to know by what authority she had taken pos-
</p>
<p>session of his house. She replied that she had just lost her
</p>
<p>husband in Jefferson County, and, as winter was approaching,
</p>
<p>she concluded to come to St. Louis in hopes of getting
</p>
<p>something to do ; that she had walked thirty miles, carrying
</p>
<p>her infant in her arms, and being without any means, and
</p>
<p>seeing the house vacant, she thought there could be no
</p>
<p>harm in occupying it for a few days. He told her that she
</p>
<p>had violated the law, and was liable at any moment to be
</p>
<p>arrested for it. She begged his pardon most piteously.
</p>
<p>Finally he told her she must pay rent. She replied that she
</p>
<p>was without a cent. "Well," said he, "I will tell you how
</p>
<p>you can pay the rent. I keep a clothing store, and will send
</p>
<p>you some coarse sewing to do ; and, as I have had lately to
</p>
<p>take a little furniture for debt, and have no suitable place
</p>
<p>to keep it, I will send it here for you to take charge of; but
</p>
<p>you must keep it in use to prevent its injury; and I will send
</p>
<p>you some provisions, which you can also pay for in sewing."
</p>
<p>Thereupon the judge went to a tenant who dealt in ready-
</p>
<p>made clothing, and made an arrangement to send the woman
</p>
<p>plenty of sewing, with an understanding that she was to
</p>
<p>receive double pay for her work, one-half to be charged to
</p>
<p>him. He also sent her fuel, provisions, two beds with the
</p>
<p>necessary bedding, a small table and a few chairs, and some
</p>
<p>cooking utensils. His object was, not only to aid the
</p>
<p>woman, but to induce her to think that she was earning it by
</p>
<p>her labor.
</p>
<p>These are mentioned to show his peculiar way of dispens-
</p>
<p>ing charity, and they furnish but two instances out of
</p>
<p>hundreds.

<p>In 1840, while the author was living in the town of Union,
</p>
<p>Judge Mullanphy owned four lots fronting the public square,
</p>
<p>and while attending court at Union learned that some relig-
</p>
<p>ious society contemplated erecting a church there, but were
</p>
<p>BRYAN MULLANPHY. 229
</p>
<p>waiting for means. As he was about to leave for St. Louis,
</p>
<p>he took us one side and remarked that if they wanted ground
</p>
<p>upon which to build, he would give them the four lots ; and
</p>
<p>wished us to write to him in reference to it. He did this to
</p>
<p>avoid any public declaration of thanks.
</p>
<p>It was in this quiet and unostentatious manner that he
</p>
<p>dispensed his bounty.
</p>
<p>Judge Mullanphy had a good fund of dry humor, and rel-
</p>
<p>ished a good joke as well as any one. Once, while on his
</p>
<p>way to Mobile, he fell in company with a young clergyman
</p>
<p>from New Orleans who was seeking an appointment as pastor
</p>
<p>to a congregation in Mobile, and was expected to preach
</p>
<p>there the following Sunday. Everything depended upon the
</p>
<p>impression he might make ; and, feeling a want of confidence
</p>
<p>in his own ability, requested the judge to write a sermon for
</p>
<p>him, which the judge did, taking for his text the words :
</p>
<p>" And Balaam's ass spake." The discourse so pleased the
</p>
<p>congregation that the young clergyman was immediately
</p>
<p>installed as pastor.
</p>
<p>Judge Mullanphy was a man of decided will and courage, as
</p>
<p>the following incident will show : While mayor of St. Louis
</p>
<p>the City Council passed an ordinance to open Broadway
</p>
<p>from Franklin Avenue north. To do so it was necessary to
</p>
<p>take down a few feet of a fence upon the property of one
</p>
<p>Jonas Moore, a large and stalwart butcher. When the city
</p>
<p>engineer and marshal attempted to remove the fence, Moore
</p>
<p>appeared with a shot-gun and threatened to shoot the first
</p>
<p>man who attempted to remove the fence. The officers re-
</p>
<p>ported the fact to the mayor, who, in their company and a
</p>
<p>carpenter in the employ of the city, immediately repaired to
</p>
<p>the place. Moore was on hand with his gun, and again
</p>
<p>warned them against interfering with his fence. The mayor
</p>
<p>directed the carpenter to measure off the number of feet
</p>
<p>necessary to be moved, and, with a saw in his hand, ap-

</p>
<p>proached the fence, saying to the officer : " Mr. Marshal, if
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore shoots me, you know your duty," and com-
</p>
<p>menced sawing away. Moore, seeing that the mayor was

<p>230 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>determined to enforce the law, became ashamed of himself,
</p>
<p>and immediately retired inside of his premises.
</p>
<p>Judge Mullanphy died in June, 185 1, in St. Louis. The
</p>
<p>bar of St. Louis met at the court-house, and by resolution
</p>
<p>paid a handsome tribute to his memory. A fine portrait

<p>ROBERT W. CRAWFORD.
</p>
<p>About the year 1840 we met Mr. Crawford at Waynesville,
</p>
<p>in Pulaski County, attending the Circuit Court over which
</p>
<p>Judge Charles H. Allen, better known as " Horse" Allen,
</p>
<p>presided. Mr. Crawford was then residing at Mt. Vernon, in
</p>
<p>Lawrence County, but practiced law in most of the counties
</p>
<p>of south-west Missouri. We recollect him as a thin, spare-
</p>
<p>made man, but very tall  at least six feet and two or three
</p>
<p>inches. We found him a pleasant, companionable man, with
</p>
<p>a good fund of humor, and a favorite with the bar. We met
</p>
<p>him at several terms of that court, and although we never
</p>
<p>saw him engaged in any case calculated to display his ability
</p>
<p>as a lawyer, yet he had the reputation of being well read
</p>
<p>in his profession, and we learned afterwards that he always
</p>
<p>enjoyed a good practice. Phelps, Hendricks, Yancey, and
</p>
<p>Waddle were his compeers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Crawford was born in Brooks County, Virginia, on
</p>
<p>March 3, 181 2, and completed his education in the college
</p>
<p>at Cannonsburg, Pennsylvania, and read law under John
</p>
<p>Campbell, Esq., of Wellsburg, Virginia.
</p>
<p>In the year 1837 he came West and settled at Springfield,
</p>
<p>Missouri, but in a short time removed to the neighborhood
</p>
<p>of Mt. Vernon, where he entered a tract of land, which he
</p>
<p>improved and made his residence until the breaking out of
</p>
<p>the war.
</p>
<p>He died suddenly at Neosho, Newton County, October
</p>
<p>19, 1873, while in attendance upon the Circuit Court of that
</p>
<p>county. He left a widow, four sons, and three daughters
</p>
<p>to mourn his loss. At the time of his death his residence
</p>
<p>was in Springfield, but his remains were interred on his old
</p>
<p>farm, in sight of Mt. Vernon.
</p>
<p>Mr. Crawford was a kind-hearted and hospitable man, and

<p>He was elected to the Constitutional Convention of 1861,
</p>
<p>from the Eighteenth Senatorial District, having for his col-
</p>
<p>league A. S. Marbin, of Barry County. His sympathies were
</p>
<p>with the South, and he voted generally with the secession-

<p>the proceedings. He certainly made no reputation.

<p>Henderson Young.
</p>
<p>This learned judge, who resided in Lexington, Missouri,
</p>
<p>presided at one time over the Twelfth Judicial Circuit,
</p>
<p>but at the time of his death, and for several years prior
</p>
<p>thereto, was judge of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, embracing
</p>
<p>the counties of Lafayette, Saline, Pettis, Jackson, Cass, and
</p>
<p>Johnson.
</p>
<p>He was a native of Hawkins County, Tennessee, and born
</p>
<p>in i8li. His father was one of the earliest settlers in that
</p>
<p>state, and for twenty-two years represented his county in
</p>
<p>the State Legislature. Upon his death in 1822 or 1823, when
</p>
<p>Henderson was but twelve years of age, his estate was found
</p>
<p>greatly embarrassed, and his widow and the younger mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the family were left in very reduced circumstances.
</p>
<p>This was a , great disappointment to his son, who had ex-
</p>
<p>pressed a strong desire to obtain a liberal education, with the
</p>
<p>view, which at that early period he had embraced, of making
</p>
<p>the law his profession. Notwithstanding these adverse cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, he continued his studies, and, by applying him-
</p>
<p>self diligently to his books, was in time enabled to open a
</p>
<p>small school, which gave him the means to enter an
</p>
<p>academy; and thus by teaching one session and attending
</p>
<p>the academy another, alternating between the two, he was
</p>
<p>enabled to obtain a fair English education. While attending
</p>
<p>the district school he walked five or six miles, scarcely ever
</p>
<p>missing a day. Such perseverance, industry, and determina-
</p>
<p>tion could not otherwise than meet their reward.
</p>
<p>He entered upon the study of the law with Judge Samuel
</p>
<p>Powell, wlio was judge of the circuit in which he lived, and
</p>
<p>upon August 28, 1832, was admitted to the bar by Judges
</p>
<p>Powell and Scott, During his legal studies a very warm
</p>
<p>friendship sprang up between him and his preceptor, which
</p>
<p>lasted as long as both lived. It was fortunate for Mr. Young

<p>that he was privileged to study under one who was so able

<p>In 1833 Mr. Young came to Missouri, and settled in Lex-

<p>ington, then, as now, a flourishing town, and at once entered

<p>he who has passed the ordeal can form any conception of the
</p>
<p>difficulties and privations that beset a young man thus start-
</p>
<p>ing out in life, particularly in the profession of the law. But
</p>
<p>the patient application, prompt attention to business, and
</p>
<p>pleasant and agreeable address of Mr. Young brought him, in
</p>
<p>time, many warm friends, who took a deep interest in his
</p>
<p>welfare, and greatly aided and encouraged him in his profes-
</p>
<p>sional efforts ; and feeling that his future was assured, he, on
</p>
<p>May 23, 1839, united in marriage with Miss Callaway, a
</p>
<p>daughter of Captain Thomas Callaway, a wealthy planter in
</p>
<p>Lafayette County.
</p>
<p>In 1 842 he was appointed circuit attorney for his circuit. In
</p>
<p>1844 he was appointed by Governor Thomas Reynolds judge
</p>
<p>of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit, which necessitated a change
</p>
<p>of residence, and he immediately removed to Platte County,
</p>
<p>He continued to discharge the duties of judge of that circuit
</p>
<p>until 1848, when Governor Austin A. King appointed him
</p>
<p>judge of the Sixth Circuit. He then returned to Lexington.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the Legislature had made the judiciary elect-
</p>
<p>ive, and in 185 I he was elected by the people to the same
</p>
<p>office for a period of six years, and before the expiration of
</p>
<p>his term, to wit, on July 23, 1854, died at his home in Lex-
</p>
<p>ington, aged forty-three.
</p>
<p>The memory of Judge Young is greatly revered by all
</p>
<p>who knew him ; for his amiable and affable disposition, his
</p>
<p>kind and benevolent heart, and his unswerving integrity, and
</p>
<p>his devotion to public duty made him many warm and at-

<p>tached friends. He was not long enough at the bar to ob-
</p>
<p>tain much distinction as a lawyer, but on the bench he gave
</p>
<p>evidence of his thorough knowledge of his profession, and
</p>
<p>became exceedingly popular as a jurist. He never mani-
</p>
<p>fested any feeling allied to prejudice or partiality, listened
</p>
<p>HENDERSON YOUNG. 235
</p>
<p>attentively to argument of counsel, and evinced a readiness
</p>
<p>at all times to correct any error into which he had fallen.
</p>
<p>These qualities in a jurist always render him acceptable to
</p>
<p>the people and the bar.
</p>
<p>Upon the announcement of Judge Young's death the bar
</p>
<p>of Lafayette County assembled at the court-house, and in
</p>
<p>suitable resolutions paid a fine tribute to his memory, and
</p>
<p>expressed their sense of the great loss sustained in his
</p>
<p>death. Colonel William T. Wood, an eminent lawyer of
</p>
<p>the Lafayette bar, was called to the chair ; and we here give
</p>
<p>an extract from his remarks made on the occasion :
</p>
<p>"We have met to mingle and express our grief for an event that has filled
</p>
<p>all hearts in our community with the profoundest sorrow. The sudden and
</p>
<p>unexpected announcement of the death of Henderson Young brought with it
</p>
<p>overwhelming grief, pervading the whole community.
</p>
<p>" Henderson Young, a brother in our profession, our neighbor, our friend,
</p>
<p>and our judge, after a residence of more than twenty years amongst us, we
</p>
<p>this morning, in sadness and sorrow, must assist in consigning to the mansions
</p>
<p>of the dead, when the cold sod, covering his manly form and beloved counte-
</p>
<p>nance, will forever conceal them from our sight.
</p>
<p>" We have known Judge Young well and intimately, at the bar and on the
</p>
<p>bench. At the bar he was an able and faithful lawyer  true to his client, true
</p>
<p>to his profession, and true to those high and noble principles which made him
</p>
<p>an ornament to the profession. On the bench, possessing an acute and dis-
</p>
<p>criminating mind, he vvas a learned, just, impartial, and incorruptible judge.
</p>
<p>Both at the bar and on the bench he displayed a high order of intellect, aided
</p>
<p>by habits of industry and great legal research. In his intercourse with the
</p>
<p>members of the profession he was endeared to them by his pure and noble sen-
</p>
<p>timents, and by his kind and sociable qualities of heart. But we have known
</p>
<p>him not only as the lawyer and as the judge, and in professional intercourse,
</p>
<p>but in the social circle, in the seclusion of private life, at the domestic fire-
</p>
<p>side, and as the Christian gentleman; and in all relations, on all occasions,
</p>
<p>under all circumstances, he was the same just, generous, kind-hearted, hospi-
</p>
<p>table, high-minded man. I have known him from the time of his arrival in

<p>Missouri; I have known him in the family and social circles, in a most inti-
</p>
<p>mate personal intercourse; I have known him at the bar, on the bench, in
</p>
<p>another circuit and here. During all this time, in the true sense of the word,
</p>
<p>we were friends. A more true friend, a more devoted husband and father, a
</p>
<p>better citizen, a purer public officer, a more generous, noble-hearted man,
</p>
<p>never lived or died. The death of such a man is a public calamity."
</p>
<p>The resolutions of the bar were spread upon the records
</p>
<p>of the several courts of Lafayette County. The judge left a
</p>
<p>widow and several children.

<p>ROSWELL M. FIELD.
</p>
<p>The state of Vermont has the honor of being the native
</p>
<p>state of this well-known and distinguished lawyer. He was
</p>
<p>born February 22, 1807, in Newfane, the shire-town of Wind-
</p>
<p>ham County, a picturesque village of about 1,200 inhabitants,
</p>
<p>in the vicinity of the Green Mountains and the Connecticut
</p>
<p>River. His father. General Martin Field, was a native of
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, of English descent, and a graduate of Will-
</p>
<p>iams College, and in 1805 he received the honorary degree
</p>
<p>of Master of Arts from Dartmouth College, having entered
</p>
<p>upon the practice of the law in Newfane, in 1 800. He was
</p>
<p>a successful lawyer, and filled many places of honor and
</p>
<p>trust in Vermont.
</p>
<p>R. M. Field's mother was a lady of fine intellect, and a
</p>
<p>lineal descendant of that stern old Puritan, Captain Samuel
</p>
<p>Smith, who came from England to Boston in 1634, and
</p>
<p>shortly afterwards settled on the banks of the Connecticut
</p>
<p>River, in the vicinity of Hartford. Roswell, the subject of our
</p>
<p>sketch, received his preliminary education in a private school
</p>
<p>taught by Rev. Luke Whitcomb, of Townshend, Vermont, and
</p>
<p>at the early age of eleven years entered Middlebury College,
</p>
<p>and graduated in 1822. He then commenced the study of
</p>
<p>the law in the office of his kinsman, Hon. Daniel Kellogg, of
</p>
<p>Rockingham, Vermont, and was admitted to the bar in Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, 1825, when but eighteen years of age. The fact
</p>
<p>that he commenced the practice in his native town three
</p>
<p>years in advance of his majority proves that he must have been
</p>
<p>a very precocious youth. He practiced in Windham County
</p>
<p>about fourteen years, and in 1835 and 1836 represented the
</p>
<p>county in the General Assembly of his state, and it is stated
</p>
<p>by a relative, who prepared a number of biographical sketches
</p>
<p>of the leading men of Windham, that while in the Legislature
</p>
<p>he wrote an able report in favor of abrogating the rule of the

<p>common law excluding atheists from testifying in courts of
</p>
<p>ROSWELL M. FIELD. 237
</p>
<p>justice. It is also stated upon the same authority that the
</p>
<p>special pleas which he drew and filed in the libel suit of
</p>
<p>Torrey 7'^. Field, reported in loth Vermont Reports, were de-
</p>
<p>clared by Judge Story to be masterpieces of special pleading.
</p>
<p>He certainly had acquired considerable reputation as a lawyer
</p>
<p>before leaving Vermont, for, at the centennial celebration of
</p>
<p>Nevvfane, in 1874, the Hon. H. H. Wheeler, in responding to
</p>
<p>the toast " The judiciary of the state," referred to many of
</p>
<p>the able lawyers and judges of Vermont, and among them
</p>
<p>spoke of R. M. Field as " one of the brightest and ablest of
</p>
<p>the lawyers in the state and in the nation."
</p>
<p>He was appointed postmaster of Newfane, May i, 1826,
</p>
<p>and was state's attorney of his county from 1832 to 1835.
</p>
<p>Oscar L. Shafter, late associate judge of the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>of California, and who died in 1873, studied law with Mr.
</p>
<p>Field in Vermont. His removal to St. Louis in 1839 was in-
</p>
<p>duced, no doubt, by an event in his domestic life of a pecul-
</p>
<p>iar and romantic nature, which caused him for several years
</p>
<p>to lead a life of retirement and seclusion. This, doubtless,
</p>
<p>was the reason of his want of success for several years after
</p>
<p>removing to the West  indeed, we have heard him state on
</p>
<p>several occasions that during the first six years of his resi-
</p>
<p>dence here his practice did not yield enough to pay his board
</p>
<p>bill, and he was forced to rely on remittances from his father.
</p>
<p>Mr. Field was a ripe scholar, and could read the Latin,
</p>
<p>Greek, Spanish, French, and German languages with much
</p>
<p>ease, and spoke the latter with some fluency, having acquired
</p>
<p>its knowledge by boarding in a German family at St. Louis.
</p>
<p>In addition to being a good linguist, he was well versed in
</p>
<p>English literature, and had a fair knowledge of many of the
</p>
<p>sciences. These advantages, coupled with a good legal
</p>
<p>mind, could not otherwise than fit him for success in his pro-
</p>
<p>fession.
</p>
<p>The most important event in the life of Mr. Field oc-

</p>
<p>curred just prior to his coming West, and has reference to
</p>
<p>his marriage with Miss Mary Ann Phelps, of Windsor, Ver-
</p>
<p>mont. The circumstances attending the marriage were about
</p>
<p>these : She, when eighteen years of age, became engaged
</p>
<p>238 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>to one Jeremiah Clark. In August, 1832, she made a visit
</p>
<p>to a Mrs. Bradley, at Brattleboro', Vermont, and during
</p>
<p>her visit became acquainted with Mr. Field, who knew of her
</p>
<p>engagement to Clark. She became highly pleased with Mr.
</p>
<p>Field, which necessarily weakened her affection for Clark,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding which she continued to write affectionate
</p>
<p>letters to him. Her mother had some intimation of what
</p>
<p>was going on at Brattleboro', and wrote to her daughter to
</p>
<p>return to Windsor. On October 14th, the night previous to
</p>
<p>her return, she had an interview with Mr. Field at the house
</p>
<p>of Mrs. Bradley, and they came to the conclusion to get mar-
</p>
<p>ried. The next day she started for home, Mr. Bradley and
</p>
<p>Mr. Field accompanying her, and when they reached the town
</p>
<p>of Putney the ceremony was performed. It seems that there
</p>
<p>was an understanding between them that she should con-
</p>
<p>tinue on her journey home, and if, on reflection, she did not
</p>
<p>want to consummate the marriage, it should be considered
</p>
<p>null and void. On arriving home she failed to communicate
</p>
<p>to her family what had transpired, but on October 29th
</p>
<p>addressed a letter to Clark, who resided in Boston, to come
</p>
<p>immediately to Windsor, and on his arrival there she dis-
</p>
<p>closed to him and her mother, brothers, and sisters her mar-
</p>
<p>riage with Field, and on the same day wrote to Mr. Field as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>' ' To Mr. Roswell F. :
</p>
<p>"Sir: Moments of consideration and much reflection have at length caused
</p>
<p>me to see in its proper light the whole of my late visit to Brattleboro'. That I
</p>
<p>have been led by you and others to a course of conduct which my own reason,
</p>
<p>sense, and feelings entirely disapprove is now very clear to me. I therefore
</p>
<p>write this to say to you that I am not willing, on any account, to see you again ;
</p>
<p>neither will I, by any course you can adopt, be prevailed upon to view the
</p>
<p>matter in a different light from wliat I now do. I leave you to the alternative of
</p>
<p>forever preventing the public avowal of a disgraceful transaction, of which
</p>
<p>you yourself said you were ashamed.

<p>" Mary A. P."
</p>
<p>On November 6th she addressed another letter to him,
</p>
<p>assuring him that her first letter contained her real senti-
</p>
<p>ments, and on the 27th of the same month she married Mr.
</p>
<p>Clark.
</p>
<p>R OS WELL M. FIELD. 239
</p>
<p>A bill was then filed in the Chancery Court by Clark and
</p>
<p>his wife to declare the marriage with Field null and void,
</p>
<p>upon the ground that the contract was conditional, and not
</p>
<p>to be valid unless ratified by her, and that she had never rati-
</p>
<p>fied the same. Other reasons were assigned, but the case
</p>
<p>turned upon this point. It was contended on the part of
</p>
<p>Mr. Field that there could be no condition annexed to a cere-
</p>
<p>mony of marriage. That it was a union of the parties, or
</p>
<p>nothing. The court held that the ceremony was not
</p>
<p>intended as a marriage /'// pnesenti, to be followed by con-
</p>
<p>summation and cohabitation thereafter without some future
</p>
<p>act or ceremony of marriage. This decision of the chan-
</p>
<p>cellor, upon an appeal to the Supreme Court, was affirmed.
</p>
<p>This doctrine, that parties capable in law of contracting
</p>
<p>marriage can enter into a conditional contract, is so subver-
</p>
<p>sive of every principle of marital law that we are constrained
</p>
<p>to believe that the Supreme Court of Vermont was actuated
</p>
<p>more by a desire to save Mrs. Clark from the charge of
</p>
<p>being an adulteress than a wish to enforce the law upon that
</p>
<p>subject.
</p>
<p>This incident in the life of Mr. Field had a marked effect
</p>
<p>upon his character, and almost made him a cynic. For
</p>
<p>years he withdrew from society, and scarcely ever mingled
</p>
<p>with the people. He ultimately married a Miss Frances
</p>
<p>Reed, of St. Louis, and after her death Mrs. Clark, whose
</p>
<p>husband had also died, visited St. Louis with the intention
</p>
<p>and desire of bringing about a reconciliation between her-
</p>
<p>self and Mr. Field ; but he declined an interview, and she
</p>
<p>returned to Vermont.
</p>
<p>The reader will find a partial history of this case in the
</p>
<p>13th Vermont Reports, page 460 and following.
</p>
<p>In the view we take of this event in the life of Mr. Field,
</p>
<p>which is doubtless the true version of it, there is no ground
</p>
<p>upon which to censure him, notwithstanding he was advised

</p>
<p>of her engagement to Clark. Mr. Clark was a man of
</p>
<p>wealth, and Miss Phelps' family thought her marriage with
</p>
<p>him was most desirable, while her heart had been given to
</p>
<p>Mr. Field, who unquestionably loved her. If she returned to
</p>
<p>240 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Windsor without consummating her engagement with Field,
</p>
<p>the influence of her family would undoubtedly have induced
</p>
<p>her to marry Clark, and it w(nild have been a marriage of
</p>
<p>interest and convenience, instead of affection. This theory
</p>
<p>of the case is supported by subsequent events, for otherwise
</p>
<p>she would not have visited St. Louis after the death of her
</p>
<p>husband and Mrs. Field, for the purpose of renewing her
</p>
<p>early pledge.
</p>
<p>It may be said that this theory does not comport w ith the
</p>
<p>terms and character of her letter to Mr. Field, written after
</p>
<p>returning to Windsor; but we must bear in mind that she
</p>
<p>was a young and inexperienced girl, readily influenced by
</p>
<p>her family, and the letter itself bears the ear-marks of one
</p>
<p>far more skilled in matrimonial diplomacy than herself.
</p>
<p>The fact that the parties were allied to many of the oldest
</p>
<p>and most influential families of Vermont and Massachusetts
</p>
<p>gave the case an unusual interest, and the press abounded in
</p>
<p>many criticisms upon the ruling of the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>Many of the Field family belonged to the legal profession,
</p>
<p>and among them was an elder brother of R. M. Field, by the
</p>
<p>name of Charles K. Field, who was not only a fine lawyer,
</p>
<p>but a vigorous writer. We are unable to state whether he is
</p>
<p>still living.
</p>
<p>The subject of our sketch was of tall, commanding figure,
</p>
<p>and dignified deportment. Among his personal friends he
</p>
<p>was very social and entertaining. His fondness for children
</p>
<p>was notable. He would often stop on the street to see the
</p>
<p>boys playing ball or marbles. He played on the violin and
</p>
<p>flute, and would often sit on the steps of his house, in the
</p>
<p>evening, and play on the violin to collect a lot of boys
</p>
<p>around him. The children in his neighborhood knew him
</p>
<p>well, and he would let them approach him on terms of the
</p>
<p>utmost familiarity. He was regarded generally as a very in-
</p>
<p>dolent man, but he indulged in as much physical exercise as

</p>
<p>most men. He was exceedingly fond of walking, and his
</p>
<p>long legs enabled him to get over a large space of ground in
</p>
<p>a short time. He visited the Law Library daily, and would
</p>
<p>walk up and down the room for hours, with his hands behind
</p>
<p>ROSWELL M. FIELD. 24 1
</p>
<p>him, and in each step would take in about four feet. When
</p>
<p>in his office or at his residence he spent three-fourths of his
</p>
<p>time in walking, and he could be recognized at the distance
</p>
<p>of several squares by his peculiar long stride.
</p>
<p>As a real-estate lawyer Mr. Field had no superior at the
</p>
<p>St. Louis bar, and was generally retained in most of the
</p>
<p>important cases involving titles under Spanish grants. He
</p>
<p>brought the famous Dred Scott suit in the Circuit Court of
</p>
<p>the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri, which
</p>
<p>involved the question as to whether slaves were embraced
</p>
<p>under the word " citizens," in the Federal Constitution, and
</p>
<p>could claim the rights and privileges which that instrument
</p>
<p>provides for and secures to citizens of the United States.
</p>
<p>Mr. Field did not follow the case to Washington, but the ar-
</p>
<p>gument made on the part of Dred Scott was no doubt pre-
</p>
<p>pared to some extent by him. Many of Mr. Field's briefs
</p>
<p>in important cases will be found in the Reports of the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court of Missouri. As a close, logical reasoner he was
</p>
<p>not excelled. He was not an orator, and made no effort at
</p>
<p>display in that field. His style was purely conversational.
</p>
<p>He seldom addressed a jury, and we are not aware that he ever
</p>
<p>delivered a public address ; hence he has not left behind him
</p>
<p>any contemporaneous record of his speeches, and all we
</p>
<p>know of his legal arguments is what is contained in some of
</p>
<p>his printed briefs. Our acquaintance with him commenced
</p>
<p>in 1852, and we knew him well from that time till his death,
</p>
<p>which occurred in St. Louis about six or seven years ago.
</p>
<p>It was produced by a cancer in the stomach. He left two
</p>
<p>sons, now residing in St. Louis, one of whom is connected
</p>
<p>with one of our daily journals.

</p>
<p>Benjamin M. Lisle.
</p>
<p>Our acquaintance with the Jefferson City bar commenced
</p>
<p>in the winter of 1836-7, and among its members was Mr.
</p>
<p>Lisle, who was born in Green County, Kentucky, January
</p>
<p>29, 1808. His educational advantages were not great, but
</p>
<p>he improved his mind by study and constant reading. He
</p>
<p>studied law in Kentucky, and obtained, in 1831, a license to
</p>
<p>practice there ; but in the same year came to Missouri and
</p>
<p>engaged in mercantile pursuits, which, proving distasteful to
</p>
<p>him, he abandoned ; then renewed his law studies, and com-
</p>
<p>menced the practice in Jefferson City in 1833, where he
</p>
<p>remained till his death, which occurred February 18, 1845,
</p>
<p>near his thirty-seventh year.
</p>
<p>On October 17, 1837, he was united in marriage to Miss
</p>
<p>Margaretta Jacoby, a lady of beauty and intelligence. To
</p>
<p>give the occasion as much dignity and solemnity as possible,
</p>
<p>the Hon. George Tompkins, judge of the Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>solemnized the rights, and the Hon. William B. Napton,
</p>
<p>present judge of the same court, acted as groomsman.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lisle's life was too short to enable him to obtain dis-
</p>
<p>tinction in his profession, but he ranked well at the bar, and
</p>
<p>his cheerful, happy disposition made him friends wherever
</p>
<p>he went, and secured him a good share of the practice. He
</p>
<p>was a fluent, persuasive speaker, and before a jury, quite
</p>
<p>effective.
</p>
<p>We met him several times at Waynesville, attending the
</p>
<p>Pulaski court. Upon one of these occasions a large ball was
</p>

</p>
<p>ROBERT Wash.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, who became a judge of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of Missouri shortly after the organization of the state
</p>
<p>government, was a native of Virginia, and born in Louisa
</p>
<p>County, November 29, 1790. His parents were enabled to
</p>
<p>give him a better education than most young men of that
</p>
<p>day enjoyed, and sent him, when quite young, to William and
</p>
<p>Mary College, where he graduated in 1808, when only eight-
</p>
<p>een years of age. After pursuing a regular course of legal
</p>
<p>studies he was admitted to the bar, and at the close of the
</p>
<p>War of 1812 emigrated to the West, and opened a law-office
</p>
<p>in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>During President Monroe's administration he served as
</p>
<p>United States district attorney for the district of St. Louis,
</p>
<p>and in that office acquired considerable reputation as a
</p>
<p>lawyer. He had some military experience before coming
</p>
<p>West, for during the War of 18 12 he held the position of
</p>
<p>major on General Howard's staff, and was regarded and es-
</p>
<p>teemed as a good officer.
</p>
<p>After St. Louis became incorporated, Mr. Wash was
</p>
<p>elected a member of the City Council, and took an active
</p>
<p>part in inaugurating a system of improvements, having par-
</p>
<p>ticular reference to the establishment of grades for the
</p>
<p>streets, and the laying down of suitable pavements and side-
</p>
<p>walks. He also directed his attention to the improvement
</p>
<p>of the harbor and levee. He predicted, what afterwards
</p>
<p>came to pass, that, unless proper dikes were established, the
</p>
<p>channel of the river on the west side would become greatly
</p>
<p>obstructed by the formation of sand-bars. Other matters
</p>
<p>connected with the prosperity of the city received due con-
</p>
<p>sideration at his hands. Mr. Wash had an exalted opinion

</p>
<p>of the future of St. Louis, and invested his means in real
</p>
<p>ROBERT WASH. 245
</p>
<p>estate, which laid the foundation for an ample fortune, which
</p>
<p>he enjoyed through life.
</p>
<p>He married twice, his first wife being a daughter of Major
</p>
<p>Christy, and the widow of Taylor Berry. By this wife he
</p>
<p>had one daughter, Frances, who became the wife of George
</p>
<p>W. Goode, Esq., then a member of the St. Louis bar. His
</p>
<p>second wife was Miss Eliza L. Taylor, daughter of Colonel
</p>
<p>N. P. Taylor, by whom he had several daughters and four
</p>
<p>sons. One of the daughters, Elizabeth C, married John Y.
</p>
<p>Page, Esq., and another, Mary Wynn, C. P. Ellerbe, Esq.,
</p>
<p>both members of the St. Louis bar. His son Pendleton was
</p>
<p>killed in Virginia during the late war.
</p>
<p>Judge Wash was not at the bar long enough to obtain
</p>
<p>much fame as a lawyer. We must, therefore, deal with him
</p>
<p>as a judge. His opinions, which will be found in volumes i
</p>
<p>to 5, inclusive, of the State Reports, show that his mind was
</p>
<p>regularly trained to the law. They abound in much good
</p>
<p>sense, and more or less legal research. Notwithstanding his
</p>
<p>classical education, they are entirely free from any attempt
</p>
<p>to display his learning. They are such as might be expected
</p>
<p>in a judge who was seeking to lay down the law of the case,
</p>
<p>instead of directing attention to polished diction. That he
</p>
<p>made an acceptable judge is generally admitted.
</p>
<p>Judge Wash was, like most Virginians, exceedingly fond of
</p>
<p>the chase, and always kept a pack of hounds. The prairie
</p>
<p>adjoining St. Louis was at that day greatly infested with
</p>
<p>foxes. It is said that upon one occasion while he was on the
</p>
<p>bench, an attorney who understood the judge's proclivity for
</p>
<p>sports of the field whispered to him that they had started
</p>
<p>three at one time in the neighborhood of the judge's resi-
</p>
<p>dence. He was immediately taken with severe cramps in
</p>
<p>the stomach, which rendered an adjournment of the court
</p>
<p>necessary. Within an hour he was in his saddle, following
</p>
<p>closely upon the heels of the hounds. These sudden at-

</p>
<p>tacks were of frequent occurrence, but the sound of the
</p>
<p>hounds ringing through the woods proved a most efficacious
</p>
<p>remedy. This love of the chase is peculiar to Virginians,
</p>
<p>246 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>and they no doubt inherited it from their EngHsh ancestry,
</p>
<p>for as far back as history takes us the EngHsh people de-
</p>
<p>Hghted in the sound of the horn and the music of the hounds.
</p>
<p>Sidney, an EngHsh writer of the sixteenth century, thus
</p>
<p>describes a stag hunt in his day :
</p>
<p>"They came to the side of the wood, where the hounds were in couples,
</p>
<p>staying their coming, but with a whining accent craving liberty; many of them
</p>
<p>in colour and marks so resembling, that it shewed they were of one kind.
</p>
<p>" The huntsmen handsomely attired in their green liveries, as though they were
</p>
<p>children of summer, with staves in their hands to Ijeat the guiltless earth, when
</p>
<p>the hounds were at a fault ; and with horns al)Out their necks, to sound an alarm
</p>
<p>upon a silly fugative. The hounds were straight uncoupled, and ere long the
</p>
<p>stag thought it better to trust to the nimbleness of his feet than to the slender
</p>
<p>fortification of his lodging ; but even his feet betrayed him ; for, howsoever they
</p>
<p>went, they themselves uttered themselves to the scent of their enemies, who,
</p>
<p>one taking it of another, and sometimes believing the wind's advertisements,
</p>
<p>sometimes the view of  their faithful counsellors  the huntsmen, with open
</p>
<p>mouths, then denounced war, when the war was already begun. Their cry
</p>
<p>being composed of so well-sorted mouths that any man would perceive tlierein
</p>
<p>some kind of proportion, but the skilful woodmen did find a music. Their de-
</p>
<p>light and variety of opinion drew the horsemen sundry ways, yet cheering their
</p>
<p>hounds with voice and horn, kept still as it were together. The Wood seemed
</p>
<p>to conspire with them against his own citizens, dispersing their noise through
</p>
<p>all his quarters, and even the nympth Echo left to bewail the loss of Narcissus,
</p>
<p>and became a hunter. But the stag was in the end so hotly persued, that,
</p>
<p>leaving his flight, he was driven to make courage of despair ; and so turning his
</p>
<p>head, made the hounds, with change of speech, to testify that he was at a bay :
</p>
<p>as if from hot persuit of their enemy, they were suddenly come to a parley."
</p>
<p>Judge Wash died in November, 1856, having just com-
</p>
<p>pleted his sixty-sixth year. He resigned the office of judge
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Court in May, 1837. He was a good-
</p>
<p>hearted man, fond of society, and dispensed hospitality with
</p>
<p>a liberal hand.
</p>
<p>In early life Judge Wash was a warm personal friend of

<p>Among the papers of the judge now in the possession of

<p>''Missouri:'
</p>
<p>John Bent.
</p>
<p>This gentleman was a son of Judge Silas Bent, former
</p>
<p>judge of the United States District Court at St. Louis.
</p>
<p>John Bent was born in Virginia, May 31, i<So3, and received
</p>
<p>his education at Cannonsburg College, Washington County,
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania. After being admitted to the bar in Missouri,
</p>
<p>about 1824 or 1825, Judge Carr appointed him clerk of the
</p>
<p>Circuit Court of Jefferson County, which made it necessary
</p>
<p>for him to reside in Herculaneum, then the county-seat of
</p>
<p>that county. Under the law as it then existed he became,
</p>
<p>also, ex officio, recorder of the county. After holding this
</p>
<p>office about a year he resigned and returned to St. Louis,
</p>
<p>when he received the appointment of justice of the peace, at
</p>
<p>that time an office of no little honor.
</p>
<p>In 1828 he was elected by the people a representative in
</p>
<p>the State Legislature, and by his urbane manner and fine
</p>
<p>powers of declamation soon acquired influence as a repre-
</p>
<p>sentative. On his return from the Legislature he was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed circuit attorney for the St. Louis Circuit, the duties of
</p>
<p>which office he discharged faithfully and ably from six to
</p>
<p>eight years.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bent married Miss Olivia McClelland, of Boone
</p>
<p>County, Missouri, by whom he had two daughters and a son,
</p>
<p>the latter now a Baptist minister stationed in some part of
</p>
<p>Kentucky.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bent died in Callaway County, Missouri, May 18, 1845,
</p>
<p>at the age of forty-two years. His death was occasioned by
</p>
<p>an injury received from the overturning of a coach in which
</p>
<p>he was traveling.
</p>
<p>While engaged in the practice of his profession in St.
</p>
<p>Louis he was regarded as one of the most promising young
</p>
<p>lawyers in the state, and his friends anticipated for him a

</p>
<p>bright future. He had many elements of a successful law-
</p>
<p>JOHN BENT. 249
</p>
<p>yer, but his genial and social habits interfered greatly with
</p>
<p>his studies, and he made but little improvement after passing
</p>
<p>his thirtieth year.
</p>
<p>With the people of St. Louis and the adjacent counties he
</p>
<p>was very popular, and they never denied him any office he
</p>
<p>asked for. To this day he is often referred to as a whole-
</p>
<p>souled, generous gentleman, and a kind and obliging friend.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rent was at times very happy at a retort. He was
</p>
<p>once summoned as a witness in the Jefferson Circuit Court,
</p>
<p>to testify as to an affray which he accidentally witnessed.
</p>
<p>On the day he was examined he had dined out with a few
</p>
<p>friends, and had partaken quite freely of the liquids provided
</p>
<p>for the occasion. When called upon to testify, he felt very
</p>
<p>drowsy, and a young attorney who undertook the cross-ex-
</p>
<p>amination, without knowing Mr. Bent, interrogated him as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>" What is your name, witness?"
</p>
<p>" My name is Bent."
</p>
<p>"Your first name, if you please?"
</p>
<p>"John Bent"
</p>
<p>" You are drunk, are you not?"
</p>
<p>"A little under the influence of wine. I will soon get
</p>
<p>over it, however; but you will never get over being a d  d
</p>
<p>fool."
</p>
<p>The judge fined Mr. Bent ^5 for using profane language in
</p>
<p>court; but the young attorney paid more dearly for his im-
</p>
<p>pertinence, for he never got over the name of " Bent's d  d
</p>
<p>fool." It stuck to him through life.
</p>
<p>It is said that wine sharpens the wit of most men. It is
</p>
<p>certainly true that no subject affords so great a field for genu-
</p>
<p>ine wit as that of temperance. A few years ago an old
</p>
<p>lady, impelled by curiosity, visited the penitentiary at Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son City, and in going the rounds, attended by one of the
</p>
<p>guards, noticed each convict ; but one, a fine-looking young

</p>
<p>man, attracted her particular attention. After eying him
</p>
<p>very closely through her glasses, she remarked to the guard,
</p>
<p>in the hearing of the convict, "I think ardent spirits must
</p>
<p>have had something to do with bringing this young man
</p>
<p>250 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>here." "You are riglit, my good lady," said the convict,
</p>
<p>" for the judge and jury who tried me were all drunk."
</p>
<p>Edwards alludes to a reply made by General Erastus
</p>
<p>Roote, who was lieutenant-governor of New York under
</p>
<p>Governor Yeates. On New Year's day he called (as was
</p>
<p>the universal custom at that time) upon the governor to pay
</p>
<p>his respects, and partook quite freely of some good old
</p>
<p>brandy which the governor had placed on the sideboard.
</p>
<p>The governor exclaimed, "Ah, General, that is your worst
</p>
<p>enemy." " Yes, Governor," replied the general, " but you
</p>
<p>know we are commanded to love our enemies."
</p>
<p>Edwards gives us another upon Chancellor Kent. The
</p>
<p>chancellor was a very temperate man, and when a candidate
</p>
<p>for lieutenant-governor of New York some temperance peo-
</p>
<p>ple wrote to him for a declaration of his views on the use of
</p>
<p>ardent spirits. He wrote in reply, praising temperance,
</p>
<p>giving his own example in illustration of his estimate of its
</p>
<p>value, saying he had drank only one glass in five years, etc.,
</p>
<p>but ended by saying that he must in truth declare that the
</p>
<p>principal reason why he had not drank another glass was
</p>
<p>that the one glass gave him the gout for a fortnight, and he
</p>
<p>intended not to deprive himself of the right of having the

</p>
<p>RICHARD S. THOMAS.
</p>
<p>Of the early life of this gentleman there is nothing known.
</p>
<p>He came to Upper Louisiana as early as 1815, and settled in
</p>
<p>the practice of the law in Cape Girardeau County. In 1817
</p>
<p>or 1818 he was appointed circuit or district judge, and re-
</p>
<p>mained on the bench until 1824, when he was impeached
</p>
<p>and removed by the Legislature.
</p>
<p>He was a large, portly man, with pompous and disagree-
</p>
<p>able manners, which made him exceedingly unpopular with
</p>
<p>the bar and the people ; and in addition to this he was over-
</p>
<p>bearing and tyrannical, and seemed to take particular pains
</p>
<p>to make himself obnoxious to suitors, witnesses, and all
</p>
<p>others who attended his court. It is said, however, that
</p>
<p>when in the company of those whom he fancied, he could
</p>
<p>make himself pleasant and affable. His unfortunate dispo-
</p>
<p>sition was attributed by some to domestic difficulties, which
</p>
<p>to some extent was no doubt true.
</p>
<p>After his removal from office he returned to the bar, but
</p>
<p>did not succeed in his practice, and soon became very
</p>
<p>intemperate.
</p>
<p>On his way to one of the courts in his circuit he was

</p>
<p>L. HENDRICKS AND C. S. YANCEY.
</p>
<p>It will be obvious to the reader why we make these gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen the subjects of a single sketch.
</p>
<p>In 1833 two young men crossed the Missouri River at
</p>
<p>Boonville, and wended their way on foot to the extreme
</p>
<p>south-western part of the state. As they entered the village
</p>
<p>of Springfield, in Greene County, each with a small bundle
</p>
<p>of clothes suspended at the end of a stick which they carried
</p>
<p>over the shoulder, they presented a most forlorn appearance.
</p>
<p>Upon inquiring of the village landlord if there was an attor-
</p>
<p>ney in the place, they were informed that " no such animal had
</p>
<p>yet made its appearance in those diggins, and that the people
</p>
<p>had no use for laws or lawyers." This was very encouraging
</p>
<p>to Littleberry Hendricks and Charles S. Yancey, who were in
</p>
<p>search of a location to practice. They were strangers in a
</p>
<p>strange and benighted land, without means enough to buy a
</p>
<p>good dinner at a fashionable restaurant. Hendricks was very
</p>
<p>diminutive in stature, and in appearance exceedingly unpre-
</p>
<p>possessing. Yancey was large, fine looking, with an open
</p>
<p>and pleasant countenance. Both had read Blackstone and
</p>
<p>Kent. Both had some knowledge of the statutes, and were
</p>
<p>as familiar with justices'-court practice as they were with
</p>
<p>the holes in their socks, or the patches on their butternut-
</p>
<p>colored breeches. It was very rare that a circuit court was
</p>
<p>held in that region, for all matters of difference were set-
</p>
<p>tled in justices' courts or by wager of battle. The domain
</p>
<p>belonged to Uncle Sam, and those who had squatted on his
</p>
<p>lands were " tenants by sufferance." The inhabitants had
</p>
<p>but little property, and if they could raise enough corn to
</p>
<p>make their bread and feed their cattle, and kill enough game
</p>
<p>to supply them with meat, they were content. The justice
</p>
<p>of the peace was not only a dispenser of the law, but a

<p>man who had the audacity to question his authority. A plea
</p>
<p>to his jurisdiction subjected the bold attorney to fine and
</p>
<p>imprisonment for contempt.
</p>
<p>Sure!}- this did not offer much of a prospect to these
</p>
<p>young disciples of Blackstone, but nevertheless they deter-
</p>
<p>mined to pitch their tent in the city of the Ozark Range.
</p>
<p>The only books to which they had access were the statutes
</p>
<p>and a dilapidated copy of Blackstone.
</p>
<p>In 1840 we traveled over a large part of Missouri on horse-
</p>
<p>back, and spent one or two days in Springfield, and there
</p>
<p>made the acquaintance of both of them, who were then en-
</p>
<p>joying a fair practice, and were rising rapidly in the profes-
</p>
<p>sion. The Springfield Circuit took in at least one-third of all
</p>
<p>the country south of the Missouri River, and Mr. Yancey
</p>
<p>was appointed its judge, and Mr. Hendricks prosecuting at-
</p>
<p>torney. Mr. Yancey held the office till his death, but at
</p>
<p>what time he died we are not advised ; but he had not reached
</p>
<p>the meridian of life. He made a very excellent and popular
</p>
<p>judge, was fair and impartial in his decisions, and enjoyed the
</p>
<p>full confidence of the people. He was an open-hearted and
</p>
<p>generous man, and in his intercourse with others, social,
</p>
<p>pleasant, and attractive. He was a great favorite with the
</p>
<p>bar, and it was very rare indeed that he had occasion to fine
</p>
<p>an attorney for contempt of court.
</p>
<p>Nothing tends so much to make the practice of the law
</p>
<p>agreeable as a reciprocal feeling of kindness and confidence
</p>
<p>between bench and bar, and the absence of it always leads to
</p>
<p>the obstruction of business and the delay of justice.
</p>
<p>Judge Yancey's death was greatly lamented by the people
</p>
<p>of south-western Missouri, and no one felt the blow more than
</p>
<p>Mr. Hendricks, for they had commenced their professional
</p>
<p>lives together under the same adverse circumstances, had
</p>
<p>practiced in the same courts, and a warm affection had always

</p>
<p>existed between them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hendricks, however, was in every respect a different
</p>
<p>man. He had none of Judge Yancey's social qualities, but
</p>
<p>was reserved, distant, and not easily approached. He be-

</p>
<p>came a good lawyer, and was very successful, for he prepared
</p>
<p>his cases with much care, and was seldom caught napping.
</p>
<p>He took in his range of practice almost the entire south-
</p>
<p>western part of the state, and towards the close of his life
</p>
<p>not unfrequently attended courts in three different circuits.
</p>
<p>He was not an interesting speaker, and seldom relied upon
</p>
<p>declamation as a means of success. His forte was in the
</p>
<p>examination of witnesses, in drafting instructions, and getting
</p>
<p>his case before the jury in the best light that the facts would
</p>
<p>admit of.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hendricks was a decided Whig in his politics, which
</p>
<p>afforded him but little chance for political honors, for the
</p>
<p>state was Democratic, and his part of it overwhelmingly so.
</p>
<p>When James Winston was put forward by the Whigs, in
</p>
<p>1844, as their candidate for governor, Mr. Hendricks was
</p>
<p>placed on the ticket with him for lieutenant-governor. He
</p>
<p>was, also, on several occasions placed on their electoral ticket,
</p>
<p>and was regarded as the leading man of the party in the
</p>
<p>south-western part of the state. It has been stated that Mr.
</p>
<p>Hendricks at one period made Warsaw, Benton County, his
</p>
<p>home. It is certain that he attended the Benton court.
</p>
<p>After Hamilton R. Gamble became provisional governor,
</p>
<p>he appointed Mr. Hendricks judge of the Fourteenth Ju-
</p>
<p>dicial Circuit. He discharged the duties of the office with
</p>
<p>marked ability and great satisfaction. But the position in
</p>
<p>which he rendered the greatest service to his adopted state
</p>
<p>was as a member of the Constitutional Convention which
</p>
<p>was begun and held at Jefferson City on February 28, 1861,
</p>
<p>and subsequently at St. Louis.
</p>
<p>We have already stated that this Convention was called in
</p>
<p>the interest of secession, and to force the state into the
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy ; but when the election for delegates
</p>
<p>took place, a patriotic sentiment had seized the public mind,
</p>
<p>and a large majority of the Convention were found on the

</p>
<p>Hendricks stood manfully by the government.
</p>
<p>He died in Springfield on January 10, 1863, at the age of

<p>sixty-three. The Convention was then in session, and upon

</p>
<p>hearing of his death adopted a series of resolutions, two of
</p>
<p>which we here give :
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That in the death of Judge Hendricks this Convention has lost a
</p>
<p>valued and able member, whose intellect and unyielding devotion to tlie Con-
</p>
<p>stitution and laws of the country rendered him an able, efficient member of this
</p>
<p>body ; that by his death the nation has lost a devoted patriot in this dark hour
</p>
<p>of her history, the society in which he moved an ornament, and his family
</p>
<p>an affectionate husband and father.
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That in testimony of our appreciation of the deceased, and from
</p>
<p>due regard to his memory, this Convention will now adjourn until to-morrow
</p>
<p>morning at nine o'clock, and that the members wear the usual badge of mourn-
</p>
<p>ing during the present session."
</p>
<p>Judge Hendricks was born in Virginia, about the year
</p>
<p>1800, and in early life was a mechanic  a brick-mason  and
</p>
<p>before settling in Springfield was for a short period a clerk in
</p>
<p>the office of Abiel Leonard, at Fayette, Howard County.
</p>
<p>He was a man of spotless integrity, and exceedingly liberal
</p>
<p>in his charities. He placed but little value upon money, and
</p>
<p>never sued a client for his fee. He took a bold stand in
</p>
<p>favor of temperance reformation, and both wrote and lectured
</p>
<p>upon the subject. He was a member of the old Washing-
</p>
<p>tonian Society, and afterwards joined the Sons of Temper-

<p>The Gordons.
</p>
<p>These talented brothers spent ahnost their entire profes-
</p>
<p>sional lives in Columbia, Boone County, Missouri. They
</p>
<p>were sons of David and Jane Boyle Gordon, and were born
</p>
<p>in old Millford, Madison County, Kentucky, the former in
</p>
<p>1798 and the latter in 1810, making about twelve years dif-
</p>
<p>ference in their ages. Their father was a native of North
</p>
<p>Carolina, but came to Kentucky at a very early time, and
</p>
<p>there married Jane Boyle, sister of Judge John Boyle, who
</p>
<p>for many years was chief justice of the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>Kentucky. The uKjther of our distinguished jurist, Judge
</p>
<p>Wash Adams, of Boonville, was her sister, and Boyle
</p>
<p>County, Kentucky, was named after Judge Boyle. David
</p>
<p>Gordon was a resident of Madison County, Kentucky, about
</p>
<p>thirty-six years, and in the Hill of 1826 moved with his family
</p>
<p>to a farm near Columbia, Boone County, Missouri, where
</p>
<p>he died in 1849. The education of the two brothers was
</p>
<p>extremely limited  indeed, it is said that James' entire
</p>
<p>schooling did not exceed eighteen months. John's was
</p>
<p>somewhat better, and when he became of age he opened a
</p>
<p>small school, and taught about eighteen months. He was in
</p>
<p>the habit of boasting that in this way he obtained his early
</p>
<p>education ; but it is known that with the little money he
</p>
<p>acquired from teaching, and by the aid of Colonel William
</p>
<p>H. Carpenter, an eminent lawyer in Richmond, Kentucky,
</p>
<p>he was enabled to attend the university at Lexington about
</p>
<p>fifteen months. After leaving college he entered upon the
</p>
<p>study of the law with Colonel Carpenter, and was admitted
</p>
<p>to the bar of Kentucky in 1824. In the following year he
</p>
<p>married Miss Sophia Hawkins. She came from good Revo-
</p>
<p>lutionary stock. Her father, Nicholas Hawkins, a native of
</p>
<p>Virginia, served in the army under Washington, and was at

</p>
<p>the battle of Yorktown, and witnessed the surrender of
</p>
<p>THE GORDONS. 257
</p>
<p>Cornwallis. He died in 18 16. Mrs, Gordon is still living, at
</p>
<p>the venerable age of seventy-three.
</p>
<p>In 1826 John B. came with his father to Missouri, and
</p>
<p>commenced the practice of the law in Columbia, in partner-
</p>
<p>ship with the late Governor Austin A. King. Leonard, Hay-
</p>
<p>den, Wells, Clark, Jameison, Kirtley, Davis, Rollins, Adams,
</p>
<p>McBride, Todd, and perhaps others, were his contempora-
</p>
<p>ries at the bar.
</p>
<p>At that time the two great political parties were about
</p>
<p>equally divided in Boone, and the Whig party availed itself
</p>
<p>of Mr. Gordon's ability as a stump-speaker to further its
</p>
<p>cause. In August, 1838, he was their candidate for the Leg-
</p>
<p>islature, and was elected by a small majority. He served in
</p>
<p>the Legislature five successive terms, and greatly distin-
</p>
<p>guished himself as an orator. It was, no doubt, through his
</p>
<p>exertions that Boone became the banner Whig county of the
</p>
<p>state. It was not, however, simply as an orator that he
</p>
<p>obtained reputation, for he soon enjoyed a large practice at
</p>
<p>the bar, and was regarded as one of the ablest and most suc-
</p>
<p>cessful lawyers in the state. His reputation was by no
</p>
<p>means confined to his own circuit, for he was often retained
</p>
<p>in cases pending in other circuits.
</p>
<p>As an advocate he w^as almost invincible before a jury of
</p>
<p>central Missouri. He was not only fluent, logical, and
</p>
<p>impressive, but exceedingly popular with the people, and it
</p>
<p>was difficult to impanel a jury without containing one or
</p>
<p>more of his attached friends, who felt the strongest disinclina-
</p>
<p>tion to find a verdict against him. Both brothers were men
</p>
<p>of great probity and unflinching integrity, which greatly
</p>
<p>added to their influence.
</p>
<p>By act of the Legislature of 1838, the State University
</p>
<p>was to be located in one of five counties, and the one which
</p>
<p>would subscribe the largest amount of money for its endow-
</p>
<p>ment. Mr. Gordon took a deep interest in procuring its

<p>location in Columbia, and canvassed thoroughly the sur-
</p>
<p>rounding country, and with the aid of that accomplished
</p>
<p>lawyer, James S. Rollins, and a few others, obtained a sub-
</p>
<p>scription of $120,000  an amount almost incredible when

<p>we take into consideration the sparse population and limited
</p>
<p>resources of Boone at that time. It was located in Colum-
</p>
<p>bia, and has ever since been a source of great pride to the
</p>
<p>people of Missouri. We take pleasure in here stating that
</p>
<p>one of its present learned professors, Boyle Gordon, Esq., is
</p>
<p>a son of John B. Gordon.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1840 John B. made a visit to his old
</p>
<p>home in Kentucky, and, wishing to obtain some respite from
</p>
<p>the labors of the practice, and to recruit his health, remained
</p>
<p>there three years, devoting a portion of his time to the fur-
</p>
<p>ther study of the law. During this time several students
</p>
<p>availed themselves of his instruction ; among whom was
</p>
<p>Samuel Miller, one of the present judges of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of the United States. He often said that young Mil-
</p>
<p>ler was one of the clearest-headed students he ever exam-
</p>
<p>ined. Mr. Gordon was always fond of instructing young
</p>
<p>students in the law. His brother James was one of his stu-
</p>
<p>dents, and also his nephew. General O. Guitor, who enjoys a
</p>
<p>high reputation as a lawyer.
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1843 John B. returned from Kentucky, and
</p>
<p>took up his residence on a farm near Columbia. He only
</p>
<p>partially resumed the practice, preferring to spend his time
</p>
<p>in instructing his children, and other young men who read
</p>
<p>law under him. He resisted all attempts to bring him again
</p>
<p>into public life.
</p>
<p>He died upon his farm, in February, 1853. He left four
</p>
<p>sons, the eldest of whom, Boyle Gordon, we have already
</p>
<p>mentioned as a professor in the University. He was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed professor of law in 1872, and still holds that posi-
</p>
<p>tion. A second son also studied law, and gave promise of
</p>
<p>much brilliancy, but became deranged, and has been so ever
</p>
<p>since. The remaining sons are practicing lawyers in Boone
</p>
<p>County. He also left two daughters, both of whom married.
</p>
<p>At one time, and while a member of the Legislature, John

<p>B. Gordon became somewhat intemperate, and as a rebuke
</p>
<p>to him his party refused to renominate him ; but he ran as
</p>
<p>an independent candidate, and, notwithstanding the Whig
</p>
<p>party had from 1,000 to 1,500 majority, he was triumphantly
</p>
<p>THE GORDONS. 259
</p>
<p>elected. He took his seat at the session in which Colonel
</p>
<p>Benton was reelected to the United States Senate. When
</p>
<p>the election took place, and Mr. Gordon's name was called,
</p>
<p>he deliberately rose from his seat and cried out, " Old Tom
</p>
<p>Benton, by G  d ! " His Whig friends were astounded, and
</p>
<p>when called upon for an explanation of his vote, he said " that
</p>
<p>he was elected by three classes of voters, and he aimed
</p>
<p>to represent each class." The first class embraced the in-
</p>
<p>telligent and respectable Whigs, and to represent them he
</p>
<p>voted for all the leading Whig measures which came before
</p>
<p>the House. The next class were the saloon-keepers, and to
</p>
<p>represent them he voted against the prohibitory bills. In
</p>
<p>the third class were his good Democratic friends who had
</p>
<p>supported him, and without whose votes he could not have
</p>
<p>been elected, and to represent them he voted for " Old
</p>
<p>Tom."
</p>
<p>In his lectures to law students he fixed upon a high stand-
</p>
<p>ard of morality. He contended that every student should
</p>
<p>become well versed, as a part of his legal education, in moral
</p>
<p>science and mental philosophy  favorite themes with him
</p>
<p>at all times.
</p>
<p>With but little education, James M. Gordon commenced
</p>
<p>the study of the law in the office of his brother, John, in 1833
</p>
<p>or 1834, and the first book that his preceptor placed in his
</p>
<p>hands was " Paley's Moral Philosophy." This he literally de-
</p>
<p>voured, and then took up Coke, Blackstone, and other stand-
</p>
<p>ard authors. Having a fine constitution, he devoted nearly
</p>
<p>sixteen hours per day in close study. He read nothing but
</p>
<p>law, not even the newspapers of the day. He was licensed
</p>
<p>to practice in August, 1836. He had been previously elected
</p>
<p>judge of the County Court, and served in that capacity two
</p>
<p>years. He was elected to the office of circuit attorney, and
</p>
<p>prosecuted in his circuit for a term of twelve years, giving
</p>
<p>great satisfaction to the people  for he was a most vigorous

<p>prosecutor, and a terror to all evil-doers. He mastered the
</p>
<p>criminal law, and few criminals in his district escaped pun-
</p>
<p>ishment. Having no literary taste, his reading was confined
</p>
<p>to the law, and in the law he became very profound.
</p>
<p>260 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>In 1852 and i860 he was elected to the lower house of the
</p>
<p>General Assembly, and in 1862, to the State Senate, the
</p>
<p>district embracing Boone and Callaway Counties. He re-
</p>
<p>tired from the practice of the law in 1865, and having amassed
</p>
<p>a competency, settled upon a farm, and devoted the remain-
</p>
<p>der of his days to agriculture.
</p>
<p>He died suddenly from heart disease, February 21, 1875.
</p>
<p>He was never married.
</p>
<p>James M. Gordon was the legal preceptor of several of the
</p>
<p>ablest lawyers of Missouri ; among them. Governor Charles
</p>
<p>H. Hardin, who studied with him two years, and who en-
</p>
<p>tertains the highest reverence for his memory. Charles H.
</p>
<p>Hughes, of Ray County, studied with his brother, John.
</p>
<p>Others whose names we cannot recall owe to the Gordons
</p>
<p>much of their professional success.
</p>
<p>With popular and promiscuous assemblies few men exer-
</p>
<p>cised greater powers as a speaker than John B. Gordon.
</p>
<p>When it was known that he intended to address the people
</p>
<p>on political subjects, they went r/^ uiassc to hear him, and his
</p>
<p>speech was received with one continuous applause.
</p>
<p>In 1834 a distinguished lecturer on phrenology visited
</p>
<p>Columbia, and at the conclusion of one of his discourses
</p>
<p>proposed to establish the truth of his philosophy by a public
</p>
<p>examination of the heads of any of the audience who might
</p>
<p>step forward. John B. Gordon, at the urgent request of
</p>
<p>some friends, walked upon the platform, and the professor,
</p>
<p>upon placing his hand upon his head, turned to the audience
</p>
<p>and remarked, " This is an honest man ; and I am willing to
</p>
<p>rest the truth of phrenology upon the statement." The house
</p>
<p>resounded with an approving plaudit. There is a bare possi-
</p>
<p>bility that the lecturer had seen Mr. Gordon before, but
</p>
<p>Mr. Gordon had no recollection of ever being in the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of the lecturer until that night. This circumstance is
</p>
<p>significant, not only as evidence sustaining the truth of the

</p>
<p>Gordon by the people of Columbia as an honest and upright
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>Charles French.
</p>
<p>There are very few of the old citizens of central Missouri
</p>
<p>who have not a personal recollection of this lawyer, who
</p>
<p>practiced many years in Lafayette and the adjacent coun-
</p>
<p>ties. Of his early life very little is known, for he seldom
</p>
<p>alluded to it ; and, as he never married, there is no descendant
</p>
<p>or blood relation who can speak of his boyhood or early
</p>
<p>days.
</p>
<p>It is known, however, that he was born in Dunstable, Hills-
</p>
<p>boro' County, New Hampshire, about the year 1797, and
</p>
<p>received a good English education, but never took a col-
</p>
<p>legiate course. He must have studied law a part of the time
</p>
<p>in New Hampshire, for he came to Missouri before he at-
</p>
<p>tained his majority, and shortly afterwards obtained his
</p>
<p>license and located in old Franklin, where he practiced some
</p>
<p>time, and traveled the circuit with Todd, Leonard, Hayden,
</p>
<p>Ryland, and others.
</p>
<p>In 1839 he left old Franklin and settled in Lexington,
</p>
<p>Lafayette County, where the most of his professional life was
</p>
<p>passed. He took, in his practice, all the counties of central
</p>
<p>Missouri, and attended very regularly the sessions of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court. As a lawyer he was well read, and greatly
</p>
<p>excelled in special pleading, which afforded him many ad-
</p>
<p>vantages.
</p>
<p>Upon the introduction of the Code, simplifying the system
</p>
<p>of pleading, he became very indignant, and in and out of
</p>
<p>court showed the most profound contempt for it. In the at-
</p>
<p>tempt to modify the system and get rid of many of the
</p>
<p>subtleties of pleading, the Legislature went to the other ex-
</p>
<p>treme, and by one fell swoop abolished pleading altogether.
</p>
<p>It enacted (with very few exceptions) that the only plea that
</p>
<p>a defendant was required to file was a simple denial of the

<p>defense, tendered no issue, and left the court and jury to
</p>
<p>grovel in the dark with respect to the matter they were to
</p>
<p>try. So absurd was its practical operation that the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture was forced to repeal it, and to substitute what is known
</p>
<p>as the New York Code, w^ith such amendments and modi-
</p>
<p>fications as experience proved necessary.
</p>
<p>Mr. French was in no sense an orator, though his style of
</p>
<p>speaking was lucid, strong, and argumentative, and before a
</p>
<p>court or jury at times very impressive. He was a man of
</p>
<p>fine personal appearance, at least six feet high, well propor-
</p>
<p>tioned, and would readily attract the notice of a stranger.
</p>
<p>In his manner he was distant and reserved, but by his ac-
</p>
<p>quaintances easily approached, and his attachment to his
</p>
<p>friends was warm and steadfast.
</p>
<p>We are not aware that he ever held any public position,
</p>
<p>though Governor Boggs tendered him the judgeship of his
</p>
<p>circuit, which he declined. Towards the close of his life,
</p>
<p>and after spending many years in the South, he became
</p>
<p>despondent and melancholy, and at times imagined that
</p>
<p>there was a purpose on hand to assassinate him. This con-
</p>
<p>tinued to prey upon his mind, and in a fit of mental de-
</p>
<p>rangement he cut his throat while visiting a friend in the
</p>
<p>vicinity of Lexington, and thus terminated his life. At the
</p>
<p>time of his death he must have been near sixty-five years of

<p>age.
</p>
<p>Willis L. Williams,
</p>
<p>One of the most eminent and popular members of the St.
</p>
<p>Louis bar, was born in WilHamsboro', North CaroHna, Decem-
</p>
<p>ber 28, 1809. He was a graduate of Amherst College, and
</p>
<p>received a finished education. Soon after graduating he re-
</p>
<p>paired to Washington City, and commenced the study of the
</p>
<p>law in the office of Joseph Bradley, a distinguished lawyer of
</p>
<p>that city. The chief object in going to Washington was to
</p>
<p>enable him to attend the debates in Congress  an advantage
</p>
<p>that few students are permitted to enjoy. He attended the
</p>
<p>sessions almost daily, and scarcely ever missed being present
</p>
<p>on any important debate. He kept a memorandum-book by
</p>
<p>him, and noted down the peculiarities of each speaker, which
</p>
<p>was of great aid to him in the study of elocution. He heard
</p>
<p>Webster, Clay, Calhoun, and Benton in some of their finest
</p>
<p>efforts, and his admiration of Webster and Clay was un-
</p>
<p>bounded. While he could not hope to rival either, yet he
</p>
<p>made them his model. We have often heard him say that
</p>
<p>he would rather be a Clay or a Webster than to sit on the
</p>
<p>proudest throne of Europe. His admiration of these distin-
</p>
<p>guished men no doubt determined his political status, for
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>during life he was a steadfast and consistent Whig.
</p>
<p>Mr. Williams first located in the practice in Paris, Ten-
</p>
<p>nessee, the abode of some of his relations, and in a short
</p>
<p>time received the appointment of prosecuting attorney for
</p>
<p>that circuit ; but the location did not present such a field for
</p>
<p>an ambitious young lawyer as he desired, and in 1842 he
</p>
<p>removed to St. Louis, where he remained till his death.
</p>
<p>His genial habits and attractive manners soon brought him
</p>
<p>many warm friends, and he at once entered upon a suc-
</p>
<p>cessful professional career. The revising session of the
</p>
<p>Legislature of 1844-5 brought together at the state capital

</p>
<p>a body of men who have not since been excelled for
</p>
<p>264 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>high professional attainments. Among them were Mr. Will-
</p>
<p>iams, Hamilton R. Gamble, DeWitt C. Ballou, Sinclair Kirt-
</p>
<p>ley, Charles J. Hughes, Benjamin F. Stringfellow, Rich-
</p>
<p>ard F. Richmond, Bela M. Hughes, Gilchrist Porter, John
</p>
<p>D. Coalter, and many others of prominence. We had the
</p>
<p>honor of representing in part the county of Franklin, and
</p>
<p>there first met Mr. Williams, who soon became one of
</p>
<p>the acknowledged leaders of the House. His fine per-
</p>
<p>sonal appearance, winning manners, and unrivalled conver-
</p>
<p>sational powers made him a favorite with the members, and
</p>
<p>it was no easy matter to defeat any bill of which he was the
</p>
<p>author and advocate. He took a deep interest in every-
</p>
<p>thing that pertained to woman's rights, and introduced sev-
</p>
<p>eral bills to protect their property from the creditors of the
</p>
<p>husband, some of which became laws, and are now on our
</p>
<p>statute-book. Whenever it was known that one of Mr. Will-
</p>
<p>iams' bills was to come up for consideration, the lobby be-
</p>
<p>came crowded with ladies, and he would lead off in one of
</p>
<p>those beautiful strains of eloquence for which he was re-
</p>
<p>nowned. The ladies would wave their handkerchiefs, and
</p>
<p>loudly cheer him. Sometimes they would assemble in the
</p>
<p>lobby in large numbers, and would petition him for a speech,
</p>
<p>when he would call up one of his bills to entertain them.
</p>
<p>With this lobby influence, and his personal popularity, he ex-
</p>
<p>ercised a power in legislation which was never acquired by
</p>
<p>any other man before or since in this state. He was a very
</p>
<p>handsome man, dressed neatly and with much taste, and in
</p>
<p>conversation he was brilliant and entertaining. Upon the
</p>
<p>stage he would have made a star of the first magnitude. His
</p>
<p>fund of humor and anecdote was inexhaustible, and in what-
</p>
<p>ever company he was thrown he was its life and spirit.
</p>
<p>We recall one incident which, though trivial in itself,
</p>
<p>tends to show his resources for fun and amusement. During
</p>
<p>the session of the Legislature just referred to, mesmerism

</p>
<p>was at its height, and afforded much merriment at all parties
</p>
<p>and social gatherings. Upon one of these occasions we
</p>
<p>accompanied Mr. Williams, and found assembled about
</p>
<p>twenty ladies and half the number of gentlemen. Mr. Will-
</p>
<p>WILLIS L. WILLIAMS. 265
</p>
<p>iams for that evening was to be the master of ceremonies,
</p>
<p>and when the time arrived for the curtain to rise, he placed
</p>
<p>a chair in the center of the room, and invited any one
</p>
<p>who wished to be mesmerized to take the seat. Several
</p>
<p>accepted the invitation, and finally a very modest young
</p>
<p>lady, and as beautiful as she was modest, cried out, " You
</p>
<p>can't put me to sleep, Mr. Williams." " Let me try," said
</p>
<p>Williams ; and with the grace of a Chesterfield he conducted
</p>
<p>the young lady to the chair, and after a few manipulations
</p>
<p>she began to draw a long breath, and soon her eyelids closed.
</p>
<p>" Now," said Mr. Williams, " I will satisfy the most skeptical
</p>
<p>in the room that mesmerism is a fixed fact, an established
</p>
<p>science, and as capable of demonstration as astronomy or
</p>
<p>any other admitted science. Now, you all know if this young
</p>
<p>lady was sensible of what was transpiring, she would not let
</p>
<p>me, a married man, kiss her; but now I will approach and
</p>
<p>salute her, and when she is aroused from her trance she will
</p>
<p>be totally unconscious of what has transpired; " and, suiting
</p>
<p>the action to the word, he approached the chair and gave the
</p>
<p>subject a smack upon the lips which might have been heard
</p>
<p>half a square. Not a muscle of her face moved, and to all
</p>
<p>appearances she was as inanimate as a piece of chiseled mar-
</p>
<p>ble. Governor Gamble and the author were invited by Mr.
</p>
<p>Williams to partake of the feast, for it was a feast fit for the
</p>
<p>gods. How could we decline, for both of us were enlisted in
</p>
<p>the cause of science. In turn we repeated Mr. Williams' ex-
</p>
<p>periment, with a like result. Mr. Williams then took one more
</p>
<p>taste of the nectar, and by a reverse motion of his hand
</p>
<p>aroused the young lady from her quiet dream, and asked her
</p>
<p>if she knew what had transpired. Of course she did not.
</p>
<p>After leaving the house in company with Mr. Williams, the
</p>
<p>first thing he said was, "/j." not inestnerism a delicious Jiiun-
</p>
<p>bug?-
</p>
<p>There was a charm about Mr. Williams that few men

</p>
<p>could resist. It proceeded from his pleasant manners, unsur-
</p>
<p>passed conversational powers, and his copious fund of humor
</p>
<p>and anecdote. He would relate anecdote after anecdote,
</p>
<p>and keep a company in a roar of laughter, while he himself
</p>
<p>266 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>looked as grave as a judge passing sentence of death upon
</p>
<p>a prisoner. It was one of his greatest dehghts to make all
</p>
<p>who came in contact with him look upon the bright page of
</p>
<p>life. To drive dull care away was his forte and province.
</p>
<p>Mr. Williams was very enthusiastic in everything he
</p>
<p>undertook. During the latter part of the session a religious
</p>
<p>revival took place in Jefferson City, embracing all denomina-
</p>
<p>tions, and in which a very deep interest was felt. Mr. Will-
</p>
<p>iams attended all the meetings, frequently addressed the as-
</p>
<p>sembly, and was doubtless the cause of many conyersions.
</p>
<p>No one doubted his sincerity, for he had not a deceitful hair
</p>
<p>in his head. He was naturally a religious man, though we
</p>
<p>are not informed as to whether he ever made any formal
</p>
<p>connection with the Church.
</p>
<p>His heart overflowed with kindness to all mankind, and he
</p>
<p>cheerfully gave up his last dollar to the call of charity.
</p>
<p>There was nothing on earth that he would not do for a friend, if
</p>
<p>in his power. He gave far more cheerfully than he received.
</p>
<p>His practice was large, and brought him a good income; but
</p>
<p>he knew nothing of the value of money, and never could lay
</p>
<p>up anything for a rainy day. He looked at the bright side
</p>
<p>of everything, always seemed happy, and tried to make every
</p>
<p>one else happy.
</p>
<p>As a lawyer he ranked high at the bar, and was generally
</p>
<p>retained in important land suits, for he had given that branch
</p>
<p>of the law his chief attention. As a speaker he possessed
</p>
<p>many of the qualities necessary to lead the passions of a
</p>
<p>jury. His diction was pure, his gesticulation easy and nat-
</p>
<p>ural, his voice clear and well modulated, and at times he was
</p>
<p>impressive and eloquent.
</p>
<p>In the case of Miss Fant vs. Dr. Wells, of Lincoln, a
</p>
<p>breach of promise case pending in the Warren Circuit Court,
</p>
<p>his address to the jury was regarded by the bar as a master-
</p>
<p>piece of forensic display.

</p>
<p>In society no man was so popular, and he was in con-
</p>
<p>stant demand at all public and private dinner-parties, for
</p>
<p>he excelled all others in entertaining a company. His re-
</p>
<p>sponses to a toast were always happy and appropriate, and
</p>
<p>WILLIS L. WILLIAMS. 267
</p>
<p>not unfrequently very instructive. His constant attendance
</p>
<p>upon occasions of this kind no doubt brought on the disease
</p>
<p>which terminated his life.
</p>
<p>He never sought office, but rather avoided it, and we are
</p>
<p>not aware of his holding any except those above mentioned,
</p>
<p>and the office of city counselor of St. Louis, which he held
</p>
<p>in 1856, though he was selected by President Fillmore as
</p>
<p>one of the annual committee to visit West Point.
</p>
<p>He died in St. Louis quite suddenly, on March 29, 1857,
</p>
<p>in his forty-eighth year.
</p>
<p>Two or three days before Mr. Williams' death he was
</p>
<p>engaged in the argument of a cause in the Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>apparently in his usual health, but suffering from a pain in
</p>
<p>his side, resulting from some disorganization of his liver, and
</p>
<p>it was only on the day of his death that serious apprehen-
</p>
<p>sions were entertained in regard to his condition. His death,
</p>
<p>therefore, fell upon the community with great surprise, and
</p>
<p>was a great shock to his friends.
</p>
<p>It is usual on such occasions for the bar to assemble to pay
</p>
<p>a tribute of respect to the memory of the deceased, which
</p>
<p>often is an unfeeling and empty honor; but not so on the
</p>
<p>occasion of Mr. Williams' death. The court-room in which
</p>
<p>the meeting was held was densely crowded, and among the
</p>
<p>audience could be seen the faces of the oldest members of
</p>
<p>the profession. As one after the other rose to express their
</p>
<p>profound sorrow, and proclaim his many virtues, not a dr}^
</p>
<p>eye in the room could be seen. It was' a most solemn occa-
</p>
<p>sion, and elicited tributes from Edward Bates, Charles D.
</p>
<p>Drake, John M. Krum, John D. Coalter, J. F. Darby, N. D.
</p>
<p>Strong, L. V. Bogy, Wilson Primm, A. J. P. Garesche, and
</p>
<p>others who had known him during his professional life and
</p>
<p>were in the habit of meeting him daily in the court-room.
</p>
<p>We give a few extracts to show the high estimate they placed
</p>
<p>on him.

<p>P2dward Bates, as chairman of a committee to draft reso-
</p>
<p>lutions expressive of the sense of the meeting, in making his
</p>
<p>report, said :
</p>
<p>268 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>" With tlie single exception of one man at tlie St. Louis bar, I am now the
</p>
<p>oldest member of it. As was said l)y an able man, ' I stand in the midst of
</p>
<p>posterity.' I am surrounded by my juniors in age and in the profession. I
</p>
<p>have witnessed from time to time tlie passing away of a great number of our
</p>
<p>brethren, beginning with the very first who ever practiced common law in
</p>
<p>Upper Louisiana  Easton and others  many of whom have been lights of the
</p>
<p>profession, and excellent examples for those who followed; several of whom, at
</p>
<p>least, have not been surpassed by any of the profession west of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi. They are all gone. It seems to me as if I were walking among the grave-
</p>
<p>stones of my former associates. * * * I have known Mr. Williams from
</p>
<p>the first month of his residence here ; a man of warm impulses, of active heart ;
</p>
<p>sometimes impulsive, but even then it occurred to me his fault leant to virtue's
</p>
<p>side. His success at the bar shows at least his (jualification, and even when he
</p>
<p>gave offense, as we all sometimes do, the kindness of his heart won back the
</p>
<p>affections of him he may have offended. Mr. Williams belonged to a family
</p>
<p>remarkable for their success in life  many of them eminent in their old native
</p>
<p>state of North Carolina, some since in south Tennessee, and he was pursuing
</p>
<p>here a course that might have rendered illustrious his own name."
</p>
<p>The Hon. Charles D. Drake, now presiding justice of the
</p>
<p>Court of Claims at Washington City, thus alluded to him :
</p>
<p>"I think we do no more, Mr. Chairman, than simple justice to our deceased
</p>
<p>brother in the resolutions which have been presented. I think that he was in
</p>
<p>many respects a very remarkable man  certainly remarkable in the amiability
</p>
<p>of his disposition, in his uniform courtesy, in his genial courtesy, which made
</p>
<p>him an associate beloved by those with whom he was associated. He was, as
</p>
<p>a mere lawyer, much above mediocrity ; and, sir. I feel, for one, that our bar
</p>
<p>cannot at any time lose such a man without sustaining a loss that is not easily
</p>
<p>repaired."
</p>
<p>Colonel L. V. Bogy, late United States senator, followed
</p>
<p>with some very feeling remarks. We give a short extract :
</p>
<p>"I knew Willis L. Williams when I was a practitioner; we were frequently
</p>
<p>associated together, and I can bear this testimony to him : a more upright, gen-
</p>
<p>erous, more noble man I never met. That Mr. Williams was the creature of
</p>
<p>impulse we all know, but he hail no mean impulses, lie had no low and

</p>
<p>gi-oveling, unworthy, ungenerous impulses ; they were such as always have
</p>
<p>something redeeming about them. That he was a lawyer of more than ordi-
</p>
<p>nary abilities cannot be denied. He was a man of genius, and endowed with a
</p>
<p>tine intellect."
</p>
<p>Other members of the bar addressed the meeting, and all
</p>
<p>spoke of him in terms of the highest praise. A committee
</p>
<p>WILLIS L. WILLIAMS. 269
</p>
<p>was appointed to present the resolutions of the meeting to
</p>
<p>the several courts of record, with a request that they be
</p>
<p>spread upon the records.
</p>
<p>General J. D. Coalter was appointed for the United States
</p>
<p>Circuit Court, and, in presenting them to the court, said,
</p>
<p>among other things :
</p>
<p>" His abilities gave him unusual success. Possessed of an acute mind and
</p>
<p>great powei-s of discrimination and research, his argument fell with weight upon
</p>
<p>the ears of judges learned in the law, while with jurors his copious flow of lan-
</p>
<p>guage, warm with his own ardent and generous feelings, found ready and favor-
</p>
<p>able reception. Thus gifted, his success was far above ordinary. But not less
</p>
<p>than his abilities as a lawyer were his social qualities. His kindness of heart;
</p>
<p>his ready, cheerful, ofttimes brilliant, conversational powers; his ability to enter
</p>
<p>into and contril:)Ute largely to the enjoyment of the hour, endeared him greatly
</p>
<p>to his associates."
</p>
<p>Albert Todd, who for a quarter of a century has been an
</p>
<p>eminent lawyer at the St. Louis bar, presented the resolu-
</p>
<p>tions to the Land Court, and we here give a few lines of his
</p>
<p>address :
</p>
<p>"The decease of our brother is singularly affecting and impressive to us all.
</p>
<p>While he would compare well with our most experienced brethren in professional
</p>
<p>abilities, he excelled them all, in my humble estimation, in agreeable social
</p>
<p>qualities. His was a rare spirit for relieving the hard and dry work of profes-
</p>
<p>sional labors with the enlivenment of a dry humor and cheerful jest. All of us
</p>
<p>were glad to cjuit any labor, however pressing, to enjoy the cheerful entertain-
</p>
<p>ment of his inexhaustible anecdote and pleasing reminiscences."
</p>
<p>Judge Wilson Primm, who has very recently passed from
</p>
<p>our midst, tendered the resolutions to the Criminal Court,
</p>
<p>and paid a most beautiful tribute to the memory of the
</p>
<p>deceased. Said he :
</p>
<p>"Willis L. Williams, a brilliant star in the profession to which we belong,
</p>
<p>an ornament to the society in which he moved, a kind father and fast friend, has
</p>
<p>been suddenly snatched away from our midst, even as the magnificent tree is up-
</p>
<p>rooted and shattered by the sudden and unexpected storm. The memory of

</p>
<p>those departed, although ever mingled with sadness, still yet retains a shade of
</p>
<p>pleasure : sadness, because of the loss of those whom we have known and loved ;
</p>
<p>and pleasure, because of the recollection of those traits of character which
</p>
<p>caused us to love and admire.
</p>
<p>" Such are the feelings of the members of the St. Louis bar toward their de-
</p>
<p>ceased brother. They grieve that one of their number, in the prime of life, in
</p>
<p>2/0 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>the onward way to distinction in his profession, should, Ijy a decree of an in-
</p>
<p>scrutable Providence, be wrested from their midst. But it is a pleasure to them
</p>
<p>when they remember that, in ail his walk of life, his friends could proclaim him
</p>
<p>a lawyer in the amplest sense of the term, a gentleman, and a Christian. A
</p>
<p>long and intimate association as his room-mate taught me to appreciate his
</p>
<p>qualities of heart and mind, and now that he is cold in death, and cannot hear
</p>
<p>my words, I feci a joyful satisfaction in saying that in every relation of life he
</p>
<p>was a man."
</p>
<p>At the time of Mr. Williams' death we were absent from
</p>
<p>St. Louis, and consequently prevented from mingling our
</p>
<p>voice with those who deeply and sincere^ mourned his death.
</p>
<p>" Death steals along with silent tread,
</p>
<p>Found oftenest in what least we dread ;
</p>
<p>Frowns in the storm with angry brow.

<p>But in the sunshine strikes the blow."
</p>
<p>JOHN F. RYLAND.
</p>
<p>Nothing connected with these memoirs has afforded us
</p>
<p>more gratification than the opportunity they furnish to place
</p>
<p>upon record even a meager sketch of one of God's noble-
</p>
<p>men, the late John F. Ryland, of Lexington, Missouri, whose
</p>
<p>whole life was spent in doing good to his fellow-man, whose
</p>
<p>mind was a store-house of varied learning, and whose bright
</p>
<p>judicial career has done so much to adorn the jurisprudence
</p>
<p>of our state.
</p>
<p>We knew him long and well ; saw him in all the relations
</p>
<p>of life ; practiced before him w-hen he graced the bench of
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court ; and, when by the voice of the people
</p>
<p>we were elevated to the same position, had the pleasure of
</p>
<p>listening to many of his fine forensic efforts.
</p>
<p>Judge Ryland bore the judicial robe with a dignity suited
</p>
<p>to the high and responsible position  neither strained nor
</p>
<p>assumed, but easy, natural, and commanding. He was
</p>
<p>born a gentleman, and to assume anything else was revolting
</p>
<p>to his nature. No sudden change in life, no sudden eleva-
</p>
<p>tion to power, effected the slightest change in his habits or
</p>
<p>demeanor. The pleasant and affable manner in which he
</p>
<p>greeted every person who approached him made him a uni-
</p>
<p>versal favorite with the people and the bar. Nothing could
</p>
<p>give him more pain than the thought of having said or done
</p>
<p>anything to wound the feelings of another.

<p>John Ferguson Ryland was born in King and Queen
</p>
<p>County, Virginia, near the banks of the Rappahannock, on
</p>
<p>November 2. 1797, and was the oldest child of Joseph and
</p>
<p>Rosamiah Molly Ryland. When he was but twelve years of
</p>
<p>age his father moved to Richmond County, Kentucky, and
</p>
<p>shortly after died, leaving a widow and seven children. They
</p>
<p>lived on a small farm, the cultivation of which was their chief

</p>
<p>John was fond of books, had read much, and took great
</p>
<p>deHght in imparting to other boys the information he had
</p>
<p>thus acquired. When he was sent out to work with other
</p>
<p>hands, he would frequently get on a stump, with all hands
</p>
<p>around him, and relate the wonderful deeds of Julius Ca;sar,
</p>
<p>Hannibal, and other famous warriors of antiquity.
</p>
<p>His mother soon discovered that his knowledge of ancient
</p>
<p>history was of no particular advantage to the cultivation of
</p>
<p>the farm, so she determined to give him a good education,
</p>
<p>and sent him to Forest Hill Academy, in Marion County,
</p>
<p>Kentucky, then under the superintendence of Samuel Wil-
</p>
<p>son, Esq., a fine scholar and linguist; and at this institution
</p>
<p>he acquired a thorough knowledge of Latin, and in fact be-
</p>
<p>came very well versed in the classics. Through life he could
</p>
<p>read Latin with as much fluency as his own language, and
</p>
<p>his knowledge of ancient history was wonderful.
</p>
<p>To show his gratitude to his mother fcrr affording him
</p>
<p>these advantages, he applied himself to the education of
</p>
<p>his younger brothers and sisters ; and, to enable him to
</p>
<p>do so to advantage, opened a school, and at one time
</p>
<p>had as many as 120 scholars, among whom was that ac-
</p>
<p>complished scholar and orator. Major James S. Rollins, of
</p>
<p>Columbia, Missouri. In after-life, when both became dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished, the judge, in the presence of his pupil and sev-
</p>
<p>eral friends, remarked in a jocular way that the first letter
</p>
<p>the major learned was the letter I, and it would be the last
</p>
<p>he would forget.
</p>
<p>Judge Ryland read law in Kentucky with Judge Hardin,
</p>
<p>and although he obtained a license to practice in that state,
</p>
<p>did not enter upon his profession until he came to Missouri,
</p>
<p>in 1 8 19. He settled in old Franklin, Howard County, and
</p>
<p>traveled the circuit with Todd, Leonard, Gamble, et al., and
</p>
<p>in our sketch of Peyton R. Hayden is mentioned as one of
</p>
<p>the chief conspirators in the plot to rob Judge David Todd

<p>of the affections of the buxom widow.
</p>
<p>Judge Ryland soon obtained a lucrative practice, which
</p>
<p>continued until 1830, when he was appointed judge of the
</p>
<p>Sixth Judicial Circuit, a position he held for eighteen con-
</p>
<p>JOHN F. KYLAND. 273
</p>
<p>secutiv^e years, proving himself one of the ablest nisi-priiis
</p>
<p>judges that ever graced the bench of Missouri. Upon his
</p>
<p>appointment he moved to Lexington, in Lafayette County,
</p>
<p>which continued to be his residence throughout life.
</p>
<p>In 1848 he was appointed judge of the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>which position he held till 1857, when he returned to the
</p>
<p>practice, which he continued until his death, on September
</p>
<p>10, 1873. In 1866 he was induced to take a seat in the Leg-
</p>
<p>islature, but the incessant party wrangling and strife which
</p>
<p>usually prevails in a body of that kind proved very distaste-
</p>
<p>ful to him, and after serving one session he returned to Lex-
</p>
<p>ington, with a determination never again to engage in legis-
</p>
<p>lation.
</p>
<p>Judge Ryland was excessively fond of the law, but his
</p>
<p>kind heart and pacific disposition often led him to discourage
</p>
<p>suits which in his opinion were calculated to engender strife
</p>
<p>and bad feeling among neighbors and in families.
</p>
<p>We give one instance, which is only one in a hundred :
</p>
<p>A man belonging to an influential family called upon him to
</p>
<p>institute a suit against a brother for slander. The judge
</p>
<p>listened attentively to his complaint, and then told him to
</p>
<p>go home and fall on his knees three times a day for a
</p>
<p>week, and pray to God to forgive him for harboring so
</p>
<p>unkind a feeling for his brother; and if at the end of that
</p>
<p>time he was still determined to institute the suit, to return to
</p>
<p>him, and they would consult further about it. The man
</p>
<p>looked at him with amazement, and remarked, " That is
</p>
<p>strange counsel for a lawyer to give." " Yes " said the judge,
</p>
<p>"but it is the best I can now give you." Before the expira-
</p>
<p>tion of the week the man returned, and told the judge that
</p>
<p>he had concluded not to bring the suit.
</p>
<p>He was often called upon to settle disputes among neigh-
</p>
<p>bors, and was often heard to say that he would rather give
</p>
<p>^100 out of his own pocket to avoid a suit between neighbors

<p>than to gain $500 by the prosecution of one.
</p>
<p>Such was the confidence reposed in his high appreciation
</p>
<p>of what was just and fair between parties that, when any
</p>
<p>matter of difference was referred to him, all acquiesced in his
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>2/4 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>decision as the only fair and proper solution of the diffi-
</p>
<p>culty.
</p>
<p>When the Rebellion broke out, he did not hesitate to side
</p>
<p>with the Union ; but, anxious to adopt any plan that would
</p>
<p>arrest the threatened calamity, he advocated the " Critten-
</p>
<p>den Compromise." He regarded the war as a great national
</p>
<p>calamity, and could hardly speak of it without evincing a
</p>
<p>deep, heartfelt distress. It no doubt shortened his life by
</p>
<p>many years. In one of his law-books was found, after his
</p>
<p>death, in his own handwriting and signed by him, the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing paper :
</p>
<p>''War, always corrupting to republics; may our country from henceforth
</p>
<p>forever, with honor, escape its horrors  especially the horrors of civil war."
</p>
<p>In politics the judge was a Democrat, but always mani-
</p>
<p>fested a proper respect for the opinions of others. We have
</p>
<p>on several occasions heard him say " that it was necessary,
</p>
<p>under our form of government, that there should be at least
</p>
<p>two great political parties  one to watch the other."
</p>
<p>He was a member of the Old School Presbyterian Church,
</p>
<p>and died in the full faith of a glorious resurrection. He was
</p>
<p>an honored member of the Masonic fraternity, and filled the
</p>
<p>position of grand master of the Grand Lodge of Missouri for
</p>
<p>two years.
</p>
<p>Judge Ryland was one of the finest historians of his day,
</p>
<p>and took great delight in rehearsing his early recollection of
</p>
<p>Kentucky and Missouri. In speaking of the rapid growth
</p>
<p>of St. Louis, he once remarked that while on a visit to the
</p>
<p>city, in 1825, he was riding out one afternoon on a fine horse,
</p>
<p>and halting on Third Street, not fiir from the location of the
</p>
<p>old City Hotel, an acquaintance accosted him, and said, " I
</p>
<p>will give you forty arpents of land (mentioning the tract) for
</p>
<p>your horse." Ryland, remembering his family far away up
</p>
<p>the Missouri River, and that his only means of reaching them
</p>
<p>was by the faithful animal thus coveted, replied, " I would

</p>
<p>not trade my horse for your whole town." The land offered
</p>
<p>is now in the heart of the city, and worth many millions of
</p>
<p>dollars.
</p>
<p>JOHN F. RYLAND. 275
</p>
<p>Judge Ryland lived a good portion of his life upon a farm,
</p>
<p>but he could not be called a successful farmer, for, like Ed-
</p>
<p>ward Bates, he often said that it took all that lawyer Ryland
</p>
<p>could make to support farmer Ryland. He was married
</p>
<p>twice ; raised a large family of children, twelve of whom are
</p>
<p>still living. Three of his sons are practicing lawyers.
</p>
<p>Judge Ryland was a man of a very high sense of honor,
</p>
<p>and of the most noble and generous impulses. He could
</p>
<p>not pass a beggar on the street without giving him some-
</p>
<p>thing. His heart was always bleeding for the troubles and
</p>
<p>tribulations of others, and his innumerable charities, added
</p>
<p>to the expenses of a large family, kept him poor through
</p>
<p>life. The kindness of his heart extended even to animals,
</p>
<p>for he could scarcely ever be induced to sell a horse or cow
</p>
<p>for fear they might fall into the hands of some one who
</p>
<p>would not bestow upon them the kind treatment they were
</p>
<p>accustomed to.
</p>
<p>It is no easy task to estimate the value of sucli a life as
</p>
<p>Judge Ryland's. Twenty-seven years on the bench, actively
</p>
<p>engaged in administering the law, without a murmur of com-
</p>
<p>plaint from any source, speaks louder in his praise than any
</p>
<p>language we can employ. His death created a profound
</p>
<p>sensation throughout the state, for no man was better known,
</p>
<p>and none more universally reverenced.
</p>
<p>When we saw him last he had reached an age which few
</p>
<p>of us can hope to attain, yet his mind continued active and
</p>
<p>vigorous. The loss of such a man is a public calamity.
</p>
<p>The first opinion delivered from the supreme bench by
</p>
<p>Judge Ryland was in case of Bryan et al. vs. Steamboat
</p>
<p>Pride of the West, reported in 12th Missouri Reports, page
</p>
<p>371, in which it was held that, under the statutes of this
</p>
<p>state concerning boats and vessels, no lien attaches upon a
</p>
<p>boat for money borrowed by the master to pay the debts of
</p>
<p>the boat. The case, which was argued by Mr. Geyer for

<p>appellant, and Gamble and Bates for appellee, involved an
</p>
<p>important question, and drew from Judge Ryland quite an
</p>
<p>elaborate opinion.
</p>
<p>The duty of writing the opinions of the court in criminal

</p>
<p>cases, particularly when life was at stake, was generally im-
</p>
<p>posed upon him, for the reason that he was an adept in
</p>
<p>criminal law, and had given that branch of the profession
</p>
<p>more time than his associate judges. His opinions, however,
</p>
<p>in capital cases are liable to much criticism by reason of
</p>
<p>their prolixity  an error to be attributed to his anxiety to
</p>
<p>justify himself in pronouncing the sentence of death.
</p>
<p>Take, for example, the case of The State vs. Worrel, re-
</p>
<p>ported in 25th Missouri Reports, in which we prosecuted for
</p>
<p>the state, and obtained a conviction of murder in the first
</p>
<p>degree. Major Uriel Wright, who appeared for the defense,
</p>
<p>took an appeal to the Supreme Court, and relied for a re-
</p>
<p>versal upon two supposed errors of the court below, one of
</p>
<p>which related to the qualification of a juror, and the other to
</p>
<p>the overruling of a motion for a continuance  neither
</p>
<p>having any relation to the merits of the case. Yet the judge
</p>
<p>embodied in his opinion all the evidence taken, consuming
</p>
<p>upwards of forty pages of the volume of the Reports. It is
</p>
<p>patent to any one who will read the decision that his object
</p>
<p>was to show the enormity of the offense committed, for it
</p>
<p>was one of the most aggravated cases of cold-blooded mur-

<p>der that the annals of crime furnish.
</p>
<p>The Bartons.
</p>
<p>These brothers obtained an enviable distinction at the St.
</p>
<p>Louis bar, even prior to our admission into the Union as a
</p>
<p>state. They were born in Green County, Tennessee, of poor
</p>
<p>but respectable parentage, and with very limited educational
</p>
<p>means. As neither of them ever married, they left no one to
</p>
<p>inherit their names or impart any information respecting the
</p>
<p>time of their birth, or to give any incidents of their boyhood.
</p>
<p>They came into our territory at an early period, and David,
</p>
<p>the senior of his brother, was an Indian ranger in the War of
</p>
<p>1812. Joshua studied law in the office of Rufus Easton, but
</p>
<p>we are unable to give the time when either was admitted to
</p>
<p>the bar.
</p>
<p>Colonel Easton predicted that David would make his mark
</p>
<p>in the field of oratory. This prediction was soon verified,
</p>
<p>for he became so noted as a forensic speaker that his party
</p>
<p>almost by acclamation elected him as the first senator from
</p>
<p>Missouri. He was then the most popular man in the state.
</p>
<p>Colonel Benton was elected as his colleague, but by a major-
</p>
<p>ity of only one vote. Prior to Mr. Barton's elevation to the
</p>
<p>Senate he was chosen a delegate to the State Convention
</p>
<p>called to frame a constitution preparatory to our admission as
</p>
<p>a state. The Convention met in 1820, and Mr. Barton was
</p>
<p>selected as the presiding officer.
</p>
<p>His fame as a debater preceded him to Washington, and
</p>
<p>the first speech he made in the Senate attracted universal
</p>
<p>attention. It was during the delivery of this speech that he
</p>
<p>acquired the name of "Little Red." A man in the gallery,
</p>
<p>who was known as a sportsman and chicken-fighter, became
</p>
<p>so elated by his eloquence that he cried out at the top of his
</p>
<p>voice, " Go it, my little red ! " From that day he was scarcely
</p>
<p>known among his friends by any other name, and through
</p>
<p>life he exhibited, himself, a partiality for it.

</p>
<p>He was a small man, of low stature, with broad shoulders
</p>
<p>2/8 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>and high forehead, and an intellectual cast of countenance.
</p>
<p>For a man of his defective education, he had a good com-
</p>
<p>mand of language, but what gave liim his chief reputation as
</p>
<p>an orator was his sarcasm, invective, and wit. When he chose
</p>
<p>to employ these against an adversary, he was terrific and
</p>
<p>overpowering. In logic and deep thought, and in general
</p>
<p>information, his colleague far excelled him, but was his
</p>
<p>inferior in imagery, pathos, and vehement declamation.
</p>
<p>Joshua, though far less eloquent, was more profound in the
</p>
<p>law, and more of a logician. Mr. Bates frequently expressed
</p>
<p>the opinion that Joshua Barton had the best legal mind at
</p>
<p>the St. Louis bar, and he was not alone in that opinion.
</p>
<p>David Barton served ten years in the Senate, and then be-
</p>
<p>came a candidate for the House of Representatives, and was
</p>
<p>defeated by Spencer Pettis. He was supported by the old
</p>
<p>Adams party, in consideration of the support he gave Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams in his contest for the presidency, against General
</p>
<p>Jackson, in the House of Representatives in 1825. Though
</p>
<p>elected to the Senate as a Democrat, he urged John Scott,
</p>
<p>who was the sole representative from Missouri, to cast the vote
</p>
<p>of the state for Mr. Adams. Colonel Benton strongly advo-
</p>
<p>cated the election of Jackson, and this brought about an
</p>
<p>estrangement between the two senators. A letter upon this
</p>
<p>subject, written by Mr. Barton shortly after the election, will
</p>
<p>be found in the Appendix. Neither Scott nor Barton were
</p>
<p>ever able to reinstate themselves in public favor, and both
</p>
<p>were forced to retire from public life. Mr. Barton, however,
</p>
<p>served in the State Senate for a short period, about 1834-5.
</p>
<p>We have omitted to state that David Barton at one time
</p>
<p>was judge of the Circuit Court, but resigned in December,
</p>
<p>1817. He never made much reputation as a jurist. During
</p>
<p>most of his public life he was very intemperate. He died
</p>
<p>near Boonville, in Cooper County, in September, 1837.
</p>
<p>For a short time after the state government was formed,

<p>Joshua Barton was secretary of state, and resigned the office
</p>
<p>to accept the appointment of United States district attorney.
</p>
<p>On June 30, 1823, he was killed in a duel on Bloody Island,
</p>
<p>by Thomas C. Rector.
</p>
<p>William Rector, brother of Thomas, was at the time sur-
</p>
<p>THE BARTONS. 279
</p>
<p>veyor-general of Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas, and while
</p>
<p>absent in Washington City, on official business, an anony-
</p>
<p>mous communication appeared in the Missoiiri Republican,
</p>
<p>charging him with corruption in office. Thomas C. called on
</p>
<p>the editor for the name of the author, and was informed that
</p>
<p>it was Joshua Barton, and he promptly challenged him.
</p>
<p>They met late in the afternoon, and fought with pistols, at
</p>
<p>ten paces. Barton fell at the first fire, and immediately
</p>
<p>expired. He was shot through the heart.
</p>
<p>Many anecdotes are told of David Barton, but a few must
</p>
<p>suffice. Upon one occasion he was arguing a question of
</p>
<p>law before the Supreme Court, when Judge Tompkins inter-
</p>
<p>posed with, " Stop, Mr. Barton. Do you call that law ? "
</p>
<p>''No, may it please your honor," replied Mr. Barton, respect-
</p>
<p>fully bowing, " but I did not know but that the cow't zvould
</p>
<p>take it for lazv."
</p>
<p>Mr. Barton esteemed men for their own, not their ances-
</p>
<p>tral, merits. Once, at a public table in old Franklin, Judge
</p>
<p>, of Virginia, was fluently exhibiting his pride of ances-
</p>
<p>try as only a Virginian can, when Mr. Barton, who sat
</p>
<p>some distance off, turned to an acquaintance opposite, and,
</p>
<p>addressing him in a tone loud enough to be heard by all,
</p>
<p>said : " W,, do you know my horse Pomp ? " " Oh, yes,"
</p>
<p>replied W. "Well, sir," continued Mr. Barton, imitating
</p>
<p>the judge's peculiar tone and manner, "he is the finest horse
</p>
<p>in the United States. I have tried him under the saddle,
</p>
<p>and I have tried him in the carriage ; I have tried him in the
</p>
<p>plow, and I have tried him in the wagon ; and in none of
</p>
<p>these places is he worth a d  n ! But he is the finest horse
</p>
<p>in the United States. Jt is in tJie blood, sir ; it is all in the
</p>
<p>blood ! "
</p>
<p>Mr. Barton was by no means tidy in dress, and when
</p>
<p>visiting among friends, carried with him no clothing  not
</p>
<p>even a change of shirt. On one occasion, in Boone County,

</p>
<p>a friend with whom he was stopping brought him a clean
</p>
<p>shirt, which he took into an adjoining room to put on. The
</p>
<p>garment had a cotton body and a linen bosom, and this
</p>
<p>struck Mr. Barton's sense of propriety. He at first hesitated
</p>
<p>28o BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>about putting it on at all, but then concluded to put it on back
</p>
<p>in front. Having effected the change, he came out adjusting
</p>
<p>the collar, and said, ''Look here, S., tliis shirt is a d  d fraud,
</p>
<p>and I don't mean to be a party to it ! "
</p>
<p>Judge Barton, while on the bench, lived at old Franklin,
</p>
<p>and held one of his courts there. In the same place lived an
</p>
<p>old magistrate by the name of Cole, for whom Cole County
</p>
<p>was named. Esquire Cole was a great admirer of Judge Bar-
</p>
<p>ton. Upon one occasion, while the judge was holding his
</p>
<p>court in an old log house, it was raining very hard and the
</p>
<p>roof leaked, and the rain came dripping down upon the judge.
</p>
<p>Esquire Cole saw it, and climbed up in the loft and attempted
</p>
<p>to turn the leak. In doing so a board dropped from his hand,
</p>
<p>and he commenced swearing. The judge directed the clerk
</p>
<p>to enter a fine of ^i against Esquire Cole for contempt of
</p>
<p>court in swearing in his presence. This offended the esquire
</p>
<p>very much, and a few days afterwards the judge was passing
</p>
<p>the house where the esquire was holding his court. Cole
</p>
<p>called him in, saying, " I want to tell you how I have de-
</p>
<p>cided a case, and I want your opinion upon it," stating the
</p>

<p>their friendship was renewed.
</p>
<p>Joseph B. Wells,
</p>
<p>Brother of Judge Carty Wells, was a native of Virginia,
</p>
<p>and born in Prince William County, September lo, 1806.
</p>
<p>In 1 8 10 his father moved to Shelby County, Kentucky,
</p>
<p>where Joseph received a good English education. In the
</p>
<p>fall of 1827 the family removed to St. Charles County, Mis-
</p>
<p>souri ; but in 1833 or 1834 Joseph went to Warren County,
</p>
<p>and entered as an assistant or deput}' in the office of his
</p>
<p>brother, who was then clerk of the Circuit Court of that
</p>
<p>county, and, c.v officio, clerk of the County Court. Upon the
</p>
<p>resignation of his brother, Joseph succeeded him in both
</p>
<p>offices. While with his brother he studied law, and after
</p>
<p>holding the office of clerk of the court for a short time,
</p>
<p>resigned, and entered upon the practice of the law in War-
</p>
<p>renton, and continued to practice in that circuit until 1845 or
</p>
<p>1846, when he removed to St. Louis, and became the law-
</p>
<p>partner of William M. Campbell; but, before leaving War-
</p>
<p>renton, represented Warren County in the Legislature.
</p>
<p>Upon the death of Mr. Campbell, in 1849, Mr. Wells made
</p>
<p>a partnership with Judge Buckner, but his health began
</p>
<p>to fail, and he was advised by his physican to try a change
</p>
<p>of climate, and in 1851 he left St. Louis and went to San
</p>
<p>Francisco, California, and became the law-partner of J. B.
</p>
<p>Crockett, who is now, and has been for many years past, a
</p>
<p>judge of the Supreme Court of that state.
</p>
<p>Upon the dissolution of the firm, Mr, Wells and Henry H.
</p>
<p>Haight, afterwards Governor of California, formed a partner-
</p>
<p>ship, and practiced together until the health of Mr. Wells
</p>
<p>became so feeble that he was forced to relinquish the prac-
</p>
<p>tice altogether. He then commenced traveling; came to
</p>
<p>Missouri, and, while visiting his relatives in Troy, died on
</p>
<p>December 31, 1858, at the age of fifty-two.

<p>We were well acquainted with Mr. Wells, and formed a
</p>
<p>282 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>very favorable opinion of liiui as a lawyer. He was in-
</p>
<p>dustrious, energetic, and persevering, and an ardent student.
</p>
<p>After his admission to the bar he applied himself more
</p>
<p>closely to his studies than l^efore, and became a well-read
</p>
<p>lawyer. He was also quite successful, for he studied his
</p>
<p>cases thoroughly, and was scarcely ever forced into a trial
</p>
<p>unprepared. His clients reposed the utmost confidence in
</p>
<p>him, as they had good reason to do, for he was true and
</p>
<p>faithful to them. Mr. Wells was a vigorous, fluent, and
</p>
<p>earnest speaker, and presented the facts of his case to a jury
</p>
<p>in as forcible a light as they would admit of. As an advocate
</p>
<p>we thought him too excitable, but no interruption threw him
</p>
<p>off his guard, nor did the weakness of his case draw from
</p>
<p>him any appearance of a want of confidence in tlie result.
</p>
<p>He had many of the elements of a good lawyer, and if his
</p>
<p>physical ability had been equal to his mental, he would have
</p>
<p>made a fine reputation. As a member of the Legislature he
</p>
<p>rendered good service on several important committees, and
</p>
<p>when on the floor was listened to with interest ; for, though a
</p>
<p>decided party man, he never indulged in the abuse of his
</p>
<p>opponents, nor did he make any factious opposition to
</p>
<p>measures of a local character.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wells was a man of very feeble constitution, and
</p>
<p>through life was battling against pulmonary consumption, to

<p>which disease he finally succumbed. He never married.
</p>
<p>JOHN W. NOELL.
</p>
<p>Among the law}'ers from south-east Missouri whom we
</p>
<p>often met in the Law Library of St. Louis, during the ses-
</p>
<p>sions of the Supreme Court, was General Noell, who prac-
</p>
<p>ticed in Perry and in the adjoining counties, and whose resi-
</p>
<p>dence was at Perryville. He came to St. Louis at each ses-
</p>
<p>sion of the Supreme Court, to prepare his briefs and argue
</p>
<p>his cases.
</p>
<p>There is no place in St. Louis in which lawyers congre-
</p>
<p>gate in larger numbers than in the room occupied as a
</p>
<p>law library, for, although it is a private institution, and sup-
</p>
<p>ported by a semi-annual tax imposed on its members, yet,
</p>
<p>by courtesy, attorneys from other parts of the state have the
</p>
<p>privilege of the books, and this brings them in contact with
</p>
<p>the local bar.
</p>
<p>General Noell made good use of it, and hence, while in the
</p>
<p>city, we met him almost daily, and found him a genial and
</p>
<p>social gentleman.
</p>
<p>He was born in Bedford County, Virginia, February 22,
</p>
<p>i8i6, and received a very limited education, such only as he
</p>
<p>could obtain in the " old-field " schools of that state. At the
</p>
<p>age of seventeen he came with his father to south-east Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, and settled in Perry County. At that time it had not
</p>
<p>entered his head to study law, for, on approaching his ma-
</p>
<p>jority, he married, and followed various pursuits, such as
</p>
<p>milling, store-keeping, etc., in all of which he failed ; and at
</p>
<p>the age of twenty-five, through the urgent solicitations of his
</p>
<p>wife, whose good sense enabled her to see in him the ele-
</p>
<p>ments of professional success, studied law. Li the following
</p>
<p>year he was appointed clerk of the Perry County Circuit
</p>
<p>Court, which office he held until 1850, when he was elected

</p>
<p>to the State Senate. The proceedings of the Legislature of
</p>
<p>284 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>that period show that he took an active part in the principal
</p>
<p>debates, and was placed on some of the most important com-
</p>
<p>mittees. He served a full term of four years.
</p>
<p>In 1858 he was elected to Congress from his district, and
</p>
<p>reelected for two successive terms, and died, in Washington
</p>
<p>City, on March 14, 1863, before the expiration of his term.
</p>
<p>In 1850 the Native American party obtained the ascend-
</p>
<p>ency in many parts of Missouri, but Mr. Noell opposed it
</p>
<p>with great vehemence, and addressed the people in most of
</p>
<p>the south-eastern counties; and the canvass he made on that
</p>
<p>occasion gave him an introduction to the people, and a good
</p>
<p>reputation as a stump-speaker, and it is not improbable that
</p>
<p>it paved his way to a seat in Congress.
</p>
<p>General Noell made no particular reputation in Congress,
</p>
<p>but was a fair member, and very attentive to the interests of
</p>
<p>his constituents, which they fully appreciated by the cordial
</p>
<p>support they gave him.
</p>
<p>When the Rebellion broke out he took a firm and decided
</p>
<p>stand for the Union, and supported all the measures of the
</p>
<p>Administration tending to preserve the unity of the states.
</p>
<p>Though a strong Democrat, he knew of no party obligation
</p>
<p>that required him to stand in hostility to Mr. Lincoln's
</p>
<p>Administration in its efforts to preserve the integrity of the
</p>
<p>country. He knew no parties but the Union and anti-Union,
</p>
<p>and, though he had always lived in a slave state, arrayed
</p>
<p>himself on the side of his government.
</p>
<p>We heard him make several oral arguments in the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, and upon each occasion was impressed with
</p>
<p>the clearness of his mind, and his thorough knowledge of
</p>
<p>his case. He had a clear, distinct enunciation, and, though
</p>
<p>never eloquent, was impressive and logical. He excelled
</p>
<p>chiefly as a criminal lawyer, and in that sphere was greatly
</p>
<p>aided by his knowledge of men; for he mingled freely with
</p>
<p>the people, and showed great shrewdness in impaneling a

</p>
<p>General Noell was full of human sympathy, exhibited a
</p>
<p>tender regard for the sufferings of his fellow-man, and kept

<p>his purse open to the poor and indigent. It is not strange,
</p>
<p>therefore, that his popularity was so great with the masses.
</p>
<p>As a tribute to his memory, they selected his son to succeed
</p>
<p>him in Congress.
</p>
<p>General Noell was a tall, spare-made man, plain in his
</p>
<p>dress, and unostentatious in his manners. A stranger could

</p>
<p>THOMAS E. NOELL,
</p>
<p>Son of John W. Noell, and to whose seat in Congress he suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded, was born in Perry County, Missouri, on April 3,
</p>
<p>1839, and received a good EngHsh education at St. Mar3^'s
</p>
<p>Seminary, an institution of learning in Perry County.
</p>
<p>Intending to follow the profession of his father, he entered
</p>
<p>the hitter's office as a student, and in due time was admitted
</p>
<p>to the bar, and settled in Dubuque, Iowa, expecting to make
</p>
<p>that his permanent home. He was induced to remove there
</p>
<p>by the urgent solicitation of some relations w ho resided in
</p>
<p>Dubuque, and thought it a more desirable location for an
</p>
<p>attorney than Perryville. But the rigorous dim ite of Iowa
</p>
<p>was illy adapted to his constitution, and before he had been
</p>
<p>there a year he was attacked with bronchitis, a disease preva-
</p>
<p>lent in his fiimil}', and he was advised b}- his physician to
</p>
<p>seek a milder climate. He therefore returned to Missouri,
</p>
<p>formed a partnership with his father, and upon the latter's
</p>
<p>entering Congress took charge of almost the entire business
</p>
<p>of the firm. He applied himself closely to the practice until
</p>
<p>the outbreak of the Rebellion, when he enlisted in the state
</p>
<p>militia, and was appointed major of one of the regiments;
</p>
<p>but was shortly after commissioned as captain in the regular
</p>
<p>army, and joined the Nineteenth Indiana Infantry.
</p>
<p>In 1863, after the death of his father, he returned to Mis-
</p>
<p>souri and discharged the duties of a mustering and disbursing
</p>
<p>officer, and continued to do so until 1864, when he was
</p>
<p>elected to Congress from the same district which his father
</p>
<p>had represented. Ii^ 1866 he was reelected, but died before
</p>
<p>the expiration of his term  a strange coincidence, that one
</p>
<p>should succeed the other, and both die in their congressional
</p>
<p>harness. His death occurred at the Sisters' Hospital in St.
</p>
<p>Louis, on October 3, lS:g, in the thirty-first year of his age.

<p>The death of Mr. Noell was one of those sad events that
</p>
<p>THOMAS E. NOELL. 28/
</p>
<p>often make us wonder, if not murmur, at the decrees of
</p>
<p>Providence.
</p>
<p>Upon the death of his father he became the sole support
</p>
<p>of a doting mother, a fond sister, and three httle brothers,
</p>
<p>and devoted his entire Hfe to promote their welfare and hap-
</p>
<p>piness. His deep devotion and self-sacrificing disposition
</p>
<p>caused him to endure many privations that he might be able
</p>
<p>to administer to their wants and comfort. Why, then, should
</p>
<p>he be called away in the morning of life, and in the midst of
</p>
<p>his usefulness? God no doubt does what is best for us, but
</p>
<p>our weak and feeble intellect cannot always comprehend the
</p>
<p>wisdom of His decrees.
</p>
<p>The personal characteristics of Mr. Noell were much like
</p>
<p>those of his father. He had the same kindness of heart
</p>
<p>and s>'mpathetic feeling, and exhibited the same readiness
</p>
<p>to assist the poor and unprotected. He would rather give
</p>
<p>than receive, administer than be administered unto. He was
</p>
<p>a stranger to selfishness and deceit.
</p>
<p>We never saw him at the bar, but those who practiced in

<p>the same circuit speak well of his legal abilities, and his faith-
</p>
<p>fulness to his clients.

<p>and parts upon tlie troubled waters."
</p>
<p>Hamilton R. Gamble.
</p>
<p>We now invite the attention of our readers to a brief
</p>
<p>sketch of the career of one of the most distinguished lawyers
</p>
<p>of the West, and who, in the opinion of many, stood at the
</p>
<p>head of the Missouri bar.
</p>
<p>Hamilton Rowan Gamble, late provisional governor of the
</p>
<p>state, was born in Winchester County, Virginia, November
</p>
<p>29, 1798, and was of Irish descent, his grandfather having
</p>
<p>emigrated from Ireland to Pennsylvania in 1753.
</p>
<p>His education was chiefly obtained in Hampden Sidney
</p>
<p>College, Prince Edward County, Virginia, and we presume
</p>
<p>was liberal, and to some extent classical. He must have
</p>
<p>commenced the study of the law at a very early period, for
</p>
<p>he was admitted to the bar in three states before reaching his
</p>
<p>majority.
</p>
<p>He first contemplated settling in Tennessee, and for several
</p>
<p>months had a law-office in that state, but soon determined to
</p>
<p>come further west, and in 1818 came to St. Louis; but, find-
</p>
<p>ing the prospect for a practice there not very favorable, he re-
</p>
<p>moved to old Franklin, in Howard County, which was then
</p>
<p>one of the most attractive points in the territory of Missouri.
</p>
<p>At that time Howard and St. Charles were the only organized
</p>
<p>counties north of the Missouri River, and each larger in ter-
</p>
<p>ritory than some of the New England states. Shortly after
</p>
<p>locating in Howard he was appointed prosecuting attorney.
</p>
<p>And when we reflect that the duties of his office required
</p>
<p>him to travel on horseback thousands of miles every year,
</p>
<p>without access to any law-books except such as he could
</p>
<p>carry in his saddle-bags, we may well estimate the amount
</p>
<p>of labor he must have performed, and the difficulties attached
</p>
<p>to his office.
</p>
<p>It was while residing in old Franklin that he contracted

</p>
<p>dissipated habits, and his friends had good reason to appre-
</p>
<p>HAMILTON R. GAMBLE. 289
</p>
<p>hend that he had become a confirmed drunkard. A some-
</p>
<p>what favorable change must have soon taken place, for in
</p>
<p>1824 Governor Bates appointed him secretary of state, which
</p>
<p>rendered it necessary for him to remove to St. Charles, then
</p>
<p>the seat of government. The death of Governor Bates, soon
</p>
<p>after, induced Mr. Gamble to settle in St. Louis, which city
</p>
<p>became his future residence for life, and there, at a bar con-
</p>
<p>sisting of such men as Geyer, Bates, Benton, McGirk, Barton,
</p>
<p>Lawless, and others, he soon took the highest rank, and
</p>
<p>maintained it till his death.
</p>
<p>In 1827 he married Miss Coalter, of South Carolina, one of
</p>
<p>several sisters, all of whom were united in marriage to men
</p>
<p>of distinction. There is a piece of romance connected with
</p>
<p>this marriage which does not seem to be well authenticated,
</p>
<p>and for which we do not pretend to vouch, but, as it received
</p>
<p>credence with a large number of the friends of all parties
</p>
<p>concerned, we give it for what it is worth ; for, if true, it
</p>
<p>evinces on the part of Edward Bates a disinterested friendship
</p>
<p>which does the highest honor to his head and heart. It is said
</p>
<p>that Mr. Bates fell deeply in love with Miss Coalter, and
</p>
<p>offered her his hand, which she, with due consideration for his
</p>
<p>feelings, declined. Mr. Bates was a fine-looking man, and
</p>
<p>one of the most promising young lawyers at the bar, and con-
</p>
<p>sidered an excellent match for any lady; and, being some-
</p>
<p>what surprised at the refusal, pressed Miss Coalter for her
</p>
<p>reason. Her high appreciation of Mr. Bates led her to dis-
</p>
<p>close to him in confidence the fact that Hamilton R. Gamble
</p>
<p>already had her heart, and that she only withheld from him
</p>
<p>her hand because of his dissipated habits. Mr. Bates, with a
</p>
<p>magnanimity that characterized him through life, imme-
</p>
<p>diately sought an interview with Mr. Gamble, and frankly
</p>
<p>told him what had passed between him and Miss Coalter,
</p>
<p>and insisted upon it that he should from that day make a
</p>
<p>solemn pledge never to taste another drop of ardent spirits;

</p>
<p>which pledge Gamble gave, and he was soon after united
</p>
<p>with Miss Coalter in marriage. Mr. Bates then addressed
</p>
<p>and married another sister, and Gamble and Bates became

</p>
<p>partners in the practice of the law, and were bosom friends
</p>
<p>till separated by death. Both marriages resulted most hap-
</p>
<p>pily, and Mr. Gamble became one of the most exemplary
</p>
<p>men in his habits that the bar could boast of.
</p>
<p>Governor Gamble's success as a lawyer can hardly be said
</p>
<p>to have commenced until his return to St. Louis, but from
</p>
<p>that time until he retired from practice he was retained in al-
</p>
<p>most every important suit pending in the St. Louis courts 
</p>
<p>followed them to the Supreme Court of the United States,
</p>
<p>argued them in person, and obtained a high reputation as a
</p>
<p>jurist. His mind was clear, logical, and thoroughly balanced,
</p>
<p>and when he closed his argument upon any legal proposition
</p>
<p>in which he took an interest there was little left to be said
</p>
<p>by those who followed him. As a mere jury lawyer he could
</p>
<p>not be said to be successful, for he made no pretensions to
</p>
<p>oratory, relying solely upon a clear, concise, and correct state-
</p>
<p>ment of facts, and the law as applicable to the facts. He
</p>
<p>was slow in his eunciation, and often hesitated in the use of
</p>
<p>language, but never failed to make himself thoroughly un-
</p>
<p>derstood by both court and jury. As his practice was mostly
</p>
<p>confined to important land suits, he seldom had occasion to
</p>
<p>address a jury.
</p>
<p>We never had the pleasure of hearing Governor Gamble
</p>
<p>make an argument in any important case, but our judgment
</p>
<p>of his standing as a lawyer is ^derived from the position that
</p>
<p>was universally assigned to him by his professional brethren,
</p>
<p>and from his printed briefs and arguments, and his opinions
</p>
<p>delivered while on the bench of the Supreme Court, em-
</p>
<p>braced in volumes 15 to 20, inclusive, of the State Reports.
</p>
<p>Probably no one knew him better, or was more thoroughly
</p>
<p>conversant with his professional ability, than the Hon.
</p>
<p>Thomas T. Gantt, one of the most eminent jurists of the
</p>
<p>Missouri bar. Mr. Gantt practiced with him many years at
</p>
<p>the same bar; and at a meeting of the St. Louis bar, called,

<p>immediately after the death of Governor Gamble, to take
</p>
<p>action in reference to the great loss sustained by the pro-
</p>
<p>fession, Mr. Gantt thus alluded to him :
</p>
<p>HAMILTON K. GAMBLE. 29 1
</p>
<p>"As a lawyer he was well and deeply read. The clear, logical mind which
</p>
<p>nature gave him had been enriched and disciplined by close and various study.
</p>
<p>A singularly retentive memory enabled him to apply, with scarcely an eHbrt,
</p>
<p>the stores of his vast learning. He had the faculty of discovering, almost at
</p>
<p>a glance, the strength and the weakness of every case which was laid before
</p>
<p>him. He ne/er manifested any affection for the weak points of his own case,
</p>
<p>but he seldom failed to try every rivet and joint of the armor of his enemy in
</p>
<p>those parts where his admirable sagacity led him to suspect that it was vulner-
</p>
<p>able. It was not often that his attacks were directed against a point where the
</p>
<p>armor was of proof, and, if the part assailed were indeed penetrable, it was
</p>
<p>well-nigh impossible to baffle the skill and force of his assault. His present-
</p>
<p>ment of the strength of his own cause was in all respects excellent. He did
</p>
<p>not fatigue the court or jury by trivial points, or a rambling discourse which
</p>
<p>left his hearers doubtful what his own notions of the merits of his case really
</p>
<p>were. He boldly and plaiidy staked his success on the strong points of his
</p>
<p>cause."
</p>
<p>No one who knows Judge Gantt will charge him with
</p>
<p>uttering fulsome praise of any one, and the above extract
</p>
<p>from his speech will be accepted as a fair and true state-
</p>
<p>ment of Governor Gamble's professional characteristics.
</p>
<p>The same view was taken by the Hon. John M. Krum and
</p>
<p>the Hon. Sainuel T. Glover, both eminent lawyers of the bar,
</p>
<p>who addressed the same meeting.
</p>
<p>Governor Gamble had no taste for poetry or light litera-
</p>
<p>ture, or the arts of rhetoric, but in many of the sciences was
</p>
<p>very proficient, and delighted in close research and deep
</p>
<p>investigation.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1832-3 Judge Carr was called before the
</p>
<p>Legislature upon charges of impeachment, and Mr. Gamble
</p>
<p>and Henry S. Geyer appeared in his defense; and the argu-
</p>
<p>ment of Mr. Gamble on that occasion attracted attention
</p>
<p>throughout the state, and received high encomiums from the
</p>
<p>press.
</p>
<p>In 1846 he was induced to take a seat in the Legislature,

<p>and it was there that, as a representative from Franklin
</p>
<p>County, we first formed anything like an intimate acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance with him. It was the revising session, and the people
</p>
<p>of St. Louis called upon him with great unanimity to take a
</p>
<p>seat in that body, knowing that his services in the revision
</p>
<p>of the laws would be very valuable. No man in the Legisla-
</p>
<p>292 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>ture was more universally esteemed, for, instead of being
</p>
<p>austere and reserved, he was on good terms with all, and
</p>
<p>had a good word to say to every one who approached him ;
</p>
<p>and if anything came before the House which elicited merri-
</p>
<p>ment, he enjoyed it immeasurably.
</p>
<p>Upon one occasion a bill was presented to reduce the
</p>
<p>salaries of the governor and judiciary. It provided that the
</p>
<p>salary of the governor should be ;^i,ooo; that of a supreme
</p>
<p>judge, ;^8oo ; and a circuit judge, ^600. It was a buncombe
</p>
<p>measure, and was supported by about twenty-five Demo-
</p>
<p>crats and the entire Whig vote. Governor Gamble not ex-
</p>
<p>cepted, for he then affiliated with the old Whig party. To
</p>
<p>test the strength of the measure, we mov^ed its indefinite
</p>
<p>postponement; but our motion failed by twenty votes, and it
</p>
<p>became evident that, unless we could beat our opponents in
</p>
<p>parliamentary tactics, the bill would pass. About this time
</p>
<p>a Democratic senator approached us with the pleasant intel-
</p>
<p>ligence that, unless we defeated the bill in the House, the
</p>
<p>Senate would not take the responsibility of opposing it.
</p>
<p>We managed, before a vote could be taken on its final pas-
</p>
<p>sage, to procure an adjournment, and, as we passed out of
</p>
<p>the Capitol, overtook Mr. Gamble, and asked him how he
</p>
<p>could conscientiously vote to give a governor $1,000 and a
</p>
<p>supreme judge $800. " Why," said he (laughing till his
</p>
<p>sides shook), "there is not a judgeship in the state filled by a
</p>
<p>Whig, and if you Democrats want to reduce the pay of your
</p>
<p>own officers, how can you expect that we Whigs, who are
</p>
<p>stripped of all official patronage, shall oppose you?" And
</p>
<p>again he laughed heartily at our apparent distress.
</p>
<p>That night, while lying in bed and ruminating over the
</p>
<p>probable passage of the bill, the thought occurred to us that
</p>
<p>we might probably defeat it by attaching to it the State Uni-
</p>
<p>versity at Columbia, which was a favorite institution with the
</p>
<p>old counties, nearly all of which were represented by Whigs.

<p>At that time the president of the University was receiving
</p>
<p>;^2,500, besides house-rent and servant-hire ; and no pro-
</p>
<p>fessor received less than ;^i, 200. We immediately rose from
</p>
<p>the bed, and prepared an amendment reducing the salary of
</p>
<p>HAMILTON R. GAMBLE. 293
</p>
<p>the president to $1,000, dispensing with all perquisites, and
</p>
<p>Hmiting the pay of all other officers to $600. Shortly after
</p>
<p>the House convened on the next day, the bill was called
</p>
<p>up, and we offered our amendment, which proved a perfect
</p>
<p>bomb-shell, for no Democrat who had been voting for the
</p>
<p>bill could consistently oppose the amendment. We never
</p>
<p>shall forget the distress it gave old Dr. Jewell, a Whig mem-
</p>
<p>ber from Boone, and a most excellent and worthy member.
</p>
<p>He rose and addressed the House, with his eyes overflowing
</p>
<p>with tears, and said "he had not supposed that there was a
</p>
<p>man on that floor who had any unkind feeling against so
</p>
<p>good an institution as the University ; " and, evidently not
</p>
<p>understanding the object of the amendment, became so over-
</p>
<p>powered with emotion as scarcely to be able to give utter-
</p>
<p>ance to his thoughts  in fact, he wept with all the simplicity
</p>
<p>of a child. At the conclusion of his remarks we moved
</p>
<p>the indefinite postponement of the bill and amendment, and
</p>
<p>our motion prevailed by a large majority, thus getting rid of
</p>
<p>a most serious, and what might have been a damaging, piece
</p>
<p>of legislation. When we met Mr. Gamble again, he re-
</p>
<p>marked, " Well, I did not think you were so much of a Yan-
</p>
<p>kee. Your amendment came very near putting an end to
</p>
<p>the existence of old Dr. Jewell, and it scattered our Whig
</p>
<p>friends in every direction."
</p>
<p>During that winter mesmerism was in high vogue, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Gamble attended all the private meetings, and seemed to be
</p>
<p>highly amused at the exhibitions  not that he had an}' faith
</p>
<p>in it, but it afforded a pleasant way of passing his leisure
</p>
<p>hours.
</p>
<p>In 1 85 I Mr. Gamble was called almost by acclamation to
</p>
<p>the bench of the Supreme Court, became presiding justice,
</p>
<p>which position he held for about four years, during which
</p>
<p>time he settled many doubtful questions, and delivered
</p>
<p>many opinions which were characterized by great learning,

</p>
<p>research, and legal acumen. The labors of the office
</p>
<p>became too onerous for him, and in 1855 he resigned.
</p>
<p>Governor Gamble was too much devoted to his profession,
</p>
<p>and too fond of domestic life, to entertain any desire for
</p>
<p>294 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>public position ; and it was only when a strong appeal was
</p>
<p>made to his sense of duty that he accepted any office, and
</p>
<p>then only held it until he could frame a reasonable excuse
</p>
<p>for retiring.
</p>
<p>But the great event of his life, and which will hand his
</p>
<p>name down to posterity as a public benefactor, was his
</p>
<p>administration as provisional governor of Missouri. Before
</p>
<p>the difficulties of the country assumed any magnitude. Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Gamble spent most of his time in Pennsylvania, Avhere
</p>
<p>he was educating his children ; and while there the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture of the state, containing an overwhelming majority of
</p>
<p>secessionists, passed an act providing for tlie call of a State
</p>
<p>Convention, ostensibly to take into consideration the rela-
</p>
<p>tions of the state towards the Federal government, but in
</p>
<p>reality to pass a secession ordinance, and drive Missouri into
</p>
<p>the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>As the cloud of dissension, anarchy, and misrule began to
</p>
<p>spread over the state, he became alarmed for the fate of his
</p>
<p>beloved Missouri, hastened home, and on the day of his ar-
</p>
<p>rival in St. Louis found the streets full of armed men, and
</p>
<p>the Sub-Treasury closely guarded by a detail of government
</p>
<p>troops. On the face of every man he met was depicted
</p>
<p>anxiety and alarm. A meeting of the citizens was called
</p>
<p>for the next night, at the court-house, and Judge Gamble,
</p>
<p>by the most urgent appeals, attended and delivered a brief
</p>
<p>address, in which he proclaimed his devotion to the Union
</p>
<p>and his fealty to the government. From a newspaper report
</p>
<p>of his address we quote the following, as evidence of his
</p>
<p>strong attachment to the Federal Union. Said he :
</p>
<p>"No questions of sufficient importance liad ever come up to call him forth
</p>
<p>from the quiet life he had chosen ; but at this fearful crisis of the country's
</p>
<p>history, when our clearest rights and liberties are endangered  when the
</p>
<p>blessed Union under which we have enjoyed so much, and prospered so
</p>
<p>greatly, is threatened  he could not remain silent. * * ^' Those who

<p>made our state their home came here because, as American citizens, they could
</p>
<p>enjoy those rights and immunities which other countries did not offer them.
</p>
<p>They came where they could be protected in all their rights; and thus it is
</p>
<p>that this great state has grown up and prospered. It is all in consequence of
</p>
<p>the Union. It is an instance of unexampled prosperity. And look at the
</p>
<p>HAMILTON R. GAMBLE. 295
</p>
<p>great confederacy of states. Did the sun ever shine on a happier or more
</p>
<p>prosperous nation than the United States six months ago ? We were in entire
</p>
<p>harmonVi and projecting great measures for improvement and internal prog-
</p>
<p>ress. This great nation, with its various climates and soils, with its hills and
</p>
<p>vales, prairies and savannahs, is calculated to benefit every class of our peo-
</p>
<p>ple. Why, then, in the name of Heaven  in the name of everything that is
</p>
<p>sacred and holy  shall the Union be broken up? Why shall brother be
</p>
<p>arrayed against brother, and state against state ? Why shall war rage ? Why
</p>
<p>should we engage in conflict with those with whom we have lived as brothers
</p>
<p>for nearly a century ? Why, like children, shall we break this Union to pieces
</p>
<p>and squander it? * * * There can be no Union without the Constitution,
</p>
<p>and those who would destroy the one must destroy the other. But there is no
</p>
<p>necessity for injuring either. If any man's rights have been violated, they can
</p>
<p>be redressed in the Union, and under the Constitution. The rights of no states
</p>
<p>have been violated so as to cause a dissolution of this confederacy. If the
</p>
<p>laws have not in all cases been executed, then it is the fault of those whose
</p>
<p>business it is to execute them. If any states should place obstructions in the
</p>
<p>way of the execution of the laws, then this evil should be redressed in the
</p>
<p>Union. It cannot be remedied out of the Union. What is there to justify the
</p>
<p>breaking up of this government, or the tearing down of the only fabric of con-
</p>
<p>stitutional liberty ever erected ? What is to be gained ? [A voice : ' Nothing.']
</p>
<p>Nothing under heaven can be gained. Then, let us stand in the Union, and
</p>
<p>by it, under all circumstances. Let us stand where our fathers stood."
</p>
<p>Thus spake Hamilton R. Gamble, as only a patriot could
</p>
<p>speak whose heart was overflowing with love and gratitude
</p>
<p>to his country.
</p>
<p>It was by such appeals addressed to the intelligence and
</p>
<p>patriotism of the people that the Union party succeeded in
</p>
<p>obtaining a large majority in the Convention.
</p>
<p>The Convention assembled at Jefferson City on February
</p>
<p>28, 1 86 1, but, after electing its officers and fully organizing,
</p>
<p>adjourned to meet again in St. Louis on March 4th.
</p>
<p>On that day they reassembled at the Mercantile Library
</p>
<p>Hall in St. Louis, Sterling Price being president of the Con-

<p>vention. A committee on Federal Relations was organized,
</p>
<p>with Judge Gamble as chairman, and the Convention de-
</p>
<p>clared the adhesion of the state to the Union, and took all
</p>
<p>necessary steps to preserve peace and good order, and then
</p>
<p>adjourned to the third Monday in December, subject. to be
</p>
<p>called together sooner by a committee appointed for that'
</p>
<p>purpose, if any emergency required it.
</p>
<p>The emergency did arise, for in the meantime the storm of
</p>
<p>296 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>strife and misrule began to rage throughout the state, and
</p>
<p>the rebel Governor Jackson and Legislature had fled the
</p>
<p>capital and reorganized at Neosho, near the Arkansas line.
</p>
<p>By direction of the committee the Convention reassembled
</p>
<p>at Jefferson City on July 22d, and proceeded to organize a
</p>
<p>provisional government, first having deposed Governor Jack-
</p>
<p>son and the state officers under him. Instinctively the eyes
</p>
<p>of all settled upon Judge Gamble for governor, and Willard
</p>
<p>P. Hall, one of the ablest and most distinguished men of the
</p>
<p>state, as lieutenant-governor. It is a singular coincidence
</p>
<p>that both were born in a slave state, and never lived perma-
</p>
<p>nently in any other.
</p>
<p>It is not our purpose to give a history of Governor Gam-
</p>
<p>ble's administration. It is sufficient to say that, during the
</p>
<p>most terrible ordeal that ever a state passed through, he
</p>
<p>stood like a faithful pilot at the helm, and carried us safely
</p>
<p>over the quicksands and breakers that threatened the de-
</p>
<p>struction of our noble ship of state.
</p>
<p>The arduous duties of his office, added to the great men-
</p>
<p>tal anxiety necessarily endured, proved too much for his
</p>
<p>physical constitution, which had been greatly impaired by a
</p>
<p>railroad accident while on an official visit to Washington,
</p>
<p>and on January 31, 1864, he departed this life at his resi-
</p>
<p>dence in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>Governor Hall immediately assumed the duties of chief
</p>
<p>magistrate, and it is due to that distinguished citizen of
</p>
<p>north-western Missouri to say that he proved a most faithful
</p>
<p>and efficient executive, and much of the success of Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Gamble's administration is due to his valuable aid and
</p>
<p>hearty cooperation.
</p>
<p>Strangers visiting St. Louis will find in the hall of the
</p>
<p>Mercantile Library a full-length portrait of Governor Gam-
</p>
<p>ble, which is not only a perfect likeness, but an admirable
</p>
<p>painting.

<p>Governor Gamble had no ambition for public life. He
</p>
<p>never trimmed his sails to catch the popular breeze. Yet it
</p>
<p>was gratifying to him to know that his course in life met the
</p>
<p>favor and approbation of his fellow-citizens.
</p>
<p>HAMILTON R. GAMBLE. 297
</p>
<p>Immediately after his death the bar of St. Louis assembled
</p>
<p>71 masse, and paid every tribute of respect to his memory in
</p>
<p>their power. They attended his funeral in a body. Upon
</p>
<p>the dav he was buried, business in St. Louis was entirely sus-
</p>
<p>pended, and most of the public buildings and stores were
</p>
<p>draped in mourning. A very able and impressive discourse
</p>
<p>was delivered in the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church by
</p>
<p>the Rev. Dr. Brooks, but not one-tenth of the people in at-
</p>
<p>tendance could obtain admittance. The funeral cortege was
</p>
<p>over a mile long, and a general feeling of sadness overspread
</p>
<p>the public mind. His remains were deposited in the beauti-
</p>
<p>ful cemetery of Bellefontaine, to the adornment of which he
</p>
<p>had largely contributed in life.
</p>
<p>"There is no death ; what seems so is transition :

</p>
<p>Is but a suburb of the life elysian,

<p>Whose portal we call death."
</p>
<p>James R. Lackland.
</p>
<p>It is not unfrequently the case that men who have obtained
</p>
<p>distinction in some particular vocation or calhng are unjustly
</p>
<p>accredited with being self-made ; but it could not be so said of
</p>
<p>James Ransom Lackland, whose whole life was one of toil
</p>
<p>and incessant labor, and who had not only to contend against
</p>
<p>the disadvantages of a very imperfect and limited education,
</p>
<p>but against a constitutional disease which threatened him
</p>
<p>through life, and to which he finally had to succumb.
</p>
<p>His father was an active and successful farmer in St. Louis
</p>
<p>Count)-, and brought up his sons to work on the farm, no
</p>
<p>doubt intending that they should follow his calling. It is
</p>
<p>certain that, until he began to approach manhood, James
</p>
<p>worked a good portion of his time on the farm, and thereby
</p>
<p>greatly assisted his father in supporting the family.
</p>
<p>James R. Lackland was born on Januar}- 8, 1820, near Rock-
</p>
<p>ville, in Montgomery County, ]\Iar3'land, and came with his
</p>
<p>parents to Missouri in 1828. His father purchased a farm in
</p>
<p>St. Ferdinand Township, St. Louis County, which continued
</p>
<p>to be the family homestead as long as he lived, and is still re-
</p>
<p>tained in the family. During the winter and a portion of the
</p>
<p>summer James went to a school in the neighborhood, and for
</p>
<p>a time was a pupil in ]\Iarion College, of which Dr. El\' was
</p>
<p>president. This enabled him to obtain an ordinary English
</p>
<p>education.
</p>
<p>At this time he had not the most remote idea of embark-
</p>
<p>ing in the law, for after leaving home he became a clerk in a
</p>
<p>wholesale grocery house in St. Louis, and afterwards an as-
</p>
<p>sistant clerk on a western steamer. By mere chance he ob-
</p>
<p>tained employment in the office of General Ruland, who was
</p>
<p>clerk of the St. Louis Circuit Court. He wrote a fair, legible
</p>
<p>hand, and was chiefly employed in copying and making out

</p>
<p>transcripts for the Supreme Court. In this he displayed his
</p>
<p>JAMES R. LACKLAXD. 299
</p>
<p>usual industry and activity, for it is said b\- lawyers then in
</p>
<p>practice that he was never seen idle for a moment. It was
</p>
<p>while in the clerk's office that he was persuaded to enter
</p>
<p>upon the study of the law. He went into the law-office of
</p>
<p>the Hon. Charles D. Drake, now presiding judge of the
</p>
<p>Court of Claims, at Washington City, and applied himself
</p>
<p>most diligently to his studies, and in 1846 was admitted to
</p>
<p>practice.
</p>
<p>He commenced his professional life without fortune or
</p>
<p>influential friends, relying solely upon his own energy, indomi-
</p>
<p>table will, and untiring perseverance ; but these enabled him
</p>
<p>to surmount difficulties which beset him at every step, and
</p>
<p>which to many would have proved appalling. The first pub-
</p>
<p>lic position he held was that of circuit attorney, which re-
</p>
<p>quired him to appear in behalf of the state in all criminal
</p>
<p>prosecutions. The office is one of not only great labor, but
</p>
<p>great responsibilit}', and frequent!}' imposes upon the incum-
</p>
<p>bent the necessit}- of coming in conflict with the brightest
</p>
<p>lights of the profession.
</p>
<p>As a prosecutor he was bold, defiant, and successful ; and
</p>
<p>at no period in the history of our local criminal jurisprudence
</p>
<p>were there so many convictions as during his occupancy
</p>
<p>of the office.
</p>
<p>In the celebrated case of the ^lontesquiou brothers,
</p>
<p>French counts, who were indicted for murder, he prosecuted
</p>
<p>with a vigor and ability that surprised his friends and gave
</p>
<p>him at once a high rank at the bar.
</p>
<p>Nathaniel Chiles was for many years first teller of the State
</p>
<p>Bank of Missouri, enjoying the entire confidence of the bank
</p>
<p>directors ; was a class-leader in the Methodist Church, and
</p>
<p>stood well in the communit}' as a man of enterprise and in-
</p>
<p>tegrity. From time to time large sums of money were
</p>
<p>missed from the bank, and after the most laborious exam-
</p>
<p>ination suspicion fell upon Chiles, and he was indicted for

<p>the embezzlement, and tried in the Criminal Court. It was
</p>
<p>almost impossible to induce the community to give credence
</p>
<p>to the charge, more particularh* as the evidence against him
</p>
<p>was entirelv circumstantial. The fact that he had access to
</p>
<p>300 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>the vaults of the bank, and Hved and entertained far beyond
</p>
<p>his salary, were about the only circumstances that were at
</p>
<p>first developed ; and starting with these Mr. Lackland went
</p>
<p>to work, and in time presented such a strong combination of
</p>
<p>circumstances as to leave but little room for any doubt as to
</p>
<p>his guilt. But his church and friends  unwilling to believe
</p>
<p>that one who had been a minister of the gospel, and whose
</p>
<p>character had never before been subjected to any suspicion,
</p>
<p>would be guilty of so grave an offense  rallied to his sup-
</p>
<p>port, and by the aid of the most eminent counsel and a
</p>
<p>divided public opinion, succeeded in producing an acquittal.
</p>
<p>But the marked ability displayed by Mr. Lackland gave him
</p>
<p>a wide-spread reputation. Chiles was, several years after-
</p>
<p>wards, convicted of a similar offense, and served out a term
</p>
<p>of years in our penitentiary.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lackland never spoke from notes, and never prepared
</p>
<p>a speech in advance ; hence none of his forensic efforts are
</p>
<p>preserved.
</p>
<p>In 185 Mr. Lackland was elected judge of the Criminal
</p>
<p>Court, and there acquired an additional reputation as a jurist.
</p>
<p>He was afterwards called by the people to the bench of the
</p>
<p>Circuit Court, which office he held till 1859, when he resigned
</p>
<p>to again engage in active practice.
</p>
<p>The case in which Judge Lackland acquired the greatest
</p>
<p>reputation was that of Effie Carstang vs. Henry L. Shaw,
</p>
<p>being a suit for alleged breach of marriage promise, which
</p>
<p>excited much interest throughout the country. Effie was
</p>
<p>originally from Brooklyn, New York, and, after living sev-
</p>
<p>eral years in the South, finally came with a widowed sister
</p>
<p>to St. Louis, rented a large dwelling, and sub-let the rooms
</p>
<p>to single gentlemen for sleeping apartments. Effie was the
</p>
<p>daughter of a clergyman, and a maiden of some pretensions
</p>
<p>to beauty, and withal of some experience in the world, hav-
</p>
<p>ing lived in New York, Charleston, Mobile, New Orleans,

<p>and divers other places too numerous to mention.
</p>
<p>The defendant was a widower without children, far ad-
</p>
<p>vanced in years, an old citizen of St. Louis, and a man of
</p>
<p>large wealth and enterprise. He was the owner of a magnifi-
</p>
<p>JAMES R. LACKLAND. 3OI
</p>
<p>cent tract of land, embracing 1,000 acres, adjoining the
</p>
<p>city, and estimated at $1,000,000. This he had converted
</p>
<p>into a fine park, beautifully embellished, and a large garden,
</p>
<p>containing the choicest shrubs and flowers, brought at an
</p>
<p>immense expense from all parts of the world, and placed in
</p>
<p>finely finished hot-houses. Connected with this was a bo-
</p>
<p>tanical museum, with an immense botanical library, and con-
</p>
<p>taining the busts, in marble, of the most distinguished bot-
</p>
<p>anists of the world.
</p>
<p>Such was Shaw's Garden, the most attractive spot in the
</p>
<p>West, and visited daily by hundreds from every part of the
</p>
<p>United States.
</p>
<p>It is not strange, therefore, that Effie should be attracted
</p>
<p>to those beautiful grounds, nor is it strange that she should
</p>
<p>meet, while winding her way through the beds of roses and
</p>
<p>tulips, the enterprising proprietor. Nor would it have been
</p>
<p>strange if she had gently and blushingly hinted at the great
</p>
<p>happiness he would derive from permitting one of her sex
</p>
<p>to become a joint occupant of this earthly paradise. Be that
</p>
<p>as it may, he was afterwards seen to enter the Carstang man-
</p>
<p>sion, and was profuse in his gifts of flowers, and lavish in his
</p>
<p>praises of the beautiful Effie. But all things must have an
</p>
<p>end, and so it was with this little harmless flirtation, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Shaw's visits became less in number. And the result was a
</p>
<p>suit for damages as the only panacea for blighted hopes and
</p>
<p>disappointed affection.
</p>
<p>Uriel Wright and L. M. Shreve appeared for the plaint-
</p>
<p>iff, and Edward Bates and John R. Shepley for the defense
</p>
<p> all lawyers of high professional distinction.
</p>
<p>Without a particle of evidence to establish the promise,
</p>
<p>beyond a few visits, the loan of a piano, the presentation of
</p>
<p>a few flowers, and the loose, contradictory statements of the
</p>
<p>widowed sister, the wise and far-seeing jury awarded her
</p>
<p>^100,000.

<p>Had half the city been sunk by an earthquake, the peo-
</p>
<p>ple could not have been more astonished. From that day
</p>
<p>to this no man has been found who will admit that he was
</p>
<p>one of the jury; and the press of the city has been daily dis-
</p>
<p>302 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>cussing the wisdom of our jury system. No more do we
</p>
<p>hear of the boasted right of trial by jury, or the blessing
</p>
<p>conferred upon mankind by the 29th chapter of King John's
</p>
<p>Great Charter.
</p>
<p>As may well be supposed, the verdict was set aside and
</p>
<p>a new trial awarded. Mr. Lackland and Mr. Glover were
</p>
<p>then retained in the case by Mr. Shaw, and Mr. Lackland
</p>
<p>assumed the labor of preparing for another trial. He went
</p>
<p>to Brooklyn and the other places above mentioned, and took
</p>
<p>depositions in each, obtained a history of the fair lady, and
</p>
<p>on the next trial the jury gave a verdict for the defendant.
</p>
<p>What a theme for contemplation ! What a commentary
</p>
<p>upon our mode of trying issues of fact! One jury awards
</p>
<p>one hundred thousand dollars  another, )iot a cent ; and upon
</p>
<p>evidence tending to the same point, though upon the last
</p>
<p>trial more decided and unequivocal.
</p>
<p>In the preparation and trial of the case the defendant's
</p>
<p>counsel obtained the highest encomiums from the bar. It is
</p>
<p>a great loss to the profession that we omitted to preserve a
</p>
<p>full record of the case, and the arguments of counsel.
</p>
<p>It cost Mr. Shaw about ^$20,000 to get rid of the work of
</p>
<p>a stupid jury, and what makes it exceedingly mortifying to
</p>
<p>a St. Louisian is that Mr. Shaw at the time had publicly an-
</p>
<p>nounced his intention to donate most of his beautiful estate
</p>
<p>to St. Louis for public purposes, and has since so done.
</p>
<p>Judge Lackland had none of the graces of oratory, but he
</p>
<p>possessed what was of far more importance  a strong, log-
</p>
<p>ical, and analytical mind, full of resources, and of remark-
</p>
<p>ably quick perceptions. His knowledge of men was very
</p>
<p>great, and enabled him to reap a large advantage in impanel-
</p>
<p>ing a jury. .Few men could excel him in the cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion of a witness. There was something in his manner that
</p>
<p>inspired a witness with fear, and caused him frequently to so
</p>
<p>qualify his testimony as to greatly impair its effect. If sat-

</p>
<p>isfied that the witness was telling the truth, and not exag-
</p>
<p>gerating, he would put as few questions to him as possible,
</p>
<p>and dismiss him with a manner indicating that he did not re-
</p>
<p>gard the testimony as of much importance. He knew how
</p>
<p>JAMES R. LACKLAND. 3O3
</p>
<p>far to push a witness, and when to stop  a gift that is by no
</p>
<p>means common in the profession. He was not particular in
</p>
<p>the choice of language, and sometimes did violence to the
</p>
<p>king's English. He was too much in the habit of using
</p>
<p>slang phrases, and often employed words that would puzzle
</p>
<p>a Webster or a Worcester to give the derivation of One in
</p>
<p>particular he frequently used. If a speech was pompous, or,
</p>
<p>as is sometimes called, spread-eagle, he would say it was
</p>
<p>higJifalutin.
</p>
<p>Judge Lackland was a man of the highest integrity, and
</p>
<p>abhorred trickery and deception above all things. When
</p>
<p>off the bench he never would permit an attorney or suitor to
</p>
<p>speak in his presence of the merits of a case pending in his
</p>
<p>court. By the outside world he was regarded as cold, aus-
</p>
<p>tere, and unfeeling ; but such was not the character he sus-
</p>
<p>tained among those who held social relations with him.
</p>
<p>For many years before his death he was in very bad
</p>
<p>health, suffering daily from physical pain, compelled to go
</p>
<p>long distances from home for climatic change, and no doubt
</p>
<p>while in that condition often appeared abrupt, morose, and
</p>
<p>unsociable. But those who met him in the family circle,
</p>
<p>and to whom he expressed his thoughts freely, credit him
</p>
<p>with a large heart and sympathetic feeling. Our relations
</p>
<p>with him were not of that intimate kind which would enable
</p>
<p>us to form, in that respect, a reliable judgment.
</p>
<p>His death occurred on October 9, 1875, and his remains

<p>repose in Bellefontaine Cemetery.
</p>
<p>Charles B. lord,
</p>
<p>Who for many years was judge of the St. Louis Land Court,
</p>
<p>came to Missouri as early as 1843. He was born in Thomas-
</p>
<p>ton, state of Maine, on July 13, 1810, and received an aca-
</p>
<p>demic education in Onondaga County, New York, to which
</p>
<p>place his parents had removed. When only nine years of
</p>
<p>age he was threatened with chastisement by the principal of
</p>
<p>the school, upon a charge that afterwards proved to be false,
</p>
<p>and, to avoid what he conceived to be an unjust punish-
</p>
<p>ment, ran away from the institution, a distance of twenty
</p>
<p>miles from home, in midwinter, sleeping one night under a
</p>
<p>hay-stack. This determination not to submit to injustice,
</p>
<p>evinced at so early a period, characterized his whole life. It
</p>
<p>does not appear that he ever entered any college, though he
</p>
<p>obtained a good English education, and became a fair Latin
</p>
<p>scholar.
</p>
<p>He commenced his law studies in the office of his brother,
</p>
<p>the late Dr. John C. Lord, of Buffalo, who abandoned the
</p>
<p>legal for the clerical profession. His legal studies were
</p>
<p>completed with Truman Hastings, Esq., ^ith whom he be-
</p>
<p>came associated in the practice. He was admitted to the
</p>
<p>bar in 1833 or 1834, and practiced in Buffalo until he came
</p>
<p>to St. Louis, in 1843. Here he formed a partnership with
</p>
<p>Myron Leslie, a lawyer of fine talents and decided genius.
</p>
<p>The firm did a large business, and continued till the death
</p>
<p>of Mr. Leslie, about five years, when Judge Lord became
</p>
<p>associated in the practice with Isaac H. Kiem, Esq.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the Legislature created the St. Louis
</p>
<p>Land Court, with jurisdiction limited to suits pertaining to
</p>
<p>real estate, the object being to relieve the Circuit Court of
</p>
<p>the great pressure of business then on its docket. Edward

<p>Bates was appointed judge, who held the office until his
</p>
<p>CHARLES B. LORD. 305
</p>
<p>death, in 1869, when Judge Lord was appointed to succeed
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>As a lawyer Judge Lord was quite successful, for he was
</p>
<p>a fine special pleader, and prepared his cases with much care
</p>
<p>and deliberation. He made no attempt at oratory, and sel-
</p>
<p>dom indulged in a lengthy harangue. His main reliance
</p>
<p>was upon his knowledge of the law, and a careful prepara
</p>
<p>tion for trial.
</p>
<p>We knew him chiefly as a judge, for we practiced before
</p>
<p>him during his entire judicial career. His thorough knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of the law pertaining to real estate, and his active, in-
</p>
<p>dustrious habits, enabled him to render a very efficient and
</p>
<p>satisfactory discharge of the duties of his office, though he
</p>
<p>had some faults which affected his popularity with the bar.
</p>
<p>He was at times very petulant and irritable, and often in-
</p>
<p>dulged in language which was very offensive to those prac-
</p>
<p>ticing in his court. Particularly was he so towards the
</p>
<p>younger members of the profession, for whom he had but
</p>
<p>little charity or kind feeling. He often chided them with
</p>
<p>ignorance of the law, and did so with a manner that was
</p>
<p>peculiarly offensive. It is true that the older members of
</p>
<p>the profession did not escape, but they could overlook it.
</p>
<p>We have frequently heard him tell young practitioners to go
</p>
<p>to their office and study the law before coming into his
</p>
<p>court to practice. The result was that young lawyers
</p>
<p>avoided his court rather than subject themselves to his ex-
</p>
<p>hibitions of temper. But, as a set-off to this, he was strictly
</p>
<p>honest and upright, and endeavored to mete out justice to
</p>
<p>parties litigant. Particularly was he careful of the rights of
</p>
<p>infants and married women, and would go any length to
</p>
<p>protect them from the avarice or misconduct of executors,
</p>
<p>administrators, guardians, etc. If an infant was not properly
</p>
<p>represented, he would appoint some discreet attorney to
</p>
<p>represent his or her interests, with an injunction to give due

</p>
<p>and proper consideration to the case. This quality in a
</p>
<p>judge is almost inestimable.
</p>
<p>St. Louis had, for over a quarter of a century, a probate
</p>
<p>judge named Peter Ferguson, who abused, insulted, and vili-
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>3o6 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>fied every person who had business in his court. The law-
</p>
<p>yers were all thieves and plunderers ; every executor was
</p>
<p>trying to cheat the estate ; every guardian was endeavoring
</p>
<p>to swindle his ward; every witness swore falsely  in fact,
</p>
<p>no one came into his court without receiving a share of his
</p>
<p>honor's abuse. But no man ever sat on the probate bench
</p>
<p>who guarded the rights of infants, orphans, and married
</p>
<p>women more scrupulously than Peter Ferguson ; and when
</p>
<p>Peter Ferguson came before the people for reelection, no
</p>
<p>man could beat him.
</p>
<p>We once witnessed a scene between him and the late
</p>
<p>Governor Trusten Polk, which was so characteristic of the
</p>
<p>judge we cannot avoid giving it. Governor Polk drew the
</p>
<p>will of the late George Collier, a very wealthy merchant,
</p>
<p>who left an estate of several millions, and a very long will,
</p>
<p>containing many trusts, powers, settlements, etc. It required
</p>
<p>an immense amount of labor, and much care and skill, to
</p>
<p>draw it. For this and other services rendered by the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor he presented a bill against the estate for $^oo, which
</p>
<p>gave rise to the following dialogue :
</p>
<p>"H'm! What is this? H'm ! Another lawyer's bill 
</p>
<p>trying to swindle the widows and orphans. Do you think I
</p>
<p>am agoing to allow such a bill as this ? "
</p>
<p>" If your honor please, I will prove by Mr. Glover, Mr.
</p>
<p>Shepley, Mr. Hill, and others that the bill is very rea-
</p>
<p>sonable."
</p>
<p>"H'm! I suppose so  one lawyer helping another to
</p>
<p>swindle the poor widows and orphans. H'm ! And you
</p>
<p>expect me to sit here and permit it? H'm! I shall do no
</p>
<p>such thing."
</p>
<p>Here Messrs. Glover, Shepley, and Hill were sworn as wit-
</p>
<p>nesses, who testified that the services were reasonably worth
</p>
<p>the amount charged.
</p>
<p>"H'm! Just what I expected; and when you want to

<p>swindle some estate, you will bring Mr. Polk here as a wit-
</p>
<p>ness to help you do it! H'm! I suppose I must allow it;
</p>
<p>but don't you show your face here again until you can learn
</p>
<p>to be an honest man."
</p>
<p>CHARLES B. LORD. 307
</p>
<p>Exit Governor Polk, with his claim allowed for the full
</p>
<p>amount.
</p>
<p>It is proper here to state that Judge Ferguson, who had
</p>
<p>reached his three-score and ten, was a good friend of Mr.
</p>
<p>Polk, and was satisfied at the commencement that the claim
</p>
<p>was just, and intended to allow it; but he could not let the
</p>
<p>opportunity pass without giving the lawyers a rap on the
</p>
<p>knuckles.
</p>
<p>Judge Lord was very fond of fishing, and generally spent
</p>
<p>his summer vacations at Green Bay, and other points that
</p>
<p>were noted for such sports. He would discourse upon the
</p>
<p>art for hours at a time, but never could tolerate an opinion
</p>
<p>adverse to his own. He was convivial in his habits, fond of
</p>
<p>a good dinner, and loved to have his friends enjoy it with
</p>
<p>him ; and on such occasions could make himself very enter-
</p>
<p>taining.
</p>
<p>He died in St. Louis, in November, 1868, in his fifty-ninth

<p>year.
</p>
<p>Benjamin Sharp.
</p>
<p>In 1848 we made a successful canvass of the Second Con-
</p>
<p>gressional District, having for our opponent the Hon. Gil-
</p>
<p>christ Porter, who from that day to this has been our warm
</p>
<p>and steadfast friend. An abler jurist and a more refined
</p>
<p>gentleman we seldom meet.
</p>
<p>In filling an appointment at Danville, Montgomery
</p>
<p>County, we became acquainted with Benjamin Sharp, then
</p>
<p>clerk of the Circuit Court of that county, and a lawyer of
</p>
<p>acknowledged ability. The Whig party largely predomi-
</p>
<p>nated in Montgomery County, and Mr. Sharp was its head
</p>
<p>and front. In an hour or two after reaching the hotel he
</p>
<p>called upon us, and during our stay in his town treated us
</p>
<p>with marked kindness and civility. Though differing polit-
</p>
<p>ically, and at a time when party spirit was running very high,
</p>
<p>he took particular pains to introduce us to the leading men
</p>
<p>of both parties, for which we felt and expressed no little
</p>
<p>gratitude.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp was a native of Jonesville, Virginia, and born
</p>
<p>April 10, 1820. He studied law with his father, who had a
</p>
<p>large practice in that state. He received a good academic
</p>
<p>education, and at one time contemplated entering the army,
</p>
<p>and for that purpose attended the military school at Lex-
</p>
<p>ington. We are unable to state how long he remained
</p>
<p>there, nor do we know what induced him to embark in the
</p>
<p>legal profession; but the probability is that he was influ-
</p>
<p>enced by the wishes of his fiither. In November, 1842, he
</p>
<p>married Miss Sarah E. Rebeck, of Lee County, Virginia,
</p>
<p>and two years from that time moved to Missouri and settled
</p>
<p>at Danville, and was shortly afterwards admitted to the bar.
</p>
<p>For a considerable period of time he represented his dis-
</p>
<p>trict in the State Senate, and became an acknowledged

</p>
<p>leader of his party. He took an active part in the debates,
</p>
<p>BENJAMIN SHARP. 3O9
</p>
<p>and, by the aid of a strong, practical intellect, exerted a
</p>
<p>large and salutary influence upon all questions of public
</p>
<p>policy. Though a man of great force of character, and very
</p>
<p>decided convictions, he was tolerant of the opinions of
</p>
<p>others, and never assumed or arrogated to himself mental
</p>
<p>superiority. His influence proceeded more from his admit-
</p>
<p>ted ability than any attempt to secure popular favor.
</p>
<p>During the war he took strong ground in favor of the
</p>
<p>Union, and, by his zealous advocacy of the war measures of
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's Administration, provoked the hostility of the
</p>
<p>rebel element of his section of the state, which sought and
</p>
<p>accomplished his death. He was brutally murdered at Mar-
</p>
<p>tinsburg, in July, 1 86 1. He left a widow and four children,
</p>
<p>most of whom reside in Montgomery City.
</p>
<p>We never saw Mr. Sharp at the bar, and are not sufii-
</p>
<p>ciently posted as to his legal attainments to enable us to
</p>
<p>describe them with that accuracy which is necessary in
</p>
<p>biographical literature; but the fact that he had a large
</p>
<p>practice, and was very successful, ought to leave no doubt
</p>
<p>of his professional skill.
</p>
<p>He was a heavy, thick-set man, rather low in stature, with
</p>
<p>a broad and high forehead, and an intellectual cast of coun-

<p>WILLIAM C. CARR.
</p>
<p>Judge William C. Carr was one of the earliest American
</p>
<p>residents of St. Louis. He came here in 1804, the same
</p>
<p>year that John Scott, Edward Hempstead, and Rufus Easton
</p>
<p>arrived in the territory. St. Louis had then a population but
</p>
<p>little exceeding 1,000, and the only American resident fam-
</p>
<p>ilies were those of William Sullivan and Calvin Adams, St.
</p>
<p>Genevieve had the largest population of any town in the ter-
</p>
<p>ritory, and was thought to be the most desirable location for
</p>
<p>a lawyer. Its population is not much more now, while that
</p>
<p>of St. Louis is 500,000 and increasing at the rate of 20,000
</p>
<p>per annum. St. Genevieve had greatly the advantage in
</p>
<p>wealth and society, and as both were located on the Father
</p>
<p>of Waters, and on the great highway to the gulf, there
</p>
<p>seemed to be but little reason for giving St. Louis the pref-
</p>
<p>erence, more particularly as St. Genevieve was adjacent to
</p>
<p>a rich mining country.
</p>
<p>William C. Carr was the son of Walter Carr, and born in
</p>
<p>Albemarle County, Virginia, April 15, 1783. Of his boy-
</p>
<p>hood and early education but little is known. He received
</p>
<p>a good academic course ; studied law in his native state ;
</p>
<p>came to Missouri at the age of twenty-one ; was admitted to
</p>
<p>the bar, and immediately entered upon the practice of his
</p>
<p>profession. He came to St. Louis directly from Louisville,
</p>
<p>and boasted that he was only twenty-five days on the route.
</p>
<p>Mr. Carr was married twice, the first time to Miss Ann Maria
</p>
<p>Elliott, of St. Genevieve, November 17, 1807, by whom he
</p>
<p>had three children, all of whom survived him. Sometime
</p>
<p>after the death of this wife, about December, 1829, he mar-
</p>
<p>ried Miss Dorcas Bent, of St. Louis, daughter of Judge Silas
</p>
<p>Bent, and sister of Captain Silas Bent, of the navy. By this
</p>
<p>wife he had six children, all of whom were living at his

<p>death. He died in St. Louis, March 31, 185 i, in his sixty-
</p>
<p>WILLIAM C. CARR. 3II
</p>
<p>eighth year. His widow is still living, and though at an
</p>
<p>advanced age, is in good health and mental vigor.
</p>
<p>He purchased a very handsome piece of ground just out-
</p>
<p>side of the old city limits, in a beautiful grove, which he
</p>
<p>greatly embellished, and upon which he resided till his
</p>
<p>death. It was always known as " Carr Place," and was,
</p>
<p>until within twenty years past, a favorite place of resort for
</p>
<p>picnic and other parties.
</p>
<p>About 1826 Mr. Carr was appointed judge of the St. Louis
</p>
<p>Circuit Court, which position he held until the latter part of
</p>
<p>1833, when he resigned. He was a well-read lawyer, and
</p>
<p>must have stood high at the bar, for at that time the power
</p>
<p>of appointment was vested in the governor and the Senate,
</p>
<p>and was rarely exercised except upon the recommendation
</p>
<p>of the bar; and it is not likely that such men as Geyer, Bates,
</p>
<p>Gamble, Allen, Lawless, and Spalding would have sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned the appointment if he had been deficient in any of
</p>
<p>the qualities of a good jurist. Nevertheless, he had enemies
</p>
<p>who conspired to drive him from the bench, and succeeded
</p>
<p>in procuring articles of impeachment by the Legislature.
</p>
<p>He was charged with favoritism, partiality, prejudice, oppres-
</p>
<p>sion, neglect of duty, and incapacity.' The trial took place
</p>
<p>in the winter of 1832-3, and, after a tedious and protracted
</p>
<p>investigation, he was acquitted. He found his position on
</p>
<p>the bench very irksome, and, after holding it about a year
</p>
<p>longer, resigned.
</p>
<p>Judge Carr's circuit embraced several counties besides
</p>
<p>St. Louis. It took in Gasconade County, which then ex-
</p>
<p>tended as far west as the Osage River, and in a southerly
</p>
<p>and south-westerly direction nearly, if not quite, to the
</p>
<p>Arkansas line.
</p>
<p>So large was the extent of country within the limits of
</p>
<p>this old county that it was called the " state of Gasconade."

<p>bore the title of " governor of the state of Gasconade." The
</p>
<p>chief part of the laboring population found employment in
</p>
<p>the numerous saw-mills on the Gasconade, Big Piney, and
</p>
<p>Little Piney Rivers. The country abounded in extensive pine

<p>312 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>forests, and the lumber was rafted to St. Louis by way of the
</p>
<p>Gasconade and Missouri Rivers.
</p>
<p>In 1838 we traversed the entire county on horseback,
</p>
<p>visited the different mills, and learned much of the character
</p>
<p>of the jolly raftsmen.
</p>
<p>We also attended the Gasconade court, which was held
</p>
<p>at Mt. Sterling, the county-seat, situated on the Gasconade
</p>
<p>River, about twenty-five miles south of the Missouri. For a
</p>
<p>quarter of a century the only buildings it contained were a log
</p>
<p>court-house with one room, and a log store. For hotel ac-
</p>
<p>commodations the only reliance was upon Mrs. Perkins, a
</p>
<p>widow, known as Aunt Beckie, who had a fine farm a quarter
</p>
<p>of a mile distant, and about twenty slaves. This good lady,
</p>
<p>who was sometimes called the " queen of Gasconade," was
</p>
<p>very small in stature, but carried 400 pounds avoirdupois
</p>
<p>weight in flesh. Her house consisted of three rooms, and in
</p>
<p>these small apartments it was not tincommon, during court
</p>
<p>time, to bed from sixty to seventy persons. She lodged and
</p>
<p>fed the judge, attorneys, grand jury, parties litigant, and
</p>
<p>witnesses. Those who could not procure admittance slept
</p>
<p>upon the ha}'-stacks and in the barn, or under tents of rude
</p>
<p>construction. When the sound of the "cornucopia" was
</p>
<p>heard, the judge and lawyers took seats at the first table;
</p>
<p>then came the grand jury and others in attendance, until
</p>
<p>the inner man was amply supplied. Aunt Beckie's bill
</p>
<p>of fire consisted of coffee sweetened with molasses, biscuit
</p>
<p>made from coarse dark flour, and baked until as hard as bill-
</p>
<p>iard-balls ; those whose teeth could not penetrate them were
</p>
<p>supplied with " corn-dodgers," baked in hot ashes. Among
</p>
<p>the meats were fried bacon and a superabundance of wild
</p>
<p>game, such as venison and turkey, and, at least once during
</p>
<p>court-week, "quail zvithont toast." Those who dine at the
</p>
<p>Lindell or Planters' House may smile at this repast, but to

<p>miles in one day, without a mouthful to eat and with an ap-
</p>
<p>petite that would make an anaconda hide his head, it was a
</p>
<p>feast for the gods.
</p>
<p>Among the lawyers who attended the court from St. Louis
</p>
<p>WILLIAM C. CARR. 313
</p>
<p>were Hamilton R. Gamble, Edward Bates, Henry S. Geyer,
</p>
<p>and our worthy and venerable friend, John F. Darby, and
</p>
<p>Philip Cole and John S. Brickey, of the Potosi bar.
</p>
<p>Mr. Darby has lately written a very interesting account of
</p>
<p>those primitive days, and has paid a worthy tribute to the
</p>
<p>memory of the good hostess, Aunt Beckie. He mentions
</p>
<p>one event worthy of repeating : A man was convicted before
</p>
<p>Judge Carr, at Mt. Sterling, for some light offense. The
</p>
<p>court imposed upon him a fine of ^5, and two hours' im-
</p>
<p>prisonment in the county jail ; but, as there were no jails in
</p>
<p>those times, the sheriff, who had been lately installed in of-
</p>
<p>fice, was at a loss to know how to execute the sentence. It
</p>
<p>is said that necessity is the mother of invention ; it certainly
</p>
<p>proved so in this case, for the officer, seeing in the rear of
</p>
<p>the store-house an old crate in which crockery had been
</p>
<p>brought from St. Louis, placed it in front of the court-house
</p>
<p>and made the culprit get under it, and summoned a guard of
</p>
<p>four fat men to sit upon it ; and in this way was the judgment
</p>
<p>of the court enforced. This novel method of imprisonment
</p>
<p>created among the by-standers much merriment. They
</p>
<p>walked around the cage, inquiring of the guard the nature
</p>
<p>of the animal confined; whether wild or tame; when and
</p>
<p>where he was caught ; upon what he was fed ; and divers
</p>
<p>other questions suggested by the occasion. As soon as the
</p>
<p>poor fellow was released he fled from the sight of his perse-
</p>
<p>cutors.
</p>
<p>In those early times the greatest crime known to the com-
</p>
<p>mon laiu of the state of Gasconade was horse-stealing. The
</p>
<p>most summary punishment immediately followed conviction.
</p>
<p>The culprit was stripped of his shirt, tied to- a post, and was
</p>
<p>made to receive on his bare back a given number of blows
</p>
<p> generally about forty  inflicted by the sheriff with a
</p>
<p>coarse lash or rawhide. It was a terrible punishment, and

</p>
<p>the stealer of horses dreaded it far more than the gallows.
</p>
<p>Spencer Pettis.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pettis was born in Virginia, had the advantages of a
</p>
<p>good education, came to Missouri about the time of the
</p>
<p>commencement of our state government, and entered upon
</p>
<p>the practice of the law in St. Louis. He was esteemed a
</p>
<p>man of fine legal attainments, and became very popular
</p>
<p>with the people. He espoused the Democratic cause, and
</p>
<p>was ardent and active in its support.
</p>
<p>In July, 1826, he was appointed to the office of secretary
</p>
<p>of state, and in 1828 resigned, and was elected to Congress.
</p>
<p>In 1830 he was reelected, beating David Barton, who for ten
</p>
<p>years represented Missouri in the United States Senate.
</p>
<p>On August 27, 1830, Mr. Pettis was killed by Major Thomas
</p>
<p>Biddle, in a duel on Bloody Island, opposite St. Louis.
</p>
<p>Major Biddle was pay-master in the army, and a brother
</p>
<p>of Nick Biddle, president of the United States Bank, and
</p>
<p>of Commodore Biddle, of the navy. He married Ann, a
</p>
<p>daughter of John Mullanphy, Esq., and resided in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>The difficulty grew out of the canvass of 1830. Mr. Pettis
</p>
<p>had issued an address to the people, in which he commented
</p>
<p>with much severity upon the course pursued by the bank,
</p>
<p>which Major Biddle construed as reflecting upon the personal
</p>
<p>integrity of his brother. The canvass itself was very excit-
</p>
<p>ing and bitter, and conducted with very little courtesy or de-
</p>
<p>corum. On July 25th, just preceding the election, Major
</p>
<p>Biddle called at the City Hotel, where Mr. Pettis was board-
</p>
<p>ing. It was early in the morning, before the boarders were
</p>
<p>up. He asked a servant to show him the room of Mr. Pet-
</p>
<p>tis. Upon entering it he found Mr. Pettis reclining upon a
</p>
<p>mattress spread upon the floor, with only a sheet around him.
</p>
<p>He was at the time in very feeble health. Major Biddle

</p>
<p>awoke him, and inflicted upon him a severe chastisement with
</p>
<p>SPENCEK PETTIS. 315
</p>
<p>a cowhide. Mr. Pettis made all the resistance in his power,
</p>
<p>which, however, was ineffectual.
</p>
<p>The friends of Mr. Pettis insisted upon his challenging
</p>
<p>Major Biddle at once, but he replied that he would not do
</p>
<p>so until after the election ; for, if he was killed, it would
</p>
<p>leave the Democratic party without a candidate (the election
</p>
<p>being only ten days off), and secure the election of his op-
</p>
<p>ponent. Judge Barton.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pettis was elected, and after the result was known, he
</p>
<p>sent the challenge. They met on Bloody Island on the even-
</p>
<p>ing of August 27, 1830. Major Biddle was near-sighted, and
</p>
<p>they fought with pistols at five paces. At the first fire both
</p>
<p>fell mortally wounded. Biddle was shot in the abdomen,
</p>
<p>and Pettis in the side, just below the chest. The fire was so
</p>
<p>simultaneous that the by-standers concluded that one of the
</p>
<p>pistbls had failed to go off. Mr. Pettis died the next day
</p>
<p>(Saturday), and Major Biddle survived till Monday. Before
</p>
<p>leaving the field, and with a knowledge that both must die,
</p>
<p>they shook hands, and expressed much regret at the result.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pettis never married, and Major Biddle left no chil-

<p>JOHN ANDERSON.
</p>
<p>This gentleman died before we came to Missouri, and was
</p>
<p>one of the earHest lawyers at the Palmyra bar. He was a
</p>
<p>Kentuckian by birth, and received a good academic educa-
</p>
<p>tion. He emigrated to Missouri about 1830, and settled at
</p>
<p>Palmyra, and died about five years afterwards.
</p>
<p>Though his professional career was short, he acquired con-
</p>
<p>siderable reputation as an orator, which soon brought him a
</p>
<p>good practice. He was well read in the law, having acquired
</p>
<p>his legal education in the Transylvania Law School, at Lex-
</p>
<p>ington. There are a few persons still living in north-east Mis-
</p>
<p>souri who recollect him as a man of fine personal appearance,
</p>
<p>with winning and agreeable manners. He was very success-
</p>
<p>ful as an advocate, and was generally employed in cases
</p>
<p>where the battle was to be fought before a jury. We have
</p>
<p>not learned that he ever held any official position.
</p>
<p>It is to be regretted that so little is known of one who bid

<p>fair to obtain professional distinction.
</p>
<p>James B. Gardenhire.
</p>
<p>There is no species of literature more neglected than
</p>
<p>biographical, and no people more amenable to the charge of
</p>
<p>such negligence than our own. The English and French
</p>
<p>people devote more attention to this branch of knowledge
</p>
<p>than probably any other, but even with them there is a cul-
</p>
<p>pable omission which admits of neither apology nor excuse.
</p>
<p>When we recall the names of the many heroes and patriotic
</p>
<p>statesmen who devoted their lives to the attainment of our in-
</p>
<p>dependence, it is sad to reflect how few of them are known,
</p>
<p>even in history, to the present generation.
</p>
<p>These reflections are induced by the fact that we have
</p>
<p>almost forgotten that there was such a man in Missouri as
</p>
<p>James B. Gardenhire; yet but few years have elapsed since
</p>
<p>the press was proclaiming his ability as a lawyer, and his
</p>
<p>patriotic efforts to advance the interests of his state. We met
</p>
<p>him the first time in Jefferson City, in the winter of 1846-7,
</p>
<p>and served with him in the Legislature then in session ;
</p>
<p>became intimate friends, continued so until his death ; and
</p>
<p>the more we knew of him the more highly did we appreciate
</p>
<p>his learning, integrity, and professional ability. He rep-
</p>
<p>resented the county of Buchanan, and proved a most faith-
</p>
<p>ful servant of the people. It was the revising session, and
</p>
<p>as both of us were on the Judiciary Committee, we had
</p>
<p>ample opportunity to estimate his services. A more atten-
</p>
<p>tive, laborious, and useful member was not found in either
</p>
<p>house.
</p>
<p>Of the boyhood and early education of General Garden-
</p>
<p>hire but little is known. He was born near Nashville, Ten-
</p>
<p>nessee, in 1 82 1, and received his legal education and was
</p>
<p>admitted to the bar in that state. He came to Missouri in
</p>
<p>1840 or 1 84 1, and settled in Sparta, then the county-seat of

<p>Buchanan County, but afterwards moved to St. Joseph.
</p>
<p>3l8 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>In September, 185 i, he was appointed, by Governor King,
</p>
<p>attorney-general of the state, to fill a vacancy; and in Au-
</p>
<p>gust, 1852, was elected by the people to the same office for
</p>
<p>a term of four years.
</p>
<p>General Gardenhire's ability as a lawyer was fully recog-
</p>
<p>nized by the Missouri bar. He had a clear, logical, compre-
</p>
<p>hensive mind, and was gifted with more than ordinary power
</p>
<p>as an orator. His speeches in the Legislature, and many of
</p>
<p>his arguments in the Supreme Court, evince a high order of
</p>
<p>mental training.
</p>
<p>Though born in a slave state, he became satisfied that
</p>
<p>slavery was a great drawback to the progress of Missouri ;
</p>
<p>that it not only impeded immigration, but kept us from
</p>
<p>attaining the capital and labor necessary to develop our agri-
</p>
<p>cultural and mineral resources. Hence he favored the system
</p>
<p>of gradual emancipation, and upon the breaking out of the
</p>
<p>war advocated its immediate abolishment. At the state elec-
</p>
<p>tion in 184- a ticket was put in the field by the anti-slavery
</p>
<p>party, and General Gardenhire's name placed at the head of
</p>
<p>it as a candidate for governor. It is within our knowledge that
</p>
<p>he was opposed to making the fight upon the slavery ques-
</p>
<p>tion at that time, for he did not think that the public mind
</p>
<p>was prepared for it ; and, as it would be generally conceded
</p>
<p>that there was no possibility of success, two-thirds of the
</p>
<p>anti-slavery men would give their vote to one or the other of
</p>
<p>the two great contending parties, and thus exliibit a weak-
</p>
<p>ness on the part of those opposed to slavery which did not
</p>
<p>exist, and the result would be detrimental to their future
</p>
<p>prospects. In this, however, he was overruled. But, not
</p>
<p>being willing to flinch from any duty assigned him, he under-
</p>
<p>took the race, and the result was that his ticket only received
</p>
<p>about 10,000 votes.
</p>
<p>In 1 86 1 he was appointed, by President Lincoln, solicitor
</p>
<p>of the Court of Claims, and moved with his family to Wash-

<p>ington City. In 1862 his health became greatly impaired,
</p>
<p>and he resigned his office and returned to Missouri, where he
</p>
<p>shortly after died.
</p>
<p>He was very diminutive in stature, and what made him
</p>
<p>JAMES B. GARDENHIRE. 319
</p>
<p>appear still more so was his habit of wearing a long frock-
</p>
<p>coat, reaching considerably below his knees, and cut in the
</p>
<p>style usually adopted by Methodist ministers. He was a
</p>
<p>devoted student through life, very temperate in his habits 
</p>
<p>even to abstemiousness  and a man of the most incorrupti-
</p>
<p>ble integrity. He was as artless as a child, and esteemed
</p>
<p>every man as honest until the contrary was shown. This
</p>
<p>often made him the victim of designing men, and led him
</p>
<p>finally to the loss of his entire property by investing it in
</p>
<p>broken lands around Jefferson City, under the persuasion
</p>
<p>that Jefferson was destined to become a great inland city,
</p>
<p>second only in commercial and manufacturing importance to
</p>
<p>St. Louis. So infatuated was he in relation to it that he
</p>
<p>would not listen to any doubt which his friends expressed.
</p>
<p>He eventually became aware of his mistake, when it was too
</p>
<p>late to avoid the catastrophe. This no doubt had an inju-
</p>
<p>rious effect upon his mind, and probably contributed to his
</p>
<p>impaired health.
</p>
<p>He left an interesting family, consisting of a wife and sev-
</p>
<p>eral children. His widow has since married General Simp-
</p>
<p>son, adjutant-general on the staff of Governor Fletcher. One
</p>
<p>of his daughters married Major Reeves Leonard, son of
</p>
<p>Abiel Leonard, and she is now a widow.
</p>
<p>As a politician General Gardenhire was firm, consistent,
</p>
<p>and reliable, and in the avowal of his opinions, open and
</p>
<p>decided. When it became necessary to assume any respon-
</p>
<p>sibftity, he did so without inquiring into its probable effect
</p>
<p>upon his own welfare. This was well illustrated in his can-
</p>
<p>didacy for the governorship on the slavery question, when he
</p>
<p>well knew that his views were in conflict with those of nine-
</p>
<p>tenths of the voters of the state. He was a bold and fear-
</p>
<p>less champion of free trade and free labor. His great sim-
</p>
<p>plicity of character, unselfishness, and candor exempted him
</p>
<p>from the jealousy of his legal associates, and made him at

<p>The primary cause of his death is unknown to us.
</p>
<p>Alfred W. Carr.
</p>
<p>This lawyer, who practiced in Troy, Lincohi County, Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, was a native of Kentucky, and born in Fayette County
</p>
<p>in 1804 or 1805. His preliminary education was obtained in
</p>
<p>the common schools, and in 1822 he entered Transylvania
</p>
<p>University, then under the presidency of Horace Holley, and
</p>
<p>graduated, among the first of his class, in July, 1824. After
</p>
<p>pursuing a regular course of legal studies, he came to Mis-
</p>
<p>souri in the summer of 1827, remaining awhile in St. Louis
</p>
<p>with his uncle, William C. Carr, who was then judge of the
</p>
<p>St. Louis Circuit Court.
</p>
<p>In 1828 he located at Troy, Lincoln County, and there en-
</p>
<p>tered upon the practice of the law. In the fall of that year
</p>
<p>he returned to Fayette County, and there married the bride
</p>
<p>of his youth. Miss Elizabeth Graves, daughter of Major Am-
</p>
<p>brose Graves, a gallant soldier who fell at the battle of the
</p>
<p>River Raison, in the War of 1812. With his bride Mr. Carr
</p>
<p>returned to Troy, Missouri, and soon became actively en-
</p>
<p>gaged in the practice of his profession, and attended the
</p>
<p>courts of Lincoln, Pike, Ralls, St. Charles, and Montgomery.
</p>
<p>Hon. Beverly Tucker was then judge of the circuit. Con-
</p>
<p>temporary with Mr. Carr were Ezra Hunt, Carty Wells,
</p>
<p>Charles S. Hempstead, John C. Naylor, and others whose
</p>
<p>names do not now occur to us. After a few years of suc-
</p>
<p>cessful practice, he was suddenly taken sick and died.
</p>
<p>The death of one so young, and with such bright prospects
</p>
<p>before him, and so universally esteemed by the people of
</p>
<p>Lincoln and the adjoining counties, was a great shock to the
</p>
<p>public mind. Had Mr. Carr lived a few years longer, he un-
</p>
<p>doubtedly would have occupied a high rank at the bar, for
</p>
<p>he had many elements of professional success. He had a
</p>
<p>fine address, a pleasant and affable demeanor, was popular

<p>Felix Hunton.
</p>
<p>This gentleman was a lawyer residing in Warsaw, Benton
</p>
<p>County, Missouri, and for many years practiced in the Sev-
</p>
<p>enth Judicial Circuit, then composed of the counties of l^en-
</p>
<p>ton, Pulaski, Polk, Greene, Barry, and Taney. Foster P.
</p>
<p>Wright was judge of the circuit, and the circuit took in
</p>
<p>almost the entire south-western part of the state.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hunton was a brother of the Hon. Logan Hunton, of
</p>
<p>the St. Louis bar, a gentleman well known for his learning
</p>
<p>and professional ability. He was the second son of Thomas
</p>
<p>and Ann Hill Hunton, and was born in Albemarle County,
</p>
<p>Virginia, in the year i8o8. The family emigrated to Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky in i8i6, and the father died there a few years after-
</p>
<p>wards, leaving a widow and seven children.
</p>
<p>Young Hunton was educated at the Stanford Academy,
</p>
<p>and at an early age showed a predilection for mercantile pur-
</p>
<p>suits ; became a merchant in Stanford, and extended his
</p>
<p>business to other points. A few years afterwards he married a
</p>
<p>Miss Taylor, who died within a year, and during his absence
</p>
<p>at one of his trading-posts. He took her death very hard,
</p>
<p>for he was a man of ardent and positive feelings and strong
</p>
<p>attachments. He never, in fact, recovered from the blow,
</p>
<p>and his friends advised him to give up his business in Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky and travel. He had a stock of goods in Tennessee
</p>
<p>and one in northern Mississippi, which, with some he had
</p>
<p>bought in Philadelphia, he sent to St. Louis, consigned to
</p>
<p>Tompkins, Blaine & Barret, commission merchants, and im-
</p>
<p>mediately afterwards their warehouse and its contents were
</p>
<p>destroyed by fire, including Mr. Hunton's goods, upon which
</p>
<p>he had no insurance. He then returned to Kentucky and
</p>
<p>commenced the study of the law, and on completing his

</p>
<p>studies, in 1839, entered upon the practice at Warsaw. He
</p>
<p>FELIX HUNTON. 323
</p>
<p>had previously, however, in 1831, opened a mercantile house
</p>
<p>in Lexington, Missouri, which he soon abandoned.
</p>
<p>His talents, industry, energy, and exemplary habits soon
</p>
<p>gave him a good practice, and he at once took a high rank in
</p>
<p>the profession. Among those who practiced at that time in
</p>
<p>the south-western circuit, residing at Warsaw, were C. P. Bul-
</p>
<p>lock, D. C. Ballou, Benjamin P. Major, George Dixon, Mark
</p>
<p>L. Means, and Thomas Ruffin. Phelps, Yancey, Waddle,
</p>
<p>and Hendricks, of Springfield, practiced in the same courts.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hunton had no inclination for office, and never would
</p>
<p>permit his name to be used as a candidate ; hence he filled
</p>
<p>no public position. He acquired a competency, and pur-
</p>
<p>chased a handsome farm in the vicinity of Warsaw, upon
</p>
<p>which he resided till his death in 1873.
</p>
<p>He left no family, but a large circle of friends who greatly

</p>
<p>esteemed him for his high moral worth and strict integrity.
</p>
<p>William Scott.
</p>
<p>It is exceedingly gratifying to us to be able to contribute
</p>
<p>something towards preserving the memory of one of the
</p>
<p>ablest and purest men that ever wore the judicial ermine in
</p>
<p>our state.
</p>
<p>William Scott was born in Warrenton, Fauquier County,
</p>
<p>Virginia, June 7, 1804. He received a good E iglish educa-
</p>
<p>tion at the Fauquier Academy, but never acquired a knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of the classics, nor did he ever become very proficient
</p>
<p>in English literature. It is said that Judge Swayne, of the
</p>
<p>United States Supreme Court, and Senator Foote, of Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi, were his classmates.
</p>
<p>Judge Scott commenced the study of the law at the age of
</p>
<p>eighteen, with Inman Horner, an able lawyer of Warrenton,
</p>
<p>and was admitted to the bar on reaching his majority. He
</p>
<p>could not have practiced much, if any, in Virginia, for in the
</p>
<p>fall of 1826 he came to Missouri, and settled in old Franklin,
</p>
<p>Howard County. He was not very successful as a lawyer,
</p>
<p>though one of the best-read lawyers of his age. He seemed
</p>
<p>to be disqualified for the practice, by reason of his excitable
</p>
<p>temperament. The least thing would annoy and vex him,
</p>
<p>and he would at times become so irritated and confused as
</p>
<p>to be thrown completely off his guard, thereby opening the
</p>
<p>way to his opponent for an easy victory. By reason of this
</p>
<p>defect in his character as a lawyer, his friends, who h id a
</p>
<p>high appreciation of his knowledge of the law, made a suc-
</p>
<p>cessful effort to place him on the bench, and he was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed by the governor, about 1835, judge of the Ninth
</p>
<p>Judicial Circuit, embracing the counties of Franklin, Gas-
</p>
<p>conade, Jefferson, Washington, Perry, and St. Frangois, and
</p>
<p>he took up his residence on a small farm about four miles
</p>
<p>south of Union, the county-seat of Franklin County.

</p>
<p>We there visited him in the winter of 1836-7, and a warm
</p>
<p>WILLIAM SCOTT. 325
</p>
<p>friendship was created between us, which lasted till his
</p>
<p>death. This enables us to speak of his character and attain-
</p>
<p>ments from a personal knowledge.
</p>
<p>In 1835 he married Elizabeth J. Dixon, of Cole County, an
</p>
<p>estimable lady, who bore him six children, and made him a
</p>
<p>most devoted wife.
</p>
<p>As a Jiis-i-pnits ]udgQ he was very successful  so much so
</p>
<p>that he attracted the attention of many of the prominent
</p>
<p>lawyers in the state, who expressed a strong desire to see
</p>
<p>him on the bench of the Supreme Court, to which position
</p>
<p>he was appointed in August, 1841, and soon became pre-
</p>
<p>siding judge. Judge Scott became one of the most eminent
</p>
<p>and profound jurists that ever adorned the Western bench,
</p>
<p>and his opinions, contained in the Missouri Reports from 1838
</p>
<p>to i860, form no inconsiderable part of our judicial learning.
</p>
<p>After his appointment to the supreme bench he returned to
</p>
<p>Cole County, and spent the remainder of his life on a farm a
</p>
<p>few miles west of Jefferson City.
</p>
<p>He died at his residence. May 18, 1862, in his fifty-eighth
</p>
<p>year.
</p>
<p>Whilst nature had bestowed upon him a vigorous intellect,
</p>
<p>she withheld from him all the graces of person. He was
</p>
<p>very large, and must have weighed, when in health, at least
</p>
<p>250 pounds, and was as awkward as large. His supera-
</p>
<p>bundance of flesh was a great burden to him, and it was with
</p>
<p>the utmost difficulty that he could walk any distance without
</p>
<p>getting out of breath. He had a swaggering walk, much
</p>
<p>like that of a sailor when he lands from a long and boister-
</p>
<p>ous voyage.
</p>
<p>The judge had a morbid fear of drowning, and while on
</p>
<p>the circuit bench had to ford, on horseback, several streams
</p>
<p>to reach his courts, there being no bridges and very few
</p>
<p>ferries at that period. We frequently accompanied him, and
</p>
<p>upon one occasion, during a very cold day in the winter, we

</p>
<p>had to ford the Meramec River. A rain the day before had
</p>
<p>swelled the stream, and, as he was unable to swim, he in-
</p>
<p>sisted upon our leading the way ; and when we reached the
</p>
<p>opposite bank, he started in, dragging his feet through the
</p>
<p>326 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>cold water all the way. We afterwards learned that this was
</p>
<p>an invariable custom with him, resulting from a fear of falling
</p>
<p>from his horse ; and it annoyed him no little to find that
</p>
<p>those who accompanied him escaped a cold foot-bath.
</p>
<p>Judge Scott had no force whatever as a speaker, and
</p>
<p>never attempted to address a promiscuous assembly, nor did
</p>
<p>he cultivate any of the arts of elocution. As a judge he
</p>
<p>was eminently just, and never would permit a wrong to be
</p>
<p>perpetrated if in his power to prevent it. He had a high
</p>
<p>appreciation of justice and fair dealing. We well recollect
</p>
<p>that, while holding a term of his court in Gasconade County,
</p>
<p>the sheriff was endeavoring to sell under execution a farm
</p>
<p>belonging to a man who was poor, and unable to satisfy the
</p>
<p>judgment against him. The highest bid he received was $20
</p>
<p>for land well worth $500. The judge, on learning the facts,
</p>
<p>directed the sheriff to stop the sale, declaring, in a very em-
</p>
<p>phatic way, "that as long as he sat on the bench, no man's
</p>
<p>home should be taken from him for so paltry a sum."
</p>
<p>This is not unlike the course of Judge Grier, late of the
</p>
<p>United States Supreme Court, who, when holding a court in
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, became greatly outraged at a verdict of a jury,
</p>
<p>and, as the clerk was about to enter it, said : " Mr. Clerk,
</p>
<p>that verdict is set aside by the court. It may as well be
</p>
<p>understood that in this state it takes thirteen men to steal a
</p>
<p>man's farm."
</p>
<p>Judge Scott followed strictl}' the legal maxim, " l^^oni
</p>
<p>Judicis est ajnpliare jurisdiciionem.'' It is not to be under-
</p>
<p>stood, however, that he would transcend the law to mete out
</p>
<p>justice, but where a statute could possibly admit of more
</p>
<p>than one construction, or where there was the least room for
</p>
<p>any doubt as to the law, he would accept that which in his
</p>
<p>judgment best tended to subserve the ends of justice.
</p>
<p>Although in this state we have abolished in form some of
</p>
<p>the distinctions between law and equity, yet he never lost

<p>sight of the fact that he was still a chancellor, with the same
</p>
<p>power to enforce the principles of equity as formerly. This
</p>
<p>blending of law and equity has its advantages as well as dis-
</p>
<p>advantages, and in the hands of a just judge, possessing a
</p>
<p>WILLIAM SCOTT. 327
</p>
<p>fine sense of discrimination, may be wielded largely in the"
</p>
<p>maintenance of ric;lil and justice.
</p>
<p>Nothing" so rufticd the judge's temper as an attempt to
</p>
<p>perpetrate a tVaud ; and when he h.id occasion to deliver an
</p>
<p>opinion in a case the K-ast tainted in that respect, his denun-
</p>
<p>ciation Wcis nicjst scathing.
</p>
<p>The f)rmer custom of the Supreme Court was to announce
</p>
<p>that on a certain day the court would dch\cr oj^inions, \\hich
</p>
<p>always brought to the court-room a large number of attor-
</p>
<p>neys. Each judge read the oi)inions written by him, and on
</p>
<p>one of these occasions. Judge Scott, while reading an opin-
</p>
<p>ion in a case in which a guardian had defrauded his ward,
</p>
<p>rose from his seat, and, in a most violent and excited man-
</p>
<p>ner, declared that the scoundrel richly deserved the halter.
</p>
<p>By an act of the Constitutional Convention, in the early
</p>
<p>part of the Rebellion, the offices of the judiciary were
</p>
<p>declared vacant, and Judge Scott died shortly afterwards.
</p>
<p>We do not know^ that he was a disunionist, but he unques-
</p>
<p>tionably sympathized with the Confederacy.
</p>
<p>Judge Scott was a man of kind heart and generous
</p>
<p>impulses, and for strict, unswerving, unrelenting integrity he
</p>
<p>had no superior. He would have been regarded as an
</p>
<p>honest man even in the da}'s of Sam Johnson, when but
</p>
<p>little charity was felt for the legal fraternity. Jeafferson says
</p>
<p>that Johnson was once passing a church in Surrey, and see-
</p>
<p>ing some people weeping over a grave, asked one of the
</p>
<p>women why they wept. "Oh," said she, "we have lossed
</p>
<p>our precious lawyer. Justice Randall; he kept us all in
</p>
<p>peace, and always was so good as to keep us from going to
</p>
<p>law  the best man overlived." "Well," said Johnson, "I
</p>
<p>will send you an epitaph to write upon his tomb ; " which
</p>
<p>was:
</p>
<p>"God works wonders now and Ihcn 
</p>
<p>Here lies a lawyer an honest man."

</p>
<p>Johnson was not alone in his estimate of lawyers, for when
</p>
<p>Peter the Great first visited London he expressed much sur-
</p>
<p>prise at seeing so many lawyers. " Why," said he, " I have
</p>
<p>28 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>but two in my whole kingdom, and I shall hang one of them
</p>
<p>as soon as I get home."
</p>
<p>Among the attaches of the court while Judge Scott was
</p>
<p>on the bench was Billy Hart, a fine-looking and intelligent
</p>
<p>mulatto, who as janitor served the court faithfully fora-quar-
</p>
<p>ter of a century, and was a universal favorite with the bar.
</p>
<p>Billy was one of the finest of mimics, and could personate
</p>
<p>either of the judges in voice, language, and manner. Often,
</p>
<p>to amuse the attorneys, he would (before the arrival of the
</p>
<p>judges) take a seat upon the bench, and deliver an opinion
</p>
<p>in the name of any one called for. Billy was a man of infi-
</p>
<p>nite jest, and notwithstanding the judges knew that they
</p>
<p>were constantly the objects of his wit and satire, yet they
</p>
<p>were inseparable, for he was most attentive to their wants,
</p>
<p>and could bear with composure any amount of scolding.
</p>
<p>Billy had many trite sayings, one of which was that however
</p>
<p>united liis court might be upon most questions, there was one
</p>
<p>upon which Judges Scott and Napton could never agree,
</p>
<p>and that was as to the temperature that should be observed
</p>
<p>in the court-room during the winter.
</p>
<p>To appreciate Billy's story the reader must know that
</p>
<p>Judge Scott, as before stated, was a man weighing 250
</p>
<p>pounds, while Judge Napton, who was very thin and spare,
</p>
<p>could not have exceeded no. But we will let Billy tell his
</p>
<p>own story :
</p>
<p>"Judge Napton," said he "generally entered the court-
</p>
<p>room first, with his overcoat buttoned to the throat, and
</p>
<p>would immediately mount me for not having a better fire.
</p>
<p>' Good God ! Billy,' he would say, ' do you think I am a Lap-
</p>
<p>lander, and can digest an iceberg? Fire up, Billy; fire up.*
</p>
<p>"In a short time Judge Scott would make his appearance,
</p>
<p>and immediately open his vest, take off his cravat, and
</p>
<p>begin to puff and blow like a porpoise. ' Billy, what does
</p>
<p>this mean? Do you take me for a Hottentot? Open the

</p>
<p>stove-door, and throw up the window. For God's sake, man,
</p>
<p>don't roast us alive.'
</p>
<p>"Judge Napton would shiver like an aspen-leaf, while the
</p>
<p>perspiration would flow in torrents from the face of Judge
</p>
<p>WILLIAM SCOTT. 329
</p>
<p>Scott. From this conflict of opinion," said Billy, "there
</p>
<p>was no appeal, and my only escape was in the opening of
</p>
<p>the court. Sometimes the two judges would lock horns, and
</p>
<p>I would escape to the anteroom, under the pretense of
</p>
<p>cleaning up."
</p>
<p>Billy was also janitor in the United States District Court,
</p>
<p>and frequently said that when Judge Wells entertained any
</p>
<p>doubt as to the law, he always did him the honor to consult
</p>
<p>hinir
</p>
<p>Judge Napton is the only survivor of the court. Even
</p>
<p>Billy has been g:ithered to his fathers.
</p>
<p>Judge Scott died comparatively young, but his life was
</p>
<p>one of great usefulness, and the people of Missouri will long
</p>
<p>remember him as one of their most faithful public servants.
</p>
<p>"That life is long which answers life's great end."
</p>
<p>Judge Scott had a good memory in regard to most mat-
</p>
<p>ters, but was very deficient in respect to the names of per-
</p>
<p>sons, which was often the occasion of embarrassing mistakes.
</p>
<p>Chancellor Kent had the same infirmity, though to a much
</p>
<p>greater extent. The following admirable story is told upon
</p>
<p>him by Mr. Edwards, in his " Pleasantries."
</p>
<p>Upon one occasion he was accosted in the street by a gen-
</p>
<p>tleman with whom he was well acquainted, but whose name
</p>
<p>had slipped his memory. " Good morning. Chancellor," said
</p>
<p>the gentleman. " H'm, ha!" said his honor, "I was want-
</p>
<p>ing to see you to ask you to spell me your name. My wife
</p>
<p>and myself had quite a discussion last evening as to how it
</p>
<p>should be spelt." "How do yoii spell it. Chancellor?" in-
</p>
<p>quired his acquaintance, in reply, perfectly understanding the
</p>
<p>object of the chancellor's question. His honor seemed
</p>
<p>posed, but rallied, however, and returned to the attack.
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Kent is a most obstinate woman, and always thinks
</p>
<p>herself right. She persists in spelling your name in her own
</p>
<p>way, which, I am sure, is not as you spell it." " How does

</p>
<p>she spell it?" inquired the other. The poor chancellor was
</p>

</p>
<p>Avhcn the gentleman remarked, " Really, C'lianccllor, I should
</p>
<p>not think there could be much discussion as to the proper
</p>
<p>spelling of S-m-i-l-h, Smith." "Yes," exclaimed the chan-
</p>
<p>cellor, triumi)lKinll}', " Mrs. Kent alwaws insists on spelling it
</p>
<p>S-m-y-t-h. A very obstinate woman is Mrs. Kent, and never
</p>
<p>will be convinced that she is in the wrong." The best of the
</p>
<p>joke was that the gentleman's name was Hamilton.
</p>
<p>Judge Scott was the personification of truth, and he would
</p>
<p>sacrifice everything to maintain it. He could not even enjoy
</p>
<p>a good piece of wit, or a good joke or anecdote, if it was at
</p>
<p>the expense of truth. He esteemed it indispensable to any
</p>
<p>one who made the least pretensions to honesty ; and when
</p>
<p>on the nisi-prins bench, would become restless and excited
</p>
<p>if he thought a witness was attempting to prevaricate. We
</p>
<p>speak advisedly when we say that a more honest or upright
</p>
<p>judge never sat on the Western bench. The judge had one
</p>
<p>weakness which was very noticeable. In writing his opinions
</p>
<p>he made fre(iuent use of Latin quotations. Though not a
</p>
<p>classical scholar, he seemed to think that they gave the opin-
</p>
<p>ions a semblance of deep learning. To avoid any mistakes in
</p>
<p>his quotations, he always kept by him a book of legal max-

</p>
<p>A. B. Chambers.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, who for eighteen years was editor and
</p>
<p>part proprietor of the Missouri Republican, a journal which
</p>
<p>for half a century has exerted an almost unlimited influence
</p>
<p>over the public mind of the West, was once a prominent law-
</p>
<p>yer in north-east Missouri, and bid fair to attain the highest
</p>
<p>distinction in his profession. Yet there are but few now
</p>
<p>living who recollect him as a mere lawyer.
</p>
<p>Adam Black Chambers was born in Mercer, Mercer County,
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, January 9, 1808, and received an academic ed-
</p>
<p>ucation in that state. In 1830 he came to St. Louis, and after
</p>
<p>remaining there a few weeks removed to Bowling Green, in
</p>
<p>Pike County, where he completed his legal studies and was
</p>
<p>admitted to the bar. It was not long before he was appointed
</p>
<p>circuit attorney for the Pike Circuit, and in that capacity ex-
</p>
<p>hibited talents of a high order. The position itself was one
</p>
<p>of labor and responsibility, and no ordinary man could fill
</p>
<p>it, for he was neccessarily thrown in contact with some of
</p>
<p>the ablest men of the Missouri bar. The fact that Mr.
</p>
<p>Chambers discharged the duties of the office with signal
</p>
<p>ability is the best evidence of his legal attainments. He was
</p>
<p>a fluent and logical speaker, never indulging in flowery dec-
</p>
<p>lamation, and his good practical common sense paved the
</p>
<p>way to professional success.
</p>
<p>Mr. Chambers in early life manifested a fondness for poli-
</p>
<p>tics, and the people of Pike County sent him to the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, where he soon acquired reputation as a forensic debater.
</p>
<p>For a short time he published a weekly paper in Bowling
</p>
<p>Green. In July, 1837, he purchased an interest in the Mis-
</p>
<p>souri Republican, and at once became its editor and co-pro-
</p>
<p>prietor. The marked ability with which that paper was
</p>
<p>edited during Mr. Chambers' life is too well known to need

</p>
<p>Under the editorial management of Mr. Hyde, and the
</p>
<p>proprietorship of the Messrs. Knapp, the paper still maintains
</p>
<p>its supremacy as a Western journal.
</p>
<p>Mr. Chambers died in St. Louis, May 22, 1854, in the
</p>
<p>forty-seventh year of his age. He left a widow and three
</p>
<p>children  son and two daughters  and also two step-sons.
</p>
<p>His remains were placed in Bellefontaine Cemetery, a cem-
</p>
<p>etery in which he had taken a deep interest, and to the
</p>
<p>adornment of which he had largely contributed.
</p>
<p>His fine business qualifications were frequently called into
</p>
<p>requisition, and he became at different times connected with
</p>
<p>several important corporations, in some of which he acted as
</p>
<p>president. He was for some time president of the Pacific
</p>
<p>Insurance Company. This company, as well as the imder-
</p>
<p>writers of St. Louis, called a meeting immediately after
</p>
<p>his death, and paid a handsome tribute to his memory.
</p>
<p>Although he had never practiced in St. Louis, the bar of
</p>
<p>St. Louis were unwilling to let the occasion pass without
</p>
<p>some recognition of his early professional life, and hence
</p>
<p>they met at the court-house, and organized by calling the
</p>
<p>Hon. John F. Darby to the chair, and appointing as a com-
</p>
<p>mittee on resolutions Hon. Samuel Treat, Hon. Albert
</p>
<p>Todd, Hon. John C. Richardson, R. S. Blannerhassett, Esq.,
</p>
<p>and Henry S. Hart, Esq. These gentlemen reported a series
</p>
<p>of resolutions which v/ere unanimously adopted. The fol-
</p>
<p>lowing is one of them :
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That the bar of St. Louis has received with deep concern the
</p>
<p>sad intelligence of the death of our respected and distinguished fellow-citizen,
</p>
<p>A. B. Chambers, Esq.
</p>
<p>" Although not personally known to all of them as a practicing lawyer, they
</p>
<p>are well aware, through the reported decisions of the Supreme Court, and the
</p>
<p>fond recollections of his contemporaries in the profession, of his prominent po-
</p>
<p>sition at the Missouri bar in former days. They have always taken pride in the
</p>
<p>fact that their fraternity has furnished to the editorial corps of Missouri and

<p>the West one of the most energetic, most successful, and most influential of its
</p>
<p>members. That, in leaving the more immediate duties of the profession in
</p>
<p>our courts, he bore witii hi n into the responsible and more widely influential
</p>
<p>paths of journalism the fruits of his early experience and education in the laws
</p>
<p>of his country, and their influence upon the interests of individuals and.

</p>
<p>J. B. CHAMBERS. 333
</p>
<p>Mr. Chambers was a man of large enterprise, and took a
</p>
<p>deep interest in everything that concerned the growth and
</p>
<p>prosperity of St. Louis. His pen was often employed in
</p>
<p>disclosing the advantages of the city of his adoption, as a
</p>
<p>commercial and manufacturing center, and he did as much
</p>
<p>as any other writer to direct immigration to the West. His
</p>
<p>confidence in the future of St. Louis led him to take a lead
</p>
<p>in all public enterprises looking to her advancement. It is
</p>
<p>not strange, therefore, that the City Council should take
</p>
<p>some action in reference to his death. They met in joint
</p>
<p>session, on May 26, 1854, and adopted a series of resolutions,
</p>
<p>two of which we here give :
</p>
<p>^^ Resolved by the Board of Aldermen, the Board of Delegates concurring :
</p>
<p>"I. That the loss by death of a distinguished man is at all times a calamity,
</p>
<p>but the loss of such a man, at such a time, and in the very meridian of his use-
</p>
<p>fulness, is singularly unfortunate, irreparable in its nature, and the severest blow
</p>
<p>that our community could have received.
</p>
<p>"2. That in the death of Colonel A. B. Chambers we feel that St. Louis has
</p>
<p>lost one of her most useful citizens ; a man who shrank from no responsibility
</p>
<p>where the interests of the city were concerned, and to whom perhaps more than
</p>
<p>any other man she is indebted for the proud position she now occupies."
</p>
<p>In a letter recently received from a distinguished judge in
</p>
<p>north-eastern Missouri, he mentions the fact that in 1835,
</p>
<p>while engaged in the study of the law, he was present at the
</p>
<p>opening of one of the courts over which Presley McBride
</p>
<p>presided. After the grand jury was impaneled, the judge
</p>
<p>requested Mr. Chambers, who was prosecuting attorney, to
</p>
<p>charge the jury, and, without any previous intimation that
</p>
<p>such a request would be made, Mr. Chambers arose and
</p>
<p>made a clear, lucid, and forcible charge, which elicited much
</p>
<p>praise from the meiribers of the bar. The learned judge
</p>
<p>states that it is the only instance in his recollection, in a
</p>
<p>practice of forty years, in which a prosecuting attorney has
</p>
<p>charged the grand jury. We have no recollection of an in-

</p>
<p>stance of the kind, though it occurs to us that under certain
</p>
<p>circumstances it might be very proper and appropriate.
</p>
<p>In 1843 we had a very exciting election in Missouri. A
</p>
<p>meeting of the candidates, for jiublic discussion, took place at
</p>
<p>334 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Creve Coeur Lake, which came very near breaking up in a
</p>
<p>row. About the middle of July an article, over the signature
</p>
<p>of " Veritas," appeared in the Missouri Democrat, professing
</p>
<p>to give an account of the disturbance. To this, one Vespa-
</p>
<p>sian Ellis replied in the columns of the Republican, over his
</p>
<p>own name, denying the truth of the statement of " Veritas."
</p>
<p>In calling the attention of the readers to the letter of Mr.
</p>
<p>Ellis, Mr. Chambers, as editor of the Republican, in a short
</p>
<p>paragraph, charged Mr. Hudson with being the author of
</p>
<p>" Veritas," and trumpeting his own fame ; and expressed a
</p>
<p>doubt as to his courage. Mr. Hudson immediately chal-
</p>
<p>lenged him, and the challenge was promptly accepted. The
</p>
<p>parties met on Bloody Island, opposite St. Louis, on July
</p>
<p>17th, and exchanged three shots with rifles, at forty paces,
</p>
<p>without injury to either. The seconds then interposed, and
</p>
<p>brought about an honorable and amicable settlement. A
</p>
<p>more extended account of this bloodless duel will be found
</p>
<p>in our sketch of Captain Thomas B. Hudson. Both parties

<p>displayed much coolness under fire.
</p>
<p>William G. Minor,
</p>
<p>A brother of General James L. Minor, was a practicing lawyer
</p>
<p>and prominent politician in Jefferson City. He was born in
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg, Virginia, on February i, 1806, and graduated
</p>
<p>at the University of that state in 1824 or 1825. After his
</p>
<p>admission to the bar he commenced the practice in Glou-
</p>
<p>cester, and remained there three years, when, through a
</p>
<p>family bereavement, the duty of settling up a large estate in
</p>
<p>his ancestral home of Braynefield, Caroline County, devolved
</p>
<p>upon him, and he was compelled to remove there. He prac-
</p>
<p>ticed in Caroline and the adjacent counties until 1840, when
</p>
<p>he removed to Jefferson City, Missouri, where he practiced
</p>
<p>till his death, in February, 1851.
</p>
<p>In Missouri he held the various offices of representative in
</p>
<p>the Legislature from Cole County, adjutant-general of the
</p>
<p>state, commissioner to survey our northern boundary-line, and
</p>
<p>secretary of the State Senate; and it was during the occu-
</p>
<p>pancy of the last office that he died, at the age of forty-five
</p>
<p>years.
</p>
<p>We never saw General Minor engaged in the trial of a
</p>
<p>cause, but we have witnessed his zxal and ability in legisla-
</p>
<p>tion. He was the most active man in our Legislature in
</p>
<p>procuring a modification of our Code of Practice, and was
</p>
<p>the author of the bill which introduced what was then called
</p>
<p>the " Wells Code." It put the ax to the root of all pleading.
</p>
<p>Such an innovation upon our long-established system of
</p>
<p>pleading could not otherwise than invoke a violent opposi-
</p>
<p>tion from that portion of the Legislature who belonged to the
</p>
<p>legal profession. It was resisted at every point and every
</p>
<p>stage, and all parliamentary devices were resorted to for its
</p>
<p>defeat, but the persistent efforts of General Minor and a (ew
</p>
<p>others secured its passage. It made him popular with the

<p>friends of the measure throughout the state, but he lived to
</p>
<p>336 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>see its impracticable working, and in time it was repealed by
</p>
<p>the introduction of the New York Code.
</p>
<p>General Minor was a generous, good-hearted, affable gen-
</p>
<p>tleman, and had he lived to a later period would have
</p>
<p>made his mark in the political history of the state. He was
</p>
<p>easy in his manner, very accessible, and made friends among
</p>
<p>all classes of the community. He had a fine memory, and
</p>
<p>was well versed in the political history of his country ; and
</p>
<p>on the hustings an effective talker. He was a man rather
</p>
<p>under the average height, and in his dress careless and slov-
</p>
<p>enly. He would sit for hours on a pile of dirt, expounding
</p>
<p>to a few old farmers the Virginia Resolutions of '98. With
</p>
<p>an old slouch hat, a boot on one foot and an old untied bro-
</p>
<p>gan-shoe on the other, a stick in his hand to whittle and an
</p>
<p>old jackknife to whittle it with, and a few friends to listen to
</p>
<p>him, he was as happy as a lord. He looked at the bright side
</p>
<p>of everything, never anticipated evil, and was as well calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to meet the trials, tribulations, and disappointments of
</p>
<p>this life as any one we ever met.
</p>
<p>He left a widow and several interesting children. He was

<p>highly esteemed by all who knew him.
</p>
<p>Abner Green
</p>
<p>Was a prominent lawyer at Hillsboro', Jefferson County, for
</p>
<p>thirty-two years, daring most of which time we enjoyed the
</p>
<p>pleasure of his acquaintance. He was a brother of James
</p>
<p>S. Green, late United States senator, and though not as
</p>
<p>gifted a man as his brother, was nevertheless highly esteemed
</p>
<p>for his fine legal attainments, unflinching integrity, and great
</p>
<p>moral worth.
</p>
<p>Mr. Green was born in Fauquier County, Virginia, on
</p>
<p>'October 9, 1809, and his early life was spent on his father's
</p>
<p>farm in that state, performing such labor as is usual with the
</p>
<p>sons of farmers in moderate circumstances. His education
</p>
<p>was only such as could be obtained in that day in the com-
</p>
<p>mon schools. At the age of eighteen he left home, deter-
</p>
<p>mined to try his fortune in the far West. He sojourned
</p>
<p>several years in Kentucky, where he taught school, and
</p>
<p>became greatly attached to that state, for in after-life he fre-
</p>
<p>quently boasted of the happy days he spent there. From
</p>
<p>Kentucky he came to Missouri, and commenced the study
</p>
<p>of the law in the office of his brother, James S. Green, in
</p>
<p>the city of Palmyra ; and, after two years of diligent appli-
</p>
<p>cation, obtained a license to practice, and located in Monti-
</p>
<p>cello, Lewis County. He remained there, however, but a
</p>
<p>short time, and then removed to Hillsboro', in Jefferson
</p>
<p>County, which became his residence until his death, which
</p>
<p>occurred on July 2, 1876, at the age of sixty-seven.
</p>
<p>Mr. Green was a pleasant and logical speaker, but by no
</p>
<p>means eloquent. He sought rather to convince the under-
</p>
<p>standing than to please the fancy. Like his brother, he was
</p>
<p>good at repartee, and not unfrequently turned an interrup-
</p>
<p>tion to advantage. He was tall, upwards of six feet high ;
</p>
<p>and once, while trying a cause in opposition to a lawyer who

</p>
<p>was very low in stature, sharp, words passed between them,
</p>
<p>when his adversary remarked " that it was useless to bandy
</p>
<p>words any further, for the public would see which was right."
</p>
<p>Mr. Green replied, in a very sarcastic tone, "Yes, when the
</p>
<p>public get done looking up to me, they can look dow?i on
</p>
<p>you."
</p>
<p>Upon another occasion he was engaged in an argument to
</p>
<p>the jury, when the opposing counsel had on a pair of new
</p>
<p>and heavy boots, which made a creaking noise and greatly
</p>
<p>disturbed him. Mr. Green turned to him, and said, " I wish
</p>
<p>you would take off your boots, or take your boots off, I don't
</p>
<p>care which."
</p>
<p>The distinction between the two propositions is not so obvi-
</p>
<p>ous as that related of the New York lawyer by Edwards, in
</p>
<p>his " Pleasantries," who, at the close of a very long argument
</p>
<p>on a motion, remarked " that he was apprehensive he had
</p>
<p>been tediously clear." The judge replied " that he did
</p>
<p>not know how that was, but he certainly had been clearly
</p>
<p>tedious."
</p>
<p>Upon the death of Mr. Green, which was quite sudden, the
</p>
<p>bar of Jefferson County met at Hillsboro' to take action
</p>
<p>in reference to their departed brother, when Philip Pipkin,
</p>
<p>Esq., was called to the chair, and ex-Governor Thomas C.
</p>
<p>Fletcher appointed secretary. Judge L. F. Dinning and
</p>
<p>Governor Fletcher paid beautiful tributes to his memory, in
</p>
<p>short speeches, when the following resolutions were unani-
</p>
<p>mously adopted :
</p>
<p>"Whereas the place at this bar so long and so well filled by Abner Green,
</p>
<p>Esq., has been made vacant by the hand of death, therefore be it
</p>
<p>"Resolved by the survivors of our late brother that we cherish with sincere
</p>
<p>respect the memory of the deceased, and desire to express our sorrow in jiarliiig
</p>
<p>from him for all time; that his long and distinguished standing at this bar had
</p>
<p>not only won him a position in the front rank of our profession, but had also
</p>
<p>won for him the confidence and esteem of his brethren in the profession, and

<p>both in his ability as a lawyer and his integrity as a man.
</p>
<p>''Resolved, That the Supreme Court of Missouri, the Circuit Court of Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son County, the County and the Probate Courts of said county, be requested
</p>
<p>to dedicate a memorial page of the record of said court to the memory of our
</p>
<p>departed brother, and to enter thereon the following :

<p>ABNEK GREEN. 339
</p>
<p>DEDICATED
</p>
<p>TO THE MEMORY OF
</p>
<p>ABNER GREEN, Esquire.
</p>
<p>Who was born in Fauquier County, Virginia,
</p>
<p>On the gth day of October, 1809,
</p>
<p>Was an active member of the bar at Hillsboro', Missouri,
</p>
<p>From 1844 to 1876,
</p>
<p>And died on the 2d day of July, 1876.
</p>
<p>This ])age of the record of this court is dedicated to his memory at the request
</p>
<p>of the members of tlie bar at Hillsboro', Jefferson County, Missouri, as a testi-
</p>
<p>monial of their respect and esteem, and in honor of his memory, and is done
</p>
<p>also as a testimonial of the respect for his memory which is cherished by this
</p>
<p>court and all its officers."
</p>
<p>Hon. John L. Thomas, who practiced at the same bar
</p>
<p>with Mr. Green many years, and who was his intimate friend,
</p>
<p>thus referred to him on presenting the resokitions to one of
</p>
<p>the courts.
</p>
<p>" It was my fortune to be an intimate friend and associate of his from 1858
</p>
<p>tu the time of his death, though my acquaintance with him was formed as early
</p>
<p>as 1853. From 1858 to 1876 Mr. Green and I were brought face to face in
</p>
<p>many a business transaction and in many of the daily occurrences of life. I
</p>
<p>presume I have had more hand-to-hand forensic contests with him than any
</p>
<p>other member of the bar who practices in the courts of this county, and I
</p>
<p>believe I knew him well, and I desire to put on record what I know of him.
</p>
<p>" Intellectually he was much above mediocrity. He was, in the true sense of
</p>
<p>the word, a self-made man, and the greater portion of his education was acquired
</p>
<p>by himself after he went into active business. James S. Green, his brother,
</p>
<p>acquired a national reputation, while the subject of this memorial was known to
</p>
<p>comparatively few ; yet I unhesitatingly say to you and to the public that in
</p>
<p>brain power, mental vigor, a sound judgment, and a logical, analytical mind,
</p>
<p>Abner Green was the peer of his brother. He could have ascended to and
</p>
<p>occupied the same elevated niche in Fortune's temple that James S. Green did,
</p>
<p>had he only been possessed of the same ambition and love of politics. He
</p>
<p>never made politics a study, and all he knew of our political system was what

<p>reliable.
</p>
<p>" As a lawyer Mr. Green met few equals. Here, again, as in his literary edu-
</p>
<p>cation, he had, unaided, acquired all the knowledge of the law he had through
</p>
<p>his own efforts. In every sense of the word he was a true lawyer. He was
</p>
<p>true to his country, true to himself, and true to his clients. One featur.e of his
</p>
<p>character, especially, shone out preeminent abo.ve the rest : he made his
</p>
<p>client's cause his own, and never was known to yield either a weak or strong
</p>
<p>point to his adversary; and if any advantage was ever gained over him, it was

<p>wresteil from liim. He frequently, in tlie warmth of the battle, like most attor-
</p>
<p>neys, would overstep the bounds of moderation ; but after the contest was over,
</p>
<p>whether lost or won, Mr. Green was never in a single instance known to carry
</p>
<p>the least anger or ill-will engendered in the forum into the private walks of
</p>
<p>life, and never would he, out of court, refer to these disagreeable scenes in
</p>
<p>court, unless the subject was first broached to him. In his intercourse with
</p>
<p>his professional brethren he was courteous and affable, and his sociability was
</p>
<p>proverbial.
</p>
<p>" As a faithful, law-abiding citizen he had no superior. Whether as a public
</p>
<p>officer or private citizen, he never was false to the public interests. In every
</p>
<p>position he occupied in society he did his duty faithfully and honestly. But,
</p>
<p>above all, it was in the home circle where Mr. Green's virtues shone the
</p>
<p>brightest and with constant luster. He lived and toiled and worked for his wife
</p>
<p>and children. His home was his kingdom, where he governed, not as a des-
</p>
<p>jiot, but as a kind husband and most loving and indulgent father. But he has
</p>
<p>been called home. He has gone to that country whence no traveler returns ;
</p>
<p>and society has lost a good citizen, the bar an honored member, his wife a kind
</p>
<p>and faithful husband, his children a loving and indulgent father, and all of us

<p>an honest man."
</p>
<p>Thomas W. Freeman.
</p>
<p>This lawyer was well known to the people of south-western
</p>
<p>Missouri. He was born in Anderson County, Kentucky, in
</p>
<p>1824, and received a common-school education. In 1843 ^^
</p>
<p>commenced the study of the law with G. W. Cavanah, of
</p>
<p>Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, and completed his studies in the
</p>
<p>office of Hon. John Draffin, of the same place, and was ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to the Kentucky bar in 1847; practiced two years,
</p>
<p>and then went to California and practiced his profession in
</p>
<p>Marysville, where he obtained some reputation as a criminal
</p>
<p>lawyer.
</p>
<p>In 185 I he left California, and came to Osceola, St. Clair
</p>
<p>County, Missouri, intending to make that his home; but soon
</p>
<p>after moved to Bolivar, in Polk County, where he prosecuted
</p>
<p>his profession with much diligence, and was elected to the
</p>
<p>office of circuit attorney, the duties of which he performed
</p>
<p>until the breaking-out of the war, in i860. At the election
</p>
<p>in that year he was sent to the State Legislature, and also
</p>
<p>became a Breckinridge elector. Governor C. F. Jackson sent
</p>
<p>him on a private commission to Texas and Louisiana, and he
</p>
<p>was soon after selected as one of the representatives to the
</p>
<p>Confederate Congress. He was a strong disunionist, and
</p>
<p>served for some time in General Price's army.
</p>
<p>He was a fine-looking man, nearly six feet high, with. dark
</p>
<p>complexion, and portly and commanding in person. In
</p>
<p>point of ability he was above the average of attorneys, and
</p>
<p>as a prosecutor was efficient and successful. He could
</p>
<p>not be called an orator, yet he was a forcible and impressive
</p>
<p>speaker.
</p>
<p>He held no public position long enough to secure much
</p>
<p>distinction, but he was gradually rising in public estimation,
</p>
<p>when his life was cut short by a malarial fever contracted in

</p>
<p>died there, at the Southern Hotel, October 15, 1865, at the
</p>
<p>age of forty.
</p>
<p>He was married in 1846 to a sister of Judge Drafifin, of
</p>
<p>Boonville, who, with her three children, was present at his
</p>
<p>death, and received his dying blessing.
</p>
<p>The Hon. Waldo P. Johnson thus speaks of him as a law-
</p>
<p>yer: " Mr. Freeman was very successful as a practitioner at
</p>
<p>the bar. He prepared his cases with great care, and during
</p>
<p>the trial he neglected nothing that might benefit his client,
</p>
<p>and rarely ever failed to get the advantage of every fact and
</p>
<p>circumstance favorable to his side of the case. He was very
</p>
<p>effective before a jury, making his points with clearness, and
</p>
<p>presenting his arguments with great force  when necessary,
</p>
<p>illustrating the same with amusing anecdotes, of which he
</p>
<p>possessed a great fund ready to draw upon when he desired
</p>
<p>to carry the minds of the jury away from the real issue, or
</p>
<p>bring into ridicule the opposing counsel or client. He was
</p>
<p>a social, genial gentleman ; a man of strong convictions and
</p>
<p>decided opinions upon all subjects that came under his ob-
</p>
<p>servation ; a warm friend and open enem}'. His position upon
</p>
<p>all questions of public interest was always well known to the

<p>community in which he lived."
</p>
<p>Mark L. Means
</p>
<p>Was a lawyer of some prominence in Warsaw, Benton
</p>
<p>County, Missouri, and died during the war, in 1863. Our
</p>
<p>information respecting his early life is very limited  in fact,
</p>
<p>we only know that he was born in Kentucky, about 18 17,
</p>
<p>and at his death must have been nearly forty-six years of
</p>
<p>age. He received an ordinary English education. He came
</p>
<p>to Missouri about 1840, and soon manifested a fondness for
</p>
<p>politics ; was an ardent Democrat, and often addressed the
</p>
<p>people from the rostrum.
</p>
<p>In 1843 a vacancy occurred in the office of circuit attorney
</p>
<p>for the Benton Circuit, and Mr. Means was appointed to fill
</p>
<p>it. The office imposed on the incumbent much labor and
</p>
<p>resp(5nsibility, for the circuit not only embraced many coun-
</p>
<p>ties and a large extent of territory, but the criminal docket
</p>
<p>was heavy in all the courts. He discharged the duties of
</p>
<p>the office very faithfully, and gave general satisfaction.
</p>
<p>In 1857 he was appointed register of the United States
</p>
<p>Land Office, and held the position until the commencement
</p>
<p>of the war.
</p>
<p>He took no active part in the war, but his sympathies were
</p>
<p>strongly enlisted in behalf of the South, which often led him
</p>
<p>to express his opinions freely and openly, thereby making
</p>
<p>enemies and subjecting himself to many annoyances. To
</p>
<p>avoid arrest he frequently left home and concealed himself,
</p>
<p>to the great injury of his health ; and it was generally sup-
</p>
<p>posed that the exposure of his person on such occasions
</p>
<p>contributed greatly to his early death.
</p>
<p>Mr. Means married before coming to Missouri, and left a
</p>
<p>widow and four or five children. He was a man of fine ad-
</p>
<p>dress, corpulent, and low in stature, and capable of much
</p>
<p>physical labor.

</p>
<p>he met with more than ordniary success ; for, hke most Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky lawyers, he cultivated a taste for speaking, and at
</p>
<p>times was strong and impressive before a jury. He had a
</p>
<p>good knowledge of men, and knew what chord to touch
</p>
<p>when necessary to excite their sympathies. He often drew
</p>
<p>tears from the entire jury, and rarely failed to enlist them in
</p>
<p>his client's cause. He spent but little time in the argu-
</p>
<p>ment of questions of law, but reserved his ammunition for
</p>
<p>the jury.
</p>
<p>He was a popular man, and by his genial and pleasant
</p>
<p>manners made friends rapidly. He was generous and liberal
</p>
<p>to a fault, placing no value upon money except as a means to
</p>
<p>supply existing wants. He was an ardent politician, and
</p>
<p>wielded a vigorous pen. He wrote most of the editorials for

</p>
<p>lished at Warsaw, and which at the commencement of the

</p>
<p>THOMAS REYNOLDS.
</p>
<p>Many of our readers will recollect the deep sensation pro-
</p>
<p>duced upon the public mind by the announcement of the
</p>
<p>tragic death of this gentleman, who took his own life while
</p>
<p>governor of the state. He was not only one of the profound-
</p>
<p>est jurists of the West, but possessed a versatility of talent
</p>
<p>that would enable him to adorn any position to which he
</p>
<p>might be called.
</p>
<p>Governor Reynolds was born March 12, 1796, in Bracken
</p>
<p>County, Kentucky. But very little is known respecting his
</p>
<p>early education, but it was, no doubt, as good as could be ob-
</p>
<p>tained in the schools where he resided. He certainly was not
</p>
<p>a classical scholar, though he had some knowledge of Latin.
</p>
<p>He was admitted to the bar in Kentucky, about the time he
</p>
<p>became of age, but in early life he removed to Illinois, where
</p>
<p>he filled the several offices of clerk of the House of Rep-
</p>
<p>resentatives, speaker of the House, attorney-general, and
</p>
<p>chief justice of the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>In 1829 he moved to Missouri, and located at Fayette,
</p>
<p>Howard County. He brought with him a high reputation as
</p>
<p>a jurist, and soon secured a good practice. It was not long
</p>
<p>before he was chosen to represent Howard County in the
</p>
<p>Legislature, and became speaker of the House. After leav-
</p>
<p>ing the Legislature he was appointed judge of the judicieil
</p>
<p>circuit comprising the counties of Howard, Boone, Callaway,
</p>
<p>et al.
</p>
<p>In 1840 the Democratic party met in convention at Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son City, to nominate a ticket for state officers, and Judge
</p>
<p>Reynolds was nominated for governor almost by acclama-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>It was at this time we made his acquaintance, and formed

</p>
<p>a very high estimate of him as not only a man of ability,
</p>
<p>346 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>but of undoubted integrity and honesty of purpose. As a
</p>
<p>delegate in the Convention we gave him our support, and
</p>
<p>had occasion frequently afterwards to meet and transact
</p>
<p>business with him, as we were in the Legislature during most
</p>
<p>of the time he was governor. He was elected over J. B.
</p>
<p>Clark by a handsome majority.
</p>
<p>No very important event transpired during his administra-
</p>
<p>tion. He was the first governor who strongly urged the
</p>
<p>abolition of imprisonment for debt, and probabl\^ to him
</p>
<p>more than any other person are we indebted for this humane
</p>
<p>enactment.
</p>
<p>Governor Reynolds had few superiors as a jurist, and
</p>
<p>hence it is that most of his life was spent on the bench.
</p>
<p>There was nothing superficial in his law learning. He drank
</p>
<p>from the lowest depths of the legal well, and there secured
</p>
<p>the erems which can be nowhere else found.
</p>
<p>t>^
</p>
<p>" Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow;
</p>
<p>He who would search for pearls must dive below."
</p>
<p>He studied the law as a science, and we have heard him
</p>
<p>say on several occasions that he had read Coke, Bacon, and
</p>
<p>Blackstone a dozen times. His mind was as clear as a bell,
</p>
<p>and his power of analysis very great. As a forensic speaker
</p>
<p>few excelled him, and in canvassing the state for governor
</p>
<p>but few were willing to encounter him.
</p>
<p>At the time of his death his prospects for distinction were
</p>
<p>greater than those of any man in the state, for his genial
</p>
<p>habits, pleasant demeanor, and unquestioned integrity had
</p>
<p>made him exceedingly popular, and it was a mere question
</p>
<p>of time as to his elevation to the Federal Senate. He had
</p>
<p>a dread of being thought disloyal to his party, which often
</p>
<p>induced him to appoint men to office unfit for the position.
</p>
<p>A noted instance of this will be found in our memoir of
</p>
<p>James Evans.

<p>Shortly after breakfast, on February 9, 1844, the report of
</p>
<p>a gun was heard from the executive mansion in Jefferson
</p>
<p>City, and some persons passing by at the time went into the
</p>
<p>' THOMAS REYNOLDS. 347
</p>
<p>governor's office to ascertain the cause of it, and there found
</p>
<p>the governor weltering in his blood, with the top of his
</p>
<p>head bUown entirely off, and of course dead. He had just
</p>
<p>before sent for a rifle, the muzzle of which he placed against
</p>
<p>his forehead, and by the aid of a strong twine tied to the
</p>
<p>trigger, with one end wrapped around his thumb, he dis-
</p>
<p>charged it. On the table near where he fell was found a
</p>
<p>letter addressed to his most intimate friend, Colonel William
</p>
<p>G. Minor, in the following words:
</p>
<p>" In every situation in which I have been placed, I have labored to discharge
</p>
<p>my duty faithfully to the public ; but this has not protected me for the last
</p>
<p>twelve months from the slanders and abuse of my enemies, which has rendered
</p>
<p>my life a burden to me. I pray God to forgive them, and teach them more
</p>
<p>charity. My will is in the hands of James L. Minor, Esq. Farewell.
</p>
<p>" Th. Reynolds.
</p>
<p>" Col. W. G. Minor:'
</p>
<p>Here we might stop, and throw a mantle over this myste-
</p>
<p>rious and tragic event, but truth and candor force us to state
</p>
<p>that many of Governor Reynolds' friends attributed the sui-
</p>
<p>cide to a very different cause from that designated in his
</p>
<p>letter to Colonel Minor. To be more explicit, they believed
</p>
<p>it grew out of his domestic troubles. It is certainly a very
</p>
<p>great draft upon our credulity to suppose that a man who
</p>
<p>had been a quarter of a century in public life, and who was
</p>
<p>an old and experienced politician, would take his own life
</p>
<p>because of the ill-natured squibs of the opposition press,
</p>
<p>which every public min has to encounter. No greater
</p>
<p>truism was ever uttered by man, than was uttered by Dean
</p>
<p>Swift when he said, " Censure is the tax a man pays for
</p>
<p>being eminent."
</p>
<p>That he may have been more than ordinarily sensitive in
</p>
<p>this respect is not improbable, but the comments of the
</p>
<p>press respecting his administration were no more uncharita-
</p>
<p>ble than those which had been aimed at the governor who

<p>If the letter to Colonel Minor was worded with the view
</p>
<p>of drawing the attention of the public from the true cause
</p>
<p>of the suicide, he had a motive which others can conject-
</p>

<p>MYRON LESLIE.
</p>
<p>Vermont has the honor of being the native state of this
</p>
<p>gifted lawyer. He was born near Bennington, and received
</p>
<p>a very moderate education. He had httle or no knowledge
</p>
<p>of the classics, and was far from being even a good English
</p>
<p>scholar; but nature bestowed upon him an intellect which
</p>
<p>more than made up for his deficiency in learning. He
</p>
<p>boasted that when a boy he ran a saw-mill in Vermont. It
</p>
<p>is certainly well authenticated that for some time he was
</p>
<p>engaged in rafting on the Susquehanna River. He studied
</p>
<p>law in Vermont, but with whom we are not advised.
</p>
<p>In 1834 he left Vermont, to seek a location in the West.
</p>
<p>After wandering about several months he pitched his tent in
</p>
<p>Meredosia, Illinois, where he practiced his profession for a
</p>
<p>short time. He then located in Jacksonville, Illinois, and
</p>
<p>soon enjoyed a good practice, and acquired a fine reputation
</p>
<p>as an advocate.
</p>
<p>In 1838 or 1839 he came to St. Louis, and entered upon
</p>
<p>the practice with F. W. Risque, Esq., and business began to
</p>
<p>flow upon him rapidly, for the public soon discovered that he
</p>
<p>was not only a sound lawyer, but one of the ablest forensic
</p>
<p>speakers at the bar. The firm, at the expiration of a year,
</p>
<p>or between one and two years, was dissolved by the change
</p>
<p>of residence of Mr. Risque to Washington City. Mr. Leslie
</p>
<p>then formed a partnership with R. M. Field, Esq., and the
</p>
<p>firm was regarded as one of the strongest at the St. Louis bar.
</p>
<p>In 1842 or 1843 he was appointed circuit attorney for the
</p>
<p>St. Louis District, and the firm of Leslie & Field was dis-
</p>
<p>solved. He held the office about two years, when he was
</p>
<p>elected to the State Senate for the term of four years.
</p>
<p>In 1845 he was elected a delegate to the Constitutional
</p>
<p>Convention, he and Trusten Polk being the only Democrats

<p>elected; the other four were Native Americans.

</p>
<p>He was for a short time bank attorney of the old State
</p>
<p>Bank, succeeding Judge James B. Bowlin.
</p>
<p>While in the Senate he made several speeches which gave
</p>
<p>him a wide-spread reputation. It is more than probable that
</p>
<p>in early life he ap[)lied himself closely to his books, for his
</p>
<p>knowledge of the law could not otherwise have been ac-
</p>
<p>quired. His style of speaking was in many respects like
</p>
<p>that of Mr. Bates, but abounded more in wit, sarcasm, and
</p>
<p>irony. He was naturally indolent, and required thp stimu-
</p>
<p>lant of strong opposition to arouse him; but when once
</p>
<p>thoroughly aroused, his mind flashed w ith dazzling bright-
</p>
<p>ness, and he carried everything before him. At other times
</p>
<p>he was slow and inert, and seemed incapable of high mental
</p>
<p>exertion, which, doubtless, was owing to a considerable
</p>
<p>extent to his intemperate habits; iox truth compels us to
</p>
<p>state that during the latter part of his life the habit of strong
</p>
<p>drink, which is often the birth of a noble and generous dis-
</p>
<p>position, seized him witli an iron grasp, and finally brought
</p>
<p>him to his grave. He died in St. Louis, in March, 1854,
</p>
<p>leaving a wife and one or two children to mourn his fate.
</p>
<p>Leslie is dead, but his genius lives in the memory of his
</p>
<p>associates, who never speak of him but with tears in their
</p>
<p>eyes, and hearts bowed down in grief
</p>
<p>Few lawyers excelled him in the cross-examination of a
</p>
<p>witness. He assumed an air of indifference, and without
</p>
<p>giving the witness any reason to suppose that he entertained
</p>
<p>a doubt respecting the truth of his statement, he was ingen-
</p>
<p>iously weaving a net-work in which to entangle him.
</p>
<p>One of his peculiarities was a disposition to contend with
</p>
<p>the court, which rendered liim unpopular with the judges;
</p>
<p>for, while they admired his talents, they were in constant
</p>
<p>fear of being made the subject of his wit. Particularly was
</p>
<p>this the case when he was excited bv drink.
</p>
<p>It has often been remarked that liquor sometimes sharpens

<p>the wit. The following is an illustration of it, as given by Ed-
</p>
<p>wards : A lawyer, while intoxicated, rose to address a court
</p>
<p>in New York. The judge, discovering his condition, told him
</p>
<p>to sit down. " Mr. W., sit down ; you are drunk." To
</p>
<p>MYRON LESLIE. 35 I
</p>
<p>which remark W. slowly replied, "That's a fact; and it is
</p>
<p>the first correct decision your honor has made this term."
</p>
<p>Jeafferson tells a good anecdote of Lord Fortescue and a
</p>
<p>counsel trying a case before him. His lordship was disfig-
</p>
<p>ured by a nose which was purple, and hideously misshapen
</p>
<p>by morbid growth. Having checked the counsel, who was
</p>
<p>slightly inebriated, with the needlessly harsh observation,
</p>
<p>" Brother, brother, you are handling the case in a very lame
</p>
<p>manner," the angry advocate gave vent to his annoyance by
</p>
<p>saying, with a perfect appearance of sang-froid, " Pardon
</p>
<p>me, my lord ; have patience with me, and I will do my best
</p>
<p>to make the case as plain as  as  ff/e //ose on your lord-
</p>
<p>ship's face.''
</p>
<p>Prentiss, when in his cups, uttered some of the finest
</p>
<p>pieces of witticism on record. See our life of John Bent,
</p>
<p>for an exhibition of wit while under examination as a wit-
</p>
<p>ness in the Jefferson Circuit Court.
</p>
<p>Like Erskine, Mr. Leslie had no patience with a client
</p>
<p>who was constantly interrupting him with suggestions in the
</p>
<p>course of a trial, and would often silence him with some
</p>
<p>happy retort. We have somewhere seen it stated that on
</p>
<p>one occasion, at the Irish bar, Erskine was defending a man
</p>
<p>charged with treason. His client became dissatisfied with
</p>
<p>the course he was pursuing, and handed him a slip of paper
</p>
<p>on which he had written, " I will be hanged if I don't attend
</p>
<p>to my own case." Erksine returned him the paper, with the

</p>
<p>Christian Kribben.
</p>
<p>Few lawyers were better known in his day than this gen-
</p>
<p>tleman, for he not only practiced in all the courts of St.
</p>
<p>Louis, but was an active Democratic politician. He was a
</p>
<p>Prussian by birth, and born at Glenel, near Cologne, March
</p>
<p>5, 1821. He was exceedingly precocious, and at the age of
</p>
<p>five years commenced the study of Latin with the village
</p>
<p>curate, and at the age of seven became a pupil in a private
</p>
<p>school at Cologne, where he remained seven years.
</p>
<p>In 1835 his father left Germany and came to the United
</p>
<p>States, and settled upon a farm in St. Louis County, Mis-
</p>
<p>souri. Christian was apprenticed to a store-keeper in Man-
</p>
<p>chester, about twenty miles west of St. Louis, but, wearying
</p>
<p>of this, he ran away from his employer and returned to his
</p>
<p>parents.
</p>
<p>In 1838 the family removed to St. Charles, where Chris-
</p>
<p>tian's father opened a grocery store, and the son was in-
</p>
<p>stalled as clerk and chief salesman. At the age of seventeen
</p>
<p>he commenced the study of the law with Major Cunning-
</p>
<p>ham, Esq., of St. Charles, and in due time was admitted to
</p>
<p>the bar. For some reason he obtained but little business,
</p>
<p>and finally opened an office in St. Louis, where he soon ac-
</p>
<p>quired a good German practice. He was a very fluent and
</p>
<p>ingenious speaker, and spoke the English as well as the Ger-
</p>
<p>man. He became an ardent politician, and during every
</p>
<p>canvass was frequently called upon to address the people.
</p>
<p>We have on many occasions heard him make two speeches
</p>
<p>the same night, and to the same audience, one in English and
</p>
<p>the other in German.
</p>
<p>When the Mexican War broke out he enlisted in the
</p>
<p>army under General Doniphan, and rose to the rank of
</p>
<p>colonel. While in Mexico he studied the Spanish language,

</p>
<p>and while quartered at Chihauhua edited a newspaper
</p>
<p>CHRISTIAN KRIBBEN. 353
</p>
<p>printed half in English and half in Spanish. After the close
</p>
<p>of the war he visited Europe and remained there two years.
</p>
<p>He corresponded with the press in St. Louis, and his letters,
</p>
<p>giving an account of his travels and the state of affairs on the
</p>
<p>Continent, were highly interesting.
</p>
<p>In 1854 he married Miss Delafield, of St. Louis, a daugh-
</p>
<p>ter of John Delafield, Esq. In 1858 he was elected to the
</p>
<p>General Assembly of Missouri, and was chosen speaker of
</p>
<p>the House. During the administration of Governor Stewart
</p>
<p>he was appointed colonel of the militia. In 1864 he lost his
</p>
<p>wife, and the following year, on June 15th, he died, leaving
</p>
<p>two children, a son and a daughter, aged respectively seven
</p>
<p>and nine years.
</p>
<p>Colonel Kribben was naturally a linguist, and was able to
</p>
<p>acquire a knowledge of almost any language with little labor.
</p>
<p>He was a man of strong native intellect, and when able to
</p>
<p>rivet his attention to the trial of a cause was very successful,
</p>
<p>but he was careless and indolent in his habits, and frequently
</p>
<p>neglected his business, to the serious injury of his clients.
</p>
<p>He was'social and genial, fond of company, delighted in light
</p>
<p>literature, and had a particular aversion to the drudgery of
</p>
<p>the practice. As an evidence of his negligence and inatten-
</p>
<p>tion to business, we give an instance which occurred once at
</p>
<p>the Gasconade court held at the town of Hermann. He had
</p>
<p>a case in which he was a party himself, and while sitting at
</p>
<p>the counsel-table in the court-room, he said to us, " If my
</p>
<p>case is called, say I am ready, and attend to it for me until I
</p>
<p>return;" saying which, he took his hat and walked out. The
</p>
<p>case was soon called, a jury impaneled, and half of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses examined before his return. He had said nothing- to
</p>
<p>us respecting the nature of his case, and seemed as indifferent
</p>
<p>about it as though he had nothing at stake.
</p>
<p>If he made an appointment to meet you on business, he
</p>
<p>was more apt to forget than keep it.

<p>He exercised a large influence with the German population.
</p>
<p>John r. Chenault.
</p>
<p>We first met this gentleman at the session of the Missouri
</p>
<p>Legislature in 1844. He was a member of the lower House,
</p>
<p>and represented the county of Jasper. It was the commence-
</p>
<p>ment of his public life, and he was soon regarded as one of
</p>
<p>the leaders of the delegation from south-western Missouri.
</p>
<p>Modest and unassuming, with genial manners and gentle-
</p>
<p>manly deportment, he gradually won the confidence of the
</p>
<p>House, and was honored b}' being placed upon some of the
</p>
<p>most important committees. Without being, at all brilliant,
</p>
<p>he was a forcible and fluent speaker, and all his speeches
</p>
<p>contained a vein of good sense which never failed to com-
</p>
<p>mand the attention and respect of his hearers. The subject
</p>
<p>in which he manifested the most interest was the improve-
</p>
<p>ment of the Osage River, for that stream furnished t4ie only
</p>
<p>outlet for the produce of soMthern Missouri, railroads being
</p>
<p>unknown in that day.
</p>
<p>Judge Chenault was born near Bardstown, Kentucky, No-
</p>
<p>vember 7, 1808. His grandparents were from Virginia, and
</p>
<p>his father, Stephen Chenault, studied law with Felix Grundy.
</p>
<p>He and Mr. Grundy married sisters. Judge Chenault's educa-
</p>
<p>tion was confined to the common schools of Kentucky, but
</p>
<p>he had the benefit of private instruction from his father, who
</p>
<p>was well versed in the classics. It was at his father's instance
</p>
<p>that he commenced the study of the law with Charles A.
</p>
<p>Wickliff, and finished in the office of Mr. Grundy.
</p>
<p>About 1830 or 1 83 1 he married Martha I. Staples, of
</p>
<p>Meade County, Kentucky. After his marriage he resided
</p>
<p>with his father about two years, then moved to Gallatin,
</p>
<p>Sumner County, Tennessee, and after a residence there of
</p>
<p>two years came to Missouri, and settled in Jasper County.
</p>
<p>He soon acquired a fair practice, and attended all the courts

<p>of his circuit.
</p>
<p>JOHN R. CHENAULT. 355
</p>
<p>During the administration of President Tyler he was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed Indian agent, the duties of which he faithfully dis-
</p>
<p>charged.
</p>
<p>He was afterwards appointed judge of the Thirteenth Ju-
</p>
<p>dicial Circuit, composed of the counties of Dade, Lawrence,
</p>
<p>Jasper, Newton, Barry, Greene, Taney, Stone, and McDonald.
</p>
<p>It was an immense circuit, and embraced a territory more
</p>
<p>extensive than some of the New England States. Court and
</p>
<p>lawyers traveled on horseback, and carried their law library
</p>
<p>in their saddle-bags. Judge Chenault presided over this cir-
</p>
<p>cuit many years, and made an honest, impartial, and upright
</p>
<p>judge.
</p>
<p>In 1 86 1 he was elected a delegate to the State Constitu-
</p>
<p>tional Convention, and represented in part the Seventeenth
</p>
<p>Senatorial District, composed of the counties of Jasper, Dade,
</p>
<p>and Cedar. He took very little part in the debates, but
</p>
<p>generally voted with the secessionists.
</p>
<p>Before the final adjournment of the Convention, he moved
</p>
<p>to Dallas, in Texas, in hopes of improving his financial con-
</p>
<p>dition, for he had become much embarrassed, and had a
</p>
<p>large family wholly dependent upon him. The change of
</p>
<p>residence seemed to prosper him, for he soon obtained a fair
</p>
<p>practice ; but his constitution began to give way under the
</p>
<p>labor, cares, and mental anxiety which he had to encounter,
</p>
<p>and on March 12, 1873, he left this world. A wife, three

<p>daughters, and three sons survived him.
</p>
<p>ABIEL LEONARD.
</p>
<p>This eminent lawyer and jurist, who for forty years led the
</p>
<p>bar of central Missouri, and became distinguished through-
</p>
<p>out the West for his profound knowledge of the law, came
</p>
<p>from good old Revolutionary stock. His grandfather, from
</p>
<p>whom he took his name, Rev. Abiel Leonard, was a grad-
</p>
<p>uate of Harvard, and at the commencement of the Revolu-
</p>
<p>tion had charge of a church at Woodstock, Connecticut.
</p>
<p>Being anxious to enter the army as chaplain, and assist in
</p>
<p>securing the liberties of his country, he asked for leave of
</p>
<p>absence ; but his congregation, who were greatly devoted
</p>
<p>to him, declined until solicited by General Washington and
</p>
<p>General Putnam in a joint letter. This interesting letter,
</p>
<p>which has never before been published, will be found in the
</p>
<p>Appendix.
</p>
<p>Nathaniel Leonard, the father of Judge Leonard, was born
</p>
<p>in Woodstock, in 1768. He became a captain in the United
</p>
<p>States army, served in the War of 1812, and was commander
</p>
<p>of Fort Niagara at the time of its capture by the British,
</p>
<p>in 181 3. The subject of our sketch was his second son,
</p>
<p>and was born at Windsor, Vermont, May 16, 1797. He
</p>
<p>was sent to Dartmouth College in 18 13, when sixteen years
</p>
<p>of age, intending to prepare himself for the ministry. But
</p>
<p>he became satisfied that his mind was better adapted to the
</p>
<p>law, and abandoned his first intention. After remaining at
</p>
<p>Dartmouth about three years, his sight became greatly
</p>
<p>impaired by too close application to his books, and he was
</p>
<p>forced to abandon his studies, and retire to his father's farm
</p>
<p>to recruit his health.
</p>
<p>In 1 8 16 he commenced the study of the law in the office
</p>
<p>of Gould & Sill, prominent lawyers at Whiteboro', New
</p>
<p>York, and continued there until admitted to the bar, in 1818.

</p>
<p>He then determined to come West, and fixed upon Missouri
</p>
<p>ABIEL LEONARD. 357
</p>
<p>as his future home. In 1 8 19, at the age of twenty-two, he
</p>
<p>came to St. Louis, descending the Ohio River in a skiff, from
</p>
<p>Pittsburg- to its mouth. He remained in St. Louis but a few
</p>
<p>days, and then started on foot for FrankUn, in Howard
</p>
<p>County, crossing the Missouri at St. Charles. Here he was
</p>
<p>forced to remain several weeks by an attack of fever,
</p>
<p>brought on, no doubt, by his long exposure on the Ohio
</p>
<p>River.
</p>
<p>It was here that he first met Peyton R. Hayden, who
</p>
<p>afterwards became an eminent lawyer in Boonville, but then
</p>
<p>residing in old Franklin. They became intimate friends
</p>
<p>through life, and were pitted against each other at the bar
</p>
<p>for more than a third of a century. Mr. Hayden had been
</p>
<p>in the state but a few months, and was returning from St.
</p>
<p>Louis, where he had been to purchase a few books and
</p>
<p>obtain a law license. This meeting of these young lawyers,
</p>
<p>who afterwards became so eminent, is happily described by
</p>
<p>Mr. Hayden's son, E. R. Hayden, Esq., at present a promi-
</p>
<p>nent lawyer at Boonville. We prefer to give his own words :
</p>
<p>" On my father's return home he remained overnight at St. Charles, and
</p>
<p>there, on the porch of the old log tavern, he first met and became acquainted
</p>
<p>with Abiel Leonard. I have often heard him refer to the incident. Leonard
</p>
<p>was sitting at one end of the porch, engaged, apparently, in reading a news-
</p>
<p>paper, while my father was at the other end, carrying on a slight flirtation with
</p>
<p>the pretty daughter of the tavern-keeper (he was always fond of the fair sex).
</p>
<p>He mentioned to her the object of his visit to St. Louis; that he had succeeded
</p>
<p>in procuring a license to practice law, and was ready and willing to share the
</p>
<p>honor with some pretty girl  for instance, herself. Leonard was listening,
</p>
<p>and when he heard my father mention the fact that he had a license to practice
</p>
<p>law, he immediately laid aside his paper, and, approaching, introduced himself,
</p>
<p>and stated that he was also a lawyer, and from New York, and was in search
</p>
<p>of a location, and was on his way to Franklin. Father described him as being
</p>
<p>quite small, very spare and thin in person, with a singularly green look, and
</p>
<p>absolutely homely. Location, prospects, etc., were discussed, and Leonard

</p>
<p>was furnished with a glowing description of the Boonslick country. Old
</p>
<p>Franklin then contained a population of 1,800, and prospectively was consid-
</p>
<p>ered the best location in the territory for a lawyer. Leonard concluded to
</p>
<p>make the trial, and  accordingly the next morning started on foot, with his
</p>
<p>worldly goods and chattels in a bundle tied to the end of a stick, and placed
</p>
<p>over his shoulder, while father was on horseback. Another person, also on
</p>
<p>horseback, and on his way to the same place, happened with them, and they
</p>
<p>offered to ride turn about with Leonard, but he declined ; and being of light
</p>
<p>weight and a good walker, all reached Franklin about the same time."
</p>
<p>35'^ BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Tradition gives another version of this trip to Frankhn,
</p>
<p>which is not so well authenticated. It represents Hayden
</p>
<p>and Leonard traveling alone, and riding alternately Hayden's
</p>
<p>horse. They found some streams in one of the upper coun-
</p>
<p>ties too full to ford, owing to recent rains, one of which they
</p>
<p>were in a dilemma to know how to cross. Hayden said he
</p>
<p>could not s\\ im a lick, and he did not know whether his old
</p>
<p>horse could. Some few hundred yards from the bank, on the
</p>
<p>opposite side, they saw a cabin, and Leonard, being a good
</p>
<p>swimmer, proposed to swim over and procure assistance from
</p>
<p>the cabin. He stripped himself to his drawers, and, tying
</p>
<p>his clothes upon his back, started in. When he reached the
</p>
<p>middle of the stream, the strength of the current broke the
</p>
<p>string, and away went his clothes down the river. Here was
</p>
<p>a predicament that he had not anticipated. He approached
</p>
<p>within thirty or fort)' }'ards of the cabin and hallooed, con-
</p>
<p>cealed, however, in a thick hazel-bush. When the lady who
</p>
<p>responded to his call got within fifteen yards of him, he
</p>
<p>called to her not to come nearer, and informed her of his
</p>
<p>misfortune, and asked if she could not send him an old pair
</p>
<p>of pants and shirt of her husband's. She promised to do so,
</p>
<p>and sent a boy with them to him. Now, it must be known
</p>
<p>that this good lady's husband was a man of six feet two, and
</p>
<p>turned the scale at 250 pounds, while Mr. Leonard was only
</p>
<p>five feet four, and never weighed over 100. The good man,
</p>
<p>on returning home, brought Mr. Hayden over, and Hayden
</p>
<p>said that the appearance of Mr. Leonard in his new garb
</p>
<p>was enough to make a Methodist minister laugh at his dea-
</p>
<p>con's funeral. Upon reaching the first country store, a more
</p>
<p>suitable outfit was obtained.
</p>
<p>After being in Franklin about a week, a farmer called upon
</p>
<p>Mr. Hayden to retain him in a suit before a justice of the
</p>
<p>peace, growing out of a horse-trade. Hayden told him that
</p>
<p>he was already employed in behalf of the plaintiff, but

</p>
<p>advised him to call on Mr. Leonard. He did so, but soon
</p>
<p>returned to Hayden, and said, " Mr. Hayden, do you expect
</p>
<p>me to employ such a looking man as this young law}'er you
</p>
<p>have sent me to ? " " Why," said Hayden, " he is a very
</p>
<p>good lawyer, and will do you full justice." He employed
</p>
<p>ABJEL LEONARD. 359
</p>
<p>him accordingly, but unfortunately Mr. Leonard lost his suit,
</p>
<p>and he became so sensitive in regard to it that Hayden took
</p>
<p>him to his own room and kept him there several days, appre-
</p>
<p>hensive that he might do himself some violence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Leonard never could divest himself of this feeling of
</p>
<p>disappointment at the loss of a suit, and acquired a not
</p>
<p>unusual habit of charging it to the stupidity of the judge.
</p>
<p>We have in our mind's eye a prominent lawyer at the St.
</p>
<p>Louis bar who invariably does the same.
</p>
<p>It reminds us of a good story told by O'Neall, in his
</p>
<p>" Sketches of the Georgia Lawyers," upon a witty judge of
</p>
<p>that state. An attorney by the name of Nibbs practiced be-
</p>
<p>fore him, and upon one occasion became much distressed at
</p>
<p>the loss of a suit. In speaking of it to the judge, upon the
</p>
<p>adjournment of the court, he remarked, " Oh, how can I go
</p>
<p>home and tell my client that I have lost his case!" The
</p>
<p>judge replied, " Nibbs, go home and tell your client you had
</p>
<p>a good case, but the judge was a d  d fool ; that he did not
</p>
<p>understand your case, and therefore you lost it."
</p>
<p>After Mr. Leonard reached Franklin his means became en-
</p>
<p>tirely exhausted, and he opened a school m the neighborhood,
</p>
<p>and taught six months, at the same time devoting all his leis-
</p>
<p>ure hours to reading some law-books which he had borrowed.
</p>
<p>He then located at Boonville, on the opposite side of the
</p>
<p>river, and remained there about two years, when he returned
</p>
<p>to Franklin. The old town was washed away by the strong
</p>
<p>current of the river, and he then removed to new Franklin.
</p>
<p>From incessant study his eyes began to fail him, and he rode
</p>
<p>on horseback to Kentucky to consult and advise with some
</p>
<p>occulists. They advised him to abstain from reading, as the
</p>
<p>only remedy they could suggest. This he was forced to do,
</p>
<p>and on returning home employed a young man to read to
</p>
<p>him. In time his eyes became stronger, and he continued
</p>
<p>his practice with great diligence, having to encounter some

</p>
<p>Howard ; and Hayden, to Boonville.
</p>
<p>From this time Mr. Leonard began to rise rapidly in the
</p>
<p>profe.ssion, until he became its head and front. Business
</p>
<p>flowed in upon him fast, and he soon had the pick of the best
</p>
<p>cases in Central Missouri, and in the Supreme Court he out-
</p>
<p>ranked all others.
</p>
<p>In 1823 he was appointed state's attorney for his judicial
</p>
<p>district, to fill out the unexpired term of Mr. Gamble, who
</p>
<p>had resigned upon being appointed secretary of state ; and
</p>
<p>as a very singular coincidence, forty years afterwards Mr.
</p>
<p>Leonard was appointed judge of the Supreme Court, to fill
</p>
<p>an unexpired term of the same distinguished gen-tleman.
</p>
<p>He bought a beautiful tract of land adjoining Fayette, im-
</p>
<p>proved it handsomely, and made it his future home. He
</p>
<p>gave it the name of " Oakwood," and it is still the home-
</p>
<p>stead of his family. He was always much attached to this
</p>
<p>place, and spent much of his "time in roaming through its
</p>
<p>beautiful woods.
</p>
<p>We are not aware that Mr. Leonard ever made a partner-
</p>
<p>ship in his practice, with the exception of one. He and
</p>
<p>General S. M. Bay practiced together in the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>for many years, and it continued until General Bay removed
</p>
<p>to St. Louis.
</p>
<p>Before changing his residence from Franklin to Fayette,
</p>
<p>Mr. Leonard became involved in a personal difficulty with a
</p>
<p>Major Berry. It had its origin in the prejudice then existing
</p>
<p>against the Yankees, as they were termed in derision. As
</p>
<p>soon as an Eastern lawyer settled among them, some one was
</p>
<p>put forward to test his mettle; for it was generally supposed
</p>
<p>that his puritanical education, and the natural aversion of the
</p>
<p>Eastern people for dueling, would prevent him from resenting
</p>
<p>an injury in the mode which then prevailed in the South and

<p>West. We are not posted as to the particulars, but Berry,
</p>
<p>under some pretense, attacked Mr. Leonard with a whip or
</p>
<p>cowhide. Mr. Leonard made all the resistance in his power,
</p>
<p>but, being a very small man, and his antagonist a large, ath-
</p>
<p>ABIEL LEONARD. 36 1
</p>
<p>letic man, he was easily overpowered. The insult aroused
</p>
<p>the pluck of Leonard which had been transmitted to him by
</p>
<p>his ancestry, and without a moment's hesitation he sent
</p>
<p>Major Berry the following note:
</p>
<p>"Franklin, June 2b, 1824.
</p>
<p>" Sir : I demand a personal interview with you. My friend Mr. Boggs will
</p>
<p>make the necessary arrangements on my part.
</p>
<p>" Yours, etc.,
</p>
<p>" A. Leonard.
</p>
<p>"Major Berry.'"
</p>
<p>To which Major Berry replied as follows:
</p>
<p>" Franklin, Mo., June 28, 1824.
</p>
<p>" Sir : Your note of the 26th has been received. Without urging the objec-
</p>
<p>tions which I might have to the note itself, or to the demand which it contains,
</p>
<p>I shall answer it, to redeem a promise which I made at Fayette (in passion) that
</p>
<p>I will give you the demanded interview. My business, which embraces many
</p>
<p>duties to others, will require my personal attention until after the first of Sep-
</p>
<p>tember next, after which time any further delay will be asked from you only.
</p>
<p>"To make any arrangements, Maj. A. L. Langham will attend on my part.
</p>
<p>" Yours, etc.,
</p>
<p>" Taylor Berry."
</p>
<p>Shortly before the meeting took place Mr. Leonard was
</p>
<p>arrested by direction of Judge Todd, and required to give
</p>
<p>bond in the sum of ;^5,ooo to keep the peace. He said to the
</p>
<p>judge, " Name the amount of the bond ; foh I am determined
</p>
<p>to keep my appointment with Major Berry." Near the lat-
</p>
<p>ter part of August the parties, with their seconds and sur-
</p>
<p>geons, proceeded down the river, having previously entered
</p>
<p>into  through their seconds  the following stipulation to
</p>
<p>meet at some point near New Madrid, in the southern part
</p>
<p>of the state :
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>On their way to New Madrid, Mr. Leonard and his second
</p>
<p>stopped overnight at St. Louis, and while at the hotel some
</p>
<p>of the police, who had in some unknown way got wind of
</p>
<p>what was going on, went to the hotel to arrest Mr. Leonard,
</p>
<p>but were frustrated by the ingenuity of Mr. Boggs. As
</p>
<p>they entered the room they asked for Mr. Leonard, when

</p>
<p>Mr. Boggs rose and said, "That is m\' name." They at once
</p>
<p>arrested him, which gave Leonard the chance to escape.
</p>
<p>Finding that they had got the wrong man, they released Mr.
</p>
<p>Boggs, who proceeded on his way to New Madrid, and
</p>
<p>reached there in time for the meeting.
</p>
<p>We conclude the narrative of this duel by stating that the
</p>
<p>parties met at the time and place appointed, and Major Berry
</p>
<p>fell at the first fire, mortally wounded, and soon after died.
</p>
<p>In after-life Mr. Leonard never alluded to the duel in the
</p>
<p>ABIEL LEONARD. 363
</p>
<p>presence of his children, and only once or twice to his wife,
</p>
<p>and then only to say that he never regretted the course he
</p>
<p>pursued.
</p>
<p>Under the Constitution and laws he was disfranchised and
</p>
<p>disbarred, but the people, who almost universally approved
</p>
<p>of his course, petitioned the Legislature for the removal of
</p>
<p>his disabilities, and at the next session he was restored to all
</p>
<p>his rights as a citizen.
</p>
<p>In October, 1830, Judge Leonard married Jeannette,
</p>
<p>daughter of Colonel B. H. Reeves, of Kentucky, one of the
</p>
<p>ablest lawyers and finest orators of that state, and soon after
</p>
<p>removed to Fayette, which became his home through life.
</p>
<p>At the August election in 1834 he was induced to become a
</p>
<p>candidate for the Legislature, and was elected by a large
</p>
<p>majority. Our Constitution required a revision of the laws
</p>
<p>every ten years, and, as this was to be the revising session,
</p>
<p>it was desirable to send to the Legislature the best legal
</p>
<p>talent at our command. Mr. Leonard labored very hard to
</p>
<p>secure a revision that would be acceptable to the people, and
</p>
<p>it is universally conceded by the profession that the revision
</p>
<p>of 1834-5, has never been equalled by any since.
</p>
<p>The bar of Missouri had long evinced a strong desire to
</p>
<p>see Mr. Leonard on the bench of our Supreme Court, and
</p>
<p>finally, when a vacancy occurred by the resignation of Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Gamble, he was appointed to the place. The large
</p>
<p>amount of labor performed by him while on the bench made
</p>
<p>a deep inroad upon his physical constitution, and he was
</p>
<p>forced to resign.
</p>
<p>As a jurist Judge Leonard never had a superior in our
</p>
<p>state, and his opinions from the bench will compare favor-
</p>
<p>ably with those of any other jurist now wearing the ermine.
</p>
<p>They will be found in volumes 20 to 25, inclusive, of our
</p>
<p>State Reports. They abound in great legal learning and
</p>
<p>research. We refer to one as a fair specimen of all.

<p>The case of Whiteside vs. Cannon, reported in the 23d
</p>
<p>volume, page 457, is exhaustive of the subject he was treat-
</p>
<p>ing. It presented several difficult questions growing out of.
</p>
<p>the rights and liabilities of married women respecting their
</p>
<p>364 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>separate estates. All the leading cases, both in England
</p>
<p>and this country, are referred to and commented upon. In
</p>
<p>fact, the subject was exhausted, and his conclusions are now
</p>
<p>regarded as the settled law of this state. The reader will
</p>
<p>notice that his style of composition is unclouded by fine or
</p>
<p>subtle distinctions. There is no attempt to evade, or not
</p>
<p>squarely meet, the questions presented, nor can his language
</p>
<p>be so tortured or construed as to admit of any possible doubt
</p>
<p>as to his meaning. He was very jealous of his diction, and
</p>
<p>would rewrite his opinions over and over before filing them
</p>
<p>with the clerk. This imposed upon him a large amount of
</p>
<p>unnecessary labor.
</p>
<p>In this respect judges greatly differ. Judge Wagner
</p>
<p>rarely made any alteration in his first draft. Judge Napton
</p>
<p>never rewrites his opinions, but his manuscript abounds in
</p>
<p>numerous corrections and interlineations. The force of
</p>
<p>habit, facility of thought, and mental training undoubtedly
</p>
<p>have much to do with this.
</p>
<p>Judge Leonard was not an orator. He had few of the
</p>
<p>graces of elocution. There was nothing remarkably pleasing
</p>
<p>in his gesture, and his voice was harsh and coarse. When
</p>
<p>he started off in an argument he would pitch his voice to a
</p>
<p>particular tone, and there keep it to the close. His great
</p>
<p>power as a lawyer was in his masterly logic. His mind was
</p>
<p>peculiarly and essentially logical, rejecting all merely plausi-
</p>
<p>ble reasons as he would the false. Not only was he essen-
</p>
<p>tially logical, but truthful  and as exact in his moral as in
</p>
<p>his intellectual logic.
</p>
<p>While listening to him you lost sight of the man and his
</p>
<p>imperfection as a mere orator, and your attention was rivited
</p>
<p>by the profoundness of his argument and the depth of his
</p>
<p>reasoning. He laid down his premises with great fairness,
</p>
<p>and gradually led the minds of his audience to the adoption
</p>
<p>of his conclusions.

<p>In a recent letter from General Stringfellow, an able and
</p>
<p>accomplished lawyer at Atchison, and one of the brightest
</p>
<p>lights of the profession, who had long known Judge Leonard,
</p>
<p>he thus speaks of him :
</p>
<p>ABIEL LEONARD. 365
</p>
<p>" I had, especially in the Supreme Court, an opportunity to form an estimate
</p>
<p>of his ability as a lawyer. My estimate may have been influenced by my
</p>
<p>friendship, for I have known no one whose commanding intellect, profound
</p>
<p>learning, spotless integrity, unpretending generosities and kindness, unflinch-
</p>
<p>ing courage, moral and physical  in a word, whose head and heart so entirely
</p>
<p>captivated me. He was of a class of lawyers almost extinct, such as can
</p>
<p>hardly be made in this age of books and decisions  since cases, rather than
</p>
<p>principles, have become the study of the lawyer. I never knew one who
</p>
<p>could give a better reason for his assertions than Judge Leonard. He was
</p>
<p>equally familiar with common law and chancery, with civil law and criminal.
</p>
<p>He was both advocate and counsel. While I have known others to excel him
</p>
<p>as orators, I have known none who could excel him in the argument of a law
</p>
<p>question, or in the discussion" of the conclusions from facts submitted to a
</p>
<p>jury. As I once testified in court, in my opinion he was the ablest lawyer I
</p>
<p>have known."
</p>
<p>Judge Leonard had no aspirations for office or political
</p>
<p>prominence, or anything that would interfere witli his pro-
</p>
<p>fession ; yet he took a deep interest in everything that was
</p>
<p>going on in the political world. He was an unflinching Whig,
</p>
<p>and had he lived in the time of Hamilton and the elder
</p>
<p>Adams he would have been an uncompromising Federalist.
</p>
<p>His dislike for Democracy was 'equal to that of Chancellor
</p>
<p>Kent.
</p>
<p>Edwards says that a lawyer once called upon the chancel-
</p>
<p>lor and found him reading the New York Evening Post, a
</p>
<p>rabid Democratic journal, "What, Chancellor; you, of all
</p>
<p>men, reading the Evening Post f" " Yes," said the chancel-
</p>
<p>lor; "and pray why should not I see what the devil is doing
</p>
<p>in the world, as well as other persons."
</p>
<p>Judge Leonard had a great contempt for chronic office-
</p>
<p>seekers and self-constituted lovers of the dear people.
</p>
<p>Being always in a minority in his own state, he had the good
</p>
<p>sense to know that he could not succeed in public life.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the tie which bound him to his home at Fayette

</p>
<p>was too strong to permit him to be drawn into the vortex of
</p>
<p>political strife. Besides, we have often heard him say "that
</p>
<p>the life of a politician was the meanest and most servile that
</p>
<p>a man could lead ; that he lost his self-respect and independ-
</p>
<p>ence, and was liable at any moment to fall a victim to the
</p>
<p>whims and caprices of a vacillating public opinion."
</p>
<p>Mr. Leonard was not alone in this view. Probably no
</p>
<p>3<56 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>public man in this counti}' was more successful in his polit-
</p>
<p>ical efforts than Martin Van Buren, for he filled every posi
</p>
<p>tion within tlic gift of the people; yet before passing away
</p>
<p>he placed upon record his experience of the life of a public
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>Shortly after his death we were on a visit to the East, and
</p>
<p>spent several days in our native place, Hudson City, New
</p>
<p>York, which -is only eight miles from Kinderhook, the life-
</p>
<p>time residence of Mr. Van Buren. We had occasion to visit
</p>
<p>the office of the surrogate, he being an old law-partner of
</p>
<p>our father, and whom we had known in our boyhood.
</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr. Van Buren, he remarked that the autograph
</p>
<p>will of the late president was in his office, and he desired to
</p>
<p>show it to us, as it contained a very remarkable clause, indi-
</p>
<p>cating Mr. Van Buren's idea of the little satisfaction and
</p>
<p>happiness to be derived from even a successful public career.
</p>
<p>We once had a copy of it, but it has been mislaid. The
</p>
<p>opening part, as we recollect it, is as follows :
</p>
<p>"I, Martin Van Ihuen, formerly governor ot the slate of New York; at a
</p>
<p>later period United States senator, vice president, minister to the Court of St.
</p>
<p>James, and president of the United States; and lastly, and fhe Iiappiest
</p>
<p>period of viy life, a fanner in the toion of Kinderhook, do make and pub-
</p>
<p>lish this my last will and testament."
</p>
<p>What a commentary upon those who spend their lives
</p>
<p>seeking popular applause, and, when attained, find it is but a
</p>
<p>bubble, which soon vanishes and leaves them wondering why
</p>
<p>they ever craved it. Those who give up their lives to the
</p>
<p>acquisition of fame might be profited by the words of
</p>
<p>Dryden :
</p>
<p> When I consider life, 'tis all a cheat;
</p>
<p>V'et, fooled with hope, men favor the deceit 
</p>
<p>Trust on, and think lo-morrow will repay.
</p>
<p>To-morrow, falser than the former day,

<p>Lies worse ; and while it says we shall be blest

<p>With some new joys, cuts oft" what we possest.
</p>
<p>Strange cozenage; none would live jiast years again,

</p>
<p>And from the dregs of life think to receive
</p>
<p>What the first sprightly running could not give."
</p>
<p>ABIEL LEONARD. 367
</p>
<p>Judge Leonard was a devoted friend of the Union, and
</p>
<p>strongly opposed to the institution of shu^ry, though at one
</p>
<p>time he was himself a slaveholder. In his section of the
</p>
<p>state, servants could not readily be hired, and he purchased
</p>
<p>slaves from necessity. He had no charity for those who en-
</p>
<p>tered into the Rebellion. We once heard him remark " that
</p>
<p>the d  d rebels were fighting to destroy the government
</p>
<p>that their forefathers fought to obtain." He greatly regret-
</p>
<p>ted that his age and physical weakness would not permit him
</p>
<p>to enter the army, but he sent in his place a favorite, talented,
</p>
<p>and promising son, who while in the army contracted a dis-
</p>
<p>ease peculiar to a southern climate, which resulted in his
</p>
<p>death.
</p>
<p>Upon the subject of religion Judge Leonard had his own
</p>
<p>peculiar views, which he never obtruded on his friends.
</p>
<p>He attended the services of the Episcopal Church out of
</p>
<p>deference to the feelings of his family, yet he did not believe
</p>
<p>in the Bible as a revelation of the Divine will. He was, how-
</p>
<p>ever, a firm believer in a supreme ruler of the universe, and
</p>
<p>in the immortality of the soul.
</p>
<p>Tennyson said,
</p>
<p>" There lives more faith in honest doubt.
</p>
<p>Believe me, than in half the creeds."
</p>
<p>Beyond this it is doubtful if his powerful and logical mind
</p>
<p>ever fathomed the divine mysteries of our existence. In his
</p>
<p>habits he was temperate, abstemious, and frugal ; in his chari-
</p>
<p>ties, liberal and free. He was essentially domestic  a kind
</p>
<p>and indulgent father, and a most affectionate and devoted
</p>
<p>husband.
</p>
<p>He died March 28, 1863, in the sixty-sixth year of his
</p>
<p>age, surrounded by his family, and in the home he loved so
</p>
<p>well.
</p>
<p>Our acquaintance with Judge Leonard commenced in 1840.
</p>
<p>In the presidential election between Clay and Polk he took

</p>
<p>a deep interest, being a great admirer of Mr. Clay. A {^\v
</p>
<p>days after the election we met him at Jefferson City, and
</p>
<p>traveled on horseback with him to Columbia, in Boone
</p>
<p>368 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>County. He gave us a pressing invitation to spend a few
</p>
<p>days with him at Fayette, and, as inducement, offered to
</p>
<p>remain over a day at Columbia. We accepted his invitation.
</p>
<p>That night we occupied the same room at the hotel. The
</p>
<p>returns of the election came in very slowly, but enough had
</p>
<p>been heard to show that the result would depend on Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania ; and, as the vote was exceedingly close in that
</p>
<p>state, both parties were very apprehensive. We retired
</p>
<p>about ten o'clock, in advance of Mr, Leonard, who remained
</p>
<p>up in hopes of receiving further intelligence. About eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock a report came in to the effect that the old Key-stone
</p>
<p>had given Mr. Clay about 400 majority. There was great
</p>
<p>rejoicing among the Whigs, and the Glee Club (at the sug-
</p>
<p>gestion of Mr. Leonard, as we afterwards learned) assembled
</p>
<p>under our window, and entertained us with their songs,
</p>
<p>which, to a Democrat, was certainly a very poor entertain-
</p>
<p>ment. It was said that Mr. Leonard was so rejoiced that he
</p>
<p>made an attempt, though a very lame one, to join in the
</p>
<p>chorus. The next morning more authentic news was
</p>
<p>received, leaving but little doubt that the state had gone for
</p>
<p>Mr. Polk. In going into the breakfast-room we met Mr.
</p>
<p>Leonard coming out, looking gloomy and desponding. We
</p>
<p>accosted him with "Good morning, Mr. Leonard; cannot you
</p>
<p>favor us this morning with a glee song ? " " To the devil,"
</p>
<p>said he, "with your glee songs; the country has gone to h  1,
</p>
<p>and the sooner the people find it out the better."
</p>
<p>Judge Leonard was a purely matter-of-fact man, and never
</p>
<p>could enjoy anything ludicrous or humorous. He could not
</p>
<p>even appreciate a good anecdote, and if made the subject of
</p>
<p>a piece of witticism always felt aggrieved. We have already
</p>
<p>alluded to his homely appearance. Besides being very dimin-
</p>
<p>utive in stature, he had large, coarse, ill-formed features, and
</p>
<p>it might be said of him, as was said of Rufus Choate  " his
</p>
<p>face was a compound of wrinkles, yellow jaundice, and juris-

<p>prudence." Contrary to the generality of mankind thus af-
</p>
<p>flicted, he was very sensitive in regard to it. Upon one oc-
</p>
<p>casion John Miller, of Cooper County, a state senator, who
</p>
<p>had the sobriquet of " Old Ugly," from the fact of being one of
</p>
<p>ABIEL LEONARD. . 369
</p>
<p>the homeliest men in the state, and who prided himself upon
</p>
<p>his notoriety in that respect, visited Fayette. He was an old
</p>
<p>friend of Mr. Leonard, and seeing him talking among a group
</p>
<p>of gentlemen near the court-house, approached and joined in
</p>
<p>the conversation. Turning suddenly upon Mr. Leonard, he
</p>
<p>remarked, " Leonard, I have a piece of property in my pos-
</p>
<p>session that belongs to you, though I have carried it several
</p>
<p>years, this being the first opportunity I have had to deliver it
</p>
<p>to its owner;" and, suiting the action to the word, drew from
</p>
<p>his pocket an old jackknife and tendered it to him. In-
</p>
<p>stead of accepting the joke in the spirit in which it was
</p>
<p>offered, Mr. Leonard became highly incensed, and noth-
</p>
<p>ing but a rapid retreat upon the part of Miller prevented
</p>
<p>a collision.
</p>
<p>During one of the sessions of the Supreme Court at Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son City, Mr. Leonard, Hon. Samuel T. Glover, and Carty
</p>
<p>Wells were there, attending upon the court. They put up at
</p>
<p>the Stone Hotel, immediately on the bank of the river, and
</p>
<p>after dinner were in the habit of taking a stroll together up
</p>
<p>and down the river. Upon one of these occasions, and while
</p>
<p>standing upon the bank. Judge Leonard became very elo-
</p>
<p>quent in his description of the river. " Ah," said he,
</p>
<p>"it is the great Father of Waters. . It takes its rise in the
</p>
<p>Rocky Mountains, and majestically winds its way to the gulf.
</p>
<p>When it enters the Mississippi it swallows up that stream,
</p>
<p>continuing on its way, and carrying upon its bosom the great
</p>
<p>commerce of the West. Noble stream ! The greatest Roman
</p>
<p>of them all!" Here Judge Wells interrupted him, saying,
</p>
<p>" Leonard, you are right ; if you will take out the sand-bars,
</p>
<p>and let in a little more water, it would make a mighty good
</p>
<p>stream for small craft." Mr. Leonard turned his big black
</p>
<p>eyes upon him with astonishment" and said to him, " You
</p>
<p>are a d  d fool," and, turning upon his heel, walked off most
</p>
<p>thoroughly disgusted. He never could tolerate Wells after-

</p>
<p>Thomas B. English.
</p>
<p>We became acquainted with the gentleman whose name is
</p>
<p>at the head of this article in the winter of 1846-7. We were
</p>
<p>then serving together in the Legislature, he representing the
</p>
<p>county of Cape Girardeau. He seemed to be a mild and
</p>
<p>amiable gentleman, of excellent habits, and free from those
</p>
<p>vices which are not uncommon in legislative bodies. We
</p>
<p>noticed that he mingled very little with the members, and
</p>
<p>seemed disposed to avoid a general acquaintance. As a
</p>
<p>speaker he was fluent and argumentative, making no effort
</p>
<p>to obtain reputation as an orator. He mingled freely in the
</p>
<p>debates, and always commanded the attention of the House,
</p>
<p>and, although unpopular by reason of his exclusiveness, was
</p>
<p>credited with more than ordinary intelligence. We served
</p>
<p>with him on several important committees, and found him
</p>
<p>hard-working and laborious. He exhibited much anxiety to
</p>
<p>obtain a seat in Congress, and when the bill for laying off the
</p>
<p>state into congressional districts came up, he evinced a great
</p>
<p>desire to procure such a district in his section of the state
</p>
<p>as would favor his political aspirations. He committed the
</p>
<p>error of supposing that he could better pave the way to suc-
</p>
<p>cess by obtaining the good-will of both political parties, and
</p>
<p>to accomplish this was found frequently voting with the
</p>
<p>Whigs. This led to a suspicion on the part of the Demo-
</p>
<p>crats as to his fealty to his own party, and doubtless weak-
</p>
<p>ened his chances for political promotion.
</p>
<p>Mr. English was a native of Louisiana, and born at Harri-
</p>
<p>sonburgh, July 15, 1811. He became an orphan at a very
</p>
<p>early age, and was brought up and educated by relatives, the
</p>
<p>chief of whom was an uncle by the name of Simeon English.
</p>
<p>When a small boy, in the year 18 17, he came to Missouri
</p>
<p>with his uncle and other relatives, who settled in Cape Gi-

</p>
<p>of Andrew Giboney, and after remaining there about two
</p>
<p>years entered St. Mary's College, in Perry County, where he
</p>
<p>received a classical education, and obtained a diploma as
</p>
<p>Master of Arts. To enable him to meet a liabilit}' incurred
</p>
<p>in his education, he remained in the college two years after
</p>
<p>graduating, teaching the Latin and Greek languages.
</p>
<p>In 1834 he married, and, having fixed upon the law as his
</p>
<p>vocation, entered as a student the law-office of Colonel Ran-
</p>
<p>ney, an eminent lawyer at Jackson, and in due time was ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to the bar, and commenced his practice at Jackson.
</p>
<p>He soon obtained a fair amount of business, which gradually
</p>
<p>increased under his studious habits and close application.
</p>
<p>As is well known, Missouri was limited at that time, by her
</p>
<p>Constitution, to one bank and five branches. Chiefly by the
</p>
<p>efforts of Mr. English one of these branches was located at
</p>
<p>Jackson, and Mr. English became its cashier, and continued
</p>
<p>so for a period of twelve years. For several years he was
</p>
<p>receiver of the United States Land Office at Jackson, and in
</p>
<p>i860 was returned to the State Senate. In 1864 he was
</p>
<p>elected judge of the Tenth Judicial Circuit, but was ousted
</p>
<p>from office in 1865 by the Drake Constitution.
</p>
<p>He died on November 11, 1866, leaving a widow and four

<p>JOHN H. STONE.
</p>
<p>We first met Judge Stone at a State Democratic Conven-
</p>
<p>tion held at Jefferson City in the spring of 1840. He was a
</p>
<p>delegate from Callaway County, and had been at the bar but
</p>
<p>a short time. His fine, commanding appearance and digni-
</p>
<p>fied deportment made a favorable impression upon the Con-
</p>
<p>vention. Upon some question relating to the organization
</p>
<p>of the body he made a brief speech, which was well delivered
</p>
<p>and well received.
</p>
<p>We did not meet him again until in 1843, when he was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed, by Governor Reynolds, judge of the Ninth Judicial
</p>
<p>Circuit, composed of the counties of Franklin, Gasconade,
</p>
<p>Washington, Jefferson, St. Fran9ois, and Perry. For several
</p>
<p>years we attended two or three of his courts, and had ample
</p>
<p>means of forming an estimate of his character and judicial
</p>
<p>attainments. Though popular with the people, he had been
</p>
<p>defeated the year before as a candidate for the Legislature.
</p>
<p>Judge Stone was a native of Tennessee, but raised and
</p>
<p>educated near Georgetown, Kentucky, to which place his
</p>
<p>parents had removed. We are not aware that he was a
</p>
<p>graduate of any college, but his education was ver}- liberal.
</p>
<p>He read the Latin language with great facility, and had
</p>
<p>some knowledge of Greek. His legal education was com-
</p>
<p>pleted at the law school in Lexington. He came to Missouri
</p>
<p>in the winter of 1836-7, and located at Fulton, in Callaway
</p>
<p>County, where he practiced until elevated to the bench. He
</p>
<p>remained on the bench until some time in the early part of
</p>
<p>the war, when he fell a victim to the turbulent spirit which
</p>
<p>reigned throughout the state.
</p>
<p>That Judge Stone sympathized with the Confederacy is
</p>
<p>unquestionably true, but that he ever committed any overt
</p>
<p>act against his government, or was guilty of any act of hos-

</p>
<p>tility, or even imprudence in conversation, is not true. He
</p>
<p>374 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>looked upon the war as one of the greatest calamities that
</p>
<p>had ever befallen the human race. Naturally of a timid dis-
</p>
<p>position, its evils became greatly magnified in his imagina-
</p>
<p>tion. His mind was constantly dwelling upon it, until his
</p>
<p>reason became almost dethroned. To cap the climax, he
</p>
<p>was arrested upon the charge of disloyalty, and thrown into
</p>
<p>the Gratiot-Street Prison in St. Louis. The real motive for
</p>
<p>his arrest was to prevent him from holding his courts in one
</p>
<p>or two counties in which large amounts of property w'ere
</p>
<p>advertised to be sold under execution. Threats of violence,
</p>
<p>if he attempted to hold court, reached his ears, and he be-
</p>
<p>came almost frantic.
</p>
<p>Having occasion to visit the Gratiot Prison, we were
</p>
<p>greatly surprised at finding him there, and immediately ten-
</p>
<p>dered our serx'ices to procure his release. He had no desire
</p>
<p>to obtain his liberty, expressing the belief that he was safer
</p>
<p>there than he would be at large. We discovered a great
</p>
<p>change in his mind, and went at once to the office of the
</p>
<p>provost-marshal and obtained an order for his discharge.
</p>
<p>He went up among his old friends in Callaway, and finally
</p>
<p>settled with his family upon a small farm in the western part
</p>
<p>of St. Charles, or eastern part of Warren, County. We
</p>
<p>never saw him afterwards. The effect of the war, and the
</p>
<p>personal ill-treatment to which he was subjected, hurried him
</p>
<p>rapidly to his grave. He must have died shortly after the
</p>
<p>close of the war.
</p>
<p>A more upright, honest, and conscientious man never lived.
</p>
<p>He was as unsuspecting and artless as a child, and readily fell
</p>
<p>into the snare of those who for selfish purposes contrived his
</p>
<p>overthrow. We never regarded Judge Stone as a profound
</p>
<p>juri.st, but his deficiency in that respect was more than made
</p>
<p>up by his spotless integrity and true devotion to the duties of
</p>
<p>his office. While on the bench he resided most of his time at

<p>Potosi. He left a wife and several children.
</p>
<p>FiDELio C. Sharp,
</p>
<p>Who was one of the most eminent lawyers at the Missouri
</p>
<p>bar, spent a part of his professional life in Lexington, Lafay-
</p>
<p>ette County, and the balance in the city of St. Louis. He
</p>
<p>was born in Hopkinsville, Christian County, Kentucky, on
</p>
<p>August 24, 1 82 1, and died in St. Louis on November 28,
</p>
<p>1875, at the age of fifty-four years.
</p>
<p>His grandfather, Captain Thomas Sharp, of Virginia, was
</p>
<p>a gallant soldier of the Revolution, and after the recognition
</p>
<p>of our independence removed to Tennessee, and settled near
</p>
<p>where Nashville now stands. At that time the country was
</p>
<p>filled with hostile Indians, and the farmers had to cultivate
</p>
<p>the soil with gun in hand. While plowing in his field Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Sharp was attacked by a Cherokee Indian, and very
</p>
<p>seriously wounded. He afterwards removed to Kentucky
</p>
<p>and located near Russellville, and died there at an advanced
</p>
<p>age, leaving a large family, including five sons, two of whom
</p>
<p>were physicians, and two eminent lawyers ; and the fifth one,
</p>
<p>Absalom M. Sharp, the father of the subject of this sketch,
</p>
<p>was in early life a merchant, but finally became a farmer.
</p>
<p>The family were noted throughout Kentucky for their in-
</p>
<p>telligence, influence, and enterprise. Fidelio C. Sharp was
</p>
<p>only fourteen years of age at the time of his father's death,
</p>
<p>and the care and responsibility of maintaining and raising
</p>
<p>the family devolved upon him and his widowed mother, he
</p>
<p>being the oldest of the sons. This fact no doubt tended
</p>
<p>largely to the development of that energy and independence
</p>
<p>of character which distinguished him through life. Even at
</p>
<p>the early age of fourteen his education, under the instruction
</p>
<p>of one James D. Rumsey, a teacher of rare excellence and
</p>
<p>learning, was well advanced, and though interrupted for a
</p>
<p>time by the death of his father, and the necessity thereby im-

</p>
<p>the farm, was resumed with additional energy under the same
</p>
<p>teacher, and with reference to his entering upon the study of
</p>
<p>the law ; for in his earliest years he expressed a strong desire
</p>
<p>to make the law his profession. He commenced the study
</p>
<p>of the law in the office of Sharp & Stiles, at Hopkinsville,
</p>
<p>and was there admitted to the bar at the age of. twenty-one.
</p>
<p>He could not have practiced long in Kentucky before he
</p>
<p>determined to come to Missouri, for in 1843 he located in
</p>
<p>Lexington, Lafayette County, and made a partnership with
</p>
<p>John P. Campbell  the style of the firm being Sharp &
</p>
<p>Campbell. The partnership continued several years, and
</p>
<p>upon its dissolution Mr. Sharp formed a business connection
</p>
<p>with the Hon. William T. Wood, present judge of the Sixth
</p>
<p>Judicial Circuit, and subsequently with Hon. Samuel L. Saw-
</p>
<p>yer, late judge of the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit. Their
</p>
<p>practice, which became very extensive, embraced the courts
</p>
<p>of Lafayette, Clay, Ray, Carroll, Saline, Johnson, Jackson,
</p>
<p>Bates, and Cass. Mr. Sharp's bright intellect, fine legal
</p>
<p>attainments, indomitable energy, and spotless integrity
</p>
<p>caused him to rise rapidly in his profession, and he soon took
</p>
<p>rank among the foremost lawyers of central Missouri.
</p>
<p>Li 1857 he removed to St. Louis, and became associated
</p>
<p>in the practice with Mr. Thomas, and upon the death of Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas formed a partnership with the Hon. James O. Broad-
</p>
<p>head, under the name and style of Sharp & Broadhead. This
</p>
<p>firm, so noted throughout the West for great legal ability,
</p>
<p>did a larger business than any other firm in St. Louis, and
</p>
<p>were retained in almost every case of much magnitude. It
</p>
<p>was dissolved by the death of Mr. Sharp, which took place
</p>
<p>very suddenly at his residence on the corner of Chouteau
</p>
<p>and St. Ange Avenues. He died in the prime of manhood,
</p>
<p>and in the full tide of professional success.
</p>
<p>Our acquaintance with Mr. Sharp commenced about the
</p>
<p>time of his removal to St. Louis, and from that period until

</p>
<p>his death we were thrown frequently together, and we learned
</p>
<p>to esteem him not only as a warm personal friend, but as a
</p>
<p>man of great legal ability, a high sense of honor, and most
</p>
<p>incorruptible integrity. We saw him in his office but a few
</p>
<p>FIDE LI O C. SUA A' P. ^J
</p>
<p>days before he was called upon to face the grim messenger
</p>
<p>of death, and his promise for a long and useful life was equal
</p>
<p>to that of any other lawyer of his age. We left a sick-bed
</p>
<p>to attend his funeral, and when we saw his inanimate body
</p>
<p>lying in its casket, we could not escape the reflection,
</p>
<p>" What shadows we are,
</p>
<p>What sliadows we pursue."
</p>
<p>The St. Louis bar held a meeting and adopted a series of
</p>
<p>resolutions expressive of the great loss they had sustained.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp's death was greatly mourned by the profession,
</p>
<p>particularly by the younger members, for his kindness to
</p>
<p>them was proverbial. He was ever ready to aid them with
</p>
<p>his advice and counsel, and many of them ascribe much of
</p>
<p>their success to his assistance. He was very fortunate in his
</p>
<p>domestic relations. He married twice, his first wife being
</p>
<p>a daughter of Captain Henry Wallace, of Lexington. She
</p>
<p>died in i860, and in 1864 he married Miss Maud, of St. Louis,
</p>
<p>who still survives him. Both were ladies of great worth,
</p>
<p>intelligence, and refinement.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp was tall and spare made, with dark hair and
</p>
<p>eyes, and his features denoted unusual intelligence. In his
</p>
<p>manner he was free, easy, and polite, and in his dress very
</p>
<p>neat and tasteful ; but there was an entire absence of studied
</p>
<p>dignity  nothing was feigned, and nothing assumed.
</p>
<p>In his political tenets he was Democratic  ready at all
</p>
<p>times to aid the cause, and very efficient on the eve of an
</p>
<p>election in the organization of the party forces ; but when
</p>
<p>called upon to become a candidate for Congress, and other
</p>
<p>positions of honor and high trust, he invariably refused.
</p>
<p>Time and again have we urged him to let his name be used
</p>
<p>for positions which almost any man would have been proud
</p>
<p>of, but he had but one reply to make : " I would not accept
</p>
<p>the best office within the gift of the people." His happiness
</p>
<p>was in his family and his profession, and nothing could en-

<p>tice him from either.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp was often charged with avarice, but beyond a
</p>
<p>strong desire to place himself in independent circumstances,

</p>
<p>and his family, in the event of his death, above want, we never
</p>
<p>saw any evidence of it. It is certainly true that many of his
</p>
<p>charities exhibited a strong compassion for the poor, and
</p>
<p>were never made public through his instrumentality. He
</p>
<p>was close and shrewd in a trade, and fond of making money,
</p>
<p>but there was nothing sordid or selfish in his composition.
</p>
<p>In his intercourse with his professional brethren he was can-
</p>
<p>did and courteous. There was nothing so repugnant to his
</p>
<p>nature as professional trickery, or a want of professional
</p>
<p>courtesy. He looked upon the law as an honorable calling,
</p>
<p>and often regretted the demoralization brought upon it by
</p>
<p>legal quacks and men of low instincts. Long before the
</p>
<p>organization of the Bar Association he expressed a strong
</p>
<p>desire for the adoption of some measure that would tend to
</p>
<p>purify and elevate the standard of the profession.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp was a man of a fine flow of spirits, enjoyed a

<p>Colonel J. O. Broadhead, who was his partner for many
</p>
<p>years, thus speaks of him as a lawyer:
</p>
<p>" I think I am not doing others injustice when I say that as a practitioner
</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp had no equal in the profession in this state; what I mean is, in the
</p>
<p>preparation and trial of a case before a iiisi-prius court. In learning everything

<p>that was to be known touching the merits of the case on either side ; in finding
</p>
<p>out and marshaling the testimony; in knowing beforehand all that each witness
</p>
<p>would swear to, as far as it was possible to be known ; in learning beforehand
</p>
<p>the character of the witness, and what would be his bearing upon the witness-
</p>
<p>stand ; in apprising him of the efforts that would be made to confuse and con-
</p>
<p>fute him by the other side, so that he might be prepared to stand the fire of a
</p>
<p>cross-examination; in preparing and arranging his papers; in anticipating
</p>
<p>the tactics of his adversary ; in looking up authorities u])on the different
</p>
<p>questions of law that would probably arise in the progress of the triiil; in

<p>always on the alert, earnest, vigilant, and making his client's case his own so
</p>
<p>completely as to command the unbounded confidence and devotion of every
</p>
<p>one whose cause he advocated. With such qualities he was necessarily em-
</p>
<p>inently successful in his practice, and left a reputation behind him of which
</p>
<p>his friends may well be proud."
</p>
<p>James Winston.
</p>
<p>This talented, popular, and eccentric lawyer was well
</p>
<p>known throughout central and western Missouri. We never
</p>
<p>saw him bui once, and he then occupied a seat in the State
</p>
<p>Senate. He was a rough diamond; a natural orator  un-
</p>
<p>adorned, unrefined, and unpolished. The gift of swaying
</p>
<p>the minds of men and leading them captive he inherited from
</p>
<p>his grandfather, the great Revolutionary orator, Patrick
</p>
<p>Henry, liis mother being the youngest daughter of Henry.
</p>
<p>But he certainly did not inherit any of the graces of his per-
</p>
<p>son, for a more undignified, rough, and awkward man did not
</p>
<p>belong to the Missouri bar.
</p>
<p>Mr. Winston was born in 1813 or 18 14, but whether in
</p>
<p>Virginia or North Carolina is a matter of some doubt. Soon
</p>
<p>after marrying Miss Henry his father settled on Dan River,
</p>
<p>in North Carolina, and James was one of the youngest of
</p>
<p>twelve children. This would seem to indicate that he was
</p>
<p>born in Carolina, but it has been said that at his birth his
</p>
<p>mother was on a visit to Virginia. His elder brothers,
</p>
<p>Patrick and George, received a collegiate education, but
</p>
<p>James and his younger brothers, by reason of their father's
</p>
<p>limited means, had to put up with such instruction as they
</p>
<p>could obtain in the common schools. His deficient educa-
</p>
<p>tion was a drawback to him through life, though he endeav-
</p>
<p>ored to make up for it by close and continued application to
</p>
<p>books. He was a constant reader, and, having a most reten-
</p>
<p>tive memory, was enabled to accumulate a large amount of
</p>
<p>historical, biographical, scientific, and legal knowledge. It
</p>
<p>is stated by those who were intimately acquainted with him
</p>
<p>that his knowledge of ancient history was unsurpassed. Of
</p>
<p>mathematics he knew nothing, and was positively ignorant

<p>of the simplest rules in arithmetic. His orthography was
</p>
<p>380 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>good, but his chirography and composition were very in-
</p>
<p>ferior. But he was chiefly distinguished for his briUiant
</p>
<p>conversational powers. When a subject was introduced that
</p>
<p>required the knowledge that comes from books and close
</p>
<p>and accurate reading, he appeared to great advantage, and
</p>
<p>in strange contrast with his clumsy and awkward demeanor.
</p>
<p>Mr. Winston came to Missouri as early as 1834, and first
</p>
<p>settled at Boonville. He afterwards moved to Warsaw, in
</p>
<p>Benton County, and practiced in the south-western counties.
</p>
<p>While representing the Benton District in the Senate, to
</p>
<p>which he was elected in 1850, he acquired considerable repu-
</p>
<p>tation as a fluent and witty speaker, and became quite popu-
</p>
<p>lar with the Whig party  so much so that in 1852 he was
</p>
<p>their nominee for governor. He ran against Sterling Price,
</p>
<p>the Democratic nominee. He was a noted walker, and when
</p>
<p>going around his circuit attending the courts, or canvassing
</p>
<p>the state for governor, he traveled on foot. He was very
</p>
<p>slovenly in his dress, and while at Boonville, on his way to
</p>
<p>St. Louis to fill an appointment, his Whig friends procured
</p>
<p>a new suit for him, which he was very loth to accept ; for he
</p>
<p>said he could not feel comfortable in his new garb, and his
</p>
<p>old friends would not recognize him. He was very fond of
</p>
<p>hunting and fishing, and was a great eater and a great
</p>
<p>drinker.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lay, in his history of Benton Count}', erroneously
</p>
<p>attributes to him the expression " that a turkey was an
</p>
<p>inconvenient bird  not enough for two, and too much for
</p>
<p>one." That noted saying originated with a distinguished
</p>
<p>Presbyterian clergyman in Albany, New York, by the name
</p>
<p>of Sprague, half a century ago. He was a noted gorman-
</p>
<p>dizer, and, when a young man, always paid double board.
</p>
<p>That Mr. Winston was a voracious eater, and delighted in
</p>
<p>all the creature comforts, as he called them, was unquestion-
</p>
<p>ably true  in fact, he had but little ambition for anything

<p>else. He had a good practice at the bar, but felt a strange
</p>
<p>aversion to asking his client for his fee ; consequently he
</p>
<p>scarcely ever had any money, and always labored under
</p>
<p>pecuniary embarrassment. A man of his habits and tastes

</p>
<p>could not become a very profound lawyer; yet he stood well
</p>
<p>at the bar, and was regarded as a successful practitioner.
</p>
<p>As a declainier he was witt}% sarcastic, and humorous.
</p>
<p>As a punster no one excelled him. This is an extremel)'
</p>
<p>rare gift, and while thousands attempt puns upon words, not
</p>
<p>one in a thousand is successful. Some of the English
</p>
<p>judges in Queen Elizabeth's time were noted for it. Jeaffer-
</p>
<p>son, in his book about English lawyers, gives several speci-
</p>
<p>mens. One relates to Hatton. In a land case tried before
</p>
<p>him, involving questions of location and boundary, one of
</p>
<p>the counsel, pointing to a map in his hand, remarked, with
</p>
<p>explanatory emphasis, "We lie on this side, my lord;" and
</p>
<p>the opposite counsel interposed, with equal vehemence, "We
</p>
<p>lie this side, my lord." The lord chancellor leaned back-
</p>
<p>wards, and dryly observed, " If }'ou lie on both sides, whom
</p>
<p>am I to believe ? "
</p>
<p>Baron Alderson, in reply to a juryman's confession that
</p>
<p>he was deaf in one ear, observed, "Then leave the box be-
</p>
<p>fore the trial begins; for it is necessary that jurymen should
</p>
<p>hear both sides''
</p>
<p>Edwards tells a very good one on Judge James Kent, of
</p>
<p>New York, a son of the chancellor. He was a regular at-
</p>
<p>tendant upon the Episcopal Church, and in the pew fronting
</p>
<p>him was one of the vestrymen, by the name of Henry, who
</p>
<p>in his responses was very slow and deliberate, and his words
</p>
<p>came, echo-like, after others. Coming out of the church one
</p>
<p>day, Kent said to him, " Brother Henry, why is it you ' de-
</p>
<p>scend into heir several minutes after the rest of the congre-
</p>
<p>gation ? "
</p>
<p>The following is attributed by Mr. Edwards to Charles
</p>
<p>O'Conor: "Where are you going?" said Mr. O'Conor,
</p>
<p>meeting Robert Dillon. " I am going to attend our broth-
</p>
<p>er's funeral; won't you go?" [O'Conor and the deceased
</p>
<p>had not been on good terms.] "Well," responded O'Conor,

<p>musingly, weighingly, " no, I think not; but then, again, per-
</p>
<p>haps I ought, for he certainly would have been delighted to
</p>
<p>attend my funeral."
</p>
<p>Mr. Winston seemed to have no definite purpose in life,

<p>except to be thought well of by his friends and in his profes-
</p>
<p>sion. He practiced law from necessity ; became a candidate
</p>
<p>for governor because his friends wished to use his name, and
</p>
<p>it is questionable if his defeat ever gave him a moment of
</p>
<p>pain. As long as he had plenty to eat and drink, and could
</p>
<p>indulge in his favorite amusements of fishing and hunting, he
</p>
<p>cared for nothing else.

</p>
<p>JOHN DELAFIELD.
</p>
<p>No nation pays more attention to the education of the
</p>
<p>young men destined for the learned professions than the
</p>
<p>EngHsh, and it would be difficult to refer to any one that is
</p>
<p>more negligent in that respect than our own. It is very rare
</p>
<p>to find an English barrister who is not a classical scholar,
</p>
<p>and who has not pursued a regular course of legal study ;
</p>
<p>while at least one-fourth of the attorneys of the United
</p>
<p>States are not only destitute of the rudiments of an English
</p>
<p>education, but have been admitted to the bar after a few
</p>
<p>months of superficial reading of Blackstone or Kent. In-
</p>
<p>deed, it is not uncommon in our own state to find ex-sheriffs
</p>
<p>and ex-clerks of counties applying for a license, with no
</p>
<p>other knowledge of the law but what they have picked up
</p>
<p>during their official service. It is for this reason that the
</p>
<p>profession, particularly in the West, occupies so inferior a
</p>
<p>position in public estimation. To what extent this may be
</p>
<p>remedied by legislation is a matter for the consideration of
</p>
<p>those who are called upon to enact our laws.
</p>
<p>John Delafield was an Englishman, born of English
</p>
<p>parents, in London, October 21, 18 12. When he was only
</p>
<p>ten years of age the family came to the United States, and
</p>
<p>settled in the city of New York. Intending to make a law-
</p>
<p>yer of his son, the father sent him to the best grammar-
</p>
<p>school in that city, and finally he was placed in Columbia
</p>
<p>College, where he graduated in 1830. During that year he
</p>
<p>was appointed librarian of the New York Historical Society.
</p>
<p>He then commenced the study of the law with Judge Arius
</p>
<p>Nye, of Marietta, Ohio, and, after applying himself dili-
</p>
<p>gently nearly three years, was admitted to the bar of that
</p>
<p>state, and soon after married Miss Edith Wallace, in Cincin-

<p>nati. After a few years' practice in Ohio he changed his
</p>
<p>384 BENCH AND BAR 0I< MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>residence to Memphis, Tennessee, and there acquired con-
</p>
<p>siderable reputation in his profession.
</p>
<p>In 1849 ^'^^ moved to St. Louis, and in 1852 we made his
</p>
<p>acquaintance. He was retained in a number of our im-
</p>
<p>portant land suits, and was regarded as an acquisition to the
</p>
<p>profession. Unfortunately for Mr. Delafield's professional
</p>
<p>success, he turned his attention to literary pursuits, for which
</p>
<p>he had always manifested a decided inclination. He wrote for
</p>
<p>the press several essays on scientific subjects, which were very
</p>
<p>favorably received. One of his works, entitled " Antiquities
</p>
<p>of America," published in 1839, was largely circulated in En-
</p>
<p>gland, and received the highest commendation from societies
</p>
<p>both in England and in this country. It procured for him
</p>
<p>from two colleges the degree of Doctor of Laws.
</p>
<p>While on a visit to Europe, for his health, he died in Liv-
</p>
<p>erpool, in 1865, at the age of fifty-three. He left a wife and
</p>
<p>four children  three daughters and a son. The daughters
</p>
<p>all married, and the son is now a prominent business man in

</p>
<p>William McCord.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the easy and social habits of Mr. McCord,
</p>
<p>there are but few persons outside of Morgan, and one or two
</p>
<p>counties adjacent thereto, who have any recollection of him,
</p>
<p>and no one is now living, beyond his own family, capable of
</p>
<p>defining his peculiarities. He was probably the earliest law-
</p>
<p>yer of Morgan County, though others, particularly from the
</p>
<p>Cole bar, practiced in the Morgan court before Mr. McCord's
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>He was of Scotch descent, but born, raised, and educated
</p>
<p>in Albemarle County, Virginia. He received a good English
</p>
<p>education, became an excellent mathematician, and acquired
</p>
<p>a fair knowledge of the Latin tongue.
</p>
<p>About the time of his becoming of age, and his admission
</p>
<p>to the bar, he married Miss Sally M. Field, a daughter of
</p>
<p>a wealthy planter of Albemarle County. In 1825 Mr. Mc-
</p>
<p>Cord moved into Randolph County, and located at Bev-
</p>
<p>erly. We are unable to give the year of his birth, but it
</p>
<p>must have been about 1800, for he practiced a few years
</p>
<p>in Albemarle before going to Randolph. In 1831 he again
</p>
<p>changed his residence, and located at Huntsville, in Poca-
</p>
<p>hontas County. It was during his residence at Huntsville
</p>
<p>that he obtained his largest practice. He attended the
</p>
<p>courts of several counties, including Greenbrier, Bath, and
</p>
<p>Monroe.
</p>
<p>Having a large family, still increasing, he began to think
</p>
<p>seriously of coming to the far West, and in 1836 put his
</p>
<p>purpose into execution. He crossed the Mississippi at Cape
</p>
<p>Girardeau, Missouri, and there formed a mercantile partner-
</p>
<p>ship with two old Virginia friends, Hugh F. Young and
</p>
<p>Robert Steele. The business was conducted under the firm-
</p>
<p>name of McCord, Young & Co., but proved disastrous, and
</p>
<p>Mr. McCord again turned his attention to the practice of his

</p>
<p>profession. In 1837 he moved to Versailles, in Morgan
</p>
<p>County, where he died in October, 1839. The change of
</p>
<p>residence to Versailles was probably induced by the fact that
</p>
<p>his father-in-law had in the meantime left Virginia, and set-
</p>
<p>tled in Cooper County, Missouri, about twelve miles south-
</p>
<p>west of Boonville.
</p>
<p>Mr. McCord was credited with being a good lawyer, and
</p>
<p>having a good legal mind, but was lacking in that application
</p>
<p>and diligent study so essential to eminence in the profession.
</p>
<p>He was a generous, kind-hearted man, full of life and anima-
</p>
<p>tion ; was always happy himself, and endeavored to make
</p>
<p>every one else happy about him. He took life easy, looked
</p>
<p>at the bright side of everything, and belonged to that school
</p>
<p>of philosophy which teaches " that whatever is is right."
</p>
<p>He was a strong predestinarian, never permitted himself to
</p>
<p>brood over any misfortune or disappointment, and quietly
</p>
<p>submitted to what he called " inevitable destiny." He had a
</p>
<p>large fund of good humor, delighted in anecdote and social
</p>
<p>intercourse, and sought every occasion to mingle in the
</p>
<p>society of his friends. He took a lively interest in politics,
</p>
<p>was a great admirer of Webster and Clay, but never sought
</p>
<p>office for himself. His party being in the minority in Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, he saw no hope for political preferment. He was a
</p>
<p>poor financier, and never was free from pecuniary embar-
</p>
<p>rassment. He had a high sense of honor, and despised
</p>
<p>hypocrisy and the semblance of untruth. We have spoken
</p>
<p>of his free and generous nature, which no doubt led him to
</p>
<p>contract intemperate habits. He left a wife and six children,
</p>
<p>but the only one surviving is James McCord, of the firm of

<p>Nave, McCord & Co., of St. Joseph.
</p>
<p>James W. Morrow.
</p>
<p>We knew this gentleman many years, during which time
</p>
<p>he Hved in Jefferson City, and was judge of the circuit com-
</p>
<p>posed of the counties of Cole, Cooper, Moniteau, Morgan,
</p>
<p>Miller, and, if we mistake not, Osage. He was born in Bath
</p>
<p>County, Kentucky, January lO, i8iO; was the son of Robert
</p>
<p>Morrow, and his mother was a sister of Judge Robert Trim-
</p>
<p>ble, of Paris, Kentucky. The family was of Scotch descent,
</p>
<p>and came to Kentucky at an early period.
</p>
<p>James was sent to Transylvania University, and graduated
</p>
<p>there at the age of about twenty. He then entered the
</p>
<p>office of his uncle, Judge Trimble, and with that able jurist
</p>
<p>completed his legal studies. In 1835 or 1836 he moved to
</p>
<p>Fayette, Missouri, and in 1839 married Miss Elizabeth Kyle,
</p>
<p>a daughter of David Kyle, a merchant in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>Mr. Morrow was not at the bar long enough to obtain dis-
</p>
<p>tinction in his profession, for he was soon appointed judge of
</p>
<p>the Cole Circuit, which position he must have held till his
</p>
<p>death. He made a good judge, and gave general satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion. He was a very prepossessing man in appearance,
</p>
<p>being not only strikingly handsome, but agreeable and gen-
</p>
<p>tlemanly in his demeanor.
</p>
<p>He had a great passion for fishing, and, when not engaged
</p>
<p>with his courts, indulged in it very freely. It was a trite
</p>
<p>saying, in Jefferson City, "that when Judge Morrow couldn't
</p>
<p>catch fish in the Osage River, no one else need try." He
</p>
<p>would converse for hours upon the art and different methods
</p>
<p>of angling. He was also generous and liberal, and very
</p>
<p>courteous to attorneys in his court, particularly those just
</p>
<p>commencing the practice.
</p>
<p>Judge Morrow died at Harrodsburg, Kentucky, August
</p>
<p>16, 1858, in his forty-ninth year. His widow and two

<p>The judge had a rich fund of humor, deh'ghted in anec-
</p>
<p>dote, and the lawyers who practiced before him credit him
</p>
<p>with many exhibitions of genuine wit and repartee. He pre-
</p>
<p>sided over his courts with great ease, and free from that au-
</p>
<p>stere and rigid demeanor that often characterizes our 7iisi-
</p>
<p>prius judges.

<p>David Todd.
</p>
<p>Few of the early judges of Missouri were better known
</p>
<p>than David Todd, who for many years presided over the most
</p>
<p>important circuit in the state. He was the oldest son and
</p>
<p>child of General Levi Todd, who was of Irish descent. His
</p>
<p>mother was a Briggs, and niece of General Benjamin Logan.
</p>
<p>The grandfather of David Todd was a native of Pennsylvania,
</p>
<p>and among the earliest pioneers to Kentucky, and partici-
</p>
<p>pated in most of the Indian fights. He was a lawyer by pro-
</p>
<p>fession, and for many years clerk of the Circuit Court of
</p>
<p>Fayette County.
</p>
<p>David Todd received a liberal education, was well versed
</p>
<p>in Greek and Latin, and had some knowledge of French and
</p>
<p>Spanish. He was educated at the Transylvania University,
</p>
<p>in Lexington, but whether or not he graduated we are un-
</p>
<p>able to state. He pursued his legal studies in the office of
</p>
<p>Judge Bibb, of Lexington, one of the most distinguished jur-
</p>
<p>ists of the West, and was admitted to the bar of Kentucky in
</p>

</p>
<p>in Lexington, and joined the army under General Harrison.
</p>
<p>He participated in the battle of the Thames, and other en-

<p>gagements, and earned the reputation of a brave and chival-

<p>390 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>He presided at the first court that was held in Cole County,
</p>
<p>on January 5, 1821. It was at the house of John English.
</p>
<p>Lawyers in attendance : Gamble, Hayden, Leonard, Tomp-
</p>
<p>kins, Carr, and Brickey. Gamble was circuit attorney.
</p>
<p>In 1 8 10 Judge Todd married Eliza Barr, daughter of a
</p>
<p>wealthy merchant of Lexington, Kentucky, by the name of
</p>
<p>Robert Barr. (3f this marriage there were ten children,
</p>
<p>eight of whom, two sons and six daughters, survived him.
</p>
<p>After a long and successful professional career, he died in
</p>
<p>1859, in Columbia, Boone County, which had been his place
</p>
<p>of residence for nearly thirty years.
</p>
<p>We never had the pleasure of meeting Judge Todd, but
</p>
<p>have always understood that he was a fine-looking man,
</p>
<p>about five feet ten inches in height, well built, and of a strong,
</p>
<p>robust constitution. He had a very intellectual countenance ;
</p>
<p>his forehead was high and broad, his eyes black, and his hair
</p>
<p>black and curling. He was much admired by the ladies;
</p>
<p>for, in addition to his manly beauty, he had fine conversa-
</p>
<p>tional powers and was graceful and easy in his manners.
</p>
<p>The reader is referred to an amusing anecdote of him in
</p>
<p>reference to the "buxom widow," related in the sketch of
</p>
<p>Peyton R. Hayden.
</p>
<p>His mind was a store-house of information, for he never
</p>
<p>forgot anything he read, whether in law, literature, or sci-
</p>
<p>ence. He was by no means a brilliant man, yet he possessed
</p>
<p>a vigorous, well-balanced mind, and had a very clear compre-
</p>
<p>hension of the principles of the law. In his* disposition he
</p>
<p>was social and cheerful, and at his home in Columbia dis-
</p>
<p>pensed the most liberal hospitality. He was, moreover, a
</p>
<p>man of kind heart and tender feelings, as the following inci-
</p>
<p>dent related to us by his son well illustrates :
</p>
<p>" One day," said his son, " I was traveling in Texas, and
</p>
<p>stopped for dinner at a large farm-house. As I dismounted,
</p>
<p>a venerable-looking gentleman came out to receive me. We

</p>
<p>soon fell into conversation, during which I casually men-
</p>
<p>tioned my name, when with some emotion he remarked that
</p>
<p>the best friend he ever had was of the same name  ' Todd 
</p>
<p>Judge David Todd.' I told him that that was the name of my
</p>
<p>father. He seemed greatly excited  got up, and shook me
</p>
<p>DAVID TODD. 391
</p>
<p>cordially by the hand, and remarked that he was tried before
</p>
<p>my father for murder, and was indebted to him for his hfe.
</p>
<p>He then proceeded to relate the circumstances, as follows :
</p>
<p>He said that some forty years before he was residing in Mis-
</p>
<p>souri ; that he attended a public gathering of the people in
</p>
<p>his neighborhood ; that he was challenged by several young
</p>
<p>men to wrestle, and on every occasion was successful ; that
</p>
<p>a general row took place, resulting in a murderous attack
</p>
<p>upon him ; that in repelling the assault he struck one of them
</p>
<p>with a club, producing his death ; that he was arrested, and
</p>
<p>indicted upon the charge of murder, and tried before my
</p>
<p>father; that the trial produced intense excitement, his friends
</p>
<p>and enemies being present in full force. After the jury ren-
</p>
<p>dered a verdict of acquittal the court adjourned. All was
</p>
<p>tumult and excitement. In the midst of it the sheriff tapped
</p>
<p>him on the shoulder, and whispered to him to slip away qui-
</p>
<p>etly from the crowd, and go to the judge's room in the hotel,
</p>
<p>as the judge wanted to see him immediately. He obeyed
</p>
<p>the summons, and found the judge in his room. That the
</p>
<p>judge told him he had sent for him to let him know that his
</p>
<p>life was in imminent danger, that a plot was on hand to kill
</p>
<p>him, and that daylight must not find him in the county. He
</p>
<p>told the judge that he had a horse, but very little money, and
</p>
<p>was poorly prepared to start on a long journey. Said he,
</p>
<p>' Your father took out his pocket-book, and handed me all
</p>
<p>the money in it. He also gave me a paper upon which was
</p>
<p>marked the route to Louisiana, and a letter of introduction
</p>
<p>to his (the judge's) brother, in the parish of St. Landry.'
</p>
<p>Said he, ' I left that night, followed your father's instructions,
</p>
<p>and have never been in Missouri since.' Here the old man's
</p>
<p>utterance failed, and, still holding me with a firm grasp, he
</p>
<p>wept like a child."
</p>
<p>Many other instances of Judge Todd's benevolence are
</p>
<p>related by the old inhabitants of central Missouri, but this

<p>must suffice.
</p>
<p>He was an impartial, upright, and conscientious judge.
</p>
<p>At the time of his death he had reached his seventy-third
</p>
<p>year. One of his sons is a prominent lawyer in Bastrop,
</p>
<p>Louisiana.
</p>
<p>Sam Caruthers.
</p>
<p>Were we to give the full scriptural name of this gentle-
</p>
<p>man, his friends would scarcely recognize him, for he was
</p>
<p>known by no other Christian name than " Sam." He was a
</p>
<p>native Missourian, born in Madison County, October 13, 1820,
</p>
<p>and educated at the Cumberland University, Lebanon, Ten-
</p>
<p>nessee. He was the oldest son of David Looney Caruthers,
</p>
<p>a farmer of more than ordinary intelligence, who brought
</p>
<p>his sons up to work on his farm until it became necessary to
</p>
<p>send them away to be educated. Sam, at an early period,
</p>
<p>expressed a desire to follow the profession of the law, and
</p>
<p>he commenced its study in Tennessee with his uncle, Robert
</p>
<p>L. Caruthers, who had some connection with the above-men-
</p>
<p>tioned university. As soon as he completed his studies he
</p>
<p>was admitted to the bar, and commenced the practice in his
</p>
<p>native county of Madison.
</p>
<p>In 1849 he married Miss Sophronia Smith, of Greenville,
</p>
<p>Wayne County, by whom he had two children, a son and
</p>
<p>daughter, the former following the profession of his father,
</p>
<p>and now practicing in the city of New Orleans.
</p>
<p>We remember Sam Caruthers as a whole-souled, genial,
</p>
<p>and companionable man, who made friends wherever he
</p>
<p>went. There was nothing in him sordid or selfish, and he
</p>
<p>was ever ready to lend a helping hand to all who applied to
</p>
<p>him. Had he devoted himself to his profession he would
</p>
<p>undoubtedly have made a successful lawyer; but his fond-
</p>
<p>ness for public life led him into a different channel. He
</p>
<p>soon embarked in politics, and in 1853 was elected to Con-
</p>
<p>gress from the South-eastern District, which he continued to
</p>
<p>represent till 1849.
</p>
<p>He died at Cape Girardeau, July 20, i860, in his fortieth
</p>
<p>year.

<p>He had a fine voice, was ready and fluent, told a good anec-

<p>The lower part of his district is a low, swampy country, and

<p>One cause of his popularity was his fine memory with re-

</p>
<p>politician, this rare gift is invaluable.
</p>
<p>Francis P. Blair, Jr.
</p>
<p>The Blair family are of Scotch descent. Frank's paternal
</p>
<p>grandfather, James Blair, was a lawyer in Virginia, and early
</p>
<p>moved into Kentucky, and became attorney-general of that
</p>
<p>state. He was a man of considerable ability. Frank was
</p>
<p>born in or near Lexington, Kentucky, February 19, 1821,
</p>
<p>and when about ten years of age removed with his parents
</p>
<p>to Washington City. His father, Francis P. Blair, Sr., who
</p>
<p>recently died at a very advanced age, was one of the strong-
</p>
<p>est political writers in the country. During the early part of
</p>
<p>President Jackson's administration some able articles from
</p>
<p>his pen appeared in one of the Lexington papers, and at-
</p>
<p>tracted the attention of General Jackson, who invited him to
</p>
<p>take charge of his administration organ at Washington City.
</p>
<p>It was there that the author, who was then twelve years of
</p>
<p>age, made the acquaintance of Frank, who was about ten.
</p>
<p>They were school-mates in a select school kept by a gentle-
</p>
<p>man by the name of Smith, an accomplished scholar and a
</p>
<p>graduate of Yale. He afterwards became an eminent law-
</p>
<p>yer at Louisville. Among his pupils were Frank and James
</p>
<p>Blair, Martin and Smith Van Buren, sons of President Van
</p>
<p>Buren, General Mansfield Lovell, who during the late war
</p>
<p>commanded the Confederate forces at New Orleans, James
</p>
<p>Colegate, Nat Coursine, and John Barclay, author of a late
</p>
<p>work on parliamentary law. Mr. Smith was a strict disciplin-
</p>
<p>arian, and often said Frank gave him more trouble than all
</p>
<p>the other scholars combined; not that he was deficient in
</p>
<p>his studies, but he was prone to mischief, and often disposed
</p>
<p>to forget the rules of the school. Frank, as we always called
</p>
<p>him, was a great favorite with the boys, and excelled nearly
</p>
<p>all in athletic exercises. He stood well in his class, and yet
</p>
<p>out of school was rarely seen with a book in his hands.

</p>
<p>He learned rapidly and with ease, which enabled him to
</p>
<p>FRANCIS P. BLAIR, JR. 395
</p>
<p>spend much of his time in outdoor sports. He had a nick-
</p>
<p>name for every boy, and his faciUty for making it stick never
</p>
<p>deserted him in after-life. Who does not recollect " Old
</p>
<p>Sawbones," the name he gave to that able and eccentric
</p>
<p>surgeon, Dr. Joseph McDowell, the Native-American ora-
</p>
<p>tor? After leaving Smith's school we returned to New
</p>
<p>York, and Frank entered Princeton College, where he com-
</p>
<p>pleted his education. He commenced his legal studies
</p>
<p>with Lewis Marshall, and finished at the Trans}'lvania Law
</p>
<p>School, and was admitted to the bar in his native town of
</p>
<p>Lexington.
</p>
<p>He made no effort to practice in Kentucky, but soon after
</p>
<p>his admission removed to St. Louis, and entered into part-
</p>
<p>nership with his brother, the Hon. Montgomery Blair. Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Blair always manifested a strong proclivity for the army,
</p>
<p>and upon the breaking-out of the Mexican War, being then
</p>
<p>on a visit to New Mexico for his health, volunteered as a
</p>
<p>private. He was a soldier in war, and a citizen in peace 
</p>
<p>alternating as he saw an opportunity to serve his country.
</p>
<p>His legislative career commenced in the General Assembly
</p>
<p>of Missouri, where he served several terms as a representa-
</p>
<p>tive from St. Louis County, and was not only the accredited
</p>
<p>leader of his party in that body, but gave strong indications
</p>
<p>of future distinction as a statesman. He was a member of
</p>
<p>the House of Representatives at Washington, in the Thirty-
</p>
<p>fifth and Thirty-seventh Congress, and was recognized as
</p>
<p>one of the ablest men of that body.
</p>
<p>The most eventful period of his life, however, was at the
</p>
<p>commencement of, and immediately preceding, the civil war.
</p>
<p>Though born and reared in a slave state, he became at an
</p>
<p>early period a Freesoiler, and supported Mr. Van Buren,
</p>
<p>when lie ran for the presidency upon the Freesoil ticket.
</p>
<p>His views on that subject did not proceed from prejudice
</p>
<p>against the institution of slavery, but from a firm conviction

<p>that in Missouri, particularly, it was a stumbling-block to
</p>
<p>immigration, state progress, and public improvement. He
</p>
<p>saw in his adopted state all the elements of a great common-
</p>
<p>wealth, with her resources undeveloped for want of capital

<p>39^ BENCH AND BAR OF MISSUUKI.
</p>
<p>and labor, and boldly proclaimed that neither could ever
</p>
<p>obtain until slavery was blotted out of her fundamental law.
</p>
<p>Immediately preceding the civil war an encampment,
</p>
<p>under the sanction of law, was formed near the western lim-
</p>
<p>its of St. Louis, known as Camp Jackson, and under the
</p>
<p>pretense of military discipline. General Frost, formerly of
</p>
<p>the army, was in command. General Blair, with that pro-
</p>
<p>phetic vision for which he became so noted, saw at a glance
</p>
<p>that the object of the encampment was to obtain a force in
</p>
<p>the vicinity of St. Louis sufficient to capture the United
</p>
<p>States Arsenal, in the lower part of the city, and which
</p>
<p>was well known to contain a large amount of arms and
</p>
<p>munitions of war.
</p>
<p>General Nathaniel Lyon had been placed in command of
</p>
<p>the Arsenal, and he and General Blair concurred in the opin-
</p>
<p>ion that, unless Camp Jackson was speedily captured, Mis-
</p>
<p>souri would be hurled into the Rebellion. In fact, they had
</p>
<p>evidence to satisfy them that a day had been agreed upon
</p>
<p>for the attack upon the Arsenal, and but little time was
</p>
<p>afforded for a defense.
</p>
<p>We met General Blair on Fourth Street about eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock, A. M., and he had then telegraphed the War Depart-
</p>
<p>ment for permission to raise two regiments ; received an
</p>
<p>affirmative answer about two o'clock, p. m., and that night, at
</p>
<p>Washington Hall, on Second Street, the First Regiment,
</p>
<p>composed chiefly of Germans, was organized. Most of the
</p>
<p>officers had seen service in Europe, and were well qualified
</p>
<p>to organize and drill. We remained at the hall all night, for
</p>
<p>it was expected that the attack would be made in the early
</p>
<p>part of the next day; but to the astonishment of the seces-
</p>
<p>sionists they found that the government was prepared to re-
</p>
<p>sist them, and the time for the attack was necessarily
</p>
<p>delayed. In the course of a few days, through the efficiency
</p>
<p>of General Blair, other regiments were raised and mustered

<p>into service.
</p>
<p>General Blair was tendered the appointment of brigadier-
</p>
<p>general, but declined it in behalf of Captain Lyon, whom he
</p>
<p>thought better qualified for it.

</p>
<p>The capture of Camp Jackson, which the author witnessed,
</p>
<p>with its arms and suppHes, a portion of which had just been
</p>
<p>received from the government arsenal in Louisiana, on May
</p>
<p>lO, 1 86 1, has passed into history, and without doubt it pre-
</p>
<p>vented Missouri from participating in the RebelHon.
</p>
<p>To Frank Blair, then, more than any other man dead or
</p>
<p>alive, are we indebted for the noble stand taken by Missouri
</p>
<p>in behalf of the Federal Union. It should be stated here
</p>
<p>that President Lincoln, who knew Mr. Blair very well, re-
</p>
<p>posed in him the utmost confidence, and deferred to his
</p>
<p>opinions in everything pertaining to the state.
</p>
<p>Without pretending to have had a knowledge of the secret
</p>
<p>measures adopted to counteract the efforts of the seces-
</p>
<p>sionists to place Missouri in the attitude of hostility to the
</p>
<p>government, it is an act of justice to here state that the presi-
</p>
<p>dent and secretary of war at Washington were in daily com-
</p>
<p>munication, not only with Blair and Lyon, but with such
</p>
<p>men as Glover, Broadhead, Brown, O. D. Filley, Giles F.
</p>
<p>Filley, R. J. Howard, Bart. Able, Henry Berenstine, and
</p>
<p>others, to whom we are this day indebted for the proud posi-
</p>
<p>tion which Missouri will occupy in the future history of the
</p>
<p>great Rebellion.
</p>
<p>The burning of the Osage Bridge, the flight of Governor
</p>
<p>Jackson and the Missouri Legislature, are too well known to
</p>
<p>require recapitulation here.
</p>
<p>General Blair left his seat in Congress with a commission
</p>
<p>as major-general, and joined the army of Sherman in its
</p>
<p>advance upon Vicksburg. It is well known that he led one
</p>
<p>of the most vigorous assaults upon the city, and received for
</p>
<p>his skill and gallantry a high compliment from General
</p>
<p>Grant. General Blair had command of the Second Division
</p>
<p>of Sherman's corps, and took a very active part in the siege
</p>
<p>of Vicksburg, and ultimately followed Sherman in his march
</p>
<p>to the sea.

</p>
<p>Upon the restoration of peace he resumed his seat in Con-
</p>
<p>gress, and acted with the Democratic party; and in 1868
</p>
<p>was nominated for vice-president on the ticket headed by
</p>
<p>Horatio Seymour, of New York.
</p>
<p>39^ BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>In 1871 General Blair was again elected to the State
</p>
<p>Legislature, but was soon after elected to the United States
</p>
<p>Senate, to supply the vacancy created by the resignation of
</p>
<p>Hon. Charles D. Drake, and took an active part in all the
</p>
<p>discussions of that body.
</p>
<p>He would undoubtedly have ranked high as a lawyer if he
</p>
<p>had devoted himself to his profession, for he had a brilliant
</p>
<p>mind, was an analytical thinker, and, although not an orator
</p>
<p>in the general acceptation of the term, was a fine extempo-
</p>
<p>raneous speaker, and always able to captivate the crowd.
</p>
<p>His manner was very impressive, and by way of illustration
</p>
<p>we give an instance which occurred at Allenton, in St. Louis
</p>
<p>County, during a very exciting canvass.
</p>
<p>The general, in his speech, was predicting a certain event,
</p>
<p>and a gentleman in the audience, who did not affiliate with
</p>
<p>the general, interrupted him by saying, " We shall see." The
</p>
<p>general instantly replied, " Yes, we sJiall see ; we shall see,"
</p>
<p>emphasizing the word "shall." There was nothing in the
</p>
<p>word that entitled it to any particular significance, but the
</p>
<p>manner in which he uttered and emphasized it gave it a
</p>
<p>force and power that brought a loud applause from the
</p>
<p>audience.
</p>
<p>We never knew a man less amenable to the charge of fear
</p>
<p>than General Blair. We have seen him tried under circum-
</p>
<p>stances well calculated to unnerve the stoutest heart. Upon
</p>
<p>one occasion, when it was almost death for a public man to
</p>
<p>avow himself as opposed to the institution of slavery, he
</p>
<p>made an appointment to address the people of Iron County
</p>
<p>at Ironton, and it was proclaimed in advance that if he at-
</p>
<p>tempted it he would be mobbed. At his request we accom-
</p>
<p>panied him, and on reaching Ironton learned that an armed
</p>
<p>crowd had assembled in the court-house to resist him.
</p>
<p>When he rose to address the meeting, the few friends he had
</p>
<p>there became greatly alarmed for his safety; but their fears

<p>were soon dissipated when they saw how calm and collected
</p>
<p>he was, and heard him boldly declare that any man who
</p>
<p>came to the meeting armed, with the intention to use vio-
</p>
<p>lence against him, was too great a coward to attempt it.
</p>
<p>FRANCIS P. BLAIR, JR. 399
</p>
<p>He spoke nearly two hours without any interruption, and on
</p>
<p>leaving the stand received the congratulations of many who
</p>
<p>differed with him upon the slavery question.
</p>
<p>Upon another occasion, during an exciting election in St.
</p>
<p>Louis, when almost the entire Irish population were much
</p>
<p>enraged against him, he requested us to accompany him to
</p>
<p>the Biddle-Market polls ; and as we approached the polls
</p>
<p>our buggy was completely surrounded by men maddened
</p>
<p>with liquor, who threatened his life. Several policemen
</p>
<p>requested us to take him away, as his life was in danger, for
</p>
<p>a dozen pistols had been drawn, and some pointed directly
</p>
<p>at him. But he refused to stir a step, and openly proclaimed
</p>
<p>them a d  d set of cowards. But the police forced us
</p>
<p>away, and Mr. Blair left as composed as though he had been
</p>
<p>attending a love-feast.
</p>
<p>He delivered addresses against slavery in almost every
</p>
<p>part of the state, and, with the exception of a few rotten eggs
</p>
<p>that were hurled upon him at night, he never met with any
</p>
<p>positive resistance.
</p>
<p>This apparent recklessness some would regarc;J as a military
</p>
<p>disqualification, but we have been frequently told by officers
</p>
<p>who served in his corps that he never went into battle with-
</p>
<p>out ample preparation, and consulted freely with his subor-
</p>
<p>dinate officers before taking any important step. He was
</p>
<p>brave, but not impetuous.
</p>
<p>Though he never enjoyed the advantages of a military
</p>
<p>education, there were few better soldiers in the army. Both
</p>
<p>Grant and Sherman had an exalted opinion of his military
</p>
<p>services, and upon several occasions alluded in the most
</p>
<p>complimentary terms to his military genius. Sherman thus
</p>
<p>spoke of him :
</p>
<p>" I always had a most exalted regard for Frank Blair. I always regarded
</p>
<p>him as one of the truest patriots, mast honest and honorable of men, and one
</p>
<p>of the most courageous soldiers this country ever produced. I never lost sight

<p>of the services he rendered the country in the outbreak of the war ; and I fully
</p>
<p>concede, and always have conceded, that to his boldness, promptitude, and firm-
</p>
<p>ness, more than to anything else, the country is indebted for the preservation of
</p>
<p>St. Louis as a strategic point, and for the salvation of Missouri from secession.
</p>
<p>He was a noble, generous, honest, brave, frank, sincere, and unselfish man."
</p>
<p>400 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>General Blair was born a politician, and in hiin were com-
</p>
<p>bined more of the elements of political success than any pub-
</p>
<p>lic man we ever met, not even excepting Stephen A. Doug-
</p>
<p>las. His knowledge of men was very great, and his retentive
</p>
<p>memory enabled him to recollect the names of persons with
</p>
<p>whom he had but a slight acquaintance. Nothing is more
</p>
<p>gratifying to our pride than to be thus recognized. It was a
</p>
<p>faculty that Mr. Van Buren enjoyed above all other public
</p>
<p>men of his day. It is said that if he met a person in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington to whom he had been introduced years before, he
</p>
<p>could readily call his name. This was one of the secrets of
</p>
<p>his personal poj)ularity.
</p>
<p>Though General Blair was an ardent and very decided party
</p>
<p>man, he had no personal enemies among his opponents.
</p>
<p>Often have we seen him on the day of an exciting election
</p>
<p>walking arm in arm with one whom he had probably the
</p>
<p>night before delivered a vindictive speech against. The cor-
</p>
<p>dial and free manner with which he greeted all men closed
</p>
<p>their hearts against anything like rancor or ill-will.
</p>
<p>Another peculiarity of him was that he would accept a
</p>
<p>defeat as an inevitable necessity, and only seemed to regret
</p>
<p>it because of its effect upon his political friends. He adopted
</p>
<p>the motto of Mr. Clay : ''Pick the flint, and try it againy
</p>
<p>General Blair was a whole-souled, generous man, without a
</p>
<p>selfish hair in his head, and kept himself poor in his efforts
</p>
<p>to aid and assist his friends. No better evidence of his spot-
</p>
<p>less integrity can be found than in the fact that although he
</p>
<p>had it in his power to amass wealth, he died without a cent ;
</p>
<p>in that respect imitating Colonel Benton, who always con-
</p>
<p>tended that no public man could become rich in office with-
</p>
<p>out a stain upon his integrity.
</p>
<p>General Blair was not a man who could strike an enemy
</p>
<p>after he was down ; nor did he ever entertain a feeling of
</p>
<p>resentment against those whom he had met in battle. Im-

<p>mediately after the war he took strong ground in favor of
</p>
<p>restoring the South to all the privileges they enjoyed before
</p>
<p>the Rebellion, and was opposed to sending carpet-baggers
</p>
<p>among them, or imposing upon them any arbitrary restric-
</p>
<p>FRANCIS P. BLAIR, JR. 4OI
</p>
<p>tions. He believed that the only way to restore harmony
</p>
<p>and good feeling was to extend to them the hand of fellow-
</p>
<p>ship, and persuade them that their interest was in the Union,
</p>
<p>and not out of it. In other words, he was for burying the
</p>
<p>hatchet, and forgetting the past.
</p>
<p>That they fully appreciated his kind feeling for them is evi-
</p>
<p>dent from the following resolution adopted at a meeting of
</p>
<p>ex-Confederates in St. Louis, shortly after his death :
</p>
<p>'^Resolved, That we, the ex-Confederates here assembled, do as deeply
</p>
<p>mourn his loss, and as heartily acknowledge his high character and great abili-
</p>
<p>ties, as can those who never differed from him in the past great struggle. As
</p>
<p>soldiers who fought against the cause he espoused, we honor and respect the
</p>
<p>fidelity, high courage, and energy he brought to his aid ; as citizens of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, we recognize the signal service done his state as one of her senators in
</p>
<p>the National Council; as Americans, we are proud of his manhood; and as
</p>
<p>men, we deplore the loss from among us of one in whom was embodied so
</p>
<p>much of honor, generosity, and gentleness. And we remember with gratitude
</p>
<p>that, so soon as the late civil strife was ended, he was among the first to prove
</p>
<p>the honesty of his course by welcoming us back as citizens of the Union he
</p>
<p>had fought to maintain; and that he never thereafter ceased to battle for the
</p>
<p>restoration and maintenance of our rights under the Constitution."
</p>
<p>He died in St. Louis, on July 1 1, 1875, in his fifty-fifth
</p>
<p>year, and his body was placed in Bellefontaine Cemetery.
</p>
<p>He married, in 1847, Miss Appoline Alexander, of Wood-
</p>
<p>ford County, Kentucky, who, with eight children  five sons
</p>
<p>and three daughters  survives him.
</p>
<p>On the day of his funeral the city of St. Louis was clothed
</p>
<p>in the emblems of mourning, and it was evident to a stran-
</p>
<p>ger on the streets that a great man had fallen. The bar, and
</p>
<p>divers societies, by suitable resolutions expressed their sense
</p>
<p>of the loss sustained in his death. The flags of fifty vessels
</p>
<p>in the harbor were trailing at half-mast, and every possible
</p>
<p>demonstration was made indicative of the public grief.

<p>William H. Russell.
</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable men of early times was the
</p>
<p>person whose name is at the head of this memoir, and who
</p>
<p>spent most of his professional life in Fulton, Callaway
</p>
<p>County, Missouri. His entire life was one of excitement,
</p>
<p>daring, and adventure, and in the hands of a ready, imag-
</p>
<p>inative writer would furnish ample material for a good-sized
</p>
<p>volume of romance.
</p>
<p>We made his acquaintance in Jefferson City, in 1842, but
</p>
<p>saw little of him afterwards, as he frequently changed his
</p>
<p>residence, and was constantly starting out upon some bold
</p>
<p>adventure.
</p>
<p>He was born in Fayette County, Kentucky, April 21,
</p>
<p>1805, and was educated at the Transylvania University of
</p>
<p>that state, passing with credit through both the academic
</p>
<p>and law departments. Shortly after obtaining a license to
</p>
<p>practice, he was elected to represent Nicholson County in
</p>
<p>the lower branch of the Kentucky Legislature. About this
</p>
<p>time an incident occurred which caused a warm personal
</p>
<p>friendship to spring up between him and Kentucky's great
</p>
<p>statesman, Henry Clay  a friendship of the most devoted
</p>
<p>kind, which continued up to the time of Mr. Clay's death.
</p>
<p>Mr. Clay was for the first time a candidate for the United
</p>
<p>States Senate, and after a very heated contest was elected
</p>
<p>by one vote, and that vote was given by Mr. Russell, the
</p>
<p>youngest member of the body. Mr. Clay's gratitude to him
</p>
<p>was unbounded, and manifested itself in personal attentions;
</p>
<p>and whatever may be said of Mr. Clay in other respects, he
</p>
<p>never deserted a friend, or failed to admit his obligations to
</p>
<p>those who stood by him in his political struggles. As may
</p>
<p>be supposed, they corresponded through life, and had Mr.
</p>
<p>Clay reached the presidency, Mr. Russell w^ould have been

</p>
<p>the recipient of his highest favor. Mr. Russell would never
</p>
<p>JVTLLIAM H. RUSSELL. 4O3
</p>
<p>permit Mr. Clay's name to be mentioned in his presence in
</p>
<p>terms of reproach without taking up his cause and making
</p>
<p>it a personal matter, for his admiration of the great Ken-
</p>
<p>tuckian amounted almost to idolatry.
</p>
<p>In 1834 Colonel Russell removed to Missouri and settled
</p>
<p>in Fulton, where he opened a law-office and entered upon
</p>
<p>the practice, soon obtaining a prominent position at the bar.
</p>
<p>He was a man of fine conversational powers ; free, easy,
</p>
<p>and prepossessing in his address ; and as a speaker, graceful,
</p>
<p>fluent, and persuasive  in fact, he carried his point before a
</p>
<p>jury more by his adroit persuasiveness than the force of
</p>
<p>reasoning. He had a good knowledge of men, and well
</p>
<p>knew that logic was not always the best weapon to use be-
</p>
<p>fore a jury, and hence he so shaped his address as he
</p>
<p>thought would best accomplish his aim.
</p>
<p>Law as a science was not altogether suited to his tastes,
</p>
<p>for he was too restless and impatient to devote much time
</p>
<p>to the investigation of abstruse and intricate legal problems.
</p>
<p>He was fond of the excitement of a jury trial, and if asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with other counsel, would leave them to settle before
</p>
<p>the court the questions of law.
</p>
<p>He had a great fondness for political controversy, and, al-
</p>
<p>though his party was always in the minority, never failed to
</p>
<p>enlist in any canvass, and spend his time and money freely
</p>
<p>in behalf of his political friends. He was an excellent
</p>
<p>stump-speaker, and when Mr. Clay was a candidate for the
</p>
<p>presidency, in 1844, canvassed nearly the whole of northern
</p>
<p>Missouri in his behalf.
</p>
<p>In 1838 Mr. Russell was elected from Callaway County to
</p>
<p>the popular branch of our State Legislature, and by reason of
</p>
<p>his ability, and knowledge of parliamentary law obtained in
</p>
<p>the Kentucky Legislature, soon became a recognized leader
</p>
<p>of his party. He took an active part in the debates, and by
</p>
<p>his popular manners secured the good-will of the opposition

<p>members.
</p>
<p>Colonel Russell obtained his military title through services
</p>
<p>rendered in the Florida War. He was captain of a company
</p>
<p>in Colonel Gentry's regiment, raised in Callaway and the
</p>
<p>404 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOUKf.
</p>
<p>adjoining counties, and in the battle of Ochechobe proved
</p>
<p>himself a brave and gallant soldier. It is well known that
</p>
<p>his regiment was placed in advance, and met the first shock
</p>
<p>of the battle with great loss of life. The people of our state
</p>
<p>thought that General Taylor, in his report of the engage-
</p>
<p>ment, did not do justice to our gallant boys, and made it the
</p>
<p>subject of legislative action.
</p>
<p>An incident connected with that battle was related to us
</p>
<p>by one of the officers of the regiment. While they were
</p>
<p>recruiting at Fulton, a large, tall, rawboned fellow of the age
</p>
<p>of about twenty-two, who had been kicked and cuffed about
</p>
<p>the town by all the boys, and whose exhibitions of cowardice
</p>
<p>had attracted much attention, asked permission of Gentry to
</p>
<p>join his regiment, stating that he was treated so badly in
</p>
<p>Fulton that he wished to leave the town. The colonel told
</p>
<p>him that he had no use for such a cowardly fellow ; but he
</p>
<p>begged so hard that the colonel, out of pure compassion,
</p>
<p>promised to take him as a teamster. Just before the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the battle he asked permission to go into the
</p>
<p>fight ; and towards the close of the battle was seen, up to his
</p>
<p>waist in water (the ground being a deep swamp), fighting like
</p>
<p>a hero, with seven dead Indians around him, all of whom he
</p>
<p>had killed in a hand-to-hand fight. We leave the reader to
</p>
<p>determine what mysterious power could have so suddenly
</p>
<p>transformed the coward into the hero.
</p>
<p>In 1840 Colonel Russell was a member of the Whig
</p>
<p>National Convention that nominated General Harrison for
</p>
<p>the presidency, and in the same year was appointed one of
</p>
<p>the visitors to the Military Academy at West Point. Under
</p>
<p>General Harrison's administration he was appointed marshal
</p>
<p>of Missouri, and discharged the duties of the office faithfully
</p>
<p>and efficiently; but, for some reason unknown to us, resigned
</p>
<p>a short time before the expiration of his term.
</p>
<p>We have alluded to Colonel Russell's restless spirit of

<p>adventure. It caused him, in 1846, to lead a party of emi-
</p>
<p>grants across the plains to the territory of California, which
</p>
<p>was then an une.xplored wilderness. It was the second expe-
</p>
<p>dition to the Pacific slope, Fremont's having preceded it.
</p>
<p>WILLIAM H. RUSSELL. 405
</p>
<p>To have been made a leader of such an expedition at that
</p>
<p>day, after the sufferings and privations of the Fremont party,
</p>
<p>was no slight compliment. Governor Boggs and family were
</p>
<p>with him, and also the noted Donner family, every member of
</p>
<p>which perished from starvation and cold in the fastnesses of
</p>
<p>the Sierra Nevada Mountains. But the intrepid spirit of Rus-
</p>
<p>sell brought the greater part of the company safely through.
</p>
<p>The bodies of the Donner family were found near a small
</p>
<p>lake, which has since borne the family name, and upon the
</p>
<p>shore of which we stood, in 1873, and with a sad heart
</p>
<p>recalled the sufferings of that noble band of pioneers. The
</p>
<p>lake is not far from that part of the mountain summit which
</p>
<p>is now crossed by rail.
</p>
<p>Upon tlie organization of the provisional government of
</p>
<p>California, Colonel Russell was made secretary of state, and
</p>
<p>continued in that position as long as General Fremont was
</p>
<p>at the head of the territorial government. Upon retiring
</p>
<p>from the office of secretary of state he was made collector
</p>
<p>of the port at Monterey, which office he held for some time,
</p>
<p>and then returned to the practice of his profession.
</p>
<p>He had left his family in Missouri, and in 1852 returned
</p>
<p>to them and took up his residence at Independence, Jack-
</p>
<p>son County, where he remained two years, and then removed
</p>
<p>to Kansas, and was there during the turbulent times that
</p>
<p>preceded her admission into the Union. Though a pro-
</p>
<p>slavery man, he refused to identify himself with that ele-
</p>
<p>ment known as the "Border Ruffians," nor would he give
</p>
<p>any aid or comfort to the Abolitionists headed by Lane. He
</p>
<p>took conservative ground, and in that respect followed the
</p>
<p>footsteps of his illustrious friend, Mr. Clay. He advocated
</p>
<p>the supremacy of law and order, and held that the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion was broad enough to heal all existing grievances ; and
</p>
<p>that it was the duty of the patriot in such a crisis to stand by
</p>
<p>his government, and endeavor to avert the storm that threat-

</p>
<p>ened the entire country. His whole course was marked by
</p>
<p>the highest patriotism, and a full sense of his obligations to
</p>
<p>a government which he characterized as the best on earth.
</p>
<p>While in Kansas he became a candidate for Congress on the
</p>
<p>406 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Native-American, or Know-Nothing, ticket, but was defeated.
</p>
<p>The excitement in the state was too intense to admit of the
</p>
<p>success of any intermediate party.
</p>
<p>Shortly after the breaking-out of the RebelHon he left
</p>
<p>Kansas for Washington City, and Mr. Lincoln, who was his
</p>
<p>old acquaintance and friend in Kentucky, appointed him, in
</p>
<p>1862, consul to Trinidad, Cuba, which position he held till
</p>
<p>the close of the war. He then returned to Washington
</p>
<p>City, and practiced law there up to the time of his death,
</p>
<p>which took place in December, 1872, when in the sixty-
</p>
<p>seventh year of his age.
</p>
<p>Colonel Russell was as brave as a lion, and, when not
</p>
<p>aroused, as mild and as easily led as a child. He was also a
</p>
<p>man of generous impulses, charitable to a fault, indulgent to
</p>
<p>his friends, and for their sake would part with the last dollar
</p>
<p>he had. His heart was too large and broad, and his dispo-
</p>
<p>sition too forgiving, to harbor a feeling of resentment or
</p>
<p>revenge; hence he had but few enemies. He left a large
</p>
<p>family of children, and gave each of them a good education,
</p>
<p>the advantages of which he fully appreciated. His remains

<p>repose in the cemetery at Georgetown, District of Columbia.
</p>
<p>ROBERT G. Smart
</p>
<p>Was born in Montgomery County, Kentucky, in 1819, and
</p>
<p>came with his father to Missouri in 1828. Young Smart re-
</p>
<p>ceived only a common-school education, though he became
</p>
<p>a good English scholar. Before his majority he entered the
</p>
<p>law-office of Hon. John Jameison, in Fulton, and in due time
</p>
<p>was admitted to the practice, and soon after settled in Inde-
</p>
<p>pendence, Jackson County, where he remained in the prac-
</p>
<p>tice of his profession until his tragic death, which occurred
</p>
<p>in 1862.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smart was a fair lawyer, devoted to the interests of his
</p>
<p>clients, and generally successful  because he studied his
</p>
<p>cases thoroughly, and was never caught unprepared. He
</p>
<p>was honest and upright, and the utmost confidence was re-
</p>
<p>posed in his integrity ; and his legal opinions were highly
</p>
<p>valued by his legal brethren.
</p>
<p>In 1842 he was elected by the people of Jackson County
</p>
<p>to represent them in the State Legislature. In 1843 he re-
</p>
<p>ceived from the hands of Governor Reynolds the appoint-
</p>
<p>ment of circuit attorney for his circuit, to serve out an unex-
</p>
<p>pired term, and in 1844 was elected by the people to the
</p>
<p>same office. In 1859 he was elected judge of the Circuit
</p>
<p>Court for the then Sixth Circuit, but, failing to take the oath
</p>
<p>of fealty, was deprived of his office.
</p>
<p>The year before his death, home guards were organized
</p>
<p>throughout the state, and, never having been under military
</p>
<p>subordination, committed many acts of unnecessary violence.
</p>
<p>That Judge Smart sympathized with the South, and in fact
</p>
<p>was a secessionist, was undoubtedly true ; but that he ever
</p>
<p>committed an overt act of treason against the government
</p>
<p>was always denied by his friends. Born in a slave state, and
</p>
<p>never having lived in any but a slave state, it is not strange

</p>
<p>But the home guards undertook to arrest him at his resi-
</p>
<p>dence. Believing that they would take his life, he made
</p>
<p>an effort to escape by crossing a small field, and, as he was
</p>
<p>getting over the fence, was shot down. It was a cruel and
</p>
<p>cold-blooded murder. We were among the strongest advo-
</p>
<p>cates of the Union, but never sanctioned the many dastardly
</p>
<p>acts that were committed in its name. But the state was
</p>
<p>under martial law, and scenes of blood and violence were of
</p>

</p>
<p>This gentleman, who filled the highest offices within the
</p>
<p>gift of the people of Missouri, was born in Delaware in i8ii,
</p>
<p>and in 1831 graduated at Yale College, an institution which
</p>
<p>has sent out more able men and statesmen than any other
</p>
<p>college in the countr\'. It cannot be said of Yale as Dean
</p>
<p>Swift said of a certain university in his own country. Upon
</p>
<p>being asked if it was a very learned place, he replied it was,
</p>
<p>and gave as a reason, "that most persons took some learning
</p>
<p>there, and but few brought any away."
</p>
<p>Our first acquaintance with Governor Polk dates as far
</p>
<p>back as the fall of 1836, and we knew him intimately from
</p>
<p>that time until his death.
</p>
<p>His father, who was a highly respectable farmer, married
</p>
<p>a Miss Causey, an excellent lady, who brought up her son in
</p>
<p>the belief that virtue and rectitude were the only paths that
</p>
<p>led to happiness in this world.
</p>
<p>Mr. Polk studied law at the law school connected with
</p>
<p>Yale, but had previously read one year in the office of James
</p>
<p>Rogers, who at that time was attorney-general of Delaware.
</p>
<p>In 1835 he came West, and located, in the practice of his
</p>
<p>profession, in St. Louis, and by his exemplary habits and
</p>
<p>close attention to business soon acquired a fair practice.
</p>
<p>When not in court he was always to be found in his office,
</p>
<p>having no inclination to indulge in frivolous amusements.
</p>
<p>We never regarded Governor Polk as a brilliant man, but,
</p>
<p>though less profound than Gamble, Geyer, Leonard, Field,
</p>
<p>and a few others who could be named, he was nevertheless a
</p>
<p>sound lawyer and successful practitioner. He matured early,
</p>
<p>reaching the zenith of his professional power when at thirty
</p>
<p>or thirty-five years of age. He certainly improved but little
</p>
<p>after that, and in our judgment Mr. Polk at fifty-five was not

</p>
<p>equal to Mr. Polk at thirty-five.
</p>
<p>41 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>His forte as a speaker was in close, logical reasoning,
</p>
<p>never attempting a display at mere declamation or elocution.
</p>
<p>Though possessed of little fancy and less imagination, he had
</p>
<p>what was of far more value  good practical common sense,
</p>
<p>which served him well in all the relations of life. Among
</p>
<p>other elements of success, he had a happy faculty of analyz-
</p>
<p>ing the facts of a case, and so applying them as to maintain
</p>
<p>any theory which he might advance.
</p>
<p>As a jury lawyer he was strong and forcible ; for, in addi-
</p>
<p>tion to the qualities already mentioned, he had a manner
</p>
<p>which denoted the utmost candor and sincerity, and always
</p>
<p>carried with him into the jury-box a well-deserved reputation
</p>
<p>for integrity and honesty of purpose.
</p>
<p>One peculiarity of Mr. Polk was that he never indulged in
</p>
<p>the personal abuse of witnesses; in fact, we are unable to
</p>
<p>recall a single instance in which he ever charged a witness
</p>
<p>with false swearing. If satisfied that the witness was not ad-
</p>
<p>hering to the truth, he would simply say he was mistaken, and
</p>
<p>generally forced the jury to the same conclusion.
</p>
<p>The habit of charging witnesses with the commission of
</p>
<p>perjury is too common in our profession, and no discreet
</p>
<p>lawyer will tread upon such dangerous ground unless he
</p>
<p>knows his man ; for it often reacts upon counsel, to the great
</p>
<p>injury of his client, by exciting the sympathy of the jury in
</p>
<p>behalf of the person so accused.
</p>
<p>We have spoken of Mr. Polk as a man of great candor
</p>
<p>and sincerity, and no one who well knew him will withhold
</p>
<p>from him these attributes. But upon one occasion he
</p>
<p>resorted to a little subterfuge and artifice to extricate him-
</p>
<p>self from an unexpected dilemma, which was of so ludicrous
</p>
<p>a character that we must give it to the reader. If we mis-
</p>
<p>take not, it occurred in the old St. Louis Court of Common
</p>
<p>Pleas.

</p>
<p>is not uncommon to overlook one, and this was the case with
</p>
<p>Mr. Polk in the instance referred to. Sitting one day in the
</p>
<p>court-room, a case in which he was retained on the part of
</p>
<p>the defense was, most unexpectedly to him, called for trial.
</p>
<p>TR US TEN POLK. 4 1 1
</p>
<p>He was, of course, taken by surprise, and wholly unprepared
</p>
<p>for trial. The plaintiff's counsel announced himself ready,
</p>
<p>and was urgent for a trial. After taxing his ingenuity to the
</p>
<p>utmost extent to procure a little delay, and as the court was
</p>
<p>in the act of calling a jury, a brother-chip of Mr. Polk,
</p>
<p>whispering in his ear, informed him of the death of a young
</p>
<p>lawyer (whom we will here call John Smith), which occurred
</p>
<p>that morning. Now, it must be understood that neither Mr.
</p>
<p>Polk nor the court had ever heard of this John Smith, nor
</p>
<p>was he known to half a dozen of the disciples of Black-
</p>
<p>stone, for he had been here but a few months. Nevertheless,
</p>
<p>it had been from time immemorial, was then, and now is, the
</p>
<p>custom of the profession, upon the death of a member, to
</p>
<p>hold a bar-meeting to adopt resolutions commendatory of
</p>
<p>the deceased. This timely information suggested a lucky
</p>
<p>thought to Mr. Polk, who immediately rose, and, with a
</p>
<p>countenance as grave as a tomsbtone, announced to the
</p>
<p>court the sudden demise of a worthy and promising member
</p>
<p>of the profession, the aforesaid John Smith, and as it was
</p>
<p>probable that the usual bar-meeting would be held that
</p>
<p>afternoon, he hoped, out of respect to the memory of the
</p>
<p>deceased, and to enable the lawyers to attend the meeting,
</p>
<p>the court would adjourn for the day. The judge, anxious to
</p>
<p>relieve Mr. Polk from the consequences of his neglect, if it
</p>
<p>could be done upon any reasonable ground, replied, in a tone
</p>
<p>as grave and serious as that assumed by the learned counsel,
</p>
<p>" The court receives the announcement of the death of the
</p>
<p>lamented John Smith with profound sorrow, and out of re-
</p>
<p>spect to his memory, and to enable Brother Polk and others
</p>
<p>to attend the anticipated bar-meeting, will adjourn until ten
</p>
<p>o'clock to-morrow morning." Mr. Polk hastened to the
</p>
<p>clerk's office, took out his subpoenas, placed them in the
</p>
<p>hands of the sheriff to be served, and at the opening of the
</p>
<p>court the next morning was on hand with his witnesses, ready

</p>
<p>for trial.
</p>
<p>Governor Polk was a good friend to the junior members
</p>
<p>of the bar, who often applied to him for legal advice and
</p>
<p>412 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>assistance, and upon no occasion did he refuse it. If asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with one upon the trial of a cause, and it became
</p>
<p>necessary to take a nonsuit by reason of any error of his
</p>
<p>associate in drawing the pleadings, or otherwise, he would
</p>
<p>assume the responsibility, and thus avoid any exposure of
</p>
<p>his friend in open court. When opposed in the trial of a
</p>
<p>cause by a young and inexperienced lawyer, he would never
</p>
<p>take an undue advantage of him ; but, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>would aid and encourage him so far as he could do so con-
</p>
<p>sistently with his duty to his client. These qualities, so rare
</p>
<p>among the older members of the profession, made him many
</p>
<p>warm friends, who in after-life largely contributed to his
</p>
<p>political success.
</p>
<p>The first office held by Mr. Polk was city counselor of St.
</p>
<p>Louis, in 1843. In 1856 he was elected governor of the state,
</p>
<p>over Colonel Benton. After a brief period he resigned the
</p>
<p>office, to take his seat in the United States Senate, to which
</p>
<p>he had been previously elected by the Legislature. His
</p>
<p>administration as governor was too short to enable us to
</p>
<p>form an opinion of his executive ability, but he displayed
</p>
<p>one quality most worthy and commendable : he never per-
</p>
<p>mitted his personal feelings to interfere with a faithful dis-
</p>
<p>charge of public duty.
</p>
<p>A remarkable instance of this occurred at the commence-
</p>
<p>ment of his administration. One of the convicts in the pen-
</p>
<p>itentiary was a man who had been convicted of forgery, but
</p>
<p>had once held a high position in public estimation. He had
</p>
<p>held several positions of trust, and he and the governor had
</p>
<p>been class-leaders in the same church and at the same time.
</p>
<p>In fact, they had been warm personal friends, and had ren-
</p>
<p>dered mutual assistance to each other. It was generally
</p>
<p>taken for granted that one of the earliest acts of the gover-
</p>
<p>nor's administration would be to pardon his old friend. But
</p>
<p>in this public opinion was mistaken ; for the governor posi-

<p>tively refused to interfere with the execution of the law, and

<p>the prisoner served out his full time. That his sympathy

<p>was strongly enlisted in behalf of the convict was well

</p>
<p>known, but that adhesion to duty which never deserted him
</p>
<p>through Hfe made him firm and unyielding.
</p>
<p>Mr Polk made a useful senator, and was very attentive to
</p>
<p>the interests of his constituents, but fell short of the expec-
</p>
<p>tations of his friends It is well known that he was expelled
</p>
<p>from the Senate at the beginning of the war, for disloyalty.
</p>
<p>His participation in the Rebellion was the great error of his
</p>
<p>life ; but that it resulted from a conscientious conviction of
</p>
<p>duty is very evident, for by it he had nothing to gain and all
</p>
<p>to lose. It necessarily involved the loss of his seat in the
</p>
<p>Senate, the destruction of his professional business and in-
</p>
<p>terests at home, and a partial separation from his family, to
</p>
<p>say nothing of the probable confiscation of valuable property
</p>
<p>he held in St. Louis. As he had no taste for, or experience
</p>
<p>in, military life, he had little to hope for in his adhesion to
</p>
<p>the Southern Confederacy. In 1864 he was taken prisoner,
</p>
<p>and confined on Johnson's Island.
</p>
<p>Governor Polk died in St. Louis, in 1876, at the age of
</p>
<p>sixty-five, surrounded by his family and many warm friends.
</p>
<p>In 1837 he married Miss Elizabeth Skinner, of St. Louis,
</p>
<p>who, with several children  one the wife of William F.
</p>
<p>Causey, Esq., of the St. Louis bar  survives him.
</p>
<p>Among the incidents and anecdotes of his life is the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing: During the first or second year of his practice he
</p>
<p>was one day engaged in a trial in the St. Louis Circuit
</p>
<p>Court. A farmer from St. Charles, who had been sum-
</p>
<p>moned as a witness in some other cause, was sitting by,
</p>
<p>>who, noticing Mr. Polk's manner of conducting the case, be-
</p>
<p>came very much interested in his speech to the jury, and a
</p>
<p>few months afterwards employed him to defend a cause that
</p>
<p>had been brought against him in St. Charles. The plaintiff
</p>
<p>was represented by two or three old lawyers ; and at the
</p>
<p>commencement of the trial a friend of the defendant, feel-
</p>
<p>ing some solicitude in the matter, said to him : " Are you

<p>not afraid that these old lawyers will overpower your young

</p>
<p>David E. Ferryman
</p>
<p>Was for many years a practicing lawyer in Washington
</p>
<p>County, Missouri. Of his early life but little is known, fur-
</p>
<p>ther than that he was born in East Tennessee, and received
</p>
<p>but a very limited education, though it is said he taught a
</p>
<p>country school in Tennessee several years.
</p>
<p>About the year 1832 he removed to Missouri, and settled
</p>
<p>on a small farm near Potosi ; was elected one of the judges
</p>
<p>of the County Court of Washington County, and this, no
</p>
<p>doubt, suggested to him the idea of turning his attention to
</p>
<p>the law. It does not appear that he ever pursued a regular
</p>
<p>course of legal study, but probably read as many of the ele-
</p>
<p>mentary works as fell in his way. He commenced the prac-
</p>
<p>tice in 1840. About this time he began to take an active
</p>
<p>part in politics ; was a strong Whig, and great admirer of
</p>
<p>Henry Clay. It was either in 1840 or 1844 that he was
</p>
<p>placed on the Whig ticket as a candidate for elector, and
</p>
<p>canvassed a portion of south-east Missouri.
</p>
<p>In 1846 he was elected to the Legislature, and served
</p>
<p>two terms. It was as a legislator that he obtained what-
</p>
<p>ever reputation he possessed ; for as a lawyer he was little
</p>
<p>known, and never obtained much practice outside of his
</p>
<p>own county.
</p>
<p>He was a man of good, hard common-sense, and in the
</p>
<p>Legislature took a part in every important discussion. He
</p>
<p>seldom occupied more than ten or fifteen minutes in a
</p>
<p>speech, and had the happy faculty of knowing precisely at
</p>
<p>what time to stop. He had a great fund of dry humor;
</p>
<p>told an anecdote with good effect, and made it a point to
</p>
<p>give utterance in every speech to some witticism, which set
</p>
<p>the house in a good humor. By this means he always

</p>
<p>JOHN V. TURNER,
</p>
<p>Of Glasgow, Howard County, was born in Carroll County,
</p>
<p>Kentucky, on December i6, 1816. His early education was
</p>
<p>confined to the common schools of that day, but as he ap-
</p>
<p>proached manhood he entered Hanover College, Indiana,
</p>
<p>where he made considerable progress in his studies, but did
</p>
<p>not remain long enough to graduate. He, however, continued
</p>
<p>his studies, and by diligence and close application became a
</p>
<p>good classical scholar.
</p>
<p>He pursued the study of the law several years in Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky, and in 1842 came to Missouri and settled in Boonville,
</p>
<p>Cooper County. While practicing law there he frequently
</p>
<p>wrote for the Boonsville Observer, a sheet that acquired con-
</p>
<p>siderable celebrity through its terse and vigorous editorials,
</p>
<p>most of which were from Mr. Turner's pen, and he soon
</p>
<p>became the recognized editor. As the Democratic party was
</p>
<p>in the ascendant, the paper received little or no patronage
</p>
<p>from the state government, and had to rely chiefly upon the
</p>
<p>local advertising; but the ability with which it was edited
</p>
<p>gave it a large circulation, and Mr. Turner's reputation as a
</p>
<p>writer became well established. Many of his articles were
</p>
<p>republished in the leading Whig paper in St. Louis. Mr.
</p>
<p>Turner was a very decided Whig, and, like all Kentuckians
</p>
<p>who belonged to that party, was a great admirer of Mr. Clay,
</p>
<p>and supported him for the presidency with much zeal.
</p>
<p>Wishing, however, to retire from the editorial chair, and
</p>
<p>apply himself more closely to his profession, he removed to
</p>
<p>Keytesville, in Chariton County, where he practiced with fair
</p>
<p>success many years ; but in 1858 again changed his residence
</p>
<p>and permanently located in Glasgow, Howard County, where
</p>
<p>he remained till his death, which occurred on July 10, 1874,
</p>
<p>when in his fifty-eighth year. As a lawyer Mr. Turner was

</p>
<p>better known to his professional associates than to the com-
</p>
<p>munity at large, for his extreme modesty and retiring dis-
</p>
<p>position unfitted him for public display, and in respect to
</p>
<p>political preferment kept him in the background ; but those
</p>
<p>who knew him well placed a high estimate upon his legal
</p>
<p>attainments, and eagerly sought his opinions and advice.
</p>
<p>For office he never manifested any inclination, and refused,
</p>
<p>time and again, to permit his name to go before the public.
</p>
<p>The only public position which he ever filled was that of
</p>
<p>treasurer of his county, and in that case the office sought
</p>
<p>him, and he proved most worthy of the trust. It must not be
</p>
<p>supposed that his retirement proceeded from a want of inter-
</p>
<p>est in the public welfare, for he was a zealous advocate of
</p>
<p>internal improvements by both state and Federal govern-
</p>
<p>ments, and never failed to lend his aid to all projects tending
</p>
<p>to promote the public good. From what has been said of
</p>
<p>Mr. Turner it might be inferred that he was wanting in social
</p>
<p>qualities ; but such was not the fact, for he had consider-
</p>
<p>able humor, and upon all festive occasions added greatly to
</p>
<p>the zest and life of the company. He was, moreover, a man
</p>
<p>of generous impulses and warm attachments. His taste for
</p>
<p>general literature and scientific research better fitted him for
</p>
<p>the head of some institution of learning, and had his life
</p>
<p>taken that direction he must have attained no little celebrity.
</p>
<p>Mr. Turner had a fine poetical taste, which often led him to
</p>
<p>hold converse with the muses. At his death many speci-
</p>
<p>mens were found that had not been in print, and we give a
</p>
<p>short one which will furnish the reader with some idea of his
</p>
<p>poetical genius :

<p>Safely, Father, o'er to -Thee !
</p>
<p>Charles C. Whittelsey
</p>
<p>Was a well-known lawyer at the St. Louis bar, having prac-
</p>
<p>ticed there about thirty-five years. We became acquainted
</p>
<p>with him as early as 185 i, and knew him well from that time
</p>
<p>till his death. He was born in Middletown, Connecticut, on
</p>
<p>February 5, 1819, and his aged mother, a most estimable
</p>
<p>lady, still lives there to mourn the loss of an affectionate and
</p>
<p>devoted son. He was descended from a long line of clerical
</p>
<p>ancestors, his father's family being descendants of the Ed-
</p>
<p>wards family, and he on the maternal side was a descendant
</p>
<p>of the Rev. John Cotton, the first minister of Boston. They
</p>
<p>were of Revolutionary fame.
</p>
<p>His father was a lawyer of eminence in Connecticut. It is
</p>
<p>not strange, therefore, that Mr. Whittelsey should Have been
</p>
<p>marked out for one of the learned professions. After going
</p>
<p>through the ordinary course of common-school education, he
</p>
<p>entered, in 1834, Yale College, and in 1838 graduated high up
</p>
<p>in his class. The death of his father occurred shortly after-
</p>
<p>wards, and Charles, being unwilling to be dependent upon
</p>
<p>his mother, taught school for nearly a year, having to walk,
</p>
<p>in going to and returning from school, three miles each way,
</p>
<p>morning and evening. He then entered the office of Jona-
</p>
<p>than Barnes, an able jurist in Middletown, and applied him-
</p>
<p>self very closely to the study of the law. Mr. Barnes made
</p>
<p>his students draw all kinds of legal instruments, so as to fa-
</p>
<p>miliarize them with forms, which proved very serviceable to
</p>
<p>Mr. Whittelsey, who, in after-life, became the author of a
</p>
<p>Form Book, which we shall have occasion to refer to. In
</p>
<p>the winter of 1 840-1 Mr. Whittelsey came to Missouri, and
</p>
<p>settled in St. Louis, where he remained through life. He
</p>
<p>soon worked his way, by hard labor and diligence, to a very
</p>
<p>honorable position in the profession, and was always

</p>
<p>esteemed a sound, well-read, and reliable lawyer. His Form
</p>
<p>422 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Book, to which we have aUuded, was pubhshed by him in
</p>
<p>1857, and proved a most vahiable aid to judges of probate,
</p>
<p>judges of the County Court, clerks of courts, sheriffs, consta-
</p>
<p>bles, justices of tlic [)eace, administrators, etc., for it con-
</p>
<p>tained all the forms of proceedings adapted to those offices ;
</p>
<p>and particularly was it valuable to administrators, for it en-
</p>
<p>abled them to prepare their annual and final settlements with-
</p>
<p>out the aid and expense of a lawyer. It also furnished forms
</p>
<p>for all kinds of conveyances and acknowledgments. To the
</p>
<p>merchant and citizen it gave a form for drawing wills, bonds,
</p>
<p>promissory notes, bills of exchange, articles of agreement,
</p>
<p>articles of copartnership, etc.
</p>
<p>As the forms applied chiefly to our local statutes, the
</p>
<p>sale of the book was confined mostly to our state, but here it
</p>
<p>circulated largely, and found its way into every private law
</p>
<p>library and clerk's office. It was adapted chiefly to the Re-
</p>
<p>vised Statutes of 1856.
</p>
<p>In 1870 he published a work on General Practice, which
</p>
<p>had a large circulation, and proved valuable to the pro-
</p>
<p>fession. It was designed chiefly to aid young practi-
</p>
<p>tioners, and commenced with a very able chapter in refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the jurisdiction of courts of record in civil cases,
</p>
<p>and proceeded to give the forms of different kinds of proc-
</p>
<p>ess, and the duties of courts and their officers, following the
</p>
<p>general order of our Code of Practice. In other words, it is
</p>
<p>a book of trials and their incidents, and is a work of great
</p>
<p>value, which required the most herculean labor to compile.
</p>
<p>He was also reporter of the decisions of our Supreme Court,
</p>
<p>from i860 to 1867, and reported the cases embraced in vol-
</p>
<p>umes 31 to 41 inclusive. He exhibited great ability as a re-
</p>
<p>porter, and it was very rare that he made a mistake in his
</p>
<p>head-notes.
</p>
<p>In his practice he paid special attention to insurance and
</p>
<p>commercial cases, and became very efficient in those branches

<p>of the law. W'e never saw him in a criminal case, and it is
</p>
<p>questionable if he ever engaged in one of any importance.
</p>
<p>He was in no sense a brilliant lawyer, for he had none of
</p>
<p>the elements of oratory. His enunciation was too rapid

<p>CHARLES C. WHITTELSEY. 423
</p>
<p>and indistinct, and at times it was almost impossible to un-
</p>
<p>derstand him unless you were within a few feet of him. We
</p>
<p>are not aware that he ever filled any public position except
</p>
<p>as above stated, though he was an ardent politician, fond of
</p>
<p>attending political meetings, and very frequently addressed
</p>
<p>the people. He was an excellent political organizer, and
</p>
<p>would perform any amount of labor and drudgery when
</p>
<p>called upon by his political friends. He was a close student,
</p>
<p>fond of research, and, in investigating a legal problem, never
</p>
<p>stopped until he had touched the bottom of his subject.
</p>
<p>These qualities gave him success in his profession. Mr.
</p>
<p>Whittelsey had a high sense of honor  was scrupulously
</p>
<p>honest, and had a sovereign contempt for a professional
</p>
<p>trickster. He was, moreover, a man of fine social qual-
</p>
<p>ities  fond of public entertainments, theatrical and musical
</p>
<p>exhibitions, and the hours which he could spare from his
</p>
<p>professional duties were spent in that way.

</p>
<p>He left a widow and seven or eight children.
</p>
<p>Charles Jones.
</p>
<p>For a period of nearly forty years Charles Jones and the
</p>
<p>author were intimate friends, and their relations were pleasant
</p>
<p>and social. He never would declare to any one, not even to
</p>
<p>his own family, his age, but since his death we have learned
</p>
<p>that he was born in Somerset County, Maryland, on January
</p>
<p>27, 1814. He was the second son of Charles and Elizabeth
</p>
<p>Jones, and his father was a respectable farmer in comfort-
</p>
<p>able circumstances. He brought his sons up to labor and
</p>
<p>industrious habits. Charles received his primary instruction
</p>
<p>in the common district schools of his native county, but
</p>
<p>completed his education at the Washington Institution,
</p>
<p>which at that time was under the management of Dr. Laird,
</p>
<p>a Presbyterian minister.
</p>
<p>At the age of eighteen he commenced'reading law in the
</p>
<p>office of William H. Handy, Esq., and finished his legal
</p>
<p>course with William H. Collins, a prominent lawyer of Balti-
</p>
<p>more, and was there admitted to the bar. It does not ap-
</p>
<p>pear that he practiced much, if any, in Maryland, for in 1837
</p>
<p>he came to Missouri and went to Palmyra, in Marion County,
</p>
<p>intending to locate there; but not being pleased with the
</p>
<p>place, started on foot for Union, the county-seat of Franklin
</p>
<p>County, where we had located a few months before. As we
</p>
<p>sat on the steps of the hotel one day, he walked into town,
</p>
<p>inquired for us, and introduced himself as a young lawyer
</p>
<p>seeking a place in which to commence the practice. He
</p>
<p>had evidently seen but little of the world, and had a wild,
</p>
<p>staring look, as though he apprehended some great misfor-
</p>
<p>tune or calamity. We encouraged him to remain with us,
</p>
<p>and tendered him any assistance we could give. He con-
</p>
<p>cluded to pitch his tent with us, and three or four days after-
</p>
<p>wards both of us were retained in a case before a justice of

<p>the peace, on opposite sides. While the trial was progress-
</p>
<p>CHARLES JONES. 425
</p>
<p>ing, the boys were disposed to make themselves merry over
</p>
<p>a pair of boots that Mr. Jones had on. In those days boots
</p>
<p>were made with narrow or sharp-pointed toes, and in his
</p>
<p>long walk from Pahiiyra the toes of his boots had turned up
</p>
<p>in the shape of a sleigh-runner, while the heel had nearly
</p>
<p>reached the hollow of the foot. After the trial, several per-
</p>
<p>sons approached us and suggested the propriety of our ad-
</p>
<p>vising the new attorney to throw aside his sleigh-runners, as
</p>
<p>there was but little probability of snow for several months
</p>
<p>to come. The next day, in the kindness of our heart, and
</p>
<p>with the most benevolent intention, we advised a change,
</p>
<p>and suggested, in a way least calculated to wound his feel-
</p>
<p>ings, that if he was short in his finances we would gladly
</p>
<p>divide with him our cash on hand, amounting to about $Ap.
</p>
<p>He thanked us, and said he was not in want of anv. At
</p>
<p>that time our worldly possessions, all told, consisted of a
</p>
<p>horse, saddle, bridle, a few books, and the cash aforesaid,
</p>
<p>while he had in a belt around his waist, as we afterwards
</p>
<p>learned, from $2,000 to $3,000. We succeeded, however,
</p>
<p>with some difficulty, in persuading him to buy a new pair;
</p>
<p>but he always said it was the dearest pair he ever had, for
</p>
<p>they not only wore out in less than a month, but the mer-
</p>
<p>chant from whom he bought them made him pay for them
</p>
<p>twice, he having failed to take a receipt on the first payment.
</p>
<p>From that time Mr. Jones and the author became good
</p>
<p>friends; and it is a pleasant reflection that, though pitted
</p>
<p>against each other in almost every important case at the
</p>
<p>Franklin bar for many years, an unkind word never passed
</p>
<p>between us. He did not remain long at the county-seat,
</p>
<p>but purchased a farm three miles distant, upon which he
</p>
<p>lived until his removal to St. Louis.
</p>
<p>One of the marked features of his character, which
</p>
<p>adhered to him through life, was secretiveness. For }'ears
</p>
<p>after he settled at Union no one knew his politics, and every

</p>
<p>effort to get an avowal from him proved abortive. He
</p>
<p>expressed much admiration for Mr. Webster, but not beyond
</p>
<p>what any one might entertain for a man of such tran-
</p>
<p>scendent ability. He never attended any of the political
</p>
<p>426 BENCH AND PAR OF MISSOUKF.
</p>
<p>meetings, and evaded every inquiry touching his political
</p>
<p>tenets. Finally, however, he became a candidate for the
</p>
<p>State Senate, and for the first time announced himself a
</p>
<p>Democrat. He was elected, and remained in the Senate sev-
</p>
<p>eral 3^ears, and jjroved very serviceable to his constituents,
</p>
<p>for he was active, diligent, and faithful. He was far above
</p>
<p>an average member  in fact, he was a strong debater, and
</p>
<p>made himself very useful on several important committees.
</p>
<p>The disposition to conceal his opinions on many questions
</p>
<p>accompanied him to the Senate Chamber, and it was a com-
</p>
<p>mon inquiry among the members, " How will Charley Jones
</p>
<p>vote ? " He also displayed the same trait in his practice at
</p>
<p>the bar. He would conceal his intentions when conceal-
</p>
<p>ment could be of no possible avail to him, and he never
</p>
<p>would let it be known whether he was ready for trial until
</p>
<p>forced to show his hand. After his witnesses were sub-
</p>
<p>poened, he would procure the subpoenas from the sheriff and
</p>
<p>carry them in his hat, to keep the opposing counsel from
</p>
<p>learning their names. Uj^on leaving home he would often
</p>
<p>tell his friends that he was going to a particular place, and
</p>
<p>then, without an}' conceivable motive, go in the opposite
</p>
<p>direction. To conceal from his best friends, and all the
</p>
<p>world beside, his designs and intentions, was a passion, the
</p>
<p>indulgence of which seemed to be particularly gratifying to
</p>
<p>him. This trait in his character greatly impaired his influ-
</p>
<p>ence, not only with the public at large, but as an advocate
</p>
<p>before a court and jury. As a lawyer he was successful, for
</p>
<p>he made the cause of his client his own  prepared himself
</p>
<p>thoroughly, and left nothing undone to insure success.
</p>
<p>With each of his client's witnesses he would consult pri-
</p>
<p>vately  le irn in advance what they would testify to, and not
</p>
<p>trust to the representations of his client. He was rapid,
</p>
<p>fluent, and vehement, as a speaker, but greatly wanting in
</p>
<p>method and the power of concentration. He would, in his

<p>argument, seize a strong point in the case, and, as if appre-
</p>
<p>hensive that it might be overlooked, repeat it over and over
</p>
<p>again, until he not only impaired its force, but frequently

<p>exhausted the patience of the jury.
</p>
<p>CHARLES JONES. 42/
</p>
<p>Mr. Jones started out in life with the determination to
</p>
<p>make a fortune, and bent all his energy in that direction.
</p>
<p>The love of money became his ruling passion, and absorbed
</p>
<p>his thoughts by day and night. In a trade he knew no man,
</p>
<p>friend or foe. He would seek the advantage with his
</p>
<p>brother as soon as the veriest stranger in the land. He was
</p>
<p>careful, cautious, and saving, and never indulged in extrava-
</p>
<p>gance of any kind. This enabled him to accumulate a large
</p>
<p>fortune, for at his death he left an estate valued at over a
</p>
<p>quarter of a million of dollars. He was excessively fond of
</p>
<p>good horses ; always kept plenty of them, and was an excel-
</p>
<p>lent judge of them. He lived comfortably, and in his home
</p>
<p>was one of the most hospitable of men. He delighted to
</p>
<p>have his friends call upon him, and entertained them with
</p>
<p>much cordiality. His mind was not free from doubt upon the
</p>
<p>subject of religion, but he subscribed to the doctrine of
</p>
<p>Christianity, and was a firm believer in predestination, upon
</p>
<p>which subject he would converse as long as he could get any
</p>
<p>person to listen to him.
</p>
<p>He had a strange and unaccountable fear of death, \\hich,
</p>
<p>however, during his long and protracted illness, gradually
</p>
<p>subsided. This fear of death is not uncommon even with
</p>
<p>men of strong intellects and religious feelings. The cele-
</p>
<p>brated Dr. Sam Johnson admitted that it haunted him through
</p>
<p>life, yet he was a very pure and religious man. Mr. Jones
</p>
<p>was ill a year, during the last three months of which he
</p>
<p>was confined to his bed. We visited him almost daily, and if
</p>
<p>absent two or three da}'s, he complained of our want of atten-
</p>
<p>tion. For several months before his death he became satis-
</p>
<p>fied that his end was near, and prepared his worldly affairs
</p>
<p>for the event. Although he owned ten or twelve fine resi-
</p>
<p>dences in St. Louis, he bought a large, commodious dwelling
</p>
<p>in the most fashionable part of the city, had it furnished
</p>
<p>handsomely, and moved into it a month before his death.

</p>
<p>He informed us that it was for his widow.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jones' physicians entertained great doubts as to the
</p>
<p>nature of his disease, but a post-mortem examination, made
</p>
<p>in our presence, revealed a cancer in his stomach. He had
</p>
<p>428 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>long entertained a suspicion that such might be the case.
</p>
<p>He retained full possession of his mental powers to the mo-
</p>
<p>ment of his death. Two days before he breathed his last he
</p>
<p>called us to his bedside, and requested us to indict a letter
</p>
<p>to his attorney in Franklin County, who was defending a
</p>
<p>land suit which was pending against him. We wrote, at his
</p>
<p>dictation, four pages of foolscap, and his mind was never
</p>
<p>clearer than at that time. He died in July, 1876.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jones married Miss Yoste, of St. Louis County, a lady
</p>
<p>of fine appearance and many accomplishments, who survives
</p>
<p>him. He also left four interesting children. He was a kind
</p>
<p>husband and father, and found in his domestic relations the
</p>
<p>chief source of his happiness.
</p>
<p>There was one feature in Mr. Jones' character which mer-
</p>
<p>its the highest commendation. Notwithstanding his love of
</p>
<p>money, and his insatiable desire to accumulate, he was the
</p>
<p>kindest man to his slaves we ever met. At the commence-
</p>
<p>ment of the Rebellion he had about sixty, most of them very
</p>
<p>valuable. He was fully convinced that the war would neces-
</p>
<p>sarily liberate them, and, though he had frequent oppor-
</p>
<p>tunities, never would sell one, not even those who were
</p>
<p>disobedient to him. Some time before Mr. Lincoln's
</p>
<p>proclamation we remarked, in a jocular way, that he
</p>
<p>had better put some in his pocket. His reply was that he
</p>
<p>would rather lose every slave he owned than to sell one.
</p>
<p>We saw him once buying a woman and seven children at a
</p>
<p>high price, rather than see them fall into the hands of a South-
</p>
<p>ern trader. He worked most of his slaves on different farms
</p>
<p>in Franklin County, but it was very rare that he worked one
</p>
<p>over five or six hours in the day, and in sickness he took the
</p>
<p>greatest care of them. He never could deny them any favor
</p>
<p>they asked. He certainly never derived any profit from his
</p>
<p>slaves, for their labor merely fed and clothed them. After
</p>
<p>they became free under the proclamation, most of them re-

<p>mained with him, and those who did not continued to par-
</p>
<p>take of his bounty. After his removal to the city of St.
</p>
<p>Louis he gave directions to his family physician, in Franklin
</p>
<p>County, to attend to his old slaves in sickness, and to send
</p>

<p>fell swoop did not affect him as much as was anticipated. It
</p>
<p>presents an anomaly in his character which admits of no rea-
</p>
<p>sonable solution.
</p>
<p>In the civil war, Mr. Jones sympathized with the South,
</p>
<p>but he was not a disunionist. We have often heard him say
</p>
<p>that secession furnished no remedy for the wrongs commit-
</p>
<p>ted against the South. He believed that the floor of Con-
</p>
<p>gress was the only available battle-ground.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jones had but few attached friends, for it was not in
</p>
<p>his nature to place unlimited confidence in any one. We
</p>
<p>probably secured as much of his good-will as any one out-
</p>
<p>side of his immediate family, and yet he was as cautious and
</p>
<p>reserved in disclosing to us the secrets of his heart as though
</p>
<p>we were a mere casual acquaintance. His conversation was
</p>
<p>no index to what was transpiring in his mind ; for, like Talley-
</p>
<p>rand, he believed that the true use of speech was not so
</p>
<p>much to express one's wants and thoughts as to conceal
</p>
<p>them. He seemed to regard wealth as the chief passport to
</p>
<p>power and happiness, but lived to realize the truth of what
</p>
<p>the poet hath said :
</p>
<p>" The boast of heraldry, tlie pomp of power,
</p>
<p>And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave.
</p>
<p>Await alike the inevitable hour 
</p>
<p>The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
</p>
<p>Mr. Jones was at times subject to great mental depression,
</p>
<p>but generally possessed a fine flow of spirits, and though with-
</p>
<p>out any faculty for telling anecdotes, greatly enjoyed them
</p>
<p>when told by others. Upon one occasion we traveled to-
</p>
<p>gether on horseback to attend the Pulaski Circuit Court, and,
</p>
<p>being overtaken late in the day by a snow-storm, were forced
</p>
<p>to put up for the night at a widow's, who kept a small inn for
</p>
<p>the entertainment of man and beast. We were strangers to

</p>
<p>the widow, never having had occasion to patronize her before.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jones wore a broad-brimmed hat, and a frock-coat cut
</p>
<p>after the style usually worn by Methodist clergymen. She
</p>
<p>430 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>became immediately impressed with the opinion that he was
</p>
<p>a Methodist circuit-rider, and took the first occasion to in-
</p>
<p>quire of us liis name, and the name of the circuit he trav-
</p>
<p>eled. When we told her that he was traveling on the Pu-
</p>
<p>laski Circuit, all doubt as to his. vocation, if she had enter-
</p>
<p>tained any before, was evidently removed, for in less than
</p>
<p>ten minutes we heard the " squall " of a dying chicken, and
</p>
<p>congratulated each other upon the prospect of an early and
</p>
<p>good repast after a long day's ride. And we were not dis-
</p>
<p>appointed ; for, besides the young, fat, and tender chicken,
</p>
<p>our considerate landlady had provided us with waffles, light
</p>
<p>biscuit, and a pitcher of fresh milk, to all of which we did
</p>
<p>ample justice, for we had not eaten anything since five
</p>
<p>o'clock that morning.
</p>
<p>After the table was cleared away the widow brought out a
</p>
<p>famih^ bible and prayer-book, and requested Brother Jones to
</p>
<p>engage in prayer, which he declined upon the score of great
</p>
<p>fatigue from his long ride. After a good breakfast the next
</p>
<p>morning, our horses were brought out, and Mr. Jones asked
</p>
<p>the widow for the amount of his bill, and received for reply,
</p>
<p>''Nothing ; I never make a charge against ministers." We
</p>
<p>then approached her, and asked for the amount of our bill,
</p>
<p>and she answered, " One dollar,'' which we promptly paid.
</p>
<p>Now comes the cream of the joke. The uniform price at
</p>
<p>that time, at all way-side inns, was Jjfty cents. It was evident,
</p>
<p>therefore, that the widow, who had an eye to self, had deter-
</p>
<p>mined that we should foot the bill for both, or, in other words,
</p>
<p>to make out of us the loss occasioned by her Christian benev-
</p>
<p>olence. When we had proceeded a few hundred yards from
</p>
<p>the house, Mr. Jones burst out in a laugh that might have been
</p>
<p>heard half a mile. " Well," said he, " you paid dearly for your
</p>
<p>trick upon me." We insisted that upon every principle of
</p>
<p>equity and fair dealing he should refund to us the half-dollar,
</p>
<p>and we continued to present the bill to him for a quarter of a

<p>century, until, in fact, the interest upon the amount, com-
</p>
<p>pounded, reached a fabulous sum. He enjoyed the incident
</p>
<p>through life  told it upon all occasions, and each time with
</p>
<p>additional zest and merriment. Often when we found him in

</p>
<p>a despondent mood, particularly during the last year of his
</p>
<p>life, we could restore him to cheerfulness, and elicit from him
</p>
<p>a hearty laugh, by demanding the payment of our bill.
</p>
<p>Among the acquaintances of Mr. Jones much curiosity has
</p>
<p>been felt respecting his religious views. He often expressed
</p>
<p>to us his belief in the leading tenets of the Christian religion.
</p>
<p>He had implicit faith in the efficacy of prayer, and often told
</p>
<p>us that when suffering from mental despondency he com-
</p>
<p>muned freely with his God. During his last hours he
</p>
<p>frequently called upon his wife to pray for him. He was
</p>
<p>much opposed to sectarianism, and though a Protestant, never
</p>
<p>objected to have his children educated in Catholic schools.
</p>
<p>His wife, a very intellectual lady, was a Catholic, and he left
</p>
<p>to her the duty of providing for the education of their chil-
</p>
<p>dren. Knowing that it would be gratifying to his family,
</p>
<p>he received, just before his death, the rites of the Catholic
</p>
<p>Church.

</p>
<p>Benjamin F. Hickman.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, with whom we became early acquainted,
</p>
<p>and whom we regarded as one of our best friends, was for
</p>
<p>many years clerk of the United States Circuit and District
</p>
<p>Courts for the Eastern District of Missouri. He was born
</p>
<p>in Frankfort, Kentucky, March 8, 1810, and educated in a
</p>
<p>select school taught in Frankfort by Charles and Kene
</p>
<p>O'Harris, noted in that day for their skill in preparing pupils
</p>
<p>for a collegiate course. When young Hickman reached the
</p>
<p>age of twenty he became a deputy in the office of Francis
</p>
<p>P. Blair, clerk of the court at Frankfort, who afterwards
</p>
<p>became a distinguished political writer, and editor of Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Jackson's administration organ, at Washington. In due
</p>
<p>time he commenced the study of the law in the office of
</p>
<p>Lewis Saunders, and after being admitted to the bar, in
</p>
<p>1 83 1 or 1832, commenced the practice of his profession in
</p>
<p>Lawrenceburg, Anderson County, and practiced there sev-
</p>
<p>eral years, during which time he was twice elected to repre-
</p>
<p>sent that county in the Kentucky Legislature.
</p>
<p>His first wife was a Miss Cunningham, who shortly after
</p>
<p>her marriage was killed in attempting to jump from a buggy
</p>
<p>drawn by a horse that was running away. Mr. Hickman was
</p>
<p>very severely injured, and narrowly escaped death. It threw
</p>
<p>him into a melancholy condition of mind, which for some
</p>
<p>time greatly alarmed his friends.
</p>
<p>In 1832 he volunteered in the Black Hawk War, and
</p>
<p>became an aid to Governor Reynolds, of Illinois. In 1841
</p>
<p>Mr. Hickman moved to St. Louis, and there entered upon
</p>
<p>the practice of the law, and at the end of two years located
</p>
<p>in Jefferson City, where he not only practiced law, but
</p>
<p>became editor of a political paper called Tlie Metropolitan.
</p>
<p>In 1848 Judge Robert W. Wells appointed him clerk of

<p>the United States Court, when he moved to St. Louis, and
</p>
<p>BENJAMIN F. HICKMAN. 433
</p>
<p>was appointed, by Judge Samuel Treat, clerk of the District
</p>
<p>Court, and he continued clerk of both courts until his death,
</p>
<p>on February 6, 1871, making his age, at the time of his
</p>
<p>death, within a month of sixty-one years.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hickman was not al the Missouri bar long enough to
</p>
<p>attain much distinction in his profession, but he became one
</p>
<p>of the most efficient clerks that ever served in a Federal
</p>
<p>court, and so faithful was he in the discharge of his duties
</p>
<p>that he secured, and retained to his death, the good-will and
</p>
<p>approbation of the entire bar of the state. Judges and law-
</p>
<p>yers all deferred to his opinion and judgment in all matters
</p>
<p>pertaining to his office. No one could be more familiar with
</p>
<p>its duties, and no one was ever more faithful in the discharge
</p>
<p>of them. Every practitioner in the Federal courts well
</p>
<p>knows the difficulties and vexations that a clerk has to
</p>
<p>encounter; yet Colonel Hickman always appeared pleasant
</p>
<p>and affable, and towards the bar and suitors was ever cour-
</p>
<p>teous and obliging. Nature made him a gentleman, and in
</p>
<p>his house he was most hospitable and entertaining. He was
</p>
<p>a man of kind heart and generous impulses, and he took the
</p>
<p>greatest delight in entertaining his friends, and dispensing
</p>
<p>the hospitality of his home. It was not that generosity
</p>
<p>which expects its reward, but was heartfelt and disinterested.
</p>
<p>Many an evening have we spent in his family circle, and no
</p>
<p>one could leave it without feeling that he had been princely
</p>
<p>entertained.
</p>
<p>Colonel Hickman was very popular, and his death created
</p>
<p>a profound sensation throughout St. Louis and the state, A
</p>
<p>bar-meeting was held in the United States court-room, to
</p>
<p>pay a tribute of respect to his memory, which was very
</p>
<p>largely attended, and appropriate resolutions adopted, and a
</p>
<p>general feeling of sorrow and regret pervaded the minds of
</p>
<p>all. Shortly afterwards the Hon. J. D. S. Dryden presented
</p>
<p>the resolutions to the United States Court, with a request

<p>that they be spread upon the records of the court; and, in
</p>
<p>granting the request. Judge Samuel Treat paid a glowing
</p>
<p>tribute to the deceased, from which we extract the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing :

</p>
<p>" His generous and public-spirited naliue diverted him for a time, to a large
</p>
<p>extent, from mere professional and private pursuits, into active participation in
</p>
<p>the engrossing public questions of the day  involving, necessarily, an extended
</p>
<p>actpiainlance with the prominent men on whom the solution of those questions
</p>
<p>depended, and a reliable familiarity with the principles involved. Eminently
</p>
<p>sociable and generous, his personal inlluence and popularity were consequently
</p>
<p>great, and his aid and advice were therefore sought in most of the then popu-
</p>
<p>lar movements of the time. Then, as throughout his life, he manifested
</p>
<p>the most earnest devotion to all the rec|uirements of personal or public friend-
</p>
<p>ships, and without sacrifice of principle, and regardless of selfish considera-
</p>
<p>tions, was prompt to do for others what kindness or justice seemed to require.
</p>
<p>His dominant characteristics were fidelity, energy, business capacity, and gen-
</p>
<p>erosity. He was sternly true to the nobler and more generous impulses of our
</p>
<p>nature : resting with sincere confidence in his friendly relations with others,
</p>
<p>and instant in repelling any intimations tending to shake or lessen his confi-
</p>
<p>dence. Such a life necessarily created strong attachments, which nothing but
</p>
<p>overwhelming convictions, based on clear proofs, were apt to sunder. Chari-
</p>
<p>table to a fault, open-handed, sympathetic, and unselfish, he assisted others,
</p>
<p>and gave freely, when a more scrutinizing disposition might have hesitated or
</p>
<p>withheld the solicited favor. In all such cases he discriminated in favor of the
</p>
<p>supposed needs of others, and against himself. These large-hearted and liberal
</p>
<p>traits of character pervaded his whole life ; but by no means unaccompanied
</p>
<p>with more heroic elements. He was as bold to dare, when occasion recjuired,
</p>
<p>as he was generous to give or forgive."

<p>Joel F. asper.
</p>
<p>Mr. Asper was a practicing lawyer in Livingston County,
</p>
<p>Missouri. He was born in Adams County, Pennsylvania, in
</p>
<p>1822, and removed with his parents into Ohio when very
</p>
<p>young. Of his early education we have no reliable informa-
</p>
<p>tion, but he was admitted to the bar in Ohio, in 1844, and
</p>
<p>after practicing there for some time came to Missouri, and set-
</p>
<p>tled in Chillicothe, on the line of the Hannibal & St. Joseph
</p>
<p>Railroad. His practice was not very extensive, and he de-
</p>
<p>voted part of his time to editing a local paper. He was also
</p>
<p>for a short period prosecuting attorney for his county. On
</p>
<p>the breaking-out of the war he took a very decided stand in
</p>
<p>favor of the Union; raised and organized a military com-
</p>
<p>pany, became its captain, was mustered into the volun-
</p>
<p>teer service, and in one of two engagements in which he par-
</p>
<p>ticipated was severely wounded. Upon leaving the army
</p>
<p>he returned to Chillicothe, and resumed the practice of the
</p>
<p>law. He never acquired much distinction in the law, but
</p>
<p>obtained considerable prominence as a politician, and in 1868
</p>
<p>was elected to the Forty-first Congress. He served but one
</p>
<p>term  too short a period to become noted as a public man.
</p>
<p>He died in October, 1872, at the age of fifty. He was
</p>
<p>represented as a man of social and agreeable manners, with

<p>considerable vivacity, and was a fluent and ready speaker.
</p>
<p>James H. birch.
</p>
<p>The recent death of this old and experienced lawyer and
</p>
<p>politician, announced by the press throughout the state, ad-
</p>
<p>monishes us of the rapidity with which the early lights of
</p>
<p>the profession are passing away.
</p>
<p>Judge Birch was born in Montgomery County, Virginia,
</p>
<p>on March 27, 1804, and was, therefore, at his death, which
</p>
<p>occurred in March, 1878, at his. residence in Clinton County,
</p>
<p>seventy-four years of age.
</p>
<p>His father was a clergyman, and moved into Kentucky,
</p>
<p>and there died when his son was about seventeen years of
</p>
<p>age. The education of James was obtained in the common
</p>
<p>schools, and soon after the death of his father he com-
</p>
<p>menced the study of medicine, to which, however, he took a
</p>
<p>dislike, and soon abandoned it and entered upon the study of
</p>
<p>the law in the office of the Hon. John Trimble, then one of the
</p>
<p>judges of the Supreme Court of Kentucky. He must have
</p>
<p>been admitted to the bar as soon as he became of age.
</p>
<p>In 1825 he married a daughter of Daniel Halstead, of
</p>
<p>Lexington, and in the latter part of the following year re-
</p>
<p>moved to St. Louis, and was employed in the editorial de-
</p>
<p>partment of the 5/. Loids Enquirer, a Democratic paper
</p>
<p>published under the auspices of Colonel Benton. In July,
</p>
<p>1827, he moved to Fayette, Howard County, and established
</p>
<p>the Western Monitor, a weekly journal, said to be at that
</p>
<p>time the most western paper published in the United States.
</p>
<p>It was Democratic in its policy, and very warmly supported
</p>
<p>General Jackson for the presidency.
</p>
<p>The first public office held by Mr. Birch was that of clerk
</p>
<p>of the lower house of the General Assembly, in 1828-9. ^^
</p>
<p>the next session he was made secretary of the Senate, and at
</p>
<p>this time took a very active part in politics, often addressing

<p>the people frcmi the rostrum.
</p>
<p>JAMES H. BIRCH. 437
</p>
<p>As soon as eligible, the people of the senatorial district
</p>
<p>composed of Howard and Randolph Counties elected him
</p>
<p>to the State Senate. Although one of the youngest mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the body, he was made chairman of the joint com-
</p>
<p>mittee appointed to revase the laws  a very responsible and
</p>
<p>laborious position. Before the expiration of his term he re-
</p>
<p>signed, to enable him to devote more time to his professional
</p>
<p>business and the publication of his paper. In 1843 Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Tyler appointed him register of the Land Office at
</p>
<p>Plattsburg, a new office then lately established. In 1849 he
</p>
<p>was appointed judge of the Supreme Court of the state, and
</p>
<p>held the position until the election of 1852, when he de-
</p>
<p>clined to become a candidate. His opinions as rendered
</p>
<p>from the bench will be found in volumes 12 to 15, inclusive,
</p>
<p>of the Missouri Reports.
</p>
<p>Judge Birch was out of his element on the bench. His
</p>
<p>mind was of that sort which required the stimulus of excite-
</p>
<p>ment to develop his resources, and had he succeeded in
</p>
<p>obtaining a seat in Congress, and retained it a sufficient
</p>
<p>time, he would doubtless have made his mark, and, in all
</p>
<p>probability, secured a national reputation, which others of
</p>
<p>far less ability have done.
</p>
<p>After leaving the bench he was again appointed and re-
</p>
<p>appointed register of the Land Office, the duties of which
</p>
<p>were very onerous, for at that time the immigration to the
</p>
<p>Platte country was very large, and necessarily created an
</p>
<p>unusual demand for public lands.
</p>
<p>Judge Birch always manifested a strong desire to obtain a
</p>
<p>seat in Congress, was several times a candidate, but, by a
</p>
<p>combination of unfavorable circumstances, suffered defeat.
</p>
<p>He was a strong advocate for internal improvements,
</p>
<p>espoused with much ardor the building of a railroad to the
</p>
<p>Pacific, addressed the people of the northern counties to
</p>
<p>induce them to subscribe liberally to the construction of the

</p>
<p>Hannibal & St. Joseph road, and in all matters of public
</p>
<p>enterprise was ardent and enthusiastic.
</p>
<p>In 1 86 1 he was elected to the Constitutional Convention,
</p>
<p>and became one of the most active members of that body.
</p>
<p>43^ BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>He espoused the cause of the Union, but his conservative
</p>
<p>poHcy did not please the extremists of either party. Some
</p>
<p>of his speeches deHvered during the sessions of the Con-
</p>
<p>vention were highly spoken of as forensic efforts. He was
</p>
<p>very tall and commanding  considerably over six feet  and
</p>
<p>had an easy and flowing delivery, a clear and distinct enun-
</p>
<p>ciation. We heard him on several occasions when the Con-
</p>
<p>vention was holding its sessions in the hall of the Mercantile
</p>
<p>Library at St. Louis, then the largest room in the state, and
</p>
<p>though not well adapted to the sound of the human voice,
</p>
<p>yet every word uttered by Judge Birch could be distinctly
</p>
<p>heard in the remotest part of the room.
</p>
<p>To enable the reader to form some idea of Judge Birch's
</p>
<p>ready command of language and his facility of expression,
</p>
<p>we give an extract from one of his speeches delivered soon
</p>
<p>after the assembling of the Convention :
</p>
<p>" It is brought forward as the crowning element wherewith to dispirit us that
</p>
<p>the Northern people have at last elected a sectional candidate upon a sectional
</p>
<p>platform, and that we have no reason to hope that they will change their ver-
</p>
<p>dict.
</p>
<p>"I scarcely know how to address myself to a proposition of that kind, and
</p>
<p>will hence simply present such counteracting facts as may present themselves
</p>
<p>to my mind, and will leave the Convention, when they retire, to reflect upon
</p>
<p>what I have thus desultorily thrown together, and put the disjointed fragments
</p>
<p>into the proper connections of a speech.
</p>
<p>" IMy purpose will be to array the authority of the men of the North against the
</p>
<p>/(7/?V?Vza^ of the South   it being the /^(7//d' of that section whom it will be
</p>
<p>our duty to address in the name and by the authority of the people of our own
</p>
<p>section. To the alleged declaration of Mr, Sumner, therefore, whose authority has
</p>
<p>been invoked by the despondent and treacherous amongst us, that the Critten-
</p>
<p>den propositions were an insult to Massachusetts  to this insolent and summary
</p>
<p>disposition of the propositions of the senior senator, whom it is the intention of
</p>
<p>our resolve to honor  it is deemed sufficient to reply that, whilst the senator
</p>

<p>portion of my countrymen. North or South."
</p>
<p>Luke E. Lawless.
</p>
<p>Of this able and erratic lawyer and jurist we have sought
</p>
<p>information from every source most likely to furnish it, and
</p>
<p>yet we are forced to confess that our material for a history
</p>
<p>of his life is very meager and unsatisfactory. We met him
</p>
<p>a few times while he was on the bench of the St. Louis Cir-
</p>
<p>cuit Court, but our acquaintance was only such as would or-
</p>
<p>dinarily arise from a casual introduction. While he was well
</p>
<p>known throughout the state as a very prominent member of
</p>
<p>the St. Louis bar, few indeed were on terms of intimacy with
</p>
<p>him, for he was very reserved in his intercourse with others,
</p>
<p>and never mixed with the people, and but little with even
</p>
<p>those who belonged to his own profession.
</p>
<p>He was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1781, and graduated
</p>
<p>with honor at the Dublin University; took an active part in
</p>
<p>the Revolution of 1798, and, by reason of his hostility and
</p>
<p>aversion to the English government, volunteered in the army
</p>
<p>of Napoleon, and served with him throughout the Peninsular
</p>
<p>War, reaching the rank of colonel. It is well known that
</p>
<p>the emperor obtained most of his marshals and officers from
</p>
<p>the ranks of his army, and selected them by reason of their
</p>
<p>gallantry and courage displayed upon the field of battle 
</p>
<p>hence the fact that Colonel Lawless, though a foreigner, held
</p>
<p>so high a rank in the French army is the best evidence of
</p>
<p>his skill and bravery as a soldier. Upon the return of
</p>
<p>Napoleon from Elba, Colonel Lawless delivered the con-
</p>
<p>gratulatory address of his regiment. In several battles he
</p>
<p>was severely wounded, the marks of which accompanied him
</p>
<p>to his grave.
</p>
<p>Upon the close of the war he settled in France ; married a
</p>
<p>French lady, and practiced law there for about fifteen years ;
</p>
<p>became engaged in a duel and was wounded in the leg, and

</p>
<p>always afterwards walked lame.
</p>
<p>LUKE E. LAWLESS. 44 1
</p>
<p>About 1824 he immigrated to the United States and took
</p>
<p>up his residence in St. Louis, where he practiced law, except
</p>
<p>during the interval he was on the bench, until his death, in
</p>
<p>1846, at the age of sixty-five. He left no children to inherit
</p>
<p>his name. His widow died afterwards in Carondelet.
</p>
<p>In 1837 or 1838, upon the resignation of Judge William
</p>
<p>C. Carr, he was appointed judge of the St. Louis Circuit
</p>
<p>Court, and held the position three years, when he returned
</p>
<p>to the bar.
</p>
<p>Judge Lawless was about five feet ten in height, slender
</p>
<p>in form, with large and prominent features. He had a mili-
</p>
<p>tary bearing, and was very dignified in his manners.
</p>
<p>He was an accomplished scholar and fine linguist  spoke
</p>
<p>the French, German, and Spanish languages with great flu-
</p>
<p>ency, and throughout life was a close, diligent student. He
</p>
<p>was thoroughly read in the profession, and had mastered
</p>
<p>both the civil and common law. He was an adept in logic,
</p>
<p>and few excelled him in the argument of an abstruse legal
</p>
<p>problem. His power of judicial analysis was remarkable.
</p>
<p>At the bar he ranked with such men as Geyer, Gamble,
</p>
<p>Bates, Darby, and Spalding. Like Bates, Primm, and John
</p>
<p>Scott, he always carried with him into the court-room a large
</p>
<p>green bag, in imitation of the Irish and English barristers.
</p>
<p>He was not an orator, but a pungent and impressive speaker,
</p>
<p>never indulging in boisterous or vehement declamation.
</p>
<p>Irony, sarcasm, and wit were his weapons, and he used them
</p>
<p>with an unsparing hand. He was at times very good at
</p>
<p>repartee. Upon one occasion he was arguing a question of
</p>
<p>law in the United States Court, before Judge Catron, and
</p>
<p>quoted a decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri, when
</p>
<p>Judge Catron interrupted him by saying:
</p>
<p>" I presume, Colonel Lawless, you are aware that the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court of Missouri has been reversed by the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of the United States." "Yes," said Lawless, "I am

</p>
<p>aware of that, and if there was any tribunal that had the
</p>
<p>power, they would reverse the Supreme Court of the United
</p>
<p>States."
</p>
<p>442 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>The happy retort brought a smile upon the face of Judge
</p>
<p>Catron.
</p>
<p>The most important event in Judge Lawless' professional
</p>
<p>life is connected with the impeachment before the United
</p>
<p>States Senate of James A. Peck, a Federal judge in Mis-
</p>
<p>souri.
</p>
<p>In April, 1826, there appeared in the Missouri Advocate
</p>
<p>and St. Louis E7iquirer a communication over the signature
</p>
<p>of " A Citizen," a criticism upon a decision of Judge Peck
</p>
<p>relating to certain Missouri land titles. The criticism was
</p>
<p>couched in respectful language, but Judge Peck, thinking it
</p>
<p>was calculated to bring the decisions of the court into disre-
</p>
<p>pute, caused a rule to be served upon the proprietor of the
</p>
<p>paper to show cause why an attachment should not issue
</p>
<p>against him for contempt of court, etc. The proprietor, in
</p>
<p>his answer, denied that the statement was false or indeco-
</p>
<p>rous, or that he had any intention of bringing odium upon
</p>
<p>the court, and concluded by giving the name of Colonel Law-
</p>
<p>less as the author.
</p>
<p>An order was then made on Lawless to show cause, etc.
</p>
<p>He replied, denying the jurisdiction of the court, as an ap-
</p>
<p>peal had been taken in the case in which the decision had
</p>
<p>been rendered. He also alleged that the object of the pub-
</p>
<p>lication was to counteract the effect that the decision of the
</p>
<p>court was calculated to produce on the value of the uncon-
</p>
<p>firmed Spanish and French land titles. The rule was made
</p>
<p>absolute, and the court sentenced Colonel Lawless to twenty-
</p>
<p>four hours' imprisonment, and suspended him from the prac-
</p>
<p>tice for eighteen months.
</p>
<p>Colonel Lawless sent a memorial to the House of Repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives at Washington, and articles of impeachment were
</p>
<p>preferred against Judge Peck, charging him with usurpa-
</p>
<p>tion of power, tyranny, and oppression. The trial took place
</p>
<p>before the United States Senate, and was the most celebrated

</p>
<p>trial of the kind ever had before that body. The most emi-
</p>
<p>nent lawyers in the country appeared in the case, and, after
</p>
<p>the close of the evidence, over a week was occupied in the
</p>
<p>LUKE E. LAWLESS. 443
</p>
<p>summing-up of the evidence, and discussing the powers of a
</p>
<p>court in inflicting punishment for a supposed contempt.
</p>
<p>All the law that was ever promulgated upon that subject,
</p>
<p>both in England and in this country, was collated by Judge
</p>
<p>Lawless, and by him furnished the managers. Nearly all the
</p>
<p>pleadings upon the part of the government were drawn by
</p>
<p>him, and he displayed a most masterly knowledge of the law
</p>
<p>of the case.
</p>
<p>The accused was acquitted by a very close vote, some of
</p>
<p>the most eminent lawyers in the Senate voting for convic-
</p>
<p>tion. More of the particulars of the trial will be found in
</p>
<p>our memoir of Judge Peck.
</p>
<p>One of the peculiarities of Judge Lawless was absent-
</p>
<p>mindedness. In going home from court he would fre-
</p>
<p>quently walk several squares beyond his house, and not
</p>
<p>discover his mistake until he met some acquaintance who
</p>
<p>would inquire where he was going. In shopping with
</p>
<p>Madam Lawless, if his attention was drawn to anything of
</p>
<p>interest passing on the street, he would sometimes walk off
</p>
<p>and forget where he had left her. Not unfrequently he
</p>
<p>w^ould leave home without a hat, and not be sensible of it
</p>
<p>until some one reminded him of it. When invited out to
</p>
<p>dinner he seldom could recollect the hour, and often
</p>
<p>appeared either too early or too late.
</p>
<p>His fondness for potatoes was proverbial. If he put up at
</p>
<p>a hotel and found no potatoes on the table, he would give
</p>
<p>the landlord a good round cursing. He had them on his
</p>
<p>own table three times a day, and was often heard to say that
</p>
<p>a table without them was no fit place for a gentleman to
</p>
<p>cross his legs under.
</p>
<p>He had a fine fund of humor  was fond of a good anec-
</p>
<p>dote, and enjoyed a joke upon himself as well as upon
</p>
<p>others. There was one, however, that he did not particu-
</p>
<p>larly relish. While Dr. Robert Simpson was sheriff of the

</p>
<p>county. Colonel Lawless remarked in court that the sheriff
</p>
<p>had used no exertion to subpoena his witnesses in a case.
</p>
<p>The sheriff took offense at this, and after the adjournment
</p>
<p>of the court attacked Lawless, when the latter, who was
</p>
<p>444 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>much larger and stouter than the little officer, knocked him
</p>
<p>down and gave him a severe whipping. While pommeling
</p>
<p>the doctor, Judge Carr came out and took Lawless off of him,
</p>
<p>and commanded the peace. At the opening of the court in
</p>
<p>the afternoon, the little, witty sheriff, with blackened eyes,
</p>
<p>and bleeding profusely, rose and apologized to the court for
</p>
<p>his conduct, saying he was only cJiiistising the big Inshman
</p>
<p>for his impudence in court.
</p>
<p>By reference to our sketch of Colonel Benton it will be
</p>
<p>seen that Judge Lawless acted as Benton's second in the
</p>
<p>unfortunate duel between him and Charles Lucas.
</p>
<p>Since writing the above we have been furnished with a
</p>
<p>copy of TJie Nation, a paper published in Dublin, Ireland.
</p>
<p>It bears date November 7, 1846, and contains a notice of the
</p>
<p>death of Colonel Lawless. It furnishes the best history of
</p>
<p>the professional and military life of this distinguished man
</p>
<p>that we have seen, and hence we give the extract verbatim :
</p>
<p>" We have this day to record the death of the Hon. Luke Edward Lawless,
</p>
<p>late judge of the Circuit Court of Missouri, in the United States. The de-
</p>
<p>ceased was the second son of the late Philip Lawless, of Warren Mount, in
</p>
<p>the county of Dublin, and grandson of the late John Lawless, of Shankill
</p>
<p>Castle, in the same county, Esq. He was born in 1781, and at an early age
</p>
<p>entered the British navy, in which service he continued until after the peace of
</p>
<p>Amiens, serving successively with Captain Beauman, Captain Downmar, and
</p>
<p>Sir Sidney Smith. On his return to Dublin, in 1802, he at once commenced to
</p>
<p>keep his terms for the purpose of going to the bar; to which profession he
</p>
<p>was accordingly called in Michaelmas term, 1805. Here he was quickly dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished, and was already commencing a career equally honorable and lucra-
</p>
<p>tive, w^hen his mind, like that of many another man at the same period, became
</p>
<p>filled with disgust at the unmerited humility of the position beyond which he
</p>
<p>and his fellow-Roman Catholics were, by the restriction laws then in force,
</p>
<p>forbidden to aspire, and with the belief that the obstacles presented by those
</p>
<p>laws to the rise of a Roman Catholic at the bar in Ireland to the higher sta-
</p>
<p>tions in the profession were, and would continue to be, insuperable. Actuated

</p>
<p>by those feelings, but contrary to the wish of his friends, he, in 1810, left his
</p>
<p>native country, and passing over to France was easily induced to enter the
</p>
<p>French, service, under the immediate command of his paternal uncle. General
</p>
<p>William Lawless. In this, as in his former profession, he soon became dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished ; and having for some time acted in the capacity of military secretary
</p>
<p>(for which position an almost universal knowledge of modern languages suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently qualified him) to the Due de Feltre, he was finally promoted to the rank
</p>
<p>of colonel. On the return of Napoleon from Elba, Luke Lawless composed
</p>
<p>LUKE E. LAWLESS. 445
</p>
<p>and read the address of congratulation from his regiment to the emperor.
</p>
<p>The final defeat of Napoleon, in 1815, compelled him once more to seek a
</p>
<p>new field for his exertions; and the love of republican institutions, at that
</p>
<p>time shared in by many of his countrymen, induced him to select the United
</p>
<p>States of America as his future home. He here adopted his former profes-
</p>
<p>sion of a lawyer, and his talents and extensive learning quickly acquired for
</p>
<p>him a distinguished reputation. After some years of most successful practice
</p>
<p>he was raised to the bench, and devoted to the service of the country of his
</p>
<p>adoption an ability and zeal which the bigoted principles of the existing laws
</p>
<p>prevented, in his case as in many others, from being available on behalf of his
</p>
<p>native land. Having for many years discharged the duties of his high office
</p>
<p>with credit to himself and the country of his birth, and satisfaction to that whose
</p>
<p>government thought him worthy of employment in their service, the honorable
</p>
<p>and learned gentleman departed this life on the 12th of September last, at St.
</p>
<p>Louis, in the state of Missouri. The bar of St. Louis have, in an unusual
</p>
<p>manner, as appears by a report of their proceedings on the 14th of September,
</p>
<p>which we subjoin, testified their admiration and respect for him as a judge, and
</p>
<p>their cordial affection for him as a brother barrister:
</p>
<p>" ' At a meeting of the St. Louis bar, held at the court-house, on the 14th of
</p>
<p>September, Nathaniel Holmes, Esq., called the meeting to order; and, on his

</p>
<p>family distinguished for their ardent attachment and services to the cause of
</p>
<p>republican freedom, from his earliest manhood he exhibited, with the most

<p>and opinions of the day, both in this country and in I'.urope, was peculiarly

</p>
<p>PETER B. MCCORD.
</p>
<p>In 1848 we made a successful canvass for Congress in the
</p>
<p>then Second District of Missouri. While filling an appoint-
</p>
<p>ment to address the people of Osage County, at Linn, we
</p>
<p>met the above-named gentleman, who was a resident lawyer
</p>
<p>at that place, and he impressed us favorably as a modest, un-
</p>
<p>assuming, agreeable gentleman. A better acquaintance not
</p>
<p>only confirmed our impression of him, but we soon learned
</p>
<p>that he was a lawyer who had studied his profession well.
</p>
<p>Mr. McCord was born at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, January
</p>
<p>8, 1818, received a liberal education, and pursued his legal
</p>
<p>studies in the office of Ovid F. Johnson, of Philadelphia. In
</p>
<p>1839 he was admitted to the bar, and during the same year
</p>
<p>married Miss Mary Josephine Rhey, of Ebensburg, Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania. After practicing in Pennsylvania about five years, he
</p>
<p>moved, in the spring of 1844, to Missouri, and first settled in
</p>
<p>Callaway County, but during the following year made a per-
</p>
<p>manent location at Linn, in Osage County. There were but
</p>
<p>two resident lawyers at the place, but the bar of Jefferson
</p>
<p>City generally attended the Osage court, for Osage was in
</p>
<p>the Cole Circuit, and the attorney-general of the state was,
</p>
<p>ex officio, prosecuting attorney. There was nothing to pre-
</p>
<p>vent Mr. McCord from occupying an exalted position at the
</p>
<p>bar but his extreme diffidence and modesty, a quality rather
</p>
<p>rare in the profession, yet very commendable if not carried
</p>
<p>to excess. In Mr. McCord's case it engendered a want of
</p>
<p>confidence in himself, which destroyed his efficiency as a
</p>
<p>court lawyer and advocate. He never would take upon him-
</p>
<p>self the management of a case of any importance, and
</p>
<p>invariably called in assistant counsel. This natural diffi-
</p>
<p>dence kept him out of public life, and made him decline the
</p>
<p>appeals of his friends who frequently urged him to become a

<p>candidate for the Legislature. In 1874, however, his friends,
</p>
<p>PETER B. RrCORD. 449
</p>
<p>persuaded of his knowledge of the law, succeeded in getting
</p>
<p>his name before the people as a candidate for judge of the
</p>
<p>Ninth Judicial Circuit, and he was elected by a handsome
</p>
<p>majority, but before the time arrived for commencing the
</p>
<p>spring term of his courts he died at Linn. This occurred
</p>
<p>January 2, 1875. He left a wife and one son  the latter is
</p>
<p>at this time clerk of the Circuit Court of Osage County.
</p>
<p>Mr, McCord was a man of fine impulses, generous dis-
</p>
<p>position, unimpeachable character, and very sensitive and
</p>
<p>conscientious.
</p>
<p>In 1864 United States Senator Ramsey, of Iowa, who was
</p>
<p>his classmate, offered to procure for him the appointment of
</p>
<p>United States District Judge, which he declined, assigning
</p>
<p>as a reason that, being a Democrat, he could not consistently
</p>
<p>with his sense of propriety accept an appointment from a
</p>
<p>Republican administration.

<p>N. B. HOLDEN.
</p>
<p>Of the parentage and place of nativity of Mr. Holden we
</p>
<p>have no information whatever, though we have a vague im-
</p>
<p>pression that he was a Tennesseean. We served with him
</p>
<p>in the Missouri Legislature in 1846. He had but little edu-
</p>
<p>cation or refinement, and was very unprepossessing in ap-
</p>
<p>pearance.
</p>
<p>He must have commenced the practice in Missouri as
</p>
<p>early as 1840. He never acquired much reputation as a law-
</p>
<p>yer, though he was industrious and energetic. If we mistake
</p>
<p>not, he was at one time land agent or local attorney for the
</p>
<p>Pacific Railroad Company, and afterwards receiver of public
</p>
<p>money at Warsaw. As a speaker he was not wanting in flu-
</p>
<p>ency or sprightliness, but in his gesticulations he was awk-
</p>
<p>ward and ungainly. His head was constantly in motion, as
</p>
<p>though on a pivot, and he threw it about in every conceivable
</p>
<p>attitude. He had not been in the Legislature more than ten
</p>
<p>days before he became unpopular by incessant speaking, and
</p>
<p>interfering with the local bills of members. He had the van-
</p>
<p>ity to suppose that the House could not vote intelligently
</p>
<p>upon any question without first hearing his views. He prided
</p>
<p>himself upon his unterrified Democracy, and incurred the ill-
</p>
<p>will of the opposition members by his denunciations of their
</p>
<p>party. This is an error that young members of legislative
</p>
<p>bodies too frequently commit, and it invariably ends in mak-
</p>
<p>ing them odious.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holden was regarded as a man of integrity, and sus-
</p>
<p>tained a good moral character. He has been dead several

<p>years.
</p>
<p>Richard F. Richmond.
</p>
<p>This popular and eloquent lawyer was a native of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky  born in Franklin County about the year i8iO.
</p>
<p>His father, who was of English and French descent, was
</p>
<p>from Massachusetts, raised a mechanic, and carried on, at
</p>
<p>Chelsea, a large business as manufacturer of hemp and ship-
</p>
<p>cordage. His mother was from North Carolina, and of
</p>
<p>Scotch descent. Richard followed the occupation of his
</p>
<p>father, and at the age of eighteen obtained the credit of
</p>
<p>being the best rope-maker in Kentucky, except his father.
</p>
<p>He was one of eleven children, being the second child, and
</p>
<p>boasted that he was one of four brothers, who lived to reach
</p>
<p>maturity, who measured together twenty-five feet in height,
</p>
<p>he being six feet and two inches.
</p>
<p>At an early age he displayed a great fondness for reading,
</p>
<p>and all manly sports, such as hunting, fishing, riding, run-
</p>
<p>ning, and jumping, and few boys excelled him in either.
</p>
<p>Discovering in their son many promising traits of character,
</p>
<p>his parents sent liim to the best schools in the neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood, where he improved rapidly in his studies, and stood at
</p>
<p>the head of most of his classes. During most of the sum-
</p>
<p>mer he continued to work at his trade, and took much pride
</p>
<p>in it. He also took lessons in Latin and French under the
</p>
<p>tuition of a gentleman by the name of O'Hara, and a
</p>
<p>clergyman by the name of Fall. At this time he deter-
</p>
<p>mined to study law, and became a student in the office of
</p>
<p>Judge James S. Higgin, at Frankfort. He was then about
</p>
<p>twenty-one years of age. After studying with Judge Hig-
</p>
<p>gin two years, he entered the Transylvania Law School, at
</p>
<p>Lexington, remained there two years, and graduated in
</p>
<p>March, 1832. He then commenced the practice at Frank-
</p>
<p>fort in partnership with his old instructor, Judge Higgin,

<p>and, upon the death of the latter, became associated with
</p>
<p>452 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Benjamin F. Hickman, Esq., well known throughout Mis-
</p>
<p>souri as clerk of the United States Supreme Circuit and
</p>
<p>District Courts.
</p>
<p>We sliould have stated that Colonel Richmond, when a
</p>
<p>young man, manifested some partiality for a military life,
</p>
<p>joined a volunteer company in Kentucky, was made its cap-
</p>
<p>tain, and afterwards was promoted to the office of colonel
</p>
<p>of the regiment. In this way he acquired his military title,
</p>
<p>for he was always known, both in Kentucky and Missouri,
</p>
<p>as Colonel Dick Richmond.
</p>
<p>While in Kentucky he espoused the cause of the Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic party, became quite active as a politician, and con-
</p>
<p>tributed many articles for the Democratic press. In 1835 or
</p>
<p>1836 he went to Mississippi in company with George B.
</p>
<p>Crittenden, son of the late Hon. John J. Crittenden. They
</p>
<p>formed a partnership, and opened an office inVicksburg;
</p>
<p>but a general crash in all kinds of business took place, and
</p>
<p>Colonel Richmond returned to Frankfort and renewed his
</p>
<p>practice there, and soon obtained a good business. Shortly
</p>
<p>after his return to Frankfort he was nominated by the
</p>
<p>Democratic party for the Legislature, in opposition to the
</p>
<p>Whig nominee, Hon. Charles S. Morehead, who afterwards
</p>
<p>represented his district in Congress and became governor of
</p>
<p>the state.
</p>
<p>Both Richmond and Morehead being men of fine talents,
</p>
<p>and eloquent speakers, they met on the stump, and a most
</p>
<p>able and exciting canvass followed. The Whigs had a ma-
</p>
<p>jority in the county, and Mr. Morehead was elected by a
</p>
<p>small majority.
</p>
<p>Colonel Richmond married Mrs. Edmonia Barton, widow
</p>
<p>of John Barton, of Lexington, and daughter of Wood Haw-
</p>
<p>kins, of Frankfort. She was a lady of rare beauty and ac-
</p>
<p>complishments. In 1 84 1 Colonel Richmond moved to
</p>
<p>Hannibal, Missouri, where in the year following he lost his

<p>wife. After her death he seemed to lose all interest in his
</p>
<p>profession, and made no effort to procure business; in fact,
</p>
<p>what he did attend to was almost forced upon him.
</p>
<p>In 1844 we met him in the Legislature, he representing
</p>
<p>RICHARD F. RICHMOND. 453
</p>
<p>Marion County. We soon became well acquainted, for at
</p>
<p>the commencement of the session we met daily in private
</p>
<p>consultation on the then pending senatorial election. It was
</p>
<p>well known that some of the leaders of the Democratic party,
</p>
<p>who had become disaffected towards Colonel Benton, had
</p>
<p>formed a secret plan to defeat his election; but, unfortunately
</p>
<p>for their purpose, there were two senators to elect, one for
</p>
<p>the vacancy occasioned by the death of Dr. Linn, and the
</p>
<p>other for a full term. General David R. Atchison had been
</p>
<p>appointed by the governor in Dr. Linn's place, and was a
</p>
<p>candidate for the unexpired term, and Colonel Benton's
</p>
<p>friends were urging him for the long term. Although we never
</p>
<p>had any reason to suppose that General Atchison was in any-
</p>
<p>wise known to the conspiracy to defeat Colonel Benton, yet it
</p>
<p>was well understood that the most active of the opponents
</p>
<p>of Benton were the most devoted friends of Atchison. We
</p>
<p>speak advisedly when we say that the friends of Colonel
</p>
<p>Benton entertained no unkind feeling towards General Atchi-
</p>
<p>son, and were not disposed to make any opposition to his
</p>
<p>election, for he had made a good senator, and his two years'
</p>
<p>service had given general satisfaction ; but the Benton men
</p>
<p>in the Legislature, who, if not able to elect their favorite,
</p>
<p>could certainly dictate his successor, were determined that
</p>
<p>if the friends of Atchison defeated Benton, the former should
</p>
<p>fall with him. The Whig members had no other interest in
</p>
<p>the election than to throw their vote where it would be most
</p>
<p>likely to create division in the Democratic ranks. Caucus
</p>
<p>after caucus was held, and Colonel Richmond and the
</p>
<p>author, who were very active in the support of Benton, were
</p>
<p>in almost hourly consultation, which necessarily brought us
</p>
<p>in close intimacy at the opening of the session. Without
</p>
<p>going into detail, it is sufficient to remark that the opposing
</p>
<p>wings of the party came to an agreement to support both
</p>
<p>gentlemen, and the next night a general caucus was held in

</p>
<p>the Senate Chamber, and a resolution to support both was
</p>
<p>unanimously adopted. It was on this occasion that we first
</p>
<p>heard Colonel Richmond in debate, and his speech in behalf
</p>
<p>454 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>of Colonel Benton was one of the most eloquent efforts that
</p>
<p>ever fell from the lips of man.
</p>
<p>From that thiie he rose rapidly in public estimation, and
</p>
<p>was regarded as one of the most promising men of the state.
</p>
<p>At the close of the session he returned to Hannibal, and re-
</p>
<p>sumed the practice of his profession. He died many years
</p>
<p>ago.
</p>
<p>Of his family we have no knowledge, except one son,
</p>
<p>who died from consumption while studying law in the office
</p>
<p>of Lackland, Martin & Lackland, in St. Louis. We are
</p>
<p>under the impression he left no other children. His brother
</p>
<p>Joel is still engaged in the practice of the law at Hannibal.
</p>
<p>Colonel Richmond was very tall and thin, and his figure
</p>
<p>not much unlike Mr. Clay's. His voice was clear, distinct,
</p>
<p>and musical, and his gesticulation impressive and natural.'
</p>
<p>He could raise or lower his voice at will, and, when excited,
</p>
<p>would sometimes raise it from a low to a high pitch so sud-
</p>
<p>denly as to produce a thrill in his audience. He was, in fact,
</p>
<p>a natural-born orator, and if his habits through life had been
</p>
<p>studious, and free from dissipation, he must have attained a
</p>
<p>high position as a statesman. But, unfortunately, like most
</p>
<p>men of genius and free social intercourse, he contracted a
</p>
<p>habit which greatly impaired his usefulness and success in
</p>
<p>life, and brought him to an untimely grave. As a wit and
</p>
<p>humorist. Colonel Richmond had few equals.
</p>
<p>At one time he became so intemperate as to cause much
</p>
<p>anxiety among his friends, who, by a united and persistent
</p>
<p>effort, succeeded in inducing him to sign the pledge and join
</p>
<p>a temperance society. A man of his eloquence could not
</p>
<p>be otherwise than a great acquisition to the cause, hence at
</p>
<p>every meeting he was called upon for a speech. For some
</p>
<p>time he managed to escape upon various pretexts, but at last
</p>
<p>they pressed him so hard that he was forced to respond.
</p>
<p>Among the many pernicious effects of hard drinking, he

</p>
<p>referred to one which had often struck him very forcibly,
</p>
<p>and that was its tendency to shorten human life. Said he,
</p>
<p>" I knew a man in Kentuck}' by the name of Jacob Jones,
</p>
<p>RICHARD F. RICHMOND. 455
</p>
<p>who commenced drinking at the age of twenty, and was a
</p>
<p>hard drinker through Hfe, and died at the age of ninety-seven.
</p>
<p>Now," said he, " my friends, who can say that, if Jacob had
</p>
<p>Hved a sober, temperate Hfe, he might not have attained a
</p>
<p>good old age!'
</p>
<p>This was as well calculated to disturb the usual theory
</p>
<p>upon the subject of temperance as the anecdote told by Mr.
</p>
<p>Edwards upon Judge Cady, of New York, who was trying
</p>
<p>a case in one of the northern circuits.
</p>
<p>A witness by the name of Wood was examined, and at
</p>
<p>the close of his testimony the judge expressed a desire to
</p>
<p>ask him a few questions.
</p>
<p>" Certainly," said Wood.
</p>
<p>" How old are you, Mr. Wood ? "
</p>
<p>"I am seventy-six years of age."
</p>
<p>" May I ask you what have been your habits through life? "
</p>
<p>" My habits have been very regular. I have been very
</p>
<p>temperate. I don't think I could tell the different kinds of
</p>
<p>liquor by their taste, for I never drank intoxicating liquors.
</p>
<p>I have been in the habit of retiring early at night, and rising
</p>
<p>by daylight in the morning."
</p>
<p>The judge, who was noted for his temperance views, took
</p>
<p>occasion to deliver a short lecture to those in attendance, on
</p>
<p>the blessings arising from habits of industry, method, and
</p>
<p>especially of temperance.
</p>
<p>"You see this man," observed his honor, " at quite an
</p>
<p>advanced age, in possession of all his faculties, in good
</p>
<p>health, and you have heard the clear and intelligent manner
</p>
<p>in which he has given his testimony. Permit me to recom-
</p>
<p>mend him as an example which it might be well for many to
</p>
<p>follow."
</p>
<p>The next witness was also a Mr. Wood, brother of the
</p>
<p>model temperance man, and who also gave his testimony in
</p>
<p>a clear and intelligent manner. At its close Judge Cady

<p>also said to him :
</p>
<p>" If you have no objection, Mr. Wood, I would like to ask
</p>
<p>you a few questions similar to those I put to your brother."
</p>
<p>" Certainly."
</p>
<p>456 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI
</p>
<p>" How old are you, Mr. Wood ? "
</p>
<p>" I am seventy-eight years of age ; two years older than
</p>
<p>my brother."
</p>
<p>" What have been your habits through life?"
</p>
<p>" Well, judge, I can't say, as my brother has, that I have
</p>
<p>been regular in my habits, or temperate. To tell you the
</p>
<p>truth, judge, I have hardly seen a sober day. or been to bed
</p>
<p>sober, since I was a boy. I have been a hard drinker all
</p>
<p>through life." [A loud laugh from the bar. at the judge's
</p>
<p>expense.]
</p>
<p>" Well," exclaimed the judge, impatiently, " I don't see as
</p>
<p>it makes any difference with this Wood, whether it is wet or
</p>
<p>dry ! "
</p>
<p>Another anecdote of Colonel Richmond will illustrate his
</p>
<p>fondness for good humor. On his way to one of the courts
</p>
<p>in his circuit he fell in company with General J. and the
</p>
<p>late Judge Carty Wells, the former having but a slight ac-
</p>
<p>quaintance with the colonel, and knowing but little of his
</p>
<p>peculiarities. About a mile ahead of the party there was
</p>
<p>by the road-side a fine spring of water, at which the colonel
</p>
<p>had often stopped to refresh himself. He and the general
</p>
<p>belonged to different parties, and a warm political discussion
</p>
<p>arose between them, and, as they were near the spring, a very
</p>
<p>suitable place to get rid of the cobwebs in one's throat, the
</p>
<p>colonel pretended to be highly offended at a remark of the
</p>
<p>general's, and proposed that they should then and there set-
</p>
<p>tle it vi et arniis. The general was a brave and magnanimous
</p>
<p>man, and denied any intention of wounding the colonel's
</p>
<p>feelings, and made the proper amende, which, however,
</p>
<p>did not satisfy the colonel ; whereupon the general said, " If
</p>
<p>nothing else but a fight will satisfy you, sir, we will dismount
</p>
<p>and settle it at once." Both hitched their horses to a tree,
</p>
<p>took off their coats, and approached each other in a bellig-
</p>
<p>erent attitude, when the colonel remarked, "Stop a moment,"

</p>
<p>and, going to his saddle-bags, took out a quart flask filled with
</p>
<p>genuine old bourbon, and, presenting it to the general, said,
</p>
<p>" Sir, yoii shall have the first fire."
</p>
<p>Judge Ezra Hunt, of the Pike Circuit, was in the habit of
</p>
<p>RICHARD F. RICHMOND. 457
</p>
<p>drawing very fine distinctions respecting the meaning of
</p>
<p>words, and while Colonel Richmond was engaged in the ar-
</p>
<p>gument before him of a proposition involving the construc-
</p>
<p>tion of a statute, the judge remarked that no two words
</p>
<p>imported precisely the same thing ; whereupon the colonel
</p>
<p>asked him what was the difference between rooster and
</p>
<p>chicken-cock. The judge smilingly suggested that, if counsel
</p>
<p>would reduce his question to writing, he would take it under
</p>
<p>advisement.
</p>
<p>We could give other instances of Colonel Richmond's wit
</p>
<p>and humor, but these must suffice. He was not only fond of
</p>
<p>a good anecdote, but had a happy faculty of telling them.
</p>
<p>It has often occurred to us that the good humor which is
</p>
<p>generally found among members of the legal profession fur-
</p>
<p>nishes one reason for their tendency to long life. Chief Jus-
</p>
<p>tice Story said that every man ought to have an hour's laugh
</p>
<p>per day, as it materially assisted digestion. He, however,
</p>
<p>took to himself more than that allowance, and never entered
</p>
<p>a social circle without telling a good joke, or perpetrating a
</p>
<p>witticism. He often told the following anecdote upon Jona-
</p>

<p>Benjamin B. Dayton.
</p>
<p>This gentleman was but little known outside of the bar, for
</p>
<p>he was very retired in his habits, and devoted his whole time
</p>
<p>to his profession. He was born in the western part of New
</p>
<p>York about 1817, was a graduate of Union College, studied
</p>
<p>law with Addison Gardner, Esq., a lawyer of considerable
</p>
<p>eminence, and about 1838 moved to St. Louis, and com-
</p>
<p>menced the practice of the law in partnership with Fedinand
</p>
<p>W. Risk. Afterwards he entered into partnership with
</p>
<p>Henry S. Geyer, which continued until the latter was elected
</p>
<p>to the United States Senate. About 1843 or 1844 Mr. Day-
</p>
<p>ton married Miss Mary Jennings, of Philadelphia. No chil-
</p>
<p>dren were born of the marriage, and at his death, which was
</p>
<p>occasioned by the Gasconade Bridge disaster, in November,
</p>
<p>1855, his widow returned to Philadelphia ; whether she still
</p>
<p>survives we are unable to state. Mr. Dayton was tall, spare
</p>
<p>made, and had dark hair and complexion, with very uniform
</p>
<p>features. His countenance was grave, and indicated much
</p>
<p>thought and close study. He was regarded by the profes-
</p>
<p>sion generally as a well-read and thorough lawyer. We heard
</p>
<p>him on several occasions address the court in the argument
</p>
<p>of legal questions. His mind was altogether logical, and his
</p>
<p>delivery graceful and easy. The firm of Geyer & Dayton
</p>
<p>did a very large business, and were retained in most of the im-
</p>
<p>portant land suits. Mr. Dayton's close attention to business
</p>
<p>greatly impaired his health, which at all times was very deli-
</p>
<p>cate, and it is not probable that he would have lived long,
</p>
<p>even if he had been spared the tragic death which so sud-
</p>
<p>denly terminated his life.
</p>
<p>He never held, or aspired to, any public position, his only

</p>
<p>most exemplary habits, and for many years was vestryman

<p>in the Episcopal Church. He exhibited much interest in the

<p>growth and advancement of St. Louis, and contributed freely
</p>
<p>to all objects of charity and benevolence. He left a good

<p>estate, but no children to enjoy it.
</p>
<p>Philip L. Edwards.
</p>
<p>In 1842 the Democracy of Franklin County, and no incon-
</p>
<p>siderable portion of the Whig party, conceived the strange
</p>
<p>idea that we might be of some service to the county in
</p>
<p>the General Assembly of the state, and without any
</p>
<p>solicitation on our part elected us to a seat in that body.
</p>
<p>It was certainly a high compliment to a young and inexpe-
</p>
<p>rienced attorney, and though not concurring in the wisdom
</p>
<p>of their choice, we felt no disposition to make a factiotis re-
</p>
<p>sistance.
</p>
<p>Among those who then for the first time took their seats in
</p>
<p>a deliberative body was the gentleman whose name is above.
</p>
<p>He represented the county of Ray. We made his acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance during the first week of the session, and found him a
</p>
<p>modest, retiring, and unassuming gentleman, with dignified
</p>
<p>manners, and a countenance indicating a high order of intel-
</p>
<p>lect. He was tall and spare made, and seemed to be labor-
</p>
<p>ing under much physical disability. Upon the first question
</p>
<p>which came before the House, and which gave rise to de-
</p>
<p>bate, he made a brief speech of fifteen or twenty minutes,
</p>
<p>which attracted much attention, not only from his apparent
</p>
<p>knowledge of his subject, but from his fine oratorical display.
</p>
<p>Upon several other occasions during the session he addressed
</p>
<p>the House, and obtained the reputation of being one of the
</p>
<p>finest declaimers in either house of the General Assembly.
</p>
<p>He spoke with great fluency, and his clear and distinct
</p>
<p>enunciation made him readily heard from all parts of the hall.
</p>
<p>We never saw Mr. Edwards after the close of that session,
</p>
<p>but understood that he became a prominent and successful
</p>
<p>lawyer in the North Grand River country.
</p>
<p>If we mistake not, he was a native of Missouri and his
</p>
<p>father was a farmer. He received a good English educa-

<p>tion, and was admitted to the bar in the spring of 1839, and
</p>
<p>PHILIP L. EDWARDS. 46 1
</p>
<p>commenced the practice in Richmond, Ray County. Con-
</p>
<p>temporary with him was that distinguished jurist, Hon.
</p>
<p>George W. Dunn, who now presides over a judicial circuit.
</p>
<p>Ray County has always had a strong bar, and embraced such
</p>
<p>men as Austin A. King, George W. Dunn, Ephraim B. Ew-
</p>
<p>ing, and others whose names do not now occur to us. To
</p>
<p>succeed among men of such acknowledged ability was an
</p>
<p>evidence of high professional skill.
</p>
<p>Mr. Edwards married a daughter of Dr. Thomas Allen, of
</p>
<p>Ray County, and sister of Mrs. Judge E. B. Ewing. In 1852
</p>
<p>his health became so feeble as to render a change of climate
</p>
<p>necessary, and he removed with his family to California,
</p>
<p>where he devoted himself to his profession and took rank
</p>
<p>among the first lawyers of that state. He died in California

</p>
<p>about 1873.
</p>
<p>James B. Bowlin.
</p>
<p>Among the most noted public men in Missouri at the time
</p>
<p>we came West was James Butler Bowlin, a native of Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, and born near Fredericksburg, on January i6, 1804.
</p>
<p>His father was also a native of Virginia, but his mother was
</p>
<p>born in England, and came to the United States with her
</p>
<p>parents when she was a child. They lived and died in
</p>
<p>Alexandria. After the marriage of the child to Mr. Bowlin,
</p>
<p>the latter took up his residence in Rockingham County,
</p>
<p>where James B. Bowlin spent most of his boyhood.
</p>
<p>Judge Bowlin received an ordinary English education,
</p>
<p>and before reaching his majority took charge of a country
</p>
<p>school in the neighborhood of Harrisonburg. In August,
</p>
<p>1825, he removed to Levvisburg, Greenbrier County, where
</p>
<p>he entered upon the study of the law with a Mr. Wethered,
</p>
<p>and on December 17, 1826, was licensed to practice.
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1828 he was elected a member of the State
</p>
<p>Internal Improvement Convention, from Greenbrier County,
</p>
<p>having commenced the practice of the law in Lewisburg.
</p>
<p>At this Convention, which met at Charlottsville, he became
</p>
<p>acquainted with many of the most prominent men of Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, including Madison, Monroe, and Marshall, and here,
</p>
<p>no doubt, was inspired with an ambition to become a public
</p>
<p>man, for the next year he became a candidate for the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature, and, although receiving an honorable vote, was de-
</p>
<p>feated. In 1833 he again became a candidate, and was, no
</p>
<p>doubt, fairly elected, though the vote was " exceedingly
</p>
<p>close ; but the returning board, consisting of three magis-
</p>
<p>trates, being politically opposed to him, awarded the certifi-
</p>
<p>cate of election to his opponent, which so discouraged him
</p>
<p>that he determined to take up his abode in the far West,
</p>
<p>and in October of the same year came to St. Louis and

</p>
<p>opened a law-office, where he had to compete with such
</p>
<p>JAMES B. BOW LIN. 463
</p>
<p>men as Geyer, Bates, Gamble, Spalding, Lawless, Darby, and
</p>
<p>Allen, men who had already acquired distinction in the pro-
</p>
<p>fession. Although a stranger, and without means, he made
</p>
<p>friends rapidly, and soon entered upon a fair practice, but, like
</p>
<p>most young men of that day, soon embarked in politics, and
</p>
<p>established a paper called the Far^ners and Mechanics Ad-
</p>
<p>vocate, which became the foundation of a permanent Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic journal, and afterwards assumed the name of the
</p>
<p>Missouri Argus. While editing this paper he was elected
</p>
<p>chief clerk of the House of Representatives. After the ad-
</p>
<p>journment of the Legislature he entered upon his practice
</p>
<p>with renewed zeal, but in 1836 became a candidate for the
</p>
<p>Legislature, and was the only one elected on his ticket,
</p>
<p>though there were five other candidates running witli him.
</p>
<p>In 1837 he was appointed district attorney for St. Louis, but
</p>
<p>the duties of the office so much interfered with his general
</p>
<p>practice that he resigned it, and was soon after appointed
</p>
<p>attorney for the State Bank. In 1838 he again became a
</p>
<p>candidate for the State Legislature, and his entire ticket was
</p>
<p>defeated.
</p>
<p>The accumulation of business in the courts of St. Louis
</p>
<p>rendered it necessary to organize a separate tribunal for the
</p>
<p>transaction of criminal business, and Mr. Bowlin was elected
</p>
<p>its judge by the joint vote of the two houses of the General
</p>
<p>Assembly, which office he filled for about six years. In
</p>
<p>1842 he was elected to Congress from the St. Louis District,
</p>
<p>and reelected for three additional successive terms, in the
</p>
<p>last of which we became his colleague. In 1854 President
</p>
<p>Polk appointed him minister resident to New Granada, and
</p>
<p>in 1858 he received from Mr. Buchanan the appointment of
</p>
<p>commissioner to Paraguay.
</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that Judge Bowlin filled all the public
</p>
<p>positions, and enjoyed all the public honors, that any reason-
</p>
<p>able ambition could aspire to.

<p>Much of Judge Bowlin's success in life must be attributed
</p>
<p>to his fortunate marriage with Miss Colburn, a lady of fine
</p>
<p>personal appearance, most attractive manners, and of the
</p>
<p>highest order of intellect. In the zenith of the judge's

</p>
<p>prosperity his house was a favorite resort of the prominent
</p>
<p>men of the state when they visited the city, and often have
</p>
<p>we called in to pass a pleasant hour when it seemed as if she
</p>
<p>was holding a levee. She still lives to mourn his loss. The
</p>
<p>judge died in St. Louis, July 19, 1874.
</p>
<p>Probably the most important part of Judge Bowlin's pro-
</p>
<p>fessional career was when he presided as judge of the Crimi-
</p>
<p>nal Court. The city was almost given up to mob-law and
</p>
<p>violence, and murder, robbery, and arson reigned supreme.
</p>
<p>At this time, also, the trials of Darnes for the killing of
</p>
<p>Davis, and Walker for the killing of Farr, came before him,
</p>
<p>and as the prisoners, as well as the deceased, came from the
</p>
<p>highest walks of life, the greatest excitement prevailed, and
</p>
<p>the court-house was daily crowded with the friends of each,
</p>
<p>well armed and ready for a conflict. It was a trying time
</p>
<p>for Judge Bowlin, and required great coolness, nerve, and
</p>
<p>determination; but he was equal to the occasion, and passed
</p>
<p>the ordeal with great credit, and with an increased reputa-
</p>
<p>tion as a jurist.
</p>
<p>Judge Bowlin was a man of untiring energy, and, had he
</p>
<p>confined himself to his profession, would have ranked with
</p>
<p>the ablest lawyers of the West ; but his taste and ambition
</p>
<p>led him into political life, and the law was too jealous a mis-
</p>
<p>tress to permit him to divide his attentions between the two.
</p>
<p>He was a large, athletic man, capable of great endurance
</p>
<p>and any amount of mental labor, and when he undertook
</p>
<p>anything, was very apt to succeed, particularly if energy and
</p>
<p>tenacity could lead to success. As before stated, he made
</p>
<p>friends rapidly, and always held them, for lie was kind-
</p>
<p>hearted, benevolent, and trusting, and, though an ardent and
</p>
<p>active politician, never intentionally wounded the feelings of
</p>
<p>any one. In Congress he was very popular, which enabled
</p>
<p>him to render valuable service to his state and constituents,
</p>
<p>and, like General Blair, he could carry almost any measure

</p>
<p>which did not involve a sacrifice of principle or party. In
</p>
<p>his intercourse with the people he was social, genial, and
</p>
<p>pleasant, and always able, when running for office, to secure
</p>
<p>more than the legitimate strength of his party.
</p>
<p>JAMES B. BOW LIN. 465
</p>
<p>Judge Bovvlin was not an orator, and never attempted any
</p>
<p>display in that field, yet was a fluent and impressive speaker,
</p>
<p>and on the stump a dangerous man to encounter, as he was
</p>
<p>thoroughly posted in political history, and was always well
</p>
<p>armed with facts and figures.
</p>
<p>Judge Bowlin's diplomatic career in South America was
</p>
<p>attended with much benefit to his government, particularly in
</p>
<p>the advancement of our commercial relations. As an evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the high estimation in which he was held by the
</p>
<p>ruling power there, we mention the fact that the president of
</p>
<p>Paraguay tendered him, as a present, a beautiful snuff-box
</p>
<p>studded with valuable diamonds, estimated to be worth about
</p>
<p>^4,000, which the judge had to decline, as our ministers and
</p>
<p>agents abroad are not permitted to receive gifts from foreign
</p>
<p>powers ; but the donor was determined that he should have
</p>
<p>it, and sent it to Washington to be presented after the expira-
</p>
<p>tion of his official service. It is now held by his widow as
</p>
<p>a family relic, and is placed in the Safe-Depository of St,
</p>
<p>Louis for safe-keeping.
</p>
<p>Judge Bowlin had but one child, a daughter, who married
</p>
<p>General Jenkins of the Confederate army. They resided in
</p>
<p>Western Virginia, and during the war the judge spent most
</p>
<p>of his time there. He never returned to the profession after
</p>
<p>he came from South America,
</p>
<p>We have in several instances alluded to the custom of
</p>
<p>holding bar-meetings upon the death of a member. These
</p>
<p>are often cold, formal, and unfeeling. But not so in the case
</p>
<p>of Judge Bowlin, for though he had been declining in health
</p>
<p>for several years, and his dissolution had been anticipated,
</p>
<p>yet his death brought together an unusually large number of
</p>
<p>the bar, embracing all the old members who had practiced
</p>
<p>with him, and many of the junior members who had made
</p>
<p>his acquaintance late in life. Hon. L. V Bogy, late United
</p>
<p>States senator for Missouri, presided over the meeting, and

<p>delivered a beautiful tribute to his memory. He was fol-

</p>
<p>of the ability and virtues of their deceased brother. Among
</p>
<p>the resolutions adopted at the meeting were the following :
</p>
<p>^'Resolved, That, in the death of Judge James B. Bowlin, St. Louis has lost
</p>
<p>one of her best citizens, and Missouri one of her ablest and most faithful public
</p>
<p>servants ; a man whose life illuminated and illustrated the pages of our history
</p>
<p>during more than the third of a century, and whose acts, whether as public officer
</p>
<p>or private citizen, were intimately associated with our past progress and prosper-
</p>
<p>ity ; a man of clear and discriminating mind, noble aspirations, and indomitable
</p>
<p>energy, who, whether in the pul)lic councils of the state or nation, or as a min-
</p>
<p>ister to foreign powers, reflected equal honor upon himself and his country;
</p>
<p>one who was self-taught, self-made, self-reliant, yet unselfish and public-spirited
</p>
<p>in his whole course ; in short, a man who contjuered success in life and won
</p>
<p>an honorable place in history by his distinguished power of thought and action,
</p>
<p>and tireless persistence in the labors of his life.
</p>
<p>'^Resolved, That while the city and state mourn the loss of an able, honest,
</p>
<p>and faithful public servant, society loses one of its most worthy and distin-
</p>
<p>guished members, his immediate associates an ever-honored and warmly-cher-
</p>
<p>ished friend, and his relatives the one most beloved and revered of all their
</p>
<p>number.
</p>
<p>''Resolved, That while we tender to the family of the deceased our warm
</p>
<p>sympathies and sincere condolence, we bid them to rejoice with us in the rec-
</p>
<p>ord of a long and honorable career that gives promise of a better life beyond."
</p>
<p>We attended the funeral of the deceased, in company with
</p>
<p>a large body of his friends, and witnessed the impressive ser-
</p>
<p>vices conducted by the Rev. Dr. Berkley, rector of St. Pe-
</p>
<p>ter's Episcopal Church. The remains were followed by a

<p>very long funeral cortege to Bellefontaine Cemetery.
</p>
<p>Timothy Davis.
</p>
<p>It is very questionable if there is a person now living who
</p>
<p>has any recollection of this gentleman. He came to Jack-
</p>
<p>son, in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, in 1818, and
</p>
<p>opened a law-office at that place. He came from Canada,
</p>
<p>or the northern part of New York, and was well read in his
</p>
<p>profession. The late Greer W. Davis studied law with him
</p>
<p>one year. He only remained about eighteen months in
</p>
<p>Jackson, when he moved to St. Genevieve, where he accumu-
</p>
<p>lated some property and then moved into Iowa. He was
</p>
<p>sent to Congress from that state, but whether one or two
</p>
<p>terms we are unable to state. He was a man of fine natural
</p>
<p>ability, but awkward and unprepossessing in his manners.
</p>
<p>It was said that he argued a question of law with consider-
</p>
<p>able force, but he remained too short a time in Missouri to
</p>
<p>obtain much reputation in his profession. He speculated
</p>
<p>considerably in real estate, and turned his attention to other
</p>
<p>modes of making money besides the law, which was not
</p>
<p>uncommon with the early territorial lawyers. His character

</p>
<p>JOHN D. COALTER.
</p>
<p>Few men at tlie St. Louis or St. Charles bar were more
</p>
<p>universally esteemed than General Coalter, who obtained his
</p>
<p>military title by services rendered in the state militia. He
</p>
<p>was a brother of Mrs. Hamilton R. Gamble and Mrs. Edward
</p>
<p>Bates, and was born in South Carolina in 1818, and when a
</p>
<p>small boy came with his parents to Missouri. The family
</p>
<p>settled in St. Charles County, and John was sent to the South
</p>
<p>Carolina College, where he obtained his education. He then
</p>
<p>returned to St. Louis and entered upon the study of the
</p>
<p>law, and in due time was admitted to the bar. He com-
</p>
<p>menced the practice in St. Charles, and became one of the
</p>
<p>most successful lawyers at that bar. He frequently repre-
</p>
<p>sented St. Charles County in the General Assembly, and it
</p>
<p>was said that he could go to the Legislature whenever he
</p>
<p>desired, no matter which party was in the ascendant. We
</p>
<p>knew him well from 1840 till his death, which took place in
</p>
<p>St. Louis in 1864. While all who knew him will admit that
</p>
<p>he was a sound, well-read, and reliable lawyer, yet those who
</p>
<p>knew him best will appreciate the difficulty of assigning him
</p>

</p>
<p>it can be called, to be a man of ample estate, and hence not
</p>
<p>driven to professional labor by the ordinary necessities of
</p>
<p>life. Nor was he stimulated by a desire to obtain distinction
</p>
<p>or reputation, consequently he rather avoided than sought
</p>
<p>practice. He only went into the courts when urged by his
</p>
<p>friends, or when called upon by some old client who would
</p>
<p>not dispense with his services.
</p>
<p>He eschewed office and had very little respect for chronic
</p>
<p>office-seekers, and never accepted any public position which
</p>
<p>he could consistently decline. After the election of Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln he was appointed a delegate from Missouri to the

<p>Convention held at Washington City to devise ways and
</p>
<p>JOHN D. CO ALTER. 4^9
</p>
<p>means to avoid the threatened danger to the country. He
</p>
<p>discharged his duty Hke a true patriot, and, returning home,
</p>
<p>issued an address to the people giving an account of his
</p>
<p>stewardship, and warning his countrymen against any viola-
</p>
<p>tion of law, or hostility to the government. The State Con-
</p>
<p>stitutional Convention was then in session, and by a resolu-
</p>
<p>tion requested him to address them, which he complied
</p>
<p>with. We give an extract from this address, to show the dif-
</p>
<p>ficulties under which he labored, and the candor with which
</p>
<p>he expressed his views :
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen ok the Convention : My colleague has very properly stated
</p>
<p>to you that he felt how important was the occasion which had called us to-
</p>
<p>gether in Washington. We felt the condition of the country was such that
</p>
<p>peace was needed, in order to bring about any good and valuable results. We
</p>
<p>were met there by distinguished gentlemen from every part of the Union  twen-
</p>
<p>ty-one states in all  and we found one great difficulty in the beginning, and that
</p>
<p>was that gentlemen from the North-west had come to the Convention thinking
</p>
<p>themselves pledged to a particular platform, and in other ways. They thought
</p>
<p>they had gained a great victory, and they must reap the fruits of it. That
</p>
<p>seemed the prevailing sentiment. They said, ' We are well satisfied to have
</p>
<p>peace, yet it must be peace on our own terms ; and although we are willing, yet
</p>
<p>we tell you at the same time that we abhor your institutions.' Well, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, when any of us could get the floor, we defended our institutions with
</p>
<p>what ability was at our command.
</p>
<p>" We told them, ' This is a prejudice on your part. Your hostility to sla-
</p>
<p>very has prejudiced you, and the sooner you get rid of that prejudice the bet-
</p>
<p>ter.' We asked them, moreover, the pregnant question, ' If you abhor our
</p>
<p>institutions, how long a step will it be before you abhor tis ? If you abhor
</p>
<p>slavery, how long before you abhor slaveholders ?' This we represented to
</p>
<p>them was the very point which had aroused the Southern mind. It was the
</p>
<p>idea that they were hostile to us in feeling, and this hostility could not be
</p>
<p>reconciled, but would show itself again and again, and produce perpetual
</p>
<p>dissensions. * * *
</p>
<p>" We said, ' Do not let us, in view of this object, quarrel about little things ;

</p>
<p>do not let us disagree on minor points ; do not cavil with us upon the ninth part
</p>
<p>of the breadth of a hair  but show us at once by your actions that you do
</p>
<p>recognize the rights of the South. The people of the South, of which Missouri
</p>
<p>is a part, want to understand whether they can live in peace with you or not.
</p>
<p>If there is any settled hostility on the part of the North against the South, then
</p>
<p>we are two people inevitably ; and God forbid we should be two people. We
</p>
<p>desire union; we desire this Union shall subsist; but we want to understand
</p>
<p>that you are not hostile to us, and, therefore, we ask you to come forward in the
</p>
<p>spirit of liberality  of magnanimity, if you choose (because you are the victori-
</p>
<p>ous party)  and grant what is liberal, and grant it freely and frankly.' "

</p>
<p>General Coalter then proceeded, in a clear and forcible
</p>
<p>manner, to point out the difficulties attending their efforts to
</p>
<p>bring about a happy understanding between the two sections
</p>
<p>of the country.
</p>
<p>Had General Coalter devoted himself to the law, he would
</p>
<p>undoubtedly have attained considerable renown, for he had
</p>
<p>a well-trained mind, and managed his cases with much skill
</p>
<p>and adroitness. We had ample evidence of this, for we were
</p>
<p>associated with him in the prosecution of Worrill, who was
</p>
<p>tried and executed in Franklin County for the murder of
</p>
<p>Gordon. It was one of the most remarkable criminal cases
</p>
<p>ever tried in the West. Worrill was the only son and child
</p>
<p>of Dr. Worrill, of Dover, Delaware, and his motlier was a
</p>
<p>sister of Major Ringgold, who fell at Corpus Christi in the
</p>
<p>early part of the Mexican War.
</p>
<p>He was a sergeant in the army, stationed at Fort Leaven-
</p>
<p>worth, and became a deserter. On his way to St. Louis, by
</p>
<p>the Boonslick Road, riding horseback, he fell in, at Danville,
</p>
<p>Montgomery County, w ith Gordon, an engineer of the North
</p>
<p>Missouri Railroad, on his way to St. Louis. Though stran-
</p>
<p>gers to each other, they traveled together, and remained over-
</p>
<p>night at a small tavern in Warren Count)\
</p>
<p>Worrill learned that Gordon had been up the line of the
</p>
<p>road, and supposed he had money with him, collected from
</p>
<p>some of the counties through which the road was being con-
</p>
<p>structed, and determined to get possession of it b}^ murder-
</p>
<p>ing him. Gordon was also an only child  a very strange
</p>
<p>coincidence.
</p>
<p>When they left the tavern the next morning it was snow-
</p>
<p>ing, and had been snowing during most of the night and day
</p>
<p>before. After proceeding half a mile they came to a hazel
</p>
<p>thicket, half a mile wide, and Gordon never came out of it
</p>
<p>alive. He had parted at Danville with the president and one
</p>
<p>of the engineers of the road, who proceeded to Jefferson

</p>
<p>City, and on returning to St. Louis, a week afterwards, were
</p>
<p>surprised to find that Gordon had not returned, and, becom-
</p>
<p>ing alarmed, sent several persons up the road to ascertain
</p>
<p>what had become of him.
</p>
<p>JOHN D. CO ALTER. 47 1
</p>
<p>They traced him from Danville to the inn above mentioned,
</p>
<p>and learned that Worrill was seen to emerge from the hazel
</p>
<p>thicket, riding a horse and leading another, which satisfied
</p>
<p>them that Gordon was murdered in some part of the thicket.
</p>
<p>Several days were spent in the search for his body, and as
</p>
<p>they had begun to despair of finding it, one of them noticed
</p>
<p>a small fice dog scratching in the snow, about the center of
</p>
<p>the road, and, going to the place, found blood, which they
</p>
<p>traced to a small ravine about fifteen feet from the road,
</p>
<p>where they found his body covered with brush and snow,
</p>
<p>and a hole through his head, as if made by a large pistol-
</p>
<p>ball, and his pockets turned inside out.
</p>
<p>Worrill had been seen to pass through St. Charles, lead-
</p>
<p>ing a horse corresponding to that of Gordon's. He went
</p>
<p>to St. Louis, remained there three days, attending the thea-
</p>
<p>ter each night, and then traveled horseback to Vincennes,
</p>
<p>Indiana.
</p>
<p>A published description of the deserter from Leaven-
</p>
<p>worth corresponded with the man seen leading Gordon's
</p>
<p>horse through St. Charles, and Chief of Police Cozens
</p>
<p>started for Vincennes in pursuit of him, and there learned
</p>
<p>that Worrill had traded Gordon's horse to the proprietor of
</p>
<p>a hotel, as well as other articles of Gordon's.
</p>
<p>From this point all trace of the murderer was lost for
</p>
<p>several days, but Mr. Cozens again got on the track of him,
</p>
<p>traced him to Baltimore, and from thence to Dover, in Dela-
</p>
<p>ware, where his father resided. Cozens saw him during the
</p>
<p>day, at the hotel, but was afraid then to arrest him, as he had
</p>
<p>many friends who would undoubtedly have rescued him.
</p>
<p>It was, therefore, determined to take him at night in his bed
</p>
<p>at the hotel where he was stopping, place him on a hand-
</p>
<p>car and take him to Smyrna, a distance of twelve miles, and
</p>
<p>there await the train for the West. Having made all neces-
</p>
<p>sary arrangements. Cozens entered his room at two o'clock

</p>
<p>in the morning, approached his bed, gagged him so he could
</p>
<p>not sound an alarm, and took him to the hand-car, which
</p>
<p>was in waiting, and started westward. On a chair near his
</p>
<p>bed the saddle-bags of Gordon were found, and in his

<p>pocket Gordon's watch They boarded the train at Smyrna,
</p>
<p>and Cozens with his prisoner were rapidly going West before
</p>
<p>Worrill was missed at the hotel.
</p>
<p>These i^w facts  and they constitute but a few  are only
</p>
<p>mentioned to give the reader some idea of the case.
</p>
<p>A change of venue was taken to Franklin County. Major
</p>
<p>Uriel Wright appeared for the prisoner, and placed his de-
</p>
<p>fense upon two grounds :
</p>
<p>1. That the evidence, which was only circumstantial, did
</p>
<p>not show, to the exclusion of every other hypothesis, that
</p>
<p>the prisoner committed the deed.
</p>
<p>2. That if he did commit the homicide it was while labor-
</p>
<p>ing under insanity.
</p>
<p>To sustain the latter, depositions had been taken in
</p>
<p>Leavenworth, Delaware, Kentucky, and other places.
</p>
<p>We were two weeks trying him, and Major Wright made
</p>
<p>one of the greatest efforts of his life to save him ; but he
</p>
<p>was convicted, and executed in an open field in presence of
</p>
<p>10,000 people, his parents standing at the foot of the gal-
</p>
<p>lows as he swung off Taking everything into considera-
</p>
<p>tion, it was one of the most interesting and tragical cases in
</p>
<p>the annals of crime, and created an exciting interest
</p>
<p>throughout the state. Although the final argument to the
</p>
<p>jury in behalf of the state was committed to us, yet it is due
</p>
<p>to General Coalter to state that the credit of the conviction
</p>
<p>was due to him, for he prepared the case, collected the testi-
</p>
<p>mony, and conducted the examination of the witnesses with
</p>
<p>the most consummate skill. It was the only case in which we
</p>
<p>ever saw General Coalter engaged, but in that he displayed
</p>
<p>the highest order of legal ability.
</p>
<p>General Coalter made no pretensions to oratory, yet was
</p>
<p>a forcible, clear, and lucid speaker, and impressed a jury
</p>
<p>most favorably. It is stated by those who practiced with
</p>
<p>him at the St. Charles bar that he prepared his cases with

</p>
<p>much care, though he tried them in that free and off-hand
</p>
<p>manner which did not indicate his previous labor. In social
</p>
<p>life he was one of the kindest and most agreeable men we
</p>
<p>ever knew. It is questionable whether he ever had an
</p>
<p>JOHN D. CO ALTER. 473
</p>
<p>enemy, while his friends could be numbered by the
</p>
<p>thousand.
</p>
<p>General Coalter had a fund of good humor, which often
</p>
<p>excited considerable mirth. He and Dr. M., a most worthy
</p>
<p>citizen of St. Charles County, were once opposing candi-
</p>
<p>dates for the Legislature, and canvassed the county together
</p>
<p>in a very friendly way, but at the close of the canvass the doc-
</p>
<p>tor got a little cross, and spoke harshly and unkindly of his
</p>
<p>opponent. But the general, in reply, remarked "that the doc-
</p>
<p>tor was not half as big a rascal as the people supposed he was."
</p>
<p>This complimentary defense of the doctor created a great
</p>
<p>laugh, in which the doctor participated as much as any of
</p>
<p>them, and the two rode home together the best of friends.
</p>
<p>This reminds us of the defense interposed in behalf of a
</p>
<p>witness who was terribly slashed by one of the counsel in a
</p>
<p>case. Said the interceder, " Come, come, you have always
</p>
<p>been too hard on that man. He is by no means so bad a
</p>
<p>fellow as you would make him out. I do verily believe that
</p>
<p>in the whole course of his life that man never told a lie  out
</p>
<p>of the zvitness-box."

<p>Beverly allen.
</p>
<p>The Old Dominion has been very proHfic of statesmen
</p>
<p>and lawyers, and has sent no small number to the Western
</p>
<p>States. Among the latter was Beverly Allen, the compeer of
</p>
<p>Geyer, Gamble, Bates, Darby, and Spalding. He was born
</p>
<p>in Richmond in 1800, and, after receiving his preliminary edu-
</p>
<p>cation in the common schools of his native county, entered
</p>
<p>Princeton College and there graduated with honor. Imme-
</p>
<p>diately afterwards he commenced the study of the law in the
</p>
<p>office of that distinguished jurist Judge Upshur.
</p>
<p>That he availed himself of so good an opportunity to ob-
</p>
<p>tain a knowledge of the profession upon which he had set his
</p>
<p>heart is evidenced by the fact that, when he came to St. Louis
</p>
<p>in 1827, he brought with him, from Judge Upshur and others,
</p>
<p>the highest testimonials of faithfulness and ability. Before
</p>
<p>coming to St. Louis he went to St. Genevieve and concluded
</p>
<p>to locate there  in fact, became the law-partner of John Scott,
</p>
<p>then a lawyer of very high repute; but he soon became satis-
</p>
<p>fied that St. Louis promised a better field for the practice, and
</p>
<p>accordingly changed his residence. At one time he became
</p>
<p>the law-partner of the late Governor Gamble, but we are not
</p>
<p>aware of his forming any other partnership. Mr. Allen held,
</p>
<p>under appointment of President Adams, the office of United
</p>
<p>States district attorney, but, when General Jackson became
</p>
<p>president, was removed because he was not politically in ac-
</p>
<p>cord with the Administration, for no charge was made against
</p>
<p>him, and could not be, as he proved an able and faithful officer.
</p>
<p>Mr. Allen also filled the positions of city attorney, member
</p>
<p>of the City Council, and for a period represented the city and
</p>
<p>county of St. Louis in the State Legislature. In all these
</p>
<p>positions he was faithful, diligent, and influential, and enjoyed
</p>
<p>the unlimited confidence of the people of his adopted city.

<p>Mr. Allen never would permit any other calling or vocation
</p>
<p>BEVERLY ALLEN. 475
</p>
<p>to draw him from the active pursuit of his profession, though
</p>
<p>in 1838 he accepted from the Whig party a nomination for
</p>
<p>Congress, and canvassed the state in opposition to Albert G.
</p>
<p>Harrison, the Democratic nominee. Missouri had not then
</p>
<p>adopted the district system, and Mr. Allen was forced to
</p>
<p>address the people in all parts of the state. He received the
</p>
<p>full vote of his part}', but the Democratic majority in the
</p>
<p>state was too large to overcome. It was on this occasion
</p>
<p>that we first saw Mr. Allen, and heard him speak. He
</p>
<p>seemed to have none of the gifts of oratory, but spoke with
</p>
<p>great ease and fluency, and b}' his candid and earnest man-
</p>
<p>ner, and entire freedom from vituperation or abuse, com-
</p>
<p>manded the close attention of his audience, a large majority
</p>
<p>of whom were in sentiment opposed to him.
</p>
<p>In 1844, by too close attention to business, Mr. Allen's
</p>
<p>health began to fail, and he left home to procure rest and
</p>
<p>the benefit of a change of air and scenery ; spent some time
</p>
<p>at the Virginia Springs and other places of resort; but as
</p>
<p>soon as he returned to his professional labors he again began
</p>
<p>to decline, and was advised by his physicians to try a sea
</p>
<p>voyage, and accordingly, in the spring of 1845, sailed for
</p>
<p>Europe, and spent some time on the Continent. But it
</p>
<p>brought no favorable change to his health, and he con-
</p>
<p>cluded to return and die among his friends ; but on reaching
</p>
<p>the city of New York was unable to proceed further, and
</p>
<p>died there on September 12, 1845, in the forty-fifth year of
</p>
<p>his age.
</p>
<p>Mr. Allen left a large and interesting family. His widow,
</p>
<p>the daughter of Judge Pope, of Kaskaskia, an accomplished
</p>
<p>and benevolent lady, survives him, and still makes St. Louis
</p>
<p>her home.
</p>
<p>We never saw Mr. Allen at the bar, but the Hon. Thomas
</p>
<p>T. Gantt, late judge of our Court of Appeals, who knew him
</p>
<p>well, thus speaks of his legal attainments :

<p>"My first acquaintance with Mr. Allen was formed in 1839, when I came to
</p>
<p>St. Louis, a young man, to make that city my future home. Mr. Allen was at
</p>
<p>that time one of the leading lawyers of the city. Mr. Geyer, Mr. Gamble,
</p>
<p>Mr. Spalding, and Mr. Darby were with him in the enjoyment of the principal
</p>

</p>
<p>part of the heavy business then transacted by our courts. There were other and
</p>
<p>younLjer men rapidly risincj in the profession, and tliere were some others who
</p>
<p>had measuraljly withdrawn from the practice  sucli as Messrs. Magenis and
</p>
<p>Lawless, the last of whom was then on the bench of the Circuit Court, while
</p>
<p>the former, though nominally the United States attorney for Missouri, had for
</p>
<p>some time declined new engagements.
</p>
<p>" Of the five leaders of the Ijar Mr. Allen was clearly one, and in attention
</p>
<p>to business and skill in its dispatch he had no superior. He was well
</p>
<p>acquainted with our system of land titles, and one of the ablest productions
</p>
<p>that can be credited to any of the bar of St. Louis was the report made in the
</p>
<p>name of Surveyor-General Milburn, in vindication of the title of Carondelet to
</p>
<p>common south of the River Des Peres, when an attempt was made by the War
</p>
<p>Department to appropriate to the United States the Jefferson-Barracks tract.
</p>
<p>In order to obtain this tract, which contained 1,700 acres, it was thought
</p>
<p>necessary to defeat the title of Carondelet to her common south of the river.
</p>
<p>In 1826 certain of the villagers of Carondelet had given an informal consent
</p>
<p>to the occupation of this tract by' the United States troops. The town of
</p>
<p>Carondelet sought to reclaim this land in 1838, and thereupon the United
</p>
<p>States, through the War Department, sought to show that this tract was public
</p>
<p>land, and to defeat the confirmation of it to Carondelet as common by the act
</p>
<p>of 1812, and its survey by the United States surveyor-general in 1817 and 1834.
</p>
<p>It was conduct which, if practiced by an individual, would have been likely to
</p>
<p>be termed flagitious as well as puerile. Being attempted by the government,
</p>
<p>it led to an unsettling of the title of Carondelet for more than twenty years.
</p>
<p>In the year 1839 the commissioner of the General Land Office, at the sug-
</p>
<p>gestion of the secretary of war, called on William Milburn, then surveyor-
</p>
<p>general for Missouri and Illinois, for a report on the subject of the title of
</p>
<p>Carondelet to common south of the River Des Peres.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Allen was the legal adviser of a number of proprietors of land in the
</p>
<p>threatened tract, and he was consulted by Mr. Milburn as to the report he
</p>
<p>should make. He prepared a report composed of both documentary evidence
</p>
<p>and a legal argument upon it. It was apparently long, Init not more so than the
</p>
<p>case demanded. It occupies forty-eight pages of the record of the case of
</p>
<p>Carondelet vs. United States, lately pending in the Court of Claims. For

</p>
<p>mastery of the subject, and for anticipation of the true solution of all the per-
</p>
<p>plexing legal questions it involved, it is worthy of the highest admiration, but
</p>
<p>to dwell upon its features in detail would be uninteresting to all but lawyers, and
</p>
<p>unnecessary for them.
</p>
<p>"In demeanor Mr. Allen was grave, dignified, and gentleman-like. He was
</p>
<p>courteous to all, but especially so to the younger members of the bar. He was
</p>
<p>marked in the kindness with which he received those who came here from
</p>
<p>abroad, and who were making their first professional efforts at a bar of which
</p>
<p>he was an acknowledged leader. His house was open to all who desired ad-
</p>
<p>mission to its hospitality, and there yet remain some who remember it as the
</p>
<p>first of the homes of the older members of the profession to which they were
</p>

<p>sion, but was not ambitious of display. He was distinguished for the accuracy
</p>
<p>and completeness of his preparation for trial, and it is believed that he seldom
</p>
<p>had occasion to complain of a surprise or to move to set aside a default. The
</p>
<p>readiness with which he met the objections of his opponent led to the belief
</p>
<p>that he had foreseen and provided for it before it was made in court. This, of
</p>
<p>course, might result from the resources of the accomplished jurist, although the
</p>
<p>particular objection had not been anticipated ; but the quiet thoroughness with
</p>
<p>which such objections were usually met induced the younger members of the
</p>
<p>bar, at least, to think that there was nothing unforeseen in the point made by
</p>
<p>his adversary ; that it had been both anticipated and prepared for before the
</p>
<p>trial began.
</p>
<p>" His style of speaking was logical, forcible, and clear. It was eminently a
</p>
<p>forensic style. His aim was to convince rather than to excite or dazzle, and no
</p>
<p>one w^as listened to more attentively, whether he addressed a court or a jury.
</p>
<p>He passed away while his reputation was increasing, and at a period of life

<p>when few lawyers have reached the highest honors of their profession ; but his

<p>place in the front rank was assured, and his worthy rivalry of Geyer, Gamble,

<p>and Spalding acknowledged, when he was summoned by the Angel of Death

<p>from the field of further distinction. He left behind him an unsullied reputa-

<p>Louis will always be proud."
</p>
<p>Prince L. Hudgens.
</p>
<p>We had a slight acquaintance with this lawyer, who prac-
</p>
<p>ticed his profession for about twenty years in Andrew
</p>
<p>County. He was a strange compound of inconsistencies.
</p>
<p>Without having devoted six months of his life to the read-
</p>
<p>ing of the law, he was a successful practitioner. With
</p>
<p>scarcely any education, and no knowledge of elocution, he
</p>
<p>was a strong and vigorous debater. Even as a theologian he
</p>
<p>often pitted himself against the most learned men of the
</p>
<p>Church. He certainly obtained no knowledge from books,
</p>
<p>for he scarcely ever read any. It has often been said of a
</p>
<p>prominent American military officer that he was a general
</p>
<p>who had never been in battle, a statesman who had never
</p>
<p>made a speech, and a capitalist who never had a cent of his
</p>
<p>own in his life. Mr. Hudgens, however, was no theorist 
</p>
<p>he was practical in everything ; and the only solution to his
</p>
<p>strange career is that he was endowed with strong natural
</p>
<p>sense, and by close observation and experience was enabled
</p>
<p>to store his mind with that information which it is generally
</p>
<p>supposed books alone can furnish.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hudgens was born in Kentucky in 1811. His father
</p>
<p>was a Virginian, and early in life immigrated to Kentucky.
</p>
<p>In 1832 the subject of our sketch removed to Johnston
</p>
<p>County, Missouri, and located in a small settlement called
</p>
<p>Black Water, and, being without means and scarcely any
</p>
<p>education, supported himself by common labor. Having
</p>
<p>secured the good-will of a country merchant, he became a
</p>
<p>clerk in his store. In 1835 he married, and changed his resi-
</p>
<p>dence to the town of Camden, in Ray County, and in 1838
</p>
<p>removed to Andrew County and took out a preemption
</p>
<p>right upon a tract of land, upon which Savannah, the county-

</p>
<p>seat, was afterwards located. About this time the Platte pur-
</p>
<p>PRINCE L. HUDGENS. 479
</p>
<p>chase was brought within the state, and Congress passed a
</p>
<p>liberal preemption law. Mr. Hudgens turned his attention to
</p>
<p>procuring preemptions and making entries in the Land Office
</p>
<p>for others, which was not only a source of remuneration to
</p>
<p>him, but suggested the idea of turning his attention to the
</p>
<p>law. He procured a copy of Blackstone and Kent's Com-
</p>
<p>mentaries, and, after reading a little, commenced practicing
</p>
<p>in the County Court and Justices' Courts, and in 1845 was
</p>
<p>admitted to the bar by Judge David R. Atchison, who after-
</p>
<p>wards became United States senator.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hudgens opened an office in Savannah, and in time
</p>
<p>acquired an extensive practice, not only in Andrew but the
</p>
<p>adjacent counties, and was able to compete with any of the
</p>
<p>lawyers of his circuit. His good common sense taught him
</p>
<p>what the law ought to be, and, assuming that that was the
</p>
<p>law, he boldly proclaimed it, and generally was right. After
</p>
<p>practicing a few years, he turned his attention to theology,
</p>
<p>joined the Campbellite Church, and it was said he would
</p>
<p>practice law during the day and preach at night. As a
</p>
<p>theologian he had no charity for other denominations, and in
</p>
<p>his sermons would consign them all to h  1 and perdition
</p>
<p>without the benefit of clergy. He was a sentimentalist and
</p>
<p>revivalist, and his combativeness was so strong that he never
</p>
<p>would agree with any one upon any proposition. Religious
</p>
<p>disputation was a mania with him, and no matter what propo-
</p>
<p>sition was advanced, he would take the opposite side in
</p>
<p>order to provoke discussion.
</p>
<p>For several years he was a member of our State Legislature,
</p>
<p>and participated in all the debates. In 1861 he was elected
</p>
<p>to the Convention called to take into consideration the rela-
</p>
<p>tions of the state to the Federal government, and in the vari-
</p>
<p>ous sessions of that body took a very active part in the dis-
</p>
<p>cussions. He was a violent secessionist, and after the first
</p>
<p>session of the Convention was arrested by the military for dis-

<p>the fall of Lexington, when he was exchanged. During the

<p>intention of returning to the profession ; but his long confine-
</p>
<p>ment in prison had greatly impaired his health, and he re-
</p>
<p>turned to Savannah, where he died, in 1872, at the age of
</p>
<p>sixty-one. His career furnishes a striking illustration of
</p>
<p>what can be accomplished by energy, will, and perseverance,

</p>
<p>Wilson Primm.
</p>
<p>The subject of this sketch, who for many years was judge
</p>
<p>of the St. Louis Criminal Court, was born in the city of St.
</p>
<p>Louis in 1810, and on the maternal side was of French
</p>
<p>descent. His father was a Virginian. His education was
</p>
<p>obtained partly in such schools as St. Louis at that time af-
</p>
<p>forded, but chiefly at Bardstown College, in Kentucky.
</p>
<p>At an early age he exhibited mental powers and a fond-
</p>
<p>ness for reading far above boys of his age. He became a
</p>
<p>good French and Spanish scholar, and made some progress
</p>
<p>in the German language, and upon the trial' of Judge Peck
</p>
<p>before the United States Senate upon articles of impeach-
</p>
<p>ment, was called upon to translate many of the old French
</p>
<p>and Spanish archives.
</p>
<p>At the age of nineteen he commenced the study of the
</p>
<p>law with the Hon. Edward Bates  who always felt proud of
</p>
<p>\i\s protege  and, when he attained his majority, was admitted
</p>
<p>to the bar, and immediately commenced the practice in St.
</p>
<p>Louis, which continued to be his home through life. He
</p>
<p>was soon afterwards app.ointed a justice of the peace, the
</p>
<p>duties of which office he faithfully discharged for many
</p>
<p>years. At a later period he formed a partnership with
</p>
<p>Charles D, Drake, .present chief justice of the Court of
</p>
<p>Claims at Washington City. The firm did a large business
</p>
<p>for that time, for St. Louis was yet a comparatively small
</p>
<p>place, and litigation in the courts had not assumed much
</p>
<p>magnitude. Subsequently George R. Taylor, Esq., one of
</p>
<p>our most enterprising citizens, took the place of Judge
</p>
<p>Drake, and, upon his retiring, a partnership was formed be-
</p>
<p>tween Mr. Primm and C. C. Whittelsey, Esq.
</p>
<p>In 1834 Mr. Primm became a member of the Board of
</p>
<p>Aldermen of St. Louis, and remained a member of that
</p>
<p>body through several administrations, and for several years

</p>
<p>was its presiding officer. It was during this service that he
</p>
<p>displayed so much zeal in promoting the interest of his
</p>
<p>native city; particularly did he labor to improve the harbor,
</p>
<p>for it was greatly in danger of being seriously injured by a
</p>
<p>change in the channel of the river, which threatened the
</p>
<p>formation of a sand-bar in front of the levee. In several
</p>
<p>speeches and able reports he directed the attention of the
</p>
<p>citizens to the subject, and finally succeeded in establishing
</p>
<p>a system of dikes and other improvements which saved the
</p>
<p>harbor from total destruction. It may not be out of place
</p>
<p>to mention here, as a matter of history, that General Robert
</p>
<p>E. Lee, who so distinguished himself in the Confederate
</p>
<p>War, was one of the civil engineers employed in the harbor
</p>
<p>improvement, and came here at the solicitation of the Hon.
</p>
<p>John F. Darby, then mayor of the city.
</p>
<p>The common-school system, which was then in its infancy,
</p>
<p>also attracted his attention, and he became one of its most
</p>
<p>ardent friends and advocates, and continued so through life.
</p>
<p>He was in the habit of attending the public examinations
</p>
<p>and addressing the children, and one of the happiest efforts
</p>
<p>in that direction we ever listened to was made by him in the
</p>
<p>presence of about 600 pupils. St. Louis has reason to
</p>
<p>boast of her public schools, for in no other city in the Union
</p>
<p>has the system reached a greater perfection. Endowed
</p>
<p>with an ample fund, and in the hands of a Board of Direc-
</p>
<p>tors taken from our best citizens, and under the super-
</p>
<p>intendence of a man of great learning, William T. Harris,
</p>
<p>Esq., they have superseded all other schools, and furnish
</p>
<p>the only reliable means of education to both rich and poor.
</p>
<p>No city in the world is more blessed in that respect than
</p>
<p>St. Louis.
</p>
<p>In 1834 Mr. Primm was elected to the General Assembly,
</p>
<p>to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of Benjamin
</p>
<p>O'Fallon, Esq., and was reelected for several terms. He

<p>was an Old-Line Whig, and at that time his party was in the
</p>
<p>ascendant in St. Louis. He became quite prominent as a
</p>
<p>debater, and his popular and genial manners gave him a
</p>
<p>large influence with the opposition members, and enabled
</p>
<p>WILSON PRIM 31. 483
</p>
<p>him to procure the passage of many measures beneficial to
</p>
<p>his constituents. In social life and in convivial entertain-
</p>
<p>ments he was the life of the company, for he was endowed
</p>
<p>with fine conversational powers, was full of anecdote, good
</p>
<p>at repartee, and as a vocalist and violinist had very few
</p>
<p>equals. His rendition of the "Star-Spangled Banner" and
</p>
<p>"Old Rosin the Beau " was a treat to any one who had any
</p>
<p>music in his soul.
</p>
<p>A refined taste for music is not often found in the profes-
</p>
<p>sion, though Sir Thomas More and Lord Bacon, two of the
</p>
<p>most illustrious men who ever held the great seal of Eng-
</p>
<p>land, were fine musicians, and Lord Jeffreys, the judicial
</p>
<p>tyrant, was a good vocalist. But it must be admitted that,
</p>
<p>as a general thing, music has found but few devotees at the
</p>
<p>bar. The order of mind that seems particularly adapted to
</p>
<p>it is not favorable to the acquisition of -legal knowledge.
</p>
<p>About 1862 Mr. Primm was elected judge of the St. Louis
</p>
<p>Criminal Court, and remained on the bench about thirteen
</p>
<p>years. He made a most excellent judge, for his vigorous in-
</p>
<p>tellect and retentive memory enabled him to master our
</p>
<p>criminal code ; and he administered the law with firmne'ss
</p>
<p>tempered with mercy. After Judge Primm left the bench
</p>
<p>he returned to the practice, but his health began to fail
</p>
<p>rapidly, and he was finally compelled to relinquish it alto-
</p>
<p>gether.
</p>
<p>He died on January 17, 1878, at the mature age of sixty-
</p>
<p>eight.
</p>
<p>His rare accomplishments and fine social qualities made
</p>
<p>him a favorite in society, and it was rare indeed that he failed
</p>
<p>to receive an invitation to public dinners and social gather-
</p>
<p>ings, and, being fond of high living, no doubt on such occa-
</p>
<p>sions often indulged his appetite to excess, and but for this
</p>
<p>might have reached a very venerable age, for he belonged to
</p>
<p>a very long-lived family, his mother, a most estimable lady,

</p>
<p>having lately died at the age of eighty-six.
</p>
<p>Judge Primm was one of the finest speakers at the bar;
</p>
<p>had a fine command of language, an easy, flowing delivery,
</p>
<p>and at times became impassioned and eloquent. He pos-
</p>
<p>484 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>sessed a very vivid recollection of all historical events con-
</p>
<p>nected with the growth and advancement of the city, and his
</p>
<p>reminiscences of the early inhabitants, as detailed in the
</p>
<p>lecture-room, were very entertaining and instructive. Judge
</p>
<p>Primm leaned strongly in favor of precedent and old-estab-
</p>
<p>lished customs, and at one time while on the bench wore for
</p>
<p>a short period a black-silk gown, in imitation of the English
</p>
<p>judges  a custom that still prevails in the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>the United States, and probably in a few of the courts in
</p>
<p>New England. It was supposed to add to the dignity and
</p>
<p>solemnity of the proceedings of the courts, and in England
</p>
<p>the judges wore, in addition, a black cap, and often, when
</p>
<p>passing sentence of death upon a prisoner, the cap was drawn
</p>
<p>partially over the eyes, to conceal the judge's emotion. The
</p>
<p>custom, also, of wearing powdered wigs prevailed during many
</p>
<p>reigns. Jeafferson tells us that as late as Queen Anne's reign,
</p>
<p>which witnessed the introduction of three-cornered hats, a
</p>
<p>lord keeper wore in court his natural hair instead of a wig,
</p>
<p>until he received the sovereign's order to adopt the venerable
</p>
<p>disguise of a full-bottomed wig. A few of the judges rebelled
</p>
<p>against the custom, and it is related by the above author that
</p>
<p>Lord Hardwicke, after the close of his long period of official
</p>
<p>service, appeared at court in a plain suit of black velvet, with a
</p>
<p>bag and sword. The king professed not to know his old friend
</p>
<p>and servant, when a lord who stood near his majesty's per-
</p>
<p>son whispered to him, " That is your chancellor, Lord Hard-
</p>
<p>wicke." " How long has your lordship been in town?" said
</p>
<p>the king. The peer's surprise and chagrin were great until
</p>
<p>the monarch, having received further instruction from the
</p>
<p>courtly prompter at his elbow, frankly apologized in bad
</p>
<p>English and with noisy laughter. The same author informs
</p>
<p>us that even counsel at one time were required by the rules
</p>
<p>of the court to wear powdered wigs, and when Lord Camp-
</p>
<p>bell argued the great Privilege Case he obtained permission

</p>
<p>to appear without a wig; but this concession to a counsel 
</p>
<p>who on that occasion spoke for sixteen hours  was accom-
</p>
<p>panied with an intimation that " it was not to be drawn into
</p>
<p>precedent."
</p>
<p>WILSON PRIMM. 485
</p>
<p>A few days after the death of Judge Primm a meeting of
</p>
<p>the members of the St. Louis bar was held in one of the
</p>
<p>court-rooms, and a series of resokitions, expressive of the loss
</p>
<p>sustained in his death, adopted. Hon. George R. Taylor
</p>
<p>presided, and Hon. Alexander Hamilton, an ex-judge of the
</p>
<p>St. Louis Circuit Court, was one of the Committee on Reso-
</p>
<p>lutions. Probably no man at the bar had a more correct ap-
</p>
<p>preciation of Judge Primm's merits as a citizen and a lawyer
</p>
<p>than Judge Hamilton, for they were not only intimate friends,
</p>
<p>but Primm had long practiced in Hamilton's court. The fol-
</p>
<p>lowing letter, addressed to Mr. Taylor a week after Judge
</p>
<p>Primm's death, furnishes a beautiful tribute to the memory of
</p>
<p>the dead jurist :
</p>
<p>"St. Louis, January 2j, 18 j8.
</p>
<p>" Hon. George R. Taylor,
</p>
<p>" Dear Sir : As you are aware, I was one of the Committee on Resolutions
</p>
<p>appointed at the recent meeting of the bar of St. Louis called to notice the
</p>
<p>death of the Honorable Wilson Primm.
</p>
<p>"Those resolutions fully express my individual sentiments, and as a faithful
</p>
<p>and pleasing portraiture of our deceased friend in the several characters of law-
</p>
<p>yer, citizen, and judge, met with my unqualified approval. You ask for any
</p>
<p>personal reminiscences which may occur to me. I am not sure that I could
</p>
<p>add anything of value or interest to what is contained in those resolutions.
</p>
<p>"Permit me to say that I cannot but think that all who knew Wilson Primm
</p>
<p>in his best estate will admit that his talents and learning rendered him an orna-
</p>
<p>ment to the bar.
</p>
<p>" With a fine mind, enriched by culture and strengthened by careful training,
</p>
<p>he was not only eloquent at times, but was always a ready and skillful de-
</p>
<p>bater. None knew better the true use and power of language, or how to match
</p>
<p>the expression to the thought. It was this peculiarity, added to soundness of
</p>
<p>judgment, aptness and beauty of illustration, and a voice of rare sweetness and
</p>
<p>variety of intonation, that made him so successful before the jury. But besides
</p>
<p>his many and brilliant professional traits, there were his social charms, his de-
</p>
<p>lightful courtesy, and his winning address, that at once inspired admiration and

</p>
<p>sympathy. Those who were among his intimates can readily accept the tradi-
</p>
<p>tion received from Henry S. Geyer, who used to take pleasure in narrating how
</p>
<p>young Primm, who was a witness on the trial of Judge Peck, attracted universal
</p>
<p>attention by his natural grace and charm of manner, and how he electrified the
</p>
<p>gay circles of Washington City by his wit and accomplishments. His aesthetic
</p>
<p>taste and genius manifested themselves in various ways. With the cultivated
</p>
<p>taste of an artist he had an eye for the productions of the pencil, and excelled in
</p>
<p>music and in song. While joining those, therefore, who mourn the removal of
</p>
<p>486 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>our lionored friend, I would affectionately and reverently, with my own hand,
</p>
<p>lay this imperfect tribute on his grave, resting in the assurance that he has passed
</p>
<p>from the sorrows and troubles of this world into the perpetual felicity and joy of
</p>
<p>-the better life.
</p>
<p>"Very truly your friend and servant,
</p>
<p>" A. Hamilton."
</p>
<p>Jtidge Primm was at times very happy at repartee. He
</p>
<p>and his old legal preceptor, Edward Bates, were once en-
</p>
<p>gaged in a case upon opposite sides, and while Mr. Primm
</p>
<p>was maintaining before the court a certain proposition of law,
</p>
<p>Mr. Bates interrupted him with the remark, " You never
</p>
<p>learned such law from me, sir." Mr. Primm promptly re-
</p>
<p>plied, " No, sir  because you never knew it." Mr. Bates
</p>
<p>afterwards complimented him for his wit.
</p>
<p>Judge Primm was often witty, and his wit was of that kind
</p>
<p>which never gave offense, for it was playful, and never tran-
</p>
<p>scended the bounds of propriety and decorum.
</p>
<p>The Hon. Gilchrist Porter, a distinguished judge of north-
</p>
<p>eastern Missouri, in a recent letter giving his recollections
</p>
<p>of some of the lawyers at an early time, as far back as 1836,
</p>
<p>alludes to a speech which Mr. Primm made in a libel suit in
</p>
<p>the St. Charles court. He says : " Wilson Primm, then in
</p>
<p>his prime, made one of the most eloquent speeches I had
</p>
<p>then or have since listened to. I have heard many speeches,
</p>
<p>in both Federal and state courts, but this speech attracted my
</p>
<p>attention particularly, and I distinctly remember some of his
</p>
<p>lofty and well-sustained figures of fancy, his bold figures of
</p>

<p>THOMAS C. BURCH.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rurch came to Missouri from Tennessee when a
</p>
<p>child, with his father, who settled in Howard County. He
</p>
<p>had no particular educational advantages, and at the age of
</p>
<p>about twenty commenced the study of the law with Judge
</p>
<p>Robert W. Wells, of Jefferson City. The Hon. George W.
</p>
<p>Miller, present judge of the Cole Circuit, was a student of
</p>
<p>Judge Wells at the same time, and speaks highly of Mr.
</p>
<p>Burch's legal attainments.
</p>
<p>He completed his studies in 1831, and during that year ob-
</p>
<p>tained a license to practice, and located in Richmond, Ray
</p>
<p>County.
</p>
<p>He was regarded as a promising young lawyer, and soon
</p>
<p>acquired a reasonable share of the practice. He is repre-
</p>
<p>sented as being affable and pleasant in his manners, and a
</p>
<p>close and diligent student.
</p>
<p>At the session of the Legislat*ure in 1838-9 the Eleventh
</p>
<p>Judicial Circuit was created, and Mr. Burch became its judge.
</p>
<p>He held but two terms of his court when, at Keytesville, in
</p>
<p>Chariton County, where he was holding court, he had to meet
</p>
<p>that fell destroyer that respects neither age nor condition.
</p>
<p>The death of one so young and promising, and at a period
</p>
<p>in life when he had a right to hope for success and distinc-
</p>
<p>tion, cast a deep gloom over the entire community.
</p>
<p>Judge Burch was a man of kind and tender heart, and,
</p>
<p>though accustomed to listen often to the details of crime and
</p>
<p>violations of law, greatly deprecated the contentions and
</p>
<p>strife which too frequently occur even in well-regulated
</p>
<p>society.
</p>
<p>The following was related to us by a prominent member
</p>
<p>of the bar who witnessed the occurrence : In holding one of
</p>
<p>his courts he was called upon to try a case instituted by a

<p>poor woman to recover from a neighbor a calf which both
</p>
<p>488 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>claimed. It was at the close of the term, and he was has-
</p>
<p>tening to get ready to start for the next court. In looking
</p>
<p>over the paper he discovered that the case involved nothing,
</p>
<p>and was likely to consume several days ; so he turned to the
</p>
<p>plaintiff's counsel and reproved him for instituting so frivo-
</p>
<p>lous a suit. The counsel remarked that it was not the value
</p>
<p>of the calf for which he was contending, but that he was
</p>
<p>battling for the eternal principles of justice.
</p>
<p>"Well," said the judge, addressing the defendant's coun-
</p>
<p>sel, "what are you fighting for?"
</p>
<p>" For the same that my learned brother is professing to
</p>
<p>seek  the ever-living and eternal principles of right.''
</p>
<p>"Mr. Clerk," said the judge, " how many witnesses have
</p>
<p>been subpoened in this case ? "
</p>
<p>" Forty, your honor."
</p>
<p>" Do you want your fees in the case? "
</p>
<p>" No, sir ; I will relinquish them if it will tend to settle
</p>
<p>the case."
</p>
<p>" Mr. Sheriff, have you any claim for your services ? "
</p>
<p>" No, sir; like the clerk, I will abandon my fees if the case
</p>
<p>stops here."
</p>
<p>Coming down from the belich and approaching the plaint-
</p>
<p>iff, the judge said, " Madam, how much do you want for
</p>
<p>your calf? "
</p>
<p>" It is worth four dollars," replied the widow.
</p>
<p>The judge thereupon took from his pocket $^, and, hand-
</p>
<p>ing the money to the widow, said, " Mr. Clerk, strike this
</p>
<p>case from the docket."
</p>
<p>Judge Burch was a man of more than ordinary ability, and
</p>
<p>gave promise of much future usefulness.

<p>we know whether he left a family.
</p>
<p>Jacob Smith.
</p>
<p>We have no recollection of ever meeting with this gentle-
</p>
<p>man. He was a prominent lawyer, residing in Linneus,
</p>
<p>Linn County. He was born on March 3, 18 16, in Adair
</p>
<p>County, Kentucky. His parents were originally from Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, and had been in Kentucky but a short time when
</p>
<p>their son Jacob was born. He received a good English
</p>
<p>education, but never had an opportunity of studying the
</p>
<p>languages. As he approached manhood he taught school,
</p>
<p>and devoted his leisure hours to the study of the law. He
</p>
<p>was admitted to the bar in Kentucky in 1844, and after
</p>
<p>practicing two years in his native state removed to Missouri
</p>
<p>and located in the county of Linn, where he resided up to
</p>
<p>the time of his death.
</p>
<p>In 185 1 the people of Linn elected him to the State
</p>
<p>Legislature, and he was soon recognized in that body as a
</p>
<p>man of decided ability. He took an active part in the de-
</p>
<p>bates, and though a decided Whig in his political tenets,
</p>
<p>was moderate and conservative in his views, and enjoyed the
</p>
<p>confidence of the opposition members. In 1853 he was
</p>
<p>made judge of the Probate Court of his county, and held
</p>
<p>the office four years. Though born in a slave state, he took
</p>
<p>a firm stand against secession, and, upon the breaking-out
</p>
<p>of the war, united with Colonel Jacob Tindall in recruiting
</p>
<p>and organizing the Twenty-third Infantry of Missouri Vol-
</p>
<p>unteers, and became a lieutenant-colonel in the regiment
</p>
<p>and proved himself a gallant soldier. Judge Smith was also
</p>
<p>elected to the Convention called to take into consideration
</p>
<p>the relations of the state to the Federal government. His
</p>
<p>colleagues were Colonel A. M. Woolfork, of Livingston
</p>
<p>County, and William Jackson, of Putnam. He pursued in
</p>
<p>the Convention a very conservative course ; counseled mod-

</p>
<p>the South had, her remedy was in the Union, and not out of
</p>
<p>it. Had the leading men of the South adopted his poHcy,
</p>
<p>the country would have been spared one of the most
</p>
<p>calamitous and unnatural wars that ever engaged mankind.
</p>
<p>In December, i86i, he was appointed, by Governor Gam-
</p>
<p>ble, judge of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit, and he faithfully
</p>
<p>discharged the duties of that responsible position until 1864.
</p>
<p>On January 9, 1865, a mob seized and took possession of
</p>
<p>the town of Linneus, and while in the act of robbing the
</p>
<p>treasury Judge Smith interposed his authority as a con-
</p>
<p>servator of the peace, and, in attempting to quell the vio-
</p>
<p>lence of the mob, received a gunshot wound, from the
</p>
<p>effects of Avhich he died the following day. He thus fell in
</p>
<p>the full tide of professional success, and while endeavoring
</p>
<p>to put down violence and misrule.
</p>
<p>Judge Smith was of strong muscular frame, near six feet
</p>
<p>high, with dark hair and eyes, and an animated expression
</p>
<p>of countenance. By those who enjoyed his personal ac-
</p>
<p>quaintance he was represented as very social in his habits,
</p>
<p>strongly attached to his friends, and a generous and noble-
</p>
<p>hearted man. As a judge he was firm, decided, and im-
</p>
<p>partial ; as a lawyer he stood high at the bar, always com-
</p>
<p>manded a fair practice, and enjoyed more than an average
</p>
<p>professional success.
</p>
<p>He made no pretensions to finished elocution, yet was a
</p>
<p>forcible, clear-headed, and logical speaker, relying more
</p>
<p>upon his analyzation of the facts of a case than any attempt
</p>
<p>at showy declamation.

<p>And our cradle stands in the grave."
</p>
<p>William H. Davis.
</p>
<p>That portion of Missouri known as the North Grand River
</p>
<p>Country possessed at an early day many lawyers of ability,
</p>
<p>among whom was William Harrison Davis, of Keytesville,
</p>
<p>Chariton County.
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis was born in Nelson County, Kentucky, on No-
</p>
<p>vember 29, 181 1, and came with his parents to Missouri Ter-
</p>
<p>ritory in 1820, and settled in Chariton County, which then
</p>
<p>had a very sparse population; but the country was in a rapid
</p>
<p>state of improvement, and presented many inducements to
</p>
<p>the immigrant. Like all countries just opening to settlement,
</p>
<p>it contained but very limited means to educate the young.
</p>
<p>Now and then some enterprising Yankee would stop and
</p>
<p>teach school for one or two terms, and then push on to parts
</p>
<p>unknown. Frequently they would be without a teacher for
</p>
<p>six months at a time. It was this system of itinerant teach-
</p>
<p>ing that young Davis had to rely upon to obtain the rudi-
</p>
<p>ments of an English education ; but he improved it better
</p>
<p>than the average run of boys, for, though addicted to frolic
</p>
<p>and mischief, he was studious, and fond of his books, and
</p>
<p>always stood well in his class.
</p>
<p>There is a story of his boyhood that is worth relating:
</p>
<p>There were two rival schools in the neighborhood, and
</p>
<p>young Davis went to the one that was taught by the Rev.
</p>
<p>Ebenezer Rogers, who was raised among the Quakers and
</p>
<p>had imbibed their antipathy to war and bloodshed. On sev-
</p>
<p>eral occasions he had cautioned his pupils to avoid all con-
</p>
<p>tentions and disputes with the boys of the other school ; but
</p>
<p>young Davis was a Kentuckian, delighted in the manly art,
</p>
<p>and could not see the necessity for his teacher's admonition,
</p>
<p>so he occasionally measured his strength with the champions

</p>
<p>of the rival institution. On one occasion the fact reached
</p>
<p>492 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>the ears of the Rev. Ebenezer, who never spared the rod
</p>
<p>when advised of any violation of his rules. As young
</p>
<p>Davis came into the school-room, with a face not much
</p>
<p>improved by the rencounter, the teacher, with a raised fer-
</p>
<p>ule and angry countenance, demanded to know if he had
</p>
<p>been in a fight, and receiving an affirmative answer, was
</p>
<p>about to chastise the offender, when William said, looking
</p>
<p>at him squarely in the eye, " I met one of their big boys, sir,
</p>
<p>and he said you was a tory and an ass, and I couldn't stand
</p>
<p>that; so I gave him a good thrashing." In a moment the
</p>
<p>ferule was quietly laid upon the table, and William pleasantly
</p>
<p>directed to take his seat. Such quickness of perception
</p>
<p>and consummate strategy are very rare in a boy of that age.
</p>
<p>When but sixteen, young Davis entered as an apprentice
</p>
<p>in a printing-office at Fayette, Howard County, and soon
</p>
<p>learned the trade. In the fall of 1833 he and a man by the
</p>
<p>name of Kelly established a paper in Liberty, Clay County,
</p>
<p>called The Enquirer, and at the end of the year he sold his
</p>
<p>interest to his partner and commenced the study of the law
</p>
<p>in the office of General John Wilson, at Fayette, with whom
</p>
<p>he remained about two years, when he was licensed to prac-
</p>
<p>tice by the Supreme Court of the state, and located at
</p>
<p>Keytesville, where he resided till his death, which took place
</p>
<p>on June 21, 1845, at the early age of thirty-three.
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis belonged to the old Whig school of politics, and
</p>
<p>though he often indulged in political discourses, never became
</p>
<p>a candidate for any office. The state was Democratic, and
</p>
<p>no one of his faith could hope for political distinction ; hence
</p>
<p>he applied himself very diligently to his profession, never re-
</p>
<p>linquishing his studious habits, and soon took high rank at
</p>
<p>the bar  no empty compliment when he had to contend
</p>
<p>with such men as Leonard, Clark, Wilson, Adams, and Joe
</p>
<p>Davis, all of whom attended the Chariton Court and the
</p>
<p>courts of the adjacent counties.

<p>Mr. Davis was a vigorous, earnest, and logical speaker,
</p>
<p>and at times quite eloquent. As a jury lawyer, in particular,
</p>
<p>he had but few equals, for he rarely made a mistake in his
</p>
<p>WILLIAM H. DA VIS. 493
</p>
<p>estimate of men. He seemed to divine the peculiarities of
</p>
<p>each juror, and shaped his argument accordingly.
</p>
<p>At the time of his death he was rising very rapidly, and
</p>
<p>had life been spared to him, must have attained a very envi-
</p>
<p>able position in the profession.

<p>" Tlie world's a bubble, and the life of man less than a span."
</p>
<p>Henry m. vories.
</p>
<p>This able jurist and lawyer was a great favorite with the
</p>
<p>bar of Missouri. We first met him at St. Joseph in 1862,
</p>
<p>while holding a term of the Supreme Court there. He and
</p>
<p>Governor Willard P. Hall were the acknowledged leaders
</p>
<p>of the St. Joseph bar, and were retained in almost every case
</p>
<p>of much magnitude. He was engaged before us in the ar-
</p>
<p>gument of several cases, and it required no effort to discover
</p>
<p>that he was a lawyer of fine erudition. He had a pleasant
</p>
<p>and easy delivery, and his mind was essentially logical.
</p>
<p>When we come to understand the difficulties he encoun-
</p>
<p>tered in early life, his professional success seems almost
</p>
<p>miraculous.
</p>
<p>He was born in Henry County, Kentucky, in 18 10, and was
</p>
<p>of German descent. His father was a respectable farmer,
</p>
<p>with a fair education and in easy circumstances, and brought
</p>
<p>his sons up to labor on the farm, never intending them for
</p>
<p>any of the learned professions.
</p>
<p>Henry was a wild boy, fond of play and frolic, and if any
</p>
<p>mischief was perpetrated in the neighborhood he was sure to
</p>
<p>have a hand in it, and was ever ready to assume his share of
</p>
<p>the responsibility. There was nothing vicious or ill-natured
</p>
<p>about him ; on the contrary, he was a boy of good heart and
</p>
<p>generous disposition, and a great favorite with the old as well
</p>
<p>as the young; but he looked upon life as something to be
</p>
<p>enjoyed, and could not resist the temptation to embark in
</p>
<p>every undertaking that promised a little merriment. He re-
</p>
<p>mained with his father till he was seventeen, and although
</p>
<p>his education extended no farther than reading and writing,
</p>
<p>he determined to start out in the world and become the
</p>
<p>architect of his own fortune. He purchased a stallion and
</p>
<p>took him to Danville, Indiana, where he exhibited him on all

</p>
<p>public occasions, occasionally working on the neighboring
</p>
<p>HENRY M. VORIES. 495
</p>
<p>farms and doing such jobs as fell in his way. He made ac-
</p>
<p>quaintances rapidly, and took well with the people. He was
</p>
<p>a " hail-fellow well met " with all, and could drink as much
</p>
<p>whisky as any of them. About this time the Black Hawk
</p>
<p>War broke out, and he volunteered as a private and served
</p>
<p>during the war. However patriotic he may have become, it
</p>
<p>is not probable that his morals underwent any decided im-
</p>
<p>provement while in the army.
</p>
<p>At the close of the war he returned to Danville and com-
</p>
<p>menced merchandising on a small scale. He must have mar-
</p>
<p>ried about this time, but he soon lost his wife, who left him
</p>
<p>with one child. She died quite suddenly. He continued
</p>
<p>his mercantile business and made some money, and when
</p>
<p>about thirty years of age embarked in an extensive pork
</p>
<p>speculation, which proved disastrous. He spent a year in
</p>
<p>closing up his business, and found that he was in debt to the
</p>
<p>amount of ^10,000, and had no assets whatever. His cred-
</p>
<p>itors offered to compromise with him on very liberal terms,
</p>
<p>but he expressed a determination to pay every dollar of his
</p>
<p>indebtedness, with interest, and in a few years did so. This
</p>
<p>act of his life denoted the highest integrity, and he was ever
</p>
<p>afterwards regarded as of great probity of character.
</p>
<p>It seems strange that he should at this time have enter-
</p>
<p>tained the idea of studying law, for, as before stated, he had
</p>
<p>no education, and had never read a book through in his life.
</p>
<p>He applied to an attorney in Danville for permission to read
</p>
<p>in his office, which was readily granted, and here, at the age
</p>
<p>of thirty-one, he commenced his legal studies. He had not
</p>
<p>read many months before he commenced attending the courts
</p>
<p>of justices of the peace, was employed in a few cases, and in
</p>
<p>time became quite a good justice-of-the-peace lawyer.
</p>
<p>This was his only reliance for a support, yet he had the
</p>
<p>courage to marry again, and took for his wife a Miss Kake,
</p>
<p>who proved to be a very estimable lady.

</p>
<p>After studying two years, Mr. Vories was admitted to the
</p>
<p>bar of Indiana, but it is not probable that he practiced there
</p>
<p>in the courts of record, for in 1844 he started with his family
</p>
<p>for Buchanan County, Missouri, and on reaching Plattsburg,
</p>
<p>496 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>in Clinton County, he and most of his family were taken
</p>
<p>sick, and he was without a dollar to buy medicine or bread.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances most men would have despaired,
</p>
<p>but he expressed a confidence that all would turn out right,
</p>
<p>and endeavored to inspire his suffering family with cheerful-
</p>
<p>ness. By good fortune he fell in with James H. Birch, Esq.,
</p>
<p>who was connected with the Land Office at Plattsburg, and
</p>
<p>who afterwards became a judge of our Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>Making known his condition to Mr. Birch, that gentleman
</p>
<p>kindly supplied him with means to procure provisions for his
</p>
<p>family. It is gratifying to know that these gentlemen, both
</p>
<p>of whom afterwards filled the highest judicial position in the
</p>
<p>state, became warm and devoted friends, and continued so
</p>
<p>through life.
</p>
<p>As soon as able to travel, Mr. Vories started for Sparta,
</p>
<p>which was then the county-seat of Buchanan, and there he
</p>
<p>located in the practice of the law.
</p>
<p>He often said that at this time he was so poor that he was
</p>
<p>forced to sell his only ax to buy bread for his family. But
</p>
<p>his cheerful disposition, pleasant demeanor, and affable man-
</p>
<p>ners soon attracted attention, and he was invited by William
</p>
<p>B. Almond, Esq., to a partnership. This ended his days of
</p>
<p>poverty and want, for from that time fortune smiled upon
</p>
<p>him, and Henry M. Vories became one of the most popular
</p>
<p>and successful lawyers in north-western Missouri. It is said
</p>
<p>that the ways of Providence are past finding out, but surely
</p>
<p>the life of Henry M. Vories ought to give encouragement to
</p>
<p>hundreds who are struggling for professional success under
</p>
<p>circumstances far less adverse. Upon the removal of the
</p>
<p>county-seat from Sparta to St. Joseph, Mr. Vories took up
</p>
<p>his residence in the latter place, bought a small farm in the
</p>
<p>suburbs of the city, and lived there till his death, with the
</p>
<p>exception of about three years he spent in California.
</p>
<p>In 1856 he was nominated by the Democratic party for

</p>
<p>It is said that he accepted the nomination with great reluc-

<p>tance, and although his election was placed beyond any

<p>doubt, he changed his mind and declined.

<p>In 1856 he moved to San Jose, in California, and practiced
</p>
<p>there until 1859, when he returned to Missouri and resumed
</p>
<p>the practice at St. Joseph. While in California he practiced
</p>
<p>in partnership with Lawrence Archer, Esq.
</p>
<p>In November, 1872, Mr. Vories was elected judge of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, and was on the bench at the time of his
</p>
<p>death.
</p>
<p>We are not aware of his holding any other office, though
</p>
<p>we have an impression that he was a delegate to the Consti-
</p>
<p>tutional Convention of 1845.
</p>
<p>He took great delight in horticulture, and raised upon his
</p>
<p>place some of the choicest varieties of the grape. He was
</p>
<p>kind enough to take us through his vineyard and orchard,
</p>
<p>which gave evidence of the highest culture.
</p>
<p>We have said that Judge Vories' mind was essentially
</p>
<p>logical. His published opinions as contained in our State Re-
</p>
<p>ports leave no doubt as to this. He made no pretensions to
</p>
<p>orator}^ and his style was purely conversational, yet few men
</p>
<p>were more capable of holding the attention of a court or
</p>
<p>jury.
</p>
<p>When addressing a jury he would place himself in close
</p>
<p>proximity to them, and, if the case was of much magnitude,
</p>
<p>would single out each juror by name and address himself
</p>
<p>particularly to that one, as though relying upon his individual
</p>
<p>intelligence for a proper solution of the case. This rare
</p>
<p>faculty, when properly executed, yields a powerful influence.
</p>
<p>It is said that Madam de Stael, the French authoress, and
</p>
<p>leader of Parisian court society during the consulship of the
</p>
<p>first Napoleon, had it in a remarkable degree. She would
</p>
<p>converse with a dozen gentlemen at the same time, and in-
</p>
<p>spire each with the belief that he was the chief object of her
</p>
<p>thoughts.
</p>
<p>Another element of Judge Vories' success is found in the
</p>
<p>fact that he made himself one of the people  in fact, he was

<p>one of them  and it was impossible to draw a line of dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between Judge Vories the lawyer and Judge Vories

<p>their own, and, as such, exulted in his success.

<p>The last time we saw him was while holding a term of his
</p>
<p>court in St. Louis. He had become so infirm from rheuma-
</p>
<p>tism, and other causes, that it was with the utmost difficulty
</p>
<p>that he walked from the court-house to his hotel. He died

<p>at home, October 29, 1876.

</p>
<p>URIEL WRIGHT.
</p>
<p>Among the gifted men of the Missouri bar who dazzled
</p>
<p>the public mind with their genius and eloquence, none ranked
</p>
<p>higher than the subject of this sketch, the Prentiss of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri. A part of his professional life was spent in Marion
</p>
<p>County, and most of the remainder in the city of St. Louis,
</p>
<p>which became the scene of his greatest professional triumph.
</p>
<p>It is too so(^n, by at least a generation, to sketch the life of
</p>
<p>one whose want of moral stamina turned the public eye from
</p>
<p>his genius and oratorical superiority. Human jealousy and
</p>
<p>a want of charity for our imperfections will not permit us to
</p>
<p>appreciate a man's worth or intellect until his faults pass out
</p>
<p>of memory, and his genius can be viewed disconnected from
</p>
<p>his errors and frailties.
</p>
<p>It took England a century after the death of Shakespeare
</p>
<p>to find out what a genius had lived in her midst, and a cen-
</p>
<p>tury hence his fame as a dramatic writer and delineator
</p>
<p>of human character will far exceed its present estimate.
</p>
<p>America is just beginning to find out that she had a poet in
</p>
<p>the person of Edgar A. Poe, and it will take another genera-
</p>
<p>tion before " The Raven " takes its deserved place among
</p>
<p>the finest ebullitions of poetic genius. If a member of the
</p>
<p>Virginia House of Burgesses, who sat by Patrick Henry and
</p>
<p>heard his powerful anathemas against British oppression,
</p>
<p>should rise from his grave, he would not recognize the Pat-
</p>
<p>rick Henry of to-day. Though he did more than any living
</p>
<p>man to kindle the fires of the Revolution, yet it required the
</p>
<p>descriptive genius of a Wirt to force upon the American
</p>
<p>people a realization of the great power of the Virginia orator.
</p>
<p>These reflections not only apply (though in a less degree)
</p>
<p>to Major Wright, but to all public men who achieve distinc-
</p>
<p>tion in any particular vocation.

</p>
<p>Major Wright was born at Madison Court-House, Vir-
</p>
<p>500 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p><jinia, in (805, and on the maternal side descended from the
</p>
<p>Johnsons and Barbours, old Virginia families, and noted for
</p>
<p>their talents and patriotism. Young Wright at a very earl)'
</p>
<p>period exhibited a mental power far above his years, and
</p>
<p>attracted the particular notice of Governor Barbour, who
</p>
<p>obtained for him a commission as cadet at West Point. The
</p>
<p>education he received there proved highly advantageous to
</p>
<p>him in after-life, but in obedience- to the wish of his father,
</p>
<p>expressed on his death-bed, he left- the institution before
</p>
<p>graduating, and entered upon the study of the law with
</p>
<p>Judge Philip P. Barbour, of Orange County, and graduated
</p>
<p>in Judge Tucker's law school at Winchester. He was then
</p>
<p>admitted to the bar, and practiced in his native county about
</p>
<p>five years. In the meantime he married, and in 1833
</p>
<p>removed to Missouri and settled in Palmyra, Marion County,
</p>
<p>and practiced in most of the courts in north-east Missouri.
</p>
<p>The Marion bar is, and always has been, a strong bar ; but
</p>
<p>Major Wright's social habits and fine qualities as a speaker
</p>
<p>soon gave him a good practice. About this time land specu-
</p>
<p>lations ran very high, and every man who had a quarter-sec-
</p>
<p>tion on the Mississippi, or any other river, laid out a town,
</p>
<p>expecting that in a few years a large city would spring up
</p>
<p>and his town lots sell at marvelous prices. Major Wright
</p>
<p>fell an early victim to the fever, and, with others, invested all
</p>
<p>his means in Marion City, a city only seen on paper, and
</p>
<p>which at the first high flood took its departure for a more
</p>
<p>southern clime. This unfortunate investment induced him
</p>
<p>to remove to St. Louis, where he passed the most active part
</p>
<p>of his life. Before, however, coming to St. Louis he served
</p>
<p>one term in the State Legislature as a representative from
</p>
<p>Marion. This was the winter of 1836-7. During that ses-
</p>
<p>sion we were in Jefferson City, and heard him on several
</p>
<p>occasions address the House, and became impressed with his
</p>
<p>great power as a debater.

</p>
<p>We knew him from that time until he left Missouri. The
</p>
<p>session was not half over before he ranked as one of the
</p>
<p>finest declaimers in the body  in fact, he had no equal,
</p>
<p>unless it was General Doniphan, a representative from Clay

<p>URIEL WRIGHT. ^0\
</p>
<p>County. But they never came in conflict, for they belonged
</p>
<p>to the same poHtical organization, and were in accord upon
</p>
<p>all questions giving rise to debate.
</p>
<p>Major Wright came to St. Louis with a high reputation as
</p>
<p>an orator and criminal advocate, and stepped at once into a
</p>
<p>profitable criminal practice. There was scarcely a case of
</p>
<p>homicide, or any other important criminal prosecution, in
</p>
<p>which his services were not employed, and his success far
</p>
<p>exceeded that of any other criminal lawyer. We saw him
</p>
<p>in the case of The State vs. Chiles, upon a charge of embez-
</p>
<p>zlement ; The State vs. Worrill, an indictment for murder,
</p>
<p>in which we appeared in behalf of the state, an interesting
</p>
<p>account of which is given in our sketch of General John D.
</p>
<p>Coalter ; The State vs. O'Bennis ; The State vs. Jackson, for
</p>
<p>the murder of Laidlaw ; The State vs. Lopez, for embezzle-
</p>
<p>ment ; and Carstang vs. Shaw, referred to in the memoir of
</p>
<p>James R. Lackland.
</p>
<p>In all of these he proved himself entitled to a place in the
</p>
<p>front rank of the profession, and, as an advocate, the superior
</p>
<p>of any man at the Missouri bar. It is a great misfortune
</p>
<p>that no report of these cases, and the speeches of counsel,
</p>
<p>have been preserved  an omission that admits of no excuse
</p>
<p>or apology. Many hardened criminals, who richly deserved
</p>
<p>the halter, have escaped through the powerful jury-appeals
</p>
<p>of Major Wright.
</p>
<p>He had a fine knowledge of men, and, when engaged in
</p>
<p>cases of an}' magnitude, scrutinized with great care and
</p>
<p>deliberation every juror summoned in a case. In cases
</p>
<p>involving life he made it a point to learn the character, hab-
</p>
<p>its, and peculiarities of every juror on the panel, and
</p>
<p>selected them with reference to the line of defense he
</p>
<p>expected to set up ; and in this he rarely made a mistake.
</p>
<p>If he designed to operate upon their sympathies, he chose
</p>
<p>men of weak intellects and kind hearts, and who might be

<p>supposed to be averse to capital punishment. If, on the
</p>
<p>contrary, his purpose was to maintain that a homicide was
</p>
<p>excusable or justifiable, he would select men of high tem
</p>
<p>S02 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>per, excitable nature, and who are ever ready to resent an
</p>
<p>injury or insult, real or imaginary. If his client was a man
</p>
<p>of low repute, and without friends, he endeavored to obtain
</p>
<p>a jury of the same kidney; but if he had character, posi-
</p>
<p>tion, or wealth, he aimed to get jurors of high standing and
</p>
<p>influence in the community. In a word, he tried to select a
</p>
<p>jury with reference to his defense, and the probability of
</p>
<p>their being influenced by his powers of oratory. When the
</p>
<p>jury was finally impaneled, he regarded his labor as half fin-
</p>
<p>ished. When he had no plausible ground of defense, he
</p>
<p>would endeavor to get before the jury the declarations of
</p>
<p>the prisoner, under the pretense that the prosecution had
</p>
<p>opened the door for their admissibility, and, to lay such a
</p>
<p>foundation, would very adroitly attempt to lead the state
</p>
<p>into a course of examination likely to effect such a result.
</p>
<p>A most remarkable instance of this occurred in the case of
</p>
<p>The State vs. Jackson, for the murder of Laidlaw. At the Va-
</p>
<p>rieties Theater in St. Louis there was a beautiful and talented
</p>
<p>young actress by the name of S . She had been a ballet-
</p>
<p>dancer, but, evincing much talent for tragedy, finally made a
</p>
<p>successful debut on the stage. She was tall, graceful, queen-
</p>
<p>like, and exceedingly attractive in both person and manners.
</p>
<p>As the story goes, she was living in intimate relations with a
</p>
<p>merchant of standing and means, but became enamored with
</p>
<p>Laidlaw, who was a scenic painter at the same theater, and a
</p>
<p>very promising young artist. The attachment was mutual,
</p>
<p>and an engagement of marriage followed. The merchant, on
</p>
<p>learning it, determined to get him out of the way, and hired
</p>
<p>Jackson, who was a man of low instincts, daring and reckless,
</p>
<p>to do the work. Jackson tried all means to provoke a quar-
</p>
<p>rel with Laidlaw, but the easy, good disposition of the latter
</p>
<p>proved an obstacle. He then went to a livery-stable, hired
</p>
<p>a buggy, and invited Laidlaw to take a ride with him to
</p>
<p>the Abbey, a favorite place of resort three miles from the

<p>city, and there they spent two or three hours in playing cards
</p>
<p>and pitching quoits. They then left the Abbey, near night,
</p>
<p>and went out on a road called King's Highway, and that was
</p>
<p>URIEL WRIGHT. 503
</p>
<p>the last seen of Laidlaw alive. His body was found early
</p>
<p>the next morning in the road, with a pistol-ball through his
</p>
<p>head, and Jackson, who had returned the buggy to the livery-
</p>
<p>stable, was arrested for the murder. Upon his trial the evi-
</p>
<p>dence was clear and conclusive against him, but Major Wright
</p>
<p>contended that, inasmuch as the state introduced some decla-
</p>
<p>rations of the prisoner against him, he had a right upon cross-
</p>
<p>examination to introduce all the statements of the accused
</p>
<p>made to the witness on the same day, maintaining that
</p>
<p>though it occurred at different places, and at different times,
</p>
<p>yet it was a part and parcel of the same conversation. The
</p>
<p>point made by Major Wright was sustained by the court, and
</p>
<p>the declaration of Jackson that he killed him in self-defense
</p>
<p>went to the jury. There was not a particle of evidence
</p>
<p>to corroborate it, but the jury, being composed of very
</p>
<p>weak men, were completely carried away by the ingenuity
</p>
<p>and eloquence of Major Wright, and one of the coldest-
</p>
<p>blooded murders ever perpetrated in or around St. Louis
</p>
<p>went unpunished.
</p>
<p>By one of the most powerful forensic efforts we ever
</p>
<p>heard he succeeded in obtaining from another stupid jury a
</p>
<p>verdict of ;$ 100,000 in a breach-of-promise case, in behalf
</p>
<p>of a woman who, to say the least, was proved to be of
</p>
<p>doubtful virtue, against one of the oldest, wealthiest, and
</p>
<p>most esteemed citizens of St. Louis (see our memoir of
</p>
<p>James R. Lackland). It is true, the verdict was set aside,
</p>
<p>and at the next trial, before an intelligent jury, the verdict
</p>
<p>was for the defendant; but the result of the first trial showed
</p>
<p>the great power of Mr. Wright as an advocate. The short
</p>
<p>space necessarily allowed to these memoirs will not admit
</p>
<p>of a reference to other cases in which he greatly distin-
</p>
<p>guished himself as a criminal lawyer.
</p>
<p>It was supposed by many that, inasmuch as his business
</p>
<p>was mostly confined to the Criminal Court, he was in-

</p>
<p>capable of mastering the intricacies of the law arising in
</p>
<p>civil cases. No greater mistake was ever committed, for
</p>
<p>though the labor of legal research was irksome to him, yet
</p>
<p>we have seen him in several civil actions display vq.x\ great
</p>
<p>504 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>legal ability. We once heard him argue a case in the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the state, in which the main question was
</p>
<p>whether a corporation could commit a libel. The question
</p>
<p>was one that had not been adjudicated, at least in this state,
</p>
<p>and the argument of Major Wright, which was very able
</p>
<p>and excited a deep interest, drew from Judge Scott the
</p>
<p>highest encomiums.
</p>
<p>The style of Major Wright's oratory was sni generis. He
</p>
<p>copied from no one and imitated no one ; his gesticulation
</p>
<p>was free, easy, and graceful, and his words flowed from his
</p>
<p>lips like a gentle, placid stream without a ripple. His voice
</p>
<p>was clear and musical, and he could modulate it at his will ;
</p>
<p>his enunciation was distinct, and never harsh or boisterous ;
</p>
<p>his invective sharp, scathing, and witty, but never gross or
</p>
<p>abrupt. He quoted freely from the classics, and often called
</p>
<p>to his aid his fine poetical genius. He was extremely fond
</p>
<p>of light literature, and read everything under that head
</p>
<p>that fell in his way.
</p>
<p>We regret exceedingly our inability to furnish any speci-
</p>
<p>mens of his poetic composition. He published a few of his
</p>
<p>poems, and, among others, one  "Pericles and Aspasia" 
</p>
<p>appeared in the Knickerbocker, a magazine that never pub-
</p>
<p>lished anything but of the first class. Accompanying the
</p>
<p>publication was a notice from the editor, stating " that the
</p>
<p>bard of the West was heard and appreciated on the banks
</p>
<p>of the Hudson."
</p>
<p>Major Wright sent a printed copy of his speech in the
</p>
<p>Chiles case to Prentiss, of Mississippi, and the letter of Mr.
</p>
<p>Prentiss, acknowledging its receipt, was addressed to Major
</p>
<p>Wright as "The Orator of the Mississippi Valley"  no mean
</p>
<p>compliment, coming from a man who was himself regarded
</p>
<p>as the finest curator of his day.
</p>
<p>We have been permitted to peruse a letter, of very recent
</p>
<p>date, from a distinguished man of Virginia, who was a class-

</p>
<p>no one in the class gave promise of greater distinction than
</p>
<p>Major Wright. It is to be regretted that there is no record
</p>
<p>of any of Major Wright's great speeches.
</p>
<p>As Edward Everett truly remarked, "There is no species
</p>
<p>of intellectual labor of the highest order which perishes for
</p>
<p>want of a contemporary record to the same extent as that
</p>
<p>which is daily exerted in the courts of law."
</p>
<p>One of the greatest defects in Major Wright's character
</p>
<p>was a liability to be carried away by every new dogma or
</p>
<p>theory that came along, no matter how untenable. He early
</p>
<p>became an advocate of spiritualism  read everything that
</p>
<p>was written on the subject, attended all the private and
</p>
<p>public exhibitions, and for a long period of time became so
</p>
<p>thoroughly engrossed in it that he would scarcely speak of
</p>
<p>anything else.
</p>
<p>Whether he ever became a convert to mesmerism we are
</p>
<p>not advised, but his mind leaned towards every new-fangled
</p>
<p>doctrine that was strange and startling. We have heard him
</p>
<p>advocate in the strongest terms the doctrine of irresistible
</p>
<p>impulse.
</p>
<p>In the Worrill case he boldly contended before the jury
</p>
<p>that if the prisoner killed Gordon he was driven to it by a
</p>
<p>sudden impulse which he was unable to control, and, there-
</p>
<p>fore, not criminally responsible. By way of illustration he
</p>
<p>told the jury that on one occasion he rose from his bed at
</p>
<p>midnight and went to the room where his son was sleeping,
</p>
<p>with the full determination of taking his life, but found the
</p>
<p>door locked, which prevented him from executing his pur-
</p>
<p>pose. He gave other illustrations of it no less remarkable.
</p>
<p>While we regard him as one of the brightest intellects of
</p>
<p>his time, truth compels us to allude to some of his peculiari-
</p>
<p>ties which are difficult of explanation. They refer chiefly to
</p>
<p>his want of stability and moral power. We have heard him
</p>
<p>in the court-room deliver a philippic against gambling which

</p>
<p>brought tears from every eye, and yet, in a few hours after-
</p>
<p>wards, saw him at a card-table, indulging in a game of draw
</p>
<p>poker. We have heard him speak to a jury of the horrors of
</p>
<p>intemperance and its terrible effects upon the youth of the
</p>
<p>506 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>country, and on the same evening seen him playing billiards,
</p>
<p>and sipping from a glass of brandy. lie was not by any
</p>
<p>means an intemperate man, and only visited such places as
</p>
<p>were frequented by gentlemen, but his indulgence in all
</p>
<p>kinds of amusements and games prevented him from occu-
</p>
<p>pying that high moral position which in all large communities
</p>
<p>is essential to professional success.
</p>
<p>In 1 86 1 he expressed himself very warmly in favor of the
</p>
<p>Union, which induced the anti-secession party to place him on
</p>
<p>their ticket as a candidate for the Convention called to take
</p>
<p>into consideration the relations of the state to the Federal
</p>
<p>government. He was elected  receiving a larger vote than
</p>
<p>any of his colleagues  took his seat, and delivered several
</p>
<p>patriotic addresses in behalf of maintaining the laws and the
</p>
<p>government. At the second session of the same Convention
</p>
<p>he proclaimed himself a secessionist, and made a secession
</p>
<p>speech in front of the Planters' House, and from that time
</p>
<p>became thoroughly identified with the Rebellion. He joined
</p>
<p>General Sterling Price, and was placed on his staff, and after
</p>
<p>the evacuation of Corinth by Beauregard, entered upon the
</p>

<p>with him until ill health forced him to retire from the army.

<p>He then resumed the practice of the law at Winchester, Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, where he remained till his death, which occurred on

<p>February i8, 1869, after a painful illness of three months.

<p>His remains repose in the beautiful valley of the Shen-

<p>Major Wright was fond of political discussion, and often

<p>but never evinced any particular inclination for office or

<p>position. He was a member of the Harrisburg Convention

<p>returning home made a fine canvass in his behalf.

<p>mation than Major Wright, and he was as familiar with the
</p>
<p>poets and dramatic writers as he was with the horn-books
</p>
<p>of his profession. He could quote Shakespeare and other
</p>
<p>leading poets by the hour, and there is scarcely a science to
</p>
<p>URIEL W RIGHT. 507
</p>
<p>which he had not given some attention. To sum it all up,
</p>
<p>he was one of the most gifted men we ever saw.
</p>
<p>Oratory is a gift from the Almighty. It never has been,
</p>
<p>and never can be, acquired. We may improve and adorn it
</p>
<p>by study, application, and practice, but the foundation must
</p>
<p>be laid by One who rules the universe and shapes our des-
</p>
<p>tinw There is nothing mechanical in it. We may study
</p>
<p>language, gesture, voice, motion, attitude, and call to our aid
</p>
<p>all that education and learning and persistent practice can
</p>
<p>furnish ; yet if the great gift is not born in us, any attempt
</p>
<p>at its exhibition will prove abortive. It is a rare gift, and
</p>
<p>the few that possess it have no power to impart it in any
</p>
<p>degree to others, nor are they aware of its possession until
</p>
<p>some great occasion calls it out. For the benefit of the law-
</p>
<p>student or the young practitioner who may be in search of
</p>
<p>professional honors, we here give an extract from the pen
</p>
<p>of Stephen F. Miller, in the appendix to his work on the
</p>
<p>" Bench and Bar of Georgia." He was himself a fine elocu-
</p>
<p>tionist, and his suggestions, if strictly followed, may greatly
</p>
<p>aid the efforts of the young practitioner in acquiring an easy
</p>
<p>and impressive style of speaking. Says Mr. Miller :
</p>
<p>" A false idea of eloquence too commonly prevails. Scholars by profession
</p>
<p>are too apt to consider flowery sentences and musical periods as the very art
</p>
<p>itself, beyond which there is no improvement. These qualities indeed capti-
</p>
<p>vate the taste, but do not constitute eloquence in its purity and force. First of
</p>
<p>all, there must be a purpose in the mind of the speaker, besides showing ofi" his
</p>
<p>pictures of fancy or the beauties of rhetoric. Is a conclusion to be established ?
</p>
<p>Let the facts which lead to it be given with simplicity. The less drapery in the
</p>
<p>narrative, the more distinct the subject-matter. Nature is the best guide. Men
</p>
<p>are accustomed to follow the order of things in making up their judgment.
</p>
<p>The speaker should begin in a modest, subdued style, with his voice rarely
</p>
<p>pitched above the conversational tone. This will give ease and confidence 
</p>
<p>two very essential cords to bind an audience in silent attention. * * *
</p>
<p>Here lies the secret of eloquence  self-possession in the orator, and a definite

<p>object in view, earnestly pursued. It is an error to suppose that the treasures
</p>
<p>of the mind must be poured forth in a constant stream of rich language, or that
</p>
<p>the ideas of the speaker must be adorned with poetic softness of expression,
</p>
<p>verging on the wild melody of Ossian. This strain can be indulged only as an
</p>
<p>exercise to work the fancy into a proper mold for the combination of truth
</p>
<p>and feeling, with no effort at scholarship other than an easy style. Whenever
</p>
<p>508 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>it is perceived that the speaker is on stilts to show himself, he loses the
</p>
<p>sympathy of his audience. It is, therefore, important to cultivate an artless
</p>
<p>yet graceful diction, with learning and taste so gently blended that minds of
</p>
<p>severe cast may he satisfied, while those of a different structure or of less
</p>
<p>refinement may consider the feast as prepared especially for them. Much will
</p>
<p>depend on the occasion, and the judgment of the speaker. No rules can be
</p>
<p>laid down applicable to all situations. The best general hint is conveyed in a
</p>
<p>brief sentence : C}ood sense, strong impressions, and a deliberate manner. To
</p>
<p>shine in debate, however desired by all, is the privilege of only a few. * * *
</p>
<p>The heart is the reservoir of all that is truly good and persuasive. Smooth
</p>
<p>sentences and formal illustrations, aiming only to impress others with the
</p>
<p>refinement of the speaker, can never excite the feelings. A sense of pleasure
</p>
<p>may be experienced ; but the utmost that can be claimed for such artistic skill
</p>
<p>is a mastery of language under the control of classic taste  a qualification
</p>
<p>often possessed by men who never felt or observed enough of life to know the
</p>
<p>springs of human action, or with what force to touch the heart to awake its
</p>
<p>deepest responses.
</p>
<p>" .\11 nature is suggestive of elof|uence ; and he who trusts to his books alone,
</p>
<p>and til his own solitary sjieculations, for the power of moving men, will find
</p>
<p>himself grievously deluded."
</p>
<p>The decline of eloquence, more particularly in our large
</p>
<p>commercial cities, is noticeable to all practitioners, and re-
</p>
<p>sults, no doubt, from the fact that the profession find it more
</p>
<p>remunerative to devote their time to commercial law, the
</p>
<p>law of insurance, proceedings in bankruptcy, patent-right
</p>
<p>cases, and other branches that present no field for oratorical
</p>
<p>display.
</p>
<p>We will conclude this narrative with an extract from some
</p>
<p>remarks of Judge M. R. Cullen, on presenting to the St.
</p>
<p>Louis Circuit Court the resolutions adopted at a meeting of
</p>
<p>the St. Louis bar shortly after the death of Major Wright.
</p>
<p>Judge Cullen knew Major Wright long and intimately, and
</p>
<p>being himself a good elocutionist, his opinion of Major

<p>Wright's powers in that department will be generally ac-

<p>cepted as correct. Said the judge :
</p>
<p>" No lawyer excelled him in the practical management of a case. His suc-
</p>
<p>cess' in civil cases was great, but as a criminal lawyer and advocate unraveling
</p>
<p>to a jury the intricate action of the human heart he stood among us unrivaled.
</p>
<p>Before a public audience, also, discussing the political questions of the day,
</p>
<p>his eloquence was superbly in the ascendant, and the conservatism of his

</p>
<p>thought, l^rilliancy of language, and appropriateness of illustration won
</p>
<p>the hearts and judgments of his hearers. As a colloquist he was admitted
</p>
<p>to be, by those who knew him, almost the superior of any pulilic man of his
</p>
<p>period. He had that same combination of talent, wit, mirth, humor, and
</p>
<p>solidity which made his colloquial powers as controlling and winning as his
</p>
<p>forensic efforts. He did not force himself by pedantry on the listener, or
</p>
<p>monopolize the conversation by long and studied elocutionary matter, but

<p>elicited the opinions of others, and could be even eloquent in his silence."
</p>
<p>DeWitt c. Ballou,
</p>
<p>A leading lawyer for many years at Warsaw, Benton County,
</p>
<p>was a native of the state of New York, and born, as near as
</p>
<p>we can ascertain, about the year 1814. He received an aca-
</p>
<p>demic education, became a good English scholar, and was
</p>
<p>tolerably well versed in the classics. The common-school
</p>
<p>system in that day was very imperfect, but in almost every
</p>
<p>town and village of New York there was an incorporated
</p>
<p>academy in which were taught not only the higher branches
</p>
<p>of mathematics, but also Latin and not unfrequently Greek,
</p>
<p>so that a diligent student might readily acquire as good an
</p>
<p>education as can now be obtained in many of our second-
</p>
<p>class colleges.
</p>
<p>After Mr. Ballou completed his law studies he went to
</p>
<p>Michigan, with the intention of pursuing his profession in
</p>
<p>that state ; but could not have remained there long, for in
</p>
<p>J 837 we find him a citizen of Benton County, Missouri, only
</p>
<p>two years after the organization of the county, and in 1838
</p>
<p>he was one of a commission appointed to proceed to Spring-
</p>
<p>field and take out in the Land Office there a preemption right
</p>
<p>on a quarter-section of land which had been selected for a
</p>
<p>county-seat under the name of Warsaw. Mr. Ballou was one
</p>
<p>of the first trustees of the town, and immediately took up his
</p>
<p>residence there. In 1839 he was appointed county surveyor,
</p>
<p>which office he held about one year. The population of
</p>
<p>Warsaw increased very slowly, for in 1 844 it had onl)' reached
</p>
<p>516. In 1839-40 Mr. Ballou held the office of justice of the
</p>
<p>peace, which at that time required a man of great nerve and
</p>
<p>mature judgment, for it was during what was called the
</p>
<p>''Slicker IVa/;" and so intense was the excitement in Benton
</p>
<p>and the adjacent counties that the governor was forced to
</p>
<p>call out the state militia to preserve the public peace. A

</p>
<p>1839, near Warsaw, and a personal difficulty occurred be-
</p>
<p>tween them and a family by the name of Jones, resulting in
</p>
<p>the death of one or two. The people began to take sides
</p>
<p>with one or the other, and finally a general outbreak took
</p>
<p>place, in which many were killed, resulting in a general reign
</p>
<p>of terror and violence beyond the power of the law to subdue.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ballou exerted his authority to the utmost, and showed
</p>
<p>great presence of mind and nerve, and was finally placed in
</p>
<p>command of a military force which alone proved effectual in
</p>
<p>the restoration of law and order.
</p>
<p>In 1842 we met Mr. Ballou in the General Assembly of the
</p>
<p>state, he representing Benton County and we the county of
</p>
<p>Franklin. In 1844 both of us were reelected, and we had the
</p>
<p>pleasure of nominating him for speaker pro tern., the duties
</p>
<p>of which he discharged very satisfactorily to the House.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ballou was reelected in 1848 and in i860, and was a
</p>
<p>member at the time that the Legislature, in 1861, fled from
</p>
<p>the Capitol, in apprehension of being arrested by General
</p>
<p>Lyon, who but shortly before had captured Camp Jackson.
</p>
<p>It always seemed strange to us that Mr. Ballou should have
</p>
<p>allied himself with the Rebellion, for by birth and education
</p>
<p>he was a Northern man, and could have had no particular
</p>
<p>predilection for slavery ; but he must have been greatly in-
</p>
<p>fluenced by the fact that a large majority of the Legislature
</p>
<p>were secessionists, and as the county of Benton received its
</p>
<p>population chiefly from Kentucky and Tennessee, the proba-
</p>
<p>bility is that secession was the prevailing sentiment in the
</p>
<p>county.
</p>
<p>In 1854 a vacancy occurred in the judgeship of his circuit,
</p>
<p>by the resignation of Hon. V/aldo P. Johnson, and Mr. Bal-
</p>
<p>lou was elected to fill it. At the expiration of the term he
</p>
<p>was reielected, and after serving one year of the last term re-
</p>
<p>signed and resumed his practice. He was four years upon
</p>
<p>the bench.

</p>
<p>During the war Judge Ballou took up his residence in Se-
</p>
<p>dalia, not feeling that his family were safe in Warsaw. He
</p>
<p>died in Sedalia in the fall of 1864, and at the time must have
</p>
<p>reached his fiftieth year.

<p>512 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Judge Ballou was a man of vigorous intellect, and of un-
</p>
<p>doubted legal attainments. He stood high at the South-
</p>
<p>western bar, and always enjoyed an excellent practice. He
</p>
<p>had none of the gifts of oratory, and never attempted any-
</p>
<p>thing beyond a logical statement of the facts of the case and
</p>
<p>the law as applicable to them. He had a good command of
</p>
<p>language, but was often prosy and tedious. He had a strong
</p>
<p>and clear voice, without the power of modulating it, and
</p>
<p>when he rose to address a jury, or promiscuous assembly, he
</p>
<p>raised it to a high pitch, and there it remained till the close.
</p>
<p>He was aware of this defect, but could never remedy it.
</p>
<p>While in the Legislature he became greatly absorbed in
</p>
<p>the subject of the improvement of the Osage River, a stream
</p>
<p>that flowed through his county, and which during a portion
</p>
<p>of the year was navigable for steamers of light tonnage. The
</p>
<p>state at that time was very averse to embarking in any system
</p>
<p>of internal improvements, and Mr. Ballou met with serious
</p>
<p>opposition in all his efforts in that direction.
</p>
<p>We never saw him on the bench, but lawyers who prac-
</p>
<p>ticed before him speak well of his judicial career. Judge
</p>
<p>Ballou was a man of excellent habits, and always sustained
</p>
<p>the character of an upright and exemplary citizen. He

<p>raised a family, but how many children survive him we are

</p>
<p>THOMAS S. RICHARDSON,
</p>
<p>Who was a judge of the Fourth Judicial Circuit, composed
</p>
<p>of the counties of Lewis, Scotland, Clark, Knox, Adair, and
</p>
<p>Schuyler, was born in Frankfort, Kentucky, on or about
</p>
<p>October 5, 18 19. His father, James A. Richardson, was a
</p>
<p>farmer, and moved to Missouri when Thomas was about ten
</p>
<p>years of age, and settled on a farm near Monticello, in
</p>
<p>Lewis County. Thomas assisted his father in cultivating the
</p>
<p>farm, and at the same time went to a country school, where
</p>
<p>he obtained the rudiments of an English education, and, when
</p>
<p>old enough to commence the study of the law, entered the
</p>
<p>law-office of Reese & Green, at Monticello. The firm con-
</p>
<p>sisted of Addison Reese, who afterwards became judge of
</p>
<p>that circuit, and James S. Green, late United States senator.
</p>
<p>Young Richardson applied himself very closely to his studies
</p>
<p>for about eighteen months, and was then admitted to the
</p>
<p>practice, at the age of twenty-one, by Judge McBride. He
</p>
<p>shortly afterwards married Miss Minerva Asbury, and located
</p>
<p>in Scotland County, and when Memphis became the county-
</p>
<p>seat, moved to that place, where he resided until his de.ith.
</p>
<p>In 1848 he was chosen to represent his county in the
</p>
<p>lower house of the General Assembly  served two years,
</p>
<p>and was then elected to the State Senate, and served the full
</p>
<p>term of four years. He made an excellent representative,
</p>
<p>and took an active and prominent part in the proceedings.
</p>
<p>He was a very decided Democrat, but not a violent politi-
</p>
<p>cian, and enjoyed the confidence and good-will of his fellow-
</p>
<p>members. Neither at the bar nor in the Legislature did he
</p>
<p>make any pretensions as an elocutionist. He spoke fluently
</p>
<p>and with ease, and always commanded the attention of his
</p>
<p>hearers.

</p>
<p>his life in 1861. He made a good judge  was fair and im-
</p>
<p>partial in his decisions, and endeavored to dispense the law
</p>
<p>without fear, favor, or affection. He had not been on the
</p>
<p>bench long enough to establish a high reputation as a jurist,
</p>
<p>but long enough to show that he was a man of the highest
</p>
<p>integrity and great honesty of purpose.
</p>
<p>In November, 1861, he fell a victim to the spirit of discord
</p>
<p>and anarchy which at that time spread uncontrolled over the
</p>
<p>state. He sympathized strongly with the South, but took
</p>
<p>no part in the Rebellion beyond a free expression of his opin-
</p>
<p>ions ; but that was enough to make enemies among those who
</p>
<p>were enthusiastic in behalf of the Union, and, like all men of
</p>
<p>positive character, he had strong enemies as well as strong
</p>
<p>friends.
</p>
<p>One of his personal friends. Colonel David Moore, had
</p>
<p>organized a Union regiment in that part of the state, which
</p>
<p>was stationed at one time at Canton, but was ordered to
</p>
<p>Memphis, the county-seat of Scotland County, where, as
</p>
<p>before stated. Judge Richardson resided. Colonel Moore
</p>
<p>had learned that threats had been made against Judge Rich-
</p>
<p>ardson, and, as the judge was his friend and a brother
</p>
<p>Mason, he was anxious to protect him from any violence.
</p>
<p>For that purpose he detailed some ten or fifteen men to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed to Memphis in advance of the regiment, and to take
</p>
<p>the judge and a few others into custody, with instructions to
</p>
<p>defend them from any attack that might be made upon
</p>
<p>them. The arrest was made with a full knowledge, on the
</p>
<p>part of the judge, of the purpose. They were conveyed to
</p>
<p>a room on the second floor of the court-house. It being a
</p>
<p>cold and disagreeable day, and no fire in the room, some one
</p>
<p>proposed that they should go below into the clerk's office,
</p>
<p>where there was a good fire, and they did so. It was shortly
</p>
<p>after dark, and the office becoming unpleasantly warm, the
</p>
<p>judge raised the window a few inches to let the air in, when

<p>he received a musket-ball through his head, just above the
</p>
<p>eyes, killing him instantly. When Colonel Moore heard of
</p>
<p>it he became very indignant, and pronounced it a cold-
</p>
<p>blooded murder. He went in person to the judge's residence,
</p>
<p>THOMAS S. RICHARDSON. 515
</p>
<p>and imparted to his wife the sad intelligence. He also dis-
</p>
<p>patched General Halleck, who was stationed at St. Louis,
</p>
<p>and the general sent up two detectives to ferret out the
</p>
<p>assassin. Colonel Moore found a buckskin glove outside,
</p>
<p>and immediately under the window, which he took charge of,
</p>
<p>and upon the arrival of the detectives handed it to them, and
</p>
<p>this furnished a clue to the murderer. He paraded the regi-
</p>
<p>ment before the detectives, and one of them recognized the
</p>
<p>mate to the glove upon the hand of a soldier. He was im-
</p>
<p>mediately arrested and sent to the Palmyra Jail for trial,
</p>
<p>but some few weeks afterwards broke jail and escaped, and
</p>
<p>has never since been heard of. It was a tragic death, and
</p>
<p>the assassin richly deserved the halter.

<p>Judge Richardson must have reached his fortieth year.
</p>
<p>Charles C. Mauro.
</p>
<p>Mr. Mauro was a prominent member of the St. Louis bar,
</p>
<p>and filled several positions of trust and honor. He was of
</p>
<p>German descent, his father and mother having been born in
</p>
<p>Stuttgart. They came to the United States when quite
</p>
<p>young, and settled in Washington City, where Charles was
</p>
<p>born in 1827.
</p>
<p>The author has a very vivid recollection of his father,
</p>
<p>Philip Mauro, who was an auctioneer in the city of Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, and carried on an extensive business on Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>Avenue. Though but ten years of age, we frequently visited
</p>
<p>his auction-rooms to listen to his sallies of wit and humor.
</p>
<p>He was a man of great jest, and never failed to amuse and
</p>
<p>entertain his patrons, particularly the urchins, as we were
</p>
<p>called. He was very fond of children, and we congregated
</p>
<p>in his rooms in large numbers, and when he got oflf anything
</p>
<p>that pleased us we cheered him most vociferously. He was
</p>
<p>a skillful auctioneer, and it was a trite saying that Phil
</p>
<p>Mauro could convert anything into money, from an old
</p>
<p>horse-shoe to a blind mule. His wife's brother, whose name
</p>
<p>was Ott, was a man of considerable enterprise, and a me-
</p>
<p>chanical genius, and it is said that he started, at Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>the first mint in the United States.
</p>
<p>Charles C. Mauro was the youngest of nine children, and
</p>
<p>came with his father to St. Louis when quite young, and
</p>

</p>
<p>dren, and in 1868 he was married to Julia Randolph, of St.
</p>
<p>Louis, by whom he had one child.
</p>
<p> Mr. Mauro was appointed city attorney of St. Louis in
</p>
<p>1852, and afterwards elected circuit attorney, and in 1861
</p>
<p>received from the Hon. Daniel G. Taylor, then mayor of the
</p>
<p>city, the appointment of city counselor, an office we held
</p>
<p>three years immediately preceding him. President Johnson
</p>
<p>appointed' him United States district attorney for the Eastern
</p>
<p>District of Missouri, but the nomination was rejected by the
</p>
<p>Senate  not because of any objection that existed against
</p>
<p>Mr. Mauro, who was a consistent Democrat, but because of
</p>
<p>the hostility of the Senate to the president. It will be rec-
</p>
<p>ollected that the Senate rejected nearly all of the presi-
</p>
<p>dent's appointments, in order to make him as odious as
</p>
<p>possible to the people.
</p>
<p>Upon the breaking-out of the war Mr. Mauro sympathized
</p>
<p>with the South, and, though he committed no overt act
</p>
<p>against the government, was generally regarded as a strong
</p>
<p>disunionist, and became obnoxious to the friends of the
</p>
<p>Union, and upon one occasion was attacked near his resi-
</p>
<p>dence by a body of Germans, but was not seriously injured.
</p>
<p>He died very suddenly, from apoplexy, in 1865, and was
</p>
<p>buried at Bellefontaine.
</p>
<p>We formed the acquaintance of Mr. Mauro as early as
</p>
<p>1852, and knew him well from that time until his death,
</p>
<p>though we did not often come in conflict at the bar, for
</p>
<p>most of his practice was in the Criminal Court, while ours
</p>
<p>was confined to the civil courts. He formed several part-
</p>
<p>nerships during his professional career; at one time was a
</p>
<p>partner of the Hon. William C. Jones, present judge of the
</p>
<p>Criminal Court, at another he was associated with the Hon.
</p>
<p>William T. Wood, present judge of the Sixth Judicial Cir-
</p>
<p>cuit, and at still another period with Henry Laughlin, Esq.
</p>
<p>He was a prominent member of the society of Odd-Fel-

</p>
<p>belonged to a military company called the " St. Louis
</p>
<p>Grays," and was with that company at the noted Gasconade
</p>
<p>Bridge disaster, though he escaped without a serious injury.

</p>
<p>As a lawyer Mr. Mauro was far above the average of at-
</p>
<p>torneys. It could not be said of him, as we are too often
</p>
<p>forced to say of others, that he skimmed along the surface,
</p>
<p>picking up a little law here and a little there, for he was
</p>
<p>well-read and thoroughly grounded in the principles of his
</p>
<p>profession. Without being eloquent, he was a bold, lucid,
</p>
<p>and impressive speaker. As a prosecutor his success was
</p>
<p>very great, which was alone evidence of his ability, for it
</p>
<p>brought him in conflict with such men as Wright, Johnson,
</p>
<p>Shreve, Cline, and others, all of whom became distinguished
</p>
<p>as criminal lawyers. Few men at the bar displayed so
</p>
<p>much skill and power in the cross-examination of a witness
</p>
<p>as Mr. Mauro. If satisfied that the witness was perjuring
</p>
<p>himself, he was almost certain to break him down by the
</p>
<p>rapidity and ingenuity of his questions. He was a bold and
</p>
<p>fearless prosecutor, and offenders against the law stood
</p>
<p>greatly in awe of him.
</p>
<p>Upon his death the St. Louis bar paid the usual tribute to
</p>
<p>his memory. His remains repose in the beautiful cemetery

</p>
<p>Benjamin P. Major.
</p>
<p>We made the acquaintance of Mr. Major at Warren, in
</p>
<p>Benton County, in 1842, where he was located as a prac-
</p>
<p>ticing lawyer. We met him once afterwards in Jefferson
</p>
<p>City, and transacted some professional business with him.
</p>
<p>He was born in Franklin County, Kentucky, on March lO,
</p>
<p>1809, and received a very ordinary education. As a boy he
</p>
<p>showed a strong aversion to books, and a positive dislike
</p>
<p>to the discipline and confinement of the school-room, and
</p>
<p>spent more than half of his time in hunting, fishing, and
</p>
<p>other amusements. When he reached his eighteenth year
</p>
<p>he refused to attend school any longer, and his father ap-
</p>
<p>prenticed him to a carpenter, with whom he learned the
</p>
<p>trade. After the expiration of his apprenticeship, he married
</p>
<p>and settled on a small farm, working at his trade in the win-
</p>
<p>ter. After attaining his twenty-first year he began to feel
</p>
<p>the want of an education, and, by studying at night, endeav-
</p>
<p>ored to make up, to some extent, for the time he had lost and
</p>
<p>misspent.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1835 he removed to Missouri and settled
</p>
<p>at Monticello, Lewis County, where he followed his trade
</p>
<p>until 1837, when he was compelled to abandon it by reason
</p>
<p>of ill health. His physician advised him to engage in some
</p>
<p>other pursuit, and he immediately entered upon the study of
</p>
<p>the law, and, in the fall of 1839, entered the Transylvania
</p>
<p>Law School, where he graduated in 1840. He then returned
</p>
<p>to Missouri, was admitted to the bar, and, in 1841, commenced
</p>
<p>the practice in Warsaw, where he remained till his death.
</p>
<p>Few men, under such adverse circumstances, would have em-
</p>
<p>barked in a profession in which so few, even with the advan-
</p>
<p>tages of a thorough education and the best mental training,

</p>
<p>have been able to succeed. His strong natural ability, added
</p>
<p>520 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>to his genial habits, soon made him friends and secured for
</p>
<p>him a fair practice.
</p>
<p>In 1842 Mr. Major was elected to the State Senate from
</p>
<p>the district composed of the counties of Benton, Pettis, etc.
</p>
<p>In 1844, while still a senator, he became engaged in a per-
</p>
<p>sonal controversy with Elijah Cherry, who had been a judge
</p>
<p>of the Benton County Court, growing out of a political contest.
</p>
<p>They encountered each other on one of the principal streets
</p>
<p>of Warsaw, on March 14th, and Mr. Major was killed. At the
</p>
<p>time of his death he had nearly reached his thirty-fifth year.
</p>
<p>He left a widow and four or five children.
</p>
<p>He was cut down in the morning of life, and just as he was
</p>
<p>beginning to reap the reward of perseverance and unremit
</p>
<p>ting toil. He was truly a self-made man, with no other capi-
</p>
<p>tal to stand upon than good, hard common sense, with an
</p>
<p>indomitable will and untiring energy. He allied himself to
</p>
<p>the Democratic party, and in the State Senate occupied a
</p>
<p>commanding position ; for he was a ready and earnest de-
</p>
<p>bater, and popular with his brother members, and enjoyed
</p>
<p>the full confidence of his party. Mr. Major was not a pro-
</p>
<p>found lawyer, but as an advocate had no superior at the
</p>
<p>Benton bar. This enabled him to command a good practice,
</p>
<p>for, as a general thing, in the early settlement of a country
</p>
<p>a lawyer's capacity is measured by his ability as a public

</p>
<p>speaker.
</p>
<p>James S. Green.
</p>
<p>Among the able men of Missouri who figured at a late
</p>
<p>date, and belonged to a late generation, no one enjoyed a
</p>
<p>higher reputation for ability than the subject of this sketch,
</p>
<p>who, prior to the late war, was a United States senator.
</p>
<p>He was born in Virginia in 1817, and came to Missouri
</p>
<p>in 1837 or 1838, with no other educational advantages than
</p>
<p>he was able to derive from the common-field schools of the
</p>
<p>Old Dominion. After coming to Missouri he worked on a
</p>
<p>farm in Lewis County, performing such labor as is common
</p>
<p>with farming hands. By devoting his leisure hours to read-
</p>
<p>ing he improved his imperfect education, and, turning his
</p>
<p>attention to the study of the law, in due time was ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to the bar and commenced the practice in Lewis
</p>
<p>County. He formed a partnership with Addison Reese,
</p>
<p>Esq., an able lawyer, who became judge of the Lewis Judi-
</p>
<p>cial Circuit. It proved a strong firm and did a large busi-
</p>
<p>ness. They practiced in the courts of Lewis, Clark, Scot-
</p>
<p>land, Marion, and Ralls. Mr. Green soon proved himself
</p>
<p>able to cope with the best lawyers of that section, which
</p>
<p>was no little praise when we reflect that among them were
</p>
<p>such men as Glover, Broadhead, Dryden, Porter, Anderson,
</p>
<p>Richmond, Lipsicomb, and others.
</p>
<p>We first met Mr. Green at Jefferson City, during the
</p>
<p>session of the General Assembly of 1844-5. He was then
</p>
<p>quite a young man, and was appointed to one of the princi-
</p>
<p>pal clerkships, whether of the House or Senate we are not
</p>
<p>now able to state. He had, however, been previously
</p>
<p>elected to the Convention of 1845, called to revise the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution. It was in this body that he first exhibited that
</p>
<p>talent for forensic debate which in after-life so distinguished
</p>
<p>him. He grappled with the ablest members of the Conven-
</p>
<p>tion, and at once took rank among the foremost. His

</p>
<p>knowledge of constitutional law left no doubt of his thor-
</p>
<p>522 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>ough mental training. He was an ardent supporter of the
</p>
<p>state-rights doctrine, and opposed to the exercise of any
</p>
<p>power not expressed or so clearly implied as to leave no
</p>
<p>room for construction ; in other words, he was a strict-con-
</p>
<p>structionist and an uncompromising Democrat, and had he
</p>
<p>adhered to the doctrines of Jefferson, and not permitted
</p>
<p>himself to be led astray by the sophistry of the Calhoun
</p>
<p>school, he might have attained the highest eminence that
</p>
<p>any laudable ambition could aspire to. He entirely mistook
</p>
<p>the sentiment of the people of his own state, and made him-
</p>
<p>self antagonistic to their interests.
</p>
<p>In 1846 Mr. Green was elected to Congress, and served
</p>
<p>two consecutive terms, during the last of which he was our
</p>
<p>colleague, which enables us to bear testimony to the high
</p>
<p>reputation he there acquired. It is not often that the
</p>
<p>Federal House of Representatives furnishes an occasion or
</p>
<p>opportunity for the exhibition of talent. In so large a body,
</p>
<p>with so many restrictions upon debate, it is only about once
</p>
<p>or twice in a session that the privilege of the floor, during
</p>
<p>an important debate, is awarded to any member, and if a
</p>
<p>young member succeeds in obtaining it once he is esteemed
</p>
<p>fortunate. Mr. Green, however, made several speeches,
</p>
<p>which attracted the attention of the country and received
</p>
<p>the favorable notice of the press.
</p>
<p>In 1852 President Polk appointed him charge d' affaires,
</p>
<p>and subsequently minister resident, at Bogota, New Granada ;
</p>
<p>but the position was too monotonous for him, and led him
</p>
<p>too far from the active field of politics, and he soon re-
</p>
<p>turned to Missouri.
</p>
<p>In 1856 he was reelected to Congress, but before its meet-
</p>
<p>ing he was chosen by the Legislature United States sena-
</p>
<p>tor, which trust he continued to hold until 1861, when he
</p>
<p>was expelled for disloyalty. This terminated his public life.
</p>
<p>Mr. Green's career in the Senate was brilliant. It gave

</p>
<p>him ample means to display his great ability in debate. In
</p>
<p>almost every important contest he participated, and held his
</p>
<p>own with such men as Douglas, Clayton, Chase, Seward,
</p>
<p>and statesmen of that class, and he at once acquired a na-
</p>
<p>tional reputation. We have never assigned to Mr. Green that
</p>
<p>JAMES S. GREEN. 523
</p>
<p>position as an orator which his intimate friends claimed for
</p>
<p>him, but he undoubtedly stood head and shoulders above the
</p>
<p>average statesman. He had few of the graces of oratory-
</p>
<p>such as were possessed by Mr. Clay, Mr. Berrien, Mr. Everett,
</p>
<p>Mr. Prentiss, Mr. Bates, Mr. Wright, and others we could
</p>
<p>mention. At times his gesticulation was stiff and unnatural,
</p>
<p>and not unfrequently he indulged in a self-complacent laugh,
</p>
<p>indicating a consciousness of victory, which always deterio-
</p>
<p>rates from the effectiveness of a speaker. That he was a
</p>
<p>close, logical reasoner, and possessed great powers of dis-
</p>
<p>crimination and analyzation, no one who ever heard him can
</p>
<p>question. These, with his exceeding quickness of perception
</p>
<p>and rare gift of repartee, made him a dangerous antagonist
</p>
<p>to encounter in even so intellectual a body as the Federal
</p>
<p>Senate. He never participated in a discussion without first
</p>
<p>making himself the master of his subject, which gave him a
</p>
<p>great advantage over a less cautious opponent. This was
</p>
<p>true of Colonel Benton, who, in the memorable debate on the
</p>
<p>Territorial Omnibus Bill, greatly annoyed Mr. Clay by cor-
</p>
<p>recting his geographical errors.
</p>
<p>Mr. Green's power of repartee was one of his strongest
</p>
<p>weapons in debate. It is a rare gift, and is oftener found
</p>
<p>among the Scotch and Irish orators than those of any other
</p>
<p>nation. Who does not recollect the famous reply of James
</p>
<p>Boswell to his father. Lord Auchinbeck, while he was plead-
</p>
<p>ing before him at the Scotch bar? The old judge, offended
</p>
<p>at something his son had said, peevishly exclaimed, " Jemie,
</p>
<p>ye're an ass, man."
</p>
<p>"Not exactly, my lord," answered the junior; "only a
</p>
<p>colt, the foal of an ass."
</p>
<p>Mr. Green's chief reputation was obtained in the Senate,
</p>
<p>in the debate between himself and Mr. Douglas in 1859,
</p>
<p>upon the territorial or squatter-sovereignty question. In a
</p>
<p>running debate they had no superiors, and when they came

<p>in conflict it was Greek meeting Greek.
</p>
<p>Space will not permit us to give even a synopsis of the
</p>
<p>discussion, but the following will impart to the reader some
</p>
<p>idea of Mr. Green's power in a hand-to-hand conflict :
</p>
<p>524 BENCH AND BAR OF MJSSOUIU.
</p>
<p>"Mr. (]rkf.n. It has been admitted by the senator" from Illinois that Con-
</p>
<p>gress has the same power, and the territory has the same power, and no more,
</p>
<p>over slaves as other property in the territory. Now, I ask this question dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly, in the presence of the senator, can the Territorial Legislature of Kansas,
</p>
<p>Nebraska, or Utah prohibit the introduction of any other kind of property?
</p>
<p>Can they discriminate in regard to any kind of property? For I hold if they
</p>
<p>cannot by direct means prohibit it, neither can they by dishonest indirect means
</p>
<p>accomplish the same thing. That which you cannot do directly you cannot do
</p>
<p>indirectly; and it is a dishonest subterfuge to presume that such will be done.
</p>
<p>Can you prohibit the introduction of mules, of horses, of plows, of patent
</p>
<p>reapers? No; they are property known to the Constitution. Are not slaves
</p>
<p>property known to the Constitution ? Yes. Can they, then, be prohibited?
</p>
<p>The senator says. Yes; I answer, No. The power to prohibit one is coexten-
</p>
<p>sive with the power to prohibit the other; and no legislative authority in the
</p>
<p>territory or out of the territory will permit of a discrimination between differ-
</p>
<p>ent species of property, so far as its protection and security are concerned.
</p>
<p>* * * But it has been admitted by the senator from Illinois, and I hold
</p>
<p>him to the admission, that a territory has no power except what is conferred by
</p>
<p>Congress. Is there any power to make such discrimination in the organic act
</p>
<p>creating the territorial government ? '
</p>
<p>"The senator says  and I was sorry to hear him say it, for I have the
</p>
<p>highest regard for him, not only as a man, but as a jurist  that under no cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances could he be induced to intervene, by the action of Congress, to
</p>
<p>protect the rights of persons to slaves in any territory. I was sorry to hear it.
</p>
<p>I have said that the South do not ask it now, because, as yet, they have never
</p>
<p>seen the necessity; and the time may come when it will be proper this power
</p>
<p>should be exercised. The power certainly exists. But I was sorry for another
</p>
<p>reason. When Utah, by her misconduct, had propagated polygamy, the sena-
</p>
<p>tor was loudest and foremost to propose the intervention of Congress to stop
</p>
<p>it. 'Yes, that is a case that will justify Congress in intervening.' 'Stop
</p>
<p>polygamy  '
</p>
<p>"Mr. Douglas. When? Where? When did I speak so loud for inter-
</p>
<p>vention to stop polygamy ? When? Where? What measure? What speech ?
</p>
<p>What report?

<p>"Mr. (JREEN. Well, Mr. President, I said loudest, because he generally
</p>
<p>speaks loudest. I said tvhen, because it was the 12th day of June, 1857, and
</p>
<p>where, because it was said at Springfield, Illinois.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Douglas. I deny it. That speech will show I was for repealing
</p>
<p>the organic act because they were alien enemies to the United States, and not
</p>
<p>because of that domestic institution.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Green. I have got the speech before me, and I generally speak by
</p>
<p>the record.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Douglas. Read it.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Green. I know he lugged in other considerations, but he did not
</p>
<p>confine himself to them. He did say they were alien enemies, but it was their
</p>
<p>misconduct, including polygamy, that he complained of. He had given them
</p>
<p>an organic act, and he then said, I will take it from you.
</p>
<p>JAMES S. GREEN. 525
</p>
<p>"Mr. Douglas. Read it.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Green. I 'ioill read it. I know of wliat I speak. You had no evi-
</p>
<p>dence of it then. N'oii have no evidence of it to-day. It was an assumption
</p>
<p>then. It is an assumption to-day. Hut whether so or not, it cannot change
</p>
<p>the power of Congress to interfere, if the public good re(]uires it. But you
</p>
<p>wz7/ intervene. Why? Because it is assumed they are aUen enemies. How do
</p>
<p>you know but what there are alien enemies in Kansas, judging from their acts,
</p>
<p>as there are in Utah ? How do you know that there are not as many in Nebraska
</p>
<p>as in Utah ? But he will not intervene there, for those alien enemies only
</p>
<p>destroy the rights of slave property; but he will intervene in Utah, for those
</p>
<p>alien enemies propagate polygamy.
</p>
<p>" That is the doctrine of the senator, and he cannot escape from it. Now I
</p>
<p>will read the extract from his speech on the subject, and see whether he did not
</p>
<p>claim the right to protect persons and ])ro|)erty by congressional intervention."
</p>
<p>[Here Mr. Green read from the Springfield speech, and
</p>
<p>the debate between them continued. Should the reader feel
</p>
<p>any inclination to peruse the entire discussion, he will find
</p>
<p>it in the Congressional Globe, part II, 1858-9.]
</p>
<p>Mr. Green became one of the most active supporters of
</p>
<p>the Rebellion, and, as in the case of Governor Polk, it proved
</p>
<p>his political grave. He was destitute of any military capac-
</p>
<p>ity, and the South presented no field in which he could
</p>
<p>obtain any renown. He sacrificed everything for a cause in
</p>
<p>which he had nothing to gain and all to lose.
</p>
<p>After the war he settled in St. Louis, with the intention of
</p>
<p>returning to his profession, but his health, which had become
</p>
<p>impaired by irregular habits, soon gave way, and on January
</p>
<p>19, 1870, he departed this life, at the age of about fifty-two,
</p>
<p>leaving a family to mourn his loss. Meetings of the bar in
</p>
<p>St. Louis and elsewhere were held, and the usual tributes of
</p>
<p>respect paid to his memory.

<p>and thin, with features somewhat resembling Mr. Clay 
</p>
<p>indeed, he resembled Mr. Clay in more respects than one.
</p>
<p>He had that clearness of voice, distinct enunciation, and
</p>
<p>high and commanding figure which were so conspicuous in
</p>
<p>the great Kentucky statesman.
</p>
<p>PRIESTLY H. MCBRIDE.
</p>
<p>This gentleman was a judge of the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>Missouri during 1845 and 1846.
</p>
<p>He was a native of Kentucky, and born, raised, and
</p>
<p>educated near Harrodsburg. He received a good educa-
</p>
<p>tion, studied law in Kentucky, came to Missouri when quite
</p>
<p>young, and located in Columbia, Boone County. On De-
</p>
<p>cember II, 1830, he was commissioned as judge of the Sec-
</p>
<p>ond Judicial Circuit.
</p>
<p>On January i, 1836, the Legislature adopted and passed
</p>
<p>a constitutional amendment which, among other things,
</p>
<p>vacated all the judicial offices. Judge McBride, however,
</p>
<p>refused to give up his office, stating as a reason that the
</p>
<p>amendment had not passed by the requisite majority, and
</p>
<p>alleging, also, other irregularities. An information in the
</p>
<p>nature of a writ of quo zvarranto was taken against him,
</p>
<p>requiring him to show cause by what authority or commis-
</p>
<p>sion he continued to exercise the duties of the office, etc.
</p>
<p>In answer to this the defendant pleaded his commission of
</p>
<p>December 11, 1830. To this plea a demurrer was filed, and
</p>
<p>the question of the validity of the action <jf the General
</p>
<p>Assembly was thus raised. The real point in the case was
</p>
<p>this : the amendment had been ratified by a vote of two-
</p>
<p>thirds of a quorum of the House, but not two-thirds of all
</p>
<p>the members, which the judge contended was necessary.
</p>
<p>The case went to the Supreme Court, where it was held that
</p>
<p>two-thirds of a quorum was sufficient. This, of course,
</p>
<p>ousted Judge McBride from the office. The reader will find
</p>
<p>the case reported in 4th Missouri Reports, page 303.
</p>
<p>The same Legislature organized a new circuit, composed
</p>
<p>of the counties of Marion, Lewis, Clark, Monroe, and proba-
</p>
<p>bly Shelby, and Judge McBride was appointed to that cir-

<p>cuit, where he remained until he was appointed judge of the
</p>
<p>PRIEST LY //. M' BRIDE. 52/
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, in 1845. During part of his judicial service
</p>
<p>he resided in Paris, Monroe County.
</p>
<p>We met Judge McBride on several occasions, but had only
</p>
<p>a slight acquaintance with him. In politics he was an un-
</p>
<p>compromising Democrat, but took no active part in the
</p>
<p>political contests of the state while on the bench. In
</p>
<p>January, 1829, he was appointed by Governor Miller secre-
</p>
<p>tary of state, and resigned, in 1830, in order to accept the
</p>
<p>judgeship of the Second Judicial Circuit. These are the
</p>
<p>only public positions he held.
</p>
<p>He was in no sense a brilliant man, though he made a fair
</p>
<p>judge. It was alleged that he seldom gave a reason for his
</p>
<p>opinion. He must have taken his cue from the saying of a
</p>
<p>very eminent jurist, " That any judge could give a good
</p>
<p>opinion, but few could assign a good reason for it." He was
</p>
<p>an earnest man, of strong convictions, strong prejudices, and
</p>
<p>strong attachments, jovial in his disposition, and of un-
</p>
<p>doubted personal integrity. His published decisions will be

<p>Aaron h. Conrow.
</p>
<p>Like many others whose names appear in this vokmie, Mr.
</p>
<p>Conrow was, in the broadest sense of the term, a self-made
</p>
<p>man. His father was too poor to give his son even a com-
</p>
<p>mon-school education, but the son determined to have it,
</p>
<p>and through an energy and will that marked his career in
</p>
<p>life he succeeded in obtaining his wish. At the age of fifteen
</p>
<p>he taught what might be called an infant school, receiving as
</p>
<p>his pupils children between the ages of six and twelve, and at
</p>
<p>the end of the first year laid up enough money to pay his
</p>
<p>own tuition in an established academy. Thus, by becoming
</p>
<p>teacher and pujMl alternately, he acquired a good English
</p>
<p>education, embracing the higher branches of mathematics,
</p>
<p>and made some progress in the Latin and French languages.
</p>
<p>The example thus set by Mr. Conrow is most commendable,
</p>
<p>and should encourage those who are seeking an education
</p>
<p>under adverse circumstances.
</p>
<p>Mr. Conrow was born in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio,
</p>
<p>on June 9, 1824. While yet a child, his parents removed
</p>
<p>to Pekin, Illinois, and after a few years' residence there,
</p>
<p>came to Missouri and settled in Ray County. This was
</p>
<p>about 1840. Having selected the law for his profession,
</p>
<p>he entered the office of Philip L. Edwards, whom we
</p>
<p>recollect as a promising and rising lawyer of that county.
</p>
<p>After several years of close application and diligent study
</p>
<p>he was admitted to practice by Judge Napton, of the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court, and commenced his professional career in
</p>
<p>Richmond, the county-seat of Ray County.
</p>
<p>Mr. Conrow rose gradually in his profession, and obtained
</p>
<p>a large and valuable practice. This was no small compli-
</p>
<p>ment to a young lawyer, who had to contend with such men
</p>
<p>as General Doniphan, Judge Dunn, Governor King, Charles

</p>
<p>of Ray has always been strong, and to succeed there a law-
</p>
<p>yer must possess considerably more than an average ability,
</p>
<p>Mr. Conrow continued to practice in the Ray Circuit until
</p>
<p>the breaking-out of the Rebellion. During that time he was
</p>
<p>for four years circuit attorney. He also served for a short
</p>
<p>time as judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Ray
</p>
<p>Count}', b\' appointment of Governor Sterling Price, and
</p>
<p>was also at different times public administrator and county
</p>
<p>treasurer. In all these positions he displayed marked ability
</p>
<p>and the utmost fidelity.
</p>
<p>In 1848 he married Miss Mary Ann Quisenberry, a
</p>
<p>daughter of Colonel David H. Quisenberry, of Ray County,
</p>
<p>by whom he had six children, of which three sons and a
</p>
<p>daughter still survive him.
</p>
<p>In i860 Mr. Conrow was elected to the General Assem-
</p>
<p>bly as a State-Rights Democrat. Having strong slavery
</p>
<p>and Southern proclivities, he united his fortunes with the
</p>
<p>secessionists, and, leaving home and family, entered the
</p>
<p>Confederate army and attained the rank of colonel, when
</p>
<p>he was elected to represent his fellow-soldiers in the Con-
</p>
<p>federate Congress. Upon the adjournment of that Congress
</p>
<p>he returned to the army, and at the close of the war went
</p>
<p>into Mexico with General M. M. Parsons, and with Parsons,
</p>
<p>Standwitch, and others was there robbed and murdered by
</p>
<p>Mexican soldiery. For a full account of the massacre see
</p>
<p>our memoir of General Parsons.
</p>
<p>Like thousands of others who had the promise of a long
</p>
<p>and happy life, Mr. Conrow fell a victim to our unnatural
</p>
<p>and bloody civil war. That he was sincere in his convictions
</p>
<p>of duty we have no right to question, for he sacrificed for-
</p>
<p>tune, family, and life to advance a cause from which he
</p>
<p>could derive no possible benefit.
</p>
<p>Mr. Conrow had a legal mind, and with his habits of
</p>
<p>study and application might have secured a high rank in the

<p>the chief elements of orator}', the power to impress his

<p>Truth is the foundation of elocution ; in fact, it is the arch
</p>
<p>upon which the orator builds his structure, and when that

<p>weakens, the structure must fall. However much we may

<p>with his sincerity and honesty, we are disposed to give due

<p>high with his brethren of the order.
</p>
<p>LOUIS G. PICOT.
</p>
<p>We have no recollection of meeting this gentleman prior
</p>
<p>to 1852. He was then a practicing lawyer at the St. Louis
</p>
<p>bar, and had been for several years.
</p>
<p>He was a native of Richmond, Virginia, was of French
</p>
<p>descent, and born May 15, 1816. On his becoming twenty-
</p>
<p>one years of age he married Miss Margaret A. Roberts, of
</p>
<p>Baltimore. He received a good academic education, spoke
</p>
<p>French fluently, and made some progress in Latin. He
</p>
<p>studied law in Virginia, but, before completing his course,
</p>
<p>came in 1842 to St. Louis, bringing with him letters to Judge
</p>
<p>Bryan Mullanphy. Upon the invitation of the judge he
</p>
<p>entered his office as a student, and studied until 1844, when
</p>
<p>he was admitted to the bar. Judge Mullanphy had a large
</p>
<p>estate to manage, and employed Mr. Picot to assist him. This
</p>
<p>led to an introduction to Mrs. Ann Biddle, sister to Judge
</p>
<p>Mullanphy, and he took charge of her large estate also, and
</p>
<p>at her death became her executor. It was common in
</p>
<p>England, Spain, and other countries for able lawyers to
</p>
<p>devote their whole time to the management of large estates,
</p>
<p>and although it kept them from acquiring much renown in
</p>
<p>their profession, they found it very remunerative. So it was
</p>
<p>with Mr. Picot, for although he was far above the average
</p>
<p>lawyer, he obtained no distinction, but it enabled him to
</p>
<p>accumulate a handsome estate. He was a most devoted
</p>
<p>student, and made himself very familiar with our old French
</p>
<p>and Spanish titles, and became, in fact, an excellent land
</p>
<p>lawyer.
</p>
<p>He was a fine-looking man of medium size, with dark hair
</p>
<p>and dark and sparkling eyes, and pleasant and agreeable
</p>
<p>manner. We often met him in the recorder's office dili-
</p>
<p>gently searching the records, for in those days we had but

<p>few reliable agencies for the investigation of titles.
</p>
<p>532 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>We once listened to a long and able argument of his
</p>
<p>before a jury in a contest between a Spanish grant and a
</p>
<p>New Madrid location. He occupied a part of two days, and
</p>
<p>was constantly eating oranges to keep his voice from becom-
</p>
<p>ing hoarse. In a jocular way we suggested to him that he_
</p>
<p>ought to divide his oranges with the jury, otherwise they
</p>
<p>might think him selfish. We don't vouch for the fact, but
</p>
<p>were told that in concluding his argument, the next morning,
</p>
<p>he had a dozen on the table, and was feasting the jury with
</p>
<p>that delicious fruit. We also learned that it was an invaria-
</p>
<p>ble practice with him. He was a fluent, argumentative
</p>
<p>speaker, but at times rather tedious and long-winded.
</p>
<p>He lived at Carondelet, and built a residence on the top
</p>
<p>of a high hill, constructing over it an immense tower, which
</p>
<p>went by the name of " Picot's Folly." In grading the
</p>
<p>streets he was left high and dry, with great difficulty of
</p>
<p>egress and ingress.
</p>
<p>He was esteemed an honorable and upright man. He
</p>
<p>died at home, August 24, 1870, leaving a widow and six
</p>
<p>children. His wife is still living.
</p>
<p>At a bar-meeting held immediately after his death a hand-
</p>
<p>some tribute was paid to his memory. The various courts.
</p>
<p>Federal and state, took action in reference to his death, and
</p>
<p>caused the resolutions of the bar-meeting to be spread upon
</p>
<p>their records. Upon the occasion of the meeting referred

<p>to. Colonel Louis V. Bogy, late United States senator, spoke
</p>
<p>of Mr. Picot in the most eulogistic terms as a lawyer of
</p>
<p>ability and great integrity. Said Colonel Bogy :
</p>
<p>" He was not brilliant, and did not pretend to great attainments ; but he was
</p>
<p>a man of peculiar mind, and possessed a strong, retentive memory. As a land
</p>
<p>lawyer he had no superior. I doubt if he had his equnl, though others won
</p>
<p>greater distinction. I doubt whether a lawyer understood the law applicable

<p>to our land titles better than Mr. Picot."
</p>
<p>ROBERT T. PREWITT.
</p>
<p>In 1862, while holding a term of the Supreme Court in
</p>
<p>Jefferson City, we became acquainted with Mr. Prewitt, who
</p>
<p>was then a lawyer in full practice, residing in Fayette, How-
</p>
<p>ard County. He attended the terms of the court at Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son City regularly, and delivered several oral arguments
</p>
<p>which made a favorable impression upon us, both as to his
</p>
<p>ability as a lawyer and his pleasant and gentlemanly
</p>
<p>demeanor.
</p>
<p>He was the son of Rev. Joel Prewitt, a Christian or Camp-
</p>
<p>bellite minister, of Kentucky, and was born in Bourbon
</p>
<p>County, in that state, August i, 1818. His father brought
</p>
<p>his family to Missouri about 1824, and settled on a farm
</p>
<p>within a few miles of Fayette. After receiving a good aca-
</p>
<p>demic education he commenced the study of the law, in
</p>
<p>1840, with Abiel Leonard, one of the most eminent lawyers
</p>
<p>in the Western country. After remaining with Mr. Leonard
</p>
<p>about two years he went to Kentucky, and completed his
</p>
<p>studies with his uncle, Judge John Trimble, of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of that state, a noted jurist. He then returned to
</p>
<p>Missouri, took a desk in the office of General John Wilson,
</p>
<p>at Fayette, and entered upon tlie practice. His opportu-
</p>
<p>nities for a legal education could not have been better, and
</p>
<p>he improved them well, for he became thoroughly grounded
</p>
<p>in the principles of the law. He soon obtained a reasonable
</p>
<p>share of business, which gradually increased through life.
</p>
<p>In 1852 he was appointed circuit attorney for the Second
</p>
<p>Judicial District, and discharged the duties of the office with
</p>
<p>marked ability until the latter part of 1856. He necessarily
</p>
<p>had to encounter some of the ablest lawyers of the state, for
</p>
<p>his circuit embraced some of the oldest and wealthiest
</p>
<p>counties, such as Howard, Boone, and Callaway. We are

</p>
<p>ber of the Constitutional Convention called in 1861 to deter-
</p>
<p>mine upon the relations of the state towards the Federal
</p>
<p>government. The Convention was organized in 1861, and
</p>
<p>delegates were elected from the senatorial districts. His
</p>
<p>district comprised the counties of Howard, Randolph, and
</p>
<p>Chariton, and was represented in part by General Sterling
</p>
<p>Price. In 1863 General Price was expelled for disloyalty,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Prewitt elected in his place, and took his seat on June
</p>
<p>17th. The labors of the Convention were gradually drawing
</p>
<p>to a close, so that he had but little opportunity of making
</p>
<p>reputation as a forensic debater. One of the main questions
</p>
<p>then to be decided was in reference to the emancipation of
</p>
<p>the slaves. Mr. Prewitt took strong ground in favor of the
</p>
<p>Union, but was very conservative in his course, and, while he
</p>
<p>admitted that slavery was doomed, he thought that sound
</p>
<p>policy dictated that the loyal slaveholders should to some
</p>
<p>extent be compensated for the loss of their slaves. This
</p>
<p>policy was strongly advocated by Mr. Lincoln in the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of his administration. There were more slaves
</p>
<p>in Mr. Prewitt's district than any other, and the loss of prop-
</p>
<p>erty by abolition or emancipation would necessarily fall
</p>
<p>heavily upon his constituents. It was natural, therefore, that
</p>
<p>he should advocate some measure for the protection of the
</p>
<p>loyal slaveholder. That the reader may better understand
</p>
<p>the views of Mr. Prewitt on this subject we give the follow-
</p>
<p>ing extract from one of his speeches in the Convention:
</p>
<p>" We are told that this slave property must be taken away from us without
</p>
<p>compensation, notwithstanding that the Constitution guarantees that property
</p>
<p>to us, or its equivalent. Was it not in virtue of that Constitution, and in full
</p>
<p>reliance on it, that the people were invited to settle in this state? And are we
</p>
<p>now to be told that this contract is to be canceled and no compensation made ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen tell us to be patriotic; we desire to be so. Gentlemen tell us to
</p>
<p>stand by the flag of the country, and to put everything out of the way that pre-
</p>
<p>vents its advance. We desire to do so; we mean to do so. and to stand by the

</p>
<p>Union and the government of the United States against all foes, come from
</p>
<p>wherever they may. But are gentlemen who are so generous and profuse in
</p>
<p>their demands upon us prepared to make equal sacrifices ? Are gentlemen who
</p>
<p>ask my constituents to give up perhaps an only slave, quite ready to display
</p>
<p>equal patriotism ? Can it be that these glowing apjjcals to our patriotism come
</p>
<p>from gentlemen who neither offer nor expect to make any sacrifices ? There are.

<p>perhaps, ioo,cxK> slaves in Missouri. Gentlemen require that those slaves
</p>
<p>should be given up by their owners. Some of these owners may be disloyal ; if
</p>
<p>so, their property is confiscated by the laws of the United States ; but my ap-
</p>
<p>peal is in behalf of the loyal slaveholders of Missouri. Sir, we are embarked
</p>
<p>in a great undertaking; but the loyal men of Missouri, shoulder to shoulder,
</p>
<p>are marching steadily forward; the state rebellion is crushed, the government
</p>
<p>and the Union will be maintained, and peace will be again restored to our
</p>
<p>distracted land."
</p>
<p>We regret that space will not permit us to publish more
</p>
<p>of this speech, but the reader will find it in full in the pub-
</p>
<p>lished proceedings of the Convention for 1863.
</p>
<p>Mr. Prewitt was a man of noble impulses and of the highest
</p>
<p>integrity, and was much beloved by all who knew him. He
</p>
<p>was a fine-looking man, and his genial disposition and happy
</p>
<p>temperament brought him a large number of devoted and
</p>
<p>attached friends. He was a fluent and impressive speaker,
</p>
<p>but not an orator. His style of declamation was more con-
</p>
<p>versational than otherwise. He was, moreover, a close stu-
</p>
<p>dent, and never neglected the interests of his client.
</p>
<p>In 1844 he married Martha A. Williams, daughter of F.
</p>

<p>those who attended court in old Franklin. Shortly after
</p>
<p>going to Montgomery County he married a Miss Talbot, who
</p>
<p>belonged to an old and influential family, some of whom are
</p>
<p>still living in that section of the state.
</p>
<p>Judge McGirk was fond of agriculture, and built himself
</p>
<p>a beautiful residence on or near Lautre Island, one of the
</p>
<p>islands of the Missouri River, and nearly opposite the present
</p>
<p>town of Hermann. We spent a night with him there, about
</p>
<p>1838, and he entertained us with true, genuine hospitality.
</p>
<p>He was a man of medium size, about five feet ten, and
</p>
<p>somewhat inclined to corpulency. He was not favored with
</p>
<p>a classical education, and his reading, outside of the law, was
</p>
<p>not extensive. There was no brilliancy about him, but he
</p>
<p>had good, practical sense, with a naturally strong and vigor-
</p>
<p>ous intellect, and a fine, retentive memory, which enabled
</p>
<p>him to gather a large amount of legal learning. He was not
</p>
<p>at the bar long enough to build up a reputation as a practi-
</p>
<p>tioner. When he had his friends about him he was disposed
</p>
<p>to be humorous, but among strangers was very reticent.
</p>
<p>Judge McGirk remained on the bench until 1841, and was,
</p>
<p>during most of his judicial services, presiding justice. As a
</p>
<p>jurist he grew rapidly in reputation and public favor, and was

<p>always popular with the bar. His opinions will be found in

<p>MATH I AS M'GIRK. 537
</p>
<p>the first six volumes of our Reports, and will compare favor-
</p>
<p>ably with those of any other judge of his time.
</p>
<p>His language was strong, concise, vigorous, and terse, and
</p>
<p>remarkably free from doubt and ambiguity. There was
</p>
<p>nothing stiff or strained in his diction, nor did it show any in-
</p>
<p>dication of having been studied or measured. He was a
</p>
<p>fluent conversationalist, and wrote as he spoke. In examin-
</p>
<p>ing his published opinions the reader will look in vain for
</p>
<p>anything like studied phraseology or verbiage. His style is
</p>
<p>easy, flowing, and natural, and in perfect harmony with his
</p>
<p>thoughts and reflections.
</p>
<p>It has been stated, bv those who had the means of know-
</p>
<p>ing, that he seldom rewrote an opinion, nor did his original
</p>
<p>draft contain many changes or alterations.
</p>
<p>In politics he was an Old-Line Whig, very decided in his
</p>
<p>views, and probably would have been very active but for the
</p>
<p>restraint imposed by his official position. The only public
</p>
<p>positions he held were those of judge of the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>and member of our Territorial Legislature. He must have
</p>
<p>come to the state as early as 1814, for in 18 16 he was the
</p>
<p>author of the bill to introduce the common law into Missouri,
</p>
<p>and presented it as a member of the Legislature. It passed
</p>
<p>as he framed it, and many other important statutes were in-
</p>
<p>troduced and passed of which he was the author.
</p>
<p>Judge McGirk never had any children, but his widow sur-
</p>
<p>vived him many years.
</p>
<p>Among the able men of our state who studied law under
</p>
<p>him is the Hon. John D. S. Dryden, late judge of our
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, who speaks in the highest terms of Judge

<p>McGirk's probity and judicial learning.
</p>
<p>Robert W. Wells.
</p>
<p>We are conscious that any sketch of the early Hfe and ca-
</p>
<p>reer of this able jurist and long-tried public servant which
</p>
<p>may be prepared from the scanty material on hand must
</p>
<p>necessarily be very imperfect. We first saw him at Jefferson
</p>
<p>City in the winter of 1836-7, while on a visit to the capital
</p>
<p>to obtain from the Supreme Court admission to the bar.
</p>
<p>Although never on intimate terms with Judge Wells, we met
</p>
<p>him frequently from that time till his death.
</p>
<p>He was a son of Richard Wells, of Winchester, Virginia,
</p>
<p>and was born there in 1 795. The impression that his educa-
</p>
<p>tion was classical and thorough seems to have been generally
</p>
<p>entertained, but the contrary is true, for the only school he
</p>
<p>ever attended was an ordinary common-field school, such as
</p>
<p>prevailed at that early day throughout the Old Dominion.
</p>
<p>None but wealthy planters and gentlemen of fortune were
</p>
<p>able to send their sons to a college, and as Richard Wells
</p>
<p>did not fall within either of these classes, he was forced, from
</p>
<p>necessity, to deny his son the benefits of a liberal education.
</p>
<p>But he instilled in his young mind the necessity of self-exer-
</p>
<p>tion, and encouraged him by pointing to the brilliant career of
</p>
<p>many self-made men who had attained the highest distinction
</p>
<p>in the various pursuits of life with no adventitious circum-
</p>
<p>stances to aid them. Young Wells was fond of his books,
</p>
<p>being a constant reader, and, with the assistance of such
</p>
<p>translations of ancient authors as fell in his way, he acquired
</p>
<p>a fair knowledge of the classics. He must have studied
</p>
<p>Latin under some private tutor  most probably about the
</p>
<p>time he was preparing himself for admission to the bar  for
</p>
<p>in after years we noticed in his large library many Latin works
</p>
<p>that gave evidence of much use, with marginal notes and
</p>
<p>references in his own handwriting.

</p>
<p>When he reached his nineteenth or twentieth year he en-
</p>
<p>ROBERT IV. WELLS. 539
</p>
<p>tered upon the study of the law with Judge Vinton, of Ma-
</p>
<p>rietta, Ohio, and nearly completed his studies with that
</p>
<p>gentleman. He then came to Missouri, and commenced his
</p>
<p>professional life at St. Charles. This was during our terri-
</p>
<p>torial government, and was probably as early as 1818 or 18 19,
</p>
<p>if not before that time, for upon the admission of the state
</p>
<p>into the Union he had acquired considerable practice, and
</p>
<p>was appointed prosecuting attorney in the St. Charles Cir-
</p>
<p>cuit, embracing St. Charles, Lincoln, Pike, Ralls, and other
</p>
<p>counties. Judge Rufus Pettibone was the judge of the cir-
</p>
<p>cuit, and the first appointed under the state government.
</p>
<p>The political trouble growing out of the admission of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri formed one of the most exciting and important epochs
</p>
<p>in our nation's history, and came very near precipitating us
</p>
<p>in a bloody revolution. Some of the strongest articles which
</p>
<p>appeared upon that subject in the Missouri press were attrib-
</p>
<p>uted to the pen of Mr. Wells. He was certainly a writer
</p>
<p>of more than ordinary ability. We are unable to state how
</p>
<p>long he filled the office of circuit attorney, but most probably
</p>
<p>until about the time he was appointed attorney-general of
</p>
<p>the state, which was January 21, 1826. This responsible and
</p>
<p>highly honorable office, which had been previously filled by
</p>
<p>Edward Bates and Rufus Easton, was held by Mr. Wells for
</p>
<p>a period of ten years. It was no sinecure, for the attorney-
</p>
<p>general was, ex officio, reporter of the decisions of the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court, prosecuting attorney for the Cole Circuit, super-
</p>
<p>intendent of common schools, one of the Advisory Board of
</p>
<p>the Penitentiary, and legal adviser of the Legislature, gover-
</p>
<p>nor, and all other state officers. The long period for which
</p>
<p>his services were retained is the best evidence of his diligent
</p>
<p>and faithful discharge of the complicated and laborious duties
</p>
<p>of the office.
</p>
<p>Upon retiring from the office of attorney-general he was
</p>
<p>appointed judge of the United States District Court for the

<p>District of Missouri, and continued in this position until his
</p>
<p>death, which occurred April 2, 1865, at Bowling Green,
</p>
<p>in Kentucky, while on a visit to his married daughter. He
</p>
<p>had nearly reached his seventieth year.
</p>
<p>540 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>Judge Wells was twice married  the first time, in 1832, to a
</p>
<p>daughter of Major Elias Barcroft, of St. Louis County. Ma-
</p>
<p>jor Barcroft was state auditor from 1823 to 1833. By this
</p>
<p>marriage he had a son and two daughters. A few years
</p>
<p>after the death of his first wife, in June, 1840, he married Miss
</p>
<p>Covington, of Kentucky, a very estimable lady, who still sur-
</p>
<p>vives him. By this marriage he had two daughters. One of
</p>
<p>his daughters by his first marriage married General Monroe
</p>
<p>Parsons, who was waylaid and murdered by Mexican out-
</p>
<p>laws.
</p>
<p>Though a slaveholder during most of his life, Judge Wells
</p>
<p>became satisfied that the institution was a stumbling-block
</p>
<p>in the progress of his state, and at a very early time advo-
</p>
<p>cated a gradual system of emancipation. With him it was a
</p>
<p>question of interest, for he had no prejudices to encounter in
</p>
<p>opposition to slavery. He saw no hope for the development
</p>
<p>of our agricultural and mineral resources except through
</p>
<p>free labor and capital, neither of which would encounter
</p>
<p>slave labor. With him, therefore, it was a question of dollars
</p>
<p>and cents, of local interest, and he was ready to adopt any
</p>
<p>policy^ which in his judgment would invite immigration,
</p>
<p>labor, and capital.
</p>
<p>We visited Jefferson City at the openmg of the Legislature
</p>
<p>in i860, and found that body so strongly imbued with the
</p>
<p>spirit of secession that it was actually dangerous to make
</p>
<p>open opposition to it. A few of the Union men met in pri-
</p>
<p>vate consultation, and to agree upon some plan of resistance
</p>
<p>to the treasonable designs of Governor Jackson and his fol-
</p>
<p>lowers. In this little patriotic assemblage we found Judge
</p>
<p>Wells, ready to cooperate with the friends of the government,
</p>
<p>and his counsel and advice upon that occasion proved most
</p>
<p>valuable and serviceable. We saw but little of him after-
</p>
<p>wards, but up to the last he proved a most devoted friend to
</p>
<p>the Union.

</p>
<p>In 1845 a State Convention was called to revise the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, and Judge Wells was elected a delegate from the
</p>
<p>Cole Senatorial District, and upon the assembling of the
</p>
<p>Convention was selected as its presiding ofificer. During
</p>
<p>ROBERT W. WELLS. 54 1
</p>
<p>the session he made several speeches evincing much knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of constitutional law. He was a close, logical reasoner,
</p>
<p>and always secured the full attention of his hearers, but he
</p>
<p>had but few of the elements of oratory. His voice was sharp,
</p>
<p>shrill, and effeminate, and he was anything but graceful in his
</p>
<p>gesture or delivery. He never spoke without ample prepa-
</p>
<p>ration, and was happy and effective in his illustrations.
</p>
<p>A constitution was framed, and submitted to a vote of the
</p>
<p>people, but by reason of one or two unfortunate provisions
</p>
<p>became obnoxious, and was rejected at the polls.
</p>
<p>Judge Wells was a consistent Democrat through life, and
</p>
<p>though not a man who had many warm personal friends, was
</p>
<p>greatly admired for his general learning and legal erudition.
</p>
<p>He intended, after completing his visit to his daughter in
</p>
<p>Kentucky, to spend a few months in the East to recruit his
</p>
<p>health, but he never left her house alive.
</p>
<p>As soon as his death was telegraphed to St. Louis a bar-
</p>
<p>meeting was held in the city, and appropriate resolutions
</p>
<p>adopted eulogistic of his character as a man and a jurist.
</p>
<p>These resolutions were spread upon the records of the Fed-
</p>
<p>eral and state courts held in St. Louis. A committee was
</p>
<p>also appointed to receive his remains at the depot on the op-
</p>
<p>posite side of the river, and to escort them through St. Louis
</p>
<p>on their way to Jefferson City. The bar of Cole County
</p>
<p>also assembled and paid a suitable tribute to his memory.
</p>
<p>The Hon. Thomas T. Gantt presided over the St. Louis meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and his letter to Mrs. Wells, inclosing the proceedings,
</p>
<p>furnishes not only a true exhibit of Judge Wells' character
</p>
<p>as a jurist, but is one of the most beautiful tributes to the
</p>
<p>memory of a distinguished man that has ever fallen under
</p>
<p>our observation, and we cannot refrain from giving it to the
</p>
<p>public :

<p>^'Jefferson City, Mo.
</p>
<p>" My Dear Madam : The melancholy duty of transmitting to you a copy of
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the bar of St. Louis, on the occasion of the death of Judge
</p>
<p>Wells, has been assigned to me.
</p>
<p>" In performing it I cannot refrain from adding to what has been said by my
</p>
<p>542 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>professional brethren an cxi^ression of the feelintjs to which the event gave rise
</p>
<p>in my mind.
</p>
<p>" For more tlian twenty-five years I had known Judge Wells. For more
</p>
<p>than twenty years I had been honored by his friendship. During all that
</p>
<p>time he laid me under continual obligations l)y the courtesy of his demeanor
</p>
<p>and the wisdom of his counsel. Often in circumstances of perplexity I have
</p>
<p>been led by the light of his understanding to a clear view of what, a few hours
</p>
<p>previous, seemed hopelessly obscure. He illustrated and adorned the judg-
</p>
<p>ment-scat. He attracted respect to the administration of the law, and, by the
</p>
<p>conspicuous impartiality and even-handedness of his course, conciliated the
</p>
<p>esteem of those even against whom the principles of jurisprudence obliged him
</p>
<p>to decide. He has done more than any judge, living or dead, for the elucidation
</p>
<p>and correct exposition of the United States statutes on which land titles in Mis-
</p>
<p>souri depend. He has left to those to whom his name descends the priceless
</p>
<p>inheritance of the memory of the useful, unstained citizen, the kind and public-
</p>
<p>spirited member of society, the firm and zealous patriot, and the learned, up-
</p>
<p>right, indefatigable, and most meritorious judicial magistrate.
</p>
<p>" I know how idle and vain these words seem to you in the hour of your be-
</p>
<p>rea\ement, but I could not say less without violence to the emotions of respect
</p>
<p>and regard with which I have been so long imbued towards your deceased hus-
</p>
<p>band. When such a man falls, it is no ordinary calamity.
</p>
<p>'The state is impoverished by his death  the bench has lost its chief orna-
</p>
<p>ment; and, while the blow falls on his family with peculiar and crushing se-
</p>
<p>verity, a large circle of attached friends, from a respectful distance, offer to his
</p>
<p>devoted household their condolence and sympathy.
</p>
<p>" I have the honor to l)e, with the highest respect,
</p>
<p> Your most oljedient servant and friend,
</p>
<p>"Thomas T. Gantt."
</p>
<p>Judge Wells was never favorably impressed with the
</p>
<p>utility of "trial by jury," e.xcept in criminal cases, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing it was sustained by immemorial usage. He re-
</p>
<p>garded the system as it prevailed in the United States better
</p>
<p>calculated to defeat than attain the ends of justice. He

</p>
<p>experience in the analyzation of testimony and in its ap-
</p>
<p>plication to the fact sought to be established, was more
</p>
<p>likely to elicit the truth than a jury of twelve men selected
</p>
<p>from all classes of the community, some of whom are un-
</p>
<p>lettered, while others are readily moved by prejudice or
</p>
<p>popular commoticMi.
</p>
<p>The author avails himself of this occasion to place upon
</p>
<p>record his own views upon this subject, predicated upon an
</p>
<p>experience of forty years at the bar. " Trial by jury " existed
</p>
<p>ROBERT W. WELLS. 543
</p>
<p>at a very early period in England, and we borrowed it from
</p>
<p>the mother country. Strange to say, at one period it be-
</p>
<p>came very unpopular by reason of many abuses to which it
</p>
<p>was then subject, and these led to the organization of the
</p>
<p>celebrated "Court of Star Chamber," about A. D. 1500.
</p>
<p>The preamble of the act creating this memorable tribunal
</p>
<p>refers to combinations which had been formed for the ob-
</p>
<p>struction of justice ; cites the partiality of sheriffs in making
</p>
<p>up their panels, the taking of money by jurors, and the riots
</p>
<p>and unlawful assemblages which served to defeat the fair
</p>
<p>administration of justice. The lord chancellor, the treas-
</p>
<p>urer, the keeper of the privy seal, with a bishop and tem-
</p>
<p>poral lord of the council, and the chief justices of the King's
</p>
<p>Bench and Common Pleas, constituted the court. It had no
</p>
<p>power over the life of the subject, but inflicted the most
</p>
<p>cruel and barbarous punishments.
</p>
<p>It is said by Mr. Emory Washburn, in an able article
</p>
<p>which appeared in the October number, 1877, of the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can Latv Review, from which we have drawn some valuable
</p>
<p>information respecting the origin of this court, that it was
</p>
<p>undoubtedly created for salutary purposes. But whatever
</p>
<p>evils may have existed in the jury system at that early
</p>
<p>period of time, the Court of Star Chamber failed to remove
</p>
<p>them, and the court itself became an engine of oppression.
</p>
<p>At the present day the jury system in England is well
</p>
<p>guarded by law, and is unquestionably one of the greatest
</p>
<p>safeguards of the British subject.
</p>
<p>In the United States it has always been popular, but it is
</p>
<p>evident to every one whose attention has been called to the
</p>
<p>subject that for the last quarter of a century it has gradu-
</p>
<p>ally declined in public estimation. This is not the fault of
</p>
<p>the system, but grows out of the want of proper legislation
</p>
<p>to guard against its abuses.
</p>
<p>It is patent to those who have been in the habit of attend-

</p>
<p>ing the courts of St. Louis that at least five out of seven of
</p>
<p>the juries there impaneled are totally unfit for jury service.
</p>
<p>It not unfrequently occurs that two-thirds of a panel do not
</p>
<p>understand the English language. It is also true that men
</p>
<p>544 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>are frequently smuggled on a jury for the sole purpose of
</p>
<p>preventing a verdict; particularly is this the case in the
</p>
<p>Criminal Court. If the accused has money and influential
</p>
<p>friends, or either, a conviction is next to an impossibility.
</p>
<p>Another objection lies in the fact that such a body of
</p>
<p>men, with minds differently constituted and habits greatly
</p>
<p>diversified, are too liable to disagree, and these disagree-
</p>
<p>ments necessarily entail additional costs and expenses upon
</p>
<p>parties litigant. This objection has much weight.
</p>
<p>For several years past the press throughout the country,
</p>
<p>and particularly in St. Louis, has freely criticised our jury
</p>
<p>system, and these criticisms have led to no little legislation.
</p>
<p>In St. Louis we have a jury law applicable to St. Louis
</p>
<p>alone, and yet no visible change can be seen in the char-
</p>
<p>acter of our juries. Unless some plan can be devised to
</p>
<p>remedy the evils we have suggested, "trial by jury" will
</p>
<p>eventually become a mere mockery. We do not pretend to
</p>
<p>suggest the remedy, but the law should at least be so modi-
</p>
<p>fied as to limit the number and class of cases upon which a
</p>
<p>jury can pass. We have been gradually floating into the
</p>
<p>habit of submitting to juries issues of fact arising in chan-
</p>
<p>cery suits. This is a most pernicious practice, and unless
</p>
<p>checked by suitable legislation will lead to the overthrow of
</p>
<p>chancery jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>To avoid disagreements in civil cases a given number (nine
</p>
<p>has most frequently been suggested) should be permitted to
</p>
<p>find a verdict.
</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that some public benefactor, equal to
</p>
<p>the emergency, may yet be able to suggest a plan which
</p>
<p>will restore this ancient rite to public confidence. It has
</p>
<p>too long prevailed, and is too deeply imbedded in the hearts

</p>
<p>Those of the early inhabitants of Marion, Shelby, and La-
</p>
<p>fayette Counties, in this state, who still survive must retain
</p>
<p>a pleasant recollection of the gentleman whose name is
</p>
<p>above, for he was not only one of those genial spirits who
</p>
<p>never fail to secure many warm and attached friends, but
</p>
<p>was a man of learning and promise, and bade fair to make a
</p>
<p>high reputation in his profession. Death, however, " who
</p>
<p>loves a shining mark," cut him down in the morning of life,
</p>
<p>and at a time when fortune was responding to every wish of
</p>
<p>his heart.
</p>
<p>He was a son of Dr. Abel Slayback, of Cincinnati, and
</p>
<p>was born in that city in 1817. When but fifteen years of
</p>
<p>age he was sent to Marion College, in Missouri, an institu-
</p>
<p>tion of learning under the direction and control of the Pres-
</p>
<p>byterian denomination, and conducted on the manual-labor
</p>
<p>plan. It was then regarded as the best college in the state,
</p>
<p>for we had no state university or educational institution
</p>
<p>under the endowment of the state, or maintained by state
</p>
<p>aid. Young Slayback pursued his studies here with much
</p>
<p>diligence, and during his vacations entered upon a course of
</p>
<p>reading, under the direction of his father, which it was sup-
</p>
<p>posed would be advantageous to him when he commenced
</p>
<p>the study of the law, for at an early period he had fixed
</p>
<p>upon the legal profession as best suited to his order of
</p>
<p>mind and personal inclinations. In this he was encouraged
</p>
<p>by his father, who discerned in the son mental traits that in
</p>
<p>his judgment fitted him for a professional life.
</p>
<p>In June, 1838, he was admitted to the bar by Judge
</p>
<p>McGirk, of the Supreme Court. As stated elsewhere in
</p>
<p>this work, an application for a law-license at that time had
</p>
<p>to be made directly to the Supreme Court, or one of the
</p>
<p>judges thereof, in vacation, and the examination was strict

</p>
<p>and searching. Judge McGirk congratulated him upon the
</p>
<p>good examination he had passed, and gave him some good
</p>
<p>advice with reference to his future course, which the young
</p>
<p>claimant for legal honors fully appreciated.
</p>
<p>In July, 1837, he married Miss Anna M. Minter, eldest
</p>
<p>daughter of I. A. Minter, Esq., of Philadelphia, and opened
</p>
<p>a law-office in Shelbyville, the county-seat of Shelby County.
</p>
<p>He soon obtained a fair amount of business, but to a young
</p>
<p>practitioner, without fortune, and solely dependent upon his
</p>
<p>own exertions, it was necessarily a life of toil and privation ;
</p>
<p>but he was greatly encouraged by the reception he received
</p>
<p>from the people, and by the womanly devotion of his good
</p>
<p>wife, who ev^er made his home happy and cheerful. He
</p>
<p>practiced in Shelby, Knox, Lewis, Marion, and Audrain
</p>
<p>Counties, and on special occasions attended courts in other
</p>
<p>counties.
</p>
<p>In May, 1847, he concluded to change his residence, and
</p>
<p>moved to Lexington, in Lafayette County. Lexington was
</p>
<p>growing rapidly in population and wealth, and not only
</p>
<p>afforded a larger field in which to prosecute his profession,
</p>
<p>but presented greater facilities for educating his children.
</p>
<p>His great probity of character, close application to business,
</p>
<p>and fine oratorical powers readily attracted the attention of
</p>
<p>the people of Lafayette, and he was soon retained in many
</p>
<p>prominent cases pending in the courts of that circuit.
</p>
<p>Though a public-spirited man, he took but little interest in
</p>
<p>politics, and never would permit his name to be used for a
</p>
<p>public office. He was a very ardent Mason, and labored
</p>
<p>hard to secure the location of the Masonic College at Lex-
</p>
<p>ington, and in 1848 delivered the address at the laying of
</p>
<p>the corner-stone of that institution.
</p>
<p>He died August 19, 1848, very suddenly, in his thirty-first
</p>
<p>year, leaving a widow and five children, the youngest of
</p>
<p>whom survived him but a short time. The three sons,

<p>Alonzo W., Charles E., and Preston T., are now residents of

<p>St. Louis, the former being well known as an able and promi-
</p>
<p>nent member of the St. Louis bar.
</p>
<p>The subject of our sketch did not live long enough to ob-
</p>
<p>ALEXANDER L. SLAY BACK. 547
</p>
<p>tain that distinction in his profession which his talents, prac-
</p>
<p>tical Christian habits, and great personal integrity entitled
</p>
<p>him to, and no doubt would have secured to him. We have
</p>
<p>made no reference to his cheerful and genial disposition,
</p>
<p>which made him a favorite, particularly with his co-laborers
</p>
<p>at the bar. He was the life of every company in which
</p>
<p>he entered ; had a copious fund of good humor, and was
</p>
<p>never wanting in a good anecdote to amuse others. He
</p>
<p>was an exceedingly fluent and ready speaker, and his dis-
</p>
<p>courses abounded in pathos and dignified wit, and his
</p>
<p>manner was wholly free from the appearance of labored
</p>
<p>preparation. His unexpected death was not only a terrible
</p>
<p>blow to his confiding family, but proved a serious loss to a
</p>
<p>profession which has not many such men to spare.
</p>
<p>Mr. Slayback was a practical and true Christian, having
</p>
<p>united with the Presbyterian Church when only sixteen years
</p>
<p>of age, and his life furnishes a contradiction to the com-
</p>
<p>monly-received opinion that a successful lawyer cannot be a
</p>
<p>sincere Christian. Upon this subject we have made some
</p>
<p>comments in our life of Josiah Spalding, and since writing
</p>
<p>that sketch have fallen upon the words of that great lexicog-
</p>
<p>rapher, essayist, and critic, Dr. Samuel Johnson. Johnson
</p>
<p>studied law, though he never practiced, and had a good con-
</p>
<p>ception of the duties of an attorney. His biographer,
</p>
<p>Boswell, credits him with saying: "A lawyer is not to tell
</p>
<p>what he knows to be a lie ; he is not to produce what he
</p>
<p>knows to be a false deed ; but he is not to usurp the province
</p>
<p>of the jury and of the judge, and determine what shall be
</p>
<p>the effect of evidence, what shall be the result of evidence,
</p>
<p>what shall be the result of legal argument. A lawyer is to
</p>
<p>do for his client all that his client might fairly do for himself,
</p>
<p>if he could. If, by a superiority of attention, of knowledge,
</p>
<p>of skill, and a better method of communication, he has the
</p>
<p>advantage of his adversary, it is an advantage to which he

</p>
<p>is entitled. There must always be some advantage, on one
</p>
<p>side or the other ; and it is better that advantage should be
</p>
<p>had by talents than by chance. If lawyers were to under-
</p>
<p>take no causes till they were sure they were just, a man
</p>
<p>54'^ BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOUKL
</p>
<p>might be precluded altogether from a trial of his claim,
</p>
<p>though were it judicially examined it might be found a very
</p>
<p>just claim." These views of Dr. Johnson cannot, in our
</p>
<p>judgment, be successfully controverted. An experience of
</p>
<p>forty years at the bar, in which we have defended persons
</p>
<p>charged with crime from the lowest to the highest degree,
</p>
<p>has satisfied us that when a lawyer is called upon to defend
</p>
<p>an alleged criminal, the chief duty incumbent upon him is
</p>
<p>to see that his client has a fair trial; that he is not preju-
</p>
<p>diced by false testimony or false clamor ; that he receives the
</p>
<p>full benefit of every presumption of the law that may be in
</p>
<p>his favor, and of all facts and circumstances that may tend to
</p>
<p>mitigate his offense. The lawyer is not to be theorizing upon
</p>
<p>the probabilities of guilt, but, in the absence of any positive
</p>
<p>knowledge, is to presume, what the law presumes, that his
</p>
<p>client is innocent until the contrary is proved. He is to
</p>
<p>bear in mind that the jury is to pass upon the cjuestion of
</p>
<p>guilt or innocence, under such instructions as to the law
</p>
<p>as the court may give. When he has done this he has dis-
</p>
<p>charged his duty. A contrary course would deprive his
</p>
<p>client of the benefit of those safeguards which the law has
</p>
<p>thrown around him for his protection, and which are wisely
</p>
<p>provided to elicit the truth.
</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Slayback in his youth exhibited man}'
</p>
<p>of those traits of character for which he became noted in
</p>
<p>manhood It was Milton who said,
</p>
<p>" The childhood shows the man
</p>
<p>As morning shows the day."
</p>
<p>He was slender in person, and about six feet four inches in
</p>
<p>height, and had light brown hair. He was fond of mtisic,

<p>JOHN C. RICHARDSON.
</p>
<p>No man living can sketch the hfe of this popular and dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished lawyer and do his memory justice. It is not the
</p>
<p>purpose or office of eulogy to magnify the virtues of the
</p>
<p>dead, but to exhibit those really possessed as examples
</p>
<p>worthy of imitation, and to keep alive in our memory the
</p>
<p>good deeds performed through life. It furnishes a stimu-
</p>
<p>lus to the rising generation, and offers an incentive to noble
</p>
<p>action. If called upon to furnish a model of a good lawyer,
</p>
<p>a good citizen, and one who most deservedly ranked as one
</p>
<p>of God's noblemen, we should instinctively name John C.
</p>
<p>Richardson. We knew him well  we knew him intimately;
</p>
<p>we loved him, for it was impossible to know him and not love
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>He was born, raised, and educated in Kentucky, and
</p>
<p>received his legal education at Transylvania University. We
</p>
<p>have not the date of his birth, but it must have occurred in
</p>
<p>1817. On reaching his majority, in 1840, he came to Mis-
</p>
<p>souri and settled in Boonville, where he practiced many
</p>
<p>years, and took rank with the best lawyers of central Mis-
</p>
<p>souri. Nature had provided iiim with all the elements of a
</p>
<p>successful lawyer. His mind was purely logical, and he
</p>
<p>delighted in legal research and in the investigation of appar-
</p>
<p>ently difficult problems of law. He was not an orator, but as
</p>
<p>a speaker was clear, lucid, argumentative, earnest, impress-
</p>
<p>ive, fluent, and convincing. Such was the confidence placed
</p>
<p>in him by courts and juries that it was difficult to cc^mbat
</p>
<p>any proposition which he earnestly maintained, and this gave
</p>
<p>him a success which few lawyers ever enjoyed.
</p>
<p>After obtaining as high a reputation as any man could
</p>
<p>obtain in the courts of central Missouri, Mr. Richardson in
</p>
<p>1850 moved to St. Louis, and opened an office there in con-

<p>nection with Sinclair Kirtley. Business came to the firm
</p>
<p>550 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>ver\' rapidly, but Mr. Kirtley's health soon failed, and he
</p>
<p>went to California. Mr. Richardson then became the part-
</p>
<p>ner of Samuel T. Glover, Esq., and the firm of Glover &
</p>
<p>Richardson did an immense business, and was retained in
</p>
<p>almost every case of great magnitude. No firm in the West-
</p>
<p>ern country ever enjoyed a higher reputation or did a more
</p>
<p>lucrative business than that of Glover & Richardson.
</p>
<p>In 1853 he held the highly honorable and responsible
</p>
<p>office of city counselor of St. Louis. In 1857 ^ vacancy
</p>
<p>occurred on the bench of the Supreme Court, and Mr. Rich-
</p>
<p>ardson received an almost unanimous call from the bar to fill
</p>
<p>it. He had no ambition for ofifice or public position, but the
</p>
<p>call was so general and so urgent that he was induced by a
</p>
<p>sense of duty to accept it, and he was elected by an over-
</p>
<p>whelming majority of the people. As an evidence of his
</p>
<p>ability as a jurist the reader is referred to his written opin-
</p>
<p>ions as found in volumes 25 to 28, inclusive, of the decisions
</p>
<p>of our highest court. They are clear, lucid, and profound,
</p>
<p>and will compare favorably with those of any judge who ever
</p>
<p>sat on the supreme bench.
</p>
<p>Judge Richardson soon became convinced that the duties
</p>
<p>of the office would impair his health, and in 1859 he resigned,
</p>
<p>much to the regret of the profession throughout the state.
</p>
<p>He returned to the practice, and again entered into partner-
</p>
<p>ship with Mr. Glover. While a resident of Boonville, Judge
</p>
<p>Richardson married a Miss Lionberger, of that place, an ac-
</p>
<p>complished and intelligent lady, and the match proved an
</p>
<p>exceedingly happy one.
</p>
<p>On September 21, i860, he died in St. Louis, in his forty-
</p>
<p>second year. His death created a profound sensation
</p>
<p>throughout Missouri. An immense meeting of the bar met
</p>
<p>at the court-house, to take action with reference to his death.
</p>
<p>The Hon. Edward Bates was called to the chair, Judges

<p>Wood and Lackland appointed vice-presidents, and M. R.

<p>Cullen, Esq., secretary. Judge C. D. Drake, from a com-
</p>
<p>mittee appointed by the meeting, reported a series of resolu-
</p>
<p>tions which were unanimously adopted. We here give the
</p>
<p>most important :
</p>
<p>JOHN C. RICHARDSON. 551
</p>
<p>^'Resolved, That the members of the St. Louis bar, assembled on the occa-
</p>
<p>sion of the sudden decease of their professional brother Hon. John C. Rich-
</p>
<p>ardson, desire in an especial manner to express the profound grief with which
</p>
<p>they received the intelligence of that sad event, and with which their hearts are
</p>
<p>moved as they come together to do honor to his memory. They feel that any
</p>
<p>ordinary terms used on such occasions would be wholly unsuited to this. The
</p>
<p>deceased was personally and professionally a man of elevated and superior na-
</p>
<p>ture, who never failed to impress those about him with his intelligence, his gen-
</p>
<p>tleness, and his geniality, as well as with the uprightness, the dignity, and the
</p>
<p>purity of his character. In professional and in private life he was equally
</p>
<p>above reproach, equally without enemies, and equally the object of sincere re-
</p>
<p>spect and cordial attachment of all who knew him. As a lawyer, his
</p>
<p>acquirements, his industry, his fidelity, and his amenity adorned and illus-
</p>
<p>trated the profession, and as a judge, during the brief period of his service as
</p>
<p>such on the supreme bench of this state, he displayed qualities which, had he
</p>
<p>continued in that sphere, would have placed his name in the annals of jurispru-
</p>
<p>dence among the highest lights of this country. His departure from our midst
</p>
<p>in the very prime and vigor of manhood is a calamity to the bar and the com-
</p>
<p>munity, over which we have only to mourn with deep and heartfelt sorrow."
</p>
<p>When Mr. Glover rose to speak of his late partner he was
</p>
<p>so overwhelmed with grief that he could scarcely give utter-
</p>
<p>ance to his thoughts. He said Mr. Richardson's character
</p>
<p>spoke the language of truth. It reflected no false lights, but
</p>
<p>it did certainly and surely stand out from the community, in
</p>
<p>a little while, to the eyes of those who beheld him, in its
</p>
<p>larger proportions of superiority. Mr. Glover alluded to an
</p>
<p>interview between himself and Governor H. R. Gamble, at
</p>
<p>the time Mr. Richardson was called upon to become a candi-
</p>
<p>date for the supreme bench. He said Governor Gamble was
</p>
<p>one of the first to initiate the call, and remarked to him
</p>
<p>" that he considered Mr. Richardson, by reason of his cor-
</p>
<p>rectness of mind, his patient industry and soundness of judg-
</p>
<p>ment, the proper man to be placed upon the bench ; that
</p>
<p>an eloquent man was always liable to make a very poor

<p>judge  that he would fail in the analyzation of the subject,
</p>
<p>that he would theorize to please his fancy, to the neglect of
</p>
<p>those tedious, dry, and more uninteresting details the consid-
</p>
<p>eration of which was essential to proper adjudication, and
</p>
<p>to bring out the justice of the case under the law that is
</p>
<p>applicable to it."

<p>Major Uriel Wright said his was a round character, with
</p>
<p>no angular point about it either in morals or intellect.
</p>
<p>Several others addressed the meeting in terms of the high-
</p>
<p>est eulogy. We noticed in the meeting many merchants,
</p>
<p>mechanics, and manufacturers, all of whom seemed to mani-
</p>
<p>fest a deep feeling of regret at the great loss which had been
</p>
<p>sustained, for his death cast a deep gloom over the entire

<p>community.

<p>His widow and several children survive him.
</p>
<p>Chester Harding, Jr.,
</p>
<p>Second son of Chester Harding, the celebrated Boston artist,
</p>
<p>was born in the village of Northampton, Massachusetts, in
</p>
<p>October, 1826. When of proper age he attended the public
</p>
<p>school of his native village, and afterwards in Boston and
</p>
<p>Springfield, Massachusetts, till he was fourteen years of age,
</p>
<p>when he entered Phillips x^cademy, at Exeter, New Hamp-
</p>
<p>shire, where he fitted for college and entered the sophomore
</p>
<p>class of Harvard University, Massachusetts, in the year 1842.
</p>
<p>During his whole collegiate course he stood high in all his
</p>
<p>college classes, and was distinguished for probity of character
</p>
<p>and manly bearing. He was universally esteemed and be-
</p>
<p>loved by his classmates.
</p>
<p>After leaving college Chester Harding came to St. Louis,
</p>
<p>and commenced the study of the law, in the early part of the
</p>
<p>year 1847, under direction of his brother-in-law, Hon. John
</p>
<p>M. Krum, then judge of the St. Louis Circuit Court. Early
</p>
<p>in 1 848 he entered the law school at Harvard College, where
</p>
<p>he graduated in 1850. In the same year he returned to St.
</p>
<p>Louis and commenced the practice of law, and in 1852 be-
</p>
<p>came a partner of his brother-in-law, Judge Krum (who had
</p>
<p>retired from the bench), and continued in practice in the firm
</p>
<p>of Krum & Harding till the outbreak of the civil war, in
</p>
<p>April, 1 86 1, when he promptly relinquished his professional
</p>
<p>business and entered the army, commissioned as colonel.
</p>
<p>He was made assistant adjutant-general, and assigned to
</p>
<p>duty on the staff of General Nathaniel Lyon, headquarters
</p>
<p>at United States Arsenal, St. Louis.
</p>
<p>We will first speak of the personal and professional char-
</p>
<p>acter of Mr. Harding. He was a diligent student in his pro-
</p>
<p>fession, and soon took front rank at the St. Louis bar. He
</p>
<p>was generous, magnanimous, and the soul of good nature.

</p>
<p>Honor and integrity marked his intercourse with his fellow-
</p>
<p>554 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>men, and his noble character was appreciated and respected
</p>
<p>by all who knew him. His strength as a lawyer appeared in
</p>
<p>his complete grasp and appreciation of every proposition of
</p>
<p>law that arose in his practice, and his discussions of legal
</p>
<p>questions were always clear, logical, and forcible, though al-
</p>
<p>ways demonstrated in a simple, unostentatious manner. Both
</p>
<p>the bar and the bench regarded him, though young, as one of
</p>
<p>the leading lawyers in the state of Missouri.
</p>
<p>Mr. Harding took little part in political affairs, rarely at-
</p>
<p>tended political gatherings, and never was a candidate for,
</p>
<p>or held, a political office. When the first gun of the civil war
</p>
<p>was fired at Sumter, every energy of Harding was aroused,
</p>
<p>and every thought and feeling of his nature was awakened
</p>
<p>and centered in his country's cause. This leads us to speak
</p>
<p>of his military career. In the inception of the civil war it is
</p>
<p>well known that St. Louis and Missouri occupied a conspicu-
</p>
<p>ous position. Captain Nathaniel Lyon (afterwards general)
</p>
<p>was then in command of a small military force at the United
</p>
<p>States Arsenal and Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis. A semi-
</p>
<p>state military organization (suspected of being in sympathy
</p>
<p>with the secessionists) was then encamped at Camp Jackson,
</p>
<p>in the suburbs of St. Louis. The whole country was in an
</p>
<p>excited state, and alarmed. Mr. Harding, without an hour's
</p>
<p>delay, laid aside his professional business, and tendered his
</p>
<p>services to the government in its great emergency. As stated,
</p>
<p>Chester Harding was commissioned, May i, 1861, colonel in
</p>
<p>the United States army, and assigned to duty, as assistant
</p>
<p>adjutant-general, on the staff of Brigadier-General Lyon, at
</p>
<p>St. Louis. Though undisciplined in any branch of the army
</p>
<p>service, he showed great fitness for his position, and no officer
</p>
<p>in the service performed more important, difficult, as well as
</p>
<p>delicate duties than he did in the organization, fitting out,
</p>
<p>and forwarding military forces in the Western Department.
</p>

<p>souri Colonel Harding was senior officer in command at St.
</p>
<p>Louis. His labors in this service were most arduous, and were
</p>
<p>continued until he was relieved, on the accession to the com-
</p>
<p>mand of the Western Department by Major-General Fremont,
</p>
<p>CHESTER HARDING, JR. 555
</p>
<p>in the following month of August. The reports of General
</p>
<p>Lyon and other officers to the adjutant-general of the army,
</p>
<p>one and all, teem with expressions of their high appreciation
</p>
<p>of the services of Colonel Harding while on the staff of
</p>
<p>General Lyon and in command at St. Louis.
</p>
<p>Immediately after Colonel Harding was relieved from
</p>
<p>dut\- at the Arsenal he was authorized to recruit a regiment,
</p>
<p>which he did, and on being mustered into service his regiment
</p>
<p>was ordered to join the forces under command of General
</p>
<p>Prentiss, in south-east Missouri, who was soon after super-
</p>
<p>seded by General Grant.
</p>
<p>After the battle at Belmont some of the Missouri regiments
</p>
<p>(including Colonel Harding's) had become so depleted in
</p>
<p>numbers they were ordered to be consolidated. This left
</p>
<p>the colonel without a command. He returned to Missouri
</p>
<p>and was authorized b}' General Halleck, who was then (April,
</p>
<p>1862) in command of the Western Department (or, as it was
</p>
<p>then called, the Department of the Mississippi), to recruit an-
</p>
<p>other regiment, which he did in a very short time. His new
</p>
<p>regiment, on being mustered into service, was ordered to join
</p>
<p>the reinforcements of Major-General Pope, in the vicinity of
</p>
<p>Corinth, whither General Halleck proceeded, after receiving
</p>
<p>reports of the Shiloh battles, and assumed command of all
</p>
<p>the Union forces. After the evacuation of Corinth by the
</p>
<p>rebels several of the regiments (including Harding's) in
</p>
<p>Pope's division were ordered back to south-east Missouri, to
</p>
<p>hold the enemy in check along the southern border of the
</p>
<p>state. After the evacuation of Fort Pillow and Fort Ran-
</p>
<p>dolph Colonel Harding, with his regiment, was ordered into
</p>
<p>Arkansas, in the vicinity of White River from its mouth to its
</p>
<p>source in Missouri, and while in service there he was promoted
</p>
<p>to be a brigadier.
</p>
<p>Space will not permit us to follow in detail the varied mili-
</p>
<p>tary services of General Harding. Therefore suffice it to

</p>
<p>of the war, with relentless energy and unfaltering patriotism,
</p>
<p>to uphold the honor, integrity, and union of the United

</p>
<p>States, and he was mustered out of service with the hcuiors
</p>
<p>accorded to a faithful soldier.
</p>
<p>General Harding, after the war, resumed the practice of
</p>
<p>his profession in the city of St. Louis, and continued it with
</p>
<p>varied success to the time of his death, which occurred in
</p>
<p>February, 1875. His remains rest in peace in I^ellefontaine
</p>
<p>Cemetery.
</p>
<p>On the demise of General Harding the members of the
</p>
<p>St. Louis bar paid a just and beautiful tribute to his worth
</p>
<p>and memory, by the following proceedings :
</p>
<p>" At a meeting of the members of the St. Louis bar, held in Circuit Court-
</p>
<p>Room No. I, on Thursday, February ii, 1875, for the purpose of paying their
</p>
<p>tribute of respect to their late brother, General Chester Harding, the following
</p>
<p>proceedings were had :
</p>
<p>"On motion, Colonel James O. Broadhead was called to the chair. On mo-
</p>
<p>tion, a committee, consisting of Albert Todd, A. N. Crane, John W. Noble, J.

<p>D. S. Dryclen, and H. M. Jones, was appointed to draft resolutions, and said
</p>
<p>committee reported the following:

<p>of the death of General Chester Harding, and in testimony of our regret and to

<p>AIKMAN WELCH.
</p>
<p>This gentleman was a native of Missouri, and born in
</p>
<p>Warren County, May 25, 1827. After receiving his prehmi-
</p>
<p>nary education he was sent to Columbia College, Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, D. C, where, if we have not been misinformed, he gradu-
</p>
<p>ated. After returning to Missouri he spent two years in the
</p>
<p>study of the law, was then admitted to the bar, and located at
</p>
<p>Warrensburg, in Johnson County. He soon gave evidence
</p>
<p>of more than ordinary legal ability. In i860 he represented
</p>
<p>Johnson County in the State Legislature. In December,
</p>
<p>1 86 1, he was appointed, by Governor Gamble, attorney-gen-
</p>
<p>eral  certainl)' a very high compliment to his professional
</p>
<p>ability when we consider that Governor Gamble was himself
</p>
<p>without a superior at the Missouri bar.
</p>
<p>It was about this time that we made Mr. Welch's acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance. He was a tall, spare-made man, and seemed to be
</p>
<p>suffering from weakness of his lungs  indeed, he died a few
</p>
<p>years afterwards with pulmonary consumption. We heard
</p>
<p>him make one or two arguments in the Supreme Court which
</p>
<p>evinced no little knowledge of the law. He was very affable
</p>
<p>in his manners, and, as a speaker, fluent and argumentative.
</p>
<p>He never could have excelled as an orator, nor did he make
</p>
<p>any pretensions in that sphere. His excellent common
</p>
<p>sense, and practical views upon all questions which he dis-
</p>
<p>cussed, secured the ear and close attention of his audience.
</p>
<p>In the Convention called to take into consideration the re-
</p>
<p>lations of the state with fhe Federal government, and which
</p>
<p>convened at Jefferson City in February, 1861, he took his
</p>
<p>seat as a delegate from the Fifteenth Senatorial District,
</p>
<p>composed of the counties of Henry and Johnson. He at
</p>
<p>once took strong ground against the severance of the Union,
</p>
<p>and denounced secession as absolute treason. Very few of

<p>County, Missouri. He died July 29, 1864.
</p>
<p>Newton D. Strong.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, with whom we were well acquainted, was
</p>
<p>the second son of William L. Strong, a Presbyterian minis-
</p>
<p>ter, who for more than twenty-five years was pastor of a
</p>
<p>church in Connecticut, and afterwards of a church in central
</p>
<p>New York. Newton was born October 17, 1809, at Somers,
</p>
<p>Lolland County, Connecticut, and there he spent his earlier
</p>
<p>years. He was prepared for admission to college by his
</p>
<p>father, and entered Yale as a freshman in 1827. He took
</p>
<p>a high position in his class, and maintained it until his gradu-
</p>
<p>ation, in 1 83 1. Not only did he rank high in general
</p>
<p>scholarship, but paid much attention to reading the English
</p>
<p>classics and to English composition, and early secured a
</p>
<p>reputation as a vigorous and elegant essayist. After his
</p>
<p>graduation he taught in a select school in Philadelphia one
</p>
<p>year, and in 1832 succeeded his elder brother, Hon. William
</p>
<p>Strong, now one of the justices of the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>the United States, as a teacher at Burlington, New Jersey,
</p>
<p>in a classical and mathematical school of a high order. We
</p>
<p>served with this brother in the Thirty-first Congress. He
</p>
<p>was chairman of the Committee on Elections, and became
</p>
<p>distinguished as a legislator, and few men have since ob-
</p>
<p>tained more reputation as a jurist.
</p>
<p>In 1834 Newton was appointed a tutor in Yale College,
</p>
<p>and continued so two years, when he resigned, and entered
</p>
<p>the law-office of his brother at Reading, Pennsylvania, where
</p>
<p>he completed his studies and was admitted to the bar. For
</p>
<p>a few months he remained at Easton, Pennsylvania, and then
</p>
<p>came West and located at Alton, Illinois, and entered into a
</p>
<p>partnership with his old college classmate, Junius Wall, Esq.
</p>
<p>They obtained a lucrative business, and. Mr. Strong was
</p>
<p>elected to the Legislature.

</p>
<p>In September, 1844, he married Miss Matilda R. Edwards,
</p>
<p>560 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>eldest daughter of Hon. Edgar Edwards, of Alton, with
</p>
<p>whom he lived happily until her death in February, 185 i.
</p>
<p>In 1847, at the earnest solicitation of his brother William,
</p>
<p>he removed to Reading, Pennsylvania, and took charge of
</p>
<p>the business of his brother, who had been elected to Con-
</p>
<p>gress.
</p>
<p>In 185 1 he came West again and settled in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>His reputation acquired in Illinois followed him to St. Louis,
</p>
<p>and secured for him a commanding position at that bar. In
</p>
<p>1853 he formed a partnership with his cousin, George P.
</p>
<p>Strong, Esq., who is well known as an able lawyer, and the
</p>
<p>firm did a very large business. The loss of his wife, in 1 851,
</p>
<p>threw a cloud of sorrow and disappointment over his re-
</p>
<p>maining years, and, having no children to stimulate him to
</p>
<p>further professional exertion, he devoted the remainder of
</p>
<p>his life to the cviltivation and indulgence of his taste for
</p>
<p>general literature. He was a great reader and a deep
</p>
<p>thinker, and whatever subject engaged his attention was
</p>
<p>thoroughly mastered. He was a thorough-read lawyer, and
</p>
<p>his tastes and habits fitted him particularly for the discussion
</p>
<p>of legal questions before an appellate tribunal. We heard
</p>
<p>him make several arguments in our Supreme Court which
</p>
<p>elicited much praise from both bench and bar. He had an
</p>
<p>easy and pleasant delivery, and spoke with that confidence
</p>
<p>which only a thorough knowledge of his subject could in-
</p>
<p>spire. Few men possessed a more thorough comprehension
</p>
<p>of the political events which were occurring in his time, and
</p>
<p>when the Rebellion broke out he took an open and decided
</p>
<p>stand for the Union. We often met him in a social way, and
</p>
<p>found him a most agreeable and entertaining gentleman.
</p>
<p>After the close of the war his health began to give way,
</p>
<p>and in August, 1866, he closed his earthly career in the fifty-
</p>
<p>seventh year of his age. His remains were taken to Read-

</p>
<p>ROBERT WILSON.
</p>
<p>Our personal knowledge of General Bob Wilson, as he
</p>
<p>was familiarly called, is very limited, but he was well known
</p>
<p>as one of the pioneers to Missouri, and as a prominent Whig
</p>
<p>politician for a third of a century.
</p>
<p>He was born near Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia, in
</p>
<p>November, 1800. His father was a very respectable farmer
</p>
<p>of English descent, and his mother was a Yancey, and be-
</p>
<p>longed to the noted family of that name in the Old Dominion.
</p>
<p>Robert received a fair English education, and it was the inten-
</p>
<p>tion of his father to give him a collegiate course, but, becom-
</p>
<p>ing financially embarrassed, he was forced to take his son
</p>
<p>from school.
</p>
<p>At an early age Robert was placed in the circuit-clerk's
</p>
<p>office at Staunton, where he remained several years, writing
</p>
<p>and copying. He there learned many of the forms of legal
</p>
<p>proceedings, which in after-life proved very serviceable to
</p>
<p>him. In the spring of 1820, before reaching maturity, he
</p>
<p>came to Missouri and located at old Franklin, in Howard
</p>
<p>County, then the most promising town in the state. Being
</p>
<p>without means, he went to Chariton County and opened a
</p>
<p>school near the old town of Chariton, where he taught some
</p>
<p>time. After the removal of the county-seat of Howard to
</p>
<p>Fayette he went there, and obtained a job in the clerk's
</p>
<p>office, at the same time officiating as deputy postmaster.
</p>
<p>In 1823 or 1824 he was appointed, by the governor, probate
</p>
<p>judge of Howard County, the duties of which he discharged
</p>
<p>until 1827, when the probate business was transferred by law
</p>
<p>to the County Court. In 1825 he married Miss Peggie
</p>
<p>Snoddy, and moved on a small farm, near the present site of
</p>
<p>Roanoke. Upon the organization of Jackson County he was
</p>
<p>tendered, by Judge David Todd, the office of clerk of the
</p>
<p>Circuit Court of that county, which he declined. About 1828

</p>
<p>he was appointed clerk of the Circuit and County Courts of
</p>
<p>Randolph County, and held that position until 1840. He
</p>
<p>then entered upon the practice of the law. It does not ap-
</p>
<p>pear that he pursued a regular course of legal study, but had
</p>
<p>received instruction from his brother, General John Wilson,
</p>
<p>who lived at Fayette, but afterwards moved to California and
</p>
<p>died there.
</p>
<p>In 1837 or 1838 he was appointed brigadier-general of the
</p>
<p>Missouri militia, and had command of a brigade in what was
</p>
<p>known as the Mormon War. He was a member of the court-
</p>
<p>martial convened to try some of the Mormon leaders, and
</p>
<p>gave the casting vote to turn them over to the civil authori-
</p>
<p>ties. From that time until 1852 he enjoyed a large practice
</p>
<p>at the bar in Randolph, Chariton, and other counties in that
</p>
<p>section of the state, and ranked among the best lawyers of
</p>
<p>central and western Missouri. He was a fluent and pleasant
</p>
<p>speaker, and richly endowed with good, hard common sense,
</p>
<p>which is not a general commodity even among the legal
</p>
<p>fraternity.
</p>
<p>He represented Randolph Count}' in the Legislature at
</p>
<p>the session of 1844-5. ^^ ^^'3-s afterwards elected to the
</p>
<p>State Senate from the district composed of the counties of
</p>
<p>Andrew, Holt, and Atchison. The district was decidedly
</p>
<p>Democratic, but General Wilson's personal popularity en-
</p>
<p>abled him to overcome the Democratic majority. He served
</p>
<p>two terms, a period of eight years, and was the acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged leader of his party in the Senate. He became one of
</p>
<p>the most prominent politicians in the state, and for a long
</p>
<p>period, in conjunction with a few others, led and controlled
</p>
<p>the Whig party. He was a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and
</p>
<p>a very decided hater of Colonel Benton. Being a fine stump-
</p>
<p>speaker, he never let an opportunity pass to empty the vials
</p>
<p>of his wrath upon the head of the Missouri senator.
</p>
<p>At the breaking-out of the Rebellion he declared himself

<p>openly for the Union under all circumstances, and was
</p>
<p>elected a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1861.
</p>
<p>He became a Conservative Democrat, and, in conjunction
</p>
<p>with Hon. Willard P. Hall, Hon. H. M. Vories, and a few
</p>
<p>ROBERT WILSON. 563
</p>
<p>other patriotic men, kept north-western Missouri from em-
</p>
<p>bracing secession. He was a man of great probity of char-
</p>
<p>acter and undoubted patriotism, and exercised a large and
</p>
<p>salutary influence in the Constitutional Convention. He
</p>
<p>was vice-president of that body, and, if we mistake not,
</p>
<p>ultimately became its president.
</p>
<p>In 1862 he and John B. Henderson were appointed United
</p>
<p>States senators in place of Judge Waldo P. Johnson and
</p>
<p>Governor Trusten Polk, whose places had been declared
</p>
<p>vacant by a resolution of the Federal Senate.
</p>
<p>General Wilson died at Marshall, Missouri, on May 10,

<p>1870, in the seventieth year of his age. He was a good

</p>
<p>man, and much beloved by all who knew him.
</p>
<p>James H. Peck.
</p>
<p>Of the early life of this noted Federal judge there is
</p>
<p>really nothing known, nor is there any one living at the
</p>
<p>present time who can impart any information as to the time
</p>
<p>and place of his birth or the character of his early educa-
</p>
<p>tion. It is known, however, that he came from the East to
</p>
<p>Missouri about the time of the organization of the state gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, and that he was a man of varied learning and
</p>
<p>classical attainments  in fact, he had the reputation of
</p>
<p>being an accomplished scholar and a thorough lawyer.
</p>
<p>He was appointed judge of the Federal court at St. Louis,
</p>
<p>and in 1826 became involved in a personal difficulty with
</p>
<p>Luke E. Lawless, an eminent lawyer at the St. Louis bar,
</p>
<p>which resulted in his being tried before the United States
</p>
<p>Senate upon articles of impeachment. Mr. Lawless was
</p>
<p>counsel for many of the old claimants under Spanish con-
</p>
<p>cessions, and had several cases pending in Judge Peck's
</p>
<p>court which were decided adversely to his clients. Appre-
</p>
<p>hensive that the decision of the Federal court, though an
</p>
<p>appeal had been taken, might have a disastrous effect upon
</p>
<p>the value of these claims, Judge Lawless undertook, in a
</p>
<p>communication to Tlie Missouri Advocate and St. Loms En-
</p>
<p>quirer, over the signature of "A Citizen," to show that the
</p>
<p>judge had erred in his decision, and that the claims would
</p>
<p>eventually be recognized as valid by the United States Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court. There was nothing in the language of the
</p>
<p>communication disrespectful to the judge, it being a simple
</p>
<p>criticism upon his opinion. Judge Peck, however, thought
</p>
<p>its tendency was to bring the decisions of the court into
</p>
<p>disrepute, and he determined to punish the offender. He
</p>
<p>made a rule on the proprietor of the paper to show cause
</p>
<p>why an attachment should not issue against him for contempt

<p>of court in publishing a false statement, calculated to bring
</p>
<p>JAMES H. PECK. 565
</p>
<p>odium on the court and impair the confidence of the pubhc
</p>
<p>in the purity of its decisions. The pubhsher rephed, deny-
</p>
<p>ing the jurisdiction of the court, inasmuch as an appeal had
</p>
<p>been taken in the case. He also affirmed that it was a fair
</p>
<p>and correct statement of the decision of the court, and con-
</p>
<p>cluded by giving the name of Luke E. Lawless as the author.
</p>
<p>The rule was then made on Mr. Lawless, who, in reply,
</p>
<p>admitted that he was the author, but contended that the
</p>
<p>object of the publication was to counteract the effect that
</p>
<p>the opinion of the court was calculated to produce on the
</p>
<p>value of the unconfirmed Spanish and French land titles.
</p>
<p>He also denied the jurisdiction of the court. Judge Peck
</p>
<p>sentenced him to twenty-four hours' imprisonment in jail,
</p>
<p>and suspended him from the practice for eighteen months.
</p>
<p>On December 8, 1826, John Scott, the sole representative
</p>
<p>in Congress from Missouri, presented to the House of Repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives a memorial from Mr. Lawless, charging Judge
</p>
<p>Peck with tyranny, oppression, and usurpation of power, and
</p>
<p>praying that the House would prefer articles of impeachment
</p>
<p>against him. No action was taken upon it at that or the next
</p>
<p>session, but finally the memorial was referred to a committee,
</p>
<p>who reported charges, and Judge Peck was summoned before
</p>
<p>the Federal Senate for trial.
</p>
<p>It soon became evident that it was destined to be one of
</p>
<p>the most important trials that had ever come before the Sen-
</p>
<p>ate, for it involved the questions as to the extent that a court
</p>
<p>could punish for supposed contempt, and what the powers of
</p>
<p>a court were in that respect, and what in point of fact
</p>
<p>amounted to a contempt. The utmost interest was felt in
</p>
<p>the result, for it was contended that if a fair criticism upon
</p>
<p>the judgment of a court could be made the foundation for a
</p>
<p>criminal prosecution, or what was tantamount to that, then
</p>
<p>the liberty of the press was a mere delusion. So important
</p>
<p>was this question regarded by the House of Representatives

<p>Mr. Buchanan, of Pennsylvania; Stoors, of New York;

<p>566 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>and the celebrated William Wirt, of Virginia, were retained
</p>
<p>for the defense. What gave the trial a still greater interest
</p>
<p>was the fact that among the members of the High Court of
</p>
<p>Impeachment who sat as triers of the fact were Webster,
</p>
<p>Clayton, Livingston, King, Poindexter, Grundy, White, For-
</p>
<p>syth, Chase, Tazewell, and other eminent jurists. Such an
</p>
<p>array of talent, both on the part of counsel and court, was
</p>
<p>never known before in this country, and will probably never
</p>
<p>be again.
</p>
<p>Half of the St. Louis bar were summoned to Washington
</p>
<p>City as witnesses, among them Colonel Benton, who, by rea-
</p>
<p>son of being a witness, did not take his seat in the court.
</p>
<p>The trial occupied six weeks, and resulted in Judge Peck's
</p>
<p>acquittal by the following vote : guilty, 21 ; not guilty, 22.
</p>
<p>The reader will not expect us to give the particulars of this
</p>
<p>famous trial, but he will find them, together with the argu-
</p>
<p>ment of counsel, in Stansbury's report of it, which is in every
</p>
<p>public library in the country. 'In preparing the pleadings
</p>
<p>Judge Peck and Mr. Lawless exhibited the highest traits of
</p>
<p>legal ability, and collected all the law that existed upon the
</p>
<p>subject both in England and this country.
</p>

</p>
<p>ing to the powers of courts to punish for contempt.

<p>this trial.
</p>
<p>Albert Jackson.
</p>
<p>The recent death of this judge, so generally noticed by the
</p>
<p>press, recalls to memory the celebrated impeachment trial
</p>
<p>before our Legislature, in which he figured as defendant.
</p>
<p>Of his place of nativity, boyhood, and early life we have
</p>
<p>sought information in vain. He was a married man, but
</p>
<p>his wife and children preceded him to the grave, and there
</p>
<p>is no relative in the West, or elsewhere, to whom we can
</p>
<p>apply for the incidents of his life prior to his coming to
</p>
<p>Missouri.
</p>
<p>It is said that he was an Eastern man, and received part of
</p>
<p>his education at West Point, and as far back as we have any
</p>
<p>recollection of him he bore the title of sfeneral. He came
</p>
<p>to Missouri about the year 1840, and commenced the prac-
</p>
<p>tice of the law in Jackson, Cape Girardeau County, where
</p>
<p>he remained through life. He had not practiced long before
</p>
<p>he was elected or appointed circuit attorney of his circuit.
</p>
<p>Soon after this he was elected judge of the Fifteenth Judi-
</p>
<p>cial Circuit, embracing the counties of Stoddard, Wayne,
</p>
<p>Reynolds, Shannon, Oregon, Ripley, and others. In 1865
</p>
<p>he succeeded Judge Thomas B. English on the bench of the
</p>
<p>Tenth Judicial Circuit, Judge English having been removed
</p>
<p>by the Drake Radical Constitution, which swept out of
</p>
<p>office the entire judiciary of the state. It was while holding
</p>
<p>this office that the impeachment trial was instigated.
</p>
<p>He was a man of good address, a fine declaimer, and
</p>
<p>by no means deficient in his knowledge of the law ; but he
</p>
<p>imbibed strong prejudices and dislikes, and towards many of
</p>
<p>the members of the bar who practiced in his courts he was
</p>
<p>overbearing and tyrannical. This led to his impeachment
</p>
<p>upon various charges, such as tyranny, oppression, and
</p>
<p>favoritism, and the entire bar of his circuit was summoned

<p>Judge Jackson appeared i)i propria persona, and the old
</p>
<p>adage that " he who tries his own case has a fool for a
</p>
<p>client " was certainly not verified in his case, for he made a
</p>
<p>successful defense, and proved a full match for those ap-
</p>
<p>pointed managers on the part of the state. His answer to
</p>
<p>the charges preferred against him was prepared with much
</p>
<p>skill and ingenuity, and elicited no little praise from the pro-
</p>
<p>fession generally. He remained on the bench but a short
</p>
<p>time after his trial, and died in April or May last at his resi-
</p>
<p>dence in Jackson. He was too vindictive in his disposition
</p>
<p>to have many attached friends, and on the bench made

<p>no effort to conciliate those who were opposed to him.
</p>
<p>George w. Goode
</p>
<p>Was a well-known lawyer at the St. Louis bar. He was born
</p>
<p>at Whitly, Henrico County, Virginia, on November 9, 181 5,
</p>
<p>and was of English descent. His father, John G. Goode, was
</p>
<p>for many years clerk of the court of that county, and edu-
</p>
<p>cated his son with the view of making the law^ his profession.
</p>
<p>He first went to Rappahannock Academy, and when he
</p>
<p>became sufficiently advanced to enter upon a collegiate
</p>
<p>course his father sent him to the University of Virginia, at
</p>
<p>which institution he graduated with honor. After complet-
</p>
<p>ing his law studies he obtained a license to practice, and
</p>
<p>opened an office at Richmond, and for a time was asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with the Hon. James A. Seddon, who, it will be re-
</p>
<p>membered, was secretary of war under Jeff Davis during
</p>
<p>the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>While practicing in Richmond an incident occurred which
</p>
<p>no doubt led to his removal to Missouri. One of his intimate
</p>
<p>friends was involved in a personal difficulty  had in fact re-
</p>
<p>ceived an insult, but was prevented b\' his religious scrupules
</p>
<p>from inviting his adversary to the field, and Mr. Goode
</p>
<p>took up the quarrel and sent a challenge, which, under the
</p>
<p>laws of his state, incapacitated him from holding civil office.
</p>
<p>He then came to Missouri and settled in St. Louis, making a
</p>
<p>partnership with Tully R. Cormick, an old classmate in col-
</p>
<p>lege ; but the connection was soon dissolved by the ill health
</p>
<p>of his partner. We are under the impression that he never
</p>
<p>again practiced in partnership with any one.
</p>
<p>He never entered into a general practice, but confined
</p>
<p>himself to a few cases, in one of which he obtained consid-
</p>
<p>erable reputation as a land lawyer. We allude to the case
</p>
<p>of Bissell vs. Penrose, reported in 8th Howard's (U. S.)
</p>
<p>Reports, page 317. It involved the title to a large tract of

</p>
<p>land adjoining St. Louis, of immense value. It was taken to
</p>
<p>570 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of the United States by writ of error
</p>
<p>from the United States Circuit Court for the District of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri. The plaintiff derived his title from a confirmed Span-
</p>
<p>ish concession, under act of Congress of June 30, 1836, and
</p>
<p>the defendant under a New-Madrid location, under act of
</p>
<p>Congress of February 17, 18 1 5. Both titles rested upon
</p>
<p>acts of Congress, and depended upon the interpretation
</p>
<p>which was to be given them. The principal question was
</p>
<p>whether at the time of the location of the New- Madrid cer-
</p>
<p>tificate the land was reserved from sale by act of Congress,
</p>
<p>and if so then the location was void. Messrs. Benton, Gam-
</p>
<p>ble, and Geyer appeared in behalf of the plaintiff in error, an d
</p>
<p>Mr. Goode, and Thomas L. Ewing, of Ohio, in behalf of the
</p>
<p>defendant in error. The court below had sustained the
</p>
<p>Spanish concession, and the judgment of the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>was in affirmance. The immense value of the land, added to
</p>
<p>the eminence of the counsel engaged, invested the cause
</p>
<p>with unusual importance. Upon the decision depended the
</p>
<p>title to property worth ;^i,ooo,ooo. The opinion of the bar
</p>
<p>generally was favorable to the New-Madrid location, but
</p>
<p>the decision of the United States Supreme Court estab-
</p>
<p>lished the contrary doctrine. Mr. Goode devoted a long
</p>
<p>time to the consideration of the case, and, although associated
</p>
<p>with a very eminent lawyer, received the greatest praise for
</p>
<p>his legal acumen. It is said that his fee in the case amounted
</p>
<p>to $60,000, which to some extent was no doubt contingent.
</p>
<p>He married a daughter of Judge Wash, a lady of beauty,
</p>
<p>refinement, and intelligence, and on several occasions we
</p>
<p>visited them at their country residence in the vicinity of St.
</p>
<p>Louis.
</p>
<p>Mr. Goode was by nature a gentleman. He could not be
</p>
<p>otherwise. The meanest dog that walks the streets could
</p>
<p>not enter his house without meeting a hospitable reception.
</p>
<p>About this time his nervous system became impaired, and

</p>
<p>he suffered greatly from neuralgia. His physicians advised
</p>
<p>him to repair to the country, and he purchased a farm on
</p>
<p>the Meramec River, about forty miles from St. Louis. He
</p>
<p>lived there some time, and with his pack of hounds fre-

</p>
<p>quently indulged in the chase, an amusement exceedingly
</p>
<p>attractive to most Virginians. But his health continued to
</p>
<p>fail, and finally resulted in the softening of the brain, from
</p>
<p>which he died on January 14, 1863, in the forty-ninth year of
</p>
<p>his age.
</p>
<p>We never heard Mr. Goode make a speech or argument,
</p>
<p>but it is said he was fluent and logical, and his manner
</p>
<p>vehement and impressive. He made no attempt at oratory,
</p>
<p>but aimed to convince the understanding. He was a man
</p>
<p>of strong prejudices, and most uncompromising in his ad-
</p>
<p>herence to slavery. He was unwilling to concede to others
</p>
<p>anything growing out of their education and place of birth,
</p>
<p>but looked upon every man who did not concur with him on
</p>
<p>that subject as an Abolitionist, and necessarily inimical to
</p>
<p>the South. By this course he lost many friends, and his
</p>
<p>irritability was no doubt greatly enhanced by the disease
</p>
<p>which constantly preyed upon him. He was a man of a
</p>
<p>high sense of honor, and his integrity was beyond a

<p>question.
</p>
<p>Jonathan m. Bassett.
</p>
<p>We regret that our information in regard to Mr. Bassett is
</p>
<p>almost confined to our personal knowledge. We met him
</p>
<p>in the Legislature in 1844 or 1846. He represented in part
</p>
<p>the county of Buchanan, and was a practicing lawyer
</p>
<p>residing at St. Joseph. He was born in Oxford County,
</p>
<p>Connecticut, February 17, 18 17, and had the advantage of
</p>
<p>an excellent education. His first location after coming
</p>
<p>West was at Quincy, Illinois, where he practiced some, and
</p>
<p>took charge of the editorial department of a political paper.
</p>
<p>From Quinc}' he went to Plattsburg, Clinton County, Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, and as soon as St. Joseph became the county-seat of
</p>
<p>Buchanan County he moved to that place, where he re-
</p>
<p>mained till his death. He first formed a partnership in St.
</p>
<p>Joseph with John Wilson, son of Colonel Robert Wilson,
</p>
<p>upon the dissolution of which he entered into a partnership
</p>
<p>with J. C. C. Thornton, and the last partnership was with
</p>
<p>Wash Jones.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bassett was a fine-looking, portly man and a hand-
</p>
<p>some, fluent speaker. He was esteemed a good lawyer, and
</p>
<p>always enjoyed a good practice, which extended over a large
</p>
<p>section of country. He stood well in the Legislature,
</p>
<p>though not as active and influential as many others.
</p>
<p>Shortly after leaving the Legislature he married Miss
</p>
<p>Nancy Dixon, a belle of Jefierson City, and daughter of
</p>
<p>Henry Dixon, Esq. She was an interesting lady, and a par-
</p>
<p>ticular friend of the author.
</p>
<p>It is possible that Mr. Bassett may have filled other offices,
</p>
<p>but we cannot recall any. He was highly esteemed in the
</p>
<p>north-west, not only for his ability as a lawyer, but for many
</p>
<p>personal attributes which he possessed. He died January
</p>
<p>4, 1 87 1, leaving a widow and two children  a son and

<p>daughter.
</p>
<p>Walter L. Lovelace.
</p>
<p>The history of this gentleman furnishes an a[)t illustration
</p>
<p>of what industry, self-will, and determination may accomplish
</p>
<p>in the face of the most adverse circumstances. His father
</p>
<p>was a Baptist minister in Virginia, and died in that state in
</p>
<p>1833. He was twice married, and had seven children by
</p>
<p>each marriage. Walter was by the second marriage, and was
</p>
<p>born in Charlotte County, October i, 1831. His parents
</p>
<p>were in very limited circumstances, and unable to give their
</p>
<p>children a liberal education. Upon the death of the father,
</p>
<p>the mother with her children came to Missouri and settled
</p>
<p>in Montgomery County. This was in 1833. She died in
</p>
<p>1862. During Walter's boyhood he worked on a farm dur-
</p>
<p>ing the summer and went to a country school in the winter.
</p>
<p>In 1850 he taught a district school in Montgomery County
</p>
<p>at a compensation of $^0 per month. With this, and
</p>
<p>some money he borrowed from friends, he was enabled
</p>
<p>to spend several terms at the University of Columbia. On
</p>
<p>his return to Montgomery County he again taught school.
</p>
<p>In 1853 he married Miss Eliza A. Bush and opened a school
</p>
<p>at Danville, and, while teaching there, commenced the study
</p>
<p>of the law under Ben Sharp, a prominent lawyer of that place.
</p>
<p>In 1854 he was admitted to the bar, but for several years had
</p>
<p>a hard time to make a living. In October, 1862, he lost his
</p>
<p>wife, and in June, 1864, married her sister. He was twice
</p>
<p>elected to the State Legislature  in 1862 and 1864. In the
</p>
<p>latter year he was chosen speaker of the House of Representa-
</p>
<p>tives, and in 1 865 was appointed judge of the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>He died in Danville, August 5, 1866, leaving a widow and
</p>
<p>several children surviving him. During his judicial term he
</p>
<p>suffered greatly with weakness of the lungs, and finally died
</p>
<p>with consumption. His death was no doubt greatly acceler-

<p>ated by the labors of the bench. His ambition to discharge
</p>
<p>574 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>his judicial duties, and to satisfy the expectation of his friends,
</p>
<p>caused him to undergo a greater amount of labor than his
</p>
<p>physical condition justified, and he survived but a short
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>We had not the pleasure of Judge Lovelace's acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance, but among those who knew him intimately he was
</p>
<p>regarded as a promising jurist. He was by no means bril-
</p>
<p>liant, but was thoroughly read in his profession, and, if life
</p>
<p>and health had been spared him, would undoubtedly have
</p>
<p>made a reputation on the bench. He was a man of great
</p>
<p>personal integrity and studious and moral habits. A strong
</p>
<p>desire to discharge every duty incumbent upon him charac-
</p>
<p>terized his entire life, and the people of Montgomery
</p>
<p>County will never cease to venerate his memory.
</p>
<p>At the time of his death he had not quite reached his

<p>thirty-fifth year.
</p>
<p>Charles wheeler.
</p>
<p>This gentleman was connected through his professional
</p>
<p>life with the Lincoln County bar. He was born in Hancock
</p>
<p>County, New Hampshire, in April, 1795, and after finishing
</p>
<p>his preparatory course in the common schools of his native
</p>
<p>county entered Dartmouth College, and graduated there in
</p>
<p>1818. In 1820 he emigrated to the West, first stopping at
</p>
<p>New Castle, Kentucky, where he took charge of the New
</p>
<p>Castle College for a full term of nine months. Thence he
</p>
<p>went to Bedford, in the same county, and taught a private
</p>
<p>school until 1825, in the meantime employing his leisure
</p>
<p>hours in the study of the law, under the instruction of the
</p>
<p>Hon. David White, who was a circuit judge in Kentucky,
</p>
<p>and afterwards represented his district in Congress.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler came to Missouri in the latter part of 1825,
</p>
<p>and entered upon the practice of the law in Lincoln County.
</p>
<p>It is possible that he may have been admitted to the bar be-
</p>
<p>fore leaving Kentucky, but we cannot speak advisedly in
</p>
<p>reference to that. He was certainly licensed in Missouri
</p>
<p>immediately after coming here.
</p>
<p>He remained a bachelor until 1835, when he married Miss
</p>
<p>Parmelia Redman, a daughter of Dr. William Redman, of
</p>
<p>St. Charles County. About six years prior to his marriage
</p>
<p>he was appointed a justice of the peace by Governor John
</p>
<p>Miller, and held the office until a short time before his death,
</p>
<p>which occurred in February, 1873, in his eightieth year. At
</p>
<p>that time the office was one of honor and responsibility, for
</p>
<p>though the jurisdiction was very limited, it took in fully a
</p>
<p>third of all the litigation of the county, and the incumbents
</p>
<p>were taken from the best class of citizens. Mr. Wheeler had
</p>
<p>an illustrious example in the case of Mr. Jefferson, who, after
</p>
<p>retiring from the presidency, served many years as a justice

</p>
<p>of the peace in Virginia. The people of Lincoln County
</p>
<p>576 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>knew the value of Mr. Wheeler's services too well to dis-
</p>
<p>pense with him, and he was too patriotic a public servant to
</p>
<p>withhold them. For a short period he also filled the office
</p>
<p>of justice of the County Court, which was then invested with
</p>
<p>probate business. Having ample means, there was no incen-
</p>
<p>tive to do the drudgery of a lawyer, and as he was not a
</p>
<p>fluent and ready speaker, he was content to serve the people
</p>
<p>in a capacity more congenial to him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler had three children  two daughters and a son.
</p>
<p>He was a man of much will and tenacity of purpose, which
</p>
<p>came very near resulting in serious trouble at the time of
</p>
<p>his marriage. Upon the occasion of the marriage ceremony,
</p>
<p>at the residence of the bride's parents, a noisy crowd assem-
</p>
<p>bled for the purpose of giving them a charivari  a French
</p>
<p>custom, more in vogue then than now. He refused to com-
</p>
<p>ph' with their demands, alleging that his case was not a
</p>
<p>legitimate occasion for such mirth, as neither of the parties
</p>
<p>had ever been married before. They replied that he was an

<p>in his private intercourse genial and pleasant.
</p>
<p>Lewis V. bogy,
</p>
<p>Late a United States senator from Missouri, and the only-
</p>
<p>native-born Missourian who ever sat in that august body,
</p>
<p>was of French origin  born in the town of St. Genevieve, on
</p>
<p>April 9, 1 813. His education was very Hmited, for in that
</p>
<p>day there were but few schools, and none in which a pupil
</p>
<p>could obtain a knowledge of the classics. The want of a
</p>
<p>finished education Mr. Bogy felt throughout life. In the
</p>
<p>early part of 1832 he commenced the study of the law with
</p>
<p>Nathaniel Pope, then a rising lawyer of Kaskaskia, and soon
</p>
<p>after enlisted as a private in Captain Jacob Freeman's com-
</p>
<p>pany, in a regiment commanded by Colonel Gabriel Jones,
</p>
<p>of Henry's brigade, in the Black Hawk War, and partici-
</p>
<p>pated in the battles of Wisconsin Heights and Bad Ax.
</p>
<p>Upon the close of the war Mr. Bogy was sent to Lexington,
</p>
<p>Kentucky, to attend the law school of Transylvania Univer-
</p>
<p>sity, where he graduated in 1835, and soon after was licensed
</p>
<p>by Judge Wash. He then opened a law-office in St. Louis,
</p>
<p>with Logan Hunton as a partner, and continued there in
</p>
<p>the practice till 1849, in the meantime serving a term in the
</p>
<p>State Legislature. In the year last mentioned he again took
</p>
<p>up his residence in St. Genevieve, and was again elected to
</p>
<p>the Legislature, and became interested by purchase in the
</p>
<p>Pilot Knob, one of the most remarkable deposits of iron ore
</p>
<p>in the world. This investment, from the want of labor and
</p>
<p>transportation, proved unprofitable, and Mr. Bogy was
</p>
<p>forced to resume his practice, which he continued until the
</p>
<p>breaking-out of the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>In 1867 President Johnson tendered him the appointment
</p>
<p>of commissioner of Indian affairs, which he accepted, and
</p>
<p>during the short time of his occupancy made himself very
</p>
<p>familiar with our Indian affairs, whicli afterwards proved
</p>
<p>of great value to him as a United States senator.

</p>
<p>During most of this time Colonel Bogy took an active
</p>
<p>part in the political troubles of the country, often addressing
</p>
<p>the people from the stump, and in fact obtained considerable
</p>
<p>reputation as a stump-speaker. It is stated that at an early
</p>
<p>period of his life he formed a great desire to become a
</p>
<p>United States senator, and all his efforts in life were aimed
</p>
<p>in that direction. It seemed to him a position as high as
</p>
<p>any honorable ambition should aspire to. During the war
</p>
<p>he kept very quiet, though it was well known that his sym-
</p>
<p>pathies were largely with the South. Before the meeting of
</p>
<p>the General Assembly, in the winter of 1872-3, he publicly
</p>
<p>announced himself as a candidate for the United States Sen-
</p>
<p>ate. His time had come for the gratification of his ambition,
</p>
<p>for, on the assembling of the Legislature, he was elected over
</p>
<p>General J. B. Henderson by a large majority. Colonel
</p>
<p>Bogy at that time was supposed to be quite wealthy, and it
</p>
<p>was currently reported that he had expended large sums of
</p>
<p>money to procure his election, but this he stoutly denied,
</p>
<p>and challenged the most scrutinizing investigation ; but there
</p>
<p>was no evidence of the fact beyond the ordinary custom of
</p>
<p>giving suppers and entertainments. He, however, was not
</p>
<p>satisfied to let the matter rest there, and demanded a full
</p>
<p>investigation by a committee of the House ; whereupon a
</p>
<p>committee of five was appointed, with ample power to make
</p>
<p>a thorough and searching examination, and the majority
</p>
<p>report, signed by all but one  four out of five  fully
</p>
<p>exonerated him, and the House, by a vote of sixty-one to
</p>
<p>twenty-one, adopted a resolution declaring that their confi-
</p>
<p>dence in his purity and honest}' was unimpaired.
</p>
<p>Colonel Bogy took no reputation with him to Washington,
</p>
<p>as a statesman, but when he began to participate actively in
</p>
<p>the debates he disclosed forensic powers which soon attracted
</p>
<p>the attention of the country and gave him a national repu-
</p>
<p>tation. His early speeches on Indian affairs showed how

</p>
<p>thoroughly he had examined that subject, and his views and
</p>
<p>opinions were eagerly sought by the Indian Bureau. He
</p>
<p>was placed on several of the most important committees, and
</p>
<p>when the subject of the late presidential election came before
</p>
<p>LFAVrS V. BOGY. 579
</p>
<p>the Senate he boldly led off in the attacks upon the Return-
</p>
<p>ing Board of Louisiana, and proved to the satisfaction of the
</p>
<p>country that Governor Tilden was cheated out of his election
</p>
<p>by the most gigantic frauds ever perpetrated in any civilized
</p>
<p>country. In that memorable debate he tackled Morton and
</p>
<p>other Republican senators with an ability that surprised the
</p>
<p>country and greatly gratified his constituents. His exer-
</p>
<p>tions upon that occasion impaired his health, and upon the
</p>
<p>adjournment of Congress he repaired to Colorado to avail
</p>
<p>himself of that healthful climate ; but the disease which had
</p>
<p>fastened itself upon him was beyond the reach of climate or
</p>
<p>medicine, and he returned to St. Louis to die among his
</p>
<p>friends.
</p>
<p>That Colonel Bogy exhibited in the Senate mental powers
</p>
<p>far beyond what he was credited with is now universally con-
</p>
<p>ceded, and the people of the state are just beginning to
</p>
<p>realize the loss they have sustained in his death. Colonel
</p>
<p>Bogy made no pretensions to eloquence, but he was a bold,
</p>
<p>fluent, and ardent speaker, and whatever he said was uttered
</p>
<p>with an earnestness that carried conviction to the minds of
</p>
<p>his hearers. He was never at a loss for language, and had a
</p>
<p>clear and distinct enunciation, with just enough of the French
</p>
<p>accent to produce a pleasant and agreeable sound.
</p>
<p>At the time of his death he was gaining rapidly in public
</p>
<p>estimation, and had his life been spared a few }-ears longer
</p>
<p>he must have secured a position in the Senate which few
</p>
<p>public men ever attain.
</p>
<p>He was a man of large public spirit, which often led him
</p>
<p>to embark in enterprises beyond his means, keeping him in
</p>
<p>a constant state of pecuniary embarrassment. He took a
</p>
<p>deep interest in developing the mineral resources of the
</p>
<p>state, and invested large sums of money in the Iron Moun-
</p>
<p>tain and Pilot Knob.
</p>
<p>In his intercourse with others he was social, free, and lib-

<p>eral, and ever ready to respond to the calls of charity. He
</p>
<p>was exceedingly free in the expression of his opinions, but
</p>
<p>uttered them in a way so as to avoid giving offense to those
</p>
<p>who might differ with him. He was eminently a fair man.
</p>

</p>
<p>and never indulged in vituperation or abuse ; nor would he
</p>
<p>let prejudice or bias lead him to form an unfavorable opinion
</p>
<p>respecting a political opponent. During the exciting debate
</p>
<p>in the Senate respecting the fraudulent election-returns from
</p>
<p>Louisiana and Florida, many charges were made b}' the
</p>
<p>Democratic press not complimentary to the personal integ-
</p>
<p>rity of the late Senator Morton ; but Colonel Bogy sought
</p>
<p>the first occasion to let Mr. Morton know that they had not
</p>
<p>in the least diminished his confidence in him as a man of
</p>
<p>honor.
</p>
<p>Senator Morton was a man of extreme views and strong
</p>
<p>prejudices, and would go almost any length to advance the
</p>
<p>interests of his party; but that furnished no reason upon
</p>
<p>which to predicate a doubt as to his moral stamina, for party
</p>
<p>ties are very strong and exacting, and few who seek politiccd
</p>
<p>promotion have the nerve to resist them.
</p>
<p>While Colonel Bogy was actively engaged in his profession
</p>
<p>he was retained chiefly in land suits, for, being a native of the
</p>
<p>state, he was familiar with the old Spanish and French titles,
</p>
<p>and perfectly understood the habits and peculiarities of the
</p>
<p>old French inhabitants, and, as few of them understood the
</p>
<p>English language. Colonel Bogy's knowledge of French
</p>
<p>gave him a decided advantage over an opponent who was
</p>
<p>ignorant of it.
</p>
<p>The close application and confinement which success in the
</p>
<p>profession demand were not suited to Colonel Bogy's taste ;
</p>
<p>hence we often find him engaged in other pursuits, and
</p>
<p>only returning to the practice when driven to it by necessity.
</p>
<p>He died in St. Louis, in 1 877, in his sixty-fifth year. In the
</p>
<p>hall of the Mercantile Library at St. Louis there is a full-
</p>
<p>length portrait of him, but by whom painted we are not ad-

<p>vised.
</p>
<p>James K. Knight.
</p>
<p>The people of St. Louis have not yet recovered from the
</p>
<p>shock produced by the tragic death of this lawyer, who,
</p>
<p>while a judge of the St. Louis Circuit Court, took his own
</p>
<p>life. Judge Knight was born in the village of Canandaigua,
</p>
<p>Ontario County, New York. He was of Irish lineage, and
</p>
<p>his ancestors were mostly farmers, and the judge himself
</p>
<p>worked on his father's farm for many years. They come
</p>
<p>from a very long-lived family, for the judge's father, who
</p>
<p>still survives him, is upwards of ninety years of age, and his
</p>
<p>father died at one hundred and fifteen.
</p>
<p>In 1 83 1 the family left New York and settled in west
</p>
<p>Michigan. James first received an academic education, and
</p>
<p>then entered the freshman class of the University of Michi-
</p>
<p>gan, where he remained until he reached the junior class,
</p>
<p>when he left the institution and entered Union College, at
</p>
<p>Schenectady, New York, where he graduated with much
</p>
<p>honor. He then returned to Michigan, and after spending a
</p>
<p>year working on the farm, he commenced the study of the
</p>
<p>law, was elected county clerk, and in 1854 admitted to the
</p>
<p>practice. Probably from laborious study, as much as any
</p>
<p>other cause, his health began to fail, and, under the advice of
</p>
<p>his physician, he commenced traveling, and visited Florida,
</p>
<p>Texas, and most of the southern cities, and in 1855 located
</p>
<p>in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>Soon after entering upon his profession he turned his at-
</p>
<p>tention to admiralty cases, which confined him almost exclu-
</p>
<p>sively to the United States courts.
</p>
<p>In 1865 he took a trip to Europe and visited most of the
</p>
<p>prominent cities on the Continent, and was able to store his
</p>
<p>mind with that information which travel alone can give. He
</p>
<p>was absent little more than half the year.

<p>Judge Knight was a very popular man with the people, as
</p>
<p>582 BENCH AND BAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>a service of eight years on the bench of tiie Circuit Court by
</p>
<p>election fully attests. In his intercourse with others he was
</p>
<p>genial, affable, and entertaining. In fact, he was an open, gen-
</p>
<p>erous-hearted, and polished gentleman, w ith no enemies and
</p>
<p>a host of attached friends. He was also a man of varied ac-
</p>
<p>complishments, and Major W. H. H. Russell, who delivered a
</p>
<p>beautiful eulogy upon the occasion of presenting to one of
</p>
<p>the courts the resolutions of a bar-meeting called to pay a
</p>
<p>tribute of respect to his memory, informs us that he was a
</p>
<p>lover of music, the fine arts, history, belles-lettres, and the
</p>
<p>drama. He certainly had many qualities that made him a
</p>
<p>very desirable companion, for he possessed a fine fund of
</p>
<p>humor, and told, as well as enjoyed, a good anecdote. While
</p>
<p>we did not regard him as learned a jurist as some who have
</p>
<p>graced oiu' circuit bench, still he had many fine qualities as
</p>
<p>a judge, which greatly endeared him to the bar. He had no
</p>
<p>prejudices to encounter and no partialities to combat, and
</p>
<p>treated every lawyer, party, and witness in his court with the
</p>
<p>utmost courtesy. If he showed any leaning in favor of any
</p>
<p>particular class of the bar, it was to the younger members,
</p>
<p>who, in the commencement of their career, often meet with
</p>
<p>many difficulties and embarrassments. To them he was espe-
</p>
<p>cially kind and indulgent. Another excellent trait which he
</p>
<p>carried upon the bench was a patient hearing of argument.
</p>
<p>His freedom from bigoted opinion, or self-conceit, and his
</p>
<p>anxiety to avoid error, caused him to indulge counsel in argu-
</p>
<p>ment to a greater extent than seemed to us necessary. He
</p>
<p>seemed to be thoroughly impressed with the idea that a nisi-
</p>
<p>priiis judge, called upon suddenly, without time for reflec-
</p>
<p>tion, and in the hurry and excitement of a trial, was liable to
</p>
<p>commit error; and hence, when counsel pressed for a new
</p>
<p>trial upon the ground of error in the instructions of the
</p>
<p>court, or in the admission or refusal of evidence, he listened
</p>
<p>patiently to their argument and consulted freely the author-

</p>
<p>Judge Knight was a bachelor, and lived at a beautiful
</p>
<p>country-seat eight or ten miles below St. Louis, on the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi River. He spent several years in adorning it, and
</p>
<p>JAMES K. KNIGHT. 583
</p>
<p>was proud of its beauty and attractions. There was nothing
</p>
<p>to indicate that he was not leading a very happy and con-
</p>
<p>tented hfe, when about two years ago the intelUgence reached
</p>
<p>the city that Judge Knight was dead  had committed sui-
</p>
<p>cide by shooting himself through the body. We saw him
</p>
<p>on the bench the dav before, and he seemed to be in his
</p>
<p>usual good spirits. There is a mystery surrounding Judge
</p>
<p>Knight's death which no one can solve. He was in the habit
</p>
<p>of sleeping with a pistol under his pillow, for he had no
</p>
<p>police protection, and his place was accessible to tramps and
</p>
<p>roving vagabonds, who might at any moment enter his premi-
</p>
<p>ses to rob and plunder. He had been afflicted for years
</p>
<p>with erysipelas in one of his legs, which gave him much pain
</p>
<p>and anxiety, but beyond that there was no apparent cause
</p>
<p>for mental despondency. Towards his last moments he stated
</p>
<p>that it was an accident, and charity leads us to assign that as

<p>the true solution of his untimely end.
</p>
<p>William M. Cooke,
</p>
<p>At one time a prominent lawyer in Hannibal, Missouri, at a
</p>
<p>later period judge of the Court of Common Pleas of that city,
</p>
<p>at a still subsequent period a practitioner at the St. Louis
</p>
<p>bar, and finally a member of the Confederate Congress, was
</p>
<p>born in Portsmouth, Virginia, on December 1 1 . 1 823. His edu-
</p>
<p>cation was obtained at the University of Virginia, where he
</p>
<p>graduated with honor in 1843. Being a fine classical scholar,
</p>
<p>with a well-balanced mind and studious habits, he com-
</p>
<p>menced the study of the law under the most auspicious cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, and in due time became well grounded in the
</p>
<p>principles of the common law. After completing his legal
</p>
<p>studies he came to St. Louis and commenced the practice,
</p>
<p>and in 1846 married the accomplished daughter of Henry
</p>
<p>Von Phul, one of the oldest and most influential merchants
</p>
<p>of St. Louis.
</p>
<p>In 1849 ^^''- Cooke left St. Louis and settled in Hannibal,
</p>
<p>and there obtained considerable reputation in his profession.
</p>
<p>About this time the business of Hannibal rendered an addi-
</p>
<p>tional court necessary, and the Legislature created the Court
</p>
<p>of Common Pleas. Mr. Cooke was appointed its judge, and
</p>
<p>discharged the duties of the office to the entire satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion of the bar and the people. In order that Mrs. Cooke
</p>
<p>might be near her father, who was getting far advanced in
</p>
<p>years, the judge returned to St. Louis, and in 1854 resumed
</p>
<p>his practice, and continued to practice at the St. Louis bar
</p>
<p>until the commencement of the Rebellion. Judge Cooke was
</p>
<p>strongly pro-slavery in his views, and in connecting himself
</p>
<p>with the Rebellion was no doubt actuated by a sense of duty,
</p>
<p>for no man influenced by any other motive would leave a wife
</p>
<p>and interesting family of children, to embark in a cause which,
</p>
<p>to say the least, was extremely doubtful in its result.

<p>Judge Cooke was in several engagements, and, under fire,

<p>WILLIAM M. COOKE. 585
</p>
<p>cool, calm, and collected, not only evincing great bravery
</p>
<p>himself, but inspiring those around him with the same senti-
</p>
<p>ment. He became a member of the Confederate Congress,
</p>
<p>but it does not appear that he took a very active or promi-
</p>
<p>nent part in its proceedings. He was never again permitted
</p>
<p>to join his family, for he died in Richmond before the close
</p>
<p>of the war.
</p>
<p>That Judge Cooke was a well-read lawyer, and possessed a
</p>
<p>logical, analyzing mind, cannot be questioned by any one who
</p>
<p>knew him. It is true that he never entered the field of elo-
</p>
<p>quence to gather its flowers, but, what is of far more value, he
</p>
<p>addressed himself to the understanding of his hearers, and
</p>
<p>sought to influence them by reason rather than flowery dec-
</p>
<p>lamation. His style was purely conversational. Judge
</p>
<p>Cooke frequently wrote for the press, and many of his articles
</p>
<p>evinced a classical taste and a high order of mental training.

<p>Robert M. Stewart.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, who filled the office of governor of Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, was born in Truxton, Cortland County, New York,
</p>
<p>March 12, 18 15, and received an academic education. * At
</p>
<p>the age of seventeen he commenced teaching school, and
</p>
<p>continued to teach until he became of age. Before reach-
</p>
<p>ing his majority he moved to Kentucky, taught some there,
</p>
<p>and studied law at the same time.
</p>
<p>In 1837 he was admitted to the Kentucky bar, and com-
</p>
<p>menced the practice at Louisville.
</p>
<p>In 1839 ^^^ came to Missouri and settled at Bloomington,
</p>
<p>in Buchanan County, and shortly afterwards took up his
</p>
<p>residence in St. Joseph and formed a partnership with the
</p>
<p>late Judge Solomon Leonard, and, at a later period, with
</p>
<p>Laurence Archer.
</p>
<p>In 1845 ^^^ was elected as a delegate to the Constitutional
</p>
<p>Convention, and there obtained considerable reputation as a
</p>
<p>debater. It will be seen, by reference to the published pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of the Convention, that he took a very active part
</p>
<p>in its deliberations, and endeavored to inaugurate a general
</p>
<p>system of internal improvements. It will be recollected
</p>
<p>that a constitution was framed, and submitted for approval
</p>
<p>to the people, who, by a large majority, rejected it. It was
</p>
<p>submitted as a whole, and defeated by a combination of all
</p>
<p>who objected to any particular part of it.
</p>
<p>In 1846 he was elected to the State Senate, which posi-
</p>
<p>tion he held until 1857, when he was elected governor of
</p>
<p>the state, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of
</p>
<p>Governor Trusten Polk.

<p>In 1848 he was appointed register of the Land Office at
</p>
<p>Savannah, Andrew County, but soon resigned to take charge
</p>
<p>of the survey of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad, and be-
</p>
<p>came the legal adviser of the company. He also projected
</p>
<p>the St. Joseph & Denver Road and also the St. Louis & St.
</p>
<p>Joseph Railroad. Governor Stewart spent a winter in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington City, laboring for the interests of the Hannibal & St.
</p>
<p>Joseph Railroad, and by the most indefatigable labor and
</p>
<p>perseverance succeeded in obtaining from Congress a valu-
</p>
<p>able grant of public lands, which largely aided in the con-
</p>
<p>struction of the road.
</p>
<p>In politics Governor Stewart was a Democrat, and in his
</p>
<p>efforts in behalf of internal improvements had to encounter
</p>
<p>a strong opposition from his own party, particularly that por-
</p>
<p>tion which opposed the creation of a state debt.
</p>
<p>Without being an orator, he was a strong and vigorous
</p>
<p>speaker, and his powers of irony, invective, and ridicule were
</p>
<p>so great that few felt any inclination to encounter him. He
</p>
<p>had many trite and odd sayings which he frequently used,
</p>
<p>particularly when under the influence of artificial excitement,
</p>
<p>for the governor was not a strict follower of Father Matthew.
</p>
<p>When he wished to express his contempt for the mental ca-
</p>
<p>pacity of another he would often say, " He dont know Jiozv
</p>
<p>to keep a hotel."
</p>
<p>In 1 86 1 he was elected to the Constitutional Convention,
</p>
<p>and during one of the debates a member who was making
</p>
<p>a speech quoted as authority the name of some distinguished
</p>
<p>writer, when the governor, who was in a happy condition, rose
</p>
<p>and very gravely asked the speaker if the writer whose name
</p>
<p>he had invoked as authority knew hozv to keep a hotel. There
</p>
<p>was nothing particularly suggestive in the inquiry, but the
</p>
<p>cool manner and inimitable gravity with which the governor

</p>
<p>propounded the question broiigJit the house dozvn, to the great
</p>
<p>disgust of the speaker.
</p>
<p>The governor seemed to be impressed with the idea that
</p>
<p>when a man had attained that knowledge which would en-
</p>
<p>588 BENCH AND RAR OF MISSOURI.
</p>
<p>able liim to master the intricacies of hotel-keeping, he had
</p>
<p>reached the highest point of mental excellence.
</p>
<p>We have alluded to Governor Stewart's warm advocacy of
</p>
<p>a liberal system of internal improvements. While governor
</p>
<p>of the state he let no opportunity pass to impress upon the
</p>
<p>members of the General Assembly, and through them the
</p>
<p>people, the necessity of immediate action and liberal legis-
</p>
<p>lation.
</p>
<p>States, like individuals, are apt to go from one extreme to
</p>
<p>another, and thus it was with Missouri. When we were in
</p>
<p>the Legislature, in 1842-4-6, it was impossible to procure the
</p>
<p>smallest appropriation for any public work. The debt con-
</p>
<p>tracted b)^ the state of Illinois for canals and other improve-
</p>
<p>ments was held up as a warning to other Western states;
</p>
<p>and he who had the courage to vote for a few dollars to aid
</p>
<p>in the navigation of the Osage River was regarded as a
</p>
<p>doomed man. But a i^xN years elapsed, however, before we
</p>
<p>launched forth in the most reckless system, and, to maintain
</p>
<p>it, bonds of the state were issued bearing ten percent inter-
</p>
<p>est; and now the people are taxed beyond endurance to meet
</p>
<p>the interest on those bonds. But the. evil did not stop there
</p>
<p> counties, townships, and municipal corporations followed
</p>
<p>suit, until the public debt has become so large as to threaten
</p>
<p>repudiation and bankruptcy.
</p>
<p>When we left the county of Franklin the debt of the county
</p>
<p>did not exceed ;$5,ooo; now it is over $500,000, and the
</p>
<p>people have nothing to show for it but an old, dilapidated
</p>
<p>court-house, a jail that any old woman could break out
</p>
<p>of in an hour, and a few miles of worthless macadamized
</p>
<p>road. Two railroads, it is true, pass through the county, but
</p>
<p>the county did not contribute a dollar to the construction of
</p>
<p>either. The history of Franklin is but the history of half
</p>
<p>the counties in the state.

</p>
<p>thought, and with his thorough knowledge of men and fine
</p>
<p>discriminating powers, aided by a classical education, he
</p>
<p>could not otherwise than become a man of note. As a
</p>
<p>speaker he was fluent and logical, and if at times his Ian-

<p>ROBERT M. STEWART. 589
</p>
<p>guage was not so refined as to meet the requirements of a
</p>
<p>fastidious taste, it was nevertheless expressive and unequivo-
</p>
<p>cal. During the unfortunate and disastrous civil war he
</p>
<p>remained a steadfast friend of the Union, supporting Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln in all measures designed to maintain the laws and the
</p>
<p>unity of the government.
</p>
<p>He was elected a member of the Constitutional Convention
</p>
<p>of 1 86 1, took a very active part in the debates, and the pub-
</p>
<p>lished proceedings of that body contain a few of his
</p>
<p>speeches and reports which evince much ability.
</p>
<p>Governor Stewart, though born in a non-slaveholding
</p>
<p>state, was in no sense an Abolitionist. He had no prejudices
</p>
<p>on the subject, but regarded it from a utilitarian point of view.
</p>
<p>At the very outset of the war he predicted the overthrow of
</p>
<p>slavery as a necessary and inevitable consequence of the war.
</p>
<p>Had he been an inspired prophet he could not have predicted
</p>
<p>with greater certainty the result that followed.
</p>
<p>He was not only a fluent speaker, but a ready and vigor-
</p>
<p>ous writer. His report, in the Convention, from the Military
</p>
<p>Committee is a fine exposition of the relative positions of
</p>
<p>the Federal and state governments, and exhibits much scho-
</p>
<p>lastic accuracy and a thorough mental training ; and yet it is
</p>
<p>said he wrote rapidly and with great facility, and with but
</p>
<p>little preparation. He died several years ago. He was never

<p>married.
</p>
<p>Monroe Parsons
</p>
<p>Was a member of the Cole County bar, and born on May
</p>
<p>21, 1822, in Charlottesville, Albemarle County, Virginia, and
</p>
<p>moved with his father to Missouri in the spring of 1835.
</p>
<p>The family first settled in Cooper County, but soon after
</p>
<p>moved to Jefferson City. He was educated partly in Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia and partly in Missouri, and completed his studies in
</p>
<p>the college at St. Charles. He studied law in the office of
</p>
<p>J. W. Morrow, judge of the Cole Circuit, and was admitted to
</p>
<p>the bar in the spring of 1846. Soon afterwards the Mexican
</p>
<p>War broke out, and young Parsons raised a company and
</p>
<p>joined the regiment of General Doniphan, and proceeded to
</p>
<p>Santa Fc, in New Mexico, under General Kearney.
</p>
<p>The history of that expedition, with its battles and forced
</p>
<p>marches, is too well known to admit of repetition here, but
</p>
<p>it is sufficient to say that Captain Parsons' company rendered
</p>
<p>very efficient service, and he proved himself a gallant sol-
</p>
<p>dier. When the time for which they enlisted expired, and
</p>
<p>they reached New Orleans on their way home, they were so
</p>
<p>ragged that it was with the utmost difficulty they could hide
</p>
<p>their nakedness. They were paid off at New Orleans, which
</p>
<p>enabled them to throw away their rags and appear in a new
</p>
<p>garb ; and it is said that after the change took place they did
</p>
<p>not know each other until each gave his name.
</p>
<p>On reaching home Captain Parsons resumed his practice,
</p>
<p>and in 1856 was elected to represent Cole Count}' in the
</p>
<p>lower branch of the General Assembl}'. In 1858 he was
</p>
<p>elected to represent his district in the State Senate.
</p>
<p>Captain Parsons was one of the finest-looking men we ever
</p>
<p>saw. He was over six feet high, straight as an Indian, had
</p>
<p>a large frame and dark and piercing eyes. His head was
</p>
<p>large, his forehead wide and expansive, and his manner dig-

</p>
<p>nified and graceful. Few men, indeed, presented a finer
</p>
<p>MONROE PARSONS. 591
</p>
<p>appearance. He was gradually rising in the profession
</p>
<p>when the RebeUion broke out. He joined the Confederate
</p>
<p>army, and was appointed by Governor C. F. Jackson briga-
</p>
<p>dier-general of the Missouri volunteers, participated in most
</p>
<p>of the battles of Missouri and Arkansas, and, after the
</p>
<p>engagement at Helena, was promoted to the position of
</p>
<p>major-general.
</p>
<p>Upon the termination of the war he started, with others,
</p>
<p>for Mexico, with the intention, as supposed, of settling a
</p>
<p>colony in some part of the Mexican territory. He, with two
</p>
<p>or three others, got separated from the main body, and were
</p>
<p>massacred by Mexican banditti.
</p>
<p>The facts connected with the massacre of General Parsons
</p>
<p>and his companions are about these: After the Confederate
</p>
<p>surrender at Shreveport, Louisiana, in May, 1865, Parsons
</p>
<p>was permitted to keep his transportation, and with his per-
</p>
<p>sonal effects to cross the Rio Grande into Mexico. He
</p>
<p>entered the Mexican territory in July, crossing the border
</p>
<p>at Eagle Pass, and in company with the Hon. Aaron H.
</p>
<p>Conrow, a member of the Confederate Congress, Colonel A.
</p>
<p>M. Standwitch, his brother-in-law and adjutant-general, and
</p>
<p>his faithful servant known as " Dutch Bill," who had been
</p>
<p>his orderly from the commencement of the war, proceeded
</p>
<p>in the direction of Monterey. After reaching Monterey
</p>
<p>they fell in company with General John B. Clark, ex-mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the Confederate Senate, and General Sidney Jack-
</p>
<p>man and others of the Confederate army, and the entire
</p>
<p>party started for Camargo, intending to leave Mexico and
</p>
<p>return to the United States. On August 14, 1865, while
</p>
<p>between Carnargo and Monterey, they stopped at a water-
</p>
<p>tank near a small town called China, just beyond the San
</p>
<p>Juan River, and on the neutral ground between the French
</p>
<p>and Liberal forces. Here the party divided up, and encamped
</p>
<p>within reach of the tank  Clark and Jackman in one place

<p>and Parsons and his party in another.. It was their inten-
</p>
<p>tion to have encamped together, but one of Parsons' party,
</p>
<p>Colonel Williams, of Tennessee, was delayed by a lame horse,
</p>
<p>and Parsons waited for him, and went into camp before

</p>
<p>reaching Clark. Shortly after midnight Parsons and his
</p>
<p>party were attacked by Mexicans, and, after a severe fight,
</p>
<p>overpowered and butchered, and their bodies thrown into
</p>
<p>the chaparral or San Juan River. Their money and prop-
</p>
<p>erty were divided among their captors, and while the divi-
</p>
<p>sion was going on, Colonel Don Platon Sanchos, adjutant-
</p>
<p>general of the Liberal forces, rode up and claimed his share
</p>
<p>of the booty. Among other things he obtained General
</p>
<p>Parsons' watch, and afterwards boasted of having taken it
</p>
<p>from a Confederate general.
</p>
<p>Under the treaty of July 4, 1868, the Mexican govern-
</p>
<p>ment was compelled to pay $50,000 in gold for this outrage,
</p>
<p>and $100,000 additional to the families of those of his com-
</p>
<p>panions who were killed. Mrs. Standwitch, the widow of
</p>
<p>Colonel Standwitch, a most estimable lady and a sister of

<p>General Parsons, is now a resident of St. Louis, and has

<p>charge of the Blind Asylum.
</p>
<p>Henry Shurlds.
</p>
<p>Our relations with Judge Shurlds were of a most pleasant
</p>
<p>and agreeable character. We met him on frequent occa-
</p>
<p>sions in the social circle, and occasionally transacted busi-
</p>
<p>ness with him while he held the responsible position of
</p>
<p>cashier of the old State Bank of Missouri. His free and
</p>
<p>cordial manner secured him a host of personal friends, and
</p>
<p>his unflinching integrity gave him a passport to public con-
</p>
<p>fidence. Judge Shurlds was a native of the Old Dominion,
</p>
<p>and born in Gloucester County, November 21, 1796. He
</p>
<p>received a classical education at one of the colleges of his
</p>
<p>native state, and read law under that great and eloquent
</p>
<p>jurist, William Wirt, with whom he practiced for a brief
</p>
<p>period at Richmond.
</p>
<p>Few young men started out in life under more auspicious
</p>
<p>circumstances than Henry Shurlds, for, in addition to a
</p>
<p>naturally strong intellect, he had all the advantages that
</p>
<p>could accrue from a thorough education and the best legal
</p>
<p>preceptor in the old commonwealth. The learned profes-
</p>
<p>sions at that time, particularly in Virginia, were somewhat
</p>
<p>crowded, and young Shurlds determined to try his fortune
</p>
<p>in the West. In 1 819 he came to St. Louis, and after re-
</p>
<p>maining there about a year took up his residence in Potosi,
</p>
<p>Washington County, which was the center of a large mining
</p>
<p>district and the home of many of the most prominent men
</p>
<p>of the West, including Moses Austin, who held a large grant
</p>
<p>of land from the Spanish government, and was looked upon
</p>
<p>by the early settlers as a grandee. In addition to other at-
</p>
<p>tractions Potosi had a very refined society, which continued
</p>
<p>in after years within the personal knowledge of the author.
</p>
<p>Mr. Shurlds was not long at the bar, for upon the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion of the state government he was appointed judge of his
</p>
<p>circuit, then comprising the counties of Washington, Jeffer-

<p>son, St. Genevieve, and others. In 1822 he married Miss
</p>
<p>Jane Jameison Bush, an accompHshed lady of Potosi, by
</p>
<p>whom he had several children.
</p>
<p>The judiciary at that time were very poorly paid, and
</p>
<p>Judge Shurlds resigned to take the position of secretary of
</p>
<p>state, which was far more congenial to his tastes.
</p>
<p>At a session of the General Assembly commenced No-
</p>
<p>vember 19, 1832, Judge Shurlds was elected secretary of the
</p>
<p>Senate, and in February, 1833, was appointed by the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, auditor of
</p>
<p>public accounts, the duties of which he faithfully discharged
</p>
<p>until March, 1837, when he resigned to take the cashiership
</p>
<p>of the State Bank, which had just been organized by an act
</p>
<p>of the Legislature. There was a constitutional limitation
</p>
<p>against creating more than one bank, though this bank was
</p>
<p>empowered to establish branches not exceeding five in num-
</p>
<p>ber. Judge Shurlds held this office for about fifteen years
</p>
<p> in fact, until within a few months of his death  when ill
</p>
<p>health forced him to resign.
</p>
<p>The bank was chartered at a time when the country was
</p>
<p>suffering from a great financial crisis and a total want of
</p>
<p>public confidence, and when it required the utmost financial
</p>
<p>skill to conduct any moneyed institution with success. Judge
</p>
<p>Shurlds, however, proved equal to the occasion, and with
</p>
<p>the aid of a prudent and cautious directory the bank sailed
</p>
<p>clear of the rocks and quicksands which had proved so fatal
</p>
<p>to most of the banks of the country. As a financier Judge
</p>
<p>Shurlds had but few equals, and the confidence reposed in
</p>
<p>him by the business men of the country gave the bank a
</p>
<p>strength which otherwise it could not have enjoyed. The
</p>
<p>directors were selected from men who had carved out their
</p>
<p>own fortunes and been successful in life, and whose good
</p>
<p>sense confined the operations of the institution within the
</p>
<p>limits of its legitimate business. Such a polic}' could not

<p>otherwise than secure financial success, and the notes of the
</p>
<p>bank kept at par, and found their way into old stockings
</p>
<p>and hidden recesses, as furnishing the best depositories for
</p>
<p>unemployed capital.
</p>
<p>HENR V SHUR L DS. 595
</p>
<p>Judge Shurlds was a man of most pleasing address and
</p>
<p>winning manners, but it was within the sacred precincts of
</p>
<p>home he appeared most brilliant. Exceedingly domestic
</p>
<p>and simple in his habits, he was always happy in the midst
</p>
<p>of his family, who bestowed upon him the utmost affection.
</p>
<p>He died at his residence, just beyond the limits of St.
</p>
<p>Louis, August 2, 1852, at the age of fifty-six. He left a
</p>
<p>widow, one son, and five daughters to mourn his loss. Of
</p>
<p>his daughters, one married George W. Dent, Esq., now a
</p>
<p>resident of San Francisco ; a second became the wife of B.
</p>
<p>H. Batte, Esq., of St. Louis; a third one married W. D. W.
</p>
<p>Barnard, Esq., a well-known merchant of St. Louis  in fact,
</p>
<p>all of them married men of good standing and position. His
</p>
<p>son, Edward, died in 1865.
</p>
<p>Judge Shurlds was too domestic in his habits to desire
</p>
<p>public position, otherwise he might have secured almost any
</p>
<p>office within the gift of the people, for his personal popu-
</p>
<p>larity was unbounded and his acquaintance coextensive
</p>
<p>with the state. He was not a brilliant lawyer, but well
</p>
<p>grounded in the principles of his profession and a safe and

<p>APPENDIX
</p>
<p>We here append some very interesting letters, which have
</p>
<p>never before been pubhshed (with the exception of the
</p>
<p>cipher letter from Burr to Wilkinson). They are not only
</p>
<p>interesting because of their antiquity and the prominence of
</p>
<p>the writers, but for the reason that they refer to several of
</p>
<p>the most eventful periods in American history; and, in order
</p>
<p>to give the reader an idea of the style in which these letters
</p>
<p>were written, we insert them verbatim, following the capitali-
</p>
<p>zation and punctuation.
</p>
<p>The first is a joint letter from Generals Washington and
</p>
<p>Putnam to a church in Woodstock, Connecticut, of which
</p>
<p>the Rev. Abiel Leonard, grandfather of the late Abiel
</p>
<p>Leonard, of Missouri, was pastor, and the object of the letter
</p>
<p>was to obtain the consent of the church to their pastor join-
</p>
<p>ing the army and fighting for his country. Having pre-
</p>
<p>viously refused their consent, the patriotic and belligerent
</p>
<p>pastor quietly visited the camp of Washington, at Cam-
</p>
<p>bridge, and there found the Father of his Country and " Old
</p>
<p>Put," as they called him, poring over some ancient maps
</p>
<p>and charts, and, making known to them the object of his
</p>
<p>visit, procured the letter written March 24, 1776  over a
</p>
<p>century ago. It is as follows :
</p>
<p>" To the Church and Congregation at Woodstock.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Leonard is a man whose exemplary life and conversation, must make
</p>
<p>him highly esteemed by every person, who has the pleasure of being acquainted
</p>
<p>with him. The Congregation of Woodstock know him well, it therefore can be
</p>
<p>no surprise to us to hear that they will be loth to part with him. His usefullness
</p>
<p>in this army is great  he is employed in the glorious work of attending to the
</p>
<p>morals, of a brave people who are fighting for their Liberties, the Liberties of
</p>
<p>the people of Woodstock, the Liberties of all America, We therefore hope,
</p>
<p>that knowing how nobly he is employed  the Congregation of Woodstock, will

<p>erties, is at an end, we have not the least doubt, but Mr. Leonard will with
</p>
<p>redoubled joy, be received in the open arms of a Congregation so very dear to
</p>

<p>Territory. He is one of the most agreeable, best informed, most genteel,

<p>LETTER FROM RUFUS EASTON TO GIDEON GRANGER, RELATING TO THE BURR
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>^'February 17, 180 j.
</p>
<p>" Sir : Was it not that I am convinced the President has been led into errors
</p>
<p>by the misrepresentations of those who are inimical to him, as well as the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment of the United States I should not have addressed him anticipating
</p>
<p>certain events, but conscious equally at this moment as heretofore that my state-
</p>
<p>ments have been correct, and from information received from different quarters
</p>
<p>of the Union, that the President can no longer doubt them, I beg leave to
</p>
<p>call his attention to several extracts from the communications made by me at
</p>
<p>an early period, to those of other gentlemen and to the particular circum-
</p>
<p>stances of the times. If the President will look at my communication of the
</p>
<p>17th January 1805, he will find the following, to wit,
</p>
<p>" ' It is believed by the best informed that the number of inhabitants at this
</p>
<p>day will exceed 12,000 souls, about two fifths of whom are from french extrac-
</p>
<p>tion, the others emigrants from the United States. The Creoles are in general
</p>
<p>peaceable, civil, & hospitable, possessing honest dispositions. They are
</p>
<p>good citizens but know nothing of the police of any government. They have
</p>
<p>no fixed political principles & are liable to sudden changes of opinion as
</p>
<p>they may be influenced by the more artful and designing. That they are in
</p>
<p>general enemies to the change of Government requires no argument to prove.
</p>
<p>When it was rumoured thro the country that a re-cession to Spain was about
</p>
<p>to take place joy gladdened in their breasts. This must not be taken however
</p>
<p>for a general sentiment, it is only that of the few who have feasted and fattened
</p>
<p>upon the labors of the more ignorant and industrious. Many have sufficient

</p>
<p>discernment to discover that the cession of the country advanced their prop-
</p>
<p>erty at least two hundred per cent  they thank tlie stars, and are willing to give
</p>
<p>the praise to whom it is due.'
</p>
<p>" In support of these observations I refer the President to a letter of Allan
</p>
<p>B. Magruder Esq printed in a Kentucky paper which is enclosed. It is no
</p>
<p>longer to be doubted that a traitorous project to divide the Union has for some
</p>
<p>time existed amongst some influential characters of the Union, & which is
</p>
<p>now attempted to be carried into effect. I was convinced of this project more
</p>
<p>than a year past ; and altho I had not the proof to substantiate to others
</p>
<p>600 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>my belief, I did not hesitate to write llie President as follows on the 20th
</p>
<p>Oct. 1805: 'That General WiJlcinson liad put himself at the head of a
</p>
<p>party of a few individuals who are hostile to the best interests of America;
</p>
<p>who do not possess the confidence of the great body of the people of this
</p>
<p>country, & who from being the leaders of the Fromentine faction have
</p>
<p>always been my enemies.'
</p>
<p>" He might have supposed me too warm & probably too severe upon Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Wilkinson. If so the circumstances of my belief will plead my excuse
</p>
<p>which was communicated to a gentleman high in the government, high in the
</p>
<p>confidence & affections of the President, & one who is warmly his friend,
</p>
<p>& that of the Government of the United States. It may be worthy of remark
</p>
<p>that during the session of Congress in 1803 I became acquainted with Col Burr,
</p>
<p>then Vice President, at the city of Washington  during that session I had
</p>
<p>written my friends who were of the Clinton party in New York, as will appear
</p>
<p>by their numerous testimonials in my favor, now with the President  the
</p>
<p>propriety of supporting Brockholst Livingston, or some other character then
</p>
<p>of the Republican party in preference to Mr. Lewis, being convinced that he
</p>
<p>was not calculated to govern the state, & they would find the necessity to
</p>
<p>desert him if elected. They persisted in the support of Mr. Lewis, & at the
</p>
<p>election in 1804 I threw my feeble support into the scale of Mr. Burr. The
</p>
<p>sequel terminated as was predicted. Mr. Clinton & most of his friends have
</p>
<p>ever since been at war with Mr. Lewis. And whilst propositions of a reunion
</p>
<p>between the Burr and Clinton interests were going on in New York during the
</p>
<p>last winter Mr. Easton was denounced at the City of Washington as a Burrite
</p>
<p>by characters who suppose that because a person ought to be independent, he
</p>
<p>has no right to act independent. Soon after my appointment as judge, Colonel
</p>
<p>Burr (though I believe he had no agency in procuring it) on the i8th March
</p>
<p>wrote me expressing the utmost pleasure at this event as well on my own ac-
</p>
<p>count as on that of several of his friends who were about to remove hither.
</p>
<p>He mentioned the Governor, General Wilkinson as having been long his inti-
</p>
<p>mate friend and Doctor Browne the secretary was his near relation. That I
</p>
<p>should be highly gratified by the acquaintance of these two gentlemen, and that
</p>
<p>he should take care to inspire them with a wish for my friendship and esteem.

</p>
<p>with General Wilkinson he wrote me again in substance as follows :
</p>
<p>" 'That before leaving Washington he transmitted me a few lines the prin-
</p>
<p>cipal object of which was to promote a friendship and mutual confidence be-
</p>
<p>tween me and Governor Wilkinson. That he had this object so much at heart,
</p>
<p>& deemed it so important to me that he took the liberty again to repeat and
</p>
<p>urge it. The Governor, he said, was a man of high sense of honor, of deli-
</p>
<p>cate feelings ; and warm sentiments  a frank ingenuous deportment on my part
</p>
<p>could not fail to attach him. That the Governor was disposed to be useful to
</p>
<p>me and would have it greatly in his power. That he had prepared the way for
</p>
<p>me by exciting prepossessions in my favor which I must foster. That the
</p>
<p>Governor was intimately informed of the vieivs of the Executive, & that I need
</p>
<p>not be told that my standing with the Administration would depend on the zeal
</p>
<p>and ability with which I should promote those views. That he hoped to see

</p>
<p>me at Saint Louis in August or September when it would afford him the highest
</p>
<p>gratification to find me not only in harmony but in confidence & friendship
</p>
<p>with the Governor, and at all times, and at all places assured me of the great
</p>
<p>respect & regard with which he was my friend ' &c &c.
</p>
<p>"Colonel Burr arrived at Saint Louis about the 17th of September whilst I
</p>
<p>was at Kaskaskia, & was accompanied by General Wilkinson and Mr.
</p>
<p>Delaunay of this place, since made Adjutant General of the Territory to the
</p>
<p>District of St. Charles. I returned to Saint Louis during their absence : upon
</p>
<p>their return Col Burr made me a visit. My answer to a question which he
</p>
<p>asked I have reason to believe broke off all further communication between us.
</p>
<p>He was afterwards closeted with Governor Wilkinson one or two nights till
</p>
<p>very late.
</p>
<p>" Lnmediately after the departure of Colonel Burr, General Wilkinson broke
</p>
<p>out upon me in the form & manner with which you already have been
</p>
<p>informed.
</p>
<p>" The part I have always taken illy fitted me for their vieivs  which views
</p>
<p>they constantly proclaimed as the views of the Executive of the United States,
</p>
<p>which declarations were not generally disbelieved in the western country until

<p>LETTER FROM GIDEON GRANGER TO RUFUS EASTON.
</p>
<p>" Washington City, Ap?-il gth i8oj.
</p>
<p>" Rufus Easton Esqr.
</p>
<p>" Sir : A conversation happened yesterday respecting you, between the Sec-
</p>
<p>retary at War and myself. In the course of it I was told, that Government had
</p>
<p>certain information by Major Bruff of your possessing full knowledge of the
</p>
<p>plans and designs of Col Burr and his associates, from the avowal of Burr,
</p>
<p>which you offered to communicate to Bruff, if he would pledge himself to
</p>
<p>secrecy, which he declined. This was the first idea I ever had of your possess-
</p>
<p>ing any other foundation for the suspicions you have suggested than what arose
</p>

</p>
<p>from the character of the persons, and general appearances which were alike
</p>
<p>in the power of all persons of equal observation and reflection.
</p>
<p>" I confess I was really astonished, because altho I presume you received the
</p>
<p>information under injunctions of secrecy, altho I well know the great impro-
</p>
<p>priety of communicating almost any thing given in confidence, and the extreme
</p>
<p>delicacy under any circumstances  yet I do think that when the proposed act
</p>
<p>is of a treasonable nature, tending to destroy the Government of the country,
</p>
<p>or to involve it in foreign or domestic war  whereby the nation will be made
</p>
<p>miserable, and the lives of thousands lost, or even where murder, robbery,
</p>
<p>arson, or the like, is contemplated; it is the duty of the person to whom the
</p>
<p>information is given, to communicate in the one case to the Government to pre-
</p>
<p>602 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>vent tlie evil ; in ihe other to the citizen, to save him from ruin, the knowledge
</p>
<p>he possesses. Do not sountl morals recjuire this? Does not the law of the
</p>
<p>country demand it ? What is the doctrine respecting accessaries? Have you
</p>
<p>a right to lock in your breast a secret, which kept, destroys, divulged saves the
</p>
<p>nation ? Have you a right to allow the murderer or Robber to go forth prowl-
</p>
<p>ing for his innocent prey, and dealing out death and destruction? And is this
</p>
<p>right founded on the single circumstance that he has thought projjcr to divulge
</p>
<p>in confidence his concerted schemes of iniquity ? Would you allow a man to
</p>
<p>take my life by poison because he had told you in confidence that he designed
</p>
<p>it ? No  you would not, and would you go further to save me than the uation ?
</p>
<p>'' Hut there is another consideration which removes the squeamishness of what
</p>
<p>is (improperly) called lumor. When a friend offers to confide a secret to a man
</p>
<p>of honor who is his friend  the man of honor has a right (if he is not bound)
</p>
<p>to believe that the secret is of such a nature that he may keep it consistent with
</p>
<p>the duty he owes to the country. He fnay therefore pledge himself with ]iro-
</p>
<p>priety.
</p>
<p>" The pledge cannot be considered as an assent to do wrong, or omit a moral
</p>
<p>duty of the first importance to society. If the communicant states any thing,
</p>
<p>which consistent with duty, must be disclosed, it is at his peril  the act is
</p>
<p>his  it cannot be considered as included in the promise of secrecy. Indeed
</p>
<p>when correctly considered it is an offence to the person and an attack on the
</p>
<p>character of the Depositary.
</p>
<p>"You know I do not mean to extend this doctrine to a case where a man
</p>
<p>basely worms himself into the confidence of another  gains his secrets, &
</p>
<p>then betrays him. The facts I have stated have made an impression here.
</p>
<p>" I believe you acted with upright intentions  but I must think you have mis-
</p>
<p>judged as to your duty.
</p>
<p>" I shall be happy in receiving such reply to this letter as you think ])roper on
</p>
<p>rejlection : and whatever that answer may be, it will be communicated to Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment.
</p>
<p>" Rest assured of my friendshij).

<p>" Gid'n Granger."
</p>
<p>To this Colonel Easton immediately replied, denying em-
</p>
<p>phatically the statement of Bruff, and reiterating that he had

</p>
<p>communicated to the government all the information he pos-
</p>
<p>sessed in regard to the conspiracy. The government became
</p>
<p>fully satisfied of this, for in due time Colonel Easton received

<p>to find that there never was any thing in your p07ver to communicate against

<p>raise a loud laugh at those miserable jockies who have bestrided the gallant
</p>
<p>steed of Kentucky, and attempted to ride him dragoon-like over our peace-
</p>
<p>able heads, but it shall not be the laugh of censure. It is of course charged
</p>
<p>on Mr C as an intended coalition.
</p>
<p>' Had he joined Jackson the charge would have lieen the same. The indis-
</p>
<p>cretion of some of the General's boys is working a silent conviction of the wis-
</p>
<p>dom of the choice. For these attaches are converted by the imagination into a
</p>
<p>gang of courtiers, surrounding a throne. Of all the unnatural coalitions (not
</p>
<p>to say most insincere) is that of our Senator Pomposo, of imperial port &
</p>
<p>mien, with the General! Now for a ride upon 'the second choice' of our
</p>
<p>State. Should the hobby not refuse the rider, it may be strong enough to
</p>
<p>carry him ; but a quere about the sincerity of the preference, will be indulged by
</p>
<p>a people considerate enough to make tiie revolution which Missouri has accom-
</p>
<p>plished within a few years.
</p>
<p>"The president, with the advice of his cabinet (except Adams) advised us to
</p>
<p>blockade Cuba in time of professed peace ! We refused 37 to 10  whether any
</p>
<p>were influenced by the correct dissent of the apparent Lord of the ascendent
</p>
<p>I know not. If we had done so it would have justified the Berlin & Milan de-
</p>
<p>crees & all countervailing measures of England, against which we have so
</p>
<p>loudly i^: so justly protested.

</p>
<p>" P. S. The President still suffers the offices of Aj Gen & Col 2d artillery to
</p>
<p>remain vacant, or filled by unconstitutional acting incumbents. This is mulish
</p>
<p>enough but not so magnanimous as Princes should be. Our recent anti-block-
</p>
<p>ading vote will at least show his Exc'y that we are not humbled below our
</p>
<p>duty, by the Autocratical attitude of our executive officer.

<p>David Barton was elected a United States senator from
</p>
<p>Missouri immediately after the organization of the state
</p>
<p>government, served four years, was reelected, and died
</p>
<p>before the expiration of his second term. He was a natural

<p>orator, and a man of transcendent ability. The following

<p>letter, written at Washington, and addressed to Colonel
</p>
<p>Easton, at St. Louis, is interesting by reason of its reference
</p>
<p>to the then recent election, in 1825, of Mr. Adams to the
</p>
<p>presidency, over General Jackson, by the Federal House of
</p>
<p>Representatives. John Scott, of St. Genevieve, the only
</p>
<p>representative from Missouri, cast the vote of his state for
</p>
<p>Mr. Adams. The letter also contains an allusion to the sup-
</p>
<p>posed coalition between Adams and Clay, which elicited
</p>
<p>from John Randolph, of Roanoke, on the floor of the House
</p>
<p>6o6 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>of Representatives, the allegation that it was a union of the
</p>
<p>Puritan and the Blackleg. This the reader will recollect
</p>
<p>caused the famous duel between Randolph and Clay :
</p>
<p>"Washington ib Feh^y 182^.
</p>
<p>" Dear Sir : You sec that Adams was elected President upon the first ballot.
</p>
<p>The attacks upon Mr. Clay for his final determination u[)on this matter have
</p>
<p>been very abortive.
</p>
<p>" They were intended as a grand effort to retrieve the fortunes of the day ;
</p>
<p>but they did not do it. Clay's motives, I believe, were conscientious and pa-
</p>
<p>triotic. He is n(jt to lie considered as leading, more than following his friends
</p>
<p>in the North West.
</p>
<p>"They claim one of the Heads of Department from the Western States, &
</p>
<p>there is no man so well qualified as Mr. Clay upon whom so many would unite ;
</p>
<p>and I expect the Department of State will be offered to. & accepted by him,
</p>
<p>not as his, but as their, claim. In all which I shall accpiiesce as a good (and
</p>
<p>moral) citizen should do.
</p>
<p>" The result would have been the same on subsequent balloting by the votes
</p>
<p>of the states favorable to Crawford; and I concurred with Scott in the belief
</p>
<p>that he ought to vote for A on the first ballot, & thereby decide the contest at
</p>
<p>once. For all which I expect the approbation of Missouri, if not of Tennessee.
</p>
<p>" We are now engaged on Col Johnson's bill to extend the circuit system to
</p>
<p>the Western States, and more especially to require a greater numlier of Judges
</p>
<p>to support the Const. U. S. against a Kentucky Statute, than against any other
</p>
<p>repugnant thing! I shall vote agt the whole project, because I believe the
</p>
<p>age, & extent of our Union, now require a separation of the courts of orig-
</p>
<p>inal and appellate jurisdiction ; & that the close of a short session is not the
</p>
<p>best time for the adoption of the proper system.
</p>
<p>"Very Respectfully Yours
</p>
<p>" David Barton.
</p>
<p>" P. S. Cod-fish have risen 25 per cent, and the City Ladies pronounce the
</p>
<p>name ' court fish ' since the 9th P'ebruary."
</p>
<p>The following letter from John C. Calhoun to Colonel
</p>
<p>Easton, written in 1825, is worthy of a place in this Ap-
</p>

</p>
<p>"Dear Sir: Enclosed you will fiml the receipt of Mr. Force. I am under
</p>
<p>great obligation to your kind expression of friendship.
</p>
<p>" It has ever been my constant object since the commencement of my public
</p>
<p>life to elevate our beloved country to the highest degree of prosperity, and to
</p>
<p>place her liberty on the most durable basis, and I am consoled with the belief

<p>from the favoralde opinion of my fellow citizens that my efforts have not been

<p>in vain.

</p>
<p>" I am certainly not insensil>le of the jniblic honors conferred on me, but if I
</p>
<p>know myself I place a mucli higher vahie on the consciousness of having faith-

<p>fully discharged my duty to the country.
