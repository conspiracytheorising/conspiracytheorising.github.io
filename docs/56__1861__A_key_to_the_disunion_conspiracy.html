<p>EXPLANATORY INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>THE reader will learn from the following pages that the fratricidal
</p>
<p>contest into which our country has been led is not a thing of chance,
</p>
<p>but of deliberate design, and that it has been gradually. preparing for
</p>
<p>almost thirty years. The dark plotters of South Carolina and Virginia, who in 1832 and 1833 were defeated in their nullification and
</p>
<p>disunion schemes by the fidelity and decision of Jackson, though
</p>
<p>abashed and discomfited, did not relinquish their purpose, notwithstanding they changed their plans. At first they resolved on organizing a direct resistance to the Federal authority throughout the South
</p>
<p>as soon as the "Southern heart" could be "fired" for that purpose;
</p>
<p>but, fearing a second reverse from the popularity of the Democratic
</p>
<p>party, they veered from a policy of open assault against that party and
</p>
<p>the Union, to one of sapping and mining both. Hence Mr. Calhoun
</p>
<p>and his secession allies, in 1837, joined the Democratic party, that from
</p>
<p>1833 to 1836 they had hated and denounced. By little and little the
</p>
<p>Secessionists, after having attained admission to its counsels, modified
</p>
<p>the policy of the party, continually changing it more and more in
</p>
<p>conformity with their own ideas. Thus it was in pursuit of aims, purely
</p>
<p>Southern and sectional, that the Mexican province of Texas was
</p>
<p>overrun and conquered by American adventurers in 1835 and 1836;
</p>
<p>that Texas was annexed in 1845; and that the war with Mexico was
</p>
<p>inaugurated. It was to subserve Southern, and eventually Disunion,
</p>
<p>purposes that the Missouri Compromise was repealed, and all the evil
</p>
<p>enginery of Lecomptonism put into operation. It was to further the
</p>
<p>accursed cause of national disruption that just such a Cabinet as that
</p>
<p>of Buchanan was gathered up, whereby the army might be dispersed,

</p>
<p>rupted-so that Secession might march unmolested over the prostrate
</p>
<p>form of our noble Government. The one purpose of disunion has
</p>
<p>been for the greater part of the time the animating principle of State
</p>
<p>rights' policy, since Calhoun and his adherents stealthily wormed
</p>
<p>themselves into the citadel of the Democracy. Even so apparently
</p>
<p>insignificant a matter as the repair and return of the English shit
</p>
<p>Resolute to the British Government, was undoubtedly due to the
</p>
<p>anxiety of the Southern Confederates to conciliate the good will
</p>
<p>of England, and secure for them her future alliance. The Secessionnists courted and used the Democratic party from 1837 to 1860, and
</p>
<p>in the latter year, at Charleston, having no further use for that organization, ruthlessly rent it asunder. Without dispute our country is
</p>
<p>suffering from the effects of a conspiracy unparalleled in its nature
</p>
<p>and extent in the history of mankind. In comparison with it the
</p>
<p>conspiracy of Catiline and Cethegus in ancient Rome fades into meanness and insignificance. The American conspiracy is now and may
</p>
<p>ever continue its own only parallel.
</p>
<p>In addition to the testimony furnished by the past history and present circumstances of the country, in proof of the above positions. there
</p>
<p>is happily a piece of irresistible evidence supplied us in the pages of a
</p>
<p>most remarkable work written and secretly printed in the years 1835
</p>
<p>and 1836, in which nearly every important point of the great conspiracy which is developing itself in our own immediate day, stands distinctly shadowed forth. Composed in the form of a novel, its twin
</p>
<p>object was to excite the South to rebellion, and to teach how to make
</p>
<p>that rebellion successful. It was " a tale of the future," and most
</p>
<p>wonderfully is that "future" fulfilling its predictions. Indeed, the
</p>
<p>Jeff. Davises, Yanceys, Pryors, Rhetts, Letchers, etc., seem to have
</p>
<p>done little else than servilely to follow out the programme sketched
</p>
<p>Tor them in this remarkable book. Its author, Professor BEVERLY
</p>
<p>TuCKER, of William and Mary College, Virginia, and but recently
</p>
<p>deceased, was one of the most trusted friends and devoted partisans
</p>
<p>of Mr. Calhoun, and had he lived till to-day, would have witnessed no
</p>
<p>feeble promise of the complete fulfilment of his own prophecies. Th6

</p>
<p>fidant, DUFF GREEN, then proprietor of the "Telegraph," published in
</p>
<p>Washington City. It was accordingly printed in Green's office on
</p>
<p>"Capitol Hill," but with a fictitious imprint, and a false date of twenty
</p>
<p>years in advance, because, as is known from the best living testimony,
</p>
<p>Green confessed the book to be "Treason." When the "Partisan
</p>
<p>Leader" was commenced in 1836, it was the intention of its author to
</p>
<p>make it a serial, to be issued at frequent intervals or until the whole
</p>
<p>South should have become impregnated with disunion. But only two
</p>
<p>parts were printed and distributed, because after the election of Mr.
</p>
<p>Van Buren in November 1836, the Secession leaders had resolved
</p>
<p>upon a change of programme from open opposition to the Democracy,
</p>
<p>to a close but treacherous connexion with it. This was effected under
</p>
<p>color of a great admiration for the sub-treasury feature in the JacksonVan Buren policy; at all events Mr. Calhoun and his friends thenceforward held foremost seats in the Democratic synagogue.
</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the revolution thus skilfully projected in the
</p>
<p>Partisan Leader is nowhere in the whole book sought to be justified
</p>
<p>on the grounds of alleged aggressions by the North in respect to slavery. Like the abettors of secession on the floors of Congress, Professor Tucker seems to have been unable to make out the semblance
</p>
<p>of a good case. After the merest allusion to the grounds fobr dissolution, he says in one of the pages of this book"If any farther account of the causes of the rebellion be required, X
</p>
<p>have none to give. It was through the eyes and hearts of the South
</p>
<p>that conviction entered. Outrage to the laws; outrage to the freedom
</p>
<p>of elections; outrage to one respected and beloved (Mr.' Calhoun), left
</p>
<p>nothing for reason to do."
</p>
<p>It was in the administration of General Jackson that the Partisan
</p>
<p>Leader found or made motives for the disruption of the Confederacy.
</p>
<p>Negro slavery had not then, nor has it now, any necessary connexion
</p>
<p>with that design.
</p>
<p>We close this introduction by appending a quotation from an editorial article in the National Intelligencer of January 25th, 1851, in which
</p>
<p>the editor, Mr. Gales, had alluded to the remarkable character of this

<p>" No one," said Mr. Gales, "who has been familiar with the topics
</p>
<p>and tone of the discussions in the South for the last two years but will
</p>
<p>at once recognise in this fiction-a fiction not at all more strange than
</p>
<p>the reality-the projected shadow of what has already come to pass.
</p>
<p>From that day to this these defeated' partisans' have spared no pains
</p>
<p>to make their story come true, by diffusing doubts and discontents into
</p>
<p>the quiet homes as well as the political circles of the South, with a view
</p>
<p>to bring about a revolution, which, had their ambition succeeded,
</p>
<p>would, in its consequences, have desolated those homes, broken up
</p>
<p>those abodes of peace and happiness, and devastated the country with
</p>
<p>the flames of a fierce, unsparing, and unrelenting civil war."
</p>
<p>Alas, that the revolution which Mr. Gales supposed to have been
</p>
<p>averted by the passage of the Compromise of 1850, should have been
</p>
<p>brought back upon the pathway of our country by the fatal repeal of
</p>

</p>
<p>TO THE PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA.
</p>
<p>THE part I bore in the transactions which form the
</p>
<p>subject of the following narrative, is my voucher for
</p>
<p>its authenticity. My admiration of the gallant people,
</p>
<p>whose struggle for freedom I witnessed and partook;
</p>
<p>the cherished friendships contracted among them, at a
</p>
<p>time of life when the heart is warm, and under circumstances which called all its best feelings into
</p>
<p>action; and, above all, the connexion then formed,
</p>
<p>which has identified me with Virginia, and which,
</p>
<p>during the last five years, has been the source of all
</p>
<p>my happiness; are my inducements to dedicate this
</p>
<p>work to you. The approbation which, in acknow
</p>
<p>ledging, more than rewarded my humble services, is
</p>
<p>my warrant for hoping, that this -tribute of grateful

</p>
<p>veneration will be favorably received.
</p>
<p>xiv
</p>
<p>Dedication.
</p>
<p>Among those whom Virginia, at this time, honors
</p>
<p>with high places in her councils, I see with pride,
</p>
<p>the names of many with whom I once stood, shoulder
</p>
<p>to shoulder, in the eye of danger. Of my regard for
</p>
<p>these, this is not the place to speak, for they are not
</p>
<p>thus to learn my sentiments concerning them. The
</p>
<p>record of their praise, and the reward of their glorious
</p>
<p>deeds, is on the page of history.
</p>
<p>But there are others who will die without their
</p>
<p>fame, and whose names will sink with them into the
</p>
<p>tomb, of whose unpretending devotion to their native
</p>
<p>country I am proud to testify, They belong to that
</p>
<p>class, peculiar to a society whose institutions are based
</p>
<p>on domestic slavery; the honest, brave, hardy, and
</p>
<p>high-spirited peasantry of Virginia. Among them, I
</p>
<p>saw examples of simple virtue and instinctive patriotism-; and from their lips I heard lessons of that untaught wisdom, which finds its place in minds
</p>
<p>uncorrupted by artificial systems of education, and
</p>
<p>undebased by abject and menial occupations. The
</p>
<p>names of Jacob Schwartz and Christian Witt deserve
</p>
<p>to live in history. But the narrative, in which I have
</p>
<p>endeavored to preserve them, will, in after times, be
</p>
<p>classed among romances. Such is the fate of all men,
</p>
<p>whose deeds shame the vaunted achievements of those

<p>Be it so. It is not the less my duty to testify of

</p>
<p>TOWARD the latter end of the month of October, 1849,
</p>
<p>about the hour of noon, a horseman was seen ascending a narrow valley at the eastern foot of the Blue
</p>
<p>Ridge. His road nearly followed the course of a small
</p>
<p>stream, which, issuing from a deep gorge of the mountain, winds its way between lofty hills, and terminates
</p>
<p>its brief and brawling course in one of the larger tributaries of the Dan. A glance of the eye took in the
</p>
<p>whole of the little settlement that lined its banks, and
</p>
<p>measured the resources of its inhabitants. The different tenements were so near to each other as to allow
</p>
<p>but a small patch of arable land to each. Of manufactures there was no appearance, save only a rude
</p>
<p>shed at the entrance of the valley, on the door of

<p>which the oft repeated brand of the horse-shoe gave
</p>
<p>token of a smithy. There too the rivulet, increased
</p>
<p>by the innumerable springs which afforded to every
</p>
<p>habitation the unappreciated, but inappreciable luxury
</p>
<p>of water, cold, clear, and sparkling, had gathered
</p>
<p>strength enough to turn a tiny mill. Of trade there
</p>
<p>could be none. The bleak and rugged barrier, which
</p>
<p>closed the scene on the west, and the narrow road,
</p>
<p>fading to a foot-path, gave assurance to the traveller
</p>
<p>that he had here reached the ne plus ultra of social
</p>
<p>life in that direction.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the appearance of discomfort and poverty
</p>
<p>in every dwelling well accorded with the scanty territory belonging to each. The walls and chimneys of
</p>
<p>unhewn logs, the roofs of loose boards laid on long
</p>
<p>rib-poles, that projected from the gables, and held
</p>
<p>down by similar poles placed above them, together
</p>
<p>with the smoked and sooty appearance of the whole,
</p>
<p>betokened an abundance of timber, but a dearth of
</p>
<p>everything else. Contiguous to each was a sort of
</p>
<p>rude garden, denominated, in the ruder language of
</p>
<p>the country, a C"truck-patch." Beyond this lay a
</p>
<p>small field, a part of which had produced a crop of
</p>
<p>oats, while on the remainder the Indian corn still
</p>
<p>hung on the stalk, waiting to be gathered. Add to
</p>
<p>this a small meadow, and the reader will have an
</p>
<p>outline equally descriptive of each of the little farms
</p>
<p>which, for the distance of three miles, bordered the
</p>
<p>stream.

</p>
<p>crowded population, a deep stillness pervaded it.
</p>
<p>The visible signs of life were few. Of sounds there
</p>
<p>were none. A solitary youngster, male or female,
</p>
<p>alone was seen loitering about every door. These,
</p>
<p>as the traveller passed along, would skulk from
</p>
<p>observation, and then steal out, and, mounting a
</p>
<p>fence, indulge their curiosity, at safe distances, by
</p>
<p>looking after him.
</p>
<p>At length he heard a sound of voices, and then a
</p>
<p>shrill whistle, and all was still. Immediately, some
</p>
<p>half a dozen men, leaping a fence, ranged themselves across the road and faced him. He observed
</p>
<p>that each, as he touched the ground, laid hold of a
</p>
<p>rifle that leaned against the enclosure, and this cir

<p>these formidable weapons, ranged along in the same

<p>position. The first impulse of the traveller was to
</p>
<p>draw a pistol; but seeing that the men, as they
</p>
<p>posted themselves, rested their guns upon the ground
</p>
<p>and leaned upon them, he quietly withdrew his
</p>
<p>hand from his holster. It was plain that no violence
</p>
<p>was intended, and that this movement was nothing
</p>
<p>but a measure of precaution, such as the unsettled
</p>
<p>condition of the country required. He therefore
</p>
<p>advanced steadily but slowly, and, on reaching the
</p>
<p>party, reined in his horse, and silently invited the
</p>
<p>intended parley.
</p>
<p>The men, though somewhat variously attired, were
</p>
<p>all chiefly clad in half-dressed buck-skin. They

<p>seemed to have been engaged in gathering corn in

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>the adjoining field. Their companions, who still
</p>
<p>continued the same occupation, seemed numerous
</p>
<p>enough (including women and boys, of both of which
</p>
<p>there was a full proportion,) to have secured the
</p>
<p>little crop in a few hours. Indeed, it would seem
</p>
<p>that the whole working population of the neighborhood, both male and female, was assembled there.
</p>
<p>As the traveller drew up his horse, one of the
</p>
<p>men, speaking in a low and quiet tone, said, "We
</p>
<p>want a word with you, stranger, before you go any
</p>
<p>farther."
</p>
<p>" As many as you please," replied the other, " for
</p>
<p>I am tired and hungry, and so is my horse; and I
</p>
<p>am glad to find some one, at last, of whom I may
</p>
<p>hope to purchase something for both of us to eat."
</p>
<p>" That you can have quite handy," said the countryman, "for we have been gathering corn, and
</p>
<p>were just going to our dinner. If you will only just'light, sir, one of the boys can feed your horse, and
</p>
<p>you can take such as we have got to give you."
</p>
<p>The invitation was accepted; the horse was taken
</p>
<p>in charge by a long-legge4 lad of fifteen, without hat
</p>
<p>or shoes; and the whole party crossed the fence
</p>
<p>together.
</p>
<p>At the moment, a man was seen advancing toward
</p>
<p>them, who, observing their approach, fell back a few
</p>
<p>steps, and threw himself on the ground at the foot
</p>
<p>of a large old apple-tree. Around this were clustered a motley group of men, women, and boys, who

<p>opened and made way for the stranger. He advanced,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>and, bowing gracefully, took off his forage cap, from
</p>
<p>beneath which a quantity of soft curling flaxen hair
</p>
<p>fell over his brow and cheeks. Every eye was now
</p>
<p>fixed on him, with an expression rather of interest
</p>
<p>than mere curiosity. Every countenance was serious
</p>
<p>and composed, and all wore an air of business, except that a slight titter was heard among the girls,
</p>
<p>who, hovering behind the backs of their mothers,
</p>
<p>peeped through the crowd, to get a look at the handsome stranger.
</p>
<p>He was indeed a handsome youth, about twenty
</p>
<p>years of age, whose fair complexion and regular
</p>
<p>features made him seem yet younger. He was tall,
</p>
<p>slightly, but elegantly formed, with a countenance in
</p>
<p>which softness and spirit were happily blended. His
</p>
<p>dress was plain and cheap, though not unfashionable.
</p>
<p>A short grey coat, waistcoat, and pantaloons, that
</p>
<p>neatly fitted and set off his handsome person, showed
</p>
<p>by the quality of the cloth that his means were limited;
</p>
<p>or that he had too much sense to waste, in foppery,.
</p>
<p>that which might be better expended in the service of
</p>
<p>his suffering country. But, even in this plain dress,
</p>
<p>he was apparelled like a king in comparison with the
</p>
<p>rustics that surrounded him; and his whole air would
</p>
<p>have passed him for a gentleman, in any dress and
</p>
<p>any company, where the constituents of that character
</p>
<p>are rightly understood.
</p>
<p>In the present assembly there seemed to be none,
</p>
<p>indeed, who could be supposed to have had much

<p>experience in that line. But dignity is felt, and
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leade
</p>
<p>courtesy appreciated by all, and the expression of
</p>
<p>frankness and truth is everywhere understood.
</p>
<p>As the youth approached, the man at the foot of the
</p>
<p>tree arose, and returned the salutation, which seemed
</p>
<p>unheeded by the rest. He advanced a step or two,
</p>
<p>and invited the stranger to be seated. This action,
</p>
<p>and the looks turned toward him by the others,
</p>
<p>showed that he was in authority of some sort among
</p>
<p>them. With him, therefore, our traveller concuded
</p>
<p>that the proposed conference was to be held. - There
</p>
<p>was nothing in his appearance which would have led
</p>
<p>a careless observer to assign him any pre-eminence.
</p>
<p>But a second glance might have discovered something
</p>
<p>intellectual in his countenance, with less of boorishness in his air and manner than the rest of the
</p>
<p>company displayed. In all, indeed, there was the
</p>
<p>negative courtesy of that quiet and serious demeanor
</p>
<p>which solemn occasions impart to the rudest and most
</p>
<p>frivolous. It was plain to see that they had a common purpose, and that neither ferocity nor rapacity
</p>
<p>entered into their feeling toward the newcomer,
</p>
<p>Whether he was to be treated as a friend or an
</p>
<p>enemy, obviously depended on some high consideration, not yet disclosed.
</p>
<p>He was at length asked whence he came, and
</p>
<p>answered from the neighborhood of Richmond.
</p>
<p>From which side of the rmver?- From the north
</p>
<p>side. Did he know anything of Van Courtlandt? 
</p>
<p>His camp was at Bacon's branch, just above the

</p>
<p>" I cannot say, certainly," he replied, " but com
</p>
<p>mon fame made his numbers about four thousand."
</p>
<p>" Is that all, on both sides of the river? " said his
</p>
<p>interrogator.
</p>
<p>" O, no! Col. Loyal's regiment is at Petersburg,
</p>
<p>and Col. Cole's at Manchester; each about five
</p>
<p>hundred strong; and there is a piquet on the Bridge
</p>
<p>island."
</p>
<p>"Did you cross there?"
</p>
<p>" I did not."
</p>
<p>" Where then?" he was asked.' I can hardly tell you," he replied, " it was at a
</p>
<p>private ford, several miles above Cartersville."
</p>
<p>" Was not that mightily out of the way? What
</p>
<p>made you come so far around?"
</p>
<p>" It was safer travelling on that side of the river."
</p>
<p>"Then the people on that side of the river are
</p>
<p>your friends?"
</p>
<p>" No. They are not. But, as they are all of a
</p>
<p>color there, they would let me pass, and ask no questions, as long as I travelled due west. On this side,
</p>
<p>if you are one man's friend, you are the next man's
</p>
<p>enemy; and I had no mind to answer questions."
</p>
<p>"You seem to answer them now mighty freely."
</p>
<p>"That is true. I am like a letter that tells all it
</p>
<p>knows as soon as it gets to the right hand; but it
</p>
<p>does not want to be opened before that."

</p>
<p>" And where are you a

<p>"Just at the foot of the Devil's Back-bone," re.
</p>
<p>plied the youth.
</p>
<p>" Were you ever here before? "
</p>
<p>"Never in my life."
</p>
<p>"How do you know then where you are? " asked
</p>
<p>the mountaineer.
</p>
<p>" Because the right way to avoid questions is to
</p>
<p>ask none. So I took care to know all about the
</p>
<p>road, and the country, and the place, before I left
</p>
<p>home."
</p>
<p>" And who told you all about it? "
</p>
<p>" Suppose I should tell you," answered the young
</p>
<p>man, " that Van Courtlandt had a map of the country made, and gave it to me."
</p>
<p>" I should say, you were a traitor to him, or a spy
</p>
<p>upon us," was the stern reply.
</p>
<p>At the same moment, a startled hum was heard
</p>
<p>from the crowd, and the press moved and swayed for
</p>
<p>an instant, as if a sort of spasm had pervaded the
</p>
<p>whole mass.
</p>
<p>" You are a good hand at questioning," said the
</p>
<p>youth, with a smile, " but, without asking a single
</p>
<p>question, I have found out all I wanted to know."
</p>
<p>"And what was that " asked the other.
</p>
<p>"Whether you were friends to the Yorkers and
</p>
<p>Yankees, or to poor old Virginia."
</p>
<p>"And which are we for " added the laconic
</p>
<p>mountaineer.

</p>
<p>"For OLD VIRGINIA FOR EVER," replied the youth,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>in a tone in which exultation rung through a deeper
</p>
<p>emotion, that half stifled his voice.
</p>
<p>It reached the hearts of his auditors, and was
</p>
<p>echoed in a shout that pealed along the mountain
</p>
<p>sides their proud war-cry of " OLD VIRGINIA FOR
</p>
<p>EVER." The leader looked around in silence, but
</p>
<p>with a countenance that spoke all that the voices of
</p>
<p>his comrades had uttered.
</p>
<p>" Quiet, boys," said he, " never shout till the war
</p>
<p>is ended-unless it be when you see the enemy."
</p>
<p>Then turning again to the traveller, he said, " And
</p>
<p>how did you know we were for old Virginia 2"
</p>
<p>" I knew it by the place where I find you. 1
</p>
<p>heard it in your voice; 1 saw it in their eyes; and I
</p>
<p>felt it in my heart;" said the young man, extending
</p>
<p>his hand.
</p>
<p>His inquisitor returned the cordial pressure with
</p>
<p>an iron grasp, strong, but not convulsive, and went
</p>
<p>on: "You are a sharp youth," said he, " and if you
</p>
<p>are of the right metal that will hold an edge, you
</p>
<p>will make somebody feel it. But I don't know
</p>
<p>rightly yet who that is to be, only just I will say,
</p>
<p>that if you are not ready to live and die by old Virginia, your heart and face are not of the same color,
</p>
<p>that's all."
</p>
<p>He then resumed his steady look and quiet tone,
</p>
<p>and added, "You must not make me forget what I
</p>
<p>am about. How did you learn the way here?"
</p>
<p>"I can answer that now;" said the youth. "I
</p>
<p>learned it from Captain Douglas."

<p>" Captain Douglas!" exclaimed the other. "Ii
</p>
<p>you were never here before, you have never seen
</p>
<p>him since he knew it himself."
</p>
<p>"True enough;" was the reply. " But I have
</p>
<p>heard from him."
</p>
<p>"I should like to see his letter."
</p>
<p>"I have no letter."
</p>
<p>" How then?"
</p>
<p>" Go with me to my horse, and I will show you."
</p>
<p>The youth, accompanied by his interrogator, now
</p>
<p>returned toward the fence. Many of the crowd
</p>
<p>were about to follow; but the chief (for such he
</p>
<p>seemed) waved them back with a silent motion of
</p>
<p>his hand, while a glance of meaning at two of the
</p>
<p>company invited them to proceed. As soon as the
</p>
<p>stranger reached his horse, he drew out, from
</p>
<p>between the padding and seat of his saddle, a paper
</p>
<p>closely folded. On opening this, it was found to be
</p>
<p>a map of his route from Richmond to a point in the
</p>
<p>mountains, a few miles west of the spot where they
</p>
<p>stood. On this were traced the roads and streams,
</p>
<p>with the names of a few places, written in a hand
</p>
<p>which was known to the leader of the mountaineers
</p>
<p>to be that of Captain Douglas. A red line marked
</p>
<p>the devious route the traveller had been directed to
</p>
<p>pursue.
</p>
<p>He said that, after crossing the river, between
</p>
<p>Lynchburg and Cartersville, to avoid the parties of
</p>
<p>the enemy stationed at both places, he had lain by,

</p>
<p>tarning south, and riding hard all night, he had
</p>
<p>crossed the Appomattox above Farmville, (which he
</p>
<p>avoided for a like reason,) and, before day, had left
</p>
<p>behind him all the hostile posts and scouting parties. He soon reached the Staunton river, and,
</p>
<p>having passed it, resumed his westward course in
</p>
<p>comparative safety.
</p>
<p>"You know this hand," said he to the chief,
</p>
<p>" and now, I suppose, you are satisfied."
</p>
<p>"I am satisfied," replied the other, " and glad to

<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>Heus I etiam Mensas consumimus.-VIRG-m.
</p>
<p>RETURNING to the party which they had left, they
</p>
<p>found the women in the act of placing their meal
</p>
<p>before them, under the apple-tree. There was a
</p>
<p>patch of grass there, but no shade; nor was any
</p>
<p>needed in that lofty region; the frost had already
</p>
<p>done its work by stripping the trees of their leaves,
</p>
<p>and letting in the welcome rays of the sun through
</p>
<p>the naked branches. The meal consisted of fresh
</p>
<p>pork and venison, roasted or broiled on the coals,
</p>
<p>which looked tempting enough, though served up
</p>
<p>in wooden trays. There were no knives but such
</p>
<p>as each hunter carries in his belt. Our traveller's
</p>
<p>dirk supplied the place of one to him. Their plates
</p>
<p>were truly classical, consisting of cakes of Indian
</p>
<p>corn, baked in the ashes, so that, like the soldiers of
</p>
<p>Atfneas, each man ate up his platter before his hunger was appeased.
</p>
<p>Our traveller, though sharp-set, could not help
</p>
<p>perceiving a woful insipidity in his food, for which
</p>
<p>his entertainer apologized.'' We ha'nt got no salt

<p>to give you, stranger," said he. " The little that's

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>made on the waters of Holston is all used there;
</p>
<p>and what comes by way of the soundfis too dear for
</p>
<p>the like of us, that fight one half the year, and work
</p>
<p>the other half, and then with our rifles in our hands.
</p>
<p>As long as we let the Yankees hold Jaines river, we
</p>
<p>must make utp our minds to eat our hogs when they
</p>
<p>are fat, and to do without salt to our bread. But it
</p>
<p>is not worth grumbling about; and bread7 without
</p>
<p>salt is more than men deserve that will give up their
</p>
<p>country without fighting for it."
</p>
<p>When the meal was finished, our traveller, expressing a due sense of the courtesy of his entertainers,
</p>
<p>asked what was to pay, and proposed to continue his
</p>
<p>journey.
</p>
<p>" As to what you are to pay, my friend," said the
</p>
<p>spokesman of the party, in the same cold, quiet tone,
</p>
<p>"that is just nothing. If you come here by Captain
</p>
<p>Douglas's invitation, you are one of us; and if you
</p>
<p>do not, we are bound to find you as long as we keep
</p>
<p>you. But, as to your going just yet, it is quite
</p>
<p>against our rules."
</p>
<p>"How is that?" asked the traveller, with some
</p>
<p>expression of impatience.
</p>
<p>"That is what I cannot tell you," replied the other.
</p>
<p>"But what right," exclaimed the youth-then
</p>
<p>checking himself, he added: "But I see you mean
</p>
<p>nothing but what is right and prudent; and you must
</p>
<p>take your own way to find out all you wish to know
</p>
<p>about me. But I thought you said you did not

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>"No more I do," replied the other; " but that is
</p>
<p>not the thing. May be, our rules are not satisfied,
</p>
<p>though I am."
</p>
<p>"And what are your rules?"
</p>
<p>"It is against rule to tell them," said the mountaineer, dryly. " But make yourself easy, stranger.
</p>
<p>We mean you no harm, and I will see and have
</p>
<p>every thing laid straight before sun-rise. You are
</p>
<p>heartily welcome. Such as we've got we give you;
</p>
<p>and that is better than you will find where you are
</p>
<p>going. For our parts, except it be for salt, we are
</p>
<p>about as well off here as common; because there is
</p>
<p>little else we use that comes from foreign parts. I
</p>
<p>dare say, it will go hard with you for a while, sir;
</p>
<p>but, if your heart's right, you will not mind it, and
</p>
<p>you will soon get used to it."
</p>
<p>" It would be a great shame," said the youth, " if I
</p>
<p>cannot bear for a while what you have borne for life."
</p>
<p>"Yes," said the other, "that is the way people
</p>
<p>talk. But (axing your pardon, sir,) there an't no
</p>
<p>sense in it. Because the longer a man bears a thing,
</p>
<p>the less he minds it; and after a while, it an't no
</p>
<p>hardship at all. And that's the way with the poor
</p>
<p>negroes that the Yankees pretend to be so sorry for,
</p>
<p>and tried to get them to rise against their masters.
</p>
<p>There's few of them, stranger, but what's happier
</p>
<p>than I am; but I should be mighty unhappy, if you
</p>
<p>were to catch me now, in my old days, and make a

</p>
<p>us both to what we are not fit for. And so it will be
</p>
<p>with you for a while, among these mountains, sleep
</p>
<p>ing on the ground, and eating your meat without salt,
</p>
<p>or bread either, may be. But after a while you will
</p>
<p>not mind it. But as to whether it is to be long or
</p>
<p>short, young man, you must not think about that.
</p>
<p>You have no business here, if you have not made up
</p>
<p>your mind to stand the like of that for life; and may
</p>
<p>be that not so mighty long neither."
</p>
<p>At this moment a signal from the road gave notice
</p>
<p>of the approach of a traveller; and the leader of the
</p>
<p>mountaineers, accompanied by his guest, went forward in obedience to it. But, before he reached the
</p>
<p>fence, he saw several of the party leap it, and run
</p>
<p>eagerly forward to meet the new-comer. A little man
</p>
<p>now appeared, walking slowly and wearily, whose
</p>
<p>dress differed but little from that of the natives; and
</p>
<p>who bore, like them, a rifle, with its proper accompaniments of knife, tomahawk, and powder-horn. His
</p>
<p>arrival awakened a tumult of joy among the younger
</p>
<p>persons present, while he whom I have designated as
</p>
<p>the chief stood still, looking toward him with a countenance in which an expression of thoughtful interest
</p>
<p>was mingled with a sort of quiet satisfaction, and great
</p>
<p>kindness and good will. Yet he moved but a step to
</p>
<p>meet him, and extending his hand, said, in his usual
</p>
<p>cold tone, "How is it, Schwartz?" to which the
</p>
<p>other, in a voice somewhat more cheery, replied
</p>
<p>"Well; how is it with you, Witt?" "Well," was

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>The two now drew apart to converse privately to.
</p>
<p>getler. Crossing the road, they seated themselves on
</p>
<p>the fence in front of the stranger, so that during their
</p>
<p>conference they could keep an eye on him.
</p>
<p>" Who is this you have got here?" asked Schwartz.
</p>
<p>"A young fellow that says he wants to go to the
</p>
<p>camp," replied the other.
</p>
<p>"Has he got the word and signs?"
</p>
<p>"_No. He does not know any thing about it. I
</p>
<p>have a notion he is a friend of the captain's."
</p>
<p>"What makes you think so?"
</p>
<p>" He has got a paper in the captain's hand-write to
</p>
<p>show him the way. But there's no name to it; and
</p>
<p>if there was, I could not tell that he was the man.
</p>
<p>Sure and certain the captain wrote the paper, but then
</p>
<p>somebody may have stolen it. A man that knows as
</p>
<p>much about the country as he does, after looking at
</p>
<p>that paper and travelling by it away here, is the last
</p>
<p>man we ought to let go any farther, or know any
</p>
<p>more, unless he is of the right sort."
</p>
<p>" I should like to see that paper;" said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>"Here it is," replied his companion. I"I don't
</p>
<p>much mistrust the young fellow; but I did not like
</p>
<p>to let him have it again till I knew more."
</p>
<p>Schwartz now looked at the paper and inquired the
</p>
<p>stranger's name.
</p>
<p>" I did not ask his name," said Witt, "because
</p>
<p>he could just tell me what name he pleased. As
</p>
<p>there was no name on the paper, it did not make

<p>any odds. Besides, I wanted to be civil to him,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>and your high gentlemen down about Richmond
</p>
<p>are affronted sometimes if you ask their names.
</p>
<p>The young fellow is all right, or all wrong, any
</p>
<p>how; and his name don't make any odds. If the
</p>
<p>captain knows him, when he sees him, it's all one
</p>
<p>what his name is."
</p>
<p>"But I know," said Schwartz, "who ought tc
</p>
<p>have that paper; and if he don't answer to that
</p>
<p>name it's no use troubling the captain with him."
</p>
<p>"I should be sorry for any harm to him," said
</p>
<p>Witt, " for he is a smart lad; and if he is not a true
</p>
<p>Virginian, then he is the greatest hypocrite that
</p>
<p>ever was born."
</p>
<p>They now recrossed the road, and Schwartz,
</p>
<p>addressing the stranger, said, " I must make so bold,
</p>
<p>young man, as to ask your name."
</p>
<p>The young fellow colored, and, turning to Witt,
</p>
<p>said, "I thought you were satisfied, and done asking
</p>
<p>questions."
</p>
<p>" So I was," said Witt, " but there is a reason for
</p>
<p>asking your name now, that I did not know of. I
</p>
<p>owe you nothing but good will, young man," added
</p>
<p>he with earnest solicitude; "and if your name is
</p>
<p>what I hope it is, be sure by all mean-s and tell the
</p>
<p>truth; for there is but one name in the world tlat
</p>
<p>will save your neck."'Then I shall tell you no name at all," rejoined
</p>
<p>the youth, somewhat appalled at this startling
</p>
<p>intimation. " Why did not you ask me at once,

</p>
<p>you. I was willing to answer any civil question,
</p>
<p>or indeed any question you would have put to me,
</p>
<p>but I will not submit to be examined, over and
</p>
<p>over, by every chance-comer."
</p>
<p>"There's where you are wrong, young man,"
</p>
<p>replied Witt. "This is no chance-comer. He is
</p>
<p>my head man, and I am just nobody when he is
</p>
<p>here."
</p>
<p>Surprised at this ascription of authority to the
</p>
<p>diminutive and mean-looking new-comer, our traveller looked at him again, and was confirmed in a
</p>
<p>resolution to resist it. He had patiently borne to
</p>
<p>be questioned by Witt, who had something of an
</p>
<p>air of dignity. He was a tall, clean-limbed, and
</p>
<p>powerful man, of about forty, remarkable for the
</p>
<p>sobriety of his demeanor, and the thoughtful gravity
</p>
<p>of his countenance. The other was a little, old
</p>
<p>fellow, not less than sixty years of age, in whose
</p>
<p>manner and carriage there was nothing to supply
</p>
<p>the want of dignity in his diminutive form and
</p>
<p>features. A sharp little black eye was the only
</p>
<p>point about him to attract attention; and in that
</p>
<p>the youth thought he saw an impertinent and knowing twinkle, which rendered his inquiries yet more
</p>
<p>offensive.
</p>
<p>" I thought," said he to Witt, "that Captain
</p>
<p>Douglas was your captain."
</p>
<p>"So he is," was his reply. "That is, he commands
</p>
<p>all here. But that is only so long as we choose. I

<p>because, if you are the man that ought to have that

<p>paper, you would tell your name in a minute."
</p>
<p>"Do you know who ought to have it " asked the
</p>
<p>youth.
</p>
<p>"May be I do," said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>"Question for question," said the other. "Do you
</p>
<p>know?"
</p>
<p>"I do."
</p>
<p>"Well, then, my name is Arthur Trevor. Is that
</p>
<p>right?"
</p>
<p>" That's as it may be," said Schwartz. "But now
</p>
<p>I want to know how you came by this paper."
</p>
<p>" What need you care about that, if I am the person that ought to have it."
</p>
<p>"Just because I want to know if you are the one
</p>
<p>that ought t( have it."
</p>
<p>" I tell you," replied the youth, "that my name is
</p>
<p>Arthur Trevor."
</p>
<p>"But I do not know that it is," replied Schwartz,
</p>
<p>carelessly.
</p>
<p>"Do you doubt my word, then?" exclaimed the
</p>
<p>youth; his eye flashing, and the blood rushing to his
</p>
<p>face, as if it would burst through his clear skin.
</p>
<p>" Look here, stranger," said Schwartz, in a tone of
</p>
<p>quiet expostulation; "I don't mean no offence, and
</p>
<p>you'll think so too, if you'll just look at it rightly;
</p>
<p>because, you see, I don't know who you are. I don't

</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>have but to do it, and it will set all as straight as if I
</p>
<p>had axed you ten thousand pardons."
</p>
<p>" But I have no means of showing it," said the
</p>
<p>young man, in some perplexity. "I took care to
</p>
<p>bring nothing with me to show who I am. The name
</p>
<p>of Trevor might have brought me into trouble in
</p>
<p>some parts of the country."
</p>
<p>"' That is true enough," replied Schwartz; "and
</p>
<p>so I asked you how you came by the paper, because
</p>
<p>I knew how Arthur Trevor should have come by it;
</p>
<p>and, if you got it that way, why then you are the
</p>
<p>very man."
</p>
<p>By this time the youth saw the folly of his anger,
</p>
<p>and answered, calmly, that he got it from a man he
</p>
<p>never saw before.
</p>
<p>" What sort of a man was-he?" asked Schwartz.
</p>
<p>"Nothing uncommon, except that he was lame."
</p>
<p>"Did he give you anything else at the same
</p>
<p>time? "
</p>
<p>1" Yes; he gave me this; " said the youth, producing a dirty piece of paper, on which were scrawled
</p>
<p>these words:
</p>
<p>" Sur. If you hay occashun to go of a jurney,
</p>
<p>carry this with you, bekase it mout be of sum sarvice

</p>
<p>" Well," said Schwartz, "that will do. You are
</p>
<p>Arthur Trevor, sure enough. And I reckon, Witt,
</p>
<p>you would have said so too, if you had seen this."

</p>
<p>may go on to my friend."
</p>
<p>"Not just yet," said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>"Why so?" asked the youth, again relapsing into
</p>
<p>petulance.
</p>
<p>" Just because you could not get there," was the
</p>
<p>answer.
</p>
<p>" Why not," said he, " after finding my way thus
</p>
<p>far?"
</p>
<p>"' For the same reason that you could not have got
</p>
<p>any farther if I had not come. You would meet
</p>
<p>with rougher customers than these between here and
</p>
<p>the camp. Come, come, my son. You must learn

<p>to take things easy. The captain has not got a bet.

<p>you did but know all. And, you see, you are going

<p>to a new trade; and I thought I would just give you
</p>
<p>a lesson. Now you may see, that, when you mean
</p>
<p>nothing but what is fair and honorable, (and you
</p>
<p>always know how that is,) the naked truth is your
</p>
<p>best friend; and then, the sooner it comes the better.

<p>I am pretty much of an old fox; and I reckon I have

</p>
<p>that, I hrave seen the day when the truth was better
</p>
<p>than the cunningest lie that ever was told. And then

<p>again, it an't no use to mind what a man says when

<p>is talking to, but just a stranger."

</p>
<p>I'll be off, and pilot Mr. Trevor through among the
</p>
<p>guards."
</p>
<p>" My horse is at your service, as you are tired," said
</p>
<p>Arthur, whose feelings toward his new acquaintance
</p>
<p>were now quite mollified.
</p>
<p>"I have had riding enough for one day," said
</p>
<p>Schwartz; "and was glad enough to get to where I
</p>
<p>could leave my horse. It an't much good a horse will
</p>
<p>do you, or me either, where we are going. By the
</p>
<p>time we climb to the top of the Devil's Backbone,
</p>
<p>you'll be more tired than me; and the horse will be
</p>
<p>worst off of any."
</p>
<p>He now told one of the boys to make ready Arthur's horse, and, snatching a hasty morsel, seized his
</p>
<p>rifle. "It will not do," said he, "to starve when a
</p>
<p>man is on fatigue, and it will not do to eat too much.
</p>
<p>And see here, Witt," added he, taking him apart, and
</p>
<p>speaking in a low tone, "if a long-legged, red-headed
</p>
<p>fellow comes along here, and tells you he is from Currituck, and seems to think he knows all the signs,
</p>
<p>never let him find out but what he does. Only just
</p>
<p>make an excuse to keep him a while, and send a runner on to me, that I may have time to get out of the

<p>CHAPTER III.

<p>Where things that own not man's dominion dwell,

<p>And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been.
</p>
<p>BYRON.
</p>
<p>THE travellers now moved off together, Arthur
</p>
<p>walking, and leading his horse. They soon reached
</p>
<p>a point where a sharp ridge, jutting like a buttress
</p>
<p>from the side of the mountain, came down abruptly
</p>
<p>to the very bank of the rivulet. Up this ridge, not
</p>
<p>unaptly called "the Devil's Back-bone," the path
</p>
<p>led. Leaning, as it were, against the mountain-its
</p>
<p>position, the narrow, ridgy edge along which the
</p>
<p>traveller clambered, and the rough nodules which
</p>
<p>interrupted the ascent, like the notches in a hen's
</p>
<p>ladder, gave it no small resemblance to this housewifely contrivance. The steep descent on either
</p>
<p>hand into deep dells, craggy and hirsute with stinted
</p>
<p>trees bristling from the sides, together with the
</p>
<p>similarity of these same nodules to the joints of the
</p>
<p>spine, had suggested a name strictly descriptive of
</p>
<p>the place. The ruggedness, steepness, and vast
</p>
<p>height of the ascent, would naturally provoke some

</p>
<p>again, a hundred to one it would receive the same
</p>
<p>name, and no other.
</p>
<p>At the summit of this narrow stair, the travellers
</p>
<p>stopped to take breath, and look back on the scene
</p>
<p>below. Arthur, who was at the romantic age when
</p>
<p>young men are taught to affect an enthusiasm for
</p>
<p>the beauties of nature, and to prate about hues and
</p>
<p>scents, and light and shade, and prospects in all the
</p>
<p>variety of the grand, the beautiful, and the picturesque, had been feasting his imagination with the
</p>
<p>thought of the glorious view to be seen from the
</p>
<p>pinnacle before him. Like an epicure about to
</p>
<p>feast on turtle, who will not taste a biscuit beforehand lest he should spoil his dinner, so our young
</p>
<p>traveller steadily kept his face toward the hill as
</p>
<p>aie ascended it. Even when he stopped to take
</p>
<p>breath, he was careful not to look behind. Schwartz,
</p>
<p>on the contrary, who was in advance, always faced
</p>
<p>about on such occasions, filling the pauses with
</p>
<p>conversation, and looking as if unconscious of the
</p>
<p>glorious scene over which his eye glanced unheeding. Arthur was vexed to see such indifference,
</p>
<p>and wondered whether this was the effect of use, or
</p>
<p>of the total absence of a faculty of which poets so
</p>
<p>much delight to speak.
</p>
<p>At length the summit was attained; and now the
</p>
<p>youth looked around in anticipated exultation. At
</p>
<p>first lie felt bound to admire, and, forgetting the
</p>
<p>unromantic character of his matter-of-fact companion, exclaimed: " Oh! how grand I how beautiful!"

</p>
<p>" For my part," said Schwartz, indifferently, "' I
</p>
<p>cannot say that I see any thing at all rightly, except
</p>
<p>it be the little branch down there, with its patches
</p>
<p>of meadow and corn-fields, and its smoky cabins.
</p>
<p>In the spring of the year, when you cannot see the
</p>
<p>cabins for the shaders, and the corn, and oats, and
</p>
<p>meadow is all of a color, it looks mightily like a
</p>
<p>little green snake. What it is like just now, I cannot
</p>
<p>say, as I never saw one of them snakes half-scaled,
</p>
<p>and with a parcel of warts on his back: but I have
</p>
<p>a notion he would look pretty much so. As to any
</p>
<p>thing else-there is something there, to be sure, but
</p>
<p>what it is, I am sartain I could never tell, if I did
</p>
<p>not know. And as to the distance I hear some
</p>
<p>folks talk about-why the farther you look, the less
</p>
<p>you see, that's all; until you get away yonder,
</p>
<p>t'other side of nowhere; and then you see just nothing at all."
</p>
<p>"But the vastness of the view!" said Arthur.

<p>"' The idea of immensity!"
</p>
<p>"As to that," replied Schwartz, " you have only
</p>
<p>just to look up, and you can look a heap farther,
</p>
<p>and still see nothing. All the difference is, you
</p>
<p>know it is nothing; and down there, you know there
</p>
<p>is something, and you cannot see what it is."
</p>
<p>"I am afraid your eyes are bad," said Arthur.
</p>
<p>"I cannot see as well as I could once," replied
</p>
<p>Schwartz; "but if there was anything to be seen

<p>down there, I should be right apt to see it. I have

<p>head of a nail in a target fifty yards off, and drive
</p>
<p>it with my rifle; and I don't think I saw any thing
</p>
<p>more then than I do now; and that is only just because there an't nothing there to see. egad 1 but
</p>
<p>there is, though! There's that chap a coming
</p>
<p>along; and I must see the Captain, and tell him all
</p>
<p>about it before he comes."
</p>
<p>" I see nobody," said Arthur.
</p>
<p>"That is because you don't look in the right
</p>
<p>place," replied Schwartz. " Look along the road."
</p>
<p>" I don't see the road, except just at the foot of
</p>
<p>the mountain."
</p>
<p>" Well! Look through the sights of my rifle.
</p>
<p>There! Don't you see a man on horseback?"
</p>
<p>" I see something Inoving," said Arthur; " but I
</p>
<p>cannot tell what it is."
</p>
<p>" Well," said Schwartz, " when he comes, you'll
</p>
<p>see it's a man riding on a white horse, and then, may
</p>
<p>be, you'll think if there was anything else there, I
</p>
<p>could see that too."
</p>
<p>He now sounded a small whistle, which hung by
</p>
<p>a leathern thong from his shoulder-belt. The signal
</p>
<p>was answered from the point of a projecting crag
</p>
<p>which jutted out from the face of the cliff, not more
</p>
<p>than fifty yards off. At the same moment, a man
</p>
<p>was seen to rise up from behind a rock, which had
</p>
<p>hitherto concealed him; though, from his look-out
</p>

<p>now approached and accosted Schwartz in a mannel
</p>
<p>28

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>which showed that he had already recognized him.
</p>
<p>Schwartz returned the salutation, and, pointing out
</p>
<p>the man on the white horse, said: " If that fellow
</p>
<p>slhould happen to get by without their seeing him, I
</p>
<p>want you just to fall in with him, like as if you was
</p>
<p>a hunting, and so go with him to the piquet. Never
</p>
<p>let on but he knows all the signs, and keep with
</p>
<p>him: and when you get him to the piquet, make
</p>
<p>him believe that is the camp, and that the Captain
</p>
<p>will be there after a while; and so keep him there
</p>
<p>till the Captain comes."
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>Having said this, he again turned his eye toward
</p>
<p>the object moving below, and gazed intently for a
</p>
<p>few minutes. Arthur, in the mean time, was left to
</p>
<p>admire the prospect, and soon began to suspect that
</p>
<p>Schwartz's ideas of the picturesque were not so far
</p>
<p>wrong. Indeed, there is nothing to admire from the
</p>
<p>spot, but the road that leads to it. From the foot of
</p>
<p>the mountain to the coast, there is an expanse of
</p>
<p>nearly three hundred miles, with no secondary ridges.
</p>
<p>As seen from that elevation, the whole is level to the
</p>
<p>eye, and presents one sheet of unbroken forest. Arthur
</p>
<p>found time to correct his preconceptions by the testimony of his own senses, while Schwartz continued to
</p>
<p>observe the movements of the distant traveller. At
</p>
<p>last he said: "That will do. They have stopped
</p>
<p>him; and he will not get away to-night."
</p>
<p>They now moved on quietly through a forest of
</p>
<p>lofty chestnuts, and along a path which wound its

</p>
<p>way among the scorched trunks of innumerable trees,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>prostrated by the fires that annually sweep through
</p>
<p>such uninhabited tracts. The soil seemed fertile,
</p>
<p>and abounding in luxuriant though coarse pasturage;
</p>
<p>and the high table-land of the mountain was more
</p>
<p>level than the peopled district below. Yet all was
</p>
<p>solitary and silent; nor was a vestige of habitation
</p>
<p>seen for miles. On inquiring the cause of this, Arthur
</p>
<p>was told that the country, at that elevation, was too
</p>
<p>cold to be inviting, as nothing would grow there but
</p>
<p>grass and oats, and that it was all shingled over with
</p>
<p>conflicting patents.
</p>
<p>"They that claim the land," said Schwartz, " will
</p>
<p>not go to law about it with one another; because
</p>
<p>they would have to survey it, and that would cost a
</p>
<p>mint of money; so they all club to keep it as a summer range for their stock. It belongs to some of
</p>
<p>them, and that is enough."
</p>
<p>He bad not long done speaking, when he suddenly
</p>
<p>stopped, and, raising his rifle, fired, and began quietly
</p>
<p>to load again.
</p>
<p>"What did you shoot at?" asked Arthur, looking
</p>
<p>in the direction of the shot.
</p>
<p>" A monstrous fine buck," replied Schwartz.
</p>
<p>"Where is he? I did not see him."
</p>
<p>"You did not look in the right place. He is down
</p>
<p>and kicking; and I always like to load my gun before
</p>
<p>I go up to them, because, you see, a deer, when he is
</p>
<p>wounded, is as dangerous as a painter."," A painter I" said Arthur. " What harm is there

</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>" O I" said Schwartz, laughing, " it an't no man at
</p>
<p>all. I don't just rightly know how you high larnt
</p>
<p>gentlemen call his name, but he is as ugly a varmint
</p>
<p>as you'd wish to see; most like a big cat. Sometimes
</p>
<p>the drotted Yankees gets hold of them and puts them
</p>
<p>in a cage; and then they call them tigers. Egad! I
</p>
<p>catched a young one once and sold him to one of
</p>
<p>these fellows; and the next time I seed him, he was
</p>
<p>carrying the creetur about with him for a show. And
</p>
<p>he did not remember me; and so I axed him what it
</p>
<p>was; and he said'twas an Effrican tiger right from
</p>
<p>Duck river I Lord! how the folks did laugh;'cause
</p>
<p>you see, sir, Duck river is just a little way down here
</p>
<p>in Tennessee, not over five hundred miles off; and
</p>
<p>Effrica, they tell me, is away t'other side of the herring-pond, where the negurs come from."
</p>
<p>By this time the rifle was loaded, and they advanced
</p>
<p>toward the fallen deer. They were quite near before
</p>
<p>Arthur discovered him; and, at the moment, the animal (a noble buck of ten branches) recovered himself
</p>
<p>so far as to regain his feet. He still staggered, but
</p>
<p>the sudden sight of his enemy seemed, at once, to
</p>
<p>stiffen his limbs with horror, and give them strength
</p>
<p>to support him. In an instant his formidable antlers
</p>
<p>were pointed; and, with eyes glaring and blood-shot,
</p>
<p>and his hair all turned the wrong way, he was in act
</p>
<p>to spring forward. At the instant, the report of the
</p>
<p>rifle was again heard, and, pitching on the points of
</p>
<p>his horns, he turned fairly heels over head, and lay

<p>with his legs in air, and quivering in death. Schwartz
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>now drew his knife across the animal's throat, and
</p>
<p>proceeded to disembowel him, when Arthur asked
</p>
<p>what he would do with the carcass.
</p>
<p>"I'll just hang him up in a sapling," said he, "'till
</p>
<p>I meet one of our men. There ought to be one close
</p>
<p>by, and I can send him for him. Where there's a
</p>
<p>hundred mouths to feed, such a buck as this is a cash
</p>
<p>article."
</p>
<p>At this moment, the snapping of a dry stick caught
</p>
<p>his ear; and, looking up, he saw a man approaching.
</p>
<p>"I don't know that fellow," said he, looking hard
</p>
<p>at him. "But it's all one. I can make him know
</p>
<p>me."
</p>
<p>The usual salutation now passed, and the stranger
</p>
<p>said: " If I may be so bold, stranger, I'd be glad to
</p>
<p>know what parts you are from?"
</p>
<p>"From Passamaquoddy," said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>"Can you tell me the price of skins down there
</p>
<p>away?"
</p>
<p>" Twenty-five cents and a quarter a pound," replied
</p>
<p>Schwartz.
</p>
<p>A few more simple questions and out-of-the-way
</p>
<p>answers were exchanged, when Schwartz, addressing
</p>
<p>the other, in an under tone, said: " You are one of
</p>
<p>the new recruits, I reckon?" The other nodded; and
</p>
<p>Schwartz went on to ask their number. Being told
</p>
<p>they were fifty, he said, gravely: "Now, there you
</p>
<p>are wrong. You are right enough to pass me, after
</p>
<p>I gave you the word; but that's no reason you

</p>
<p>should tell me anything. I just asked you, you see,
</p>
<p>32
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>to give you a'caution; cause a fellow might come
</p>
<p>along here that would give you the word as straight
</p>
<p>as any body, and be a spy all the time. So the
</p>
<p>right way would be, just to pass him and keep dark,
</p>
<p>that's the rule; and, by the time he'd find out how
</p>
<p>many men we've got, may be he'd find out something else he would not like quite so well. But
</p>
<p>come, let us take the deer up the road, and you can
</p>
<p>walk your post and watch it, till I can send somebody for it from the piquet."
</p>
<p>The sturdy mountaineer at once shouldered the
</p>
<p>animal; and, striding along to the road, threw him
</p>
<p>down, and quietly betook himself to eating the
</p>
<p>chestnuts that covered the ground. The traveller
</p>
<p>moved on, and presently came to the piquet.
</p>
<p>Here was a small party quartered in a rude and
</p>
<p>ruinous cabin, near which was an enclosure around
</p>
<p>a beautiful fountain, that welled up from a natural
</p>
<p>basin of stone. In this were confined twenty or
</p>
<p>thirty calves. A few horses were piqueted at hand,
</p>
<p>and the sides of the adjoining hills were covered
</p>
<p>with a numerous herd of fat cattle, browsing on the
</p>
<p>faded, but still succulent vegetation. The time was
</p>
<p>come when they should have been driven down for
</p>
<p>the winter, to the farms of their owners below, but
</p>
<p>they were left here that the men might have the use
</p>
<p>of their milk. Should the hunting at any time
</p>
<p>prove unsuccessful, there was always a beef at hand.

<p>Here Schwartz was known, and joyfully welcomed. He stopped only to tell of the deer, and
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>moved on. " You have a curious system here," said
</p>
<p>Arthur; " I see the people here know you, but how
</p>
<p>did you manage with that new recruit? I watched
</p>
<p>you, and I did not see you give him any sign, and
</p>
<p>he did not ask for a countersign."
</p>
<p>"That is all because you don't know what foolish
</p>
<p>answers I gave to his questions. You see, we ha'nt
</p>
<p>got no countersign rightly;'cause you see, when I
</p>
<p>stop a man, I want to know who he is, but I don't
</p>
<p>want to tell him anything about myself. But if I
</p>
<p>ax a man for the countersign, just so I might as well
</p>
<p>tell him I am on guard at once. So we've just got,
</p>
<p>may be, twenty simple questions; and when we ask
</p>
<p>them, our own folks know what answer to give, and
</p>
<p>the answer is sure to be one that nobody would give
</p>
<p>unless he was in the secret."
</p>
<p>"And pray how did you find out that I was
</p>
<p>Arthur Trevor?"
</p>
<p>"0! nothing easier, sir. That man that gave you
</p>
<p>the map was not no more lame than you. But I
</p>
<p>told him to be sure and not give it to nobody but
</p>
<p>you, and then to limp so as you'd be sure to notice
</p>
<p>it. You see, it was I that was to try fall in with
</p>
<p>you, and pilot you; but, after that, I got up another
</p>
<p>scheme. As to the other paper, that was to serve
</p>
<p>you with our folks, because there was a mark there
</p>
<p>you did not notice, that any of them would know;
</p>
<p>and then they would be middling sure you were the
</p>
<p>man you said you were. They would have been
</p>
<p>civil to you, and let you pass, but then they would

</p>
<p>have sent a man or two to the camp with you. And
</p>
<p>now, Mr. Trevor, here is something that I can see,
</p>
<p>and I have a notion it's worth looking at."
</p>
<p>While he was yet speaking, Arthur's ears had
</p>
<p>been saluted by a brawling sound, which he now
</p>
<p>recognized as the rush of water. Turning his head
</p>
<p>towards it, he perceived that it proceeded from a
</p>
<p>deep and shaggy dell, which the path was now
</p>
<p>approaching, and along the verge of which it presently wound. Here the plain broke sheer down
</p>
<p>into a gulph of vast depth, at the bottom of which
</p>
<p>a considerable stream was seen. It dashed rapidly
</p>
<p>along, pouring its sparkling waters over successive
</p>
<p>barriers of yellow rock, that sent up a golden gleam
</p>
<p>from beneath the crystal sheet that covered them.
</p>
<p>The mountain-pine, the fir, the kalmia, and numberless other evergreens, which nearly filled the gorge,
</p>
<p>afforded only occasional glimpses of the water;
</p>
<p>while they set off the picturesque appearance of so
</p>
<p>much as they permitted to be seen. As they advanced, they came to a part where the trees had
</p>
<p>been cut from the brow of the cliff; and, several of
</p>
<p>those below having been removed, a clearer view
</p>
<p>was afforded.
</p>
<p>Here, at the depth of two hundred feet, figures
</p>
<p>were seen moving to and fio, while, right opposite,
</p>
<p>under a beetling cliff, that screened them from
</p>
<p>above, were groups clustered around fires, kindled
</p>
<p>against the rock, behind a rude breast-work of logs.

<p>The whole breadth of the stream was here exposed
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>to view, apparently twenty or thirty yards wide.
</p>
<p>Though shallow, by reason of its rapidity it seemed
</p>
<p>to pour a vast volume of water.
</p>
<p>Standing on the brow of the cliff, Schwartz now
</p>
<p>uttered a shout, and immediately half a dozen men,
</p>
<p>seizing their rifles, moved up the glen, and were
</p>
<p>soon hidden under the bank on which the travellers
</p>
<p>stood. They now went on, and presently reached a
</p>
<p>point at which the path, turning short to the left,
</p>
<p>dived into the abyss, leading down a rugged ledge
</p>
<p>that sloped along the face of the cliff, in the direction opposite to that of their approach. It reached
</p>
<p>the very bottom, nearly under the point from which
</p>
<p>the shout of Schwartz had given notice of his presence. Here he stopped; and, requesting Arthur
</p>
<p>to wait a moment, he descended. He had not gone
</p>
<p>far before his name was repeated by a dozen voices,
</p>
<p>and immediately he was heard to say: " Yes, it is
</p>
<p>Schwartz; and I have a friend with me."
</p>
<p>" Bring him down," was the answer; upon which
</p>
<p>Schwartz, returning, requested Arthur to follow
</p>
<p>him, and mind his footing. Arthur obeyed, and
</p>
<p>descended, not without some appearance of danger,
</p>
<p>sometimes leaping and sometimes crawling, until he
</p>
<p>reached the group stationed at the foot of this rude
</p>
<p>stairway. Here let us leave him for a while, and

</p>
<p>ARTHUR TREVOR was the youngest son of a gentleman who resided in the neighborhood of Richmond.
</p>
<p>HIe was a man in affluent circumstances, and had long
</p>
<p>and honorably filled various important and dignified
</p>
<p>stations in the service of his native State. Endowed
</p>
<p>with handsome talents, an amiable disposition, and all
</p>
<p>the accomplishments that can adorn a gentleman, he
</p>
<p>added to these the most exemplary virtues. His
</p>
<p>influence in society had, of course, been great, and
</p>
<p>though now, at the age of seventy, withdrawn from
</p>
<p>public life, his opinions were inquired of, and his counsel sought, by all who had access to him. Through
</p>
<p>life he had been remarkable for firmness, and yet
</p>
<p>more for prudence. The steadiness of his principles
</p>
<p>could never be questioned, but, it was thought, he
</p>
<p>had sometimes deemed it wise to compromise, when
</p>
<p>men of less cautious temper would have found safety

</p>
<p>in prudent boldness.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>To this temperament had been attributed his conduct in regard to the politics of the last twenty years.
</p>
<p>Bred up in the school of State rights, and thoroughly
</p>
<p>imbued with its doctrines, he had, even before that time,
</p>
<p>been accustomed to look, with a jealous eye, on the progressive usurpations of the Federal Government. In the
</p>
<p>hope of arresting these, he had exerted more than his
</p>
<p>usual activity in aiding to put down the younger Adams,
</p>
<p>and to elevate his successor. Though no candidatefor
</p>
<p>the spoils of victory, no man rejoiced more sincerely in
</p>
<p>the result of that contest; and, until the emanation of the
</p>
<p>proclamation of December, 1832, he had given his hearty
</p>
<p>approbation, and steady, though quiet support, to the
</p>
<p>administration of Andrew Jackson.
</p>
<p>From that moment he seemed to look with fearful
</p>
<p>bodings on the affairs of his country. His disapprobation of that instrument was expressed with as
</p>
<p>much freedom and force as was consistent with his
</p>
<p>habitual reserve and moderation. He was, indeed,
</p>
<p>alarmed into a degree of excitement unusual with
</p>
<p>him, and might have gone farther than he did, had
</p>
<p>he not found that others were disposed to go, as he
</p>
<p>thought, too far. He had entirely disapproved the
</p>
<p>nullifying ordinance of South Carolina; and, though
</p>
<p>he recognized the right of secession, he deprecated
</p>
<p>all thought of resorting to that remedy. He was
</p>
<p>aware that many of his best friends, thinking that
</p>
<p>its necessity would be eventually felt by all, feared
</p>
<p>that that conviction might come too late. They

<p>remarked the steady tendency of Federal measures tc
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>weaken the malcontent States in the South, and to
</p>
<p>increase the resources of their northern oppressors
</p>
<p>and those of the General Government. Hence they
</p>
<p>feared, that whenever Virginia, or any other of the
</p>
<p>slave-holding States, should find itself driven to secession, the other party, in the confidence of superior
</p>
<p>strength, might be tempted forcibly to resist the exercise of the right. They thus arrived at the conclusion that separation (which they deemed inevitable)
</p>
<p>to be peaceable, must be prompt.
</p>
<p>These ideas had been laid before Mr. Trevor, and,
</p>
<p>in proportion to the urgency with which they were
</p>
<p>pressed, was his alarm and his disposition to adhere
</p>
<p>to the Union. He, at last, had brought himself to
</p>
<p>believe union, on any terms, better than disunion,
</p>
<p>under any circumstances. As the lesser evil, therefore, he determined to forget the proclamation, and,
</p>
<p>striving to reconcile himself to all the acts of the
</p>
<p>administration, he regarded every attempt to unite the
</p>
<p>South, in support of a southern president, as a prelude to the formation of a southern confederacy. By
</p>
<p>consequence, he became a partisan of Martin Van
</p>
<p>Buren; and united with Ritchie, and others of the
</p>
<p>same kidney, in endeavoring to subdue the spirit, and
</p>
<p>tame down the State pride of Virginia. These endeavors, aided by the lavish use of federal patronage in
</p>
<p>the State, were so far successful, that when, at the
</p>
<p>end of Van Buren's second term, he demanded a
</p>
<p>third election, she alone, in the South, supported his

<p>39
</p>
<p>By the steady employment of the same pernicious
</p>
<p>influences, the elections throughout the State had been
</p>
<p>so regulated, as to produce returns of a majority
</p>
<p>of members devoted to the views of the usurper
</p>
<p>This had continued until the spring of 1848, at which
</p>
<p>time the results of the elections were essentially the
</p>
<p>same which had taken place since the memorable
</p>
<p>1836; when Virginia, at one stroke of the pen,
</p>
<p>expunged her name from the chronicles of honor,

</p>
<p>It would have seemed as if the spirit of John Randolph had risen from the sleep of death, and walked
</p>
<p>abroad through the scenes where his youthful shout
</p>
<p>ders had received the mantle of his eloquence from
</p>
<p>the hand of Henry. For the first time, in twelve
</p>
<p>years, the vote of Virginia was recorded against the
</p>
<p>re-election of Martin Van Buren to the presidential
</p>
<p>throne.
</p>
<p>But not the less subservient were the proceedings
</p>
<p>of the Legislature elected for his use, the spring before. Yet enough had been done to justify tlie hope
</p>
<p>that the ancient spirit of old Virginia would yet
</p>
<p>show itself in the descendants of the men who had
</p>
<p>defied Cromwell, in the plenitude of his power, and
</p>
<p>had cast off the yoke of George the Third, without
</p>
<p>waiting for the co-operation of the other colonies.
</p>
<p>At the same time, the power and the will of a fixed
</p>
<p>majority in the North, to give a master to the South,
</p>
<p>had been made manifest. It was clearly seen, too,
</p>
<p>that he had determined to use the power thus obtained, and to administer the government solely
</p>
<p>with a view to the interest of that sectional faction,
</p>
<p>by which he had been supported. "lTw victis /"
</p>
<p>" Woe to the vanquished!" was the word. It had
</p>
<p>gone forth; and northern cupidity and northern
</p>
<p>fanaticism were seen to march, hand in hand, to the
</p>
<p>plunder and desolation of the South.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Southern States
</p>
<p>had been, at length, forced to see that the day for

<p>decisive action had arrived. They therefore deter

</p>
<p>mined no longer to abide the obligations of a con
</p>
<p>stitution, the form of which alone remained, and
</p>
<p>having, by a movement nearly simultaneous, seceded
</p>
<p>from the Union, they had immediately formed a
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy. The suddenness of these
</p>
<p>measures was less remarkable than the prudence with
</p>
<p>which they had been conducted. The two together
</p>
<p>left little doubt that there had been a preconcert
</p>
<p>among the leading men of the several States, arranging provisionally what should be done, whenever circumstances should throwpower into the hands of those
</p>
<p>whom, at the bidding of the usurper, the people had
</p>
<p>once driven from their councils. It is now known
</p>
<p>that there was such concert. Nor was it coflined to
</p>
<p>the seceding States alone. In Virginia, also, there
</p>
<p>were men who entered into the same views. But
</p>
<p>while the President believed that no decisive step
</p>
<p>would be taken by the more Southern States without her co-operation, he had devoted all his power,
</p>
<p>direct and indirect, to control and influence her elections. Of tumultuary insurrection he had no fear.
</p>
<p>The organized operation of the State Government
</p>
<p>was what he dreaded. By this alone could the mneasure of secession be effected; and this was effectually prevented by operating on the elections of
</p>
<p>members of the Legislature of Virginia. From the
</p>
<p>November vote on the Presidential election, less
</p>
<p>evil had been apprehended, and less pains had been

<p>taken to control it. In consequence of this, something more of the real sentiments of the people had
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>been allowed to appear on that occasion; and, from
</p>
<p>this manifestation, the more Southern States were
</p>
<p>encouraged to hope for the ultimate accession of'Virginia to their Confederacy. They had therefore
</p>
<p>determined to wait for her no longer, but to proceed
</p>
<p>to the execution of their plan, leaving her to follow.
</p>
<p>The disposition of the usurper, at first, was to treat
</p>
<p>them as revolted provinces; and to take measures
</p>
<p>for putting down, by force, their resistance to his
</p>
<p>authority. But circumstances, to be mentioned
</p>
<p>hereafter, made it impolitic to resort to this measure.
</p>
<p>But these did not operate to prevent him from using
</p>
<p>the most efficacious means to prevent Virginia from
</p>
<p>following their example. Though restrained from
</p>
<p>attacking them, nothing prevented him from affecting to fear an attack from them. This gave a pretext for raising troops; and the position of Virginia,
</p>
<p>as the frontier State, afforded an excuse for stationing them within her borders. Under these pretences,
</p>
<p>small corps were established in many of the disaffected counties. Should the presence of these be
</p>
<p>ineffectual to secure the return of delegates devoted
</p>
<p>to the crown, an ultimate security was taken against
</p>
<p>the action of the Legislature. Richmond, the seat
</p>
<p>of government, became the head-quarters of the army
</p>
<p>of observation, as it was called, and, surrounded by
</p>
<p>this, the mock deliberations of the General Assembly
</p>
<p>were to be held.

<p>CHAPTER V.

</p>
<p>HAMLET.
</p>
<p>AMONG those who had been most prompt to take
</p>
<p>this view of the subject, and most vehement in recommending it, was a younger brother of Mr. Trevor.
</p>
<p>In all, but the great essentials of moral worth, this
</p>
<p>gentleman was the very reverse of his brother. The
</p>
<p>difference was, perhaps, mainly attributable to the
</p>
<p>character of his intellect. Quick in conception, and
</p>
<p>clear in his views, he was strong in his convictions,
</p>
<p>and habitually satisfied with his conclusions. This,
</p>
<p>added to a hasty temper, gave him the appearance
</p>
<p>and character of a man rash, inconsiderate, and precipitate, always in advance of the progress of public
</p>
<p>opinion, and too impatient to wait for it. His ill
</p>
<p>success in life seemed to justify this construction.
</p>
<p>Though eminently gifted by nature, and possessing
</p>
<p>all the advantages of education, he had never occupied any of those stations in which distinction is to
</p>
<p>be gained. In his private affairs, he had been alike
</p>
<p>unprosperous. Though his habits were not expensive, his patrimony had been but little increased by

<p>his own exertions. He had married a lady of handsome property, but had added little to it. With only
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>two daughters, he had not the means of endowing
</p>
<p>them with more than a decent competency; while
</p>
<p>his elder brother, with a family of a dozen children,
</p>
<p>had educated the whole, and provided handsomely
</p>
<p>for such as had set out in life, and retained the wherewithal to give the rest nearly as much as the children
</p>
<p>of the younger could expect. In short, the career
</p>
<p>of Mr. Hugh Trevor had been one of uninterrupted
</p>
<p>prosperity. In all his undertakings he had been
</p>
<p>successful. Wealth had flowed into his coffers, and
</p>
<p>honors had been showered on his head. "When the
</p>
<p>eye saw him, then it blessed him." Men pointed
</p>
<p>him out to their children, and said to them: "Copy
</p>
<p>his example, and follow his steps."
</p>
<p>The life of Bernard, the younger brother, had been
</p>
<p>passed in comparative obscurity. Beloved by a few,
</p>
<p>but misunderstood by many, his existence was unknown to the multitude, and unheeded by most who
</p>
<p>were aware of it. They, indeed, who knew him
</p>
<p>well, saw in him qualities which, under discreet regulation, might have won for him distinction and
</p>
<p>affluence. None knew him better, and none saw this
</p>
<p>more clearly, than his elder brother. No man gave
</p>
<p>him more credit for talent and honor, or less for prudence and common sense. A habit of doubting the
</p>
<p>correctness of his opinions, and condemning his
</p>
<p>measures, had thus taken possession of the mind of
</p>
<p>Mr. Hugh Trevor: and, as the quick and intuitive

<p>Bernard was commonly the first to come to a conclusion, the knowledge of that created, in the other, a

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>predisposition to arrive at a different result. In proportion as the one was clear, so did the other doubt.
</p>
<p>When the former was ardent, the latter was always
</p>
<p>cold; and in all matters in which they had a common interest, the cautious foresight of Ilugh never
</p>
<p>failed to see a lion in the path which Bernard wished
</p>
<p>to pursue. They were the opposite poles of the same
</p>
<p>needle. The clear convictions of the latter on the
</p>
<p>subject of secession had shaken the faith of the former in his own, and had finally driven him to the conclusion already intimated, " that union, on any terms,
</p>
<p>was better than disunion, under any circumstances."
</p>
<p>The same habit of thinking had retarded the
</p>
<p>change, which the events of the last three years had
</p>
<p>been working in the mind of Mr. HIugh Trevor. His
</p>
<p>native candor and modesty made it easy for him to
</p>
<p>believe that he had been wrong, and, being convinced
</p>
<p>of error, to admit it. But a corollary from this admission would be, that the inconsiderate and imprhdent Bernard had, all the time, been right. Of the
</p>
<p>correctness of such an admission Mr. Trevor felt an
</p>
<p>habitual diffidence, that made him among the last
</p>
<p>to avow a change of opinion which, perhaps, commenced in no mind, sooner than in his. But the
</p>
<p>change was now complete, and it brought to the
</p>
<p>conscientious old gentleman a conviction that on
</p>
<p>him, above all men, it was incumbent to spare no
</p>
<p>means in his power to remove the mischiefs of which
</p>
<p>he felt his own supineness to have been in part the

</p>
<p>IIe was now a private man; but he had sons. To
</p>
<p>have given a direction to their political course, might
</p>
<p>not have been difficult. But, in the act of repenting
</p>
<p>an acknowledged error, how could he presume so far
</p>
<p>on his new convictions, as to endeavor to bind them
</p>
<p>on the minds of others? Was it even right to use
</p>
<p>any portion of his paternal influence for the purpose
</p>
<p>of giving to the future course of his children's lives
</p>
<p>such a tendency as might lead them into error, to
</p>
<p>the disappointment of their hopes, and perhaps to
</p>
<p>crime? The answer to these questions led to a determination to leave them to their own thoughts,
</p>
<p>guided by such lights as circumstances might throw
</p>
<p>upon these important subjects.
</p>
<p>It happened unfortunately, that, about the time
</p>
<p>of Mr. Van Buren's accession to the presidency, his
</p>
<p>eldest son had just reached the time of life when it
</p>
<p>is necessary to choose a profession. Without any
</p>
<p>particular purpose of devoting him to the army, he
</p>
<p>had been educated at West Point. The favor of
</p>
<p>President Jackson had offered this advantage, which,
</p>
<p>by the father of so large a family, was not to be
</p>
<p>declined. But the young man acquired a taste for
</p>
<p>military life, and there was no man in Virginia whom
</p>
<p>the new President was more desirous to bind to his
</p>
<p>service than Mr. Hugh Trevor; his wishes had been
</p>
<p>ascertained, and the ready advancement of his son
</p>
<p>was the consequence. The promotion of Owen Trevor

<p>had accordingly been hastened by all means consistent with the rules of the service. Even these were
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>sometimes violated in his favor. In one instance,
</p>
<p>he had been elevated over the head of a senior officer
</p>
<p>of acknowledged merit. The impatience of this gentleman, which had tempted him to offer his resignation, had been soothed by a staff appointment, accompanied by an understanding that he should not,
</p>
<p>unnecessarily, be placed under the immediate command of young Trevor. The latter, at the date of
</p>
<p>which we speak, had risen to the command of a regiment, which was now encamped in the neighborhood of Washington, in daily expectation of being
</p>
<p>ordered on active duty.
</p>
<p>Colonel Owen Trevor had received his first impressions, on political subjects, at a time when circumstances made his father anxious to establish in his
</p>
<p>mir,(l a conviction that union was the one thing needful. To the maintenance of this he had taught him
</p>
<p>to devote himself, and, overlookling his allegiance to his
</p>
<p>native State, to consider himself as the sworn soldier of
</p>
<p>tihe Federal Government. It was certainly not the wish
</p>
<p>of Mr. Trevor to teach his son to regard Virginia
</p>
<p>merely as a municipal division of a great consolidated
</p>
<p>empire. But while he taught him to act on precepts
</p>
<p>which seemed drawn from such premises, it was natural that the young man should adopt them.
</p>
<p>He did adopt them. He had learned to deride the
</p>
<p>idea of State sovereignty; and his long residence in
</p>
<p>the North had given him a disgust at all that is peculiar in the manners, habits, institutions, and character

</p>
<p>of Virginia. Among his boon companions he had
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>been accustomed to express these sentiments; and,
</p>
<p>being repeated at court, they had made him a favorite there. He had been treated by the President
</p>
<p>with distinguished attention. He seemed honored,
</p>
<p>too, with the personal friendship of that favorite son,
</p>
<p>whom he had elevated to the chief command of the
</p>
<p>army.- Iim he had consecrated to the purple; proposing to cast on him the mantle of his authority, so
</p>
<p>as to unite, in the person of his chosen successor, the
</p>
<p>whole military and civil power of the empire.
</p>
<p>It was impossible that a young man, like Col. Trevor, should fail to feel himself flattered by such notice.
</p>
<p>I-e had been thought, when a boy, to be warm-hearted
</p>
<p>and generous, and his devotion to his-patrons, which
</p>
<p>was unbounded, was placed to the account of gratitude by his friends. The President, on his part, was
</p>
<p>anxiously watching for an opportunity to reward
</p>
<p>this personal zeal, which is so strong a recommendation to the favor of the great. It was intimated to
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor that nothing was wanting to ensure him
</p>
<p>speedy promotion to the rank of brigadier, but some
</p>
<p>act of service which might be magnified, by a pensioned press, into a pretext for advancing him beyond
</p>
<p>his equals in rank. Apprised of this, he burned
</p>
<p>for active employment, and earnestly begged to lIe
</p>
<p>marched to thetheatre of war.
</p>
<p>This theatre was Virginia. But he had long since
</p>
<p>ceased to attribute any political personality to the
</p>
<p>State, and it was a matter of n6 consequence to him

<p>that the enemies, against whom he was to act, had.q

<p>50
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>been born or resided there. Personally they were
</p>
<p>strangers to him; and he only knew them as men
</p>
<p>denying the supremacy of the Federal Government,
</p>
<p>and hostile to the President and his intended successor (Van Buren).
</p>
<p>One person, indeed, he might possibly meet in arms,
</p>
<p>whom he would gladly avoid. His younger brother,
</p>
<p>Douglas Trevor, had been, like himself, educated at
</p>
<p>West Point, had entered the army, and served some
</p>
<p>years. Having spent a winter at home, it was suspected
</p>
<p>that he had become infected with the treasonable heresies
</p>
<p>of southern politicians. He had resigned his commission
</p>
<p>and travelled into South Carolina. The effect of this
</p>
<p>journey on his opinions was not a matter of doubt. Letters had been receivedfrom him, by his brother and several
</p>
<p>young officers of his own regiment, avowing a total change
</p>
<p>of sentiment. These letters left no doubt, that should Virginia declare for secession, or even in case of collision
</p>
<p>between the Southern League and the old United States,
</p>
<p>he would be found fighting against the latter. The
</p>
<p>avowal of such sentiments and purposes had so excited
</p>
<p>the displeasure of the Colonel, that he had cut short
</p>
<p>the correspondence by begging that he might never
</p>
<p>again be reminded that he was the brother of a traitor. His letter to this effect, being laid before the
</p>
<p>commander-in-chief, had given the most decisive proof
</p>
<p>of the zeal of one brother and the defection of the
</p>
<p>other.

</p>
<p>DIFFERENCE of political opinion had produced no
</p>
<p>estrangement between Mr. Hugh Trevor and his brother, though it had interrupted their intercourse by
</p>
<p>rendering it less agreeable. Men cannot take much
</p>
<p>pleasure in each other's society, when the subject on
</p>
<p>which both think and feel most deeply, is one on
</p>
<p>which they widely differ. They accordingly saw little

<p>of each other, though an occasional letter passed
</p>
<p>between them in token of unabated affection.

<p>a less fit subject for it than his elder brother. Though
</p>
<p>much the younger, he had a range, originality, and
</p>
<p>independence of thought, of which the other was
</p>
<p>incapable. Resting in the esteem of his friends and
</p>
<p>the approbation of his own conscience, the applause
</p>
<p>of the multitude, the flattery of sycophants, and the
</p>
<p>seducing attentions of superiors, had small charms for
</p>
<p>him. His heart had never ceased to glow at the name
</p>
<p>of Virginia, and he returned to her as the wanderer
</p>
<p>should return to the bosom of his home-to his
</p>
<p>friends-to his native land. In appearance, manners,
</p>
<p>and intelligence, he was much improved; in feeling,
</p>
<p>the same warm-hearted, generous, unsophisticated
</p>
<p>youth, as formerly.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, his cousin Delia had already
</p>
<p>reached his father's house, and was domesticated in
</p>
<p>the family. There she found the younger brothers
</p>
<p>and sisters of Douglas impatiently expecting his
</p>
<p>arrival; and so much occupied with the thought of
</p>
<p>him, that, had she been of a jealous disposition, she
</p>
<p>might have deemed her welcome somewhat careless.
</p>
<p>But she already knew her cousins, her uncle, and her
</p>
<p>aunt. This was not the first time that their house was
</p>
<p>her temporary home; and she had learned to consider
</p>
<p>herself as one of the family. As such, she was expected to enter into all their feelings. Douglas was
</p>
<p>their common favorite. During his long absence, his
</p>
<p>heart had never cooled toward them. In this he differed widely from Owen, in whom the pleasures of

</p>
<p>The contrast between him and Douglas, in this
</p>
<p>respect, rendered the latter yet more popular with the
</p>
<p>single-hearted beings who were impatiently waiting
</p>
<p>his return.
</p>
<p>" Do you remember brother Douglas?" said Vir.
</p>
<p>ginia Trevor (a girl one year younger than Delia).
</p>
<p>" Mamma says you were a great pet with him, when
</p>
<p>a child, and used to call him your Douglas."
</p>
<p>" I could not have been more than three years old
</p>
<p>at the time you speak of," said Delia; " but I have
</p>
<p>heard of it so often, that I seem to myself to remember him. But, of course, I do not remember him."
</p>
<p>" And, of course, he does not remember you,"
</p>
<p>said Mrs. Trevor. " At least he would not know
</p>
<p>you. But I doubt if he ever has forgotten you, as
</p>
<p>you were then. IIe was to be your husband, you
</p>
<p>know; and your father gave him a set of rules to
</p>
<p>walk by. He was to do so and so, and to be so and
</p>
<p>so; and Harry Sanford was to be his model. He said
</p>
<p>nothing about it; but'Sanford and Merton' was
</p>
<p>hardly ever out of his hands, and we could see that
</p>
<p>he was always trying to square his conduct by your
</p>
<p>father's maxims. I believe in my heart it made a
</p>
<p>difference in the boy; and that is the reason why he
</p>
<p>is less like his own father, and more like yours, than
</p>
<p>any of the rest of my boys."
</p>
<p>"I shall certainly love him, then," said Delia, her
</p>
<p>eyes filling as she spoke, " if he is like my dear old

</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>"Indeed, and you may," said Mrs. Trevor; " but,
</p>
<p>for all that, I would rather have him like his own
</p>
<p>father. But you must not be affronted, Delia; you
</p>
<p>know I claim the right to brag about my old man,
</p>
<p>and to set him up over everybody-even the President himself."
</p>
<p>" I never saw the President," said Delia, "but 1
</p>
<p>should be sorry to compare myfather with him."
</p>
<p>" I can assure you," replied the aunt, "there are
</p>
<p>very few men that would bear the comparison. Oh I
</p>
<p>he is the most, elegant, agreeable old gentleman, that
</p>
<p>ever I saw."
</p>
<p>" Except my uncle," said Delia, smiling.
</p>
<p>"Pshaw I Yes, to be sure. I always except
</p>
<p>him."
</p>
<p>" Iwill not except my father," said Delia, gravely.
</p>
<p>" I should not like to hear him and Martin Van
</p>
<p>Buren praised in the same breath."
</p>
<p>" Well, my dear," said the good-humored old
</p>
<p>lady, " we must not quarrel about it. But you must
</p>
<p>take care not to talk so before Douglas, because he is

</p>
<p>United States."
</p>
<p>"Well! and is not that all the same thing? I do
</p>
<p>not pretend to know anything about it, but my hus
</p>
<p>band says so, and that is enough for me."
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor, who had sat by the while, listening
</p>
<p>with grave complacency, now said: " I am afraid you

</p>
<p>his hand to Delia, he drew her gently to him, and
</p>
<p>placing her on his knee, kissed her. "You are a
</p>
<p>good girl," said he, " and. shall love and honor your
</p>
<p>father as much as- you please. He is a noble, gene.
</p>
<p>rous man, and a wise man too. I would to God,"
</p>
<p>added he, sighing heavily, "that I had had half his
</p>
<p>wisdom."
</p>
<p>"Why, bless my soul, Mr. Trevor I" exclaimed his
</p>
<p>wife, "what does this mean?"
</p>
<p>"N othing," replied he, "but a just compliment to
</p>
<p>the self-renouncing generosity and far-sighted sagacity
</p>
<p>of my brother."
</p>
<p>Saying this, he rose and left the room, while his
</p>
<p>wife gazed after him in amazement. She had never
</p>
<p>heard him say so much before, and now perceived
</p>
<p>that he had thoughts that she was not apprised of.
</p>
<p>Believing him faultless and incapable of error, even
</p>
<p>when he differed from himself, she at once concluded
</p>
<p>that she had lost her cue, and determined to say no
</p>
<p>more about politics until she recovered it. But he
</p>
<p>never adverted to the subject again, in her presence,
</p>
<p>during the whole winter; and her niece, consequently,
</p>
<p>heard no farther allusion to it from her.
</p>
<p>This was no unwelcome relief to Delia. She was
</p>
<p>no politician; but she was not incapable of understanding what passed in her presence on the subject,
</p>
<p>except when the interlocutors chose to mystify their
</p>
<p>meaning. Her father, a man of no reserves, never
</p>
<p>spoke but with a purpose of expressing his thoughts

</p>
<p>57
</p>
<p>express them than he. Though deficient, as I have
</p>
<p>said, in that cold prudence which takes advantage of
</p>
<p>circumstances, he was eminently gifted with that more
</p>
<p>vigorous faculty which makes them. In the piping
</p>
<p>times of peace, he was a man of no mark. But when
</p>
<p>society was breaking up from its foundations, he was
</p>
<p>the man with whom the timid and doubting would
</p>
<p>seek safety and counsel. Infirmity had now overtaken
</p>
<p>him, and he could do little more than think and speak.
</p>
<p>Consulted by all the bold spirits who sought to lift
</p>
<p>up, from the dust, the soiled and tattered banner of
</p>
<p>his native State' and spread it to the wind, he never
</p>
<p>failed to converse freely with such, and often in the
</p>
<p>presence of his daughters.
</p>
<p>By this means, if he had not imbued them with his
</p>
<p>opinions, or charged their minds with the arguments
</p>
<p>by which he was accustomed to support them, he had
</p>
<p>made them full partakers of his feelings. It seemed,
</p>
<p>indeed, as if he had a purpose in this. What that
</p>
<p>purpose was, time would show. One end, at least,
</p>
<p>it answered. It increased their opinion of his powers,
</p>
<p>their confidence in his wisdom, and their love for his
</p>
<p>person. Mrs. Hugh Trevor herself did not hold her
</p>
<p>husband's wisdom in more reverence than was
</p>
<p>cherished by Delia for that of her father.
</p>
<p>And never did man better deserve the confidinge
</p>
<p>affection of a daughter. He had been her principal
</p>
<p>instructor from infancy. He had formed her mind;
</p>
<p>he had trained her to self-command, and taught her

<p>to find her happiness in virtue. Educated at home,

<p>her manners were formed in a domestic circle cha
</p>
<p>racterized by refinement, and delicate, but frank propriety. Her love of reading had been cultivated by
</p>
<p>throwing books in her way; and, the taste once
</p>
<p>formed, her attention had been directed to such as
</p>
<p>might best qualify her for the duties of woman's only
</p>
<p>appropriate station. Herein she had an example in
</p>
<p>her mother; a lady of the old school, courteous and
</p>
<p>gentle, but high-spirited, generous, and full of her
</p>
<p>husband's enthusiasm in the cause of his country.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bernard Trevor was, indeed, a man to be loved
</p>
<p>passionately, if loved at all; and to shed the vivid
</p>
<p>hue of his mind- on those of his associates. It was
</p>
<p>the delight of his wife to witness, and to cherish, the
</p>
<p>dutiful affection and ardent admiration of her daughters for their father. The consequence was, that his
</p>
<p>power over their thoughts, feelings, and inclinations
</p>
<p>was unbounded.
</p>
<p>It will be readily believed, that, in the mind of
</p>
<p>Delia Trevor, thus pre-occupied, there was no room
</p>
<p>for any very favorable predispositions toward a young
</p>
<p>man, trained from his boyhood in the service of her
</p>
<p>country's oppressors. She had heard his mother
</p>
<p>speak of him as the sworn soldier of the arch-enemy
</p>
<p>of her beloved Virginia; and a sentiment of abhorrence arose in her mind at the words. But she reflected that he was her cousin; the son of her good
</p>
<p>uncle; the brother of her dearest friend; and, trying
</p>
<p>to remember his fondness for her when a child, she

</p>
<p>wicked. But, after all this discipline of her own
</p>
<p>mind, she found it impossible to think of him with
</p>
<p>complacency, or to anticipate his arrival with pleasure. Her imagination always painted him in the hateful dress, which she had been taught to regard as the
</p>
<p>badge of slavery-the livery of a tyrant. She would try
</p>
<p>to love him, as a kinsman, but she never could like him
</p>
<p>or respect him.
</p>
<p>At length he made his appearance, and, to her great
</p>
<p>relief, in the plain attire of a citizen. HIe was a
</p>
<p>handsome youth, whose native grace had been improved by his military education, and in his manners
</p>
<p>uniting the frankness of a boy with the polish and
</p>
<p>elegance of an accomplished gentleman. Whether
</p>
<p>he had been admonished by his father to respect the
</p>
<p>feelings of his fair cousin, or had caught his reserve,
</p>
<p>on the subject of politics, by contagion, she had no
</p>
<p>means of knowing. Certain it is, that, on that subject, he was uniformly silent, and Delia soon learned
</p>
<p>to converse with him on other topics, without dread.
</p>
<p>ing an allusion to that. She thus saw him as he was,
</p>
<p>and, by degrees, lost the prejudice which, for a time,
</p>
<p>blinded her to any merit he might possess.
</p>
<p>And he did possess great merit. A high sense of

<p>were united in him with talents of no common order.

<p>he frequently spoke with great veneration and affection. He remembered, as his mother had conjectured,
</p>
<p>many of his uncle's precepts. He frequently quoted
</p>
<p>them as of high authority with him; and it was plain
</p>
<p>to see, that, cherished during fourteen years, they had
</p>
<p>exercised a decided influence in the formation of his
</p>
<p>character. Indeed, it might be doubted whether his
</p>
<p>imagination had ever dismissed the idea, which had
</p>
<p>first disposed him to lend a willing ear to the suggestions of his uncle. That which was sport to the elder
</p>
<p>members of the family, had seemed to him, at the
</p>
<p>time, a serious business. The thought that the little
</p>
<p>girl, who loved to hang on his neck and kiss him,
</p>
<p>might one day be his wife, had certainly taken possession of his boyish mind. How long he had consciously retained it could not be known; but the
</p>
<p>traces of it were still there, and were certainly not
</p>
<p>obliterated by the change which time had wrought in
</p>
<p>his cousin.
</p>
<p>Of her personal appearance I have said nothing.

<p>Were I writing a novel, I should be bound, by all

<p>precedent, to give an exact account of Delia's whole

<p>exterior. Her person, her countenance, her hair, her

<p>eyes, her complexion, should all be described, and
</p>
<p>the whole summed up in a tout ensemble of surpassing

<p>beauty. But, in this true history, I am unfortunately
</p>
<p>bound down by facts, and I lament, that to the best

<p>of my recollection, I shall not have occasion to speak

<p>of a single female, in the progress of my narrative,

</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>do sincerely lament this; for such is the constitution
</p>
<p>of human nature, that female beauty influences the
</p>
<p>heart and mind of man, even by report. We read, in
</p>
<p>Oriental tales, of great princes deeply enamored of
</p>
<p>descriptions. The grey eyes of Queen Elizabeth have
</p>
<p>always made her unpopular with the youthful reader;
</p>
<p>and the beauty of Mary of Scotland, three hundred
</p>
<p>years after the worms have eaten her, still continues
</p>
<p>to gild her history and gloss over her crimes. I can
</p>
<p>say nothing so much in favor of the beauty of Delia
</p>
<p>Trevor, as that she was good and intelligent, reminding the reader of the sage adage of Mirs. Dorothy
</p>
<p>Primrose, to wit: " Handsome is, that handsome
</p>
<p>does.", I can only add, that, when I saw her afterwards hanging on the arm of Douglas, and looking
</p>
<p>up in his face with all the deep and heartfelt devotion
</p>
<p>of a woman's love, I saw enough of the constituents
</p>
<p>of beauty to make her an object of love, and enough
</p>
<p>of the soul of truth and tenderness to make her seem
</p>
<p>transcendently beautiful in the eyes of a lover.
</p>
<p>I say this, to account for the fact that her cousin
</p>
<p>Douglas soon found himself taking great pleasure in
</p>
<p>her society, and anxious to please her, not more from
</p>
<p>duty than inclination. He was, perhaps, chiefly at.

<p>tracted by her conversation, which was always cheer.

<p>call "blind contact," and the sage Mrs. Broadhurst

<p>"propinquity;" or it may have been that his hour
</p>
<p>was come. If one in ten of my married friends can

<p>tell exactly how he came to fall in love with his wife,

<p>I shall hold myself bound to inquire farther into this

<p>matter.

<p>New York, and Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and

<p>Washington, came home, and tumbled forthwith
</p>
<p>into love with a plain country girl, just because she

<p>was his cousin, and he had loved her when a child.
</p>
<p>I do not mean to say he was in love with her at all.

<p>He had a sincere affection for her; he liked her conversation; he admired her talents much, and her

<p>virtues more. He liked very much to be with her,

<p>DOUGLAs TREVOR reached his father's house just
</p>
<p>after the Virginia Legislature had assembled. The
</p>
<p>presidential election was just over, and the partisans
</p>
<p>of Van Buren, exulting in their success, made their
</p>
<p>leader the more hateful to his opponents by the insolence of their triumph. Though he had lost the
</p>
<p>vote of Virginia, it will be remembered that he still
</p>
<p>commanded a majority in the Legislature, elected
</p>
<p>before the revolution in public sentiment was complete. The more recent expression of public sentiment showed that the time was come when power
</p>
<p>must be held by means far different from those by
</p>
<p>which it had been acquired. Opinion, which at
</p>
<p>first had been in their favor, was now against them.Corruption had for a time supplied the place; but
</p>
<p>the fund of corruption was all insufficient to buy off

<p>the important interests which were now roused to

<p>operations, were the great objects which engaged
</p>
<p>the minds of the majority in the Virginia Legislature. But these, important as they were, could not
</p>
<p>entirely wean them from those indulgences which,
</p>
<p>for many years, had made Richmond, during the
</p>
<p>winter season, the scene of so much revel and
</p>
<p>debauchery. To these, as well as to personal intrigues and the great interests of the faction, much
</p>
<p>time was given. But the necessity of attending
</p>
<p>especially to the latter was made daily more apparent
</p>
<p>by the startling intelligence which every mail brought
</p>
<p>from the South and Southwest. The nearly simultaneous secession of the States in that quarter, and
</p>
<p>the measures to be taken for the formation of a
</p>
<p>southern confederacy, were things which had been
</p>
<p>talked of until they were no longer dreaded. But
</p>
<p>causes had gradually wrought their necessary effects,
</p>
<p>and the ultimate cooperation of Virginia, if left to
</p>
<p>act freely, was now sure.

<p>hearts, who, watching the progress of events, had

<p>clearly seen the point to which they tended. It is
</p>
<p>not here that their names and deeds are to be registered. They are already recorded in history, and
</p>
<p>blazoned on the tomb of that hateful tyranny which
</p>
<p>they overthrew. They had been discarded from the

</p>
<p>and the fierce assaults of rapacity and fanaticism,

<p>hounded on by ambition to the destruction of the
</p>
<p>South, had restored them [the'State-rights Jmen']
</p>
<p>to public favor. They had seen that secession must

<p>come, and that, come when it might, their influence
</p>
<p>would be proportioned to their past disgraces. Presuming on this, they had consulted much together.
</p>
<p>Not only had they sketched provisionally the plan
</p>
<p>of a southern confederacy, but they had taken
</p>
<p>measures to regulate their relations with foreign

<p>powers." One of their number, travelling abroad,
</p>
<p>had been instructed to prepare the way for the
</p>
<p>negotiation of a commercial treaty with Great
</p>
<p>Britain. One of the first acts of the new confederacy was to invest him publicly with the diplomatic
</p>

<p>South the full benefit of its natural advantages, and
</p>
<p>made it once more the most flourishing and prosperous country on earth; which has multiplied the
</p>
<p>manufactories of Great Britain, and increased her
</p>
<p>revenue by an increase of consumption and resources, even while some branches of revenue were
</p>
<p>cut off; and which, at the same time, has broken
</p>
<p>the power of her envious rival in the North, and put
</p>
<p>an end for ever to that artificial prosperity engendered by the oppression and plunder of the southern
</p>
<p>States; is such an anomaly in modern diplomacy,
</p>
<p>that the rulers at Richmond, or even at Washington,
</p>
<p>might well have been surprised at it. But the bare
</p>
<p>nomination of the plenipotentiary was enough to
</p>
<p>leave no doubt that a treaty was ready for promulgation, and that its terms must be such as to secure
</p>
<p>the co-operation of Great Britain.
</p>
<p>But, while the leaders of the ruling faction thought
</p>
<p>of these things, and anxiously consulted for the preservation of their power, there was still found among
</p>
<p>the members of the Legislature the ordinary proportion of men who think of nothing but the enjoyment
</p>
<p>of the present moment. Such men are often like

<p>sailors in a storm, who, becoming desperate, break

</p>
<p>The amusements, therefore, of the legislators
</p>
<p>assembled at Richmond suffered little interruption,
</p>
<p>and the dinner and the galas, the ball and the thea
</p>
<p>tre, and the, gaming-table, with revel, dissipation,
</p>
<p>and extravagance, consumed the time of the servants
</p>
<p>of the country, and swallowed up the wasted plunder
</p>
<p>of the treasury.
</p>
<p>Respected by all, beloved by individuals of both
</p>
<p>parties, and courted by that to which he was supposed to belong, Mr. Hugh Trevor was an object of
</p>
<p>the most flattering attention. His house was the
</p>
<p>favorite resort of such as enjoyed the envied privilege of the entree. His gallant and accomplished
</p>
<p>son was the glass before which aspirants for court
</p>
<p>favor dressed themselves. The budding youth of his
</p>
<p>daughter had, for years, been watched with impatient anticipation of the time when her hand might
</p>
<p>be seized as the passport to present wealth and
</p>
<p>future honor.
</p>
<p>Her cousin Delia was not recommended to notice
</p>
<p>by all these considerations; but the most prevailing
</p>
<p>of the whole was one that made her claims to atteat
</p>
<p>tion fully equal to those of Virginia. HIer father,
</p>
<p>though in comparatively humble circumstances,
</p>
<p>could give with his daughter a handsomer dowry
</p>
<p>than the elder and wealthier brother could afford
</p>
<p>with his. He was notorious for generosity, and his
</p>
<p>infirmities made it probable that he was not long
</p>
<p>for this world. Delia was therefore universally

</p>
<p>regarded as an heiress. Add to this, that in the
</p>
<p>68
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>affection of her uncle she seemed hardly to be post.poned to his own daughter, and it was obvious to
</p>
<p>anticipate that the same influence which had procured office and emolument for himself and his
</p>
<p>sons, would be readily exerted in favor of her future
</p>
<p>husband.
</p>
<p>It followed, that, whatever were the amusements
</p>
<p>of the, day, whether ball or theatre, or party of
</p>
<p>pleasure by land or by water, the presence of Delia
</p>
<p>and Virginia was eagerly sought. The latter, simple
</p>
<p>and artless, saw in all who approached her the
</p>
<p>fiiends of her father. If she thought at all of
</p>
<p>political differences, it was only to recognize in most
</p>
<p>of them the adherents of the man to whose fortunes
</p>
<p>he had so long attached himself, and in whose
</p>
<p>fortunes he had flourished. To all, her welcome
</p>
<p>was alike cordial and her smile always bright.
</p>
<p>With Delia, the case was far different. Much
</p>
<p>more conversant than her cousin with the politics of
</p>
<p>the day, she was aware that her father was obnoxious to many that she met. On some of those who
</p>
<p>sought her favor, she knew that he looked with
</p>
<p>detestation and scorn. To such she was as cold and
</p>
<p>repulsive as a real lady can ever permit herself to be
</p>
<p>to one who approaches her as a gentleman in genteel
</p>
<p>society. The height of the modern mode would,
</p>
<p>indeed, have countenanced in such cases that sort of
</p>
<p>negative insolence, the practice of which is regarded
</p>
<p>as the most decisive indication of high breeding.

</p>
<p>But she had been trained in a different school. She
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>69
</p>
<p>had been taught that, in society, self-respect is the
</p>
<p>first duty of woman; and that the only inviolable
</p>
<p>safeguard for that, is a care never to offend the selfrespect of others.
</p>
<p>Thus, while a part of those who approached her,
</p>
<p>were made to feel that their attentions were not
</p>
<p>acceptable, she never afforded them occasion to
</p>
<p>complain of any want of courtesy on her part.
</p>
<p>Without being rebuffed, they felt themselves constrained to stand aloof. There was nothing of which
</p>
<p>they could complain; no pretext for resentmentno opening for sarcasm-no material for scandal.
</p>
<p>But in proportion to the impotence of malice, so
</p>
<p>is the malignity of its hoarded venom. All were
</p>
<p>aware of the political opinions and connexions of
</p>
<p>Mr. Bernard Trevor; and it was easy to make
</p>
<p>remarks in the presence of his daughter, not only
</p>
<p>offensive, but painful to her feelings. To this purpose, no allusion to him was necessary. It was
</p>
<p>enough to speak injuriously of those whom she
</p>
<p>knew to be his friends, and whose public characters
</p>
<p>made them legitimate subjects of applause or censure. By this, and other means of the like character,
</p>
<p>she was always open to annoyance; and to such
</p>
<p>means the dastard insolence of those whom her
</p>
<p>coldness had repelled, habitually resorted for revenge.
</p>
<p>On such occasions she frequently found that her
</p>
<p>cousin Douglas came to her aid. Unrestrained by
</p>
<p>the considerations that imposed silence on her, he

</p>
<p>would palliate or excuse. If even this were inconsistent with his own opinions, he would take occasion
</p>
<p>to speak approvingly of the talents or private worth
</p>
<p>of those who were assailed. Whether she regarded
</p>
<p>this as a proof of good breeding, or of kindness to
</p>
<p>herself, or of an incipient change in his opinions,

<p>such conduct always commanded her gratitude and

</p>
<p>AMONG those who had thus manifested a disposition to win the favor of Delia Trevor, was a young
</p>
<p>man who had, not long since, entered public life
</p>
<p>under the auspices of a father, who, fifteen years
</p>
<p>before, had openly bartered his principles for office.
</p>
<p>Besides some talent, the son possessed the yet higher
</p>
<p>merit, in the eyes of his superiors, of devotion to his
</p>
<p>party and its leader. He never permitted himself
</p>
<p>to be restrained, by any regard to time or place,
</p>
<p>from making his zeal conspicuous. Taught, from
</p>
<p>his infancy, that the true way to recommend his pretensions was to rate them highly himself, he seemed
</p>
<p>determined never to exchange his place in the
</p>
<p>Legislature for any in the gift of the Court, unless
</p>
<p>some distinguished station should be offered to his
</p>
<p>acceptance. For any such, in any department, he
</p>
<p>was understood to be a candidate.
</p>
<p>At first, he supposed that a private intimation to

<p>this effect, through his father, would be all-sufficient.

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>But he was overlooked, and post after post, that he
</p>
<p>would gladly have accepted, was conferred on
</p>
<p>others. Fearful that he might be deemed deficient
</p>
<p>in zeal, he redoubled his diligence, and with
</p>
<p>increased eagerness sought every opportunity to
</p>
<p>display his talents and his ardor in the service of his
</p>
<p>master. Still he seemed no nearer to his object.
</p>
<p>Whether it was thought that he was most serviceable
</p>
<p>in his actual station, or that the wily President
</p>
<p>deemed it a needless waste of patronage to buy
</p>
<p>what was his by hereditary title and gratuitous
</p>
<p>devotion, it is hard to say. The gentleman sometimes seemed on the point of becoming malcontent;
</p>
<p>but his father, who had trained him in the school of
</p>
<p>Sir Pertinax McSycophant, convinced him that
</p>
<p>more was to be got by "booing," and resolute
</p>
<p>subserviency and flattery of the great, than in any
</p>
<p>other way. Under such impressions, he would
</p>
<p>kindle anew the fervor of his zeal and send up his
</p>
<p>incense in clouds. Again disappointed, and sickening into the moroseness of hope deferred, he would
</p>
<p>become moody and reserved, as if watching for an
</p>
<p>opportunity of profitable defection.
</p>
<p>Such an opportunity, at such a moment, had
</p>
<p>seemed to present itself in his acquaintance with
</p>
<p>Delia Trevor. A connection with her seemed
</p>
<p>exactly suited to his interested and ambidextrous
</p>
<p>policy. A handsome and amiable girl were items
</p>
<p>in the account of secondary consideration. But her

<p>fortune was not to be overlooked. Then, should his
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>73
</p>
<p>services, at length, seem likely to meet their long
</p>
<p>deserved reward, she could be presented to the
</p>
<p>court as the niece of Mr. Hugh Trevor, the tried and
</p>
<p>cherished friend of the President. Should the cold
</p>
<p>ingratitude of his superiors at length drive him into
</p>
<p>the opposition for advancement, he was sure of being
</p>
<p>well received as the son-in-law of a patriot so
</p>
<p>devoted as Mr. Bernard Trevor. Utrinque paratus,
</p>
<p>could he secure the hand of Delia, he felt sure that
</p>
<p>he must win, let the cards fall as they might.
</p>
<p>Having taken this view of the subject, and
</p>
<p>examined it in all its bearings, he made up to Delia
</p>
<p>with a directness which startled, and a confidence
</p>
<p>that offended her. But the gentleman had little to
</p>
<p>recommend him to the favor of the fair. His person
</p>
<p>was awkward, and disfigured by a mortal stoop.
</p>
<p>His features, at once diminutive and irregular, were
</p>
<p>either shrouded with an expression of solemn importance, or set off by a smile of yet more offensive selfcomplacency. His manners bore the same general
</p>
<p>character of conceit, alterniately pert and grave; and
</p>
<p>his conversation wavered between resolute, though
</p>
<p>abortive, attempts at wit, and a sort of chopt logic,
</p>
<p>elaborately employed in proving, by incontestable
</p>
<p>arguments, what nobody ever pretended to deny.
</p>
<p>He had been taught by his learned and astute
</p>
<p>father, to lay his foundations so deep that his
</p>
<p>arguments and the patience of his hearers were apt
</p>
<p>to be exhausted by the time he got back to the

<p>tionable, the premises from which other men commonly begin to reason.
</p>
<p>This talent, and this use of it, are more applauded
</p>
<p>by the world than one would think. Men like to be
</p>
<p>confirmed in their opinions; and, the fewer and
</p>
<p>more simple these may be, the more grateful are
</p>
<p>they for anything that looks like a demonstration of
</p>
<p>their truth. To a man whose knowledge of arithmetic only extends to the profound maxim " that two
</p>
<p>and two make four,"' how gratifying to find a distinguished man condescending to prove it by elaborate argument!
</p>
<p>But ladies have little taste for these things, and
</p>
<p>still less for the harsh dogmatism and fierce denunciations of hostile, but absent politicians, with which
</p>
<p>Mr. P. Baker, the younger, occasionally varied his
</p>
<p>discourse. To Delia, therefore, the gentleman, in
</p>
<p>and of himself, and apart from all extrinsic considerations, was absolutely disagreeable. His first
</p>
<p>advances drove her within the safe defences of
</p>
<p>female pride and reserve. But when the manifest
</p>
<p>audacity of his pretensions led her to think of him
</p>
<p>as the supple slave of power, as one who had prostituted himself to the service of his master, with an
</p>
<p>eagerness which condemned his zeal to be its own
</p>
<p>reward, her disgust increased to loathing, and her
</p>
<p>pride was kindled into resentment. Without showing more of these feelings than became her, she

<p>lent and malignant hatred. But she was fortified
</p>
<p>by her position in a family which he dared not
</p>
<p>offend, and his paltry malice found vent in such
</p>
<p>allusions to the politics of the day as he knew must
</p>
<p>wound her.
</p>
<p>Things were about coming to this pass, when
</p>
<p>Douglas Trevor arrived. The first time he met Mr.
</p>
<p>Baker in company with his cousin, he saw a disposition on his part to pay attentions which were obviously annoying to her. Both duty and inclination
</p>
<p>impelled him to come to her relief; and, in doing
</p>
<p>this, he awakened the jealousy and incurred the displeasure of the gentleman. But these were feelings
</p>
<p>he had no mind to display toward one who wore a
</p>
<p>sword, and especially toward the son of a man so
</p>
<p>influential at Washington as Mr. Hugh Trevor. IHe
</p>
<p>accordingly drew off, in morose discomfiture, and
</p>
<p>Delia, relieved from his offensive attentions, felt that
</p>
<p>she owed her deliverance to her cousin. He was, of
</p>
<p>course, bound to occupy the place at her side from
</p>
<p>which he had driven Baker; and she was bound to
</p>
<p>requite the service by making the duty he had imposed on himself as little irksome as possible. She
</p>
<p>exerted herself to be agreeable, and succeeded so
</p>
<p>well, that Douglas went to bed that night in the
</p>
<p>firm belief that he had never passed a more pleasant
</p>
<p>evening, or seen a girl of more charming manners
</p>
<p>than Delia.
</p>
<p>This circumstance led to a sort of tacit convention,

</p>
<p>his appearance. By an easy progress, this engagement was extended to all societies and all places.
</p>
<p>lIe knows little of hlunilan nature who needs to be
</p>
<p>told the natural consequences of these things.
</p>
<p>But, leaving the reader to form his own judgment,
</p>
<p>and to anticipate such result as he may, my present
</p>
<p>business is with the repulsed and irritated Baker.
</p>
<p>Though it consoled his pride and self-love to irmpute his discomfitures, not to any absolute dislike of
</p>
<p>himself, but to a preference for another, there was
</p>
<p>nothing in that preference to soothe his resentment.
</p>
<p>As Douglas had, in the first instance, come somewhat cavalierly between him and the object of his
</p>
<p>wishes, he, perhaps, had reasonable grounds of displeasure against him. But, as it might be quite
</p>
<p>inconvenient to give vent to his feelings in that
</p>
<p>direction, they were carefully repressed. In such
</p>
<p>assaults on those of the lady, as her cousin might
</p>
<p>not observe, or might think it unwise to notice, did
</p>
<p>his malice indulge itself.
</p>
<p>So matters stood when the astounding intelligence
</p>
<p>reached Richmond, that a diplomatic agent from the
</p>
<p>State of South Carolina had been long secretly entertained at the Court of St. James, and that he
</p>
<p>was supposed to have negotiated an informal arrangement for a commercial treaty between that

<p>Here his reception would have been little better

<p>seize on the opportunity of compensating the impiety

<p>to which he felt himself driven, by giving to his

<p>and honored. It was a moment of one of those re

</p>
<p>If even the prodigal or the fraitor be subject to be
</p>
<p>so affected, how much stronger must be such an im
</p>
<p>pulse in the mind of a pure and upright man, impel
</p>
<p>led by a sense of duty to his country to dishonor her
</p>
<p>venerated name. This poor tribute was as the kiss
</p>
<p>of peace with which the executioner implores the
</p>
<p>pardon of some illustrious victim of State policy, who
</p>
<p>is about to bleed under his hand. Ilad lie yielded
</p>
<p>to his feelings, he would have taken up the selfccusing lamentation of the returned prodigal. But
</p>
<p>his sense of duty was deep and abiding, and was
</p>
<p>always most sure to command his exact obedience
</p>
<p>when the duty was most painfill. Ile could not
</p>
<p>doubt the correctness of a conviction, which ever:
</p>
<p>his cherished devotion to his native State could not
</p>
<p>make him shake off entirely. In such a case, t
</p>
<p>doubt was, with him, to be convinced.
</p>
<p>But the name thus bestowed upon his daughtei
</p>
<p>was not without an effect on her mind. She knew
</p>
<p>little of politics, but, from her very infancy, self-love
</p>
<p>had made her jealous of the honor of the State whose
</p>
<p>name she bore. The name itself was a spell of power
</p>
<p>on the heart of Delia. It had disposed her to love
</p>
<p>her cousin before she knew her. It had drawn them
</p>
<p>together on their first acquaintance, and had often
</p>
<p>been the theme of conversation between them.

</p>
<p>tual power, Delia had unwittingly exercised an
</p>
<p>8o
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>influence over the mind of Virginia which inclined
</p>
<p>her to listen favorably to all that could be urged
</p>
<p>against the usurper's claim to a dominion, unchecked
</p>
<p>by the authority of the State.
</p>
<p>For more than a year past, Mr. Trevor had him.
</p>
<p>self begun to doubt the wisdom of his former
</p>
<p>opinions. Doubting, he was silent, but he had not
</p>
<p>been unwilling to subject his daughter to the action
</p>
<p>of her cousin's more vigorous mind. For many
</p>
<p>years, he would as soon have exposed his children
</p>
<p>to the contagion of the plague, as permit them to
</p>
<p>visit their uncle. During the last summer he had
</p>
<p>suffered Arthur and Virginia to spent a month with
</p>
<p>him; and he was not sorry to observe that the
</p>
<p>former came home with deeper thoughts than he
</p>
<p>chose to express. Of their love and admiration of
</p>
<p>their uncle neither made any secret. He was not
</p>
<p>only unlike their father, but so unlike any other
</p>
<p>man, that he had been a curious study to them
</p>
<p>during their whole visit. The originality of his
</p>
<p>thoughts, and the vividness with which he expressed
</p>
<p>them, afforded them constant amusement. He had
</p>
<p>that faculty of making truth look like truth, in the
</p>
<p>exhibition of which the young mind so much
</p>
<p>delights. Then he was so frank, so ardent, and
</p>
<p>withal so kind, that it was impossible to know and
</p>
<p>not to love him.
</p>
<p>After all this, the reader wi1l not be like to par.

<p>found, on shifting his battery, that he was not much
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>81
</p>
<p>more in favor with Virginia Trevor than with her
</p>
<p>cousin. The consequence was, that whenever he
</p>
<p>attempted, in company, to attach himself to the immediate party of these young ladies, he was apt to
</p>
<p>find himself a supernumerary. But, as Virginia
</p>
<p>had shown no marked dislike to him, his vanity
</p>
<p>easily adopted the idea that she considered him as
</p>
<p>the property of Delia. He took some pains to
</p>
<p>undeceive her, and would have been mortified at
</p>
<p>her unconcern on the occasion, had he not thought
</p>
<p>some allowance should be made for her indifference
</p>
<p>to a man who did but take her as a pis aller. He
</p>
<p>did not, therefore, at once withdraw himself from
</p>
<p>their coterie, but continued to hang about, and take
</p>
<p>his part in conversation, whenever nothing particularly exclusive in the manner of the interlocutors
</p>
<p>forbade it. He could not come between whispers;
</p>
<p>but he could answer any observation that met his ear.
</p>
<p>Bjeing, as I have said, something between a proseand a declaimer, he thought himself eloquent, an(,
</p>
<p>would seize occasions to hold forth to the general edification, in a style intended to dazzle the bystanders.
</p>
<p>On the day of which we speak, he had been in
</p>
<p>-close attendance on Virginia, until, rather by address
</p>
<p>than by direct repulse, she had contrived to shake
</p>
<p>him off. Is so happened, that the rest of the company were all paired off, leaving him in the enviable

<p>condition of a half pair of shears, when relief

</p>
<p>82
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, originally one of the devisers of
</p>
<p>thepie nic, had stayed behind for the mail, and now
</p>
<p>arrived with the news alluded to in the last chapter.
</p>
<p>Baker, being disengaged at the moment, was the
</p>
<p>first to receive the intelligence, and he lost no time
</p>
<p>in awakening the attention of the company by vol
</p>
<p>leys of oaths and imprecations. While he continued
</p>
<p>to exercise himself in calling down the vengeance
</p>
<p>of " the Eternal," according to the most approved
</p>
<p>formula of the old court, on those whom he denounced as traitors, the rest listened in amazement,
</p>
<p>disgust, or alarm, to this boisterous effusion of his
</p>
<p>rage. At length, as he stopped to take breath,
</p>
<p>Douglas availed himself of the pause to ask what
</p>
<p>was the matter. The whole story now came out,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Baker, having put his audience in possession of his text, went on with his discourse. Unmindful of the presence of the ladies, he vented his
</p>
<p>wrath in language with which I do not choose to
</p>
<p>stain my paper. Every man who had held a conspicuoi2 pl1ace among the advocates of State rights
</p>
<p>for the last twenty years, was condemned, exa cathedra. The dead were especially recommended to the
</p>
<p>tender mercies of the devil, in whose clutches he
</p>
<p>spposed them to be; while the living were indiscriminately devoted to the same doom.
</p>
<p>Against the person by whom the treaty was said
</p>
<p>to have been negotiated, his wrath burned most
</p>
<p>fiercely. Iu the midst of one of his n-ost savage

</p>
<p>denunciations of that gentleman, he happened to
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>83
</p>
<p>recollect having heard Delia speak of him as the
</p>
<p>intimate friend of her father. The thought turned
</p>
<p>his eye upon her. She was already pale and trem
</p>
<p>bling with emotion, when she caught his insulting
</p>
<p>glance. In an instant the blood gushed to her face,
</p>
<p>and tears to her eyes. He saw it, and went on to
</p>
<p>comprehend in his denunciation all the aiders, abettors, and friends of the traitor, whom in one breath
</p>
<p>he devoted to the gallows.
</p>
<p>This was more than Delia could bear, and more
</p>
<p>than Douglas was disposed to suffer. He had caught
</p>
<p>the glance which Baker had cast at his cousin; he
</p>
<p>saw the effect on her feelings; he witnessed her increasing emotion, and felt it his duty to come to her
</p>
<p>relief. He approached Baker, and passing him, as
</p>
<p>if with no particular design, touched him gently,
</p>
<p>and said in a low voice: "Such language is improper in this company."
</p>
<p>" How so," exclaimed Baker, aloud. " I hope there
</p>
<p>is no man here disposed to take the part of a traitor."
</p>
<p>Douglas turned, and, biting his lip, said in a tone
</p>
<p>not loud, but from its distinctness and marked
</p>
<p>emphasis, audible to all present," I spoke so as to
</p>
<p>be heard by none but you, and invited you by a
</p>
<p>sign to go apart, where I might explain my meaning
</p>
<p>in private. But, as you will have the explanation
</p>
<p>here, I say, that you know there is lo man here disposed to take the part of a traitor. If you had
</p>
<p>thought there was, sir, I suspect your denunciations

</p>
<p>would have been less violent."
</p>

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>"I don't understand you, sir," said Baker, red
</p>
<p>dening.
</p>
<p>"My meaning is as plain as becomes this pre.
</p>
<p>sence," said Douglas, coldly, and again walking
</p>
<p>away. Baker looked around, and read in every eye
</p>
<p>that he was expected to follow. HIe did so, and,
</p>
<p>joining Douglas, they both walked on together.
</p>
<p>"I shall be glad to receive a farther explanation,
</p>
<p>sir," said he in an agitated tone.
</p>
<p>"Speak lower, then," replied Douglas, calmly,
</p>
<p>slipping his arm within that of Baker; "and use no
</p>
<p>gesture. My meaning is this: That he who is
</p>
<p>regardless of the presence and feelings of a lady, is
</p>
<p>not apt to overlook those of a man. To make my
</p>
<p>meaning yet plainer, sir, your language would have
</p>
<p>been more guarded, had my uncle been represented
</p>
<p>here, not by a daughter, but by a son."
</p>
<p>The quiet tone of Douglas's voice, the equivocal
</p>
<p>meaning of the first words he had uttered, and the
</p>
<p>pacific action intended to deceive those who looked
</p>
<p>on, had calmed for a moment the alarm of Baker.
</p>
<p>He had recovered himself before he was made to
</p>
<p>perceive what was really meant; and ere he had
</p>
<p>time to reflect on his situation, the dangerous temptation of a repartee assailed him. Glancing back at
</p>
<p>the company, he said: " If I may judge by appearances, sir, you have the right as well as the inclination to assume that character."
</p>
<p>Douglas had turned his head, instinctively, as

</p>
<p>Baker looked back, and saw that they had rounded
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>85
</p>
<p>a point of rock, and were out of sight. In an in
</p>
<p>stant, he disengaged his arm with a push that nearly
</p>
<p>threw the legislator down the bank, and stepping
</p>
<p>back, glared upon him with an eye that instantly
</p>
<p>brought the other to his senses. While he stood
</p>
<p>blenching and cowering under this fierce glance,
</p>
<p>Douglas recovered his self-command, and said, with
</p>
<p>stern calmness: "You had nearly made me forget
</p>
<p>myself, sir. But we understand each other now.
</p>
<p>Take a turn along the shore to compose yourself. I
</p>
<p>will wait here for you, and we will return to the
</p>
<p>company together."
</p>
<p>He seated himself on a rock, and the other obeyed
</p>
<p>mechanically. How he succeeded in recovering
</p>
<p>his composure is another affair. He walked on, and
</p>
<p>on, and fain would he have followed the course of
</p>
<p>the river to the mountain cave from which it issues,
</p>
<p>there to hide himself from the consequences of his
</p>
<p>own folly and impertinence. What would he not
</p>
<p>have given to recall that last speech? Until then,
</p>
<p>he was the party aggrieved. Douglas's offence
</p>
<p>against him had not been so gross as to admit of no
</p>
<p>explanation; and, to all appearance, an amicable
</p>
<p>one had been given. The truth might not have
</p>
<p>come out until he had had time to escape to his
</p>
<p>constituents; and before the next session the affair
</p>
<p>might have been forgotten. But now, Douglas had
</p>
<p>been insulted, and how he felt and how he would
</p>
<p>resent the insult, was awfully certain.

</p>
<p>Baker continued his walk so far, that the girls
</p>
<p>86
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>became uneasy at the absence of the two young
</p>
<p>men. They begged some of the gentlemen to go in
</p>
<p>quest of them, but the request was evaded. At last,
</p>
<p>they arose from their seats on the rocks, and declared
</p>
<p>they would themselves go. They accordingly set
</p>
<p>out followed by the rest, and in a few yards came to
</p>
<p>where Douglas was quietly seated on a flat stone,
</p>
<p>and playing checks with pebbles on the smooth
</p>
<p>sand.
</p>
<p>"Where is Mr. Baker?" exclaimed Virginia,
</p>
<p>eagerly.
</p>
<p>"' Yonder he goes," replied Douglas, calmly. "He
</p>
<p>has a mind for a longer walk than I like; and I am
</p>
<p>just waiting for him here. But I must not detain
</p>
<p>you, girls. His taste for the picturesque will probably be satisfied by the time we get to our horses,
</p>
<p>and he will soon overtake us."
</p>
<p>He said this with an air so careless as to deceive
</p>
<p>every person present but Delia. But the heart will
</p>
<p>speak from the eye, and a glance at her, as she
</p>
<p>searched his countenance, unconsciously said: "I
</p>
<p>have redressed you." Coloring deeply, she strove
</p>
<p>to hide her emotion,-taking his arm and busying
</p>
<p>herself at the same time with the adjustment of her
</p>
<p>veil. In spite of some undefined apprehensions, she
</p>
<p>was grateful, relieved, and pleased; and a slight
</p>
<p>pressure on the arm she held, spoke her feelings
</p>
<p>perhaps as distinctly as they were understood by
</p>
<p>herself.

<p>Douglas returned the pressure with more energy

</p>
<p>87
</p>
<p>The words of Baker yet tingled in his ears; and
</p>
<p>while they burned with the insult, the pain was more
</p>
<p>than soothed by the thoughts they had awakened.
</p>
<p>Were then the day-dreams of his boyhood to become
</p>
<p>realities? He was not, as yet, conscious of any but
</p>
<p>a cousin's love for Delia. He could impute no other
</p>
<p>feeling to her. -But should this mutual affection
</p>
<p>ripen into a more tender sentiment! With whom
</p>
<p>could a man pass his days more happily, than with a
</p>
<p>woman so intelligent, so amiable, so prudent, so
</p>
<p>much a lady? Ie did not love her. But he felt
</p>
<p>that to love her, and be beloved by her, would be a
</p>
<p>happy lot. The slight weight she rested on his arm
</p>
<p>was sweet to him. He wished the pressure was
</p>
<p>heavier. But she walked on, self-poised, and with
</p>
<p>a light and steady step over the rugged ground.
</p>
<p>Was not that step more confident, because she felt
</p>
<p>that he was there to aid her in case of need? Even
</p>
<p>so, she seemed sufficient for herself in the resources
</p>
<p>of her own mind. Yet had she needed and accepted,
</p>
<p>and gratefully, though silently, acknowledged his
</p>
<p>protection. He was happy in having had occasion
</p>
<p>to protect her. Was not she the happier for it

<p>too? The heart will ask questions. Time gives

</p>
<p>A FEW days after, Douglas handed his cousin the
</p>
<p>illowing paper:
</p>
<p>"Mr. Baker begs leave to throw himself on the
</p>
<p>mercy of Miss Delia Trevor. He confesses his
</p>
<p>offence against her on Saturday last. He admits,
</p>
<p>with shame, that he did intend to wound her feelings, and that he has nothing to offer in extenuation
</p>
<p>of his offence. He does not even presume to ask a
</p>
<p>pardon, which he acknowledges to be unmerited,
</p>
<p>and respectfully tenders the only atonement in his
</p>
<p>power, by assuring Miss Trevor that he will never
</p>
<p>again, intentionally, offend her by his presence.
</p>
<p>Signed,
</p>
<p>PHILIP BAKER."
</p>
<p>Delia read this curious document in silence, and,
</p>
<p>on looking up, found that Douglas had left the room.
</p>
<p>She ran after him, but he was gone, and for a day or

</p>
<p>two avoided any opportunity for farther explanation.

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>At length she found one, and asked by what means
</p>
<p>the paper had been procured.
</p>
<p>"By proper means, my dear coz," said he, "if
</p>
<p>the paper is a proper one."
</p>
<p>"Proper I" exclaimed she, " for me to receive,
</p>
<p>certainly. But for him to give! Indeed, I pity any
</p>
<p>poor wretch who can be so abject. I am glad, at
</p>
<p>least, I am to see him no more. I should find it
</p>
<p>hard to behave to him as becomes myself!"' It would be hard," said Douglas, "but as you
</p>
<p>always will behave as becomes yourself, hard though
</p>
<p>it be, it was right you should be spared the trial."
</p>
<p>"This is your doing then?" said she.
</p>
<p>"No questions, coz," replied Douglas. "I must
</p>
<p>behave as becomes me too."
</p>
<p>This put an effectual stop to farther inquiry, and
</p>
<p>the slight concealment did but deepen Delia's sense
</p>
<p>of the service Douglas had rendered her. While she
</p>
<p>admired the delicacy which, at once, veiled and
</p>
<p>adorned his chivalrous character; he, on his part,
</p>
<p>felt greater pleasure at having redressed her wrong,
</p>
<p>because the affair had taken such a turn as to conceal
</p>
<p>the part that he had acted. The ties thus formed in
</p>
<p>secret, are doubly sacred and doubly sweet. The
</p>
<p>heart involuntarily classes them with those chaste
</p>
<p>mysteries which the vulgar eye must not profane
</p>
<p>They become the theme of thoughts which some
</p>
<p>times rise up, and kindle the cheek, and light the

<p>eye, and then sink down again and hide themselves

<p>But this privacy was destined to be invaded by
</p>
<p>one person, at least; and that, the very one from
</p>
<p>whom Douglas would most anxiously have concealed
</p>
<p>the whole affair. Yet there was no person to whose

<p>tenderness, delicacy, and affection for both parties, it

<p>could have been more fitly confided. In short, Mr.

<p>Trevor, one day, placed in the hands of his son a letter, in the President's own hand-writing, of which the

<p>following is a copy:
</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, March 3d, 1849.
</p>
<p>MY DEAR SIR: I hasten to lay before you a piece
</p>
<p>of information which touches you nearly. Though I
</p>
<p>receive it at the hands of one who has the highest
</p>
<p>claims to my confidence, I yet trust it will prove to
</p>
<p>have originated in mistake.
</p>
<p>It is said that your son, Lieutenant Trevor, on
</p>
<p>receiving the news of the late treasonable proceedings of some of the southern States, openly vindicated them; and that he spoke freely in defence of
</p>
<p>the principal agent in their most wicked attempt to
</p>
<p>league themselves with the enemies of their country.
</p>
<p>It is said, moreover, that, in doing this, he insulted
</p>
<p>and fastened a quarrel on one, whom I have great
</p>
<p>reason to esteem for his uniform devotion to the
</p>
<p>Union. The regular course for such a charge against
</p>
<p>an officer, holding a commission in the army of the
</p>
<p>United States, is one which I would not willingly
</p>
<p>pursue, in the case of the son of one of my earliest

</p>
<p>and most cherished friends. As Lieutenant Trevor
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>91
</p>
<p>is now at home, on furlough, I address this letter to
</p>
<p>you to be laid before him. I have no doubt he will
</p>
<p>readily give the necessary explanations, and, in so
</p>
<p>doing, afford me a new occasion for displaying that
</p>
<p>regard for you and yours, with which I am,
</p>
<p>Dear sir, your friend,
</p>
<p>MARTIN VAN BUREN.
</p>
<p>"Can you tell me what this means? " said the
</p>
<p>mild old gentleman to his son.
</p>
<p>"As I remember," replied Douglas, " the circumstances under which I heard of the events alluded to,
</p>
<p>I think, I can give a guess at the meaning. It means
</p>
<p>that my cousin was insulted, in my presence, and
</p>
<p>that I protected her, as was my duty."
</p>
<p>"And how does it happen that I never heard of
</p>
<p>it? Who was the person, and what has become of
</p>
<p>the affair? "
</p>
<p>"It has all blown over," said Douglas, " and I.had
</p>
<p>hardly expected it would ever be spoken of again.
</p>
<p>Delia alone knew of it from me, as it was right she
</p>
<p>should. I have never mentioned, nor has my friend.
</p>
<p>I am sure she has not; and what the other party can
</p>
<p>promise himself from the exposure, I am sure I cannot tell."
</p>
<p>"The thing is now made public, at all events;
</p>
<p>and both as your father and as the friend of the
</p>
<p>President,' it is right that I should know all about
</p>
<p>it."

</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir," replied Douglas, " you shall know
</p>
<p>92
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>all; and when you do, I need not explain why I
</p>
<p>have never told you before."
</p>
<p>He left the room, and soon returned with a bundle
</p>
<p>of papers. From this he handed one to his father,
</p>
<p>which proved to be a challenge, in the most approved
</p>
<p>form, from him, the said Douglas Trevor, to Philip
</p>
<p>Baker, Esq. Then came a proposition to discuss
</p>
<p>from the other party; then a flat demand of apology, or the alternative of, what is called, gentlemanly satisfaction; then an offer to apologize;
</p>
<p>then the paper we have already seen; and then the
</p>
<p>following:
</p>
<p>" Philip Baker declares, on his honor, that he meant
</p>
<p>no offence to Lieutenant Trevor by any words
</p>
<p>addressed to him on Saturday last; and that he
</p>
<p>deeply regrets having spoken any which may
</p>
<p>have sounded offensively in the ears of Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Trevor."
</p>
<p>"This will do," said Mr. Trevor. "It only shows
</p>
<p>that you have acted as became a soldier and a gentleman. These papers show clearly that the quarrel
</p>
<p>began in an insult to your cousin, which you were
</p>
<p>bound to resent. This will be perfectly satisfactory
</p>
<p>to the President."
</p>
<p>"Doubtless it would be," said Douglas, promptly;
</p>
<p>"but so much of the affair as implicates my cousin's
</p>
<p>name must go no farther."
</p>
<p>"But it is that," replied Mr. Trevor, " which
</p>
<p>shows the cause of the quarrel. The other papers

</p>
<p>only show that you fancied an intention to insult
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>where none existed. This would tally too well with
</p>
<p>what the President has heard."
</p>
<p>" Be it so," answered Douglas calmly. "If the
</p>
<p>President is never satisfied till I furnish a paper
</p>
<p>which is to blend my cousin's name with a public
</p>
<p>discussion, he must remain dissatisfied. I cannot
</p>
<p>help it. Better to have suffered the insult to pass
</p>
<p>unnoticed, than to make a lady's name the theme of
</p>
<p>guard-house wit."
</p>
<p>"Bless you, my noble boy," said the admiring
</p>
<p>father. "You are right, and there is no help for it.
</p>
<p>But what shall I say to the President? "
</p>
<p>"What you please. The conclusions you draw
</p>
<p>from what you know, he is welcome to. The facts
</p>
<p>are with you."
</p>
<p>" Certainly," said Mr. Trevor, after a musing
</p>
<p>pause; " certainly he will trust in my general assurance that his information is, to my certain knowledge,
</p>
<p>erroneous. This will do. It must be sufficient."
</p>
<p>"It must do," said Douglas, " whether it will or
</p>
<p>no. In the mean time, my dear sir, let me beg that
</p>
<p>the affair may go no farther, even in the family.
</p>
<p>Delia alone knows of it, and she only knows as much
</p>
<p>as may be gathered from that paper, a duplicate of
</p>
<p>which is her's by right. I therefore beg that you
</p>
<p>will say nothing about it, even to her."
</p>
<p>And he did say nothing to her; but Douglas
</p>
<p>observed that that night, when she held up her lip
</p>
<p>for his paternal kiss, the kind old gentleman gave it

</p>
<p>THE visit of Delia to her uncle now drew to a
</p>
<p>close, and she prepared for her return home. It
</p>
<p>was settled that she should be accompanied by
</p>
<p>Douglas, Arthur, and Virginia, who were to spend
</p>
<p>a few weeks with her father.
</p>
<p>On the road, Douglas felt more and more the duty
</p>
<p>and the privilege of being the protector of his
</p>
<p>cousin, and, by the time they reached the end of
</p>
<p>their journey, he had discovered that the latter was
</p>
<p>as precious as the former was sacred. Some such
</p>
<p>thought had stolen into his mind while he was yet
</p>
<p>at home, but that was not the place to mention
</p>
<p>the subject to her; and he had determined to impose upon himself the most scrupulous restraint,
</p>
<p>until he should have restored her honorably to her
</p>
<p>father's arms.
</p>
<p>Two days' travel brought them to the residence of
</p>
<p>Mr. Bernard Trevor, on the banks of the Roanoke.
</p>
<p>They found him laid up with a fit of the gout,
</p>
<p>which, while it confined him to the house, produced
</p>
<p>its usual salutarv effect on his general health. At

</p>
<p>the sight of his daughter and her companions, his
</p>
<p>96
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>pain was, for the moment, forgotten; and, flinging
</p>
<p>away his flannels and crutches, he sprang to his
</p>
<p>feet and caught her in his arms. At the same time,
</p>
<p>Arthur and Virginia pressed forward for their wel
</p>
<p>come, which they, in their turn, received.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Trevor was not the only one
</p>
<p>who forgot himself at the sight of Delia. Poor old
</p>
<p>Carlo, starting from his slumbers on the hearth-rug,
</p>
<p>had recognized his young mistress, and was manifesting his joy at her return with boisterous fondness, when one of his feet saluted the inflamed toe
</p>
<p>of his master. In an agony, which none but they
</p>
<p>who have felt it can conceive, the old gentleman
</p>
<p>sank into his chair. Here he remained for some
</p>
<p>minutes, unconscious of every thing but his sufferings, while the soft hand of his daughter replaced
</p>
<p>and soothed the tortured limb.
</p>
<p>At length, recovering enough to look around, his
</p>
<p>eye fell on Douglas, who stood aloof, waiting to be
</p>
<p>introduced. Some little tag of military foppery,
</p>
<p>which always clings to the undress of an officer,
</p>
<p>satisfied Mr. Trevor who he was. Stretching out
</p>
<p>his hand, he said: " Ah! Douglas, my dear boy I!
</p>
<p>How glad I am to see you! But I ought not to
</p>
<p>have recognized you, you dog I standing back there
</p>
<p>with your hat under your arm, as if waiting your
</p>
<p>turn of presentation at a levee. Perhaps you don't
</p>
<p>remember me. I' certainly should not have known
</p>
<p>you, but for the circumstances under which I see

<p>you. But what of that? Was it not yesterday you
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>97
</p>
<p>were sitting on my knee, and hanging about my
</p>
<p>neck? Yes, it was yesterday; though we have both
</p>
<p>dreamed a great deal since. But dreams must give
</p>
<p>way to realities; so let us vote it yesterday, and
</p>
<p>meet to-day as we parted last night."
</p>
<p>This singular accoste had the desired effect, and
</p>
<p>Douglas felt, at once, as if he had been with his
</p>
<p>uncle all his life.
</p>
<p>" You forget, my dear sir," said he, " that I was
</p>
<p>intercepted by one whose privilege, I am sure, you
</p>
<p>would not have me dispute, though he has abused it
</p>
<p>ao cruelly."
</p>
<p>"You mean the dog?" said Mr. Trevor. "Poor
</p>
<p>lId Carlo! Come to your master, my poor fellow!
</p>
<p>No; your privilege shall never be invaded. We are
</p>
<p>both past service now, and must learn to sympathize
</p>
<p>with each other. If you cannot understand the
</p>
<p>nature of a gouty toe, I hQpe I shall always have
</p>
<p>heart enough to understand yours. Give me a rough
</p>
<p>coat, or a black skin, for a true friend; one that will
</p>
<p>not grudge any superior advantages that I may possess. Tom," added he, in a tone of marked gentleness, "' the fire is low. No, not yourself, old man,"
</p>
<p>he continued, as the negro whom he addressed
</p>
<p>moved toward the door; "not you, my good old
</p>
<p>friend. Just ring the bell, and let one of those lazy
</p>
<p>dogs in the kitchen bring in some wood. But why
</p>
<p>don't you speak to your master Douglas? I am sure
</p>
<p>you remember what cronies you were, when you
</p>
<p>were teaching him to ride."

</p>
<p>" I'm mighty proud to see you, sir," said the old
</p>
<p>man, taking the offered hand of Douglas, with an air
</p>
<p>of affectionate humility. " But it was not my place,
</p>
<p>sir," added he, answering his master's words, "to
</p>
<p>speak first. I made sure master Douglas would remember me after a while."*
</p>
<p>" I do remember you, Tom," said Douglas, cordially, " and many a time, on parade, have I been
</p>
<p>thankful to you for teaching me to hold my reins
</p>
<p>and manage my horse."
</p>
<p>"You will find it hard," said Mr. Trevor, gravely,
</p>
<p>" to convince Tom that you remember him, if you
</p>
<p>call him by that name. Tom is Delia's daddy, and
</p>
<p>Lucia's, and Arthur's, and Virginia's daddy, and so
</p>
<p>will be to the day of his death. If ever he ceases to
</p>
<p>be your daddy, too, Douglas, I shall move to
</p>
<p>reconsider the vote that we just now passed unanimously."
</p>
<p>"It is a vice the northern air has blown upon
</p>
<p>* I crave the forbearance of all critics, who have taken their ideas
</p>
<p>of a Virginia house-servant from Csesar Thompson, or any such caricatures, for giving Tom's own words, and his own pronunciation of
</p>
<p>them. It is not my fault if there is but little peculiarity in his phraseology. His language was never elegant, and frequently ungrammatical. But he spoke better than the peasantry of most countries, though
</p>
<p>he said some things that a white man would not say; perhaps, because he had some feelings to which the white man is a stranger. A
</p>
<p>white man, for example, would have said he was glad to see Douglas,
</p>
<p>whether he were so or not. Old Tom said he was proud to see him,

<p>because he was proud to recognize his former pet in the handsome and

</p>
<p>what you said just now, and am not more sure of
</p>
<p>being affectionately remembered by any that I used
</p>
<p>to know, than by my good old daddy."
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor now requested Tom to see that the
</p>
<p>horses of the travellers were properly attended to;
</p>
<p>and the negro left the room.
</p>
<p>"What a graceful and gentlemanly old man!"
</p>
<p>said Douglas, looking after him.
</p>
<p>"His manners," said Mr. Trevor, "are exactly
</p>
<p>suited to his situation. Their characteristic is proud
</p>
<p>humility. The opposite is servile sulkiness, of which,
</p>
<p>I suspect, Douglas, you have seen no little."
</p>
<p>" I have seen nothing else," said Douglas, " among
</p>
<p>the servants in the North. If the tempers of our
</p>
<p>negroes were as ferocious, and their feelings as
</p>
<p>hostile, we should have to cut their throats in selfdefence in six months."
</p>
<p>" I am glad," said Mr. Trevor, " that you have not
</p>
<p>learned to sacrifice your own experience to the fanciful theories of the Amis de Noirs, at least on this
</p>
<p>point. The time, I hope, will come when you will
</p>
<p>see, if you do not already, the fallacy of all their cant
</p>
<p>and sophistry on the subject of domestic slavery.
</p>
<p>You will then bless God that your lot has been cast
</p>
<p>where the freedom of all, who, in the economy of
</p>
<p>Providence, are capable of freedom, is rendered

<p>"I am not sure," said Douglas, " that I exactly
</p>
<p>comprehend you."
</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," replied the uncle. "And that
</p>
<p>reminds me that I am trespassing on forbidden
</p>
<p>ground. Just there, the differences of opinion between your father and myself commence; and from
</p>
<p>that point they diverge so much, that I do not feel at
</p>
<p>liberty to speak to his son on certain topics."
</p>
<p>"] But why not, my dear sir? You surely cannot
</p>
<p>expect me to think with my father on all subjects;
</p>
<p>and you would not have me do so, when you thought
</p>
<p>him wrong. I do not profess to be deeply studied
</p>
<p>in these matters; but, between your lights and his,
</p>
<p>I might hope to find my way to the truth."
</p>
<p>"' There are some subjects, Douglas," replied Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor, with solemnity, "on which it is better to be
</p>
<p>in error than to differ, totally and conscientiously,
</p>
<p>from a father. Delia is but a girl; but should she
</p>
<p>have come back to me changed in her sentiments
</p>
<p>(opinions she cannot have) in regard to certain matters, I should feel that I had been grievously wronged
</p>
<p>by any one who had wrought the change. I know
</p>
<p>your father has not done this; and I must do as I
</p>
<p>would lib done by, and as I am sure I have been
</p>
<p>done by."
</p>
<p>" I cannot conceive," said Douglas, " what sort of
</p>
<p>subjects those can be, concerning which error in opinion is better than truth, under any circumstances."

<p>"Those," replied Mr. Trevor, "in which truth

</p>
<p>"lNay, then," said Douglas, " there is no danger
</p>
<p>of my conversion in such cases. I should take that
</p>
<p>as an infallible proof that doctrines leading to such
</p>
<p>consequences must be false."
</p>
<p>"Your proposed test of truth is so specious,"
</p>
<p>observed Mr. Trevor, " that I will go so far as to say
</p>
<p>one word to convince you of its fallacy. If ever I
</p>
<p>take you in hand, my lad, my first lesson will be to
</p>
<p>teach you to examine plausibilities closely, and to
</p>
<p>distrust summary and simple arguments on topics
</p>
<p>about which men differ."
</p>
<p>" Does any one, then, maintain," asked Douglas,
</p>
<p>" that two opinions which impose conflicting duties
</p>
<p>can both be right?"
</p>
<p>" I shall not answer that," answered Mr. Trevor.
</p>
<p>" You shall answer it yourself. You are a soldier
</p>
<p>of the United States. Suppose an insurrection.
</p>
<p>What, in that case, would be your duty?"
</p>
<p>"To fight against the rebels," replied Douglas,
</p>
<p>promptly.
</p>
<p>": And, thinking as you do, so it would be. Now,
</p>
<p>suppose your father to be one of those same
</p>
<p>rebels."
</p>
<p>"I see," said Douglas, after a pause, in which he
</p>
<p>colored to the tips of his ears; "I see that you are
</p>
<p>right."
</p>
<p>" In what?" asked Mr. Trevor.

<p>"But I have not said so," replied Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>smiling.
</p>
<p>" But you have proved it."
</p>
<p>LI am not quite sure of that. Here is anothersummary and simple looking argument, on a difficult question. My own rule is,'distrust and
</p>
<p>re-exanmine.' "
</p>
<p>He stopped short, while Douglas looked at him
</p>
<p>with a perplexed and wondering eye. He at length
</p>
<p>went on: " I shall not break faith with your father
</p>
<p>by teaching you to think. You have the propositions; and you see there is fallacy somewhere.
</p>
<p>Analyse the subject, and find your own result. But
</p>
<p>come, my boy-this is poor entertainment for a hungry traveller. Your aunt has some dinner for you
</p>
<p>by this time, and here is Tom come to tell us so.
</p>
<p>Come, give me your arm, and help me to the dining room."

</p>
<p>"Both! both! my children!" exclaimed the old

<p>man, throwing away his other crutch. " Why, now
</p>
<p>I am better off than a man with sound limbs."
</p>
<p>In the dining room, Mrs. Trevor awaited them.
</p>
<p>A hasty greeting was all she had allowed herself on
</p>
<p>the first arrival of the party; after which, she
</p>
<p>betook herself to the duties of housewifery and
</p>
<p>hospitality. They found her standing at the back
</p>
<p>of her chair; and Douglas, as he entered, thought

<p>graceful in her person; and with a countenance
</p>
<p>beaming with frankness, animation, and intelligence.
</p>
<p>She had been a beautiful woman, and, being much
</p>
<p>younger than her husband, was still handsome. She
</p>
<p>extended her hand to Douglas as he entered, and
</p>
<p>placing him near her, so mingled the courtesy due
</p>
<p>to a stranger with the cordiality of an old acquaintance, as to make him feel all the comfort and ease
</p>
<p>of home, without ever losing a sense of that bland
</p>
<p>influence, which, while it secures decorum, imposes
</p>
<p>no constraint.
</p>
<p>" Would you have known me.?" asked the lady.
</p>
<p>"I cannot say I could have identified you," he
</p>
<p>replied; "but I should have recognized you as one
</p>
<p>I ought to know."
</p>
<p>" And your uncle?"
</p>
<p>"Not by sight, certainly," said Douglas. "I
</p>
<p>remember him too distinctly for that. He is too
</p>
<p>much altered. But I know him by his manners and
</p>
<p>conversation. These I never could forget; and
</p>
<p>these are the same, and peculiarly his own. I
</p>
<p>remember how he used to exercise my mind, and
</p>
<p>make me talk; and yet never let me talk without
</p>
<p>thinking."
</p>
<p>" And has he been at the old game already I"
</p>
<p>"0 yes! He has set me to revising and doubting what have seemed to me to be self-evident truths,

<p>by myself. What conclusion I am to settle in, I

</p>
<p>not be surprised if I go away convinced that I have
</p>
<p>seven fingers on one hand, and but two on the
</p>
<p>other; nine in all."
</p>
<p>" He has not touched on politics?"
</p>
<p>"0 no! That subject he has tabooed; and I am
</p>
<p>truly sorry for it; for while I never desire to waver
</p>
<p>in my allegiance to the United States, I am anxious
</p>
<p>to understand what may become me as a Virginian.
</p>
<p>Itf I may judge from what my father says, there is
</p>
<p>no man from whom I could learn more on that subject than my uncle."
</p>
<p>" His lesson would not be a short one," replied the
</p>
<p>lady. " His commandments on behalf of the State
</p>
<p>are only second in authority with him to the decalogue; and they do not lie in as small a compass.
</p>
<p>But he fears he might teach you some things your
</p>
<p>father would wish you to unlearn."
</p>
<p>"I am not so sure of that," answered Douglas.
</p>
<p>"I meant to say that there is no man whose judgment my father holds in higher respect."
</p>
<p>"That is something new," said Mrs. Trevor, coloring, and with a countenance in which there was some
</p>
<p>expression of wounded pride. "I should be glad to
</p>
<p>be convinced of that."
</p>
<p>"Why should you doubt it?" asked the young
</p>
<p>man, with surprise.
</p>
<p>"Because it has not alrays been so; and, as I claim
</p>
<p>a woman's privilege to admire my husband above all
</p>
<p>men, I have felt hurt at it. Your uncle thinks so

</p>
<p>these things, and quietly submitted to be condemned
</p>
<p>as a heretic on account of opinions, of the correctness
</p>
<p>of which he found it impossible to doubt."
</p>
<p>" There may have been something of this," said Douglas, earnestly; " but I assure you it is not so now.
</p>
<p>I do believe one motive with my father for wishing
</p>
<p>me to make this visit, is his desire that I should hear
</p>
<p>both sides; and have the benefit of the sagacity and

</p>
<p>Trevor, "before he will open his mouth to you. But
</p>
<p>I shall be less scrupulous; and I am in daily expectation of a friend whose frankness will leave you no
</p>
<p>cause to regret your uncle's reserve."
</p>
<p>"Who is that?" asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>"' I shall leave you to find out. You will see many
</p>
<p>here who feel and think with your uncle, and who
</p>
<p>come to him to compare thoughts and concert measures. Among themn is the man on whom the destinies of his country depend."
</p>
<p>"' The only man of whom I should predicate that,"
</p>
<p>replied Douglas, with some quickness, "is one who, I
</p>
<p>am very sure, never comes here."
</p>
<p>" There is a good and an evil principle," said Mrs.
</p>
<p>Trevor. " Events alike depend on both. You speak
</p>
<p>of the one of these-I of the other."
</p>
<p>Douglas felt his cheek burn at this remark. His
</p>
<p>aunt, observing it, added: " You see, you will run

<p>good sense may be trusted to lead you right, without

</p>
<p>Douglas felt the truth of the first part of this speech.
</p>
<p>Whether anything more than a complimentary turn
</p>
<p>of expression was meant in the closing words, he did
</p>
<p>not know. But if the lady intended to express a hope
</p>
<p>that he might become a convert to the disorganizing
</p>
<p>notions which he feared were prevalent in her circle,
</p>
<p>he took the liberty to doubt whether her anticipations
</p>
<p>would ever be realized. He now changed the conversation, and determined to take a second thought
</p>
<p>before he invited discussions which might mislead
</p>
<p>him. He found he had to do with active and vigorous minds, against which he might, perhaps, vainly

<p>strive to defend himself, even with truth on his side.

<p>SHAKSPEARF..
</p>
<p>I SHOULD detain the reader with matters not worthy
</p>
<p>of a place in this grave history, if I descended to the
</p>
<p>particulars of the intercourse between Douglas Trevor
</p>
<p>and his charming cousin. It is enough to say, that
</p>
<p>he found himself, daily, more and more happy in her
</p>
<p>society; and was more and more convinced that it
</p>
<p>was a necessary ingredient in his happiness. It was
</p>
<p>not long before he concluded that he would not live
</p>
<p>without her; and, having told her so, was referred by
</p>
<p>her to her father.
</p>
<p>Nothing doubting that his communication would be
</p>
<p>favorably received, Douglas was eager to break the
</p>
<p>matter to his uncle, and ask his approbation of his
</p>
<p>suit. To his utter amazement, the old gentleman,
</p>
<p>assuming an air at once serious and tender, said: "My
</p>
<p>dear boy, had I the world to choose from, there is no
</p>
<p>man to whom I would sooner trust my daughter's
</p>
<p>happiness. But circumstances forbid your union. 1

<p>passing. I anticipated this communication, and dell
</p>
<p>berately decided on my answer."
</p>
<p>"For God's sake, sir!" exclaimed Douglas, tremn-:ling with impatience, "what do you mean; and
</p>
<p>what is your answer? "
</p>
<p>"I mean," said Mr. Trevor, "and my answer is,
</p>
<p>that circumstances forbid it."
</p>
<p>"Surely," said Douglas, "your objection is not
</p>
<p>to the nearness of blood."
</p>
<p>" I am not addicted to any such exploded superstition," said Mr. Trevor. " But my daughter must
</p>
<p>never marry one that wears that dress."
</p>
<p>"I like my profession, sir," said Douglas, "but
</p>
<p>will change it without hesitation."
</p>
<p>" God forbid!" replied the old gentleman. "I
</p>
<p>would not have you do so; and were you so inclined,
</p>
<p>it would not be in your choice."
</p>
<p>" I can resign when I will, and my resignation will
</p>
<p>certainly be accepted."
</p>
<p>" Still you would be a soldier, and you must be a
</p>
<p>soldier. Peace is not in our choice, and the time is
</p>
<p>at hand when every man, who can wield a sword,
</p>
<p>must do so."
</p>
<p>" TI do not understand you, sir," said Douglas in
</p>
<p>amazement.
</p>
<p>"I am aware you do not. It is time you should.
</p>
<p>You have now a right to understand me; and I have
</p>
<p>a right to be understood by you. We are on the

</p>
<p>I am not always imprisoned by the gout; and nothing but physical inability shall keep me fiorn sustaining, with my sword, a cause that I have always
</p>
<p>advocated with tongue and pen. It'will be bad
</p>
<p>enough to meet the sons of my brother in arms
</p>
<p>against my country. That I cannot help. But it is
</p>
<p>in my choice whether I shall thus meet my daughter's husband. That must never be."
</p>
<p>He ceased to speak, and the young man, dizzy
</p>
<p>with mixed thoughts and feelings, sat gazing at him
</p>
<p>in mute astonishment. At'length, starting up, he
</p>
<p>was about to leave the room, when the old gentleman held out his hand. Douglas gave his, and his
</p>
<p>uncle, pressing it cordially, went on: "My son,"
</p>
<p>said he, "you are the only male of my race in whom
</p>
<p>I recognize any thing which tells me that the same
</p>
<p>blood flows in our veins. We cannot help the selfishness that disposes us to love those who resemble
</p>
<p>us even in our faults. It might be better for you not
</p>
<p>to resemble me, and perhaps I ought to wish that
</p>
<p>you did not. But I cannot. I find it easier to forget
</p>
<p>that you are not my son, and to love you as if you
</p>
<p>were. The hope that you may yet be so, is hardly
</p>
<p>less dear to me than to you. That you will be so, if'you outlive the envy' of those awful events which
</p>
<p>shall open your eyes, I can hardly doubt. But these
</p>
<p>things must do their work. The convictions which
</p>

<p>can but hope for the best. I do hope; and I invite
</p>
<p>you to hope. But for the present, hope must be our
</p>
<p>all. Things must remain as they are until it pleases
</p>
<p>God so to order events as to make your sense of duty
</p>
<p>to your country consistent with that which, as my
</p>
<p>daught',r's husband, you will owe to her and to hel
</p>
<p>father."
</p>
<p>I leave the reader to imagine the consternation of
</p>
<p>Douglas at this decisive condemnation of his proposed plan of happiness, and at the astounding intelligence that accompanied it. He saw plainly that
</p>
<p>his uncle spoke not conjecturally, but from certain
</p>
<p>knowledge; and he was sure, that under such circumstances, no attachment could tempt Delia to
</p>
<p>marry him. He did not therefore attempt to continue the discussion of the subject, but left the house
</p>
<p>and wandered into the fields.
</p>
<p>The tumult of his mind rendered him incapable of
</p>
<p>reflexion. I shall not attempt to analyze the chaos
</p>
<p>of his thoughts. But light, not darkness, floated on
</p>
<p>the surface. The hand of Delia was indeed withheld for a season, but he was not forbidden to hope
</p>
<p>that it might one day or other be his. Should it
</p>
<p>ever be true that rebellion was awake, and that civil
</p>
<p>war was at hand, he was not told that fidelity to his
</p>
<p>standard would be imputed to him as a crime. The
</p>
<p>strife must end one way or the other, and that being

</p>
<p>alternative of relinquishing the object of his most
</p>
<p>ardent wish, or exhibiting the shocking spectacle of
</p>
<p>a husband warring against the father of his wife.
</p>
<p>But what was to be done in the mean time?
</p>
<p>Should the old gentleman take the field, he must
</p>
<p>find some other theatre of action, and his father's
</p>
<p>influence with the President would readily procure
</p>
<p>him that indulgence. As to the idea of renouncing
</p>
<p>what he had been taught to call his allegiance to the
</p>
<p>Federal Government, and aiding to maintain the
</p>
<p>dishonored sovereignty of his native State, it did not
</p>
<p>enter his mind. Yet there was something in its
</p>
<p>workings that suddenly awakened an undefined
</p>
<p>interest in the late correspondence between his father
</p>
<p>and the President. He no sooner thought of this,
</p>
<p>than his restless wanderings received a definite direction to the neighboring post-office.
</p>
<p>Here he found a letter from his father, containing
</p>
<p>title more than the copy of one from the President.
</p>
<p>Its contents were as follows:
</p>
<p>"WASHINGTON, March 20, 1849.

<p>and that, by making thus light of it, I may estrange
</p>
<p>a friend, whom they regard as hardly less valuable
</p>
<p>and meritorious than him whose feelings I wish to
</p>
<p>save. They represent,, moreover, that the affair is
</p>
<p>bruited in the army, and that some officers are malcontent at the thought that a charge so serious

</p>
<p>Your uncle has been a soldier in his youth, and is
</p>
<p>profoundly versed in all matters of military etiquette
</p>
<p>He is, moreover, a clear-sighted and sagacious iana
</p>
<p>who will, at once, see this matter in all its bearings
</p>
<p>and relations to other subjects. His views are not
</p>
<p>only, in general, more comprehensive than mine, but
</p>
<p>I suspect he is, at this moment, aware of considerations which might properly influence you, and which
</p>
<p>are hidden from me. I know his guarded and delicate reserve, in all his communications with my
</p>
<p>children, where he apprehends a difference of opinion
</p>
<p>between himself and me. Tell him that he has my
</p>
<p>thanks for it; but that I shall be yet more obliged,
</p>
<p>if, in this instance, he will cast it aside entirely, and
</p>
<p>give you the benefit of all his thoughts, as if you

<p>were his own son. I fear my last days may be spent

</p>
<p>It is enough to grieve the heart,

<p>To think that God's fair world hath been
</p>
<p>The footstool of a thing so mean.
</p>
<p>BYRON.
</p>
<p>THE evening was far advanced, when Douglas
</p>
<p>again reached his uncle's house. He went immediately to his room, and sent to request a private
</p>
<p>interview with Mr. Trevor. He was accordingly
</p>
<p>invited into the little study of the old gentleman,
</p>
<p>where he commonly sat surrounded by books and
</p>
<p>papers. On entering the room, he observed an
</p>
<p>elderly gentleman, whom he had never seen before,
</p>
<p>pass out at a door communicating with the drawingroom.
</p>
<p>Douglas now silently handed his father's letter to
</p>
<p>his uncle. Mr. Trevor read it attentively, and again
</p>
<p>and again looked over it, resting his eye on particular passages, as if to possess himself of the full
</p>
<p>meaning of every expression. The subject was in
</p>
<p>itself interesting, and quite new to him. But he felt
</p>
<p>a yet deeper interest in the obscure intimations of a
</p>
<p>change in his brother's mind in regard to those matters about which they had so long and so painfully

</p>
<p>differed. Even if he was mistaken in this, it was
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>115
</p>
<p>consoling to find himself rising in the estimation of
</p>
<p>Mr. Hugh Trevor; no longer regarded by him as
</p>
<p>rash, reckless, and inconsiderate, but consulted as a
</p>
<p>"clear-sighted and sagacious man" in an affair of
</p>
<p>very great importance. IHe alone, who has been
</p>
<p>conscious of being thus undervalued by a friend at
</p>
<p>once beloved and respected, can estimate the satisfaction which Mr. Trevor felt at that moment. If
</p>
<p>there was any mixture of alloy with this pleasure, it
</p>
<p>flowed from self-reproach. He had sometimes found
</p>
<p>it impossible to repress some little risings of resent
</p>
<p>ment, at finding his judgment habitually disabled by
</p>
<p>his elder brother. He had indeed been once a little
</p>
<p>white-headed boy, when the other was a highly intelligent and promising youth. But, at sixty, he was
</p>
<p>not quite content to be still looked on as a child.
</p>
<p>Yet, when he remarked the candor of his brother's
</p>

</p>
<p>he was vexed to think that one unkind thought
</p>
<p>toward him had ever entered his mind.
</p>
<p>At lengthl, he interrupted this train of thought, to
</p>
<p>ask of Douglas an explanation of the President's
</p>
<p>letter. In answer, he received a detailed account
</p>
<p>of the scene at the falls, and was permitted to read
</p>
<p>the correspondence which had grown out of it.
</p>
<p>"I have heard something of this before," said
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor. " Delia told me all that passed in her

<p>intended to insult a lady. He might, at least, have

<p>had the grace to lie about it. False shame is bettei
</p>
<p>than no shame at all."
</p>
<p>" Ele would have been glad to put the matter on
</p>
<p>that footing," said Douglas, "could he have got
</p>
<p>leave to do so. He sent me such a paper as you
</p>
<p>suppose, but I refused to receive it. His apology
</p>
<p>to me I knew to be false. It was, therefore, the
</p>
<p>more satisfactory because the more humiliating.
</p>
<p>But I sent him word that I would not take any thing
</p>
<p>to my cousin but the truth. Here," continued Douglas, " is his first project of an apology, and of my
</p>
<p>rejection of it."
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor read them, and then said: " This is
</p>
<p>well. I knew you had acted handsomely, but how
</p>
<p>handsomely, I had not conceived of. But let me
</p>
<p>hear, I pray you, how all this has been tortured into
</p>
<p>an offence'against majesty."
</p>
<p>Douglas colored slightly at the word, and handed
</p>
<p>his uncle a copy of the President's first letter to his
</p>
<p>father. He had but to add an account of his subsequent conversation with his father, and Mr. Trevor
</p>
<p>was in possession of the whole affair.
</p>
<p>"You see," said Douglas, " that I am referred to
</p>
<p>you for advice, and that you are invited to say to
</p>
<p>me, unreservedly, what you will."
</p>
<p>"I do see," replied iMr. Trevor, "that I have

<p>the UJnited States. I cannot, therefore, discard all
</p>
<p>reserve, but all that he has ever imposed on me, I

<p>now shake off. Indeed, I should have done this
</p>
<p>now, without his permission. You are my son, as
</p>
<p>well as his. You have shown that you know how to
</p>
<p>protect my daughter, and have fairly earned a right
</p>
<p>to protect her through life. Nay, no raptures: no
</p>
<p>thanks! The exercise of this right must be postponed until affairs have taken a different shape from
</p>
<p>that they bear at present. But revenons 2 nos moutons!" The question is, what you are to do to save
</p>
<p>this despicable, heartless wretch from the necessity
</p>
<p>of offending a wretch even baser than himself, whom
</p>
<p>he despises."
</p>
<p>"Whom do you mean?" asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>"I mean," replied the other, " the President and
</p>
<p>the elder Baker, that tame slave of power, that
</p>
<p>shameless, mercenary pander, who, having both
</p>
<p>talent and reputation, sold the one and sacrificed

<p>the other for office and infamy."
</p>
<p>"And is it for such a man," exclaimed Douglas,

<p>father were any thing but the perfect gentleman he
</p>
<p>is, I might suspect that his reference to me was
</p>
<p>intended to elicit some such suggestion. But I
</p>
<p>know him better. I infer from his letter more than
</p>
<p>you discover there; and I am not sure that the
</p>
<p>advice which I am most disposed to give, is that
</p>
<p>which he would be best pleased to see you follow."
</p>
<p>"What would that advice be?" asked Douglas,
</p>
<p>anxiously.
</p>
<p>" Nay," replied the old gentleman, " when I have
</p>
<p>made up my mind, you shall know."
</p>
<p>" But why not give me your thoughts," said the
</p>
<p>youth, " and let us discuss them?"
</p>
<p>"Because, circumstanced as you are, we cannot
</p>
<p>properly discuss them. I can but give you my judgment, when I have formed it, and leave you to find
</p>
<p>out the reasons for it."
</p>
<p>"My own first thought," said Douglas, "is to
</p>
<p>resign. Let us discuss that."
</p>
<p>" It was mine too," said the uncle, "and there is
</p>
<p>therefore no occasion to discuss it. Though I had
</p>
<p>not sufficiently matured my opinion to announce it
</p>
<p>to you, I think I may promise, that if you come to
</p>
<p>that conclusion, r shall not dissent from it."
</p>
<p>" The only difficulty that I see in the way," said
</p>
<p>Douglas, " is that an offer to resign is, under such
</p>
<p>circumstances, generally understood as a shrinking
</p>
<p>from inquiry."
</p>
<p>" It is so; and the opinion is so far right, that,

</p>
<p>the infamy. It is a tacit consent to be infamous,
</p>
<p>only on condition that one may be safe."
</p>
<p>"You state the point with startling force," said
</p>
<p>the youth. "And how would you distinguish this
</p>
<p>case from the one you suppose?"
</p>
<p>"By' distinguishing the accusation from one of
</p>
<p>falsehood, peculation, or cowardice. Should you
</p>
<p>plead guilty to such charges as these, or seek to
</p>
<p>evade them by resignation, you stand dishonored.
</p>
<p>But read over the President's bill of indictment.
</p>
<p>Now suppose it true that you had entertained and
</p>
<p>avowed the sentiments there imputed to you, would
</p>
<p>there be any dishonor in that?"
</p>
<p>" Certainly not; unless my being an officer of the
</p>
<p>iTnited States would make a difference."
</p>
<p>" Should that prevent you from thinking, or take
</p>
<p>away a fieeman's right to express his thoughts?"
</p>
<p>"' It would seem not. But does it not make some
</p>
<p>difference?"
</p>
<p>" Certainly. Shall I tell you what it is? Such
</p>
<p>sentiments would make it your duty (not to the United
</p>
<p>States, but to Virginia and to yourself,) to resign.
</p>
<p>Now, it is because I have no mind to seduce a soldier from his standard that I have been careful not
</p>
<p>to infuse such sentiments into you. If once you lay
</p>
<p>aside the panoply of the uniform, and throw away
</p>
<p>tile amulet of the commission, I would not ensure
</p>
<p>you against opinions which you may have to maintain at the hazard of your life. But time presses.

<p>promptly and decidedly than I should otherwise

</p>
<p>But, if you have no objection, I should like to consult a friend, on whose most hasty opinions I rely
</p>
<p>more than on the coolest judgment of others."
</p>
<p>"If you mean my aunt," said Douglas, " I know
</p>
<p>few persons on whose instinctive sense of propriety I
</p>
<p>should place more reliance."
</p>
<p>" She would well deserve your confidence; but I
</p>
<p>mean the gentleman who left the room as you entered.
</p>
<p>He has been her friend for thirty years, and mine for
</p>
<p>more than half that time."
</p>
<p>"But to me," said Douglas, " he is an utter stranger,
</p>
<p>and I feel some delicacy in consulting a stranger on
</p>
<p>such an occasion."
</p>
<p>" You forget," said Mr. Trevor, " that all there is
</p>
<p>of delicacy in the case touches me as nearly as you.
</p>
<p>It is not you, a stranger, but I, an intimate friend,
</p>
<p>who propose to ask his advice. Charge that matter

<p>to my account, then, and merely decide for yourself,
</p>
<p>whether it may not be desirable to have the counsel

<p>of one as remarkable for scrupulous delicacy, as for
</p>
<p>sagacity and resource?"
</p>
<p>"There can be but one answer to that question,"
</p>
<p>replied Douglas, " and I shall therefore gladly take
</p>
<p>thbe benefit of his advice."
</p>
<p>The hand-bell sounded, and the ever-ready Tom
</p>
<p>appeared. "My respects to Mr. B," said Mr.

</p>

</p>
<p>Tom disappeared, and soon returned marshalling in
</p>
<p>Mr. B . He was a man apparently of sixty years
</p>
<p>of age, or more, slightly formed, but tall, erect, cleanlimbed, and sinewy. His vigor seemed little impaired
</p>
<p>by time, though his high and strong features made
</p>
<p>him look at least as old as he was. A light blue eye,
</p>
<p>clear and sparkling, quick in its glance, but settled
</p>
<p>and searching in its gaze, was the striking feature of
</p>
<p>his face. The sun had burned out all traces of his
</p>
<p>original complexion, and a silver hue had usurped the
</p>
<p>color of his hair. His whole appearance was imposing, and while it commanded the respect due to the
</p>
<p>wisdom of age, seemed to claim no pity for its infirmities. To this sentiment, which enters so largely
</p>
<p>into the composition of that character which the world
</p>
<p>calls venerable, he certainly made no pretensions. No
</p>
<p>one would have called him venerable, though no
</p>
<p>man was held in higher veneration by those who knew
</p>
<p>him.

<p>LOVELACUi.
</p>
<p>THE frankness and cordiality of his manner, when
</p>
<p>introduced to Douglas, gave assurance that he took
</p>
<p>a great interest in the young man; who felt, on his
</p>
<p>part, that he was in the presence of a man of no com
</p>
<p>mon mould, and that in that man he had found an
</p>
<p>efficient friend.
</p>
<p>"And now, Tom," said Mr. Trevor, "pass the word
</p>
<p>for coffee and privacy in this room."
</p>
<p>Tom bowed and withdrew, and Mr. Trevor, without preface or apology, proceeded to lay the case
</p>
<p>before his friend. This he did with great precision
</p>
<p>of statement, while the other listened'with an air
</p>
<p>which showed that no word was lost on him. Having got through, Mr. Trevor added: " We now wish

<p>you to advise what should be done in this case."

<p>aware," said B-, "and with which our young
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>123
</p>
<p>friend shall be made acquainted after resignation 
</p>
<p>not before. But there are others which may be spoken
</p>
<p>of now. The alternative is a court of inquiry, a courtmartial, or resignation. To the two first the same
</p>
<p>objection applies. Your nephew cannot expect any
</p>
<p>satisfactory result from either, but by the use of
</p>
<p>means which, I am sure, his delicacy would not pet
</p>
<p>mit him to use-I mean the public use of a lady's
</p>
<p>name. Some people have a taste for that, and in
</p>
<p>other parts of the world it is all the rage. I thank
</p>
<p>God that the fashion has not reached us. A woman,
</p>
<p>exposed to notoriety, learns to bear and then to love
</p>
<p>it. When she gets to that, she should go North;
</p>
<p>write books; patronize abolition societies; or keep a
</p>
<p>boarding-school. She is no longer fit to be the wife
</p>
<p>of a Virginia gentleman. But there is no need to
</p>
<p>say this. You, Trevor, were your nephew so inclined,
</p>
<p>would never permit the name of your daughter to be
</p>
<p>thus profaned."
</p>
<p>"I could oppose nothing to it," said Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>" but my displeasure. And though I might not wish
</p>
<p>it, could I have a right to be displeased with Douglas for vindicating himself from a charge which has
</p>
<p>grown out of his gallant defence of her? Think of
</p>
<p>the favorable standing of his family; observe the
</p>
<p>rapid promotion of his brother; and consider whether
</p>
<p>a punctilio of this sort should bind him to renounce
</p>
<p>prospects so flattering?"

</p>
<p>But what prospect is there? Colonel Trevor is per.
</p>
<p>haps a favorite at court. So, doubtless, is your brother
</p>
<p>But he is not a man whose fidelity is either to be
</p>
<p>bought or rewarded; and he and his will be, at any
</p>
<p>moment, postponed and sacrificed to the mercenary,
</p>
<p>who might desert, and even mutiny for want of pay.
</p>
<p>IIere is proof of it.

<p>" Look at the shallow pretext for this proposed
</p>
<p>court-martial. The President is pleased to say that
</p>
<p>he believes your brother; but that there are those
</p>
<p>who do not. Who are they? Who can they be?
</p>
<p>Who is there, worthy to be accounted among his

</p>
<p>Don't you see that your brother, whose attachment
</p>
<p>to the Union, based as it is on principle, may be
</p>
<p>safely trusted, is to have his feelings wounded to
</p>
<p>gratify the mortified pride of the elder Baker, and

<p>When Douglas's letters were finished, he would

<p>gladly have put them into Delia's hands before he

<p>until the rest of the company have left it. They are
</p>
<p>continually meeting in passages, and on staircases;
</p>
<p>and, in pleasant weather, they are almost sure to stroll
</p>
<p>into the garden about the same time. But let the
</p>
<p>decisive word be once spoken, and all is changed.
</p>
<p>Then, bless us, how we blush! and how we glide
</p>
<p>through half-open doors, and slip away aroune

<p>corners!
</p>
<p>Still it will happen, as love makes people restless,
</p>
<p>that both will rise early, and so meet in the parlor
</p>
<p>before others are awake. And then there is "the
</p>
<p>dewy eve and rising moon," and the quiet walk, "by
</p>
<p>wimpling burn and leafy shaw;" but as to a private
</p>
<p>word in the bustling hours of the day, that is out of
</p>
<p>the question.

</p>
<p>"Dear Delia," said Douglas, "I understand you

<p>already too late."
</p>

</p>
<p>He now gave her the full history of the affair, and
</p>
<p>succeeded in convincing her that his standard of
</p>
<p>honor was even higher than she had imagined. If
</p>
<p>she requited him for her unjust suspicions with a
</p>
<p>kiss, he never told of it. Perhaps she did. For
</p>
<p>although, according to the refinements of the Yankees, kissing was in very bad taste, yet the northern
</p>
<p>regime had not reached the banks of the Roanoke.
</p>
<p>The ladies there still continued to walk in the steps
</p>
<p>of their chaste mothers-safe in that high sense of
</p>
<p>honor which protects at once from pollution and
</p>
<p>suspicion.
</p>
<p>It is true, that when a people become corrupt, they
</p>
<p>must learn to be fastidious, and invent safeguards to
</p>
<p>prevent vice, and blinds to conceal it when it is to be
</p>
<p>indulged. Duennas are necessary in Spain. They
</p>
<p>are at once the guarantee of a lady's honor, and the
</p>
<p>safe instruments of her pleasures. Black eunuchs
</p>
<p>perform the same functions in Turkey. In the northern factories, boys and girls are not permitted to work
</p>
<p>together. In their churches, the gentlemen and ladies
</p>
<p>do not sit in the same pew. What a pitch of refine.

</p>
<p>ON the evening of the third day from that of
</p>
<p>wvhich I have just been speaking, the President of
</p>
<p>the United States was sitting alone in a small room
</p>
<p>in his palace, which, in conformity to the nomenclature of foreign courts, it had become the fashion to
</p>
<p>call his closet. The furniture of this little apartment
</p>
<p>was characterized at once by neatness, taste, and
</p>
<p>convenience. Without being splendid, it was rich
</p>
<p>and costly; and, in its structure and arrangement,
</p>
<p>adapted to the use of a man, who, devoted to business, yet loved his ease. The weariness of sedentary application was relieved by the most tasteful
</p>
<p>and commodious variety of chairs, couches, and sofas,
</p>
<p>while the utmost ingenuity -was displayed in the
</p>
<p>construction of desks, tables, and other conveniences
</p>
<p>for reading and writing. In the appearance of the

<p>distinguished personage, to whose privacy I have
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>133
</p>
<p>introduced the reader, there was a mixture of
</p>
<p>thought and carelessness very much in character
</p>
<p>with the implements of business and the appliances
</p>
<p>for ease and comfort which surrounded him. He
</p>
<p>occasionally looked at his watch, and at the door,
</p>
<p>with the countenance of one who expects a visitor;
</p>
<p>and then throwing himself against the arm of his
</p>
<p>sofa, resumed his disengaged air. That something
</p>
<p>was on his mind was apparent. But, interesting
</p>
<p>as the subject might be, it did not seem to touch
</p>
<p>hint nearly. His whole manner was that of a man
</p>
<p>who is somewhat at a loss to know what may be best
</p>
<p>for others, but finds full consolation in knowing precisely what is best for himself.
</p>
<p>As the events of the last ten years make it probable that none of my younger readers have ever
</p>
<p>seen the august dignitary of whom I speak, and as
</p>
<p>few of us are like to have occasion to see him in
</p>
<p>future, a particular description of his person may
</p>
<p>not be unacceptable. Though far advanced in life, he
</p>
<p>was tastily and even daintily dressed, his whole costume being exactly adapted to a diminutive and
</p>
<p>dapper person, a fair complexion, a light and brilliant blue eye, and a head which might have formed
</p>
<p>a study for the phrenologist, whether we consider
</p>
<p>its ample developments or its egg-like baldness.
</p>
<p>The place of hair was supplied by powder, which
</p>
<p>his illustrious example had again made fashionable.

<p>The revolution in public sentiment which, commencing sixty years ago, had abolished all the privi

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>leges of rank and age; which trained up the young
</p>
<p>to mock at the infirmities of their fathers, and
</p>
<p>encouraged the unwashed artificer to elbow the
</p>
<p>duke from his place of precedence; this revolution
</p>
<p>had now completed its cycle. While the sovereignty
</p>
<p>of numbers was acknowledged, the convenience oi
</p>
<p>the multitude had set the fashions. But the reign
</p>
<p>of an individual had been restored, and the taste of
</p>
<p>that individual gave law to the general taste. Iad
</p>
<p>he worn a wig, wigs would have been the rage.
</p>
<p>But as phrenology had taught him to be justly
</p>
<p>proud of his high and polished forehead, and the
</p>
<p>intellectual developments of the whole cranium, he
</p>
<p>eschewed hair in all its forms, and barely screened
</p>
<p>his naked crown from the air with a light covering
</p>
<p>of powder. He seemed, too, not wholly unconscious
</p>
<p>of something worthy of admiration in a foot, the
</p>
<p>beauty of which was displayed to the best advantage by the tight fit and high finish of his delicate
</p>
<p>slipper. As he lay back on the sofa, his eye rested
</p>
<p>complacently on this member, which was stretched
</p>
<p>out before him, its position shifting, as if unconsciously, into every variety of grace. Returning from
</p>
<p>thence, his glance rested on his hand, fair, delicate,
</p>
<p>small, and richly jewelled. It hung carelessly on
</p>
<p>the arm of the sofa, and the fingers of this, too, as if
</p>
<p>rather from instinct than volition, performed sundry evolutions on which the eye of majesty dwelt
</p>
<p>with gentle complacency.

</p>
<p>This complacent reverie was frequently broken by

</p>
<p>tlhe sound of the door-bell. At such moments, the
</p>
<p>Presidclent would raise his head with a look of awakened expectation, which subsided instantly; until,
</p>
<p>Iy frequlent repetition, it called up some expression
</p>
<p>of displeased impatience. At last, the sound was
</p>
<p>echoed by a single stroke, which rang froIn what
</p>
<p>looked like a clock within the room. He imnmedi
</p>
<p>ately sat erect, assuming an air of dignified and
</p>
<p>complacent composure, suited to the reception of a
</p>
<p>respected visiter.
</p>
<p>The door opened, and the gentleman in waiting
</p>
<p>bowed into the room a person who well deserves a
</p>
<p>particular description, and then withdrew.
</p>
<p>The individual thus introduced was a gentleman
</p>
<p>whose age could not be much short of seventy. In
</p>
<p>person he had probably been once nearly six feet
</p>
<p>high, but time had at once crushed and bowed him
</p>
<p>to a much shorter stature. Indeed, the stoop of his
</p>
<p>shoulders, the protrusion of the neck, and the projecting position of the chin, made together that
</p>
<p>peculiar complex curvature which brings the top of
</p>
<p>the cape of the coat exactly against the top of the
</p>
<p>head. The expression of his countenance was, at
</p>
<p>once, fawning and consequential. His face had
</p>
<p>been originally something between round and
</p>
<p>square. It was now shortened by the loss of his
</p>
<p>teeth. The muscular fulness of youth had not
</p>
<p>been replaced by any accession of fat, nor had the
</p>
<p>skin of his face shrunk, as it often does, on the

<p>retiring flesh. The consequence was, that his
</p>
<p>136
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>cheeks hung down in loose pouches, and all his
</p>
<p>features, originally small and mean, seemed involved in the folds of his shrivelled and puckered
</p>
<p>skin. His voice was harsh and grating, and the
</p>
<p>more so from an attempt at suavity in the tones,
</p>
<p>which produced nothing more than a drawling pro.
</p>
<p>longation of each word. Thus, though he spoke
</p>
<p>slowly, the stream of sound flowed continually from
</p>
<p>his lips, reminding the hearer of the never-ending
</p>
<p>chant of the locust.
</p>
<p>As the President rose and gracefully advanced to
</p>
<p>welcome him, he shuffled forward as if wishing to
</p>
<p>prevent the honor thus done him, while the increased
</p>
<p>curve of his back and the eager humility of his upturned countenance, betokened the prostration of his
</p>
<p>spirit in the presence of the dispenser of honor and
</p>
<p>emolument. Having bowed himself on the hand
</p>
<p>which had been graciously extended to him, he
</p>
<p>remained standing on the floor as if unmindful of
</p>
<p>repeated invitations to be seated. The President had
</p>
<p>not yet so entirely forgotten the manners which once
</p>
<p>distinguished him as a most accomplished gentleman,
</p>
<p>and was not at first aware of the necessity of seating
</p>
<p>himself before his deferential guest. At length, he
</p>
<p>resumed his place on the sofa, and then the other, with
</p>
<p>a new prostration, which seemed to apologize for sitting in the presence of majesty, followed his example.
</p>
<p>lie did not, indeed, presume to share the sofa, though
</p>
<p>invited to do so, but took his place on a seat equally

</p>
<p>137
</p>
<p>the luxury of the chaise longue was lost on him. He
</p>
<p>felt that to lean against the back or arm would be
</p>
<p>quite unbecoming, and sat as nearly erect as he could,
</p>
<p>in that precise posture which indicates a readiness to
</p>
<p>spring to the feet and do the bidding of a superior.
</p>
<p>"I had begun to despair of seeing you this evening, my dear sir," said the President, in a tone at once
</p>
<p>kind and reproachful. "I had given orders that I
</p>
<p>should be denied to all but you."
</p>
<p>" You do me great and undeserved honor," replied
</p>
<p>the other, "but I  "
</p>
<p>" I wished to speak to you in private," continued
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Buren, not noticing the interruption, "of a

<p>matter which deeply interests us both. Here is a letter

</p>
<p>doubtful whether the last step which I took in regard
</p>
<p>to that young man, Trevor, is quite such as should
</p>
<p>have been taken."
</p>
<p>He then took from a bundle of papers, one which
</p>
<p>he read as follows:

<p>" SIR: I have just learned that charges of a serious
</p>
<p>nature have been made against Lieutenant Trevor,
</p>
<p>which, it seems, grow out of certain occurrences to

</p>
<p>affair, to which I allude, has not been truly reported

<p>to testify, will place the transaction in its true light.
</p>
<p>Were Lieutenant T. at Washington, I should not lay
</p>
<p>these papers before you, without authority from him.
</p>
<p>As it is. I trust I do no more than my duty by him,
</p>
<p>and by your Excellency, in furnishing such evidences
</p>
<p>of the real facts of the case, as may aid you in deciding on the course to be pursued in regard to it.
</p>
<p>"It may be proper to add, that, having acted as
</p>
<p>Lieutenant T.'s friend on the occasion, these documents were left in my possession in that character. It
</p>
<p>is this same character, in which I feel it especially my
</p>
<p>duty to step forward as the guardian of his honor and
</p>
<p>interests.

<p>Having read this letter aloud, the President, without comment, placed in the hands of his guest a

<p>bundle of papers. It is only necessary to tell the

<p>reader that they were copies of the same documents

</p>
<p>139
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Buren now threw himself back upon the
</p>
<p>sofa, and fixed his eye on the face of his companion
</p>
<p>with an expression which betokened some concern,
</p>
<p>not unmixed with a slight enjoyment of the perplexity
</p>
<p>with which the purblind old man pored over the
</p>
<p>papers. Indeed, his uneasiness could hardly have
</p>
<p>escaped the observation of a casual spectator. He
</p>
<p>shifted his seat; he read; then wiped his spectacles,
</p>
<p>and read again; then wiped his brow; and having
</p>
<p>gone through all the documents, again took them up
</p>
<p>in order, and read them all over again. When, at
</p>
<p>length, he had extracted all their substance, he turned
</p>
<p>on the President a perplexed and anxious look, and
</p>
<p>remained silent.
</p>
<p>At length, the latter spoke. "I fear we have made
</p>
<p>an unlucky blunder in this business, my dear sir,"
</p>
<p>said he.
</p>
<p>"I fear so too, sir," said the other. "But I beg
</p>
<p>leave to assure your Excellency that the information
</p>
<p>I took the liberty to communicate was a simple and
</p>
<p>exact statement of what I learned from my son,

<p>which, I trust, your Excellency will see is in nowise
</p>
<p>contravened by these documents. I certainly was not

<p>apprised of the provocation which, it is here said,

<p>was offered to a lady under Lieutenant Trevor's protection."

</p>
<p>have no right to complain that proceedings have been
</p>
<p>instituted to inquire into a matter which, even thus

<p>explained, places his loyalty in no very favorable
</p>
<p>light. My concern is, lest the prosecution of this
</p>
<p>investigation should lead to results undesirable to
</p>
<p>you.")' I understand your Excellency," replied the honorable Mr. Baker. " The object of this communication
</p>
<p>is to convey a covert intimation that, if proceedings
</p>
<p>against Lieutenant Trevor are not stayed, he will revenge himself by endeavoring to dishonor my son. I
</p>
<p>never brought him up to be the'butcher of a silk
</p>
<p>button,' and don't wonder that his notions of gallantry, &c. &c., do not exactly square with those of these
</p>
<p>preux chevaliers."
</p>
<p>" That view of the subject is doubtless quite philosophical," said the President; "and if you regard
</p>
<p>it in that light, it will remove all difficulty out of the
</p>
<p>way."
</p>

</p>
<p>should be quite willing to expose my son to the pain

</p>
<p>they manifestly have been, by men who have learned

<p>to quarrel by the book, and contrived on purpose to

<p>shut the door against inquiry. I dare say he would

</p>
<p>141
</p>
<p>"The misfortune is," replied the President, "that
</p>
<p>I have already caused an intimation to be given to
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Trevor that it may be necessary to order
</p>
<p>a court-martial, unless he thinks proper to demand a
</p>
<p>court of inquiry. Either way, the whole affair must
</p>
<p>come out."
</p>
<p>" Is there no other alternative?" asked the anxious
</p>
<p>father. "Could not these papers be suppressed?
</p>
<p>There is no other authentic.evidence of these facts."
</p>
<p>" Unfortunately," said the President, to whom ha-'itual intercourse with the base had made the feeling
</p>
<p>if contempt so familiar that he repressed it without
</p>
<p>iifficulty, " unfortunately these papers are but copies.
</p>
<p>The originals are doubtless in the hands of Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Whiting, whose honor cannot be questioned, and probably they will be farther verified by the handwriting
</p>
<p>of your son."
</p>
<p>"What then can be done?" asked the honorable
</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, in a state of unutterable perplexity. Receiving no answer, he sat musing, with the restless
</p>
<p>and fidgeting air of a man who seeks in vain for some
</p>
<p>starting point for his thoughts. He was at length
</p>
<p>roused from his reverie by two strokes of the bell,
</p>
<p>which issued from the clock-case at the President's
</p>
<p>back. The signal was answered by the touch of a
</p>
<p>hand-bell, which stood on a table near him. The door
</p>
<p>opened. The gentleman in waiting entered, advanced
</p>
<p>to the table, laid a packet of letters before the President, and withdrew in silence.

<p>"THERE is something in this business," said the

<p>President, after a silence of a few minutes, "which

<p>I do not well understand. I was not prepared to
</p>
<p>find Lieutenant Trevor so ready to resign, and still

<p>less to receive his letter of resignation through the

<p>hands of his father, without one word of expostulation to his son, or to me. He does not even intimate
</p>
<p>any the least regret at the event. What can this

<p>mean?"
</p>
<p>"It does not at all surprise me," said Mr. Baker.

<p>numerous, and so hedge him around and beset him on
</p>
<p>every side, that they have kept him standing still the
</p>
<p>greater part of his life. When he moves, it would
</p>
<p>take an expert mathematician to calculate the result
</p>
<p>of all the compound forces which act upon him, and
</p>
<p>to decide certainly what course he might take."
</p>
<p>"HIow happens it, then," asked the President,
</p>
<p>"that I have always found him so loyal and faithful
</p>
<p>in his devotion to me?"
</p>
<p>".Because he identified your Excellency in his own

<p>mind with the Union, to which he is determined to sacrifice every thing else. But now that disunion has come,
</p>
<p>and the question is whether Virginia shall adhere to the

</p>
<p>and how he may work it, no man can anticipate. Hence

<p>meant when I said that his principles were too many.

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>145
</p>
<p>"None," replied Baker; " I do but speak from my
</p>
<p>knowledge of the man. I do not think him capable
</p>
<p>of that gratitude for the many favors he and his family
</p>
<p>have received which should bind him indissolubly to
</p>
<p>your Excellency's service."
</p>
<p>"It is well, at least," said the President, " that one
</p>
<p>of his sons, on whom most of those favors have been
</p>
<p>lavished, is made of different materials. The principles of Colonel Trevor are exactly of the right sort;
</p>
<p>or, as you would say, my dear sir, they are of just the
</p>
<p>tight number. Could I obtain any information of the
</p>
<p>father's movements, which might give me just cause
</p>
<p>to doubt him, I would take occasion to show the difference I make between the faithful and the unstable.
</p>
<p>I would refuse to receive this young man's resignation, and order a court-martial immediately. I mistake if the father would not be glad to extricate him
</p>
<p>from the difficulty, by renouncing some of these fantastic notions which he dignifies by the name of principles."
</p>
<p>"I beseech your Excellency," said Baker, forgetting his envious spleen against the virtuous and upright friend of his early youth, in his alarm at the
</p>
<p>mention of the court-martial; " I beseech your
</p>
<p>Excellency not to understand me as preferring any
</p>
<p>charge against Mr. Hugh Trevor. He is an excellent
</p>
<p>man, who well deserves all the favors he has received,
</p>
<p>and will, doubtless, merit many more. I pray that
</p>
<p>what I have said may not at all influence you to any

</p>
<p>The tact of the President at once detected the
</p>
<p>revulsion of Baker's feelings, and the cause. Indeed,
</p>
<p>he well knew both the men. He was aware that all
</p>
<p>that had been said of Mr. Trevor was essentially true.
</p>
<p>He had, therefore, the more highly prized his friendship, as one of the brightest jewels in his crown.
</p>
<p>He had taught his advocates and minions to point to
</p>
<p>him as one, whose support it was known would not
</p>
<p>be given to any man but from a sense of duty. He
</p>
<p>was himself not so dead to virtue as not to respect it
</p>
<p>in another; and his favorable dispositions toward Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor, and the benefits bestowed on his family, had
</p>
<p>more of respect and gratitude than commonly mingled
</p>
<p>in his feelings or actions. Of Baker, he had rightly
</p>
<p>formed a different estimate. He found him in the
</p>
<p>shambles, and had bought and used him. To Baker,
</p>
<p>too, Mr. Trevor appeared only as one, in whose life
</p>
<p>there was a "daily beauty that made his ugly;" and he
</p>
<p>had seen, with malignant envy, the honors and emoluments for which he had toiled through all the drudgery
</p>
<p>of a partisan, freely bestowed on the unasking and
</p>
<p>unpretending merit of a rival. Gladly would he have
</p>
<p>improved the distrust, which he saw had entered into
</p>
<p>the mind of the President, had he not been warned
</p>
<p>that the first effect of it might be to press an inquiry
</p>
<p>which must eventuate in the irreparable dishonor of
</p>
<p>his own son.

</p>
<p>While he sat meditating on these things, and subduing his malice to his fears and his interest, the doorbell sounded; the single stroke from the clock-case
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>147
</p>
<p>echoed the sound; the door opened; and a new character appeared on the stage.
</p>
<p>No person whose name appears in this history better deserves a particular description than he who now
</p>
<p>entered. Fortunately I am saved the necessity of
</p>
<p>going into it, by having it in my power to refer the
</p>
<p>reader to a most graphic delineation of his exact pro
</p>
<p>totype in person, mind, manners, and principles.
</p>
<p>In Oliver Dain, or Oliver le Diable, as he was
</p>
<p>called, the favorite instrument of the crimes of that
</p>
<p>remorseless tyrant Louis XI., he had found his great
</p>
<p>exemplar. The picture of that worthy, as drawn
</p>
<p>by Sir Walter Scott, in Quentin Durward, is the
</p>
<p>most exact likeness of one man ever taken for
</p>
<p>another. It is not even worth while to change the
</p>
<p>costume; for although he did not appear with a barber's apron girded around his waist, and the basin
</p>
<p>in his hands, it was impossible to look upon him
</p>
<p>without seeing that his undoubted talents, and the
</p>
<p>high stations he had filled, still left him fit to be
</p>
<p>employed in the most abject and menial services.
</p>
<p>This happy compound of meanness, malignity,
</p>
<p>treachery, and talent, was welcomed by the President with a nod and smile at once careless and
</p>
<p>gracious. At the sight of him, Mr. Baker made
</p>
<p>haste to rise, and bustled forward to meet and salute
</p>
<p>him with an air, in which, if there was less of servility, there was more of the eagerness of adulation
</p>
<p>than he had displayed toward the President himself.

</p>
<p>The earnest inquiries of Mr. Baker after his health
</p>
<p>148
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&c., &c., were answered with the fawning air of one
</p>
<p>who feels himself much obliged by the notice of a
</p>
<p>superior, and he then turned to the President as if
</p>
<p>waiting his commands. These were communicated
</p>
<p>by putting into his hands the letters of Mr. Hugh
</p>
<p>Trevor and his son, which he was requested to read.
</p>
<p>WVhile he read, the President, turning to Mr. Baker,
</p>
<p>said: " While I thought of ordering a court-martial
</p>
<p>on the case of Lieutenant Trevor, I deemed it advisable to have all his military transactions looked into,
</p>
<p>intending, if any thing were amiss, to make it the
</p>
<p>subject of a distinct charge." Then, turning to the
</p>
<p>other, he added: "You have, I presume, acquainted
</p>
<p>yourself with the state of the young man's accounts."
</p>
<p>" I have, sir," was the reply. "They have been
</p>
<p>all settled punctually."
</p>
<p>" Then there is nothing to prevent the acceptance
</p>
<p>of his resignation?"
</p>
<p>"Nothing of that sort, certainly, sir. But has
</p>
<p>your Excellency observed the date of this letter of
</p>
<p>his? You may see that he does not date from his
</p>
<p>father's house. I happen to know this place, Truro,
</p>
<p>to be the residence of that pestilent traitor, his uncle.
</p>
<p>Now, if the charge be well founded, I submit to
</p>
<p>your Excellency whether the offender should be permitted to escape prosecution by resigning. If it be
</p>
<p>not exactly capable of being substantiated, yet his
</p>
<p>readiness to resign on so slight an intimation renders his disaffection at least probable, and his date

</p>
<p>renders it nearly certain. Might it not then be
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>149
</p>
<p>advisable to retain the hold we have upon him?
</p>
<p>The court-martial being once ordered, additional
</p>
<p>charges might be preferred; and I much mistake
</p>
<p>the temper of the country where he is, if he does
</p>
<p>not furnish matter for additional charges before the
</p>
<p>month of April passes by."
</p>
<p>"Why the month of April?" asked the President.
</p>
<p>" Because then the elections come on; and there
</p>
<p>is little doubt that exertions will be made to obtain
</p>
<p>a majority in the Legislature of men disposed to
</p>
<p>secede, and join the southern confederacy. In that
</p>
<p>county, in particular, I am well advised that such
</p>
<p>exertions will be made. A hen-hearted fellow has
</p>
<p>been put forward as the candidate of the malcontents, who can be easily driven from the canvass by
</p>
<p>his personal fears. Let the affair once take that
</p>
<p>shape, and immediately the fantastic notions of what
</p>
<p>southern men call chivalry, which infest the brain
</p>
<p>of this old drawcansir, will push him forward as a
</p>
<p>candidate. I had made some arrangements which,
</p>
<p>with your Excellency's approbation, I had proposed
</p>
<p>to carry into effect for accomplishing this result, in
</p>
<p>the hope of bringing him into collision with the law
</p>
<p>of treason, and so getting rid at once of a dangerous
</p>
<p>enemy. Now, if this young man's resignation be
</p>
<p>rejected, and a court-martial be ordered, the part he
</p>
<p>will act in the affair can hardly fail to be such as to
</p>
<p>make his a ball-cartridge case."

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>President, "but on farther reflection, my good
</p>
<p>friend Mr. Baker is led by feelings of delicacy to
</p>
<p>wish to withdraw his charges. I am loth to deny
</p>
<p>any thing to one who merits so much at my hands,
</p>
<p>but still there are difficulties in the way which will
</p>
<p>not permit us to pursue that course. The acceptance
</p>
<p>of this resignation will effectually remove them, and
</p>
<p>indirectly gratify the wish of Mr. Baker. Now,
</p>
<p>what do you advise?"
</p>
<p>In the act of asking this question, the President
</p>
<p>shifted his position so suddenly as to call the
</p>
<p>minion's attention to the motion. He looked up
</p>
<p>and saw his master's face averted from Mr. Baker,
</p>
<p>and thought he read there an intimation that he
</p>
<p>should press his former objection. This he therefore
</p>
<p>did, expressing his reluctance to give advice unfavorable to the wishes of one so much respected as Mr.
</p>
<p>Baker, and highly complimenting the delicacy of his
</p>
<p>scruples.
</p>
<p>"But suppose," asked the President, " we press
</p>
<p>the passage of the law authorizing a court to sit
</p>
<p>here for the trial, by a jury of this District, of
</p>
<p>offences committed in Virginia. In that case,
</p>
<p>should our young cock crow too loud, we might find
</p>
<p>means to cut his comb without a court-martial."
</p>
<p>"That Congress will pass such a law cannot be
</p>

</p>
<p>151
</p>
<p>"I am bound to respect them," replied the President, meekly. " But I really do not see the grounds
</p>
<p>for them in such a case as this. I beg pardon,
</p>
<p>Judge Baker. I know it is against rule to ask a
</p>
<p>judge's opinion out of court. But I beg you to
</p>
<p>enlighten me so far as to explain to me what are the
</p>
<p>scruples which the bench are supposed to feel on this
</p>
<p>subject. I make the inquiry, because I am anxious
</p>
<p>to accept this young fellow's resignation, if, in doing
</p>
<p>so, I shall not lose the means of punishing the
</p>
<p>offences which there is too much reason to think he
</p>
<p>meditates. To try him in Virginia would be vain.
</p>
<p>Indeed, I doubt whether your court could sit there
</p>
<p>in safety."' "I fear it could not," replied the Judge, "and
</p>
<p>have therefore no difficulty in saying, that the necessity of the case should overrule all constitutional
</p>
<p>scruples. I have no delicacy in answering your
</p>
<p>Excellency's question out of court. It is merely an
</p>
<p>inquiry, which I hope is superfluous, whether I
</p>
<p>would do my duty. I trust it is not doubted that I
</p>
<p>would; and should I be honored with your Excellency's commands in that behalf, I should hold
</p>
<p>myself bound to execute them. To speak more
</p>
<p>precisely: should the court be established, and I
</p>
<p>appointed to preside in it, I should cheerfully do

<p>so."

</p>
<p>Some desultory conversation now arose on various
</p>
<p>topics, more and more remote from public affairs.
</p>
<p>On these Mr. Baker would have been glad to descant, and perhaps to hear the thoughts of the President and his minister. But all his attempts to
</p>
<p>detain them from talking exclusively of lighter
</p>
<p>matters were effectually baffled by the address of
</p>
<p>the former. All this was so managed as to wear

<p>out the evening, without giving the gentleman the

<p>least reason to suspect that he was in the way, or
</p>
<p>that the great men who had seemed to admit him

</p>
<p>As the door closed behind him, the countenance
</p>
<p>of the President relaxed into a smile, indicative of
</p>
<p>great satisfaction and self-applause, along with an
</p>
<p>uncontrollable disposition to merriment. The smile
</p>
<p>soon became a quiet laugh, which increased in
</p>
<p>violence without ever becoming loud, until he lay
</p>
<p>back against the arm of the sofa, and covered his
</p>
<p>face with his handkerchief. At length, his mirth
</p>
<p>exhausted itself, and he sat erect, looking at the
</p>
<p>Minister with the countenance of one about to make
</p>
<p>some amusing communication. But he waited to be
</p>
<p>spoken to, and remained silent. His minion took
</p>
<p>the hint, and addressing himself to what he supposed
</p>
<p>to be passing in his master's mind, said: " I beseech
</p>
<p>your Excellency to tell me by what sleight, by what

</p>
<p>been made to slip as easily as a hangman's noose?

</p>
<p>"How can you ask such a question?" said the
</p>
<p>President, with mock gravity. "Did you not heat
</p>
<p>the elaborate and lucid argument by which the
</p>
<p>Judge prooved incontestably that it could not be

<p>unconstitutional to do his duty? The wonder is how

<p>they ever contrived to make a difficulty. Surely

<p>none who shall ever hear that demonstration can

</p>
<p>" But may I be permitted to ask by what means
</p>
<p>such a flood of light has been poured upon his mind?
</p>
<p>But yesterday he was dark as the moon in its perihelion. Has the golden ray of additional favors
</p>
<p>again caused its face to shine?"
</p>
<p>"No," said the President.
</p>
<p>"No new emoluments to him or his?"
</p>
<p>"None at all," was the laughing answer.
</p>
<p>" No new honors.?"
</p>
<p>"None; but the honor of doing additional duty,
</p>
<p>for the first lime in his life, without additional compensation."
</p>
<p>" In the name of witchcraft, then, what has
</p>
<p>wrought upon him?"
</p>
<p>"That I shall not tell you," said the President,
</p>
<p>still laughing. "That is my secret. That part of
</p>
<p>any art you shall never know. It is one of the jokes
</p>
<p>that a man enjoys the better for having it all to himself. I keep it for my own diversion. It is a sort

</p>
<p>worth a course at a German university. But come!
</p>
<p>There is a time to laugh, and a time to be serious.
</p>
<p>What do you propose on the subject of these Virginia elections?"
</p>
<p>"I propose," said the Minister, "to distribute
</p>
<p>some five hundred men in certain counties, with the
</p>
<p>dispositions of which I have made myself acquainted,
</p>
<p>to preserve order at the elections, as we should say
</p>
<p>to the uninitiated; but in plain English, to control
</p>
<p>them. They will succeed in this, or provoke violence. Either way, we carry our point. We prevail in the elections, or we involve the members elect
</p>
<p>in a charge of treason. I think we may trust Judge
</p>
<p>Baker for the rest. The more dangerous of our enemies will thus fall under the edge of the law, and
</p>
<p>the less efficient, if not left in a minority, will be
</p>
<p>powerless for want of leaders."
</p>
<p>"But the scene of action," said the President, "is
</p>
<p>close to the line. The offenders may escape into
</p>
<p>North Carolina, and from thence keep up a communication with their friends. They may even venture to Richmond at a critical moment, and effect
</p>
<p>their great purpose, or they may adjourn to some
</p>
<p>place of greater security."
</p>
<p>"It will certainly be necessary," said the Minister,
</p>
<p>"to guard against that, by increasing the number of
</p>
<p>troops at the seat of government. Besides, if we can but
</p>
<p>get one day to ourselves, their chance of legislative

<p>"Then, with so many points in the game in our

</p>
<p>favor," replied the President, " we have but to play
</p>
<p>it boldly and we must win. It shall go hard, too,
</p>
<p>if, in the end, we do not make this superfluous State
</p>
<p>Legislature, this absurd relic of imperium in
</p>
<p>imperio, abolish itself. At all events, the course of
</p>
<p>conduct which they will necessarily pursue, must
</p>
<p>sink the body in public estimation, and dispose the

<p>people to'acquiesce in the union of all power in the

<p>-nmunicipal corporations, exercising such powers as
</p>
<p>we choose to grant."
</p>
<p>Some farther conversation ensued, in which details
</p>
<p>were settled. A minute was made of the points at
</p>
<p>which troops should be stationed; the number of
</p>
<p>men to be placed at each; and the corps from which
</p>
<p>they were to be drawn. It was left to the Minister
</p>
<p>to fix on proper persons to command each party, and
</p>
<p>to devise instructions as to the part to be acted. In
</p>
<p>some places it was proposed simply to awe the elections by the mere presence of the military. In some,
</p>
<p>to control them by actual or threatened violence.
</p>
<p>In others, insult was to be used, tumult excited,
</p>
<p>resistance provoked, and dangerous men drawn in,

<p>to commit acts which might be denounced as

<p>criminal. Having thus possessed himself of his

</p>
<p>"The only truly wise man that I know in the
</p>
<p>world," said the President, looking after him. "The
</p>
<p>only one who knows man as he is; who takes no
</p>
<p>account of human virtue, but as one form of human
</p>
<p>weakness. In his enemies, it gives him a power
</p>
<p>over them which he always knows how to use. In
</p>
<p>his instruments, he desires none of it. Why cannot
</p>
<p>I profit more by his instruction and example? Fool
</p>
<p>that I am! I will try to practise a lesson."
</p>
<p>He rang the bell, and directed that the Minister
</p>
<p>should be requested to return.
</p>
<p>He had not yet left the palace, and soon re-appeared. As he entered, the President said: " This
</p>
<p>young Trevor I He has talent, has he not?"
</p>
<p>" Talent of every kind," said the Minister.
</p>
<p>" That he has a superabundance of what fools call
</p>
<p>honor and gallantry, I happen to know. I suppose
</p>
<p>his other virtues are in proportion?"
</p>
<p>" I suspect so, from the example of the father, and
</p>
<p>all I can learn of the son."
</p>
<p>" Can you then doubt of his ultimate course? or
</p>
<p>even that of his father Do you doubt that if the
</p>
<p>standard of rebellion is once raised, the young man
</p>
<p>will be found fighting under it, with the old man's

<p>himself before his spurs have acquired their full

</p>
<p>"Nothing could be more judicious, and nothing
</p>
<p>easier."
</p>
<p>" How would you go about it?"
</p>
<p>"Let him have a letter neither accepting nor
</p>
<p>rejecting. Intimating the necessity of farther investigation of his accounts, &c., &c., before we let him
</p>
<p>off, and requiring him, for the convenience of farther
</p>
<p>correspondence, to remain at the place from whence
</p>
<p>his letter is dated. Keep him fretted in this until
</p>
<p>the election is near at hand, and, a day or two
</p>
<p>before, let him receive a letter accepting his resignation. My life upon it, he will spring to his
</p>
<p>destruction like a bow, when the string is cut, that
</p>
<p>snaps by its own violence."
</p>
<p>"You are right," said the President. "That will
</p>
<p>do. Much will depend on the style of that letter.
</p>
<p>You have your hands too full to be troubled with
</p>
<p>such things, or I should ask you to do what no man

<p>can do so well. But you have your pupils, who
</p>
<p>have learned of you to say what is to be said, so as
</p>
<p>just to produce the desired effect, and no other."
</p>
<p>The instrument of the royal pleasure again withdrew. Again the President looked after him, and
</p>
<p>said, musingly: "Were I not myself, I would be
</p>
<p>that man. I should even owe him a higher compliment could one be devised, for, but for him, I had

</p>
<p>Could he have made himself what I am, he would

<p>have done so. He has but fulfilled my destiny, and

<p>I his. He has made me what I alone was capable
</p>
<p>of becoming, and I, in turn, have made him all that
</p>
<p>he ever can be. I owe him nothing, therefore; and

<p>should he ever be guilty of any thing like virtue,
</p>
<p>there is nothing to hinder me from lopping off any
</p>
<p>such superfluous excrescence, even if his head should
</p>
<p>go with it. But he is in no danger on that score.
</p>
<p>If he held his life by no other tenure, his immortality
</p>
<p>would be sure."
</p>
<p>While the master thus soliloquized, the minion
</p>
<p>was wending his way home, to the performance of
</p>
<p>the various duties assigned him. Our present business is with the letter to Douglas alone. The pen

</p>
<p>"I am farther charged to remind you, that resignation, when resorted to for the purpose of evading
</p>
<p>military prosecution, is always deemed little short
</p>
<p>of a confession of guilt. In most cases, this produces no embarrassment. The loss of the commission is generally an adequate punishment; and it is,
</p>
<p>in such cases, well to leave the conscience and the
</p>
<p>fears of the accused to inflict that punishment, ratifying the sentence by prompt acceptance of the
</p>
<p>proffered resignation.
</p>
<p>" But this does not hold in all cases. The President bids me say that he is not yet prepared how to
</p>
<p>act in one of so serious a character as this. this
</p>
<p>regard for your father is the source of this perplexity. He requires time to reflect how far he can
</p>
<p>reconcile to his public duty that tenderness to the
</p>
<p>feelings of a friend which makes him desirous, if
</p>
<p>possible, to stay inquiry by accepting your resignation. Under other circumstances, he would not
</p>
<p>hesitate to reject it, and instantly order a courtmartial, as the proper means of bringing to prompt
</p>
<p>and merited punishment an offence which, I am
</p>
<p>charged to say, he considers as virtually admitted
</p>
<p>by your attempt to evade a trial; when, if innocent,
</p>
<p>you would certainly wish an investigation, in order

<p>to establish your innocence.

<p>This letter Mr. Trevor read with calm and quiet

<p>attention, carefully weighing every phrase and word,
</p>
<p>while Douglas, perceiving the handwriting of his
</p>
<p>friend Whiting on the back of another, hastily tore
</p>
<p>it open, and read as follows:

<p>own case, which we are not displeased to have done

<p>he received and read it. You will therefore judge
</p>
<p>my surprise at being required, to-day, to forward
</p>
<p>the unprecedented document which accompanies
</p>
<p>this.
</p>
<p>" I am guilty of no breach of duty when I assure
</p>
<p>you that that paper is sent, as it imports on its face,'by the order of the President.' The Secretary is
</p>
<p>not responsible even for one word of it. The very
</p>
<p>handwriting is unknown to me, and it was sent to
</p>
<p>the department precisely in the shape in which you
</p>
<p>receive it.
</p>
<p>"Knowing what I did, I should have doubted
</p>
<p>whether it had not been surreptitiously placed
</p>
<p>among other papers transmitted to us at the same
</p>
<p>time. But there is no room for mistake. It came
</p>
<p>accompanied by the most authentic evidence that
</p>
<p>it had been read and approved by the President
</p>
<p>himself.
</p>
<p>"I find myself placed in a delicate situation.
</p>
<p>Here is an avowal of full faith in a charge disproved
</p>
<p>by my positive assurance: a charge that no one can

</p>
<p>I do not, therefore, ask you to advise me, for I would
</p>
<p>not do so, unless prepared to give to your advice
</p>
<p>more weight than I can allow it. It could add
</p>
<p>nothing to the convictions of my own mind, and the
</p>
<p>indignant writhings of my own wounded honor; and
</p>
<p>even these, God help me, I am forlced to resist!
</p>
<p>"This affair has, as yet, made no noise. It is
</p>
<p>not at all known of in the army; but I think I can
</p>
<p>assure you of the sympathy of all whose regard you
</p>
<p>value, and their unabated confidence in your honor

<p>and fidelity. I shall make it my business, be the

<p>consequence to myself what it may, to do you ample

<p>justice. Indeed, my indignation makes me so reckless of consequences, that, apart fromn the necessity
</p>
<p>of bearing insult from one from whom no redress
</p>
<p>can be demanded, I am not sure that I do not envy
</p>
<p>your lot.
</p>
<p>" That your resignation will eventually be accepted, cannot be doubted. What is the motive to
</p>
<p>this letter, it is hard to say; but certainly it does
</p>
<p>not proceed from such a disposition as would willingly afford you an opportunity of triumphant
</p>

</p>
<p>Having read this second letter, Douglas passed it
</p>
<p>also to his uncle, and, rising, hastily left the house.
</p>
<p>It is needless to scan the thoughts that accompanied
</p>
<p>him in his ramble. They were bitter and fierce
</p>
<p>enough. But he had learned, in early life, to master
</p>
<p>his feelings, and never to venture into the presence
</p>
<p>of others until the mastery had been established.
</p>
<p>Many a weary mile did he walk that day before his
</p>
<p>purpose was accomplished, but having at last effected
</p>
<p>it, he returned.
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor had found leisure, in the mean time,
</p>
<p>to scrutinize the letters in whole and in detail, and
</p>
<p>had, at length, arrived at a conclusion not far from
</p>
<p>the truth. He was prepared, therefore, to welcome
</p>
<p>the return of Douglas with a cheerful smile; and
</p>
<p>instead of adding to his excitement by any expression of resentment or disgust, endeavored to calm
</p>
<p>and soothe him. For such conduct the young man
</p>
<p>was altogether unprepared. Aware of his uncle's
</p>
<p>wishes in regard to him, he had looked for something different, and had endeavored to fortify his
</p>
<p>mind against such impressions as he feared he might
</p>
<p>attempt to make on it. The great principles by
</p>
<p>which he had been taught to govern himself were

</p>
<p>matter, and like his father, he determined, if possible, to think and act. But he had no idea that in
</p>
<p>this attempt he would receive countenance and even
</p>
<p>aid from his uncle. It may, therefore, be readily

<p>IT was settled, on consultation, that he should
</p>
<p>abide the final event; and that, until then, nothing
</p>
<p>of what had passed should be made known to his
</p>
<p>father, to Delia, or to any of the family but Mrs.
</p>
<p>Trevor. In her he had learned to seek an adviser,
</p>
<p>and in her he always found one-sincere, sagacious,
</p>
<p>and discreet. Mr. Trevor, as I have said, was not a
</p>
<p>man from whose opinions his wife would probably
</p>
<p>dissent, but he had not contented himself to command her blind, unreasoning acquiescence. He had
</p>
<p>trained her mind; he had furnished her with materials for thought; and he had taught her to think.
</p>
<p>She was in all his confidence, and he consulted with
</p>
<p>her habitually on plans which involved the welfare
</p>
<p>of his country. From her, therefore, the history of
</p>
<p>Douglas's entanglement with the authorities at;

</p>
<p>the family it was a profound secret; and, as Mr.

<p>interrupt the enjoyments of the genial season which
</p>
<p>168
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>invited them to seek amusement out of doors. By
</p>
<p>means of this, the impatience of Douglas was diverted, and he found it quite easy to accomplish his
</p>
<p>philosophical determination to wait the result of the
</p>
<p>affair in patience.
</p>
<p>When, at length, a week had been allowed him to
</p>
<p>fret his heart out, the deferred acceptance of his
</p>
<p>resignation was received. This, too, was couched in
</p>
<p>phrases of decorous and studied insult. But he had
</p>
<p>learned to think that the dastard blow struck by one
</p>
<p>who screens himself behind the authority of office,
</p>
<p>inflicts no dishonor. The interval, which had been
</p>
<p>intended to give his passions time to work themselves into a tempest, had subdued them. Reason
</p>
<p>had taken the ascendant, and though his reflections
</p>
<p>had not been much more favorable to the authority
</p>
<p>of his former master, than the promptings of his
</p>
<p>resentment, they were much less suited to his present purpose. He was effectually weaned; divested
</p>
<p>of all former prepossessions, and ready to yield to
</p>
<p>the dictates of calm, unbiassed reason. He sought
</p>
<p>his uncle, and with a quiet and cheerful smile, handed
</p>
<p>him the letter.
</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Trevor read it, he exclaimed,'Thank God! you are now a freeman."
</p>
<p>"I am truly thankful for it," replied Douglas,
</p>
<p>"though I feel as if I shall never lose the mark of
</p>
<p>the collar which reminds me that I have been a

<p>"When the bondage reaches to the mind," said
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor, "it is not felt."
</p>
<p>"And was mine enslaved," asked Douglas, " when
</p>
<p>my thoughts were as free as air "
</p>
<p>"Their prison was airy," replied the old gentle
</p>
<p>man, "and roomy, and splendidly fitted up. But
</p>
<p>look at the President's letters, and see the penalties
</p>
<p>you might have incurred, had your freedom of
</p>
<p>thought rambled into such opinions as many of your
</p>
<p>best friends entertain."
</p>
<p>" Still," replied Douglas, " the penalty would have
</p>
<p>attached, not to the opinion, but to the expression
</p>
<p>of it."
</p>
<p>" And do you think your mind would work without
</p>
<p>constraint, in deciding between opinions which it
</p>
<p>might be unsafe to express, and those which would
</p>
<p>be regarded as meritorious!"
</p>
<p>"I can, at least, assure you that such a thought
</p>
<p>as that never occurred to me."
</p>
<p>" But it occurred to your friends. It tied my

<p>Now that I am free to speak, let me ask, wherein
</p>
<p>would have been the criminality of expressing the

<p>opinions imputed to you? "

</p>
<p>Douglas colored high, and, after a long pause,
</p>
<p>said: " I see that I have been swinging in a gilded
</p>
<p>cage, and mistook its motions for those of my own
</p>
<p>will. I see it, and again respond cordially to your

<p>Heretofore, in all my intercourse with you, my

</p>
<p>as the maximum of evil."
</p>

</p>
<p>is, whether you shall continue to bear these wrongs,
</p>
<p>or seek the remedy offered by an invitation to join
</p>
<p>the Southern Confederacy. The evils of which you
</p>
<p>speak would certainly not be increased by such a
</p>
<p>step. We might weaken the North, but not ourselves. As to standing armies, here we have one
</p>
<p>among us. The motive which that danger presented
</p>
<p>is now reversed in its operation. While we remain
</p>
<p>as we are, the standing army is fastened upon us.
</p>
<p>By the proposed change we shake it off. Then, as to
</p>
<p>dissension, if there is no cause of war now, there
</p>
<p>would be none then. Indeed the only cause would

<p>be removed, and it would be seen that both parties

<p>having once taken place, there remains nothing to

<p>all this military array that I see Are no hostile

<p>As Mr. Trevor had intimated, the next day was
</p>
<p>the day for the election of members to the State

<p>Legislature. The old gentleman, in spite of his
</p>
<p>infirmities, determined to be present. He ordered

<p>his barouche, and provided with arms both the servant who drove him, and one who attended on
</p>
<p>horseback. He armed himself also with pistols and a
</p>
<p>dirk, and recommended a like precaution to Douglas.
</p>
<p>"You must go on horseback," said he. "It may

<p>enable you to act with more efficiency on an emergency. At all events, were you to drive me, I

</p>
<p>175
</p>
<p>cool, and leave me to fight my own battles. Prudence and forbearance are necessary for you. As
</p>
<p>to me, I have nothing to hazard. The measure of
</p>
<p>my offences is full already. I have sinned the unpardonable sin, and although there is no name for it
</p>
<p>in the statute book, I have no doubt if they had me
</p>
<p>before their new Court of High Commission at Washinyton, your special friend, Judge Baker, would find
</p>
<p>one."
</p>
<p>" Why do you call him my special friend?" asked
</p>
<p>Douglas.
</p>
<p>" Because I have means of being advised of what
</p>
<p>is doing among our rulers, and know that he was at
</p>
<p>the bottom of the whole proceeding against you.
</p>
<p>Therefore, I warn you to be prudent to-day. Depend upon it, if you can be taken in a fault, he will
</p>
<p>find means'to feed fat his grudge' against you."
</p>
<p>On reaching the election ground, the stars and
</p>
<p>stripes were seen floating above the door of the
</p>
<p>court-house, which was still closed. A military
</p>
<p>parade was "being enacted" for the amusement
</p>
<p>of the boys and cake-women, and the uniform
</p>
<p>showed that the men were regulars in the service
</p>
<p>of the United States. They were twenty or thirty in
</p>
<p>number, all completely armed and equipped. As
</p>
<p>soon as Mr. Trevor appeared, they were dismissed
</p>
<p>from parade, the door was thrown open, and they
</p>
<p>rushed into the house. Presently after, it was proclaimed that the polls were opened.

<p>As Mr. Trevor approached the door, Douglas
</p>
<p>176
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>observed that a multitude of persons, who before
</p>
<p>had been looking on, in silent observance of what was
</p>
<p>passing, advanced to salute him, and, falling behind
</p>
<p>him, followed to the court-house. On reaching the
</p>
<p>door, they found it effectually blocked up by half a
</p>
<p>dozen soldiers, who stood in and about, as if by
</p>
<p>accident and inadvertence. But the unaccommodating stiffness with which each maintained his position, left no doubt that they were there by design.
</p>
<p>They were silent, but their brutish countenances
</p>
<p>spoke their purpose and feelings. Mr. Trevor might
</p>
<p>have endeavored in vain to force his passage, had
</p>
<p>not the weight of the crowd behind pressed him
</p>
<p>through the door. In this process he was exposed
</p>
<p>to some suffering, but made no complaint. The
</p>
<p>effect appeared only in the flush of his check, and
</p>
<p>the twitching of his features. The blood of Douglas
</p>
<p>began to boil, and, for the first time in his life, the
</p>
<p>uniform he had so long worn was hateful in his
</p>
<p>sight.
</p>
<p>On entering the house, they were nearly deafened
</p>
<p>with the din. It proceeded from quite a small
</p>
<p>number, but they made amends for their deficiency
</p>
<p>in this respect, by clamorously shouting their h1urras
</p>
<p>for the President, and his favored candidate. Besides the soldiery, there were present the sheriff,
</p>
<p>who conducted the election, and some twenty or
</p>
<p>thirty of the lowest rabble. On the bench were two

<p>candidates. The countenance of one of those was

</p>
<p>flushed with insolent triumph. The other looked

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>177
</p>
<p>pale and agitated. He was placed between his
</p>
<p>competitor and a subaltern officer of the United
</p>
<p>States army. He seemed to have been saying somne
</p>
<p>thing, and at the moment when Mr. Trevor and his
</p>
<p>party entered, was about to withdraw.
</p>
<p>Meeting him at the foot of the stair leading down
</p>
<p>from the bench, that gentleman asked him the
</p>
<p>meaning of what he saw; to which he answered
</p>
<p>that he had been compelled to withdraw. The
</p>
<p>meeting of these two gentlemen had attracted
</p>
<p>attention, and curiosity to hear what might pass
</p>
<p>between them, for a moment stilled the manytongued clamor. Mr. Trevor took advantage of the
</p>
<p>temporary silence, and said aloud: "You have been
</p>
<p>compelled to withdraw. Speak out distinctly, then,
</p>
<p>and say that you are no longer a candidate."
</p>
<p>"Fellow-citizens," responded the other, in the
</p>
<p>loudest tones his tremor enabled him to command,
</p>
<p>"I am no longer a candidate."
</p>
<p>" AND I AM A CANDIDATE," cried Mr. Trevor in
</p>
<p>a voice which rang through the house. "I am a
</p>
<p>candidate on behalf of VIRGINIA, her RIGHTs, and
</p>
<p>her SOVEREIGNTY."
</p>
<p>The shout from behind the bar, at this annunciation, somewhat daunted the blue coats, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor was lifted to the bench on the shoulders of
</p>
<p>his friends; when the officer was heard to cry out,
</p>

</p>
<p>looked at him imploringly. He was set down by
</p>
<p>the side of the officer, and, leaning on the shoulder
</p>
<p>of Douglas, thus addressed him"I shall say nothing, sir," said he, " to the sherifi
</p>
<p>about his duty. He is the judge of that, and he
</p>
<p>knows that, without my consent, he has no right to
</p>
<p>close the polls before sunset. Unless compelled by
</p>
<p>force, he will not do it. He shall not be compelled
</p>
<p>by force; and, if force is used, I shall know whence
</p>
<p>it comes. Now mark me, sir; I am determined
</p>
<p>that this election shall go on, and that peaceably.
</p>
<p>If force is used, it must be used first on me. Now,
</p>
<p>sir, my friends are numerous and brave, and well
</p>
<p>itrmed, and I warn you that my fall will be the
</p>
<p>s;ignal of your doom. Not one of your bayoneted
</p>
<p>c-rew would leave this house alive. As to you, sir,.1 keep my eye upon you. You stir not from my
</p>
<p>side, till the polls are closed. I hold you as a hostage for the safety of the sheriff. If an attaek is
</p>
<p>made on him, I shall know you for the instigator.
</p>
<p>And, more than that, sir, I know he is disposed to
</p>
<p>do his duty, and will not think of closing the polls
</p>
<p>prematurely. A menace addressed to him may
</p>
<p>escape my ear. If he offers to do it, if he does but
</p>
<p>open his mouth to declare that the polls are closed,
</p>
<p>I blow your brains out on the spot."
</p>
<p>Suiting the action to the word, he, at the same
</p>
<p>moment, showed a pistol, the finish of which gave
</p>
<p>assurance that it would not miss fire. The officer

<p>ment to withdraw; but he found himself hedged in
</p>
<p>by brawny countrymen, who closed around him,
</p>
<p>while every hand was seen to gripe the handle or
</p>
<p>some concealed weapon.
</p>
<p>" Be patient, sir," said Mr. Trevor, " you had no
</p>
<p>business here; but, being here, you shall remain.
</p>
<p>No harm shall be done you. I will. ensure you
</p>
<p>against every thing but the consequences of your
</p>
<p>own violence. Offer none. For if you do but lift
</p>
<p>your hand, or touch your weapons, or utter one word
</p>
<p>to your myrmidons, you die."
</p>
<p>These words were uttered in a tone in which,
</p>
<p>though loud enough to be heard by all, there was as
</p>
<p>much of mildness as of firmness. Indeed his last
</p>
<p>fearful expression was actually spoken as in kindness.
</p>
<p>The officer seemed to take it so, and quietly seated
</p>
<p>himself.
</p>
<p>Not so the rival candidate. He rose, with a great
</p>
<p>parade of indignation, saying: "Let me pass, at
</p>
<p>least. This is no place for me."
</p>
<p>" Do you mean to leave us, sir?" said Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>with great courtesy.
</p>
<p>"I do," said the other. " To what purpose should
</p>
<p>I remain?"
</p>
<p>"Do you then decline? Are you no longer a
</p>
<p>candidate?"
</p>
<p>" I am; but I will not remain here beset by armed
</p>
<p>violence."
</p>
<p>"Will you leave one to represent you?"

<p>farther part in the matter. I shall do nothing, and
</p>
<p>consent to nothing. When the law closes the poll,
</p>
<p>it will be closed."?'
</p>
<p>Saying this, he withdrew, and Mr. Trevor observed
</p>
<p>that, as he went out, he spoke aside to the sergeant
</p>
<p>of the company, who followed him from the house.
</p>
<p>Soon after, the men, one by one, dropped off, and all
</p>
<p>at lengthl disappeared.
</p>
<p>The election now went on peaceably, and nearly
</p>
<p>every vote was cast for Mr. Trevor. But it did not
</p>
<p>escape his observation that there were persons present whom he knew to be hostile to him, and devoted
</p>
<p>to the rulers at Washington, who yet did not vote.
</p>
<p>He saw the motive of this conduct, but determined
</p>
<p>to make it manifest to others as well as himself, and
</p>
<p>to expose the disingenuous and unmanly artifice
</p>
<p>which he saw his enemies were using against him.
</p>
<p>Catching the eye of a well dressed man he said,
</p>
<p>" You have not voted, I think, Mr. A -?"
</p>
<p>"I have not," was the answer, "and I don't mean
</p>
<p>to vote."
</p>
<p>"I beg that you will, sir," said Mr. Trevor. " I
</p>
<p>know you to be my enemy, personal as well as political; but I sincerely wish the name of every voter
</p>
<p>in the county to appear on the poll book, though
</p>
<p>my defeat should be the consequence.".
</p>
<p>"It may be so, sir," replied the other; "but I
</p>
<p>shall not vote at an election, controlled by force, and

</p>
<p>"I do not understand you, sir," said Mr. Trevor.
</p>
<p>" Am I to infer that the presence of the military here
</p>
<p>is under the avowed orders of their master?"
</p>
<p>"I dare say," replied the other, " that Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Johnson will show you his orders, if you will condescend to look at them."
</p>
<p>" I will do so, with great pleasure," said Mr. Trevor, "and promise myself great edification from the
</p>
<p>perusal."
</p>
<p>"I will read them, sir," said the officer, taking a
</p>
<p>paper from his pocket, which he read accordingly in
</p>
<p>the following words:
</p>
<p>"As there is reason to believe that evil disposed
</p>
<p>persons design to overawe or disturb the election of
</p>
<p>members of the Legislature from the county of,
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Johnson will attend at the day and place
</p>
<p>of election with the troops under his command, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of preserving order. Should his authority be opposed, he is, if permitted to do so, to make
</p>
<p>known that he acts by the command of the President, to the end that all who may be disposed to
</p>
<p>resist him, may be duly warned that in so doing
</p>
<p>they resist the authority of the United States, and
</p>
<p>take heed lest they incur the penalties of the law."
</p>
<p>"Why, this is well," said Mr. Trevor. "And it
</p>
<p>is to give color and countenance to a charge of resistance to the authority of the United States, that you,
</p>
<p>Mr. A-, refuse to vote."
</p>
<p>"No, sir," replied A-; "it is because I never

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>"Be it so," said Mr. Trevor. "I perceive your
</p>
<p>drift. Go, then, and tell your master that the means
</p>
<p>used to vindicate the freedom of election were used
</p>
<p>to control it. Go, sir, and show that you are as
</p>
<p>much an enemy to truth and honor as to me."
</p>
<p>To this A_- made no reply, and soon after withdrew. Indeed, hardly any person remained but the
</p>
<p>friends of Mr. Trevor, and it was obvious that the
</p>
<p>result of the election was not to be changed by any
</p>
<p>votes which could be given. The necessity of keeping open the poll till sunset was, nevertheless, imperious. But the scene became dull and irksome.
</p>
<p>Douglas, therefore, proposed that his uncle should
</p>
<p>return home.
</p>
<p>" By no means," said he. " You don't understand
</p>
<p>this game. Should we disband, the sheriff would be
</p>
<p>required, at the peril of his life, to make a false return. But he shall have his will. Mr. Sheriff, shall
</p>
<p>I withdraw also?"
</p>
<p>" No I no! For God's sake, stay, sir!" exclaimed
</p>
<p>the alarmed sheriff; "and either see me home, or
</p>
<p>take me home with you. I have not the influence
</p>
<p>which makes you safe in the midst of enemies, and
</p>
<p>am not ashamed to say that I fear my life."
</p>
<p>"I will protect you, then, sir," said Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>" until you have made out your return, and given
</p>
<p>your certificate. When these are done, I hope you
</p>
<p>will be safe."
</p>

</p>
<p>the captive officer, who looked on ruefully, while
</p>
<p>an occasional vote was given at long intervals. At
</p>
<p>length, Mr. Trevor observed that some of the voters
</p>
<p>were about to withdraw. He therefore rose, and
</p>
<p>begged them to remain.
</p>
<p>"This business is not over," said he. "It is not
</p>
<p>for nothing that the polls are to be kept open until
</p>
<p>sunset, when all who have not voted have withdrawn. An attack on the sheriff or myself is certainly intended. Perhaps on both. I beseech you,
</p>
<p>therefore, not to disperse, but to see us both safe
</p>
<p>to my house. When once among my own people,
</p>
<p>I will take care of him and myself. I am sorry,
</p>
<p>sir," continued he, addressing the officer, " that the
</p>
<p>movements of your friends make it necessary to
</p>
<p>detain you longer than I had intended. You must
</p>
<p>be a hostage for us all, until this day's work is
</p>
<p>over. But assure yourself of being treated with
</p>
<p>all courtesy and kindness. Should I even find it
</p>
<p>necessary to compel your company to my own house,
</p>
<p>doubt not that you will receive every attention due
</p>
<p>to an honored guest. I beg you to observe that
</p>
<p>I do not even disarm you. The warning you have
</p>
<p>received is my only security that you will attempt
</p>
<p>no violence."
</p>
<p>This speech was heard in sullen silence by him to
</p>
<p>whom it was addressed. But some conversation
</p>
<p>with others ensued, in which Mr. Trevor took pains
</p>
<p>to enlighten the minds of his hearers in regard to

<p>wearily; the sun went down, and Bernard Trevor
</p>
<p>was proclaimed to be duly; elected.
</p>
<p>Our party now took up the line of march. The
</p>
<p>sheriff and officer were placed in Mr. Trevor's ba.
</p>
<p>rouche; the former by his side the latter in front
</p>
<p>of him, by the side of the driver. A numerous company on horseback surrounded them.
</p>
<p>They were scarcely in motion, before the drum
</p>
<p>was heard, and the regulars were seen advancing to
</p>
<p>meet them in military array. Mr. Trevor immediately commanded the driver to stop,- and draw his
</p>
<p>pistol. Then calling to the servant on horseback, he
</p>
<p>made him station himself, pistol in hand, close to
</p>
<p>the officer. Having made this arrangement, he addressed him:
</p>
<p>"You see your situation, sir. Those fellows would
</p>
<p>not scruple to shoot your master himself at my bidding; and my orders to you both, boys, are, that if
</p>
<p>we are attacked, you are both to shoot this gentleman upon the spot. I shall do the same thing, sir;
</p>
<p>so that between us you cannot escape. Now, sir,
</p>
<p>stand up and show yourself to your men, and speak
</p>
<p>distinctly the words of command that I shall dictate."
</p>
<p>The officer did as he was directed. The advancing
</p>
<p>platoon was halted, and wheeled backward to the side
</p>
<p>of the road; the arms were ordered, and the barouche
</p>
<p>passed on. After passing, a momentary stop was
</p>
<p>made, while the sergeant was ordered to march the

<p>I tell you, my lord fool, that out of this nettle, Danger, we pluck

<p>SHIKBPEARE.
</p>
<p>THE domestic party that we left at the house of
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor were variously affected by the history of
</p>
<p>the occurrences detailed in the last chapter. Arthur
</p>
<p>had been slightly indisposed, and his uncle had made
</p>
<p>that a pretext for keeping him out of harm's way.
</p>
<p>But when he heard what had passed, his spirit was
</p>
<p>roused, and he felt as a soldier who hears the history
</p>
<p>of some well-fought battle where he was not permitted to be present. To Virginia the whole story was
</p>
<p>a subject of wonderment and alarm. The idea that
</p>
<p>her dear uncle, and her dearer brother, had been engaged in an affair where " dirk and pistol" was the
</p>
<p>word, threw her into a flutter of trepidation. She
</p>
<p>could not refrain from asking the former whether he
</p>
<p>would have shot the poor man sure enough; and
</p>
<p>received his affirmative answer with a shudder. The
</p>
<p>feelings of Lucia did not much differ from hers, except in intensity. She had heard too much to be

</p>
<p>wholly unprepared for such things, and her mind
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>187
</p>
<p>was too much accustomed to take its tone from those
</p>
<p>of her mother and sister.
</p>
<p>On these ladies the impression made by the events
</p>
<p>of the day was wholly different. If the countenance
</p>
<p>of Mrs. Trevor was more thoughtful than before, it
</p>
<p>only spoke of higher thoughts. Her eye was brighter,
</p>
<p>her carriage more erect, her step more free, while her
</p>
<p>smile had less, perhaps, of quiet satisfaction, but
</p>
<p>more of hope. The flutter of youthful feelings, and
</p>
<p>the sweeter and more tender thoughts proper to one
</p>
<p>newly betrothed, made the chief difference between
</p>
<p>Delia and her mother. But while Douglas saw in
</p>
<p>the latter all the evidence of those high qualities
</p>
<p>which fit a woman to be not merely the consolation
</p>
<p>and joy of her husband, but his sage adviser and
</p>
<p>useful friend, he saw enough in Delia to show that
</p>
<p>she, in due time, would be to him all that her mother
</p>
<p>was to his uncle.
</p>
<p>A few days afterwards, Mr. B- arrived, and his
</p>
<p>appearance was a signal of joy to the whole family.
</p>
<p>Douglas now, for the first time, discovered that he
</p>
<p>stood in some interesting, though undefined relation
</p>
<p>to them, and especially to his aunt. That there was
</p>
<p>no connexion of blood or marriage he knew, yet the
</p>
<p>feelings of the parties towards each other were mutually filial and paternal. The imposing dignity of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Trevor's manner seemed to be surrendered in
</p>
<p>his presence. Her maiden name of Margaret, which

<p>no other lip but that of her husband would have ventured to profane, was that by which alone he ever

<p>188
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>accosted her, and that generally accompanied with
</p>
<p>some endearing epithet. The girls would sit upon
</p>
<p>his knee, and play familiarly and affectionately with
</p>
<p>his grey locks; while the servants, in the proud
</p>
<p>humility of their attention to his wants and wishes,
</p>
<p>seemed hardly to distinguish between him and their
</p>
<p>beloved and honored master. It was not to:be be
</p>
<p>lieved that the family kept any secrets from, him, so
</p>
<p>that Douglas could not doubt that he was privy to
</p>
<p>his little affair of the heart. And so he was; and his
</p>
<p>manner toward the young man was, from the first,
</p>
<p>that of a near kinsman, hardly differing in any thing
</p>
<p>from that'of. his uncle. As far as coincidence of sentiment and similarity of character could explain this
</p>
<p>close intimacy, it stood explained. Between him
</p>
<p>and Mr. Trevor there were many points of strong
</p>
<p>similitude. But to Mrs. Trevor the resemblance was
</p>
<p>more striking. Age and sex seemed to make the
</p>
<p>only difference between them.
</p>
<p>But, in addition to this domestic relation, which
</p>
<p>embraced every member of the household down to
</p>
<p>the scullion and shoe-black, there was obviouslysome
</p>
<p>understanding between the gentlemen in regard to
</p>
<p>matters of much higher concernment. JIndeed, no
</p>
<p>pains were taken to conceal this fact, though, during
</p>
<p>Mr. B's former visit, Douglas had not been admit.
</p>
<p>ted to any of their consultations but that which concerned himself.
</p>
<p>It was not long before the two were closeted, in

</p>

</p>
<p>message was delivered to Douglas requesting his
</p>
<p>presence.
</p>
<p>"I am the bearer of important intelligence," said
</p>
<p>B  holding out his hand to the youth as he entered;
</p>
<p>"and as it particularly concerns you, as well as your
</p>
<p>uncle, you must perforce consent to become privy
</p>
<p>to our council."
</p>
<p>"I am not sorry to hear it," replied Douglas. "If
</p>
<p>any thing was wanting to banish all reserve between
</p>
<p>us, I would be content to suffer some loss to effect
</p>
<p>that object."
</p>
<p>"I believe you," said B -, " and therefore expect
</p>
<p>you will the less regret an unpleasant circumstance,
</p>
<p>which, without your act or consent, and even in spite
</p>
<p>of you, binds you in the same bundle with us."
</p>
<p>"That was already done," said Douglas. "What
</p>
<p>new tie can there be?"
</p>
<p>" One of the strongest. The union of your name
</p>
<p>with your uncle's in a warrant for high treason from
</p>
<p>the court of high commission at Washington."
</p>
<p>"You speak riddles," said Douglas. "The pnly
</p>
<p>instance in which I ever incurred the displeasure of
</p>
<p>the President, was one which no human ingenuity
</p>
<p>could torture into treason; and certainly my uncle
</p>
<p>had no hand in that."
</p>
<p>"But, having then incurred the displeasure of the
</p>
<p>Government, what if you should since have been

<p>concerned in any matter which might be called

<p>treason?"

</p>
<p>"M, y dear boy," said Mr. Trevor, " the question
</p>
<p>is not of what we have done. Had we actually done
</p>
<p>any thing culpable, there would be no occasion for
</p>
<p>this warrant from Washington. Our own courts,
</p>
<p>And a jury of peers, may be trusted to try the guilty.
</p>
<p>But when men are to be tried for what they have not
</p>
<p>done, then resort must be had to this new court of
</p>
<p>high commission at Washington, and to a jury of
</p>
<p>office-holders."'But where," asked Douglas, "is the warrant of
</p>
<p>which you speak?"
</p>
<p>" That I cannot exactly say," said B. "I am
</p>
<p>not even sure that it is yet in existence. But that it
</p>
<p>is, or will be, is certain. I need not explain to you
</p>
<p>my means of knowledge. Your uncle is acquainted
</p>
<p>with them, and knows that what I tell you is certain.
</p>
<p>The transactions of the election day will be made the
</p>
<p>subject of a capital charge, and it is intended to convey you both to Washington to answer it there. I
</p>
<p>am come to advise you both of this, that you may
</p>
<p>determine what course to pursue."
</p>
<p>"My course is plain," said Douglas. "To meet
</p>
<p>the charge, and refute it."
</p>
<p>" Are you aware," said B- , " who is the Judge of
</p>
<p>this court of high commission?"
</p>
<p>"I think I have somehow understood that it is
</p>
<p>Judge Baker."

<p>before the court was constituted, he and other judges

</p>

</p>
<p>were consulted, and declared it to be so grossly unconstitutional that no judge would preside in it?"
</p>
<p>"I see that so it should be declared, but did not
</p>
<p>know that such opinion had been given."
</p>
<p>"Yet so it was. Now where, do you think, the
</p>
<p>considerations were found by which the honorable
</p>
<p>gentleman's honorable scruples were overcome? Of
</p>
<p>course, you cannot conjecture. You would find it,
</p>
<p>all too late, if you, by placing yourself in his power,
</p>
<p>afforded him an opportunity of gratifying the malice
</p>
<p>of his son, without exposing his cowardice and
</p>
<p>meanness. I see you doubt my means of knowledge.
</p>
<p>Your uncle told me nothing of young Whiting's
</p>
<p>communication to the President. Yet I knew of it.
</p>
<p>I know," continued B, hot regarding the amazement of Douglas, "that, but for that letter, you
</p>
<p>would not have been permitted to resign; and that
</p>
<p>Judge Baker's scruples about presiding in this new
</p>
<p>court were overcome by hushing up the inquiry,
</p>
<p>which would have dishonored his son, and substituting a proceeding which should number you among
</p>
<p>the victims of his power, without implicating the
</p>
<p>name of his son. As to my means of knowledge,
</p>
<p>when knaves can get honest men to be the instruments of their villany, they may expect not to be
</p>
<p>betrayed. Until then, they must bear the fate of all
</p>
<p>who work with sharp tools."

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>court constituted for the sole purpose of entertaining
</p>
<p>prosecutions which cannot be sustained elsewhere, is
</p>
<p>to be notified of a sentence already passed. To obey
</p>
<p>such a summons, is to give the neck to the halter.
</p>
<p>The question is, then, what is to be done to evade it.
</p>
<p>Our friend B- proposes that your brother anddsister
</p>
<p>be sent home,, and that you and I, and my family,
</p>
<p>withdraw to Carolina. How say you?"
</p>
<p>"I have the same difficulty that I had, the other
</p>
<p>day, about tendering my resignation. But, in this
</p>
<p>instance, it appears with more force. To fly from
</p>
<p>justice is always taken as evidence of conscious
</p>
<p>guilt."
</p>
<p>"About that," said Mr. Trevor, LI feel small
</p>
<p>concern on my own account, as I certainly mean to
</p>
<p>commit what all who deny the sovereignty of Virginia
</p>
<p>will call high treason."
</p>
<p>"Then why not take up arms at once? I have
</p>
<p>much misunderstood appearances, since I have been
</p>
<p>here, if the means, not of evading, but resisting this
</p>
<p>attack, are not already organized.":
</p>
<p>"The time is not yet ripe for action,": said. Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor. "Had it been so, I should not have waited
</p>
<p>until my own head was in jeopardy, before striking
</p>
<p>the blow. Nor should my own personal danger
</p>
<p>precipitate it." -
</p>

<p>are heated by the late violent invasion of the elective

</p>
<p>presented than the sight of a citizen seized as a traitor,
</p>
<p>and dragged away in chains, to answer, before an unconstitutionail tribunal, for maintaining this franchise?"
</p>
<p>"Are you then prepared to resist, at the point of
</p>
<p>the bayonet, this unconstitutional warrant, as a thing
</p>
<p>void and of no authority?"
</p>
<p>"I am," replied Douglas, with energy..' And I
</p>
<p>will say more," said he, speaking with solemn earnestness. "I have seen enough to make my duty plain;
</p>
<p>and I am prepared to go as far as you, yourself, in
</p>
<p>asserting and maintaining the sovereignty of Virginia
</p>
<p>at every hazard."
</p>
<p>"That being the case," said B, "as you will not
</p>
<p>disagree about the end, you must not differ about the
</p>
<p>means, nor lose time discussing them. -We are not
</p>
<p>thinking of this subject for the first time. We
</p>
<p>see the whole ground, and act under the influence of
</p>
<p>considerations which we have no time to detail. Are
</p>
<p>you then, my young friend, prepared to give us so
</p>
<p>much of your confidence as this? We say to you,'Go with us where we go, and trust our assurance
</p>
<p>that when we have leisure to explain all, you will.
</p>
<p>find our plan the best.' Are you content? Are you
</p>
<p>now ready to carry into execution our matured plan,
</p>
<p>so far as it has been disclosed to you, trusting all the
</p>
<p>details to us? Remember-if you say yes to this,
</p>
<p>we stop no more to deliberate or explain until we are
</p>
<p>in a place of safety. Until then, you place yourself
</p>
<p>under orders; and you have learned how to obey.
</p>
<p>How say you? Are you content?"

<p>Douglas paused, reflected a minute or two, and
</p>
<p>then, extending a hand to Mr. B -, and one to his
</p>
<p>uncle, said earnestly: "I am; command, and I will
</p>
<p>obey. But which of you am I to obey?"
</p>
<p>"Mr. B-," said Mr. Trevor, "under whose command I now place myself."
</p>
<p>"Then to business," said B. "Warn your
</p>
<p>brother, at once, of the necessity of returning home
</p>
<p>with your sister, and see that he makes the needful
</p>
<p>preparations for his departure at an early hour tomorrow. The boy's heart will have some hankerings

<p>that will make it necessary for you to look after him,

<p>and urge him to exertion. You, Trevor, must expedite the arrangements for the removal of your

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.
</p>
<p>" I have nursed him at this withered breast," said the old womnt,
</p>
<p>folding her hands on her bosom as if pressing an infant to it; " and
</p>
<p>man can never ken what woman feels for the bairn that she has first
</p>
<p>held to her bosom."

<p>SCOTT.
</p>
<p>POOR ARTHURI B- had predicted too truly
</p>
<p>that his heart would have some hankerings at the
</p>
<p>thought of leaving the house where he had, of late,
</p>
<p>spent so many pleasant hours. It is so long that I
</p>
<p>have said nothing about him, that the reader may
</p>
<p>think him forgotten, or may, himself, have forgotten
</p>
<p>that there was such a person. He had, in truth, no part
</p>
<p>in the transactions of which we have been speaking.
</p>
<p>He was at that time of life when the mind, chameleon-like, takes its hue from surrounding objects.
</p>
<p>He was too young to be advised with, or trusted with
</p>
<p>important secrets. I have already mentioned that,
</p>
<p>on the day of the election, he had been detained at

</p>
<p>home by indisposition. But he had heard of the oc1*
</p>
<p>200
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>currences of that day; and he was, moreover, uncon.
</p>
<p>sciously exposed to influences from every member of
</p>
<p>the fimily, all tending to the same point. Least apparent, but not least efficacious, was that of his cousin
</p>
<p>Lucia. They were of that age when hearts, soft and
</p>
<p>warm, grow together by mere contact. With thought
</p>
<p>of love, but without thinking of it, they had become
</p>
<p>deeply enamored of each other. The thing came
</p>
<p>about so simply and so naturally, that the result alone
</p>
<p>needs to be told.
</p>
<p>They were now to part, and the thought of parting
</p>
<p>first made them both feel that something was the
</p>
<p>matter. They talked of the separation, and Lucia
</p>
<p>shed some tears. Arthur kissed them off, and then
</p>
<p>she smiled; and then she wept again; and then they
</p>
<p>agreed never to forget each other; and so on, till the
</p>
<p>secret was out, and their innocent hearts were fondly
</p>
<p>plighted.
</p>
<p>Such things do not pass unmarked by older eyes.
</p>
<p>The maternal instinct of Mrs. Trevor, and the sagacity
</p>
<p>of her husband, had detected that of which the parties themselves were unconscious. And now, in the
</p>
<p>few hours that they were to remain together, occupied
</p>
<p>as the old people were with important engagements,
</p>
<p>neither the glowing -cheek, the swimming eye, and
</p>
<p>the abstracted look of Lucia, nor the rapt enthusiasm of Arthur's countenance, escaped observation.
</p>
<p>But as no disclosure was made of what had passed,
</p>
<p>their fancied privacy was not invaded by question or

<p>insinuation. They were too young to marry, and secret
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>201
</p>
<p>love is so sweet! Why not let the innocent creatures enjoy the idea that their attachment was not
</p>
<p>suspected? Their friends smiled indeed, but tenderly, not: significantly. To them, they did but
</p>
<p>seem kinder than ever; and that, at a moment when
</p>
<p>they were most: sensible to kindnees, and most ready
</p>
<p>to reciprocate it. In this heart-searching sympathy,
</p>
<p>Arthur found himself indissolubly united to the
</p>
<p>destiny, the Opinions, and the feelings, whatever
</p>
<p>these might be, of those who so loved his dear
</p>
<p>Lucia.
</p>
<p>But I am not writing a love-tale. I am but interested that the reader should understand by. what
</p>
<p>process two principal actors in the scenes of which
</p>
<p>I am about to speak, were diverted from a zealous
</p>
<p>devotion to the authority of the United States, in
</p>
<p>which they had been educated, fto a devotion yet
</p>
<p>more enthusiastic in the cause of Virginia. Enough
</p>
<p>of them has been seen to show that I must be
</p>
<p>anxious to vindicate them from any charge of inconsistency. I trust the reader enters into this feeling,
</p>
<p>and deems them worthy of it. If he requires any
</p>
<p>farther account of the causes which wrought so great
</p>
<p>a change, I have none to give. It was through their
</p>
<p>eyes and hearts that conviction entered. Outrage
</p>
<p>to the laws; outrage to the freedom of election;
</p>
<p>outrage to one respected and beloved; left nothing
</p>
<p>for reason to do. Doubtless much had been said to
</p>
<p>them by their uncle and Mr. B , in explanation

</p>
<p>which had been trampled on by the Federal
</p>
<p>Government. But I am not aware that any ideas
</p>
<p>were presented to their minds on this subject, with
</p>
<p>which the reading public had not been familiar for
</p>
<p>twenty years before, and I shall not repeat them
</p>
<p>here. Let us rather accompany Douglas to Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor's magazine of arms. It was in a garret room,
</p>
<p>where he found Mr. B  busy in the examination
</p>
<p>of arms, and portioning out ammunition, with the
</p>
<p>aid of Jack.
</p>
<p>" You come in good time," said B. "Here is
</p>
<p>work that you understand. Come help me examine
</p>
<p>these arms, and see that they are all clean, dry, and
</p>
<p>well flinted."
</p>
<p>" What do you propose to do with them?" asked
</p>
<p>Douglas, lending a hand to the work.
</p>
<p>"We propose," said B-t, " to arm the negroes in
</p>
<p>defence of their master, in case of need."
</p>
<p>"Bat what need can there be, if we set out for
</p>
<p>Carolina in the morning?"
</p>
<p>"They may be wanted before morning," said
</p>
<p>B , coolly. " Lieutenant Johnson left the county
</p>
<p>on the night of the election, and travelled express to
</p>
<p>Washington. His intelligence was anticipated, and,
</p>
<p>no doubt, the warrants were all ready before he got
</p>
<p>there. I daresay they had a ready-made affidavit
</p>
<p>for him to swear to. This plot was got up so suddenly, that I was hardly advised of it in time. But
</p>
<p>I hope it is not too late. I have no mind to fire the

</p>
<p>203
</p>
<p>peaceably, but, if we do come to blows, I shall take
</p>
<p>care that the blue-coats have the worst of it."
</p>
<p>" You move in this business," said Douglas, " like
</p>
<p>a man not unused to danger. I presume you have
</p>
<p>taken the precaution to warn in the hardy and resolute neighbors, whom I saw stand by my uncle the
</p>
<p>other day."
</p>
<p>"By no means,' answered B. "Were we so
</p>
<p>minded, we could command a force that would demolish any that will be sent against us. But it is
</p>
<p>not desirable to show the strength of our hand. I
</p>
<p>should be glad, if possible, that the temper of the
</p>
<p>people were unsuspected. At the same time, there
</p>
<p>is an exhibition to be made, which will have a good
</p>
<p>effect on friend and foe-I mean an exhibition of
</p>
<p>the staunch loyalty and heart-felt devotion of the
</p>
<p>slave to his master. We must show that that which
</p>
<p>our enemies, and some even of ourselves, consider as
</p>
<p>our weakness, is, in truth, our strength."
</p>
<p>"Is such your own clear opinion? " asked Douglas. " I have lived so long in the North, that I have
</p>
<p>imbibed too many of the ideas that prevail there.
</p>
<p>But, on this point, it appears to me that they must
</p>
<p>be right."
</p>
<p>"You have not lived there long enough," said
</p>
<p>B-, " to forget your earliest and strongest attachnents. You had a black nurse, I presume. Do you
</p>
<p>love her?"
</p>
<p>" My mammy!" exclaimed Douglas; " to be sure

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>on earth, if I did not love one who loves me like a
</p>
<p>mother."
</p>
<p>"And your foster-brother?" asked B; "and
</p>
<p>his brothers and sisters? Do not they, too, love him
</p>
<p>their mother loves so fondly a "
</p>
<p>"I have no doubt they do, especially as I have
</p>
<p>always been kind to them."
</p>
<p>" Fromn these, then, I presume, you would fear
</p>
<p>nothing. Then your brothers and sisters. They, too,
</p>
<p>have their mammies and foster-brethren. Among
</p>
<p>you, you must have a strong hold on the hearts of
</p>
<p>many of your father's slaves. Would they, think
</p>
<p>you, taken as a body, rise against your family? "
</p>
<p>"'I have not the least apprehension that they
</p>
<p>would," replied Douglas.
</p>
<p>" Yet they, thus considered, are one integral part
</p>
<p>of the great black family, which, in all its branches,
</p>
<p>is united by similar ligaments to the great white
</p>
<p>family. You have the benefit of the parental feeling
</p>
<p>of the old who nursed your infancy, and watched
</p>
<p>your growth. You have the equal friendship of
</p>
<p>those with whom you ran races, and played at
</p>
<p>bandy, and wrestled in your boyhood. If sometimes
</p>
<p>a dry blow passed between you, they love you none
</p>
<p>the less for that; because, unless you were differently
</p>
<p>trained from what is common among our boys, you
</p>
<p>were taught not to claim any privilege, in a fight,
</p>
<p>over those whom you treated as equals in play.

<p>These are the filaments which the heart puts out to
</p>
<p>lay hold on what it clings to. Great interests, like
</p>
<p>large branches, are too stiff to twine. These are the
</p>
<p>fibres from which the ties that bind man to man are
</p>
<p>spun. The finer the staple, the stronger the cord.
</p>
<p>You will probably see its strength exemplified before
</p>
<p>morning. There are twenty true hearts which will
</p>
<p>shed their last drop, before one hair of your uncle's
</p>
<p>head shall fall."
</p>
<p>" You present the matter in a new light," said
</p>
<p>Douglas. "I wish our northern brethren could be
</p>
<p>made to take the same view of it."
</p>
<p>" Our northern brethren, as you call them," said
</p>
<p>B-, " never can take this view of it. They have
</p>
<p>not the qualities which would enable them to comprehend the negro character. Their calculating
</p>
<p>selfishness can never understand his disinterested
</p>
<p>devotion. Their artificial benevolence is no interpreter of the affections of the unsophisticated heart.
</p>
<p>They think our friend Jack here to be even such
</p>
<p>as themselves, and cannot therefore conceive that
</p>
<p>he is not ready to cut his master's throat, if there is
</p>
<p>anything to be got by it. They know no more
</p>
<p>of the feelings of our slaves, than their fathers
</p>
<p>could comprehend of the loyalty of the gallant cava

<p>which they have ever seemed to understand us,

<p>has been in the estimate they have made of our

<p>attachment to a Union, the benefits of which have
</p>
<p>all been theirs, the burthens ours. Reverse the
</p>
<p>case, and they would have dissolved the partnership thirty years ago. But they have presumed
</p>
<p>upon the difference between us, and heaped oppression on oppression, until we can bear no more. But,
</p>
<p>when we throw off the yoke, they will still not
</p>
<p>understand us. They will impute to us none but
</p>
<p>selfish motives, and take no note of the scorn and

<p>loathing which their base abuse of our better feelings has awakened. Would they but forbear so
</p>
<p>much as not to force us to hate and despise them,

</p>
<p>Laertes.. Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric.
</p>
<p>SHAKSPEARE.
</p>
<p>WHILE this conversation was going on, the arms
</p>
<p>had been all examined, loaded, and ranged against
</p>
<p>the wall, and due portions of powder and ball allotted
</p>
<p>to each firelock. Their work being nearly completed,
</p>
<p>Douglas was dispatched with some message to his
</p>
<p>uncle. As he descended the stairs, he heard, not
</p>
<p>without a smile, the quick, impatient step of Arthur,
</p>
<p>pacing to and fro the length of a passage leading from
</p>
<p>the front door through the building. Arthur was
</p>
<p>just turning at the end next to the door, when a rap
</p>
<p>on the knocker arrested him. The door was instantly
</p>
<p>opened, and he was heard to ask some one to walk in.
</p>
<p>It was night, and the passage was dark. Arthur con.
</p>
<p>ducted the stranger to the door ot: his uncle's study,
</p>
<p>which was the common reception room, ushered him
</p>
<p>in, drew back, and having closed the door behind
</p>
<p>him, resumed his musing promenade.
</p>
<p>Douglas went on, suspecting nothing. He was not
</p>
<p>aware that the servants had been cautioned against

</p>
<p>admitting strangers; and poor Arthur was not au

<p>209
</p>
<p>fait to what was passing. He entered the room. Ilis
</p>
<p>uncle had risen from his chair in the corner farthest
</p>
<p>from the door, and was standing behind a large table,
</p>
<p>at which he usually wrote. He heard him say:
</p>
<p>"Please to be seated, sir," in a voice between com.
</p>
<p>pliment and command, and with a countenance in
</p>
<p>which courtesy and fierceness were strangely blended.
</p>
<p>As the stranger, not regarding this stern invitation,
</p>
<p>continued to advance, the glare of the old man's eyes
</p>
<p>became fearful, and he laid his hand on a pistol which
</p>
<p>lay on the table before him. " Stand back, sir," said
</p>
<p>he, in a low and resolute tone. "Stand back, on
</p>
<p>your life."
</p>
<p>The stranger wore a long surtout, in which Douglas, dazzled by coming into the light, did not at first
</p>
<p>discover the usual characteristics of an officer's
</p>
<p>undress. It was thrown open in front, and the
</p>
<p>badges of his rank were displayed to Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>who stood before him. He was arrested by Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor's startling words and gesture, and was begin
</p>
<p>ning to speak when Douglas exclaimed: " What does
</p>
<p>this mean? "
</p>
<p>The stranger turned, extended both his arms, and
</p>
<p>Douglas rushed into them.
</p>
<p>"My dear Trevor!" "Mly dear Whiting I" were
</p>
<p>the mutual exclamations of two young men, who had
</p>
<p>long been to each other as brothers.
</p>
<p>"To what on earth," asked Douglas, "do I owe
</p>
<p>this pleasure?"

</p>
<p>"I come," said the other, with a melancholy smile,
</p>
<p>210
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader
</p>
<p>and in the kindest tone, while he still held the hand
</p>
<p>of Douglas, " to make you prisoner."
</p>
<p>Douglas started violently, and tried to disengage
</p>
<p>his hand; but the other held him firmly and went
</p>
<p>on: " Be calm, my dear fellow. I am your friend as
</p>
<p>ever, but yet I do not jest. You are my prisoner, on
</p>
<p>the absurd charge of high treason against the United
</p>
<p>States. My warrant is against you and your uncle.
</p>
<p>As it was thought a military force might be wanted
</p>
<p>to support the arrest, I volunteered myself to receive
</p>
<p>a deputation from the marshal that I might shield you
</p>
<p>both from any indignity. You, on your part, I am
</p>
<p>sure, will do nothing to make my task more painful
</p>
<p>than it is. Is not that gentleman -bless me I where
</p>
<p>is he? Was not that Mr. Bernard Trevor who just
</p>
<p>left the room? "
</p>
<p>"I am Mr. Bernard Trevor," said a voice behind.
</p>
<p>Whiting turned again, and saw Mr. Trevor standing
</p>
<p>where he had been before. He now observed that
</p>
<p>there was a door beside him, at which he had stepped
</p>
<p>out and returned. " I am Mr. Bernard Trevor, sir,
</p>
<p>and am sorry that I cannot welcome, as I would, the
</p>
<p>friend of my nephew. You see that I have no mind
</p>
<p>to leave the room, and I therefore hope you will content yourself to accept my invitation to be seated.
</p>
<p>You say that you wish to shield me from indignity.
</p>
<p>Of course you will not unnecessarily offer what I
</p>
<p>shall feel as such. The hand of authority must not
</p>
<p>be laid on me."

</p>
<p>sir," said Whiting, "and I trust I shall have the
</p>
<p>satisfaction of convincing you that my errand, though
</p>
<p>painful to all of us, is an errand of friendship."
</p>
<p>" I have no doubt of it, sir. I have heard of you
</p>
<p>from my nephew, and from under your own hand,
</p>
<p>in terms that give full assurance of that. I shall be
</p>
<p>happy, therefore, to do by you all the duties of hospitality. I merely ask of you to give your word of
</p>
<p>honor, that, while charged with your present func
</p>
<p>tions, you will be careful not to touch my person."
</p>
<p>" I should be most happy," said the young man,
</p>
<p>" to take by the hand one whom I so highly respect,
</p>
<p>but I find I must forego that pleasure; and I give
</p>
<p>the required pledge most cheerfully."
</p>
<p>The courteous old gentleman now summoned
</p>
<p>Tom, and ordered some refreshment for his guest;
</p>
<p>then throwing into his manner all the frank courtesy
</p>
<p>of a polished Virginian, he led the way in a desul
</p>
<p>tory conversation on all sorts of indifferent subjects.
</p>
<p>Half an hour passed in this way, when Tom appeared
</p>
<p>and summoned the gentlemen to supper.
</p>
<p>"I fear," said Whiting, "I am abusing my authority over my poor fellows without. I have a
</p>
<p>sergeant and half-a-dozen men waiting at the gate,
</p>
<p>on whose behalf I would fain invoke your hospitality. But it would be much more agreeable to me,:f you and my friend Douglas will pass your words

<p>that their aid shall not be necessary, and permit me

<p>to order them back to the next public-house."

<p>I cannot do either; blt, L pray you to postpone the

<p>"How, sir?" exclaimed Whiting. "You surely
</p>
<p>do not mean to try to escape me 2"
</p>
<p>"Nothing is farther from my thoughts, sir," said
</p>
<p>the old man, with a proud smile, "than to try to
</p>
<p>escape you, or permit you to escape me."
</p>
<p>" To escape you, sir! What do you mean?" asked
</p>
<p>Whiting.
</p>
<p>"I mean not to wound your ear with a word I
</p>
<p>would not have endured to have applied to myself.
</p>
<p>I will not say that you are my prisoner; but I will
</p>
<p>say that we will leave this house as free as you
</p>
<p>entered it. Come, my dear sir, while I endeavor to
</p>
<p>requite your courtesy, permit me also to appropriate
</p>
<p>your words, and say, as you said to Douglas, that I
</p>
<p>trust you will not render it necessary to avail ourselves of our superior force."
</p>
<p>"I am not sure you possess that superiority," said
</p>
<p>Whiting; " I have a strong guard without."
</p>
<p>"But they are without, and you are within. Be%ides, you will be readily excused from availing
</p>
<p>yourself of them, when it is known that they are
</p>
<p>prisoners, in close custody."
</p>
<p>"Prisoners!" exclaimed Whiting. "To whom?"
</p>
<p>"To my negroes," said Mr. Trevor.
</p>

</p>
<p>213
</p>
<p>"I am not in the habit, young gentleman," said
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor, in a tone of grave rebuke, " of speaking positively, when I speak by conjecture. MIy
</p>
<p>orders were, that I should not be called to supper
</p>
<p>until they were secured. As to the strangeness of
</p>
<p>the affair," continued he, resuming his cheerful and
</p>
<p>good-humored smile, " think nothing of that. Remember that night is what the negroes call'their
</p>
<p>time of day.' The eagle is no match for the owl in the
</p>
<p>dark. The thing is as I tell you; so make yourself
</p>
<p>easy, and let me have the pleasure of doing the
</p>
<p>duties of hospitality by my nephew's friend. You
</p>
<p>shall not be unnecessarily detained. We must ask
</p>
<p>the pleasure of your company for a three hours' ride
</p>
<p>across the line in the morning. I will there give
</p>
<p>you a clear acquittance against all the responsibility
</p>
<p>you may have incurred, for what you have done, or
</p>
<p>left undone; and, as soon as you return, to restrain
</p>
<p>your men from acts of license, they shall be given
</p>
<p>up to you."
</p>
<p>There was no remonstrating against this arrangement; and Lieutenant Whiting, putting the best
</p>
<p>face he could on the matter, permitted himself to be
</p>
<p>conducted to supper.
</p>
<p>At the head of the supper table stood, as usual,
</p>
<p>Mrs. Trevor. She seemed some six inches higher
</p>
<p>than common, her cheek flushed, her nostril spread,
</p>
<p>her eye beaming; yet with all her high feelings subdued to the duties of hospitality and courtesy. She

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>stately grace of a high-bred-lady, and then her eye
</p>
<p>glanced to her husband with a look of irrepressible
</p>
<p>pride. His glance answered it, and, as they stood
</p>
<p>for a moment facing each other at the opposite ends
</p>
<p>of the table, Whiting felt a sense of admiring awe,
</p>
<p>such as the presence of majesty in fall court had
</p>
<p>never inspired. But this feeling, in a moment,
</p>
<p>passed away, with its cause. The urbanity of the
</p>
<p>gentleman and the suavity of the lady soon removed
</p>
<p>all the painfulness of constraint, and the evening
</p>
<p>passed as it should pass between persons who in
</p>
<p>heart were friends.
</p>
<p>Neither Mr. B  nor Arthur made their appearance. The girls, indeed, were present. The air
</p>
<p>and manner of Delia reflected those of her mother.
</p>
<p>Virginia looked a little alarmed, and Lucia blushing, tender, and abstracted. The interest of the
</p>
<p>realities that surrounded her could not quite dispel
</p>
<p>the visions of excited fancy.
</p>
<p>With these exceptions, which a stranger would not
</p>
<p>observe, everything passed as in the company of an
</p>
<p>invited and cherished guest, and Whiting could not
</p>
<p>be sorry, at heart, that he had been baffled in his
</p>
<p>attempt to disturb so sweet a domestic party. The
</p>
<p>evening wore away not unpleasantly, and he retired
</p>
<p>to rest in the same room with Douglas, to guard hinm,
</p>
<p>or be guarded by him, according as it suited his fancy
</p>
<p>to consider himself or his friend as the other's prisoner.

</p>
<p>THE first words which passed between Mr. Trevor
</p>
<p>and Lieutenant Whiting, had been overheard by Tom,
</p>
<p>who was in the act of leaving the room at the moment. He gave the alarm to his mistress, who hastening to her husband, met him at the door, and just received from him the instructions already mentioned.
</p>
<p>She immediately sent for Mr. B, who, with Jack's
</p>
<p>aid, was in the act of distributing arms and ammunition to the negroes. To him the management of the
</p>
<p>whole affair was committed. No doubt was entertained that Lieutenant Whiting had not come unattended. The first thing to be done was to ascertain
</p>
<p>the force by which he was supported, and the place
</p>
<p>where he had posted his men.
</p>
<p>They, meantime, quietly awaited the return of their
</p>
<p>officer at the great gate, a quarter of a mile from the
</p>
<p>house. Rather as a point of military etiquette than
</p>
<p>from an idea that any precaution was necessary, they
</p>
<p>had stacked their arms in form before the gate, and
</p>
<p>stationed a sentinel, who, with head erect and military

<p>step, walked his post in front of them. They had
</p>
<p>not long been there, before they heard a negro's
</p>
<p>voice, who, as he approached from the house, sung
</p>
<p>merrily a song, of which only the following lines
</p>
<p>could be distinguished:
</p>
<p>" Peep froo de winder; see break o' day;
</p>
<p>Run down to riber; canoe gone away.
</p>
<p>Put foot in water; water mighty cold;
</p>
<p>Hear O'sur call me; hear Missis scold.
</p>
<p>0 dear I my dear I what shall I do?
</p>
<p>My Massa whip me, cause I love you."
</p>
<p>The song ceased, and cuffee advanced in silence,
</p>
<p>but with a heavy swinging step, that rung audibly on
</p>
<p>the hard ground. As soon as his dusky figure began
</p>
<p>to be distinguishable, which was not until he was
</p>
<p>quite near, he was arrested by the sharp challenge of
</p>
<p>the sentry.
</p>
<p>" High!" exclaimed the negro, in a tone of
</p>
<p>amazement and alarm: "Law-Gorramighty I what

<p>"What dat, Massa? I never see such a ting in my

<p>life."
</p>
<p>" Advance I" repeated the sentry, bringing his

<p>piece down with a rattling sound against his right side.

<p>The negro caught the gleam, and, falling flat on his

</p>
<p>The Sergeant now went to him, raised him up,
</p>
<p>calmed his fears, and, as soon as he could be made to
</p>
<p>understand anything, asked if Lieutenant Whiting
</p>
<p>was at the house.
</p>
<p>"I hear'em say, sir, one mighty grand gentleman

<p>I hope they'll be mighty glad to see us, too. I do not

<p>in a tone of sympathy. "I mighty sorry I an't got

<p>nothing to give you."
</p>
<p>"But could not you get something, cuffee Is

<p>before we set you all free from these damned manstealers. How would you like to go with us?"

<p>"Well, cuffee, the old man's in hockley by this

<p>time; and when we march him off in the morning,

<p>you will have nobody to stop you. But bring us the

</p>
<p>" To be sure I do. Bring them along; but mind
</p>
<p>and bring the brandy, at all events."

<p>The negro disappeared, and the soldiers occupied
</p>
<p>themselves in discussing the means of making a profitable speculation on their disposition to leave their
</p>
<p>master. They were still on this topic when they

</p>
<p>brought a chunk of fire; another a basket of apples,
</p>
<p>another one of eggs; a fourth came provided with
</p>
<p>some cold provisions; Jack himself brandished a
</p>
<p>couple of bottles of brandy; and one of his boys
</p>
<p>brought a pail of water and a tin cup. The liquor
</p>
<p>was tasted, approved, paid for, and eagerly swallowed.
</p>
<p>A torch of light wood being kindled, a chaffering
</p>
<p>commenced, interrupted by occasional allusions to the
</p>
<p>interesting subjects of slavery, hard masters, and
</p>
<p>emancipation. The brandy, however, chiefly engaged
</p>
<p>the attention of the soldiers. The sentry, whose duty
</p>
<p>was but formal, was permitted to join, as the guns
</p>
<p>were but a few feet off, just without the gate, which
</p>
<p>stood open. The light of the torch glittered strongly
</p>
<p>on the arms, and seemed to make all things distinct,
</p>
<p>while in fact its unsteady flickering did little more
</p>
<p>than dazzle their eyes. The negro held it aloft, and,
</p>
<p>as if to brighten the flame, occasionally waved it to
</p>
<p>and fro. Suddenly it dropped from his hand into the
</p>
<p>pail of water, and in an instant the blackness of impenetrable darkness shrouded every eye.
</p>
<p>At the same moment, a heavy trampling, as from
</p>
<p>a rush of many feet, was heard without the gate, and
</p>
<p>a shivering clash from the stack of arms, as if it had
</p>
<p>fallen down. The soldiers groped their way towards
</p>
<p>it, feeling where they supposed it to be. They felt
</p>
<p>in vain. They winked hard, as if to free their eyes
</p>
<p>from the blinding impression left by the flaring
</p>
<p>light, then opened them, and looked about. Judge

<p>their astonishment, when, as they began to recover

</p>
<p>221
</p>
<p>their sight, they found themselves surrounded by a
</p>
<p>dusky ring, from which issued a voice, not unlike
</p>
<p>that of their friend Jack, which informed them, in
</p>
<p>good English, that they were prisoners. The prick
</p>
<p>of a bayonet on one or two who endeavored to pass
</p>
<p>through the circle, convinced them that such was
</p>
<p>the fact; and, after a short parley, they permitted
</p>
<p>themselves to be marched off, and safely stowed
</p>
<p>away in a strong outhouse.
</p>
<p>I would not have the reader give the negroes the
</p>
<p>credit of this stratagem. It had been devised by
</p>
<p>B, who knew that he could depend upon the
</p>
<p>address and quick wit of Jack for drawing the
</p>
<p>soldiers into the snare. All that part of the business
</p>
<p>had been left to his own discretion. As soon as he
</p>
<p>had secured the amicable reception of himself and a
</p>
<p>few others, the rest, dividing into two parties, left the
</p>
<p>house, and, crossing the fence at some distance from
</p>
<p>the gate, and on each side of it, advanced stealthily
</p>
<p>toward it. Here they met, and having arranged
</p>
<p>themselves for a sudden rush on the stack of arms,
</p>
<p>an agreed signal was given by a negro who possessed a faculty of mimicking the voices of all animals. As soon as the light was extinguished, the
</p>
<p>necessary number rushed forward to the object on
</p>
<p>which their eyes had been fixed; seized the arms,
</p>
<p>and, falling back, ranged themselves in a half circle
</p>
<p>outside of the gate. Those who had been with the
</p>
<p>soldiers, and who all wore concealed arms, closed

<p>And even there, his eye being big with tears,

<p>SHAKSPEARE.
</p>
<p>AT daylight, all was in motion. Arthur and Vir.
</p>
<p>ginia, being affectionately dismissed by their friends,
</p>
<p>were first upon the road, before Lieutenant Whiting
</p>
<p>was awake. Much of the night had been spent in
</p>
<p>preparations, and long before sunrise Douglas handed
</p>
<p>his aunt and cousins into their carriage. His uncle
</p>
<p>mounted the barouche, with Jack for driver, by whose
</p>
<p>side old Tom was placed; while the lady's maid
</p>
<p>took her seat by her single-minded master, with a
</p>
<p>freedom from which an amalgamationist would have
</p>
<p>drawn the most pleasing inferences. No other white
</p>
<p>person was seen; but a body-guard of twenty negroes,
</p>
<p>well armed, and mounted on plough horses, some
</p>
<p>saddled, some cushioned, and some barebacked,
</p>
<p>surrounded the carriages and baggage-wagon. In

<p>the midst rode Douglas and his friend on horseback.

<p>took his place in the barouche, "that the part these

<p>faithful creatures took in last night's work, drives
</p>
<p>them into exile as well as me. I must not leave
</p>
<p>them behind to be the victims of baffled malice.
</p>
<p>What is to become of my plantation, is a question
</p>
<p>of less importance. I suppose I may say with Cincinnatus, when honor was forced on him as it is on
</p>
<p>me, my fields must go untilled this year I You see
</p>
<p>here, sir, my whole male force. Not one proved
</p>
<p>recreant."
</p>
<p>"This affair is altogether unaccountable to me,"
</p>
<p>said Whiting to Douglas, as they moved off together; "and this the strangest feature of the whole.
</p>
<p>Do men, then, act without motives; and against all
</p>
<p>assignable motives?"'"I asked the same question myself last night,"
</p>
<p>said Douglas, "and was referred to coming events
</p>
<p>for the answer. I was partly taught, at the same
</p>
<p>time, to account for what I was told to expect."
</p>
<p>" And how can it be accounted for?"
</p>
<p>"I cannot say I have my lesson perfect; but something was said about the difference of character produced by peculiar training, and habitudes of mind
</p>
<p>formed by circumstances. For my part, it appears
</p>
<p>to me that there must be something, by nature, in
</p>
<p>the moral constitution of the negro, intrinsically dif
</p>
<p>ferent from the white man."
</p>
<p>"It would, indeed, seem so," said Whiting, "if
</p>
<p>we are to credit what we see. But, in that case, we
</p>
<p>must reject the authority which tells us that all are of

</p>
<p>225
</p>
<p>"So are all dogs," said Douglas; "and dogs can
</p>
<p>no more act without motive than man. It depends
</p>
<p>on temper and character what shall be motives of
</p>
<p>action. The wolf would be sadly puzzled to judge
</p>
<p>of the motives of the Newfoundland dog. May not
</p>
<p>circumstances, which have made the difference between them, have produced the much less difference
</p>
<p>between the white man and the negro? I have no
</p>
<p>measure for the effect of such causes. If am put
</p>
<p>to choose between rejecting the evidence of my own
</p>
<p>senses, or the evidence of God's word, or the philosophy which teaches that man is to be considered as
</p>
<p>a unit, because all of one race, philosophy must go
</p>
<p>by the board. It mnay be that what is best for me is
</p>
<p>best for my friend Jack there, and vice versa; but as
</p>
<p>long as neither of us thinks so, why not leave each
</p>
<p>to his choice? Besides, there is more room in the
</p>
<p>world for both of us, than if both always wanted the
</p>
<p>same things."
</p>
<p>A ride of a few hours carried the party across the
</p>
<p>line into North Carolina. Here they stopped at the
</p>
<p>first public-house; and Mr. Trevor drew up a hasty
</p>
<p>statement of the events of the night, which should
</p>
<p>have the effect of acquitting Lieutenant Whiting of
</p>
<p>all blame, on account of his own escape from the
</p>
<p>fangs of his enemies. In this he set forth that,
</p>
<p>having been warned of the intended prosecution, he
</p>
<p>had made his preparations accordingly, and that the
</p>
<p>officer had but fallen into a snare from which no

</p>
<p>vigilance could have saved him. This he signed,
</p>
<p>226
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and gave, moreover, a clear acquittance to Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Whiting for all he had done; and having thus placed
</p>
<p>him, as far as depended on himself, rectus in curia,
</p>
<p>he announced to him that he was now at liberty to
</p>
<p>go whither he would.
</p>
<p>"And now, sir," said he, "as the spell which
</p>
<p>would have made your touch degrading is broken
</p>
<p>by the State line, let me have the pleasure of taking
</p>
<p>you by the hand, not only as my nephew's friend,
</p>
<p>but as one who, in the extremes of victory and defeat, as captor and as prisoner, has borne himself as
</p>
<p>became a gentleman."
</p>
<p>Saying this, he extended his hand, which Whiting
</p>
<p>grasped with fervor, and they parted as friends
</p>
<p>cordial and sincere.
</p>
<p>Douglas accompanied his friend a short distance
</p>
<p>on his return, the latter walking, and leading his
</p>
<p>horse. They conversed of the past and the future.
</p>
<p>"I have been a volunteer in this business," said
</p>
<p>Whiting. "I shall not disguise that my friendship
</p>
<p>for you led me to offer my services, and I fear that
</p>
<p>no excuse will be received for my failure. There is
</p>
<p>a spirit somewhere at work, to which I will give no
</p>
<p>name, that will be implacable at the thought that any
</p>
<p>advantage may have been lost by my respect for your
</p>
<p>feelings."
</p>
<p>"I am afraid it may prove so," replied Douglas.
</p>
<p>"The consequence may be fatal to your advancement
</p>
<p>in the army, and perhaps you may be driven from it,

</p>
<p>- but I will not profit so little by the example of
</p>
<p>delicacy set me while I wore the epaulette, as to say
</p>
<p>any thing to you now. I would content myself with
</p>
<p>telling you where I shall be found, if I myself knew.
</p>
<p>But shall I keep you advised of my movements?"
</p>
<p>"By all means," said Whiting. "I shall always
</p>
<p>wish to know your fate, whether good or ill."
</p>
<p>"I know that," replied Douglas. "But that is
</p>
<p>not my meaning. Shall I let you know where to
</p>
<p>find me, in case circumstances should lead you to
</p>
<p>share my fate?"
</p>
<p>" Don't ask me that, Trevor. The question implies
</p>
<p>ideas which I must not entertain. But should such a
</p>
<p>time as you suppose ever arrive, I shall know where to
</p>
<p>find you, should my opinions make it right to seek you."
</p>
<p>"Then, God bless you, Whiting I That we shall
</p>
<p>meet again is sure. That we shall stand shoulder to
</p>
<p>shoulder in the strife of battle, as, in our day dreams,
</p>
<p>we have so often thought of doing, I cannot doubt."
</p>
<p>And thus parted these gallant and generous youths;
</p>
<p>the one into exile from the country that he loved, the
</p>
<p>other to return to the service of an unthankful master.
</p>
<p>A farther ride of a few miles brought our party to
</p>
<p>the village, in which Mr. Trevor wished to take up
</p>
<p>his temporary residence. Here he found Mr. B.,
</p>
<p>who had been engaged in investigating the comforts
</p>
<p>and capabilities of the different public-houses, and
</p>
<p>having fixed on that he liked best, met Mr. Trevor
</p>
<p>in the street, and conducted the party to it. The

<p>lord the necessary arrangements for the comfort of
</p>
<p>the family during their proposed stay.
</p>
<p>While they were thus engaged, Douglas seated
</p>
<p>himself, after the manner of the country, in the barroom, in which, besides some travellers, there was a
</p>
<p>motley assemblage of the inhabitants of the village,
</p>
<p>who had come in to stare at and talk about the new
</p>
<p>comers. By the time Douglas had taken care of the
</p>
<p>ladies and baggage, they were deep into the merits
</p>
<p>of the whole party; and, when he entered the room,
</p>
<p>they were too busy talking to pay any attention to
</p>
<p>him. The principal interlocutors were three. First,
</p>
<p>a well-dressed, middle-aged man, whose dapper air
</p>
<p>and delicate hands bespoke one accustomed to bowing across a counter over lace patterns and painted
</p>
<p>muslins; and whose style of eloquence was exactly
</p>
<p>adapted to the praise of such articles. Then there
</p>
<p>was a, coarse, strong man, with a bacon-fed look,
</p>
<p>plainly, cheaply, and untastefully dressed, in clothes
</p>
<p>which, by their substantial goodness, indicated at
</p>
<p>once the wearer's prudence, and the length of his
</p>
<p>purse. His voice was loud, strong, and self-important, entirely devoid of melody, and incapable of
</p>
<p>inflection or modulation. His whole appearance
</p>
<p>showed him to be a substantial planter, ignorant of
</p>
<p>every thing but corn and tobacco. A huge whip in
</p>
<p>the hand of the third, together with his dusty and
</p>
<p>travel-soiled appearance, denoted the driver of a
</p>
<p>wagon which stood before the door.

<p>the planter. "It may suit my neighbor Jones, here,

<p>well enough to have one of them high-headed Roanoke planters to come here with his family, and spend

<p>his money. I dare say he will make a pretty good

<p>they would stay at home, and live under their own

</p>
<p>the thing works, they would be glad enough to share
</p>
<p>with us, but I see plain enough that all they would
</p>
<p>get by joining us, we would lose, and may be more
</p>
<p>too."
</p>
<p>" You are right there, Mr. Hobson," said the merchant; "anid that is not all. There's an advantage
</p>
<p>in buying as well as selling. Now as to this Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor, or whatever his name is, coming over here,
</p>
<p>and buying things cheaper than he could get them
</p>
<p>at home-why that he is welcome to. Though you
</p>
<p>may be sure, neighbor, I don't let him have them as
</p>
<p>cheap as I sell to you. But as to letting in the Norfolk merchants to all the advantage of our treaty
</p>
<p>with England, that is another matter. For though,
</p>
<p>when we deepen the bar at Ocracock, I have no
</p>
<p>doubt our town down there will be another sort of a
</p>
<p>place to what Norfolk ever was, yet if Virginia was
</p>
<p>to join us now, right away, the most of the trade
</p>
<p>would go to Norfolk again, and they would get their
</p>
<p>goods there as cheap as we get them here, and may
</p>
<p>be a little cheaper. So you see it is against my
</p>
<p>interest as well as yours; and I don't like the
</p>
<p>thoughts of putting in a crop, and letting another
</p>
<p>man gather it, any more than you do."
</p>
<p>" It would be harder upon me than any of you,"
</p>
<p>said the wagoner; "for if that was the case, that
</p>
<p>damned railroad would break up my business, stock
</p>
<p>and fluke. As it is, there never was such a time for

</p>
<p>It is hard to say whether surprise or disgust most
</p>
<p>prevailed in the mind of Douglas at hearing these
</p>
<p>remarks. The idea of the advantages lost to Virginia, by her connexion with the North, had never
</p>
<p>entered his mind; but still less had he conceived it
</p>
<p>possible that a sordid desire to monopolize these
</p>
<p>advantages, could stifle, in the minds of the North
</p>
<p>Carolinians, every feeling of sympathy with the
</p>
<p>oppressed and persecuted assertors of the rights of
</p>
<p>Virginia. The reply of Mr. Hobson to the remark
</p>
<p>of the wagoner gave him a yet deeper insight into
</p>
<p>that dark and foul corner of the human heart, where
</p>
<p>self predominates over all the better affections.
</p>
<p>" I don't think that's right fair in you wagoners,"
</p>
<p>said he. "You haul the Virginian tobacco down to
</p>
<p>Commerce, and when it gets there it is all the same
</p>
<p>as mine. Now, if it was not for that, I am not so
</p>
<p>mighty sure but I'd get forty dollars instead of
</p>
<p>thirty; and I don't like to lose ten dollars to give
</p>
<p>you a chance to get one."
</p>
<p>"It is all one to me," said the wagoner. "You

</p>
<p>a degree of prosperity in Norfolk, which bids fair to make it the first

</p>
<p>may just pay me the same for not hauling that they
</p>
<p>pay me for hauling, or only half as much, and I will
</p>
<p>not haul another hogshead."
</p>
<p>"But if you won't, another will," said Hobson.
</p>
<p>"Like enough," replied the wagoner; "for all
</p>
<p>trades must live; and if them poor devils get a
</p>
<p>chance to sell a hogshead or two, instead of
</p>
<p>leaving it all to rot, you ought not to grudge them
</p>
<p>that."
</p>
<p>" Certainly not," said the merchant, " for I guess
</p>
<p>that whatever they get, they take care to lay it all
</p>
<p>out in goods on this side of the line. So the money
</p>
<p>stays with us after all, and friend Stubbs's hauling
</p>
<p>does good to more besides him."' I see," said Hobson, "how it does good to you,
</p>
<p>but none to me."
</p>
<p>"But that an't all, Mr. Hobson," said the landlord,
</p>
<p>who had entered while this conversation was going
</p>
<p>on. " Them hot-headed fellows over the line there,
</p>
<p>like this old Squire Trevor, will be getting themselves into hot water every now and then; and when
</p>
<p>they run away and come to us, if they did not bring
</p>
<p>no money, we'd have to feed them free gratis for
</p>
<p>nothing. Now Stubbs hauls Squire Trevor's tobacco to Commerce, and he gets a good price; and
</p>
<p>then he gets into trouble, and comes over here to
</p>
<p>stay with me, and so he is able to pay me a good
</p>
<p>price; and here it is," added he, showing a roll of
</p>
<p>notes.

</p>
<p>"Still," said Hobson, "I don't see how that does
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>233
</p>
<p>me any good. If they were to come here begging,
</p>
<p>damn the mouthful I'd give them."
</p>
<p>" Then you would leave the whole burden on the
</p>
<p>poor tavern-keepers," said the landlord.
</p>
<p>" No-I would not. I would not let them come;
</p>
<p>or, if they did, just give them up to their own government. If they had not a chance to be running
</p>
<p>over here, as soon as they got into trouble, they
</p>
<p>would keep quiet, and never get a chance to separate, and so ruin our business, whether they joined
</p>
<p>us or no."
</p>
<p>"Old Rip is wide awake at last," said a voice
</p>
<p>from behind; "' but it is to his interest only."
</p>
<p>Douglas turned to the voice of the speaker, the
</p>
<p>tone of which expressed a scorn and derision most
</p>
<p>acceptable to his feelings. He was a tall and finelooking man, powerfully made, and inclined to be
</p>
<p>fat, but not at all unwieldy. The half laughing
</p>
<p>expression of his large, blue eye, and the protrusion
</p>
<p>of his under lip, spoke his careless contempt of those
</p>
<p>whose conversation had called forth his sarcasm.
</p>
<p>The attention of the whole company was drawn to
</p>
<p>him at the same moment; all looking as if they
</p>
<p>wished to say something, without knowing what.
</p>
<p>At length the wagoner spoke, on the well understood principle that, when men talk of what they
</p>
<p>understand imperfectly, he who knows least should
</p>
<p>be always first to show his ignorance.

<p>mean, stranger," said he; " but I guess, by the cut

<p>of your jib, that you are one of them high dons from
</p>
<p>South Carolina, that always have money to throw
</p>
<p>away, and think a body ought never to care any
</p>
<p>more for himself than another. But this business
</p>
<p>don't consarn you, no how, because these people
</p>
<p>don't interfere with your cotton crop."
</p>
<p>"Yes, but they do, though," said Hobson; "for
</p>
<p>if they drive me from tobacco, I shall make cotton.
</p>
<p>But, if I can keep them out of the tobacco market,
</p>
<p>I shall be willing to give up the making of cotton to
</p>
<p>South Carolina."
</p>
<p>"Why, that is true," said the stranger, with a
</p>
<p>sudden change of his countenance, from which he
</p>
<p>discharged, in a moment, every appearance of intelligence, but that which seemed to reflect the superior
</p>
<p>wisdom of Mr. Hobson. "That is true," said he,
</p>
<p>looking as if making a stupid attempt to think; "I
</p>
<p>had not thought of that before."
</p>
<p>As he said this, he sunk slowly and thoughtfully
</p>
<p>into a chair, his knees falling far asunder, his arms
</p>
<p>dropping across his thighs, his body bent forward,
</p>
<p>and his face turned up toward Mr. Hobson, with
</p>
<p>the look of one who desires and expects to receive
</p>
<p>important information. The whole action spoke so
</p>
<p>eloquently to Mr. Hobson's self-esteem, that he went
</p>
<p>on, with an air of the most gracious complacency.
</p>
<p>" You see, stranger, just shutting only a part of
</p>
<p>the Virginian tobacco out of the market, makes a
</p>
<p>difference of ten dollars, at the very least, in the

</p>
<p>it up quite entirely, and then, you see, it stands to
</p>
<p>reason it will make a difference of five cents a pound,
</p>
<p>or may be ten, in your cotton."
</p>
<p>This interesting proposition was received by the
</p>
<p>stranger with a sluggish start of dull surprise, from.
</p>
<p>which he sunk again into the same appearance of
</p>
<p>stolid musing. "To think what a fool I have been,"
</p>
<p>said he, after a long pause. Then, scratching his
</p>
<p>head, and twisting in his chair, he added: " You are
</p>
<p>right. You are right; and the only way to manage
</p>
<p>the matter is to get your Legislature to pass a law,
</p>
<p>as you say, to make those fellows stay at home."
</p>
<p>"To be sure it would," said the gratified Hobson;
</p>
<p>"but then there are so many conceited fellows in the
</p>
<p>Legislature, with a fool's notion in their heads about
</p>
<p>taking sides with them that cannot help themselves,
</p>
<p>that there is no getting anything done."
</p>
<p>"Well," said the stranger, " this gentleman guessed
</p>
<p>right when he said I was from South Carolina. So
</p>
<p>I don't know any thing about your laws here. But
</p>
<p>I suppose you have no law to hurt a man for taking
</p>
<p>up one that runs away from the law in Virginia, and
</p>
<p>carrying him back. I expect old Van would pay
</p>
<p>well for them."
</p>
<p>Hobson looked hard at the stranger, and only
</p>
<p>answered with that compound motion of the head,
</p>
<p>which, partaking at once of a shake and a nod,
</p>
<p>expresses both assent and caution.

</p>
<p>IN the meantime, Mr. B- had entered the room,
</p>
<p>and, hearing the stranger's voice, placed himself at
</p>
<p>the back of his chair, looking on with a playful
</p>
<p>smile. He now spoke"' Have you played out the play?" said he.
</p>
<p>The stranger sprang to his feet in a moment, and,
</p>
<p>facing B-, caught him by the hand, which he
</p>
<p>shook with an energy which seemed to threaten dislocation. The two then turned off, and left the room
</p>
<p>together.
</p>
<p>"This is most fortunate, my dear sir," said the
</p>
<p>stranger; "but, pray tell me, how happens it that I

<p>find you here?"

</p>
<p>"H ere we both are," said B , " and here Tre

<p>elected to the Legislature, and they have gotten up
</p>
<p>a prosecution against him before that iniquitous
</p>
<p>court of high commission at Washington, to hang
</p>
<p>him, if they can, or at least to drive him off."
</p>
<p>" Can you think him safe here," asked the stranger,
</p>
<p>" among such mercenary wretches -as those we have
</p>
<p>just left?"
</p>
<p>" O yes! You must not judge of this people by
</p>
<p>those muck-worms. The best of the three is a Yankee tin-pedler, turned merchant. The other two are
</p>
<p>the worst specimens of their respective species. I

<p>dare say there are many more like them, but there
</p>
<p>are fifty gentlemen of property in this county who
</p>
<p>would stand by us; and are ready, in their individual capacity, to aid us with purse and sword, whenever we raise our banner."
</p>
<p>"But where is Trevor?" said the stranger. "I

<p>am impatient to see him."
</p>
<p>" We will go to him," said B -; "but first let

</p>
<p>Douglas was now called into the room, and introduced to the stranger; and the three gentlemen repaired together to the parlor of Mr. Trevor. A
</p>
<p>cordial greeting between the two friends, and a
</p>
<p>sprightly conversation on various topics, ensued; but
</p>
<p>at length the ladies left the room, and affairs of moment came under discussion.
</p>
<p>"I am come," said the stranger, " to learn your
</p>
<p>plans, and to consult of the best means of affording
</p>
<p>such aid as we can. When, where, and how, do you
</p>
<p>mean to move?"
</p>
<p>"We have carried the elections," said B-, "so
</p>
<p>as to be sure of a majority in the Legislature, if they
</p>
<p>can be freed from the presence of the Federal army.
</p>
<p>But, unless that can be done, our friends here, and
</p>
<p>many others, will not be permitted to attend, and the
</p>
<p>weaker brethren will be overawed."
</p>
<p>"Of course, then, you will attempt that. What
</p>
<p>measures do you propose to take?"

</p>
<p>duty in the English ports on your tobacco, and the
</p>
<p>corresponding abatement of your impost on British
</p>
<p>manufactures, is driving trade, money, and even
</p>
<p>population, to the South; and nothing but separation from the northern States can prevent our whole
</p>
<p>tobacco country from being deserted. This, of course,
</p>
<p>will open the eyes of the people in time, and we
</p>
<p>hope, that when the Legislature meets, it may be
</p>
<p>practicable to draw together, on the sudden, such a

<p>force as may drive the enemy from Richmond, and
</p>
<p>give time at least to adjourn to a place where they

<p>may deliberate in safety.
</p>
<p>" Is there any such place in the State?" asked the

<p>stranger.
</p>
<p>" I am not aware that there is at this moment, but

<p>such a one must be provided for the emergency,

<p>should it arise."
</p>
<p>" And what means do you propose to use for that

<p>purpose?"
</p>
<p>" There is a section of the State," replied B ,

<p>"where circumstances enable me to exert a powerful

<p>influence, and where, from its localities, a partisan

<p>within a pretty extensive district."

<p>"It would have that effect," said B, "were
</p>
<p>not the scene of action remote from Richmond, and
</p>
<p>unless the operations of the corps were so conducted
</p>
<p>as to create no alarm for that place. Of course,
</p>
<p>there should be no appearance of concert with this
</p>
<p>lower country; and, so far from increasing apprehension of our ulterior designs, our failure to rally

<p>to the banner of a successful leader might disarm
</p>
<p>suspicion."
</p>
<p>"' Then it seems that all you want is a Marion, a

<p>" We have such a one," said B ; " and it is

<p>well that you are here with us to aid in consecrating

<p>As he said this, he laid his hand, solemnly, gently,

<p>and respectfully, on the head of the astonished

<p>Douglas.
</p>
<p>"What, I! " exclaimed he. "For God's sake, my

<p>dear sir, what qualification have I for such a service."
</p>
<p>"Courage, talent, address, and military education," said B, with a quiet smile.
</p>
<p>"And where should I find men willing to be commanded by me, in an enterprise which, of course,
</p>
<p>supposes the absence of all legal authority?"
</p>
<p>" Suppose them provided," said B. "Is there
</p>
<p>any other difficulty to be removed?"

<p>it long before this, but that as long as one shred
</p>
<p>remained of the tie that bound you to the army of the
</p>
<p>United States, a delicate respect to you imposed
</p>
<p>silence on your uncle and myself. You now require
</p>
<p>that we show you some prevailing reason why Virginia should detach herself from the Northern Confederacy, and either form a separate State, which we
</p>
<p>do not propose, or unite herself to the South, which
</p>
<p>we do. Is not that your difficulty! "
</p>
<p>"It is," replied Douglas. "I have long been
</p>
<p>sensible that there were views of the subject which
</p>
<p>my situation had hidden from me, and have frequently lamented (while I was grateful for) the resolute reserve which my friends have maintained."
</p>
<p>"' You must be sensible," said B, " that the
</p>
<p>southern States, including Virginia, are properly and
</p>
<p>almost exclusively agricultural. The quality of their
</p>
<p>soil and climate, and the peculiar character of their
</p>
<p>laboring population, concur to make agriculture the
</p>
<p>most profitable employment among them. Apart
</p>
<p>from the influence of artificial causes, it is not certain that any labor can be judiciously taken fronm

</p>
<p>necessary to make a hob-nail, if applied to the cul.
</p>
<p>tivation of the earth, might produce that for which
</p>
<p>the British manufacturer would gladly give two hobnails. By coming between the manufacturer and
</p>
<p>the farmer, and interrupting this interchange by
</p>
<p>perverse legislation, the Government broke the tie
</p>
<p>which bound the colonies to the mother country.
</p>
<p>" When that tie was severed and peace established,
</p>
<p>it was the interest of both parties that this interchange
</p>
<p>should be restored, and put upon such a footing as
</p>
<p>to enable each, reciprocally, to obtain for the products of his own labor as much as poss;ible of the
</p>
<p>products of the labor of the other.
</p>
<p>"Why was not this done? Because laws are not
</p>
<p>made for the benefit of the people, but for that of
</p>
<p>their rulers. The monopolizing spirit of the landed
</p>
<p>aristocracy in England led to the exclusion of our
</p>
<p>bread-stuffs, and the necessities of the British treasury tempted to the levying of enormous revenue from
</p>
<p>our other agricultural products. The interchange
</p>
<p>between the farmer and manufacturer was thus interrupted. In part it was absolutely prevented; the
</p>
<p>profit being swallowed up by the impost, the inducement was taken away.
</p>
<p>"What did the American Government under these
</p>
<p>circumstances? Did they say to Great Britain,' relax
</p>
<p>your corn-laws; reduce your duties on tobacco;
</p>
<p>make no discrimination between our cotton and that
</p>
<p>from the East Indies; and we will refrain from lay.

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>thus enrich your own people, and it is by no means
</p>
<p>sure that their increased prosperity may not give
</p>
<p>you, through the excise and other channels of revenue, more than an equivalent for the taxes we propose
</p>
<p>to you to withdraw.'
</p>
<p>" Did we say this? No. And why? Because,
</p>
<p>in the northern States, there was a manufacturing
</p>
<p>interest to be advanced by the very course of legislation most fatal to the South. With a dense population, occupying a small extent of barren country.
</p>
<p>with mountain streams tumbling into deep tidewater, and bringing commerce to the aid of manufactures, they wanted nothing but a monopoly of the
</p>
<p>southern market to enable them to enrich themselves.
</p>
<p>The alternative was before us. To invite the great
</p>
<p>European manufacturer to reciprocate the benefits of
</p>
<p>free trade, whereby the South might enjoy all the
</p>
<p>advantages of its fertile soil and fine climate, or to
</p>
<p>transfer these advantages to the North, by meeting
</p>
<p>Great Britain on the ground of prohibition and
</p>
<p>exaction. The latter was preferred, because to the
</p>
<p>interest of that section, which, having the local
</p>
<p>majority, had the power.
</p>
<p>"Under this system, Great Britain has never
</p>
<p>wanted a pretext for her corn-laws, and her high
</p>
<p>duties on all our products. Thus we sell all we
</p>
<p>make, subject to these deductions, which, in many
</p>
<p>instances, leave much less to us than what goes into
</p>
<p>the British treasury.

<p>"Here, too, is the pretext to the Government of
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>245
</p>
<p>the United States for their exactions in return. The
</p>
<p>misfortune is, that the southern planter had to bear
</p>
<p>both burthens. One half the price of his products is
</p>
<p>seized by the British Government, and half the
</p>
<p>value of what he gets for the other half is seized by
</p>
<p>the Government of the United States.
</p>
<p>" This they called retaliation and indemnification.
</p>
<p>It was indemnifying an interest which had not been
</p>
<p>injured, by the farther injury of one which had been
</p>
<p>injured. It was impoverishing the South for the
</p>
<p>benefit of the North, to requite the South for having
</p>
<p>been already impoverished for the benefit of Great
</p>
<p>Britain. Still it was'indemnifying ourselves.' Much
</p>
<p>virtue in that word,' ourselves.' It is the language
</p>
<p>used by the giant to the dwarf in the fable; the
</p>
<p>language of the brazen pot to the earthen pot; the
</p>
<p>language of all dangerous or interested friendship.
</p>
<p>" I remember seeing an illustration of this sort of
</p>
<p>indemnity in the case of a woman who was whipt by
</p>
<p>hler husband. She went complaining to her father,
</p>
<p>who whipped her again, and sent her back.'Tell
</p>
<p>your husband,' said he,'that as often as he whips
</p>
<p>my daughter, I will whip his wife.'"
</p>
<p>"But what remedy has been proposed for these
</p>
<p>things?" asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>"A remedy has been proposed and applied,"

<p>Are we not all our own rulers?"
</p>
<p>" Yes," replied B, "if you again have recourse
</p>
<p>to the use of that comprehensive word'wE,' which
</p>
<p>identifies things most dissimilar, and binds up, in the
</p>
<p>same bundle, things most discordant. If the South
</p>
<p>and North are one; if the Yankee and the Virginian
</p>
<p>are one; if light and darkness, heat and cold, life
</p>
<p>and death, can all be identified; then WE are our own
</p>
<p>rulers. Just so, if the State will consent to be identified with the Church, then we pay tithes with one
</p>
<p>hand, and receive them with the other. While the

<p>Commons identify themselves with the Crown,'wE'
</p>
<p>do but pay taxes to ourselves. And if Virginians

<p>can be fooled into identifying themselves with the
</p>
<p>Yankees-a fixed tax-paying minority, with a fixed

<p>thing; and they will continue to hold a distinguished

<p>Tim impression made on Douglas by these observations was so strong and so obvious, that his friend
</p>
<p>paused and left him to meditate upon them. Some
</p>
<p>minutes elapsed before he made any reply. When
</p>
<p>he did speak, he acknowledged the existence and
</p>
<p>magnitude of the grievance, and again inquired,
</p>
<p>with increased solicitude, what remedy had been

<p>found.

<p>"You heard what passed in the bar-room, just

<p>anxious to monopolize? "
</p>
<p>" Not at all, and hence my surprise; for I had sup.
</p>
<p>posed heretofore, that, between the two States, all, the
</p>
<p>advantage lay on the side of Virginia."
</p>
<p>" You judge rightly," replied the other. "In the
</p>
<p>way of commerce, nature has done nothing for the
</p>
<p>one, and everything for the other. But the conversation you have heard is a proof that the sand which
</p>
<p>chokes the waters of the Sound is a trivial obstacle, in
</p>
<p>comparison with the legislative barriers which have

<p>shut out prosperity from the noble Chesapeake.

<p>Look at your rivers and bay, and you will see that

<p>Virginia ought to be the most prosperous country in

<p>the fragments of tombstones, and you will see that

<p>ignorant or too slothful to use them will soon give

<p>place to others of a different character. What has
</p>
<p>there been to prevent the Yankee from selling his
</p>
<p>barren hills at high prices and coming South, where
</p>
<p>he might buy the fertile shores of the Chesapeake for
</p>
<p>a song? No local attachment, certainly; for his
</p>
<p>home is everywhere. What is there now to prevent
</p>
<p>the planter of this neighborhood from exchanging his
</p>
<p>thirsty fields for the rich and long coveted low
</p>
<p>grounds of James River, or Roanoke, in Virginia?
</p>
<p>Are these people wiser, better, more energetic and

<p>enjoys its natural advantages, while Virginia remains

<p>under the crushing weight of a system devised for the

<p>benefit of her oppressors."

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader,
</p>
<p>251
</p>
<p>in consideration of receiving the like advantage.
</p>
<p>Instead of nursing artificial interests to rival the iron
</p>
<p>and cotton fabrics, and the shipping of England, the
</p>
<p>wine of France, the silk and oil of Italy, and enviously
</p>
<p>sniatching at whatever benefit nature may have vouchsafed to other parts of the world, this people only ask
</p>
<p>to exchange for these things their own peculiar productions. A trade perfectly free, totally discharged
</p>
<p>from all duties, would certainly be best for all. But
</p>
<p>revenue must be had, and the impost is the best
</p>
<p>source of revenue. No state can be expected to give
</p>
<p>that up. But it has been found practicable so to
</p>
<p>regulate that matter as to reduce the charges which
</p>
<p>have heretofore incumbered exchanges to a mere
</p>
<p>trifle."
</p>
<p>" How has that been effected?" asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>"If that question were to be answered in detail,"
</p>
<p>said B-, "I should leave the answer to him by
</p>
<p>whom the details have been arranged. I will give you
</p>
<p>the outline in a few words. These States were first
</p>
<p>driven to think of separation by a tariff of protection.
</p>
<p>Their federal constitution guards against it by exrress prohibition, and by requiring that the impost,
</p>
<p>like the tax laws of Virginia, should be annual.': They have felt the danger to liberty from excessive revenue. Their constitution requires that the
</p>
<p>estimates of the expense of the current year shall be
</p>
<p>made the measure of revenue to be raised for that
</p>
<p>year. The imports of the preceding year are taken

<p>as a basis of calculation, and credit being given for

</p>
<p>any surplus in the treasury, a tariff is laid which, on
</p>
<p>that basis, would produce the sum required."
</p>
<p>" Thlen there never can be any surplus for an
</p>
<p>emergency," said Douglas.
</p>
<p>"Always," replied B ; "in the right place, and
</p>
<p>the only safe place-the pockets of a prosperous pee
</p>
<p>ple. There is no place in the treasury to keep money.
</p>
<p>The till of the treasury has a hole in the bottom, and
</p>
<p>the money always finds its way into the pockets of
</p>
<p>sharpers, parasites, man-worshippers, and pseudopatriots. But let that pass. You see that a small
</p>
<p>revenue alone will probably be wanting, and being
</p>
<p>raised annually, the tariff can be annually adjusted.
</p>
<p>" Now, what says justice, as to the revenue to be
</p>
<p>raised by two nations on the trade between the two,
</p>
<p>seeing that it is equally levied on the citizens of both?"
</p>
<p>"On that hypothesis each should receive an equal
</p>
<p>share of it," said Douglas.
</p>
<p>"Precisely so," answered B ; " and let these
</p>
<p>terms be held out to all nations, and if one will not
</p>
<p>accept them another will. On this principle a system
</p>
<p>of commercial arrangements has been set on foot
</p>
<p>which, by restoring to these States the benefit of
</p>
<p>their natural advantages, is at once producing an
</p>
<p>effect which explains their former prosperity. It
</p>
<p>places in stronger relief the evils of the opposite
</p>
<p>system to Virginia, and really leaves her, while she
</p>
<p>retains her present connexion with the North, with->ut any resource. Tobacco she cannot sell at all.

</p>
<p>she will not receive in return the third part as much

<p>of the manufactured article as the Carolina planter

<p>will get for his. This is her fate. She sees it, and

<p>would throw off the yoke. But her northern masters

<p>see it too. She is all that remains to them of their

<p>southern dependencies, which, though not their colonies, they have so long governed as colonies. Take

<p>her away, and they are in the condition of the wolf

<p>when there are no sheep left. Wolf eat wolf, and

</p>
<p>do your part in furtherance of this object?"

</p>
<p>"He is all that," said B. "But he writes as

<p>good a hand as Marshal Saxe, and has probably read
</p>
<p>as many books as Cincinnatus. But to speak seriously,
</p>
<p>he is no common clown. I picked him up, nearly

<p>forty years ago, a little, dirty, ragged boy, without

<p>money, without friends, without education, and without principles. All these wants I found means to

<p>pretty large experience in knavery. Such as he is, he

<p>is bound to me by gratitude, such as few men are

<p>the world but his rifle. He has a good deal of money,

<p>which I manage for him; and as he has no taste for
</p>
<p>extravagance of any sort, and is generous as a king,
</p>
<p>he always has a dollar to spare a friend.

<p>"When I tell you that the people of that district
</p>
<p>see so little money that they always count it by fourpence-half-pennies, you will readily believe that a
</p>
<p>little help goes a great way. They don't see that

<p>sagacity and enterprise takes away all wonder at the

</p>
<p>infer, that his influence among them is very great.
</p>
<p>Now that, and all his faculties of body, mind, and
</p>
<p>purse, are at my command. He is aware of the state
</p>
<p>of public affairs; adopts all my views, as far as he
</p>
<p>can understand them, and beyond that point trusts
</p>
<p>me implicitly. It is through his instrumentality thai
</p>
<p>the minds of the mountaineers of that district are pre
</p>
<p>pared for action at this moment. No force is actually
</p>
<p>organized, but every thing is ready for the emergency. The dispositions of the people, and the
</p>
<p>strong fastnesses of the country, will make it a secure
</p>
<p>retreat to a partisan corps. The materials for such a
</p>
<p>corps may be found in part among the inhabitants.
</p>
<p>A nucleus is all that is wanting, and to that all the
</p>
<p>persecuted and distressed, from every quarter, will
</p>
<p>gather."
</p>
<p>"You show me, then," said Douglas, "that you
</p>
<p>already have all you want-men and a leader. Your
</p>
<p>friend Schwartz must be the very man to command
</p>
<p>those fellows, and might not like to submit to the
</p>
<p>authority of another."
</p>
<p>" He is not the man to command," said B-, "because he could not keep up intelligence with other
</p>
<p>parts of the country, though as a medium of intelligence there is none better. Indeed he cannot be
</p>
<p>spared from that branch of service. Besides, though
</p>
<p>he might command his neighbors, you will be joined

<p>CHAPTER XXIX.
</p>
<p>The heath this night must be my bed,
</p>
<p>The bracken curtain for my head,
</p>
<p>My lullaby the warder's tread,
</p>
<p>Far, far, from Love and thee, Mary I
</p>
<p>"I THINK," said Douglas, " I now understand your
</p>
<p>general purpose, and the means to be placed at my
</p>
<p>disposal. Let me now know your plan of operations.
</p>
<p>What am I to do, and when?"
</p>
<p>"The task I propose to myself," replied B, "is
</p>
<p>one which requires that I keep myself out of harm's
</p>
<p>way, and free from all suspicion, until the time shall
</p>
<p>come; when I propose to act a part which shall
</p>
<p>make me a conspicuous mark for the malice or policy
</p>
<p>of our enemies. Hence I affect to live, and keep
</p>
<p>myself as much as possible on this side of the line.
</p>
<p>What you do there must be done in such a way as to
</p>
<p>indicate no connexion with me. I therefore propose!
</p>
<p>that you accompany my friend here to South Carolina, where you may derive much benefit from seeing
</p>
<p>the first men in that State, with whom he will make
</p>
<p>you acquainted. From thence I would have you
</p>
<p>address letters to your friends (especially those in the

<p>258
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>change of opinions (which should be made to seem
</p>
<p>progressive) to the influence of these new associations.
</p>
<p>A few weeks will be sufficient for this purpose, and
</p>
<p>you may return to Virginia early in the summer.
</p>
<p>Here," continued B, pointing to a map which
</p>
<p>hung in the room, " is the point at which you will
</p>
<p>enter the State, and here will be the principal scene
</p>
<p>of your operations. You will there find Schwartz,
</p>
<p>to whom you shall be properly accredited, and from
</p>
<p>whom you will learn the resources to be placed at
</p>
<p>your command, and the capabilities of the country.
</p>
<p>" Now observe. Our object is to organize a small
</p>
<p>force, under which the district may be protected in
</p>
<p>declaring for the Independence of Virginia, and prepared to afford a place of refuge to the Legislature,
</p>
<p>should they be driven from Richmond, before they
</p>
<p>have time to organize the operations of the Government. Of course, they must have an opportunity to
</p>
<p>assemble there, if but for a day. This it must be
</p>
<p>our care to secure, by a sudden movement from the
</p>
<p>midland counties on the southern boundary, and in
</p>
<p>this we may need your co-operation. On that point
</p>
<p>we shall take care to keep you advised.
</p>
<p>"Now our first object being to free Richmond
</p>
<p>from the presence of the federal army, at the moment
</p>
<p>the Legislature is to meet, we must be careful to
</p>
<p>cause no alarm for the safety of that place. Any
</p>
<p>movement in that direction would produce a concentration of force there, and increase our difficulties.

</p>
<p>You should, therefore, be careful so to shape your
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>259
</p>
<p>operations as rather to call the attention of the enemy
</p>
<p>to other points; and if you can make them of sufficient importance to draw detachments from Richmond,
</p>
<p>a double purpose will be answered. You will have
</p>
<p>no cause to fear any force that can be brought against
</p>
<p>you. Your field of operations affords situations which
</p>
<p>may defy assault, and, the line of North Carolina
</p>
<p>being at your back, you may, at any moment, cross
</p>
<p>it and disband for a time.
</p>
<p>" But I am not sure whether our end may not be
</p>
<p>answered best by giving to all your operations such
</p>
<p>a character as may exclude the idea of any political
</p>
<p>object. As none of those who are conspicuous as
</p>
<p>malcontents in the lower country will join you, this
</p>
<p>deception will not be difficult. In beating up the
</p>
<p>quarters of the troops near you, you may seem to act
</p>
<p>but in self defence; and should you extend your
</p>
<p>blow so far as Lynchburg, your mountaineers will
</p>
<p>hardly fail to levy such contributions on the campfollowers and Yankee pedlars there (who call themselves merchants), as to give the measure the appearance of a mere marauding expedition."
</p>
<p>"I am not so very sure," replied Douglas, "that
</p>
<p>[ should like to mix my little reputation as a soldier
</p>
<p>%nd a gentleman with an affair of that sort."
</p>
<p>"I am not suggesting anything contrary to the
</p>
<p>laws of war," said B. "The violation of them
</p>
<p>would be but in appearance. Care would be taken
</p>
<p>to indemnify any who might be wronged, whenever

</p>
<p>As to any temporary misconstruction, your name
</p>
<p>would connect you with your uncle, and, through
</p>
<p>him, with me and all our friends; and moreover,
</p>
<p>would whet the malice of your worthy friends, the
</p>
<p>Bakers, who would move heaven and earth to circumvent you. Better, therefore, to drop the last name.
</p>
<p>Archibald Douglas is name enough to satisfy the ambition of any reasonable man, at least until he can cap it
</p>
<p>with a yet more honorable addition, if that be possible."
</p>
<p>While this conversation was going on, there was
</p>
<p>some appearance of embarrassment about Douglas,
</p>
<p>which did not escape the observation of his uncle.
</p>
<p>At length he said to him, in an under tone, that,
</p>
<p>before carrying the matter under discussion any farther, he would be glad to have a few words with him
</p>
<p>in private.
</p>
<p>" I understand your wish," said the old gentleman,
</p>
<p>aloud; "it shall be indulged."
</p>
<p>" I suspect you mistake me," said Douglas, coloring
</p>
<p>very high.
</p>
<p>"Not at all," replied the other. "You only
</p>
<p>suppose so because you do not know that one
</p>
<p>of my friends here received his wife in marriage
</p>
<p>at my hands, and that the other stood father to
</p>
<p>mine. Hence I have no such reserves with-them
</p>
<p>as you may suppose. Now, do I understand you?"
</p>
<p>"I dare say you do," replied Douglas, blushing
</p>
<p>yet more deeply.
</p>
<p>" Then I say, again, your wish shall be indulged.

</p>
<p>in all the rights which it is mine to confer. But you
</p>
<p>must suppress your raptures until you hear the conditions. Our plan requires secrecy, and, above all,
</p>
<p>that there should be no appearance of concert between
</p>
<p>you and us, and no cause to suspect it. This thing,
</p>
<p>therefore, must be absolutely private; no witnesses
</p>
<p>but those here present, and your aunt, and Lucia; and
</p>
<p>in the next moment your foot must be in the stirrup.
</p>
<p>Are you content?"
</p>
<p>"'ContentI " said Douglas. "Indeed I am not;
</p>
<p>but I see that you are acting upon a concerted plan,
</p>
<p>and that all expostulation must be vain. Let me at
</p>
<p>least see Delia now."
</p>
<p>"I suspect she has gone to bed," said Mr. T-.
</p>
<p>"Retired I believe is the word introduced by our
</p>
<p>Yankee school-mistresses, whose prurient imaginations are shocked at the name of a bed. Poor girl,
</p>
<p>she was glad to retire, in the plain English sense of
</p>
<p>the word, as soon as we got here, and, I dare say, has
</p>
<p>been in bed half an hour. She and your aunt were
</p>
<p>on active service all last night, while you were keeping a snoring watch over our friend Whiting. Come,
</p>
<p>my boy! You shall not infect her with the fever of
</p>
<p>your brain to-night. If you cannot sleep, it is no
</p>
<p>reason why she should not. And now let us turn
</p>
<p>again to other matters."
</p>
<p>"The next question, then," said the southron, " is
</p>
<p>how we can aid you? By sword, or tongue, or pen,
</p>
<p>or purse? "

<p>"By purse as much as you please," said B .
</p>
<p>262
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>"Our young friend here will need a small military
</p>
<p>chest, which we have no means of filling. As to the
</p>
<p>rest, keep out of the scrape. We wish to join you
</p>
<p>in peace, and then remain at peace, which will not
</p>
<p>be, if you strike a blow in our behalf now. As much
</p>
<p>individual aid as you please to our rendezvous just
</p>
<p>before the first Monday in December. A thousand
</p>
<p>independent volunteers, pour le coup, would be welcome. In the meantime, if you can send our young
</p>
<p>friend here a promising young officer from your
</p>
<p>military school, to be his second in command, it is
</p>
<p>all we would ask. Of course he will come as of his
</p>
<p>own head, for you must not seem to have anything
</p>
<p>to do with the matter."
</p>
<p>Many other topics connected with our subject were
</p>
<p>discussed, but I deem it unadvisable to speak of
</p>
<p>more than is necessary to explain the subsequent
</p>
<p>situation of the parties. When they met again at
</p>
<p>breakfast, the swimming eye and changing cheek of
</p>
<p>Delia told that she had been made acquainted with
</p>
<p>all that had passed. The countenance of Douglas
</p>
<p>beamed with high excitement, at once pleasant and
</p>
<p>painful. A glance of triumphant encouragement to
</p>
<p>Delia, and her answering tearful smile, showed that
</p>
<p>they perfectly understood each other. Indeed, it was
</p>
<p>time they should, for it had been settled that B ,
</p>
<p>who was a resident and justice of the, peace of the
</p>
<p>county, should perform the marriage ceremony, according to the unceremonious law of North Carolina,

<p>lor, where B , drawing Delia to him, seated her
</p>
<p>on his knee. "I don't half like this business," said
</p>
<p>he. "I have no mind to take an active part in giving up my own little girl to this young fellow. I
</p>
<p>am too old to think of loving and fighting all in a
</p>
<p>breath, as he does, and I thought to wait till the wars
</p>
<p>were over, and here he comes and cuts me out. But
</p>
<p>I am determined to do nothing in prejudice of my
</p>
<p>claim, until I find that I have no chance. Young
</p>
<p>man," added he, in a tone gradually changing from
</p>
<p>playful to serious, "do you love this dear girl with
</p>
<p>that faithful, single-hearted love, which man owes to
</p>
<p>a woman who gives him all her heart, and entrusts
</p>
<p>to him all her happiness, and all her hopes? "
</p>
<p>As he said this he took the hand of Douglas, and
</p>
<p>went on: "Do you thus love her, and will you in
</p>
<p>good faith manifest this love, by being to her a true
</p>
<p>and devoted husband, in every change and vicissitude
</p>
<p>of life, so long as life shall last? Answer me, Douglas," he continued, with a voice approaching to
</p>
<p>sternness, and a fixed and searching look, while he
</p>
<p>strongly grasped the young man's hand.
</p>
<p>"Assuredly I will," said Douglas, somewhat hurt.
</p>
<p>"And you, dear," said B , resuming his kind
</p>
<p>and playful tone, " do you love this young fellow ill

</p>
<p>faithful as his wife? "

</p>
<p>-Gathering tears and tremblings of distress;
</p>
<p>And cheeks all pale, which, but an hour ago,
</p>
<p>Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness:
</p>
<p>And there were sudden partings, such as press
</p>
<p>The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs,
</p>
<p>Which ne'er might be repeated: Who could guess
</p>
<p>If ever more should meet those mutual eyes?
</p>
<p>BYRON.
</p>
<p>AND so it was. I can add nothing to the language
</p>
<p>of the poet. I can supply nothing to the imagination of the reader. Thus Douglas and Delia parted.
</p>
<p>lie accompanied his new acquaintance to the southern capital; he there met with men whose names
</p>
<p>live and will live in the history of their country, and
</p>
<p>whose memories will be honored while virtue is held
</p>
<p>in reverence among men. From these, and especially
</p>
<p>from the accomplished gentleman to whose friendship he had been introduced by his uncle and Mr.
</p>
<p>B-, he received such lights as dispelled every
</p>
<p>shadow of doubt from his mind. The wrongs of
</p>
<p>Virginia, her rights and her remedies, became the
</p>
<p>subject of all his thoughts, and he burned with
</p>
<p>impatience for the time when he might draw his

</p>
<p>267
</p>
<p>expressed it, the lessons learned in the school of her
</p>
<p>oppressors.
</p>
<p>That time at length arrived. Returning by the
</p>
<p>upper road which skirts the foot of the mountains,
</p>
<p>he re-entered Virginia nearly at the spot to which
</p>
<p>his brother had gone in quest of him. There, as he
</p>
<p>had been taught to expect, he found Schwartz,
</p>
<p>whose reception of him fully justified the assurances
</p>
<p>of B. To that gentleman he showed unbounded
</p>
<p>devotion, delighted to speak of favors received at
</p>
<p>his hands, and of " moving accidents by flood and
</p>
<p>field," which they had encountered together. Next
</p>
<p>to B-, in his estimation, stood Mrs. Trevor; then
</p>
<p>Delia, for whom when a child he had formed a passionate attachment; and last, Mr. Trevor himself,
</p>
<p>whom, after the rest, he respected and admired
</p>
<p>above all human beings. A hint from B- that
</p>
<p>Douglas was the husband of Delia placed him at
</p>
<p>once in the same catalogue of worthies, and from
</p>
<p>the first moment he devoted himself not less to his
</p>
<p>personal service than to the advancement of the
</p>
<p>common cause. lie had already organized a small
</p>
<p>corps, the command of which he unreservedly surrendered, making it his constant study to recommend the new commander to the confidence of the
</p>
<p>men.

<p>No man could deserve it better, or was better
</p>
<p>lualified to win it. Frank, affable, generous, and

</p>
<p>dignity, without ever passing by that name. With
</p>
<p>nothing repulsive, austere, or cold in his demeanor,
</p>
<p>he was a man whose orders no soldier would question, whose displeasure no gentleman would choose
</p>
<p>to incur, whose feelings no friend, however careless,
</p>
<p>would wound. Liberally supplied with money by
</p>
<p>his southern fiiends, and instructed by Schwartz in
</p>
<p>the judicious use of it, he took effectual measures to
</p>
<p>prevent distress in the families of his followers. A
</p>
<p>small sum amply satisfied their simple wants, and
</p>
<p>his men had the satisfaction of knowing that their
</p>
<p>families suffered nothing by their absence from their
</p>
<p>little farms.

<p>Beside the small embodied corps I have mentioned, the whole population of that warlike district

<p>were placed under a sort of organization, so that,
</p>
<p>while they pursued their occupations of hunting or
</p>
<p>farming, they were prepared, at any moment, to join
</p>
<p>an expedition or to resist an attack.
</p>
<p>Schwartz, who knew the country, inch by inch,
</p>
<p>made Douglas acquainted with all its strengths and
</p>
<p>all its passes, so that he soon became an expert
</p>
<p>woodsman, and an active mountaineer. His first
</p>
<p>care was to select a place for a stationary camp.
</p>
<p>For this purpose he chose a position strong by
</p>
<p>nature, which he made nearly impregnable. He
</p>
<p>aext provided horses enough to mount a part of his
</p>
<p>corps. For these the rich herbage of the mountains

<p>afforded abundant subsistence during the summer

</p>
<p>lead mines were just at his back, beyond the Alleghanny. Powder is made of good quality in all that
</p>
<p>region, and the quantity necessary for the rifle is so
</p>
<p>small, that the rifleman may be said to carry a hundred lives in his powder-horn. Of provisions he had
</p>
<p>plenty, though wanting many things deemed necessary in a regular army. But the pure air of the
</p>
<p>mountains, and the exercise of hunting and scouting,
</p>
<p>preserved the health of the men, without tents, or
</p>
<p>salt, or vinegar, or vegetables of any kind. Venison

<p>process called jerking, was prepared in the season
</p>
<p>of abundance for winter use, and proved the best
</p>
<p>sort of food for a marauding corps. Light, compact,
</p>
<p>and nutritious, there is no diet on which a man can
</p>
<p>travel so far or fight so hard.
</p>
<p>Nothing now remained but to make his enemy
</p>
<p>feel him. Stooping from his mountain fastness, he
</p>
<p>soon broke up all the military posts in the adjacent
</p>
<p>counties; so that, in a few weeks, not a blue-coat
</p>
<p>was to be seen on the south side of Staunton river,
</p>
<p>Freed from the presence of their enemy, the people
</p>
<p>were found ready to rise en masse. He dissuaded
</p>
<p>them from doing more than to put themselves in
</p>
<p>readiness for action, to furnish him needed supplies,
</p>
<p>for which he paid fairly, and to give him notice of
</p>
<p>the approach of the enemy. For this purpose he

<p>established a sort of half military organization, and

</p>
<p>thus adapted to any occasion which could be
</p>
<p>expected to offer, after sweeping away the enemy
</p>
<p>from the south side of the river, he proceeded to
</p>
<p>break up the posts in the counties on the northern
</p>
<p>bank. In the end, though the enemy were nominally in possession of all the country between James
</p>
<p>river and Roanoke, they held no post higher than
</p>
<p>Lynchburg, nor aly farther south than Farmville.
</p>
<p>Above this last place, their scouts and foraging parties showed themselves occasionally, but never ventured to leave the banks of James river for more
</p>
<p>than a single night.
</p>
<p>At Lynchburg, not long before the time at which
</p>
<p>our story commences, two companies had been
</p>
<p>posted. As Douglas had never shown a force of
</p>
<p>more than a hundred men, no fear of an attack on
</p>
<p>that point was entertained. But suddenly collecting
</p>
<p>a number of auxiliaries, he struck at them, drove
</p>
<p>them from their post, enriched his men with every
</p>
<p>thing that the laws of war permitted him to seize,
</p>
<p>and retreated to his stronghold in the mountains.
</p>
<p>The supplies of arms, ammunition, clothing, and
</p>
<p>blankets, thus procured, put him in condition to
</p>
<p>increase his corps, if necessary. Thus, at the time
</p>
<p>of which we speak, having little more than a hundred men embodied, he could have marched five
</p>
<p>times that number to Richmond; and, for any service
</p>
<p>near at hand, could have commanded a yet larger

<p>essentials. There was " not a bit of feather in his
</p>
<p>host," nor drum, nor trumpet, nor banner. But
</p>
<p>there were stout hearts, and strong hands, and fleet
</p>
<p>limbs, and good rifles, and knives and tomahawks;
</p>
<p>and that system and harmony which spring from a
</p>
<p>sense of danger, a high purpose, and confidence in
</p>
<p>a leader. To the listening ear, a whisper speaks
</p>
<p>louder than a trumpet to the heedless. To the
</p>
<p>trusting heart, the chieftain's voice supersedes the
</p>
<p>spirit-stirring drum.
</p>
<p>While Douglas thus maintained his position among
</p>
<p>the mountains, it became a sort of Cave of Adullam.
</p>
<p>His little corps was a nucleus to which the discontented and persecuted gathered continually. His
</p>
<p>embodied force was increased, while the organization of the neighboring population became more
</p>
<p>perfect, their confidence firmer, their zeal more ardent.
</p>
<p>So effectually had he broken the power of the Central
</p>
<p>Government in that quarter, that it had been deemed
</p>
<p>expedient to throw a much larger federal force into
</p>
<p>Lynchburg, to curb his progress in that direction, and
</p>
<p>to restrain the disaffected in the counties along the
</p>
<p>north bank of James river. Could he have cooperated with the friends of Virginia there, it was not
</p>
<p>clear that the flame might not spread on and on, in
</p>
<p>the direction of Washington, until the very seat of
</p>
<p>empire might be unsafe. Hence a regiment had been

<p>detached from the army at Richmond, and another

</p>
<p>ments, Douglas had no doubt that the purpose of such
</p>
<p>an assemblage of force was not merely preventive.
</p>
<p>He saw that attempts would be made to recover the
</p>
<p>ground which the enemy had lost on the south side of
</p>
<p>James river; and that, by remaining strictly on the
</p>
<p>defensive, he might be forced to withdraw his embodied force to their mountain stronghold, and not
</p>
<p>only lose the aid of his irregulars, but give them up
</p>
<p>to the vengeance of the enemy. Under these circumstances, attack was the most effectual form of defence,
</p>
<p>and boldness was true prudence.
</p>
<p>The time, too, was at hand for the decisive movement, in the lower counties, for the relief of Richmond. The desired diversion had been effected, and
</p>
<p>Douglas found himself capable of bringing into the
</p>
<p>field a force, the presence of which would be no inconsiderable aid to that about to assemble below. To
</p>
<p>strike at his enemy therefore, to overwhelm him if
</p>
<p>possible, and, if not, to elude him and fall down to
</p>
<p>the assistance of B , seemed to be the surest plan for
</p>
<p>preserving the safety and independence even of the
</p>
<p>mountain region. If successful, every desirable end
</p>
<p>would be accomplished. Even should he fail, his
</p>
<p>duty to the faithful yeomanry and peasantry of that
</p>
<p>devoted section, was rather to draw the enemy away
</p>
<p>after him toward Richmond, than by falling directly
</p>
<p>back, or even by remaining where he was, to invite
</p>
<p>them to overrun the country which had afforded him
</p>
<p>such zealous and efficient co-operation.

<p>Influenced by these considerations, Douglas had

</p>
<p>273
</p>
<p>despatched Schwartz to lay them before B , and
</p>
<p>receive his instructions. He had long ago recognised
</p>
<p>him as the person of whom his aunt had said that
</p>
<p>" the destiny of Virginia depended on him." He had
</p>
<p>received at his hands the sort of authority which he
</p>
<p>wielded, now indeed by his own personal influence
</p>
<p>and character, but originally as the trusted representative of B . He had no mind to shake off that
</p>
<p>character. He had seen that, by means not exactly
</p>
<p>understood, that gentleman commanded resources,
</p>
<p>both at home and abroad, which enabled him to
</p>
<p>meditate plans, in which all the operations of
</p>
<p>Douglas's corps, however brilliant, were but circumstances of less importance themselves than in their
</p>
<p>relations.
</p>
<p>Schwartz was the sole medium of communication
</p>
<p>between the two. With nothing in his appearance to
</p>
<p>attract attention-nothing in his manners or common
</p>
<p>style of conversation betokening powers superior to
</p>
<p>those of any other peasant-his intelligence and
</p>
<p>fidelity supplied the place of letters. He understood

<p>every thing, and forgot nothing that was said to him.

</p>
<p>harmless gossip, all he chanced to fall in with. He
</p>
<p>was a man who knew how to have business any

<p>where, and at any moment; and he passed along

<p>strong-winged flight which indicates a distant and

<p>important destination.
</p>
<p>In one of Arthur's visits to Lucia (his betrothal to
</p>
<p>whom was no longer a secret in her father's family),
</p>
<p>he was made acquainted with the history of Douglas's
</p>
<p>marriage. He was also entrusted with the important
</p>
<p>information that the gallant leader, with whose exploits the country rung, and whom his imagination
</p>
<p>had endued with almost superhuman powers, was his
</p>
<p>own best beloved brother. He was instantly on fire
</p>
<p>to join him, and Schwartz was instructed to convey
</p>
<p>to him the necessary intelligence; and, if possible, to
</p>
<p>fall in with him on the way. But he had been
</p>
<p>turned aside by objects of higher moment on his
</p>
<p>return and Arthur had got ahead of him. Having
</p>
<p>ascertained this fact in the county of Charlotte, where

<p>their roads came together, Schwartz travelled hard to

<p>overtake him; left his tired horse at the entrance of

<p>ANONYMOUS.
</p>
<p>LET us now return to the deep glen, at the bottom
</p>
<p>of which we left our friend Arthur, accompanied by
</p>
<p>his mountain guide. Schwartz was welcomed with
</p>
<p>cordial joy by his comrades, and, having. asked for
</p>
<p>the Captain, was told he was in his tent. Arthur
</p>
<p>looked around in vain for a tent, but saw none.
</p>
<p>The beetling crags on both sides of the dell seemed
</p>
<p>to be the only shelter that the place afforded. But
</p>
<p>against the rock, a hundred yards below, and
</p>
<p>directly beneath the spot from which Schwartz had
</p>
<p>given notice of his presence, hung a piece of tentcloth. One edge of this was tacked to a pole which
</p>
<p>lay horizontally against the rocky wall, the ends
</p>
<p>being supported by forks about ten feet long. This
</p>
<p>proved to be a sort of door to a wide-mouthed
</p>
<p>cavernous recess ill the rock, deep enough to afford

<p>room for the few little conveniences which an officer

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>Approaching this, Schwartz lifted the corner, and
</p>
<p>our travellers stood in the presence of Douglas.
</p>
<p>Ie was seated at a coarse table, poring over a
</p>
<p>rude manuscript map, and did not lift his head until
</p>
<p>he heard the word "brother" uttered by the wellknown voice of Arthur. In a moment they were in
</p>
<p>each other's arms, and, in the next, the new-comer
</p>
<p>was overwhelmed with questions about his father,
</p>
<p>mother, and various friends. Some indeed were not
</p>
<p>named; for, though Schwartz was in the secret of
</p>
<p>the fact, he was incapable of being let into the
</p>
<p>deeper mystery of hearts like those of Douglas and
</p>
<p>Delia. To such the utterance of a beloved name in
</p>
<p>the presence of the uninitiated is an unpardonable
</p>
<p>profanation. But though that of Delia was not
</p>
<p>spoken, Arthur took care so to emphasize his account
</p>
<p>of the health of his uncle's family, as to convey to
</p>
<p>the mind of Douglas an assurance of all he wished
</p>
<p>to hear. But if Schwartz was not deep in the tender mysteries of refined and delicate love, no man
</p>
<p>better understood a hint, or better knew how to
</p>
<p>improve it. He accordingly interrupted the conversation, just to say that he brought important
</p>
<p>intelligence, which must be communicated that
</p>
<p>night; adding that he would leave them together for
</p>
<p>an hour. He now withdrew, and afforded the
</p>
<p>desired opportunity for unreserved conversation.
</p>
<p>"My Delia," said Douglas; "I understand that
</p>
<p>she is well, and, I hope, happy."

</p>
<p>terms that fill her heart with pride, and leave no

<p>room there for alarm or melancholy. She feels as
</p>
<p>becomes a soldier's wife, anxious for her husband's
</p>
<p>fate, but confident in his fortunes. She has caught
</p>
<p>this notion from Mr. B , who is her oracle, and
</p>
<p>who seems to have imparted to her, not only all his
</p>
<p>sentiments, but all the energy and buoyancy of his
</p>
<p>self-confident mind."
</p>
<p>"Thank God "' said Douglas. "Just so would
</p>
<p>I have her to be. I knew it would be so. I saw
</p>
<p>her noble mother, when danger threatened my
</p>
<p>uncle; and I saw her too. But this is the first positive information, on that point, that has reached me
</p>
<p>since I have been here. Mr. B  and I can only
</p>
<p>correspond by messages through Schwartz, and
</p>
<p>though he is plain and accurate as a printed book in
</p>
<p>repeating what he understands, yet ideas of this sort
</p>
<p>are not in his line. And my good and venerable
</p>
<p>old father-are you here with his permission?"
</p>
<p>"I am not; nor does he know where I am. I
</p>
<p>have no doubt that I should have his approbation if
</p>
<p>he did. I am sure you have."
</p>
<p>"I!" exclaimed Douglas, with a start of violent
</p>
<p>surprise. "What does he know of me?"
</p>
<p>"Nothing at all," said Arthur, smiling. "But he
</p>
<p>knows of a certain partisan leader, whom the world
</p>
<p>calls Captain Douglas, and if I can read the old

</p>
<p>As Arthur spoke the eyes of Douglas filled, and,
</p>
<p>pressing his hand to his brow, he bowed his head a
</p>
<p>moment on the table. Then rising, he stood erect,
</p>
<p>and looking up with a rapt and abstracted air, his
</p>
<p>eye flashing through his tears, he folded his arms,
</p>
<p>and speaking in the measured tone of one who feels
</p>
<p>deeply, but in whose mind thought masters feeling,
</p>
<p>he parodied that noble speech which Shakspeare
</p>
<p>puts in the mouth of Prince Henry:
</p>
<p>"Then in the closing of some glorious day,
</p>
<p>When I shall wear a garment all of blood,
</p>
<p>And stain my favors with a bloody mask,
</p>
<p>I will be bold to tell him,' I am your son.'"

<p>day,

<p>Welcomes her warrior home."

<p>"I tell you, Arthur, that, in thoughts like these,

<p>there is a rapture which makes this hole in the rock

<p>a palace, and this flinty couch a bed of down. Are

<p>tries to hide the secret of his thoughts from himself."
</p>
<p>Thus the brothers conversed until Schwartz returned and claimed the Captain's ear; who began by
</p>
<p>asking what news he brought from B"The Colonel (so he always designated B ) likes

<p>" If I do so, where am I to find him precisely?"

<p>all friendly, because as long as things stay as they
</p>
<p>are, their railroad an't worth an old flint, and so they
</p>
<p>are patching up all the old cars, and fixing every
</p>
<p>thing for the Colonel, as soon as he can start a
</p>
<p>regiment or so, to make a dash at Petersburg, and
</p>
<p>so hold on there till the rest of his men join him.
</p>
<p>Now, if we were to be the first there, Captain, I
</p>
<p>have a notion that we'd be the very boys for them
</p>
<p>chaps at Petersburg."

</p>
<p>I understand my old acquaintance, Col. AMason, at
</p>
<p>Lynchburg, has a great desire to see me, and I should
</p>
<p>hate to disappoint him."
</p>
<p>" I don't think he commands there now," said
</p>
<p>Schwartz. "There is another regiment come from
</p>
<p>the North to join him, and they say the other is the
</p>
<p>oldest colonel."
</p>
<p>"That is of course," said Douglas, " for Mason is
</p>
<p>the youngest in the army. But I am not sorry for
</p>
<p>the exchange, for they have hardly sent as good a
</p>
<p>one. There is not a man among them I would not
</p>
<p>rather meet than Mason. Have you been able to
</p>
<p>learn the particulars of their force there?"
</p>
<p>"As well as I can understand," replied Schwartz,
</p>
<p>"the whole number is not far from a thousand, and
</p>
<p>may be a few more."
</p>
<p>" A thousand! Can we raise men enough to strike
</p>
<p>at them before they think of it a?"
</p>
<p>" I have not a doubt of it, sir, if we could get at
</p>
<p>them on fair terms. The people along down between here and Staunton river don't like the thoughts
</p>
<p>of what them fellows may do to them, and they are
</p>
<p>keen to take them before they are ready. I talked
</p>
<p>to the head-men among them, as you told me, and
</p>
<p>they all see that the right way is to try to get the
</p>
<p>first blow. Because, you see, Captain, when we an't
</p>
<p>gaining we are losing. If we let the enemy hold
</p>
<p>Lynchburg, and they find two regiments will not do,
</p>
<p>they will bring four, and so on, till they get the upper

<p>about here for old and new. But if we could make
</p>
<p>out to give them a real beating, and so drive them
</p>
<p>clean off, why all the country as far as the Rappahannock would rise that minute, and they'd have
</p>
<p>enough to do to hold their own at Fredericksburg."
</p>
<p>" I suppose you said all this to Mr. B~?"
</p>
<p>" To be sure I did, sir; and he thinks just as we
</p>
<p>do about it, only he is dubious about attacking a
</p>
<p>fortified camp, as they call it, just with rifles."
</p>
<p>"He is right about that," replied Douglas.
</p>
<p>"Riflemen are the best troops in the world to defend
</p>
<p>a breastwork, but they are the worst to attack one.
</p>
<p>I had hopes, however, that we might have drawn
</p>
<p>out the enemy by some device, even when Mason
</p>
<p>commanded. He is too brave to be ashamed to be
</p>
<p>prudent. I wish I knew whom they have sent to
</p>
<p>supersede him. But, whoever he is, it is a hundred
</p>
<p>to one, that being set over the head of an abler man,
</p>
<p>he will be impatient to show his superiority by
</p>
<p>reversing his predecessor's plans, and shaming the
</p>
<p>prudence of Mason by some hasty display of valor.
</p>
<p>If I did but know who was in command!"
</p>
<p>"I tried to find that out," replied Schwartz; " because 1 knew you were pretty well acquainted with
</p>
<p>the most of them. You remember, sir, you told me
</p>
<p>from the first almost exactly how this Col. Mason
</p>
<p>was going to do. But I could not find any body
</p>
<p>that could tell me the new Colonel's name. But,

</p>
<p>"I am afraid that is all too true," said Douglas,

<p>"and if no such chance offers, we shall have to give

<p>them the slip as B  proposes; and I should hate

</p>
<p>"You must understand, Captain," continued
</p>
<p>Schwartz, " that I had allotted to fall in with your
</p>
<p>brother about Little Roanoke bridge, where our roads
</p>
<p>come together. The people there are friendly, and
</p>
<p>mighty clever people, and if they don't know all
</p>
<p>about me, they don't want much of it; for they are
</p>
<p>our own sort of folks, and true as steel. So I thought
</p>
<p>I could depend on them to take notice for me when
</p>
<p>such a man might pass, and let me know. When
</p>
<p>I got there, by all I could learn, your brother had
</p>
<p>not gone by; and, as I was pretty tired, and that is
</p>
<p>one of the places where I commonly lie by to pick
</p>
<p>up news, I thought I would stop a while.

<p>"I had not been there long, before here comes

</p>
<p>any body, he just claps to talking to me. And he
</p>
<p>run on about one thing and another, and there was
</p>
<p>nothing I wanted to know but what he told me, only
</p>
<p>just I knew it all before. But I thought, may be, I
</p>
<p>mnight get something out of him, so I let him talk,
</p>
<p>and I sot and listened.
</p>
<p>"After a while he gets to talking about you.
</p>
<p>And, Lord! how he wished you would come in his
</p>
<p>way; and how he would have served you, if you
</p>
<p>had tried to beat up his quarters, like you did them
</p>
<p>fellows at Lynchburg. But he was in hopes to
</p>
<p>have a clip at you yet, only just you were always
</p>
<p>hiding and skulking in the mountains, like a wolf,
</p>
<p>and then coming down in the night to kill sheep.
</p>
<p>And he reckoned you knew where the dogs was, and
</p>
<p>took care to keep out of their way. And then he
</p>
<p>laughed, and thought he was mighty smart. So,
</p>
<p>thought I,' stranger, if you have a mind to get into
</p>
<p>hot water, may be you may have a chance.' So I
</p>
<p>speaks up; and, says I,'after all, that Captain
</p>
<p>Douglas an't half the man he's cracked up for, no
</p>
<p>how.'"
</p>
<p>" Do you know him?" says he.
</p>
<p>"I guess I do," says I; "he is cunning enough,
</p>
<p>and he has got tricks enough, and signs and countersigns to keep out of harm's way; but," says I,
</p>
<p>"if a iman could just get hold of his signs, and
</p>
<p>so get at him, he an't nothing for a right, real hard
</p>
<p>fight."

</p>
<p>may be; and all the folks through the country there
</p>
<p>stands guard for him, and nobody else knows where
</p>
<p>he is."
</p>
<p>"That's very true," says I; "but then you see,
</p>
<p>stranger, when too many folks has got a secret,
</p>
<p>then it an't a secret no more."
</p>
<p>"It's a wonder," says he, "some of them don't
</p>
<p>tell."
</p>
<p>" May be they cannot get any thing by telling,"
</p>
<p>says I. "There's many a poor fellow there, to my
</p>
<p>knowing, that don't see a dollar once a year, and its
</p>
<p>mighty little the sight of a few yellow jackets would
</p>
<p>not make them tell, only just they never seed any,
</p>
<p>and don't know what they are. But they'll be right
</p>
<p>apt to find out."
</p>
<p>"' You talk like you know that part of the country," says he. " May be you know something about
</p>
<p>it."
</p>
<p>"May be I might," says I.'; But then," says I,
</p>
<p>" it don't become a poor fellow, like me, to know

<p>any thing that a grand officer, with his fine apperlets, all of solid gold, don't know. Lord!" says I,
</p>
<p>" if I had but half the money you give for your
</p>
<p>apperlets, I reckon I'd know something then."
</p>
<p>And with that he looks right hard at me, and

<p>bays he, " May be you'd like to list for a soldier."

</p>
<p>part. And that's the reason," says I, "I would not
</p>
<p>stay up yonder."
</p>
<p>"Why," says he, "do you live there, when you
</p>
<p>are at home?"
</p>
<p>"I cannot say," says I, " that I have got a home
</p>
<p>rightly anywhere. But I did live there, after a fashion;
</p>
<p>and they wanted me to do like the rest of them, and
</p>
<p>quit my business and keep guard, and stop every man
</p>
<p>that could not give the signs. And what was I to
</p>
<p>get by it? Just nothing at all. If I had any bread
</p>
<p>of my own to eat, why, I might eat it; and if I killed
</p>
<p>a deer, they'd take their share, and thought they did
</p>
<p>great things if they let me keep the skin; but as to
</p>
<p>pay, they don't think of such a thing. But that would
</p>
<p>not do for me," says I; "and, more than that, it won't
</p>
<p>do for more, besides me, whatever Captain Douglas
</p>
<p>may think of it, I can tell him."
</p>
<p>" Well," says he, "if you'll list with me you shall
</p>
<p>have pay, and bounty, and clothes, and rations, and
</p>
<p>all.'Cause," says he, " the President, he keeps the
</p>
<p>key of the treasury, and we are his soldiers, and we
</p>
<p>all live like fighting cocks, I can tell you."
</p>
<p>"Well," says I, " I'd like to list well enough, only
</p>
<p>just I guess if once you had me for a soldier, you'd
</p>
<p>make me tell all I know, and ax me no odds; and,"
</p>
<p>says I, " I have been a-thinking, if I could meet with
</p>
<p>any right clever gentleman, that would pay me
</p>
<p>for telling, I'd tell it all first, and then list after.

</p>
<p>" Well," says he, " do you know Douglas's signs,
</p>
<p>enough to carry a man to his camp as a friend?"
</p>
<p>"I guess I do," says I, "and more than that,
</p>
<p>too."
</p>
<p>"And what do you know?" says he.
</p>
<p>"That's telling," says I.
</p>
<p>"But," says he, "I want to know all about it,"
</p>
<p>says he, "because Col. Mason, there, at Lynchburg, is
</p>
<p>determined to break Douglas up, if he can get at him;
</p>
<p>and he is looking every day for more men from the
</p>
<p>North to help him."
</p>
<p>"Well," says I, " I can put him in a way to get at
</p>
<p>him, and not go up there into the mountains neither.'Cause," says I, "'that's an ugly place. It an't one
</p>
<p>regiment, nor two neither hardly, that could do much
</p>
<p>there. And then, again, if Douglas was to find too
</p>
<p>many coming against him, he'd be away t'other side
</p>
<p>of Salem before they'd get there."
</p>
<p>"And how is a body to get at him?" says he.

<p>" Ah I" says I, " that's a long story."
</p>
<p>"Well," says he, " I see what you are after, and if
</p>
<p>you'll put me in a way to give Col. Mason a fair clip
</p>
<p>at him, it will make my fortune, and then I'll be bound
</p>
<p>to see you paid handsomely."
</p>
<p>"That an't what I am after," says I.
</p>
<p>"Why, don't you want money 2" says he.
</p>
<p>"To be sure I do," says I; " but that an't money."

<p>" That's something like," says I. "As to what I

</p>
<p>289
</p>
<p>can do, I can put you in a way to catch Captain
</p>
<p>Douglas out of the mountains, with as many men as
</p>
<p>you please to bring agin him."
</p>
<p>" Well," says he, "if you'll do that, I'll pay you a
</p>
<p>hundred dollars."
</p>
<p>" The dear Lord I" says I. "A hundred dollars!
</p>
<p>I never expected to have that much money in my
</p>
<p>life I"
</p>
<p>" May be it's too much," says he. "May be fifty
</p>
<p>will do?"
</p>
<p>"No, no," says I; "a hundred will do mighty
</p>
<p>well; so let me have the cash, and I'll tell you all."
</p>
<p>"That won't do," says he. "How do I know
</p>
<p>that what you are going to tell me will do me any
</p>
<p>good?"' Well," says I, " I reckon if one won't another
</p>
<p>will."
</p>
<p>So, with that, he studied a while, and says he:
</p>
<p>" Well, I'll give you my note for a hundred dollars,
</p>
<p>to be paid directly after Col. Mason gets a lick at
</p>
<p>Douglas in the low country, by my help."
</p>
<p>" Cannot you give me an order on Mr. Morton, here,

<p>in the same way?" says I.
</p>
<p>"You are mighty tight," says he; " but may be I
</p>
<p>can."
</p>
<p>So, with that he speaks to Mr. Morton, and he
</p>
<p>agreed to accept the order. You see, sir, Mlr.

<p>Morton, as I told you, is a true-hearted Virginian;

<p>and he knows me, and I just sorter winked at him,

</p>
<p>paying him again after he paid me, Mr. Morton
</p>
<p>hadn't no thought of it, nor I neither. But he seed
</p>
<p>what I was after, and says he to the Captain: " To
</p>
<p>be sure, sir, it's nothing I would not do to serve the
</p>
<p>country." And with that they fixed the order all
</p>
<p>right, and gives it to me, and I slips it back again
</p>
<p>into Mr. Morton's hand. And then I takes the
</p>
<p>Captain out again, and tells him the way up here;
</p>
<p>and, says I, "Now, if you can get to see Captain
</p>
<p>Douglas, you must fix a good story to tell him."
</p>
<p>"And what must that be?" says he.
</p>
<p>" Why, you have only just to tell him that you
</p>
<p>have raised a parcel of men in Bedford county, or
</p>
<p>somewhere thereaway, sorter toward Lynchburg, and
</p>
<p>you want to know where to join him. Then he'll be
</p>
<p>sure to tell you when he is coming down out of the
</p>
<p>mountains, and he'll name a place for you to meet
</p>
<p>him at, and then if you don't fix him about right, it
</p>
<p>an't my fault."
</p>
<p>"But how am I to get to him?" says he.
</p>
<p>"That's it," says I, "and that's what you never
</p>
<p>could do without help. You see," says I, " sir, every
</p>
<p>man in that country lives by hunting, more or less;
</p>
<p>and every man has a rifle for himself, and one for
</p>
<p>every one of his boys, and may be more. And when
</p>
<p>a fellow is going anywhere, he never knows when

<p>he may see a deer; so you never can catch them

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>291
</p>
<p>to stop a man, they don't bawl at him and ask for
</p>
<p>the countersign. That sort of thing may do in an
</p>
<p>army, but it won't do with folks that have not got an
</p>
<p>army to back them. So you may fall in with ever so
</p>
<p>many of them, and they'll find you out; but if they
</p>
<p>choose to let you pass, you'll never find them out, nor
</p>
<p>know what they are after."
</p>
<p>"But how are they to find me out," says he, "if
</p>
<p>they an't got no countersign?"
</p>
<p>"They an't got no countersign, rightly," says I;
</p>
<p>"but it is pretty much the same thing, if a man asks
</p>
<p>you a civil question, and you don't know what answer
</p>
<p>to give him. Now, suppose you was travelling along
</p>
<p>there, and you meets one of them fellows, and he was
</p>
<p>to ask you, mighty innocent like, what parts you were
</p>
<p>from. What would you say?"
</p>
<p>" I don't know," says he. " May be I'd tell him I
</p>
<p>was from down about Halifax court-house."
</p>
<p>"And that minute," says I, " he'd know all about
</p>
<p>yOU.';
</p>
<p>" How's that?" says he.
</p>
<p>"Why, that's the way they ax for the countersign,"
</p>
<p>says I.
</p>
<p>"What is the countersign?" says he.
</p>
<p>"CURRITUCK," says I; " when they ax you that,
</p>
<p>you must say you come from Currituck."
</p>
<p>"And is that all?" says he. "Why, that is a
</p>
<p>countersign, sure enough. But don't they never
</p>
<p>change it?"

<p>through the country, for that; but it answers mighty
</p>
<p>well, the way they fix it.- They don't let you off
</p>
<p>with one question, just so, but they'll ask you a heap
</p>
<p>more; and they'll say a heap of simple things to you
</p>
<p>just to hear what you'll sayv; and just about the time
</p>
<p>you think you have fooled them, they'll find you out.
</p>
<p>There's a parcel of sharp fellows up thereaway, mind,
</p>
<p>I tell you; and you'll have to get your lesson mighty
</p>
<p>well before you go there. You see, some will ask
</p>
<p>you one question and some another. You don't know
</p>
<p>what it's going to be; so I must tell you all the straight
</p>
<p>of it, and you must practise before we part; and then,"
</p>
<p>says I, " you can write it all down, and all the way
</p>
<p>you go you can be saying it over." So, with that, sir,
</p>
<p>I tells him the biggest part of our questions; but you
</p>
<p>may be sure I gave him wrong answers to every one
</p>
<p>of them. But then I told our people at the different
</p>
<p>stations along about him, and told them to pass him,
</p>
<p>and never let him know but what his answers were
</p>
<p>all right. So then I tells him that when he got to you,
</p>
<p>you would want to know, may be, how he came by
</p>
<p>the signs; and, says I, " when he axes you that, you
</p>
<p>must tell him you got them from Job Dixon," says L' That's a fellow the Captain keeps busy recruiting
</p>
<p>away down the country, and when he hears that, he

<p>won't suspicion you the least in the world;'cause you

<p>see," says I, " the man they call Job Dixon has got
</p>
<p>another name besides that, and that name an't nothing

<p>fixed all this way, that I might let you know exactly,
</p>
<p>so that if the fellow should come when I was out of
</p>
<p>the way, you might know what to think of him, just
</p>
<p>as if I was here. And it won't do to let him see me,
</p>
<p>no how."
</p>
<p>"Job Dixon!" said Douglas. "Well, let me
</p>
<p>make a memorandum of that name."
</p>
<p>Saying this, he took a letter from his pocket, and
</p>
<p>endorsing the name of Job Dixon on the back of
</p>
<p>it, as that of the writer, threw it on the table.
</p>
<p>"That will do," said Schwartz. " te will be here
</p>
<p>bright and early in the morning, and when he sees
</p>
<p>that, he will feel as safe as a rat in a mill."
</p>
<p>"Here in the morning!" said Douglas. "How
</p>
<p>can you be sure of that?"
</p>
<p>"I seed him from the top of the mountain,"
</p>
<p>replied Schwartz, " when Witt stopped him. I told
</p>
<p>Witt to keep him all night, and send him on in the
</p>
<p>morning, with a couple of fellows to show him the

</p>
<p>So I am a thinking it would be well to fix the time
</p>
<p>for meeting this fellow about the tenth of the month,
</p>
<p>and then, if we can catch them in their own trap, we
</p>
<p>shall have time to follow up the blow and break up
</p>
<p>their whole establishment there at Lynchburg, and
</p>
<p>then march boldly down the straight road."
</p>
<p>"' Do you know of any crossing-place oni Staunton

<p>river, in the direction of Lynchburg," asked Douglas, " that would answer for an ambuscade?"
</p>
<p>"I have a notion," said Schwartz, "that Jones's
</p>
<p>Ford would suit as well as any other; because
</p>
<p>there's a deep hollow comes down on both sides of
</p>
<p>it, and thick woods on the hills."
</p>
<p>"That will do then," said Douglas. "So now
</p>
<p>let us take our supper and go to rest; for I must be
</p>
<p>at the piquet in time to meet your man. Before
</p>
<p>you go to sleep, suppose you send one of our boys
</p>
<p>to tell them to stop him if he gets there before me."
</p>
<p>The supper was produced, and fully justified what
</p>
<p>Witt had told Arthur of the fare he might expect.
</p>
<p>As to lodging, bear-skins were plenty, and so were
</p>
<p>blankets, which had been collected during the expedition against Lynchburg. But a rock is a hard

<p>The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep.
</p>
<p>WHEN Arthur awoke, he found himself alone.
</p>
<p>The sun was high in the heavens, but a deep shadow
</p>
<p>hung over the dark glen, into which his rays never
</p>
<p>looked, except at noon-day. Arthur now walked
</p>
<p>out, and amused himself with gazing around on the
</p>
<p>singular spot which his brother had chosen as a
</p>
<p>place of refuge. It was, indeed, a place of strength,
</p>
<p>which seemed calculated to bid defiance to any
</p>
<p>thing but famine.
</p>
<p>The glen, at this point, might be some two hundred feet deep. Above and below, the little stream
</p>
<p>filled the whole chasm, pouring furiously along
</p>
<p>between overhanging cliffs. The tops of these,
</p>
<p>except in the immediate vicinity, were crowned with
</p>
<p>lofty trees, which, nodding to each other across the
</p>
<p>gulph, in some places nearly intermingled their
</p>
<p>branches. The valley, just where Douglas had
</p>
<p>pitched his camp, was somewhat wider. Just above,
</p>
<p>the stream seemed to gush from the very bowels of
</p>
<p>the mountain, dashing, as it tumbled over a fall of
</p>
<p>twenty or thirty feet, against the dark evergreens
</p>
<p>which clustered both sides of the gulph. From

</p>
<p>thence, flowing through a wider space, it still cot
</p>
<p>fined itself to a narrow and deep channel, scooped
</p>
<p>into an almost cavernous bed, under the western
</p>
<p>cliff. Thence, turning abruptly to the southeast, it
</p>
<p>swept across the dell to the opposite hill, from which
</p>
<p>it again recoiled in like manner. There was thus,
</p>
<p>on each side, between the hill and the receding
</p>
<p>stream, a spot of dry ground, or rather rock. It was
</p>
<p>indeed nothing but a rocky shelf, a little above inundation, jutting in a half moon from the base of the
</p>
<p>cliff. About the middle of its passage from hill to
</p>
<p>hill, the stream tumbled over a ledge, the highest
</p>
<p>points of which, rising above the water, served as
</p>
<p>stepping stones, and afforded a passage across, practicable indeed, but neither commodious, nor to the
</p>
<p>eye of a stranger, even safe.
</p>
<p>The sort of stair which afforded the only approach
</p>
<p>to this savage den, hung directly over the stream, at
</p>
<p>the point where, having crossed from the western
</p>
<p>side of the glen, it again whirled back, leaving, as I
</p>
<p>have said, a dry spot on its eastern margin. At the
</p>
<p>upper corner of this shelf, where it touched the cliff,
</p>
<p>the path reached the bottom; and an hundred yards
</p>
<p>below, at the lower extremity of the same platform,
</p>
<p>hung the tent-cloth that indicated the quarters of the
</p>
<p>chief.
</p>
<p>The sort of cave, the mouth of which was concealed by this, was but a deepening of the recess
</p>
<p>under the cliff, which every where afforded a partial

<p>shelter from the weather, and a complete defence

</p>
<p>against rocks tumbled from above. Under this
</p>
<p>were the rude beds and camp-fires of the men, an6
</p>
<p>in front of them a breast-work of logs, raised high
</p>
<p>enough to afford protection from any shot fired from
</p>
<p>the opposite hill. Between the upper log and that
</p>
<p>next below it, was a sort of loop-hole, made by cutting corresponding notches in each; and as the edges
</p>
<p>of the cliffs had been shorn of all their growth, a
</p>
<p>man could not show himself on either, without
</p>
<p>being exposed to the fatal fire of men directing their
</p>
<p>aim with a rest, and in all the coolness of perfect
</p>
<p>safety.
</p>
<p>The most curious part of the whole establishment
</p>
<p>was a sort of mill. At the point where the stream,
</p>
<p>breaking over the rocky ledge of which I have spoken,
</p>
<p>swept away around the shoulder of the platform, was
</p>
<p>placed a small log pen. The end of a shaft, projecting from it, overhung the water. Into this were
</p>
<p>driven stakes, fitted at one end into large auger-holes,
</p>
<p>and, at the other, spread out like a broad oar. These
</p>
<p>fan-like extremities dipped in the water, and, yielding to its force, kept the shaft revolving night and
</p>
<p>day. Machinery equally rude connected its movements with those of a pair of light mill-stones, which
</p>
<p>found no rest, and required no attention. Though
</p>
<p>grinding less than a bushel in the hour, it still ground
</p>
<p>on and on, affording coarse bread for the whole
</p>
<p>company and showing how true the old adage, that
</p>
<p>"fair and softly go far in a day." One man was

<p>seen to replenish the hopper. Others were passing
</p>
<p>298
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and repassing, each with his share of meal. The
</p>
<p>whole was covered with rude boards. Exposed to the
</p>
<p>fire of each cliff, it was, of course, capable of being
</p>
<p>made to command both, and some of its features
</p>
<p>showed that it was intended to be occupied as a
</p>
<p>tower of strength in case of attack.
</p>
<p>In short, to the unpractised eye of Arthur, the
</p>
<p>whole presented the appearance of impregnable security and well arranged preparation. There was
</p>
<p>indeed no present danger, but the place had been
</p>
<p>chosen and fitted with a view to the last extremity.
</p>
<p>The course of the stream, tending to the south, led
</p>
<p>in a few miles into the State of North Carolina, and
</p>
<p>in that direction there was an outlet practicable,
</p>
<p>though difficult. Between the camp and the State
</p>
<p>line there was no point at which the glen could
</p>
<p>be entered; and Douglas, if driven to retreat in
</p>
<p>that direction, had none but natural obstacles to
</p>
<p>overcome.
</p>
<p>Cold weather was now approaching, and there
</p>
<p>was no station where the troops of Douglas were so
</p>
<p>little exposed to the severity of the season as this.
</p>
<p>The soft air from the waterfall, though never warm,
</p>
<p>was never intensely cold, and no other wind but that
</p>
<p>from the south ever entered the glen. Hence as
</p>
<p>many men as were not engaged on active duty were
</p>
<p>assembled here. Still the number present was but
</p>
<p>small. Some were at the piquet, some on the scout.

</p>
<p>Arthur now looked around for Schwartz; and hear.
</p>
<p>ing his voice behind one of the breast-works, pasised
</p>
<p>around the end of it, and silently joining the circle,
</p>
<p>listened to his discourse, which seemed to be a sort
</p>
<p>of military lecture.
</p>
<p>"You see, boys," said he, "as to tictacs, or
</p>
<p>whatever they call it, that sort of thing an't made for
</p>
<p>the like of us. When a parcel of fellows lists for
</p>
<p>soldiers, just because they an't got nothing else to
</p>
<p>do, and may be one half of them is cowards, and the
</p>
<p>other half not much better, they are obliged to have
</p>
<p>rules to go by. Because, if once you can beat it into
</p>
<p>a fellow's head that after he has got into danger it
</p>
<p>is safer for him to stand still than to run away, why
</p>
<p>then the worse scared he is the surer he will be to stay
</p>
<p>there. But it an't so with us, because if any of us
</p>
<p>was any way scary, he would not be here no how.
</p>
<p>The only rule for us is the Indian rule.
</p>
<p>" In the first place, it is our business always to
</p>
<p>know where the inimy is before he knows where we
</p>
<p>are, and then, if we don't want to fight him, keep
</p>
<p>out of his way. Now the right way to do that, is
</p>
<p>just to squander, like a flock of partridges.
</p>
<p>"Then if you are going to fight, the only rule is
</p>
<p>to give the word, and let every man kill all he can,
</p>
<p>and take care of himself the best he can. Now that
</p>
<p>way the riglars fight; if one man in ten kills a man,

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>there was an inimy now coming up the valley to the
</p>
<p>foot of the Devil's Back-bone, and the word was,
</p>
<p>to kill all we could before he got there, any of us
</p>
<p>here would feel mighty cheap if he did not kill somebody.:And mind, boys, whether we fight or run, whether
</p>
<p>we keep together, or squander,'two and two, is the
</p>
<p>word. You must all mate yourselves two and two,
</p>
<p>to stand together and run together, to fight together
</p>
<p>and die together. One of you must call himself
</p>
<p>number one, and the other number two, and- then,
</p>
<p>if there's a hundred together and the iniiny comes
</p>
<p>number two never fires till number one has fired and
</p>
<p>loaded again. You see, men, a fellow takes good
</p>
<p>aim, when he knows there's another one by, to hit if
</p>
<p>he misses; and fifty rifles in that way, will do more
</p>
<p>than a hundred when every one knows that's his last
</p>
<p>chance. Fifty rifles will stop a troop of horse, and
</p>
<p>a hundred cannot do no more. But if the guns are
</p>
<p>all empty, then here comes what's left of them slashing away with the broad-swords like devils. But
</p>
<p>let there be a few more guns to pepper away at them
</p>
<p>while the first are loading, and they will go to the
</p>
<p>right-about mighty quick.'" Now mind what I tell you, boys, and the first
</p>
<p>time it comes to the pinch, you'll say old Schwartz
</p>
<p>didn't fight Indians so long for nothing. And as to
</p>
<p>running, any man that's afraid to run when he sees
</p>
<p>cause, is half a coward, any how. Do you run just

<p>301
</p>
<p>man to fight that I could not trust to run. There is
</p>
<p>no harm in running, if you know where you are running to, and your friends know it too; and the right
</p>
<p>way is to fix a place, every morning, to meet at
</p>
<p>night, and let every man get there as he can, and do
</p>
<p>what mischief he can. But, mind, if it comes to
</p>
<p>that, always run two and two, and then one can help
</p>
<p>another; and if one comes up missing, the other can
</p>
<p>tell what's become of him.
</p>
<p>"I'm telling our boys," continued Schwartz, who
</p>
<p>now observed Arthur, " some of the lessons I learned
</p>
<p>among the Shawnees. You see, Mr. Arthur (you
</p>
<p>must not think strange of my calling you so, sir, for

<p>all your family seem like my own flesh and blood to

<p>me-for all you don't know how that is); you see,

<p>sir, the Captain is a regular officer, built plumb from

<p>the ground up; but for all that, he knows that all this

<p>is true; and, before now, when he and I have been

<p>sitting over the fire, at night, he has told me about

<p>one Gineral Braddock, I think they called him, that

<p>got his men shot all to pieces, and himself too, just

<p>because he would not believe that there was any other

<p>way to fight but just his way. Now, you see, sir, the

<p>reason why he was taken at an onplush was, that he

<p>was fighting agin Indians. Well, suppose we fight

<p>Indian-fashion; will not that be pretty much the same

<p>thing? May be we an't exactly up to that, but we

<p>"Do you mind that night," continued Schwartz,

<p>laughing, "when the Lieutenant and his men came
</p>
<p>there to your uncle's to take him and the Captain?
</p>
<p>That was Indian play for you. Egad I if I had not
</p>
<p>heard that the Colonel was there, I should have
</p>
<p>knowed he was at the fixing of that business. You

<p>see, sir, that is what a man learns by living in places

<p>where a body is never safe; and the upshot of it is,

<p>that after a while he gets so that he never can be in

<p>any danger. It's like learning to sleep with one eye

<p>arrival of his guest, to make such arrangements as

<p>should prevent the stranger from suspecting that this

<p>was not the camp he was desirous to see. He had no

<p>had determined to give him the meeting at the piquet,

<p>came accompanied by Witt and another of his party;
</p>
<p>304
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and, in appearance and manners, fully answered the
</p>
<p>description of him given by Schwartz. He was a tall,
</p>
<p>red-haired man, vain, pert, and full of self-complacency.
</p>
<p>Indeed, so much did he display of a satisfaction, at
</p>
<p>once chuckling and childish, that Douglas, even
</p>
<p>though unwarned, must have suspected treachery.
</p>
<p>Besides, he never could have believed a being, manifestly so frivolous and foolish, capable of the high purpose. of devoting himself to a life of toil, hardship, and
</p>
<p>danger. The vain and self-indulgent may receive
</p>
<p>momentary impulses, under the influence of which
</p>
<p>brilliant achievements may be suddenly accomplished;
</p>
<p>but from such the tasks of study, virtue, and enduring
</p>
<p>courage, must never be expected.
</p>
<p>He seemed, at first, more intent upon his breakfast
</p>
<p>than anything else, and when it appeared, made faces
</p>
<p>at his coarse fare which ill accorded with his professed
</p>
<p>indifference to all personal inconvenience. But, bad
</p>
<p>as it was, he contrived to swallow enough to show
</p>
<p>that he was not prepared to play the ascetic any more
</p>
<p>in regard to the quantity than the quality of his food"You see," said Douglas, "the life we lead. If you
</p>
<p>are not prepared to submit cheerfully to privations,
</p>
<p>compared to which what you see here is luxury, you
</p>
<p>should not join us."
</p>
<p>"Damn luxury," said the other. "What do I care
</p>
<p>about luxury? To be sure, I have been used to it all
</p>
<p>my life; coffee or tea, one, every morning for breakfast; and good light bread, and potatoes, and pies;

</p>
<p>least every day in the week, and all sorts of sass, and
</p>
<p>then pies again, and cheese, and all that. But I am
</p>
<p>ready to give it all up to serve my country, and live
</p>
<p>as hard as any body."
</p>
<p>"I am glad to hear it," said Douglas, drawing
</p>
<p>some papers from his pocket. Among these he
</p>
<p>affected to search in vain for a particular paper, and
</p>
<p>in doing so, carelessly threw on the table the letter
</p>
<p>endorsed with the name Job Dixon. He saw that it
</p>
<p>caught the other's eyes, and, expressing some dissatisfaction at his own carelessness, said: "You have a
</p>
<p>right to know, before you join us, all about our force,
</p>
<p>and I ought to show you my last return' but I have
</p>
<p>it not at hand, though I believe I know pretty well
</p>
<p>the number of my men. But stay," continued he,
</p>
<p>interrupting himself with a start, and looking at the
</p>
<p>gallant Captain with a keenness that made his very
</p>
<p>back ache, " how came you by my pass-words, sir?"
</p>
<p>"I got them from a man they call Job Dixon,"
</p>
<p>replied the trembling Captain.
</p>
<p>~" Job Dixon!" replied Douglas, immediately resuming his complacency; " then all is right."
</p>
<p>"0 yes! all is right," said the other, recovering
</p>
<p>from his alarm, but more fluttered and confused than
</p>
<p>ever. "He told me that wa'nt his name, sure enough,
</p>
<p>and he said that name was only a sort of a countersign
</p>
<p>to you."
</p>
<p>It cost Douglas some effort to suppress a smile at
</p>
<p>seeing the delicate and dangerous office of a spy

</p>
<p>necessary to it; but he commanded himself, and
</p>
<p>asked whether the other was now content to join him.
</p>
<p>"To be sure I am," said he; " and not only I, but
</p>
<p>fifty more as good fellows as ever stepped shoeleather. You see, that was what I doubted about.
</p>
<p>I thought may be as I had such a company, I had a
</p>
<p>right to set up for myself; but after I heard all about
</p>
<p>you from that man, Job Dixon, or whatever else
</p>
<p>his name is, I made up my mind to join you."
</p>
<p>" Where are your men?" asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>"They are all about home yet," said the Captain,
</p>
<p>"but I can bring them together any day, and any
</p>
<p>place you please to name. I suppose you don't
</p>
<p>mean to stay up here in the mountains all the time,
</p>
<p>and may be it might suit as well for me to fall in
</p>
<p>with you somewhere."
</p>
<p>"That is true," said Douglas, "We are not so
</p>
<p>well off here for rations, as to want any body before
</p>
<p>we have use for them. As long as we stay here we
</p>
<p>are strong enough. A regiment of men could not

<p>men in?"
</p>
<p>" In Bedford county," replied the other, repeating
</p>
<p>his lesson exactly.
</p>
<p>"That will do, then," said Douglas. "I propose
</p>
<p>to march against Mason, at Lynchburg, early in
</p>
<p>November, and on the fifth day of the month I will

</p>

</p>
<p>"I cannot say that I know exactly where that is,"
</p>
<p>said the spy.
</p>
<p>" It is little out of your way into any part of Bedford county," said Douglas; " and as I want to see
</p>
<p>some of our friends down in that quarter, I will ride
</p>
<p>there with you. I am told Mason is pretty strong,
</p>
<p>and I want to get all the force I can, and that is not
</p>
<p>so much but what I shall be glad of your help."
</p>
<p>" How many men have you?" asked the Yankee
</p>
<p>Captain.
</p>
<p>" I have but a handful here, just now; but I am
</p>
<p>sending out orders for more to join on the route, and
</p>
<p>I am in hopes to reach the river with four hundred
</p>
<p>at least. I shall stay there, at all events, till more
</p>
<p>come in; because it would be foolish to attack
</p>
<p>Mason's regiment with less than five or six hundred."
</p>
<p>"That will do," said the other; "for Mason is
</p>
<p>not more than four hundred strong."
</p>
<p>"Indeed I" replied Douglas, affecting surprise
</p>
<p>and pleasure. " Then I am pretty sure of him. I
</p>
<p>had heard as much before, but I don't trust every
</p>
<p>body. I was afraid there was a trap set for me; but
</p>
<p>now I am satisfied, and if I can leave Staunton river
</p>
<p>with six hundred men, I shall gather force enough
</p>
<p>before I get to Lynchburg to drive Mason and his
</p>
<p>regiment before me like chaff."
</p>
<p>Having said this, Douglas set about the necessary
</p>
<p>arrangements for accompanying his new acquaintance to Jones's Ford. As the distance was too

<p>great for one day, he proposed to pass the night at
</p>
<p>308
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>the house of a trusty friend, from whence the Yankee
</p>
<p>officer would have it in his power to reach a tavern,
</p>
<p>two miles beyond the river, the next day. He now
</p>
<p>despatched a note to Arthur, saying that he wished
</p>
<p>to examine the ground at the river, in company with
</p>
<p>him and Schwartz. He therefore directed them to
</p>
<p>follow at a cautious distance, so as not to be seen
</p>
<p>by the spy; to pass them in the night, and take up
</p>
<p>their quarters at a house in advance, and the next
</p>
<p>day proceed to the dwelling of Mr. Gordon (a
</p>
<p>staunch friend), near the river, and wait for him
</p>
<p>there. Meantime a horse, that stood piqueted hard
</p>
<p>by, was saddled, and Douglas set out, accompanied
</p>
<p>by the treacherous Captain and the faithful Witt.
</p>
<p>The journey was made without any occurrence
</p>
<p>worth noting. In the conversation of the stranger
</p>
<p>there was nothing to beguile Douglas from his own
</p>
<p>thoughts. The vain babble of the prating coxcomb
</p>
<p>was all wasted on the impenetrable Witt; and, after
</p>
<p>a few fruitless attempts to overcome the taciturnity
</p>
<p>of his companions, he followed their example, and
</p>
<p>the greater part of the journey was made in silence.
</p>
<p>Late on the second evening they reached the river.
</p>
<p>The spy was directed to the public-house on the
</p>
<p>other side, and Douglas and Witt returned to Mr
</p>
<p>Gordon's, where they found Arthur and Schwartz.
</p>
<p>As they were now in a land of civilization and
</p>
<p>comfort, Douglas was not sorry to obtain, once more,
</p>
<p>a good night's lodging, which his hospitable friend

</p>
<p>was delighted to afford. But this rare enjoyment did
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>309
</p>
<p>not make him forgetful of the necessity of watching
</p>
<p>the motions of his enemy. He accordingly despatched
</p>
<p>a scout to the house to which the Yankee had been
</p>
<p>directed, to make sure that he had gone on.
</p>
<p>At a late hour the man returned, and roused
</p>
<p>Douglas to inform him that the spy had indeed gone
</p>
<p>as far as he had intended, and that he had there
</p>
<p>fallen in with a party of a dozen dragoons, commanded by a subaltern, who were on a scout through
</p>
<p>the country. With this officer he had been seen to be
</p>
<p>engaged in private and earnest conversation, and
</p>
<p>orders had been issued to the men to look well to
</p>
<p>the condition of their arms, and to be in readiness
</p>
<p>to move at day-light.
</p>
<p>It at once occurred to Douglas that a new scheme
</p>
<p>had entered the head of the vain and frivolous being
</p>
<p>who had thrust himself into an affair requiring
</p>
<p>qualities so different. It was probable that he wished
</p>
<p>to avail himself of the presence of this little party to
</p>
<p>endeavor to surprise his enemy, whom he had reason
</p>
<p>to believe to be still near the Ford. The folly of risking the defeat of his favorite enterprise by joining in
</p>
<p>the attempt, and thus throwing off his mask, was not
</p>
<p>likely to occur to him. The question with Douglas
</p>
<p>was, whether by abiding the attack he should afford
</p>
<p>the bungling fool, whom he had been leading into
</p>
<p>his own trap, a chance to escape from it by his own
</p>
<p>blunder. In this apprehension, however, he did not
</p>
<p>give that worthy due credit for his discretion. He

</p>
<p>had indeed considered Douglas as his proper prey;
</p>
<p>310
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and though he had been unable to restrain his disposition to babble, he sorely repented his indiscretion,
</p>
<p>when he found the other officer disposed to anticipate him. He had accordingly earnestly dissuaded
</p>
<p>him from attempting any thing; and, not prevailing
</p>
<p>in this, had determined to go on alone, and leave
</p>
<p>the other to execute his project as he might.
</p>
<p>But though uncertain what might be the conduct
</p>
<p>of the spy, Douglas could not resist his inclination to
</p>
<p>throw. himself in the way of the expected attack. It
</p>
<p>was necessary that he should examine the ground
</p>
<p>carefully, and he had not time to wait until the scouting party should have left the neighborhood. Besides,
</p>
<p>he was anxious to inform himself precisely of the force
</p>
<p>and position of the enemy, and the name of their new
</p>
<p>commander. For this purpose he was eager to make
</p>
<p>at least one prisoner. And, after all, perhaps not the
</p>
<p>least moving consideration, was his desire to taste
</p>
<p>once more the stormy joy of battle.
</p>
<p>Upon the whole, he determined to turn the tables
</p>
<p>on his enemy, if possible; and, instead of returning to
</p>
<p>bed, prepared immediately for action. All things
</p>
<p>were soon ready. The master of the house, his two
</p>
<p>sons, and three of the neighbors, who, hearing that
</p>
<p>he was there, had called to see him, added to his own
</p>
<p>party, made a force of ten men, with which he was
</p>
<p>not afraid to abide the attack of thirteen. At the
</p>
<p>head of these he took the road, and by daylight had
</p>
<p>occupied the ground where he wished to meet the

<p>enemy.

<p>The Partisan Leader
</p>
<p>311
</p>
<p>At the point of which we speak, the road, after
</p>
<p>passing for some miles over a broad and level ridge,
</p>
<p>at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the river,
</p>
<p>dives suddenly into a steep defile between two hills.
</p>
<p>The descent is rapid, and, in less than a hundred
</p>
<p>yards, the hills come down abruptly on either hand,
</p>
<p>leaving between them barely space enough for the
</p>
<p>road, which is quite narrow. They are steep, rugged,
</p>
<p>with projecting rocks, and altogether impracticable to
</p>
<p>cavalry; and are moreover covered with a heavy
</p>
<p>growth of timber and brushwood. At the distance of
</p>
<p>about two hundred yards from the plain above, the
</p>
<p>road turns sharp to the right. It then pursues a course
</p>
<p>nearly direct, for a like distance; and then, turning
</p>
<p>short to the left, the river, ford, and the opposite
</p>
<p>landing, are at once in full view.
</p>
<p>A point a little below the first mentioned bend was
</p>
<p>selected by Douglas for his position. He posted Witt
</p>
<p>and three others on one side of the road, behind rocks
</p>
<p>and trees, while he, Arthur, and one more, disposed
</p>
<p>themselves, in like manner, on the other. Schwartz,
</p>
<p>with the rest, passed through the defile, with orders to
</p>
<p>hide themselves near the bank, and let the enemy pass
</p>
<p>without interruption. A pole had been thrown across
</p>
<p>the road, some twenty yards in front of Douglas and
</p>
<p>his party. The crossing of this, by the enemy, was to
</p>
<p>be the signal for firing. The officer was designated
</p>
<p>to be the mark of Witt. The right and left hand man
</p>
<p>of the leading file, had each his appropriate executioner appointed; then the two next, and then two

</p>
<p>more, were in like manner foredoomed, so that no shot
</p>
<p>should be thrown away. While these arrangements
</p>
<p>were making, Arthur bethought him of Schwartz's
</p>
<p>lecture on tactics, and was at once sensible of the vast
</p>
<p>superiority of untaught courage and sagacity, on occasions like this, over the sort of discipline on which the
</p>
<p>martinet is so apt to pride himself.
</p>
<p>About sunrise, the enemy appeared, consisting, as
</p>
<p>the scout had said, of a dozen men, under the command of a single officer. To the great relief of Douglas, the redoubtable Yankee Captain was not with
</p>
<p>them. As the hill was steep, they advanced in a walk,
</p>
<p>while the officer, who was in the rear, occasionally
</p>
<p>turned his horse's head to the hill, seeming to examine
</p>
<p>for some recess in which his party might draw aside,
</p>
<p>and form a sort of ambuscade. But there was no such
</p>
<p>spot. The ground was every where too steep for cavalry; and, disappointed, he put spurs to his horse, and
</p>
<p>pushed forward to resume his place at the head of the
</p>
<p>party. They were now near the fatal point; every
</p>
<p>rifle was in rest, and duly levelled at its mark, and in
</p>
<p>the moment that the leading file were crossing the
</p>
<p>pole, six saddles were emptied, and six horses ran
</p>
<p>masterless. The aim of Witt at the officer, who was
</p>
<p>much more distant, and moving rapidly, was less fatal.
</p>
<p>But his ball took effect, as was plainly shown by the
</p>
<p>sword arm, which, at the moment, fell powerless. The
</p>
<p>men went to the right-about in a moment, and a shout,

</p>
<p>313
</p>
<p>The officer, though wounded, was not quite so
</p>
<p>ready to take to his heels, and called to his men to
</p>
<p>halt. With all but one, he succeeded; but that one,
</p>
<p>wild with terror, dashed on. In the mean time,
</p>
<p>Schwartz and his little party had planted themselves
</p>
<p>in the road, near the river, and their array was the
</p>
<p>first object that met the eye of the affrighted soldier
</p>
<p>as he turned the angle of the road. But panic is as
</p>
<p>apt to hurry a man into danger as away from it, and
</p>
<p>the sight of this new enemy only urged the poor
</p>
<p>wretch to a more desperate effort to escape, by breaking by them. In vain did the men throw up their arms,
</p>
<p>and call to him to stop. He rushed on, right upon
</p>
<p>Schwartz, who stood in the middle of the road, and
</p>
<p>who, as a dernier ressort, stopped his career with a bullet. The report of his rifle, and a glimpse of Douglas's men advancing along the side of the hill to get
</p>
<p>within shot, decided the officer that it was time to look
</p>
<p>to his safety. Turning the angle of the road, he saw
</p>
<p>the fate of his fallen soldier, and the cause of it.
</p>
<p>Immediately calling on his men to follow, he dashed
</p>
<p>on with an impetuosity which showed a determination
</p>
<p>to force a passage or perish.
</p>
<p>The result was inevitable. Schwartz was in the
</p>
<p>act of loading his rifle. The other three levelled
</p>
<p>theirs. They had not been trained in Schwartz's
</p>
<p>school of tactics, and all three, attracted by the epaulette and plume and sash of the officer, fired at
</p>
<p>him. He fell dead, and the rest, perceiving their

<p>necessity, sprang aside, and let them pass. One of
</p>
<p>them was not so nimble, but that, as he clambered
</p>
<p>up the rocky face of the hill, a sweeping back-handed
</p>
<p>stroke inflicted a deep gash in the back part of his
</p>
<p>thigh. This was the only injury received by the
</p>
<p>party of Douglas in the affair, and dearly did it cost
</p>
<p>the man who gave it. Schwartz marked him, and
</p>
<p>coolly went on loading his rifle. By the time he had
</p>
<p>effected this, the soldier was half way across the
</p>
<p>river, and, the next moment, tumbled from his horse,
</p>
<p>and went floating down the stream. The other five

<p>gained the shore before another rifle could be loaded,

</p>
<p>THIs victory, though on a small scale, was complete in itself. It was a favorable omen, too, and
</p>
<p>might serve as a sort of rehearsal of the more important battle to be fought on the same ground. In
</p>
<p>one thing only Douglas had been disappointed, by
</p>
<p>the eagerness of Schwartz's men. He had made
</p>
<p>no prisoners, and the fallen enemy were all either
</p>
<p>dead, or not in condition to be harassed by such
</p>
<p>questions as he wished to ask. They were necessarily committed to the care of such of the party as
</p>
<p>lived in the neighborhood; and their horses and arms
</p>
<p>being secured, were placed in the same hands for
</p>
<p>safe keeping.
</p>
<p>The feelings of Arthur, as he looked on this fearful
</p>
<p>scene of slaughter, were such as might be expected
</p>
<p>to possess the mind of a youth, who, as yet, had
</p>

</p>
<p>it with a mind prepared for the stern duties of
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>Requesting the company and advice of his host,
</p>
<p>Douglas now proceeded to examine the ground. He
</p>
<p>found the river hills every where intersected, on
</p>
<p>both sides of the river, by ravines such as that I
</p>
<p>have described. The ford was shallow, but just
</p>
<p>above was deep water, which, on the north side,
</p>
<p>came down quite near to the gravel bar, which served
</p>
<p>as a dam. Here a steep and high rock bounded the
</p>
<p>river, and along the base of it, the water eddied in a
</p>
<p>deep pool, and then swept away in a strong but
</p>
<p>shallow current. At a short distance below was
</p>
<p>the mouth of a ravine, overgrown with lofty trees,
</p>
<p>and clustering with brushwood, at a distance of fifty
</p>
<p>yards from the landing place. The road, issuing
</p>
<p>from the river at the foot of the rock, holds a straight
</p>
<p>course for twenty yards, or thereabouts, and then
</p>
<p>turning short to the left, is no more in sight of the
</p>
<p>river. From thence a short but steep ascent through
</p>
<p>a deep cleft in the hills, brings the traveller to the
</p>
<p>top, where he turns again to the right, and resumes
</p>
<p>the direction towards Lynchburg. After a thorough
</p>
<p>examination of the whole, the party returned to
</p>
<p>breakfast at the house of Mr. Gordon.
</p>
<p>Douglas rode slowly and thoughtfully. At length
</p>
<p>he said apart to Schwartz:
</p>
<p>"Your plot is admirable; but I am afraid it will
</p>
<p>fail."

</p>
<p>"What chance of that?" asked Schwartz. "They
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>317
</p>
<p>will be ashamed to bring more than a thousand men
</p>
<p>against you, even if they had them. We can raise
</p>
<p>as many as they can, and we shall be on the ground,
</p>
<p>and have the same advantage we had just now."
</p>
<p>" But suppose they come and take possession
</p>
<p>first," said Douglas.
</p>
<p>"Oh! no danger of that. They'll be in no hurry
</p>
<p>to leave their snug quarters any sooner than they
</p>
<p>can help; and we can be here a day or two before
</p>
<p>the time."
</p>
<p>"It may be so," said Douglas; "but I don't
</p>
<p>think Col. Mason takes me for an absolute fool; and
</p>
<p>if he does, he has reason to know that I have sharpwitted men about me. But any man's wits may fail
</p>
<p>him sometimes. For example, it has never occurred
</p>
<p>to either of us, that Mason will certainly not believe
</p>
<p>that we have been fooled by such a fellow as this
</p>
<p>Yankee of yours. Will he not, therefore, at once
</p>
<p>suspect the truth, and conclude that we are trying
</p>
<p>to catch him in his own trap?"
</p>
<p>"Egad!" said Schwartz, "that is true. I had
</p>
<p>not thought of that. The fellow is too silly to be
</p>
<p>made bait of, sure enough. But then, you see,
</p>
<p>Captain, we can fix them any how. Mr. Gordon
</p>
<p>here can raise men enough, in three days, to keep
</p>
<p>them from crossing the river, until we are ready for
</p>
<p>them; and then you know, we can push across a
</p>
<p>part of our men, and toll them over. If once we
</p>
<p>get them into a right sharp fight, they'll follow us

<p>" I have no doubt of their coming to look for us,'
</p>
<p>said Douglas; "and no doubt of a fight; but we
</p>
<p>must be prepared to meet more menthan we have
</p>
<p>bargained for. Depend upon it, they will bring
</p>
<p>every man they can raise. Why, would you believe

<p>codfish, and potatoes, and cider, and pies, and all
</p>
<p>sort8 of sass? Such a simpleton could not impose
</p>
<p>on a child. Col. Mason has talents worthy of a
</p>
<p>better cause, and he will see through the whole affair.
</p>
<p>I suppose he is superseded; but he is an honorable
</p>
<p>man, and will frankly give the benefit of his suspicions to his superior, who can hardly be such a fool
</p>
<p>as to disregard his suggestions. We must bestir
</p>
<p>ourselves, therefore, or give up the game and escape
</p>
<p>from our own plot.
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," continued Douglas, speaking aloud,
</p>
<p>and in a sustained and decisive tone, " this is our
</p>
<p>place of rendezvous; the time mid-day on the third
</p>
<p>of November. Every man-must come prepared for

<p>action, and such as mean to accompany me to the
</p>
<p>lower country, must bring with them all their necessaries. Mr. Gordon, I must depend on you to hold
</p>
<p>this pass, and keep the enemy from crossing the
</p>
<p>river. I shall send a force to support you, if necessary. You, Schwartz, know what to do better than
</p>
<p>I can tell you. You, Witt, will return with me, and

<p>we will talk as we ride, of what is to be done. Mr.

<p>and then we part until the day of rendezvous. Until
</p>
<p>that time,' Vigilance and Activity' is the word; but
</p>
<p>then,' FREEDOM, INDEPENDENCE, and GLORY.' "
</p>
<p>As Douglas said this they arrived at Mr. Gordon's
</p>
<p>door. The ready meal was hastily swallowed, the
</p>
<p>horses fed, and they departed for the camp. On the
</p>
<p>way Schwartz, turning to the left, kept a southward
</p>
<p>course through the district, along the foot of the
</p>
<p>mountains, to rouse the inhabitants in that quarter,
</p>
<p>and to collect a party to support Mr. Gordon. The
</p>
<p>rest returned to the camp, from whence runners
</p>
<p>were despatched throughout all the adjacent country, and even beyond the mountain to the headwaters of the Holston. Leaving them thus emaployed, let us repair to the head-quarters of the
</p>
<p>enemyIn the handsome parlor of a handsome house, in
</p>
<p>the suburbs of Lynchburg, we find two officers
</p>
<p>seated at a game of piquet. The hour is nine at
</p>
<p>night. The room is richly furnished. A bright fire
</p>
<p>burns on the hearth, and the blaze of sconce and
</p>
<p>astral lamps sheds its soft, luxurious, moonlight
</p>
<p>beams into every corner. Wine, cordials, fruits,
</p>
<p>and cigars, are placed on a table, and every thing
</p>
<p>betokens comfort and luxury, ease and indolence.
</p>
<p>The dress of these officers corresponds with the
</p>
<p>scene. Both glitter with gold and flutter in lace,
</p>
<p>and their richly mounted swords and highly finished
</p>
<p>pistols, which lie on the table, show that the owners
</p>
<p>abound in the means of display and self-indulgence.

</p>
<p>Such was indeed the fact. The pay of the army,
</p>
<p>gradually increased by law during thirty years, had
</p>
<p>grown to a noble revenue. The emoluments, as they
</p>
<p>are called, under a system of fraud and connivance,
</p>
<p>had advanced (without law) yet more rapidly; so
</p>
<p>that to be a Colonel in the army of the United States
</p>
<p>was to be a rich man. Such was the rank of both
</p>
<p>these officers. It was true that the treasury had
</p>
<p>already begun to feel the drain of the vast sums
</p>
<p>accumulated under an iniquitous tariff, and now
</p>
<p>employed to fortify the tyranny that had enforced
</p>
<p>that pernicious system. The loss of the southern
</p>
<p>trade gave reason to fear that the supply now on
</p>
<p>hand, if once exhausted, would not be speedily
</p>
<p>renewed. But the rulers felt but the more sensibly
</p>
<p>that the energetic employment both of force and
</p>
<p>corruption was necessary to retain the little that
</p>
<p>remained, by holding Virginia in subjection. With
</p>
<p>this view, the same system of wasteful expenditure,
</p>
<p>commenced twenty years before, was kept up; and
</p>
<p>all who served the crown with becoming zeal were
</p>
<p>encouraged to hold open their mouths that they
</p>
<p>might be filled.
</p>
<p>In another part of the room a company of subalterns fluttered around a bevy of fair damsels. To
</p>
<p>these young ladies the mistress of this mansion had

<p>321
</p>
<p>her husband had invited the commandant of the post
</p>
<p>to make it his head-quarters. Many a wistful glance
</p>
<p>had been cast during the evening, from the assiduous
</p>
<p>subalterns, toward the handsome and unheeding
</p>
<p>wearer of two epaulettes, to whose authority all who
</p>
<p>approached him were bound to bow. But it was all
</p>
<p>in vain. Sufficient to himself, he valued- not the
</p>
<p>admiring eyes which were bent upon him; or if they
</p>
<p>occupied any thing of his attention, it was to be
</p>
<p>made the subject of invidious comparison with the
</p>
<p>ladies of the highest fashion in the northern cities,
</p>
<p>whose lavish attentions had rendered him totally
</p>
<p>heedless of the vulgar admiration of a parcel of halt:
</p>
<p>bred Virginia girls.
</p>
<p>These remarks, however, apply to only one of the
</p>
<p>officers in question. The other manifested no such
</p>
<p>insensibility, though his attentions to the fair were
</p>
<p>only marked by a staid courtesy, hardly more flattering than the perfect indifference of his companion.
</p>
<p>Still he paid such attention as it becomes a gentleman to pay to every thing that wears the exterior of
</p>
<p>a lady. But the day when he was himself an object
</p>
<p>of court to them was past. Indeed, the ladies had
</p>
<p>already begun to despair of thawing the coldness of
</p>
<p>his temperament, when being superseded by a
</p>
<p>younger and handsomer commander, he was laid on

<p>the shelf and condemned as quite passe.

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader
</p>
<p>The reader, without doubt, already understands
</p>
<p>that, of the two officers before us, the elder in years,
</p>
<p>though the younger in commission, is Col. Mason,
</p>
<p>late commandant of the post. His companion is
</p>
<p>Col. Owen Trevor, whose impatience for distinction
</p>
<p>has been indulged by sending him to Lynchburg
</p>
<p>with his regiment. Here, taking rank of Mason, he
</p>
<p>has been in fact placed in command of a brigade,
</p>
<p>with an understanding that time and opportunity
</p>
<p>will be afforded him to show himself qualified for the
</p>
<p>rank, by discharging the functions of a brigadier.
</p>
<p>This post has been assigned him because in this
</p>
<p>direction is the only enemy actually in arms.
</p>
<p>Although the force under the command of Douglas
</p>
<p>had been originally but a handful, Mason had seen
</p>
<p>that it possessed, in a marvellous degree, the faculty
</p>
<p>of occasional expansion. His intelligence had taught
</p>
<p>him to expect that it would ere long be greatly
</p>
<p>increased, if not crushed by a vigorous movement
</p>
<p>on his part. Hence he was desirous of acting on the
</p>
<p>offensive, especially as he had no doubt, from the
</p>
<p>past, that Lynchburg was the object of Douglas. But
</p>
<p>he had seen enough of the character and resources
</p>
<p>of his enemy to know that a small force would be
</p>
<p>unavailing, and had therefore earnestly desired to
</p>
<p>be reinforced. In answer to this request he had
</p>
<p>received, not the moderate aid that he had desired,
</p>
<p>but an order to surrender his command to Col.

<p>Trevor, whose well-appointed regiment was ordered

<p>to the post.

</p>
<p>323
</p>
<p>Col. Mason was a man of honor and talent. He
</p>
<p>was one of the many subjects of that strong delusion
</p>
<p>which had so extensively prevailed; and, under the
</p>
<p>influence of which, Virginia, for thirty years, had
</p>
<p>been sacrificing the substance of liberty and prosperity to the forms of a constitution devised to
</p>
<p>secure, but perverted to destroy them. He belonged,
</p>
<p>moreover, to that unfortunate class of partisans whom
</p>
<p>it is safe to neglect. Acting on principles, however
</p>
<p>erroneous, it was clearly seen that these alone were
</p>
<p>sufficient to bind himr to the service to which he had
</p>
<p>devoted himself. It was at the same time little
</p>
<p>doubted that a change of opinions would be followed
</p>
<p>by a renunciation of all the advantages of his situation, whatever they might be. To waste on such a
</p>
<p>man the means of corrupting the corruptible, and
</p>
<p>securing the faithless, would indeed have been
</p>
<p>" ridiculous excess." He had won his way to his
</p>
<p>present rank by the strict performance of every duty
</p>
<p>of the subordinate offices, through which he had
</p>
<p>risen by regular gradation. In the shuffling and
</p>
<p>cutting of the military pack, he had seen junior
</p>
<p>officers placed above him by that sort of legerdemain which had so long before procured his master
</p>
<p>the name of the magician. He had not indeed
</p>
<p>acquiesced tamely in this, but means had been
</p>
<p>always found to soothe him, and he had been
</p>
<p>retained in the service by dexterous appeals to that
</p>
<p>magnanimity which they who knew not how to

</p>
<p>But he had not yet forgotten how, ten years
</p>
<p>before, some pretext had been found for reversing
</p>
<p>the relative rank of himself and Col. Trevor, when
</p>
<p>both were very young and both subalterns. But on
</p>
<p>that occasion, as usual, some complimentary though
</p>
<p>temporary arrangement had been devised to reconcile him to that which gave the rank of Captain to
</p>
<p>one, whom he, still a Lieutenant, had once commanded. Having repressed his dissatisfaction at
</p>
<p>that time, he now felt bound to acquiesce in the
</p>
<p>circumstances which placed his former subordinate
</p>
<p>immediately in authority over him. If this occurrence made him repent his former tameness, now
</p>
<p>when it was too late to remonstrate, he did not say

<p>so, but addressed himself with grave precision to

<p>CHAPTER XXXVI.
</p>
<p>Fortuna nimium quem fovet, stultum facit.
</p>
<p>COLONEL TREVOR was the spoiled child of fortune
</p>
<p>and patronage. He was old enough to remember his
</p>
<p>father's rise in life. Hence, in estimating his consequence in society, he had formed a habit of comparing
</p>
<p>him with the class from which he sprung, and not
</p>
<p>with that more intellectual order of men, in which he
</p>
<p>had at last found his proper place, and where he had
</p>
<p>long remained stationary in well ascertained equality.
</p>
<p>This circumstance alone made an important difference
</p>
<p>between him and his younger brothers. The sort of
</p>
<p>retrospect with which he was most familiar teaches
</p>
<p>any thing but humility, however it may impress that
</p>
<p>lesson on the mind that has already learned it.
</p>
<p>In the commencement of Col. Trevor's military
</p>
<p>career, the approbation of his father had been of
</p>
<p>more consequence to the usurper than now, when his
</p>
<p>throne stood strong on its own foundations. The
</p>
<p>character of that worthy gentleman, too, had been
</p>
<p>less understood. The President had not been aware
</p>
<p>how absolutely the convictions of his own mind and
</p>
<p>his high sense of duty supplied the place of those

</p>
<p>pectation of which is necessary to bind the faith of
</p>
<p>the unprincipled. Before this discovery was made,
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor had been already advanced to a rank,
</p>
<p>and invested with an adventitious consequence,
</p>
<p>which made it important to cultivate him on his own
</p>
<p>account. His early training had taught him the
</p>
<p>grand maxim of the court: "Nothing ask, nothing
</p>
<p>have." He had discovered that any display of fixed
</p>
<p>principle, however favorable to the usurper's plans,
</p>
<p>was no passport to advancement; that rewards were
</p>
<p>only for the mercenary, and that they were always
</p>
<p>dispensed with a freedom duly proportioned to the
</p>
<p>eagerness with which they were sought. The caustic
</p>
<p>wit of John Randolph had unintentionally and almost
</p>
<p>with his last breath supplied the faction with a countersign not to be mistaken. If any man talked about
</p>
<p>his principles (as all men do and must at times),
</p>
<p>there was always at hand some dexterous pimp, whose
</p>
<p>business it was to ascertain their number. If they
</p>
<p>were found to be either more or less than seven, the
</p>
<p>discovery was fatal to his hopes of advancement.
</p>
<p>The character of Douglas Trevor had been formed
</p>
<p>under circumstances directly the reverse of those
</p>
<p>which had operated on his elder brother. He only
</p>
<p>remembered his father in the same circles and the
</p>
<p>same place in society in which his latter days had been
</p>
<p>spent. No change of condition had led;he youth to
</p>
<p>turn his back on the companions of his boyhood; no
</p>
<p>rapid promotion had filled him with a fond conceit

<p>327
</p>
<p>for rank and emolument; and his unbought fidelity
</p>
<p>had shown that he was of the number of those on
</p>
<p>whom rewards would be wasted. Thus it happened
</p>
<p>(as it often does), that two young men, sons of the
</p>
<p>same parents, educated in the same school, and trained
</p>
<p>to the same profession, were just the reverse of each
</p>
<p>other, in particulars wherein nature had probably
</p>
<p>made little difference between them. So it was, that
</p>
<p>while the one was indifferent to duty, frivolous, selfindulgent, and mercenary, the other was assiduous,
</p>
<p>dicfreet, temperate, and disinterested.
</p>
<p>It may be inferred from what I have said, that the
</p>
<p>rank of Col. Trevor was already above his merit.
</p>
<p>The consequence was, that having reached his present
</p>
<p>elevation by the force of causes not within himself,
</p>
<p>his own consciousness afforded no standard for his
</p>
<p>farther pretensions. He could see no reason why he
</p>
<p>should not be a field-marshal as well as a colonel.
</p>
<p>And so it was; for he had no just claims to either
</p>
<p>rank on the score of service or qualification. A stone
</p>
<p>thrown up, were it endued with consciousness and
</p>
<p>thought, could see no reason, as long as it was ascending, why it might not fly to the moon. If my expe.
</p>
<p>rience in life has taught me anything, it is, that a man

<p>were busily engaged in their game, when the Orderly

<p>328
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>in waiting entered and announced an officer who
</p>
<p>wished to report himself to the commandant of the
</p>
<p>post.
</p>
<p>"Let him call in the morning, and be damned to
</p>
<p>him," said Col. Trevor. "' Is this an hour to disturb
</p>
<p>a gentleman?"
</p>
<p>The Orderly saluted and withdrew, but presently
</p>
<p>returned to say that the officer had particular busi
</p>
<p>ness with Colonel Mason, and wished to see him
</p>
<p>immediately. Mason accordingly left the room, and
</p>
<p>was gone but a few minutes, when he too came back.
</p>
<p>" This officer, sir," said he, "asked to see me, supposing me still in command here. His intelligence is
</p>
<p>for you; and, from what I heard before I discovered
</p>
<p>his mistake, it may be important that you should
</p>
<p>receive it to-night."
</p>
<p>"Well," said Trevor, in a tone at once lazy and
</p>
<p>peevish, "I suppose I must see him. But it is
</p>
<p>damned hard that I cannot have a moment's leisure.
</p>
<p>Let him come in."
</p>
<p>He was summoned accordingly, and proved to be
</p>
<p>no other than our acquaintance, the Yankee spy,
</p>
<p>whom I now introduce to the reader, as he announced
</p>
<p>himself. He is Captain Amos Cottle, of the 20th regiment of infantry, in the army of the United States.
</p>
<p>His name, I presume (like that of the fourteen James
</p>
<p>Thomsons, in Don Juan), had been bestowed in
</p>
<p>honor of the illustrious bard immortalized by Lord
</p>
<p>Byron. He was invited to take a glass of wine, and,

</p>
<p>having seated himself, requested a private conference
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>3C29
</p>
<p>with the commanding officer. This was a signal for
</p>
<p>the dispersion of the ladies, and their assiduous
</p>
<p>attendants, who adjourned to another room. Mason
</p>
<p>was about to follow, but the Colonel carelessly requested him to remain.
</p>
<p>Captain Cottle was then invited to open his budget,
</p>
<p>which he did by telling what the reader already
</p>
<p>knows. Not a sentence did he utter, in which some
</p>
<p>indication of folly, vanity, or indiscretion did not
</p>
<p>escape him. All this, however, passed unremarked
</p>
<p>of Col. Trevor, whose eyes sparkled at the welcome
</p>
<p>intelligence. Nothing could be more apropos to his
</p>
<p>wishes, or to the plan of the President. " Veni, vidi,
</p>
<p>vici." The exploit of Caesar was the only parallel to
</p>
<p>that which he proposed to achieve. Occasionally he
</p>
<p>looked to Mason for sympathy and concurrence with
</p>
<p>his unexpressed thoughts. As often he withdrew his
</p>
<p>eye, chilled and perplexed by the cold, steady,
</p>
<p>thoughtful look of his companion. What could this
</p>
<p>mean? Could Mason be insensible to the advantage
</p>
<p>of the plot, or indifferent to its issue? Could envy
</p>
<p>so far prevail with a man heretofore distinguished by
</p>
<p>his disinterested zeal for the service, as to damp his
</p>
<p>ardor in an enterprise of so much promise? He was
</p>
<p>at first indignant at this idea, but a little reflection
</p>
<p>made him judge his brother-officer with more candor.
</p>
<p>"Poor Mason," said he to himself. "I don't wonder that he is a little mortified at my good fortune.
</p>
<p>It is something hard that he should have held this

<p>post so long, without a chance to do anything, and

</p>
<p>that I should have come just in time to rob him of
</p>
<p>this. But then, damn it it is his own fault. What
</p>
<p>did he want with a reinforcement against a parcel of
</p>
<p>ragged militia? It was right to supersede an officer
</p>
<p>who would ask more than one regiment to meet any
</p>
<p>number of such ragamuffins that could come against
</p>
<p>him. Besides, he ought to have broken up their den
</p>
<p>long ago. If Douglas escapes me this time, it shall
</p>
<p>not be long before I smoke him out of his hole, or
</p>
<p>there is no virtue in gunpowder."
</p>
<p>Having thus reasoned himself into a state of exquisite self-complacency, he heard the story of Captain
</p>
<p>Cottle to the end, and then asked the opinion of
</p>
<p>Mason.
</p>
<p>"I cannot say," replied that gentleman, "that I
</p>
<p>am prepared to give an opinion."
</p>
<p>"I hope," said Trevor, "that you don't mean to
</p>
<p>deny me the benefit of your thoughts."
</p>
<p>" So far from it, that I make it a point of conscience
</p>
<p>not to speak without having first thought. When I
</p>
<p>have done so, I will tell you what I think. To speak
</p>
<p>now would be but to give you the crude suggestions
</p>
<p>of unreflecting and impertinent presumption."
</p>
<p>"I cannot understand," said Trevor, "how you
</p>
<p>can require time to think in so plain a case."
</p>
<p>" I might say, in reply," answered Mason, "that
</p>
<p>as the case is so clear to you, you can hardly need my
</p>
<p>advice. Indeed, I understand your request of it, but
</p>
<p>as a compliment to which I am not insensible, and

<p>which I shall not decline. When I am prepared to
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>331
</p>
<p>speak, therefore, I shall speak as plain as if the case
</p>
<p>were as full of difficulty to you as it is to me."
</p>
<p>Having said this, Mason drew Cottle into conversation; inquired the particulars of his visit to the
</p>
<p>mountain; encouraged him to recite his conversations
</p>
<p>with Douglas; and, filling him full of vanity and conceit by his deferential deportment, made the light
</p>
<p>shine through him, so as to expose his folly to the
</p>
<p>most careless observer. At length he was dismissed
</p>
<p>for the night, and Mason, addressing Trevor, said:
</p>
<p>" I am now ready to give you my thoughts. I could
</p>
<p>not do so in Captain Cottle's presence; and, indeed,
</p>
<p>my mind was not clear until I had some more conversation with him. I am now satisfied."
</p>
<p>" Let's hear, then, the result of your cogitations,"
</p>
<p>asked Trevor, with something of a sneer.
</p>
<p>Mason colored slightly, but said, in a calm tone:
</p>
<p>" I have had some experience of this Captain Douglas,
</p>
<p>and am morally sure he has not been deceived by this
</p>
<p>man, as he supposes."
</p>
<p>"What! " exclaimed Trevor. "Do you forget that
</p>
<p>Captain Cottle is an officer whose rank is a pledge for
</p>
<p>his honor, and who would forfeit his commission and
</p>
<p>his life by bringing false intelligence to his commander? "
</p>
<p>"I don't doubt his truth," said Mason, " but his sagacity I do doubt. The man is palpably a Yankee -"
</p>
<p>" And the cunning of the Yankee is proverbial,"
</p>
<p>interrupted Trevor.

</p>
<p>" It is, indeed," replied Mason; "but as he is not
</p>
<p>332
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>only a Yankee, but obviously so, he could not
</p>
<p>have made Douglas believe that he was an influ
</p>
<p>ential inhabitant of Bedford, a native of the county,
</p>
<p>and a zealous stickler for the sovereignty of Virginia."
</p>
<p>"You give your Captain Douglas credit for a great
</p>
<p>deal of sagacity."
</p>
<p>"And not without reason," said Mason. " His
</p>
<p>plans, and his manner of conducting them, all show
</p>
<p>it. His intelligence appears to be always correct and
</p>
<p>ready, and his devices for the concealment of his own
</p>
<p>schemes are commonly impenetrable. It is clear,
</p>
<p>from many circumstances, that he has agents who pass
</p>
<p>through the country unsuspected; and I should not
</p>
<p>be surprised if Cottle had fallen in with one of them.
</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Douglas will be found at Jones's
</p>
<p>Ford on the day appointed; but my life upon it,
</p>
<p>instead of coming there to be surprised, he proposes
</p>
<p>to come there to surprise you."
</p>
<p>" Surprise ME! " said Trevor, scornfully.
</p>
<p>"I have no apprehension that he will surprise
</p>
<p>you," said Mason, "because I am sure you will take
</p>
<p>all proper precaution. I merely mean to say that he
</p>
<p>will attempt it."
</p>
<p>" And be punished for his presumption," said
</p>
<p>Trevor. " As to precaution, I must use it, to be
</p>
<p>sure, superfluous as it may be against a set of inex.
</p>
<p>perienced militia."
</p>
<p>" Of one sort of experience," said Mason, "and

<p>we. They have tasted danger more than once; and
</p>
<p>their skill in the use of the rifle is such as men who
</p>
<p>live with the weapon in their hands, and they alone,
</p>
<p>can be expected to acquire."
</p>
<p>" I hope to bring in some of them as prisoners,"
</p>
<p>said Trevor, " and then we shall see how that is. I
</p>
<p>will pit a dozen of our sharp-shooters against a dozen
</p>
<p>of them, my horse to yours."
</p>
<p>" I am not in the habit of betting," replied Mason,
</p>
<p>smiling quietly; " but, in this case, I dare say I may
</p>
<p>do it innocently, as the offence will hardly reach
</p>
<p>beyond intention; so I take your bet."
</p>
<p>"How do you mean?" asked Trevor, sharply.
</p>
<p>" I mean," said Mason, "that I am not very sure
</p>
<p>that you will take a dozen of them."
</p>
<p>" Not sure! " exclaimed Trevor; " how can they
</p>
<p>escape me? "
</p>
<p>" I don't profess to understand their craft," said
</p>
<p>Mason; "but they are hard to catch. In short,
</p>
<p>Colonel Trevor, my instructions require me to afford
</p>
<p>you all the information I have acquired here. It is
</p>
<p>therefore my duty, even without question from you,
</p>
<p>to assure you that you are in the midst of a disaffected

<p>country, and that you are going against an enemy not
</p>
<p>to be despised, and among a people universally hostile. Knowing these things, and invited by you; to

<p>far at leastas to underst and the ground, and to occupy
</p>
<p>it before the day."
</p>
<p>"And so he takes warning, and escapes me."
</p>
<p>" By no means. Cottle's scheme will have been
</p>
<p>made available so far as to draw him down from the
</p>
<p>mountains. You neither need nor desire any other
</p>
<p>advantage. But I see that I cannot easily make
</p>
<p>myself understood, because our minds are occupied
</p>
<p>with different things. You are thinking about the
</p>
<p>trap set for Douglas, and I am thinking about the
</p>
<p>snare he has laid for you. Depend upon it, Colonel
</p>
<p>Trevor, that the old story of catching a Tartar, may
</p>
<p>be illustrated by catching Douglas among the river
</p>
<p>hills. He may be caught; and yet, neither come
</p>
<p>away, nor let you come. Observe," continued Mason, " when I inquired of this Captain Cottle about
</p>
<p>the nature of the ground at the Ford, behold, he had
</p>
<p>not taken notice of it! but, on cross-examination, by
</p>
<p>finding what he did not see, I am satisfied that there
</p>
<p>is no low ground, nor cleared land at the place; that
</p>
<p>the hills come sheer down to the river, and, by almost
</p>
<p>necessary consequence, that the road leads through a
</p>
<p>deep defile. The choice of such a place confirms my
</p>
<p>suspicion of Douglas's plan, and affords the means to
</p>
<p>counterwork it. If we occupy the strong points of
</p>
<p>the ground, and he comes with only such a body of
</p>
<p>men as Cottle expects, we take him without effusion
</p>
<p>of blood. If he comes in force, our position will give
</p>
<p>uw all the advantage he seeks; and, trust me, in that

<p>case we shall have need of them."
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>335
</p>
<p>" Need of advantages against irregulars!" drawled
</p>
<p>Trevor, sneeringly, and emphasizing every word.
</p>
<p>"Our discipline and experience are of little conse
</p>
<p>quence," said Mason, " if we do not use them. One
</p>
<p>use of them is to know how to take advantages."
</p>
<p>"Be it so," said Trevor; " I shall seek none. A
</p>
<p>fair field and a clear sky are all I ask; and I shall be
</p>
<p>careful to take no measures which may alarm this
</p>
<p>mountain wolf, and drive him back to his den before
</p>
<p>I can come up with him."
</p>
<p>These words were hardly spoken when the Orderly
</p>
<p>announced that a sergeant of dragoons had just
</p>
<p>returned from a scouting party with important intelligence, and had come' to make his report to the Colonel. What this was the reader will infer, when told
</p>
<p>that he was the non-commissioned officer on whom
</p>
<p>had devolved the command of the four men who had
</p>
<p>escaped with him from Jones's Ford. His information confirmed Mason's suspicions, and might have
</p>
<p>served as a damper to the flattering anticipations of a
</p>
<p>man less sanguine than Colonel Trevor. Its only
</p>
<p>effect on him was to sharpen his eagerness for the
</p>
<p>expected rencontre. Yet the Sergeant, when questioned, frankly admitted that his party had not been
</p>
<p>out-numbered. But it was clear that their design
</p>
<p>had been, by some means, disclosed to Douglas; and
</p>
<p>his advantage had been the result of judicious dispositions, and the skill of his men in the use of that
</p>
<p>most terrible of all weapons.
</p>
<p>But all this abated nothing of Colonel Trevor's

<p>More dreadful far their ire
</p>
<p>Than theirs, who, scorning danger's name,

<p>In eager mood to battle came;

<p>Their valor, like light straw on flame,

<p>A fierce, but fading fire I
</p>
<p>FREED at length from his troublesome adviser, Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor was left to the uninterrupted enjoyment of
</p>
<p>his anticipated triumph. He seemed to tread on
</p>
<p>air, and, with a flashing eye, and spread nostrils, to
</p>
<p>look forward to the glories, and snuff up the carnage
</p>
<p>of the expected fight. Such was his impatience for
</p>
<p>the adventure, that, in the eagerness of anticipation,
</p>
<p>he gave no thought to the necessary preparations.
</p>
<p>It was enough to issue the customary order for the
</p>
<p>troops to be in readiness for the march, with a supply of cartridges and rations suitable to the expedition.
</p>
<p>The third day of November at length arrived, and
</p>
<p>the troops took up the line of march. As they issued
</p>
<p>in glittering rank from the barracks above the town,
</p>
<p>the Colonel, proudly mounted on his stately charger,
</p>
<p>posted himself in the gateway of the house, where

<p>he had taken up his quarters, and received their
</p>
<p>passing salute. The portico of the house was crowded

<p>with female figures; the windows were clustered

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>with fair faces; the noble oak-trees in the yard were
</p>
<p>hung with garlands, in token of the loyalty of the
</p>
<p>household, and of an anticipated triumph in his
</p>
<p>assured victory. But the Colonel saw nothing of
</p>
<p>this. His eye saw not the waving of handkerchiefs,
</p>
<p>his ear heard not the cheering farewells issuing in
</p>
<p>tones of music from rosy lips. He heard only the
</p>
<p>spirit-stirring drum and clanging bugle; he saw
</p>
<p>nothing but the stately steppings of his well-trained
</p>
<p>troops as they marched by; and then, his eye, following them, dwelt with delight upon their picturesque appearance as they wound along the slope of
</p>
<p>the hill, and crossed Blackwater-bridge. Beyond
</p>
<p>this, imagination presented objects of yet greater
</p>
<p>interest,-the battle-field, the tumult of the strife,
</p>
<p>the rout, the pursuit, the carnage, the vanquished
</p>
<p>leader led in chains to the foot of the throne, the
</p>
<p>gracious smile of approving majesty, and the rich
</p>
<p>rewards of successful valor. These things he saw;
</p>
<p>but saw not the gaunt figure of his host, who stood
</p>
<p>near, his strong features and manly person ill sorting with the abject part he condemned himself to
</p>
<p>act. He sought in vain to catch the eye of the
</p>
<p>excited commander, desirous, in his parting words,
</p>
<p>to convey some expression of loyalty aad zeal.
</p>
<p>Colonel Trevor marked him not; and, as the rear
</p>
<p>of the column was about to pass, put spurs to his
</p>
<p>horse, and galloped to the front.

</p>
<p>At this point of my story, I must crave the indulgence of the reader, while I introduce my humble
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>339
</p>
<p>self to his notice. A native of South Carolina, and
</p>
<p>the heir of a goodly inheritance, which, during a
</p>
<p>long minority, had been at nurse in the hands of an
</p>
<p>honest and prudent guardian, I was just of age, the
</p>
<p>master of a handsome income, and of a large sum of
</p>
<p>money in hand. Having a taste for military life, my
</p>
<p>guardian had procured me a situation in the military
</p>
<p>academy, which had been established by the State,
</p>
<p>as a counterpoise to that institution at which the
</p>
<p>Federal Government had taught so many of our
</p>
<p>southern youths to whet their swords against the
</p>
<p>only sovereignty to which they owed allegiance.
</p>
<p>My proficiency had been seen, and gave entire satisfaction to my teachers. I had imbibed political
</p>
<p>opinions which made me a zealous advocate for the
</p>
<p>rights of the States, and a strenuous asserter of the
</p>
<p>unalienable independence of South Carolina. When,
</p>
<p>in compliance with the request of Mr. B, inquiry
</p>
<p>had been made for a young man qualified and disposed to aid young Trevor in his enterprise, I had
</p>
<p>been selected for that purpose. I was invited to
</p>
<p>Columbia; made acquainted with the plans of the
</p>
<p>insurgents in Virginia, and provided with letters to
</p>
<p>my future commander. Journeying to Virginia by
</p>
<p>the route that he had pursued, on the evening of the
</p>
<p>first day of November I entered the valley described
</p>
<p>in the first chapter. I soon encountered a crowd of
</p>
<p>men who filled the road and the yard of a house
</p>

</p>
<p>seemed all earnestly engaged in some important
</p>
<p>preparation.
</p>
<p>I was presently stopped, courteously though peremptorily; and having expressed a wish to see Captain Douglas, was conducted to the house. There,
</p>
<p>pen in hand, and busily engaged in writing, sat a
</p>
<p>young man of small stature and slight figure. Though
</p>
<p>quite handsome, there was nothing remarkable in
</p>
<p>his features; but a bright gray eye, of calm, thoughtful, and searching expression, strongly contrasted
</p>
<p>with the dark brown curling hair that clustered over
</p>
<p>his brow.
</p>
<p>Being accosted by my conductor, he raised his
</p>
<p>head; when I stepped forward, and handed him my
</p>
<p>letters. He glanced hastily to the signature of the
</p>
<p>first he opened, then read it leisurely, and looking at
</p>
<p>me with a beaming countenance, extended his hand.
</p>
<p>"You are welcome, sir," said he; "welcome to
</p>
<p>danger's hour. In the morning we march on an
</p>
<p>expedition which may decide the fate of the campaign. My engagements must excuse my seeming
</p>
<p>neglect of you this evening. But let me make you
</p>
<p>known to your future comrades."
</p>
<p>Then turning to a fair-haired youth, already known
</p>
<p>to the reader as Arthur Trevor, he introduced him
</p>
<p>as his mother's son. I was then made acquainted
</p>
<p>with Schwartz and Witt, and several others. Among
</p>
<p>the number were a few young men from the lower
</p>
<p>counties, of good families and education, who, in this

<p>crisis, had left their homes to engage in this expedi

</p>

</p>
<p>tion. These, like their leader, had all learned to
</p>
<p>accommodate themselves to the fashions of that wild
</p>
<p>country, and its wilder climate, and especially to
</p>
<p>their own wild life. Each individual was dressed,
</p>
<p>from top to toe, in leather, no otherwise differing
</p>
<p>from the dress of the rudest mountaineer, than in
</p>
<p>neatness, and a certain easy grace, and air of fashion,
</p>
<p>which no dress can entirely conceal. In any dress,
</p>
<p>in any company, under any circumstances, Douglas
</p>
<p>Trevor would have been recognized as a gentlemllan.
</p>
<p>I hardly remember how I fared, or how I passed
</p>
<p>the night. As a stranger, Ipresume somewhat better
</p>
<p>than most others; but I took pains to show that I
</p>
<p>was content to eat what I could'get, and to lodge as
</p>
<p>I might.
</p>
<p>At daylight we -were on the road. But little
</p>
<p>attention was paid to order. No enemy was near,
</p>
<p>and nobody was inclined to desert. There was
</p>
<p>therefore no necessity for harassing men and
</p>
<p>horses, by forcing them to keep in ranks. Each man
</p>
<p>rode where, and with whom he pleased, except that
</p>
<p>a few were directed to keep near the wagons, not
</p>
<p>so much to guard as to assist in case of need. It is
</p>
<p>impossible to conceive a military array, with less of
</p>
<p>the "pomp and circumstance of war." The horses
</p>
<p>were, for the most part, substantial, and in substantial order. Their equipments were of the rudest sort.
</p>
<p>Plough-bridles and pack-saddles were most common.

<p>The only arms were the rifle, knife, and tomahawk,

</p>
<p>with their appropriate accompaniments of powder.
</p>
<p>horn, charger, and pouch. Douglas, indeed, had
</p>
<p>a sword, and the few sabres taken from the dragoons
</p>
<p>had been distributed among the principal men. But
</p>
<p>they were all too wise to encumber their persons
</p>
<p>with these weapons, which might have been troublesome in their mode of warfare. A strong loop of
</p>
<p>thick leather, stitched to the skirt of the saddle, in
</p>
<p>front of the left knee, received the sword, the hilt of
</p>
<p>which stood up above the pummel. Two or three
</p>
<p>of the saddles were of the Spanish fashion, the horn
</p>
<p>of which served to support any trifle the rider might
</p>
<p>wish to hang on it. Douglas, in particular, carried,
</p>
<p>in this way, a leather case, containing his writing
</p>
<p>materials, and serving as a tablet for writing on
</p>
<p>horseback.
</p>
<p>But rude as these equipments were, yet to one
</p>
<p>acquainted with the object of the expedition, there
</p>
<p>was an appearance of efficiency in the whole which
</p>
<p>gave the corps a truly formidable aspect. The perfect order of the arms, the strong rude dress of the
</p>
<p>men, their sinewy frames, their sunburnt faces; and,
</p>
<p>above all, the serious and resolved expression of
</p>
<p>countenance which generally prevailed, were tokens
</p>
<p>which none but a martinet would overlook.
</p>
<p>As yet no duty had been assigned to me, so that
</p>
<p>I was perfectly disengaged. It was not until we had
</p>
<p>ridden. several miles, that Douglas found leisuire to
</p>
<p>converse with me. He then joined me, accompanied

<p>by Schwartz, to whom, in my presence, he explained
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>343
</p>
<p>my situation. Schwartz heard him with thoughtful
</p>
<p>attention, and then said: " It is all mighty well, sir,
</p>
<p>if Mr. Sidney will only just take it right. You see,
</p>
<p>sir," continued he, addressing me, "there an't no
</p>
<p>officers among us, and we only just call the Cap
</p>
<p>tain so for short. If he was a Captain or a Gineral
</p>
<p>it would not make much odds, because these fellows
</p>
<p>just go for what is right and hard fighting; and him
</p>
<p>they believe in, him they mind. But as to who is
</p>
<p>first and who is second, that's neither here nor there.
</p>
<p>I have not a doubt that you are the sort of a man we
</p>
<p>want; but all that we can do, is to give you a fair
</p>
<p>chance to let the men see it. The Captain can be
</p>
<p>asking your advice, now and then, and I and Witt
</p>
<p>will do the same, and when they see that, they will
</p>
<p>begin to find out what you are. And then, you see,
</p>
<p>sir, when once we get to fighting, a man is never in
</p>
<p>such a flurry himself, but what he can see who
</p>
<p>knows what he is about, and who does not. So, by
</p>
<p>the time we have had a skrimmage or two, the men
</p>
<p>will know all about you; and whenever the Captain
</p>
<p>is out of the way, they will all be looking to you to
</p>
<p>know what to do; just in the way of giving your
</p>
<p>opinion, mind; but, after a while it will get to be
</p>
<p>orders. And then, if any thing happens to the Captain, and Witt and I don't see cause to change our
</p>
<p>mind, why, we only just have to follow you, and the
</p>
<p>men they follow us, and all will go straight. So
</p>
<p>you must just make yourself easy and keep quiet.
</p>
<p>We'll tell you when to speak, and after a while

<p>you'll find yourself second in command before you

<p>know it."
</p>
<p>I had no difficulty in acknowledging the reasonableness of these ideas, though it seemed a new thing
</p>
<p>to find a man possessing the influence and authority
</p>
<p>of Schwartz, devising means to transfer them to
</p>
<p>another. But he knew, and the event showed that
</p>
<p>he was right, that there were some duties of a comrn
</p>
<p>mander for which he was not fit; and that there
</p>
<p>were other things to which a chief could not devote
</p>
<p>himself, for which he was better qualified than any
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>On the third of November we reached the rendezvous, at the house of Mr. Gordon. On the way
</p>
<p>we had received frequent accessions of strength, and
</p>
<p>here we were joined by a yet larger reinforcement.
</p>
<p>Our whole number could not have been much, if at
</p>
<p>all, short of a thousand men.
</p>
<p>Meantime scouts came in, from whom we learned
</p>
<p>that the same day had been fixed for the march of
</p>
<p>the troops from Lynchburg. It followed that we
</p>
<p>had abundance of time for our preparations. It so
</p>
<p>happened, that they had not learned the name of
</p>
<p>the new commander; but it was understood that a
</p>
<p>reinforcement had arrived, and that nearly the
</p>
<p>whole disposable force was on the march. This
</p>
<p>included a troop of dragoons and a company of
</p>
<p>artillery, with two pieces of cannon, in addition to a
</p>
<p>full regiment, of infantry, and one battalion of

</p>
<p>345
</p>
<p>Having ascertained his force, and fixed on those
</p>
<p>on whom he could rely to understand and execute
</p>
<p>his plans, Douglas proceeded to make a temporary
</p>
<p>organization, suited to the occasion. The men were
</p>
<p>divided into corps, to each of which a post was provisionally assigned, to be occupied as soon as the
</p>
<p>approach of the enemy should be announced.
</p>
<p>Across the road, near the head of the defile, and
</p>
<p>just above the first angle next the top of the ascent,
</p>
<p>was constructed a barricade of logs, similar to those
</p>
<p>already described. This reached, on each side, to
</p>
<p>the foot of the hills, at steep, rocky, and impracticable points. It was long enough for twenty men to
</p>
<p>mall its twenty loop-holes, and as it reached above
</p>
<p>their heads, they were quite concealed. An hundred men were allotted to this post, who were ranged
</p>
<p>five deep behind the barricade, and instructed to fire
</p>
<p>in turn, each man falling back to the rear to reload
</p>
<p>as soon as he had discharged his piece.
</p>
<p>Others were distributed along the opposite faces
</p>
<p>of the hills overlooking the road, and directed to
</p>
<p>seek out hiding-places behind rocks, trees, and
</p>
<p>bushes. These men were under the immediate
</p>
<p>orders of individuals selected for the occasion, but
</p>
<p>attached to the command of Witt, who was stationed
</p>
<p>at the barrier.
</p>
<p>About a hundred were placed in ambush in the
</p>
<p>mouth of the ravine, just below the road, on the
</p>
<p>north side of the river, under Schwartz. These

<p>sharp-shooters-who were placed there for the purpose of attacking and carrying the guns of the
</p>
<p>enemy at the water's edge.
</p>
<p>Douglas himself, at the head of the rest of his
</p>
<p>corps, prepared to occupy the road on the north
</p>
<p>side of the river, to bring on the action. These
</p>
<p>were divided into two equal bodies, and the whole
</p>
<p>ranged in platoons, at open order, across the road.
</p>
<p>Of the two battalions, as they may be called, the
</p>
<p>foremost was placed under my command. The
</p>
<p>other Douglas commanded in person. My orders
</p>
<p>were to post my headmost platoon just at the bend
</p>
<p>of the road, on the top of the hill where it turns to
</p>
<p>the right. They were instructed to fire ad libitum,
</p>
<p>each man choosing and making sure of his mark,
</p>
<p>and then to file away by the right, and, taking to
</p>
<p>their heels, to run down to the river, cross it, and
</p>
<p>dispose themselves on the other bank, so as most
</p>
<p>effectually to gall the enemy, should he attempt to
</p>
<p>cross. Each platoon, in succession, was to march up
</p>
<p>to the same ground, and, having fired, to execute
</p>
<p>the same manceuvre. The remaining column, under
</p>
<p>Douglas, were to stand their ground until the enemy
</p>
<p>should come in view on the top of the hill, and then
</p>
<p>to fall back fighting, and cross under cover of those
</p>
<p>who should have passed before. But the best

<p>CHAPTER XXXVIII.
</p>
<p>The triumph and the vanity,
</p>
<p>The rapture of the strife;
</p>
<p>The earthquake voice of victory,
</p>
<p>To thee the breath of life;
</p>
<p>All quelled:-Dark spirit, what must be
</p>
<p>The madness of thy memory?
</p>
<p>WHILE these arrangements were in progress,
</p>
<p>scouts were hourly arriving. The country being
</p>
<p>altogether friendly, they were readily provided with
</p>
<p>fresh horses; and, before the enemy were half way
</p>
<p>from Lynchburg, we were fully apprised of their
</p>
<p>number, equipments, and order of march. First
</p>
<p>came a squadron of dragoons; then a light company;
</p>
<p>then Trevor's regiment, about five hundred strong;
</p>
<p>then a company of artillery; then one battalion of
</p>
<p>Mason's regiment, consisting @f something more
</p>
<p>than two hundred men; the whole followed by a
</p>
<p>few light troops, by way of rear-guard. The whole
</p>
<p>might amount to a thousand men, well appointed
</p>
<p>and prepared at all points for efficient action.
</p>
<p>On the morning of the fifth of November, the
</p>
<p>men were ordered to betake themselves to their

<p>allotted posts; and Douglas, having visited each,
</p>
<p>348
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and seen that all was right, and rightly understood,
</p>
<p>addressed himself to his particular command. Wher,,
</p>
<p>every man is an officer, each must be told individually beforehand what is expected from him.
</p>
<p>Panic apart, they will be apt to fulfil such instructions, and will fight with the terrible efficiency of
</p>
<p>individual animosity. Hence the formidable character of partisan warfare.
</p>
<p>At length the enemy made their appearance.
</p>
<p>Clinging to the idea of surprising Douglas, Col. Trevor sent forward no advance, but determined to bring
</p>
<p>the whole strength of his corps to bear upon him at
</p>
<p>once. If he employed any scouts, they were either
</p>
<p>unfaithful, or were not permitted to approach near
</p>
<p>enough to learn any thing of the position or movements of Douglas. The consequence was, that Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor received the first intimation of his presence
</p>
<p>from a sharp firing in front, which sent his horse to
</p>
<p>the right-about and back to the rear. Pressing forward, he immediately ordered his sharp-shooters to,disperse and take positions to gall us, while he pushed
</p>
<p>on his solid column of heavy infantry. The reception
</p>
<p>prepared for them was such as he had not dreamed of.
</p>
<p>His men fell like leaves in autumn; and, as fast as
</p>
<p>one platoon of the mountaineers discharged their
</p>
<p>pieces, another was on the same ground to pour in
</p>
<p>again that terrible fire, of which the martinets of the
</p>
<p>regular service have so inadequate an idea. Instead
</p>
<p>of the deep-mouthed peal of muskets, discharged

</p>
<p>simultaneously, there is the sharp, short crack of rifle
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>349
</p>
<p>after rifle, fired by men no one of whom touches the
</p>
<p>trigger until he sees precisely where his ball is to go.
</p>
<p>The effect was suitable to the cause; but yet the steady
</p>
<p>infantry pressed on,
</p>
<p>" Each stepping where his comrade stood,"
</p>
<p>to form an unbroken front, in order to charge with the
</p>
<p>bayonet.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the firing ceased, and, behold, their enemy seemed to have fled from the expected charge.
</p>
<p>The fact was, that my last platoon, having fired, had
</p>
<p>withdrawn like their predecessors, and were running
</p>
<p>at full speed after their companions, down the hill and
</p>
<p>across the river. At the water's edge, I stopped and
</p>
<p>joined Schwartz in his ambush. It had been arranged
</p>
<p>that I should do this; because, in case we should be
</p>
<p>so fortunate as to seize the cannon, my skill as an
</p>
<p>artillerist might be of great use. Meantime, my men
</p>
<p>having crossed over, dispersed themselves along the
</p>
<p>bank, the face of the hills, and across the road, to
</p>
<p>cover the retreat of those who remained.
</p>
<p>The regulars had necessarily spent a few moments
</p>
<p>in repairing the wreck of their shattered column before
</p>
<p>they advanced. They then moved forward; but, before
</p>
<p>they turned the angle of the road, most of my men
</p>
<p>were across the river. At the same time, the column
</p>
<p>under the immediate command of Douglas was seen
</p>
<p>drawn up in the road, near the foot of the hill, with
</p>
<p>the rear resting on the water's edge. As the enemy

</p>
<p>advanced the front platoon fired, faced to the right,
</p>
<p>350
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and filing along the flank of the column, entered the
</p>
<p>river and crossed just below the ford. They next
</p>
<p>filed to the left in the same way, and crossed above
</p>
<p>the ford. In this manner the whole column disap.
</p>
<p>peared, one platoon after another, while their fire was
</p>
<p>answered by a roar of musketry, which, being discharged from the higher ground, did more harm to
</p>
<p>those on the farther bank of the river than to the
</p>
<p>nearer enemy. At length the last platoon was withdrawn, and the regulars rushed down toward the rivet
</p>
<p>for the purpose of annoying them in crossing. In this
</p>
<p>attempt they were again checked and driven back by
</p>
<p>the terrible fire of my men, who, having already
</p>
<p>crossed, were drawn up, as I have said, on the other
</p>
<p>bank.
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor now saw the necessity of advancing his
</p>
<p>artillery, which was accordingly hurried down to the
</p>
<p>water's edge to clear a passage for the infantry. By
</p>
<p>the time the cannon were unlimbered, not a man of
</p>
<p>the mountaineers was to be seen. As soon as their
</p>
<p>companions had crossed, they dispersed with every
</p>
<p>appearance of confusion and alarm; some scampering
</p>
<p>along the road, and some clambering up the hills on
</p>
<p>both sides of it.
</p>
<p>The way was now open, and the infantry advanced
</p>
<p>to cross the river. At this moment Colonel Mason,
</p>
<p>riding up to Colonel Trevor, pointed out the advantageous position of the artillery as a cover to his rear, if
</p>
<p>he should be forced to retreat. " Give me leave to

<p>cannon where they are. The cavalry, too, cannot act
</p>
<p>with effect among those hills, and the two together,
</p>
<p>should the fortune of the day be unpropitious, may
</p>
<p>be of more use here than on the other side."
</p>
<p>"You say true," said Trevor. " It shall be as you
</p>
<p>advise, and you, Colonel, will remain in command of
</p>
<p>this reserve."
</p>
<p>" I earnestly beg, sir," said Mason, "that you will
</p>
<p>not deny me a share in the work of the day. The
</p>
<p>Captains of artillery and dragoons are all-sufficient to
</p>
<p>the command of their respective corps."
</p>
<p>"Pardon me, sir," said Trevor. "None can be so
</p>
<p>proper to execute your prudent and cautious device
</p>
<p>as you, its author. You will be pleased, therefore, to
</p>
<p>repair to the rear, rally the dragoons, and bring them
</p>
<p>down to the water's edge. Let them be ready to cross
</p>
<p>at a moment's warning, to assist in the pursuit as soon
</p>
<p>as I have driven the enemy into the plain."
</p>
<p>Saying this, Colonel Trevor turned off, and giving
</p>
<p>the word to march, dashed into the river. Poor
</p>
<p>Mason, insulted and mortified, nevertheless patiently
</p>
<p>addressed himself to the duty assigned him. Thus
</p>
<p>was this able and brave man denied all participation
</p>
<p>in an affair which his arrogant and sanguine commander believed to be an abounding source of honor
</p>
<p>to all who might be engaged in it.

<p>I have omitted- to mention that, as soon as the
</p>
<p>plan of endeavoring to surprise the artillery had

<p>sand, and to mark the proper positions of the artillerists employed about it. While I did this, some
</p>
<p>ten or fifteen of our best marksmen stood by, looking
</p>
<p>on attentively. When my sketch was done, he
</p>
<p>turned to one of them, and pointing to one of the
</p>
<p>marks made to stand for an artillerist, said coolly:
</p>
<p>" Now, this is your man;" and to another, " this is
</p>
<p>yours." Thus he went on till he had doomed every
</p>
<p>victim.
</p>
<p>While we are supplying this omission in our narrative, the reader will please to suppose that Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor's regiment have forded the river, and have
</p>
<p>passed up the road and out of sight. It will be
</p>
<p>remembered that the hills on both sides of the defile

</p>
<p>the greater part of the advance had, on recrossing
</p>
<p>the river, thrown themselves into the same places of
</p>
<p>concealment. But the idea that they had done so
</p>
<p>for any purpose but that of safety, entered not into
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor's mind. Indeed, if he had had any
</p>
<p>doubt, it must have been removed when he found,
</p>
<p>that as his column wound through the deep defile,
</p>
<p>not a shot molested their march. At the first angle
</p>
<p>of the road he halted and let the column march past
</p>
<p>him. He could see, from this point, both the head
</p>
<p>of it, as it advanced, and the rear as it came up. As
</p>
<p>the latter passed the spot where he stood, the leading platoon was in the act of turning the next angle
</p>
<p>of the road. At that moment he heard the startling

<p>report of a volley of rifles. He set spurs to his horse
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>353
</p>
<p>to gallop to the front, when every rock and every
</p>
<p>tree of the surrounding hills burst into flame, and
</p>
<p>the deep ravine echoed to the report of a hundred
</p>
<p>rifles. A shot struck his horse, and another piercing
</p>
<p>his hat, grazed tire top of his head deep enough to
</p>
<p>lay bare the skull, and stun him, as he fell under his
</p>
<p>slaughtered horse. He was thus placed hors du
</p>
<p>combat, owing the preservation of his life to the in
</p>
<p>signia of his rank which had endangered it.
</p>
<p>The sound of this firing was the signal for us.
</p>
<p>Each of the selected marksmen fixed his aim on his
</p>
<p>appropriate victim; and, at a word from Schwartz,
</p>
<p>the artillerymen at the guns fell as if swept away
</p>
<p>by the breath of a tempest. Rushing from our hiding-place, the cannon were instantly in our possession. The company of artillery were not slow to
</p>
<p>disappear behind the angle of the rock, and one or
</p>
<p>two who peeped out, being instantly picked off, we
</p>
<p>saw no more of them.
</p>
<p>Presently we heard the heavy tramp of the squadron slowly descending the hill, accompanied with
</p>
<p>the peculiar sound of dragoons, dressing the front in
</p>
<p>preparation for a sudden and overwhelming charge.
</p>
<p>While this was passing, our guns were all reloaded.' Mind, boys," said Schwartz; " all of number one."
</p>
<p>The word was understood, and every alternate man
</p>
<p>stood ready, with rifle cocked and trigger set, to
</p>
<p>receive the enemy. The charge was sounded, and
</p>
<p>the leading horsemen, wheeling around the rock,

</p>
<p>were rushing on at full speed, when horses and
</p>
<p>354
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>riders were seen to go down in one promiscuous
</p>
<p>heap. The greater number of the squadron were
</p>
<p>still out of sight; and, had the way been open, might
</p>
<p>have followed to share the fate of their companions,
</p>
<p>and finally to ride us down when our guns should
</p>
<p>have been all discharged. But the work had been
</p>
<p>done too effectually. The dead and wounded (both
</p>
<p>horse and rider) nearly filled the road; and for dragoons to pick their way among such appalling
</p>
<p>obstacles in the face of fifty loaded rifles at a distance of twenty paces, was out of the question. A
</p>
<p>few who made the attempt found this to their cost.
</p>
<p>The charge was not renewed, and some of our men
</p>
<p>advancing to the angle of the rock, and occupying
</p>
<p>inaccessible but commanding points on the hills,
</p>
<p>soon made them draw off to a safe distance.
</p>
<p>While this was doing, I, with the few men selected
</p>
<p>for the service of the artillery, gave my attention to
</p>
<p>that. Glancing my eye along both pieces, I saw
</p>
<p>that both had been accurately pointed into the road
</p>
<p>on the other side. I had nothing, therefore, to do
</p>
<p>but to apply the port-fire, which was still burning
</p>
<p>in the clenched hand of a dead artillerist. By this
</p>
<p>time the column had fallen back, and the road below
</p>
<p>the first angle was fast filling with the retreating
</p>
<p>mass. I had never before witnessed the effusion of
</p>
<p>blood; and, heated as mine now was, it ran cold as
</p>
<p>T applied the match. As the smoke cleared off, I
</p>
<p>saw the enemy throwing away their arms, and

</p>
<p>some aloft to the unseen foe that galled them from
</p>
<p>the hills. The fire instantly slackened, and cravats
</p>
<p>and handkerchiefs being raised on the points of
</p>
<p>swords and bayonets, it ceased altogether. The
</p>
<p>mountaineers now poured down from the hills into
</p>
<p>the ravine, securing the arms of the enemy, mixing
</p>
<p>among them and hemming them in on every side.
</p>
<p>Douglas, whose place, since he had recrossed the
</p>
<p>river, had been among these concealed marksmen,
</p>
<p>was one of the first to approach the enemy. Advancing to those whose rank was most conspicuous, he
</p>
<p>made known his authority, and received their swords.
</p>
<p>Meantime Col. Trevor had recovered his senses,
</p>
<p>and found himself fastened to the ground by the
</p>
<p>weight of his horse, which lay upon his leg. He
</p>
<p>was presently discovered, relieved, and helped to
</p>
<p>rise. At this moment he caught the eye of Douglas,
</p>
<p>who hastened to him, less fromn impatience to
</p>
<p>demand his sword, than to offer assistance to one
</p>
<p>who seemed to be an officer of high rank, and badly
</p>
<p>wounded. In the figure before him, all smeared
</p>
<p>with blood and dirt, he saw nothing by which he
</p>
<p>could recognize his brother. To the Colonel, the
</p>
<p>disguise of Douglas was hardly less complete. He
</p>
<p>had seen him receiving the surrender of others, and
</p>
<p>stood prepared to go through the same humiliating
</p>
<p>ceremony. He felt that his own disgrace was complete, and the form of surrender was thought of with
</p>
<p>indifference. He had already reached the lowest

</p>
<p>"But in that lowest depth a lower deep" seemed
</p>
<p>to open, when, as he extended his hand to deliver
</p>
<p>his sword to the victor, he discovered that the hand
</p>
<p>put forth to receive it was that of Douglas. He
</p>
<p>flung down his sword, stamping with rage, and irnnlediately after called to his men to resume their
</p>
<p>arms. The voice struck the ear of Douglas, though
</p>
<p>dissonant with passion. The figure too, confirmed
</p>
<p>his suspicion of the truth; and he immediately
</p>
<p>rushed to screen his brother with his own body from
</p>
<p>the rifles pointed against him. Calling for aid to
</p>
<p>those around, he presently succeeded in securing the
</p>
<p>Colonel, and after one or two fruitless attempts to
</p>
<p>soothe him, ordered him away to the house of Mr.
</p>
<p>Gordon. To that gentleman he spoke aside, and
</p>
<p>explaining in confidence the strange scene that he
</p>
<p>had just witnessed, besought him to take command
</p>
<p>of the escort, and to pay all imaginable attention to
</p>
<p>the health, comfort, and feelings of the Colonel.
</p>
<p>He was accordingly led away, raging and foaming
</p>
<p>at the mouth like a spoiled child who has been
</p>
<p>deprived of his toy, or baulked in his anasement.
</p>
<p>The mortification of Douglas was extreme; but he had
</p>
<p>the satisfaction to find that Arthur was not present;
</p>
<p>and to no other person but Schwartz and myself did
</p>
<p>the name of Colonel Trevor afford a hint of the

<p>If thou didst but consent

<p>To this most cruel act, do but despair;
</p>
<p>And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
</p>
<p>That ever spider twisted from her womb
</p>
<p>Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be

<p>A beam to hang thee on I Or, wouldst thou drown thyself;

<p>Put but a little water in a spoon,

<p>And it shall be, as all the ocean,
</p>
<p>Enough to stifle such a villain I
</p>
<p>I SHALL not detain the reader with a detail of the
</p>
<p>farther particulars of this skirmish. Indeed we hardly
</p>
<p>stayed to acquaint ourselves with its exact results. As
</p>
<p>at least half the men who had fought under Douglas
</p>
<p>on that day had no intention to follow him any farther,
</p>
<p>we left to them the care of the killed, wounded, and
</p>
<p>prisoners. The body of Col. Mason alone was selected
</p>
<p>for a more honorable burial than the rude hands of
</p>
<p>the mountaineers could bestow. It was dragged from
</p>
<p>beneath the incumbent mass of men and horses, placed
</p>
<p>on a suitable carriage, covered with the colors of his
</p>
<p>regiment, and taken to Lynchburg, to be there restored to his companions in arms. The band of his
</p>
<p>regiment were also marched to that place to assist in

<p>rendering the last honors to their late commander.
</p>
<p>358
</p>
<p>The Partisan LeadeHaving given the necessary orders, Douglas snatched
</p>
<p>a moment to ride to Mr. Gordon's, where he hoped to
</p>
<p>find his brother in a more reasonable mood. The
</p>
<p>Colonel had been confined in a private room; and,
</p>
<p>being treated with great courtesy and respect, had lost
</p>
<p>nothing of his arrogance. Such is always the effect
</p>
<p>of delicate attention to the undeserving. A man of
</p>
<p>merit would have been softened and melted by the
</p>
<p>deference with which Colonel Trevor was treated. To
</p>
<p>him it seemed but that sort of spontaneous homage to
</p>
<p>greatness which the heart pays unconsciously. The
</p>
<p>effect of it was, that being told by Mr. Gordon that his
</p>
<p>brother had come to visit him in his room, he sent
</p>
<p>him the following magnanimous note, pencilled on the
</p>
<p>back of a letter:
</p>
<p>" I am your prisoner. Do with me as you please,
</p>
<p>Inflict on me any death, however cruel; but spare me
</p>
<p>the sight of one whose treasons have dishonored our
</p>
<p>common name, and who has deprived me of my only
</p>
<p>chance to restore its former splendor."
</p>
<p>Douglas was inexpressibly shocked at this manifestation of a temper at once savage and coldly selfish.
</p>
<p>But he had no time to waste in parleying with the
</p>
<p>ungoverned passions of his brother, and wrote an
</p>
<p>answer in these words:
</p>
<p>" You are my prisoner, and mine only, and shall be
</p>
<p>treated with all tenderness and respect. I am responsible to no one kor your custody, and you shall soon be
</p>
<p>at liberty. Go home. Go to our venerable father,

<p>and comfort his declining years. If the instincts of

</p>
<p>359
</p>
<p>your heart do not restrain you from fighting against
</p>
<p>your brothers (for Arthur is with me), let a sense of
</p>
<p>honor make you regard yourself as a prisoner on
</p>
<p>parole, not at liberty to fight again against Virginia.
</p>
<p>Meantime your sword shall be restored, and you shall
</p>
<p>be treated in all things as the brother of D. T."
</p>
<p>While Douglas was engaged in this painful duty,
</p>
<p>Arthur was employed in preparing a formal report of
</p>
<p>the events of the day. This was signed by the
</p>
<p>Chief on his return, and with it the young man was
</p>
<p>despatched to B, with instructions to ask his
</p>
<p>orders, and return with them, unless another messenger should be preferred. In the meantime all things
</p>
<p>had been made ready for the march to Lynchburg. I
</p>
<p>shall not give the history of this. It was triumphal,
</p>
<p>as far as complete success and the applauding gratulations of the people could make it so. We had no
</p>
<p>difficulty in adding to our numbers as many men as
</p>
<p>the fruits of our victory enabled us to supply with
</p>
<p>arms. Some joined us instantly, and others engaged
</p>
<p>to rendezvous at Lynchburg in a few days.
</p>
<p>There was nothing to damp the pleasure of Douglas,
</p>
<p>but the conduct of his perverse brother, and the presence of the dead body of his old friend, Colonel
</p>
<p>Mason. On our arrival before the camp at Lynchburg, I received orders to present myself with a flag
</p>
<p>before the gate, at the head of a detachment which
</p>
<p>escorted the body, accompanied by the music of
</p>
<p>his band, and all the sad and imposing insignia of a
</p>
<p>military funeral.

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>An officer came out to meet us, and thus received
</p>
<p>the first authentic history of the fate of the expedition. I was instructed to deliver over the body of
</p>
<p>Colonel Mason with every circumstance of respect
</p>
<p>and courtesy. I was also charged to demand the surrender of the entrenched camp, and of the garrison as
</p>
<p>prisoners of war.
</p>
<p>A negotiation ensued, which ended in a suspension
</p>
<p>of arms for five days, and an agreement to surrender
</p>
<p>if, in that time, no reinforcement arrived.
</p>
<p>This arrangement was by no means unwelcome to
</p>
<p>Douglas. It gave him time to receive and organize
</p>
<p>the new recruits that were pouring in, and to await
</p>
<p>the return of Arthur. In the meantime, much of that
</p>
<p>sort of intercourse which is common on such occasions took place. There are few things in life more
</p>
<p>pleasant than it is. There must be less of malignity
</p>
<p>in human nature than is generally supposed, or men
</p>
<p>would not seize, with so much eagerness, on opportunities to lose the idea of public hostility in the
</p>
<p>kindly interchange of courtesy and good offices.
</p>
<p>Friendships are never formed more suddenly and cordially than under such circumstances. So we found
</p>
<p>it on this occasion. Major Wood, the officer in command, was a gentleman and soldier, honorable, frank,
</p>
<p>generous, and accomplished. I was brought much
</p>
<p>into contact with him, and found him enthusiastic in
</p>
<p>his acknowledgments of the merits of Douglas, and
</p>
<p>eager to become acquainted with him. But the time

</p>
<p>had not come when he was willing to be known by his
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>361
</p>
<p>true name; and besides that he was acquainted with
</p>
<p>the Major, there were many others in the camp who
</p>
<p>would have recognized him. He therefore confined
</p>
<p>himself to his quarters, on various pleas of business;
</p>
<p>and, to make his seclusion effectual, took lodgings in
</p>
<p>a house in the suburbs of the town. By his advice,
</p>
<p>I mixed much with the men; and, as I had acquitted
</p>
<p>myself to their entire satisfaction in the late affair, I
</p>
<p>found that I was in a fair way to be recognized as
</p>
<p>second in command. Schwartz and Witt made a
</p>
<p>point of consulting me publicly on all occasions; and
</p>
<p>this circumstance, together with my daily attention to
</p>
<p>the organization of the troops, obtained me full credit
</p>
<p>for all my military skill, and a great deal more.
</p>
<p>The five days passed away quite pleasantly. The
</p>
<p>regulars, finding that they were not like to fall into
</p>
<p>the hands of savages, were becoming reconciled to the
</p>
<p>fate which now seemed inevitable; and we parted on
</p>
<p>the last night of the truce, with no unpleasant anticipations of the surrender which was to take place the
</p>
<p>next day at noon.
</p>
<p>The morning came, and our men paraded in high
</p>
<p>spirits, and with considerable show of order and discipline. This was particularly the case with a small
</p>
<p>company which had been detailed for the service of
</p>
<p>the artillery, who took their stand at the guns with
</p>
<p>the air of men proud of their new acquirements. I
</p>
<p>had indeed taken great pains to train and exercise
</p>
<p>them, and, by universal consent, was recognized as

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>drawn up with the cannon planted directly against the
</p>
<p>gate of the camp.
</p>
<p>All this time Douglas did not make his appearance.
</p>
<p>At length the.hour approached for the garrison to
</p>
<p>march out, and lay down their arms, when Schwartz
</p>
<p>went to his quarters to receive his orders. He soon
</p>
<p>returned, and taking me aside, told me that Douglas
</p>
<p>was not at his quarters, and was nowhere to be
</p>
<p>seen.
</p>
<p>We had already observed appearances in the camp
</p>
<p>not at all answerable to the expected surrender, and
</p>
<p>I was now startled at this intelligence. The character
</p>
<p>of Major Wood forbade indeed any suspicion of foul
</p>
<p>play. But the time was near at hand when the enemy
</p>
<p>should march out, and we heard nothing of their
</p>
<p>drums, calling the men to parade. We determined,
</p>
<p>therefore, to send a flag to the camp on some pretext.
</p>
<p>The officer who carried it was immediately warned
</p>
<p>off, and having said that he had a communication for
</p>
<p>Major Wood, was told that that officer was no longer
</p>
<p>in command, and that COL. TREVOR would receive no
</p>
<p>communication from rebels and traitors.
</p>
<p>This was decisive. The quarters of Douglas were
</p>
<p>not very distant from the enemy, and such had been
</p>
<p>the appearance of perfect good faith in all their proceedings, that our camp had been guarded even more
</p>
<p>negligently than is common with militia. It seemed,
</p>
<p>indeed, almost incredible that Col. Trevor could have
</p>
<p>been guilty of an act of base treachery against the

<p>life or liberty of his generous brother; but to Schwartz
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>363
</p>
<p>and myself, who knew the connexion, even this seemed
</p>
<p>hardly less extravagant than his former conduct. That
</p>
<p>he had escaped, joined the troops, and disclaimed the
</p>
<p>capitulation entered into by Major Wood, was certain.
</p>
<p>To have surprised and carried off Douglas could not
</p>
<p>be much worse.
</p>
<p>We now consulted with Witt, to whom we communicated our suspicions, at the same time disclosing
</p>
<p>the true name of our young commander, and his relation to Col. Trevor. What was suspicion with us,
</p>
<p>was at once absolute certainty with him. I do not
</p>
<p>think I ever witnessed such a change as our communication made in the whole appearance and demeanor
</p>
<p>of the man. Heretofore, I had always seen him cool,
</p>
<p>cautious, deliberate, and thoughtful. There was,
</p>
<p>besides, a prevailing tone of benevolence in all he
</p>
<p>said, which, added to his sobriety and strong sense,
</p>
<p>gave him some claim to the title of philosopher. But
</p>
<p>now the expression of his countenance was terrible
</p>
<p>and awful. Ile had made no show of regard for
</p>
<p>Douglas; but his attachment was deep and abiding,
</p>
<p>and his alarm for his safety was in the same degree.
</p>
<p>He was impatient of a moment's delay, sternly protested against wasting time in discussion, and insisted
</p>
<p>on immediately storming the camp.
</p>
<p>Schwartz was nothing behind him in zeal, thousgh
</p>
<p>less disturbed by passion; and we presently determined to bring matters to extremities. As soon,

<p>therefore, as the hour appointed for surrender arrived,

</p>
<p>To this the only answer was a general fire of musketry
</p>
<p>from the whole line of the camp on that side, by which
</p>
<p>a few men were hurt. But the distance was too great
</p>
<p>for any serious mischief. Enough, however, was done
</p>
<p>to excite the men to fury; and without waiting for
</p>
<p>the word, they rushed to the assault. Their movement determined me. To rush up to the piqueted
</p>
<p>entrenchment, behind which the enemy were in comparative safety, was to expose themselves to destruction. It was indispensable to open a way for them.
</p>
<p>This I effected by a discharge of both pieces of artillery, which tore the gate away, and pointed their
</p>
<p>attack to this accessible point. The moment after,
</p>
<p>Colonel Trevor, with his untractable rashness, appeared
</p>
<p>in the gateway, shouting, and calling to his men tc
</p>
<p>sally forth against us. He was instantly recognized
</p>
<p>by the incensed Witt, whose fatal aim brought him to
</p>
<p>the ground. His men fell back; and in a moment
</p>
<p>after a white flag was raised.
</p>
<p>It was no easy matter to prevail on our men to
</p>
<p>pay any regard to this signal; but we succeeded in
</p>
<p>restraining them before it was too late. Of course
</p>
<p>we demanded the instant surrender of the place,
</p>
<p>which was unhesitatingly given up. Major Wood
</p>
<p>now came forward to apologize and explain. Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor, having made his escape, had returned to the
</p>
<p>camp soon after tattoo. His whole behavior was
</p>
<p>that of a man beside himself, and actuated by some
</p>
<p>inscrutable motive to sonme inscrutable purpose. Of

</p>
<p>disclaiming the capitulation, gave orders that all
</p>
<p>things should be prepared for a renewal of hostilities
</p>
<p>the next morning. Nothing more was known but
</p>
<p>that he had summoned to his quarters a favorite
</p>
<p>sergeant of his own regiment, who had been left
</p>
<p>sick in camp when he marched against Douglas.
</p>
<p>This sergeant and four soldiers, as it seemed from
</p>
<p>the morning report, had disappeared in the night.
</p>
<p>Major Wood assured us, that all that had been
</p>
<p>since done had taken place under the immediate
</p>
<p>orders and superintendence of Colonel Trevor, and
</p>
<p>in spite of his own most earnest remonstrances. In
</p>
<p>proof of his sincerity, he appealed to the fact of his
</p>
<p>unconditional surrender the moment he was apprised
</p>
<p>of the fall of the Colonel. With all this I was perfectly satisfied, and gladly returned him his sword,
</p>
<p>with a proper acknowledgment of his gentlemanly
</p>
<p>conduct.
</p>
<p>"And now, Major," said Schwartz, "there is
</p>
<p>another matter we want to talk to you about. Do
</p>
<p>you know any thing of our Captain a"
</p>

<p>of seeing him."
</p>
<p>"Look here, Major," said Witt, whose eye still
</p>
<p>glared with ferocity not at all abated by the fall of
</p>
<p>Trevor; " that a'nt the thing; and we want a
</p>
<p>straight answer. Captain Douglas is missing, and

<p>we want to know what's become of him."

<p>"None that I can imagine," was the reply.
</p>
<p>"Is there not a Captain here," asked Schwartz;

</p>
<p>at Farmville?"
</p>
<p>"Captain Cottle? Yes."
</p>
<p>"Well, I want to see him."
</p>
<p>He was immediately summoned, and presently
</p>
<p>made his reluctant appearance. His alarm increased
</p>
<p>on seeing Schwartz and Witt.
</p>
<p>"See here, Mister," said the former; "here is a
</p>
<p>piece of villany that we want to know about; and
</p>
<p>there is nobody, I reckon, so apt to tell us as
</p>
<p>you."
</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir," said Cottle, "I declare, sir, I don't

</p>
<p>"You don't, eh!" said Schwartz. "Well, any

<p>" Did you ever see me before?" said Witt, fixing

<p>his terrible eye on the alarmed Captain. " Did you

<p>ever see me before?" repeated he. " Do you remember where it was? Do you remember your busines

</p>
<p>who asked him what had become of Captain Douglas.
</p>
<p>He was now effectually scared out of all thought
</p>
<p>of concealment, and answered without prevarication
</p>
<p>that Captain Douglas had been surprised, during the
</p>
<p>night, by the order of Col. Trevor, and sent away
</p>
<p>immediately under the guard of a sergeant and four
</p>
<p>men, across the river. He could not say, certainly,
</p>
<p>where he was gone; but he suspected to Washington,
</p>
<p>as Col. Trevor appeared to have been writing busily
</p>
<p>all the tine the party were engaged in the capture
</p>
<p>of Douglas. It was vain to attempt concealing that
</p>
<p>he had a hand in this, though the disclosure was
</p>
<p>made with great reluctance. It appeared, moreover,
</p>
<p>that he had been anxious to accompany the prisoner,
</p>
<p>supposing him to be ordered for Washington; but
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor had refused to send him. Indeed, he
</p>
<p>sent none but those who had not been engaged in the
</p>
<p>action at the ford, and was certainly right not to trust
</p>
<p>the vain babbler, whose idle garrulity could hardly
</p>
<p>have failed to rub off any gloss he might have
</p>
<p>thought fit to spread over the affair.
</p>
<p>"How did they get across the river?" asked

<p>Schwartz. "We have a strong guard on the othe.

</p>
<p>below; and a handkerchief was tied over the Cap.,

</p>
<p>if he did, they were ordered to shoot him."
</p>
<p>I have no words to express the horror with which
</p>
<p>I heard this last circumstance. I trusted, and indeed
</p>
<p>Major Wood seemed to be of that opinion, that Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor had really been beside himself; but regarding
</p>
<p>his conduct even as the effect of frenzy, it was hardly

<p>less shocking. From Schwartz the. communication
</p>
<p>only called forth some pithy expressions of detestation, without seeming to interrupt the working of his
</p>
<p>thoughts, which were at once busy to devise some
</p>
<p>remedy for the evil.
</p>
<p>Witt was differently affected. His whole frame
</p>
<p>and countenance assumed an appearance of stony
</p>
<p>rigidity, betokening fixed and fearful purpose. He
</p>
<p>turned his glaring eye to the spot where Col. Trevor
</p>
<p>had fallen, with an expression that showed his vengeance quite unsatisfied. A glance of fierce scorn
</p>
<p>fell for a moment on Cottle; and then, with a searching look, he addressed himself to Major Wood.
</p>
<p>" Major Wood," said he, with a voice whose deep,
</p>
<p>stern tones, demanded the truth and the whole truth,
</p>
<p>" did you know any thing of this business?"

<p>" Upon my honor, I did not; and Captain Cottle,

<p>" Major Wood, do you know who Captain Douglas

<p>is? Do you know that he is Col. Trevor's own

</p>
<p>" Great God!" exclaimed the Major. "Douglas

<p>" I did," said Wood, "and loved him well. Poor

</p>
<p>" That's enough," said Witt. " I see now that you

<p>had no hand in it. But is it not your duty, Major
</p>
<p>Wood, to bring back Captain Douglas and set him

<p>at liberty?"

<p>"That might do," said the Major, hesitatingly;

</p>
<p>be forgiven. No matter; it shall be done if they

<p>you would have been hanging like a dog in half an

</p>
<p>There is a difference between the certainty of being

<p>hanged in half an hour, and a chance of escape,

<p>That lies like truth, and yet most truly lies.

<p>The President is alone as before. He has the same
</p>
<p>air of somewhat impatient expectation. A shade of
</p>
<p>anxious thought is on his brow, and his cheek is
</p>
<p>flushed with some little excitement. Yet these elements are all so mixed as to be scarcely perceptible;
</p>
<p>and were he conscious that we are looking at him,
</p>
<p>they would be completely concealed. On the table
</p>
<p>lie a number of letters recently received. Two of
</p>
<p>them are separated from the rest. He takes up one

<p>and reads it a second time. Let us look over him.

</p>
<p>He then took up the other letter, which I beg
</p>
<p>leave to lay before the reader, as a specimen of the
</p>
<p>art with which the truth may be so told as to make
</p>
<p>others believe what is false. I recommend it particularly to military gentlemen, reporting the results

<p>of a battle.
</p>
<p>HEAD QUARTERS, CAMP NEAR LYNCHBURG,
</p>
<p>November 12, 1849.
</p>
<p>SIR: I have the honor to lay before your Excellency an account of the operations of the troops
</p>
<p>under my command, since the date of my last despatch.
</p>
<p>In pursuance of the information I had received, of
</p>
<p>which your Excellency has been already advised, I
</p>
<p>marched on the third inst., at the head of my own
</p>
<p>regiment, one battalion of the 15th, a company of
</p>
<p>artillery, and one of dragoons, to meet Douglas on
</p>
<p>his descent from the mountains. At Jones's Ford,
</p>
<p>on Staunton river, I encountered him, when about
</p>
<p>half his force had crossed over. I attacked him
</p>
<p>immediately; and, after a sharp conflict, drove him
</p>
<p>across the river. By the advice of Col. Mason, I
</p>
<p>left the artillery and dragoons on the north bank, to
</p>
<p>protect our rear, placing them under the command
</p>
<p>of that distinguished officer.
</p>
<p>Pressing hard upon the rear of the enemy, we

</p>
<p>came up with him just as he had fallen back on the
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>373
</p>
<p>reserve. Here he rallied, and the fight was renewed.
</p>
<p>I regret to say that, at the first fire, my horse fell
</p>
<p>under me, imprisoning my leg by his fall. At the
</p>
<p>same moment a ball struck my head, and I came to
</p>
<p>the ground insensible.
</p>
<p>You will judge my astonishment, when, on recovering my senses, I found that all my men near me
</p>
<p>had thrown down their arms, and that I was in the
</p>
<p>hands of the enemy, who assisted me to rise. I
</p>
<p>immediately called to my men to resume their arms;
</p>
<p>but am sorry to inform you that I was not obeyed.
</p>
<p>As I had not surrendered, I was seized and hurried
</p>
<p>away to the house of a ring-leader of these rebels,
</p>
<p>where I was confined. From that time I had no
</p>
<p>means of receiving any information on which I could
</p>
<p>rely concerning the events of the day, as I had no
</p>
<p>intercourse with any but the rebels.
</p>
<p>Two days ago I was so fortunate as to make my
</p>
<p>escape. Returning to this place, I find my camp,
</p>
<p>which had been left under the command of Major
</p>
<p>Wood, beleaguered by the rebels, and a treaty for surrender in full progress. I rejoice that I have returned
</p>
<p>in time to prevent a consummation so disgraceful.
</p>
<p>It is now midnight, and a small party has been
</p>
<p>sent out to endeavor to surprise the leader of this
</p>
<p>banditti. In the meantime all things are put in
</p>
<p>readiness for a sortie in the morning. I shall not
</p>
<p>close my letter until I can give some further account
</p>
<p>of the success of these operations.

<p>to you, without awaiting the result of the meditated
</p>
<p>sortie in the morning. He therefore travels in custody of the bearer of this letter, under guard of a

<p>sergeant and four men.
</p>
<p>Having returned to the camp this night, after
</p>
<p>tattoo, I am unprepared to give any account of our
</p>
<p>loss, or that of the enemy. I have nothing authentic

<p>but the lamented death of Col. Mason, who fell fighting bravely.

<p>failure of my enterprise to the unfortunate wound
</p>
<p>which put me hors du combat, at a moment, up to

<p>which we had successfully driven the enemy before

<p>us for nearly half a mile and across the river.

<p>bend; his step nothing of its creeping, cautious
</p>
<p>tread; his countenance nothing of its abject servility.
</p>
<p>But there was more of anxiety and less of hope,
</p>
<p>with a slight appearance of peevish dissatisfaction.
</p>
<p>"You are very good, my dear sir," said the
</p>

<p>wish. Government would be an easy task, were

</p>
<p>I ought to public opinion. Perhaps I do so. as it is;

</p>
<p>"Let it not reach you, my dear sir. The storm
</p>
<p>does but rage without. Why need you hear it when
</p>
<p>it touches you not? Shut your ears and sleep
</p>
<p>soundly; or open them only to the more pleasant
</p>
<p>tones that issue from loyal lips. I take care not to
</p>
<p>know what is said of me by malcontent scribblers;
</p>
<p>but I hardly flatter myself that I should preserve
</p>
<p>my equanimity, if I read all that is written."
</p>
<p>"It is sometimes impossible not to hear," said
</p>
<p>the Judge; "and there are words which convey
</p>
<p>reproach, which, though uttered in a single breath,
</p>
<p>reach the heart. I can never, I fear, make myself
</p>
<p>proof against such a phrase as'judicial murder.'"

<p>"'But you must find consolation in your own

<p>must be expected when the edge of the law falls on

</p>
<p>are such as those the world calls honorable and upright are most likely to commit."
</p>
<p>" The misfortune is," replied the other, "'that it
</p>
<p>is only for such offences, and on such victims, that

<p>my office seems to be made to act; and when the

<p>uttered and echoed on every side, I pray your Excellency to pardon me, when I say, that I find its

</p>
<p>not more obnoxious to State policy than to the
</p>
<p>detestation of all good men, and of none more than
</p>
<p>yourself:"
</p>
<p>" Of whom is your Excellency pleased to speak?"
</p>
<p>asked Mr. Baker.
</p>
<p>"Of no other than that young fellow, Trevor,
</p>
<p>whose ill luck snatched him away from our hands,
</p>
<p>when perhaps he was not quite ripe for punishment.
</p>
<p>But he has since made himself perfect in crime, by
</p>
<p>becomining the leader of a desperate banditti. In
</p>
<p>short, he is no other than the famous Captain Douglas, and is now in my power. I think you will find
</p>
<p>in his case a fair set-off against some of the mortifications of which you complain; and think no more
</p>
<p>of denying your services to the public, at least until
</p>
<p>he has fulfilled his destiny."
</p>
<p>The effect of this communication on the mind of
</p>
<p>the honorable gentleman, was such as the President
</p>
<p>had anticipated. To every being of the name of
</p>
<p>Trevor he bore a mortal antipathy. In the case of
</p>
<p>Douglas, this was rendered more intense by the sympathy of a father with a favorite son. An envious
</p>
<p>malignity was a striking feature in the characters
</p>
<p>both of father and son; and this had been provoked
</p>
<p>to the utmost by that unfortunate young man. Both
</p>
<p>were sensible that the younger Baker had been in
</p>
<p>bad odor with the public, ever since the affair at the
</p>
<p>falls; and hence, it was not only grateful to their
</p>
<p>malice, but to their pride, to fasten on Douglas a

<p>stigma so dishonorable as to have relation back, and

</p>
<p>to excuse his adversary with those who did not
</p>
<p>know all the circumstances, for not seeking such
</p>
<p>redress as gentlemen demand of gentlemen only.
</p>
<p>The good humor of the Judge was now manifestly
</p>
<p>restored, and the President went on to give him some
</p>
<p>particulars of the late military occurrences. Douglas,
</p>
<p>he said, was on the road, and would reach Washington the next day. The letter, it seems, had been
</p>
<p>brought by a soldier who had orders to outgo the
</p>
<p>rest of the party, and ride express to Washington.
</p>
<p>"It is well," said the President, "that I have
</p>
<p>this timely intimation of his approach. The custody
</p>
<p>of State prisoners cannot be safely entrusted to any
</p>
<p>but the military; and that of this young man must
</p>
<p>be committed to no corps in which he had any
</p>
<p>acquaintance. It seems that he was a universal
</p>
<p>favorite among men and officers. I am about to take
</p>
<p>measures to guard against any such blunder."
</p>
<p>In such conversation half an hour was passed, when
</p>
<p>the Minister made his appearance. He had been
</p>
<p>sent for, and to him the President communicated the
</p>
<p>history of the capture of Douglas. Had he turned
</p>
<p>an eye of close scrutiny on the favorite, at the moment when he uttered the name, and announced the
</p>
<p>fate of his victim, he might. have seen a slight
</p>
<p>expression of countenance, which it would not have
</p>
<p>been easy to interpret. But this escaped him; and
</p>
<p>he went on to direct that the true name of the prisoner should be kept secret; that his arrival should

</p>
<p>379
</p>
<p>ducted to a place provided for the separate confinement of State prisoners. It was, moreover, ordered,
</p>
<p>that a detail of officers and men for that prison should
</p>
<p>be carefully made, so as to exclude any persons
</p>
<p>whose loyalty was at all doubtful; and especially all
</p>
<p>who, from former associations, could be supposed to
</p>
<p>feel any kindness for Douglas.
</p>
<p>Finally, it was agreed that, should he arrive in the
</p>
<p>course of that night, or the next day, he should be
</p>
<p>brought, on the following night, before the triumvirate, in the room where they then were.
</p>
<p>"You were right," continued the President, addressing his Minister, "when you said that this
</p>
<p>young man had talent. The discovery of his identity
</p>
<p>explains the marvellous organization and efficiency
</p>
<p>of that wild banditti that he commanded. His
</p>
<p>capture must be fatal to their future success. They
</p>
<p>must be powerless now that they have lost their
</p>
<p>leader, and must soon disband. That is well. The
</p>
<p>two regiments may now be marched from Lynchburg
</p>
<p>to Richmond, and save us the necessity of sending a
</p>
<p>reinforcement from this quarter. The troops there,
</p>
<p>with this aid, will certainly be sufficient to check the
</p>
<p>insurrectionary movements that we hear of in the
</p>
<p>southern counties, and to cover the meeting of the
</p>
<p>Legislature. Col. Trevor has certainly deserved well.

<p>I am afraid his unfortunate wound may have occasionled the loss of more men than we could well
</p>
<p>spare, who seem to have surrendered while he was

</p>
<p>will, of course, set them at liberty to return to their

<p>of his post, before he is promoted. That affair must

<p>A comely semblance, on which self may look

</p>
<p>ON his departure from Lynchburg, Schwartz had
</p>
<p>been provided with a suit of clothes half military, to
</p>
<p>prevent the notice which his rude mountain attire
</p>
<p>would have attracted. The day was half spent before he was on the road, and the sergeant and his
</p>
<p>party were already far in advance of him.
</p>
<p>Colonel Trevor had been desirous, for obvious
</p>
<p>reasons, that his letter and prisoner should reach
</p>
<p>Washington as soon as possible, and had ordered
</p>
<p>the party to proceed with all practicable despatch.
</p>
<p>But, as they might be somewhat retarded by the
</p>
<p>necessary care of their prisoner, he had directed that
</p>
<p>the letter should be sent on, as we have seen, by a
</p>
<p>single soldier, who had reached Washington on the
</p>
<p>second night. But the sergeant was not far behind,
</p>
<p>and had used such diligence that he crossed the
</p>
<p>bridge the next morning at an early hour, just as
</p>
<p>poor Schwartz came in sight.

<p>He recognized the party by the peculiar dress of
</p>
<p>382
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>Douglas, with which he was so familiar; but it was
</p>
<p>too late. He followed, however, disconcerted by his
</p>
<p>failure, but not desponding. At the farther end of
</p>
<p>the bridge he was struck with the countenance and
</p>
<p>manner of a fine-looking young man, of genteel but
</p>
<p>plain appearance, who stood gazing earnestly after
</p>
<p>the prisoner and his guard.
</p>
<p>Observing Schwartz, he asked eagerly who the
</p>
<p>prisoner was, and was told it was Captain Douglas.
</p>
<p>"Good God!" exclaimed he, in a tone of deep
</p>
<p>concern; "is it possible? But thank God! it is no
</p>
<p>worse."
</p>
<p>"Did you think it was any body you knew?"
</p>
<p>asked the quick-witted Schwartz.
</p>
<p>"' Yes," replied the other. "I was almost sure it
</p>
<p>was a friend of my own."
</p>
<p>" And what was your friend's name, stranger? if
</p>
<p>I may be so bold."
</p>
<p>" You are bold enough," said the youth. "I am
</p>
<p>not in the habit of answering questions, unless I
</p>
<p>know who asks them, and why."
</p>
<p>"I don't mean no harm, young. man," replied
</p>
<p>Schwartz; " and if you tell me your friend's name
</p>
<p>and your own too, may be you won't be sorry for it."
</p>
<p>The stranger looked hard at Schwartz, and in his
</p>
<p>serious, earnest, and sagacious countenance saw
</p>
<p>enough to make him curious to know what this
</p>
<p>meant. He therefore replied, that his friend was

<p>"Then I have a notion," replied Schwartz, "that

<p>your name is Whiting."

</p>
<p>surprise; " but how should you know it?"
</p>
<p>" I have heard the Captain talk about you man"
</p>
<p>a time."
</p>
<p>"The Captain! What Captain?"
</p>
<p>" Him," replied Schwartz, pointing toward the
</p>
<p>distant party.
</p>
<p>" Him! And how was he to know any thing
</p>
<p>about me."

<p>"' Just because he is the very man you thought he

<p>was."

<p>" Douglas!" exclaimed Whiting. "Trevor!
</p>
<p>Douglas Trevor! Good God, what an ass I have
</p>
<p>been! 0 Trevor, my friend! how earnestly have I
</p>
<p>wished to know where to find you! Had I been
</p>
<p>with you, this might have been prevented."
</p>
<p>"May be it is best as it is," said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>"The Captain did not want for friends where he
</p>
<p>was. May be one friend here will do him more good
</p>
<p>than a hundred any where else. That is what I am

<p>here for now."
</p>
<p>" You are a friend to Trevor, then," replied Whit.

<p>ing; "perhaps one of his followers."
</p>
<p>"You may say that," said Schwartz. "Any
</p>
<p>how, I'm his friend."
</p>
<p>"Then come with me to my lodgings. You can

<p>tell me every thing, and we will see what is to be

</p>
<p>God! I saw him. But for that we might not have
</p>
<p>found out who he was till it was too late."
</p>
<p>Whiting now showed Schwartz where to bestow
</p>
<p>his horse, and afterwards conducted him to his lodgings. These were in an obscure suburb, humble,
</p>
<p>plain, and poorly fitted up. Appearances showed
</p>
<p>that the occupant spent most of his time with the
</p>
<p>pen, although many of the relics of his former mill
</p>
<p>tary equipments were to be seen about the room,
</p>
<p>But the dust on his cap, which hung against the
</p>
<p>wall, and the mould on the belt and scabbard of hiE
</p>
<p>sword, showed that these had been long unused. In
</p>
<p>truth, the escape of Douglas and his uncle had been
</p>
<p>fatal to him as a soldier. He had been dismissed
</p>
<p>the army; and now, as it seemed, earned a poor
</p>
<p>livelihood by doing for small wages the manual
</p>
<p>labor of those offices, the salaries of which are
</p>
<p>received by men who do nothing at all.
</p>
<p>During their long walk through the streets of that
</p>
<p>city " so magnificent in distances," as Monsieur
</p>
<p>Serrurier said of it, and while a hasty breakfast was
</p>
<p>preparing for Schwartz, he gave Whiting the particulars of the late battle at Jones's Ford; of Douglas's
</p>
<p>capture, and of his brother's death, and the surrender of the camp. As soon as he had seen his guest
</p>
<p>provided for, the young mail left him alone. Going
</p>
<p>out, lie proceeded to the first stand of coaches, and
</p>
<p>stepping into one was driven to the Minister's.

<p>Here he alighted, showed a ticket to the porter,

</p>
<p>stair, and, going into a small room in the basement,
</p>
<p>touched the spring of a bell. No answering sound
</p>
<p>was heard; but in half an hour the Minister appeared.
</p>
<p>" I am glad to see you," said he. " Have you
</p>
<p>heard that your friend Trevor is in the power of his
</p>
<p>enemies, and is expected here to-day?"
</p>
<p>" I had not heard it," said Whiting; " but I have
</p>
<p>seen him. He is here."
</p>
<p>"Indeed! That is well. We have the more time."
</p>
<p>"Where will he be lodged, and under what custody?"
</p>
<p>"In the state prison. I am instructed to select
</p>
<p>his guards from among those who are strangers to
</p>
<p>his person, and well-affected to the Government."
</p>
<p>" That will be no easy task, as it seems that all
</p>
<p>the troops of that description have been marched
</p>
<p>into Virginia, and that, except raw recruits, there
</p>
<p>are none here that it was thought safe to trust on
</p>
<p>that service."
</p>
<p>" That is true," said the Minister; " and therefore
</p>
<p>I must select those same raw recruits. Think you
</p>
<p>there are many here who could be relied on to peril
</p>
<p>every thing on behalf of your friend?"
</p>
<p>" No doubt of it. I was long enough in the army
</p>
<p>after his disgrace to know that his whole regiment
</p>
<p>were indignant at it. A hundred can be found

<p>ready to wipe it out with the blood of the President,

<p>About the time that these gentlemen thus separated,
</p>
<p>the President was informed that a gentleman and lady
</p>
<p>craved the favor of a private audience. He directed
</p>
<p>that they should be shown into the room, the privacy
</p>
<p>of which we have so often violated, and soon after he

</p>
<p>entered it.
</p>
<p>388
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>A lady, whose figure and dress denoted youth, was
</p>
<p>seated on the sofa. She was in deep mourning, and
</p>
<p>a black veil completely hid her face. By her side sat
</p>
<p>a gentleman far advanced in life, and of a most venerable aspect. His fair complexion had blanched by
</p>
<p>time into the cold dead whiteness of age. The color
</p>
<p>had, in like manner, faded from his pale blue eye;
</p>
<p>and the quivering of his livid lip, and the trembling
</p>
<p>of his eyelids, betokened deep and anxious distress. His dress also was of black, mournfully
</p>
<p>contrasting with the almost unearthly whiteness of
</p>
<p>his face.
</p>
<p>At the entrance of the President both rose; and
</p>
<p>the trembling and agitated old gentleman might be
</p>
<p>seen to give way for a moment, as if about to throw
</p>
<p>himself on his knees before " the dreaded prince whose
</p>
<p>will was fate." But he recovered himself, and with
</p>
<p>an air of suppliant dignity, stood as erect as the weakness and infirmity of age permitted. The President
</p>
<p>approached him with a look of perplexity and doubt;
</p>
<p>and, gazing earnestly at him, said: "I beg to know,
</p>
<p>sir, who it is. Bless me I Mr. Trevor, is it possible
</p>
<p>that I see you here, at this moment?"
</p>
<p>"I am here, sir," replied the old gentleman, "a
</p>
<p>broken-hearted, bereaved father, lamenting the loss of
</p>
<p>one son, and suppliant for the life of another; and this
</p>
<p>is my niece, who is come to join her prayers to mine,
</p>
<p>on behalf of her betrothed husband."
</p>
<p>There was enough in these words to add to the

</p>
<p>maiden confusion of poor Delia, but not enough to
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>389
</p>
<p>prevent her from lifting a timid glance, in which there
</p>
<p>was as much of entreaty as her proud spirit could
</p>
<p>descend to. She met the eye of the President, as with
</p>
<p>an air of quick and eager surprise he turned towards
</p>
<p>her; and in his eye she read a meaning, which, in the
</p>
<p>moment, blasted her hopes, and confirmed her in all
</p>
<p>her detestation of the cold, selfish, and crafty politi
</p>
<p>cian, whom she now beheld for the first time. She
</p>
<p>saw, instantly, that she was the object of some subtle
</p>
<p>purpose; and felt, that by putting herself in his
</p>
<p>power, she had but prepared for her husband a deeper
</p>
<p>distress than all the severities of the law could inflict.
</p>
<p>But she quailed not at the thought. Her proud and
</p>
<p>bold spirit came in aid of her weakness; her pale
</p>
<p>cheek burnt with an indignant glow, and the tears were
</p>
<p>dissipated from her eyes in the bright and almost
</p>
<p>fierce glance that flashed from them. Even through
</p>
<p>her veil too much of this appeared to escape the notice
</p>
<p>of the President.
</p>
<p>He instantly turned away; and, with an air and
</p>
<p>tone of the most candied courtesy, addressed Mr. Trevor: "You speak in riddles, my dear sir," said he;
</p>
<p>"I beg you to explain."
</p>
<p>"My task is more painful than I had anticipated,"
</p>
<p>said the poor old man. "Have I, then, to be the
</p>
<p>herald of my poor Owen's death, and of the yet more
</p>
<p>disastrous fate of my other noble boy?"
</p>
<p>"Col. Trevor dead, sir I" exclaimed the Presidents
</p>
<p>"Impossible I I have just received a letter from him,

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>" That day was the last of his life," said the afflicted
</p>
<p>father. " He fell next morning. I received the news
</p>
<p>yesterday by the railroad; and by travelling all night
</p>
<p>by the same conveyance, I am here to entreat that the
</p>
<p>axe may not glean what the sword has left me. My
</p>
<p>poor boy Douglas, I am told, is in your power, and
</p>
<p>perhaps here.'
</p>
<p>" I had heard of this; but I assure you your son is
</p>
<p>not here. I will not deny that I expect him; and
</p>
<p>regret that it is under circumstances which will not
</p>
<p>allow me the pleasure of extending to him the same
</p>
<p>courtesy I shall be happy to render to you. Compose
</p>
<p>yourself, my dear sir; let me beg you and your niece
</p>
<p>to retire to rooms which are always ready to receive
</p>
<p>you where I am master; and let me send for your
</p>
<p>baggage."
</p>
<p>Delia, who thought there was something of hesitancy in her uncle's mind, instantly exclaimed: "No,
</p>
<p>my uncle I No, my father I The palace of a tyrant
</p>
<p>is a prison. There is no mercy here. No hope for
</p>
<p>my noble husband. Save yourself. Return home
</p>
<p>while you may, and leave me here to share his fate.
</p>
<p>Our friends may rescue us. They WILL avenge us.
</p>
<p>But in that cold eye there is no relenting."
</p>
<p>"You are harsh, lady," said the President; "I
</p>
<p>will not add, unjust. I will prove that, by permitting
</p>
<p>your instant departure, without even inquiring where
</p>
<p>you lodge."

<p>He now bowed them out, and immediately summoning a servant, said: " Take the number of that coach,
</p>
<p>the Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>391
</p>
<p>and let the driver attend me this evening." Then, as
</p>
<p>the servant left the room, he went on: "Why, this is
</p>
<p>better and better. I think I have holds enough now
</p>
<p>on Baker to bind him to his task, however his heart
</p>
<p>may yearn after his beggarly estate in Virginia. It
</p>
<p>seems, forsooth, that after all that has passed, his son
</p>
<p>yet has a hankering after this girl; the only woman,
</p>
<p>as he says, that he ever truly loved. It may be but
</p>
<p>spite against his favored rival; or it may be, in truth,
</p>
<p>that every thing that bears the shape of man is susceptible of love, or what passes for it. Be it so. He
</p>
<p>may be gratified; but his father shall fulfil conditions."
</p>
<p>In the evening of the same day the following letter
</p>
<p>was put into the hands of the President:
</p>
<p>" Your captive has arrived. Beware how you
</p>
<p>remand him to his prison, when you dismiss him tonight. Order him to be confined within the palace;
</p>
<p>and when you give the order, mark well its effect on
</p>
<p>him you most trust.
</p>
<p>CAUTION."
</p>
<p>" Why, here is proof as well as accusation," said
</p>
<p>the President. "Here is treason. How else is it known
</p>
<p>that Trevor was to be brought here to-night? I will
</p>
<p>improve this hint. A rescue is to be attempted I Is
</p>
<p>that it? Then the guard will be attacked on their
</p>
<p>return without the prisoner. Woe to the traitor if it

<p>prove so I"
