<p>The Great Conspiracy
</p>
<p>By ALEXANDER SZARSKI and FAUST C. DeWALSH, PH. D.
</p>
<p>This is an indictment, charging two European countries, whose territories and
</p>
<p>dominions cover two-thirds of the world, with deliberately and wantonly waging
</p>
<p>a war of conquest, unique in the history of the world ; and with deliberately and
</p>
<p>maliciously exerting their pernicious influence in order to inflict the most terrible
</p>
<p>catastrophe on hundreds of millions of people.
</p>
<p>Public and official documents hereto attached shall prove to the world the justice
</p>
<p>and righteousness of this arraignment.
</p>
<p>In order to expose the vast extent of this conspiracy, it becomes necessary to
</p>
<p>reprint articles, notes and other documents which may seem irrelevant to anyone
</p>
<p>not acquainted with European politics, but which are essential to a full explanation
</p>
<p>of what led Russia and Great Britain to commit this monstrous crime.
</p>
<p>Russia, the world's dungeon ; the land of gloomy despotism and brutal intoler-
</p>
<p>ance ; the country known to past and present history as the charnel-house of nations;
</p>
<p>the land whose entire history and existence is based on barbarism, murder, fraud and
</p>
<p>deception ; the empire whose laws are interpreted by government officials in such a
</p>
<p>way as to permit Jewish women to become residents of cities in which a higher edu-
</p>
<p>cation is obtainable, and from which they are otherwise debarred, by means of
</p>
<p>registering the names of such women in the yellow list of prostitution ; such a coun-
</p>
<p>tr-' has assumed the role of liberating and protecting the peaceful citizens of liberal
</p>
<p>and democratic countries.
</p>
<p>Ivan, the Terrible, the third Russian Czar (Imperator), left a book in which
</p>
<p>he ordered Mass to be read for the repose of the souls of 3,470 persons murdered,
</p>
<p>with his own hands, in the name of the Holy Russian Faith.
</p>
<p>Nicholas II., the present Russian ruler the weak-minded dummy of the so-called
</p>
<p>"Holy Synod" the willing instrument of a perverse and criminal clique of courtiers,

</p>
<p>'IIIE GREAT CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>HOW NICHOLAS' MAFFIA PREPARED THE WAY.
</p>
<p>On March 16, 1913. Alexander Konta
</p>
<p>published In the New York Times
</p>
<p>the following article:
</p>
<p>"Not so very long ago The New
</p>
<p>York Times published a series of
</p>
<p>articles exposing the activities , the
</p>
<p>espionage, oppressions and persecutions
</p>
<p>practiced by the Third Section of the
</p>
<p>Imperial Rusian Police in the United
</p>
<p>States. It show-ed how political refu-
</p>
<p>gees from Czardom were hampered In
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of the rights guarante-
</p>
<p>ed to all law-abiding men by the laws
</p>
<p>of this country; how, in short, under
</p>
<p>the National Government at Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, there has been established here
</p>
<p>a reign of terror, whose official con-
</p>
<p>nection with the Russian Government
</p>
<p>It may be hard to establish, according
</p>
<p>to the rules of legal evidence, but
</p>
<p>whose nature is nevertheless clear to
</p>
<p>all.
</p>
<p>"Russia has, however, as I have had
</p>
<p>occasion to point out ere this in these
</p>
<p>columns, a far more potent agency at
</p>
<p>Its command than its secret police.
</p>
<p>namely, the Orthodox Russian Church,
</p>
<p>whose official and officially declared
</p>
<p>mission it is to convert all Slavs to its
</p>
<p>faith, as an approach to their ultimate
</p>
<p>political union under one head, that of
</p>
<p>the Czar of all the Russias.
</p>
<p>"This Pan-Slavism, religious and po-

<p>litical. Is no doubt a legitimate aspira-
</p>
<p>tion in Europe, where it is counter-
</p>
<p>balanced by the mass-movements of
</p>
<p>other races and monarchies, whose se-
</p>
<p>curity and continued united existence,
</p>
<p>its systematic, steady encroachments
</p>
<p>threaten with internal strife and dis-
</p>
<p>ruption.
</p>
<p>"It is another matter altogether, and
</p>
<p>one that deserves the most serious at-
</p>
<p>tention of all Americans, when the
</p>
<p>propaganda is transferred to this coun-
</p>
<p>try, with the purpose of transforming
</p>
<p>all the Slavs resident here into Rus-
</p>
<p>sians, by means of the Russian Ortho-
</p>
<p>dox Church, It is a deliberate, and
</p>
<p>elaborately organized and financed
</p>
<p>campaign, not only for the conver-
</p>
<p>sion of aliens to a new alien allegiance;
</p>
<p>it is, what is far more serious, a de-
</p>
<p>liberate campaign to prevent them
</p>
<p>from becoming Americanized.
</p>
<p>"The immigration question is much
</p>
<p>to the fore again with us, and no won-
</p>
<p>der. It is confusion so amazingly con-
</p>
<p>founded that none can find the point
</p>
<p>of departure whence better conditions,
</p>
<p>organization and orderly progress can
</p>
<p>most successfully be started. A Con-
</p>
<p>gressional committee sat for several
</p>
<p>years on the subject, and has produced
</p>
<p>as the result of its investigations a
</p>
<p>voluminous report that should prove
</p>
<p>of inestimable service to our legis-
</p>
<p>lators, and to all who have the future
</p>
<p>THE GREAT
</p>
<p>sey City  from time to time, I repeat,
</p>
<p>and with remarkable frequency, the
</p>
<p>news of the day includes a brief story
</p>
<p>of a quarrel in some Slav Church.
</p>
<p>"The dispatches describe these con-
</p>
<p>gregations as Polish, or Ruthenian,
</p>
<p>Hungarian or Slavonic, or what not,
</p>
<p>but the substance is always the same.
</p>
<p>A priest has quarreled with his Bishop,
</p>
<p>has been deposed, and has appealed to
</p>
<p>the courts. Or a congregation has
</p>
<p>locked its spiritual shepherd out of the
</p>
<p>church, and risen in revolt against
</p>
<p>ecclesiastical authority.
</p>
<p>"Owing to unavoidable total ignorance
</p>
<p>of the inside facts, the report as
</p>
<p>printed, has no significance to the
</p>
<p>American reader, who most likely
</p>
<p>scans it indifferently, reflects a moment
</p>
<p>upon the turbulent ways of immigrants
</p>
<p>in religious matters, and the increas-
</p>
<p>ing burden and bother they are to this
</p>
<p>country, and therefore forgets all
</p>
<p>about it. What has really happened
</p>
<p>is that the Russian Orthodox Church
</p>
<p>has succeeded, or perhaps failed for
</p>
<p>the moment, in capturing still another
</p>
<p>congregation, its material investment
</p>
<p>in edifice, charitable work, &c., all
</p>
<p>included.
</p>
<p>"This campaign has been going on
</p>
<p>steadily for many years, in fact ever
</p>
<p>since the sale of Alaska to this coun-
</p>
<p>try, when the Russian Orthodox Bishop

<p>of the territory moved to San Fran-
</p>
<p>cisco, and there discovered, with the
</p>
<p>very active assistance of the Russian
</p>
<p>Ambassador of that time, Count Kotze-
</p>
<p>bue, that here was a wide Slav field
</p>
<p>for his labors. Orthodox Russians
</p>
<p>there were none on the Pacific Coast
</p>
<p>at that time, but there were Slavon-
</p>
<p>ians, Serbs, Ruthenians, all kinds of
</p>
<p>Greek Catholics to be won for the
</p>
<p>Russian Orthodox Church, and a con-
</p>
<p>vert to the Russian Church was then,
</p>
<p>and is now, a convert to the Czar of
</p>
<p>all the Russias.
</p>
<p>What Are "Greek Catholics?"
</p>
<p>"It is necessary here, first of all, to
</p>
<p>explain that 'Greek Catholics' do not
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY 5
</p>
<p>belong to the Eastern but to the West-
</p>
<p>ern Church. Few Americans know this;
</p>
<p>most Russian Catholic laymen, even,
</p>
<p>are Ignorant of the fact. The Russian
</p>
<p>Church takes the titles "Orthodox."
</p>
<p>"Orthodox Greek Russian," "Orthodox
</p>
<p>Eastern," &c., but it never calls itself
</p>
<p>"Greek Catholic," because that implies
</p>
<p>the supreme authority of the Pope.
</p>
<p>"Catholic" officially and historically
</p>
<p>always denotes union with Rome,
</p>
<p>wherefore an Orthodox Russian is as
</p>
<p>much of a schismatic to a Greek Cath-
</p>
<p>olic, be he Hungarian, Ruthenian, Serb,
</p>
<p>or Slavonian, as he is to a Spanish
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic.
</p>
<p>"In Austria-Hungary, where the bulk
</p>
<p>fi
</p>
<p>THE GRRAT CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Ipso facto Latin, i. e., "Polish," Cath-
</p>
<p>olics.
</p>
<p>"In 1907 the Pope put an end to this
</p>
<p>confusion of ideas and its reeults by
</p>
<p>appointing a Greelc Catholic Bishop
</p>
<p>for America, the Right Rev. Soter
</p>
<p>Stephen Ortynski. The chief differences
</p>
<p>between these two branches of thi
</p>
<p>Church of Rome are liturgical. The
</p>
<p>Greek Catholics are Ruthenians, not
</p>
<p>Latin; they use the Julian instead of
</p>
<p>the Gregorian reckoning, wherefore th
</p>
<p>festivals of the Church fall at times
</p>
<p>different from those of the Latin rite,
</p>
<p>but their faith and sacramental aya-
</p>
<p>tem under one supreme head are the
</p>
<p>same. Roman Catholic missionaries
</p>
<p>are expressly forbidden to induce Greek
</p>
<p>Catholics to adopt the Latin rite.
</p>
<p>"However, the Russian Orthodox
</p>
<p>Church continues its propaganda by
</p>
<p>all means at its command, fair or not.
</p>
<p>For instance: Some years ago (in 1907)
</p>
<p>there sprang up in the Ruthenian
</p>
<p>Greek Catholic Church of Saints Peter
</p>
<p>and Paul in Jersey City a faction that
</p>
<p>advocated secession from Catholicity
</p>
<p>and union with Russian Orthodoxy.
</p>
<p>Now, the Ruthenians are racially Little
</p>
<p>Russians. Thus the Ruthenian Greek
</p>
<p>Catholic Church became gradually a
</p>
<p>"Russian Greek Catholic Church," by
</p>
<p>the dropping of the adjective.

</p>
<p>"The new designation was a stealthy
</p>
<p>approach to other changes. No pro-
</p>
<p>test was made  who, indeed, took suf-
</p>
<p>ficient interest in so small a matter as
</p>
<p>the disappearance of a word from so
</p>
<p>long a name? As we have seen, the
</p>
<p>ward "Catholic" is never used by
</p>
<p>the Russian Orthodox Church in Eu-
</p>
<p>rope or Asia, but that body has found
</p>
<p>it a convenient shield for its opera-
</p>
<p>tions in this country. "Russian Greek
</p>
<p>Catholic Church" has a decidedly
</p>
<p>Eastern sound. In this case, however,
</p>
<p>the propaganda failed. The Church of
</p>
<p>Saints Peter and Paul adhered to its
</p>
<p>allegiance, and the schismatics estab-
</p>
<p>lished a congregation of their own.
</p>
<p>"Since the advent of Bishop Ortynski
</p>
<p>the Russian appeals to Old-World ra-
</p>
<p>cial prejudices have been successfully
</p>
<p>counteracted, but still Cardinal Farley,
</p>
<p>for instance, continues to be often
</p>
<p>referred to as a Pole in the attempts
</p>
<p>that go on without cessation to trans-
</p>
<p>form Slavs of the Greek Catholic rite
</p>
<p>Into Russian Orthodox believers.
</p>
<p>"The Ruthenian Bishop, it should be
</p>
<p>added, has been indefatigably active
</p>
<p>in eradicating Old-World prejudices
</p>
<p>and misconceptions under his charge
</p>
<p>and in leading them in every W'ay to-
</p>
<p>ward sound and useful Americanism.
</p>
<p>"Another recent case of Russian Or-
</p>
<p>thodox encroachments upon Greek
</p>
<p>Catholicism is that of the St. Michael's
</p>
<p>THE GREAT
</p>
<p>the United States for this particular
</p>
<p>purpose. Certain it is that there are
</p>
<p>not enough orthodox Russians in this
</p>
<p>country to support the numero.U3
</p>
<p>churches, chapels, missions, and other
</p>
<p>enterprises of their faith here and In
</p>
<p>Canada as well. The immigration from
</p>
<p>Russia is almost exclusively Jewish.
</p>
<p>The Russian Jews, by the way, have
</p>
<p>tales to tell of Russian orthodox
</p>
<p>methods of conversion, as have the
</p>
<p>CONSPiRACV ?
</p>
<p>Protestants there.
</p>
<p>"Our immigration statistics being
</p>
<p>what they are, no figures are available
</p>
<p>to demonstrate how small is the num-
</p>
<p>ber of orthodox Russians now in this
</p>
<p>country, but enough is known of their
</p>
<p>paucity to demonstrate that the estab-
</p>
<p>lishments maintained here in their
</p>
<p>name are out of all proportion to their
</p>
<p>needs, and even to those of purely re-
</p>
<p>ligious propaganda.

<p>9 monasteries and seminaries. 1 orph-
</p>
<p>anage, 1 immigrants' home, a society
</p>
<p>for the propaganda of the orthodox
</p>
<p>faith, and one orthodox aid society.
</p>
<p>"In Canada 27 churches and rectories,
</p>
<p>and 3 chapels.
</p>
<p>"In Alaska, 2 churches and 71 chapels.
</p>
<p>"This establishment is administered
</p>
<p>by 1 archbishop, 2 bishops, 2 archiman-
</p>
<p>drites, 2 abbots, 6 high priests, 119
</p>
<p>priests, 31 priest-monks, 2 monks, 1
</p>
<p>archdeacon, 2 priest-deacons, and 1 dea-
</p>
<p>con. In addition, there are many relig-
</p>
<p>ious teachers and church singers, some
</p>
<p>paid by the Russian Government,
</p>
<p>others from private funds.
</p>
<p>"There is no regular registered church
</p>
<p>membership, because, according to the
</p>
<p>authorities of the Russian Orthodox
</p>
<p>Church in this country, only a small
</p>
<p>number of Russian and Austro-Hun-
</p>
<p>garian immigrants settle here perma-
</p>
<p>nently, but the number of those attend-
</p>
<p>ing the orthodox churches here is put at
</p>
<p>200,000. The proportion of 1 orphanage
</p>
<p>to 162 churches and 85 chapels need
</p>
<p>nol be pointed out. It is statistically
</p>
<p>significant, however.
</p>
<p>IN AMERICA.
</p>
<p>"The Russian Orthodox Christian Im-
</p>
<p>migrant Society, in East Fourtasuth
</p>
<p>Street is, according to the Yearbook,
</p>
<p>supported chiefly by the Russian ortho-
</p>
<p>dox clergy in this country. It also re-
</p>
<p>ceives an annual subsidy from the
</p>
<p>8 THE GREAT
</p>
<p>union with the Latin Church and by
</p>
<p>sectarianism.
</p>
<p>The Real Purpose.
</p>
<p>"Here, then, is the real purpose of all
</p>
<p>this activity confessed with naive
</p>
<p>plainness. Russification is the purpose,
</p>
<p>not Americanizatinn. Russification by
</p>
<p>means of -eligion, especially Russifica-
</p>
<p>tion of the Slavs of Austria-Hungary
</p>
<p>and the Balkans living in this country.
</p>
<p>In fact, Americanization is to be coun-
</p>
<p>teracted in every possible way, it
</p>
<p>seems, since the real service of these
</p>
<p>converts will not lie in their continued
</p>
<p>residence in this country, but in their
</p>
<p>return to tihe rid, where they are to
</p>
<p>swell the numbers and the influence of
</p>
<p>the Panslavist campaign for the west-
</p>
<p>ward extension if Russian power.
</p>
<p>"I quote again from official Russian
</p>
<p>sources in America, this time from the
</p>
<p>organ of the Russian Church, the Rus-
</p>
<p>sian Orthodox American Messenger. At

<p>the dedication exercises of the North

<p>It is also of highest importance,

<p>and the seminarists must bear this
</p>
<p>in mind, by order of their Archbishop,
</p>
<p>that at every mention of the Czar of

<p>all the Russias the word "our" must
</p>
<p>always be employed. His majesty
</p>
<p>must always be called "Protector of

<p>cratic Russian Lord and Emperor."
</p>
<p>Even though there are other Slavic

<p>"Is it any wonder that America's im-

<p>"Russian money is poured out like

<p>water in the Pennsylvania mining re-
</p>
<p>gions, certainly not for religious pur-
</p>
<p>poses at all, but in the bribing of the
</p>
<p>Slav societies, and of Greek Catholic
</p>
<p>priests, in order to tempt them to bring
</p>
<p>their flocks of Hungarian and Austrian
</p>
<p>Slavs, of Ruthenians, Czechs, Serbs,
</p>
<p>Dalmatians, Croats, within the ortho-

<p>glory, the greater strength of the Czar,

<p>for the promotion of Russia's ambitious

<p>plans in Eastern Europe.
</p>
<p>Agents Employed.
</p>
<p>"Wherever there are Russian priests
</p>
<p>In this country they are on the watch
</p>
<p>for intelligent Slav immigrants. These
</p>
<p>are approached, and assisted in every
</p>
<p>way in acquiring the confidence of
</p>
<p>their fellow-Slavs and in making them-
</p>
<p>selves their advisers and leaders.

<p>Money is at their disposal the mo-

<p>birth, but master of the Slovak tongue,
</p>
<p>brought thousands upon thousands of
</p>
<p>Hungarian Greek Catholics into the
</p>
<p>Russian Orthodox Church. So notable
</p>
<p>were his services that he was made

<p>trusted him with their savings, but he
</p>
<p>served his Russian employers faith-
</p>
<p>fully and well. Another agent, a phy-
</p>
<p>sician, has only recently arrived in this
</p>
<p>country. His openly proclaimed mis-
</p>
<p>sion is "to awaken the Slav conscience
</p>
<p>of the Slovaks in this country." The
</p>
<p>fellow should have been excluded when
</p>
<p>he landed; it is not yet too late to de-
</p>
<p>port him. He is hand-in-glove with
</p>
<p>the Russian Orthodox priests in this
</p>
<p>country. He, too, does well his work
</p>
<p>of Russianizing immigrants whom
</p>
<p>this country is endeavoring to Ameri-

<p>canize.
</p>
<p>"As has already been said above, this
</p>
<p>bold Russian campaign on American
</p>
<p>soil began with the purchase of Alaska,
</p>
<p>in 1867, and the transfer of the Rus-
</p>
<p>sian Orthodox Bishop of the territory
</p>
<p>to San Francisco. At that time there
</p>
<p>were no Russian immigrants in this
</p>
<p>country, but the Bishop found in Cali-
</p>
<p>fornia great numbers of Austrian Slavs,
</p>
<p>especially Dalmatians and Croats, who
</p>
<p>were employed either in gold mining or
</p>
<p>in the shipping of the coast. Knowing
</p>
<p>no English, and having no churches of
</p>
<p>their own, these people were prac-
</p>
<p>tically excluded from all religious life.

<p>"The good, orthodox Russian Bishop,
</p>
<p>to whom we may well ascribe the high-

<p>A Comparison.
</p>
<p>"To bring the meaning of this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy against Americanism still closer
</p>
<p>to the reader, a comparison may be
</p>
<p>made:
</p>
<p>Let us suppose that England were
</p>
<p>engaged at the present moment in sup-
</p>
<p>pressing Catholicism in Ireland with
</p>
<p>Are and sword, incarcerating those who
</p>
<p>refused to go over to the Church of
</p>
<p>England, and exiling them to some dis-
</p>
<p>tant colony as inhospitable as Siberia.
</p>
<p>Let us further suppose that the British
</p>
<p>Government, not content with these
</p>
<p>persecutions in Ireland itself, also sent
</p>
<p>missionaries, secret agents, and propa-
</p>
<p>gandists to this country, in order to
</p>
<p>take away from the Irish here the
</p>
<p>churches they have built, convert them
</p>
<p>into houses of Anglican worship, at the
</p>
<p>same time seeking to make them dis-
</p>
<p>loyal to the United States by persuad-
</p>
<p>ing them that the King of England is
</p>
<p>the only ruler to whom they owe alle-

</p>
<p>THE ARCHBISHOP AS POLITICAL AGENT.
</p>
<p>Archbishop Rozdestwenskij (Platen),
</p>
<p>who plays such an important part in
</p>
<p>the article of the "New York Times,"
</p>
<p>was before coming to this country as
</p>
<p>chief of the Russian conspiracy a
</p>
<p>member of the Second Duma and a
</p>
<p>leader of the well-known organization
</p>
<p>of the "Black Hundred." To his and
</p>
<p>his associates' evil influence it is due
</p>
<p>that every aspiration for justice and
</p>
<p>liberty in the so-called Russian Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment was crushed from the start; that
</p>
<p>every manifestation of independence
</p>
<p>was penalized, and the voice of the
</p>
<p>people silenced. It was the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion of the "Black Hundred" which
</p>
<p>caused the dispersion of the Second
</p>
<p>Duma; the imprisonment of the signers
</p>
<p>of the Viborg manifesto; the murder of
</p>
<p>the Jewish Duma-deputies, Professor
</p>
<p>Herzenstein and M. Yollos; and which
</p>
<p>Inaugurated pogroms by arousing the
</p>
<p>passions of the ignorant Russian mob
</p>
<p>against liberal and intelligent people.

</p>
<p>eyes to the cruel slaughter of Russian
</p>
<p>martyrs.
</p>
<p>The time is coming when Russians
</p>
<p>will refuse to bear these hardships
</p>
<p>which are a disgrace to modern civili-
</p>
<p>zation; the time is coming when Rus-
</p>
<p>sians will bid Austria "STOP."
</p>
<p>Even now the outrages committed
</p>
<p>upon Russians in Austria are arousing
</p>
<p>a storm of protest throughout the vast
</p>
<p>Russian Empire.
</p>
<p>And until that time shall come we

<p>trian government continues to regard
</p>
<p>the conversion of our beloved Galician
</p>
<p>and Hungarian Russians to the faith
</p>
<p>of their ancestors as a capital crime
</p>
<p>and as high treason, to be punished

<p>with utmost severity. And so it is
</p>
<p>Austria's endeavor to use all means at
</p>
<p>her command in extinguishing the
</p>
<p>bright light of orthodox faith among
</p>
<p>the miserable children of holy Russia,

<p>living in foreign slavery.

<p>Newspapers inform us that the Rev-

<p>America, far away from the martyrs

<p>for Russian faith, he wept bitter tears
</p>
<p>whenever the sad news reached him
</p>
<p>from home. Unable to endure this con-
</p>
<p>dition any longer, and moved with pity
</p>
<p>for the martyrs at home, he sailed for
</p>
<p>Austria where he was at once put in
</p>
<p>prison which is overcrowded with
</p>
<p>martyrs for the cause of our orthodox
</p>
<p>faith martyrs who are jeered at in
</p>
<p>their homes, in the street and even in
</p>
<p>church, and who cannot spend one day
</p>
<p>without being subjected to domiciliary
</p>
<p>visits, arrest and severe punishment.
</p>
<p>Forsaken, like sheep without a shep-

<p>THE GREAT
</p>
<p>trouble among the Russians in Galicia
</p>
<p>and Hungary, our friends there have
</p>
<p>now, in three successive years, been
</p>
<p>the victims of elementary catastro-
</p>
<p>phies. In 1911, the crops were bad;
</p>
<p>last year, heavy rainfalls interfered
</p>
<p>with the harvest; this year, the coun-
</p>
<p>try is visited by unheard-of floods;
</p>
<p>and so the Russian population of Ga-
</p>
<p>licia and Hungary is ruined and mis-
</p>
<p>erable. Starvation is the outlook. And,
</p>
<p>In addition to being persecuted for
</p>
<p>their faith, our brothers now find
</p>
<p>themselves deprived of their last piece
</p>
<p>of bread a truly unbearable condition
</p>
<p>to all sincere hearts!
</p>
<p>My beloved orthodox Russians in
</p>
<p>America: do you hear the lamentations
</p>
<p>of your brothers at home? Do not
</p>
<p>your hearts bleed and pain as you re-
</p>
<p>ceive this news of your martyrized
</p>
<p>kindred? If you hear all this, why do
</p>
<p>you not hasten to their assistance?
</p>
<p>Three m.onths ago I appealed to your
</p>
<p>charitable Russian hearts, my Beloved,
</p>
<p>and I also forwarded my contribution,
</p>
<p>so as to start a general auxiliary fund.
</p>
<p>What, now, has happened since? The
</p>
<p>clergy contributed a small sum; so
</p>
<p>did also some laymen. And the total
</p>
<p>amount raised is $400. This sum rep-
</p>
<p>resents a collection made among all

</p>
<p>lose courage, is it not? Better no gift
</p>
<p>at all than such an offer to those in
</p>
<p>need of our help. Would it not mean
</p>
<p>to give them stones instead of bread?
</p>
<p>There are among our people in this
</p>
<p>country many who command wealth,
</p>
<p>and who are not miserly; but so far 1

<p>have not heard their answer to the

<p>our papers one single gift of which

<p>one might say: "He gave it to God

<p>THE CONSPIRACY IN EUROPE.
</p>
<p>The same Russianizing tendencies,
</p>
<p>exposed by Mr. Konta in the "New

<p>York Times," have been the source of
</p>
<p>constant trouble in some parts of Aus-

<p>The great undermining work carried

<p>ern parts of the Ruthenian territory in
</p>
<p>Austria-Hungary, which appeared in
</p>
<p>March, 1914, contains so much valuable
</p>
<p>information and documentary evidence,
</p>
<p>that a reprint of certain portions there-
</p>
<p>of seems well worth while.
</p>
<p>However, before quoting the details
</p>
<p>of the Russian plot as set forth by M.
</p>
<p>Stepankowsky, it becomes necessary to
</p>
<p>acquaint the American public with
</p>
<p>Ruthenian (Ukrainian) history, so far
</p>
<p>as It concerns the present issue.
</p>
<p>The Ruthenian people number at
</p>
<p>present 40,000,000 souls, among them
</p>
<p>35,000,000 Russian subjects. The ter-
</p>
<p>ritory populated by them, Ukraine, is
</p>
<p>one of the richest regions of -the world,
</p>
<p>and the natural capacities of these
</p>
<p>people are well recognized. Their
</p>
<p>country is the grainery of all of East-
</p>
<p>ern Europe; it holds the key to the
</p>
<p>Black Sea and the most important
</p>
<p>ports in the Russian Empire. Three
</p>
<p>million five hundred thousand Ruthen-
</p>
<p>ians live in the eastern part of Galicia
</p>
<p>and in Bukovina, while about 500,000 are
</p>
<p>Hungarian citizens inhabiting the Car-
</p>
<p>pathian mountain districts in the
</p>
<p>northeast of Hungary.
</p>
<p>The following is a brief resumfe of
</p>
<p>Ruthenian history:
</p>
<p>The ancient kingdom of Little-Russia
</p>
<p>(Ruthenia), situated on both sides of
</p>
<p>the River Dnieper, between the Car-
</p>
<p>pathians and the River Don, with Kiev
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>THE GREAT CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>formed an alliance with the then quite
</p>
<p>Insignificant Principality of Moscow.
</p>
<p>Though this agreement which was
</p>
<p>signed at Perejaslaw, near Kiev, in
</p>
<p>1644, guaranteed Ruthenian national
</p>
<p>Independence, the Muscovites com-
</p>
<p>pletely subdued the Ruthenian people
</p>
<p>In the early part of the eighteenth cen-
</p>
<p>tury. Their autonomous national in-
</p>
<p>stitutions were abolished; their lan-
</p>
<p>guage suppressed; and, in the nine-
</p>
<p>teenth century, they were forced lo
</p>
<p>Join the Orthodox Church.
</p>
<p>The condition of Ruthenians in Aus-
</p>
<p>tria was altogether different. The
</p>
<p>8,500,000 Galician Ruthenians, who after
</p>
<p>the division of Poland became Aus-
</p>
<p>trian subjects, were permitted not only
</p>
<p>to develop as a nation, but also to take
</p>
<p>an active interest in Austrian politics.
</p>
<p>They were granted suffrage; compul-
</p>
<p>sory education in the Ruthenian lan-
</p>
<p>guage was introduced; and Ruthen-
</p>
<p>ians were appointed to political and
</p>
<p>judicial offices wherever the Ruthenian
</p>
<p>element predominated.
</p>
<p>These privileges accorded by Austria
</p>
<p>to Ruthenians were regarded by Rus-
</p>
<p>sian oppressors as a menace to the
</p>
<p>barbarian methods applied by them to
</p>
<p>35,000,000 Ruthenians in Russia. To
</p>
<p>prevent a national revival of Ruthen-

<p>the present conflict for which Russia is
</p>
<p>responsible.
</p>
<p>Concerning the details of the Russian

<p>plot M. Stepankowsky says:
</p>
<p>The Russians are determined to add
</p>
<p>the Ruthenian provinces of Austria-
</p>
<p>Hungary to their own Ruthenian pos-
</p>
<p>sessions.
</p>
<p>The decision to that effect was prob-
</p>
<p>ably formed in St. Petersburg during
</p>
<p>the second half of the last century,
</p>
<p>when the Ruthenian national revival
</p>
<p>became first vigorous.
</p>
<p>It was, however, strongly disapprov-
</p>
<p>ed of by General Kuropatkin, who,
</p>
<p>when Minister of War, in 1900, express-
</p>
<p>ed himself thus, in his secret report
</p>
<p>to the Czar:
</p>
<p>"Galicia has grown up into a splen-
</p>
<p>didly entrenched camp, connected to
</p>
<p>other provinces of Austria-Hungary by
</p>
<p>numerous roads across the Carpathians.
</p>
<p> . . . The Austrian War Depart-
</p>
<p>ment has succeeded in working won-
</p>
<p>ders in preparing the probable area of
</p>
<p>operations on our side for both attack
</p>
<p>and defense. If we were successful in
</p>
<p>war against Austria-Hungary .
</p>
<p>there would then recur the cry for the
</p>
<p>"rectification" of the frontier. The
</p>
<p>Carpathian mountains seem formed by
</p>
<p>nature for a boundary so that the
</p>
<p>whole of Galicia might become part of

<p>THE GREAT CONSPIRACY

</p>
<p>height. Since then, however, his fame
</p>
<p>suffered much lamentable reverses that
</p>
<p>his words of warning lost all their
</p>
<p>weight with the Russian Nationalist-
</p>
<p>politicians.
</p>
<p>On the other hand the National
</p>
<p>Movement among the Ruthenians grew
</p>
<p>so strong that the St. Petersburg
</p>
<p>authoritative circles far from relaxing
</p>
<p>In their ambitious designs, decided to
</p>
<p>try and infuse a new life into the
</p>
<p>somewhat amateurish intrigue that
</p>
<p>was started in Galicia during the
</p>
<p>eighties by various Russian politicians.
</p>
<p>Count V. Bobrinski, a member of the
</p>
<p>Duma and the leader of the Russian
</p>
<p>Nationalist Party, was now selected to
</p>
<p>conduct the campaign. A descendant
</p>
<p>of Catherine the Great, a man closely
</p>
<p>related to the Russian Court, an am-
</p>
<p>bitious personality  he seemed "just
</p>
<p>the man for the job."
</p>
<p>"The Bobrinski Campaign," as It
</p>
<p>came to be known after, began with
</p>
<p>the convocation of the Pan-Slav Con-
</p>
<p>gress in Prague, Bohemia. Although,
</p>
<p>oddly enough the only language in
</p>
<p>which the delegates of the brotherly
</p>
<p>Slav nationalities were able to deliber-
</p>
<p>ate, was found to be German; the
</p>
<p>speeches made were violently pro-
</p>
<p>Russian and anti-Austrian. As might
</p>
<p>have been expected, Russia was de-

<p>clared to be the "protector of the
</p>
<p>Slavonic nations. Their gruesome fate
</p>
<p>I need not say, was not alluded to.
</p>
<p>The Congress took place in 1908, and
</p>
<p>Count V. Bobrinski one of its chief
</p>
<p>organizers, after its termination, re-
</p>
<p>paired to Galicia, where he tried to
</p>
<p>make concrete the principles proclaim-
</p>
<p>ed in Prague.
</p>
<p>Amply supplied with funds, the Rus-
</p>
<p>sian emissary founded two journals in
</p>
<p>Lemberg, the capital of Austrian
</p>
<p>Ruthenia. The object of these was to
</p>
<p>do the spade work of the campaign.
</p>
<p>As the population were not sufficiently
</p>
<p>interested in the contents of the per-
</p>
<p>iodicals to purchase them, they were
</p>
<p>distributed gratuitously.
</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Count V. Bobrinski
</p>
<p>undertook to canvas every place of
</p>
<p>importance in Galicia, East Hungary
</p>
<p>and Bukovina, with the view of mak-
</p>
<p>ing inflammatory speeches against Aus-
</p>
<p>tria, and trying to influence the popu-
</p>
<p>lation in Russia's favor.
</p>
<p>For some time the local Austrian
</p>
<p>officials ignored this propaganda: being
</p>
<p>mostly Poles, they had reasons of
</p>
<p>their own for not appearing to take it
</p>
<p>seriously. Count Bobrinski's activities,
</p>
<p>however, aroused the hostility of the
</p>
<p>Ruthenians themselves, and at their
</p>
<p>request he was at last expelled by the
</p>
<p>authorities. His departure was expe-
</p>
<p>dited by a shower of rotten eggs and

<p>tentatives put forward by the Rus-
</p>
<p>sians. That they proved effective, was
</p>
<p>shown on innumerable occasions by
</p>
<p>the Russian, Austrian, German and
</p>
<p>French press.
</p>
<p>The expulsion of Count V. Bobrinski
</p>
<p>from Austria, far from arresting his
</p>
<p>dangerous activities, marked the real
</p>
<p>beginning of the campaign. The Count
</p>
<p>returned home armed with first-hand
</p>
<p>information concerning the conditions
</p>
<p>prevailing in the Austro-Hungarian
</p>
<p>Ruthenia, which was much more im-
</p>
<p>portant than the theoretical knowledge
</p>
<p>possessed by the Russian politicians
</p>
<p>hitherto. He at once proceeded to
</p>
<p>form "The Russo-Galician Society" in
</p>
<p>St. Petersburg, the aim of which was
</p>
<p>to establish a Russian base for the
</p>
<p>operations; until then wanting. In
</p>
<p>Galicia itself it was decided to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed with the work cautiously and
</p>
<p>without noise.
</p>
<p>While it was left to the two Lem-
</p>
<p>berg journals to discredit systematical-
</p>
<p>ly, in the eyes of the reading public,
</p>
<p>the foreign policy of Austria, by ap-
</p>
<p>plying to it the Muscovite "Pan-Slav"

</p>
<p>the illiterate peasants was concealed
</p>
<p>under a religious cloak.

<p>once spread over a much larger portion
</p>
<p>of the native territory than Galicia

<p>and Eastern Hungary to which it is

<p>confined now, but has since been bru-
</p>
<p>tally exterminated in Russia, and re-
</p>
<p>placed by the Russian official Religion.

<p>The history of Ruthenian "Unia," this
</p>
<p>undoubtedly most striking attempt
</p>
<p>to bring about the union of the Eastern
</p>
<p>and Western Christianity, is full of
</p>
<p>absorbing interest, and it accredits the
</p>
<p>Ruthenians with one more spiritual
</p>
<p>achievement of world-wide import. In
</p>
<p>addition to their splendid work in
</p>
<p>other directions.
</p>
<p>The Ruthenian Greek-Church, al-
</p>
<p>though it employs, in common with the

<p>Orthodox, the Eastern Rite, in dogma

<p>is at one with the Church of Rome;
</p>
<p>in fact, it constitutes the "golden
</p>
<p>mean" between the two churches: it
</p>
<p>preserves the marriage of the clergy,
</p>
<p>yet is subject to the Pope.
</p>
<p>As the majority of the Ruthenians
</p>
<p>in Austria-Hungary some eighty per
</p>
<p>cent, of them  are peasants, it is the
</p>
<p>ritual side, not the dogmatic that fre-
</p>
<p>quently matters most. Count V. Bo-
</p>
<p>brinski and his colleagues took this
</p>
<p>circumstance fully into account and
</p>
<p>conceived a scheme for disguising their
</p>
<p>political aims under the form of prose-

<p>lytizing, on behalf of the Russian

<p>Bobrinski, proclaimed himself the
</p>
<p>Orthodox Bishop of Galicia, and took
</p>
<p>good care that the converts were well
</p>
<p>supplied with Russian priests. Galic-
</p>
<p>ians were entitled to an Orthodox priest
</p>
<p> all to themselves. Galician youths
</p>
<p>were taken abroad, and gratuitously
</p>
<p>trained, under Russian supervision, for
</p>
<p>the priesthood. Churches were built
</p>
<p>by Russian moneys. Their children
</p>
<p>during their school years were offered
</p>
<p>free board and lodging in specially
</p>
<p>established Russian hostels in Galicia.
</p>
<p>A brood of national renegades, in-
</p>
<p>structed in Russian official religion and
</p>
<p>stuffed with its political teaching, was
</p>
<p>carefully reared.
</p>
<p>The Russian Rouble was made an
</p>
<p>efficient bearer of the popularity of the
</p>
<p>ruler, whose image was struck upon it.
</p>
<p>The illiterate peasants of the Carpa-

<p>thian Highlands were taught that the

<p>portrait on the coins was that of the

<p>Ruthenian Tzar  the Head of the Ortho-

<p>spread by the Russian "missionaries"
</p>
<p>the prayer for the Tzar, his family,
</p>
<p>army, and the State, occupied a promi-
</p>
<p>nent place. To make this "religious
</p>
<p>propaganda" at all effective, the Rus-

<p>sians studiously concealed the fact that

<p>there existed great dissatisfaction

<p>doxy. They also avoided mention of
</p>
<p>the persecution the Ruthenians had to
</p>
<p>endure in Russia from the national
</p>
<p>point of view.
</p>
<p>The sale of Russian prayer books, as
</p>
<p>well as any other help to the spread of
</p>
<p>the Russian Church, was made very
</p>
<p>remunerative. In fact, as was disclosed
</p>
<p>during the recent trial in Hungary*,
</p>
<p>The so-called "Ruthenian Treason
</p>
<p>Trial" (commented on December 29,
</p>
<p>1913, and ended March 3, 1914) of the
</p>
<p>eighty victims of the Russian proga-

<p>ganda. No fewer than 247 witnessea

<p>there were hardly any "conversions"

<p>at all that were not due to pecuniary

<p>considerations of some sort of other.
</p>
<p>Pilgrimages (subsidized by Russia) to

<p>the Holy places in the Empire, were
</p>
<p>one of the methods for bringing the

<p>Galician recruits of Russia into per-

<p>movement.**
</p>
<p>The method described above that of

<p>"religious propaganda," as before men-

<p>tioned, was intended exclusively for the

<p>Illiterate, who could be deceived by the

<p>externals, while overlooking the sub-

<p>stance. For the people who could not

<p>be led astray by so thin a disguise, yet,

</p>
<p>THE GREAT CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>So far in this little exposition of Rus-
</p>
<p>sian campaign we have only scratched
</p>
<p>the surface. Both the "Orthodox mis-
</p>
<p>sionary" propaganda and the frankly
</p>
<p>political "Pan-Slav" agitation of the
</p>
<p>two Bobrinski journals were but two
</p>
<p>air-shafts, by which the secret Russian
</p>
<p>political intrigue could ventilate its de-
</p>
<p>sign. Beneath the surface of things
</p>
<p>there existed a much more serious
</p>
<p>machinery. A regular conspiracy for
</p>
<p>the overthrow of the Austro-Hungarian
</p>
<p>rule in Galicia and converting it into a
</p>
<p>Russian "Government," was actively
</p>
<p>at work.
</p>
<p>A certain Yantchevetski, sent to
</p>
<p>Lemberg from St. Petersburg, super-
</p>
<p>intended the secret operations on the
</p>
<p>spot; at the same time, the ground
</p>
<p>was carefully prepared for clever inter-
</p>
<p>national move. While Count V. Bo-
</p>
<p>brinski continued to be responsible for
</p>
<p>the general management of the affair,
</p>
<p>his link with the Government and the
</p>
<p>"secret fund" became even more inti-
</p>
<p>mate than hitherto. The entire Nation-
</p>
<p>alist Press was now at his disposal.
</p>
<p>Some account of the huge sums of
</p>
<p>money expended by him upon the Gali-
</p>
<p>cian undertaking, was given sporadical-
</p>
<p>ly by the Russian, German, Austrian,
</p>
<p>and English Press***.

</p>
<p>sentativ  of Count V. Bobrinski in Gal-
</p>
<p>icia, deserves a few words to himself.
</p>
<p>He received his political training In
</p>
<p>Persia, during the period of the Ru.s-
</p>
<p>sian activities there, which was termin-
</p>
<p>ated by the bombardment of the Per-
</p>
<p>sian Parliament. M. Yantchevetskl's
</p>
<p>official capacity in Persia was that of
</p>
<p>correspondent to the St. Petersburg
</p>
<p>"Novoe Vremya." In the same capa-
</p>
<p>city he arrived in 1910 in Lemberg,
</p>
<p>where the present writer had an op-
</p>
<p>portunity of observing that gentleman's
</p>
<p>"journalistic" occupation. Without
</p>
<p>going into further detail, it may be
</p>
<p>sufficient to mention that people are
</p>
<p>known to the writer personally, whom
</p>
<p>the Russian Nationalist agent tried to
</p>
<p>bribe into the service of the Galician
</p>
<p>plot by offers of large sums of money.
</p>
<p>As disclosed by a few chance arrests
</p>
<p>effected during 1911 in Lemberg,* a vast
</p>
<p>secret organization for photographing
</p>
<p>fortresses, bridges and roadways, as
</p>
<p>well as for collecting any other useful
</p>
<p>military information existed in the
</p>
<p>Austrian part of Ruthenia. This
</p>
<p>organization formed as it were a back
</p>
<p>room of the Russian Orthodox Mis-
</p>
<p>sionary Show. When its roots and
</p>
<p>ramifications were pursued, it was
</p>
<p>found to be minutely regulated and
</p>
<p>directly guided from St. Petersburg.
</p>
<p>Its inner connection with "The Russo-
</p>
<p>Galician Society" was beyond doubt,
</p>
<p>The great conspiracy
</p>
<p>abroad, and a cry pierced the political
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>air of Europe a shriek complaining of
</p>
<p>"Religrious Persecution in Galicia."
</p>
<p>The first clarion to resound that cry
</p>
<p>was the London "Times." In its col-
</p>
<p>umns appeared a long letter of Count
</p>
<p>Bobrlnski himself, 4: who in a masterly
</p>
<p>fashion approached the British want
</p>
<p>of knowledge in everything pertaining
</p>
<p>to the history and the actual position
</p>
<p>of the East of Europe. The Count
</p>
<p>spoke of "Russian peasants in Gali-
</p>
<p>cia"; he asserted that Galicia played a
</p>
<p>prominent part in the early Muscovite
</p>
<p>history, and he substituted "Russian"
</p>
<p>for "Ruthenian" as much and as often
</p>
<p>as he liked. He felt that nobody would
</p>
<p>question his accuracy in England. The
</p>
<p>statements he made were the wildest
</p>
<p>ever flung into the face of a deluded
</p>
<p>public. But the main contention of
</p>
<p>the conductor of the Russo-Galician
</p>
<p>plot was to convince the British pub-
</p>
<p>lic that a dreadful persecution of the
</p>
<p>Russian (!) co-nationals and the Or-
</p>
<p>thodox faith was taking place in Aus-
</p>
<p>tria, and that Russian intervention, if
</p>
<p>not absolutely imminent, could not be
</p>
<p>withheld long. The Russian feeling
</p>
<p>was outraged; Austria was worse than
</p>
<p>Turkey; the position of Galicia was
</p>
<p>nearly as bad as that of Macedonia,
</p>
<p>etc,, ad nauseam. Other newspapers

<p>in England and France gave a wide
</p>
<p>circulation to the Russian misstate-
</p>
<p>ments, and the Western World was
</p>
<p>expected to swallow a numbe'r of most
</p>
<p>atrocious lies. Were the Russian con-
</p>
<p>spirators successful in imposing their
</p>
<p>misrepresentations upon the public
</p>
<p>mind? They were. They succeeded in
</p>
<p>so completely mesmerizing the English
</p>
<p>and French press that when a few
</p>
<p>weeks later the Ruthenians protested
</p>
<p>against the Russian falsehoods, these
</p>
<p>were supported by the Russian jour-
</p>
<p>nalistic friends abroad.
</p>
<p>An Englishman went specially to
</p>
<p>Galicia, where he visited, in company
</p>
<p>with the agents of Count Bobrinski,
</p>
<p>the places affected by the Russian agi-
</p>
<p>tation; he issued a pamphlet on his
</p>
<p>return to England, in which he faith-
</p>
<p>fully supported his Russian friends.**
</p>
<p>Simultaneously in France, the same
</p>
<p>misrepresentations gained credence.
</p>
<p>In Germany alone, where the knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of Russian and Ruthenian affairs
</p>
<p>was incomparably more thorough than
</p>
<p>in the West, a fairly correct view of
</p>
<p>the whole affair was taken.
</p>
<p>Further attempts on the part of
</p>
<p>Ruthenians to protest against the Rus-
</p>
<p>sian impositions, met with a hostile re-
</p>
<p>ception in the press of the Western
</p>
<p>countries; this was already sufficiently
</p>
<p>attuned to the requirements of the

<p>thusiasm for tlie "War of Liberation
</p>
<p>of Galicia," the secret agents of Count
</p>
<p>Bobrinski in Austrian Ruthenia under

<p>protection of the Poles worked fever-
</p>
<p>ishly preparing for the Russian occu-
</p>
<p>pation.
</p>
<p>We do not speak of such trivial
</p>
<p>things as spies; these have since long
</p>
<p>become a common occurrence in Gali-
</p>
<p>cia. Even though their number was
</p>
<p>now increased enormously, it created
</p>
<p>very little excitement among the well-
</p>
<p>versed Galicians. The general bolster-
</p>
<p>ing up of Russian work during the
</p>
<p>war rumors, however, was marked X>y
</p>
<p>some new and extremely interesting
</p>
<p>features.
</p>
<p>Nearly every village of Galicia, Buko-

<p>vlna and Eastern Hungary, was hon-
</p>
<p>ored by mysterious visitors, who whis-
</p>
<p>pered to the peasants that invasion by
</p>
<p>the "Ruthenian" Tzar w^as imminent.
</p>
<p>The population was invited to meet
</p>
<p>the invader with signs of honor. The
</p>
<p>invader, it was assured, would take all
</p>
<p>the land from the landlords, and give
</p>
<p>It to the peasants. They would be al-
</p>
<p>lowed to destroy all the Jews "as op-
</p>
<p>pressors of the people." The "Ruthe-
</p>
<p>nian" Tzar was an anti-Jewish, pro-
</p>
<p>peasant, ruler.*

</p>
<p>pay debts to the Jews, and of minia-
</p>
<p>ture "pogroms" were recorded almost
</p>
<p>every day by the press.
</p>
<p>The organized Russian alarms took
</p>
<p>many different forms. Thus, to re-

<p>member one more that was fairly com-
</p>
<p>mon in those days when the outbreak
</p>
<p>of hostilities was believed to be pos-
</p>
<p>sible almost at any moment, the Rus-
</p>
<p>sian agents told the peasants that the
</p>
<p>Austrian Emperor had decided to aban-
</p>
<p>don Galicia to its fate, and was not

<p>going to defend the population against

<p>the enemy. The conclusion that was

<p>selves up body and soul to the Rus-

<p>sians when they arrived.
</p>
<p>The acute tension of 1912-1913 has
</p>
<p>passed, but the pressure of the Rus-
</p>
<p>sian conspiracy upon the Austrian Ru-
</p>
<p>thenians has not been relieved. The
</p>
<p>solemn declaration of the Ruthenian
</p>
<p>Political Council which took place at
</p>
<p>the height of the crisis, to the effect
</p>
<p>that they were determined to stand
</p>
<p>firmly by the side of Austria as the
</p>
<p>Power where their national aspirations
</p>
<p>were benevolently treated, hopelessly
</p>
<p>stuck in the ears of the Russians, who

<p>clamored for Galicia with an increas-

<p>were given to substantiate the asser-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>While the Kaiser was approached
</p>
<p>and entreated to intervene in favor of
</p>
<p>an anti-Ruthenian policy by Austria,
</p>
<p>as far back as summer of 1912, and
</p>
<p>this question was said to have formed
</p>
<p>the subject of the famous autograph
</p>
<p>correspondence between the Tzar and
</p>
<p>the Emperor of Austria in January,
</p>
<p>1913, M. Shebeko, the Russian ambas-
</p>
<p>sador at Vienna, appointed there last
</p>
<p>year, seemed to have been charged
</p>
<p>with a special mission of bringing
</p>
<p>about the change in the Austrian pol-
</p>
<p>icy regarding the Ruthenian National
</p>
<p>Revival. The crushing out of the
</p>
<p>Movement was named as the price of
</p>
<p>Russo-Austrian rapprochement. To

<p>facilitate the task of M. Shebeko, the

<p>Russian hirelings in the Western

<p>European press with a renewed vigor,
</p>
<p>perpetrated the Russian concoctions
</p>
<p>concerning the history and the present

<p>state of the Austrian Ruthenia. With
</p>
<p>the usual hypocrisy this was described
</p>
<p>as a country which once formed a part
</p>
<p>of the Russian Empire, and- was to
</p>
<p>this day populated by a branch of
</p>
<p>"Russian" people.

<p>find their way into the press.
</p>
<p>Certain facts, however, could not be
</p>
<p>concealed, and it is generally known
</p>
<p>now that Russian Nationalism has em-
</p>
<p>barked upon an extensive military pro-
</p>
<p>gram to be concluded in August, 1917.
</p>
<p>The realization of this program, made
</p>
<p>possible through the financial aid of
</p>
<p>France, is expected to enable Russia to
</p>
<p>carry a successful offensive into the
</p>
<p>territory of her western neighbors.
</p>
<p>No, there is little doubt which of the
</p>
<p>three western neighbors of Russia is
</p>
<p>especially aimed at.
</p>
<p>Although Russian hostility towards
</p>
<p>the Swedes is contestable, it is not
</p>
<p>they, nor the Germans, that are the
</p>
<p>main object of the Russian military
</p>
<p>preparations.
</p>
<p>The disposition of the troops, and
</p>
<p>the direction of the new lines of rail-
</p>
<p>ways, feverishly constructed, make it
</p>
<p>an open secret that Russia contem-
</p>
<p>plates an attack upon the Empire of
</p>
<p>the Hapsburgs, namely, that part of
</p>
<p>it which is populated by the Ruthen-
</p>
<p>ians Galicia, Bukovina, and Eastern

<p>The territory of Ruthenia, in Austria

<p>thoroughly that she would be prevent-

<p>ed from assisting her ally, an oppor-
</p>
<p>tune moment for a war with Austria
</p>
<p>would arrive. Although risking her

<p>own integrity, Russia might try, with
</p>
<p>about 50% of chances for success, to
</p>
<p>wring from Austria those provinces,
</p>
<p>further political development of which
</p>
<p>would threaten the hegemony of the
</p>
<p>Muscovite race.
</p>
<p>It is quite clear that things are de-
</p>
<p>veloping in that direction. The Lon-
</p>
<p>don "Times" two years ago said that
</p>
<p>the Ruthenian question was, at least
</p>
<p>potentially, one of the gravest ques-
</p>
<p>tions of Europe. And Mr. H. Steed, the
</p>
<p>author of a recent book upon the
</p>
<p>Austro-Hungarian politics, expressed
</p>
<p>the opinion that the Ruthenian ques-
</p>
<p>tion may involve Austria-Hungary and
</p>
<p>Russia in a struggle, even if it does
</p>
<p>not precipitate a general European
</p>
<p>conflagration. Mr. Steed only reiter-

<p>ated what has been for years a com-
</p>
<p>mon belief in Ruthenia itself, where
</p>
<p>the grave developments, to this day
</p>
<p>not fully realized in the west, were
</p>
<p>perfectly visible.*

<p>gradual loss of influence in Galicia
</p>
<p>will compel them to consider whether
</p>
<p>their interests are as identical with
</p>
<p>those of Austria, as they have hither-
</p>
<p>to supposed. On the other hand, it
</p>
<p>is a question whether Russia would
</p>
<p>be indifferent to the growth of Ruth-
</p>
<p>enian influence and to the develop-
</p>
<p>ment of Eastern Galicia into the
</p>
<p>nucleus for a future 'Ukraine' State.
</p>
<p>A completely Ruthenian University
</p>
<p>and a completely Ruthenian Diet
</p>
<p>might become centers of attraction
</p>
<p>for the Ruthenians, or Little Rus-
</p>
<p>sians of Russia. The Poles believe
</p>
<p>that the 'Ukraine' movement is
</p>
<p>bound to lead sooner or later to war
</p>
<p>between Austria and Russia, and
</p>
<p>many of them think that this war
</p>
<p>will decide the fate of Poland. If
</p>
<p>Austria were victorious the whole
</p>
<p>'Ukraine't might be annexed to Aus-
</p>
<p>tria, while Russian Poland, and per-
</p>
<p>haps West Galicia, would be taken
</p>
<p>by Prussia, as compensation for the
</p>
<p>increase of Austrian territory. If
</p>
<p>Austria were beaten she would prob-
</p>
<p>ably lose the whole of Galicia to
</p>
<p>Russia, who would make a new
</p>
<p>'Government' of the eastern portion,
</p>
<p>and include the western portion in
</p>
<p>Russian Poland. There is a third

<p>THE GREAT CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>But those who predict it usually
</p>
<p>leave the vitality of Austria herself
</p>
<p>out of their reckoning. The next ten
</p>
<p>years may be a very important
</p>
<p>period for all the three empires
</p>
<p>which took part in the division of
</p>
<p>Poland, and may once more show
</p>
<p>that there is an imminent justice in
</p>
<p>the history, from which even the
</p>
<p>most powerful empires cannot es-
</p>
<p>cape."
</p>
<p>While the period of ten years may
</p>
<p>appear short enough to a foreign ob-
</p>
<p>server, a Ruthenian cannot help think-
</p>
<p>ing that the hour of reckoning is at
</p>
<p>hand. Before two or three years are
</p>
<p>over, we may hear the trumpets sound
</p>
<p>and armies march to war. In fact,
</p>
<p>rarely a month passes nowadays that
</p>
<p>at some period of it or another, a
</p>
<p>cloud of bloody struggle does not
</p>
<p>darken the horizon in Ukraine. The
</p>
<p>population live in constant expectation
</p>
<p>of an outbreak of hostilities. Trade
</p>
<p>and commerce are crippled, and foreign
</p>
<p>credit dead. The people's minds are
</p>
<p>turning to different problems, their
</p>
<p>moods to different tunes. With Shake-
</p>
<p>speare the Ruthenians could say that:

<p>conflict means very much. It means
</p>
<p>the burning of their villages, the de-
</p>
<p>struction of their cities; it means the
</p>
<p>turning of their beautiful fertile land
</p>
<p>into a temporary desert.
</p>
<p>It means the utter disorganization of
</p>
<p>their economic life for a long period
</p>
<p>of years before, during, and after tht
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>It means also large sacrifices in men.
</p>
<p>As Russian and Austrian soldiers they
</p>
<p>wil march against each other, and
</p>
<p>thousands of them, hundreds of thous-
</p>
<p>ands, will lay their lives on the altar
</p>
<p>of the Moloch of War.
</p>
<p>Thousands more will suffer death,
</p>
<p>mutilation, and assault at the hand
</p>
<p>of invading soldiery.
</p>
<p>But the coming struggle means much
</p>
<p>more to them than simply their suf-
</p>
<p>ferings, as the population of the im-
</p>
<p>mediate theatre of war. The struggle
</p>
<p>between Austria and Russia will de-
</p>
<p>cide, for generations to come, their
</p>
<p>position as a race.

<p>Should Russia happen to be victori-

</p>
<p>AN APPEAIi.
</p>
<p>The object of the present appeal is
</p>
<p>to protest before the civilized world
</p>
<p>thj feelings of the Ruthenians in view
</p>
<p>of the aproaching events.
</p>
<p>We desire the world to understand
</p>
<p>distinctly, that those of us who are
</p>
<p>Austro-Hungarian subjects, have not
</p>
<p>a* slightest wish to become Russian
</p>
<p>subjects.
</p>
<p>In spite of Russian assertions, which,
</p>
<p>unfortunately, are better known in
</p>
<p>England and France than our own
</p>
<p>claims, we wish the public to under-
</p>
<p>stand that we, the supposed sufferers,
</p>
<p>have never complained ourselves of
</p>
<p>any religious persecution of our co-
</p>
<p>nationals on the part of Austria.t Any
</p>
<p>complaints to that effect that were
</p>
<p>raised, were raised exclusively by Rus-
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>In Russia their revival is treated as
</p>
<p>treasonable. As long as this is so,
</p>
<p>they cannot afford to see the Austrian

<p>part of their country fall into the Rus-
</p>
<p>sian hands.
</p>
<p>sia.
</p>
<p>The Ruthenians of Austria view the
</p>
<p>Russian advance with utter suspicion
</p>
<p>and great alarm. They want Russia
</p>
<p>to leave them alone.
</p>
<p>This view was expressly stated by

<p>December, 1912, when it was declared
</p>
<p>that in case of war, the Ruthenians
</p>
<p>of Austria will stand firmly by Aus-
</p>
<p>tria's side. The resolutions of that
</p>
<p>Council fully representative of every-
</p>
<p>thing that matters in Austrian Ru-
</p>
<p>thenia, should be read by everybody
</p>
<p>who wants to know the truth about
</p>
<p>the feelings of the people. These reso-
</p>
<p>lutions were never forgotten by the
</p>
<p>Russians.
</p>
<p>The Ruthenians want Galicia to re-
</p>
<p>main in the conditions of civilized life;
</p>
<p>they want it preserved as the refuge
</p>
<p>of their national revival.
</p>
<p>tFar from that being the case, the
</p>
<p>protests against Russian impositions
</p>
<p>never ceased. One of them  that of
</p>
<p>the Orthodox Ruthenians of Bukovina
</p>
<p> may be here especially noticed: it de-
</p>
<p>clared in the name of the Orthodox
</p>
<p>that they were never persecuted in
</p>
<p>Austria.
</p>
<p>In Russia, their national rights were
</p>
<p>guaranteed to them by the Russo-
</p>
<p>Ruthenian Treaty of Perejaslav. This
</p>
<p>Treaty is on the Statute Book of the
</p>
<p>Russian Empire, a succession of Rus-
</p>
<p>sian Tzars have solemnly confirmed it,
</p>
<p>and it has never been abrogated.
</p>
<p>In the Heir of the Russian Throne
</p>
<p>the office of Hetman or lawful ruler of
</p>
<p>Ukraine is vested. When Russia will
</p>
<p>re-establish the autonomy, which is
</p>
<p>their due, then only she may expect a

<p>u
</p>
<p>THE GREAT
</p>
<p>language as the language of instruc-
</p>
<p>tion into the schools, colleges and uni-
</p>
<p>versities of the Ruthenian territory in
</p>
<p>Russia; the restitution of its rights in
</p>
<p>the Administration, Railways, Post
</p>
<p>Offices and Law Courts of the Prov-
</p>
<p>ince; the concession of autonomy in
</p>
<p>legislation, with grant of a local par-
</p>
<p>liament in Kiev might at least for a
</p>
<p>time completely satisfy the Ruthenian
</p>
<p>subjects of the Tzar. This policy
</p>
<p>would destroy the awkward feeling
</p>
<p>which now seems to be prevalent
</p>
<p>among them, that no better national
</p>
<p>future can be hoped for by them with-
</p>
<p>in the Empire.
</p>
<p>After all, it must not be forgotten,
</p>
<p>that the best regiments of Russia are
</p>
<p>composed of Ruthenians; and that an
</p>
<p>important portion of her armies the
</p>
<p>Cossackdom of Kuban is an entirely
</p>
<p>Ruthenian organization. The majority
</p>
<p>of the Russian sailors including all
</p>
<p>the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet-
</p>
<p>are Ruthenians. Is it wise so to strain
</p>
<p>their loyalty by persistent suppression
</p>
<p>of their national rights, that they
</p>
<p>should turn their eyes to Austria, as a
</p>
<p>more desirable Ally?
</p>
<p>Russia .likes to represent herself

</p>
<p>ceases to persecute ruthlessly the Ru-

<p>thenians, who are the second largest

</p>
<p>her prestige among the Southern and
</p>
<p>Western Slavs alike, if she put an end
</p>
<p>to this ignominious policy?
</p>
<p>The Slav policy of Russia is con-
</p>
<p>fronted, although it may be so far lit-
</p>
<p>tle appreciated in England, with a
</p>
<p>strong antidote: the Slav policy of
</p>
<p>Austria. It is not at all a fact, as is
</p>
<p>commonly imagined in the West, that
</p>
<p>Austria's policy is universally hated
</p>
<p>by the Slavs, while that of Russia
</p>
<p>meets with general enthusiaism. Of
</p>
<p>late years there has been a growing
</p>
<p>feeling noticeable in favor of the so-
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACV
</p>
<p>called "Austro-Slavism." Austria is nd
</p>
<p>more regarded as "a German Power
</p>
<p>aiming at the enslavement of the Slav
</p>
<p>peoples." Slavonic peoples within her
</p>
<p>borders, have succeeded in attaining a
</p>
<p>great degree of independence and free-
</p>
<p>dom. Even greater measure of liberty
</p>
<p>may be attained in the near future.

<p>The Archduke Franz Ferdinand is
</p>
<p>credited with vast schemes for the for-
</p>
<p>mation of a huge confederacy of Slav-
</p>
<p>onic peoples under the Hapsburg sway.
</p>
<p>These, and like rumors, are bound to
</p>
<p>act as a strong ferment when Russia's

</p>
<p>THE BRITISH ACCOMLICE,
</p>
<p>We charge Great Britain with abet-
</p>
<p>ting the foul cause of Russia.
</p>
<p>The moral responsibility for Eng-
</p>
<p>land's crime rests with Sir Edward
</p>
<p>Grey and Winston Churchill, First
</p>
<p>Lord of the British Admiralty. These
</p>
<p>two indefatigable executors of Brit-
</p>
<p>ain's policy, the last will and testa-
</p>
<p>ment of Victoria's scheming son, pro-
</p>
<p>viding for the isolation of Germany
</p>
<p>and the destruction of her naval, polit-
</p>
<p>ical and economic power, are the real
</p>
<p>perpetrators of the most colossal crime
</p>
<p>ever committed upon civilization.
</p>
<p>There is ample documentary evidence
</p>
<p>to prove that Great Britain's partici-
</p>
<p>pation in the war is the logical con-
</p>
<p>clusion derived from English com-
</p>
<p>mercialism and insatiable greed as
</p>
<p>premisses. We are also in a position
</p>
<p>to produce documents disclosing the
</p>
<p>fact that the British government had
</p>
<p>full information of Russia's anxiety
</p>
<p>for war, and that, rather than promo-
</p>
<p>ting the ends of peace, England wel-
</p>
<p>comed the opportunity of a general
</p>
<p>European conflagration on the ruins of
</p>
<p>which the British Empire might be re-
</p>
<p>constructed.
</p>
<p>The hypocrisy of the British Cabinet
</p>
<p>is reflected in its own official corre-
</p>
<p>spondence; of the British "White
</p>
<p>Paper."

<p>The intended
</p>
<p>neutrality was
</p>
<p>"casus belli,"
</p>
<p>government had
</p>
<p>violation of Belgian
</p>
<p>artfully declared as
</p>
<p>though the German
</p>
<p>notified the British
</p>
<p>Foreign Office that the neutrality of
</p>
<p>Belgian territory would be respected
</p>
<p>if Great Britain would guarantee not
</p>
<p>to interfere in the conflict. This is
</p>
<p>proven by the following telegraphic
</p>
<p>messages forwarded by Sir Edward
</p>
<p>Grey to the British Ambassadors to
</p>
<p>Germany and France:
</p>
<p>"Sir Edward Grey to Sir E. Goshen,
</p>
<p>London Foreign Office, Aug. 1, 1914.
</p>
<p>Sir:  I told the German Ambassador
</p>
<p>today that the reply of the German
</p>
<p>government with regard to the neu-
</p>
<p>trality of Belgium was a matter of
</p>
<p>very great regret, because the neu-
</p>
<p>trality of Belgium affected feelings in
</p>
<p>this country.
</p>
<p>"He asked me whether, if Germany
</p>
<p>gave a promise not to violate Bel-
</p>
<p>gium's neutrality, we would engage to
</p>
<p>remain neutral. I replied that I could
</p>
<p>not say that; our hands were still free.
</p>
<p>"The Ambassador pressed me as to
</p>
<p>whether I could not formulate con-
</p>
<p>ditions on which we would remain neu-
</p>
<p>tral. He even suggested that the in-
</p>
<p>tegrity of France and her colonies

</p>
<p>ed by the British statesmen for over
</p>
<p>200 years. In an English pamphlet of
</p>
<p>1694 we read the following passage:
</p>
<p>"It is of special interest to England
</p>
<p>to maintain the European balance for
</p>
<p>the purpose of holding the scale in its
</p>
<p>hands and of being able to turn it to
</p>
<p>whatever side it desires. That is our
</p>
<p>only possible means of not only keep-
</p>
<p>ing intact the empire of the seas, but
</p>
<p>of also enabling us to decide about the
</p>
<p>sucess of war and about the conditions
</p>
<p>of peace."
</p>
<p>According to information available
</p>
<p>in European papers, Winston Churchill,
</p>
<p>on Sept. 11, 1914, delivered an address
</p>
<p>at the London Opera House. These
</p>
<p>are his most pregnant utterances:
</p>
<p>"This will be a long and difficult war
</p>
<p>with many possible disappointments
</p>
<p>The only certain way to end the war
</p>
<p>would be for England to send a mil-
</p>
<p>lion armed men to the continent. In
</p>
<p>the first six weeks of the war Ger-
</p>
<p>many' foreign trade has been de-
</p>
<p>stroyed, whereas British ships continue
</p>
<p>to carry on our commerce upon which
</p>
<p>depend the wealth, the industry and
</p>
<p>the power of this country in the pres-
</p>
<p>ent war. Moreover, Great Britain is
</p>
<p>transporting great masses of troops
</p>
<p>from all parts of the globe to the thea-
</p>
<p>ter of war. The entire North Sea has
</p>
<p>been searched, but the German fleet

</p>
<p>has not been discovered. Within the
</p>
<p>next twelve months the number of
</p>
<p>large warships to be built by Great
</p>
<p>Britain will be more than twice the
</p>
<p>number to be built by Germany, and
</p>
<p>the number of British cruisers will be
</p>
<p>three or four times as large. Our fore-
</p>
<p>most need at present is a large army
</p>
<p>which, protected by our navy, will
</p>
<p>finally decide this horrible conflict. If
</p>
<p>the British people are willing we can
</p>
<p>at once increase the number of our
</p>
<p>troops now in the field to one-quarter
</p>
<p>million men: about New Year's to one-
</p>
<p>half million; and, in the spring of 1915,
</p>
<p>to the full strength of twenty-five army
</p>
<p>corps. A compromise or armistice is
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>absolutely out of the question. Now,
</p>
<p>where we have gone so far we must
</p>
<p>unflinchingly proceed to the end. This
</p>
<p>is the same great war which would
</p>
<p>have been waged in 1909 if Russia had
</p>
<p>not then so far humiliated herself as
</p>
<p>to yield to German threats."
</p>
<p>This proves that England, expecting
</p>
<p>war five years ago, was ready to do
</p>
<p>her share as soon as occasion would
</p>
<p>demand, and that the only reason why
</p>
<p>England held back in 1909 was Rus-
</p>
<p>sia's unpreparedness. This is also cor-
</p>
<p>roborated by a statement made by Mr.
</p>
<p>Ramsay MacDonald, the representa-
</p>
<p>tive of the Labor Party in Parliament,

<p>intent of defrauding their clients. Ac-
</p>
<p>cording to English Common Law and
</p>
<p>criminal procedure, it rests with the
</p>
<p>prosecution, or with the victims seek-
</p>
<p>ing redress, to prove the criminal in-
</p>
<p>tent of the defrauder, and this is gen-
</p>
<p>erally impossible owing to the fact
</p>
<p>that business of this particular nature,
</p>
<p>transacted in London, is not localized,
</p>
<p>but extends to all parts of the world.
</p>
<p>Thus, many hundred million Pounds
</p>
<p>Sterling were criminally appropriated
</p>
<p>by the London stockbrokers until these
</p>
<p>wholesale thefts w^ere detected by in-
</p>
<p>vestors who preferred to content them-
</p>
<p>selves with a moderate interest rather
</p>
<p>than suffer the total loss of their sav-
</p>
<p>ings. The result was that thousands
</p>
<p>of schemers with "brokerage" offices
</p>
<p>in the city of London were forced out
</p>
<p>nf business, and their help (cashiers,
</p>
<p>clerks, stenographers, typists, messen-
</p>
<p>gers, etc.) lost their bread.

<p>four-fifths of London real estate, and

<p>ly led to a revolution and compelled
</p>
<p>Lloyd George to ask Parliament for

</p>
<p>of Irish home-rule, is well known to
</p>
<p>all.
</p>
<p>These were the causes which prompt-
</p>
<p>ed the British Government anxious not
</p>
<p>to lose all power and control  to direct
</p>
<p>public attention to the necessity of de-
</p>
<p>stroying a country whose one fault is
</p>
<p>the aggressive commercial enterprise
</p>
<p>and success.
</p>
<p>Greed is a trait of British national
</p>
<p>character, and history knows of many
</p>
<p>instances of International highway
</p>
<p>robbery and piracy, protected and
</p>
<p>prompted by the British Government.
</p>
<p>British policies have always been
</p>
<p>unprincipled, and their object has
</p>
<p>never been the realization of the ideal
</p>
<p>of liberty, but the exploitation and op-
</p>
<p>pression of other nations.
</p>
<p>In an editorial of Sept. 17, 1914, the
</p>
<p>New York Evening Post, rejecting the
</p>
<p>idea that America would sympathize
</p>
<p>with a war of greed, remarks:
</p>
<p>"On the English side, too, there is
</p>
<p>plenty of evidence that the German
</p>
<p>eagle is to have no tail feathers left
</p>
<p>if certain outraged Britons can have
</p>
<p>their way. Thus we learn from a
</p>
<p>lurid advertisement in the "Manches-
</p>
<p>ter Guardian": 'How Women Can Join
</p>
<p>in the Grand Assault on Germany's
</p>

<p>of war on Germany's trade will go

<p>"The British Government at first in-
</p>
<p>timated that it did not wish to be
</p>
<p>drawn into a conflict. Sir George
</p>
<p>Buchanan openly made this statement.
</p>
<p>Today, however, St. Petersburg is not
</p>
<p>only firmly convinced, but even has
</p>
<p>been assured that Great Britain will
</p>
<p>aid France. This aid is of extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary importance, and has had no
</p>
<p>little effect upon the success of the
</p>
<p>efforts made by the military party."
</p>
<p>In a letter of Aug. 11, addressed to
</p>
<p>the New York "Nation" by its London
</p>
<p>correspondent, and published in the
</p>
<p>"Nation" on Aug. 27, we are informed
</p>
<p>of the fact that England began to
</p>
<p>make actual preparation for war on
</p>
<p>Aug. 1st. This would indicate that
</p>
<p>England's much-discussed efforts in
</p>
<p>behalf of peace were nothing but a
</p>
<p>stroke of hypocritical diplomacy.

<p>conditions prevailing in Radom, Rus-

<p>sian Poland, since the occupation of

<p>that city by Austrian soldiery. From

<p>one of these letters we gather that the

<p>Russian Government  two w^eeks be-
</p>
<p>fore the declaration of war by Ger-

<p>This proves beyond a doubt that
</p>
<p>Russia was determined to wage war
</p>
<p>against Austria (and Germany).
</p>
<p>In this connection it should be borne
</p>
<p>in mind that the Grand Duke Nicolai
</p>
<p>Nicolajevitch, the Czar's uncle and, at
</p>
<p>present, the Russian commander-in-
</p>
<p>chief, is a son-in-law of King Nicolaus
</p>
<p>of Montenegro, and a brother-in-law of
</p>
<p>the Servian King.
</p>
<p>Moreover, while King Peter Kara-
</p>
<p>georgevitch of Servia was pretender to
</p>
<p>the Servian crown he lived for many
</p>
<p>years in Switzerland at the expense of
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY 3i
</p>
<p>the Russian Government, and the
</p>
<p>funds necessary for educating Peter's
</p>
<p>two sons, George and Alexander, in
</p>
<p>Russian military schools at St. Peters-
</p>
<p>burg.
</p>
<p>The well-informed British Foreign
</p>
<p>Office, like all diplomats conversant
</p>
<p>with recent Balkan intrigues, knew
</p>
<p>that this royal Russo-Servian clique
</p>
<p>was directly responsible for the brutal
</p>
<p>assassination of King Alexander (Ob-
</p>
<p>ranovitch )and his wife, Draga, in 1903;
</p>
<p>and that the same clique prepared the
</p>
<p>murderous plot of Serajewo.
</p>
<p>All this goes to show that the Aus-
